The salient activities of the Project include (i) develop \nan  institutional  framework  for  integrated  coastal  resources \nmanagement (ICRM), address policy weaknesses and legal gaps, \nclarify roles of national government agencies concerned and local \ngovernments,  and  address  their  capacity-building  needs;  (ii) \nassess  resources  in  the  coastal  zone  of  participating \nmunicipalities;  develop  and  implement  ICRM  plans  and \nparticipatory  law  enforcement;  and  develop  ecocertification \nmechanisms for trade in coral-associated species; (iii) implement \nbiodiversity conservation in priority marine biodiversity corridors \nsupported  by  focused  research  on  critical  ecosystems  and \nthreatened  species;  (iv)  help  municipal  fisherfolk  develop \nsustainable enterprises and livelihoods, reducing their reliance on \nfishing; and (v) improve water supply, sanitation, and solid waste \nmanagement; provide add-on classrooms to existing schools for \ndisadvantaged  coastal  communities;  provide  infrastructure  and \nfacilities for mitigating coastal erosion and pollution; and support \nan information, education, and communication program on the link \nbetween  population  and  environmental  quality  and  population \nmanagement. \n \n  The Project will be implemented in six priority marine biodiversity \ncorridors  and  ecosystems  covering  68  municipalities  in  the \nprovinces of Cagayan, Cebu, Davao Oriental, Masbate, Siquijor, \nand Zambales. ", "ii   \nRationale  The  coastal  and  marine  resources  of  the  Philippines  are  of \nnational and global importance because of their rich biodiversity \nand  valuable  contribution  to  the  economy.  However,  these \nresources are declining and biodiversity is under threat due to \nhuman activities. Coral reefs, mangroves, sea grass, and other \nimportant  coastal  habitats  are  under  severe  stress  with \nconsequential decrease in the production of coastal fisheries. The \nresource  depletion  has  affected  the  livelihood  of  fisherfolk;  an \noverwhelming majority live in poverty. \n \n  Since the mid-1980s, the Government has implemented a number \nof coastal resources management programs, mostly as technical \nassistance from multilateral and bilateral agencies and some as \npart  of  major  investment  and  policy  initiatives  in  the  sector. \nInterventions under these programs, notably in marine protected \nareas,  resulted  in  significant  positive  impacts  on  biophysical \nparameters  such  as  coral  cover,  fish  catch,  and  biodiversity; \npromoted good governance practices especially locally with the \nparticipation of local communities in resource management and \nlaw enforcement; and created an awareness among local officials \nand  coastal  communities  of  the  need  for  conservation  and \nprotection of coastal ecosystems. Despite these significant gains, \nthreats  to  the  management  of  coastal  resources  and  marine \nbiodiversity persist due to a number of complex factors including \nlack of an ICRM approach to coastal zone planning, policy and \ninstitutional  weaknesses,  weak  law  enforcement,  high  poverty \nincidence among coastal fisherfolk, and open access to marine \nand coastal resources. \n \nBuilding  on  the  experience  of  past  programs,  the  Project  will \nassist the Government to adopt a holistic approach to coastal \nresources  management  integrating  terrestrial  and  coastal \nenvironments, strengthening policy and institutional frameworks, \ndeveloping local government capacity, and reducing pressure on \ncoastal resources.  \n \nImpact and Outcome  The  expected  impact  is  enhanced  coastal  resources.  The \noutcomes  of  the  Project  will  be  sustainable  management  of \ncoastal resources and increased income for coastal communities. \n \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $62.32 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $5.15 million. \n   ", "  iii\nFinancing Plan  A loan of $33.80 million from the ordinary capital resources of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided under ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The \nloan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 6 years, \nan  interest rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, and a commitment charge of 0.75% per \nannum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement \n \n  The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has approved a grant of \n$9.00  million  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The  grant,  to  be \nadministered by ADB, will cover costs for biodiversity conservation \nand management-related activities. The national and municipal \ngovernments  and  beneficiary  communities  will  finance  the \nremaining $19.52 million.   \n($ million) \n Source  Total  Percent \n Asian Development Bank  33.80  54.2 \n Global Environment Facility  9.00  14.4 \n Central Government  8.71  14.0 \n Local Governments and Beneficiaries  10.81  17.4 \nTotal  62.32  100.0 \n Sources: Asian Development Bank and Government estimates. \n    \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The  Government  will  allocate  $9.38  million  of  the  ADB  loan \nTerms  proceeds  to  municipal  governments  for  priority  social  and \nenvironmental infrastructure as a mix of loan and grant; this will \ncomplement equity contributions of municipal governments and \nbeneficiaries. The proportion of loan and grant and terms and \nconditions for the loan will be in accordance with the National \nGovernment and Local Government Unit Cost-Sharing Policy. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2013 \n   \nExecuting Agency  Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) \n   \nImplementation  DENR,  Department  of  Agriculture  (DA),  and  participating \nArrangements  municipal  governments  will  share  the  implementation \nresponsibilities. The Foreign-Assisted and Special Projects Office \nat DENR central office will be the project management office. \nImplementation in the regions will be carried out by the protected \narea wildlife and coastal zone management services located at \nthe DENR regional offices in regions II, III, V, VII, and XI; and the \nprovincial  environment  and  natural  resources  offices  and \ncommunity  environment  and  natural  resources  offices \n(subprovincial). \n ", "iv   \n  DA will designate the Office of the Assistant Director for Technical \nServices of its Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources central \noffice as the focal point of its functions and responsibilities for the \nProject. DA will conduct field activities through its regional offices \ncovering the project area. Municipal governments will undertake \nall resource management activities through the community-based \nfisheries  and  aquatic  resources  management  councils,  bantay-\ndagats (marine watch teams) and other peoples\u2019 organizations. \nSimilarly, municipal governments will implement most of the social \nand environmental infrastructure and facilities through beneficiary \ncommunities on a cost-sharing basis. \n   \nProcurement  All goods and related services financed under the loan and GEF \ngrant  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time).  \n   \nConsulting Services  An  estimated  369  person-months  of  consulting  services, \ncomprising  51  person-months  international  and  318  person-\nmonths national consultants, will be required to assist the national \ngovernment agencies, local governments, and local communities \nin  implementing  the  Project.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(April 2006, as amended from time to time) by Asian Development \nBank and its borrowers. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will achieve the following major benefits: (i) laws and \nBeneficiaries  regulations  governing  coastal  resources  management  will  be \nharmonized and interagency coordination will be improved; (ii) an \nICRM  system  will  be  institutionalized  in  68  municipalities;  (iii) \nabout 50 MPAs including about 5,000 hectares (ha) of sanctuary \nareas will be managed by local governments, with 10% increase \nin fish catch outside the protected areas; (iv) about 50,000 ha of \ncoral reefs will be brought under improved management, with 10% \nimprovement  in  hard  coral  cover;  (v)  7,000  ha  of  existing \nmangroves  will  be  enriched/rehabilitated,  and  2,000  ha  of \nmangrove will be reestablished, with 20% improvement in density; \n(vi) about 3,000 ha in watersheds will be reforested and 4,000 ha \nof  denuded  watershed  will  be  rehabilitated,  contributing  to \nreduction in soil erosion and flash flooding; (vii) incidence of illegal \nfishing  will  be  reduced  by  50%;  (viii)  women\u2019s  participation  in \ncoastal resources management and alternative livelihood activities \nwill  be  significantly  enhanced;  and  (ix)  disadvantaged  coastal \ncommunities will have improved access to safe water, sanitation, \nand community services. \n \n  The poverty impact analysis in the sample municipalities indicates \nthat about 71% of net economic gains will accrue to the poor. With \n76% of coastal residents living below the poverty line and 61% of \nthese employed in fishing, the Project will have a major impact in \ncombating poverty and improving income distribution.    \n   ", "  v\nRisks and Assumptions  The  successful  implementation  of  the  Project  will  require \nstakeholders to agree and adjust to the policy and governance \nregime  changes  promoted  by  the  Project.  While  most  of  the \nstakeholders  have  been  supportive  of  these  changes  during \nproject preparation, some may be slow in responding to the needs \nfor  change  during  project  implementation.  The  risk  will  be \nmitigated by the emphasis on public information and capacity- \nbuilding activities conducted throughout the project period. \n  \n \n \n ", "", " \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) proposed administration of a grant provided by the Global Environment Facility \n(GEF),  both  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Integrated  Coastal  Resources \nManagement (ICRM) Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The Philippines comprises about 7,100 islands (300,000 square kilometers [km2] of land) \nand has an estimated 36,000 km of coastline extending 2,000 km from north to south. With the \nadoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Philippine territorial waters \ncomprise approximately 2.2 million km2 with a coastal area of 226,000 km2 and oceanic area of \n1.93 million km2. Of the country\u2019s 1,541 municipalities, 832 (or 54%) border the coast. Twenty-\nfive major cities are located on the coast and 62% of the population lives in the coastal zone.  \n3.  The marine and coastal areas of the Philippines support a large area of productive \ncoastal ecosystems and habitats that include about 25,000 km2 of coral reefs, sea grass, and \nalgal beds; 138,000 hectares (ha) of mangroves (reduced from 450,000 ha in 1920); a variety of \nproductive fisheries that provide more than 50% of the animal protein consumed in the country; \nand many beaches and varied coastlines of value for tourism and other development. With 430 \nspecies of corals, 2,300 species of fishes, 16 species of sea grass, hundreds of seaweed \nspecies, and thousands of species of marine invertebrates, the Philippines has one of the \nrichest marine and coastal ecosystems in the world. \n4.  Benefits  derived  directly  from  the  coastal  habitats  are  substantial.  Although  not  all \nbenefits are quantified in economic terms, coral reefs alone are currently estimated to contribute \nat least $1.06 billion annually to the economy. This estimate would be significantly more with \nimproved coastal management efforts. The Philippines is the 11th largest fish producer in the \nworld. Its annual total fisheries yield is estimated to be worth around $2.5 billion, equivalent to \nabout 4.3% of its gross domestic product. Marine capture fisheries account for around 62% of \nthe total annual fisheries yield, while the rest comes from aquaculture and inland fisheries. The \nannual harvest of marine capture fisheries is around 1.67 million tons, worth $578 million in \n1994. Municipal fisheries (excluding reef fish) were estimated to yield annual economic benefits \nof $620 million in 2002. The Philippine fishing industry employs more than 1 million people (5% \nof  the  national  labor  force),  with  68%  employed  in  the  municipal  sector  and  28%  in  the \ncommercial and aquaculture sectors.  \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Demographics and Coastal Poverty \n5.  About 1 million coastal residents and their families are directly dependent on coastal and \nmarine resources for sustenance and survival. Surveys in potential project areas indicate that a \ncoastal household\u2019s average annual income, is P56,486. Based on their source, employment \nprovides the highest average (P86,134), followed by farming (P55,548), business (P52,831), \nand fishing (P50,310). Poverty incidence in the coastal community is extremely high at 76%, \ncompared with the general level of 41.8% in the target provinces and 34.2 nationwide. \n6.  Social infrastructure is limited in most coastal areas. Some 28% of households lack \ntoilets. Access to potable water for some is through dug shallow wells (18%), artesian wells \n(2%),  water  vendors  (1%),  or  springs  (1%).  Garbage  disposal  is  primarily  by  burning  or ", "2     \nindiscriminate dumping in vacant lots or one\u2019s own backyard. Less than 5% of households \nreport that their garbage is collected through a municipal solid waste collection system. \n2.  Sector Issues  \n7.  The coastal resources sector, although potentially rich and productive, is declining and \nunder threat due to human activities. Of the 25,000 km2 of coral reefs, less than 5% are in \nexcellent condition. Mangrove forests are declining at a rate of 2,000 ha/year; total coverage \ndecreased from around 4,500 km2 in 1918 to about 1, 380 km2 in the 1990s. Municipal fisheries \nproduction has been declining, and the average reef fish catch per unit effort is now less than 2 \nkilograms (kg)/day, down from as much as 20 kg/day 30 years ago. \n8.  Overfishing,  the  use  of  destructive  fishing  practices,  and  habitat  conversion  have \nadversely affected coastal ecosystems, threatening permanent damage. Increasing pollution \nfrom land-based activities, industrial and urban development, deforestation, and soil erosion \nhave lowered water quality and contributed to declining productivity in coastal waters. Rapid \npopulation growth and increasing concentration of population and economic activities near the \ncoastal zone have added to the mounting pressure on finite coastal resources. \n9.  Policy and institutional weaknesses also serve as barriers to effective coastal resources \nmanagement. The absence of a comprehensive ICRM policy and an institutional framework for \nits  implementation  has  at  times  resulted  in  conflicting  actions  and  initiatives  by  national \ngovernment agencies and local governments. Some coastal resources management functions, \nnotably fisheries, have been devolved to local governments but other functions pertaining to \nmanagement of critical habitats such as mangroves and watersheds, pollution and foreshore \nmanagement, and urban and industrial development in the coastal areas, have been retained by \nvarious agencies of the national Government. Local governments lack technical knowledge, \nskills, and resources to successfully develop effective management regimes and harmonize \nvarious interests operating in the coastal area. In addition, lack of qualified staff prevents the \nDepartment  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources  (DENR)  and  other  national  agencies \nconcerned from assisting local governments in effectively carrying out coastal management \nfunctions and properly coordinating with them.  \n10.  A common issue in coastal resources management has been the poor compliance with \nlaws  and  regulations.  This  is  partly  because  of  inconsistencies  in  laws,  regulations,  and \nguidelines  that  were  developed  over  time  and  across  sectors.  Sometimes  the  national \nregulations  and  department  administrative  orders  are  in  conflict  with  the  interest  of  local \ngovernments and their legislative mandate. Moreover, most local governments do not have the \ncapacity or budget to implement the laws under their jurisdiction.   \n11.  Sector issues and threats to biodiversity are discussed in Appendix 2. \n3.  External Assistance to the Sector \n12.  Agencies providing external assistance to the Philippines marine and coastal resources \nsector  include  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  Canadian  International  Development \nAgency, GEF, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, Organization of Petroleum Exporting \nCountries, United Nations Development Programme, United States Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID), and World Bank. ADB has been the lead agency in the sector, providing \nnine loans for $169.5 million for six projects; and 10 project preparatory and advisory technical \nassistance projects for $3.8 million. The World Bank follows, providing loans for $115 million. \nExternal assistance to the marine and coastal resources sector is described in Appendix 3.  ", "  3     \n13.  Earlier ADB-assisted projects aimed at improving fisheries production. Only two ADB \nprojects have direct relevance to the proposed Project: the Fisheries Sector Program1 and \nFisheries Resources Management Project.2 Most of the other external assistance to the sector \nwas also directed at increasing the efficiency of fishing fleets and developing aquaculture; only a \nfew programs and projects were directed at marine and coastal resources management. The \nnotables among the latter category are the USAID-financed Coastal Resources Management \nProject, German Government-supported Leyte Island Program for Sustainable Management of \nNatural  Resources,  and  the  World  Bank-financed  Central  Visayas  Regional  Project  and \nCommunity-Based Resource Management Project. \n14.  GEF  has  made  significant  direct  contributions  to  conserving  important  Philippine \nbiodiversity resources, both through regional and country-specific projects. The GEF-supported \nprojects  that  are  directly  or  indirectly  supporting  marine  biodiversity  conservation  include \n(i) Conservation of Priority Protected Area Project, approved in May 1991; (ii) Partnership for the \nEnvironmental Management for the Seas of East Asia, approved in November 1998; (iii) Coastal \nMarine Biodiversity Conservation Project, approved in May 1999; (iv) Tubataha Reef National \nMarine Park, approved in March 2000; (v) Critical Ecosystems Partnership Fund, approved in \nJuly 2000; (vi) Bohol Marine Triangle, approved in December 2000; (vii) Asian Conservation \nCorporation  and  Asian  Conservation  Foundation,  approved  in  May  2002;  and  (viii)  Marine \nAquaculture Market Transformation Initiative, approved in May 2004. \n4.  Lessons \n15.  The  Government  commenced  its  coastal  resources  management  initiatives, \nimplemented with bilateral and multilateral assistance, in the mid-1980s. Interventions, notably \nin  marine  protected  areas  (MPAs),  resulted  in  significant  positive  impacts  on  biophysical \nparameters  such  as  coral  cover,  fish  catch,  and  biodiversity;  promoted  good  governance \npractices, especially locally with the participation of local communities in resource management \nand law enforcement; and created an awareness among local officials and coastal communities \nof  the  need  for  conservation  and  protection  of  coastal  ecosystems.  About  150  coastal \nmunicipalities and cities have coastal resources management programs covering about 4,000 \nkm of coastline, the incidence of illegal fishing has declined significantly in provinces with \nmanagement programs, and more than 5,000 coastal resources management practitioners with \nvarious levels of training are now available within the government and nongovernment sectors \nin the country.  \n16.  Despite these significant gains, threats to the management of coastal resources still \npersist due to a number of complex factors including lack of an integrated approach to coastal \nzone  planning,  policy  and  institutional  weaknesses,  weak  law  enforcement,  high  poverty \nincidence among coastal fisherfolk, and open access to marine and coastal resources. The \nfollowing important lessons are identified from the implementation of previous programs: \n(i)  Holistic approach to coastal resources management. The origin of threats to \ncoastal areas spans from the watershed divide in the mountains to the sea. \nEffective coastal resources management, therefore, should follow an integrated, \nholistic approach that considers interaction among and within resource systems \nas well as interaction between humans and their environment. \n(ii)  Local  institutional  strengthening.  Local  governments  need  to  strengthen \ncapacity to manage their natural resources, and the national Government and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1989. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Republic of the Philippines for the Fisheries \nSector Program. Manila (Loans 971[SF]/972-PHI for $80 million). \n2  ADB. 1997. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Republic of the Philippines for the Fisheries \nResources Management Project. Manila (Loans 1562[SF]/1563-PHI for $35.2 million). \n ", "4     \nsector agencies concerned should assist them by providing resources, legal \nmandate,  and  technical  guidance.  Academic  institutions,  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs),  and  private  firms  can  provide  valuable  technical \nassistance and training functions in an efficient manner.      \n(iii)  Participatory planning addressing local issues. Local government coastal \nmanagement plans, developed through a community participation process, must \nintegrate a comprehensive set of interventions in the coastal zone, depending on \nthe  issues  and  needs  of  the  municipality.  These  include  municipal  water \ndelineation and zoning, regulations for fisheries and the use of other coastal \nresources, legislation and enforcement of national and local laws on ICRM, \nestablishment of marine sanctuaries, and foreshore and shoreline management.  \n(iv)  Income diversification. Enterprise development and alternative livelihoods for \nfisherfolk  are  essential  to  reduce  pressure  on  coastal  fisheries,  and  should \nprecede  conservation  initiatives.  Economic  interventions  with  private  sector \ninvestment and buy-in are more viable and allow for better and faster technology \ntransfer to village-based partners.  \n \n17.  Specific lessons from implementation of the Fisheries Sector Program loan (footnote 1) \ninclude (i) policy initiatives should be supported by information, education, and communication \n(IEC) campaigns and provide for adequate preparation of stakeholders; (ii) a process approach \nshould be adopted that allows necessary changes/modifications to the original design; (iii) \nproject  implementation  should  involve  local  government  units  (LGUs)  and  provide  for  a \nmechanism for determining and delineating responsibilities between the national Government \nand LGUs; (iv) alternative livelihood programs should provide for adequate social preparation of \nbeneficiaries;  and  (v)  availability  of  capable  local  NGOs  is  often  overestimated  and  this \nconstraint should be considered in the project design.3 The implementation experience of the \nrecently  completed  Fisheries  Resources  Management  Project  (footnote  2)  identified  the \nfollowing: (i) capacity-building needs of implementing agencies should be addressed, (ii) LGUs \nshould be directly involved in planning and implementing field activities, (iii) not all municipalities \nhave  capable  NGOs  to  help  with  project  implementation,  and  (iv)  livelihood  development \nactivities should precede the implementation of conservation programs.  \n18.  In addition, major lessons from various GEF-, USAID-, and World Bank-assisted projects \nin the country and region are (i) projects should have a broad stakeholder focus in planning, \ncapacity building, and implementation; (ii) management plans should be flexible and adaptive to \nbuild on monitoring and research findings; (iii) projects should have a practical and simple \napproach involving proven and tested tools/activities; (iv) project design should emphasize \ninstitutional and financial sustainability of conservation and management initiatives; and (v) \nlinkages with similar ongoing projects should be built in the project design. \n5.  Government Policy and Strategy for Coastal Resources Management \n19.  The  Government  recognizes  the  problems  of  (i)  extensive  poverty  in  the  coastal \ncommunity, (ii) degradation of natural resources, (iii) unbalanced use of aquatic resources, and \n(iv) increasing population concentration in coastal zones. In 2003, the Government drafted, with \nUnited Nations Development Programme assistance, ArcDev: A Framework for Sustainable \nPhilippine Archipelagic Development, which articulates a common vision and unified strategy for \ncoastal  and  marine  resources  development.  The  salient  aspects  of  the  framework  are  (i) \npromotion of archipelagic integration that recognizes the interaction of land, sea, air, and people \nin an archipelagic setting; (ii) meaningful and responsive participation of all stakeholders in \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2000. Project Performance Audit Report on the Fisheries Sector Program in the Philippines. Manila. ", "  5     \nplanning  and  implementing  an  integrated  ocean  management  policy;  (iii)  conservation, \nprotection, and use of marine resources and marine environment for the benefit of present and \nfuture  generations;  and  (iv) sustainable  development  of  coastal  resources  for  economic \ndevelopment in the coastal region and well-being of coastal people. A draft policy on coastal \nresources management, prepared with USAID assistance, needs to be finalized through a \nconsultative process taking into account recent developments, particularly the emphasis on a \nholistic approach to resource management. The Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan \n2004\u20132010  emphasizes  (i)  participatory  planning,  zoning,  and  standard  setting  in  coastal \nprotection and management; (ii) delineation of coastal zones for protection, exploration, and \nutilization;  and  delineation  of  municipal  waters  in  coastal  areas  with  offshore  islands; \n(iii) rehabilitation and management of mangrove and coastal watersheds; and (iv) establishment \nand management of MPAs in cooperation with LGUs.  \n20.  In June 2006, the President of the Philippines issued Executive Order 533 adopting \nintegrated coastal management as a national strategy to ensure sustainable development of the \ncountry\u2019s  coastal  and  marine  environment  and  resources,  and  establishing  supporting \nmechanisms for its implementation. The order requires DENR to develop a national program on \ncoastal and marine resources management following an integrated approach and addressing \nrelated policy, institutional, legal, social, and economic issues.   \n6.  ADB\u2019s Sector Objectives and Strategies \n21.  ADB\u2019s country operational strategy,4which is closely aligned with the Government\u2019s \ndevelopment  objectives,  aims  at  supporting  Government  initiatives  for  improving  fiscal \nresponsibility and revitalizing the economy, improving management of assets, reducing poverty \nand geographical inequalities, protecting the environment, and promoting good governance. In \nthe  agriculture  and  natural  resources  sector,  ADB  will  support  resource  management, \ndevelopment  of  sustainable  enterprises  and  livelihoods,  and  development  of  basic  social \nservices and rural infrastructure. The sector will focus on improving the capacity of LGUs for \ndevolved  responsibilities,  as  well  as  strengthening  the  capacity  of  community-based \norganizations, NGOs, and local institutions.   \n22.  The proposed Project belongs to group II of the priority classification of ADB\u2019s Medium-\nTerm Strategy II, and will support environmental management and biodiversity conservation. An \nimportant element of the Medium-Term Strategy II is promoting regional cooperation in the \nmanagement of public goods such as natural resources including marine and coastal resources. \nThe  conservation  and  management  impact  of  priority  biodiversity  corridors  and  marine \necosystems under the Project will go beyond Philippine waters, benefiting other countries in the \nregion. In particular, the Project will be an important complementary activity to the work being \ndiscussed with neighboring governments to support the sustainable development of the Sulu-\nSulawesi Sea ecoregion.      \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n23.  The  expected  impact  of  the  Project  is  enhanced  coastal  resources.  The  expected \noutcomes are sustainable management of coastal resources and increased income for coastal \ncommunities.  \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2005.

The  Project  will  cover  provinces  and  municipalities  surrounding  marine  biodiversity \ncorridors  of  national  and  global  importance  as  identified  by  the  Philippine  Biodiversity \nConservation Priorities.5 Four \u201cextremely high\u201d priority biodiversity corridors were selected: (i) \nthe Babuyan corridor along the northern coast of Luzon joining the Pacific Ocean and South \nChina  Sea,  (ii)  the  Ticao  Pass\u2013San  Bernardino  Strait\u2013Samar  Sea  corridor,  (iii)  the \nDaanbantayan corridor straddling the Visayas Sea and the Tanon Strait, and (iv) the Pujada \nBay corridor, an important point of convergence for bioregions of the Pacific Ocean and the \nCelebes Sea. Two more areas of \u201cvery high\u201d to \u201chigh\u201d priority marine biodiversity significance \nnear to marine corridors were selected: (i) the Zambales marine ecosystem in the Luzon Sea, \nand (ii) the Siquijor small-island marine ecosystem between the Bohol Sea and Sulu Sea. \nBiodiversity  significance  and  major  threats  of  these  marine  corridors  and  ecosystems  are \ndescribed in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n25.  Within the marine biodiversity corridor and ecosystems identified, six provinces were \nselected based on the following: (i) strategic location, (ii) status of coastal communities that can \npotentially benefit from the enhanced management of coastal resources, and (iii) willingness of \nprovinces and municipalities to support an ICRM program. The provinces selected are Cagayan, \nCebu, Davao Oriental, Masbate, Siquijor, and Zambales. Sixty-eight municipalities within these \nprovinces were selected and are listed in Appendix 4. \nB.  Outputs \n26.  The  Project  comprises  four  components:  component  A:  policy  and  institutional \nstrengthening and development; component B: ICRM and biodiversity conservation; component \nC:  enterprise  development  and  income  diversification,  and  component  D:  social  and \nenvironmental services and facilities. \n1.  Component A: Policy and Institutional Strengthening and Development \n27.  The component aims at (i) rationalizing Government policy for ICRM and improving \ncoordination mechanisms, (ii) strengthening national and local government institutional capacity, \nand  (iii)  developing  a  performance-based  incentive  and  disincentive  system  for  local \ngovernments. Policy weaknesses and legal gaps in the management of coastal zones and \nhabitats will be studied and corrective measures recommended. Drawing on the works under \nthe  previous  United  Nations  Development  Programme  assistance,  and  as  required  under \nExecutive Order 533 on integrated coastal management, the Project will develop an institutional \nframework for national and local government coordination of ICRM. A comprehensive national \npolicy on ICRM will be finalized and an IEC campaign undertaken. In light of the national policy, \nthe roles of the Department of Agriculture (DA), DENR, local governments, and other national \nGovernment agencies in ICRM and related activities will be clarified. Imposition and collection of \nuser fees and resource rents for MPAs, mangroves, coral reefs, beaches, and foreshores as \nsustainable means for financing ICRM operations will be studied and operationalized. \n28.  The Project will support human resource and institutional development of DA, DENR, \nand local governments. Capacity-building needs of the institutions and their human resources \nwill be assessed and appropriate strategies developed to address these. In view of the present \nmoratorium on the creation of new regular staff positions in national government agencies, \nDENR will address the present shortage of qualified staff in marine and coastal resources \nmanagement through staff redeployment and training. About 600 DA, DENR, and municipal \ngovernment staff will be trained in various aspects of ICRM including basic practices of coastal \nresources  management,  resource  enhancement,  social  preparation,  environmental \n                                                 \n5  DENR. 2002. Philippine Biodiversity Conservation Priorities: A Second Iteration of the National Biodiversity \nStrategy and Action Plan. Manila. ", "  7     \nmanagement, and biodiversity conservation. Multisector local government ICRM organizations, \nincluding  fisheries  and  aquatic  resources  management  committees, bantay  dagats  (marine \nwatch teams), and NGOs will be developed and strengthened. \n29.  The  Project  will  support  identification  and  dissemination  of  a  performance-based \nincentive-disincentive  system  that  builds  on  and  links  to  DENR\u2019s  coastal  resources \nmanagement certification system. The system establishes performance benchmarks for local \ngovernments.  Viable  material  incentives  will  be  provided  to  the  certificate  recipient  local \ngovernments to continue good coastal resources management practices. The performance-\nbased incentive system will be linked to the ecogovernance index developed under the USAID-\nassisted Ecogovernance Project of DENR.   \n2.  Component B: ICRM and Biodiversity Conservation \n30.  The  component  will  promote  basic  ICRM  practices,  i.e.,  adaptive  planning  and \nbudgeting,  municipal  water  zoning,  law  enforcement,  pollution  control  and  environmental \nmanagement,  resource  use  licensing,  and  management  of  foreshores,  beaches,  and \nmangroves. Coastal resources in 68 municipal waters will be assessed through participatory \nand scientific resource assessment. Participatory assessment will be undertaken for all the \ncoastal waters, while scientific assessments will be done in selected sites of high biodiversity; \nthe results will be reflected in the updated municipal coastal database and compiled in a \nnational coastal resources database. ICRM plans will be developed and integrated into the \nmunicipal planning process. About 7,000 ha of mangroves will be brought under improved \nmanagement and about 2,000 ha will be reforested. About 4,000 ha of denuded watersheds will \nbe reforested and 3,500 ha of forests in watersheds will be rehabilitated. Local fisheries and \naquatic resources management committees, marine watch teams, and NGOs will be trained on \nparticipatory enforcement mechanisms for fisheries laws and regulations, and provided with \nbasic equipment and facilities.  \n31.  The component will protect and manage coastal ecosystems in selected threatened \nareas of high biodiversity. Networks of 50 MPAs, comprising about 15\u201320 new MPAs and 30\u201335 \nexisting  MPAs,  will  be  developed  in  the  six  priority  biodiversity  corridors  and  marine \necosystems. MPA management plans will be developed and/or strengthened and functional \norganizations  will  be  put  in  place.  The  management  plans  will  be  supported  by  targeted \nresearch  on  critical  biodiversity  resources  including  sensitive  ecosystems  and  threatened \nflagship species, and will include species restocking and pilot schemes for coral reef and giant \nclam transplanting. Five ICRM centers will be established as hubs for biodiversity monitoring \nand research, and training and demonstration activities. The centers will be located at the \nexisting marine science institutions and project support will complement existing facilities for \nsimilar activities. ICRM centers will also be the focal points for undertaking an IEC campaign to \nbe  developed  and  implemented  in  coordination  with  the  ongoing  works  under  the \ncommunication, education, and public awareness program of the Convention on Biodiversity; \noperational links between the two will be examined and specific recommendations made during \nthe initial stage of project implementation.  \n32.  The  Project  will  also  support  development  and  implementation  of  a  system  for \necocertification  of  sustainable  harvesting  activities  in  reef-associated  species,  taking  into \naccount  the  changing  degree  of  vulnerability  of  species;  and  will  link  it  to  the  Project\u2019s \nbiodiversity monitoring program. The system will cover food fish and ornamental fish for the \naquarium market.6 The Project will train about 680 individuals from coastal communities and \n                                                 \n6  In developing an ecocertification system for aquarium market fish, the Project will coordinate with the GEF-assisted \nMarine Aquarium Market Transformation Initiative, approved in May 2004. \n ", "8     \nparticipating municipality staff in 68 municipalities to regulate and manage the trade of marine \nspecies. \n3.  Component C: Enterprise Development and Income Diversification \n33.  The component aims at providing municipal fisherfolk with supplementary income and \nreducing their reliance on fishing by promoting environment-friendly sustainable enterprises and \nlivelihoods. Technical and institutional support will be provided to undertake viable livelihoods \nand enterprises identified from similar ongoing programs and other potential ones. Enterprises \nproviding employment opportunities to about 6,800 people will be developed during project \nimplementation.  Priority  will  be  given  to  people  affected  by  the  restricted  use  of  coastal \nresources.  Activities  will  include  (i)  undertaking  social  preparation  including  community \norganization, needs and resource assessment, and savings mobilization; (ii) establishing an \nenterprise  development  unit  in  each  province,  identifying  appropriate  livelihoods  and \nenterprises,  and  undertaking  feasibility  and  market  studies;  (iii)  establishing  about  370 \nenterprises  in  68  municipalities,  and  training  6,800  fisherfolk  on  technical  and  managerial \naspects of enterprises; (iv) assisting community groups in preparing bankable business plans \nand accessing credit facilities of formal banking systems such as Land Bank of the Philippines, \nDevelopment Bank of the Philippines, rural and thrift banks, cooperatives and NGOs, or other \nexisting and programmed credit facilities including the Isang Bayan, Isang Produkto, Isang \nMilyong Piso programs; (v) helping develop partnerships between coastal communities and \nprivate entrepreneurs in enterprise operation, management, and marketing; and (vi) promoting \nand developing ICRM-related ecotourism. In developing livelihoods and enterprises, care will be \ntaken to ensure that intended activities are aligned and connected with those existing in the \nproject area.  \n4.  Component D: Social and Environmental Services and Facilities \n34.  This component will address the basic social services needs of disadvantaged coastal \ncommunities,  and  support  local  governments\u2019  efforts  to  mitigate  coastal  pollution  and \ndegradation of resources. The component will follow a demand-driven approach, providing \ntechnical and investment support to participating municipalities for improving water supply and \nsanitation, managing solid waste, providing add-on school classrooms and day-care centers, \nand mitigating coastal pollution and erosion. Beneficiaries will be trained on operation and \nmaintenance of the completed subprojects. The selection criteria for social and environmental \ninfrastructure are given in Appendix 5.  \nC.  Special Features \n35.  Biodiversity Conservation with GEF Participation. A key feature of the Project is the \nconservation  of  biodiversity  of  global  importance  with  GEF  involvement.  The  biodiversity \nconservation measures under the Project follow an innovative approach by developing networks \nof MPAs within marine corridors and ecosystems that are recognized as having high biodiversity \nof  global  significance.  By  promoting  protection  of  sites  over  an  extended  area  within  the \ncorridors,  greater  exchange  of  fish  and  larvae  will  result,  improving  chances  of  restoring \nbiodiversity  where  resource  depletion  and  habitat  loss  has  occurred.  By  reducing  gaps  in \nmanagement coverage in the corridors, weak links in the management chain will be reduced \nand more effective management of entire marine corridors will be supported.  \n36.  Poverty Targeting. The project design includes a combination of measures to maximize \nproject impact on poverty. The rural poverty incidence in the six provinces that will receive \nsupport for ICRM ranges between 25.8% and 77.0%, with a six-province average of 59.0% \ncompared with the national average of 48.8%. Within the rural population, the incidence of ", "  9     \npoverty is much higher in the coastal communities at 76.0%; the coastal population will be the \nprimary beneficiary of improved coastal resources management supported by the Project. The \ncriteria for selection of schemes under the social and environmental services and facilities \ncomponent will give priority to communities that have a high incidence of poverty. Similarly, the \nincome diversification and enterprise development component will focus on poor disadvantaged \ngroups with little or no access to technology and capital.  \n37.  Environmental Governance and Performance Monitoring. The Project will support \nimplementation of the ecogovernance index developed by the USAID-assisted Ecogovernance \nProject of DENR, which aims at greater transparency, accountability, and participatory decision-\nmaking in the management of natural resources, including marine and coastal resources, and \nenvironmental  management.  The  index  includes  four  activities  that  represent  the  flow  of \ngovernment actions in resource management: planning, budgeting, implementation (including \nprocurement and issuance of permits and licenses), and control or enforcement (monitoring, \nreporting, sanctioning, etc.). The index will be applied to measuring performance of DA, DENR, \nand local governments concerned; Internet access will be available through a website to be \nestablished for the Project.  \n38.  Gender and Development. Despite their extensive involvement in the marketing of \nfisheries and other aquatic products, women are not well represented in coastal resources \nmanagement, or in training, meetings and other related activities. While recognizing the need to \nrespect local values and beliefs, and the choices of both men and women about taking part in \nspecific activities, the Project will promote greater involvement of women in the decision-making \nprocess of ICRM. Specific activities include (i) national and local gender sensitization training \nand collection of gender-disaggregated data in household socioeconomic studies, biodiversity, \nand related ICRM research and policy and legal studies as the basis for defining intervention \nmeasures; (ii) integration of gender analysis in ICRM planning, monitoring, and evaluation; and \n(iii) conduct of gender and development orientation and related training to national and local \ngovernment  personnel  and  community  members.  The  project  strategy  for  gender  and \ndevelopment is outlined in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy (Appendix 6). The \ngender action plan (Appendix 7) sets a participation target for women of 33% in membership in \nICRM  organizations,  MPA  management  boards  and  self-reliant  groups  for  livelihood;  staff \ntraining in biodiversity and ICRM; and incremental staff recruitment for the Project. \n39.  Environmental Safeguards. The project activities are aimed at, among other things, \nsustainable management of marine and coastal resources and environmental protection, and by \ndesign are not expected to create any significant adverse environmental impact. An initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) (Supplementary Appendix B) was conducted during project \npreparation and the findings are summarized in Appendix 8. The IEE determines that most \nactivities will contribute to environmental improvement, and subprojects to be identified during \nimplementation are likely to be classified as B or C. Activities with potential adverse impact \nrelate to two components: (i) component C: income diversification and enterprise development, \nand (ii) component D: social and environmental facilities and services. Component C may \nsupport development of small-scale mariculture including cage farming, which could have small \nadverse environmental impacts. Such adverse impacts will be avoided or mitigated through \nappropriate siting, management, and monitoring. Prior to the commencement of mariculture, \nfisherfolk  will  be  trained  on  the  technology  and  management  of  mariculture,  including \nenvironmental management. The mariculture operation will be monitored as part of the overall \nresource management plan and environmental problems and issues will be identified, consistent \nwith the IEE for the Project, in time for appropriate action. Social and environmental facilities \nunder component D will include development of rural water supply, public toilets, classrooms, \nday-care centers, and small-scale coastal erosion structures\u2014construction of which, if not done \n ", "10    \nproperly,  may  cause  environmental  problems.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework (Supplementary Appendix C) was prepared to guide the screening of subprojects \nunder  components  C  and  D,  taking  into  account  both  ADB  and  Government  safeguard \nrequirements. An IEE will be prepared in accordance with the environmental assessment and \nreview framework for each such scheme screened as category B, and will identify potential \nenvironmental concerns and recommend appropriate mitigation and monitoring measures. The \nIEE will be prepared by the local government concerned, and reviewed and approved by the \nrelevant DENR office as per environment regulations of the Government. Provision has been \nmade for budgetary support to the participating municipalities for undertaking environmental \nmonitoring for the activities under components C and D over 5 years. Provision has also been \nmade  for  capacity  building  of  regional  and  municipal  government  staff  in  environmental \nmanagement and monitoring through training courses to be conducted during the first year of \nproject implementation.  \n40.  Social Safeguards and Indigenous People. The Project will require small plots of land \nfor  the  construction  of  social  and  environmental  facilities,  which  will  be  obtained  through \nallocation of available unoccupied public land, and purchases in the open market. Since the \nland acquisition will not entail exercising the right of eminent domain, such acquisition will not \ninvolve ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy.7 Infrastructure proposals will be identified during \nparticipatory formulation of the ICRM plan, which the regional steering committee (para. 52) and \nDENR will approve; this will trigger a feasibility study. The regional steering committee will \nreview  the  feasibility  study  for  technical  and  economic  viability,  and  compliance  with  the \nselection  criteria.  Committee  approval  will  be  conditional  on  the  municipality  providing \nunoccupied public land or purchasing the land at market rate, if additional land is required. The \nMunicipal Development Fund Office (para. 59) will enter into an agreement with the municipality \nfor financing the infrastructure once these conditions are fulfilled and documentary evidence \nsubmitted.  Documents  will  establish  plot  location,  ownership,  cost,  and  tenure  status;  and \nguarantees that land purchases are not forced upon the sellers and public land plots are \nunoccupied.   \n41.  Resource management activities such as establishment of no-take zones8 within MPAs, \ncontrol of destructive fishing, and mangrove and watershed management may have adverse \nimpact on the livelihoods of some people; such impacts will, however, be small and temporary. \nThe impacts will be mitigated through the community-based natural resources management \ncontracts and group-based alternative livelihood enterprises to be supported by the Project \nunder components B and C. The challenge will be to identify people affected and ensure their \nparticipation in these activities. The ICRM plan to be prepared for each municipality under \ncomponent B, in a participatory manner, will identify people affected and ensure their inclusion \nin the mitigation program. They will be given priority for participation in the alternative livelihood \nactivities  under  component  D,  which  will  begin  implementation  in  year  1  of  the  Project. \nResource  access  restriction  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  including  implementation \narrangements are given in Appendix 9. \n42.  Available information suggests that the Project will not cover or affect any area inhabited \nby indigenous people. If such groups of people are identified as being significantly affected by \nthe Project in any municipalities, then indigenous peoples\u2019 development plans will be prepared \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s indigenous peoples policy,9 and implementation of project activities in \nthese municipalities will be conditional on ADB\u2019s approval of the relevant indigenous peoples\u2019 \ndevelopment plans. \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1995.

Financing Plan \n44.  The Government has requested a loan of $33.80 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The interest and other \ncharges during implementation will be capitalized. The Government has provided ADB with (i) \nthe reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n45.  On behalf of the Government, ADB asked GEF to provide grant financing for the Project, \nand GEF approved a grant of $9.0 million on 1 December 2006. The grant, to be administered \nby ADB, will cover costs of activities related to conservation and management of biological \ndiversity.   \n46.  Activities related to social and environmental infrastructure under component D are \ndevolved  functions  of  municipalities;  costs  for  these  activities,  estimated  at  $13.20  million \nequivalent including contingencies, will be partly borne by the participating municipalities in \naccordance with the applicable terms and conditions of the National Government and Local \nGovernment Unit Cost-Sharing Policy (Appendix 11). The Government\u2019s financial support to the \nmunicipalities will be a mix of loan and grant, which will complement equity contributions from \nthe municipalities and beneficiaries. In addition, the municipal governments and beneficiaries \nwill finance $7.36 million as part of the costs under components B and C for activities related to \nparticipatory law enforcement, and biodiversity conservation. \n \n ", "12    \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n                         \nSource  Total  Percent \nAsian Development Bank  33.80  54.2 \nGlobal Environment Facility  9.00  14.4 \nCentral Government  8.71  14.0 \nLocal Governments and Beneficiaries  10.81  17.4   \n    Total  62.32  100.0 \nSources: Asian Development Bank and the Government \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n47.  DENR, as the Executing Agency, will be responsible for overall project management. \nThe project implementing agencies are as follows: \n(i)  policy  and  institutional  strengthening  and  development  component:  DA  and \nDENR; \n(ii)  ICRM and biodiversity conservation component: DA and DENR;   \n(iii)  enterprise development and income diversification component: DA and DENR; \nand \n(iv)  social  and  environmental  services  and  facilities  component:  municipal \ngovernments. \nDA and DENR will implement components (i) to (iii) with the active participation of municipal \ngovernments.  \n48.  DENR will execute and implement the Project through its existing central, regional, and \nprovincial organization. The Foreign-Assisted and Special Projects Office at the DENR central \noffice  will  be  the  project  management  office  (PMO).  Working  under  the  guidance  of  the \nsecretary and direct supervision of the assistant secretary for foreign-assisted projects, the \nPMO will be responsible for overall planning, programming, budgeting, operations, monitoring, \nand management of the Project. As an implementing agency, DENR will be responsible for \ninitiating activities related to rationalizing ICRM policies; developing regulation and coordination \nframeworks; developing national, regional, and municipal human resources; establishing marine \nprotected areas; undertaking targeted research on biodiversity conservation and management; \ndeveloping and implementing an ecocertification mechanism; and rehabilitating and managing \nmangroves and watersheds. DENR will implement these activities drawing technical support \nfrom its relevant specialized bureaus and offices at headquarters, including the Coastal and \nMarine  Management  Office,  Protected  Areas  and  Wildlife  Bureau,  and  Environmental \nManagement Bureau. Field implementation will be carried out through coastal and marine \nmanagement divisions located at the DENR regional offices in regions II, III, V, VII, and XI; \nprovincial environment and natural resources offices; and community environment and natural \nresources offices (subprovincial). \n49.  DA will be responsible, in collaboration with DENR and participating municipalities, for \nundertaking participatory and scientific resource assessment and developing a database on \nliving aquatic resources in coastal waters; undertaking studies on conservation of traded and \nthreatened marine species; enhancing habitat and stock; and identifying and promoting viable ", "  13     \nalternative livelihoods for fisherfolk. DA will provide technical support to DENR in relevant policy \nstudies including studies on resource rents and user fees as applicable to fishery activities and \ninitiatives to harmonize conflicting jurisdiction between national agencies involved in ICRM. DA \nwill provide these services through the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and its \nregional offices in the five project regions. The Office of the Assistant Director for Technical \nServices (central office of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources) will be responsible \nfor planning, implementing, and monitoring DA activities and act as the DA focal point for the \nProject. \n50.  The five ICRM centers under component B will be established at or attached to existing \nmarine science institutions. Two potential institutions of international repute are the University of \nthe Philippines\u2019 Marine Science Institute and Silliman University; one or both of these institutions \nwill be selected for project participation. DENR will sign a memorandum of agreement with the \nselected  institution(s)  incorporating  the  institution\u2019s  functions  and  responsibilities  and  the \nfinancial and other support the Project will provide. The institutions will, in coordination with \nDENR, select a local university or college in each of the five project regions to host an ICRM \ncenter. \n51.  The  municipal  governments  will  be  directly  responsible  for  selection,  design,  and \nimplementation of the infrastructure supports and facilities under component D. DENR and DA \nwill  engage  project  municipalities  in  participatory  resource  assessment,  establishment  and \nmanagement of marine protected areas, enforcement of laws and regulations, and identification \nand promotion of alternative livelihoods. The municipal engineering office will be the designated \nmunicipal project unit for infrastructure development, while the municipal agriculture office will \nbe the designated municipal project unit for activities related to resource management and \nbiodiversity conservation. These offices will undertake the activities in coordination with the \nfisheries  and  aquatic  resources  management  committees,  marine  watch  teams,  and  other \nrelevant people\u2019s organizations in the municipality.  \n52.  DENR will establish a project steering committee (PSC) to oversee and coordinate \nproject implementation. The PSC will be chaired by the secretary, DENR (or his/her authorized \nrepresentative);  and  comprise  senior  officials  of  DA  and  the  departments  of  budget \nmanagement,  interior  and  local  governments,  and  finance,  and  National  Economic  and \nDevelopment Authority. Municipal and provincial governments will be invited to attend meetings \non issues that require their participation. DENR will establish a regional steering committee in \neach of the region II, III and VII to oversee and coordinate project implementation within the \nregion,  and  to  review  and  approve  municipal  ICRM  plans  including  subprojects  under \ncomponent D. The committee will comprise representatives of concerned regional agencies and \ninstitutions and participating local governments. The provinces of Davao Oriental and Masbate \nbeing far away from respective regional headquarters, DENR will establish a provincial steering \ncommittees in these two provinces performing the tasks similar to that of regional steering \ncommittees. The project organization chart is given in Appendix 12.  \n2.  Implementation Period \n53.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years, commencing in early 2007. A summary \nproject implementation schedule is given in Appendix 13.   \n3.  Procurement \n54.  Goods and services financed partly or wholly by ADB and GEF will be procured in \naccordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Equipment  to  be  procured  under  the \nProject will consist primarily of office, laboratory and training equipment, motorbikes, utility \n ", "14    \nvehicles, and motorized boats. Contract packages exceeding $500,000 will be awarded on the \nbasis  of  international  competitive  bidding.  Each  contract  costing  between  $100,000  and \n$500,000 will be awarded through national competitive bidding. Minor equipment and materials \ncosting less than $100,000 will be procured through shopping. A procurement plan is given in \nAppendix 14. \n55.  Most civil works under part D of the Project will be carried out using labor-intensive \ntechnology, with arrangements for cost-sharing by local communities in the form of labor, local \nmaterial,  or  cash.  Such  civil  works  packages  will  be  contracted  out  by  the  LGUs  to  the \ncommunities following the procedures for community participation in procurement as provided in \nADB's Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time), with a contract \nceiling of $10,000. Civil works packages not exceeding $100,000 will be awarded on the basis \nof shopping. Civil works packages more than $100,000 will be awarded on the basis of national \ncompetitive bidding. No civil works package is estimated to exceed $150,000. \n4.  Consulting Services \n56.  The Project will require an estimated 369 person-months of consulting services: 51 \nperson-months international and 318 person-months national. Fields of expertise and outline \nterms of reference are given in Appendix 15. All consultants except the enterprise development \nspecialist will be selected and engaged as a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). In selecting the firm, the quality- \nand cost-based selection method will be used and the shortlisted firms will be required to submit \nfull technical proposals. Provision has been made for one enterprise development specialist \n(national) with expertise in private sector development and different in nature from the rest of \nthe consultant team, all of whom will work on coastal resources management. The enterprise \ndevelopment specialist will, therefore, be selected as an individual consultant. The Government \nhas agreed to recruit the individual consultant in accordance with ADB\u2019s procedure for recruiting \nindividual  consultant.  The  Project  also  provides  for  conducting  special  studies  under \ncomponents A and B, and for preparing detailed subproject proposals under component D; the \ncost will range from $2,500 to $25,000 per assignment. Competitive bidding will not be cost-\neffective for these very small size assignments, which will be contracted out to local firms \nfollowing the single-source selection procedure.  \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n57.  ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy10 was explained to and discussed with the Government and \nDENR. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy are included in the loan regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB and GEF in \nconnection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of DENR and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n58.  The project design and implementation arrangements provide for mitigating corruption \nrisks. Risks associated with project management, including procurement and disbursement, will \nbe mitigated by using national, regional, and field participatory management, and improving \ntransparency and accountability. The cost-sharing arrangement will motivate local governments \nto strive for economy and efficiency in project implementation, and avoid corrupt practices. Most \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1998. Anticorruption (as amended to date). Manila. ", "  15     \nsocial  and  environmental  infrastructure  and  facilities  will  be  developed  by  beneficiary \ncommunities ensuring better use of the allocated funds. In addition, performance of DA, DENR, \nand local governments will be monitored against the ecogovernance index (para. 37).  \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n59.  For  activities  to  be  implemented  by  DA  and  DENR,  the  ADB  loan  and  GEF  grant \nproceeds  will  be  provided  through  budgetary  allocation to  these  agencies.  Activities  to  be \nimplemented by municipal governments will be jointly financed by the national Government, \nmunicipality concerned, and local communities. ADB loan proceeds and national Government \nsupport for activities to be directly implemented by municipalities will be disbursed through the \nMunicipal Development Fund Office (MDFO) of the Department of Finance as a mix of loan and \ngrant.  \n60.  The  Department  of  Finance  will  establish  three  imprest accounts:  two  accounts  for \nDENR (one each for the ADB loan and GEF grant), and one for MDFO (for the ADB loan). The \naccounts will facilitate timely release of funds for making payments, particularly for expenditures \nunder small contracts. DENR and MDFO will operate and maintain the imprest accounts in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The advance to the imprest accounts \nwill be limited to 10% of the allocations of DENR and MDFO components financed by the ADB \nloan  and  10%  of  the  grant  for  the  components  financed  by  GEF,  or  6  months  projected \nexpenditure of the respective components, whichever is less. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure \nprocedure will be followed to liquidate funds advanced to the imprest accounts and will apply to \ncontracts not exceeding $100,000.  \n61.  An assessment of the financial management capability of DENR and the implementing \nagencies and specific arrangements for managing project funds are given in Appendix 16. \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n62.  All  agencies  involved  in  project  implementation  will  maintain  separate  accounts \nexclusively  for  project-related  disbursements.  The  PMO  will  review  and  consolidate  these \naccounts and have them audited annually in accordance with sound auditing practices by the \nsovereign audit agency of the Government or other auditors acceptable to ADB. The audit \nreport will include a statement verifying whether or not the funds disbursed by ADB were used \nfor the purpose for which they were provided. The report will include the auditor's opinion on the \nuse of imprest account and statement of expenditure procedure. Copies of the audited accounts \nand auditor\u2019s report will be submitted to ADB within 9 months after the end of each fiscal year. \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n63.  A project performance management system (PPMS) will be established at national and \nregional DENR operations. The Foreign-Assisted and Special Projects Office will be responsible \nfor developing and operating the PPMS with information provided by the PMO and regional \noffices concerned. The PPMS will encompass the following elements: (i) monitoring of physical \nand financial progress, as well as the economy and efficiency in achieving major activities; (ii) \nmonitoring of the level and adequacy of participation of various stakeholders in planning and \nimplementing  project  activities,  and  the  performance  of  DENR  and  implementing  agencies \nagainst the ecogovernance index; (iii) collection of gender-disaggregated data in benchmark \nsurveys and policy and legal studies; (iv) monitoring of the Project\u2019s social, environmental, \nbiodiversity conservation, and economic impacts, including the establishment of benchmark \ninformation and data; and (v) development of a mechanism for making necessary adjustments \nin project design and implementation arrangements in light of the PPMS findings.  \n ", "16    \n64.  Consistent with the GEF operational strategy, biodiversity monitoring will pay special \nattention to species selection, current occurrence, density, and other demographic parameters, \nincluding yield studies, regeneration surveys, and actual impacts of harvesting. The Project will \ncoordinate with GEF in designing the monitoring and evaluation of biodiversity. The five ICRM \ncenters will oversee the monitoring and evaluation program. The Project will also coordinate \nwith  the  European  Union-financed  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  Biodiversity \nConservation  Center,  Philippines,  to  draw  on  their  experience  in  developing  a  biodiversity \ninformation monitoring system.  \n65.  The PPMS will provide for baseline, midterm, and completion surveys; and train staff on \nthe proper monitoring of field activities for ICRM and biodiversity, alternative livelihoods, and \nsocial and environmental infrastructure. PPMS findings will be incorporated in quarterly project \nprogress reports to be prepared by the PMO within 3 weeks of the end of the reporting period \nand submitted to ADB and Government oversight agencies and local governments concerned. \nThe Project will establish a website, in English and Tagalog, for wider dissemination of project \ninitiatives and achievements, and to provide a feedback mechanism. The website will draw upon \nthe municipal coastal and MPA databases, and will serve as a depository for ICRM-related \nreports and publications. \n9.  Project Review \n66.  In addition to regular monitoring, the project performance will be reviewed at least twice \na year jointly by ADB and the Government. The review will assess implementation performance \nand achievement of project outcomes and objectives, review financial progress, identify issues \nand constraints affecting the Project, and work out a time-bound action plan for their resolution. \nIn 2009, ADB and the Government will undertake a midterm review of the Project to assess the \nimplementation status; review the project parameters; and take appropriate measures including \nmodification of scope and implementation arrangements, and reallocation of loan and grant \nproceeds,  as  appropriate,  in  light  of  implementation  experience,  to  achieve  the  project \nobjectives.  \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Environmental, Social, and Poverty Reduction Benefits \n67.  The Project will directly address threats to coral reefs, sea-grass beds, mangroves, and \nbeaches\u2014the major coastal ecosystems. These independent ecosystems perform a wide range \nof biological and physical functions that underline their environmental, biological, and economic \nimportance. Ensuring their protection is vital to arresting declining fish catch and a potential \ncollapse of coastal fisheries. At project completion, the fish catch outside the no-take zones of \nthe project-supported 50 MPAs is expected to increase by 10% over the baseline; hard coral \ncover in the 50,000 ha reef areas to increase by 10%; density of the 5,000 ha of mangroves to \nbe  brought  under  improved  management  practices  to  improve  by  20%;  and  incidence  of \ndestructive fishing in the coastal waters of 68 municipalities to be reduced by 50%. Other \nimmediate benefits from the protection of these marine and coastal ecosystems are prevention \nof coastal erosion and saline water intrusion into the coastal aquifer, and natural assimilation \nand treatment of coastal wastes. \n68.  A major environmental benefit of the Project is protection of the globally significant \nbiological diversity of Philippine waters. The 50 MPAs in the priority marine biodiversity corridors \nwill form a network of reefs and associated coastal ecosystems that harbor unique flagship \nspecies  and  contribute  to  conservation  and  management  of  important  marine  and  coastal \nspecies, including humpback whales, thresher sharks, whale sharks, manta rays, banded sea ", "  17     \nsnakes,  dolphins,  and  olive  ridley  and  hawksbill  sea  turtles.  Illegal  commercial  poaching, \noverfishing, and destructive fishing being practiced in the MPAs will be eliminated or reduced, \nand the rich biological diversity conserved. \n69.  Mechanisms  and  strategies  for  beneficiary  community  participation,  such  as  IEC \ncampaigns, community organization and training, and credit access and enterprise development \ntraining, will help transform coastal communities into responsible resource users and managers. \nIEC  and  extension  programs  will  result  in  behavioral  changes  in  coastal  communities, \nparticularly in the use of coastal resources, and bring about improvements in reef health. \n70.  By improving coastal fisheries resources and generating opportunities, the Project will \naddress two of the root causes of rural poverty in the Philippines as identified in ADB's Poverty \nAssessment for the Philippines (2004): (i) weak performance of the agriculture sector, and (ii) \nlow employment-generation capacity of the economy. The decline in coral productivity and \nrelated fisheries resources, estimated at 2% per annum, has been directly affecting the real \nincomes of fisherfolk. The gains from the ICRM component will mostly be within the municipal \nwaters of the 15 km zone, primarily the domain of small fisherfolk and off-limits to commercial \nfishing  under  the  Fisheries  Code  of  1998.  Community  enforcement  of  regulations  mainly \nthrough fisherfolk, most of whom are poor, will ensure that the majority of the project gains in \nterms of fish catch accrue to the poor. Additionally, the improved state of coastal waters will \nenhance  ecotourism  potential/values,  which  will  generate  employment  opportunities  in  the \ncommunities,  as  experienced  under  similar  ongoing  projects.  Employment  will  also  be \ngenerated through community-driven watershed and mangrove rehabilitation. \n71.  Improvements in water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management will improve the \ngeneral health and living environment of disadvantaged coastal communities, and enhance their \nproductive capacity contributing to overall economic development in the area. Infrastructure \nconstruction will be undertaken through community contracts that will generate employment \nopportunities for the local population.  \n72.  Enterprise development activities will lead to improved skills for fisherfolk, enabling them \nto establish enterprises or seek better employment opportunities. The alternative livelihood and \nenterprise  schemes  will  relieve  pressure  on  coastal  resources,  thus  preventing  their \ndeterioration. Detailed assessments of potential and demand were undertaken in six sample \nmunicipalities,  which  led  to  identification  of  12  representative  livelihood/microenterprise \nactivities. Incremental annual incomes net of labor costs from these enterprises are estimated in \nthe range of P8,700\u2013P98,000. The anticipated returns to labor are P200/day\u2013P610/day, which \nis 1.68%\u20135.08% of the daily average wage rate of P120/day. \n73.  Improved  management  of  coastal  resources  together  with  alternative  livelihood  and \nenterprise schemes will benefit about 10,000 fisherfolk families, with an average 10% increase \nin real household income. The poverty impact analysis in the sample municipalities indicates \nthat about 71% of the net economic gains will accrue to the poor. With 76% of the population in \ncoastal communities living below the poverty line, 61% of whom are employed in fishing, the \nProject will have a major impact in combating poverty and improving income distribution in the \nproject area.    \nB.  Policy Impact and Institutional Benefits \n74.  The  establishment  of  an  institutional  framework  for  ICRM  will  remove  current \ndeficiencies in national and regional ICRM coordination. A comprehensive ICRM policy will \naddress weaknesses and legal gaps, and promote greater involvement of local governments in \ndeveloping  and  managing  local  resources.  Strengthened  national,  regional,  and  local \n ", "18    \ninstitutional  capacity  will  facilitate  a  participatory  approach  to  resource  management,  and \nenhance transparency and accountability in management decisions. Strengthened community \norganizations  such  as  marine  watch  teams  will  be  more  effective  in  enforcing  laws  and \nregulation  in  municipal  waters.  The  participatory  approach,  including  the  cost-sharing \narrangement  between  national  and  local  governments,  will  enhance  local  ownership  and \nsustainability of benefits.   \nC.  Economic Benefits \n75.  The economic benefits of the Project will be derived from four major sources: (i) coral \nreef  management  and  conservation,  (ii)  mangrove  rehabilitation  and  management, \n(iii) watershed rehabilitation and management, and (iv) livelihood and enterprise development. \nThe quantifiable benefits from coastal habitat (reef and mangrove) can be grouped as follows: \n(i) fishery values: the net value of sustainably managed commercial reef and mangrove fishery; \n(ii)  local  uses:  marketed  and  nonmarketed  uses  from  reefs  and  mangroves  that  are  not \nassociated with the commercial fishery, for example aquarium trade, gleaning of coral reef flats, \nsmall-scale capture fishery, and hunting in mangroves, etc.; (iii) erosion control and waste \nmanagement: coral reefs and sea grass acting as barriers to destructive wave actions on \ncoastlines, and mangroves protecting coastal zones against destructive typhoons and tidal \nwaves, and managing wastes through assimilation; and (iv) global use values: sustainable \nexport of live fish, international tourism, and aesthetic and biodiversity values of reefs.  \n76.  An economic analysis was undertaken for the Project taking into account expected \nquantifiable  benefits  from  these  four  sources  of  benefits.  Valuation  of  benefits  and  the \nmethodology for the analysis is given in Appendix 17. The anticipated economic internal rate of \nreturn of the Project is estimated at 16.1%; it is not sensitive to cost overruns or incremental \nbenefit shortfalls. \n77.  Financial analyses were carried out for 12 representative livelihood/enterprise schemes; \neach scheme is financially viable with financial internal rate of return values between 70% and \n200%. The sensitivity analysis shows that enterprises are not very sensitive to output prices or \nproduction costs. Evaluation of benefits and the methodology of the financial and economic \nanalyses are given in Appendix 17. Details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix F. \nD.  Sustainability \n78.  The  participatory  principle  underpinning  the  project  design  and  its  financing \narrangements will help develop a sense of ownership among various stakeholders\u2500particularly \nlocal governments and communities\u2500and this, in turn, will enhance the Project\u2019s sustainability. \nRationalization  of  sector  policy  providing  greater  management  responsibility  to  local \ngovernments for foreshore areas and MPAs will enhance sustainability of project initiatives. \nNational, regional, and municipal institutional weakness will be addressed; and government \nstaff, local communities, and NGOs will be strengthened to assume their responsibilities.  \n79.  Analysis of the current budget and expenditure patterns for project municipalities shows \nthat on average, the annual counterpart funding requirements for project activities during project \nimplementation would be about 2% of the revenues and 8% of the development expenditures of \nan average fourth class municipality\u2500the majority group among project municipalities. During \nthe postproject period, the annual funding requirements to support recurring costs for project \ninitiatives,  including  operation  and  maintenance  of  infrastructure  facilities,  will  be  1%  of \nmunicipal revenues and 6% of the present development expenditures. Assuming that current \ntrends  in  funding  are  maintained,  municipal  governments  will  have  sufficient  resources  to \nsustain the Project\u2019s impact. ", "  19     \n80.  The  capacity  of  municipal  governments  for  sustainable  financing  of  ICRM  will  be \naugmented  by  developing  appropriate  policy  for  user  fees  and  resource  rents  for  MPA, \nmangroves, coral reefs, beaches, foreshore fisheries, and mariculture. The Project provides for \nundertaking  relevant  policy  studies,  formulating  recommendations,  and  pilot  testing  the \nrecommendations in five municipalities. Successful models will be supported at least in one third \nof the municipalities during the Project.  \nE.  Risks \n81.  Risks that may affect project implementation, constrain attainment of objectives, and \nultimately  impact  project  success  include  (i)  degradation  of  the  global  environment  and \nmacroeconomic  conditions,  (ii)  lack  of  political  will  to  support  the  ICRMP,  (iii)  institutional \nweaknesses, (iv) peace and order situation, and (v) governance and anticorruption. \n82.  Degradation of Global Environment. Global and regional environment conditions (e.g., \nclimate change, disease outbreaks, and coral bleaching) could undermine project gains in \nresource management and biodiversity conservation. In addition, populations of some severely \ndepleted species in high biodiversity sites may not be restored through project interventions. \nThe project design provides for countermeasures to address this risk. High biodiversity sites \nhave been selected from various biogeographic regions throughout the Philippines; they are \nexpected to respond differently or not be exposed to the same regional or global conditions. The \nProject  will  focus  on  several  different  threatened  species  and  habitats,  and  promote  the \nestablishment of networks or corridors of MPAs to ensure that the risks are dispersed.  \n83.  Institutional Weaknesses. DENR does not have an adequate number of qualified staff \nfor the sector, and the existing moratorium on creating new regular positions may affect project \nimplementation. DENR will address the issue by redeploying staff, enhancing their skills through \nin-house  training,  and  hiring  contractual  staff.  Provision  is  made  in  the  project  design  for \nenhancing national, regional, and local staff skills, and hiring contractual staff. Moreover, in \ndesigning the implementation arrangements, care has been taken to mainstream the project \nfunctions and responsibilities into the existing organizational structure of DENR rather than \nestablish  new  national  and  regional  project  management  units  exclusively  for  the  Project. \nInstitutional  weaknesses  will  be  further  mitigated  by  DENR  sharing  the  implementation \nresponsibility with DA and municipal government and academic institutions. \n84.  Political Commitment. Since the early 1990s, the national Government has shown \nincreasing commitment to marine and coastal resources management. Continued Government \ncommitment  to  the  sector  is  reiterated  in  the  Presidential  Executive  Order  533  adopting \nintegrated coastal management as a national strategy (para. 20). Local governments are also \ntaking increasing initiatives to  manage their coastal resources, and actively participated in \nproject preparation. However, changes in local leadership during project implementation may \naffect emphasis on the sector. This risk will be mitigated through municipal council resolutions \nand memorandums of agreement between DENR and MDFO providing binding commitments \ncovering the project period. \n85.  Breakdown of Peace and Order. The 68 municipalities selected for the Project do not \ncurrently have serious peace and order problems. If a problem develops in an area, the PSC \ncould decide, in consultation with ADB, to redirect efforts and staff to a more secure area within \nthe province. \n86.  Poor Governance. Good governance assumes an important dimension in the Project \nbecause its successful project implementation will require stakeholders concerned at various \nlevels to agree and adjust to the policy and governance regime changes promoted by the \n ", "20    \nProject. Most of the stakeholders have been receptive to these changes; some may be slow in \nresponding to the needs for change during project implementation. The risk will be mitigated by \nthe emphasis on IEC campaigns to be conducted throughout the project period.  \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n87.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and DENR have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Adequate budget will be provided for the project activities, and funds will be \nreleased regularly throughout the project period. \n \n(ii)  An adequate number of qualified staff at national, regional, and provincial level \nwill be made available for the Project throughout its implementation. \n \n(iii)  Each participating municipality will enter into an implementation agreement with \nthe national Government on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB, including \nthe  commitment  of  the  municipality  to  provide  the  recurring  expenditures  of \ncoastal  resources  management  during  and  after  project  completion.  Each \nmunicipality  that  is  to  obtain  financing  for  component  D  will  enter  into  an \nagreement  with  the  national  Government  to  provide  the  required  equity \ncontribution in cash or kind. \n \n(iv)  MDFO  or  its  successor  will  disburse  eligible  loan  and  grant  funds  to  the \nparticipating municipalities upon their fulfillment of the requirements.   \n \n(v)  The gender action plan prepared for the Project will be fully implemented in a \ntimely  manner,  and  adequate  resources  will  be  allocated  for  the  purpose. \nGender-related indicators will be collected and included in the PPMS. \n \n(vi)  Project  implementing  agencies  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement (footnote 7) and ensure that land acquired under the Project is \neither unoccupied public land or has been paid for in cash, and will not involve \nvoluntary land donation. The evidence of such transaction will be kept on record \nduring project implementation. \n \n(vii)  People who may be adversely affected by the resource access restrictions and \ndiscipline  will  be  identified,  and  potential  impacts  on  their  incomes  will  be \nmitigated  through  their  inclusion  in  the  project-supported,  community-based \nresource management and enterprise development and income-diversification \nactivities. Identities of those affected and the proposed mitigation measures will \nform part of an ICRM plan to be prepared for each municipality and approved by \nDENR  prior  to  imposition  of  resource  access  restrictions.  Implementation  of \nmitigation measures will commence prior to imposition of restrictions and will be \nmonitored under the PPMS. \n \n(viii)  If  the  presence  of  indigenous  people  is  identified  in  any  of  the  project \nmunicipalities and who may be significantly affected, an indigenous peoples\u2019 \ndevelopment  plan  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \nindigenous peoples (footnote 9). Implementation of the project activities at such \nsites shall be conditional on ADB\u2019s approval of the relevant indigenous peoples\u2019 \ndevelopment plan. \n ", "  21     \n(ix)  The project facilities will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in \ncompliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations of the Borrower, \nand ADB\u2019s Environment Policy.11 An IEE will be prepared for each subproject \nand  all  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  activities  specified  in  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  will  be  implemented  and  monitored  to  a \nsatisfactory standard. \n \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n88.  The following are the conditions for loan effectiveness: \n \n(i)  A PSC will be established to oversee and coordinate project implementation. \n \n(ii)  A memorandum of agreement between DA and DENR stipulating their respective \nfunctions and responsibilities in project implementation and the fund flow and \ncoordination mechanism will be signed \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n89.

Declining Resources \n1.  Coral Reefs. Coral reefs provide food, livelihood, recreational and tourism opportunities, \nerosion protection, and extremely high biodiversity. Of the 25,000 square kilometers (km2) of \ncoral reefs in the Philippines, less than 5% are still in excellent condition. Destructive fishing and \ncoral mining are the most prevalent problems. Other major threats include sedimentation and \ncoastal development. Coral reefs are the habitat of about 90% of the fish caught by coastal \nfishers; their degradation results in a rapid decrease of fisheries production in coastal areas. \nWhile nationwide decline in coral reef continues, conservation efforts initiated over the last \ndecade or so are showing improvements at some sites, particularly in the Visayas region.  \n2.  Mangroves. Mangrove coverage decreased from around 4,500 km2 in 1918 to only \nabout 1, 380 km2 in the 1990s. Satellite image analyses indicate that Mindanao has the most \nremaining mangrove areas in the country (29% of the country\u2019s total), while Luzon and Mindoro \nhave the least. Old growth mangrove forests are to be found only in Palawan (5,317 ha) and \nMindanao  (4,582  hectares).  The  rapid  loss  of  mangrove  cover  has  exacerbated  shoreline \nerosion, led to destruction of natural habitats for demersal fish and shrimp, increased the \noccurrence of saline water intrusion into freshwater aquifers, and affected the livelihood of \ncoastal fishers.  \n3.  Fisheries Resources. Various scientific studies demonstrate that Philippine fisheries \nhad exceeded maximum sustainable yields by 1987. The average fish catch per unit effort for \ncoral reef fisheries is now less than 2 kilograms/day, down from as much 20 kilograms/day 30 \nyears ago. Total production has been static for the last 10 years despite the increased number \nand  tonnage  of  commercial  vessels  and  increased  number  of  municipal  fishers.  Catch \ncomposition is changing to lower value species and economic revenues are declining. Much of \nthe declining fisheries productivity can be attributed to overharvesting, destructive fishing, and \nloss of habitats. Excess capacity in the fishing industry, increasing population, and poverty put \nadditional pressure on resources. Poverty forces people to use destructive methods to meet \ntheir immediate needs, which result in a cycle of resource depletion and continuing poverty. \nB.  Impacts on Biodiversity \n4.  The  current  status  of  resources  has  adversely  affected  the  coastal  and  marine \nbiodiversity of the Philippines, which is of global importance (Table A1). \nC.  Impacts on Coastal Population \n5.  Of  the  1  million  coastal  fisherfolk,  69%  are  engaged  in  municipal  fishing,  25%  in \naquaculture, and 6% in commercial fisheries. Municipal fisherfolk are among the poorest in the \nPhilippines, with an average family income that is half the national average. With open access \nto the sea, an increasing number of subsistence fisherfolk compete with each other for fisheries \nresources that declined dramatically over the years. Consequently, the incidence of poverty \namong municipal fisherfolk is on the rise.  \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nTable A1: Threatened Marine Species and their Habitat Requirements \n \nSpecies  Habitat Requirements \nReptiles   \n     Sea turtles (all species)  Coral reefs, sea-grass beds, beaches, and near-\nshore waters \n     Sea snakes (all species)  Fringing coral reefs, midwater reefs \nMammals   \n     Sea cow (dugong)  Sea-grass beds, bays with reefs \n     Dolphins (all species)  Open water areas and midwater reefs \n     Whales and porpoises (all species)  Open water areas \nFish   \n     Whale sharks (1 species)  Open water and midwater reefs \n     Manta rays (all species)  Open water and coral reefs \n     Milkfish (1 species)  Estuaries, coral reefs, and open water areas \nCrabs   \n     Coconut crabs (Birgus latro)  Beach areas \nMolluscs   \n     Giant clams (7 species)  Coral reefs, sea-grass beds, and sandy areas \n     Giant triton shell (Charonia tritonis)  Coral reefs \n     Helmet shell (Cassis spp.)  Coral reefs \n     Kapis shell (Placuna placenta)  Coral reefs, sandy areas \nCorals   \n     Stony and precious corals (all species  Estuaries, reefs, and mudflats \nBirds   \n     Seabirds  Coral reefs \n     Water birds (5 species inc. 1 extirpated)  Remote, oceanic islets without human disturbance \nand predators; rocks; and cliffs \n     Shorebirds (5 species)  Coastal ecosystems; mangroves, ponds, lagoons \nSources:  World  Bank.  Philippines  Environment  Monitor  2005;  DENR  2001;  and  International  \nConservation Union Red Data List 2004. \n \nD.  Factors Affecting Coastal Resources \n6.  Factors directly affecting coastal resources include (i) unsustainable use of resources \n(overfishing and use of destructive methods and gear), (ii) habitat (mangrove and coral reef) \nloss, (iii) coastal pollution, (iv) erosion and sedimentation, and (v) unplanned foreshore and \nshoreline developments. Factors (i) and (ii) are discussed in paras. 1\u20133; discussion of factors \n(iii)\u2013(v) follows. \n7.  Pollution. Coastal ecosystems are threatened by nutrient loading or eutrophication. \nNutrients  come  from  industrial,  commercial,  agricultural,  and  domestic  wastewater  runoff \ncarrying  organic  wastes  and  fertilizer  residue.  Nutrients  enhance  the  growth  of  algae \n(sometimes causing red tides) and bacteria, resulting in the reduction of light and oxygen in \ncoastal waters. Most coastal ecosystems near urbanized areas have been affected by nutrient \nloading, and agricultural runoff is becoming a growing source of pollution in coastal waters.  \n8.  Erosion and Sedimentation. Industrial logging, combined with lack of proper forest \nmanagement  has  resulted  in  the  loss  of  nearly  80%  of  the  Philippines\u2019  original  forests. \nAgricultural  activities  are  practiced  on  steep  slopes,  and  contour  farming  and  other  soil \nconservation practices are not widely utilized. Poor management practices lead to soil erosion \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nand increased flooding, which in turn causes higher costs of coastal infrastructure maintenance, \nrisks to lives, and damage to aquatic habitats. \n9.  Foreshore and Shoreline Areas. Approximately 70% of the municipalities and 25 of the \nlargest cities in the Philippines are located in the coastal zone. The country\u2019s foreshore (the land \nstrip between high and low tides) and shoreline areas are mainly used for settlements and \nhousing. The proliferation of coastal dwellers, who have no rights over the land they occupy and \noften have no basic facilities for sanitation, solid waste management, sewerage, and water \nsupply, contribute to the degradation and deterioration of the coastal environment.    \n10.  These factors affecting coastal resource decline and degradation can be linked to issues \nsuch as weak law enforcement and legal gaps, national and local institutional weaknesses, lack \nof stakeholder awareness and participation in resource management, poverty among coastal \ncommunities, and lack of a holistic approach to resource management. \n11.  Weak  Law  Enforcement  and  Legal  Gaps.  A  common  issue  with  respect  to  the \nPhilippines coastal resources management is poor compliance with laws and regulations. This \nis  partly  because  of  inconsistencies  in  policy  documents  developed  over  time  and  across \nsectors. Jurisdictional overlaps result when two or more laws govern different uses of a coastal \nresource.  Moreover,  the  local  application  of  these  laws  is  affected  by  the  local  legislative \nmandate  of  the  local  government  units,  which  have  broad  management  functions  and \nprerogatives under the Local Government Code. A discussion of some of the major gaps and \ninconsistencies in existing laws and regulations to deal with coastal resources management \nissues follows.  \n12.  The  law  governing  mangrove  resources  presently  consists  of  general  provisions \ncontained in the Revised Forestry Code enacted in 1975 and the Fisheries Code of 1998. At \npresent,  the  conversion,  alienation,  and  disposition  of  mangroves  are  prohibited  under \nprevailing laws, and those released for fishpond development but remain unutilized or were \nabandoned are required to be reverted to the public domain. The process for reversion to the \npublic domain is usually a contentious issue among the Department of Environment and Natural \nResources  (DENR),  Bureau  of  Fisheries  and  Aquatic  Resources  of  the  Department  of \nAgriculture (DA), and the fishpond lessee. \n13.  Laws governing the foreshore are among the most archaic in the Philippines. They are \nalso among the most scattered, spread across several different codes, including the Spanish \nLaw of Waters of 1866, Civil Code, Public Land Act, Water Code, Fisheries Code, and Local \nGovernment  Code.  Although  the  local  government  units  have  ample  powers  for  land \nclassification, zoning, and regulation of all businesses and structures within their territorial \njurisdiction,  overlapping  mandates  with  DENR  and  the  Bureau  of  Fisheries  and  Aquatic \nResources result in very little actual regulation. No definitive coastal land-use policy is in place \nto provide guidance as to the proper allocation of roles and responsibilities, as well as definite \npriorities for how coastal areas should be used. \n14.  Institutional Weaknesses. DENR and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, \nthe two key national agencies with responsibility for integrated coastal resources management, \nare short of qualified staff for the sector. Both the agencies have ongoing programs for staff \nredeployment and training to overcome these shortages. In addition, contractual staff have been \nrecruited to meet immediate requirements. \n15.  The  Local  Government  Code  of  1991  devolved  some  of  the  coastal  resources \nmanagement functions and responsibilities to local governments. Local government capacity to \ncarry out the responsibility has only recently begun to mature as a direct result of increasing ", "  Appendix 2  29 \nawareness  of  the  socioeconomic  importance  of  coastal  resources.  However,  most  local \ngovernments  lack  financial  and  technical  resources  to  ensure  sustainable  management  of \nresources. \n16.  Public Awareness. Since the early 1990s, various initiatives undertaken for coastal \nresources  management  with  bilateral  and  multilateral  assistance  have  been  successful  in \ncreating awareness among coastal communities and other local stakeholders on the importance \nof sustainable use and conservation of coastal resources. However, still much needs to be done \nand a large number of coastal municipalities have not yet received any such support.  \n17.  Holistic  Approach  to  Coastal  Resources  Management.  The  decline  of  coastal \nresources has been caused by a complex set of threats, with their origin spanning the nearest \nwatershed divide to the sea.

Poverty incidence in the coastal community \nis extremely high at 76%, compared with the general level of 41.8% in the target provinces and 34.2 \nnationwide. \n \nSocial infrastructure is limited in most coastal areas. Some 28% of households do not have toilets. Access \nto potable water for some is only through dug shallow wells (18%), artesian wells (2%), water vendors \n(1%), or springs (1%). Garbage disposal is primarily through burning, followed by indiscriminate dumping \nin vacant lots or one\u2019s own backyard. Less than 5% of households report that their garbage is collected \nthrough a municipal solid waste collection system. \n \nWomen in coastal communities are more disadvantaged compared with their male counterparts. The \nprevailing gender division of labor, together with traditional practices in coastal communities, limits and \nhinders women\u2019s access and control of community resources and optimization of their skills and potential \nfor coastal fisheries development and resource management.

Introduction \n1.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) was conducted taking into consideration the \nnature of the project components and types of specific interventions proposed under each \ncomponent. Due to the extensive and varied geographic scope of the Project, the IEE was not \ncarried out on a site-specific basis, but rather on the type of intervention and potential impacts, \nregardless of site. A summary of impacts and mitigation measures (including a monitoring plan) \nfor activities with some adverse impacts are identified and described in the IEE (Supplementary \nAppendix B).  \nB.  Description of the Project \n2.  The  Project  will  consist  of  four  components:  component  A:  policy  and  institutional \nstrengthening and development; component B: integrated coastal resource management and \nbiodiversity conservation; component C: enterprise development and income diversification; and \ncomponent D: social and environmental services and facilities. Environmental assessment was \nconducted for components C and D, while environmental safeguard consideration was included \nin components A and B.  \n3.  The livelihood enterprises will be small-scale with investments ranging from P10,000 to \nP150,000. For component D, each drinking water and sanitation schemes will serve about 25 \nhouseholds, and each community centers, daycare centers, add-on class rooms will serve \nabout  100  households.  While  the  improved  management  of  coastal  resources  will  bring \nsignificant environmental benefits, some of the livelihood activities and social and environmental \ninfrastructure, though of small-scale, may have adverse environmental impacts if environmental \nsafeguards are not complied with during their implementation.  \nC.  Description of Environment \n4.  The  project  area  covers  68  municipalities  in  the  provinces  of  Cagayan,  Zambales, \nMasbate,  Cebu,  Siquijor,  and  Davao  Oriental.  The  area  covers  1,800  kilometers  (km)  of \ncoastline representing 10% of the total coastline of the country. Six municipalities were selected \nin these provinces as representative study sites. \n5.  Claveria, Cagayan. Claveria, located on the northwestern portion of the province of \nCagayan, has 12 km of coastline made up of alluvial sand, sparse mangroves, and marginally \ndeveloped coral reefs. The area is hypothesized to have an upwelling condition. Tuna, sailfish, \ndolphins, and sharks are some species that can be caught in the deep waters offshore; lobsters \nand the popular porphyra are harvested nearshore. Beach seining and milkfish fry gathering is \ndone on a seasonal basis. The main environmental issues identified include (i) intrusion of \nforeign fishing fleets, (ii) fish kills due to density of fish cages in Pata river, and (iii) illegal \noccupation of foreshore lands.   \n6.  Masinloc, Zambales. The municipality of Masinloc is bounded by Oyon and Masinloc \nbays. The total length of the coastline is about 42.2 km. Coastal resources include mangroves, \ncoral  reefs,  and  sea  grass.  Within  the  Masinloc\u2013Oyon  bay  area,  260  hectares  (ha)  of \nmangroves are in good condition. Corals located near the cooling water outfall of the coal-fired \npower  plant  were  dead  but  still  standing,  while  those  inside  and  outside  the  nearby  San \nSalvador Fish Sanctuary appeared healthy. Fish biomass was observed to be highest inside \nand near the sanctuary. The area has more than 1,000 municipal fishers and 10 commercial \nfishing boats originating mainly from the Visayas. \n ", "38  Appendix 8 \n7.  The main environmental issues in the municipality include erosion and sedimentation, \npollution from residential areas situated along the coastline, and dust and discharge of cooling \nwater  from  the  power  plant.  Reclamation  was  also  observed,  mainly  for  housing,  and \nunregulated construction of foreshore structures such as revetments. Blast fishing and cyanide \nfishing are considered major threats to fisheries and coral resources.  \n8.  Batuan,  Masbate.  Batuan  is  the  southernmost  municipality  on  Ticao  Island  in  the \nprovince of Masbate. It has 14 barangays, 10 of which are coastal. The municipality has seven \ncoral reef areas, which are in poor to fair condition. The main coastal resource management \nproblems are declining fish catch and poverty, which are attributed to mangrove and coral reef \ndestruction  due  to  illegal  activities  such  as  conversion  and  cutting  for  mangroves,  and \ndestructive fishing and sand quarrying for coral reefs. \n9.  Lazi, Siquijor. The Lazi is one of six municipalities comprising the island province of \nSiquijor. It is located at the southern part of the province bordered on the south by the Mindanao \nSea. The municipality has a 15.59 km shoreline characterized by sandy and rocky beaches and \nlimestone cliffs. The 24,574.96 ha area of municipal waters is three times larger than the land \narea. Mangrove habitat condition is rated fair to good (heavy cutting, fishpond conversions, and \nsome cutting for firewood) and sea-grass condition is rated as good. The overall rating of the \ncoral reef habitat is fair, having a 38.5% coral cover, and relatively high average fish abundance \nof economically important fish species. The main coastal resource issues include damaged \ncoastal habitats, mainly from mangrove conversion, and low fish catch due to illegal fishing. \nRevival of an old limestone quarry may also pose a threat to the coastal environment. \n10.  Daanbantayan,  Cebu.  Daanbantayan  is  on  the  northern  tip  of  Cebu  bordering  the \nVisayan Sea. The municipality has 20 barangays, 15 of which are coastal, and six offshore \nislands with only two inhabited. It has a coastline of 43 km. Daanbantayan is situated in one of \nthe most highly fished areas of the Visayan Sea. Of the 70,000 population, about 17% are \nfishers. Not many mangroves were observed but considerable sea grass was noted and the \ncoral reef is in its incipient stage of development. Thresher sharks, whales, dugongs, sharks, \nrays, and sea turtles are known to inhabit the area. Mangrove clearing, sand and pebble \nquarrying, and illegal occupation of foreshore areas are among the environmental issues in the \narea. Blast fishing is also rampant.  \n11.  Mati, Davao Oriental. Mati is located in the southeastern part of Davao Oriental. The \ncoastal waters comprise (i) Pujada Bay within which is located Balite Bay, (ii) Mayo Bay, and (iii) \ncoastal waters south of Pujada Bay extending to Cape San Agustin. Pujada Bay is a seascape \nunder the national integrated protected areas systems. The uncoordinated development of \naquaculture and agricultural run-off contribute to coastal pollution resulting in occasional red tide \noutbreaks in the area. Weak enforcement of laws and regulations and lack of public awareness \nare other major environmental issues.  \nD.  Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n12.  Components  A  and  B  will  improve  coastal  biodiversity  and  the  environment  in  the \nmedium to long term. Components C and D may have some adverse environmental impacts \nand are discussed in the environmental management plan (EMP) template in Table A8.     \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 8  39 \nTable A8: Summary Matrix of Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \nActivity  Impact/Mitigation Measures \nComponent C   Impacts (construction): Impacts include hazards to navigation and/or access to fishers; \nMariculture   impediments to water circulation and mixing; possible impacts to nearby coral reefs, \n(cage culture,  sea-grass beds, or marine protection areas; water quality  \nseaweed   \nfarming, etc)  Impacts (operation): Impacts from overcrowding, unused fish feeds, dead fish and \n   other chemicals, fish diseases, etc. The positive impacts of the Project during the \noperation/implementation phase are provision of livelihood and employment, relief of \npressure on the fishery and coastal resource in the area, and additional income in the \nform of taxes for the host municipality.  \n \nMitigation Measures (construction): For fish cages ,proper siting to reduce impacts, \nwhich includes selecting locations that will allow adequate mixing and circulation and \nnot impede them, ensuring that criteria for 10% or more concentration of sea cages in \nwater bodies is not exceeded and avoiding areas near coral reefs, sea-grass beds, \nand marine protected areas. \n \nFor seaweed farming, construction and maintenance of seaweed culture structure \nshould cause minimal damage to the bottom habitat (e.g., minimal disturbance during \nconstruction of stakes, adequate spacing of seaweed plants to allow adequate light \npenetration to the bottom, etc.). \n \nMitigation  Measures  (operation):  Maintaining  correct  stock  density,  following  best \nmanagement practices for feed management, efficient dead fish removal, and use of \nnontoxic  chemicals.  For  seaweed  farming,  dead  plants  should  be  removed  and \ndisposed of in an environmentally safe manner in accordance with national and local \ncodes.     \nComponent D  Impacts (construction): Site clearing will result in loss of some vegetative cover in the \n  site. Use of small construction equipment will increase the level of total suspended \nConstruction of  particles, sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides. These impacts will however be small and \nsmall  temporary. Social benefits will accrue as a result of the implementation of these \ninfrastructure  interventions, which would result in positive environmental benefits through improved \nfacilities, such as  well-being of the people. \nday-care   \nfacilities,  Impacts (operation): Solid waste and sanitary wastewater generation. \nclassrooms,   \ncoastal erosion  Mitigation  Measures  (construction):  Follow  environmental  screening  criteria  and \ncontrol  standard design practices.

Monitoring activities will be performed for construction and disposal activities, equipment \nmaintenance activities, water supply systems, mariculture, etc. Cost estimates for component C \nand  D  are  inclusive  of  environmental  mitigation  measures.  The  total  project  cost  includes \nP20,000 per municipality per year for environmental monitoring of project activities, particularly \nfor components C and D. The monitoring activities, indicators, frequencies, responsibilities, ", "  Appendix 8  41 \nbudget,  and  capacity-building  activities  are  detailed  in  the  IEE  and  updated  for  individual \nsubprojects.  \nF.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n15.  At the project feasibility stage, DENR facilitated provincial seminar-workshops in the six \nproject  provinces.  During  the  workshops,  preliminary  findings  and  recommendations  were \npresented,  and  comments  and  suggestions  received  from  the  participants  who  comprised \nprovincial  and  municipal  officials,  representatives  from  the  national  government  agencies, \nnongovernment organizations, people\u2019s organizations, and members of academic institutions. \nDuring appraisal of the Project (10 August\u20137 September 2006), extensive public consultations \nwith stakeholders were held in all project provinces. Meetings were held in Mati, Davao Oriental \n(10 August 2006); Cebu City, Cebu province (14\u201315 August and 7 September 2006); Masbate, \nMasbate  province  (17  August  2006);  Aparri,  Cagayan  province  (22  August  2006);  Subic, \nZambales province (24 August 2006); and Larena, Siquijor province (8 September 2006). The \nstakeholders  included  officials  of  the  participating  local  government  units,  DENR,  and \nDepartment of Agriculture regional offices; provincial government officials; community members; \nand fisherfolk. In all these consultations, the project concept and activities were introduced and \nenvironmental issues were discussed particularly with regard to implementation of mariculture \nand infrastructure subprojects. The environmental safeguard measures proposed for the Project \nwere accepted by all the participants. \nG.  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework \n16.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  was  developed  to  guide  the \ncommunity  environment  and  natural  resource  officer  in  (i)  screening  interventions  through \nspecific environmental checklists for ensuring compliance with environmental categorization, (ii) \npreparing necessary subproject IEEs, EMPs, and monitoring plans; and (iii) meeting safeguard \nrequirements of the Philippine Government and the Asian Development Bank. The detailed \nprocedural requirements are presented in Supplementary Appendix C. \nH.  Conclusion \n17.  The Project is unlikely to cause any adverse environmental impacts because potential \nnegative impacts are mainly during construction and will be temporary, minor, and localized in \nextent and can be mitigated to acceptable levels. According to the findings of the IEE, a detailed \nenvironmental impact assessment for the subprojects is not considered to be warranted. No \ninterventions/activities  are  proposed  that  can  be  considered  as  environmentally  critical  or \nprojected to create significant adverse or negative impacts on the environment. These will be \nensured during project implementation by following the environmental assessment and review \nframework and checklists, and the environmental management and monitoring plan developed \nfor prototype future interventions as specified in the IEE. \n \n \n \n \n ", "42  Appendix 9 \nMITIGATION MEASURES FOR RESOURCE ACCESS RESTRICTION IMPACT  \nA.  Background \n1.  The resource conservation and management initiatives of the Project are likely to affect, \nin the short-term, livelihoods of some people who currently engage in unsustainable practices in \ncoastal  waters  and  watershed  and  mangrove  areas.  Measures  to  mitigate  the  impact  of \nresource  use  discipline  on  people,  who  could  be  affected,  and  the  implementation  and \nmonitoring arrangements are outlined in this appendix. \n B.  Impacts and Measures \n2.   Component B, integrated coastal resources management (ICRM), will promote adoption \nof ICRM practices that may result in various forms of resource access restrictions, such as (i) \nlimited use of no-take zones in marine protected areas, (ii) control of destructive fishing using \ndynamite  and  cyanide,  and  (iii)  limited  use  of  mangroves  and  watersheds  that  will  be \nrehabilitated and managed under the Project. The number and socioeconomic status of people \nwho will be affected by the resource management practices are yet known as the location of no-\ntake zones and scope of unsustainable practices that should be disciplined will be determined \nthrough community processes during the preparation of municipal ICRM plans.  \n3.  Specific measures for mitigating the resource access restrictions and discipline impacts \nand improving incomes and livelihoods of those affected will be prepared and included in the \nICRM plan. All people affected will be equally eligible for mitigation and rehabilitation assistance \nirrespective  of  social  or  economic  standing,  or  any  such  discriminatory  factors.  Mitigation \nmeasures  include  (i)  community-based  watershed  and/or  mangrove  rehabilitation  and \nmanagement contracts under component B, and (ii) alternative livelihood activities developed \nunder  component  C:  enterprise  development  and  income  diversification.  Design  and \nimplementation of the mitigation measures will commence in year 1 of the Project, prior to the \nestablishment  of  no-take  zones,  and  rehabilitation  and  management  of  mangroves  and \nwatersheds; both types of activities commence in years 2 and 3. As a result, people who could \nbe  affected  would  no  longer  need  to  rely  on  unsustainable  practices  and  therefore  the \nanticipated impact of new ICRM practices on them would be relatively minor. Likely impacts, \ncategories  of  potentially  affected  people,  and  proposed  measures,  and  implementation \nresponsibilities are detailed in Table A9. \nC.  Implementation Arrangement \n  1.  Institutional Responsibilities \n4.  The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) will be the Executing \nAgency  for  the  Project.  Mitigation  measures  including  the  livelihood  program  will  be \nimplemented by DENR and Department of Agriculture (DA). DENR and DA will engage project \nmunicipalities in participatory resource assessment, establishment and management of marine \nprotected  areas,  enforcement  of  laws  and  regulations,  and  identification  and  promotion  of \nalternative  livelihoods.  DENR  will  establish  a  project  steering  committee  to  oversee  and \ncoordinate project implementation. DENR will also establish a regional steering committee in \neach of the five project regions to oversee and coordinate project implementation within the \nregion. The project and regional steering committees will also be responsible for compiling \nbaseline data and monitoring data including the inventory of people affected.

Procedures  \n5.  An initial inventory of people affected will be prepared by the municipal government, \nwhich will be verified during ICRM plan preparation, as the site selection of no-take zones and \ndetermination of the unsustainable practices within the watershed and mangrove areas that \nshould be stopped will be done during ICRM plan preparation.  \n6.  In preparing and implementing ICRM plans, the following procedures will be followed: \n(i)  consult  with  various  stakeholders  to  obtain  their  views  on  how  to  avoid  or \nminimize adverse impacts, and identify the needs and preferences of individuals \naffected; \n(ii)  collect socioeconomic data and identify different categories of people affected \nbased on the degree and scale of impacts, with the participation of affected \ncommunities; \n(iii)  formulate  a  time-bound  action  plan  or  schedule  for  ICRM  plan \npreparation/implementation,  procedures  for  grievance  redress  and  monitoring \nand evaluation, and allocation of budget; \n(iv)  prepare an ICRM plan incorporating mitigation measures, translate into local \nlanguages, and present the draft during consultation and public meetings for \ncomments; incorporate comments and suggestions of the affected communities \nin the final ICRM plan; \n(v)  submit the ICRM plan to DENR for review and approval prior to imposition of \nresource  access  restrictions;  copies  of  DENR-approved  ICRM  Plans  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB for review and record; and   \n(vi)  implement the ICRM plan and submit progress reports to ADB as part of the \nmonitoring activities.  \n \n  3.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n7.  The project management office at DENR central office will supervise the preparation and \nimplementation of ICRM plans, and monitor and report on activities that involve the people \naffected. The monitoring and evaluation will form an integral part of the project performance \nmanagement  system  to  be  established  and  supported  by  the  Project,  and  will  focus  on \nsocioeconomic impacts and whether individuals affected are able to restore, and preferably \nimprove upon, their pre-project income and livelihoods. The findings will be consolidated and \nreflected in the regular progress reports for submission to ADB and the Government.  \n \n  4.  Budget \n \n8.  The project budget includes an allocation of $6.2 million for watershed and mangrove \nmanagement contracts of which 85% is to accrue to communities. Allocation for livelihood \nimprovement activities is $6.1 million or 11% of the project base costs.  \n \n \n \n ", " \nSUMMARY COST ESTIMATES  4\n6\nTable A10.1: Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category   \n \n  P million  $ million  % of Total  A\np\n  Local  Foreign    Local  Foreign    Base  p\ne\nItem  Currency  Exchange  Total  Currency Exchange Total  Cost  n\nd\nA.

Introduction \n1.  The financial management assessment focused on (i) the institutional framework in \nwhich the Project is to be implemented; (ii) assessment of the financial management capacity \nand readiness of the project Executing Agency\u2014the Department of Environment and Natural \nResources  (DENR)\u2014and  implementing  agencies;  and  adequacy  of  implementation \narrangements to ensure that loan and grant funds will be utilized effectively for the intended \npurpose. The assessment employed discussions with the relevant national, regional, provincial \nand municipal officials, as well as a review of past Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other \nfunding agencies\u2019 projects implemented by DENR and other implementing agencies.  \nB.  Assessment of DENR and the Implementing Agencies \n2.  DENR, the Executing Agency, will be responsible for overall management of the Project. \nThe project implementing agencies are the Department of Agriculture (DA), DENR, and 68 \nparticipating municipalities. \n3.  DENR has extensive experience in managing externally assisted projects, including \nseveral  ADB-financed  projects.  While  most  of  the  previous  projects  were  completed \nsatisfactorily, DENR performance in recent years was affected by major budget cuts impacting \nproject  implementation.1 DENR  performance  with  financial  management  of  ADB-financed \nprojects has been satisfactory; no major irregularities have been identified. \n4.  DA also has been a major executing and implementing agency of externally assisted \nprojects including 15 investment and program loan projects of ADB. The overall performance \nwith ADB-financed projects has been satisfactory and no major financial irregularities have been \nidentified.  \n5.  Since the Government adopted the Local Government Code in 1991, all funds flow for \nsimilar projects to local government units (LGUs) (municipalities and provinces) are channeled \nthrough the Department of Finance\u2019s Municipal Development Fund Office (MDFO). MDFO has \ndedicated  financial  management  specialists  that  oversee  the  transfer  of  funds  to  local \ngovernments,  fund  utilization,  and  preparation  of  withdrawal  applications.  On  a  number  of \nprojects in the agriculture and social sectors, ADB has worked with MDFO as a conduit for \nchanneling funds to municipal governments; no major irregularities have been reported. \nC.  Funds Flow Arrangements \n6.  The national Government will provide part of the loan and grant proceeds and its own \ncounterpart funds to DENR through budgetary transfers for expenditures to be incurred by \nDENR and DA. Part of the loan proceeds and counterpart funds will be released to MDFO for \ntransfer to participating municipalities as a mix of loan and grant in accordance with the National \nGovernment  and  Local  Government  Unit  Cost-Sharing  Policy  of  2003.  The  funds  flow \narrangements are shown in Figure A16. \n                                                 \n1  To avoid similar budget cuts, approval of future projects by the Government is subject to preparation of a project -\nspecific budget strategy in accordance with the agency\u2019s overall medium-term public sector expenditure program. \nThe funding strategy outlines yearly funding requirements and source of funds, and is approved by the secretary, \nDepartment of Budget Management. A budget strategy for the Integrated Coastal Resources Management Project \nwas approved in September 2006. \n ", "56  Appendix 16 \n7.  DENR will open two separate imprest accounts, one for the ADB loan and one for the \nGlobal Environment Facility grant, in a commercial bank specifically authorized for this purpose \nby the Bangko Sentral ng Plipinas, on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. The imprest \naccounts  will  be  managed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon by the Government and ADB. The advance to be deposited \nto each account will be based on an estimated 6 months of the project expenditure or a \nmaximum of 10% of the ADB loan and Global Environment Facility grant, whichever is lower. \nApplications  to  replenish  the  accounts,  supported  by  appropriate  documentation,  will  be \nsubmitted regularly (preferably monthly, but not more than quarterly) and/or whenever the \naccounts are drawn down by 20% of the initial deposit. The imprest accounts and statements of \nexpenditure will be audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. Similarly, MDFO will open \nand manage an imprest account for channeling ADB loan proceeds to municipal governments.  \n8.  To facilitate project implementation in a devolved environment, DENR may agree to a \n90-day cash advance facility to DA. DENR will ensure that the DA project unit has the capacity \nto manage the fund. DA will submit its 90-day cash requirements to DENR together with its work \nplan and funding requirements. DENR will monitor and control the transfer of the cash advance, \nand monthly replenishment of such cash advances will be required with the submission of \nsatisfactory proof of incurred eligible expenditures.   \nD.   Accounting, Financial Reporting, and Auditing Arrangement \n9.  The  Commission  on  Audit  (COA)  has  developed  a  financial  information  system  for \nforeign-assisted  projects,  which  has  the  following  features:  (i)  application  of  commercial \nmethods of accounting; (ii) a perpetual inventory method; (iii) an improved chart of account and \ncoding system; (iv) clear recording and reporting of accounting data from LGUs to DENR and \nthe implementing agencies; and (v) generation of accurate and timely financial reports that are \nneeded by agency management, oversight agencies, and funding institutions. The financial \ninformation  system  runs  on  a  financial  accounting  software  platform  with  ability  for \ncustomization to suit the needs of any project; it is being used by DENR, DA, and MDFO.  \n10.  MDFO will use electronic National Government Accounting System (e-NGAS), which \nhas the following features: (i) data validation to avoid duplication and redundancy; (ii) electronic \nprocessing, approval of journal entry voucher, recording of transactions in the general journal \nand posting to respective general ledger (GL) and subsidiary ledgers (SL); (iii) inclusion of the \nstandard national government accounting system chart of accounts; (iv) new coding structure; \n(v) inventory costing for supplies and material; (vi) property, plant and equipment monitoring; \n(vii) keeps track of project cost components, thereby promoting transparency and accountability \nover government infrastructures/projects; (viii) ensures reconciliation of GL control accounts \nwith SL accounts; (ix) strengthen internal control function by requiring the maintenance of SLs \nby the accounting unit of the agency; (x) generates monthly or on demand financial statements \nand reports; (xi) public infrastructures/reforestation projects monitoring; (xii) online query on \ndocuments and special reports with option to print. \n11.  Project disbursements to municipalities/LGUs through MDFO will be a mix of loans and \ngrants. The accounting policies and procedures of the MDFO are governed by Department of \nBudget and Management and COA circular 6-87 of 17 August 1987. The circular describes the \naccounting policies and procedures, the chart of accounts, and accounting entries. MDFO \nproduces separate financial reports for each project, accounting for both subloans and grants.   ", "    Appendix 16       57     \nE.  Staffing \n12.  DENR\u2019s Accounting Section comprises qualified accounting graduates and is headed by \na chief accountant. The accounting, disbursement, and record-keeping functions are segregated \nand  independent  of  each  other.  DENR  relies  on  statements  of  expenditure  submitted  by \nimplementing agencies to release funds. DENR does not have sufficient staff to review the \nfinancial  management  arrangements  of  the  implementing  agencies  but  relies  on  COA \nverification and approval of statements of expenditure. To ensure sound financial management, \nnecessary adjustments will be made within the existing staff resources of the DENR Accounting \nSection to establish a unit devoted to the project requirements. Keeping in view the large \nnumber of municipalities receiving support from the Project, additional dedicated accounting \nstaff will be provided at MDFO. \nF.  Reporting and Auditing  \n13.  DA and MDFO will submit standard financial management reports on a quarterly basis to \nDENR. DENR will prepare a consolidated report adding its own financial reports. The reports \nwill be in format acceptable to ADB and will be used for monitoring project progress by the \nimplementing agencies, i.e., DENR, DA, and municipalities. DENR will also prepare annual \nconsolidated project financial statements for the Project. COA will audit and render an opinion \non the DENR financial statements. MDFO will prepare a separate consolidated financial report \n(CFR) which pertains only to the funds that the MDFO will administer and the accounts are with \nMDFO.  The reports will be in format acceptable to ADB and will be used for monitoring of \nproject  progress  by  implementing  agencies  i.e  DENR,  DA,  and  municipalities.

The  Project  will  facilitate  sustainable  management  of  coastal  resources  by \n(i) strengthening the overall policy and legal framework; (ii) building capacities of communities; \ncivil  society  groups;  and  national,  provincial,  and  municipal  government  institutions;  (iii) \nundertaking participatory resource use planning and management, biodiversity conservation, \nand resource enhancement; and (iv) providing social and environmental services and facilities. \nBy reducing the decline in quality and productive capacity of coastal habitat, the Project will lead \nto  direct  and  indirect  economic  benefits  including  improved  fish  catch,  reduced  erosion  in \nforeshore and upland areas, and increased local and global use values.1 The development of \nalternative  and  supplemental  incomes,  through  viable  livelihood  and  microenterprises,  will \nrelieve pressure on the coastal resources. The progressive population management programs \nin the coastal barangays, with education on reproductive health the linkage between population \nand environmental quality, will reduce future population pressure on coastal resources. \nB.  Methodology \n2.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years;  the  economic  life  of  the  project \ninterventions is expected to be 20 years. \n3.  Exchange  Rate  and  Discount  Rate.  For  this  analysis,  the  prevailing  interbank \nexchange rate of P52.2/$1.0 is used. A discount rate of 12% is used to ascertain the net present \nvalue and also as a cutoff point for the economic internal rate of return (EIRR). \n4.  Price Assumptions. Financial benefits and costs are estimated in constant 2006 terms. \nFinancial prices are based on findings of the surveys undertaken during the feasibility study. \nThe analysis uses a domestic price numeraire where the shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) \nis used to adjust the prices of traded commodities to domestic levels. The SERF is assumed to \nbe  1.2,  which  is  the  standard  SERF  for  the Philippines as  indicated  in  the  Government\u2019s \nInvestment  Coordination  Committee\u2019s  Project  Evaluation  Procedures  and  Guidelines.  The \nvalues of coastal resources and products from livelihood activities are taken at the border price \nand their economic values derived by adjusting these with the SERF. To take into account local \nunemployment and underemployment, labor costs are shadow priced at 0.61. \n5.  Natural  Resource  Values.  The  Project  will  undertake  an  integrated  approach  to \nmanaging coastal resources, which will imply a focus on the coastal resources as well as upland \nresources such as watersheds. Literature on valuation of these resources in the Philippines is \nabundant and a detailed discussion is presented in Supplementary Appendix F. The main \nresource values associated with the coral reefs originate from fisheries for local consumption, \nerosion control, local use (tourism with on-site residence), and global use (fisheries for live \nexport, off-site tourism, and aesthetic/biodiversity value). The main benefits from mangroves \ninclude wood use, fisheries, erosion control, waste treatment, recreation, and habitat/refugia \n(biodiversity). As the Government has banned cutting of mangroves, the analysis excludes any \nbenefits expected from wood use. The resource use values for erosion control and waste \ntreatment have not been established for the Philippines; however, the literature shows these \nhave potentially high values. For the purpose of this analysis, the values for erosion control are \nconservatively estimated at 10% and waste treatment at 5% of estimated values for other \ncountries. The wood and soil erosion abatement are primary benefits from the watersheds. \nRecent estimates estimate that 1 hectare of mature plantation can annually prevent loss of 8.58 \n                                                 \n1  Most commonly documented local and global use values include tourism, recreation, and habitat/refugia. \n ", "60  Appendix 17 \ntons of soil,2 which is estimated at  P810/ton in 2006 terms.

During the feasibility study, interviews and focus group discussions \nwere  conducted  with  entrepreneurs  and  key  informants  in  the  study  municipalities,  which \nprovide  the  basis  for  setting  up  enterprise  models  for  the  representative \nlivelihood/microenterprise schemes. The range of representative activities include (i) land-based \n(e.g., production of organic fertilizer, fiber and coir dust, rope and twine, geotextile nets, as well \nas raising of swine); (ii) fishery-related (such as tilapia culture in earthen ponds, salt making, \ndried  seaweed  production,  fish-cage  culture,  and  dried  salted  fish  production;  and  (iii) \nmicroenterprise  (e.g.,  soap  making,  and  mushroom  culture).  The  selection  of  these \nrepresentative enterprises, aside from being financially viable, takes into account the limited \nfinancial, technical, and entrepreneurial capabilities of fisherfolk. \n7.  The models for the enterprises span over 6 years, which provides for an establishment \nperiod of 1 year and an operation period of 5 years. The useful life of the structures such as \nsheds and boats are assumed to be 6 years, while that for tools and other capital investment is \n3 years.  \n8.  The working capital requirement for the enterprises is estimated on the basis of the costs \nrequired for initiating production operation, and depending on the type of the enterprise the \nrequirement is assumed to range between 1 and 3 months. \n C.  Project Benefits \n9.  Project Coverage and Benefit Area. The Project will cover 68 municipalities in six \nprovinces  and  will  build  the  capacity  of  600  national,  regional,  provincial,  and  municipal \ngovernment staff. Additionally, the Project will train more than 1,000 community members and \n                                                 \n2  Estimated value of soil derived through replacement method by Pabuayon, I.

The Project will also \nprovide social and environmental infrastructure in 136 coastal barangays and raise awareness \non  population  management  in  the  68  municipalities.  Moreover,  the  Project  will  facilitate \nestablishment of 680 enterprises to provide alternate and supplemental livelihood, which will \ndirectly benefit 6,800 fisherfolk. \n10.  During  the  feasibility  study,  six  municipalities  were  studied  in  detail  and  sufficient \ninformation  on  the  resources  was  obtained  through  secondary  sources  for  a  seventh \nmunicipality. In absence of detailed information for the remaining municipalities, the analysis \nwas undertaken for seven municipalities with the benefits are based on the resources available \nwithin these municipalities and the overall project costs are taken on a pro rata basis.  \n11.  In the study municipalities, the data available from the municipal coastal databases and \nthe  assessments  undertaken  through  the  feasibility  study  are  used  to  classify  the  coastal \nresources on the basis of their habitat quality/condition.

The Project will establish 50 marine protected areas (MPAs), each of which on average \nwill include a no-take zone of 100 hectares (1 km2), or 5,000 hectares (50 km2) in aggregate. For \nthe purpose of this analysis, the no-take zones are assumed to be coral reef areas of fair habitat \nquality/condition and proportionally divided between the municipalities. Similarly, the Project will \nreforest 2,000 hectares of mangroves and 4,000 hectares of watersheds, and enrich 7,000 \nhectares of existing mangrove plantations and 3,000 hectares of watersheds. For the purpose of \nthis analysis, the livelihood activities and microenterprises are also assumed to be proportionally \ndistributed between the study municipalities. \n13.  Quantified Benefits. In the without-project scenario, the productivity of the coral reefs is \nassumed to decline at a rate of 2% per annum; the historic rate of decline recorded for the \nPhilippines.3 While  the  Project  anticipates  stopping  the  decline  and  significantly  improving \nproductivity, the analysis conservatively assumes that in the with-project scenario, the decline \nrate in coral reef productivity will only be halved in the participating municipalities. In case of \nMPAs, the without-project benefits are assured to follow the pattern for coral reefs in fair \ncondition.  Given that the no-take zones will be a fraction of the municipal waters within each of \nthe municipalities and will be the focus of more intense activities, the productivity gains from the \n                                                 \n3  McAllister, D. E. 1988. Environmental, Economic and Social Costs of Coral Reef Destruction in the Philippines. \nManila.  (Galaxea 7: pp. 161\u2013178). \n ", "62  Appendix 17 \nno-take zones are anticipated to increase at 10% per year or the productivity to triple in 20 \nyears.4 However, the analysis conservatively assumes that productivity will double over 20 \nyears. \n14.  In the case of the mangroves, resource values and productivity are expected to decline \nat a rate of 1.6% per annum, the historic decline rate for the Philippines. With enrichment \nplanting  and  effective  enforcement  of  regulations  through  community  participation,  the \nproductivity of mangroves is anticipated to improve in the participating municipalities. However, \nfor the purpose of this analysis, the annual decline in mangrove productivity is conservatively \nassumed to be reduced to 1.0% in the with-project scenario. In addition, the areas of mangroves \nreestablished with community participation are assumed to reach full productivity by year 5 and \nthereafter productivity will be maintained through continued community management. \n15.  With the ban on logging in the watersheds, in the without-project scenario the soil \nerosion abatement capacity in the partially denuded forest areas is assumed to be maintained. \nIn the with-project scenario, rehabilitation in the form of timber stand improvement is assumed \nto recover the soil erosion abatement capacity by one third over 5 years. For the completely \ndenuded forest areas, soil erosion increases with time; however, in absence of data on the \ntrends in soil erosion, the analysis assumes that erosion levels are steady. In the with-project \nscenario, the reforested watersheds are assumed to reach their full soil erosion abatement \ncapacity by year 5. \n16.  In case of the livelihood activities and microenterprises, the analysis assumes that all \nenterprises will be incremental. While the enterprise development activities are anticipated to \ncontinue beyond project implementation, the analysis conservatively considers only enterprises \nto be established during project implementation. \n17.  Nonquantifiable Benefits. Apart from the benefits discussed in the preceding sections, \na  number  of  benefits  cannot  be  readily  quantified,  e.g.,  (i)  improved  nation-wide  coastal \nresources management resulting from improved policy and legal framework and institutional \nstrengthening  of  Department  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources,  Department  of \nAgriculture\u2019s Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, and municipal local government units; \n(ii) improved coastal resources management in neighboring municipalities resulting from the \ninformation,  education,  and  communication  campaigns  in  the  project  area;  (iii)  improved \nrevenues  for  the  local  government  units  through  introduction  of  user  fees;  (iv)  improved \necological  governance  resulting  from  empowerment  of  coastal  communities  in  resources \nmanagement and project implementation; (v) reduced cost and improved quality of social and \nenvironment-related infrastructure resulting from greater community participation in planning, \ndesign, and construction activities; and (vi) improved community welfare resulting from provision \nof social and environmental services and infrastructure. \nD.  Assessment of Financial Returns from Livelihood Enterprises \n18.  The results of the financial analysis are detailed in Supplementary Appendix F. The \nresults show that the financial rates of return (FIRR) for the enterprises are anticipated to range \nfrom 70% to 200%. Depending on the size of the enterprise, the annual income net of cash and \n                                                 \n4  The benefits from establishing MPAs were first documented by the Silliman University Marine Laboratory at the \nSumilon Island fish sanctuary, which was established in 1974. This initial experiment on coral reef management, \nwhich prohibited all types of fishing activities on a portion of the island over 8 years, allowed researchers to monitor \nand collect data on the regenerative capacity of the reef under an effective management scheme. Observed \nbenefits included (i) improved coral reef substrate condition; (ii) tripling of individual fish abundance per 500 square \nmeters with the most significant increase among fish targeted by fishers; and (iii) substantial increases in yearly fish \ncatch to fishers on the Sumilon Island reef, not in the sanctuary, from about 14 tons/square kilometer/year to \nalmost 36 tons/square kilometer/year or a regeneration rate of about 12%/year (Russ and Alcala 1996). ", "    Appendix 17       63     \nin-kind  costs  ranges  from  P8,500  to  P102,000.  Returns  to  labor,  which  are  calculated  by \ndividing revenue, less all costs except labor, by the amount of labor required, are significantly \nhigher than the minimum wage rate applied in the rural areas for agriculture-related activities. \n19.  Livelihood and microenterprise schemes typically exhibit very high FIRR values (mainly \ndue to low capital investment and production costs relative to high revenues), which in turn are \nhighly volatile to changes in output prices and production cost. This is confirmed by the results \nof the sensitivity analysis conducted on the FIRR values of each livelihood/microenterprise \nscheme. The results of the sensitivity analysis also indicate that the FIRR values of the projects \nare more sensitive to decreases in output price or revenue (i.e., sensitivity indicator ranging \nfrom 1.84 to 4.22) than to increases in costs (i.e., sensitivity indicator ranging from 1.21 to 3.51). \nE.  Assessment of Economic Returns \n20.  Project  Investment  and  Recurrent  Costs.  All  costs  are  in  constant  2006  terms. \nInvestment costs are net of price contingencies, interest during construction, and taxes and \nduties. Foreign cost content of the costs was adjusted by the SERF, while the local component \nwas taken at its full value. While the scope of benefits from the policy aspects, institutional \ndevelopment, capacity building, and community development may not be limited to the project \narea, the analysis takes into account costs of all the project activities. To assess returns to study \nmunicipalities, the costs are derived on a pro rata basis. \n21.  Economic  Worth.  The  economic viability  was  undertaken  based  on  the  calculated \nstream of net incremental costs and quantified benefits attributable to the project activities over \n20 years. The EIRR was assessed for the study municipalities and extrapolated for the Project \nwith the assumption that the study municipalities are representative of the Project as a whole. \nThe EIRR for the study municipalities is estimated at about 16.1% and the economic net present \nvalue at a discount rate of 12% is estimated at P54.9 million. The Project EIRR is also estimated \nat about 16.1% and the economic net present value at P509.8 million. \n22.  Sensitivity of the Project\u2019s anticipated economic worth to critical factors was analyzed \nand the results show that the Project is anticipated to remain economically viable at cost \noverruns of up to 34.5% and reduction in incremental benefits of up to 20.8%. Similarly, the \nProject is anticipated to remain economically viable at shortfalls in incremental fish catch by \n103.0%,  incremental  coral  reef  benefits  by  91.0%,  and  incremental  mangrove  benefits  by \n35.6%. \nF.  Distribution Analysis and Poverty Impact Assessment \n23.  Table A17.3 summarizes the poverty impact analysis and distribution analysis for the \nstudy municipalities. The net economic benefits (difference in net present value of economic \nand financial benefits) are estimated to be about P59.0 million of which 55% are expected to \naccrue directly to the fisherfolk, while another 31% are expected to accrue to the coastal \ncommunities. The gains to the economy accruing from the global use values are estimated at \nP15.9 million, which offset the net resource outflow of P7.5 million from the Government. \nApportioning the gains between the poor and those living above the poverty line within the \nfisherfolk and the coastal communities, and assuming that Government tax revenues will be \nevenly expended among the population, the Project yields a poverty impact ratio of 0.71. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "64  Appendix 17 \nTable A17.3: Poverty Impact and Distribution Analysis of Project Returns \n \n        Distribution of Gains and Losses  \n Financial Economic   Net \n  Coastal  Gov\u2019t and \n Benefit/Cost   Present  Present  Economic  Overall \nFisherfolk Community Economy \nValue a   Value a   Benefit \n Incremental Benefits (P million)                \n Fisheries Value: Legal  71.60 85.92 14.32 14.32  \n Fisheries Value: Illegal  (27.33) (32.79) (5.47) (5.47)  \n Erosion Control: Upland   0.06 0.07 0.01 0.01 \n Erosion Control: Foreshore   40.74 48.89 8.15 8.15 \n Waste Treatment   39.24 47.09 7.85 7.85 \n Local Use Value   10.92 13.10 2.18 2.18 \n Global Use Value   79.34 95.21 15.87   15.87\n Livelihood Enterprises   15.80 18.95 3.16 3.16  \n Incremental Costs (P million)    \n Implementation Costs: Nonlabor   (145.10) (138.96) 6.15   6.15\n Implementation Costs: Labor   (16.21) (8.63) 7.59 7.59  \n   \n Enterprise Investment Costs   (1.97) (2.36) (0.39) (0.39)  \n Enterprise Operating Costs: Nonlabor  (7.10) (8.52) (1.42) (1.42)  \n Enterprise Operating Costs: Labor   (2.58) (1.57) 1.00 1.00  \n Recurrent Costs: Nonlabor   (23.04) (36.71) (13.67)   (13.67)\n Recurrent Costs: Labor   (30.91) (17.24) 13.67 13.67  \n Net Present Value (P million)   3.47 62.48 59.00 32.46 18.19  8.35\n Gains and Losses (P million)   32.46 18.19  8.35 59.00\n Proportion of the Poor (%) b, c   79 76  34\n Net Benefits for the Poor (P million)  25.50 13.75  2.84 42.09\n Poverty Impact Ratio               0.71\n( ) = negative, Gov\u2019t = Government. \na At a discount rate of 12%. \nb Poverty incidence among fisherfolk and coastal communities is based on surveys undertaken by feasibility study. \nc The national poverty incidence as reported by the Philippines Institute of Development Sciences for 2002. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.
