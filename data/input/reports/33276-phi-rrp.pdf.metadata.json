The salient activities of the Project include (i) develop \nan \nintegrated  coastal  resources \nmanagement (ICRM), address policy weaknesses and legal gaps, \nclarify roles of national government agencies concerned and local \ngovernments,  and  address  their  capacity-building  needs;  (ii) \nthe  coastal  zone  of  participating \nassess \nresources \nICRM  plans  and \nmunicipalities;  develop  and \nparticipatory \nlaw  enforcement;  and  develop  ecocertification \nmechanisms for trade in coral-associated species; (iii) implement \nbiodiversity  conservation  in  priority  marine  biodiversity  corridors \nsupported  by  focused  research  on  critical  ecosystems  and \nthreatened  species; \nfisherfolk  develop \n(iv)  help  municipal \nsustainable enterprises and livelihoods, reducing their reliance on \nfishing; and (v) improve water supply, sanitation, and solid waste \nmanagement;  provide  add-on  classrooms  to  existing  schools  for \ndisadvantaged  coastal  communities;  provide  infrastructure  and \nfacilities  for  mitigating  coastal  erosion  and  pollution;  and  support \nan information, education, and communication program on the link \nbetween  population  and  environmental  quality  and  population \nmanagement. \n \nThe Project will be implemented in six priority marine biodiversity \ncorridors  and  ecosystems  covering  68  municipalities  in  the \nprovinces  of  Cagayan,  Cebu,  Davao  Oriental,  Masbate,  Siquijor, \nand Zambales. \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\nThe  coastal  and  marine  resources  of  the  Philippines  are  of \nnational  and  global  importance  because  of  their  rich  biodiversity \nand  valuable  contribution  to  the  economy.  However,  these \nresources  are  declining  and  biodiversity  is  under  threat  due  to \nhuman  activities.  Coral  reefs,  mangroves,  sea  grass,  and  other \nimportant  coastal  habitats  are  under  severe  stress  with \nconsequential decrease in the production of coastal fisheries. The \nresource  depletion  has  affected  the  livelihood  of  fisherfolk;  an \noverwhelming majority live in poverty. \n \nSince the mid-1980s, the Government has implemented a number \nof  coastal  resources  management  programs,  mostly  as  technical \nassistance  from  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  and  some  as \npart  of  major  investment  and  policy  initiatives  in  the  sector. \nInterventions  under  these  programs,  notably  in  marine  protected \nareas,  resulted  in  significant  positive  impacts  on  biophysical \nparameters  such  as  coral  cover,  fish  catch,  and  biodiversity; \npromoted  good  governance  practices  especially  locally  with  the \nparticipation  of  local  communities  in  resource  management  and \nlaw enforcement; and created an awareness among local officials \nand  coastal  communities  of  the  need  for  conservation  and \nprotection of coastal ecosystems. Despite these significant gains, \nthreats  to  the  management  of  coastal  resources  and  marine \nbiodiversity  persist  due  to  a  number  of  complex  factors  including \nlack  of  an  ICRM  approach  to  coastal  zone  planning,  policy  and \ninstitutional  weaknesses,  weak  law  enforcement,  high  poverty \nincidence  among  coastal  fisherfolk,  and  open  access  to  marine \nand coastal resources. \n \nBuilding  on  the  experience  of  past  programs,  the  Project  will \nassist  the  Government  to  adopt  a  holistic  approach  to  coastal \nresources  management \nterrestrial  and  coastal \nintegrating \nenvironments,  strengthening  policy  and  institutional  frameworks, \ndeveloping  local  government  capacity,  and  reducing  pressure  on \ncoastal resources.  \n \nis  enhanced  coastal  resources.  The \nThe  expected \noutcomes  of  the  Project  will  be  sustainable  management  of \ncoastal resources and increased income for coastal communities. \n \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $62.32 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $5.15 million. \n \n\nimpact \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\niii\n\nA loan of $33.80 million from the ordinary capital resources of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility.

Municipal  governments  will  undertake \nall resource management activities through the community-based \nfisheries  and  aquatic  resources  management  councils,  bantay-\ndagats  (marine  watch  teams)  and  other  peoples\u2019  organizations. \nSimilarly, municipal governments will implement most of the social \nand environmental infrastructure and facilities through beneficiary \ncommunities on a cost-sharing basis. \n \nAll  goods  and  related services  financed  under the  loan  and  GEF \ngrant  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time).  \n \nAn  estimated  369  person-months  of  consulting  services, \ncomprising  51  person-months  international  and  318  person-\nmonths national consultants, will be required to assist the national \ngovernment  agencies,  local  governments,  and  local  communities \nin  implementing  the  Project.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(April 2006, as amended from time to time) by Asian Development \nBank and its borrowers. \n \nThe Project will achieve the following major benefits: (i) laws and \nregulations  governing  coastal  resources  management  will  be \nharmonized and interagency coordination will be improved; (ii) an \nICRM  system  will  be  institutionalized  in  68  municipalities;  (iii) \nabout 50 MPAs including about 5,000 hectares (ha) of sanctuary \nareas  will  be  managed  by  local  governments,  with  10%  increase \nin  fish catch  outside  the  protected  areas;  (iv)  about  50,000 ha  of \ncoral reefs will be brought under improved management, with 10% \nimprovement  in  hard  coral  cover;  (v)  7,000  ha  of  existing \nmangroves  will  be  enriched/rehabilitated,  and  2,000  ha  of \nmangrove will be reestablished, with 20% improvement in density; \n(vi) about 3,000 ha in watersheds will be reforested and 4,000 ha \nof  denuded  watershed  will  be  rehabilitated,  contributing  to \nreduction in soil erosion and flash flooding; (vii) incidence of illegal \nfishing  will  be  reduced  by  50%;  (viii)  women\u2019s  participation  in \ncoastal resources management and alternative livelihood activities \nwill  be  significantly  enhanced;  and  (ix)  disadvantaged  coastal \ncommunities will have improved access to safe water, sanitation, \nand community services. \n \nThe poverty impact analysis in the sample municipalities indicates \nthat about 71% of net economic gains will accrue to the poor. With \n76% of coastal residents living below the poverty line and 61% of \nthese employed in fishing, the Project will have a major impact in \ncombating poverty and improving income distribution.    \n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nimplementation  of \n\nthe  Project  will  require \nThe  successful \nstakeholders  to  agree  and  adjust  to  the  policy  and  governance \nregime  changes  promoted  by  the  Project.  While  most  of  the \nstakeholders  have  been  supportive  of  these  changes  during \nproject preparation, some may be slow in responding to the needs \nfor  change  during  project  implementation.  The  risk  will  be \nmitigated  by  the  emphasis  on  public  information  and  capacity- \nbuilding activities conducted throughout the project period. \n  \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan,  and  (ii)  proposed  administration  of  a  grant  provided  by  the  Global  Environment  Facility \n(GEF),  both  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Integrated  Coastal  Resources \nManagement (ICRM) Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nThe Philippines comprises about 7,100 islands (300,000 square kilometers [km2] of land) \n2. \nand has an estimated 36,000 km of coastline extending 2,000 km from north to south. With the \nadoption  of  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Law  of  the  Sea,  Philippine  territorial  waters \ncomprise approximately 2.2 million km2 with a coastal area of 226,000 km2 and oceanic area of \n1.93 million km2. Of the country\u2019s 1,541 municipalities, 832 (or 54%) border the coast. Twenty-\nfive major cities are located on the coast and 62% of the population lives in the coastal zone.  \n\n3. \nThe  marine  and  coastal  areas  of  the  Philippines  support  a  large  area  of  productive \ncoastal  ecosystems  and  habitats  that  include about  25,000  km2  of  coral  reefs,  sea  grass,  and \nalgal beds; 138,000 hectares (ha) of mangroves (reduced from 450,000 ha in 1920); a variety of \nproductive fisheries that provide more than 50% of the animal protein consumed in the country; \nand many beaches and varied coastlines of value for tourism and other development. With 430 \nspecies  of  corals,  2,300  species  of  fishes,  16  species  of  sea  grass,  hundreds  of  seaweed \nspecies,  and  thousands  of  species  of  marine  invertebrates,  the  Philippines  has  one  of  the \nrichest marine and coastal ecosystems in the world. \n\n4. \nBenefits  derived  directly  from  the  coastal  habitats  are  substantial.  Although  not  all \nbenefits are quantified in economic terms, coral reefs alone are currently estimated to contribute \nat  least  $1.06  billion  annually  to  the  economy.  This  estimate  would  be  significantly  more  with \nimproved  coastal  management  efforts.  The  Philippines  is  the  11th  largest  fish  producer  in  the \nworld. Its annual total fisheries yield is estimated to be worth around $2.5 billion, equivalent to \nabout 4.3% of its gross domestic product. Marine capture fisheries account for around 62% of \nthe total annual fisheries yield, while the rest comes from aquaculture and inland fisheries. The \nannual  harvest  of  marine  capture  fisheries  is  around  1.67  million  tons,  worth  $578  million  in \n1994. Municipal fisheries (excluding reef fish) were estimated to yield annual economic benefits \nof $620 million in 2002. The Philippine fishing industry employs more than 1 million people (5% \nof  the  national  labor  force),  with  68%  employed  in  the  municipal  sector  and  28%  in  the \ncommercial and aquaculture sectors.  \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nDemographics and Coastal Poverty \n\n5. \nAbout 1 million coastal residents and their families are directly dependent on coastal and \nmarine resources for sustenance and survival. Surveys in potential project areas indicate that a \ncoastal  household\u2019s  average  annual  income,  is  P56,486.  Based  on  their  source,  employment \nprovides  the  highest  average  (P86,134),  followed  by  farming  (P55,548),  business  (P52,831), \nand  fishing  (P50,310).  Poverty  incidence  in  the  coastal  community  is  extremely  high  at  76%, \ncompared with the general level of 41.8% in the target provinces and 34.2 nationwide. \n\n6. \nSocial  infrastructure  is  limited  in  most  coastal  areas.  Some  28%  of  households  lack \ntoilets.  Access  to  potable  water  for  some  is  through  dug  shallow  wells  (18%),  artesian  wells \n(2%),  water  vendors  (1%),  or  springs  (1%).  Garbage  disposal  is  primarily  by  burning  or \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nindiscriminate  dumping  in  vacant  lots  or  one\u2019s  own  backyard.  Less  than  5%  of  households \nreport that their garbage is collected through a municipal solid waste collection system. \n\n2. \n\nSector Issues  \n\nThe coastal resources sector, although potentially rich and productive, is declining and \n7. \nunder  threat  due  to  human  activities.  Of  the  25,000  km2  of  coral  reefs,  less  than  5%  are  in \nexcellent  condition.  Mangrove  forests  are  declining  at  a  rate  of  2,000  ha/year;  total  coverage \ndecreased from around 4,500 km2 in 1918 to about 1, 380 km2 in the 1990s. Municipal fisheries \nproduction has been declining, and the average reef fish catch per unit effort is now less than 2 \nkilograms (kg)/day, down from as much as 20 kg/day 30 years ago. \n\n8. \nOverfishing,  the  use  of  destructive  fishing  practices,  and  habitat  conversion  have \nadversely  affected  coastal  ecosystems,  threatening  permanent  damage.  Increasing  pollution \nfrom  land-based  activities,  industrial  and  urban  development,  deforestation,  and  soil  erosion \nhave  lowered  water  quality  and  contributed  to  declining  productivity  in  coastal  waters.  Rapid \npopulation growth and increasing concentration of population and economic activities near the \ncoastal zone have added to the mounting pressure on finite coastal resources. \n\n9. \nPolicy and institutional weaknesses also serve as barriers to effective coastal resources \nmanagement. The absence of a comprehensive ICRM policy and an institutional framework for \nits  implementation  has  at  times  resulted  in  conflicting  actions  and  initiatives  by  national \ngovernment agencies and local governments. Some coastal resources management functions, \nnotably  fisheries,  have  been  devolved  to  local  governments  but  other  functions  pertaining  to \nmanagement  of  critical  habitats  such  as  mangroves  and  watersheds,  pollution  and  foreshore \nmanagement, and urban and industrial development in the coastal areas, have been retained by \nvarious  agencies  of  the  national  Government.  Local  governments  lack  technical  knowledge, \nskills,  and  resources  to  successfully  develop  effective  management  regimes  and  harmonize \nvarious  interests  operating  in  the  coastal  area.  In  addition,  lack  of  qualified  staff  prevents  the \nDepartment  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources  (DENR)  and  other  national  agencies \nconcerned  from  assisting  local  governments  in  effectively  carrying  out  coastal  management \nfunctions and properly coordinating with them.  \n\nA common issue in coastal resources management has been the poor compliance with \n10. \nlaws  and  regulations.  This  is  partly  because  of  inconsistencies  in  laws,  regulations,  and \nguidelines  that  were  developed  over  time  and  across  sectors.  Sometimes  the  national \nregulations  and  department  administrative  orders  are  in  conflict  with  the  interest  of  local \ngovernments and their legislative mandate. Moreover, most local governments do not have the \ncapacity or budget to implement the laws under their jurisdiction.   \n\n11. \n\nSector issues and threats to biodiversity are discussed in Appendix 2. \n\n3. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\n12. \nAgencies providing external assistance to the Philippines marine and coastal resources \nsector  include  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  Canadian  International  Development \nAgency,  GEF,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting \nCountries,  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (USAID), and World Bank. ADB has been the lead agency in the sector, providing \nnine loans for $169.5 million for six projects; and 10 project preparatory and advisory technical \nassistance  projects  for  $3.8  million.  The  World  Bank  follows,  providing  loans  for  $115  million. \nExternal assistance to the marine and coastal resources sector is described in Appendix 3.  \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \n\n   \n\nEarlier  ADB-assisted  projects  aimed  at  improving  fisheries  production.  Only  two  ADB \n13. \nprojects  have  direct  relevance  to  the  proposed  Project:  the  Fisheries  Sector  Program 1 and \nFisheries Resources Management Project.2 Most of the other external assistance to the sector \nwas also directed at increasing the efficiency of fishing fleets and developing aquaculture; only a \nfew  programs  and  projects  were  directed  at  marine  and  coastal  resources  management.  The \nnotables  among  the  latter  category  are  the  USAID-financed  Coastal  Resources  Management \nProject, German Government-supported Leyte Island Program for Sustainable Management of \nNatural  Resources,  and  the  World  Bank-financed  Central  Visayas  Regional  Project  and \nCommunity-Based Resource Management Project. \n\n14. \nGEF  has  made  significant  direct  contributions  to  conserving  important  Philippine \nbiodiversity resources, both through regional and country-specific projects. The GEF-supported \nprojects  that  are  directly  or  indirectly  supporting  marine  biodiversity  conservation  include \n(i) Conservation of Priority Protected Area Project, approved in May 1991; (ii) Partnership for the \nEnvironmental Management for the Seas of East Asia, approved in November 1998; (iii) Coastal \nMarine  Biodiversity  Conservation  Project,  approved  in  May  1999;  (iv)  Tubataha  Reef  National \nMarine  Park,  approved  in  March  2000;  (v)  Critical  Ecosystems  Partnership  Fund,  approved  in \nJuly  2000;  (vi)  Bohol  Marine  Triangle,  approved  in  December  2000;  (vii)  Asian  Conservation \nCorporation  and  Asian  Conservation  Foundation,  approved  in  May  2002;  and  (viii)  Marine \nAquaculture Market Transformation Initiative, approved in May 2004. \n\n4. \n\nLessons \n\nits  coastal \n\nresources  management \n\nThe  Government  commenced \n\n15. \ninitiatives, \nimplemented with bilateral and multilateral assistance, in the mid-1980s. Interventions, notably \nin  marine  protected  areas  (MPAs),  resulted  in  significant  positive  impacts  on  biophysical \nparameters  such  as  coral  cover,  fish  catch,  and  biodiversity;  promoted  good  governance \npractices, especially locally with the participation of local communities in resource management \nand law enforcement; and created an awareness among local officials and coastal communities \nof  the  need  for  conservation  and  protection  of  coastal  ecosystems.  About  150  coastal \nmunicipalities  and  cities  have  coastal  resources  management  programs  covering  about  4,000 \nkm  of  coastline,  the  incidence  of  illegal  fishing  has  declined  significantly  in  provinces  with \nmanagement programs, and more than 5,000 coastal resources management practitioners with \nvarious levels of training are now available within the government and nongovernment sectors \nin the country.  \n\n16. \nDespite  these  significant  gains,  threats  to  the  management  of  coastal  resources  still \npersist due to a number of complex factors including lack of an integrated approach to coastal \nzone  planning,  policy  and  institutional  weaknesses,  weak  law  enforcement,  high  poverty \nincidence  among  coastal  fisherfolk,  and  open  access  to  marine  and  coastal  resources.  The \nfollowing important lessons are identified from the implementation of previous programs: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nHolistic approach to coastal resources management. The origin of threats to \ncoastal  areas  spans  from  the  watershed  divide  in  the  mountains  to  the  sea. \nEffective coastal resources management, therefore, should follow an integrated, \nholistic approach that considers interaction among and within resource systems \nas well as interaction between humans and their environment. \nLocal  institutional  strengthening.  Local  governments  need  to  strengthen \ncapacity  to  manage  their  natural  resources,  and  the  national  Government  and \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  1989.

Academic \n\nsector  agencies  concerned  should  assist  them  by  providing  resources,  legal \ninstitutions,  nongovernment \nmandate,  and \norganizations  (NGOs),  and  private \ntechnical \nassistance and training functions in an efficient manner.      \nParticipatory  planning  addressing  local  issues.  Local  government  coastal \nmanagement plans, developed through a community participation process, must \nintegrate a comprehensive set of interventions in the coastal zone, depending on \nthe  issues  and  needs  of  the  municipality.  These  include  municipal  water \ndelineation  and  zoning,  regulations  for  fisheries  and  the  use  of  other  coastal \nresources,  legislation  and  enforcement  of  national  and  local  laws  on  ICRM, \nestablishment of marine sanctuaries, and foreshore and shoreline management.  \nIncome  diversification.  Enterprise  development  and  alternative  livelihoods  for \nfisherfolk  are  essential  to  reduce  pressure  on  coastal  fisheries,  and  should \nprecede  conservation  initiatives.  Economic  interventions  with  private  sector \ninvestment and buy-in are more viable and allow for better and faster technology \ntransfer to village-based partners.  \n\n \n17. \nSpecific lessons from implementation of the Fisheries Sector Program loan (footnote 1) \ninclude (i) policy initiatives should be supported by information, education, and communication \n(IEC) campaigns and provide for adequate preparation of stakeholders; (ii) a process approach \nshould  be  adopted  that  allows  necessary  changes/modifications  to  the  original  design;  (iii) \nproject  implementation  should  involve  local  government  units  (LGUs)  and  provide  for  a \nmechanism  for  determining  and  delineating  responsibilities  between  the  national  Government \nand LGUs; (iv) alternative livelihood programs should provide for adequate social preparation of \nbeneficiaries;  and  (v)  availability  of  capable  local  NGOs  is  often  overestimated  and  this \nconstraint  should  be  considered  in  the  project  design.3 The  implementation  experience  of  the \nrecently  completed  Fisheries  Resources  Management  Project  (footnote  2)  identified  the \nfollowing: (i) capacity-building needs of implementing agencies should be addressed, (ii) LGUs \nshould be directly involved in planning and implementing field activities, (iii) not all municipalities \nhave  capable  NGOs  to  help  with  project  implementation,  and  (iv)  livelihood  development \nactivities should precede the implementation of conservation programs.  \n\nIn addition, major lessons from various GEF-, USAID-, and World Bank-assisted projects \n18. \nin  the  country  and  region  are  (i)  projects  should  have  a  broad  stakeholder  focus  in  planning, \ncapacity building, and implementation; (ii) management plans should be flexible and adaptive to \nbuild  on  monitoring  and  research  findings;  (iii)  projects  should  have  a  practical  and  simple \napproach  involving  proven  and  tested  tools/activities;  (iv)  project  design  should  emphasize \ninstitutional  and  financial  sustainability  of  conservation  and  management  initiatives;  and  (v) \nlinkages with similar ongoing projects should be built in the project design. \n\n5. \n\nGovernment Policy and Strategy for Coastal Resources Management \n\n19. \nThe  Government  recognizes  the  problems  of  (i)  extensive  poverty  in  the  coastal \ncommunity, (ii) degradation of natural resources, (iii) unbalanced use of aquatic resources, and \n(iv) increasing population concentration in coastal zones. In 2003, the Government drafted, with \nUnited  Nations  Development  Programme  assistance,  ArcDev:  A  Framework  for  Sustainable \nPhilippine Archipelagic Development, which articulates a common vision and unified strategy for \ncoastal  and  marine  resources  development.  The  salient  aspects  of  the  framework  are  (i) \npromotion of archipelagic integration that recognizes the interaction of land, sea, air, and people \nin  an  archipelagic  setting;  (ii) meaningful  and  responsive  participation  of  all  stakeholders  in \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n \n\n   \n\nplanning  and  implementing  an  integrated  ocean  management  policy;  (iii)  conservation, \nprotection, and use of marine resources and marine environment for the benefit of present and \nfuture  generations;  and  (iv) sustainable  development  of  coastal  resources  for  economic \ndevelopment  in  the  coastal  region  and  well-being  of  coastal  people.  A  draft  policy  on  coastal \nresources  management,  prepared  with  USAID  assistance,  needs  to  be  finalized  through  a \nconsultative  process  taking  into  account  recent  developments,  particularly  the  emphasis  on  a \nholistic  approach  to  resource  management.  The  Medium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan \n2004\u20132010  emphasizes  (i)  participatory  planning,  zoning,  and  standard  setting  in  coastal \nprotection  and  management;  (ii)  delineation  of  coastal  zones  for  protection,  exploration,  and \nutilization;  and  delineation  of  municipal  waters  in  coastal  areas  with  offshore  islands; \n(iii) rehabilitation and management of mangrove and coastal watersheds; and (iv) establishment \nand management of MPAs in cooperation with LGUs.  \n\n20. \nIn  June  2006,  the  President  of  the  Philippines  issued  Executive  Order  533  adopting \nintegrated coastal management as a national strategy to ensure sustainable development of the \ncountry\u2019s  coastal  and  marine  environment  and  resources,  and  establishing  supporting \nmechanisms for its implementation. The order requires DENR to develop a national program on \ncoastal  and  marine  resources  management  following  an  integrated  approach  and  addressing \nrelated policy, institutional, legal, social, and economic issues.   \n\n6. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Objectives and Strategies \n\nADB\u2019s  country  operational  strategy, 4 which  is  closely  aligned  with  the  Government\u2019s \n21. \ndevelopment  objectives,  aims  at  supporting  Government  initiatives  for  improving  fiscal \nresponsibility and revitalizing the economy, improving management of assets, reducing poverty \nand geographical inequalities, protecting the environment, and promoting good governance. In \nthe  agriculture  and  natural  resources  sector,  ADB  will  support  resource  management, \ndevelopment  of  sustainable  enterprises  and  livelihoods,  and  development  of  basic  social \nservices  and  rural  infrastructure.  The  sector  will  focus  on  improving  the  capacity  of  LGUs  for \nthe  capacity  of  community-based \ndevolved  responsibilities,  as  well  as  strengthening \norganizations, NGOs, and local institutions.   \n\n22. \nThe proposed Project belongs to group II of the priority classification of ADB\u2019s Medium-\nTerm Strategy II, and will support environmental management and biodiversity conservation. An \nimportant  element  of  the  Medium-Term  Strategy  II  is  promoting  regional  cooperation  in  the \nmanagement of public goods such as natural resources including marine and coastal resources. \nThe  conservation  and  management  impact  of  priority  biodiversity  corridors  and  marine \necosystems under the Project will go beyond Philippine waters, benefiting other countries in the \nregion.  In  particular,  the  Project  will  be  an important  complementary  activity  to  the  work  being \ndiscussed  with  neighboring  governments  to  support  the  sustainable  development  of  the  Sulu-\nSulawesi Sea ecoregion.      \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nThe  expected  impact  of  the  Project  is  enhanced  coastal  resources.  The  expected \n23. \noutcomes are sustainable management of coastal resources and increased income for coastal \ncommunities.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n\n4   ADB. 2005.

Two  more  areas  of  \u201cvery  high\u201d  to  \u201chigh\u201d  priority  marine  biodiversity  significance \nnear to marine corridors were selected: (i) the Zambales marine ecosystem in the Luzon Sea, \nand  (ii)  the  Siquijor  small-island  marine  ecosystem  between  the  Bohol  Sea  and  Sulu  Sea. \nBiodiversity  significance  and  major  threats  of  these  marine  corridors  and  ecosystems  are \ndescribed in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n\n25.  Within  the  marine  biodiversity  corridor  and  ecosystems  identified,  six  provinces  were \nselected based on the following: (i) strategic location, (ii) status of coastal communities that can \npotentially benefit from the enhanced management of coastal resources, and (iii) willingness of \nprovinces and municipalities to support an ICRM program. The provinces selected are Cagayan, \nCebu, Davao Oriental, Masbate, Siquijor, and Zambales. Sixty-eight municipalities within these \nprovinces were selected and are listed in Appendix 4. \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n26. \nThe  Project  comprises  four  components:  component  A:  policy  and  institutional \nstrengthening and development; component B: ICRM and biodiversity conservation; component \nC:  enterprise  development  and \nincome  diversification,  and  component  D:  social  and \nenvironmental services and facilities. \n\n1. \n\nComponent A: Policy and Institutional Strengthening and Development \n\nThe  component  aims  at  (i)  rationalizing  Government  policy  for  ICRM  and  improving \n27. \ncoordination mechanisms, (ii) strengthening national and local government institutional capacity, \nand  (iii)  developing  a  performance-based  incentive  and  disincentive  system  for  local \ngovernments.  Policy  weaknesses  and  legal  gaps  in  the  management  of  coastal  zones  and \nhabitats  will  be  studied  and  corrective  measures  recommended.  Drawing  on  the  works  under \nthe  previous  United  Nations  Development  Programme  assistance,  and  as  required  under \nExecutive Order 533 on integrated coastal management, the Project will develop an institutional \nframework for national and local government  coordination of ICRM. A comprehensive national \npolicy on ICRM will be finalized and an IEC campaign undertaken. In light of the national policy, \nthe roles of the Department of Agriculture (DA), DENR, local governments, and other national \nGovernment agencies in ICRM and related activities will be clarified. Imposition and collection of \nuser  fees  and  resource  rents  for  MPAs,  mangroves,  coral  reefs,  beaches,  and  foreshores  as \nsustainable means for financing ICRM operations will be studied and operationalized. \n\n28. \nThe  Project  will  support  human  resource  and  institutional  development  of  DA,  DENR, \nand  local  governments.  Capacity-building  needs  of  the  institutions  and  their  human  resources \nwill be assessed and appropriate strategies developed to address these. In view of the present \nmoratorium  on  the  creation  of  new  regular  staff  positions  in  national  government  agencies, \nDENR  will  address  the  present  shortage  of  qualified  staff  in  marine  and  coastal  resources \nmanagement  through  staff  redeployment  and  training.  About  600  DA,  DENR,  and  municipal \ngovernment staff will be trained in various aspects of ICRM including basic practices of coastal \nresources  management, \nresource  enhancement,  social  preparation,  environmental \n                                                 \n5   DENR.  2002.

Multisector local government ICRM organizations, \nincluding  fisheries  and  aquatic  resources  management  committees,  bantay  dagats  (marine \nwatch teams), and NGOs will be developed and strengthened. \n\nThe  Project  will  support  identification  and  dissemination  of  a  performance-based \n29. \nincentive-disincentive  system \nto  DENR\u2019s  coastal  resources \nmanagement  certification  system.  The  system  establishes  performance  benchmarks  for  local \ngovernments.  Viable  material  incentives  will  be  provided  to  the  certificate  recipient  local \ngovernments  to  continue  good  coastal  resources  management  practices.  The  performance-\nbased incentive system will be linked to the ecogovernance index developed under the USAID-\nassisted Ecogovernance Project of DENR.   \n\nthat  builds  on  and \n\nlinks \n\n2. \n\nComponent B: ICRM and Biodiversity Conservation \n\n30. \nThe  component  will  promote  basic  ICRM  practices,  i.e.,  adaptive  planning  and \nbudgeting,  municipal  water  zoning,  law  enforcement,  pollution  control  and  environmental \nmanagement,  resource  use \nforeshores,  beaches,  and \nlicensing,  and  management  of \nmangroves.  Coastal  resources  in  68  municipal  waters  will  be  assessed  through  participatory \nand  scientific  resource  assessment.  Participatory  assessment  will  be  undertaken  for  all  the \ncoastal waters, while scientific assessments will be done in selected sites of high biodiversity; \nthe  results  will  be  reflected  in  the  updated  municipal  coastal  database  and  compiled  in  a \nnational  coastal  resources  database.  ICRM  plans  will  be  developed  and  integrated  into  the \nmunicipal  planning  process.  About  7,000  ha  of  mangroves  will  be  brought  under  improved \nmanagement and about 2,000 ha will be reforested. About 4,000 ha of denuded watersheds will \nbe  reforested  and  3,500  ha  of  forests  in  watersheds  will  be  rehabilitated.  Local  fisheries  and \naquatic resources management committees, marine watch teams, and NGOs will be trained on \nparticipatory  enforcement  mechanisms  for  fisheries  laws  and  regulations,  and  provided  with \nbasic equipment and facilities.  \n\nThe  component  will  protect  and  manage  coastal  ecosystems  in  selected  threatened \n31. \nareas of high biodiversity. Networks of 50 MPAs, comprising about 15\u201320 new MPAs and 30\u201335 \nexisting  MPAs,  will  be  developed  in  the  six  priority  biodiversity  corridors  and  marine \necosystems.  MPA  management  plans  will  be  developed  and/or  strengthened  and  functional \norganizations  will  be  put  in  place.  The  management  plans  will  be  supported  by  targeted \nresearch  on  critical  biodiversity  resources  including  sensitive  ecosystems  and  threatened \nflagship species, and will include species restocking and pilot schemes for coral reef and giant \nclam  transplanting.  Five  ICRM  centers  will  be  established  as  hubs  for  biodiversity  monitoring \nand  research,  and  training  and  demonstration  activities.  The  centers  will  be  located  at  the \nexisting  marine  science  institutions  and  project  support  will  complement  existing  facilities  for \nsimilar activities. ICRM centers will also be the focal points for undertaking an IEC campaign to \nbe  developed  and \nthe \nin  coordination  with \ncommunication,  education,  and  public  awareness  program  of  the  Convention  on  Biodiversity; \noperational links between the two will be examined and specific recommendations made during \nthe initial stage of project implementation.  \n\nthe  ongoing  works  under \n\nimplemented \n\nThe  Project  will  also  support  development  and  implementation  of  a  system  for \n32. \necocertification  of  sustainable  harvesting  activities  in  reef-associated  species,  taking  into \naccount  the  changing  degree  of  vulnerability  of  species;  and  will  link  it  to  the  Project\u2019s \nbiodiversity  monitoring  program.  The  system  will  cover  food  fish  and  ornamental  fish  for  the \naquarium  market.6 The  Project  will  train  about  680  individuals  from  coastal  communities  and \n\n                                                 \n6  In developing an ecocertification system for aquarium market fish, the Project will coordinate with the GEF-assisted \n\nMarine Aquarium Market Transformation Initiative, approved in May 2004. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nparticipating municipality staff in 68 municipalities to regulate and manage the trade of marine \nspecies. \n\n3. \n\nComponent C: Enterprise Development and Income Diversification \n\nThe  component  aims  at  providing  municipal  fisherfolk  with  supplementary  income  and \n33. \nreducing their reliance on fishing by promoting environment-friendly sustainable enterprises and \nlivelihoods.  Technical  and  institutional  support  will  be  provided  to  undertake  viable  livelihoods \nand enterprises identified from similar ongoing programs and other potential ones. Enterprises \nproviding  employment  opportunities  to  about  6,800  people  will  be  developed  during  project \nimplementation.  Priority  will  be  given  to  people  affected  by  the  restricted  use  of  coastal \nresources.  Activities  will  include  (i)  undertaking  social  preparation  including  community \norganization,  needs  and  resource  assessment,  and  savings  mobilization;  (ii) establishing  an \nlivelihoods  and \nenterprise  development  unit \nenterprises,  and  undertaking  feasibility  and  market  studies;  (iii)  establishing  about  370 \nenterprises  in  68  municipalities,  and  training  6,800  fisherfolk  on  technical  and  managerial \naspects  of  enterprises;  (iv)  assisting  community  groups  in  preparing  bankable  business  plans \nand accessing credit facilities of formal banking systems such as Land Bank of the Philippines, \nDevelopment Bank of the Philippines, rural and thrift banks, cooperatives and NGOs, or other \nexisting  and  programmed  credit  facilities  including  the  Isang  Bayan,  Isang  Produkto,  Isang \nMilyong  Piso  programs;  (v)  helping  develop  partnerships  between  coastal  communities  and \nprivate entrepreneurs in enterprise operation, management, and marketing; and (vi) promoting \nand developing ICRM-related ecotourism. In developing livelihoods and enterprises, care will be \ntaken  to  ensure  that  intended  activities  are  aligned  and  connected  with  those  existing  in  the \nproject area.  \n\nidentifying  appropriate \n\nin  each  province, \n\n4. \n\nComponent D: Social and Environmental Services and Facilities \n\n34. \nThis  component  will  address  the  basic  social  services  needs  of  disadvantaged  coastal \ncommunities,  and  support  local  governments\u2019  efforts  to  mitigate  coastal  pollution  and \ndegradation  of  resources.  The  component  will  follow  a  demand-driven  approach,  providing \ntechnical and investment support to participating municipalities for improving water supply and \nsanitation,  managing  solid  waste,  providing  add-on  school  classrooms  and  day-care  centers, \nand  mitigating  coastal  pollution  and  erosion.  Beneficiaries  will  be  trained  on  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  the  completed  subprojects.  The  selection  criteria  for  social  and  environmental \ninfrastructure are given in Appendix 5.  \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n35. \nBiodiversity Conservation with GEF Participation. A key feature of the Project is the \nconservation  of  biodiversity  of  global  importance  with  GEF  involvement.  The  biodiversity \nconservation measures under the Project follow an innovative approach by developing networks \nof MPAs within marine corridors and ecosystems that are recognized as having high biodiversity \nof  global  significance.  By  promoting  protection  of  sites  over  an  extended  area  within  the \ncorridors,  greater  exchange  of  fish  and  larvae  will  result,  improving  chances  of  restoring \nbiodiversity  where  resource  depletion  and  habitat  loss  has  occurred.  By  reducing  gaps  in \nmanagement  coverage  in  the  corridors,  weak  links  in  the  management  chain  will  be  reduced \nand more effective management of entire marine corridors will be supported.  \n\n36. \nPoverty Targeting. The project design includes a combination of measures to maximize \nproject  impact  on  poverty.  The  rural  poverty  incidence  in  the  six  provinces  that  will  receive \nsupport  for  ICRM  ranges  between  25.8%  and  77.0%,  with  a  six-province  average  of  59.0% \ncompared  with  the  national  average  of  48.8%.  Within  the  rural  population,  the  incidence  of \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n \n\n   \n\npoverty is much higher in the coastal communities at 76.0%; the coastal population will be the \nprimary beneficiary of improved coastal resources management supported by the Project. The \ncriteria  for  selection  of  schemes  under  the  social  and  environmental  services  and  facilities \ncomponent will give priority to communities that have a high incidence of poverty. Similarly, the \nincome diversification and enterprise development component will focus on poor disadvantaged \ngroups with little or no access to technology and capital.  \n\n37. \nEnvironmental  Governance  and  Performance  Monitoring.  The  Project  will  support \nimplementation of the ecogovernance index developed by the USAID-assisted Ecogovernance \nProject of DENR, which aims at greater transparency, accountability, and participatory decision-\nmaking  in  the  management  of  natural  resources,  including  marine  and  coastal  resources,  and \nenvironmental  management.  The  index  includes  four  activities  that  represent  the  flow  of \ngovernment  actions  in  resource  management:  planning,  budgeting,  implementation  (including \nprocurement  and  issuance  of  permits  and  licenses),  and  control  or  enforcement  (monitoring, \nreporting, sanctioning, etc.). The index will be applied to measuring performance of DA, DENR, \nand  local  governments  concerned;  Internet  access  will  be  available  through  a  website  to  be \nestablished for the Project.  \n\n38. \nGender  and  Development.  Despite  their  extensive  involvement  in  the  marketing  of \nfisheries  and  other  aquatic  products,  women  are  not  well  represented  in  coastal  resources \nmanagement, or in training, meetings and other related activities. While recognizing the need to \nrespect local values and beliefs, and the choices of both men and women about taking part in \nspecific activities, the Project will promote greater involvement of women in the decision-making \nprocess  of  ICRM.  Specific  activities  include  (i)  national  and  local  gender  sensitization  training \nand collection  of  gender-disaggregated  data  in  household socioeconomic  studies,  biodiversity, \nand  related  ICRM  research  and  policy  and  legal  studies  as  the  basis  for  defining  intervention \nmeasures; (ii) integration of gender analysis in ICRM planning, monitoring, and evaluation; and \n(iii)  conduct  of  gender  and  development  orientation  and  related  training  to  national  and  local \ngovernment  personnel  and  community  members.  The  project  strategy  for  gender  and \ndevelopment is outlined in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy (Appendix 6). The \ngender action plan (Appendix 7) sets a participation target for women of 33% in membership in \nICRM  organizations,  MPA  management  boards  and  self-reliant  groups  for  livelihood;  staff \ntraining in biodiversity and ICRM; and incremental staff recruitment for the Project. \n\n39. \nEnvironmental  Safeguards.  The  project  activities  are  aimed  at,  among  other  things, \nsustainable management of marine and coastal resources and environmental protection, and by \ndesign  are  not  expected  to  create  any  significant  adverse  environmental  impact.  An  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  (Supplementary  Appendix  B)  was  conducted  during  project \npreparation  and  the  findings  are  summarized  in  Appendix  8.  The  IEE  determines  that  most \nactivities  will  contribute  to  environmental  improvement,  and  subprojects  to  be  identified  during \nimplementation  are  likely  to  be  classified  as  B  or  C.  Activities  with  potential  adverse  impact \nrelate to two components: (i) component C: income diversification and enterprise development, \nand  (ii)  component  D:  social  and  environmental  facilities  and  services.  Component  C  may \nsupport development of small-scale mariculture including cage farming, which could have small \nadverse  environmental  impacts.  Such  adverse  impacts  will  be  avoided  or  mitigated  through \nappropriate  siting,  management,  and  monitoring.  Prior  to  the  commencement  of  mariculture, \nfisherfolk  will  be  trained  on  the  technology  and  management  of  mariculture,  including \nenvironmental management. The mariculture operation will be monitored as part of the overall \nresource management plan and environmental problems and issues will be identified, consistent \nwith  the  IEE  for  the  Project,  in  time  for  appropriate  action.  Social  and  environmental  facilities \nunder  component  D  will  include  development  of  rural  water  supply,  public  toilets,  classrooms, \nday-care centers, and small-scale coastal erosion structures\u2014construction of which, if not done \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nproperly,  may  cause  environmental  problems.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework  (Supplementary  Appendix  C)  was  prepared  to  guide  the  screening  of  subprojects \nunder  components  C  and  D,  taking  into  account  both  ADB  and  Government  safeguard \nrequirements.  An  IEE  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  environmental  assessment  and \nreview  framework  for  each  such  scheme  screened  as  category  B,  and  will  identify  potential \nenvironmental concerns and recommend appropriate mitigation and monitoring measures. The \nIEE  will  be  prepared  by  the  local  government  concerned,  and  reviewed  and  approved  by  the \nrelevant  DENR  office  as  per  environment  regulations  of  the  Government.  Provision  has  been \nmade  for  budgetary  support  to  the  participating  municipalities  for  undertaking  environmental \nmonitoring for the activities under components C and D over 5 years. Provision has also been \nmade  for  capacity  building  of  regional  and  municipal  government  staff  in  environmental \nmanagement  and  monitoring  through  training  courses  to  be  conducted  during  the  first  year  of \nproject implementation.  \n\n40. \nSocial Safeguards and Indigenous People. The Project will require small plots of land \nfor  the  construction  of  social  and  environmental  facilities,  which  will  be  obtained  through \nallocation  of  available  unoccupied  public  land,  and  purchases  in  the  open  market.  Since  the \nland  acquisition  will  not entail  exercising  the  right  of  eminent  domain,  such  acquisition  will  not \ninvolve ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy.7 Infrastructure proposals will be identified during \nparticipatory formulation of the ICRM plan, which the regional steering committee (para. 52) and \nDENR  will  approve;  this  will  trigger  a  feasibility  study.  The  regional  steering  committee  will \nreview  the  feasibility  study  for  technical  and  economic  viability,  and  compliance  with  the \nselection  criteria.  Committee  approval  will  be  conditional  on  the  municipality  providing \nunoccupied public land or purchasing the land at market rate, if additional land is required. The \nMunicipal Development Fund Office (para. 59) will enter into an agreement with the municipality \nfor  financing  the  infrastructure  once  these  conditions  are  fulfilled  and  documentary  evidence \nsubmitted.  Documents  will  establish  plot  location,  ownership,  cost,  and  tenure  status;  and \nguarantees  that  land  purchases  are  not  forced  upon  the  sellers  and  public  land  plots  are \nunoccupied.   \n\nResource management activities such as establishment of no-take zones8 within MPAs, \n41. \ncontrol  of  destructive  fishing,  and  mangrove  and  watershed  management  may  have  adverse \nimpact on the livelihoods of some people; such impacts will, however, be small and temporary. \nThe  impacts  will  be  mitigated  through  the  community-based  natural  resources  management \ncontracts  and  group-based  alternative  livelihood  enterprises  to  be  supported  by  the  Project \nunder components B and C. The challenge will be to identify people affected and ensure their \nparticipation  in  these  activities.  The  ICRM  plan  to  be  prepared  for  each  municipality  under \ncomponent B, in a participatory manner, will identify people affected and ensure their inclusion \nin the mitigation program. They will be given priority for participation in the alternative livelihood \nactivities  under  component  D,  which  will  begin  implementation  in  year  1  of  the  Project. \nResource  access  restriction  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  including  implementation \narrangements are given in Appendix 9. \n\n42. \nAvailable information suggests that the Project will not cover or affect any area inhabited \nby indigenous people. If such groups of people are identified as being significantly affected by \nthe Project in any municipalities, then indigenous peoples\u2019 development plans will be prepared \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s indigenous peoples policy,9 and implementation of project activities in \nthese  municipalities  will  be  conditional  on  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  the  relevant  indigenous  peoples\u2019 \ndevelopment plans. \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB. 1995.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  6  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  interest  and  other \ncharges during implementation will be capitalized. The Government has provided ADB  with (i) \nthe reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n\n45. \nOn behalf of the Government, ADB asked GEF to provide grant financing for the Project, \nand GEF approved a grant of $9.0 million on 1 December 2006. The grant, to be administered \nby  ADB,  will  cover  costs  of  activities  related  to  conservation  and  management  of  biological \ndiversity.   \n\nActivities  related  to  social  and  environmental  infrastructure  under  component  D  are \n46. \ndevolved  functions  of  municipalities;  costs  for  these  activities,  estimated  at  $13.20  million \nequivalent  including  contingencies,  will  be  partly  borne  by  the  participating  municipalities  in \naccordance  with  the  applicable  terms  and  conditions  of  the  National  Government  and  Local \nGovernment Unit Cost-Sharing Policy (Appendix 11). The Government\u2019s financial support to the \nmunicipalities will be a mix of loan and grant, which will complement  equity contributions from \nthe  municipalities  and  beneficiaries.  In  addition,  the  municipal  governments  and  beneficiaries \nwill finance $7.36 million as part of the costs under components B and C for activities related to \nparticipatory law enforcement, and biodiversity conservation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGlobal Environment Facility \nCentral Government \nLocal Governments and Beneficiaries \n \nSources: Asian Development Bank and the Government \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \nTotal \n33.80 \n9.00 \n8.71 \n10.81 \n62.32 \n\nPercent \n54.2 \n14.4 \n14.0 \n17.4   \n\n100.0 \n\n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nDENR,  as  the  Executing  Agency,  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project  management. \n\n47. \nThe project implementing agencies are as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\npolicy  and  institutional  strengthening  and  development  component:  DA  and \nDENR; \n\nICRM and biodiversity conservation component: DA and DENR;   \n\nenterprise  development  and  income  diversification  component:  DA  and  DENR; \nand \n\nsocial  and  environmental  services  and \ngovernments. \n\nfacilities  component:  municipal \n\nDA  and  DENR  will  implement  components  (i)  to  (iii)  with  the  active  participation  of  municipal \ngovernments.  \n\n48. \nDENR will execute and implement the Project through its existing central, regional, and \nprovincial organization. The Foreign-Assisted and Special Projects Office at the DENR central \noffice  will  be  the  project  management  office  (PMO).  Working  under  the  guidance  of  the \nsecretary  and  direct  supervision  of  the  assistant  secretary  for  foreign-assisted  projects,  the \nPMO will be responsible for overall planning, programming, budgeting, operations, monitoring, \nand  management  of  the  Project.  As  an  implementing  agency,  DENR  will  be  responsible  for \ninitiating activities related to rationalizing ICRM policies; developing regulation and coordination \nframeworks; developing national, regional, and municipal human resources; establishing marine \nprotected areas; undertaking targeted research on biodiversity conservation and management; \ndeveloping  and  implementing  an  ecocertification  mechanism;  and  rehabilitating  and  managing \nmangroves  and  watersheds.  DENR  will  implement  these  activities  drawing  technical  support \nfrom  its  relevant  specialized  bureaus  and  offices  at  headquarters,  including  the  Coastal  and \nMarine  Management  Office,  Protected  Areas  and  Wildlife  Bureau,  and  Environmental \nManagement  Bureau.  Field  implementation  will  be  carried  out  through  coastal  and  marine \nmanagement  divisions  located  at  the  DENR  regional  offices  in  regions  II,  III,  V,  VII,  and  XI; \nprovincial  environment  and  natural resources  offices; and  community  environment  and  natural \nresources offices (subprovincial). \n\nDA  will  be  responsible,  in  collaboration  with  DENR  and  participating  municipalities,  for \n49. \nundertaking  participatory  and  scientific  resource  assessment  and  developing  a  database  on \nliving  aquatic  resources  in  coastal  waters;  undertaking  studies  on  conservation  of  traded  and \nthreatened  marine  species;  enhancing  habitat  and  stock;  and  identifying  and  promoting  viable \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n \n\n   \n\nalternative livelihoods for fisherfolk. DA will provide technical support to DENR in relevant policy \nstudies including studies on resource rents and user fees as applicable to fishery activities and \ninitiatives to harmonize conflicting jurisdiction between national agencies involved in ICRM. DA \nwill  provide  these  services  through  the  Bureau  of  Fisheries  and  Aquatic  Resources  and  its \nregional  offices  in  the  five  project  regions.  The  Office  of  the  Assistant  Director  for  Technical \nServices (central office of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources) will be responsible \nfor  planning,  implementing,  and  monitoring  DA  activities  and  act  as  the  DA  focal  point  for  the \nProject. \n\n50. \nThe five ICRM centers under component B will be established at or attached to existing \nmarine science institutions. Two potential institutions of international repute are the University of \nthe Philippines\u2019 Marine Science Institute and Silliman University; one or both of these institutions \nwill be selected for project participation. DENR will sign a memorandum of agreement with the \nselected  institution(s)  incorporating  the  institution\u2019s  functions  and  responsibilities  and  the \nfinancial  and  other  support  the  Project  will  provide.  The  institutions  will,  in  coordination  with \nDENR,  select  a  local  university  or  college  in  each  of  the  five  project  regions  to  host  an  ICRM \ncenter. \n\n51. \nThe  municipal  governments  will  be  directly  responsible  for  selection,  design,  and \nimplementation of the infrastructure supports and facilities under component D. DENR and DA \nwill  engage  project  municipalities  in  participatory  resource  assessment,  establishment  and \nmanagement of marine protected areas, enforcement of laws and regulations, and identification \nand promotion of alternative livelihoods. The municipal engineering office will be the designated \nmunicipal  project  unit  for  infrastructure  development,  while  the  municipal  agriculture  office  will \nbe  the  designated  municipal  project  unit  for  activities  related  to  resource  management  and \nbiodiversity  conservation.  These  offices  will  undertake  the  activities  in  coordination  with  the \nfisheries  and  aquatic  resources  management  committees,  marine  watch  teams,  and  other \nrelevant people\u2019s organizations in the municipality.  \n\nDENR  will  establish  a  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  to  oversee  and  coordinate \n52. \nproject implementation. The PSC will be chaired by the secretary, DENR (or his/her authorized \nrepresentative);  and  comprise  senior  officials  of  DA  and  the  departments  of  budget \nmanagement,  interior  and  local  governments,  and  finance,  and  National  Economic  and \nDevelopment Authority. Municipal and provincial governments will be invited to attend meetings \non  issues  that  require  their  participation.  DENR  will  establish  a  regional  steering  committee  in \neach  of  the  region  II,  III  and  VII  to  oversee  and  coordinate  project  implementation  within  the \nregion,  and  to  review  and  approve  municipal  ICRM  plans  including  subprojects  under \ncomponent D. The committee will comprise representatives of concerned regional agencies and \ninstitutions and participating local governments. The provinces of Davao Oriental and Masbate \nbeing far away from respective regional headquarters, DENR will establish a provincial steering \ncommittees  in  these  two  provinces  performing  the  tasks  similar  to  that  of  regional  steering \ncommittees. The project organization chart is given in Appendix 12.  \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years,  commencing  in  early  2007.  A  summary \n\n53. \nproject implementation schedule is given in Appendix 13. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nGoods  and  services  financed  partly  or  wholly  by  ADB  and  GEF  will  be  procured  in \n54. \naccordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Equipment  to  be  procured  under  the \nProject  will  consist  primarily  of  office,  laboratory  and  training  equipment,  motorbikes,  utility \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nvehicles, and motorized boats. Contract packages exceeding $500,000 will be awarded on the \nbasis  of  international  competitive  bidding.  Each  contract  costing  between  $100,000  and \n$500,000 will be awarded through national competitive bidding. Minor equipment and materials \ncosting less than $100,000 will be procured through shopping. A procurement plan is given in \nAppendix 14. \n\n55.  Most  civil  works  under  part  D  of  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  using  labor-intensive \ntechnology, with arrangements for cost-sharing by local communities in the form of labor, local \nmaterial,  or  cash.  Such  civil  works  packages  will  be  contracted  out  by  the  LGUs  to  the \ncommunities following the procedures for community participation in procurement as provided in \nADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (April  2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  with  a  contract \nceiling of $10,000. Civil works packages not exceeding $100,000 will be awarded on the basis \nof shopping. Civil works packages more than $100,000 will be awarded on the basis of national \ncompetitive bidding. No civil works package is estimated to exceed $150,000. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nThe  Project  will  require  an  estimated  369  person-months  of  consulting  services:  51 \n56. \nperson-months  international  and  318  person-months  national.  Fields  of  expertise  and  outline \nterms of reference are given in Appendix 15. All consultants except the enterprise development \nspecialist will be selected and engaged as a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). In selecting the firm, the quality- \nand cost-based selection method will be used and the shortlisted firms will be required to submit \nfull  technical  proposals.  Provision  has  been  made  for  one  enterprise  development  specialist \n(national)  with  expertise  in  private  sector  development  and  different  in  nature  from  the  rest  of \nthe  consultant  team,  all  of  whom  will  work  on  coastal  resources  management.  The  enterprise \ndevelopment specialist will, therefore, be selected as an individual consultant. The Government \nhas agreed to recruit the individual consultant in accordance with ADB\u2019s procedure for recruiting \nindividual  consultant.  The  Project  also  provides  for  conducting  special  studies  under \ncomponents A and B, and for preparing detailed subproject proposals under component D; the \ncost  will  range  from  $2,500  to  $25,000  per  assignment.  Competitive  bidding  will  not  be  cost-\neffective  for  these  very  small  size  assignments,  which  will  be  contracted  out  to  local  firms \nfollowing the single-source selection procedure.  \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s anticorruption policy10 was explained to and discussed with the Government and \n57. \nDENR.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts, \nrelevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the \nbidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  and  GEF  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  will  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  DENR  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n\n58. \nThe  project  design  and  implementation  arrangements  provide  for  mitigating  corruption \nrisks. Risks associated with project management, including procurement and disbursement, will \nbe  mitigated  by  using  national,  regional,  and  field  participatory  management,  and  improving \ntransparency and accountability. The cost-sharing arrangement will motivate local governments \nto strive for economy and efficiency in project implementation, and avoid corrupt practices.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n \n\n   \n\nsocial  and  environmental  infrastructure  and  facilities  will  be  developed  by  beneficiary \ncommunities ensuring better use of the allocated funds. In addition, performance of DA, DENR, \nand local governments will be monitored against the ecogovernance index (para. 37).  \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n59. \nFor  activities  to  be  implemented  by  DA  and  DENR,  the  ADB  loan  and  GEF  grant \nproceeds  will  be  provided  through  budgetary  allocation  to  these  agencies.  Activities  to  be \nimplemented  by  municipal  governments  will  be  jointly  financed  by  the  national  Government, \nmunicipality  concerned,  and  local  communities.  ADB  loan  proceeds  and  national  Government \nsupport for activities to be directly implemented by municipalities will be disbursed through the \nMunicipal Development Fund Office (MDFO) of the Department of Finance as a mix of loan and \ngrant.  \n\n60. \nThe  Department  of  Finance  will  establish  three  imprest  accounts:  two  accounts  for \nDENR (one each for the ADB loan and GEF grant), and one for MDFO (for the ADB loan). The \naccounts will facilitate timely release of funds for making payments, particularly for expenditures \nunder  small  contracts.  DENR  and  MDFO  will  operate  and  maintain  the  imprest  accounts  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  The  advance  to  the  imprest  accounts \nwill be limited to 10% of the allocations of DENR and MDFO components financed by the ADB \nloan  and  10%  of  the  grant  for  the  components  financed  by  GEF,  or  6  months  projected \nexpenditure  of  the  respective  components,  whichever  is  less.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedure will be followed to liquidate funds advanced to the imprest accounts and will apply to \ncontracts not exceeding $100,000.  \n\nAn assessment of the financial management capability of DENR and the implementing \n\n61. \nagencies and specific arrangements for managing project funds are given in Appendix 16. \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n62. \nAll  agencies  involved  in  project  implementation  will  maintain  separate  accounts \nexclusively  for  project-related  disbursements.  The  PMO  will  review  and  consolidate  these \naccounts  and  have  them  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  practices  by  the \nsovereign  audit  agency  of  the  Government  or  other  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audit \nreport will include a statement verifying whether or not the funds disbursed by ADB were used \nfor the purpose for which they were provided. The report will include the auditor's opinion on the \nuse of imprest account and statement of expenditure procedure. Copies of the audited accounts \nand auditor\u2019s report will be submitted to ADB within 9 months after the end of each fiscal year. \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n63. \nA project performance management system (PPMS) will be established at national and \nregional DENR operations. The Foreign-Assisted and Special Projects Office will be responsible \nfor  developing  and  operating  the  PPMS  with  information  provided  by  the  PMO  and  regional \noffices concerned. The PPMS will encompass the following elements: (i) monitoring of physical \nand financial progress, as well as the economy and efficiency in achieving major activities; (ii) \nmonitoring  of  the  level  and  adequacy  of  participation  of  various  stakeholders  in  planning  and \nimplementing  project  activities,  and  the  performance  of  DENR  and  implementing  agencies \nagainst  the  ecogovernance  index;  (iii)  collection  of  gender-disaggregated  data  in  benchmark \nsurveys  and  policy  and  legal  studies;  (iv)  monitoring  of  the  Project\u2019s  social,  environmental, \nbiodiversity  conservation,  and  economic  impacts,  including  the  establishment  of  benchmark \ninformation and data; and (v) development of a mechanism for making necessary adjustments \nin project design and implementation arrangements in light of the PPMS findings.  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\nConsistent  with  the  GEF  operational  strategy,  biodiversity  monitoring  will  pay  special \n64. \nattention to species selection, current occurrence, density, and other demographic parameters, \nincluding yield studies, regeneration surveys, and actual impacts of harvesting. The Project will \ncoordinate with GEF in designing the monitoring and evaluation of biodiversity. The five ICRM \ncenters  will  oversee  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  program.  The  Project  will  also  coordinate \nwith  the  European  Union-financed  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  Biodiversity \nConservation  Center,  Philippines,  to  draw  on  their  experience  in  developing  a  biodiversity \ninformation monitoring system.  \n\n65. \nThe PPMS will provide for baseline, midterm, and completion surveys; and train staff on \nthe  proper  monitoring  of  field  activities  for  ICRM  and  biodiversity,  alternative  livelihoods,  and \nsocial and environmental infrastructure. PPMS findings will be incorporated in quarterly project \nprogress reports to be prepared by the PMO within 3 weeks of the end of the reporting period \nand submitted to ADB and Government oversight agencies and local governments concerned. \nThe Project will establish a website, in English and Tagalog, for wider dissemination of project \ninitiatives and achievements, and to provide a feedback mechanism. The website will draw upon \nthe  municipal  coastal  and  MPA  databases,  and  will  serve  as  a  depository  for  ICRM-related \nreports and publications. \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\nIn addition to regular monitoring, the project performance will be reviewed at least twice \n66. \na year jointly by ADB and the Government. The review will assess implementation performance \nand achievement of project outcomes and objectives, review financial progress, identify issues \nand constraints affecting the Project, and work out a time-bound action plan for their resolution. \nIn 2009, ADB and the Government will undertake a midterm review of the Project to assess the \nimplementation status; review the project parameters; and take appropriate measures including \nmodification  of  scope  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  reallocation  of  loan  and  grant \nproceeds,  as  appropriate,  in  light  of  implementation  experience,  to  achieve  the  project \nobjectives.  \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEnvironmental, Social, and Poverty Reduction Benefits \n\n67. \nThe Project will directly address threats to coral reefs, sea-grass beds, mangroves, and \nbeaches\u2014the major coastal ecosystems. These independent ecosystems perform a wide range \nof biological and physical functions that underline their environmental, biological, and economic \nimportance.  Ensuring  their  protection  is  vital  to  arresting  declining  fish  catch  and  a  potential \ncollapse of coastal fisheries. At project completion, the fish catch outside the no-take zones of \nthe  project-supported  50  MPAs  is  expected  to  increase  by  10%  over  the  baseline;  hard  coral \ncover in the 50,000 ha reef areas to increase by 10%; density of the 5,000 ha of mangroves to \nbe  brought  under  improved  management  practices  to  improve  by  20%;  and  incidence  of \ndestructive  fishing  in  the  coastal  waters  of  68  municipalities  to  be  reduced  by  50%.  Other \nimmediate benefits from the protection of these marine and coastal ecosystems are prevention \nof  coastal  erosion  and  saline  water  intrusion  into  the  coastal  aquifer,  and  natural  assimilation \nand treatment of coastal wastes. \n\n68. \nA  major  environmental  benefit  of  the  Project  is  protection  of  the  globally  significant \nbiological diversity of Philippine waters. The 50 MPAs in the priority marine biodiversity corridors \nwill  form  a  network  of  reefs  and  associated  coastal  ecosystems  that  harbor  unique  flagship \nspecies  and  contribute  to  conservation  and  management  of  important  marine  and  coastal \nspecies,  including  humpback  whales,  thresher  sharks,  whale  sharks,  manta  rays,  banded  sea \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n \n\n   \n\nsnakes,  dolphins,  and  olive  ridley  and  hawksbill  sea  turtles.  Illegal  commercial  poaching, \noverfishing, and destructive fishing being practiced in the MPAs will be eliminated or reduced, \nand the rich biological diversity conserved. \n\n69.  Mechanisms  and  strategies  for  beneficiary  community  participation,  such  as  IEC \ncampaigns, community organization and training, and credit access and enterprise development \ntraining, will help transform coastal communities into responsible resource users and managers. \nIEC  and  extension  programs  will  result  in  behavioral  changes  in  coastal  communities, \nparticularly in the use of coastal resources, and bring about improvements in reef health. \n\n70. \nBy  improving  coastal  fisheries  resources  and  generating  opportunities,  the  Project  will \naddress two of the root causes of rural poverty in the Philippines as identified in ADB's Poverty \nAssessment  for  the  Philippines  (2004):  (i)  weak  performance  of  the  agriculture  sector,  and  (ii) \nlow  employment-generation  capacity  of  the  economy.  The  decline  in  coral  productivity  and \nrelated  fisheries  resources,  estimated  at  2%  per  annum,  has  been  directly  affecting  the  real \nincomes of fisherfolk. The gains from the ICRM component will mostly be within the municipal \nwaters of the 15 km zone, primarily the domain of small fisherfolk and off-limits to commercial \nfishing  under  the  Fisheries  Code  of  1998.  Community  enforcement  of  regulations  mainly \nthrough  fisherfolk,  most  of  whom  are  poor,  will ensure  that the  majority  of  the  project  gains  in \nterms  of  fish  catch  accrue  to  the  poor.  Additionally,  the  improved  state  of  coastal  waters  will \nenhance  ecotourism  potential/values,  which  will  generate  employment  opportunities  in  the \ncommunities,  as  experienced  under  similar  ongoing  projects.  Employment  will  also  be \ngenerated through community-driven watershed and mangrove rehabilitation. \n\n71. \nImprovements in water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management will improve the \ngeneral health and living environment of disadvantaged coastal communities, and enhance their \nproductive  capacity  contributing  to  overall  economic  development  in  the  area.  Infrastructure \nconstruction  will  be  undertaken  through  community  contracts  that  will  generate  employment \nopportunities for the local population.  \n\n72. \nEnterprise development activities will lead to improved skills for fisherfolk, enabling them \nto establish enterprises or seek better employment opportunities. The alternative livelihood and \nenterprise  schemes  will  relieve  pressure  on  coastal  resources, \ntheir \ndeterioration.  Detailed  assessments  of  potential  and  demand  were  undertaken  in  six  sample \nmunicipalities,  which  led  to  identification  of  12  representative  livelihood/microenterprise \nactivities. Incremental annual incomes net of labor costs from these enterprises are estimated in \nthe range of P8,700\u2013P98,000. The anticipated returns to labor are P200/day\u2013P610/day, which \nis 1.68%\u20135.08% of the daily average wage rate of P120/day. \n\nthus  preventing \n\n73. \nImproved  management  of  coastal  resources  together  with  alternative  livelihood  and \nenterprise schemes will benefit about 10,000 fisherfolk families, with an average 10% increase \nin  real  household  income.  The  poverty  impact  analysis  in  the  sample  municipalities  indicates \nthat about 71% of the net economic gains will accrue to the poor. With 76% of the population in \ncoastal  communities  living  below  the  poverty  line,  61%  of  whom  are  employed  in  fishing,  the \nProject will have a major impact in combating poverty and improving income distribution in the \nproject area.    \n\nB. \n\nPolicy Impact and Institutional Benefits \n\n74. \nThe  establishment  of  an  institutional  framework  for  ICRM  will  remove  current \ndeficiencies  in  national  and  regional  ICRM  coordination.  A  comprehensive  ICRM  policy  will \naddress weaknesses and legal gaps, and promote greater involvement of local governments in \nlocal \ndeveloping  and  managing \n\nlocal  resources.  Strengthened  national,  regional,  and \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\ninstitutional  capacity  will  facilitate  a  participatory  approach  to  resource  management,  and \nenhance  transparency  and  accountability  in  management  decisions.  Strengthened  community \norganizations  such  as  marine  watch  teams  will  be  more  effective  in  enforcing  laws  and \nregulation \nthe  cost-sharing \narrangement  between  national  and  local  governments,  will  enhance  local  ownership  and \nsustainability of benefits.   \n\nin  municipal  waters.  The  participatory  approach, \n\nincluding \n\nC. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  will  be  derived  from  four  major  sources:  (i)  coral \n75. \nreef  management  and  conservation, \nrehabilitation  and  management, \n(ii)  mangrove \n(iii) watershed  rehabilitation  and  management,  and  (iv)  livelihood  and  enterprise  development. \nThe quantifiable benefits from coastal habitat (reef and mangrove) can be grouped as follows: \n(i) fishery values: the net value of sustainably managed commercial reef and mangrove fishery; \n(ii)  local  uses:  marketed  and  nonmarketed  uses  from  reefs  and  mangroves  that  are  not \nassociated with the commercial fishery, for example aquarium trade, gleaning of coral reef flats, \nsmall-scale  capture  fishery,  and  hunting  in  mangroves,  etc.;  (iii)  erosion  control  and  waste \nmanagement:  coral  reefs  and  sea  grass  acting  as  barriers  to  destructive  wave  actions  on \ncoastlines,  and  mangroves  protecting  coastal  zones  against  destructive  typhoons  and  tidal \nwaves,  and  managing  wastes  through  assimilation;  and  (iv)  global  use  values:  sustainable \nexport of live fish, international tourism, and aesthetic and biodiversity values of reefs.  \n\n76. \nAn  economic  analysis  was  undertaken  for  the  Project  taking  into  account  expected \nquantifiable  benefits  from  these  four  sources  of  benefits.  Valuation  of  benefits  and  the \nmethodology for the analysis is given in Appendix 17. The anticipated economic internal rate of \nreturn  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  16.1%;  it  is  not  sensitive  to  cost  overruns  or  incremental \nbenefit shortfalls. \n\n77. \nFinancial analyses were carried out for 12 representative livelihood/enterprise schemes; \neach scheme is financially viable with financial internal rate of return values between 70% and \n200%. The sensitivity analysis shows that enterprises are not very sensitive to output prices or \nproduction  costs.  Evaluation  of  benefits  and  the  methodology  of  the  financial  and  economic \nanalyses are given in Appendix 17. Details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix F. \n\nD. \n\nSustainability \n\nThe  participatory  principle  underpinning \n\n78. \nfinancing \narrangements will help develop a sense of ownership among various stakeholders\u2500particularly \nlocal governments and communities\u2500and this, in turn, will enhance the Project\u2019s sustainability. \nRationalization  of  sector  policy  providing  greater  management  responsibility \nlocal \ngovernments  for  foreshore  areas  and  MPAs  will  enhance  sustainability  of  project  initiatives. \nNational,  regional,  and  municipal  institutional  weakness  will  be  addressed;  and  government \nstaff, local communities, and NGOs will be strengthened to assume their responsibilities.  \n\nthe  project  design  and \n\nits \n\nto \n\n79. \nAnalysis of the current budget and expenditure patterns for project municipalities shows \nthat on average, the annual counterpart funding requirements for project activities during project \nimplementation would be about 2% of the revenues and 8% of the development expenditures of \nan  average  fourth  class  municipality\u2500the  majority  group  among  project  municipalities.  During \nthe  postproject  period,  the  annual  funding  requirements  to  support  recurring  costs  for  project \ninitiatives,  including  operation  and  maintenance  of  infrastructure  facilities,  will  be  1%  of \nmunicipal  revenues  and  6%  of  the  present  development  expenditures.  Assuming  that  current \ntrends  in  funding  are  maintained,  municipal  governments  will  have  sufficient  resources  to \nsustain the Project\u2019s impact. \n\n\f \n\n19\n\n \n\n   \n\nThe  capacity  of  municipal  governments  for  sustainable  financing  of  ICRM  will  be \n80. \naugmented  by  developing  appropriate  policy  for  user  fees  and  resource  rents  for  MPA, \nmangroves, coral reefs, beaches, foreshore fisheries, and mariculture. The Project provides for \nundertaking  relevant  policy  studies,  formulating  recommendations,  and  pilot  testing  the \nrecommendations in five municipalities. Successful models will be supported at least in one third \nof the municipalities during the Project.  \n\nE. \n\nRisks \n\nRisks  that  may  affect  project  implementation,  constrain  attainment  of  objectives,  and \n81. \nultimately  impact  project  success  include  (i)  degradation  of  the  global  environment  and \nmacroeconomic  conditions,  (ii)  lack  of  political  will  to  support  the  ICRMP,  (iii)  institutional \nweaknesses, (iv) peace and order situation, and (v) governance and anticorruption. \n\n82. \nDegradation of Global Environment. Global and regional environment conditions (e.g., \nclimate  change,  disease  outbreaks,  and  coral  bleaching)  could  undermine  project  gains  in \nresource management and biodiversity conservation. In addition, populations of some severely \ndepleted  species  in  high  biodiversity  sites  may  not  be  restored  through  project  interventions. \nThe  project  design  provides  for  countermeasures  to  address  this  risk.  High  biodiversity  sites \nhave  been  selected  from  various  biogeographic  regions  throughout  the  Philippines;  they  are \nexpected to respond differently or not be exposed to the same regional or global conditions. The \nProject  will  focus  on  several  different  threatened  species  and  habitats,  and  promote  the \nestablishment of networks or corridors of MPAs to ensure that the risks are dispersed.  \n\n83. \nInstitutional Weaknesses. DENR does not have an adequate number of qualified staff \nfor the sector, and the existing moratorium on creating new regular positions may affect project \nimplementation. DENR will address the issue by redeploying staff, enhancing their skills through \nin-house  training,  and  hiring  contractual  staff.  Provision  is  made  in  the  project  design  for \nenhancing  national,  regional,  and  local  staff  skills,  and  hiring  contractual  staff.  Moreover,  in \ndesigning  the  implementation  arrangements,  care  has  been  taken  to  mainstream  the  project \nfunctions  and  responsibilities  into  the  existing  organizational  structure  of  DENR  rather  than \nestablish  new  national  and  regional  project  management  units  exclusively  for  the  Project. \nInstitutional  weaknesses  will  be  further  mitigated  by  DENR  sharing  the  implementation \nresponsibility with DA and municipal government and academic institutions. \n\n84. \nPolitical  Commitment.  Since  the  early  1990s,  the  national  Government  has  shown \nincreasing commitment to marine and coastal resources management. Continued Government \ncommitment  to  the  sector  is  reiterated  in  the  Presidential  Executive  Order  533  adopting \nintegrated  coastal  management  as  a  national  strategy  (para.  20).  Local  governments  are  also \ntaking  increasing  initiatives  to  manage  their  coastal  resources,  and  actively  participated  in \nproject  preparation.  However,  changes  in  local  leadership  during  project  implementation  may \naffect emphasis on the sector. This risk will be mitigated through municipal council resolutions \nand  memorandums  of  agreement  between  DENR  and  MDFO  providing  binding  commitments \ncovering the project period. \n\nBreakdown of Peace and Order. The 68 municipalities selected for the Project do not \n85. \ncurrently  have  serious  peace  and  order  problems.  If  a  problem  develops  in  an  area,  the  PSC \ncould decide, in consultation with ADB, to redirect efforts and staff to a more secure area within \nthe province. \n\nPoor  Governance.  Good  governance  assumes  an  important  dimension  in  the  Project \n86. \nbecause  its  successful  project  implementation  will  require  stakeholders  concerned  at  various \nlevels  to  agree  and  adjust  to  the  policy  and  governance  regime  changes  promoted  by  the \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nProject. Most of the stakeholders have been receptive to these changes; some may be slow in \nresponding to the needs for change during project implementation. The risk will be mitigated by \nthe emphasis on IEC campaigns to be conducted throughout the project period.  \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  DENR  have  given  the \n\n87. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nAdequate  budget  will  be  provided  for  the  project  activities,  and  funds  will  be \nreleased regularly throughout the project period. \n\nAn  adequate  number  of  qualified  staff  at  national,  regional,  and  provincial  level \nwill be made available for the Project throughout its implementation. \n\nEach participating municipality will enter into an implementation agreement with \nthe national Government on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB, including \nthe  commitment  of  the  municipality  to  provide  the  recurring  expenditures  of \ncoastal  resources  management  during  and  after  project  completion.  Each \nmunicipality  that  is  to  obtain  financing  for  component  D  will  enter  into  an \nagreement  with  the  national  Government  to  provide  the  required  equity \ncontribution in cash or kind. \n\n(iv)  MDFO  or  its  successor  will  disburse  eligible  loan  and  grant  funds  to  the \n\nparticipating municipalities upon their fulfillment of the requirements.   \n\nThe  gender  action  plan  prepared  for  the  Project  will  be  fully  implemented  in  a \ntimely  manner,  and  adequate  resources  will  be  allocated  for  the  purpose. \nGender-related indicators will be collected and included in the PPMS. \n\nProject  implementing  agencies  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement  (footnote  7)  and  ensure  that  land  acquired  under  the  Project  is \neither  unoccupied  public  land  or  has  been  paid  for  in  cash,  and  will  not  involve \nvoluntary land donation. The evidence of such transaction will be kept on record \nduring project implementation. \n\nPeople  who  may  be  adversely  affected  by  the  resource  access  restrictions  and \ndiscipline  will  be  identified,  and  potential  impacts  on  their  incomes  will  be \nmitigated  through  their  inclusion  in  the  project-supported,  community-based \nresource  management  and  enterprise  development  and  income-diversification \nactivities. Identities of those affected and the proposed mitigation measures will \nform part of an ICRM plan to be prepared for each municipality and approved by \nDENR  prior  to  imposition  of  resource  access  restrictions.  Implementation  of \nmitigation measures will commence prior to imposition of restrictions and will be \nmonitored under the PPMS. \n\n(viii) \n\nIf  the  presence  of  indigenous  people  is  identified  in  any  of  the  project \nmunicipalities  and  who  may  be  significantly  affected,  an  indigenous  peoples\u2019 \ndevelopment  plan  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \nindigenous peoples (footnote 9).

Coral reefs provide food, livelihood, recreational and tourism opportunities, \nerosion  protection,  and  extremely  high  biodiversity.  Of  the  25,000  square  kilometers  (km2)  of \ncoral reefs in the Philippines, less than 5% are still in excellent condition. Destructive fishing and \ncoral  mining  are  the  most  prevalent  problems.  Other  major  threats  include  sedimentation  and \ncoastal  development.  Coral  reefs  are  the  habitat  of  about  90%  of  the  fish  caught  by  coastal \nfishers;  their  degradation  results  in  a  rapid  decrease  of  fisheries  production  in  coastal  areas. \nWhile  nationwide  decline  in  coral  reef  continues,  conservation  efforts  initiated  over  the  last \ndecade or so are showing improvements at some sites, particularly in the Visayas region.  \n\nMangroves.  Mangrove  coverage  decreased  from  around  4,500  km2  in  1918  to  only \n2. \nabout  1,  380  km2 in  the  1990s.  Satellite  image  analyses  indicate  that  Mindanao  has  the  most \nremaining mangrove areas in the country (29% of the country\u2019s total), while Luzon and Mindoro \nhave  the  least.  Old  growth  mangrove  forests  are  to  be  found  only  in  Palawan  (5,317  ha)  and \nMindanao  (4,582  hectares).  The  rapid  loss  of  mangrove  cover  has  exacerbated  shoreline \nerosion,  led  to  destruction  of  natural  habitats  for  demersal  fish  and  shrimp,  increased  the \noccurrence  of  saline  water  intrusion  into  freshwater  aquifers,  and  affected  the  livelihood  of \ncoastal fishers.  \n\n3. \nFisheries  Resources.  Various  scientific  studies  demonstrate  that  Philippine  fisheries \nhad exceeded maximum sustainable yields by 1987. The average fish catch per unit effort for \ncoral reef fisheries is now less than 2 kilograms/day, down from as much 20 kilograms/day 30 \nyears ago. Total production has been static for the last 10 years despite the increased number \nand  tonnage  of  commercial  vessels  and  increased  number  of  municipal  fishers.  Catch \ncomposition is changing to lower value species and economic revenues are declining. Much of \nthe  declining  fisheries productivity  can  be  attributed  to  overharvesting,  destructive  fishing, and \nloss of habitats. Excess capacity in the fishing industry, increasing population, and poverty put \nadditional  pressure  on  resources.  Poverty  forces  people  to  use  destructive  methods  to  meet \ntheir immediate needs, which result in a cycle of resource depletion and continuing poverty. \n\nB. \n\nImpacts on Biodiversity \n\nThe  current  status  of  resources  has  adversely  affected  the  coastal  and  marine \n\n4. \nbiodiversity of the Philippines, which is of global importance (Table A1). \n\nC. \n\nImpacts on Coastal Population \n\n5. \nOf  the  1  million  coastal  fisherfolk,  69%  are  engaged  in  municipal  fishing,  25%  in \naquaculture, and 6% in commercial fisheries. Municipal fisherfolk are among the poorest in the \nPhilippines, with an average family income that is half the national average. With open access \nto the sea, an increasing number of subsistence fisherfolk compete with each other for fisheries \nresources  that  declined  dramatically  over  the  years.  Consequently,  the  incidence  of  poverty \namong municipal fisherfolk is on the rise.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nTable A1: Threatened Marine Species and their Habitat Requirements \n \n\nSpecies \nReptiles \n     Sea turtles (all species) \n\n     Sea snakes (all species) \nMammals \n     Sea cow (dugong) \n     Dolphins (all species) \n     Whales and porpoises (all species) \nFish \n     Whale sharks (1 species) \n     Manta rays (all species) \n     Milkfish (1 species) \nCrabs \n     Coconut crabs (Birgus latro) \nMolluscs \n     Giant clams (7 species) \n     Giant triton shell (Charonia tritonis) \n     Helmet shell (Cassis spp.) \n     Kapis shell (Placuna placenta) \nCorals \n     Stony and precious corals (all species \nBirds \n     Seabirds \n     Water birds (5 species inc. 1 extirpated) \n\nHabitat Requirements \n\n \nCoral reefs, sea-grass beds, beaches, and near-\nshore waters \nFringing coral reefs, midwater reefs \n \nSea-grass beds, bays with reefs \nOpen water areas and midwater reefs \nOpen water areas \n \nOpen water and midwater reefs \nOpen water and coral reefs \nEstuaries, coral reefs, and open water areas \n \nBeach areas \n \nCoral reefs, sea-grass beds, and sandy areas \nCoral reefs \nCoral reefs \nCoral reefs, sandy areas \n \nEstuaries, reefs, and mudflats \n \nCoral reefs \nRemote, oceanic islets without human disturbance \nand predators; rocks; and cliffs \nCoastal ecosystems; mangroves, ponds, lagoons \n\n     Shorebirds (5 species) \nSources:  World  Bank.  Philippines  Environment  Monitor  2005;  DENR  2001;  and  International  \nConservation Union Red Data List 2004. \n\n \nD. \n\nFactors Affecting Coastal Resources \n\n6. \nFactors  directly  affecting  coastal  resources  include  (i)  unsustainable  use  of  resources \n(overfishing  and  use  of  destructive  methods  and  gear),  (ii)  habitat  (mangrove  and  coral  reef) \nloss,  (iii)  coastal  pollution,  (iv)  erosion  and  sedimentation,  and  (v)  unplanned  foreshore  and \nshoreline  developments.  Factors  (i)  and  (ii)  are  discussed  in  paras.  1\u20133;  discussion  of  factors \n(iii)\u2013(v) follows. \n\nPollution.  Coastal  ecosystems  are  threatened  by  nutrient  loading  or  eutrophication. \n7. \nNutrients  come  from  industrial,  commercial,  agricultural,  and  domestic  wastewater  runoff \ncarrying  organic  wastes  and  fertilizer  residue.  Nutrients  enhance  the  growth  of  algae \n(sometimes  causing  red  tides)  and  bacteria,  resulting  in  the  reduction  of  light  and  oxygen  in \ncoastal waters. Most coastal ecosystems near urbanized areas have been affected by nutrient \nloading, and agricultural runoff is becoming a growing source of pollution in coastal waters.  \n\n8. \nErosion  and  Sedimentation.  Industrial  logging,  combined  with  lack  of  proper  forest \nmanagement  has  resulted  in  the  loss  of  nearly  80%  of  the  Philippines\u2019  original  forests. \nAgricultural  activities  are  practiced  on  steep  slopes,  and  contour  farming  and  other  soil \nconservation practices are not widely utilized. Poor management practices lead to soil erosion \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nand increased flooding, which in turn causes higher costs of coastal infrastructure maintenance, \nrisks to lives, and damage to aquatic habitats. \n\n9. \nForeshore and Shoreline Areas. Approximately 70% of the municipalities and 25 of the \nlargest cities in the Philippines are located in the coastal zone. The country\u2019s foreshore (the land \nstrip  between  high  and  low  tides)  and  shoreline  areas  are  mainly  used  for  settlements  and \nhousing. The proliferation of coastal dwellers, who have no rights over the land they occupy and \noften  have  no  basic  facilities  for  sanitation,  solid  waste  management,  sewerage,  and  water \nsupply, contribute to the degradation and deterioration of the coastal environment.    \n\n10. \nThese factors affecting coastal resource decline and degradation can be linked to issues \nsuch as weak law enforcement and legal gaps, national and local institutional weaknesses, lack \nof  stakeholder  awareness  and  participation  in  resource  management,  poverty  among  coastal \ncommunities, and lack of a holistic approach to resource management. \n\n11.  Weak  Law  Enforcement  and  Legal  Gaps.  A  common  issue  with  respect  to  the \nPhilippines coastal resources management is poor compliance with laws and regulations. This \nis  partly  because  of  inconsistencies  in  policy  documents  developed  over  time  and  across \nsectors. Jurisdictional overlaps result when two or more laws govern different uses of a coastal \nresource.  Moreover,  the  local  application  of  these  laws  is  affected  by  the  local  legislative \nmandate  of  the  local  government  units,  which  have  broad  management  functions  and \nprerogatives  under  the  Local  Government  Code.  A  discussion  of  some  of  the  major  gaps  and \ninconsistencies  in  existing  laws  and  regulations  to  deal  with  coastal  resources  management \nissues follows.  \n\nThe  law  governing  mangrove  resources  presently  consists  of  general  provisions \n12. \ncontained  in  the  Revised  Forestry  Code  enacted  in  1975  and  the  Fisheries  Code  of  1998.  At \npresent,  the  conversion,  alienation,  and  disposition  of  mangroves  are  prohibited  under \nprevailing  laws,  and  those  released  for  fishpond  development  but  remain  unutilized  or  were \nabandoned are  required  to  be  reverted  to  the  public  domain.  The  process  for  reversion  to  the \npublic domain is usually a contentious issue among the Department of Environment and Natural \nResources  (DENR),  Bureau  of  Fisheries  and  Aquatic  Resources  of  the  Department  of \nAgriculture (DA), and the fishpond lessee. \n\n13. \nLaws governing the foreshore are among the most archaic in the Philippines. They are \nalso  among  the  most  scattered,  spread  across  several  different  codes,  including  the  Spanish \nLaw  of  Waters  of  1866,  Civil  Code,  Public  Land  Act,  Water  Code,  Fisheries  Code,  and  Local \nGovernment  Code.  Although  the  local  government  units  have  ample  powers  for  land \nclassification,  zoning,  and  regulation  of  all  businesses  and  structures  within  their  territorial \njurisdiction,  overlapping  mandates  with  DENR  and  the  Bureau  of  Fisheries  and  Aquatic \nResources result in very little actual regulation. No definitive coastal land-use policy is in place \nto provide guidance as to the proper allocation of roles and responsibilities, as well as definite \npriorities for how coastal areas should be used. \n\n14. \nInstitutional Weaknesses. DENR and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, \nthe two key national agencies with responsibility for integrated coastal resources management, \nare  short  of  qualified  staff  for  the  sector.  Both  the  agencies  have  ongoing  programs  for  staff \nredeployment and training to overcome these shortages. In addition, contractual staff have been \nrecruited to meet immediate requirements. \n\nThe  Local  Government  Code  of  1991  devolved  some  of  the  coastal  resources \n15. \nmanagement functions and responsibilities to local governments. Local government capacity to \ncarry  out  the  responsibility  has  only  recently  begun  to  mature  as  a  direct  result  of  increasing \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\nawareness  of  the  socioeconomic  importance  of  coastal  resources.  However,  most  local \ngovernments  lack  financial  and  technical  resources  to  ensure  sustainable  management  of \nresources. \n\nPublic  Awareness.  Since  the  early  1990s,  various  initiatives  undertaken  for  coastal \n16. \nresources  management  with  bilateral  and  multilateral  assistance  have  been  successful  in \ncreating awareness among coastal communities and other local stakeholders on the importance \nof sustainable use and conservation of coastal resources. However, still much needs to be done \nand a large number of coastal municipalities have not yet received any such support.  \n\n17. \nHolistic  Approach  to  Coastal  Resources  Management.  The  decline  of  coastal \nresources has been caused by a complex set of threats, with their origin spanning the nearest \nwatershed divide to the sea. Effective coastal resources management, therefore, should follow \nan integrated, holistic approach that considers interaction among and within resource systems \nas well as interaction between humans and their environment.  \n\nE. \n\nProblems and Constraints Analysis \n\nA summary of key barriers that restrict the marine and coastal resources and biodiversity \n\n18. \nand the conceptual model of the Project is given in Figure A1.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n \nCore Problem \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure A1: Threats to Coastal Resources and Biodiversity and the Project Conceptual Model \n\nImmediate Threats \n\nRoot/Underlying Causes \n\n \nLoss of coastal \nresources and \nbiodiversity  \n\n \n  Habitat destruction:  \n  Mangrove clearing \n  Coral reef damage (e.g.,  \n\nfrom dynamite and cyanide) \n\nSiltation and pollution: \nErosion from degraded \nlands \nAgricultural, industrial, and \nurban runoff \nSewage and solid waste \n\n \nUnsustainable use of \nresources: \nOverfishing, overharvesting \nBlast and poison fishing \nIllegal commercial fishing \n\nCO = community organizations, ICRM = integrated coastal resources management, \nLGU = local government unit, NGA = national government agency, \nNGO = nongovernment organization. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nInstitutional \nweaknesses (in NGAs, \nLGUs, NGOs, and \nCOs) \n\nInadequate \nenforcement \n(patrolling, fines, and \nsanctions) \n\nLack of awareness and \nlack of stakeholder \nparticipation \n\nInadequate information \nfor decision making \n(carrying capacity, \nlimits on utilization) \n\nPoverty in coastal \ncommunities \n\nPopulation pressures \n(accelerating growth \nrates) \n\n3\n0\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n2\n \n\ni\n\nProject  \n\nInterventions \n\nComponent A:  \nPolicy and institutional \nstrengthening \ndevelopment \nPolicy aspects \nCapacity-building \nPerformance-based \nincentives  \n\nComponent B:  \nICRM and biodiversity \nconservation  \nICRM \nBiodiversity \nconservation \n\nComponent C: \nEnterprise \ndevelopment and \nincome diversification \n\n \nComponent D:  \nSocial and \nenvironmental  \nservices and facility \n\n\fEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE MARINE AND COASTAL RESOURCES SECTOR \n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n \nItem \n \nA.

The  land  to  be \nacquisitioned is either unoccupied public land, or has been paid for in cash and \nthe proof of the transaction submitted prior to commencement of civil works. \nIf  the  social  assessment  identifies  the  presence  of  indigenous  people  or  ethnic \nminorities or other disadvantaged groups in the community, the scheme provides \nequitable benefits to these groups. \nAlternate  designs  have  been  considered  and  the  proposed  design  is  the  least-\ncost option. \nThe  initial  environmental  examination  is  complete,  with  no  significant  adverse \nimpact  identified.  If  significant  adverse  impacts  are  identified,  an  environmental \nimpact  assessment  must  be  undertaken  and  mitigating  measures  identified  and \nprovided in the plan, along with cost estimates. The relevant DENR office revises \nimpact \nand  approves \nassessment as per the Government environmental regulations. \nThe community is willing to share the cost of operation and maintenance. \n\ninitial  environmental  examination/environmental \n\nthe \n\n(vi) \n \nSpecific Criteria \n\nCriteria for drinking water schemes include the following: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe scheme benefits at least 25 households. \nThe majority of the beneficiary population are poor, or have no ready access to \nsafe drinking water.  \nThe  scheme  will  reduce  the  average  economic  cost  of  water  relative  to  the \nexisting source. \n\n \nCriteria for sanitation schemes include the following: \n \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nThe scheme benefits at least 25 households. \nThe  majority  of  the  beneficiary  population  are  poor,  or  the  prevalence  of  poor \nsanitation-related disease among them is high. \n\n \nFor  social  facilities  such  as  community  centers  and  classrooms  for  existing  schools, \n\n4. \ncriteria include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nThe facility serves a community of at least 100 households. \nClassrooms will be add-ons to existing school facilities. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a \nnational priority in country poverty \npartnership agreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Philippines: \nA  large  proportion  of  the  40  million  coastal  population  is  highly  dependent  on  coastal  and  marine \nresources  for  food  and  employment.  More  than  1  million  (5%  of  the  labor  force)  are  employed  in  the \ncommercial  and  municipal  fisheries  sector,  which  also  supplies  50%  of  the  country\u2019s  protein  needs.  A \ndegraded resource base and inequitable access are some reasons cited as causes of poverty in coastal \ncommunities.  \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                 Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nSurveys in potential project areas indicate that a coastal household\u2019s average annual income is P56,486. \nBased on their source of annual income, employment provides the highest average (P86,134), followed by \nfarming (P55,548), business (P52,831), and fishing (P50,310). Poverty incidence in the coastal community \nis  extremely  high  at  76%,  compared  with  the  general  level  of  41.8%  in  the  target  provinces  and  34.2 \nnationwide. \n \nSocial infrastructure is limited in most coastal areas. Some 28% of households do not have toilets. Access \nto  potable  water  for  some  is  only  through  dug  shallow  wells  (18%),  artesian  wells  (2%),  water  vendors \n(1%), or springs (1%). Garbage disposal is primarily through burning, followed by indiscriminate dumping \nin vacant lots or one\u2019s own backyard. Less than 5% of households report that their garbage is collected \nthrough a municipal solid waste collection system. \n \nWomen  in  coastal  communities  are  more  disadvantaged  compared  with  their  male  counterparts.  The \nprevailing  gender  division  of  labor,  together  with  traditional  practices  in  coastal  communities,  limits  and \nhinders women\u2019s access and control of community resources and optimization of their skills and potential \nfor coastal fisheries development and resource management. Women\u2019s contribution to the household and \ncommunity services remains largely undervalued. \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes             \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nAnalysis identified the following stakeholders: coastal communities, fisherfolk, civil societies, municipal and \nprovincial governments, and national government sector agencies. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nStakeholders  participated  during  project  preparation,  and  the  project  design  provides  for  their  strategic \ninterventions during implementation. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe  Project  includes  various  steps  to  enhance  women\u2019s  participation  in  coastal  resources  management \nplanning,  access  to  formal  and  informal  training,  participation  in  community  and  professional  decision \nmaking,  and  ability  to  protect  their  interests  and  improve  their  livelihoods.  Through  gender  sensitization \ntraining  and  gender-disaggregated  data,  awareness  about  gender  and  development  issues  will  be \nenhanced among all project stakeholders. Full participation of women in all stages of ICRM development \nwill be ensured through the implementation of a gender action plan.  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n35 \n\n \nE.

Documentation of plot location, \nownership, cost and tenure status, and guarantees \nthat land purchases are not forced upon the sellers \nand public land plots are unoccupied will be a \ncondition of Asian Development Bank (ADB) \napproval for infrastructure facilities. Any people \nadversely affected by the access restriction and \ndiscipline to aquatic, mangrove, and watershed \nresources will be compensated in accordance with \nthe Restricted Resource Use Framework. \nInvestments in clean water will contribute to \nlowering the cost in collecting and/or buying water \nfrom vendors. Beneficiary contributions to resource \nmanagement and social infrastructure and service \nimprovement will be in the form of labor and \nparticipation, and will not affect their livelihoods.   \nNo displacement of labor will occur as a result of the \nProject.  \n\nAvailable information suggests that the Project will \nnot cover or affect any area inhabited by indigenous \npeople. If such groups of people are identified who \nmay be significantly affected by the Project in any \nmunicipality, then indigenous peoples\u2019 development \nplans will be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nindigenous peoples policy, and implementation of \nproject activities in these municipalities will be \nconditional on ADB\u2019s approval of the relevant \nindigenous peoples\u2019 development plans. The \nGovernment will ensure that no project activity will \ntake place in, or have adverse impacts on, land, \ninland waters, coastal areas, and natural resources \nwithin them, that are designated ancestral domains \nwith corresponding certificate of title or are under \nclaims as ancestral domains. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nGENDER ACTION PLAN \n\n \n1. \nThe gender action plan aims at promoting women\u2019s participation in project activities and \nensuring  that  they  benefit  equally  from  the  Project.  This  will  be  achieved  through  a  set  of \nmeasures  including  the  following:  (i)  collecting  gender  disaggregated  data  in  household \nsocioeconomic  studies,  national  and  municipal  gender  sensitization  training,  and  integrating \ngender  analysis  in  the  municipal  integrated  coastal  resources  management  (ICRM)  planning, \nmonitoring,  and  evaluation;  (ii)  including  women  as  a  major  stakeholder  for  component  C  on \nenterprise development and income diversification; and ensuring their membership in self-reliant \ngroups  and  involvement  in  the  identification,  establishment,  and  demonstration  of  viable \nenterprises  and  livelihood  activities;  and  (iii)  including  women  as  a  primary  stakeholder  in  the \nidentification,  planning,  construction,  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  social  and \nenvironmental infrastructure and facilities under component D. \n \n2. \nmonitored (Table A7). \n\nThe  Project  sets  a  progressive  target  for  gender  action  to  be  implemented  and \n\n \nComponent/Activity \n \nConsultations \n\nInformation, Education, and \nCommunication Campaigns \n(IECs) \n\nICRM Plans \n\n \nTable A7: Gender Approach and Target \n \n\nGender Approach and Target \n\n\u2022  Women\u2019s participation in consultations on policy issues will be \nensured through participation of women\u2019s interest groups and \nnongovernment organizations focusing on environmental issues \nIEC campaigns will include modules especially tailored for women\u2019s \nrole in ICRM \nIEC campaigns will target the linkage between population growth and \ndeteriorating coastal resources, and population management \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  At least 33% of members of ICRM organizations mobilized/revitalized \n\nby the Project will be women \n\n\u2022  At least 33% of the marine protected area board members will be \n\nwomen \n\nbe women \n\nTraining \n\n\u2022  At least 33% of the participants of ICRM and biodiversity for staff will \n\nLivelihood Opportunities \n\n\u2022  At least 33% of the participants of ICRM, biodiversity, enforcement, \n\ntechnical, and entrepreneurial training for beneficiaries will be women \n\n\u2022  At least 33% of the members in self-reliant groups will be women \n\u2022  At least 33% of the self-reliant group leaders will be women \n\u2022  At least 33% of the beneficiaries from training and demonstration \n\nenterprises will be women \n\nSocial and Environmental \nInfrastructure \n\n\u2022  Through participation in ICRM plan preparation, women\u2019s \n\nparticipation in planning, implementation, and maintenance will be \nensured \n\nIncremental Staffing  \n\n\u2022  At least 33% of the new staff recruited under the Project will be \n\nwomen \n\nICRM = integrated coastal resource management. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n  \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n37 \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\n1. \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  conducted  taking  into  consideration  the \nnature  of  the  project  components  and  types  of  specific  interventions  proposed  under  each \ncomponent. Due to the extensive and varied geographic scope of the Project, the IEE was not \ncarried out on a site-specific basis, but rather on the type of intervention and potential impacts, \nregardless of site. A summary of impacts and mitigation measures (including a monitoring plan) \nfor activities with some adverse impacts are identified and described in the IEE (Supplementary \nAppendix B).  \n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n2. \nThe  Project  will  consist  of  four  components:  component  A:  policy  and  institutional \nstrengthening  and  development;  component  B:  integrated  coastal  resource  management  and \nbiodiversity conservation; component C: enterprise development and income diversification; and \ncomponent D: social and environmental services and facilities. Environmental assessment was \nconducted for components C and D, while environmental safeguard consideration was included \nin components A and B.  \n\nThe livelihood enterprises will be small-scale with investments ranging from P10,000 to \n3. \nP150,000.  For  component  D,  each  drinking  water  and  sanitation  schemes  will  serve  about  25 \nhouseholds,  and  each  community  centers,  daycare  centers,  add-on  class  rooms  will  serve \nabout  100  households.  While  the  improved  management  of  coastal  resources  will  bring \nsignificant environmental benefits, some of the livelihood activities and social and environmental \ninfrastructure, though of small-scale, may have adverse environmental impacts if environmental \nsafeguards are not complied with during their implementation.  \n\nC. \n\nDescription of Environment \n\n4. \nThe  project  area  covers  68  municipalities  in  the  provinces  of  Cagayan,  Zambales, \nMasbate,  Cebu,  Siquijor,  and  Davao  Oriental.  The  area  covers  1,800  kilometers  (km)  of \ncoastline representing 10% of the total coastline of the country. Six municipalities were selected \nin these provinces as representative study sites. \n\n5. \nClaveria,  Cagayan.  Claveria,  located  on  the  northwestern  portion  of  the  province  of \nCagayan, has 12 km of coastline made up of alluvial sand, sparse mangroves, and marginally \ndeveloped coral reefs. The area is hypothesized to have an upwelling condition. Tuna, sailfish, \ndolphins, and sharks are some species that can be caught in the deep waters offshore; lobsters \nand the popular porphyra are harvested nearshore. Beach seining and milkfish fry gathering is \ndone  on  a  seasonal  basis.  The  main  environmental  issues  identified  include  (i)  intrusion  of \nforeign  fishing  fleets,  (ii)  fish  kills  due  to  density  of  fish  cages  in  Pata  river,  and  (iii)  illegal \noccupation of foreshore lands.   \n\n6. \nMasinloc,  Zambales.  The  municipality  of  Masinloc  is  bounded  by  Oyon  and  Masinloc \nbays. The total length of the coastline is about 42.2 km. Coastal resources include mangroves, \ncoral  reefs,  and  sea  grass.  Within  the  Masinloc\u2013Oyon  bay  area,  260  hectares  (ha)  of \nmangroves are in good condition. Corals located near the cooling water outfall of the coal-fired \npower  plant  were  dead  but  still  standing,  while  those  inside  and  outside  the  nearby  San \nSalvador  Fish  Sanctuary  appeared  healthy.  Fish  biomass  was  observed  to  be  highest  inside \nand  near  the  sanctuary.  The  area  has  more  than  1,000  municipal  fishers  and  10  commercial \nfishing boats originating mainly from the Visayas. \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nThe  main  environmental  issues  in  the  municipality  include  erosion  and  sedimentation, \n7. \npollution from residential areas situated along the coastline, and dust and discharge of cooling \nwater  from  the  power  plant.  Reclamation  was  also  observed,  mainly  for  housing,  and \nunregulated construction of foreshore structures such as revetments. Blast fishing and cyanide \nfishing are considered major threats to fisheries and coral resources.  \n\n8. \nBatuan,  Masbate.  Batuan  is  the  southernmost  municipality  on  Ticao  Island  in  the \nprovince of Masbate. It has 14 barangays, 10 of which are coastal. The municipality has seven \ncoral  reef  areas,  which  are  in  poor  to  fair  condition.  The  main  coastal  resource  management \nproblems are declining fish catch and poverty, which are attributed to mangrove and coral reef \ndestruction  due  to  illegal  activities  such  as  conversion  and  cutting  for  mangroves,  and \ndestructive fishing and sand quarrying for coral reefs. \n\nLazi,  Siquijor.  The  Lazi  is  one  of  six  municipalities  comprising  the  island  province  of \n9. \nSiquijor. It is located at the southern part of the province bordered on the south by the Mindanao \nSea. The municipality has a 15.59 km shoreline characterized by sandy and rocky beaches and \nlimestone cliffs. The 24,574.96 ha area of municipal waters is three times larger than the land \narea. Mangrove habitat condition is rated fair to good (heavy cutting, fishpond conversions, and \nsome  cutting  for  firewood)  and  sea-grass  condition  is  rated  as  good.  The  overall  rating  of  the \ncoral reef habitat is fair, having a 38.5% coral cover, and relatively high average fish abundance \nof  economically  important  fish  species.  The  main  coastal  resource  issues  include  damaged \ncoastal  habitats,  mainly  from  mangrove  conversion,  and  low  fish  catch  due  to  illegal  fishing. \nRevival of an old limestone quarry may also pose a threat to the coastal environment. \n\n10. \nDaanbantayan,  Cebu.  Daanbantayan  is  on  the  northern  tip  of  Cebu  bordering  the \nVisayan  Sea.  The  municipality  has  20  barangays,  15  of  which  are  coastal,  and  six  offshore \nislands with only two inhabited. It has a coastline of 43 km. Daanbantayan is situated in one of \nthe  most  highly  fished  areas  of  the  Visayan  Sea.  Of  the  70,000  population,  about  17%  are \nfishers.  Not  many  mangroves  were  observed  but  considerable  sea  grass  was  noted  and  the \ncoral  reef  is  in  its  incipient  stage  of  development.  Thresher  sharks,  whales,  dugongs,  sharks, \nrays,  and  sea  turtles  are  known  to  inhabit  the  area.  Mangrove  clearing,  sand  and  pebble \nquarrying, and illegal occupation of foreshore areas are among the environmental issues in the \narea. Blast fishing is also rampant.  \n\n11.  Mati,  Davao  Oriental.  Mati  is  located  in  the  southeastern  part  of  Davao  Oriental.  The \ncoastal waters comprise (i) Pujada Bay within which is located Balite Bay, (ii) Mayo Bay, and (iii) \ncoastal waters south of Pujada Bay extending to Cape San Agustin. Pujada Bay is a seascape \nunder  the  national  integrated  protected  areas  systems.  The  uncoordinated  development  of \naquaculture and agricultural run-off contribute to coastal pollution resulting in occasional red tide \noutbreaks in the area. Weak enforcement of laws and regulations and lack of public awareness \nare other major environmental issues.  \n\nD. \n\nForecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n12. \nComponents  A  and  B  will  improve  coastal  biodiversity  and  the  environment  in  the \nmedium  to  long  term.  Components  C  and  D  may  have  some  adverse  environmental  impacts \nand are discussed in the environmental management plan (EMP) template in Table A8.     \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n39 \n\nTable A8: Summary Matrix of Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n\nImpact/Mitigation Measures \n\nActivity \n\nComponent C  \nMariculture  \n(cage culture, \nseaweed \nfarming, etc) \n  \n\nComponent D \n \nConstruction of \nsmall \ninfrastructure \nfacilities, such as \nday-care \nfacilities, \nclassrooms, \ncoastal erosion \ncontrol \nstructures  \n\nWater supply \nsystem level II \nand public toilets \n(component D, \nenvironmental \nmanagement \nplan template) \n\nImpacts (construction): Impacts include hazards to navigation and/or access to fishers; \nimpediments  to  water  circulation  and  mixing;  possible  impacts  to  nearby  coral  reefs, \nsea-grass beds, or marine protection areas; water quality  \n \nImpacts  (operation):  Impacts  from  overcrowding,  unused  fish  feeds,  dead  fish  and \nother  chemicals,  fish  diseases,  etc.  The  positive  impacts  of  the  Project  during  the \noperation/implementation  phase  are  provision  of  livelihood  and  employment,  relief  of \npressure on the fishery and coastal resource in the area, and additional income in the \nform of taxes for the host municipality.  \n \nMitigation  Measures  (construction):  For  fish  cages  ,proper  siting  to  reduce  impacts, \nwhich includes selecting locations that will allow adequate mixing and circulation and \nnot impede them, ensuring that criteria for 10% or more concentration of sea cages in \nwater  bodies  is  not  exceeded  and  avoiding  areas  near  coral  reefs,  sea-grass  beds, \nand marine protected areas. \n \nFor  seaweed  farming,  construction  and  maintenance  of  seaweed  culture  structure \nshould cause minimal damage to the bottom habitat (e.g., minimal disturbance during \nconstruction  of  stakes,  adequate  spacing  of  seaweed  plants  to  allow  adequate  light \npenetration to the bottom, etc.). \n \nMitigation  Measures  (operation):  Maintaining  correct  stock  density,  following  best \nmanagement practices for feed management, efficient dead fish removal, and use of \nnontoxic  chemicals.  For  seaweed  farming,  dead  plants  should  be  removed  and \ndisposed of in an environmentally safe manner in accordance with national and local \ncodes.     \nImpacts (construction): Site clearing will result in loss of some vegetative cover in the \nsite.  Use  of  small  construction  equipment  will  increase  the  level  of  total  suspended \nparticles, sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides. These impacts will however be small and \ntemporary.  Social  benefits  will  accrue  as  a  result  of  the  implementation  of  these \ninterventions, which would result in positive environmental benefits through improved \nwell-being of the people. \n \nImpacts (operation): Solid waste and sanitary wastewater generation. \n \nMitigation  Measures  (construction):  Follow  environmental  screening  criteria  and \nstandard design practices. Minimal disturbance to existing vegetation and replanting of \nremoved  trees,  soil  erosion  control  measures  like  controlling  off-site  run-offs, \nreseeding  disturbed  areas,  spraying  water  on  disturbed  areas  to  control  dust,  and \nmaintenance of construction equipment and vehicles.  \n \nMitigation  Measures  (operation):  Solid  waste  bins  and  septic  tank  facilities  with \nseptage and solid waste disposed in an environmentally safe manner. \n  \nImpacts  (construction):  Some  impacts  of  this  activity  will  be  generated  during  the \nconstruction phases of implementation. Site clearing will result in the loss of vegetative \ncover  in  the  site  and  small  increases  in  total  suspended  particles,  sulfur  oxides,  and \nnitrogen  oxides  due  to  increase  in  mobile  sources  for  construction  activity.  These \nimpacts  are  temporary  and  insignificant  in  magnitude.  Improved  sanitary  and  health \nconditions will occur as a result of the implementation of these interventions, which will \nreduce  further  degradation  of  the  receiving  environment  due  to  improved  health  and \nsanitary conditions. \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nActivity \n\nImpact/Mitigation Measures \n\n \nImpacts (operation): Well water contamination and sanitary effluent discharge.  \n \nMitigation  Measures  (construction):  Follow  environmental  screening  criteria  and \nstandard design practices. Minimal disturbance to existing vegetation and replanting of \nremoved trees, soil erosion control measures like controlling off-site run-off, reseeding \ndisturbed  areas,  spraying  water  on  disturbed  areas  to  control  dust,  maintenance  of \nconstruction equipment. \n \nIn addition during construction new or existing water supply and sanitation structures \nwill  not  be  located  near  each  other  (at  least  100  feet  apart),  in  flood-prone  areas,  or \ndownhill of pollution sources.   \n \nMitigation Measures (operation): Disposal of septage from sanitation facilities will be in \nan  environmentally  sound  manner  in  accordance  with  national  and  local  codes.  A \nmaintenance  plan  will  be  developed  for  both  well  water  and  sanitation  systems.  The \nsystems will be operated based on sound engineering technical guidelines.    \n \nImpacts (construction): This prototype intervention will not generate negative adverse \nimpacts on the receiving environmental setting in the area, provided care is taken for \nappropriate disposal of construction soil, vegetation, etc., and maximum care is being \ntaken  not  to  disturb  in-stream  habitats  and  buffer  zones.  Implementation  of  this \nprototype  intervention  is  expected  to  be  beneficial  to  the  coastal  resources  in  the \nmunicipality by reducing erosion and consequent river pollution and sedimentation.  \n \nImpacts (operation): Damage to the structure and increased erosion potential. \n  \nMitigation  Measures  (construction):  The  removed  vegetation,  soil,  and  debris  will  be \ndisposed of in an environmentally safe manner in accordance with national and local \ncodes.  \n \nMitigation Measures (operation): Regular inspection and maintenance of the structures \nin accordance with an operation and maintenance plan. \n  \n\nStream bank \nstabilization \n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\nThe municipal environment officer (or equivalent) with the assistance of a Department of \n13. \nEnvironment  and  Natural  Resources  (DENR)  provincial  environmental  and  natural  resource \nofficer and a DENR community environment and natural resource officer will be responsible for \nscreening  the  subprojects  for  environmental  criteria;  preparing  and  implementing  IEEs,  EMP, \nand monitoring plan for category B subprojects; and developing the necessary paperwork for a \nDENR  environmental  clearance  certificate.  The  community  environment  and  natural  resource \nofficer  will  be  responsible  for  overseeing  implementation  of  the  environmental  management \nplan,  take  corrective  action  and  report  environment  information  to  DENR\u2019s  Environment \nManagement Bureau through the DENR provincial environment and natural resources office.   \n\n14.  Monitoring activities will be performed for construction and disposal activities, equipment \nmaintenance activities, water supply systems, mariculture, etc. Cost estimates for component C \nand  D  are  inclusive  of  environmental  mitigation  measures.  The  total  project  cost  includes \nP20,000 per municipality per year for environmental monitoring of project activities, particularly \nfor  components  C  and  D.  The  monitoring  activities,  indicators,  frequencies,  responsibilities, \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n41 \n\nbudget,  and  capacity-building  activities  are  detailed  in  the  IEE  and  updated  for  individual \nsubprojects.  \n\nF. \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\nAt the project feasibility stage, DENR facilitated provincial seminar-workshops in the six \n15. \nproject  provinces.  During  the  workshops,  preliminary  findings  and  recommendations  were \npresented,  and  comments  and  suggestions  received  from  the  participants  who  comprised \nprovincial  and  municipal  officials,  representatives  from  the  national  government  agencies, \nnongovernment  organizations,  people\u2019s  organizations,  and  members  of  academic  institutions. \nDuring appraisal of the Project (10 August\u20137 September 2006), extensive public consultations \nwith stakeholders were held in all project provinces. Meetings were held in Mati, Davao Oriental \n(10 August 2006); Cebu City, Cebu province (14\u201315 August and 7 September 2006); Masbate, \nMasbate  province  (17  August  2006);  Aparri,  Cagayan  province  (22  August  2006);  Subic, \nZambales province (24 August 2006); and Larena, Siquijor province (8 September 2006). The \nstakeholders  included  officials  of  the  participating  local  government  units,  DENR,  and \nDepartment of Agriculture regional offices; provincial government officials; community members; \nand fisherfolk. In all these consultations, the project concept and activities were introduced and \nenvironmental  issues  were  discussed  particularly  with  regard  to  implementation  of  mariculture \nand infrastructure subprojects. The environmental safeguard measures proposed for the Project \nwere accepted by all the participants. \n\nG. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Review Framework \n\n16. \nThe  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  was  developed  to  guide  the \ncommunity  environment  and  natural  resource  officer  in  (i)  screening  interventions  through \nspecific environmental checklists for ensuring compliance with environmental categorization, (ii) \npreparing necessary subproject IEEs, EMPs, and monitoring plans; and (iii) meeting safeguard \nrequirements  of  the  Philippine  Government  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank.  The  detailed \nprocedural requirements are presented in Supplementary Appendix C. \n\nH. \n\nConclusion \n\nThe  Project  is  unlikely  to  cause  any  adverse  environmental  impacts  because  potential \n17. \nnegative impacts are mainly during construction and will be temporary, minor, and localized in \nextent and can be mitigated to acceptable levels. According to the findings of the IEE, a detailed \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  for  the  subprojects  is  not  considered  to  be  warranted.  No \ninterventions/activities  are  proposed  that  can  be  considered  as  environmentally  critical  or \nprojected  to  create  significant  adverse  or  negative  impacts  on  the  environment.  These  will  be \nensured  during  project  implementation  by  following  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework and checklists, and the environmental management and monitoring plan developed \nfor prototype future interventions as specified in the IEE. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nA. \n\nBackground \n\nMITIGATION MEASURES FOR RESOURCE ACCESS RESTRICTION IMPACT  \n\n1. \nThe resource conservation and management initiatives of the Project are likely to affect, \nin the short-term, livelihoods of some people who currently engage in unsustainable practices in \ncoastal  waters  and  watershed  and  mangrove  areas.  Measures  to  mitigate  the  impact  of \nresource  use  discipline  on  people,  who  could  be  affected,  and  the  implementation  and \nmonitoring arrangements are outlined in this appendix. \n\n B. \n\nImpacts and Measures \n\n2.  \nComponent B, integrated coastal resources management (ICRM), will promote adoption \nof ICRM practices that may result in various forms of resource access restrictions, such as (i) \nlimited  use  of  no-take  zones  in  marine  protected  areas,  (ii)  control  of  destructive  fishing  using \ndynamite  and  cyanide,  and  (iii)  limited  use  of  mangroves  and  watersheds  that  will  be \nrehabilitated and managed under the Project. The number and socioeconomic status of people \nwho will be affected by the resource management practices are yet known as the location of no-\ntake zones and scope of unsustainable practices that should be disciplined will be determined \nthrough community processes during the preparation of municipal ICRM plans.  \n\nSpecific measures for mitigating the resource access restrictions and discipline impacts \n3. \nand  improving  incomes  and  livelihoods  of  those  affected  will  be  prepared  and  included  in  the \nICRM plan. All people affected will be equally eligible for mitigation and rehabilitation assistance \nirrespective  of  social  or  economic  standing,  or  any  such  discriminatory  factors.  Mitigation \ninclude  (i)  community-based  watershed  and/or  mangrove  rehabilitation  and \nmeasures \nmanagement  contracts  under  component  B,  and  (ii)  alternative  livelihood  activities  developed \nunder  component  C:  enterprise  development  and \nincome  diversification.  Design  and \nimplementation of the mitigation measures will commence in year 1 of the Project, prior to the \nestablishment  of  no-take  zones,  and  rehabilitation  and  management  of  mangroves  and \nwatersheds; both types of activities commence in years 2 and 3. As a result, people who could \nbe  affected  would  no  longer  need  to  rely  on  unsustainable  practices  and  therefore  the \nanticipated  impact  of  new  ICRM  practices  on  them  would  be  relatively  minor.  Likely  impacts, \ncategories  of  potentially  affected  people,  and  proposed  measures,  and  implementation \nresponsibilities are detailed in Table A9. \n\nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangement \n\n \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities \n\n4. \nThe  Department  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources  (DENR)  will  be  the  Executing \nAgency  for  the  Project.  Mitigation  measures  including  the  livelihood  program  will  be \nimplemented by DENR and Department of Agriculture (DA). DENR and DA will engage project \nmunicipalities in participatory resource assessment, establishment and management of marine \nprotected  areas,  enforcement  of  laws  and  regulations,  and  identification  and  promotion  of \nalternative  livelihoods.  DENR  will  establish  a  project  steering  committee  to  oversee  and \ncoordinate  project  implementation.  DENR  will  also  establish  a  regional  steering  committee  in \neach  of  the  five  project  regions  to  oversee  and  coordinate  project  implementation  within  the \nregion.  The  project  and  regional  steering  committees  will  also  be  responsible  for  compiling \nbaseline data and monitoring data including the inventory of people affected.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\nTable A9: Potential Adverse Impacts of Project Activities and the Required Mitigation Measures \n \n\nActivity \nEstablishment \nof no-take \nzones \n\nLikely Impacts \n\nPotential Affected People \n\nSubsistence fisherfolk \n\nShort Term  \n(i) Reduction in available fishing \nareas; and (ii) difficult access to \nfishing areas if no-take zones \nare located in immediate vicinity \nof coastal communities \n \nMedium to Long Term \nIncreased fish catch in areas \nbordering the no-take zones \n\nControl of \ndestructive \nfishing \n\nRehabilitation \nof existing \nmangroves \nthat are poorly \nmaintained \n\nShort Term  \nReduced fish catch rates for a \nsmall population of coastal \nfisherfolk (less than 5% in case \nof study municipalities) \n \nMedium Term  \nIncreased fish catch, but for a \nsmall population catch may be \nless than before \nShort Term  \n(i) Community enforced ban on \nlogging; and (ii) communities \ncontinue to fish in mangroves, \nundertake crab fattening, and \ncollect propagules \n \nMedium Term  \n(i) Increased fish catch, (ii) \nincreased crab harvest, and (iii) \nincreased propagule harvest \n\nA fraction of the subsistence \nfisherfolk population \n\nCommunities residing adjacent \nto 7,000 hectares (ha) of \nmangroves Population size of \nsuch communities is very small \nas the existing mangrove areas \nare small and scattered in the \nproject area: 1\u201310 ha.

The assessment employed discussions with the relevant national, regional, provincial \nand  municipal  officials, as  well  as  a  review  of  past  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  other \nfunding agencies\u2019 projects implemented by DENR and other implementing agencies.  \n\nimplementing  agencies;  and  adequacy  of \n\n(DENR)\u2014and \n\nB. \n\nAssessment of DENR and the Implementing Agencies \n\nDENR, the Executing Agency, will be responsible for overall management of the Project. \n2. \nThe  project  implementing  agencies  are  the  Department  of  Agriculture  (DA),  DENR,  and  68 \nparticipating municipalities. \n\n3. \nDENR  has  extensive  experience  in  managing  externally  assisted  projects,  including \nthe  previous  projects  were  completed \nseveral  ADB-financed  projects.  While  most  of \nsatisfactorily, DENR performance in recent years was affected by major budget cuts impacting \nproject  implementation. 1  DENR  performance  with  financial  management  of  ADB-financed \nprojects has been satisfactory; no major irregularities have been identified. \n\n4. \nDA  also  has  been  a  major  executing  and  implementing  agency  of  externally  assisted \nprojects  including  15  investment  and  program  loan  projects  of  ADB.  The  overall  performance \nwith ADB-financed projects has been satisfactory and no major financial irregularities have been \nidentified.  \n\n5. \nSince the Government  adopted the Local Government Code in 1991, all funds flow for \nsimilar projects to local government units (LGUs) (municipalities and provinces) are channeled \nthrough the Department of Finance\u2019s Municipal Development Fund Office (MDFO). MDFO has \ndedicated  financial  management  specialists  that  oversee  the  transfer  of  funds  to  local \ngovernments,  fund  utilization,  and  preparation  of  withdrawal  applications.  On  a  number  of \nprojects  in  the  agriculture  and  social  sectors,  ADB  has  worked  with  MDFO  as  a  conduit  for \nchanneling funds to municipal governments; no major irregularities have been reported. \n\nC. \n\nFunds Flow Arrangements \n\n6. \nThe  national  Government  will  provide  part  of  the  loan  and  grant  proceeds  and  its  own \ncounterpart  funds  to  DENR  through  budgetary  transfers  for  expenditures  to  be  incurred  by \nDENR and DA. Part of the loan proceeds and counterpart funds will be released to MDFO for \ntransfer to participating municipalities as a mix of loan and grant in accordance with the National \nGovernment  and  Local  Government  Unit  Cost-Sharing  Policy  of  2003.  The  funds  flow \narrangements are shown in Figure A16. \n\n                                                 \n1   To avoid similar budget cuts, approval of future projects by the Government is subject to preparation of a project -\nspecific budget strategy in accordance with the agency\u2019s overall medium-term public sector expenditure program. \nThe funding strategy outlines yearly funding requirements and source of funds, and is approved by the secretary, \nDepartment of Budget Management. A budget strategy for the Integrated Coastal Resources Management Project \nwas approved in September 2006. \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nDENR  will  open  two  separate  imprest  accounts,  one  for  the  ADB  loan  and  one  for  the \n7. \nGlobal Environment Facility grant, in a commercial bank specifically authorized for this purpose \nby  the  Bangko  Sentral  ng  Plipinas,  on  terms  and  conditions  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  imprest \naccounts  will  be  managed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon by the Government and ADB. The advance to be deposited \nto  each  account  will  be  based  on  an  estimated  6  months  of  the  project  expenditure  or  a \nmaximum  of  10%  of  the  ADB  loan  and  Global  Environment  Facility  grant,  whichever  is  lower. \nApplications  to  replenish  the  accounts,  supported  by  appropriate  documentation,  will  be \nsubmitted  regularly  (preferably  monthly,  but  not  more  than  quarterly)  and/or  whenever  the \naccounts are drawn down by 20% of the initial deposit. The imprest accounts and statements of \nexpenditure will be audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. Similarly, MDFO will open \nand manage an imprest account for channeling ADB loan proceeds to municipal governments.  \n\n8. \nTo  facilitate  project  implementation  in  a  devolved  environment,  DENR  may  agree  to  a \n90-day cash advance facility to DA. DENR will ensure that the DA project unit has the capacity \nto manage the fund. DA will submit its 90-day cash requirements to DENR together with its work \nplan and funding requirements. DENR will monitor and control the transfer of the cash advance, \nand  monthly  replenishment  of  such  cash  advances  will  be  required  with  the  submission  of \nsatisfactory proof of incurred eligible expenditures.   \n\nD.  \n\nAccounting, Financial Reporting, and Auditing Arrangement \n\n9. \nThe  Commission  on  Audit  (COA)  has  developed  a  financial  information  system  for \nforeign-assisted  projects,  which  has  the  following  features:  (i)  application  of  commercial \nmethods of accounting; (ii) a perpetual inventory method; (iii) an improved chart of account and \ncoding system;  (iv)  clear  recording  and  reporting  of  accounting  data  from  LGUs  to  DENR  and \nthe implementing agencies; and (v) generation of accurate and timely financial reports that are \nneeded  by  agency  management,  oversight  agencies,  and  funding  institutions.  The  financial \ninformation  system  runs  on  a \nfor \ncustomization to suit the needs of any project; it is being used by DENR, DA, and MDFO.  \n\nfinancial  accounting  software  platform  with  ability \n\n10.  MDFO  will  use  electronic  National  Government  Accounting  System  (e-NGAS),  which \nhas the following features: (i) data validation to avoid duplication and redundancy; (ii) electronic \nprocessing,  approval  of  journal  entry  voucher,  recording  of  transactions  in  the  general  journal \nand posting to respective general ledger (GL) and subsidiary ledgers (SL); (iii) inclusion of the \nstandard  national  government  accounting  system  chart  of  accounts;  (iv)  new  coding  structure; \n(v)  inventory  costing  for  supplies  and  material;  (vi)  property,  plant  and  equipment  monitoring; \n(vii) keeps track of project cost components, thereby promoting transparency and accountability \nover  government  infrastructures/projects;  (viii)  ensures  reconciliation  of  GL  control  accounts \nwith SL accounts; (ix) strengthen internal control function by requiring the maintenance of SLs \nby the accounting unit of the agency; (x) generates monthly or on demand financial statements \nand  reports;  (xi)  public  infrastructures/reforestation  projects  monitoring;  (xii)  online  query  on \ndocuments and special reports with option to print. \n\n11. \nProject disbursements to municipalities/LGUs through MDFO will be a mix of loans and \ngrants.  The  accounting  policies  and  procedures  of  the  MDFO  are  governed  by  Department  of \nBudget and Management and COA circular 6-87 of 17 August 1987. The circular describes the \naccounting  policies  and  procedures,  the  chart  of  accounts,  and  accounting  entries.  MDFO \nproduces separate financial reports for each project, accounting for both subloans and grants.   \n\n\f \n\n \n\nE. \n\nStaffing \n\nAppendix 16       57   \n\n \n\n12. \nDENR\u2019s Accounting Section comprises qualified accounting graduates and is headed by \na chief accountant. The accounting, disbursement, and record-keeping functions are segregated \nand  independent  of  each  other.  DENR  relies  on  statements  of  expenditure  submitted  by \nimplementing  agencies  to  release  funds.  DENR  does  not  have  sufficient  staff  to  review  the \nfinancial  management  arrangements  of  the  implementing  agencies  but  relies  on  COA \nverification and approval of statements of expenditure. To ensure sound financial management, \nnecessary adjustments will be made within the existing staff resources of the DENR Accounting \nSection  to  establish  a  unit  devoted  to  the  project  requirements.  Keeping  in  view  the  large \nnumber  of  municipalities  receiving  support  from  the  Project,  additional  dedicated  accounting \nstaff will be provided at MDFO. \n\nF. \n\nReporting and Auditing  \n\n13. \nDA and MDFO will submit standard financial management reports on a quarterly basis to \nDENR.  DENR  will  prepare  a  consolidated  report  adding  its  own  financial  reports.  The  reports \nwill  be  in  format  acceptable  to  ADB  and  will  be  used  for  monitoring  project  progress  by  the \nimplementing  agencies,  i.e.,  DENR,  DA,  and  municipalities.  DENR  will  also  prepare  annual \nconsolidated project financial statements for the Project. COA will audit and render an opinion \non the DENR financial statements. MDFO will prepare a separate consolidated financial report \n(CFR) which pertains only to the funds that the MDFO will administer and the accounts are with \nMDFO.    The  reports  will  be  in  format  acceptable  to  ADB  and  will  be  used  for  monitoring  of \nproject  progress  by  implementing  agencies  i.e  DENR,  DA,  and  municipalities.    The  CFR \nprepared by MDFO exclusively for the sub-projects will be audited by COA, which will render an \nopinion  thereon.    Audited  CFR  will  be  submitted  by  MDFO  directly  to  ADB,  with  a  copy  to \nDENR. \n\nG. \n\nConclusions \n\n14. \nThe  appraisal  mission\u2019s  assessments  and  review  of  DENR  and  the  implementing \nagencies\u2019  track  record  in  implementing  externally  funded  projects  shows  that  implementation \narrangements for the Project are adequate to ensure that loan and grant funds will be utilized \neffectively  for  the  intended  purpose.  The  mission  incorporated  additional  features  and \nmechanisms  such  as  adoption  of  an  ecogovernance  framework  into  the  project  design  for \ngreater municipal and community transparency and accountability. \n\n \n\n\fGlobal \nEnvironment \nFacility\n\nMunicipal \nDevelopment \nFund Office \n(MDFO) \n\n58 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nAsian \nDevelopment \nBank\n\nFigure A16: Funds Flow Diagram \n\nDepartment of \nFinance \n\nDepartment of \nEnvironment \nand Natural \nResources \n(DENR) \n\nMarine/Costal \nResearch \nInstitutions \n\nDepartment of \nAgriculture \n(DA)  \n\nIntegrated \nCoastal \nResources \nManagement \nCenters \n\nRegional \nDENR Office \n\nRegional DA \nOffice \n\nProvincial \nDENR Office \n\nEnterprise \nDevelopment \nUnit\n\nMunicipal \nDENR Office \n\nMunicipal \nGovernments\n\nCommunities \n\nDA = Department of Agriculture, DENR = Department of Environment and Natural Resources. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Department of Environment and Natural Resources. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 17       59   \n\n \n\nFINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe  Project  will \n\nfacilitate  sustainable  management  of  coastal \n\n1. \nresources  by \n(i) strengthening the overall policy and legal framework; (ii) building capacities of communities; \ncivil  society  groups;  and  national,  provincial,  and  municipal  government  institutions;  (iii) \nundertaking  participatory  resource  use  planning  and  management,  biodiversity  conservation, \nand resource enhancement; and (iv) providing social and environmental services and facilities. \nBy reducing the decline in quality and productive capacity of coastal habitat, the Project will lead \nto  direct  and  indirect  economic  benefits  including  improved  fish  catch,  reduced  erosion  in \nforeshore  and  upland  areas,  and  increased  local  and  global  use  values.1 The  development  of \nalternative  and  supplemental  incomes,  through  viable  livelihood  and  microenterprises,  will \nrelieve  pressure  on  the  coastal  resources.  The  progressive  population management  programs \nin the coastal barangays, with education on reproductive health the linkage between population \nand environmental quality, will reduce future population pressure on coastal resources. \n\nB. \n\nMethodology \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years;  the  economic  life  of  the  project \n\n2. \ninterventions is expected to be 20 years. \n\n3. \nExchange  Rate  and  Discount  Rate.  For  this  analysis,  the  prevailing  interbank \nexchange rate of P52.2/$1.0 is used. A discount rate of 12% is used to ascertain the net present \nvalue and also as a cutoff point for the economic internal rate of return (EIRR). \n\nPrice Assumptions. Financial benefits and costs are estimated in constant 2006 terms. \n4. \nFinancial  prices  are  based  on  findings  of  the  surveys  undertaken  during  the  feasibility  study. \nThe analysis uses a domestic price numeraire where the shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) \nis used to adjust the prices of traded commodities to domestic levels. The SERF is assumed to \nbe  1.2,  which  is  the  standard  SERF  for  the  Philippines  as  indicated  in  the  Government\u2019s \nInvestment  Coordination  Committee\u2019s  Project  Evaluation  Procedures  and  Guidelines.  The \nvalues of coastal resources and products from livelihood activities are taken at the border price \nand their economic values derived by adjusting these with the SERF. To take into account local \nunemployment and underemployment, labor costs are shadow priced at 0.61. \n\n5. \nNatural  Resource  Values.  The  Project  will  undertake  an  integrated  approach  to \nmanaging coastal resources, which will imply a focus on the coastal resources as well as upland \nresources such as watersheds. Literature on valuation of these resources in the Philippines is \nabundant  and  a  detailed  discussion  is  presented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  The  main \nresource  values  associated  with  the  coral  reefs  originate  from  fisheries  for  local  consumption, \nerosion  control,  local  use  (tourism  with  on-site  residence),  and  global  use  (fisheries  for  live \nexport,  off-site  tourism,  and  aesthetic/biodiversity  value).  The  main  benefits  from  mangroves \ninclude  wood  use,  fisheries,  erosion  control,  waste  treatment,  recreation,  and  habitat/refugia \n(biodiversity). As the Government has banned cutting of mangroves, the analysis excludes any \nbenefits  expected  from  wood  use.  The  resource  use  values  for  erosion  control  and  waste \ntreatment  have  not  been  established  for  the  Philippines;  however,  the  literature  shows  these \nhave potentially high values. For the purpose of this analysis, the values for erosion control are \nconservatively  estimated  at  10%  and  waste  treatment  at  5%  of  estimated  values  for  other \ncountries.  The  wood  and  soil  erosion  abatement  are  primary  benefits  from  the  watersheds. \nRecent estimates estimate that 1 hectare of mature plantation can annually prevent loss of 8.58 \n\n                                                 \n1   Most commonly documented local and global use values include tourism, recreation, and habitat/refugia. \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 17 \n\ntons  of  soil,2 which  is  estimated  at    P810/ton  in  2006  terms.

During the feasibility study, interviews and focus group discussions \n6. \nwere  conducted  with  entrepreneurs  and  key  informants  in  the  study  municipalities,  which \nprovide \nrepresentative \nsetting  up  enterprise  models \nlivelihood/microenterprise schemes. The range of representative activities include (i) land-based \n(e.g., production of organic fertilizer, fiber and coir dust, rope and twine, geotextile nets, as well \nas  raising  of  swine);  (ii)  fishery-related  (such  as  tilapia  culture  in  earthen  ponds,  salt  making, \ndried  seaweed  production,  fish-cage  culture,  and  dried  salted  fish  production;  and  (iii) \nmicroenterprise  (e.g.,  soap  making,  and  mushroom  culture).  The  selection  of \nthese \nrepresentative  enterprises,  aside  from  being  financially  viable,  takes  into  account  the  limited \nfinancial, technical, and entrepreneurial capabilities of fisherfolk. \n\n1,060,000 \n3,860,000 \n3,793,000 \n974,000 \n \n \n\nthe  basis \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nfor \n\n810\n\n7. \nThe models for the enterprises span over 6 years, which provides for an establishment \nperiod  of  1  year  and  an  operation  period  of  5  years.  The  useful  life  of  the  structures  such  as \nsheds and boats are assumed to be 6 years, while that for tools and other capital investment is \n3 years.  \n\nThe working capital requirement for the enterprises is estimated on the basis of the costs \n8. \nrequired  for  initiating  production  operation,  and  depending  on  the  type  of  the  enterprise  the \nrequirement is assumed to range between 1 and 3 months. \n\n C. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n9. \nProject  Coverage  and  Benefit  Area.  The  Project  will  cover  68  municipalities  in  six \nprovinces  and  will  build  the  capacity  of  600  national,  regional,  provincial,  and  municipal \ngovernment staff.

The  Project  will  also \nprovide social and environmental infrastructure in 136 coastal barangays and raise awareness \non  population  management  in  the  68  municipalities.  Moreover,  the  Project  will  facilitate \nestablishment  of  680  enterprises  to  provide  alternate  and  supplemental  livelihood,  which  will \ndirectly benefit 6,800 fisherfolk. \n\n10. \nDuring  the  feasibility  study,  six  municipalities  were  studied  in  detail  and  sufficient \ninformation  on  the  resources  was  obtained  through  secondary  sources  for  a  seventh \nmunicipality.  In  absence  of  detailed  information  for  the  remaining  municipalities,  the  analysis \nwas undertaken for seven municipalities with the benefits are based on the resources available \nwithin these municipalities and the overall project costs are taken on a pro rata basis.  \n\nIn the study municipalities, the data available from the municipal coastal databases and \n11. \nthe  assessments  undertaken  through  the  feasibility  study  are  used  to  classify  the  coastal \nresources on the basis of their habitat quality/condition.

The  Integrated  Coastal  Resources  Management  Project,  Final  Report. \nManila. \n \nThe Project will establish 50 marine protected areas (MPAs), each of which on average \n12. \nwill include a no-take zone of 100 hectares (1 km2), or 5,000 hectares (50 km2) in aggregate. For \nthe purpose of this analysis, the no-take zones are assumed to be coral reef areas of fair habitat \nquality/condition and proportionally divided between the municipalities. Similarly, the Project will \nreforest  2,000  hectares  of  mangroves  and  4,000  hectares  of  watersheds,  and  enrich  7,000 \nhectares of existing mangrove plantations and 3,000 hectares of watersheds. For the purpose of \nthis analysis, the livelihood activities and microenterprises are also assumed to be proportionally \ndistributed between the study municipalities. \n\n0.10 \n- \n0.05 \n0.03 \n17.20 \n2.60 \n19.98 \n\n13. \nQuantified Benefits. In the without-project scenario, the productivity of the coral reefs is \nassumed  to  decline  at  a  rate  of  2%  per  annum;  the  historic  rate  of  decline  recorded  for  the \nPhilippines. 3  While  the  Project  anticipates  stopping  the  decline  and  significantly  improving \nproductivity,  the  analysis  conservatively  assumes  that  in  the  with-project  scenario,  the  decline \nrate  in  coral  reef  productivity  will  only  be  halved  in  the  participating  municipalities.  In  case  of \nMPAs,  the  without-project  benefits  are  assured  to  follow  the  pattern  for  coral  reefs  in  fair \ncondition.  Given that the no-take zones will be a fraction of the municipal waters within each of \nthe municipalities and will be the focus of more intense activities, the productivity gains from the \n\n                                                 \n3  McAllister,  D.  E.  1988.  Environmental,  Economic  and  Social  Costs  of  Coral  Reef  Destruction  in  the  Philippines. \n\nManila.  (Galaxea 7: pp. 161\u2013178). \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 17 \n\nno-take  zones  are  anticipated  to  increase  at  10%  per  year  or  the  productivity  to  triple  in  20 \nyears. 4 However,  the  analysis  conservatively  assumes  that  productivity  will  double  over  20 \nyears. \n\nIn the case of the mangroves, resource values and productivity are expected to decline \n14. \nat  a  rate  of  1.6%  per  annum,  the  historic  decline  rate  for  the  Philippines.  With  enrichment \nplanting  and  effective  enforcement  of  regulations  through  community  participation,  the \nproductivity of mangroves is anticipated to improve in the participating municipalities. However, \nfor  the  purpose  of  this  analysis,  the  annual  decline  in  mangrove  productivity  is  conservatively \nassumed to be reduced to 1.0% in the with-project scenario. In addition, the areas of mangroves \nreestablished with community participation are assumed to reach full productivity by year 5 and \nthereafter productivity will be maintained through continued community management. \n\n15.  With  the  ban  on  logging  in  the  watersheds,  in  the  without-project  scenario  the  soil \nerosion abatement capacity in the partially denuded forest areas is assumed to be maintained. \nIn the with-project scenario, rehabilitation in the form of timber stand improvement is assumed \nto  recover  the  soil  erosion  abatement  capacity  by  one  third  over  5  years.  For  the  completely \ndenuded  forest  areas,  soil  erosion  increases  with  time;  however,  in  absence  of  data  on  the \ntrends  in  soil  erosion,  the  analysis  assumes  that  erosion  levels  are  steady.  In  the  with-project \nscenario,  the  reforested  watersheds  are  assumed  to  reach  their  full  soil  erosion  abatement \ncapacity by year 5. \n\n16. \nIn  case  of  the  livelihood  activities  and  microenterprises,  the  analysis  assumes  that  all \nenterprises  will  be  incremental.  While  the  enterprise  development  activities  are  anticipated  to \ncontinue beyond project implementation, the analysis conservatively considers only enterprises \nto be established during project implementation. \n\n17. \nNonquantifiable Benefits. Apart from the benefits discussed in the preceding sections, \na  number  of  benefits  cannot  be  readily  quantified,  e.g.,  (i)  improved  nation-wide  coastal \nresources  management  resulting  from  improved  policy  and  legal  framework  and  institutional \nstrengthening  of  Department  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources,  Department  of \nAgriculture\u2019s Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, and municipal local government units; \n(ii)  improved  coastal  resources  management  in  neighboring  municipalities  resulting  from  the \ninformation,  education,  and  communication  campaigns  in  the  project  area;  (iii)  improved \nrevenues  for  the  local  government  units  through  introduction  of  user  fees;  (iv)  improved \necological  governance  resulting  from  empowerment  of  coastal  communities  in  resources \nmanagement  and  project  implementation;  (v)  reduced  cost  and  improved  quality  of  social  and \nenvironment-related  infrastructure  resulting  from  greater  community  participation  in  planning, \ndesign, and construction activities; and (vi) improved community welfare resulting from provision \nof social and environmental services and infrastructure. \n\nD. \n\nAssessment of Financial Returns from Livelihood Enterprises \n\n18. \nThe  results  of  the  financial  analysis  are  detailed  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  The \nresults show that the financial rates of return (FIRR) for the enterprises are anticipated to range \nfrom 70% to 200%. Depending on the size of the enterprise, the annual income net of cash and \n                                                 \n4  The  benefits  from  establishing  MPAs  were  first  documented  by  the  Silliman  University  Marine  Laboratory  at  the \nSumilon Island fish sanctuary,  which  was established  in  1974. This initial  experiment on  coral reef management, \nwhich prohibited all types of fishing activities on a portion of the island over 8 years, allowed researchers to monitor \nand  collect  data  on  the  regenerative  capacity  of  the  reef  under  an  effective  management  scheme.  Observed \nbenefits included (i) improved coral reef substrate condition; (ii) tripling of individual fish abundance per 500 square \nmeters with the most significant increase among fish targeted by fishers; and (iii) substantial increases in yearly fish \ncatch  to  fishers  on  the  Sumilon  Island  reef,  not  in  the  sanctuary,  from  about  14  tons/square  kilometer/year  to \nalmost 36 tons/square kilometer/year or a regeneration rate of about 12%/year (Russ and Alcala 1996). \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 17       63   \n\n \n\nin-kind  costs  ranges  from  P8,500  to  P102,000.  Returns  to  labor,  which  are  calculated  by \ndividing revenue, less all costs except labor, by the amount of labor required, are significantly \nhigher than the minimum wage rate applied in the rural areas for agriculture-related activities. \n\nLivelihood and microenterprise schemes typically exhibit very high FIRR values (mainly \n19. \ndue to low capital investment and production costs relative to high revenues), which in turn are \nhighly volatile to changes in output prices and production cost. This is confirmed by the results \nof  the  sensitivity  analysis  conducted  on  the  FIRR  values  of  each  livelihood/microenterprise \nscheme. The results of the sensitivity analysis also indicate that the FIRR values of the projects \nare  more  sensitive  to  decreases  in  output  price  or  revenue  (i.e.,  sensitivity  indicator  ranging \nfrom 1.84 to 4.22) than to increases in costs (i.e., sensitivity indicator ranging from 1.21 to 3.51). \n\nE. \n\nAssessment of Economic Returns \n\n20. \nProject  Investment  and  Recurrent  Costs.  All  costs  are  in  constant  2006  terms. \nInvestment  costs  are  net  of  price  contingencies,  interest  during  construction,  and  taxes  and \nduties. Foreign cost content of the costs was adjusted by the SERF, while the local component \nwas  taken  at  its  full  value.  While  the  scope  of  benefits  from  the  policy  aspects,  institutional \ndevelopment, capacity building, and community development may not be limited to the project \narea, the analysis takes into account costs of all the project activities. To assess returns to study \nmunicipalities, the costs are derived on a pro rata basis. \n\n21. \nEconomic  Worth.  The  economic  viability  was  undertaken  based  on  the  calculated \nstream of net incremental costs and quantified benefits attributable to the project activities over \n20 years. The EIRR was assessed for the study municipalities and extrapolated for the Project \nwith the assumption that the study municipalities are representative of the Project as a whole. \nThe EIRR for the study municipalities is estimated at about 16.1% and the economic net present \nvalue at a discount rate of 12% is estimated at P54.9 million. The Project EIRR is also estimated \nat about 16.1% and the economic net present value at P509.8 million. \n\n22. \nSensitivity  of  the  Project\u2019s  anticipated  economic  worth  to  critical  factors  was  analyzed \nand  the  results  show  that  the  Project  is  anticipated  to  remain  economically  viable  at  cost \noverruns  of  up  to  34.5%  and  reduction  in  incremental  benefits  of  up  to  20.8%.  Similarly,  the \nProject  is  anticipated  to  remain  economically  viable  at  shortfalls  in  incremental  fish  catch  by \n103.0%,  incremental  coral  reef  benefits  by  91.0%,  and  incremental  mangrove  benefits  by \n35.6%. \n\nF. \n\nDistribution Analysis and Poverty Impact Assessment \n\n23. \nTable  A17.3  summarizes  the  poverty  impact  analysis  and  distribution  analysis  for  the \nstudy  municipalities.  The  net  economic  benefits  (difference  in  net  present  value  of  economic \nand  financial  benefits)  are  estimated  to  be  about  P59.0  million  of  which  55%  are  expected  to \naccrue  directly  to  the  fisherfolk,  while  another  31%  are  expected  to  accrue  to  the  coastal \ncommunities.  The  gains  to  the  economy  accruing  from  the  global  use values  are estimated  at \nP15.9  million,  which  offset  the  net  resource  outflow  of  P7.5  million  from  the  Government. \nApportioning  the  gains  between  the  poor  and  those  living  above  the  poverty  line  within  the \nfisherfolk  and  the  coastal  communities,  and  assuming  that  Government  tax  revenues  will  be \nevenly expended among the population, the Project yields a poverty impact ratio of 0.71. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 17 \n\nTable A17.3: Poverty Impact and Distribution Analysis of Project Returns \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDistribution of Gains and Losses  \n\n Benefit/Cost  \n\n Financial \nPresent \nValue a  \n\nEconomic \nPresent \nValue a  \n\n Net \nEconomic \nBenefit \n\n \nFisherfolk \n\nCoastal \nCommunity \n\nGov\u2019t and \nEconomy \n\nOverall \n\n Incremental Benefits (P million)  \n Fisheries Value: Legal \n Fisheries Value: Illegal \n Erosion Control: Upland  \n Erosion Control: Foreshore  \n Waste Treatment  \n Local Use Value  \n Global Use Value  \n Livelihood Enterprises  \n Incremental Costs (P million)  \n Implementation Costs: Nonlabor  \n Implementation Costs: Labor  \n\n \n71.60\n(27.33)\n0.06\n40.74\n39.24\n10.92\n79.34\n15.80\n\n \n85.92\n(32.79)\n0.07\n48.89\n47.09\n13.10\n95.21\n18.95\n\n(145.10)\n(16.21)\n\n(138.96)\n(8.63)\n\n \n14.32\n(5.47)\n0.01\n8.15\n7.85\n2.18\n15.87\n3.16\n\n6.15\n7.59\n\n \n14.32\n(5.47)\n\n3.16\n\n7.59\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n0.01 \n8.15 \n7.85 \n2.18 \n \n \n \n \n \n\n15.87\n\n6.15\n\n(0.39)\n(1.42)\n1.00\n\n(1.97)\n(7.10)\n(2.58)\n(23.04)\n(30.91)\n3.47\n\n(2.36)\n(8.52)\n(1.57)\n(36.71)\n(17.24)\n62.48\n\n \n Enterprise Investment Costs  \n Enterprise Operating Costs: Nonlabor \n Enterprise Operating Costs: Labor  \n Recurrent Costs: Nonlabor  \n Recurrent Costs: Labor  \n Net Present Value (P million)  \n Gains and Losses (P million)  \n Proportion of the Poor (%) b, c  \n Net Benefits for the Poor (P million) \n Poverty Impact Ratio  \n( ) = negative, Gov\u2019t = Government. \na At a discount rate of 12%. \nb Poverty incidence among fisherfolk and coastal communities is based on surveys undertaken by feasibility study. \nc The national poverty incidence as reported by the Philippines Institute of Development Sciences for 2002. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.
