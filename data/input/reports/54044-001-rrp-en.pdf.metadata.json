Enterprise Fund IV L.P in Viet Nam. \n \n2. \nMekong  Enterprise  Fund  IV  L.P.  (MEF  IV,  the  fund)  is  a  private  equity  (PE)  fund \nestablished  as  a  Cayman  Islands  exempted  limited  partnership  with  an  expected  fund  size  of \n$250 million.1 [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in \nADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n\n \n\n3. \nMEF  IV  is  expected  to  provide  growth  capital  to  10  to  14  mainly  privately  owned \ncompanies,  including  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs),  operating  primarily  in  the \nconsumer,  education,  health  care,  and  financial  services  sectors  in  Viet  Nam. 2  Companies \noperating  in  these  sectors  often  lack  access  to  affordable  growth  capital  given  limited  equity \nfinancing sources in Viet Nam, and challenges in accessing traditional bank financing without the \nhard assets to pledge as collateral. MEF IV is expected to invest in family-owned and/or managed \ncompanies  that  require  assistance  in  modernizing  business  practices  (including  by  adopting \ndigital  technology),  improving  environmental,  social  and  governance  (ESG)  standards,  and \nstrengthening management  capacity  through trainings  and  new  hires.  The  Asian  Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) proposed investment in MEF IV will, therefore, help improve access to financing for \nSMEs and deepen the capital markets in Viet Nam, thereby supporting the growth of the private \nsector and the emerging class of entrepreneurs.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FUND \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n \nA. \n \n4. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n5. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \n6. \nInvestment identification. ADB was an investor in Mekong Enterprise Fund (MEF I) and \nMekong Enterprise Fund II (MEF II) and identified the current proposed investment through this \nongoing  relationship.    [This  information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to \ndisclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n7. \nThe  proposed  investment  in  MEF  IV  will  enable  ADB  to  support  the  growth  of  well-\nmanaged SMEs in Viet Nam. Most of these SMEs lack the asset base to qualify for traditional \nfinancing  from  banks,  which  tend  to  favor  large  corporates  and  businesses  that  are  better \npositioned  to  pledge  hard  assets  against  loans.  The  growing  PE  market  in  Viet  Nam  has \nconsequently emerged as a critical source of growth  capital especially for SMEs, which play a \nvital  role  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economic  development.  For  example,  SMEs  constitute  98%  of  all \nenterprises in Viet Nam, account for about 40% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and contribute \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n\n \n\n1   [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the exception  to  disclosure in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\n2   A climate change target amount cannot be specified as this is an equity investment into a fund (as opposed to a \ndirect equity investment into a company) and hence, the composition of the underlying investee companies is not yet \nknown. \n\n\f2 \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\nto 50% of employment. 3 By investing in MEF IV, ADB will be able to support  sectors such as \neducation, health care and financial services that can generate strong developmental outcomes \nin Viet Nam.  \n \nB. \n \n8. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n9. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n10.  MEF IV looks to invest in high growth, consumption-driven companies in Viet Nam that \nare benefitting from an economy that has grown at an average compound annual growth rate of \n6.1% from 2010 to 2018. In 2018, Viet Nam\u2019s GDP growth rate reached 7.1%, one of the highest \nrates  in  Asia. 4 Viet  Nam  is  expected  to  continue  generating  strong  growth  for  the  foreseeable \nfuture driven mainly by: \n\n [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nRising  middle-class.  Viet  Nam  has  a  rapidly  emerging  middle  class,  which \ncurrently accounts for 13% of the population. 5 The World Bank expects Viet Nam\u2019s \nmiddle class to reach 26% of the population by 2026 and 50% of the population by \nas early as 2035. 6  \nPrivate sector growth. The number of companies in Viet Nam has increased from \napproximately  40,000  in  the  year  2000  to  nearly  715,000  by  the  end  of  2018, \nmainly driven by the expansion of the private sector.  7 Meanwhile, the number of \nforeign owned companies in Viet Nam has reached more than 16,000 by the end \nof 2017 (see footnote 7).  \nA  globally  integrated  economy.  The  Vietnamese  government  has  been \nimplementing  a  series  of  wide-ranging  regulatory  changes  and  reforms  directed \ntowards integrating Viet Nam with the global economy. Viet Nam already shares \nthe  top  rank  in  Southeast  Asia  with  Singapore  for  memberships  in  bilateral  and \nmultilateral free trade agreements. 8  \nPolitical stability. Viet Nam\u2019s stable political system has been ranked second only \nto Singapore among countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China by the World Bank. 9  \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n \nC. \n \n11. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. 10, 11 \n\n \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n3  P.

MEF  IV  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  reports  and  audited \nannual financial statements, an overview of the portfolio with brief information on each portfolio \ncompany\u2019s financial performance and valuation, an annual development effectiveness monitoring \nreport, and an annual environmental and social monitoring report (ESMS). ADB will review this \ninformation  to  ensure  that  MEF  IV  provides  the  required  information  and  clarification.  If  the \ninformation received raises issues that could impair the value of ADB\u2019s investment in the fund, \nADB could decide to put the fund on a watch list for more frequent review and closer attention. \n \nD. \n \nPrivate  sector  development.  ADB\u2019s  investment  in  MEF  IV  is  expected  to  encourage \n25. \nprivate  sector  investments  in  Viet  Nam  from  other  like-minded  institutional  investors.  ADB\u2019s \nparticipation  is  also  aimed  to  promote  sustainable  operations  and  governance  best  practices \nacross  investee  companies  of  the  fund,  and  through  a  demonstration  effect,  set  standards  for \nother  Vietnamese  corporates  to  emulate.  By  assisting  in  the  growth  of  the  fund\u2019s  investee \ncompanies, ADB\u2019s investment can also promote the benefits of PE as a funding option. \n \n26. \nCapital mobilization and strategy validation. ADB\u2019s participation is expected to attract \nadditional institutional capital and allow the fund to reach its target size. ADB\u2019s investment in the \nfund is also expected to help MEF IV achieve a diversified, well-balanced institutional investor \nbase for the fund. In addition, ADB\u2019s participation will provide validation of the fund\u2019s strategy, and \nits commercial and developmental attributes. \n \n27.  Gender  inclusiveness.  ADB\u2019s  gender  additionality  is  expected  to  see  Mekong  Capital \nbecome a more gender inclusive investment advisor through a more gender inclusive work force \nwith a more women-friendly policy environment.  \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n28. \nSetting standards. ADB will provide assistance to MEF IV to enhance and continuously \nimplement its ESMS. The enhanced ESMS will incorporate ADB SPS (2009) requirements in the \ninvestment screening, impact assessment, monitoring and reporting phases. In addition, ADB will \nseek to provide oversight on governance and issues relating to potential conflicts of interest as a \nmember of MEF IV\u2019s advisory committee. \n \n29. \nfinancing directly to portfolio companies to help them grow. \n\nCo-financing opportunities.

The  proposed  investment  in  MEF  IV  aligns  strongly \nwith operational priorities outlined in ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. 18 These include: (i) addressing poverty \nand  reducing  inequalities  by  generating  quality jobs  to  support  inclusive growth for  all;  and  (ii) \naccelerating progress in gender equality. Strategy 2030 also supports expanding private sector \noperations,  including  expanding  regional  reach  through  PE  funds,  supporting  greater  financial \ninclusion,  strengthening  the  finance  sector  in  capital  markets,  and  widening  geographical \ncoverage. \n \n40. \nConsistency with country strategy. The proposed investment is consistent with ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for Viet Nam, 2016-2020, which focuses on: (i) promoting job creation \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n18 ADB.  2018.

The  proposed \ninvestment  in  MEF  IV  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Operations  Plan  and  its \nsubsequent  review  in  2017,  which  prioritize  improved  access  to  capital  markets  and  regional \ncooperation  and  integration. 20  The  investment  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Education  Sector \nOperational  Plan,  which  promotes  quality  of  education. 21 Mekong  Capital\u2019s  current  and  past \ninvestments include the following companies in the education sector in Viet Nam: Yola (provider \nof  English  training  and  academic  test  preparation)  and  Vietnam  Australia  International  School \n(provider  of  bi-lingual  K-12  education).  In  addition,  the  proposed  investment  is  consistent  with \nADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Private Sector Operations, which focuses on using various products, \nincluding PE funds, to deploy and mobilize equity capital to support a portfolio of SMEs in realizing \ntheir expansion plans. 22  \n\n \n\n \n\n [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n42. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. 23 \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  to  be  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \n\n \nA. \n \n43. \nStatement (SPS) 2009. 24 \n \n44. \nCategory  FI.

Mekong  Capital\u2019s  existing  ESMS  requires  the  fund  to  screen,  assess,  and  address \nenvironmental and social risks of proposed investee companies and obliges portfolio companies \nto  operate  in  accordance  with  applicable  national  laws  and  regulations,  and  to  implement  any \ncorrective action plans. The ESMS prohibits the fund from investing in any potential investment \nthat may  be  categorized  as  A  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement or  indigenous  peoples \n(and will be revised so that it is clear that such categorization is in accordance with ADB\u2019s SPS). \nFurthermore,  ADB  is  negotiating  the  right  to  be  exempted  from  contributing  capital  to  any \nproposed  investment  classified  as  B  against  SPS  requirements  on  involuntary  resettlement  or \nindigenous peoples. Mekong Capital has committed to enhancing its ESMS to satisfy ADB by: (i) \nincorporating  ADB\u2019s  Prohibited  Investment  Activities  List  and  ADB  Category  A  criteria  in  its \n\n19 ADB.  2016.
