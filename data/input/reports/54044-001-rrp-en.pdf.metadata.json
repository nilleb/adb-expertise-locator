THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $20,000,000 in Mekong Enterprise Fund IV L.P in Viet Nam. \n \n2.  Mekong  Enterprise  Fund  IV  L.P.  (MEF  IV,  the  fund)  is  a  private  equity  (PE)  fund \nestablished as a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership with an expected fund size of \n$250 million.1 [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in \nADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n3.  MEF  IV  is  expected  to  provide  growth  capital  to  10  to  14  mainly  privately  owned \ncompanies, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), operating primarily in the \nconsumer, education, health care, and financial services sectors in Viet Nam. 2 Companies \noperating in these sectors often lack access to affordable growth capital given limited equity \nfinancing sources in Viet Nam, and challenges in accessing traditional bank financing without the \nhard assets to pledge as collateral. MEF IV is expected to invest in family-owned and/or managed \ncompanies that require assistance in modernizing business practices (including by adopting \ndigital  technology),  improving  environmental,  social  and  governance  (ESG)  standards,  and \nstrengthening management capacity through trainings and new hires. The Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) proposed investment in MEF IV will, therefore, help improve access to financing for \nSMEs and deepen the capital markets in Viet Nam, thereby supporting the growth of the private \nsector and the emerging class of entrepreneurs.  \n \nII.  THE FUND \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n4.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n5.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \n6.  Investment identification. ADB was an investor in Mekong Enterprise Fund (MEF I) and \nMekong Enterprise Fund II (MEF II) and identified the current proposed investment through this \nongoing relationship.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to \ndisclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n7.  The proposed investment in MEF IV will enable ADB to support the growth of well-\nmanaged SMEs in Viet Nam. Most of these SMEs lack the asset base to qualify for traditional \nfinancing from banks, which tend to favor large corporates and businesses that are better \npositioned to pledge hard assets against loans. The growing PE market in Viet Nam has \nconsequently emerged as a critical source of growth capital especially for SMEs, which play a \nvital  role  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economic  development.  For  example,  SMEs constitute  98%  of  all \nenterprises in Viet Nam, account for about 40% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and contribute \n \n1  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n2  A climate change target amount cannot be specified as this is an equity investment into a fund (as opposed to a \ndirect equity investment into a company) and hence, the composition of the underlying investee companies is not yet \nknown. ", "2 \nto 50% of employment.3 By investing in MEF IV, ADB will be able to support  sectors such as \neducation, health care and financial services that can generate strong developmental outcomes \nin Viet Nam.  \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n8.   [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n9.   [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n10.  MEF IV looks to invest in high growth, consumption-driven companies in Viet Nam that \nare benefitting from an economy that has grown at an average compound annual growth rate of \n6.1% from 2010 to 2018. In 2018, Viet Nam\u2019s GDP growth rate reached 7.1%, one of the highest \nrates in Asia.4 Viet Nam is expected to continue generating strong growth for the foreseeable \nfuture driven mainly by: \n(i)  Rising middle-class. Viet Nam has a rapidly emerging middle class, which \ncurrently accounts for 13% of the population.5 The World Bank expects Viet Nam\u2019s \nmiddle class to reach 26% of the population by 2026 and 50% of the population by \nas early as 2035.6  \n(ii)  Private sector growth. The number of companies in Viet Nam has increased from \napproximately 40,000 in the year 2000 to nearly 715,000 by the end of 2018, \nmainly driven by the expansion of the private sector. 7 Meanwhile, the number of \nforeign owned companies in Viet Nam has reached more than 16,000 by the end \nof 2017 (see footnote 7).  \n(iii)  A  globally  integrated  economy.  The  Vietnamese  government  has  been \nimplementing a series of wide-ranging regulatory changes and reforms directed \ntowards integrating Viet Nam with the global economy. Viet Nam already shares \nthe top rank in Southeast Asia with Singapore for memberships in bilateral and \nmultilateral free trade agreements.8  \n(iv)  Political stability. Viet Nam\u2019s stable political system has been ranked second only \nto Singapore among countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China by the World Bank.9  \n \nC.

The Assistance \n \n21.  ADB intends to make an equity investment of up to $20 million in Mekong Enterprise Fund \nIV L.P, representing 8% of the expected fund size. ADB\u2019s proposed investment will not exceed \n25% of the fund\u2019s total committed capital and will not result in ADB being the single largest investor \nin the fund. \n \n \n12  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n13  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n14  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n15  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n16  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n ", "4 \nB.

[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].17 \n  \n24.  Reporting arrangements. MEF IV will provide ADB with quarterly reports and audited \nannual financial statements, an overview of the portfolio with brief information on each portfolio \ncompany\u2019s financial performance and valuation, an annual development effectiveness monitoring \nreport, and an annual environmental and social monitoring report (ESMS). ADB will review this \ninformation to ensure that MEF IV provides the required information and clarification. If the \ninformation received raises issues that could impair the value of ADB\u2019s investment in the fund, \nADB could decide to put the fund on a watch list for more frequent review and closer attention. \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n25.  Private sector development. ADB\u2019s investment in MEF IV is expected to encourage \nprivate sector investments in Viet Nam from other like-minded institutional investors. ADB\u2019s \nparticipation is also aimed to promote sustainable operations and governance best practices \nacross investee companies of the fund, and through a demonstration effect, set standards for \nother Vietnamese corporates to emulate. By assisting in the growth of the fund\u2019s investee \ncompanies, ADB\u2019s investment can also promote the benefits of PE as a funding option. \n \n26.  Capital mobilization and strategy validation. ADB\u2019s participation is expected to attract \nadditional institutional capital and allow the fund to reach its target size. ADB\u2019s investment in the \nfund is also expected to help MEF IV achieve a diversified, well-balanced institutional investor \nbase for the fund. In addition, ADB\u2019s participation will provide validation of the fund\u2019s strategy, and \nits commercial and developmental attributes. \n \n27.  Gender inclusiveness. ADB\u2019s gender additionality is expected to see Mekong Capital \nbecome a more gender inclusive investment advisor through a more gender inclusive work force \nwith a more women-friendly policy environment.  \n \n28.  Setting standards. ADB will provide assistance to MEF IV to enhance and continuously \nimplement its ESMS. The enhanced ESMS will incorporate ADB SPS (2009) requirements in the \ninvestment screening, impact assessment, monitoring and reporting phases. In addition, ADB will \nseek to provide oversight on governance and issues relating to potential conflicts of interest as a \nmember of MEF IV\u2019s advisory committee. \n \n29.  Co-financing opportunities. MEF IV values ADB\u2019s ability to provide both debt and equity \nfinancing directly to portfolio companies to help them grow. \n \n \n17  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n ", "5 \nE.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs  \n \n36.  Impacts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) contribute to the deepening \nof capital markets in Viet Nam, and (ii) through investments in SMEs, support sectors such as \neducation, health care and financial services that have important development impacts in Viet \nNam.  \n \n37.  Outcome.  Demonstrate  financial  sustainability and  operational  value addition  of  PE \ninvestments. \n \n38.  Outputs. Includes the following: (i) Mekong Enterprise Fund IV L.P. is established; (ii) \ncapital is invested; and (iii) Mekong Capital becomes a more gender-inclusive employer. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n39.  Consistency with ADB strategy. The proposed investment in MEF IV aligns strongly \nwith operational priorities outlined in ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.18 These include: (i) addressing poverty \nand reducing inequalities by generating quality jobs to support inclusive growth for all; and (ii) \naccelerating progress in gender equality. Strategy 2030 also supports expanding private sector \noperations, including expanding regional reach through PE funds, supporting greater financial \ninclusion,  strengthening  the  finance  sector  in  capital  markets,  and  widening  geographical \ncoverage. \n \n40.  Consistency with country strategy. The proposed investment is consistent with ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for Viet Nam, 2016-2020, which focuses on: (i) promoting job creation \n \n18 ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n ", "6 \nand competitiveness; and (ii) increasing the inclusiveness of infrastructure and service delivery, \nincluding improving access to quality education.19 \n \n41.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  proposed \ninvestment  in  MEF  IV  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Operations  Plan  and  its \nsubsequent review in 2017, which prioritize improved access to capital markets and regional \ncooperation  and  integration. 20 The  investment  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Education  Sector \nOperational Plan, which promotes quality of education.21 Mekong Capital\u2019s current and past \ninvestments include the following companies in the education sector in Viet Nam: Yola (provider \nof English training and academic test preparation) and Vietnam Australia International School \n(provider of bi-lingual K-12 education). In addition, the proposed investment is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Private Sector Operations, which focuses on using various products, \nincluding PE funds, to deploy and mobilize equity capital to support a portfolio of SMEs in realizing \ntheir expansion plans.22  \n \n42.

Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n43.  ADB has categorized the investment to be in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (SPS) 2009.24 \n \n44.  Category  FI.  ADB  has  assessed  the  investment's  potential  environment  and  social \nimpacts, its risks associated with MEF IV\u2019s likely future portfolio and its commitment and capacity \nfor environmental and social management. MEF IV\u2019s likely future portfolio is not expected to \nfinance major infrastructure development or generate significant, adverse, irreversible or diverse \nenvironmental and social impacts or risks, require involuntary resettlement or adversely or \nbeneficially affect distinct and vulnerable ethnic minority communities.  \n \n45.  Mekong  Capital\u2019s  existing  ESMS  requires the fund to  screen,  assess,  and  address \nenvironmental and social risks of proposed investee companies and obliges portfolio companies \nto operate in accordance with applicable national laws and regulations, and to implement any \ncorrective action plans. The ESMS prohibits the fund from investing in any potential investment \nthat may be categorized as A for environment, involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples \n(and will be revised so that it is clear that such categorization is in accordance with ADB\u2019s SPS). \nFurthermore, ADB is negotiating the right to be exempted from contributing capital to any \nproposed investment classified as B against SPS requirements on involuntary resettlement or \nindigenous peoples. Mekong Capital has committed to enhancing its ESMS to satisfy ADB by: (i) \nincorporating ADB\u2019s Prohibited Investment Activities List and ADB Category A criteria in its \n \n19 ADB. 2016.

Mekong Capital will submit periodic reports \non implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n47.  MEF IV was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practices relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.
