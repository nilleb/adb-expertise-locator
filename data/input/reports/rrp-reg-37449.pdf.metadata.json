The  Project  has \n\nThe  Pacific  Aviation  Safety  Office  (PASO),  an  international \norganization  founded  by  Pacific  developing  member  countries \nregulatory  oversight  on  a \n(PDMCs) \ncollaborative  regional  basis.  Members  are  Australia,  Fiji  Islands, \nKiribati,  New  Zealand,  Papua  New  Guinea,  Samoa,  Solomon \nIslands, and Vanuatu.  \n \nKiribati,  Papua  New  Guinea,  Samoa,  and  Vanuatu,  on  a  several \nbasis. \n \nTargeting classification: General Intervention \nSector: Transport and Communications \nSubsector: Civil Aviation \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth / Regional cooperation \n \nCategory C \nUnlikely to have adverse environmental impacts \n \nThe Project will complete the establishment of PASO and make it \nfully  operational  and  able  to  provide  aviation  safety  and  security \nexpertise \nfour \ncomponents:  (i)  harmonization  of  aviation  safety  and  security \nregulations, (ii) recertification of airlines, (iii) institutionalization of a \nregional \n(iv) \nrefurbishment of the PASO headquarters. Project outputs include \n(i)  updated  legislative  and  regulatory  frameworks  in  each  PASO \nmember, (ii) training and capacity building, (iii) airline certifications \nof  compliance  with  international  requirements,  (iv)  national  and \nregional  minimum  required  annual  inspection  plans,  (v)  technical \nguidance material in each specialized discipline, (vi) an inspection \ndocumentation and issues resolution system, and (vii) completed \naccommodation.  The  Project  will  be  financed  through  a  regional \nloan  to  PASO,  guaranteed  severally  in  equal  shares  by  four \nguarantor countries.  \n \nThe  PDMCs  consist  of  thousands  of  islands  spread  across  30 \nmillion  square  kilometers  of  ocean.  Modern  air  transport  is \nessential for tourism and trade, which will enable economic growth \ntransport \nand  reduce  poverty.  To  support \noperations  are  required  to  comply  with  internationally  recognized \nsafety  regulation  and  oversight  standards.  However,  all  PDMCs \nface  severe  financial  limits  and  shortages  of  skilled  personnel  to \nperform  these  essential  functions  and,  consequently,  often  fail  to \nmeet requirements. Noncompliance  places safety and security at \nrisk and potentially jeopardizes continued international services.  \n \nIn  recognition  that  regional  cooperation  can  be  an  effective \napproach  to  safety  regulation  and  oversight,  PASO  was  founded \nto  oversee  and  advise  on  regional  aviation  safety  and  security. \n\nthis  growth,  air \n\nsystem,  and \n\ninspection \n\n\f \n\niii\n\ninternational  requirements \n\nPASO  will  create  regional  capacity  and  economies  of  scale  but \nrequires  external  assistance  to  become  fully  established  and \noperational. Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing will enable \nthe  PASO  PDMCs \nto  achieve  mandatory  compliance  with \ninternational requirements through a cost-effective and financially \nsustainable organization.  \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  goal  is  to  ensure  that  the  PDMC  aviation  sectors \nfor  safety  and  security \nmeet  all \nregulation  and  oversight.  The  Project's  objectives  are  to  (i) \nharmonize updated legislative and regulatory frameworks in each \nPASO  member  along  with  training  and  capacity  building;  (ii) \nensure compliance with international requirements through airline \nrecertification;  and  (iii)  establish  and  institutionalize  a  regional \nsurveillance  and  inspection  system  by  creating  a  minimum \nrequired  annual  inspection  plan,  technical  guidance  material  in \neach  specialized  discipline,  and  a  documentation  and  issue \nresolution system. \n \nThe total project cost is estimated at $2.1 million equivalent. This \nincludes a foreign exchange cost of $1.4 million (67% of the total \ncost)  and  a  local  cost  of  $0.7  million  (33%).  It  is  proposed  that \nADB provide a loan of $1.5 million, or 71% of the project cost. The \nPASO members will contribute the remaining $0.6 million, or 29%. \n \n\nSources \n$\u2019000 \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernments\u2019 Counterpart Funds \nTotal  \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n1,400 \n0 \n1,400 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n \n\n100 \n600 \n700 \n\nTotal \nCost \n \n1,500 \n600 \n2,100 \n\n \nObjective \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nRecurrent costs of the organization, once established, will be met \nthrough  revenues  for  services  provided  to  airlines,  airports,  and \ncivil aviation authorities in PASO members. \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  ADB  will  directly  provide  to  PASO  a  public  sector  loan  of  $1.5 \nmillion  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help \nfinance  the  Project.  The  governments  of  Kiribati,  Papua  New \nGuinea,  Samoa,  and  Vanuatu  have  each  agreed  to  guarantee \n$375,000 of the loan. The loan will have a 32-year term, including \na grace period of 8 years.

The  PASO  Council  of \nDirectors,  comprising  representatives  of  PASO  members,  will \nthe  project  steering  committee,  with  overall \nconstitute \nresponsibility  for  guiding  PASO  policy  and  the  Project\u2019s  strategic \ndirection.  The  PASO  general  manager  will  be  a  member  of  the \nsteering committee. \n \nADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Equipment  packages \nvalued  at  $100,000  or  less  will  be  procured  following  ADB\u2019s \nprocedures  for  direct  purchase.  Civil  works  contracts  valued  at \n$100,000 or less will be procured using local competitive bidding \nprocedures. \n \nNo consulting services are required under the Project. \n \nThe  Project  will  increase  aviation  safety  and  security  in  PASO \nPDMCs  to  ensure  compliance  with  international  standards.  It  will \nensure  that  laws,  regulations,  technical  documentation,  and \nprocedures are current, compliant with International Civil Aviation \nOrganization  requirements,  and  harmonized  across  the  region. \nThe  currently \nfragmented  system  will  be  replaced  with  a \nconsistent and proactive operating environment, improving safety \nand reducing costs. It will create economies of scale that will allow \nPASO  to  become  financially  self-sustaining,  while  lowering  costs \nand improving service quality. The economic internal rate of return \nis 30%. \n \nThe direct beneficiaries of the Project include the governments of \nthe  PASO  PDMCs,  which  will  be  able  to  rationalize  their  civil \naviation  administrations  and  lower  public  sector  costs;  43  air \ntransport  operators  with  a  total  of  266  aircraft,  employing  nearly \n4,000  licensed  personnel,  which  will  enjoy  lower  regulatory \ncompliance  costs  and  more  responsive  services;  and  all  air \ntransport  users,  who  will  benefit  from  higher  safety  and  security \nstandards.  Indirect  beneficiaries  include  employees  and  other \nstakeholders in the tourism industry, who will avoid the potentially \ncatastrophic effects of fewer arrivals caused by a serious safety or \nsecurity incident.  \n \nThe  key  technical  risks  are  that  international  requirements  will \ncontinue  to  grow  more  complex  and  burden  PASO  and  the \nPDMCs\u2019  small  administrations  and  airlines,  and  that  evolving \nairline  fleets  will  require  greater  oversight.  The  financial  risks  are \nthat  airlines  will  face  increased  service  fees  in  response  to \nchanging  requirements,  and  that  counterpart  contributions  may \nneed  to  increase.  The  institutional  risks  are  that  governments, \noperators,  and  international  organizations  need  to  increase  their \ncooperation to support regulatory reform and harmonization.  \n\n\f \n\nv\n\n \nIn  all  three  areas,  PASO  has  been  designed  to  adjust  its \noperations,  match  its  capacity  to  demand,  and  maintain  the \ninternational  recognition  and  standing  required  to  mitigate  these \nrisks.  Better  efficiency  and  cost-effectiveness,  combined  with \nimproved regulatory oversight and harmonization of the operating \nenvironment, will encourage stakeholder cooperation.  \n \nThe risks are manageable and apply equally to PASO and to the \nalternative  of  continued  outsourcing.  Unlike \nthe  alternative, \nhowever, PASO is the least-cost solution, offers additional quality \nof  service  benefits,  and  can  become  financially  self-sufficient  to \nensure  that  service  continues.  PASO  is,  therefore,  the  preferred \nsolution \nqualitative \nimprovements, and sustainability. \n \nTechnical  assistance  (TA)  is  proposed  to  support  the  regional \nharmonization  of  aviation  safety  and  security \nregulations. \nSpecialized  expertise  is  required  for  legislative  and  regulatory \nreview, airline certification inspection, and technical design of the \nguidance  material.  The  total  TA  amount  is  $550,000,  of  which \n$450,000  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Cooperation \nFund for Regional Transportation and Financial Security Initiative, \nfunded  by  the  governments  of  Australia,  Japan,  and  United \nStates,  and  administered  by  ADB.

The  report  describes  a  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Aviation  Safety \nLegislative and Regulatory Review, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve ADB administering the TA.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nThe  Pacific  developing  member  countries  (PDMCs)  consist  of  thousands  of  islands \ncovering 30 million square kilometers of ocean. Modern air transport is essential for tourism and \ntrade,  which  will  enable  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty.  Air  transport  operations  are \nrequired  to  employ  internationally  recognized  safety  regulations  and  oversight  practices. \nHowever, all the PDMCs face a severe lack of funds and  skilled personnel, and consequently \nhave  often  failed  to  meet  requirements.  Noncompliance  places  safety and  security  at  risk  and \npotentially jeopardizes continued international services. \n \n3. \nIn recognition that regional cooperation can be an effective approach to safety regulation \nand  oversight,  the  aviation  ministers  of  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum  mandated  the  creation  of  a \ncollaborative  regional  aviation  safety  oversight  program  to  establish  regional  capacity  and \nenable  economies  of  scale  through  capacity  sharing,  leading  to  financial  sustainability.  Eight \nADB  members,  including  six  PDMCs,1  became  members  of  PASO  to  overcome  traditional \nconstraints.  PASO  will  eventually  become  self-sustaining  but  requires  external  assistance  to \nbecome  fully  established  and  operational.  At  the  request  of  the  aviation  ministers,  this  Project \nwas prepared using ADB TA.2\n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n4. \nThe  extent  of  aviation  activity  varies  substantially  among  PASO  PDMCs,  which  are \nhome  to  43  air  transport  operators,  with  266  aircraft  and  nearly  4,000  licensed  personnel. \nHowever,  the  national  industries  are  fragmented.  As  a  result,  national  capacity  for  safety  and \nsecurity  regulation  and  oversight  is  difficult  to  sustain  due  to  diseconomies  of  scale.  Most  of \nthese  countries  have  no  qualified  inspectors  in  key  areas  but  do  have  ad  hoc  contracts  for \nservices with established agencies from countries with more advanced aviation sectors. \n \nAs  a  result,  national  capacity  for  safety  and  security  oversight,  and  the  legislative  and \n5. \nregulatory  frameworks  to  facilitate  it,  are  usually  inadequate.  Audits  conducted  under  the \nUniversal  Safety  Oversight  Audit  Program  (USOAP)  of  the  International  Civil  Aviation \nOrganization  (ICAO)  have  revealed  severe  deficiencies  in  meeting  its  standards  and \nrecommended  practices  (SARPs),  making  international  air  travel  less  safe  and  secure  than  it \nshould be.  \n \n6. \nCommon  deficiencies  in  these  countries  include  noncompliant  and  badly  outdated \nlegislation  and  regulations,  operational  systems  and  procedures  that  do  not  ensure  thorough \noversight, incomplete technical guidance materials, under-resourced and poorly performing civil \naviation  administrations  (CAAs),  a  shortage  of  qualified  technical  personnel,  and  a  nearly \n\n                                                 \n1 Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu; plus Australia and New Zealand. \n2 ADB. 2003. Regional Technical Assistance on Civil Aviation Safety and Security. Manila (TA 6119-REG, approved \n\non 25 August 2003). \n\n\f2 \n\ncomplete inability to license personnel and certify airlines. Since all these countries depend on \ntheir aviation industries to support tourism, trade, and economic growth, and all are signatories \nto  the  Convention  on  International  Civil  Aviation  (the  Chicago  Convention),  improvements  are \nurgently required to comply with the convention and continue to support economic development. \n \n7. \nAlthough  national  airlines  and  administrations  in  the  PASO  PDMCs  are  small,  they \noperate in an international environment with very strict safety and security requirements. They \noperate  sophisticated  modern  aircraft  to  major  airports  in  Australia,  Canada,  Japan,  New \nZealand, and United States. Every aspect of their operations must meet the same international \nstandards  as  huge  global  airlines,  but  without  the  advantages  of  the  depth  and  resources  of \nlarger airlines.  \n \nIn response to these needs, PASO has been formally established, though not yet made \n8. \noperational, in Port Vila, Vanuatu. Overall guidance, strategy, policy, and problem resolution are \nprovided  by  the  Council  of  Directors,  which  represents  PASO  member  governments  and \nincludes  associate  members  from  the  aviation  industry,  multilateral  agencies,  and  established \nsafety oversight authorities. \n \n9. \nThe initial PASO implementation plan, following the approval of aviation ministers of the \nPacific  Islands  Forum  in  2001,  led  to  PASO\u2019s  incorporation  in  Vanuatu  in  July  2003.  The \nmembers expected that the organization would be operational soon after, but activities have not \ncommenced due to a lack of start-up funding. PASO needs to evolve its operational capability \nquickly  to  create  the  necessary  services  and  begin  generating  revenues,  eventually  becoming \nfinancially self-sustaining, and thus maintaining its members\u2019 commitment. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n10. \nThe global system of aviation safety and security regulation and oversight is intended to \nmake international air operations safe and efficient by requiring all ICAO members to uniformly \napply  the  ICAO  SARPs.  All  ICAO  members  and  signatories  to  the  Chicago  Convention  are \nobligated  to  secure  the  highest  practical  degree  of  uniformity  in  regulations,  standards,  and \nprocedures,  and  to  ensure  their  effective  implementation.  A  state\u2019s  responsibilities  under  the \nChicago  Convention  (Appendix  4)  include  the  airworthiness  of  aircraft  and  their  correct \noperation,  supervision  of  licensed  personnel,  suitability  of  the  physical  infrastructure  at \naerodromes,  and  security  of  all  aspects  of  civil  aviation.  To  carry  out  these  responsibilities, \nICAO  members  must  develop  appropriate  laws,  regulations,  procedures,  personnel,  and \ninstitutions. \n \n11. \nPASO  PDMCs,  however,  cannot  implement  all  these  aspects  of  safety  regulation  and \noversight  because  they  lack  resources  and  have  small  industries  and  administrations.  As  a \nresult,  their  laws,  regulations,  and  procedures  are  generally  noncompliant,  their  personnel  are \nunderqualified, and their institutions are not fully effective.  \n \n12. \nPDMCs have received little external assistance for civil aviation safety and security. The \nEuropean Commission has financed one sizable regional project, and Australia has made two \ndonations directly to PASO (Appendix 5). \n \n13. \nClearly,  the  regional  system  must  be  improved  to  ensure  the  continuing  viability  of \nPacific  aviation.  The  Project  will  develop  cooperative  regional  capacity  for  the  required \nimprovements  through  PASO.  The  alternatives  to  PASO  are  fully  developing  each  CAA  to \n\n\f3 \n\nThese  problems  and  constraints  are  common \n\nprovide independent capacity, or outsourcing most functions to service providers from countries \nwith more advanced aviation sectors.  \n \n14.  Meeting  the  minimum  national  responsibilities  would  require  each  CAA  to  employ \nqualified inspectors in flight operations, airworthiness, aerodromes, and security, and to upgrade \nthe countries\u2019 legislative, regulatory, and institutional frameworks to support these areas. While \nit  would  be  possible  to  create  independent  capacity  in  each  PASO  PDMC,  the  small  national \naviation  sectors  do  not  require  full-time  activity  from  each  specialist.  The  net  result  would  be \nexcess capacity and duplication of effort, translating into much higher costs per unit compared \nwith larger industries and administrations. \n \n15. \nThe PASO PDMCs have addressed this problem by contracting for inspection services \nas needed, mainly from the CAAs of New Zealand and the United Kingdom. This approach has \nbeen  effective  in  responding  to  immediate  needs  by  providing  qualified  inspectors  when \nneeded,  but  it  has  not  created  systematic  and  institutionalized  capacity.  Years  of  reacting  to \nproblems  rather  than  proactively  planning  to  avoid  them,  and  continued  poor  results  from \ninternational  audits  have  demonstrated  the  inadequacy  of  this  ad  hoc  approach.  Although  the \neffort could be increased and improved through outsourcing, the ultimate cost would be much \nhigher  than  either  current  (and  manifestly  inadequate)  expenditures  or  a  cooperative  regional \napproach (Appendix 6).  \n \n16. \nto  developing  countries,  which \nincreasingly respond by developing regional capacity. ICAO has created a number of regional \norganizations  for  cooperative  development  of  operational  safety  and  continuing  airworthiness. \nThese  do  not  provide  direct  oversight  services  but  are  coordinating  bodies,  providing  TA  to \nCAAs  that  need  to  improve  their  safety  and  security  regulations  and  oversight  capacity.  This \napproach would not work in the PASO PDMCs since they either have little or no such capacity \nto  develop.  The  only  operational  regional  organization  is  the  Central  American  Agency  for \nSafety Oversight, which is similar to PASO. There are no equivalent organizations in the Pacific \nregion. \n \n17. \nA regional agency could develop shared capacity and become self-sufficient by reducing \nduplication,  creating  economies  of  scale,  harmonizing  regulatory  systems,  sharing  scarce \ntechnically  qualified  personnel,  and  thus  reducing  the  unit  costs  of  oversight.  For  example, \nrather than appointing (and then underutilizing) three specialized national inspectors for each of \nthe five countries that have none, a total of four regional professionals could provide services for \nall. Airlines would save on compliance costs as a harmonized regulatory system would relieve \nthem of the need to operate consistently within multiple national frameworks. Additional benefits \nwould include priority service when safety issues arise, which do not necessarily happen when \noversight is provided by contract agencies, and an enhanced opportunity to transfer skills and \ntrain the various national CAAs because all oversight would be either provided by or controlled \nwithin the region. \n \n18. \nPASO  can  create  this  regional  capacity  by  appointing  an  optimal  staff  complement  to \nprovide the  required level of service across the PASO PDMCs. Given the anticipated scale of \nthe  regional  industry  by  the  end  of  the  project  period,  this  would  require  one  flight  operation \nspecialist,  one  airworthiness  specialist,  a  combined  aerodrome  and  security  specialist,  and  a \ngeneral manager qualified in one of the technical areas.  \n \n19. \nA  cooperative  approach  is  the  most  effective  way  to  improve  air  transport  safety  and \nsecurity  in  the  region.  Existing  contracting  arrangements  can  meet  known  national  needs  but \n\n\f4 \n\ncannot build the capacity of national CAAs to plan and manage assistance for unknown ones. In \naddition  to  technical  services,  PASO  will  be  able  to  provide  policy  and  operational  advice  to \ngovernments through the intergovernmental council. It will also improve guidance to the industry \nby documenting a consistent and harmonized regulatory system.  \n \n20. \nPASO will be the nucleus of a region-wide initiative. Other PDMCs are expected to join \nPASO  as  needed  and  as  the  organization  demonstrates  its  value  and  capabilities.  Some \ncountries  are  expected  to  use  PASO  services  on  a  contract  basis.  PASO  is  designed  to \naccommodate growth through both mechanisms.  \n \n21. \nPASO will eventually become self-sustaining through contributions by its members and \nrevenues generated from services. The bulk of PASO\u2019s funding will come from each member\u2019s \naviation industry through service fees, in the same way that the industry is currently invoiced by \nnational CAAs for services provided under contract by established aviation safety organizations. \nAs  PASO  will  be  more  efficient  and  responsive  to  its  members\u2019  needs,  it  will  increase  quality \nand  reduce  charges  to  the  industry.  However,  PASO  requires  external  assistance  in  its \ninception phase.  \n \n22. \nAir transport is essential to promote tourism, which employs large numbers of women in \nlabor-intensive occupations and contributes up to a quarter of GDP in some PASO PDMCs. By \nensuring that an essential public good is always available to support this key transport sector, \nthe  Project  supports  sustainable  economic  growth  and  promotes  the  crosscutting  strategic \ntheme  of  regional  cooperation  in  ADB's  poverty  reduction  strategy3  and  long-term  strategic \nframework.4  By  supporting  regional  capacity  building,  the  Project  will  be  important  in \nimplementing the Pacific strategy for 2005\u20132009,5 ADB's subregional strategy and program for \nthe PDMCs.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n23. \nPASO  was  founded  in  July  2003  as  a  nonprofit  organization,  incorporated  under  the \nlaws of Vanuatu. PASO\u2019s operations were to be governed by the PASO constitution. Because it \nlacked  start-up  funding,  PASO  remained  an  entity  in  name  only.  In  April  2004,  the  PASO \nCouncil  of  Directors  determined  that  PASO  should  be  an  international  entity,  governed  by  the \nterms  of  an  international  treaty,  to  have  the  mandate  to  harmonize  the  international  air  and \nsafety operations of its members. By July 2004, the Council of Directors concluded the terms of \nthe treaty to govern PASO\u2019s operations. The Pacific Island Aviation Safety and Security Treaty \n(PICASST) was opened for signature in August 2004 and entered into force with five signatures \nin June 2005. PICASST and the constitution are now in the process of being amended to give \nfull effect to PASO\u2019s international regional character. This process is expected to be complete \nprior to the date of loan effectiveness. \n \n24. \nThe  Project  will  help  PASO  become  fully  operational  as  an  independent  regulatory \noversight  organization.  PASO  will  provide  services  to  its  six  founding  PDMCs  (Fiji  Islands, \nKiribati, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu) on a collaborative regional \nbasis. \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2004.

Manila \n\n\f5 \n\n \nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n25. \nThe  Project\u2019s  goal  is  to  ensure  that  the  Pacific  aviation  sector  meets  all  international \nrequirements  for  safety  and  security  regulation  and  oversight.  PASO  will  provide  advisory, \ncertification, inspection, and surveillance services to the national CAAs and aviation industries \nof its PDMCs. It will identify deficiencies, set out remedial steps, monitor implementation through \nto  full  compliance,  and  provide  TA  to  establish  the  regulatory  environment.  The  professional \nstaff  will  consist  of  three  internationally  qualified  technical  specialists  in  airworthiness,  flight \noperations,  and  security  and  aerodromes,  plus  a  general  manager  qualified  in  one  of  the \ntechnical areas. These activities will replace the  current system of ad hoc external contracting \nfrom  the  CAAs  of  countries  with  more  advanced  aviation  sectors.  By  reporting  directly  to \nnational CAAs, PASO is expected to qualitatively improve oversight, which is not possible under \nthe current system. \n \n26. \nPASO  operations  will  be  supervised  by  an  intergovernmental  Council  of  Directors, \ncomprising  representatives  of  each  PASO  member,  which  will  set  policy  and  monitor \nimplementation and enforcement of technical findings. The functions of the Council of Directors \nare detailed in the PASO constitution and the PICASST.  \n \nThe  successful  transition  of  PASO  to  an  operational  organization  will  improve  aviation \n27. \nsafety  and  security  in  a  sustainable  manner,  based  on  regional  cooperation,  shared  capacity, \nand  economies  of  scale.  Within  the  5-year  project  period,  PASO  is  expected  to  become  the \npreferred  service  provider  for  regulatory  and  oversight  functions,  selected  for  its  professional \nregional staff, lower operating costs, and systematic, focused service to its clients operating in \nthe PDMCs. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n28. \nThe Project has four components, required to make PASO fully operational: (i) creating a \nharmonized regulatory environment, (ii) ensuring airline compliance with international standards, \n(iii)  establishing  and  institutionalizing  a  regional  surveillance  and  inspection  system,  and  (iv) \nrefurbishing  the  PASO  headquarters.  Project  outputs  include  (i)  updated  legislative  and \nregulatory  frameworks  in  each  member,  (ii)  training  and  capacity  building,  (ii)  airline \ncertifications  of  compliance  with  international  requirements,  (iii)  a  minimum  required  annual \ninspection  (MRAI)  plan,  (iv)  technical  guidance  material  in  each  specialized  discipline,  (v)  an \n(vi)  completed  office \ninspection  documentation  and \naccommodation. \n \n\nresolution  system,  and \n\nissue \n\n1. \n\nComponent A: Creation of a Harmonized Regulatory Environment \n\n29. \nFor  PASO  to  be  effective  and  increase  its  membership,  a  standard  operating \nenvironment must be established across all members. The  PASO PDMCs intend to adopt the \nNew Zealand regulations, which are already in partial use in several members. Harmonization \nwill  allow  full  economies  of  scale  related  to  regional  cooperation  to  develop  and  is  crucial  to \nPASO\u2019s success. \n \n30. \nThe  outputs  of  this  component  will  be  (i)  adoption  and  implementation  of  an  updated \noversight  system  in  each  PASO  PDMC;  and  (ii)  training  and  capacity  building  for  airlines, \nnational  CAAs,  and  airport  operators.  PASO  will  develop  (i)  surveillance  and  inspection \nprocedures, (ii) certification and licensing procedures, and (iii) technical guidance materials. To \n\n\f6 \n\nensure  ownership  and  cooperation,  PASO  will  provide  comprehensive  briefings  and  train \nofficials and management of CAAs, airlines, and airports in the new safety and security systems \nand their inspection, surveillance, and certification programs. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent B: Airline Compliance with International Requirements \n\n31. \nBecause the PDMC  CAAs are weak, most airlines have been self-regulating for years, \nwithout  sufficient  oversight  to  ensure  compliance  with  ICAO  SARPs.  With  few  exceptions, \ndocumentation  on  air  operator  certification  is  nonexistent,  indicating  the  lack  of  competent \nsafety  certification  of  airlines  in  the  region.  To  ensure  compliance,  a  comprehensive \nrecertification program is essential to establish a baseline for surveillance and inspection. \n \nThis  component\u2019s  output  will  be  certification  of  airline  compliance  with  international \n32. \nrequirements.  PASO  staff  will  supervise  certification  audits  in  airworthiness  and  flight \noperations,  using  ICAO  SARPs  in  combination  with  procedures  and  technical  guidance \ndeveloped  under  component  A.  Based  on  PASO  recommendations,  the  PASO  PDMCs  will \nissue or revalidate the airlines\u2019 air operator\u2019s certificates. \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent C: Regional Surveillance and Inspection System \n\nA comprehensive surveillance and inspection program, in the form of an MRAI plan, is \n33. \nessential  to  guide  PASO  operations.  The  core  services  that  will  be  included  in  each  country\u2019s \nMRAI  and  provided  by  PASO  technical  staff  include  regulation,  oversight,  and  personnel \nlicensing in flight operations, airworthiness,  aerodromes, and security. Implementing the MRAI \nin each country through regular inspections and reporting will comprise about half of all PASO \nactivities. \n \n34. \nThe outputs of this component will be (i) design and implementation of an MRAI plan for \neach  member,  covering  its  CAA,  air  transport  operators,  and  aerodrome  operators;  and  (ii) \ncreation of an inspection documentation and issue resolution system. A system of circulars and \ndirectives  will  be  required  for  official  communications  with  members.  These  are  core  activities \nexpected of PASO staff, based on the outputs of component A.  \n \n\n4. \n\nComponent D: Completed Office Accommodation \n\n35. \nPASO  will  be  headquartered  in  Port  Vila,  Vanuatu.  The  Government  has  donated  a \nbasic  office  facility  to  the  Project  and  provides  two  administrative  staff  members  as  in-kind \ncontributions.  Additional  furnishings,  standard  office  equipment,  and  modern  communications \nare  required  to  equip  this  facility.  This  component\u2019s  output  will  be  a  completed  office  facility \nready for occupancy by seven people. Required activities are primarily procurement of furniture \nand equipment and minor building works for renovation.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nRegional cooperation through the Project will enable three special features to emerge: (i) \n36. \nincentives for increasing harmonization and membership through \"network benefits\", (ii) benefits \nfrom  net  positive  contributions  to  regional  regulatory  and  oversight  services  by  the  larger  and \nbetter-developed national CAAs, and (iii) greater independence and accountability for policy and \nregulatory functions.  \n \n\n\f7 \n\nNetwork  benefits  refer  to  the  increasing  value  of  membership  as  the  organization\u2019s \n37. \nscope  grows.  As  harmonization  proceeds,  and  economies  of  scale  decrease  the  unit  costs  of \nservice provision, it will become increasingly cost-effective for more countries to join PASO as \ntheir  needs  require  and  as  the  organization  demonstrates  its  value  and  capabilities.  Its \nincreasing scale and scope will enable PASO to reduce the costs to its members of specialized \noutside  expertise  that  may  be  contracted  for  infrequent  services  such  as  approvals  of  new \naircraft types or airlines, and engineering support for major modifications or repairs of aircraft.  \n \nThe potential for net positive contributions to the regional initiative arises with respect to \n38. \nthe  CAAs  of  Fiji  Islands  and  Papua  New  Guinea,  which  have  large  organizations  that  could \nprovide services to PASO as needed. This will allow regional personnel to become fully qualified \nto international standards and eventually replace international staff.  \n \nUnder  the  existing  system,  all  but  two  PASO  PDMCs6  combine  policy,  regulatory,  and \n39. \noperational  functions  within  aviation  ministries.  All  international  airlines  in  PASO  PDMCs  are \ngovernment-owned, creating potential conflicts of interest. To improve accountability, the PASO \nconstitution  and  the  PICASST  delegate  ICAO-mandated  oversight  responsibilities  to  PASO, \nfacilitating administrative and financial independence.  \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n40. \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $2.1  million  equivalent.  This  includes  a  foreign \nexchange cost of $1.4 million equivalent (about 67% of the total) and a local cost of $0.7 million \nequivalent  (about  33%  of  the  total).  Cost  estimates  include  (i)  staff  costs,  including  travel, \ntraining, and overheads; (ii) establishment costs of PASO, including communication equipment, \ntechnical  resources,  and  minor  renovations;  (iii)  initial  working  capital;  and  (iv)  contingencies. \nTaxes  are  excluded  from  project  cost  estimates  since  PASO  is  tax  exempt  in  Vanuatu.  Cost \nestimates are shown in Table 1 and details are in Appendix 6. \n \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($\u2019000) \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \n\nItem \n\n245\n245\n739\n1,229\n12\n1,241\n124\n35\n1,400\n\nA.

The loan will have \na 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, and interest rates of 1.0% during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% thereafter.  \n \n42. \nThe  governments  of  Kiribati,  Papua  New  Guinea,  Samoa,  and  Vanuatu  will  each \nguarantee  one  fourth  of  the  total  loan  amount,  equal  to  SDR258,250  ($375,000  equivalent). \nKiribati, Samoa, and Vanuatu are under category A, and Papua New Guinea is under category \nB2. Each country is eligible for Asian Development Fund (ADF) funding.7  \n \nPASO members will provide $600,000 equivalent in counterpart funding, in the form of \n43. \nannual  membership  fees  and  in-kind  contributions  (offices  and  two  administrative  staff \nmembers). The governments will not need to fund any tax liability, as PASO is tax exempt. The \ngovernments  are  committed  to  providing  timely  counterpart  funds  and  have  incorporated  the \nrequired  amounts  into  their  budgets  beginning  in  financial  year  2003.  Counterpart  funding \nrequirements  and  debt  service  on  the  loan  are  reasonable  compared  with  each  guarantor \ncountry's  treasury  resources  and  ongoing  commitments  to  other  externally  funded  projects. \nTable 2 shows the summary financing plan and Appendix 8 presents the detailed plan.  \n \n\n \nSource \n\nADB Loan \nGovernment Counterpart Funds \nTotal Cost to be Financed \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($\u2019000) \n \n\n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n1,400 \n0 \n1,400 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n \n100 \n600 \n700 \n\nTotal Cost \n\nPercentage \n\n \n1,500 \n600 \n2,100 \n\n \n\n71 \n29 \n100 \n\n        Sources: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n44. \nADB financing will bridge the cash-flow gap for PASO until estimated revenues exceed \nestimated costs, 5 years after inception. The balance of the financial requirements for running \nthe organization will be met through revenues generated from services provided to airlines and \nairport  operators  in  PASO  members.  Service  fees  will  be  set  to  fully  recover  costs.  The  two \nPASO  members  that  are  not  guarantors  (Fiji  Islands  and  Solomon  Islands)  will  pay  a  10% \npremium on service fees.  \n \n45. \nAs  a  loan  to  an  international  organization  comprising  ADB  members,  and  guaranteed \nseverally by ADB members, the proposed financing is classified as a public sector loan. Direct \nlending  to  PASO  is  consistent  with  the  ADB  Charter,  which  specifies  that  ADB  may  finance \ninternational  or  regional  agencies  or  entities  concerned  with  economic  development  of  the \nregion.8  PASO  is  a  regional  international  organization  that  will  directly  contribute  to  the \neconomic development of the Pacific region (section V.C.). Access to the ADF for this purpose \nis allowed in its regulations.9\n\n                                                 \n7 The other two PASO PDMCs will not become guarantors of the loan. The Solomon Islands cannot borrow or take \non contingent liabilities in the near term, following its recent lapse into and recovery from arrears. The Fiji Islands \ndoes not expect to regularly receive services from PASO and is therefore not willing to become a guarantor.  \n\n8  ADB.  1966.

A  financial  management  assessment, \nincluding  a  review  of  PASO\u2019s  systems  for  financial  and  management  accounting,  reporting, \nauditing, and internal controls, is in Supplementary Appendix A. The PASO Council of Directors \nwill form the project steering committee, which shall have overall responsibility for guiding PASO \npolicy  and  the  strategic  direction  of  the  Project.  The  Council  of  Directors  consists  of  one \nrepresentative from each member government, the Association of South Pacific Airlines, ICAO, \nthe Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, and the general manager of PASO. The general manager \nshall have overall responsibility for project implementation and for ensuring coordination among \nPASO members.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n47. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  start  in  November  2005  and  end  in  October  2010.  Initial \nactivities,  including  regulatory  harmonization,  airline  recertification,  and  design  of  the  regional \nsurveillance program, will be completed in 2006. Field inspections are expected to commence in \nmid-2006  and  continue  indefinitely.  The  project  period  has  been  designated  as  5  years  since \nthat  is  when  PASO  is  expected  to  become  financially  self-sustaining.  An  implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n48. \nADB-financed  goods  and  related  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Minor civil works estimated to cost $100,000 or less will be carried \nout  under  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Local  contractors \nhave  the  expertise  and  capacity  to  undertake  such  minor  civil  works,  and  since  international \ncontractors are unlikely to be interested, the use of LCB is acceptable. In accordance with ADB \nrequirements,  foreign  contractors  may  participate  in  LCB.  Selection  and  engagement  of \ncontractors  will  be  subject  to  the  approval  of  ADB.  Promptly  after  such  award,  ADB  will  be \nfurnished  with  copies  of  the  bid  evaluation  report  and  contract  as  executed.  Equipment \ncontracts estimated to cost $100,000 or less may be directly procured by PASO. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nNo consulting services are required under the Project.  \n\n49. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n50. \nAn  imprest  account  will  be  established  by  PASO,  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to \nADB,  immediately  after  loan  effectiveness.  Replenishment  to  the  imprest  account  will  be \nsupported by appropriate withdrawal application and related documentation. The initial amount \nto  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  $150,000  equivalent.  The  statement  of \nexpenditure procedure may be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and liquidate advances \nfor  individual  payments  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $50,000.  Detailed  arrangements  to \nestablish and operate the imprest account and the statement of expenditure procedure will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001). \n \n\n\f10 \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n51. \nPASO  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  containing  detailed  descriptions  of  the \nsources  of  receipts  and  expenditures.  A  full  set  of  financial  statements  (income  statement, \nbalance sheet, and cash flow and related notes) will be prepared. The annual project accounts \nand annual financial statements will be audited by independent auditors acceptable to ADB and \nwill be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they \nrelated. PASO was informed about ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited financial statements \nand possible penalties for delays in submission. \n \n52. \nPASO  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  on  financial \nsustainability  and  regional  cooperation  including  (i)  actual  revenue  generation  against \nprojections,  (ii)  regulatory  harmonization,  and  (iii)  prospects  for  growth  of  services  and \nmembership.  The \nidentify  problems  and  difficulties  encountered  during \nimplementation  and  summarize  the  Project\u2019s  financial  accounts  consisting  of  expenditures \nduring  the  reporting  period,  year  to  date,  and  total  to  date.  A  project  completion  report  will  be \nprovided no later than 3 months after project completion. \n \n\nreports  will \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe project performance monitoring indicators that have been agreed on during project \n53. \npreparation  include  national  legislative  and  regulatory  improvements,  technical  certifications, \ninspection  schedules,  organizational  financial  performance,  and  ultimately  full  compliance  with \nICAO  SARPs.  The  relevance  and  practicability  of  data  collection  for  the  proposed  measures \nhave  been  confirmed  with  PASO  and  the  governments  of  its  PDMCs.  At  the  beginning  of  the \nProject,  PASO  will  develop  comprehensive  procedures  to  systematically  generate  data  on \ninputs and outputs of the four project components and the agreed-on indicators to be used to \nmeasure  project  impacts.  PASO  will  refine  the  design  and  monitoring  framework,  confirm  the \nachievable goals, refine the monitoring and recording arrangements, and establish systems and \nprocedures no later than 6 months after loan effectiveness. \n \n54. \nUnder the design and monitoring framework, PASO will report on baseline and progress \ndata  at  the  requisite  time  intervals,  and  analyze  and  consolidate  the  data  through  its \ndocumentation, \ninformation  systems.  The  project \nperformance  monitoring  system  will  be  flexible  enough  to  adopt  remedial  action  for  project \ndesign,  schedules,  activities,  and  development  impacts.  PASO  will  monitor  and  assess \nactivities, and report quarterly to ADB on the Project\u2019s implementation and financial aspects to \nensure that progress and impacts are monitored and reported in line with ADB requirements. \n \n\nresolution,  and  management \n\nissue \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n55. \nRegular  ADB  review  missions  are  envisaged,  and  a  midterm  review,  including  ICAO \nparticipation, will be undertaken approximately 2 years after project implementation begins. The \nreview  will  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  and \nachievement  of  scheduled  targets;  progress  on  future  growth  of  activities;  and  analysis  of \nfeedback from project performance monitoring. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n56. \nA harmonized operating environment will produce benefits broader than those accruing \nto PASO members, particularly for travelers and airlines of major countries serving the Pacific \n\n\f11 \n\nislands.  Because  of  the  positive  externalities  involved,  it  is  appropriate  to  supplement  project \nactivities  through  external  TA.  In  conjunction  with  the  Project,  an  advisory  TA  is  therefore \nproposed to provide specialized expertise to support specific project inception activities.  \n \nTA for aviation legislative and regulatory review will provide legal and regulatory advice, \n57. \ntechnical support to audit airlines for recertification, and information systems development. This \nTA  is  required  to  supplement  the  technical  capacity  of  PASO  staff  for  one-time  activities  to \nsupport the inspections and systems design. \n \n58. \nConsulting  services  will  be  provided  to  review  and  revise  national  legislation  and \nregulations,  provide  specialized  technical  support  for  airworthiness  and  flight  operation  audits, \ndesign  a  database  system,  and  recommend  ways  to  implement  the  Project.  The  Project  will \nthen result in the adoption and implementation by PASO staff, CAAs, and governments of the \nTA recommendations.  \n \n59. \nThe  total  TA  amount  is  $550,000,  of  which  the  Cooperation  Fund  for  Regional \nTransportation  and  Financial  Security  Initiative  (a  multi-donor  umbrella  facility  funded  by  the \ngovernments of Australia, Japan, and United States) will finance $450,000 on a grant basis to \nbe  administered  by  ADB.  PASO  and  its  members  will  provide  the  remainder  in  kind.  Twelve \nperson-months  of  international  and  six  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  be \nrequired. Selection and recruitment of consultant services will be undertaken in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on \nthe engagement of domestic consultants. Details are in Appendix 11. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n60. \nThe Project will result in the Pacific aviation sector meeting all international requirements \nfor  civil  aviation  safety  and  security  regulation  and  oversight.  The  establishment  of  a  single \nregional  organization  that  replaces  and  updates  the  system  of  fragmented  national  authorities \nwill  create  economies  of  scale  that  will  allow  the  organization  to  become  financially  self-\nsustaining while lowering costs and improving service quality.  \n \nThe Project\u2019s direct beneficiaries include the governments of the PASO PDMCs, which \n61. \nwill be able to rationalize their CAAs and lower public sector costs; 43 commercial air transport \noperators operating a total of 266 aircraft and employing nearly 4,000 licensed personnel, who \nwill enjoy lower regulatory compliance costs and more responsive services; and all users of air \ntransport,  who  will  benefit  from  higher  safety  and  security  standards.  Indirect  beneficiaries \ninclude stakeholders in the tourism industry, and those who depend on their earnings, which will \navoid the potentially catastrophic effects of fewer arrivals caused by a serious safety or security \nincident.  \n \nA. \n\nInstitutional Reform \n\n62. \nAviation safety and security regimes in the PASO PDMCs are fragmented, incomplete, \nand out of date. Many airlines are self-regulating and national administrations lack the tools to \nsupervise them according to their international responsibilities. The Project will ensure that laws, \nregulations,  technical  documentation,  and  procedures  are  up-to-date,  compliant  with  ICAO \nrequirements,  and  harmonized  across  the  region.  Airlines  will  face  a  consistent  operating \nenvironment  in  all  countries,  thus  improving  safety  and  reducing  costs.  Alignment  of  national \nand international responsibilities is mandated through the PICASST. \n \n\n\f12 \n\nNational  administrations  will  benefit  from  higher-quality  services  than  available  through \n63. \nexisting  ad  hoc  arrangements.  Although  these  inspectors  are  technically  competent,  they \nprovide  services  only  when  contracted.  National  CAAs  do  not  have  the  technical  expertise  to \nplan  and  manage  their  assistance  and,  as  a  result,  often  react  only  after  problems  become \napparent.  PASO  will  become  a  source  of  dedicated  expertise  that  will  provide  administrative \nbackup  to  client  governments  and  ensure  oversight  is  planned  and  implemented  proactively. \nSince  PASO  is  a  regionally  controlled  international  organization  mandated  by  an  international \ntreaty, its credibility and stability are safeguarded.  \n \nB. \n\nTechnical Impacts \n\n64. \nA major feature of PASO\u2019s regulatory approach will be a shift away from a reactive and \n\"forensic\"  oversight  that  attempts  to  find  errors  in  every  detail  of  operations  after  they  have \noccurred  and  creates  incentives  for  avoidance  through  its  adversarial  nature.  The  Project  will \ninstead rely on proactive safety management systems that must be adhered to by airlines and \ninspectors  alike.  Such  systems,  when  implemented  correctly,  place  the  responsibility  for \ncompliance  at  appropriate  points  in  the  aviation  industry,  create  incentives  for  cooperation  to \navoid errors in the first place, and can be audited effectively by a regional team.  \n \n65. \nCompliance  and  enforcement  will  be  enhanced  through  three  mechanisms:  (i) \nharmonization  across  all  members  through  component  A,  which  will  introduce  stricter  SARPs \nand  make  compliance  more  consistent  and  transparent  to  governments  and  operators;  (ii) \nalignment  of  national  and  international  responsibilities  through  the  PICASST  and  PASO \nmembership;  and  (iii)  regular  ICAO  USOAP  audits  that  mandate  an  international  survey  of \ncompliance.  Since  the  risk  of  continued  poor  enforcement  includes  loss  of  air  services, \ngovernments and operators will have powerful incentives to improve compliance. \n \n66. \nEvery  country  with  an  aviation  industry  must  ensure  regulation  and  oversight  in  four \ntechnical disciplines, yet five PASO PDMCs do not need a full-time expert in any of these areas. \nWith the exception of the Fiji Islands and Papua New Guinea, the PASO PDMCs need a total of \nfour  full-time  technical  experts.  Centralizing  expertise  in  a  regional  organization  will  create \nsignificant  economies  of  scale  by  eliminating  duplication  of  services  and  administrative \noverheads, and by making efficient use of highly qualified but scarce human resources. \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Aspects \n\nPASO  provides  the  least-cost  way  to  improve  safety  and  security  regulation  and \n67. \noversight in its PDMCs. In aggregate, these cost savings are equivalent to 14% per year when \ncompared with ad hoc contracting, with a net present value of about $573,000 over a 20-year \nplanning period. The resulting economic internal rate of return is 30%. \n \n68. \nThe Project\u2019s wider economic benefit will be that airlines continue to offer services to and \nfrom PASO  PDMCs. Without the Project, these countries will most probably continue to fail to \nmeet  ICAO  SARPs  and  have  their  noncompliance  recorded  in  ICAO  audit  reports.  In  the \nabsence of timely and credible efforts to remedy safety and security deficiencies, international \nairlines  (pushed  by  their  insurers  and  aircraft  lessors)  may  withdraw  services  from  these \ncountries.  Countries  with  more  advanced  aviation  sectors  may  deny  access  to  airlines  from \nPDMCs because of safety and security concerns, as recently happened to one PDMC airline for \nlack of mandated safety equipment.  \n \n\n\f13 \n\nIt is difficult to quantify the economic benefits of compliance with international standards \n69. \nthrough improved safety and security regulation and oversight, since the impact of the Project is \nto reduce the probability of a serious incident of unknown frequency and magnitude. However, \nsome  indications  of  the  potential  impacts  of  noncompliance  are  provided  by  comparable \nexperiences.10  Major  international  air  disasters  cause  about  a  10%  decline  in  aviation  in  ADB \nDMCs for about a year, and major security concerns have resulted in short-term 20% declines. \nAfter  the  coup  d'etat  in  the  Fiji  Islands  in  May  2000,  security  concerns  caused  an  immediate \n25%  fall  in  international  visitor  arrivals,  which  did  not  recover  to  their  prior  levels  until  4  years \nlater. Since tourism is responsible for about 20% of the Fiji Islands\u2019 GDP, this was equivalent to \nan average loss of 5% of GDP per year.  \n \n70. \nThe potential impact of a major aviation incident that evenly affected the PASO PDMCs \ncould thus be estimated at a 10% decline in visitor numbers for a year, equivalent to a fall of 2% \nof  their  combined  GDP,  or  a  loss  of  about  $135  million  if  all  countries  were  affected  equally. \nDenial of international services could have an even greater impact. Given that tourism employs \nlarge  numbers  of  low-skilled  workers,  including  a  high  proportion  of  women,  the  potential \nnegative social impacts would be significant and widespread. According to this estimate, PASO \nwould only need to avert one serious incident during the Project to maintain a benefit\u2013cost ratio \nmuch greater than 1.  \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Aspects \n\n71. \nPASO is expected to become financially self-sufficient 5 years from the inception of full \noperations. It will do so while charging lower service fees on an equivalent basis than is possible \nthrough  ad  hoc  contracting.  Since  existing  oversight  and  regulation  are  funded  on  a  fee-for-\nservice basis, airlines and airport operators will also experience financial benefits. \n \nE. \n\nRegional Cooperation \n\nin \n\ntransportation  and \n\nregional  cooperation,  particularly \n\n72. \nPASO is the first example of a regional organization that PDMCs have been willing to set \nup  on  a  self-financing  basis  without  ongoing  donor  grants.  It  is  likely  to  serve  as  a  model  for \nintergovernmental \nregulation \ninfrastructure  and  services.  All  PASO  members  would  benefit  from  the  harmonization  of  laws, \nregulations,  and  procedures;  the  availability  of  a  range  of  supplemental  TA;  and  continuous \naudits  of  national  oversight  needs.  As  countries  take  steps  to  improve  their  organizations  and \ncapabilities,  the  Project  would  reinforce  those  efforts  and  continue  to  provide  supplementary \nassistance. \n \n73. \nPASO  has  recognized  the  need  for  capacity  building  as  a  long-term  objective. \nComponent  A  includes  activities  designed  to  increase  the  ability  of  national  administrations  to \nplan  and  manage  improved  safety  and  security  systems.  All  the  technical  inspectors  will  be \nexpatriates  in  the  near  to  medium  term  as  no  PDMC  nationals  are  qualified,  but  this  will \ngradually change. To become an inspector, a candidate must first be a qualified pilot. Although \na  few  PDMC  nationals  are  trained  to  operate  modern  aircraft,  as  their  number  grows  it  will \nbecome  possible  to  train  them  as  inspectors.  It  is  expected  that  this  might  be  added  to  the \nPASO work program once the inspection system is well established, after about the fifth year of \nimplementation. \n \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2001. Global Air Transport Crisis Impact Analysis. Manila. \n\n\f14 \n\nSince the Project is an innovative approach to common problems facing smaller PDMCs, \n74. \ndisseminating lessons learned from PASO should be an important activity for ADB to leverage \nits  experience  with  regional  cooperation,  as  recommended  in  the  Pacific  regional  cooperation \nstrategy  and  program  for  2004\u20132006.11  In  the  short  term,  this  will  begin  with  consideration  of \nexpanding  the  cooperative  model  under  the  Pacific  Regional  Transport  Analysis.12  PASO  has \ninvited  ICAO  to  be  represented  on  its  Council  of  Directors,  creating  a  regular  link  to  official \ngovernment contacts in Pacific countries that are not PASO members.  \n \nF. \n\nProject Risks \n\n75. \nThe Project has technical, financial, and institutional risks. The first technical risk is that \nICAO SARPs could grow more complex and increase the need for additional technical staff and \nprocedures  that  would  overburden  PASO  and  the  small  PDMC  administrations  and  airlines. \nInternational  requirements  have  recently  been  comprehensively  revised,  however,  so  the \nlikelihood  of  substantial  additional  risk  is  low  in  the  short  to  medium  term.  A  second  technical \nrisk  is  that  airline  fleets  may  change,  requiring  either  retraining  of  technical  staff,  which  would \nincrease  costs  to  PASO  in  the  short  term,  or  reductions  in  staff  due  to  reduced  demand  for \nservices.  This  risk  is  moderate  and  will  require  flexibility  in  PASO  staffing  and  structure  to \nenable  adjustments.  A  third  technical  risk  is  whether  operators  have  sufficient  resources  to \nimplement  remedial  actions.  Although  implementation  will  present  challenges,  improvements \nare mandatory with or without the Project. A significant advantage of PASO is that its PDMCs \nwill receive dedicated professional advice and administrative backup for improvements. \n \n76. \nThe financial strength of PDMC airlines poses a risk to their ability to pay service fees for \nadequate  regulation  and  oversight.  However,  all  airlines  are  required  to  enhance  their  safety \nand  security  measures,  so  costs  to  airlines  would  go  up  with  or  without  the  Project.  The \nperception of high costs should be placed in perspective; annual PASO service fees per country \nare equivalent to the cost of a few weeks of fuel for one modern jet. As the least-cost solution to \nthis  problem,  PASO  minimizes  the  risk.  If  government-owned  airlines  do  face  payment \ndifficulties,  government  counterpart  contributions  may  have  to  be  increased.  However,  these \ncontributions are very low so this related risk would have a low impact. In the extreme case of \npayment default, PASO would be able to adjust its staffing and operational schedules to reduce \ncosts until the problem was resolved.  \n \n77. \nThe  institutional  risks  arise  from  the  need  for  governments,  airlines,  and  international \nagencies to cooperate in reforming and harmonizing the regulatory and legislative environment. \nICAO has already recognized PASO as a legitimate international organization and will exercise \nquality control through regular USOAP audits in each country. Governments will need to ensure \ncooperation between aviation ministries and ministries that draft and enact legislation. Since this \nactivity  will  be  the  responsibility  of  each  national  administration,  with  TA  support,  the  risk  of \nincomplete  implementation  is  moderate.  However  the  benefits  of  harmonization  are  clear  to \nairlines, which may be expected to advocate completion. \n \n78. \nindustry, and will not affect travel demand, it will have no environmental impacts. \n \n\nSince  the  Project  is  intended  to  maintain  the  viability  of  an  existing  regional  aviation \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2003.

Manila  (TA  6119-REG, \n\napproved on 9 January 2004). \n\n\f15 \n\nG. \n\nOverall Assessment \n\n79. \nAs  ICAO  members  and  signatories  to  the  Chicago  Convention,  the  PASO  PDMCs  are \nobligated to ensure aviation safety and security. These countries have three ways to meet their \nobligations: through PASO, contracting for services, or expanding national administrations. The \nidentified  risks  would  apply  equally  to  PASO  and  to  the  alternatives.  However,  PASO  is  the \nleast-cost solution, offers additional quality of service benefits, and can become financially self-\nsufficient to ensure the continuing availability of its services. It is the best solution because of its \ncost-effectiveness and ability to make qualitative improvements. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, PASO and the Guarantors, as applicable, have \n\n80. \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nBefore  the  end  of  2006,  PASO  will  have  (a)  established  and  commenced \nimplementation of the ICAO SARPs for airline certification system and audits; (b) \ndesigned  the  regional  surveillance  program;  (c)  commenced  field  inspections; \nand (d) developed and commenced the training program for the national CAAs, \nairlines,  and  airport  operators  on  new  safety  and  security  systems  and  related \ninspection, surveillance, and certification programs. \n\nBefore the end of 2006, with respect to the regional surveillance and inspection \nsystem, PASO will have (a) designed and implemented an MRAI plan for Kiribati, \nPapua  New  Guinea,  Samoa,  Solomon  Islands,  and  Vanuatu;  (b)  developed \ntechnical  guidance  material  in  each  specialized  discipline;  (c)  created  an \ninspection  documentation  and  issue  resolution  system;  and  (d)  established  a \ncomprehensive  record-keeping  system  and  an  electronic  database  system  for \nrecording,  archiving,  and  reporting  inspection,  surveillance,  and  certification \nactivities in a manner that is transparent, and made the systems available to all \nPASO members.  \n\nPASO shall ensure that the PASO members will provide, in a timely manner, all \nnecessary  counterpart  funds  and  in-kind  contributions  for  successful  project \nimplementation. \n\n \n(iv)  Within 6 months from loan effectiveness, PASO will establish a PPMS to monitor \nand evaluate implementation and development impact at various project stages. \nPPMS  indicators  will  include  national  legislative  and  regulatory  improvements, \ntechnical \nfinancial \nperformance, and compliance with ICAO SARPs.  \n\norganizational \n\ncertifications, \n\nschedules, \n\ninspection \n\nFor  each  of  its  fiscal  years,  PASO  will  maintain  (a)  a  debt  service  ratio  of  net \nearnings  to  estimated  debt  service  requirements  greater  than  6,  and  (b)  a \nliquidity ratio of accounts receivable to revenues not greater than 25%. \n\nBeginning in year 6 of the operations, following completion of the Project, PASO \nwill  maintain  (a)  an  operating  ratio  of  operating  expenses  to  operating  revenue \nnot higher than 100%, and (b) earnings at least 1.5 times interest payments. \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \nB. \n\n81. \n \n\n \n\n(vii) \n\nPASO  will  recruit  management  and  senior  technical  staff  on  the  basis  of \nminimum 3-year contracts to ensure continuity in administration and operations. \n\n \n(viii)  PASO  and  ADB  will  conduct  a  midterm  review  of  the  Project  about  30  months \n\nafter loan effectiveness. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nAs conditions for loan effectiveness: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nEach of the PICASST and the PASO Constitution shall be in form and substance \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \nPASO  shall  have  been  registered  as  an  international  organization  under \nSchedule  6  of  the  Diplomatic  Privileges  and  Immunities  Act  of  Vanuatu  [CAP] \n143. \n \nEach of the Guarantors shall have signed or acceded to the PICASST. \n \nEach of the Guarantee Agreements shall be in full force and effect. \n \nFiji,  Kiribati,  Papua  New  Guinea,  Samoa,  Vanuatu  and  Solomon  Islands  shall \nhave  entered  into  service  agreements  with  PASO,  governing  the  financial \nobligations  of  those  receiving  PASO  services,  each  in  form  and  substance \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n82. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 1,033,000 to the Pacific Aviation Safety Office, \nto  be  guaranteed  on  a  several  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Kiribati,  Papua  New  Guinea,  the \nIndependent State of Samoa, and the Republic of Vanuatu, for the Establishment of the Pacific \nAviation  Safety  Office  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at \nthe rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter;

The  need  for  the  Project  to  build \nregional capacity is presented. A related institutional analysis that describes the optimal level of \noversight and national legislative and regulatory frameworks is in Appendix 4. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  extent  of  aviation  activity  varies  substantially  among  PDMCs,  from  the  extensive \naviation industries of the two larger countries, to the much smaller ones of all the others. Table \nA3.1 provides indicators of the aircraft fleet and licensed personnel in the PASO PDMCs.  \n \n\nCurrent Level of Aviation Activity \n\nTable A3.1: National Aviation Industry Indicators \n\nFiji \nIslands \n\nKiribati \n\nPNG Samoa \n\nSolomon \nIslands \n\n \nVanuatu\n\n \n\nTotal\n\n11 \n\n1,723\n\n33\n\n2,189\n\nAircraft Registered \n\nAircraft \u2013 jets \nAircraft \u2013 not jets, greater \nthan 10 seats \n\nActive Pilots Licenses \nFlight Crew Licenses \u2013 not \npilot licenses \nOther Active Licenses \u2013 not \nflight crew \nCommercial Air Transport \nOperators \nAir Operator Certificates \nIssued \nValid Certificates of \nAirworthiness \nApproved Maintenance \nOrganizations \nNon-approved Maintenance \nOrganizations \n\nOperations Inspectors \n\n34 \n\n6 \n\n8 \n\n364 \n\n54 \n\n177 \n\n34 \n\n7 \n\n7 \n\n7 \n\n0 \n\n4 \n\n3 \n\n0 \n\n3 \n\n3 \n\n6 \n\n1 \n\n1 \n\n3 \n\n1 \n\n1 \n\n0 \n\n204\n\n10\n\n39\n\n2\n\n1,437\n\n29\n\n39\n\n204\n\n35\n\n0\n\n7\n\n5 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n35 \n\n0 \n\n11 \n\n2 \n\n2 \n\n5 \n\n1 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n4 \n\n0 \n\n3 \n\n8 \n\n0 \n\n11 \n\n1 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\n0 \n\n14\n\n266\n\n14\n\n1,661\n\n10\n\n266\n\n18\n\n72\n\n59\n\n43\n\n53\n\n46\n\n3\n\n11\n\n10\n\n1\n\n5\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n4 \n\nAirworthiness Inspectors \n5\n\u201c\u2014 \u201c = reliable data not available, PNG = Papua New Guinea. \nSources:  ADB.  2004.

Papua New Guinea alone accounts for three quarters of the overall fleet, and more \nthan half of the jets. Four of the six PASO  PDMCs operate modern jet equipment, even if the \nfleets are small. As a result, national capacity for safety and security regulation and oversight is \ndifficult to sustain due to diseconomies of scale. \n \n4. \nFive of these six countries have no operation inspectors and four have no airworthiness \ninspectors,  while  no  country  has  aerodromes  or  security  inspectors.  Where  no  local  capacity \nexists,  these  required  functions  are  contracted  to  the  civil  aviation  authorities  (CAAs)  of  more \ndeveloped countries outside the region, mainly Australia, New Zealand, and United Kingdom. A \nsummary of the safety oversight competency of each PASO member is in Table A3.2. \n \nOnly  Fiji  Islands  and  Papua  New  Guinea  have  independent  regulatory  agencies,  while \n5. \nthe  other  countries  combine  policy,  regulatory,  and  operational  functions  within  aviation \nministries.  In  addition,  all  international  airlines  are  government-owned,  creating  potential \nconflicts of interest.  \n \n\nTable A3.2: Summary of Safety and Security Oversight Competency \n\n \nFiji Islands \n \nThe CAA of the Fiji Islands oversees airport operators, air traffic control and air navigation service \nproviders,  aircraft  operators,  and  licensed  personnel.  The  flight  operations  department  has  five  staff \npositions;  four  are  held  by  three  expatriates  and  one  national.  The  airworthiness  department  has  three \nstaff positions, all filled by Fiji Island nationals. UKCAA provides one airworthiness advisor. \nKiribati \n \nThe CAA does not have any direct oversight capability. Airworthiness oversight is handled by the \nUKCAA representative in the Fiji Islands, who comes to Kiribati as required. However, this service may be \nterminated soon and no alternative system has yet been developed. There has been no flight operation \noversight for about 7 years. The CAA has been headed by a series of expatriate directors of civil aviation \nfor several years. \nPapua New Guinea \n \nThe CAA\u2019s Safety Directorate has five subdivisions: airworthiness (eight positions, five filled, two \nby  expatriates);  flight  operations  (nine  positions,  seven  filled  by  expatriates);  personnel  licensing  (three \npositions, one filled by an expatriate); standards (newly created, not yet staffed); and infrastructure (newly \ncreated, not yet staffed). AusAID provides technical assistance to train inspectors.  \nSamoa \n \ncontracts most of its responsibilities to the New Zealand CAA. \nSolomon Islands \n \nThe  CAA  has  no  oversight  capability.  All  oversight  should  be  handled  by  the  UKCAA \nrepresentative in the Fiji Islands, who should visit as needed; however, there have been no visits since \nlate 2000.  \nVanuatu \n \nThe  CAA  oversees  airworthiness  through  one  full-time  expatriate  officer,  and  flight  operations \nthrough  short-term  contracting.  Operational  oversight  for  Air  Vanuatu  is  provided  by  CASA  in  Australia, \nwhile licensing of private pilots is handled by a New Zealand-designated flight examiner. These licenses \nare issued by the state of examination (Australia and New Zealand) and these approvals are then used \nas the basis of issuing Vanuatu licenses. \nAusAID = Australian Agency for International Development, CAA = civil aviation authority, CASA = Civil \nAviation Safety Authority (Australia), UKCAA = United Kingdom civil aviation authority.  \nSources:  ADB.  2004.  Regional  Civil  Aviation  Safety  and  Security.  Manila  (TA  6119-REG);  Asian \nDevelopment Bank estimates. \n \n\nThe  ministry  does  not  have  any  capability  in  flight  operations  and  airworthiness  oversight,  and \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n23 \n\nImplications for Required Activities \n\nC. \n \n6. \nThe PASO PDMCs must move beyond the current patchwork oversight system and build \na  fully  capable  and  independent  oversight  system  responsive  to  national  and  regional  needs. \nThey  must  avoid  the  pitfalls  of  outsourcing  all  oversight  services  and  responsibilities\u2014\noverlooked requirements, delays in service, and lack of priority\u2014which they have experienced. \nA  regional  oversight  capacity  must  provide  reliable  and  responsive  oversight  services  to  the \nmembers  and  their  air  transport  operators  on  demand.  Service  quality  must  be  improved, \nbecome more responsive to national needs, and provide a greater margin of safety.  \n \n7. \nMost  PASO  PDMCs  wish  to  reduce  safety  oversight  costs  although  they  have  not \nfunded  and  staffed  their  respective  CAAs  to  meet  minimum  International  Civil  Aviation \nOrganization  (ICAO)  standards.  The  cost  of  achieving  compliance  will  be  higher  than  current \nexpenditures whether the services are provided by PASO or other agencies. \n \n\n1. \n\nSurveillance and Inspection Programs  \n\n8. \nInspection  and  surveillance  programs  need  to  create  capacity  in  flight  operations, \nairworthiness,  aerodromes,  and  security.  The  scale  of  the  regional  industry  means  that  flight \noperations and airworthiness each require one full-time inspector. These staff members should \nalso be able to perform aerodrome oversight. Security oversight requires a dedicated inspector \nwith  a  very  high  level  of  knowledge,  experience,  and  expertise  because  of  security  concerns \nand demands worldwide. One well-qualified security inspector could provide adequate security \noversight services to the region.  \n \n9. \nAll  technical  staff  must  be  highly  skilled  and  experienced  regulators,  not  former  airline \npersonnel with operations and airworthiness experience. Technical staff inspectors should have \nexperience  in  policy  and  as  line  inspectors.  A  regional  organization  will  require  a  general \nmanager with regulatory and policy experience, and equally solid skills as a technical inspector.  \n \n10. \nBecause  the  Pacific  region  needs  full-time  permanent  capability,  staff  from  better-\ndeveloped organizations will not be seconded. Organizations such as the US Federal Aviation \nAdministration,  ICAO,  and  the  European  Joint  Aviation  Administration  occasionally  provide \nexpertise but normally for short-term assignments. A negative aspect of secondment is that the \ntechnical  experts  are  not  typically  from  the  Pacific  region  and  have  to  spend  an  inordinate \namount of time learning the regulatory system.  \n \n\n2. \n\nAirline Recertification  \n\n11. \nSafety  certification  of  an  airline  is  an  obligation  of  the  state  and  an  ICAO  requirement, \nand  must  be  completed  before  flight  operations.  However,  the  airlines  operating  in  the  PASO \nPDMCs  are  effectively  self-regulating,  as  they  have  been  operating  for  many  years  with  little \nsurveillance  or  inspection  from  any  regulatory  authority.  With  few  exceptions,  many  airlines \nhave never had a competent ICAO-compliant safety certification as required by ICAO standards \nand  recommended  practices  (SARPs).  In  addition  to  establishing  a  standardized  safety \noversight system and surveillance program for the region, these countries also need to recertify \nor revalidate the air operator certificates (AOCs) of their airlines.  \n \nThe airline certification and surveillance and inspection programs required by ICAO are \n12. \nrelated  but  very  different  in  their  purpose  and  effect.  The  certification  of  an  airline  before \ninternational  operations  establishes  the  fitness  of  the  operator  and  serves  as  the  baseline  for \ncontinuing  surveillance  and  inspection  by  the  regulatory  authority.  The  AOC  is  the  state\u2019s \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nPotential Regional Capacity \n\nguarantee  to  other  nations  that  its  airline  is  fit  to  operate  internationally  and  meets  all  ICAO \nrequirements.  The  continuing  surveillance,  inspection,  and  audit  of  the  operator  by  the  state \nguarantee  to  other  nations  that  the  airline  continues  to  meet  the  original  certification \nrequirements  for  the  issuance  of  an  AOC.  Both  programs  are  necessary  and  need  to  be \naccomplished in all the PASO PDMCs as soon as possible. \n \n13. \nAn air operator recertification effort of this magnitude will require a higher level of staffing \nthan  will  an  ongoing  surveillance  and  inspection  program.  A  regional  technical  staff  member \nwould  be  fully  occupied  in  designing  and  implementing  a  regulatory  system  and  initiating  an \ninspection and surveillance program. A separate team could recertify all air operators holding an \nAOC from any of the PASO PDMCs. Most airline recertification work should be outsourced on a \nshort-term basis to avoid overstaffing. \n \nD. \n \n14. \nThe technical level of effort necessary to return each of the PASO PDMCs to minimum \nICAO  standards  is  much  higher  than  feasible  now,  whether  these  are  provided  through \ndomestic organizations or through external contracting, as most of these countries have neither \nsufficient personnel to do the job internally nor sufficient resources to plan and manage external \nexpertise. \n \n15. \nAll  of  the  PASO  PDMCs  have  the  capability  to  implement  administrative  procedures \nrecommended by a competent safety oversight organization. Changes to national civil aviation \nlaws will by necessity be processed by the independent members. However, with the exception \nof  the  Fiji  Islands  and  Papua  New  Guinea,  none  of  the  PASO  PDMCs  have  the  resident \ncapability to design and implement the necessary technical systems. Regional capacity is thus \nrequired  to produce  and  implement  the  regulations  and  guidance  material  through inspections \nand audits.  \n \n16. \nPASO is intended to provide advisory, certification, inspection, and surveillance services \nto the national CAAs and aviation industries of its members by identifying deficiencies, setting \nout remedial steps, and monitoring implementation through to full compliance. PASO must take \na systems approach to develop and implement an oversight regime to include the development \nof surveillance and inspection programs. \n \n17. \nThe aviation environments of the PASO PDMCs vary in complexity and in the degree of \ndevelopment  of  safety  oversight  capabilities.  Generally,  the  more  complex  the  commercial \naviation  environment,  the  more  sophisticated  the  flight  safety  organization.  The  merit  of  the \nProject stems from its multifaceted role. All members will benefit from the activities undertaken \nby  the  Project  to  improve  and  harmonize  laws,  regulations,  and  procedures;  a  wide  range  of \nsupplemental  technical  assistance;  and  continuous  audits  of  national  oversight  needs.  As \ncountries  take  steps  to  improve  their  organizations  and  capabilities,  the  Project  will  reinforce \nthose efforts and continue to provide supplementary assistance after improvements are made. \n \nPASO  is  governed  by  a  Council  of  Directors,  which  represents  member  governments \n18. \nand  includes  advisers  from  the  aviation  industry,  multilateral  agencies,  and  established  safety \noversight authorities. Its mandate,  which is founded  in the Pacific Islands Civil Aviation Safety \nand Security Treaty, is to provide guidance, strategy, and policy, and to resolve problems.  \n \n19. \nPASO  cannot  replace  CAAs\u2019  authority  or  responsibility  for  aviation  safety  oversight. \nAlthough members will rely on PASO advice and recommendations to resolve safety issues and \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n25 \n\nto  maintain  compliance  with  ICAO  SARPs,  they  remain  responsible  for  implementing  PASO \nadvice and recommendations.  \n \n20. \nThe  PASO  Council  of  Directors  must  proactively  communicate  the  need  for,  and \npromote, a complete and thorough revamping of the PASO PDMCs\u2019 safety oversight means and \nmethods. What must be clear and unambiguous to the PASO members is the need for a safety \noversight system, not the ad hoc and often piecemeal approach in evidence.  \n \nPASO has been recognized by ICAO headquarters in Montreal, Canada, as a legitimate \n21. \ninternational organization. The United States Federal Aviation Administration and the European \nJoint  Aviation  Administration  have  expressed  their  support  for  regional  safety  oversight  in \ngeneral  and  for  PASO  in  particular  in  recent  international  meetings.  International  institutional \nsupport  for  PASO  will  be  instrumental  in  achieving  the  credibility  to  provide  regional  oversight \nservices. \n \n22. \nBased  on  the  analysis  of  safety  oversight  and  regulation  requirements,  in  comparison \nwith  national  capacities,  an  independent  regional  organization  such  as  PASO  is  clearly \nnecessary  and  feasible.  PASO  can  provide  core  technical  regulatory  services  and  expertise \nallowing  its  PDMCs  to  meet  their  safety  oversight  obligations  and  improve  their  oversight \ncapabilities through technical and institutional cooperation.  \n \n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nINSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS \n\nRequired and Current Status of Oversight \n\n \n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe international standards of competence and compliance applied to a safety oversight \nsystem are  based on the Convention on International Civil Aviation (the Chicago Convention), \nwhich  assigns  responsibility  to  the International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  to  organize \nand  publish  standards  and  recommended  practices  (SARPs)  in  the  form  of  annexes  and \nsupporting documentation. ICAO has developed and maintains 18 annexes covering all aspects \nof civil aviation safety oversight, supported by related publications.  \n \nThe  uniform  application  of  ICAO  SARPs  by  ICAO  members  is  necessary  for  safe  and \n2. \nefficient  international  air  operations.  All  ICAO  members,  as  signatories  to  the  Chicago \nConvention,  are  obligated  to  secure  the  highest  practical  degree  of  uniformity  in  regulations, \nstandards,  and  procedures;  ensure  their  effective  implementation;  and  notify  ICAO  of  any \ndifferences  between  their  national  regulations  or  practices  and  ICAO  SARPs.  From  a  safety \noversight perspective, an ICAO member\u2019s responsibilities under the Convention include:  \n \n\nairports and navigation aids; \naviation security;  \ncertification of aircraft, air operators, and maintenance organizations;  \nregistration of its aircraft for the purpose of ensuring airworthiness; \nissuance  of  an  air  operator  certificate  (AOC)  to  control  and  supervise  the \noperationally related activities of each aircraft operator in the state;  \nlicensing, control, and supervision of personnel, certified products, and approved \norganizations;  \nensuring  adequacy  of  the  air  operator\u2019s  ability  to  provide  safe  and  efficient \noperations prior to the initiation of international flight operations; \nensuring  that  the  operator  can  conduct  operations  with  respect  to  the  original \ncertification criteria on a continuing basis; and \ntaking timely and necessary actions to resolve safety issues relating to meeting \nthe national civil aviation law and regulations. \n\nICAO  defines  eight  critical  elements  of  a  safety  oversight  system  that  must  be \n\n \n3. \nconsidered by every country: \n \n\nprimary  aviation  law:  consistent  with  the  environment  and  complexity  of  the \naviation industry; \nspecific  operating  regulations:  adequate  to  address  at  least  the  convention  and \nannex standards; \nCAA structure and safety oversight functions: adequate resources and technical \nsupervisory and support personnel;  \ntechnical  guidance:    sufficient  for  technical  and  support  personnel  to  perform \ntheir functions in a standardized manner; \nqualified  technical  personnel  to  inspect  the  aviation  activities  to  the  level  of \ncomplexity required; \nlicensing  and  certification  obligations:  processes  that  the  aviation  community \nmust complete before initiating the tasks and operations associated with the level \nof certificate issued; \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n27 \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\ncontinued surveillance obligations: processes to ensure that the aviation industry \nfunctions at minimum levels of competency and safety; and \nresolution  of  safety  issues:  processes  and  methodologies  to  resolve  safety \nissues, including the ability to penalize individuals or operators and to suspend or \nrevoke their authority. \n\n \n4. \nThese  elements  of  a  safety  oversight  system  are  required  to  ensure  that  the  country\u2019s \nregulatory  system  is  appropriate  to  the  complexity  of  its  aviation  industry.  However,  all  the \nPASO PDMCs, with the exception of the Fiji Islands and to a lesser degree Papua New Guinea, \nare unable to fully meet all of their safety oversight obligations under the Chicago Convention in \naccordance with ICAO SARPs.  \n \nAs a result, all but one PASO PDMC has received unsatisfactory results from the ICAO-\n5. \nmandated universal safety oversight audit program (USOAP) during initial and follow-up audits. \nCommon deficiencies in the eight critical elements include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nPrimary aviation legislation in most countries is seriously noncompliant with ICAO \nSARPs. Common deficiencies include the lack of provision to establish a CAA, a \nlack of authority to promulgate aviation regulations, and lack of process to update \nthe civil aviation law to meet ICAO requirements. \nSpecific  operating  regulations  across  the  region  generally  need  substantial \nimprovement.  Even  members  that  have  adopted  regulations  from  a  competent \nsource  have  not  fully  developed  them.  Typically,  there  are  neither  systems  of \norders,  directives,  and  instructions  to  establish  policies  and  procedures  for  a \nnational  safety  oversight  system,  nor  systems  to  create  new  or  amend  existing \nregulations. As a result, most regulations do not address all ICAO SARPs. \nCAA  safety  oversight  functions  and  continuing  surveillance  obligations  are \nhindered, and most of the region's CAAs are unable to fulfill their safety oversight \nresponsibilities because they lack adequate government budgetary support. This \ncontributes directly to poor facilities and an inability to recruit and retain technical \nstaff.  Several  CAAs  are  headed  by  staff  members  with  no  formal  training  in \naviation, a problem compounded by a lack of technical training programs.  \nTechnical guidance systems and materials are underdeveloped and incomplete. \nSeveral  countries  have  no  inspector  handbooks,  policies,  orders,  or  directives, \nand  some  CAAs  have  not  established  a  flight  operation  inspectorate  system \nsupported by regulations and procedures so that its own technical personnel can \nsupervise air transport operations.  \nQualified  technical  personnel  are  in  short  supply,  many  of  the  technical  staff \npositions  are  vacant,  and  few  CAA  personnel  assigned  to  flight  operations  are \npilots.  The  aggregate  personnel  numbers  (Table  A3.1)  do  not  account  for \nexpertise. Expatriate technical personnel are generally more highly qualified than \nnationals  but  are  in  the  minority.  Consequently,  little  oversight  is  undertaken  by \nmost CAAs, and airlines are effectively self-regulating. \nLicensing  and  certification  obligations  need  improvement.  Some  countries  have \nno  regulatory  requirements  or  procedures  to  issue  an  air  operator\u2019s  certificate \n(AOC)  and  related  operations  specifications.  These  functions  are  typically \noutsourced ad hoc.  \n\n \nSimilar results are expected with the new requirements for security audits, which entered \n6. \ninto  force  in  January  2005,  under  the  ICAO-mandated  Universal  Security  Oversight  Audit \nProgram. \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nNational Legislative and Regulatory Frameworks \n\n \nD. \n \n7. \nNational  legislation  is  often  outdated  and  inadequate  for  a  modern  regulatory  system, \nand related operating regulations across the region generally need substantial improvement. A \nsummary of the status of national frameworks is in Table A4. \n \n\nTable A4: Summary of National Legislative and Regulatory Capabilities \n\nThe civil aviation law, enacted in 1949 and not amended since colonial times, is grossly outdated. \n\nThe  civil  aviation  law,  with  minor  exceptions,  appears  to  meet  ICAO  requirements.  With  minor \n\n \nFiji Islands \n \nexceptions, the CAA seems fully capable of exercising its international obligations. \nKiribati \n \nThe country has no safety oversight capability. \nPapua New Guinea \n \nThe  civil  aviation  law,  with  minor  exceptions,  appears  to  meet  ICAO  requirements.  Regulations \nare  in  transition,  but  the  support  contract  to  revise  the  regulations  has  been  suspended  due  to  funding \nconstraints.  Air  New  Guinea  conducts  ETOPS  operations  but  has  no  qualified  operations  inspector  for \ncompetent inspection or surveillance of these operations.  \nSamoa \n \nThe CAA has some in-house safety oversight capability but contracts with the New Zealand CAA \nfor  most  of  its  technical  oversight  obligations  and  could  not  stand  alone  from  a  technical  oversight \nperspective. \nSolomon Islands \n \nThe  civil  aviation  law  is  outdated  as  it  has  not  been  revised  in  almost  a  decade,  has  not  been \namended  to  incorporate  industry  practices  or  ICAO  SARPs.  The  country  has  no  safety  oversight \ncapability. \nVanuatu \n \nThe civil aviation law does not meet many ICAO requirements and needs revision and updating. \nThe CAA claims to be using the New Zealand regulations but the law does not reflect their adoption. The \nCAA has one airworthiness inspector and contracts an operations inspector for a period of 2 weeks per \nyear, but this is inadequate for national operations.  \nCAA= civil aviation authority, ICAO = International Civil Aviation Organization, ETOPS = extended range \ntwin engine operations, SARPs = standards and recommended practices. \nSources:  ADB.  2004.

Starting  from  existing  costs  of \noversight  (which  are  known  to  provide  inadequate  services),  the  economic  and  financial \nanalyses compare the costs of audit and oversight functions if they were to be upgraded to an \nacceptable  level  through  expansion  of  existing  arrangements  versus  expected  costs  to  obtain \nacceptable oversight provided through PASO.  \n \nA. \n \nA summary of the available data on overall costs of airworthiness and flight operations \n2. \noversight in PASO PDMCs is in Table A8.1.

These estimates are, \ntherefore, the lower bounds of expenditure for inadequate oversight and regulation in all cases \nexcept the Fiji Islands and Papua New Guinea.  \n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\nProjected Cost of Required Oversight Under Existing Arrangements \n\nB. \n \n4. \nWith the exception of the Fiji Islands, oversight is inadequate in all other PASO PDMCs, \nas  they  do  not  fully  meet  all  required  ICAO  SARPs  through  institutionalized  safety  systems \napproaches.  Airline  recertification,  creation  of  technical  guidance  material,  establishment  of  a \ndatabase to resolve safety issues, and legal assistance are all required to return the PDMCs to \na  minimum  acceptable  baseline.  Providing  acceptable  oversight  by  expanding  existing \narrangements would mean that countries would forego cost savings to their airlines inherent in a \nharmonized  operating  environment,  as  well  as  some  of  the  advantages  of  joint  administrative \nsupport. \n \n5. \nAnnual costs of required oversight are based on a minimum required annual inspection \n(MRAI) program that would increase oversight to adequate levels through additional inspections \nin all disciplines, and provide administrative backup to the individual CAAs that is not currently \navailable through existing contract arrangements. Since the Fiji Islands intends to remain self-\nsufficient, it does not require significant additional services under any future scenario and has, \ntherefore,  been  removed  from  the  comparison.1  A  summary  of  annual  costs  using  expanded \ncontracts under existing arrangements is in Table A8.2 below.2\n \n\nTable A8.2: Summary of Projected Annual Costs of Required Oversight  \nUnder Expansion of Existing Arrangements  \n($\u2019000) \n\nSolomon \nIslandse\n43 \n54 \n32 \n22 \n151 \n\nTotal  \n\n49 \n62 \n32 \n22 \n166 \n\n56 \n71 \n32 \n22 \n181 \n\nKiribatib PNGc Samoad\n58 \n77 \n32 \n22 \n189 \n\nActivitya\nAirworthiness  \nFlight Operations  \nSecurity \nAerodromes \n \nPNG = Papua New Guinea. \na Includes validation of personnel licensing in each discipline. \nb Based on current United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority (UKCAA) contract rates. \nc Based on existing Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) national and expatriate staff costs. \nd Based on current CAA of New Zealand contract rates. \ne Based on current UKCAA contract rates. \nf Based on existing CAA expatriate staff costs and contracted assistance from the Civil Aviation Safety \nAuthority of Australia. \ng Costs include travel, per diem, and overhead for contracted services. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates from aviation authority and airline data. \n\n \nVanuatuf\n78 \n97 \n32 \n22 \n228 \n\n \nTotalg\n285 \n362 \n160 \n108 \n915 \n\nProjected Cost of Required Oversight Under PASO \n\n \nC. \n \n6. \nProjected  costs  to  provide  oversight  through  PASO  comprise  four  elements:  personnel \ncosts,  travel,  overheads,  and  office  accommodation.  PASO  professional  staff  will  include  a \ngeneral  manager  (also  qualified  in  a  technical  discipline)  and  one  inspector  each  for \nairworthiness  and  avionics,  flight  operations,  and  security.

Without \nthe Project, safety oversight would be provided by expanding existing contracting arrangements \n(section B). With the Project, safety oversight would be provided through PASO (section C). In \nboth scenarios, the annual net economic benefits are the difference between the financial costs \nof providing services, without any adjustment, since in all cases the inputs (technical assistance \nversus  expatriate  labor,  plus  travel)  are  traded  and  the  analysis  uses  border  prices  as \nnumeraire.

Nationally, PASO offers the same cost-effectiveness in \nall  its  members  requiring  services,  except  for  Papua  New  Guinea,  which  has  national  and \nexpatriate inspectors. In aggregate, these costs savings are equivalent to 14% per year, with a \nnet  present  value  of  approximately  $573,000  and  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  30% \nover the 20-year planning period.  \n \nBesides providing the minimum required oversight, PASO is expected to offer services \n11. \nthat  are  qualitatively  better  than  ad  hoc  contracting,  since  it  will  be  a  regionally  controlled \ninternational  organization  dedicated  to  the  needs  of  its  members.  PASO  will  result  in \nharmonization that reduces compliance costs of airlines, and standardized record keeping that \nimproves  international  compliance  of  governments.  PASO  will  provide  national  CAAs  with \nadministrative  backup  that  is  not  available  through  current  contracting  arrangements.  These \nqualitative  advantages  are  not  captured  in  the  financial  and  economic  estimates,  so  the \nanalytical results should be understood as a lower bound on the total benefits of the Project. \n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\nF. \n \n12. \nPASO will generate revenues though service fees paid by the aviation industry, as is the \ncurrent practice. Since only four PASO members will become guarantors, while the others will \nbe charged a premium of 10% above basic cost-recovery level in lieu of a capital contribution. \nThis premium will also apply to nonmembers that contract PASO services. \n \n13. \nSolomon Islands\u2019 needs for safety oversight are in transition so the country will not draw \non the full range of PASO services for the first several years. Since it will not require oversight of \ninternational airline operations for the next few years, but will require oversight of security and \naerodromes, estimated  PASO revenues have  been reduced by 25%  for the first 5 years. This \nsituation is expected to be resolved well within the 5-year project period. \n \n14. \nThe  time  lag  between  the  start  of  operations  and  revenue  generation,  the  need  to \nfinance inception activities, and the temporarily reduced participation of Solomon Islands mean \nthat  upfront  finance  is  required  to  achieve  eventual  self-sufficiency.  Under  these  conditions,  a \nloan  of  $1.5  million  will  be  adequate  to  finance  the  startup  costs  and  transition  to  self-\nsufficiency. The balance of the financial requirements will be met through revenues generated \nfrom services provided to airlines and airport operators in PASO PDMCs.
