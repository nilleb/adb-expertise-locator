THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of the Maldives for the Kulhudhuffushi Harbor Expansion Project.1 The report \nalso  describes  the  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Development  for \nSustainable Harbor Operation and Maintenance, and if the Board approves the proposed grant, \nI, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The project will construct a passenger and cargo harbor on Kulhudhuffushi Island, which \nwill be an expansion to the existing multipurpose harbor.2 For the investment in the harbor \ninfrastructure to be effective and sustainable, TA will be provided and attached to the project to \nenhance the institutional capacity of the operator in harbor operation, maintenance, safety, and \nfinancial management. The TA is also designed to help promote income-generating livelihood \nopportunities for local communities in the northern region of the Maldives. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The Maldives consists of 1,190 coral islands formed by 20 natural atolls and scattered \nover 90,000 square kilometers of territory in the Indian Ocean, making it one of the most \ndispersed countries in the world. The country\u2019s total population was around 402,000 in 2014, \nwith 96% of the population distributed across 188 administrative islands, 123 of which are \noccupied by fewer than 1,000 people.3 These geographic and demographic characteristics pose \nmajor development challenges in the country in terms of infrastructure development, provision \nof basic social services, and access to equitable economic opportunities. \n \n4.  In 2014, 38% of the Maldives\u2019 population lived in and around Mal\u00e9, the capital city and \nurban center in the central region (footnote 3). Mal\u00e9 remains the country\u2019s fastest growing and \nmost  populated  city,  with  rapid  expansion  of  both  the  public  and  private  sectors  and \nestablishment of major health and educational facilities. To help reduce the fiscal burden, the \nGovernment  of  the  Maldives  has  decided  to  further  develop  the  greater  Mal\u00e9  area  to \naccommodate about 70% of the country\u2019s population. This development is expected to take \ntime, and in the meantime, the government views developments in remote atolls, which house \nthe remainder of the population, as critical to strengthening the country's economy. \n \n5.  Lack  of  transport  connectivity  is  a  major  constraint  to  the  country\u2019s  inclusive  and \nsustainable development goals in remote atolls, particularly in the northern region,4 which have \na  high  number  of  inhabitants  living  below  the  poverty  line.5 Imbalances  in  accessibility  to \nopportunities, enterprise, markets, and services in the northern region constrain the government \nfrom achieving broad-based economic growth, which is one of the major development goals \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Kulhudhuffushi     \n   Harbor Expansion Project. \n3 Government of the Maldives, National Bureau of Statistics. 2014.

To address the widening socioeconomic disparity in the northern region, the government \nis developing Kulhudhuffushi Island as an urban center where services and socioeconomic \nactivities will be concentrated. Kulhudhuffushi is a major population center in the region, with a \npopulation of 8,200 as of 2014 (footnote 3). Currently, Kulhudhuffushi is home to the regional \nhospital  that  provides  general  medical,  specialist,  dental,  emergency,  and  intensive  care \nservices. The island also houses primary, secondary, and tertiary education facilities, including \na  vocational  training  center,  designed  to  cater  to  approximately  2,500  students  from \nKulhudhuffushi and nearby islands. \n \n7.  Residents of other islands travel daily to Kulhudhuffushi for work, use of the island\u2019s \nhealth and education facilities, or recreational purposes, reflecting Kulhudhuffushi\u2019s role as a \nkey regional maritime connection and cargo interchange point for the northern region. With the \nongoing development of Kulhudhuffushi as the northern region\u2019s urban center, the government \nhas decided that the existing interisland connectivity in the region will be inadequate to allow \nefficient access to Kulhudhuffushi\u2019s services and opportunities, as mandated in the Seventh \nNational Development Plan, 2006\u20132010 (footnote 6). Therefore, the government envisioned that \nadditional  harbor  capacity  and  more  efficient  operation  will  be  required  at  Kulhudhuffushi \nHarbor. This expansion is expected to benefit around 30,000 inhabitants living in the dispersed \nouter islands within a 30-kilometer radius of Kulhudhuffushi. \n \n8.  The multipurpose Kulhudhuffushi Harbor is currently used for passenger traffic, bulk \ncargo  traffic,  commercial  fishing,  and  transport  of  agricultural  commodities.  The  proposed \nadditional  capacity  to  the  harbor  will  be  required  to  prevent  congestion,  reduce  delays  in \naccessing a berth and mooring facilities in the basin, and encourage new transport links either \nat the regional or national level. At present there are around 150 vessels operating out of the \nharbor every day. It is estimated that increasing the capacity to cater to at least 250 vessels per \nday  would  be  required  to  support  Kulhudhuffushi\u2019s  development  as  an  urban  center.  The \ngovernment plans to increase harbor capacity by constructing a new passenger and cargo \nharbor to cater to larger vessels, and through more efficient and sustained harbor operation. \nThe new passenger harbor will also facilitate long-distance passenger service from the central \nand southern regions as recommended in the Maldives\u2019 Maritime Transport Master Plan.8 \n \n9.  The proposed project will bring about inclusive socioeconomic benefits to the inhabitants \nof the northern region, and help reduce socioeconomic disparities between the central and \nnorthern  regions.  It  aims  to  connect  services,  markets,  people,  and  harbors  through  an \nintegrated transport system with greater accessibility and affordability for all residents. It is \naligned with the strategic objective established in the interim country partnership strategy, 2016 \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to enhance movement of people and goods, including at \nthe regional level.9 \n \n                                                \n6  Government of the Maldives, Ministry of Planning and National Development. 2007.

The impact will be enhanced access to services by 2020, aligned with the government\u2019s \nSeventh National Development Plan, 2006\u20132010 and Manifesto of the Progressive Party of \nMaldives for 2013 to 2017. The outcome will be improved interisland connectivity in the northern \nregion. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The outputs will be (i) increased harbor passenger and cargo capacity in Kulhudhuffushi \nthrough  expansion  of  the  existing  multipurpose  harbor,  and  (ii)  strengthened  institutional \ncapacity in harbor operation, maintenance, safety, and financial management (para. 18).  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n12.  The project is estimated to cost $10.44 million, including taxes and duties (Table 1).

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $9.69 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the project.11 \n \n14.  The ADB grant will finance 92.82% of the project cost; the government will bear local \ntaxes and duties. The government commits that it will finance any shortfall in the finances, if \nrequired. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n                                                \n10 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its \nrisk of debt distress.

However, the Maldives was eligible to receive 100% of its Asian Development Fund allocation as \ngrants based on the 2014 debt sustainability analysis. \n ", "4 \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank      \n       Special Funds resources (grant)  9.69  92.82 \nGovernment  0.75  7.18 \nTotal  10.44  100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The executing agency will be the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT) and the \nimplementing agency will be the Ministry of Housing and Infrastructure (MHI). The MHI will \nestablish a project management unit (PMU) to assist it during implementation. The PMU will be \nresponsible for day-to-day project implementation and management, and it will report directly to \nthe director general of the Infrastructure Department of the MHI. The PMU will consist of a \nproject director, a project officer, and a project accountant, who will all be recruited by the MHI \nusing  the  individual  consultant  selection  method.  The  project  director  of  the  PMU  will  be \ndelegated technical and administrative authority for expeditious project implementation. The \nMHI will also recruit an international consulting firm as the project management consultant \n(PMC) for general project management support, detailed design, procurement, and construction \nsupervision. For the PMC recruitment, consulting firms will be requested to submit a simplified \ntechnical proposal, and the selection will be in accordance with the quality- and cost-based \nmethod,  using  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  90:10.  Procurement  of  works  will  be  undertaken  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). All \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). \n \n16.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 10). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  November 2016\u2013December 2019 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2019 (Grant closing date: 30 June 2020) \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Project steering committee, comprising senior officials from the \nMinistry of Housing and Infrastructure (chair), the Ministry of \nFinance and Treasury, and the Ministry of Economic Development \nof the Government of the Maldives (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Finance and Treasury \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  Ministry of Housing and Infrastructure \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Project management unit located at the Ministry of Housing and \nInfrastructure, 3 staff \nProcurement  International  1 contract  $8.11 million \ncompetitive bidding \nShopping  1 contract  $10,000 \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost- 46 person-months  $899,000 \nbased selection \nIndividual consultant  78 person-months  $170,000 \nselection \nRetroactive financing and/or  Retroactive financing and advance contracting for consultant \nadvance contracting  recruitment and project management \n ", "5 \nAspects  Arrangements \nDisbursement   The grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the \ngovernment and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n17.  The  government  has  requested  retroactive  financing  for  eligible  expenditures  on \nconsulting services and project management for up to 20% of the grant proceeds, incurred \nbefore  grant  effectiveness  but  not  earlier  than  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  grant \nagreement. Advance contracting for consultant recruitment was provided by default; recruitment \nof the PMC is ongoing. The government has been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing in principle does not commit ADB to finance the project.12 \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n18.  TA will be provided to strengthen the institutional capacity of the agencies responsible \nfor harbor operation and maintenance in Kulhudhuffushi. To achieve this objective, the TA will (i) \ntrain the staff of the Secretariat of the Kulhudhuffushi Council and the staff of Public Works \nServices in Kulhudhuffushi on sustainable harbor operation, maintenance, safety, and financial \nmanagement; (ii) implement a harbor safety campaign and conduct training for vessel drivers in \npassenger safety; (iii) conduct a feasibility study and recommend action plan for introducing \nharbor user charging in Kulhudhuffushi; and (iv) train local residents on income-generating \nlivelihood opportunities.13 The TA is estimated to cost $543,200, of which $500,000 will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-V).  The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, logistical support, and other in-\nkind contributions. The executing agency of the TA will be the MOFT and the implementing \nagency will be the MHI. The TA will be implemented over 18 calendar-months, from January \n2017 to June 2018. An international consulting firm will be recruited as the capacity building \nconsultant. The recruitment will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants. The consulting firm will be asked to submit a biodata technical proposal, and the \nselection will be in accordance with the quality- and cost-based selection method, using a \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n19.  The project is considered viable based on due diligence and assessments of the costs, \nbenefits,  and  impacts.  It  will  benefit  the  islands  of  the  Maldives  by  improving  access  to \nsocioeconomic activities and services in the northern region. \n \nA.  Technical  \n20.  The preliminary engineering design was completed during the project preparatory stage. \nThe design objective was to minimize environmental impacts by minimizing the project footprint, \nand to promote cost efficiency while meeting the increasing travel demand in the northern \nregion. The  harbor  area  comprises  a main  basin for  passenger  and cargo  vessels  and  a \nmooring  area  for  smaller  boats.  The  proposed  expansion  comprises  (i)  construction  of \nbreakwaters, a quay wall, and revetments; and (ii) dredging of the main harbor basin up to 4 \n                                                \n12  ADB. 2015.

Manila.  \n13   Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nmeters below mean sea level. An administrative building and trading facilities are included as \npart  of the  harbor\u2019s  ancillary  facilities.  Given  that  the  Maldives  is  a  low-lying  country, the \npreliminary design considered the impacts of climate change such as the increase of the mean \nsea level and storm surges. The harbor infrastructure also has cost-effective shore protection \nfeatures to enhance resilience against such impacts. \n \n21.  Actions during the project preparatory stage to improve institutional capacity in harbor \noperation, maintenance, safety, and financial management in Kulhudhuffushi will be addressed \nby the TA. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  Economic analysis, which was undertaken according to ADB guidelines,14 concluded \nthat the project is economically viable.15 The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is \n12.70% and the economic net present value is $415,800. A discount rate of 12% was adopted \nfor the analysis. The economic analysis compared the benefits and costs of with- and without-\nproject situations. The potential benefits include travel time and cost savings for existing users \nof the harbor, generated demand due to the increased connectivity, operational efficiency, \nemployment benefits, safety benefits, erosion protection, and utilization of surplus dredging \nmaterial. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the economic viability \nof the project and determine the impact of key input parameters on the EIRR. Ten scenarios \nwere analyzed, which included delays in project implementation, an increase in capital costs, a \ndecrease  in  estimated  travel  demand,  and  decreases  in  key  economic  parameters.16 The \nresults of the sensitivity analyses show that the EIRR is most sensitive to an unlikely scenario of \nan  increase  in  capital  costs,  and  that  variations  in  key  project  parameters\u2014including  an \nincrease in capital costs, project delays, and changes in key economic inputs\u2014would still render \nthe project economically viable. The results therefore show the robustness of the EIRR with \nregard to reasonable changes in costs and benefits. Considering the overall contribution of the \nproject, which will promote sustainable and inclusive growth in the northern region and is \nexpected  to  deliver  significant  wider  unquantified  benefits  (especially  regarding  health, \neducation, services, and employment opportunities), the results of the economic analysis are \nconsidered as conservative, and the integrated benefits of the project are expected to outweigh \nthe capital costs. \n \n23.   The Secretariat of the Kulhudhuffushi Council is responsible for the cost of routine \nmaintenance and day-to-day operation of Kulhudhuffushi Harbor. The incremental recurrent \ncosts for harbor operation and routine maintenance are estimated to be around Rf267,000 per \nyear. The Secretariat of the Kulhudhuffushi Council has committed to fund these costs through \nannual budget allocation and any revenue that may be generated from commercial use of the \nharbor. On the other hand, large-scale harbor maintenance, primarily dredging, is performed by \nPublic Works Services under the MHI, and financed under the MHI\u2019s annual budget for recurrent \nexpenditure. Large-scale harbor maintenance is managed by the MHI and is given priority \nbased on need, as assessed by its technical staff. The dredging costs for the harbor expansion \nare expected to be around Rf2.7 million every 5 years, representing only 2.9% of the MHI\u2019s \nbudget. MHI historical financial information in 2014 and 2015 shows that funds released for \nlarge-scale maintenance and upkeep have exceeded the initial budget allocations. In addition, \n                                                \n14  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n15  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16  These are gross domestic product, value of time, travel cost, standard conversion factor, and shadow wage rate. \n ", "7 \nthe MHI is committed to adequately maintaining public harbors throughout the Maldives.17 \nBased on the analysis of the incremental recurrent cost and the government\u2019s financial ability \nand commitment to maintain all public harbors in the Maldives, it is likely that the operation and \nmaintenance of the expanded harbor will be sustained. While the proposed passenger and \ncargo harbor under the project will be operated free of port dues or cargo handling charges, the \nTA attached to this project will support the government in assessing the feasibility of, and \ndeveloping an action plan related to, introducing harbor user charging in Kulhudhuffushi in the \nfuture, which would help enhance sustainability of harbor operation. \n \nC.   Governance \n24.  Institutional. The MHI has sufficient capacity to implement the project. The MHI was the \ntechnical agency responsible for contract supervision and approval of progress payments for the \nADB-funded  Domestic  Maritime  Transport  Project,  under  which  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  was \nconstructed.18 The experience gained from the development of 10 harbors funded by the Islamic \nDevelopment Bank has further strengthened the MHI\u2019s capacity to implement the project.19 \nCapacity development TA to be provided to the Secretariat of the Kulhudhuffushi Council, and \nthe Public Works Services will help sustain and streamline harbor operation and maintenance. \n \n25.  Financial  management. The financial management assessment concludes that the \noverall financial management risk is moderate and suggests mitigation measures for key risks. It \nalso concludes that the MOFT and MHI have sufficient experience and capacity to manage the \nproject  funds  as  well  as  adequate  fund  flow,  accounting,  and  budgeting  arrangements. \nNotwithstanding this, the MHI requires to develop an internal audit function. In addition, the MHI \nalso  committed  to  (i)  ensure  adequate  counterpart  fund  allocation;  (ii)  with  ADB  support, \nconduct training in ADB\u2019s rules and regulations in disbursement, financial management, and \nprocurement; and (iii) appoint a dedicated accountant at the PMU. The proposed fund flow \narrangement  is  straightforward,  and  the  financial  management  arrangements  have  been \ndesigned based on the financial management assessment results; both are expected to be \nadequate. \n \n26.  Procurement. The Tender Evaluation Section (TES) of the MOFT, in coordination with \nMHI as the line ministry, will carry out the procurement and consultant recruitment activities. An \nassessment of the procurement capacity of the TES and MHI shows that both agencies have \nthe skilled and experienced staff, and well-established procedures and systems, required to \nmanage the procurement process. In the last 4 years, the TES and MHI have procured a total of \n37 civil works contracts for harbor projects funded by the government and external resources. In \naddition, the TES in the last 2 years has procured about 90 civil works contracts for projects \nfunded by the government, the Islamic Development Bank, or the World Bank. However, both \nagencies have limited experience in ADB procurement. During the project preparatory stage, \nTES and MHI staff received training on ADB procurement. During the project implementation \nstage,  the  MHI,  as  the  implementing  agency,  will  be  supported  by  the  PMC  during  the \npreparation of bidding documents and the procurement of civil works. \n \n                                                \n17  The actual expenditures for large-scale harbor maintenance by the MHI were around 38% higher than the budget   \nallocation in 2014 and 53% higher in 2015. \n18  ADB. 2007.

Manila (Loan 2327-MLD). \n19  Cofinanced by the Saudi Fund for Development and the OPEC Fund for International Development. \n ", "8 \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 10). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n28.  Poverty and social. The economy of the northern region is mainly based on fishing, \nagriculture, transport, and trading activities. The expanded harbor will allow those living in the \nouter islands to access services and amenities provided in Kulhudhuffushi such as housing, \nsecondary  education,  quality  health  facilities,  and  financial  services.  For  residents  of \nKulhudhuffushi,  the  project  will  generate  employment-supporting  construction  activities  and \nincrease  opportunities  in  the  commercial  sector.  The  project  will  bring  about  inclusive \nsocioeconomic benefits for the inhabitants of Kulhudhuffushi and the northern region as a whole \nthrough improving the island\u2019s connectivity to regional and national markets, and promoting \nlocal and visiting populations\u2019 access to key services. \n \n29.  Gender and development. Women residing in Kulhudhuffushi have direct access to \nhealth  and  education  facilities  and  are  active  in  the  civil  service  and  other  sectors.  The \nexpanded harbor will give women from the outer islands better access to higher education and \nspecialized health services, especially prenatal and postnatal support. The expanded harbor will \nalso create more opportunities for women entrepreneurs. During project preparation, findings \nfrom meaningful consultations with women guided the design of practical and implementable \ngender-inclusive features that include (i) integrating features friendly to the elderly, women, \nchildren, and the disabled in the designs of the harbor, including separate toilets and ablution \nand prayer facilities for male and female passengers, lighted waiting rooms, and disability-\nfriendly  access;  (ii)  mandating  that  two  of  the  five  members  of  the  grievance  redressal \ncommittee are women; and (iii) including a provision in the civil works contract to promote \ncompliance with all applicable labor laws, including not employing child labor for construction, \nencouraging increased employment of women and the local poor, and setting equal wages for \nmen and women for work of equal value. \n \n30.  Health  and  labor.  Based  on  findings  from  public  consultations  during  project \npreparation, there is a high level of HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infection awareness \namong all segments of the population in Kulhudhuffushi. This is due to the high number of \ntargeted HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns that have been conducted in Kulhudhuffushi by the \ngovernment.  Ongoing  awareness  campaigns  organized  by  the  government\u2019s  Women\u2019s \nDevelopment  Committee  together  with  a  national-level  nongovernment  organization  have \nincluded (i) forming an alliance, and educating and building the capacity of parent stakeholder \ngroups; (ii) training young people as peer educators for drugs and HIV prevention on the island; \nand (iii) conducting a widespread door-to-door outreach and information dissemination program. \nThe civil works contractor will conduct semiannual awareness-building sessions for all workers \nin a form and language(s) understandable to them. Awareness-raising materials will also be \ndisplayed in strategic areas of the expanded harbor. The civil works contractor will follow core \nlabor standards. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n31.  Environment. The project scope includes the construction of a harbor for passenger \nand cargo vessels on Kulhudhuffushi Island. There are no endangered species, unique habitats, \nor protected areas in the project site or surrounding area. The construction works will be \nconfined within the 12-hectare project harbor area and its immediate surroundings. Therefore, \n ", "9 \nthe project is classified as environment category B according to the ADB Safeguard Policy \nStatement  (2009).  An  initial  environmental  examination  report  including  an  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) has been prepared and disclosed on the ADB website. Anticipated \nirreversible impacts entail removal of about 0.6 hectares of corals and 2.0 hectares of sea grass \nfor  construction  of  the  harbor,  neither  of  which  is  a  critical  habitat;  neither  area  includes \nendangered or critically endangered species. Anticipated impacts during construction are (i) \nincreased noise levels, air pollution, waste, water pollution, and sedimentation of seawater; and \n(ii) occupational health and safety issues caused by dredging works and construction of the \nbreakwater and quay wall. These impacts are not significant, though, as they will be restricted to \nthe harbor construction site, with the nearest residential area approximately 240 meters away. \nThe only long-term impact expected during the harbor operations is water contamination due to \nthe solid and liquid waste generated from passenger and cargo boats. The EMP, which will form \npart of the civil works contract, includes measures to address all impacts during the construction \nstage. The EMP will be updated during the detailed design stage of the project if necessary. \nMeasures on waste management during harbor operations have been recommended in the \ninitial environmental examination. Meaningful consultations have been held with Kulhudhuffushi \nCouncil officials, residents of the island, and other key stakeholders such as the Environmental \nProtection Agency of the Maldives. Concerns of the local residents have been addressed in the \npreliminary design and will be further reviewed and updated during the detailed design stage. A \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  has  been  proposed  to  facilitate  receiving  and  resolving \ncomplaints during project construction. \n \n32.   The project director of the PMU  will be responsible for overseeing and monitoring \nimplementation of environment safeguards under the project. The environmental officers under \nthe Environment Unit of the MHI will support the project director to address environmental \nconcerns of the project as needed. The PMU will also be supported by the PMC, which will \ninclude  an  environment  specialist  who  will  conduct  monthly  site  inspections  and  prepare \nmonthly and semiannual environmental monitoring reports. The civil works contractor will be \nresponsible for implementing the EMP and will include a qualified environmental expert in their \nteam who will prepare monthly self-evaluation environmental reports. The PMC will conduct an \ninitial  training-cum-coordination  workshop  on  implementing  environment  safeguards  for  the \ncontractor during the pre-construction stage, followed by on-the-job training as needed during \nproject construction. \n \n33.  Involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as \ncategory C for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. Due diligence confirmed that the project will be implemented on \nreclaimed land that has been zoned for the harbor. The government owns the project site and \nthere are no titleholders or non-titleholders occupying the area. There are no structures being \naffected. Meaningful consultations were undertaken with relevant stakeholders during project \npreparation.  The  population  of  the  Maldives  is  ethnically  homogenous  with  no  recognized \nsubcategories.  The  social  development  specialist  of  the  PMC  will  perform  semiannual \nmonitoring  to  verify  that  there  are  no  impacts  during  implementation  and  that  information \ndisclosure and meaningful consultation are continued throughout the construction period. \n \n ", "10 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.
