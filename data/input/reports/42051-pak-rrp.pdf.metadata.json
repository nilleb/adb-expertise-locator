It will establish a dynamic business environment for clean energy \ntechnology  and  finance  priority  projects.  It  constitutes  tangible  actions \ntoward  a  sustainable  low-carbon  growth  path,  and  it  has  a  number  of \nimportant features:  \n \nMainstreaming Energy Efficiency. The Investment Program underpins a \nreform  strategy  that  will  mainstream  energy  efficiency  into  national \nplanning and public investments, and is a critical component of Pakistan's \nclimate change program. The Government of Pakistan (the Government) is \nadopting a holistic platform for strategic planning of the energy sector and \nclimate  change.  The  Investment  Program  builds  on  ongoing  work  of  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to establish integrated energy planning. It \nbacks  change  management  and  strengthens \nthe  capacity  of  key \nin  policy  planning,  gender  mainstreaming, \nparticipants,  particularly \ninvestment, and monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nClean  Energy  Market  Transformation.  The  Investment  Program  will \nbreak down the financial barriers to clean energy investments, and finance \ndeployment of clean technology that has been successfully demonstrated. \nIt  will  strengthen  regulatory  and  institutional  frameworks,  establish  fiscal \nand financial incentives, and enforce standards and testing. \n \nPrivate Sector Engagement. The private sector will play a key role in the \ndeployment of clean technology and energy services. It will also be a direct \nbeneficiary  (on  the  supply  and  demand  sides).  Sustainable  business \nmodels  for  energy  efficiency  services  (i.e.,  energy  audits,  performance \ncontracts) will be established and replicated. The Investment Program will \nincrease industrial productivity and competitiveness by lowering operating \ncosts.   \n \nPartnerships. The Investment Program sets out a framework for effective \npartnership with third parties\u2014investors and financiers\u2014over the medium \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\nterm.  In  addition  to  ADB,  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  is \nthe  first  of  these  partners.  Over  time,  other  development  partners  may \ndetermine to complement ADB's financing after the Board's approval of the \nproposed  MFF  through  cofinancing  to  be  administered  by  ADB.  The \nInvestment  Program  design  is  directly  linked  with  the  ongoing  work  by \nother  partners.  German  development  cooperation  through  GTZ  has  been \nimplementing \nlabeling  and \nindustrial  energy  audits  and  appliance \ncertification  projects  in  support  of  the  Investment  Program.  The  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  is  now  developing  a  climate  change \npolicy  program.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development \n(USAID)  is  implementing  a  capacity  development  program  to  strengthen \nenergy  demand-side  management  among \nthe  utilities  and  private \ncompanies, and is focusing on women's roles in energy. The World Bank \nis  implementing  utility-based  demand-side  management  demonstration \nprojects. The Government is discussing scaling up of such investment and \ntechnical assistance activities with GTZ, USAID, and the World Bank. \n \nThe energy gap is now one of Pakistan\u2019s most serious binding constraints \nto growth and jobs. It results from the rapid increase in demand and high \nwastage of energy, and is one of the main causes of the current economic \ncrisis.  Pakistan\u2019s  dependency  on  oil  imports  results  from  the  suboptimal \nenergy supply mix that is a consequence of poor planning. The economy is \nsusceptible to fuel price volatility. \n \nPakistan  uses  15%  more  energy  than  India  and  25%  more  than  the \nPhilippines (for each dollar of gross domestic product). Energy wastage is \na  high  cost  to  the  economy,  businesses,  and  consumers;  its  reduction \nrequires  major  and \ninvestment,  and \nconsumption patterns.  \n \nIn 2009, the power deficit reached 5,000 megawatts (MW), and natural gas \nsupply  to  industries  was  cut  during  the  4  winter  months.  People  and \nbusinesses in many parts of Pakistan are experiencing power outages and \nrationing  lasting  more  than  12  hours  a  day.  Factory  closures  are  causing \nsocial unrest.  \n \nEnergy  efficiency  represents  the  least-cost  and  quickest  low-carbon \nsolution  to  bridge  the  energy  gap.  It  cuts  the  high  dependence  on  oil \nimports  and  avoids  investment  in  expensive  and  inefficient  rental  power \ngeneration based on fossil fuels. It ultimately strengthens energy security, \ncontributes  to  the  environment,  creates  jobs,  and  improves  industrial \ncompetitiveness.  Energy  efficiency  is  now  a  strategic  priority  for  the \nGovernment. \n \nPakistan\u2019s  total  energy  savings  potential,  through  the  application  of  clean \nand efficient technology, is estimated at 11.16 million tons of oil equivalent \n(493,304  terajoules  [TJ]),  or  18%  of  primary  energy  use  (FY2008).  This \ncorresponds to a 51% reduction in net oil imports. In FY2008, the oil import \nbill  was  $12 billion.  Savings  in  electricity  and  gas  resulting  from  well \nthought  out  energy  efficiency  investments  correspond  to  additional \ngeneration capacity of about 6,770 MW. \n\nimmediate  shifts \n\nin  policies, \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nroad  map \n\nEnergy  efficiency  investments  can  be  most  effective  when  the  policy, \nregulatory, and pricing regime is right. Energy tariffs have historically been \nlow in Pakistan. As such, customers have not had much of an incentive to \ninvest  in  efficient  technology,  nor  shift  consumption  patterns.  While \nelectricity production costs tripled from FY2003 to FY2007, tariffs were not \nadjusted  to  cover  this  increase.  Since  FY2007,  tariffs  increased  by  an \naverage of 20% and will continue doing so until reaching cost-recovery by \nFY2011.  As  tariffs  increase,  so  does  awareness  of  energy  efficiency  and \nincentives to acquire new, less energy-consuming technology. \n \nThe Government asked the Asian  Development Bank for  a flexible public \nsector  financing  mechanism  to  support  energy  efficiency  in  the  short  to \nmedium  term.  A  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  is  considered  the \nmost  appropriate  modality  for  energy  efficiency  investments  in  Pakistan. \nThe Government has fully met the preconditions for use of an MFF. \n \nRoad  Map.  The  Government  has  adopted  a  clear  and  sound  strategic \nmultisector \nfor  energy  efficiency  based  on  extensive \nconsultations  and  inputs  from  all  stakeholders.  An  MFF  will  provide  a \nmechanism  to  overcome  financial  barriers  to  realizing  the  road  map \ntargets.  \n \nStrategic  Context.  Energy  security  is  the  primary  goal  under  Pakistan\u2019s \nenergy  strategy.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Pakistan  has \nenergy efficiency as a core intervention area. The Investment Program is a \ncontinuation  of  a  10-year  policy  dialogue.  The  projected  investments  are \nconsistent  and  closely  linked  to  ongoing  ADB  interventions\u2014renewable \nenergy,  power  generation  (mostly  private  sector  in  nature),  transmission, \nand distribution. These operations also fit with the latest negotiations with \nthe  Government  on  policy  reforms  for  sustainable  and  financially  viable \npower sector.  \n \nPolicy  Framework.  The  Government  has  a  policy  framework  for  energy \nefficiency  that  focuses  on  maximizing  energy  savings  by  rational  and \nefficient  use  in  all  energy-consuming  sectors.  An  integrated  institutional \nand  resource  allocation  structure  is  required  for  its  implementation.  The \nInvestment Program projects will provide advisory and financial support to \nkey  stakeholders \nintegrated  sector  planning  and \nmanagement. \n \nincludes  a  comprehensive \nSafeguards.  The \nenvironmental \nappropriate \nenvironmental  due  diligence  and  plans  will  be  prepared  for  each  project. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  not  involve  any  involuntary  resettlement  or \nany issues regarding indigenous peoples. \n \nUndertakings.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  a  set  of  commitments \naimed  to  (i)  establish  a  dynamic  business  environment  for  the  sustained \nthe  energy  efficiency  market,  and  (ii) scale  up \ntransformation  of \ndeployment  of  proven  technologies  through  public  investments  and \nfostering private investment. The MFF allows consistent engagement with \n\nInvestment  Program \n\nin  strengthening \n\nassessment \n\nframework, \n\nreview \n\nand \n\n \nMultitranche \nFinancing Facility \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nFramework \nFinancing \nAgreement  \n\n \n\nthe  Government  in  monitoring  the  progress  of  the  commitments,  and \nwhere needed, provides advisory support to achieve the targets. \n \nInvestment  and  Financing  Plan.  There  is  a  comprehensive  10-year \ninvestment  program  ($3.8  billion)  comprising  a  variety  of  sequenced \nsupply-  and  demand-side  investments  in  priority  sectors  and  institutional \ndevelopment (i.e., capacity building, governance, gender, safeguards, and \nproject  preparation  and  implementation).  An  indicative  financing  plan  is \ndefined.  The  MFF  will  finance  a  slice  of  this  investment  program  by \nfinancing  short-  to  medium-term  priority  energy  efficiency  projects  and \nsupporting institutional effectiveness, program management, and capacity \ndevelopment.  AFD  is  cofinancing  the  Investment  Program.  Third-party \ncofinancing will be structured for future MFF tranches.  \n\n \n\n \nEnergy Efficiency Investment Requirement, 2009\u20132018 \n($ million) \n\nAmount\nFocus Area \n370 \nDomestic \n1,908 \nIndustrial and Commercial \n1,372 \nPower Generation \n130 \nTransmission and Distribution \n \n3,780 \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Planning Commission estimates. \n\nTotal  \n\nIndicative Financing Plan, 2009\u20132018 \n($ million) \n\nSource \nGovernment of Pakistan \nOfficial External \n  Asian Development Bank \n  Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppementa\n  United States Agency for International Developmentb \n  Others \nCommercial Domestic \nCommercial External \nTotal \na \u20ac150 million equivalent. \nb Additional financing is being planned. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Planning Commission estimates. \n\nAmount \n600 \n \n780 \n200 \n30 \n320 \n900 \n950 \n3,780 \n\n \n \nThe Investment Program will bring about energy savings and support low-\ncarbon growth by cutting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30%.

This  financing  will  be \nchanneled through an MFF. The Government signed an FFA with ADB for \nup to $780 million equivalent and a similar agreement will be signed with \nAFD  for  up  to  \u20ac150  million  equivalent.  Funding  will  be  requested  through \nperiodic financing requests (PFRs) and extended through individual loans \nand/or guarantees.  \n \nADB  will  provide  up  to  $760,000,000  equivalent  from  its  ordinary  capital \nresources  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility.  At  the  request  of  the  Government  and  if  ADB  considers \nappropriate,  the  aforesaid  amount  may  be  converted  into  guarantees, \ncofinancing  administered  by  ADB,  and  other  instruments  in  accordance \nwith  ADB's  then  prevailing  polices,  rules  and  procedures.  ADB  will  also \nprovide $20,000,000 equivalent from its Special Funds resources. \n \nAFD  will  provide  up  to \u20ac150,000,000  on  a  joint cofinancing basis  through \nloans  to  the  Government.  ADB  and  AFD  will  enter  into  a  cofinancing \nagreement for each PFR. AFD cofinancing under the Investment Program \nwill  be  handled  by  ADB  on  a  partial-administration  basis.  Cofinancing \narrangements  may  also  be  agreed  with  other  development  partners  after \nthe  Board's  approval  of  the  proposed  MFF  for  future  tranches  under  the \nInvestment  Program. The amounts of cofinancing to be provided by such \nother  development  partners  and  administered  by  ADB  will  be  deducted \nfrom  the  total  MFF  amount  proposed.

ADB  will \nprovide required technical support for project entities to prepare the CDM \nproposal,  and  ADB's  Asia  Pacific  Carbon  Fund  and  Future  Carbon  Fund \ncould  provide  financing  and  purchase  the  certified  emission  reductions \nfrom the projects. \n \nThe  MFF  will  be  provided  in  tranches  to  finance  projects  and  investment \nprogram management.  \n \nThe  first  PFR  will  be  financed  from  tranche  1  of  the  MFF.  It  includes \nfinancing  for  the  National  Compact  Fluorescent  Lamp  (CFL)  Project \n($85  million)  and  the  Investment  Program  Management  Support  Project \n($25  million),  which  is  essential  to  improve  institutional  effectiveness, \ncapacity,  governance,  gender  mainstreaming,  and  project  management \nactivities). This PFR has requested $60 million equivalent loans from ADB \nand a \u20ac20 million loan from AFD. The Government will provide $25 million \nequivalent. \n \nThe  Government \nis \nexpected  to  adopt  an  onlending  policy  specific  to  energy  efficiency \ninvestments  made  under  the  MFF.  The  policy  aims  to  leverage  MFF \nfinancing  and  encourage  commercial  borrowing  for  clean  technology \nfinancing.  ADB  and  the  Government  will  determine  the  specific  terms  for \neach PFR.  \n \nThe Government will use the ADB and AFD loan proceeds to finance the \nCFL  project  and  repay  through  the  budget.  This  is  standard  practice  for \nsimilar projects in developing member countries. \n \nUntil 16 September 2019  \n\nits  Economic  Coordination  Committee \n\nthrough \n\n \nThe Planning Commission of Pakistan will be the Executing Agency for the \nInvestment  Program.  A  dedicated  project  management  office  (PMO)  will \nbe  established  to  help  with  the  work  and  implement  the  Investment \nProgram  Management  Support  Project  (under  tranche  1).  The  Planning \nCommission will submit PFRs to ADB and AFD.  \n \nInvestment projects under the tranches will be prepared and managed by \ndifferent  entities  and/or  utilities,  whenever  appropriate  with  help  from \nadvisors engaged under the PMO. ADB will conduct its own independent \ndue diligence on all proposed projects to be financed under the Investment \nProgram to ensure they comply with the terms and conditions of the FFA. \n \nThe Ministry of Water and Power will be the Executing Agency for the CFL \nproject  (under  tranche  1).  Power  distribution  utilities  will  implement  this \n\n\f \n\nvii\n\nprogram in their respective geographic areas. The Government will cause \nthe  utilities  to  finance  the  CFL  distribution  costs  from  its  internally \ngenerated resources.  \n \nThe  Government  requested  ADB's  approval  for  advance  actions  on \nprocurement  and  consulting  services,  and  retroactive  financing  of  up  to \n20% of the loan amount under each tranche. \n\n \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  implemented  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nA procurement plan will be a prerequisite for each tranche. As appropriate, \nthe turnkey contracts will be utilized and incorporated into the procurement \nplans.  National  competitive  bidding  and  other  methods  may  be  used  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines. \n \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime). \n \nAll energy consumers in Pakistan will directly benefit from the Investment \nProgram.  Large  economic,  social,  and  environmental  benefits  are \nexpected  as  a  result  of  energy  savings  from  the  application  of  clean  and \nadvanced technology and practice. For example:  \n \n(i) \n\n601,671  tons  of  oil  equivalent  /25,191  TJ  (valued  at  $200  million) \nenergy will be saved annually from reducing transformation losses in \nthe power generation and gas transmission;  \n\n(ii)  918,942  tons  of  oil  equivalent  /38,474  TJ  (valued  at  $330  million) \nenergy will be saved annually from reducing gas, oil, and coal use in \nthe domestic and industry sectors; and  \n\n(iii)  GHG  emissions  will  be  cut  by  about  1  million  tons  carbon  dioxide \nequivalent annually from less fossil fuel use through clean technology \nand practice applications.  \n\n \nEnergy  efficiency  thus  will  reduce  public  sector  expenditures  on  energy \nand  improve  livelihoods  in  rural  and  urban  communities.  Implementation \nprogress  and  achievements  will  be  monitored  against  the  performance \ntargets  and  indicators  included  in  the  Investment  Program's  design  and \nmonitoring framework. \n \nFinancial  outlays  on  power  generation  projects  will  be  cut  and \nuneconomical  standby  capacity  required  to  cater  for  peak  loads  will  be \nminimized.  The  need  for  energy  subsidies  will  be  reduced.  Transmission \nand distribution system  expansion needs will be deferred, thereby saving \npublic  funds  and  increasing  returns  on  all  energy  investments.  Energy \nefficiency  adds  more  supply  capacity.  The  potential  is  real  since \ninvestments are in technologies that are known, proven, bankable, and low \nrisk in nature.  \n \n \n\n \nAdvance \nContracting and \nRetroactive \nFinancing \n \nProcurement and \nConsulting \nServices \n\n \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n\fviii \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nSecure  and  reliable  energy  supply  will  improve  energy  access.  Through \ncost savings, energy efficiency will generate more income for women and \nhouseholds.  Industrial  competitiveness  will  be  increased  and  more  jobs \nwill be created. It will also facilitate a viable energy audit and management \nindustry,  and  eventual  market  transformation  in  favor  of  clean  energy \nproducts and services. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  support  gender  mainstreaming  into  energy \npolicies.  The  road  map  provides  specific  measures  to  allow  the  needs  of \nboth men and women to be considered in all planning and policymaking. A \ngender sensitive energy policy would recognize that women and men have \ndifferent energy needs due to their differing household roles, responses to \ncrises, and coping mechanisms; and would offer energy technologies and \nservices that match those needs.  \n \nEnergy  efficiency  directly  leads  to  a  cleaner  environment  as  a  result  of \nreduced  GHG  emissions.  Substantial  regional  and  global  benefits  are \nexpected. Specific project sponsors will also benefit from carbon revenues \ngenerated  under  the  Investment  Program.  The  National  CFL  Project \n(under tranche 1) will reduce emissions by 7 million tons of carbon dioxide. \n \nThe  direct  economic  benefits  of  the  CFL  project  include  reduced  peak \ndemand  by  use  of  energy-efficient  lighting  devices.  This  will  result  in \nsavings  of  about  $177  million  (2,132  GWh)  per  annum  from  avoided  fuel \ncost and deferral of an investment of $1.84 billion in power generation and \nassociated network capacity of 1.6 GWh, which is about 9% of Pakistan's \navailable  generation  capacity.  Poor  customers  (particularly  women  and \nchildren)  will  particularly  benefit,  as  lighting  is  a  significant  component  of \ntheir electricity consumption. As much as $800 million could be saved by \nparticipating  households  over  the  project  life.  These  households  will  also \nbenefit from improved quality lighting. \n \nA  risk  assessment  was  conducted.  The  Investment  Program  risks  are \n(i)  political,  (ii) institutional,  and  (iii)  management.  Technical  risks  for \nenergy efficiency projects are assessed as relatively low. Energy efficiency \nprograms  can  be  successful  only  if  the  underlying  incentives  of  the \nthis,  political \nregulatory \ncommitment and a policy framework are critical. \n \nLack of tariff increases and the resulting shortage of funds for investment, \nmaintenance,  and  augmentation  have  compromised  the  financial  viability \nof  the  power  sector.  The  Government  is  taking  steps  through  the  power \nsector circular debt resolution plan to establish financial sustainability. The \nplan  principles  are  (i)  policy  debt  resolution,  (ii)  technical  and  financial \nimprovement of company performance, and (iii) timely implementation of a \ncost recovery tariff. The implementation of the plan will align the incentives \nfor conservation and energy efficiency. Considerable political commitment \nwill be needed to carry out the reforms.

This  slowdown  was  partially  caused  by  increased \ninternational  fuel  and  food  prices,  and  aggravated  by  the  domestic  political  transition.  The \nenergy  shortage  crisis,  which  started  in  FY2007,  worsened  during  FY2008\u2013FY2009,  further \nstraining  the  national  budget  and  growth.  The  power  supply  deficit  reached  5,000  megawatts \n(MW) during the summer peak in FY2009. Extended power outages, lasting more than 12 hours \na day in many areas, and gas shortages during the 4 winter months have had a negative effect \non people and businesses.  \n \n3. \nThe economy grew at an annual average of 7% during FY2004\u2013FY2008; this translated \ninto a rapid increase in energy demand of about 8.4% per year. However, the primary energy \nsupply  increased  at  only  6%  per  year  during  this  time.  In  FY2008,  the  primary  energy  supply \nwas  63  million  tons  of  oil  equivalent  (Mtoe),  and  comprised  natural  gas  (47.5%),  oil  (30.5%), \nhydropower  (10.9%),  coal  (9.2%),  liquefied  petroleum  gas  (0.7%),  and  nuclear  power  (1.2%). \nPakistan is a net energy importer; the oil import bill was $12 billion in FY2008. Based on low-\ncase gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecasts of 4%, the total annual energy demand is \nexpected to double to 122 Mtoe in 10 years. At a conservative crude oil price of $50/barrel, the \nannual energy import bill would exceed $27 billion by FY2018. \n \n4. \nThe  energy  gap  is  a  binding  constraint,  as  energy  security  underpins  all  aspects  of \neconomic growth. The energy sector is now gripped with the reality of energy vulnerability, fuel \nprice volatility, the financial crisis, and system unreliability. Forecasts of global energy demand \nsuggest  that  prices  will  remain  high  and  volatile  well  into  the  future.  Pakistan  relies  on \nreasonably  priced  energy  as  a  precondition  for  sustained  economic  development.  These \ncontinuing energy insecurities have immediate consequences for poverty and economic growth. \n \n5. \nEnergy  efficiency  options  are  an  underlying  theme  in  addressing  energy  security \nproblems  and  mitigating  the  impact  of  climate  change.  The  rationale  for  investing  in  energy \nefficiency\u2014from economic, social, environmental perspectives\u2014has become even more critical \nfor  Pakistan.  Managing  growing  energy  demand  through  the  application  of  energy  efficiency \ntechnologies and services is the most cost-effective way to achieve energy security and sustain \nlow-carbon growth. \n  \n6. \nPakistan will have multiple benefits from investing in clean energy and energy efficiency. \nThe impacts can be shared globally. Addressing climate change by improving energy efficiency1 \n                                                 \n1  Energy  efficiency  is  defined  as  economic  investments  in  energy  generation;  delivery;  and  end-use  equipment, \nfacilities,  buildings,  and  infrastructure  that  deliver  higher  useful  energy  outputs  or  services.  Energy  efficiency \nresults in (i) lower consumption of energy,  measured as energy input per unit of delivered output or service; and \n(ii) reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. ADB. 2006.

Key  drivers  are  energy  security,  energy  efficiency,  and  clean  energy.  ADB  is \ncontinuing  to  support  energy  sector  investments  in  the  power  supply  chain  (generation, \ntransmission, and distribution), reforms (including strengthening corporate governance in power \nentities  and  granting  them  greater  financial  autonomy),  and  capacity  development  of  key \nagencies (including improving financial management and procurement practices, addressing the \nproblems of circular debt and the debt overhang, and rationalizing tariff structures).  \n \nThe  Government  is  keen  to  invest  in  clean  technology  and  to  encourage  market \n8. \ntransformation to improve efficiency for energy supply and demand. The Government requested \nADB  support  for  the  development  of  an  investment  program  in  this  field. 5 This  intervention \nresults  from  a  10-year  policy  dialogue  with  Pakistan,  and  is  fully  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy \n2020, Energy Policy, and Energy Efficiency Initiative. \n \n9. \nThe  Investment  Program  provides  the  foundation  for  sustainable  financing  for  priority \nprojects.  The  demonstration  effect  of  these  projects  will  encourage  private  sector  investments \ninto  energy  efficiency  and  thus  help  engage  the  private  sector.  A  sound  road  map,  detailed \npolicy  frameworks,  and  clear  energy-specific  investment  plans  are  in  place;  and  each  project \nentity has sufficient implementation capacity to handle energy efficiency transactions. \n \nPolicy  Framework.  Pakistan\u2019s  development  priorities  are  given  in  the  Vision  2030 \n10. \ndocument.6  It stresses structural change and greater productivity.  The medium-term development \nframework  for  2005\u20132010  shows  priority  investments  in  key  sectors.  The  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategy (2003)7 highlights the need for macroeconomic restructuring, removal of infrastructure \nbottlenecks,  and  private  sector  participation.  The  Government  intends  to  align  these  three \nstrategic  documents  over  the  short  term,  while  calling  for  improved  project  implementation, \nsounder  public  financial  resources  management,  stakeholder  consultations,  and  delivery  of \nresults.  \n \n11. \nThe energy efficiency policy framework is set in the National Energy Conservation Policy \nadopted  in  2006.  It  calls  for  maximized  savings  through  rational  use  and  application  of  clean \nenergy technology. An integrated institutional structure and resource allocation is prescribed to \nsupplement  implementation.  Policy  implementation  has  been  slow  due  to  lack  of  coordination \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB.  2008.

Energy  security  and  affordability  are  priorities  under  the  Government's \nenergy  sector  strategy  and  policies.  Energy  efficiency  is  a  key  part  of  this  strategy,  and  is \nbacked by a road map (Appendix 2). This sets out a strategy for clean energy and low-carbon \ngrowth, and an action plan covering investments and institutional change. Specifically, it aims to \n(i) integrate energy policy and the regulatory frameworks; (ii) mainstream energy efficiency into \nnational  planning;  (iii)  rationalize  energy  pricing;  (iv)  create  fiscal  and  financial  incentives;  (v) \nestablish  technology  standards,  certification,  and  testing  regimes;  and  (vi)  improve  the \ninformation  flow  on  energy  efficiency,  financing,  technology,  and  support  services.  The  road \nmap was prepared through a consultative approach by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation \nConsultative  Group  (EECCG).8 The  Planning  Commission  chairs  the  EECCG,  which  includes \npublic and private sector stakeholders as well as development partners as its members.  \n\n \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n\n13. \nThe energy gap results from (i) weak sector planning and management, (ii) poor sector \nperformance, (iii) increasing demand, and (iv) inefficient use of energy resources. The problem \nanalysis  is  shown  in  Appendix  3.  Lack  of  investment  in  replacing  obsolete  technology  and \ninfrastructure is a cause for inefficiencies. High energy losses and wastage throughout the value \nchain result in high energy intensity. Pakistan uses 15% more energy than India and 25% more \nthan the Philippines for each dollar of GDP produced. Industrial production is impacted by high \nenergy prices and low and unreliable supply. Production costs are high, making businesses less \ncompetitive. \n \n14. \nThe Government is struggling to resolve the energy shortage crisis. Ad hoc measures, \nsuch  as  rental  power  generation  programs,  are  having  a  limited  impact.  Meanwhile,  public \ndissatisfaction  is  increasing  due  to  persistent  power  shortages  and  high  energy  prices.  The \ndemand and supply gap can be bridged by (i) increasing supply through new capacity additions \nand  improved  sector  performance,  and  (ii)  increasing  supply  and  curbing  demand  through \nenergy efficiency and demand-side management. The energy gap will continue to remain until \nboth measures are effectively implemented.  \n \n15. \nIncreasing  supply  capacity  takes  time  and  is  expensive.  Commission  of  major  power \ngeneration and natural gas supply additions will begin in 2013. Pakistan is attempting to change \nits energy mix by exploring its hydropower and coal resources; however, these projects will take \ntime. Reliance on thermal generation with imported fuel oil is expected to increase in the short \nterm.  Energy  efficiency  thus  is  the  least-cost  and  most  climate-friendly  way  of  bridging  the \nenergy  gap  and  securing  energy  provision.  Domestic  energy  prices  will  continue  to  increase \nwith tariff rationalization and removal of subsidies. Energy efficiency reduces the energy bill for \nall energy customers.  \n \n\n                                                 \n8  EECCG  membership  includes  representatives  of  the  Economic  Affairs  Division;  ministries  of  finance,  water  and \npower,  petroleum  and  natural  resources,  environment,  and  industries  and  production;  National  Energy \nConservation  Centre;  Pakistan  Electric  Power  Company;  Pakistan  Standards  and  Quality  Control  Authority; \nHydrocarbon  Development  Institute;  Pakistan  Council  for  Industrial  and  Scientific  Research;  and  development \npartners  (ADB,  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement,  German  development  cooperation  through  GTZ,  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency,  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  United  Nations \nIndustrial \nDevelopment Organization, United States Agency for International Development, and the World Bank). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nRising  energy  prices  are  a  large  burden  on  the  Government  budget  and  customers\u2019 \n16. \nenergy bills. High international fuel prices and volatility are undermining energy security. Since \nFY1998, prices of energy products have continually increased. For example, the price of natural \ngas  increased  by  274%  for  residential  customers  from  FY1998  to  FY2008,  and  125%  from \nFY2005 to FY2008. For commercial and industrial customers, it increased by 250% and 126%, \nover the same two periods. Fuel oil prices increased by 566% from FY1998 to FY2008 and by \n230%  from  FY2005  to  FY2008.  Power  generation  costs  have  increased,  as  oil-based  thermal \npower  plants  account  for  68%  of  generating  capacity.  Electricity  tariffs  are  expected  to  be \nincreased  in  increments  starting  in  October  2009  to  reach  cost  recovery,  and  Government \nsubsidies are to be eliminated by FY2011. The Government budgeted PRs55 billion for a tariff \ndifferential  subsidy  to  cover  the  incremental  increase.  Monthly  tariff  adjustments  for  fuel  costs \nare designed to keep the subsidy within the budget as the increases are made according to the \nimplementation plan.9   \n \n17. \nThe private sector plays a key role in sustaining growth momentum and in creating the \njobs  needed  to  absorb  the  rapidly  growing  labor  force.  Energy  shortages  are  the  most  severe \nobstacle  to  doing  business  in  Pakistan.  For  example,  captive  power  generation  is  expensive \n($0.20\u2013$0.30  per  kilowatt-hour)  and  drives  up  production  costs.  The  country  partnership \nstrategy  (footnote  4)  defines  energy  infrastructure  bottlenecks  and  shallow  financial  services \nindustry  as  key  constraints  that  increase  the  cost  of  doing  business  in  the  country.  The \nunreliable infrastructure, coupled with rising cost of energy products, affects companies\u2019 bottom \nlines  and  increases  production  costs.  Industries  are  not  investing  in  energy  efficiency  as  it \ndirectly  competes  with  production.10 No  available  financing  is  dedicated  for  energy  efficiency. \nBanks do not have capacity to undertake due diligence on such projects.  \n \nADB\u2019s assessment11 of energy efficiency in Pakistan found that the Government needs \n18. \nto integrate energy efficiency into the overall energy strategy and mainstream energy efficiency \ninto development planning and investment (Supplementary Appendix A). Lack of financing is a \nkey  barrier  to  energy  efficiency.  The  Government  needs  a  flexible  public  sector  financing \nmechanism to deliver priority projects that will result in energy savings, lower energy intensity, \nreduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and increased industrial competitiveness. \n \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Challenges \n\na. \n\nSupply Side  \n\nThe total installed power generation capacity in Pakistan is 19,420 MW.12 However, only \n19. \n14,000  MW  of  firm  capacity  was  available  in  2009  because  of  technical  and  financial \nconstraints.  The  shortfall  in  electricity  supply  has  resulted  in  power  rationing  during  peak \ndemand  since  FY2007.  The  rationing  will  continue  until  capacity  additions  catch  up  with  peak \ndemand.  About  two  thirds  of  total  electricity  is  generated  from  thermal  power  plants  using \nnatural  gas  and  fuel  oil.  The  lack  of  natural  gas  supply  to  the  energy  sector  has  increased \nreliance  on  imported  fuel  oil,  which  has  increased  the  cost  of  power  as  well  as  decreased \n\n                                                 \n9  The  actual  cost  increase  necessary  to  reach  cost  recovery  will  be  determined  by  the  National  Electric  Power \nRegulatory Authority. The current estimate is a total cost increase of 25.8% with three increases during FY2010.  \n10 A survey of 650 small- and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises concludes that almost 80% did not intend to \n\nmake new investments from 2009 to 2013, mainly because of expensive and unreliable energy supply. \n\n11 ADB.  2007.  Implementing  Energy  Efficiency  in  Pakistan.  Manila.  The  report  was  prepared  under  ADB.  2006. \nTechnical  Assistance  for  Supporting  the  Inception  of  the  Energy  Efficiency  Initiative  in  Developing  Member \nCountries. Manila.  \n\n12 About 2,000 MW of additional capacity will be required annually to keep up with economic growth projections in the \n\nmedium-term development framework. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\noutput.  Public  sector  thermal  power  plants  are  dilapidated,  operating  at  25%  reduced  output, \nand at much lower efficiency rates than similar plants elsewhere. This is a result of inadequate \nmaintenance.  Forced  outage  rates  for  these  plants  are  at  12%,  or  double  that  of  independent \npower producers.  \n \n20. \nIn  FY2008,  production  of  natural  gas  peaked  at  113  million  standard  cubic  meters  per \nday  (MMSCMD),  compared  to  a  demand  of  127  MMSCMD.  Since  FY2007,  the  country  has \nfaced  gas  shortages  during  the  winter  months,  when  supplies  to  industry  and  thermal  power \ngeneration had to be cut to meet the heating needs of households.13  \n \n21. \nThe energy system also experiences high transformation losses. Despite improvements \nin  recent  years,  systemwide  transmission  and  distribution  losses  remain  high  at  23.4%  of \ndispatched power, and close to 8% in the case of gas supply. The Government is investing in \npower  transmission,  distribution  rehabilitation,  and  expansion.  These  investments  will  improve \nefficiency and reduce losses. The gas transmission and distribution system is also aging. High \ntechnical losses occur because of inefficient compressors. Due to the shortage of financing, gas \nutilities  are  delaying  investment  into  replacing  these  compressor  units,  which  could  double \ncompressor  efficiency,  save  3,500  billion  British  thermal  units  of  gas  per  year,  and  enable \n450 GWh of additional generation annually (120 MW of capacity).  \n \nClean  technology  investment  in  thermal  power  generation,  and  gas  transmission  and \n22. \ndistribution will deliver the highest energy savings. Savings in power generation14 are estimated \nat 1.2 Mtoe (55,070 TJ) in FY2019 (Table 1). These savings constitute 28% of total realizable \ndemand- and supply-side savings in FY2019 for the priority sectors, requiring an investment of  \n$1.37 billion. Savings from loss reduction in gas transmission networks are $130 million (3%). \nTotal requirements on the supply side amount to $1.5 billion.  \n \n\nb. \n\nDemand Side    \n\n23. \nDuring FY2002\u2013FY2007, electricity consumption rose by 6.8% per year, natural gas by \n10.4%, liquefied petroleum gas by 17.6%, and coal by 22.8%. Only oil consumption leveled off \ntemporarily due to large-scale fuel switching in the power and cement industries\u2014displaced by \nnatural  gas  and  coal\u2014and  transport  system  alignment,  due  to  increasing  use  of  compressed \nnatural  gas  in  vehicles.  Still,  oil  imports  in  FY2008  rose  by  5.6%,  but  the  cost  increased  by \n60.4% because of worldwide price increases. \n  \nPeak demand for electricity increased by 34% from FY2004 to FY2009. This was driven \n24. \nby the rapid increase in household appliance use, the result of rising incomes and a burgeoning \nconsumer financing market. This led to a shortfall of 4,000\u20135,000 MW, corresponding to 25%\u2013\n30% of peak demand. Only about 55% of the population have access to grid-supplied electricity. \n \n25. \nHouseholds in Pakistan accounted for about half of total electricity consumption in 2008. \nLighting,  along  with  air  conditioning  in  the  summer,  is  the  main  driver  of  peak  loads  in  this \nsector.  Inefficient  household  and  commercial  appliances  are  causing  a  huge  burden  on \navailable energy supply.  \n \n26. \nThe industry sector is energy-intensive. It accounted for 19% of GDP in FY2008, but was \nthe  biggest  energy  user  with  43%  of  total  energy  consumption.  This  is  primarily  due  to \n\n                                                 \n13  Power  plants  currently  report  a  shortage  of  10  MMSCMD  of  natural  gas.  Every  2.8  MMSCMD  of  natural  gas \n\nsupplied to the power subsector saves approximately PRs1.4 billion in power generation cost.  \n\n14  Thermal plants selected based on lower efficiency and lower payback criteria. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\ndilapidated  infrastructure  and  inefficient  technology  in  use.  Low  energy  productivity  is  a  factor \naffecting industrial competitiveness, and the cost of doing business. \n \n\n27. \nDemand-side  savings  in  FY2008  are  estimated  at  3 Mtoe  (134,411  TJ),  which \ncorresponds  to  8%  of  the  total  energy  consumed  in  the  country  (Table  1).  Realizable  energy \nsavings in the industry sector correspond to 8% of current sector consumption; in the domestic \nsector  it  is  21%.  Energy  savings  between  FY2010  and  FY2019  are  estimated  at  3.13 Mtoe \n(138,206 TJ). Investment costs are estimated at $2.3 billion. The highest energy savings will be \nin the domestic (lighting and appliances) and industry (technology retrofits) sectors. The bulk of \nthe  investment  will  be  required  in  2009\u20132013  to  replace  inefficient  equipment,  followed  by \nadditional  investments  to  maintain  efficiency  in  sectors  where,  due  to  market  imperatives,  the \ninduction of lower efficiency equipment is expected to continue into the near future. \n\nTable 1: Summary of Savings and Investment Requirements \n\nEnergy Consumed, FY2008  Energy Savings, FY2019 \n\n(\u2019000 toe) \n \n\nPriority Sector \nDemand Side \n  Domestic  \n  Industry \n  Subtotal \nSupply Side \n  Power Generation \n  Transmission and Distribution (gas)  \n  Subtotal  \n\n8,046 \n16,804 \n\n \n\n(TJ) \n\n(\u2019000 toe) \n\n \n\n355,659 \n742,776 \n\n \n\n \n\n1,685 \n1,442 \n3,127 \n \n1,246 \n132 \n1,378 \n4,505 \n\n \n \nFY = fiscal year, TJ = terajoule, toe = ton of oil equivalent. \nSource:  Government of Pakistan, Planning Commission. 2009.

The mainstreaming of \nenergy  efficiency  into  policy  and  planning  marks  a  radical  change.  This  creates  major \nopportunity  for  investments.  A  holistic  platform  for  energy  efficiency  is  required  to  create  a \nsustainable  policy  and  regulatory  framework;  an  integration  of  energy  efficiency  throughout \nnational  planning  and  public  investments;  energy  price  and  utility  rate-setting  reforms  and \nincentives;  a  strong  equipment  standards,  certification,  and  testing  regime;  and  easy, \nwidespread  access  to  energy  efficiency-specific  information,  financing,  products,  and  services \nby  all  categories  and  levels  of  energy  market  participants  and  end-users.  An  institutional \ncapacity assessment is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n29. \nNo integrated platform is in place for energy sector strategy and policy making. This is \nidentified as one of the key reasons for the current energy shortage crisis. The Ministry of Water \nand Power (MOWP) and Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources are responsible for their \nrespective  subsectors.  However,  coordination  between  the  two  is  weak.  Responsibility  for \nclimate  change  is  with  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  which  lacks  the  mandate  and  capacity  to \nundertake  such  work.  The  overall  planning  and  investment  approval  mandate  is  with  the \nPlanning Commission, as such, it is the only available platform to integrate the planning. Energy \n                                                 \n15  In Pakistan, the term \u201cenergy conservation\u201d is sometimes used interchangeably with the term \u201cenergy efficiency.\u201d  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\nefficiency covers multiple subsectors and requires an institutional structure that is functional and \neffective. Energy policies also need to reflect the needs of women and men. The Government \nand stakeholders recognize these fundamental weaknesses and agree on the need for reform. \n \nPlanning Commission. The Planning Commission is the federal government institution \n30. \nresponsible  for  economic  planning  and  development.  Its  main  function  is  to  prepare  strategic \nplanning and policy of the Government, including public sector development programs; and to \napprove  and  monitor  public  investment  projects.  The  commission  is  also  responsible  for \nintegrated energy strategy and planning. It thus has an overarching, cross-ministerial and cross-\nsectoral  advisory  and  coordination  mandate  for  the  energy  sector.  The  Office  of  the  Member \n(Energy), Planning Commission is in charge of these functions. ADB is supporting the strategic \nplanning  and  development  capacity  of  this  office  through  an  advisory  technical  assistance  on \nthe Integrated Energy Model.16  This would provide the Government with a tool to develop energy \nstrategy and policy based on objective sectorwide analysis.  \n \n31. \nNational Energy Conservation Centre. The center was established in 1985 and is the \nGovernment\u2019s  focal  point  on  energy  efficiency.  It  was  originally  set  up  under  the  Planning \nCommission  and  was  supported  by  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development's \n(USAID) technical and financial assistance. Since 1990, when USAID stopped the support, the \ncenter  has  been  severely  underresourced  and  moved  under  several  line  ministries;  it  is  now \nunder  the  Ministry  of  Environment.  It  has  lost  its  key  technical  staff;  professional  facilities; \nbusiness  processes;  and  the  knowledge  base  required  to  fulfill  its  mandate  for  coordinating, \npromoting, and facilitating national energy efficiency actions and creating an enabling business \nenvironment.  As  a  result,  the  center\u2019s  reputation  has  suffered,  and  it  lost  credibility  within  the \nGovernment and among stakeholders, including the private sector.  \n \n\nb. \n\nGovernance  \n\nADB\u2019s  comprehensive  governance  assessment  for  the  energy  sector  identified  several \n32. \nchallenges (fragmentation of functions and lack of integrated planning). Sector reforms have not \nyet been fully implemented. While the unbundling process is completed in the power subsector, \nthe entities created out of the Water and Power Development Authority still lack independence \nfrom one another. Activities are under way to improve corporate autonomy, cut the circular debt \nbetween companies, and increase financial management standards.  \n \n33. \nSince FY2002, electricity tariffs have been kept below cost. The difference between the \ntariff  determined  by  the  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory  Authority,  the  regulator,  at  cost-\nrecovery and that notified by the Government was never recovered by power entities, leading to \na circular debt situation. This difference was exasperated by escalating fuel prices in FY2008. \nThe Government took the first bold step by increasing the customer tariff by 20% in FY2008, but \nthe circular debt rose to PRs308 billion. Since the tariff paid by customers and tariff differential \nsubsidies  did  not  cover  costs,  the  distribution  companies  (DISCOs)  could  not  fully  pay  for  the \nsupply and thus payments to fuel suppliers were constrained by the generating companies. Also \nthe shortage in gas supply to the power subsector decreased the capacity by around 500 MW. \nTo alleviate the crisis and prevent reoccurrence, the Government set out a plan (Supplementary \nAppendix  C),  which  includes  (i)  tariff  issues,  (ii)  circular  debt,  and  (iii)  performance  of  power \ncompanies. \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to Pakistan for the Integrated Energy Model. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nc. \n\nStandards and Testing \n\n34. \nEnforcement  of  standards  is  generally  weak.  Successful  energy  efficiency  investments, \nparticularly  in  terms  of  demand-side  management,  need  to  be  underpinned  by  comprehensive \nenergy performance standards and a testing regime. The Pakistan Standards and Quality Control \nAuthority is the national standardization body. Quality standards are in place for lighting and some \nelectrical  appliances,  but  these  do  not  adequately  cover  all  main  product  categories,  types,  or \nsizes, nor are they properly enforced. Quality and performance standards need to be harmonized \nwith  international  standards.  The  Pakistan  Council  of  Scientific  and  Industrial  Research  is  the \nnational testing and certification body with seven regional laboratories. Equipment testing facilities \nneed  to  be  rapidly  augmented  to  enable  the  council  to  obtain  international  accreditation  and \nundertake energy performance testing.  \n \n\n3. \n\nCase for Energy Efficiency  \n\n35. \nIncreasing energy costs and demand make energy efficiency an absolute priority. Public \nfinancing  and  policy  incentives  will  encourage  businesses  to  invest  in  clean  technology  and \nenergy  efficiency.  Priority  investments  will  help  to  reduce  energy  consumption  and  improve \nproduction.  Power  and  gas  rationing  and  forced  outages  will  be  minimized.  The  social  and \neconomic  benefits  are  high,  with  a  multiplier  effect  on  society  through  productive  use  of \nconsumers\u2019 time and money. Utility revenues will increase, resulting in improved service quality \nand financial performance. The cross-subsidy provided by utilities to low-income customers will \nbe reduced. \n \nEnergy  efficiency  will  generate  \u201cnegawatts,\u201d  which  cost  a  fraction  of  equivalent \n36. \nmegawatts. It is the least-cost and shortest way to bridge the energy gap. The energy demand \nscenario,  with  and  without  energy  efficiency,  is  shown  in  Appendix  3.  The  marginal  cost  of \nadditional supply is much higher than the cost of investing in energy efficiency. The dispatch of \nthe highest-cost generation plants will drop and result in financial gains for companies and the \nGovernment. Stress on the transmission and distribution systems will be decreased. \n \n37. \nEnergy  efficiency  is  a  low-carbon  growth  path.  Deployment  of  clean  technology  and \npractice reduces GHG emissions and helps Pakistan achieve energy security through climate-\nfriendly means. \n \n38. \nInvestment  Requirement.  The  Energy  Efficiency  Investment  Program  for  2009\u20132018 \n(Table 2) is estimated to cost $3.8 billion (Supplementary Appendix D). The returns from energy \nefficiency investments in Pakistan can be high and the technical risks relatively low. This plan is \nbased  on  clean  technology  projects  in  priority  sectors.  It  also  includes  a  comprehensive \ninstitutional  development  program  to  strengthen  the  policy,  regulatory,  and  institutional \nframework  and  capacity.  It  assumes  that  no  external  barriers  to  such  actions\u2014in  the  form  of \nfinancing, information  and  technology  access, policy  and  pricing  disincentives,  and  other  such \nconstraints\u2014exist.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\nTable 2: Energy Efficiency Annual Investment Requirement \n($ million) \n\nPriority Area \n\nDomestic \n\nIndustry \n\nPower Generation \n\nTransmission and Distribution \n \n\nTotal  \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2013 \n\n2014 \n\n2015 \n\n2016 \n\n2017 \n\n2018 \n\n28 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n28 \n\n83 \n\n19 \n\n\u2013 \n\n16 \n118 \n\n27 \n\n114 \n\n153 \n\n42 \n336 \n\n80 \n\n343 \n\n210 \n\n44 \n674 \n\n89 \n\n553 \n\n150 \n\n28 \n820 \n\n63 \n\n517 \n\n135 \n\n\u2013 \n713 \n\n\u2013 \n\n267 \n\n202 \n\n\u2013 \n469 \n\n\u2013 \n\n76 \n\n272 \n\n\u2013 \n348 \n\n\u2013 \n\n19\n\n183\n\n\u2013 \n202\n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n67 \n\n\u2013 \n67 \n\nCumulative \n\n \nSource: Government of Pakistan, Planning Commission. 2009.

The MFF modality is considered the \nmost appropriate modality for clean technology and energy efficiency investments in Pakistan. \nThe preconditions for the use of an MFF have been fully met as follows.  \n \n40. \nRoad  Map.  The  Government has adopted a clear and sound strategic multisector road \nmap  for  energy  efficiency.  The  MFF  provides  a  mechanism  to  overcome  financial  barriers  to \nrealizing  the  road  map  targets.  The  road  map  is  based  on  extensive  consultations  and  inputs \nfrom all stakeholders.  \n \nStrategic Context. ADB\u2019s Pakistan country partnership strategy (footnote 4) has energy \n41. \nefficiency  as  a core intervention  area.  This  Investment  Program  is  a  continuation of  a  10-year \npolicy  dialogue.  The  projected  investments  are  consistent  and  closely  linked  to  ongoing  ADB \nenergy  sector  interventions\u2014renewable  energy,  generation  (mostly  private  sector  in  nature), \ntransmission,  and  distribution.  These  operations  also  fit  with  the  latest  negotiations  with  the \nGovernment  on  policy  reforms\u2014circular  debt,  tariff  regime,  and  the  National  Electric  Power \nRegulatory Authority Act. The MFF fits well within the strategic framework of Pakistan and ADB. \n \nPolicy  Framework.  The  Government  has  a  policy  framework  that  calls  for  maximizing \n42. \nenergy savings by rational and efficient use in all sectors. An integrated institutional structure and \nresource allocation is required for its implementation. The MFF will provide institutional and financial \nsupport to key stakeholders in strengthening and implementing the respective policy actions. \n \n43. \nSafeguards. The Investment Program has a comprehensive environmental framework. \nThe  MFF  will  allow  for  preparation  of  appropriate  environmental  and  social  safeguards  plans \nand mitigation measures for each tranche project. \n \n44. \nUndertakings. The Government has agreed to a set of commitments aimed to establish \na  dynamic  business  environment  for  the  sustained  transformation  of  the  energy  efficiency \nmarket;  and  scale  up  deployment  of  proven  technologies  through  public  investments  and \nfostering  private  investment.  The  MFF  allows  consistent  engagement  with  the  Government  in \nmonitoring  the  progress  of  the  commitments,  and  where  needed,  provide  advisory  support  to \nachieve the targets.  \n \nInvestment  and  Financing  Plan.  There  is  a  comprehensive  10-year  investment \n45. \nprogram ($3.8 billion) comprising a variety of sequenced supply- and demand-side investments \nin  priority  sectors  and  institutional  development  (i.e.,  capacity  building,  governance,  gender, \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nsafeguards, and project preparation and implementation). An indicative financing plan is defined \n(Table 3). The Government is actively looking for funding from external and domestic sources. \nThe  private  sector  is  expected  to  finance  49%,  including  domestic  and  external  commercial \nborrowing  and  equity  investments.  Official  external  borrowing  (i.e.,  from  international  financial \ninstitutions,  bilateral  agencies,  and  export\u2013import  banks)  is  expected  to  cover  35%.  ADB  and \nAFD financing will be through this MFF, which will act as the anchor for the investment plan and \nas the front-runner for commercial investments. The MFF will finance a slice of the investment \nprogram, and offers the Government a choice of financing instruments. The MFF also provides \na strategic financing partnership platform. Active consultations with other parties are ongoing to \nattract other cofinanciers for future MFF tranches.  \n\n \nTable 3: Indicative Energy Efficiency Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nGovernment of Pakistan \nOfficial External \n  Asian Development Bank \n  Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppementa \n  United States Agency for International Development b \n  Others \nCommercial Domestic \nCommercial External \nTotal \na \u20ac150 million equivalent. \nb Additional financing is being planned. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Planning Commission estimates. \n\n \n\n5. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\nAmount\n600\n\n \n780 \n200 \n30 \n320 \n900 \n950 \n3,780 \n\n46. \nThe  Government  wants  a  medium-term  partnership  and  commitment  from  the \ndevelopment financiers in implementing energy efficiency in the country. The EECCG provides \na  functional  platform  for  collaboration  among  all  stakeholders  and  financiers.  Development \npartners\u2019 actions are directly linked and coordinated under the road map. A matrix of institutional \nresponsibilities was prepared to complement the road map. \n \nAFD  is  a  cofinancier  of  this  Investment  Program.  The  Japan  International  Cooperation \n47. \nAgency  is  developing  a  national  climate  change  policy  program.  German  development \ncooperation  through  GTZ  is  implementing  industrial  energy  audits,  appliance  labeling,  and \ncertification  programs.  USAID  is  implementing  a  large  technical  assistance  program  to \nstrengthen energy demand-side management capacity in the utilities and the private sector. The \nWorld Bank is implementing utility-based demand-side management demonstration programs. \n \n48. \nIn  the  overall  energy  sector,  ADB  is  the  largest  development  partner,  followed  by  the \nWorld Bank and Japan International Cooperation Agency. The European Investment Bank has \nsigned up to a cofinancing partnership with ADB in the area of renewable energy. The Islamic \nDevelopment Bank is financing small hydropower projects in Northern Pakistan. \n \nThe  Canadian  International  Development  Agency  has  been  helping  with  energy  policy \n49. \nand regulations, and hydropower projects. It has also supported public and private companies \nwith  reforms  in  the  management  of  hydrocarbon  resources.  The  Government  of  France  is \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\nworking  on mini-hydropower  projects  in  the  North-West  Frontier  Province.  The  Government  of \nGermany is supporting renewable energy projects, and the Government of Japan is supporting \nthe  modernization  and  expansion  of  the  power  transmission  and  distribution  system.  The \nGovernment  of  the  Netherlands  is  supporting  the  introduction  of  clean  industrial  production. \nUSAID is working on energy policy, pricing, and capacity development. USAID is also planning \nto substantially expand its energy program starting from 2010. \n \n\n6. \n\nAsian Development Bank Operations  \n\n50. \nADB provides about one third of total external assistance to the energy sector, and has \nthe largest portfolio of ongoing projects. It has been engaged in reforms, capacity development \nactivities,  and  private  sector  participation.  Physical  investments  have  focused  on  power \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution. Since the start of operations in Pakistan in 1968, total \nlending  to  the  sector  amounts  to  about  $4.2  billion,  of  which  $3.6  billion  is  for  power  and  \n$0.6  billion  for  natural  gas  and  petroleum  development.  In  2009,  the  energy  portfolio  has \nreceived three MFFs, totaling $2.1 billion and covering renewable energy, power transmission, \nand  power  distribution.  Technical  assistance  areas  include  integrated  energy  planning  model, \ntariff rationalization, and institutional strengthening and restructuring. \n \n51. \nA  country  assistance  program  evaluation  completed  in  May  2007  assessed  the \ndevelopment impact of ADB\u2019s strategy and operations during 1985\u20132006. While the evaluation \nconfirms  that  ADB\u2019s  development  responsiveness  and  credibility  is  recognized  in  Pakistan, \nADB\u2019s  overall  program  and  sector  performance  was  rated  \u201cpartly  successful.\u201d  The  evaluation \nfound  ADB\u2019s  performance  to  be  mixed,  in  terms  of  contribution  to  development  results,  and \npointed to areas where program and sector improvements were needed. The evaluation found \nthat  the  large  ADB  program  covered  too  many  sectors  and  interventions  with  too  few  staff, \ncomplex project designs hindered implementation, analytical work to support policy dialogue in \nimportant sectors had gaps, and public sector operations significantly outnumbered those in the \nprivate sector. Operations in the energy sector were rated \u201csuccessful.\u201d17 \n \n\n7. \n\nLessons  \n\nThe energy sector needs substantial investments. Consistent policy dialogue is required \n52. \nto  achieve  sustained  progress  and  ensure  maximum  impact.  Development  partners  have  a \ncontinuing role to play in reforms and financing. The reforms, while complex, are taking longer \nthan  anticipated.  Sector  regulation  and  pricing  is  conceptually  sufficient.  However,  political \ninfluence  in  the  decisions  has  been  significant.  Power  unbundling  and  restructuring  has  been \nachieved  legally.  However,  power  utilities  lack  the  financial  autonomy  needed  to  make  sound \ncommercial decisions and investment in system maintenance, operations, and expansion.  \n \nADB strategy has focused on supporting power transmission and distribution companies \n53. \nin  achieving  financial  autonomy  and  improving  service.  ADB  financing  is  most  useful  if  it  is \nleveraged by working with other sources of finance, both public and private. ADB and the World \nBank have clear and focused financing interventions backed by institutional reform and capacity \ndevelopment  support.  The  World  Bank  is  supporting  public  sector  power  entities,  and  is \npromoting  performance  contracts  as  a  way  of  increasing  accountability  and  efficiency  in  the \nsector. MOWP supports this approach.  \n \n\n                                                 \n17  The  overall  success  rate  of  energy  sector  projects  during  1985\u20132006  was  a  high  81%.  The  success  rate  for \n\nprojects approved in the 1990s was, however, much lower at 50%. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\n54.  Most  ADB-financed  projects  in  the  energy  sector  have  been  sector  loans.  The  more \nrecent  additions  are  MFFs.  The  latter  allows  flexibility  in  project  selection  and  project \nmanagement,  while  maintaining  focus  on  reforms  and  performance.  Cost  overruns  have  been \ngreatly  reduced,  although  implementation  remains  slow.  Delays  have  been  caused  by \ncumbersome  government  internal  approval  process  (i.e.,  Project  Cycle-I  [PC-I]  and  Project \nCycle-II  [PC-II])  for  physical  investments  and  recruitment  of  consultants.  This  is  due  to \norganizational and institutional weaknesses, and shortage of qualified staff.  \n \nSpecific  lessons  from  previous  projects18 involve  (i)  inadequate  stakeholder  consultations \n55. \nduring the design stage, (ii) weak management, (iii) lack of advance actions, (iv) long delays in \nthe  approval  of  umbrella  PC-I  and  individual  tranche  PC-Is,  and  (v) inadequate  project \nmanagement skills.  \n \n56. \nThe  Investment  Program  addresses  these  concerns,  and  incorporates  PC-I  approvals \ninto  project  readiness  criteria.  The  umbrella  PC-I  for  the  MFF  was  approved  at  the  MFF  fact-\nfinding stage. Procurement was initiated subsequent to Management endorsement of advance \naction.  The  facility  administration  manual  (Supplementary  Appendix  E),  prepared  during \nprogram design, defines the roles and responsibilities of each implementing agency as well as \nindividual staff. It also ensures ownership of the implementing agency and targets start-up and \nimplementation  delays.  Extensive  stakeholder  consultations  were  conducted  at  the  sector, \nsubsector levels, and inputs were properly incorporated into the program design.  \n \n57. \nTo  mitigate  project  development  and  implementation  delays,  program  management \nsupport  is  provided  to  help  project  entities  with  project  preparation  and  management.  The \nInvestment  Program  will  use  the  systems  and  capacity  that  is  being  created  as  part  of  other \nADB-financed  projects.  Close  linkage  with  existing  projects  ensures  that  technical  capacity  is \nadequate  for  implementation.  Capacity  constraints  will  be  defined  during  early  project \npreparation  stages  and  proper  consulting  inputs.  The  MFF  allows  the  flexibility  to  develop \ncapacity parallel with project development and implementation.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n58. \nThe Investment Program will bring about major energy savings and cut GHG emissions by \n30% during the 10-years of implementation (2009\u20132018). It will improve Pakistan\u2019s energy security \nand economic competitiveness by lowering energy intensity and improving energy productivity.  \n \n59. \nEnergy efficiency will help balance energy  demand and supply, and  optimize the energy \nmix  by  reducing  oil  imports.  It  will  slow  energy  demand  and  increase  supply;  and  (i) decrease \nlarge  financial  outlays,  (ii)  minimize  uneconomical  standby  capacity  required  to  cater  to  peak \nloads, (iii) reduce subsidies, and (iv) defer transmission and distribution system expansion needs. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe Investment Program will be Pakistan's first tangible step toward a low-carbon growth \n\n60. \npath. It has nonphysical and physical investments. Key outputs include \n\n                                                 \n18 Ten ADB-financed power projects approved before 1983 were evaluated. All are classified \u201cgenerally successful.\u201d \nThe  evaluation  findings  show  an  average  implementation  delay  of  2.4  years  (78%).  Five  of  the  projects \nexperienced an average cost overrun of about 82%, and the other five an underrun of 28%. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nenergy  efficiency  mainstreamed  into  planning  and  investments;  and  managed \neffectively  under  strengthened  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  frameworks  and \ninstitutional capacities; \na national energy efficiency standards, testing, and certification regime; \ndemand-side management mainstreamed in energy utility operations; \nelectricity  peak  demand  reduced by  1,094  MW  ($1.8 billion in  avoided generation \ninvestment), and 2,670 GWh (valued at $222 million) electricity saved annually; \n601,671 ton of oil equivalent (toe) /25,191 TJ (valued at $200 million) energy saved \nannually  from  reducing  transformation  losses  in  power  generation  and  gas \ntransmission; \n918,942  toe  /38,474  TJ  (valued  at  $330  million)  energy  saved  annually  from \nreducing gas, oil, and coal use in the domestic and industry sectors; and \n\n(vii)  GHG emissions cut by 1 million tons carbon dioxide (CO2) annually from decreased \n\nfossil fuel use through clean technology and practice applications. \n\n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  finance  operations  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  lighting  and \n61. \nappliances  in  domestic,  public,  and  commercial  sectors;  (ii)  energy  loss  reduction  in  thermal \npower  generation;  (iii) energy  loss  reduction  technology  in  the  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems; and (iv) industrial energy efficiency programs. \n \n62. \nProject Selection. The following criteria will be used to select individual projects: energy \nsavings,  mature  and  applicable  technologies,  financial  and  economic  viability,  and  residual \nenvironmental and social impacts. Some projects will be demonstration models.  \n \n63. \nTranche  1.  Tranche  1  of  the  MFF  will  finance  two  projects:  the  National  Compact \nFluorescent  Lamp  (CFL)  Project  (Appendix  4),  and  the  Investment  Program  Management \nSupport Project (Appendix 5). Table 5 shows the cost estimates and financing plan (details in \nAppendix 6). \n \n64. \nThe CFL project will replace about 30 million incandescent bulbs in the domestic sector \nwith efficient, high-quality CFLs. The Government will cover the cost of CFL bulk procurement \nand  public  awareness  campaign  costs  amounting  to  $65  million  equivalent  from  the  ADB  and \nAFD  loan  proceeds  and  repay  from  the  budget.  Eight  power  distribution  companies  (DISCOs) \nand  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Company  will  cover  the  cost  of  door-to-door  CFL  delivery  ($20 \nmillion equivalent) to registered household customers in their license areas. \n \n65. \nThe  Investment  Program  Management  Support  Project  will  help  the  Government \nmanage  the  Investment  Program  and  execute  projects  under  each  tranche.  It  will  help  with \npolicy  and  institutional  reform,  safeguard  management,  gender  mainstreaming,  financing \ncontrols,  monitoring,  evaluation,  and  results  reporting.  The  component  will  include  design  and \ndue diligence work for future tranches.  \n \n66. \nTranche 2. The tranche is expected to comprise a $30 million financial intermediary loan \nand  financing  for  a  risk-sharing  demonstration  project  for  industrial  energy  efficiency \n(Supplementary Appendix F). The industry sector is the largest consumer of energy in Pakistan, \nwith significant savings potential in clean and efficient technology, and equipment replacement \nor  upgrades.  Industrial  enterprises  that  have  undergone  energy  audits  are  not  able  to  acquire \nthe  recommended  clean  technologies  because  of  the  high-cost  of  debt  and  inadequate  terms \noffered  by  the  banking  system.  The  banks  are  keen  to  acquire  capacity  to  assess  energy \nefficiency projects and build their clean energy books if they can safely match-fund these assets \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nto mitigate asset\u2013liability mismatch risk. The Ministry of Industries and Production is leading a \nworking group comprising industry representatives and commercial banks under the EECCG to \nfacilitate stakeholder inputs into the facility design. The Government is expected to submit the \nPFR  for  this  project  in  February  2010.  The  project  will  be  implemented  in  18  months.  If \nsuccessful,  the  financing  model  will  be  replicated  under  subsequent  tranches.  This  project  is \nalso  linked  with  USAID  and  GTZ  technical  assistance  to  industries  undertaking  energy  audits \nand  for  building  the  capacity  of  energy  service  companies.  Private  energy  service  companies \nmay be supported under this facility. \n \n67. \nTranche 3. The tranche is expected to support a thermal power plant rehabilitation and \nreplacement  project.  The  project  will  rehabilitate  and  replace  inefficient  facility  and  equipment \nprioritized  in  the  generation  company  (GENCO)  investment  plan.  ADB  is  assisting  the \nGovernment  in  conducting  a  diagnostic  assessment  of  three  public  sector  GENCO  assets, \ncomprising  six  thermal  power  plants  operating  on  natural  gas  and  furnace  oil.  The  study  will \ncompare  the  present  performance  with  the  technological  benchmarks,  and  based  on  techno-\neconomic analysis recommend the required rehabilitation option for each GENCO plant. MOWP \nis  preparing  a  detailed  investment  plan  based  on  the  results  of  this  assessment.  A  project \nfeasibility study will be prepared, and the Government is expected to submit the PFR for the first \npower generation upgrade subproject in October 2010. A subsequent PFR is expected in 2012.  \n \nTranche  4. The tranche is expected to finance a gas compressor upgrade project. The \n68. \ncurrent installed capacity of compressor stations in northern Pakistan is approximately 200,000 \nhorsepower  (hp),  based  on  1,100\u20133,830 hp  gas  turbines  driving  centrifugal  compressors.  The \ngas  consumed  in  these  compressors  is  considered  a  technical  loss.  In  addition,  the \ncompressors  incur  high  maintenance  costs  and  have  low  availability  due  to  frequent \nbreakdowns. The net efficiency of the compressors in the system has improved significantly with \nthe  installation  of  new  compressors.  The  project  will  replace  existing  stock  of  inefficient \ncompressor units and bring the total compression capacity up to 227,500 hp.  \n \n69. \nSubsequent  tranche  projects  for  (i)  scaled-up  industrial  energy  efficiency  financing, \n(ii) energy  efficiency  retrofitting  programs  in  the  public  and  commercial  sectors,  (iii)  gas  and \nelectric appliance appliances, and (iv) private thermal power generation efficiency rehabilitation \nwill  be  identified  and  prepared  based  on  the  selection  criteria.  The  amount  of  ADB  financing \napproved under the MFF may be converted into instruments like guarantees for such activities \nas ADB considers necessary and appropriate in line with ADB's policies. \n  \nC. \n \n70. \n  The  Investment  Program  is  the  first  effort  in  Pakistan  to  integrate  energy  security  and \nclimate  change  into  a  common  strategic  platform.  It  underpins  a  reform  strategy  that  will \nmainstream  energy  efficiency  and  clean  technology  deployment  into  national  planning  and \npublic investments. Specific actions will go beyond just energy conservation (i.e., switching off \nlights).  The  Investment  Program  will  strengthen  regulatory  and  institutional  frameworks, \nestablish fiscal and financial incentives, and enforce standards and testing. It builds on ADB\u2019s \nongoing work to establish an integrated energy planning model. It strengthens capacity among \nkey  participants,  particularly  in  policy  planning,  gender  mainstreaming,  investment,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  break  down  the  financial  barriers  to  clean  energy \n71. \ninvestments,  and  finance  deployment  of  clean  technology  that  has  been  successfully \ndemonstrated. The private sector will play a key part in the deployment of clean technology and \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\nenergy  services,  and  will  be  a  direct  beneficiary  (on  the  supply  and  demand  sides).  Energy \nsavings  will  lower  production  costs  and  increase  competitiveness.  Energy  efficiency  will  also \ncreate new business opportunities. Private energy service companies will be supported through \ntechnical  and  financial  support.  Public\u2013private  partnerships  will  also  emerge  under  the  power \ngeneration  component.  In  addition,  the  investments  under  the  MFF  are  closely  linked  and \ncomplemented by interventions of other international financial institutions and bilateral agencies; \nand  MFF  will  leverage  commercial  financing  in  energy  efficiency  and  help  build  clean  energy \nportfolios of commercial banks. These investments have low risks and robust paybacks. \n \n72. \nThe  Investment  Program  thus  sets  out  a  framework  for  effective  partnership  with  third \nparties\u2014investors  and  financiers\u2014over  the  medium  term.  Besides  AFD,  other  development \npartners  may  determine  to  complement  ADB's  financing  after  the  Board's  approval  of  the \nproposed MFF through cofinancing to be administered by ADB. The amounts of cofinancing to \nbe  provided  by  such  other  development  partners  and  administered  by  ADB  will  be  deducted \nfrom the total MFF amount. Such cofinancing may be provided as loans or grants, and may take \nthe  form  of  parallel  or  joint  cofinancing.  ADB's  administration  of  such cofinancing from  time  to \ntime will be reported to the Board for information annually.19 \n \nD. \n \n73. \n \n\nThe Investment Program cost is estimated at $ 1,180 million (Table 4). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plan \n\n Table 4: Indicative Investment and Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\n2.

See paragraph 79.  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\nAFD will provide cofinancing of up to \u20ac150 million, and the Government will finance the \n75. \nremaining  $200  million  equivalent.  Conditions  and  arrangements  for  AFD  cofinancing  will  be \nseparately agreed between the Government and AFD. For each tranche under the MFF, ADB \nand AFD will enter into a cofinancing agreement in order for ADB to handle AFD's cofinancing \non a partial-administration basis. The items to be jointly cofinanced by AFD under each tranche \nwill be based on the related financing plan as agreed among the Government, AFD and ADB. \n \n76. \nTranche  1.  ADB  financing  under  the  first  tranche  will  be  provided  from  ordinary  capital \nresources ($40 million) and Special Funds resources ($20 million equivalent). The ordinary capital \nresources  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5 years,  an  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  Special  Funds  resources  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years  with  an  interest  charge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace \nperiod  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  AFD  will  jointly  cofinance  a  loan  (\u20ac20  million)  in \naccordance  with the terms and conditions agreed between  the  Government  and AFD. The cost \nestimates  and  financing  plan  for  tranche  1  are  in  Table  5.  ADB  assessed  the  tax  and  duty \nstructure  in  Pakistan,  and  taxes  and  duties  are  eligible  for  ADB  financing  (footnote  4). \nAccordingly, ADB will finance taxes and duties where appropriate under tranche 1. \n \n\nTable 5: Tranche 1 Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nProjects \nNational Compact Fluorescent Lamp Project\nInvestment Program Management Support Project \n\nTotal \n\nAmount\n85\n25 \n\n110\n\nGov\u2019t \n20\n5 \n\n25\n\nADB \n40 \n20 \n\nAFD a\n25\n\u2013 \n\n60 \n\n25\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, AFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, Gov\u2019t = Government of Pakistan. \na \u20ac20 million equivalent. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n77. \nExecuting  Agency.  The  Planning  Commission  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the \nInvestment  Program  and  will  manage  and  coordinate  overall  implementation,  and  monitoring \nand evaluation. It will be responsible for the submission of PFRs to ADB. Individual projects and \nsubprojects to be financed under the MFF will be identified and prepared by the line or sector \nministries  and,  as  appropriate,  concerned  agencies  in  the  relevant  sector(s).  The  EECCG  will \nhold stakeholder consultations. The Planning Commission agrees with the facility administration \nmanual, which specifies the roles and responsibilities of each office and team.  \n \n78. \nProgram  Management  Office.  The  Planning  Commission  will  establish  a  program \nmanagement office (PMO). The PMO will support the Office of the Member (Energy), Planning \nCommission  and  the  concerned  agencies  for  the  implementation  of  (i)  the  road  map\u2014policy, \nplanning, interagency and development partner cooperation, and capacity building support; and \n(ii)  the  Investment  Program\u2014reporting,  monitoring,  selection  and  preparation  of  investment \nprojects,  and  consultant  support.  The  PMO  will  be  sufficiently  staffed  under,  and  obtain \nresources  from,  the  Investment  Program  Management  Support  Project.  A  highly  qualified  and \nexperienced  program  director  with  energy  sector  expertise  will  lead  the  PMO.  The  PMO \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\nstructure  will  comprise  the  following  core  teams:  technical;  legal;  safeguards;  gender \nmainstreaming; and monitoring, evaluation, and reporting. The PMO will inform the EECCG on \nthe road map and implementation progress of the Investment Program. It will facilitate EECCG \nmeetings. Details on the implementation arrangements are in Appendix 7.  \n \n\n2. \n\nTranche 1 Project Management \n\n79. \nNational  CFL  Project.  MOWP  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  It  has  delegated  the \nPakistan  Electric  Power  Company  (PEPCO)  to  carry  out  procurement.  Eight  DISCOs  and \nKarachi  Electric  Supply  Company  will  help  implement  this  project  in  their  respective  license \nareas. Detailed implementation arrangements are in Appendix 4. \n \nPEPCO will (i) carry out bulk procurement of CFLs on behalf of MOWP; (ii) organize a \n80. \npublic  awareness  campaign;  and  (iii)  coordinate  and  monitor  project  implementation  activities. \nThe  DISCOs  and  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Company  will  be  responsible  for,  among  others,  (i) \ntransportation and delivery of CFLs to all eligible households; and (ii) collection and disposal of \nall incandescent bulbs replaced. \n \n81. \nThe project management units (PMUs) established in PEPCO and eight DISCOs under \nthe  ADB-assisted  Power  Distribution  Enhancement  Investment  Program20 will  also  be  made \nresponsible  for  assisting  with  implementing  this  project.  These  PMUs  will  coordinate  and \nmanage their respective project activities and liaise with MOWP and project consultants.  \n \n82. \nInvestment  Program  Management  Support  Project.  The  Planning  Commission,  as \nExecuting Agency for the Investment Program, will be responsible for this Project. It will recruit \nconsultants  to  support  sector  agencies  to  prepare  projects  to  be  financed  under  the  MFF. \nExternal  expertise  will  be  provided  to  support  the  PMO  in  implementing  the  road  map  actions \nand  adopting  best  practices  in  project  and  policy  development,  as  well  as  human  resource \ndevelopment and training. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period  \n\n83. \nThe Investment Program will be implemented over 10 years; it may be completed earlier. \nImplementation of each tranche is expected to require from 2 to 5 years. The last PFR should be \nsubmitted not later than the end of 2014. The MFF implementation schedule is in Appendix 7.  \n \n84. \n \n\nTranche 1 will be implemented as follows: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nThe National CFL Project will be implemented by 31 January 2012.  \nThe Investment Program Management Support Project will be implemented by 30 \nSeptember 2016.  \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n85. \nThe Government has requested ADB approval of advance procurement of works, goods, \nand  consultants.  Advance  procurement  actions  will  apply  for  all  tranches.  The  Government \nrequested retroactive financing of up to 20% of each loan amount. The Government has been \ninformed that approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to \nfinance any of the proposed projects. \n                                                 \n20  ADB.  2008.

National competitive bidding will \nbe  used  for  goods  contracts  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $1  million,  and  for  works  contracts \nestimated to cost less than $5 million. A procurement plan is in Appendix 8. Procurement plans \nfor subsequent tranches may include other modes of procurement, in line with the nature of the \nproject.  \n \n87. \nAll  procurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  procedures  for  national  competitive  bidding  are  the \nPublic Procurement Rules, 2004.21 These comply with ADB rules. \n \n88. \nConsulting  services  will  be  engaged  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection.  Individual \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with government procedures acceptable to ADB. Other \nmodes of selection of firms may be used for subsequent tranches in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time), depending on the circumstances of \nthe project. \n  \n89. \nInvestment Program (footnote 20) will be asked to support implementation of the CFL project. \n \n\nProject  implementation  consultants  engaged  under  the  Power  Distribution  Enhancement \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n90. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government, executing and implementing agencies. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices \nrelating  to  the  Investment  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the \nInvestment  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the \nInvestment  Program  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine \nthe  records  and  accounts  of  the  executing  agencies;  implementing  agencies;  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Investment \nProgram. ADB retains the right to suspend or cancel the entire Investment Program in case of \nproven wrongdoing. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement  \n\n91. \nAll  loan  disbursements  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Under  tranche  1,  imprest  accounts  will  be \nestablished for the Planning Commission and MOWP. The total advance amount to be deposited \ninto  the  imprest  accounts  will  not  exceed  the  lower  of  (i)  the  estimated  ADB  share  of  eligible \nexpenditures  to  be  financed  through  the  relevant  imprest  account  for  6  months,  or  (ii)  the \nequivalent of 10% of the relevant loan amount. Statement of expenditure procedure will be used \nto  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  provided  into  the  relevant  imprest \naccounts for any individual payment not exceeding $100,000.   \n\n                                                 \n21  SRO 432 (1)/2004 issued on 9 June 2004 by the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Ordinance 2002 (XXII of \n\n2002). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\n8. \n\nAuditing, and Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe  FFA, \n\nloan  agreements,  and \n\nfor  accounting,  auditing, \n\nfacility  administration  manual  describe  ADB \n92. \nreporting,  monitoring,  and  evaluation.  These \nrequirements \nrequirements  were  thoroughly  discussed  and  agreed  with  the  Government,  executing  and \nimplementing agencies. \n \n\n9. \n\nGovernance  \n\n93. \nThe  MFF-financed  projects  will  be  primarily  implemented  by  agencies  and  utilities  with \nwhich ADB has prior and ongoing client relations. Specific governance undertakings are given in \nthe  FFA.  ADB  will  assess  the  financial  management,  corporate  governance,  and  procurement \ncapacity of each entity. Measurable performance indicators will be agreed for each project to be \nfinanced  under  the  Investment  Program,  and  will  be  monitored.  The  results  framework  will \ncapture these indicators. Advisory services will assist project entities to monitor, evaluate, and \nreport  against  these  indicators.  Future  tranche  project  due  diligence  will  comprise  a \ncomprehensive risk assessment for each project entity and incorporate appropriate governance \nmeasures.   \n \nThe  Investment  Program  is  the  continuation  of  ADB  support  for  energy  reforms  and \n94. \nrestructuring, and the creation of a commercially oriented corporate culture in sector companies. \nThe  capacity  development  activities  will  support  organizational  and  governance  efforts;  will \nenhance  the  capacity  of  utilities  to  manage  both  physical  and  financial  activities;  and  provide \nmanagement and financial reporting to meet the accounting, asset management, and reporting \nrequirements  of  the  Government  and  ADB.  Use  of  ADB  guidelines  for  procurement  and \nconsulting  services  and  standard  bidding  documents  will  ensure  better  monitoring.  Bid \nspecifications and packaging will allow maximum competition. \n \n95. \nRecruitment  of  financial  management  experts  and  establishment  of  internal  control \nsystems  supported  with  advanced  information  and  communication  technology-based  financial \nmanagement  systems  will  ensure  efficiency  and  accountability.  External  auditors  will  audit  the \nfinancial  statements,  which  will  be  published  regularly  and  reported  to  the  public  and \nshareholders. ADB  will have regular access to the accounting and controls systems of project \nentities  (implementing  agencies)  to  monitor  expenditures  and  other  financial  transactions,  and \nensure safe custody of project-financed assets.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Beneficiaries  \n\n1. \n\nMacroeconomic Benefits \n\n96. \nLong-term  economy  wide  benefits  include  annual  savings  of  $4  billion  by  FY2019, \ncorresponding to 3% of GDP.22 Presently, oil accounts for 31% of total energy consumption in the \ncountry,  84%  of  oil  is  imported.  The  country\u2019s  oil  import  bill  was  $12  billion  in  FY2008  (7.5%  of \nGDP).  High  dependence  on  oil  imports  results  in  a  suboptimal  energy  supply  mix,  as  oil  is  the \nmost  expensive  nonrenewable  fossil  energy  source.  The  proportion  of  oil  in  the  energy  mix  is \nprojected  to  increase  to  36%  by  FY2019.  Realization  of  the  energy  savings  potential  in  the \neconomy  will  result  in  a  14%  decrease  in  the  projected  energy  deficit  by  FY2019,  with  a \n\n                                                 \n22 Assuming average annual GDP growth rate of 5.5%. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\ncorresponding  reduction  of  22%  in  the  projected  oil  import  bill.23 This  will  improve  the  country\u2019s \nbalance  of  payments.  In  the  long  term  this  will  help  optimize  the  energy  mix,  secure  reliable \nenergy  supply,  and  reduce  consumption  costs,  which  will  lead  to  social  and  economic  benefits \nand improved economic conditions. \n \n97.  While the Government hopes to balance power demand and supply by FY2012, it needs to \ninvest  a  significant  amount  to  enhance  power  generation  capacity,  and  the  transmission  and \ndistribution system. By saving 2,670 GWh on the demand side, the Investment Program will ensure \nthat the Government\u2019s targets are met in the most cost-effective and sustainable manner.  \n \n98. \nEnergy  deficits  can cause  social  unrest  and  political instability,  resulting  in  reactionary, \nshort-term  policy  responses,  such  as  high-cost  and  inefficient  rental  power  capacities.  Such \nmeasures have long-term implications for the economy. A rational approach is to opt for energy \nefficiency  and  allocation  of  energy  to  productive  sectors,  and  to  add  supply-side  capacities, \nwhich are least cost and bring in long-term benefits.  \n \nElectricity  is  largely  being  consumed  in  the  domestic  and  industry  sectors  and  is  not  a \n99. \nmajor energy source for the agriculture and transport sectors. While domestic electricity consumers \nhave  some  degree  of  flexibility  in  coping  with  power  shortages,  industry  is  forced  to  curtail \nproduction  in  the  short  term.  The  long-term  response  of  manufacturing  to  power  shortages  is  to \ninvest in captive power generation, which draws on the scarce capital and management resources \nof  the  sector.  Reliable  energy  supply  through  the  Investment  Program,  specifically  the  industrial \nefficiency component, will help increase industrial output in the near term. \n \n\n2. \n\nIncreased Competitiveness  \n\n100.  The  Investment  Program  will  facilitate  a  viable  energy  services  industry,  and  affect \nmarket transformation in favor of energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable products and \nservices.  The  electricity  and  gas  saved  would  be  available  for  uses  that  are  more  productive, \nwill increase utility revenues by redirecting sale to higher-tariff consumers, and reduce the need \nfor lifeline subsidies. The Investment Program will help the Government move toward attaining \nits stated policy objectives of achieving energy efficiency and energy security. \n \n101.  Energy  efficiency  in  industries  will  reduce  the  sector\u2019s  energy  bill,  and  thereby  lower \nproduction costs of goods and services for the efficient segments. This will induce competition \nwithin  the  industry,  promote  efficiency  in  the  long  term,  and  lead  to  a  transformation  of  the \nsector toward lower energy intensity. Simultaneously, increased demand for efficient appliances \nand equipment will induce competition in the suppliers\u2019 market, promoting skill and technological \ndevelopment for local manufacturers as well. Lower production costs, through reduced energy \nbills  for  energy-intensive  industries,  will  help  establish  competitive  markets.  The  Investment \nProgram  will  facilitate  a  viable  energy  efficiency  audit  and  management  industry,  and  affect \nmarket transformation in favor of energy and environmentally efficient products and services. \n \n\n3. \n\nGender Impacts \n\n102.  The  Investment  Program  will  benefit  women.  For  the  poorest  households  (especially \nthose  headed  by  women),  the  unavailability  of  energy  is  experienced  as  a  driver  of  social \ninequality  and  vulnerability.  Gender  aspects  will  be  mainstreamed  in  the  energy  policy.  The \nphysical investments will increase energy access and quality of service. Energy efficiency can \n\n                                                 \n23 Developed using crude oil price of $50/barrel. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21\n\nstrengthen women\u2019s role in society. Reduced energy bills will increase the disposable incomes \nof households, which will improve social welfare and bring relief to women who have to run their \nhouseholds  on  limited  budgets,  particularly  among  the  middle-  and  lower-income  groups.  The \ndomestic  gas  appliance  replacement  program  will  introduce  efficient  cooking  and  heating \ndevices, which will help build awareness of energy efficiency, particularly among women.  \n \n\n4. \n\nEnvironmental Benefits \n\n103.  The  Investment  Program  will  result  in  a  range  of  environmental  benefits.  Energy \nefficiency  leads  to  a  cleaner  and  better  environment. About  1  million  tons  of  CO2  emission \nreductions  will  be  realized  annually  beginning  in  2010.  In  Pakistan,  power  generation, \nparticularly from fossil fuels, has negative environmental impacts, which will be mitigated by end \nusers  saving  electricity  and  increasing  generation  efficiency. Emissions  of  atmospheric \npollutants  from  industrial  plants  will  result  in  cleaner  air.   The  natural  gas  saved  will  displace \nheavy fuel oil in power generation and industry, which will help improve air quality through lower \nsulfur  and  particulate  emissions.  The  construction  of  a  lamp  waste  management  facility  will \nlower health risks associated with residual mercury from the expanding CFL market. \n \nB. \n\nTechnical Aspects \n\n104.  The  Investment  Program  will  accelerate  the  deployment  of  clean  technologies  and \ninitiate actions that will help realize energy savings potential in the country. Reduced electricity \nuse in the industry, residential, and public sectors of 2,670 GWh per year amounts to 3.6% of the \ncountry\u2019s  73,400  GWh  of  electricity  consumption.  The  corresponding  peak  load  reduction  of  \n1,094 MW amounts to 8% of the country\u2019s available generation capacity of 14,000 MW. Reduced \ntransformation  and  supply  losses  of  601,671  toe  (26,595  TJ)  per  year  in  gas  transmission  and \nthermal power generation represent 1.3% of the country\u2019s total oil and gas consumption in FY2008. \nReduced  gas, oil, and coal  use in the  residential and industry sectors  amounting  to  918,942  toe \n(40,619 TJ) per year, represent savings of 2% of the country\u2019s current total energy consumption.  \n \n105.  CFL  Project.  Grid-connected  households  have  42  million  light  points  fitted  with \nincandescent  bulbs.  The  project  will  replace  10  million  incandescent  bulbs  in  2010  (phase  1) \nand 20 million in 2011 (phase 2). The maximum peak load from incandescent bulbs is estimated \nto be 3,166 MW in the country. Peak demand will be reduced by about 1,094 MW (at 66% peak \ncoincidence),  resulting  in  savings  of  2,132  GWh/year  valued  at  $177  million.  Considering \nupstream  losses  and  reserve  margin  requirements,  the  CFL  project  is  therefore  capable  of \navoiding  $1.84  billion  in  investments  for  1,600  MW  in  new  installed  peak  generation  capacity \nthat would otherwise be required by 2011. \n \n106.  A  lighting  baseline  survey  in  April  2009  found  that  37  million  incandescent  bulb  light \npoints in the 40\u2013100 W range contribute at least 2,028 MW to the system peak. Incandescent \nbulbs in households are consuming as much as 4,140 GWh annually. Average daily load curves \nshow  peak  demand  on  the  power  grid  starting  at  5:00  p.m.  in  the  winter  and  8:00  p.m.  in  the \nsummer, and lasting approximately 5 hours in both cases. Household lighting represents 15% of \nthis evening peak.  \n \n107.  An  impact  evaluation  exercise  will  be  conducted.  It  will  assess  the  project  impact  on \nhousehold  energy  consumption  and  bills.  The  results  and  lessons  will  be  incorporated  in  the \nsucceeding  implementation.  They  will  also  be  beneficial  to  other  similar  projects  in  ADB's \ndeveloping  member  countries.  Further  evaluation  will  be  done  over  time  with  future  tranches. \nThe results and lessons will be incorporated into the design of each operation. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nC. \n\nFinancial Aspects \n\n108.  A  financial  management  assessment  of  proposed  project  entities  was  undertaken \n(Supplementary Appendix G). They meet ADB\u2019s minimum standards. \n \n109.  A  financial  analysis  of  the  CFL  project  was  carried  out  following  ADB  guidelines \n(Appendix  9).  Financial  viability  was  gauged  by  comparing  incremental  costs  and  benefits  of \n\u201cwith-project\u201d  and  \u201cwithout-project\u201d  scenarios.  All  financial  costs  and  benefits  are  expressed  at \nconstant 2009 prices. Cost streams were used to determine the financial internal rate of return. \nThe current generation tariff (February 2009) was used to calculate savings resulting from less \nelectricity sold at below-cost rates to subsidized low-income customers, and the benefit gained \nby selling energy saved to retail customers above cost (in accordance with the overall customer \nsales  profile).  A  combined  preliminary  financial  internal  rate  of  return  estimate  of  97%  is \nrecorded.  \n \nD. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n110.  The  projects  to  be  financed  under  the  Investment  Program  are  part  of  Pakistan\u2019s \nintegrated energy efficiency investment plan. They constitute a key component of the planned \nmarket  transformation and  deployment  of  energy-efficient technologies.  The economic  internal \nrate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  projects  was  determined  assuming  an  economic  discount  rate  of \n12%, exchange rate of PRs 80 = $1, and an oil price of $50 per barrel. Society\u2019s willingness to \npay was taken as the economic price of electricity, and is calculated at PRs 6.06 per kilowatt-\nhour.  Natural  gas  is  priced  at  the  economic  price  of  imported  liquefied  natural  gas  for  the \ndomestic  and  commercial  sectors,  and  at  fuel  oil  prices  for  the  industry  sector.  The  border \nprices  of  petroleum  products  in  the  country  are  linked  directly  to  international  crude  oil  prices. \nThe  market  price  of  indigenous  and  imported  coal  is  adjusted  for  sales  tax  to  arrive  at  the \neconomic  price  of  coal.  The  total  program  cost  is  estimated  at  $1,180  million.  After  valuing \nenergy  benefits  at  their  economic  price,  the  aggregated  EIRR  for  the  six  components  is \nestimated to be 66%. A summary of the economic analysis is provided in Appendix 10.  \n \n111.  The  EIRR  of  the  CFL  project  is  calculated  at  145%,  reflective  of  the  relatively  short \nperiod in which investment in a CFL can be recovered. \n \n112.  Sensitivity  of  project  economics  to  changes  in  key  variables  was  tested.  The  EIRR  is \nobserved to be sensitive to the variables evaluated, but exceeds the economic hurdle rate for all \nsensitivities  tested,  including  the  multiple  downside  (combined)  scenario.  On  this  basis,  the \nprojects appear to be economically viable.  \n  \nE. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\n113.  The Investment Program\u2019s environmental and social safeguards evaluation is in Appendix \n11. An environmental assessment and review framework is in place (Supplementary Appendix H). \nIt  complies  with  the  Pakistan  Environmental  Protection  Act,  1997,  and  associated  rules, \nregulations,  and  guidelines;  and  is  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  The  CFL  project  falls  under  category  B  and  a \nsummary  initial  environmental  examination  is  included  in  Supplementary  Appendix  I.  No \nsignificant adverse impact is expected. No activities are planned in an environmentally sensitive or \nprotected areas. Provision for lamp waste management capacities is included in the Investment \nProgram Management Support Project. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23\n\n \n114.  Environmental  assessment  for  investments  packaged  under  future  tranches  will  be \nconducted within the agreed framework and ADB rules.  \n \nF. \n\nClean Development Mechanism Aspects \n\n115.  The  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM),  established  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  and \nmanaged  by  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change,  will  provide \nadditional financing to support the development of energy-efficient projects. The projects under \nthe Investment Program are likely to be eligible for carbon financing. CDM assessment details \nare in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \n116.  Estimates  of  carbon  emission  reduction  potential  are  based  on  available  CDM \nmethodology.  Emission  reduction  under  the  CFL  project  is  estimated  at  approximately \n1,260,000 tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) up to 2012. At a conservative price of $10 per tCO2e, \nthis could generate revenues of about $12.6 million for the CFL project up to 2012. ADB\u2019s Asia \nPacific Carbon Fund could purchase up to 50% of certified emission reductions up front. \n \n117.  After  2012,  emission  reduction  is  estimated  at  approximately  4,100,000  tCO2e,  which \nmay amount to about $20.5 million (assuming a conservative price of $5 per tCO2e). This could \nbe purchased by ADB\u2019s Future Carbon Fund.  \n\u00a0\nG. \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\n118.  The  CFL  project  does  not  entail  land  acquisition  or  economic  or  physical  resettlement. \nTherefore, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) is not triggered nor it will be triggered \nin future tranches. No components of the present or future tranches are planned in tribal areas \nof the North-West Frontier Province, which has formally identified indigenous people. Therefore, \nthe Investment Program will not trigger ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \nH. \n\nPoverty and Social Assessment \n\n119.  The  energy  savings  will  contribute  to  increased  and  reliable  energy  supply  to  various \nsectors.  Poor  and  marginalized  populations  are  often  among  the  hardest  hit  by  energy \nshortages.  The  load-shedding  resorted  to  by  electrical  utilities  is  far  greater  in  rural  areas. \nAccess to and affordability of modern energy services is also the lowest among the poor. These \npopulation segments are therefore expected to benefit from the energy savings, both in terms of \nassociated costs as well as excess supplies made available to service their requirements.  \n \n120.  The CFL project is designed to benefit households by providing them with CFLs at the \ncost  of  incandescent  bulb  replacement.  This  will  reduce  their  monthly  energy  bills.  Similar \nbenefits  will  accrue  from  replacement  of  domestic  gas  appliances,  including  water  heaters, \nspace heaters, and gas stoves.  \n \n121.  The expected twofold increase in the use of CFLs by low-income (lifeline) customers will \nresult  in  lower  monthly  electricity  bills  over  the  7.8-year  expected  lamp  lifetime.  For  end-user \nhouseholds,  as  much  as  $803  million  could  be  saved  in  electricity  use  over  the  life  of  the  \n30 million CFLs. This translates to an average of PRs293 in annual electricity cost savings per \nincandescent bulb\u2013CFL replacement for each household. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn addition, poor households will learn about other affordable energy-efficient choices for \n122. \nreducing household energy bills through awareness building. Improved electricity supplies to the \npoor  will  directly  contribute  to  increased  economic  opportunities  and  social  service  delivery  to \nthem. More reliable energy supplies and the resulting sustained economic activity, in particular \nin the industry sector, will generate indirect benefits in terms of employment and increased labor \nproductivity and incomes. \n \n123.  Reduced  energy  demand  resulting  from  efficient  energy  use  across  the  economy  will \nreduce  the  large  financial  outlays  that  would  otherwise  be  required  for  developing  additional \nenergy capacity and related infrastructure in the future, thereby saving public funds that could, \ninstead,  be  directed  toward  much-needed  social  development  requirements.  A  secure  and \npredictable electricity supply will lead to social and economic benefits; and improved conditions \nfor schools, hospitals, and other social services. \n \nI. \n\nGender Aspects \n\n124.  The  Investment  Program  will  support  gender  mainstreaming  into  the  integrated  energy \npolicy. The road map provides specific measures to allow the needs of both men and women to \nbe considered in all planning and policy making. For the most part, policy makers in Pakistan do \nnot  take  into  account  the  differences  between  men  and  women  relating  to  distribution  of,  and \ndecision making over, energy services. As a result, policies generally do not recognize a gender \nbias  in  energy  services,  and  women\u2019s  energy  needs  tend  to  be  marginalized  in  policy \ndocuments. \n \n125.  Policy  makers  need  to  become  aware  that  gender-neutral  energy  planning  misses \nimportant  issues  and  inadvertently  discriminates,  usually  against  women.  A  gender-sensitive \nenergy  policy  would  recognize  that  women  and  men  have  different  energy  needs  due  to  their \ndiffering household roles, response to crises, and coping mechanisms; and would offer energy \ntechnologies and services that match those needs.  \n \n126.  A gender-sensitive energy policy involves more than the creation of a gender-sensitive \nset of energy-related goals. The actual process of policy formulation and implementation needs \nto  be  gender-sensitive.  In  Pakistan,  the  energy  sector  is  male-dominated,  particularly  in  the \nprofessional  posts;  as  a  result,  issues  identified  and  solutions  offered  often  have  a  male  bias. \nIncreased participation of women in the sector and improvement of their status relative to men \ncan help to incorporate gender as an integral part of energy policies and practices, although it \nwill  not  guarantee  the  adoption  of  gender-sensitive  policy  goals.  Engagement  of  women\u2019s \ngroups  may  be  important  for  incorporating  gender  issues  into  energy  policies.  A  shift  to  a \ndemand-side  approach,  which  looks  at  energy  as  an  aspect  of  the  social  and  cultural  setting, \n(rather  than  the  traditional  supply-side  approach,  which  focuses  primarily  on  technological \nsolutions) would contribute to more effectively addressing gender-related energy needs. \n \nJ. \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n127.  Lack  of  progress  with  reforms,  a  deterioration  in  the  macroeconomic  situation, \nweaknesses in financial management, and institutional ineffectiveness are potential macro risk \nfactors.  These  are  mitigated  by  a  commitment  of  the  present  Government  to  continue  with \nreforms, the economic stabilization program supported by the International Monetary Fund, and \nongoing  and  planned  measures  to  improve  transparency  and  accountability  of  financial \nmanagement systems. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n25\n\n128.  The key assumption made in designing the Investment Program is that the Government \nexecutes  the  energy  efficiency  sector  road  map,  successfully  combining  physical  and \nnonphysical investments. \n \n129.  Technical  risks  for  energy  efficiency  projects  are  assessed  as  relatively  low.  However, \nsuch projects can be successful only if the underlying incentives of the regulatory framework are \nin place and correct. For this, the political commitment and policy framework are critical. \n \n130.  The  Investment  Program  needs  good  institutions  and  strong  management  and \ngovernance.  Good  planning,  best  practice  concepts,  sound  project  management,  fiduciary \noversight,  and  transparent  bidding  and  contract  management  processes  require  not  only \nexperienced  personnel,  but  also  efficient  and  effective  systems,  procedures,  and  controls.  On \nthe  institutional  front,  considerable  hope  is  placed  on  the  Planning  Commission's  ability  to \nmanage the road map and the Investment Program. At the project level, utilities need to have \nadequate  capacity  to  manage  the  investments.  Project  management  capacity  of  utilities  is \naddressed  under  other  ADB  interventions,  and  the  Investment  Program  will  provide  required \nadvisory services to prepare and implement specific projects. \n \n131.  The  Planning  Commission  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  energy-efficiency \npolicy  and  associated  investment  projects.  A  dedicated  PMO  will  support  the  Planning \nCommission.  The  functions  and  facilities  of  the  National  Energy  Conservation  Centre  will  be \nrealigned  into  the  Planning  Commission.  Stakeholder  consultations  will  be  done  at  the \nGovernment\u2019s EECCG.  \n \n132.  A  risk  management  framework  will  be  prepared  for  each  project.  Projects  will  be \nsubjected to project readiness filters. Simple project designs will be conscientiously applied, and \nactive due diligence will help avoid quality gaps and start-up delays. Contracts will be bundled \ninto large packages. ADB will monitor the program through the Pakistan Resident Mission, with \nsupport from the energy team at ADB headquarters. \n \n133.  The  CFL  project  has  some  risks:  (i)  timely  procurement  of  CFLs  and  their  distribution \nwithout  any  leakage  to  the  commercial  market;  (ii)  capacity  of  DISCOs  to  undertake  timely \ndistribution of  CFLs,  and  (iii)  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  implement  and  enforce  strict  controls \non energy-efficiency testing and labeling of CFLs.  \n \n134.  These risks will be mitigated by ensuring (i) the use of international energy performance \nstandards  and  international  competitive  bidding  for  the  bulk  procurement  of  CFLs;  (ii)  that \ndistribution of CFLs to customers is done at customer homes; (iii) that each CFL will be clearly \nmarked \u201cnot for sale;\u201d and (iv) that suppliers deliver the CFLs directly to the DISCO distribution \npoints. Customers will receive voucher(s) as part of their electricity bill and be made aware of \nthe free distribution via saturation media communication and social mobilization campaign.  \n \n135.  Appropriate  monitoring  mechanisms  for  effective  distribution  and  reporting  of  the  CFL \nlogistics  and  transactions  will  be  developed.  All  relevant  stakeholders  will  be  invited  to \nparticipate  in  developing  the  proposed  CFL  and  voucher  distribution  mechanism.  The \nmechanism  will  be  optimized  during  implementation  of  the  first  procurement  and  distribution \nphase.  Lessons  from  the  distribution  of  the  first  phase  will  be  incorporated  in  the  subsequent \nphase. \n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n136. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  the  following \nassurances, which have been largely incorporated into the FFA presented to the Board and will \nbe  incorporated,  as  appropriate,  into  the  legal  documents  for  projects  financed  under  the \nInvestment Program.  \n \n137.  Policy  Dialogue.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  ADB  is  kept  informed  about  the \nGovernment\u2019s  policies  and  programs  related  to  the  energy  sector  that  will  affect  the \nperformance  and  financial  viability  of  each  project  under  the  Investment  Program;  and,  in \nparticular,  policies  and  regulations  relevant  to  energy  supply,  pricing,  use,  and  efficiency.  The \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  there  will  be  an  exclusive  onlending  policy  for  projects  financed \nunder this Investment Program. \n \n138.  Counterpart  Funding.  The  Government  will  ensure,  and  cause  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies to ensure, the availability and timely release of counterpart funding for \nthe implementation of projects financed under the Investment Program. \n \n139.  Financial  Performance.  Where  applicable  and  required  by  ADB,  the  Government  will \nensure that each implementing agency maintains a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2 \nfrom 2 years onward after the effectiveness of relevant tranche, and a self-financing ratio of at \nleast 20% from 1 year onward after the effectiveness of relevant tranche. \n \n140.  Financial  Autonomy.  The  Government  will  ensure \nthat  all  government-paying \nauthorities provide prompt payment to the implementing agencies, and in case of any shortfall \nfrom the paying authority, the Government finances such a shortfall in a timely manner. \n \n141.  Auditing  and  Accounting.

The  country  needs  to  embark  on  a  determined  and  sustained  long-\nterm plan to optimize the energy mix and its use across all sectors of the economy.1  \n \n2. \nImproving energy efficiency and energy productivity are key components of the energy \npolicy  and  energy  security  strategy  of  Pakistan.  These  will  reduce  unproductive  and  volatile \ndemand  and  result  in  energy  savings.  Lower  energy  intensity  will  boost  energy  access,  help \nmeet  national  social  development  goals,  and  reduce  environmental  degradation  and  carbon \nemissions. An \u201cenergy-productive\u201d Pakistan will be more competitive in the global economy. \n \n3. \nThe  Government  of  Pakistan  is  committed  to  resolving  the  energy  crisis  and  achieving \nenergy  security  for  the  country.  This  will  require  sound  leadership,  sustained  political  and \nfinancial  commitment,  and  a  clear  vision  and  strategy  from  the  Government  for  implementing \nand  mainstreaming  energy  efficiency  and  energy  conservation  actions  in  all  major  energy-\nconsuming  sectors  and  markets.  The  Government  adopted  the  energy  efficiency  sector  road \nmap and an associate investment program. The road map comprises a series of correlated and \nsequential policy, regulatory, and institutional measures and capital investments aimed to \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nestablish a dynamic business environment for the sustained transformation of the \nenergy efficiency market2 in Pakistan; and \nscale  up  deployment  of  proven  technologies  through  public  investments  in  all \nmajor energy-consuming sectors and markets (industry, transportation, domestic \nand  commercial  buildings,  and  agriculture)  as  well  as  the  energy  supply  chain \n(energy production, generation, transformation, transmission, and distribution). \n\n \nThe  road  map  (detailed  version  in  Supplementary  Appendix  K)  defines  the  overall \n4. \napproach,  elements,  impacts,  and  timelines  necessary  under  which  the  respective  roles  of  all \nrelevant stakeholders can be coordinated, sequenced, financed, implemented, and monitored. It \nis  complemented  by  the  Energy  Efficiency  Sector  Investment  Program,  which  presents  a \nquantitative  assessment  of  the  national  energy  efficiency  savings  potential  and  investment \nrequirements,  economic  benefit  analysis,  and  detailed  project  and  activity  design  and  costing. \nThe Investment Program is the first such comprehensive analysis of the energy efficiency and \nenergy  productivity  improvements  that  are  based  on  existing  technologies.  The  Investment \nProgram is presented in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  Growing energy needs, coupled with insufficient supply and transformation capacity, are leading to severe deficits \nof electricity and natural gas and escalating fuel imports. This seriously impedes economic activity and growth, and \nstrains  the  balance-of-payments  position  of  the  country.  The  majority  of  the  population  are  being  denied  basic \nenergy services on a reliable and affordable basis, resulting in social disruption. \n\n2  Pakistan has a large untapped energy efficiency market. Past efforts to mainstream and develop energy efficiency \nprojects  have  largely  failed  due  to  unavailability  of  financing.  Expanding  the  energy  efficiency  market  requires \npolicy and financial incentives, including demonstrable benefits and market prospects.  \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nTable A2:

The Government of Pakistan is sponsoring this project. It will be implemented jointly \nby the eight power distribution companies (DISCOs) and the Karachi Electric Supply Company \n(KESC)  over  28  months  with  two  procurement  and  distribution  phases.  The  $85  million  CFL \nproject  will  reduce  peak  demand  by  1,094  megawatts  (MW);  avoid  1,602  MW  in  generating \ncapacity  additions,  corresponding  to  $1.84  billion  in  new  generation  investments;  save \n$800 million in household electricity expenses; result in 2,132 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of annual \nelectricity consumption reductions; avoid 7 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by the \nend of 2018, and accelerate the transformation of the incandescent bulb market to high-quality \nCFLs.  The  $25  million  Investment  Program  Management  Support  Project  will  enable \nincandescent bulb phaseout, as well as build institutional capacities for the adoption of energy \nperformance standards, testing of CFLs and other appliances, and lamp waste management. \n\nBackground \n\nA.  \n \n2. \nSince 2006, electricity demand in Pakistan has greatly outstripped available generation \ncapacity. The resulting load shedding and power outages caused street protests in many cities \nin  early  2009.  Businesses  have  gone  on  strike  to  protest  the  worsening  electricity  supply \nproblem. In July 2009 the country faced power shortages of approximately 5,000 MW. Demand \nis  expected  to  exceed  supply  by  more  than  5,500  MW  in  2010.  The  present  electricity  supply \nshortfall, coupled with consistent growth in demand (7%\u20138% per annum), clearly indicates the \ncritical need for enhancing the country\u2019s current power generation capability as well as curtailing \nunnecessary consumption. \n\nThe  August  2008  and  January  2009  average  daily  load  curves  show  peak  demand \n3. \nstarting  at  5:00  p.m.  in  winter  and  8:00  p.m.  in  summer  and  lasting  approximately  5 hours  in \nboth  cases  (Figure  A4.2).  Household  lighting  represents  a  significant  portion  of  this  evening \npeak. An energy-efficient lighting project could have a significant impact on reducing the peak \nand avoiding load shedding. \n\n4. \nInternational  experience  shows  that  among  all  potential  energy  efficiency  projects,  one \nof the most effective short-term approaches is the scaled-up replacement of incandescent bulbs \nwith CFLs in the residential sector. In the longer term, the project should seek to transform the \ndomestic  lighting  market  so  that  incandescent  bulbs  and  other  low-efficiency  lighting \ntechnologies are no longer used. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nB.  \n \n5. \nA baseline survey involving 3,253 domestic customers of eight DISCOs and KESC was \nperformed  in  April  2009  to  support  the  design  of  this  project  (Supplementary  Appendix  L).1 \nUsing  the  domestic  customer  distribution  patterns  of  the  nine  utilities  across  the  different \nconsumption  tiers,  the  survey  estimates  that  the  37.1  million  incandescent  bulb  light  points  in \nthe 40\u2013100 W range of domestic consumers contribute at least 2,028 MW to the system peak \nduring  evening  hours.  These  incandescent  bulb  light  points  in  households  are  consuming  as \nmuch as 3,952 GWh annually. \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2008.  Technical  Assistance  to  Pakistan  for  Preparing  the  Sustainable  Energy  Efficiency  Development \n\nProgram. Manila (TA 7060-PAK). \n\n \n\n\fTable A4.1 shows that 76.9% of electrified households in Pakistan still have at least one \n6. \nincandescent bulb. The table also shows a significant market penetration of CFLs in this sector. \n\nAppendix 4   \n\n41\n\nTable A4.1: Household Penetration of Lighting Technologies \n\nLighting Technology \nIncandescent Bulb \nCompact Fluorescent Lamp \nFluorescent Tube Lamp \nOther \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nHousehold Penetration (%) \n76.9 \n63.9 \n48.6 \n3.6 \n\nCurrent CFL and incandescent bulb utilization varies by consumer category. As part of \n7. \nthe  market  survey,  data  was  collected  to  verify  customer  choices  of  lighting  technology.  Data \nfrom  the  baseline  survey  illustrate  incandescent  bulb  and  CFL  use  across  five  monthly \nconsumption categories: (i) up to 50 kilowatt-hours (kWh), (ii) 51\u2013100 kWh, (iii) 101\u2013300 kWh, \n(iv) 301\u20131,000 kWh, and (v) above 1,000 kWh (Figure A4.1).  \n\nFigure A4.1: Incandescent Bulb and CFL Penetration in Pakistan  \nby Domestic Customer Category, 2009 \n\n100%\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n0%\n\ni\n\ni\n\ns\nt\nn\no\np\nt\nh\ng\nL\n \nf\no\n \ne\ng\na\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n\n48.8%\n\n48.0%\n\n34.0%\n\n33.1%\n\n27.9%\n\n23.7%\n\n5.9%\n\n63.6%\n\n45.1%\n\n46.8%\n\nIB Utilization (Cumulative)\n\nCFL Utilization\n\nUpto 50 \n\n51-100\n\n101-300\n\n301-1,000\n\nAbove 1,000\n\nCFL = compact fluorescent lamp, IB = incandescent bulb, kWh = kilowatt hour.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Pakistan Electric Power Company estimates. \n\nCustomer Category Based on kWh/Month  Usage \n\n \n\n8. \nFigure  A4.1  shows  that  consumers  with  lower  monthly  consumption  use  more \nincandescent  bulbs.  Alternatively,  the  lower  the  kWh  usage,  the  lower  the  percentage  of  CFL \nlight  points. In  other  words,  lifeliners  (customers  using  less than  50  kWh  per  month)  have  the \nhighest  percentage  of  incandescent  bulb  incidence  and  use,  while  consumers  with  more  than \n1,000  kWh  use  the  lowest  percentage.  Thus,  a  CFL  project  will  help  proportionately  more \ncustomers in the lower-income brackets to acquire energy-saving CFLs. \n\n9. \nThe  project  is  designed  to  replace  the  maximum  number  of  incandescent  bulbs  in  the \nresidential market by replacing 40 watt (W), 60 W, and 100 W incandescent bulbs with 20\u201323W \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nItem \n\nNo. of Households per \nCategorya \n\nAverage No. of Light \nPoints per Householdb \n\nTotal Light Pointsc \n\nNo. of Incandescent \nBulb Light Points  \n(5\u2013200 W)c  \n\nTotal Project Available \nIncandescent Bulbs \n(40 W + 60 W + 100 W) \n\nTarget Incandescent \nBulbs to be Replaced \n(phases 1 and 2)d  \n\nTarget Incandescent \nBulbs (phase 1)d \n\nTarget Incandescent \nBulbs (phase 2)d \n\nCFLs.

Any  remaining  CFLs  not  distributed  after  that \ncan  also  be  used  to  upgrade  lighting  in  government  buildings,  or  distributed  to  customers \nconnected to other bulk redistributors of electricity or to off-grid consumers. \n\nImpact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nC.  \n \n11. \nThe  CFL  project  will  contribute  immensely  to  the  Investment  Program\u2019s  objective  of \nclosing the current energy demand and supply imbalance by reducing peak demand through the \nmassive  replacement  of  30  million  light  points  in  grid-connected  households  with  a  more \nenergy-efficient lighting technology. The bulk distribution of CFLs will defer new investments for \npeaking generating capacities, generate electricity savings, avoid CO2 emissions, and advance \nCFL market transformation in the domestic sector. The design and monitoring framework for the \nCFL project is in Appendix 1. \n\n12. \nPeak  Demand  Reduction  and  Avoided  Peak  Generation  Capacities.  Average  daily \nand hourly electricity demand in Pakistan varies by season. Lighting demand is affected by the \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4   \n\n43\n\ntime  of  sunset.  With  darkness  coming  earlier  in  the  day  during  winter  months,  the  evening \nlighting  load  is  higher  than  in  summer  months.  Mainly  due  to  lighting  load,  the  National \nTransmission  and  Despatch  Company\u2019s  system  peak  starts  at  around  8:00  p.m.  during \nsummers and 5:00 p.m. during winters. The peak lasts for an average of 5 hours in all seasons, \ncorresponding to the peak time of typical household activities. \n\n13. \nTo assess the impact of CFL replacement, data for two peak months was analyzed, with \nAugust  representing  the  summer  season  and  January  representing  winter.  The  average  daily \nload curves for August 2008 and January 2009 were used. Based on these data, the average \npeak  demand  over  the  daily  base  demand  is  projected  to  be  2,468  MW  during  summer  and \n2,027 MW during winter in FY2010, mainly contributed to by lighting loads. The projected peak \ndemand rise for FY2011 is 2,662 MW for the summer and 2,178 MW for the winter. \n\n14. \nThe domestic sector connected  to the grid is estimated to have about 41.78  million light \npoints presently fitted with incandescent bulbs. Under this project, 10 million incandescent bulbs in \nthe 40\u2013100 W range will be replaced in 2010 (phase 1) and another 20 million in 2011 (phase 2). \nThe total peak demand of incandescent bulbs is estimated to be 3,166 MW in the country, across \nall  wattages  and  assuming  100%  peak  use  coincidence.  Conservatively,  this  reduces  to \n2,029 MW  for  incandescent  bulbs  in  the  40\u2013100  W  range,  at  66%  peak  coincidence.  The \nreplacement of 30 million incandescent bulbs with CFLs, having average consumption of 21.5 W \nper lamp, will result in an estimated reduction of peak demand by about 1,094 MW (at 66% peak \ncoincidence). The peak demand reduction is estimated to be 365 MW for phase 1 and 729 MW \nfor phase 2. This translates into a 53.9% peak demand reduction from the total incandescent bulb \nload of 2,028 MW after phase 2. Considering upstream losses and reserve margin requirements, \nthe project is capable of avoiding $1.84 billion in investments for 1,602 MW in new installed peak \ngeneration capacities. Figure A4.2 shows the impact of the CFL replacement project on the daily \npeak after phase 2. \n\nFigure A4.2: Impact of CFL Distribution on National Daily Load Curve \n\n25,000\n\n20,000\n\n15,000\n\nW\nM\n\n10,000\n\n5,000\n\n0\n\nAverage Daily Summer Load (NTDC, Including Export to KESC), August\n\nAverage Daily Winter Load (NTDC, Including Export to KESC), January\n\nModified Average Daily Summer Load (NTDC, Including Export to KESC), August\n\nModified Average Daily Winter Load (NTDC, Including Export to KESC), January\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n\nHours\n\n \n\nCFL  =  compact  fluorescent  lamp,  KESC  =  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Corporation,  MW  = \nmegawatt, NTDC = National Transmission and Despatch Company. \nSources: Asian Development Bank (dashed curve) and NTDC (solid curve) estimates. \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n15. \nAnnual  Electricity  Savings  and  Avoided  CO2  Emissions.  The baseline survey shows \nthat 1,094 MW of demand reduction resulting from 30 million incandescent bulb replacements in \nthe  40\u2013100  W  range  applied  through  surveyed  daily  duties  (varying  per  DISCO,  averaging \n3.69 hours/day)  can  yield  annual  savings  amounting  to  2,132  GWh  per  year.  Using  accepted \nPakistan electricity grid emission factors, this translates to annual CO2 emissions of 7 million tons \nof CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) through the estimated 7.78-year CFL life (or until 2018). As much as \n$800 million could be saved by participating domestic customers over the life of the CFLs. This \ntranslates  to  an  average  PRs293  in  annual  electricity  cost  savings  per  incandescent  bulb\u2013CFL \nreplacement.  Furthermore,  the  CFL  project  is  able  to  reduce  cross-subsidies  across  domestic \nconsumption tiers by approximately $60 million annually. The project also allows the distribution \nutilities  to  sell  the  available  electricity  to  higher-earning  tariff  tiers  at  a  conservative  minimum  of \n$29 million per year. \n\n16. \nAcceleration  of  CFL  Market  Transformation.  Figures  A4.3  and  A4.4  illustrate  the \nproject\u2019s  impact  on  CFL  uptake  and  market  transformation.  Figure  A4.3  shows  current  CFL \nusage and incandescent bulb usage by customer class; and Figure A4.4 shows projected usage \nafter  phase  2.  Taken  together,  the  curves  show  a  gradual  increase  in  CFL  use  by  customers \nacross all consumption categories. For example, the use of CFLs by lifeliners (consumers using \nless  than  50  kWh  per  month),  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  the  total  lighting  points  used,  is \nexpected to increase from the current 34% of households to 74% after phase 2. \n\nFigure A4.3: Relative Penetration of Incandescent Bulbs and CFLs in Pakistan \nby Domestic Customer Categories in 2009 \n\nIB Utilization (Cumulative)\n\nCFL Utilization\n\n5.9%\n\n63.6%\n\n48.8%\n\n48.0%\n\n27.9%\n\n23.7%\n\n34.0%\n\n33.1%\n\n45.1%\n\n46.8%\n\nUpto 50 \n\n51-100\n\n101-300\n\n301-1,000\n\nAbove 1,000\n\nCustomer Category Based on kWh/Month  Usage \n\n \n\nCFL = compact fluorescent lamp, IB = incandescent bulb, kWh = kilowatt hour. \nSource: Asian Development Bank survey, April 2009. \n\n100%\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n0%\n\ni\n\ni\n\ns\nt\nn\no\np\nt\nh\ng\nL\n \nf\no\n \ne\ng\na\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n\n \n\n \n\n\fFigure A4.4: Relative Penetration of Incandescent Bulbs and CFLs in Pakistan  \nby Domestic Customer Categories After Phase 2 \n\nAppendix 4   \n\n45\n\n80%\n\n9%\n\n15%\n\n9%\n\n12%\n\n4%\n\nIB Utilization (Cumulative)\n\nCFL Utilization\n\n74%\n\n66%\n\n64%\n\n59%\n\n66%\n\n100%\n\ni\n\ni\n\ns\nt\nn\no\np\nt\nh\ng\nL\n \nf\no\n \ne\ng\na\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n0%\n\nUpto 50 \n\n51-100\n\n101-300\n\n301-1,000\n\nAbove 1,000\n\nCustomer Category Based on kWh/Month  Usage \n\n \n\nCFL = compact fluorescent lamp, IB = incandescent bulb, kWh = kilowatt hour. \nSource: Asian Development Bank survey, April 2009. \n\n \n\nThe  impact  on  all  customer  categories  is  detailed  in  Table  A4.3,  which  shows  CFL \n\n17. \npenetration increasing over time in each consumption class. \n\nTable A4.3: Baseline and Post-Project Domestic Sector CFL Penetration in Pakistan \n(%) \n\nCFL Use \nBaseline Situation \n\nAfter Project Phase 1 \n\nAfter Project Phase 2 \n\nUp to 50 \nkWh/month \n34 \n\n51\u2013100 \nkWh/month \n33 \n\n101\u2013300 \nkWh/month \n45 \n\n301\u20131,000 \nkWh/month \n47 \n\nAbove 1,000 \nkWh/month \n64 \n\n46 \n\n74 \n\n45 \n\n66 \n\n52 \n\n64 \n\n52 \n\n59 \n\n65 \n\n66 \n\nProject Design Features \n\nCFL = compact fluorescent lamp, kWh = kilowatt hour. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD.  \n \nThe  two  most  critical  features  of  the  CFL  project  design  are  (i)  the  technical \n18. \nspecifications  for  the  bulk  procurement  of  the  CFLs;  and,  (ii)  the  CFL  distribution  and \nincandescent bulb recovery mechanism.  \n\nCFL Specifications. For the bulk procurement of 20\u201323 W CFLs, current efficient lighting \n19. \ninitiative  (ELI)  technical  specifications  will  be  adopted  as  the  international  energy  performance \nstandard, with the exception of increasing the life rating of the procured CFLs from 6,000 hours to \n10,000 hours. As a result of the extended life rating, participating manufacturers will be required to \nextend  the  warranty  on  the  product  from  1  year  (as  per  ELI  requirement)  to  2  years.  The \nenhancement of the life specification is possible for three reasons: \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nA  10,000-hour  life  specification  allows  project  implementing  entities  to  increase \nthe  CFL  warranty  period  to  24  months.  Public  perception  of  the  project  is \nenhanced through reduced complaints of defective CFLs during implementation. \nThe  10,000-hour  specification \nincreases  potential  Clean  Development \nMechanism (CDM) revenues by extending the crediting period of CER revenues \n(in  this  case  it  will  be  beyond  2012)  to  at  least  7  years  versus  the  typical  3\u20134 \nyears for 6,000-hour CFLs. \nLonger-life CFLs reduce hazardous mercury waste by decreasing the frequency \nof CFL replacements at each light point. \n\n \n20. \nThe  recommended  minimum  efficacy  for  the  bulk-procured  CFLs  will  also  follow  ELI \nstandards  (57  lumens/W)  for  lamps  rated  15  W  and  higher.  The  light  output  of  a  1,350-lumen \n20\u201323 W CFL is expected to match or exceed the total rated luminous flux for a typical 100 W \nincandescent bulb in Pakistan (versus 1,240-lumen market average incandescent bulb luminous \nflux). \n\nBased on the baseline household survey, approximately 90% of the incandescent bulbs \n21. \nin domestic light points are fitted with bayonet B22 caps (locally referred to as \u201cpin-type\u201d), while \nthe small balance of incandescent bulbs were fitted with Edison screw E27 (and E14) caps. To \naddress  the  broader  and  immediate  incandescent  bulb  replacement  needs  of  the  domestic \nsector,  CFLs  to  be  procured  for  phase  1  will  be  fitted  with  B22  caps  only.  The  feasibility  of \nreplacing  E27-capped \nincandescent  bulbs  (for  specific  high-incidence  areas,  such  as \nIslamabad) will be studied during the evaluation of phase 1. \n\nAlso, bulk-procured CFLs will continue to use the international voluntary minimum power \n22. \nfactor  specification  of  0.5,  which  is  adopted  by  ELI,  US  Energy  Star,  EU  Quality  Charter  for \nCFLs,  and  even  the  proposed  Asia  CFL  Quality  Charter.  Completed  CFL  projects  in  other \ncountries show no clear evidence of adverse impacts of bulk distribution of normal power factor \n(i.e.,  at  least  0.5  power  factor)  CFLs  on  utility  operations.  While  agencies  in  at  least  two \ncountries are starting to require high-power factor CFLs for their programs, the minimal and still \nunverified benefits to the distribution system cannot justify the estimated 45% increase in CFL \nproduction  cost  to  raise  the  power  factor  to  0.8\u20130.9.  Furthermore,  a  fear  is  that  high-power \nfactor  CFLs  will  increase  vulnerability  to  wide  voltage  variations,  thereby  reducing  the  CFL \ncapacity to optimize its rated life. Furthermore, CDM-approved small-scale methodology AMS-\nII.J does not require high-power factor CFLs. \n\nCFL  Distribution  Mechanism.  The  CFL  project  is  aimed  at  the  replacement  of \n23. \n30 million incandescent bulbs in the 40\u2013100 W range with 20\u201323 W CFLs. If successful, the two \nphases  of  free  CFL  distribution  will  largely  eliminate  the  use  of  incandescent  bulbs  from  the \nresidential market. \n\n24. \nThe  CFLs  will  be  provided  to  domestic  customers  of  eight  DISCOs  and  KESC  free-of-\ncharge  over  2  years.  Typically,  CFL  giveaway  projects  do  not  recover  their  costs  directly. \nHowever, this project is projected to recover its costs through reduced subsidies to low-income \n\u201clifeline\u201d  customers.  The  higher  tariffs  paid  by  higher  electricity-consuming  households  to \nsupport  low-income  consumers,  plus  the  direct  government  subsidies  paid  to  support  low-\nincome  consumers,  will  together  generate  a  revenue  surplus  because  low-income  consumers \nwill be consuming less electricity by using CFLs instead of incandescent bulbs. That surplus is \nprojected to cover the costs of the CFLs and project administration. Hence, the project, despite \npurchasing and giving away CFLs, will recover its costs in about a year. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4   \n\n47\n\nIn general, demand-side management programs can be broadly divided into two types: \n25. \n\u201copt-out\u201d  and  \u201copt-in\u201d  programs.  In  opt-out  programs,  the  customer  does  not  need  to  initiate  a \ntransaction to participate in the program, while for opt-in programs the customer has to initiate a \ncertain  activity  in  order  to  participate.  The  CFL  project  is  the  opt-out  program  type.  Opt-out \nprograms  typically  have  higher  participation  rates,  a  key  factor  for  the  swift  creation  of  virtual \ngenerating  capacities  in  the  grid.  Although  opt-out  programs  are  more  costly  and  need  more \ncoordination, the critical energy security objectives of the CFL project cannot afford the slower \nmarket response from a pure opt-in program. \n\nPEPCO  will  handle  activities  related  to  the  bulk  procurement  of  the  CFLs  through  the \n26. \ntwo phases on behalf of the Ministry of Water and Power, while the DISCOs and KESC express \nconfidence  that,  bolstered  with  supplemental  logistics  in  isolated  cases,  they  can  handle  the \ndistribution of the CFLs and the collection of incandescent bulbs and eligibility vouchers. Should \nsome of the DISCOs decide to subcontract the delivery to third-party service providers, the cost \nis  estimated  to  be  in  the  range  of  PRs30\u2013PRs40  per  delivered  CFL.  This  estimated  cost \nincludes the recovery and shipment of incandescent bulbs. \n\n27. \nIn  either  case,  the  DISCO  remains  the  responsible  party  for  distribution.  Completed \nutility-led  demand-side  management  programs  in  other  countries  demonstrate  the  advantages \nof enhancing the image of the utility with respect to its customers as well as optimizing program \nimpacts  and  sustainability  by  guarding  the  product  from  potential  fraud  or  diversion  to  other \nmarket channels. \n\n28.  More specific features of the distribution mechanism include the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nPEPCO will coordinate the project and conduct a bulk purchase of CFLs that are \ncompliant  with  predetermined  specifications.  Bulk  purchase  of  the  CFLs  will  be \nperformed  in  two  phases,  the  first  for  10  million  CFLs  and  the  second  to \npurchase 20 million CFLs. This is to help lower the unit cost of the lamps. \nPEPCO will distribute the CFLs to DISCOs and KESC. For each phase, PEPCO \nwill  assign  the  quantity  of  CFLs  to  be  delivered  to  each  utility  based  on  the \nrelative number of residential customers and the projected number of 40\u2013100 W \nincandescent  bulb  light  points  in  each  utility.  A  preliminary  estimate  of  the  CFL \nallocations  and  their  corresponding  peak  reduction  and  energy  saving  impacts \nare in Table A4.4. \nThe  DISCOs  and  KESC  will  mail  or  deliver  the  vouchers  to  all  of  their  active \nresidential  customers  along  with,  and  as  a  detachable  portion  of,  the  monthly \nutility bill. \nThe DISCOs and KESC will be responsible for distributing the CFLs to residential \ncustomers  door-to-door,  where  the  customer  will  trade  working  40\u2013100  W \nincandescent bulbs together with the previously mailed voucher with high-quality \nCFLs on a one-to-one swap basis. \nDepending  on  logistics  and  capacity  of  each  utility,  the  DISCOs  or  KESC  can \nchoose to use their own personnel or hire delivery subcontractors. \nRecovered  incandescent  bulbs  will  be  collected  in  utility  sites  for  third-party \nverification  before  disposal  and  recycling.  To  prevent  distribution  of  recovered \nincandescent bulbs back into the market, utility personnel should be required to \ndeform  the  metal  bayonet  cap  at  point-of-collection  with  special  care  not  to \ndamage the glass portion of the incandescent bulb. (The wattage marking on the \nglass portion provides future auditable basis of the baseline power rating of the \nincandescent bulb). After third party verification of incandescent bulb inventories, \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n(vii) \n\n \n\nDISCOs and KESC may destroy the incandescent bulbs, send incandescent bulb \nwaste  to  existing  material  recyclers,  and  collect  proceeds  of  the  sale  of  scrap \nmaterials.  \nThe DISCOs and KESC will perform an analysis of the redeemed vouchers at the \nend of each phase. \n\nTable A4.4: Preliminary Estimates of CFL Allocations and \nPeak Demand and Electricity Savings by DISCO \n\nNo. of \nDomestic \nCustomers \n(million) \n\nCFL Allocation (million) \n\nPeak Demand \nReduction \n(MW) \n\nAnnual Energy \nSavingsa \n(GWh/year)  \n\nPhase 1 \n\nPhase 2 \n\nTotal \n\n2.41 \n1.97 \n2.33 \n1.63 \n3.27 \n2.10 \n1.18 \n0.36 \n1.50 \n16.75 \n\nUtility \nLESCO \nGEPCO \nFESCO \nIESCO \nMEPCO \nPESCO \nHESCO \nQESCO \nKESC \nTotal \nCFL  =  compact  fluorescent  lamp,  DISCO  =  distribution  company,  FESCO  =  Faisalabad  Electric  Supply  Company, \nGEPCO  =  Gujranwala  Electric  Power  Company,  GWh  =  gigawatt-hour,  HESCO  =  Hyderabad  Electric  Supply \nCompany,  IESCO  =  Islamabad  Electric  Supply  Company,  KESC  =  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Corporation,  LESCO  = \nLahore Electric Supply Company, MEPCO = Multan Electric Power Company, MW = megawatt, PESCO = Peshawar \nElectric Supply Company, QESCO = Quetta Electric Supply Company. \na Energy savings are shown in terms of demand reduction; equivalent supply savings would be higher on account of \n\n324.7 \n281.7 \n211.2 \n71.0 \n458.6 \n325.2 \n175.6 \n53.8 \n229.9 \n2,131.6 \n\n162.5 \n129.4 \n115.8 \n57.7 \n224.3 \n175.2 \n93.4 \n28.4 \n107.2 \n1,093.9 \n\n4.3 \n3.5 \n4.2 \n2.9 \n5.9 \n3.8 \n2.1 \n0.6 \n2.7 \n30.0 \n\n2.9 \n2.3 \n2.8 \n1.9 \n4.0 \n2.5 \n1.4 \n0.4 \n1.8 \n20.0 \n\n1.4 \n1.2 \n1.4 \n1.0 \n1.9 \n1.3 \n0.7 \n0.2 \n0.9 \n10.0 \n\nT&D losses and reserve margin requirements. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n29. \nFigure  A4.5  illustrates  the  general  distribution  mechanism  of  the  CFL  project.  This \ndistribution  scheme,  devised  by  the  DISCOs  in  consultation  with  each  other  and  PEPCO, \noptimally utilizes their existing resources to minimize costs, while at the same time ensuring that \nnormal DISCO functions are not affected by the additional CFL distribution responsibilities. \n\n30. \nThe distribution mechanism calls for the supply of bulk consignments of CFLs allocated to \neach  DISCO  (Figure  A4.5)  in  containers  to  designated  regional  storage  points  operated  by  the \nDISCO. The number of these main supply storages and the corresponding CFL allocations will be \nspecified  in  the  CFL  bidding  documents  and  determined  on  the  CDM  program  of  activity \nrequirements. From these storage sites, CFLs will be delivered on a daily basis to the respective \nDISCO\u2019s subdivision field stores, utilizing mini trucks specifically procured by the DISCOs for this \npurpose.  Field  distribution  teams,  each  consisting  of  one  DISCO  employee  and  one  contracted \nhire, will then be provided with batch customer address lists for door-to-door delivery of the CFLs \nin  adjoining  areas  using  motorbikes  (with  modified  carrier  boxes)  purchased  by  the  DISCOs  for \neach team. The teams will exchange the CFLs for working incandescent bulbs (in the 40\u201360 W \nrange)  and  customer  vouchers  (provided  with  their  electricity  bills)  on  a  one-to-one  basis,  and \nreturn the incandescent bulbs and vouchers collected through the subdivision collection points up \nto  the  regional  storage  sites.  At  this  point,  on  a  regular  basis  and  in  the  presence  of  third-party \ninspectors, the incandescent bulb and voucher counts will be verified and the incandescent bulbs \ndestroyed.  The  collated  vouchers  will  then  be  dispatched  to  the  respective  DISCO\u2019s  customer \n\n \n\n\fdata  center  for  analysis.  The  DISCO\u2019s  existing  stores  and  inventory  system  will  be  utilized  for \nmaintaining proper accounting of the transactions and material movements involved at all stages. \n\nFigure A4.5: CFL Distribution and Incandescent Bulb Recovery Scheme \n\nAppendix 4   \n\n49\n\n \nAFD  =  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement,  CDM  =  Clean  Development  Mechanism,  CFL  = \ncompact fluorescent lamp, DISCO = distribution company, IB = incandescent bulb, ICB = international \ncompetitive bidding, PEPCO = Pakistan Electric Power Company, PDD = project design document. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n31. \nPEPCO  will  seek  and  obtain  Government  consent  for  hiring  contract  staff  required  to \nimplement  the  distribution  by  each  DISCO,  waive  standard  20%  storage  and  transportation \ncharges, and seek Government approval of the $20 million PC-1 required to implement the CFL \ndistribution  by  the  DISCOs.

Additionally,  project  monitoring  and \nevaluation (M&E) consultants will be recruited by the program management office (PMO) to lead \nthe monitoring, verification, and evaluation of both project distribution phases. The CFL project \nM&E services will be supported by a separate M&E budget under the support component of the \nInvestment  Program.  An  estimated  8  person-months  of  an  international  consultant  and \n118 person-months  of  national  consultants  will  be  required  to  provide  M&E  services  for  both \nphases.  All  international  and  national  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of \nreference  for  the  implementation  and  M&E  consultants  are  presented  in  Supplementary \nAppendix M. \n\n36. \nUnder the oversight provided by PMU established for the CFL project, each DISCO will \nestablish  project  implementation  cells  to  coordinate  and  manage  their  respective  project \nactivities, and to liaise with the project consultants, MOWP, and the Investment Program\u2019s PMU. \n\n37. \nThe  Investment  Program\u2019s  PMO  at  the  Planning  Commission  will  oversee  project \nexecution  and  coordinate  with  the  project  monitoring  and  evaluation  consultants,  who  will  be \nhired  specifically  for  this  purpose.  The  role  of  the  M&E  consultants  will  commence  with  the \ninitiation of the CFL procurement activities and continue until the end of the project. \n\n38. \nPEPCO will use international competitive bidding for both phases of CFL procurement, on \nbehalf  of  MOWP,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime  to  time).  For  purposes  of  procurement,  shipment  inspection,  and  distribution  to  the \ndistribution  utilities,  a  separate  procurement  committee  will  be  formed,  headed  by  MOWP  and \nPEPCO  and  with  representatives  from  all  DISCOs,  and  the  Investment  Program\u2019s  M&E  staff. \nEndorsement by the procurement committee will be required for the design of bidding documents \nand specifications, award of supply contracts, pre- and post-shipment inspection and quality tests, \nand allocation of CFL consignments to various DISCOs\u2019 regional distribution points. Spot checks \non the CFLs delivered at the port will be conducted by an independent accredited agency, such as \nthe Pakistan Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, contracted specifically for this purpose, \nusing predetermined sampling protocols. \n\n39. \nThe  utility-based  project  implementation  cells  will  be  responsible  for  the  design  and \nimplementation  of  their  respective  CFL  distribution  strategies;  mechanisms;  and  facilities, \nincluding measures for the recovery of incandescent bulbs, vouchers, and their accounting and \ntransportation  to  regional  collection  centers.  The  number  of  vouchers  and  incandescent  bulbs \ncollected by the utilities will be verified by PEPCO and project M&E staff before their destruction \nand disposal at predetermined locations. The printing, distribution, and redemption of vouchers \nwill be handled in a uniform manner by all utilities, as agreed upon at the project outset between \nPEPCO,  the  DISCOs,  KESC,  and  the  Investment  Program\u2019s  PMO.  Voucher  redemption \nanalysis will be carried out by each utility under supervision of PEPCO, project consultants, and \nM&E staff and consolidated into a central database accessible to all concerned entities. \n\nfor \n\nfirms \n\nAlso,  MOWP  through  PEPCO  will  separately  contract  with  one  or  more  prequalified \n40. \ncommunications \nthe  CFL  project \ncommunication (national tri-media publicity and social mobilization) campaigns.

The  effectiveness  of  the \ncommunications  strategy  will  be  gauged  during  and  after  each  phase  by  the  project  M&E \npersonnel via consumer surveys. \n\n41. \nBecause of the significant macroeconomic impacts anticipated from the CFL project, all \nrecruitment and procurement are proposed to be financed by the Government from the project \nloan proceeds.. \n\nAssessment of Clean Development Mechanism Potential \n\nG.  \n \n42. \nClean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM)  projects  are  expected  to  establish  a  baseline \nscenario, which would have prevailed had the CDM project not been undertaken. To do this, the \nCDM executive board has approved a range of approved methodologies from which the project \nparticipants should select the most appropriate for the scope of the project. If no methodology is \napproved that is directly applicable to the project, the project participants may propose either a \nnew methodology or request the revision of an existing approved methodology, which with some \nmodifications could be applied to the scope of the project. The CFL project falls under the sector \nscope  \u201c3:  Energy  Demand\u201d  as  defined  under  the  CDM  modalities  and  procedures.  Three \napproved CDM methodologies are available: one large-scale4 and two small-scale.5 Due to the \ncomplexity of monitoring requirements and limitation of applicability conditions, the small-scale \nmethodology AMS-II.J is considered the best suitable approved methodology for this project. \n\n43. \nApplicability conditions and other requirements of the AMS-II.J are checked against the \nproposed  mechanism  of  CFL  distribution.  The  AMS-II.J  requires  verification  of  recovered \nincandescent  bulb  wattages,  and  documentation  of  the  recovery  and  destruction  process  and \npost-project CFL installations, but does not require verification of actual CFL usage hours. Major \nCDM requirements of AMS-II.J are as follows: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nThe CFL distribution will be limited to residential customers. \nCFLs utilized under the project will, in addition to standard lamp specifications, be \nmarked for clear unique identification for the project. \nIncandescent bulbs will be returned, stored, and destroyed. \nThe project will undertake at least one of the following measures: \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n\ndirectly installing CFLs; \ncharging at least a minimal price for a CFL; and/or \nrestricting the number of CFLs per household distributed to six. \n\n(v)  Whether  the  CFLs  are  directly  installed  or  not,  the  project  design  document \n(PDD)  will  define  the  actions  to  be  taken  to  encourage  CFLs  being  installed  in \nlocations  within  residences  where  the  utilization  hours  are  relatively  high,  for \nexample  common  areas.  For  CFLs  not  directly  installed,  these  actions  can \ninclude educating the recipients of the CFLs. \n\n \n44. \nThe CDM project is expected to result in real measurable emission reductions that are \nadditional to any that may occur in its absence. In other words, the project participants have to \ndemonstrate  that  a  baseline  scenario  would  have  occurred  in  the  absence  of  the  project  with \nCDM benefits. In general, this is done by applying a tool for demonstration and assessment of \n\n                                                 \n4   AM0046: Distribution of efficient light bulbs to households (version 2). \n5   AMS-II.C:  Demand-side  energy  efficiency  activities  for  specific  technologies  (version  11)  and  AMS-II.J:  Demand-\n\nside activities for efficient lighting technologies (version 3). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4   \n\n53\n\nadditionality  that  has  been  approved  by  the  CDM  executive  board.  The  tool  provides  two \nalternate approaches\u2014investment analysis and barrier analysis. \n\n45. \nFor  this  program,  additionality  can  be  demonstrated  by  means  of  barrier  analysis.  For \nexample, while the project establishes a new business model of large-scale adoption of CFLs, \nDISCOs  have  no  prior  experience  in  massive  CFL  distribution  and  lacks  human  capacity  for \nsuch a demand-side management project. The project of this scale is the first of its kind in the \nworld.  DISCOs  inevitably  perceive  a  greater  risk  in  pioneering  a  business  model  that  has \nperformance uncertainty. This \u201clack of prevailing practice\u201d barrier makes the project unattractive \nto implement in the absence of the CDM. In terms of technology, the project represents the first \ncase  of  employing  the  10,000-hour  CFLs;  currently  no  10,000-hour  CFLs  are  available  in  the \nPakistan market. \n\n46. \nNo mandatory law or regulations prohibit the production and use of incandescent bulbs \nin Pakistan. Currently, the World Bank is planning to finance a 3 million CFL distribution project \nin four DISCOs. However, unlike the National CFL Project, the World Bank financed project will \ndistribute CFLs without the recovery of incandescent bulbs, and with fees charged to customers \nto recover CFL costs. Since the World Bank project is still at a planning stage and is expected to \ncommence distribution in 2011, it does not need to be considered for the additionality argument \nof this project. \n\n47. \nThe project participants are expected to have considered CDM seriously while taking the \ninvestment  decisions  for  the  project.  This  must  be  demonstrated  with  documentary  evidence. \nProjects  with  starting  dates  after  2  August  2008  must  inform  the  designated  national  authority \n(DNA)  and/or  UNFCCC  Secretariat  within  6  months  of  the  project  start  date,  with  the  precise \ngeographic location of the project. For project activities that started before 2 August 2008, the \nproject  documentation  must  indicate  awareness  of  the  CDM  prior  to  the  project  activity  start \ndate, and must show that the anticipated benefits of CDM were a decisive factor in the decision \nto proceed with the project. Evidence to support this would include minutes and/or notes related \nto  the  consideration  of  the  decision  by  the  board  of  directors,  or  equivalent,  of  the  project \nparticipant, to undertake the project as a CDM project activity. \n\nUnder  recently  elaborated  rules,  in  case  the  starting  date6 is  prior  to  the  beginning  of \n48. \nvalidation of the project, the project participants have to provide documentary evidence to show \nthat  they  were  aware  of  the  CDM  and  seriously  considered  CDM  registration  necessary  for \nimplementing the project. The starting date of the CFL project will be 3 March 2010; the contract \nwill be awarded according to the proposed schedule. \n\n49. \nBased  on  the  application  of  this  methodology,  the  CFL  project  is  likely  to  result  in \nemission  reductions  of  approximately  5,370,000  tCO2e  up  to  end  of  2012.  The  project  is \nexpected to generate approximately 1,260,000 tCO2e up to 31 December 2012. \n\n50. \nCDM is a performance-based mechanism, which means that CERs will only be issued if \nthey  are  properly  monitored,  verified,  and  certified  by  an  independent  agency  called  the \ndesignated operational entity. In this sense, the CDM can provide a good incentive to PEPCO \nand  the  DISCOs  to  keep  track  of  CFL  distribution  and  incandescent  bulb  collection  and \n\n                                                 \n6  As per the CDM glossary of terms, \u201cstarting date\u201d is defined as the earliest date at which either the implementation \nor construction or real action of a project activity begins. It is the date in which the project participant has committed \nto expenditures related to the implementation or related to the construction of the project activity. This, for example, \ncan  be  the  date  on  which  contracts  have  been  signed  for  equipment  or  construction  and  operation  services \nrequired for the project activity (para. 67, EB 41 report). \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nscrapping, and also to maintain proper records, ensuring that no theft or leakage occurs in the \ncourse of CFL distribution. The project will have to establish an operation and monitoring plan, \nas required by the approved methodology applied. This plan will be defined in the PDD, which \nmust be validated by the designated operational entity. \n\n51. \nPEPCO  will  coordinate  and  manage  the  program  of  activities.  Nine  or  more  small-scale \nCDM program activities  will  be implemented in geographically distinct  areas across  Pakistan  by \ndifferent  distribution  utilities.  The  total  number  of  CDM  program  activities  will  be  optimally \ndetermined in line with the specified ceiling of 60 GWh/year electricity savings eligible for CERs in \neach program of activities to maximize potential CDM revenues. PEPCO will be in charge of the \noverall  planning and  management  of the  project, including monitoring. CFL distribution  will be a \njoint  exercise  with  PEPCO,  the  DISCOs,  and  possibly  other  downstream  distributors.  A  CDM \nproject management unit will be created, chaired by PEPCO staff and comprising representatives \nfrom  the  DISCOs.  Complete  conformance  to  the  PDD  monitoring  plan  will  be  maintained  and \nmonitored  by  the  CDM  project  management  unit.  PEPCO  will  ensure  establishment  of  all \nprocedures,  databases,  and  infrastructure  for  the  smooth  rollout  of  the  CFL  distribution  in \nexchange for eligible incandescent bulbs. It will also ensure high conformance to all procedures \nfor  monitoring,  to  ensure  the  integrity  of  data  and  quality  of  verification  reports.  Furthermore, \nPEPCO  will  provide  support  during  the  entire  program  by  way  of  consumer  database  sharing, \nsample group formation for post-implementation survey, and other means. \n\n52. \nThe management systems and procedures to be implemented by PEPCO upon project \nimplementation  will  be  done  to  ensure  consistent  project  procedures  as  well  as  monitoring, \nprocessing, and reporting of data required for the calculation of emission reductions. In addition \nto the monitoring plan, a project database will be established. All data collected will be fed into \nthe  database.  All  required  calculations  will  be  performed  within  the  project  database.  PEPCO \nwill organize all requirements and supervise all involved bodies. PEPCO will determine the start \ndate  as  well  as  the  end  date  of  each  monitoring  interval.  The  power  rating  of  the  replaced \nincandescent bulbs, derived from the lamp marking, will be recorded.  \n\n53. \nTo  ensure  reliable  and  transparent  data  collection,  PEPCO  will  prepare  a  project \nimplementation  handbook  before  the  start  of  the  distribution,  including  detailed  procedures, \ninstructions,  and  data  forms  that  are  to  be  used  to  document  all  procedures  undertaken  and \nrequired for project implementation, and data collection and protocols, which are to be applied \nto ensure high quality assurance. \n\nCDM  development  has  transaction  costs  at  various  stages,  starting  with  PDD \n54. \npreparation, which requires consultant time. In some countries, the DNA charges fees for host \ncountry  approval.  In  Pakistan,  the  fees  are  zero.  For  validation  of  the  project  the  third-party-\ndesignated  operational  entity  charges  fees,  which  vary  according  to  the  complexities  in  the \nproject. The CFL project will require about $300,000\u2013$600,000 for validation. Depending on the \namount of CERs generated by a CDM project annually, registration fees have to be paid to the \nUNFCCC  Secretariat.  Based  on  the  CER  potential  of  the  CFL  project,  a  registration  fee  of \n$2,500 is expected to be levied. \n\n55. \nOnce  implemented,  the  project  participants  will  have  to  monitor  the  parameters  as \nrequired  by  the  CDM  methodology  being  utilized.  The  monitoring  cost  will  depend  on  the \nrequired  instrumentation  and  skill  of  the  monitors.  The  CFL  project  will  internalize  the  cost  of \nmonitoring or hiring of an independent agency to monitor the project. The project operation and \nthe  monitoring  report  prepared  by  the  project  entity  will  be  verified  by  either  the  same \ndesignated  operational  entity  that  validated  the  project  (for  small-scale  CDM  projects)  or  by \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4   \n\n55\n\nanother designated operational entity (for normal-scale CDM project) before being certified. The \ndesignated operational entity will charge a fee for each verification. \n\nTable A4.8: Schedule of Estimated Costs for the CDM Process \n\nCDM Process \n\nBudgetary Cost \n\nAssumptions \n\nPDD Preparation for Program \nof Activities: PDD, standard \nCPA-PDD, and approximately \n38 CPA-PDDs  \nHost Country Approval \nValidation \nRegistration \nMonitoring \nVerification and Certification \nShare of Proceeds (SOP): \nAdministration \nSOP: Adaptation \nTotal \n\n$400,000\u2013$500,000 \n\nZero \n$300,000\u2013$600,000 \n$2,500 \nInternalized \n$400,000\u2013$800,000 \n$1,070,000 \n\nIncluding PDD preparation, consultancy \nservices during CDM process, CDM \ntraining, support of CDM database \nconstruction \n \n \nBased on 20,000 tCO2e \n \n$50,000\u2013$100,000 per year x 8 years \nBased on 5,350,000 tCO2e \n\n2% of issued CERs \nApproximately \n$2 million\u2013$3 million \n\n \n \n\nCDM = clean development mechanism, CER = certified emission reduction, CPA = CDM program of activities, PDD = \nproject design document, SOP = share of proceeds, tCO2e = ton of carbon dioxide equivalent. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n56. \nThe  Implementing  Agency  (or  the  project  participant)  will  generally  enter  into  a  CER \npurchase agreement (CERPA) with a buyer at an appropriate stage of processing. The price of \nCERs  contracted  will  normally  be  stated  in  the  CERPA  or  be  set  by  spot  market  CER  prices. \nCER  prices  vary  depending  on  market  conditions,  but  for  example  at  $10  per  CER,  the  CFL \nproject has potential to generate approximately $12.6 million up to 2012. In addition, the project \ncould generate approximately $20.5 million after 2012 and through 2018. \n\n57. \nThe  Ministry  of  Environment  is  the  DNA  for  CDM  in  Pakistan.  The  CDM  Secretariat  is \nheaded by the director general (environment), Ministry of Environment, who is also the national \nfocal person for the DNA. A CDM cell is established and attached to the CDM Secretariat, which \nacts as the national focal point for the CDM  project and issues host country approval to CDM \nprojects on behalf of the Government of Pakistan. \n\nTo  obtain  host  country  approval,  completed  PDDs  must  be  submitted  to  the  director \n58. \ngeneral  (environment)  with  a  detailed  public  consultation  report  and  an  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA) report or, if no EIA is required, a letter of no-objection or endorsement from \nconcerned authorities. \n\n59. \nDespite  the  huge  potential,  Pakistan  has  not  yet  taken  full  benefit  of  the  CDM.  Even \nthough  the  first  CDM  project  from  Pakistan  was  registered  with  the  CDM  executive  board  in \nNovember  2006,  the  second  made  it  only  after  a  gap  of  more  than  2  years  in  January  2009. \nAbout 10 projects are currently under validation. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nI.  \n \nImpact Evaluation. An exercise will be conducted to evaluate the impact of the project \n60. \non  household  energy  consumption  and  bills.  Instead  of  the  usual  procedure  of  comparing  the \nsituation  before  and  after  the  project,  a  counterfactual  (control  group),  comprising  a  relatively \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nsmall number of households that will receive the benefits of the project within the time frame of \nthe  project  but  4  months  later  than  the  rest  of  the  domestic  sector,  will  be  employed.  The \nevaluation  results  will  provide  useful  (re)design  bases  for  the  succeeding  phase  and  for \nreplication in other developing member country markets. \n\n61. \nGiven  that  the  impact  of  the  project  may  not  be  homogenous  across  different  types  of \nhouseholds,  the  design  must  be  able  to  measure  the  impact  of  the  project  according  to \npreintervention energy consumption (which is itself a proxy variable for household income). \n\nProject  Monitoring. The DISCO PMUs will provide project monitoring through its M&E \n\n62. \nteam. The following M&E activities are envisioned for the project: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\ninspection and verification of CFL shipments received from contracted suppliers, \nincluding  compliance  with  third-party  testing  and  certification  requirements  for \nrelease of payments; \noversight  of  allotment  of  CFL  consignments  to  the  DISCOs  and  receipt  at  their \nrespective  regional  distribution  points,  based  on  predetermined  allocations  and \ndelivery schedules agreed upon; \nevaluation of each DISCO accounting, delivery, resource allocation, and internal \nauditing  arrangements  for  CFL  delivery,  incandescent  bulb  recovery,  and \nvoucher handling requirements; \nspot-checking  of  voucher  distribution,  CFL  delivery,  and  incandescent  bulb \nrecovery  at  households  based  on  representative  sampling  of  urban,  rural,  bulk, \nincome, and remote customer stratification; \npostdelivery  surveys  of  sample  representative  households  to  gauge  actual  CFL \npenetration and use, customer satisfaction, and feedback on delivery mechanism \nand communications campaign; \nassistance  to  MOWP  and  implementing  agencies  in  designing  and  conducting \nvoucher redemption analysis at the end of each CFL distribution phase to assess \nproject impact, customer take-up profiles, and associate load and peak electricity \nsavings attributable to the project; \nverification  of  number  and  type  of  incandescent  bulbs  recovered  and  oversee \ntheir destruction and disposal by PEPCO and the DISCOs; \nensuring  that  the  project  communication  campaign  component  is  effective  in \ndelivering  its  intended  message  to  all  target  populations  by  conducting  limited \nconsumer awareness assessment surveys and compiling performance indicators \n(television  and  radio  air  time,  press  advertisements,  packaging  and  marketing \nmaterials developed); \npreparation,  in  collaboration  with  the  implementing  agencies,  of  an  overarching \nand  nine  separate  (for  each  DISCO)  detailed  project  implementation  schedules \nand  work  plans  (using  MS  Project  or  similar  software)  identifying  timelines, \nmilestones,  resources,  and  dependencies  for  each  DISCO\u2019s  implementation  of \neach phase of CFL, voucher, and incandescent bulb transactions and associated \ntasks that will serve as the reference benchmark for progress monitoring; and \npreparation  of  monthly  M&E  reports  to  communicate  project  progress,  issues, \nmilestone  deviations,  and  performance  appraisal  to  the  Investment  Program\u2019s \nPMO M&E cell and other project stakeholders (Planning Commission, ADB, AFD, \nMOWP).\n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5   \n\n57\n\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM MANAGEMENT SUPPORT PROJECT \n \n\n1. \nThe  Investment  Program  Management  Support  Project  is  necessary  to  implement  the \nenergy  efficiency  road  map  and  the  Energy  Efficiency  Investment  Program.  The  road  map \nactivities  cover  multiple  sectors  of  the  economy  and  require  integrated  planning  and \nmanagement,  and  a  results  and  monitoring  framework.

The  project  preparation  consultant  will  assist  the \nPMO and relevant parties in (i) identifying future investment projects; (ii) carrying out technical, \nfinancial,  and  economic  assessment  of  the  projects;  and  (iii)  conducting  environmental  and \nsocial safeguards due diligence assessment. \n \nExternal  monitoring  and  evaluation  consultants  will  ensure  that  the  projects  are \n4. \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  the  approved  specifications  and  in  particular  that  the \nenvironmental and social safeguard aspects are implemented in accordance with the approved \nplans, through the establishment of a monitoring function. \n \n5. \nThe  Planning  Commission  will  employ  consultants  to  provide  varying  services  to  the \ncommission  depending  on  needs  and  capabilities.  The  draft  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsulting services are given in Supplementary Appendix N. \n \n6. \nStrengthening of National Standards and Testing Facilities. The Pakistan Standards \nand  Quality  Control  Authority  (PSQCA),  under  the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology,  is  the \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nnational standardization body. At present, the Government specifies some quality standards for \nlighting  and  other  electrical  appliances,  but  these  do  not  adequately  cover  all  main  product \ncategories, types, or sizes; nor are they properly enforced. The management support project will \nprovide  PSQCA  with  financial  resources  to  introduce  and  adopt  international  energy \nperformance standards1 for products and subcomponents that are predominantly imported into \nthe  country.  This  includes  the  proper  selection  and  harmonization  of  multiple  standard \nspecifications  existing  internationally,  to  ensure  that  those  most  suitable  for  the  Pakistan \ncontext\u2014that  do  not  unnecessarily  penalize  the  country\u2019s  existing  manufacturers  and  supply \nsources\u2014are  adopted.  This  is  of  particular  importance  for  projects  for  residential  CFL \nreplacement,  gas  appliance  upgrades,  public  building  retrofits,  and  industrial  energy  efficiency \nfinancing.  \n \nIn addition, assistance will be provided to the Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial \n7. \nResearch (PCSIR), under the Ministry of Science and Technology, to rapidly augment existing \nnational  equipment  testing  and  certification  facilities,  to  enable  them  to  achieve  international \naccreditation and capacity for meeting the needs of the strengthened national energy efficiency \nstandards  regime.  These  activities  will  be  undertaken  in  collaboration  with  other  development \npartners.2 In particular, the laboratory facilities and training requirements of PCSIR to undertake \nthe quality monitoring of lamps procured through spot checking of bulk CFL shipments will need \nto be in place by 1 April 2010. The detailed arrangements for strengthening PSQCA and PCSIR \nwill be elaborated during project implementation.  \n \n8. \nInstitutional  Capacity  Development.  In  addition  to  the  project-specific  management \nand  planning  capacity  at  the  Planning  Commission,  some  key  focal  agencies  will  need \nstrengthening  to  facilitate  program  implementation  and  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for \nproject  implementation.  The  Energy  Wing,  Planning  Commission  is  the  coordinating  unit  for \nfederal government budget appropriations for energy projects. To be able to integrate E3C into \nintegrated  energy  planning,  project evaluation, and  public  sector  investment  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment,  the  Energy  Wing  will  require  financial  assistance  for  procurement  of  equipment, \ndevelopment of energy databases, office upgrades, and hiring of consulting services for internal \nrestructuring and expansion.  \n \nThe  National  Energy  Conservation  Centre  (ENERCON),  in  existence  since  1985  and \n9. \ndedicated to the promotion of E3C in the country, will be a natural home for the program given \nits  mandate  and  accumulated  experience  in  the  field.  However,  the  institution  has,  since  the \ntermination of the initial technical and financial assistance funded by the United States Agency \nfor  International  Development  in  1990,  been  severely  underresourced  and  has  functioned \nmostly  on  project-based  aid  assistance.  As  a  result,  it  has  lost  most  of  its  key  technical  staff, \nprofessional  facilities,  business  processes,  and  knowledge  base  required  to  fulfill  its  original \nmandate  for  coordinating,  promoting,  and  facilitating  all  national  energy  efficiency  and \nconservation efforts. In addition, it has not been able to commercialize E3C activities effectively \nso  that  it  could  take  on  its  intended  ultimate  role  of  providing  a  supportive  policy,  regulatory, \nadvisory,  and  enabling  environment  for  the  implementation  of  E3C  actions  by  the  public  and \nprivate sectors and energy end-users themselves. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Examples  include  the  US  EnergyStar  rating  for  domestic  and  office  equipment,  and  Euro  emission  standards  for \n\n2   The 3-year Global Environment Facility and United Nations Development Programme regional Barrier Removal for \nthe Cost-Effective Development and Implementation of Energy Efficiency Standards and Labeling project initiated \nin 2009. \n\nvehicles. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5   \n\n59\n\nThe  Government  plan  to  reallocate  ENERCON  under  the  Planning  Commission, \n10. \nredefining its mandate as a national umbrella E3C policy, program, and technical advisory and \nmarket  facilitation  body;  and  development  and  implementation  of  the  energy  efficiency  sector \nroad  map  and  the  National  E3C  Action  Plan.  The  program  will  provide  substantial  support  for \nENERCON's  restructuring,  including  procurement  of  equipment  and  engagement  of  staff,  and \nstrengthening  its  capacity  in  (i)  planning,  (ii)  design,  (iii)  project  management,  (iv)  operations, \nand (v) maintenance activities.  \n \nCFL  Waste  Management  Facility.  Burnt-out  CFLs  are  potentially  hazardous  waste \n11. \nbecause  of  the  presence  of  mercury.  Disposal  into  municipal  landfill  and  dumping  sites  can \nresult in release of mercury into the soil and to water bodies. Currently, the country has no lamp \nwaste management facility. The waste generated from fluorescent tube lights (FTLs) and CFLs \nused in the country are dumped with other municipal waste into various waste dumping sites or \nare  crushed  without  any  safety  consideration  for  disposal  of  glass.  The  30  million  CFLs  to  be \ndistributed under the proposed program will contain between 100 and 120 kilograms of mercury. \nThus a lamp waste management facility (LWMF) with the required handling capacity is needed. \nModern facilities are designed to recover glass, metal, mercury, and chloride salt from the waste \nlamp for reuse.   \n \n12. \nThe  proposed  CFL  distribution  program  envisages  distribution  of  10  million  CFLs  in \nphase 1, spread over 4 months, and distribution of another 20 million CFLs in phase 2, spread \nover 6 months. Phase 2 will be initiated about 8 months after completion of phase 1. The CFLs \nprocured for distribution will have a specified life of 10,000 hours. Given that the average usage \nof CFLs in the domestic sector is about 3.5 hours per day, the CFLs are expected to last more \nthan 8 years, on average. However, issues with waste CFLs are likely to start much before that \nfor a number of reasons. First, manufacturing defects and mishandling may result in burning out \nand  breakage  of  CFLs  before  completion  of  their  rated  life.  Second,  the  CFLs  may  replace \nFTLs,  which  also  contain  about  10\u201315  milligrams  of  mercury  and  require  a  proper  handling \nfacility. Third, the awareness campaign associated with the program is likely to generate a need \nfor a waste disposal facility for the CFLs already in use in the country. About 3% of the CFLs \n(900,000) distributed under the program are expected to require disposal within 3 years after the \nstart  of  the  program.  As  the  typical  capacity  of  a  compact  lamp  waste  management  facility  is \nabout  0.4  million\u20130.5  million  CFLs  per  month,  the  program  envisages  that  a  facility  will  be \ndeveloped and begin operating in year 3 of the program.  \n \n13. \nTo  make  the  facility  a  viable  and  sustainable  mechanism,  waste  treatment  will  be \norganized on a commercial basis. Payment will be made for used CFLs and for fluorescents in \ngeneral.  One  option  is  to  get  trash  collectors  to  pick  up  used  fluorescents,  bring  them  to  a \ncollection  point,  and  be  paid  for  the  waste.  Private  trash  recyclers  could  manage  and  run  the \ncentral waste collection facilities suitably located around the country.  \n \n14. \nOnce  lamps  have  been  accumulated  at  the  collection  points,  a  recycling  mechanism \nwould need to be set up to treat them. The CFL project will provide an opportunity to establish \nrequired recycling facilities in the country for all fluorescent lamps. Survey results show that the \ndomestic sector in Pakistan currently has 113 million light points. Of these, approximately 60% \nutilize  fluorescent  lamps,  including  tubes  and  existing  CFLs.  Up  to  four  recycling  facilities  are \nexpected to be required initially, perhaps distributed across the capitals of each province to limit, \nas much as possible, the cost of transportation of used fluorescent lamps.  \n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nTRANCHE 1 COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \nTable A6.1 shows the summary of cost estimates for the National Compact Fluorescent Lamp \nProject,  and  Table  A6.2  shows  the  summary  of  cost  estimates  for  the  Investment  Program \nManagement  Support  Project.  The  cost  estimation  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nis expressed in constant 2009 prices. Contingencies of 5% are added where price contingencies \nare  based  on  local  and  foreign  inflation.  In  addition,  interest  during  construction  and \ncommitment charges are included. The tax and duty structure in Pakistan has been assessed to \nbe  reasonable,  and  in  April  2008,  the  ADB  Management  has  approved  the  financing  of  taxes \nand  duties  for  projects  in  Pakistan.  Taxes  and  duties  are  eligible  for  financing  under  the  ADB \nPakistan:  Country  Partnership  Strategy  2009.  Accordingly, ADB  financing  will  cover  taxes  and \nduties where appropriate for the Tranche 1 projects.  \n \n\nTable A6.1: National CFL Project Cost Estimates  \n($'000)  \n\nTotal \n\nADB \n\n% \n\nAFD \n\n% \n\nGov't \n\n% \n\n56,000\n\n34,462\n\n62 \n\n21,538\n\n2.

Such capacity should be \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\ncentralized,  to  be  able  to  coordinate  with  all  other  agencies  and  national \nstakeholders,  properly  monitor  inputs  and  activities  of  the  Investment  Program, \nand liaise effectively between the Government and the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and cofinancing agencies; \npositioned as an autonomous unit reporting directly to the highest energy sector \nplanning and decision making; \nable  to  directly  affect  policymaking  and  direct  actions  by  various  ministries,  line \nagencies, and government departments; and \ntechnically  proficient  to  undertake  design,  development,  implementation,  and \nevaluation  of  current  and  future  tranche  projects;  coordinate  with  other  relevant \ngovernment  and  aid  programs;  provide  necessary  safeguards  compliance \nassurance;  conduct  program  reporting  and  presentations;  and  engage  and \ninteract with external consultants for this purpose. \n\n \nAn  assessment  of  government  structure  and  capacity  found  that  none  of  the  existing \n2. \nagencies within the federal (central) Government meet all of these key requirements. Given the \nassessment of the existing relevant Government institutional capacity, the Investment Program \nwill  be  implemented  by  a  dedicated  program  management  office  (PMO)  in  the  Planning \nCommission.  \n \n3. \nExecuting Agency. The Planning Commission of Pakistan will be the Executing Agency \nfor  the  Investment  Program  and  will  manage  overall  implementation,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation.  It  will  be  responsible  for  the  submission  of  periodic  financing  requests  to  ADB. \nIndividual  projects  and  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be \nidentified and prepared by the line or sector ministries and, as appropriate, concerned agencies \nin the relevant sector(s). The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Consultative Group (EECCG) \nwill  function  as  the  platform  for  stakeholder  consultations,  and  each  project  will  be  properly \nvetted against the project selection criteria. The Planning Commission has agreed with a facility \nadministration manual that specifies the roles and responsibilities of each office and team.  \n \nProgram  Management  Office.  The  PMO  (Figure  A7.1)  will  support  the  Office  of  the \n4. \nMember  (Energy),  Planning  Commission  and  the  concerned  agencies  for  implementation  of  \n(i)  the  road  map\u2014policy,  planning,  interagency  and  development  agency  cooperation,  and \ncapacity building support; and (ii) the Investment Program\u2014reporting, monitoring, selection and \npreparation of investment projects, and consultant support. The PMO will be sufficiently staffed \nby,  and  obtain  resources  from,  the  Investment  Program  Management  Support  Project.  The \nPMO  structure  will  comprise  the  following  core  teams:  technical;  legal;  safeguards;  gender \nmainstreaming; and monitoring, evaluation, and reporting. The PMO will inform the EECCG on \nthe road map and implementation progress of the Investment Program. It will facilitate EECCG \nmeetings.  \n \n5. \nThe PMO  will be managed by a highly qualified full-time project director, assisted by a \nfull-time deputy project director. PMO management will report directly to the Member (Energy), \nPlanning  Commission  on  a  day-to-day  basis  as  well  as  via  formal  project  communication \nprocedures.  The  PMO  will  interact  with  ADB  and  other  relevant  project  financiers  and  partner \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7   \n\n63\n\nagencies through the ADB resident mission or designated entity. The PMO will be supported, as \nrequired,  by  project  consultants  engaged  by  the  Government  or  ADB  under  the  Investment \nProgram  Management  Support  Project  (Appendix  6)  for  project  design  and  implementation \nrequirements, as well as for associated Government capacity development needs. \n \n6. \nInvestment Program Management Support Project. The Planning Commission will be \nthe  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  this  Project.  It  will  recruit  consultants  to  support  sector \nagencies to prepare projects to be financed under the Investment Program. External expertise \nwill  be  provided  to  support  the  PMO  in  implementing  the  road  map  actions  and  adopting  best \npractices  in  project  and  policy  development,  as  well  as  human  resource  development  and \ntraining. \n \n\nFigure A7.1: Program Management Office  \n\n \n\n \n\n \nEEIP  =  Energy  Efficiency  Investment  Program,  EIA  =  environmental  impact  assessment,  IT  =  information  and \ntechnology, LAN = local area network, M&E = monitoring and evaluation, PMO = program management office. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n7. \nNational  Compact  Fluorescent  Lamp  Project.  The  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power \n(MOWP),  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  project,  has  delegated  the  Pakistan  Electric  Power \nCompany  (PEPCO)  to  carry  out  procurement.  Eight  distribution  companies  (DISCOs)  and \nKarachi  Electric  Supply  Company  (KESC)  will  help  implement  the  project  in  their  respective \nlicense areas. Implementation arrangements are in Figure A7.2. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nimplementation  activities.

Cost \nstreams  used  to  determine  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR),  i.e.,  capital  investment, \ncompact fluorescent lamp (CFL) distribution, reflect costs of delivering the estimated benefits. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  FIRR  is  calculated  for  the  procurement  and  distribution  of  30  million  CFLs  in \nPakistan.  Capital  costs  are  estimated  in  Pakistan  rupees  using  prices  prevailing  in  mid-2009, \nexpressed  in  constant  prices.  Capital  costs  are  derived  from  local  sources,  including  physical \ncontingencies at 10% of base costs. Price contingencies and interest during implementation are \nexcluded in the estimation of capital costs for the FIRR. \n \nFinancial viability is examined by comparing the incremental costs and benefits with and \n3. \nwithout the investment scenarios. The CFL project\u2019s incremental benefits arise from increased \nenergy  efficiency  of  household  lighting,  resulting  in  a  reduction  of  subsidies  being  provided  to \nratepayers who pay below-market  electric rates. Another incremental benefit accrues from the \nsale  of  the  saved  energy  to  other  consumers  (Table  A9.1).  The  estimated  saved  energy  per \ncustomer  class  was  converted  into  monetary  terms  based  on  the  tariff  schedule  notified  in \nFebruary 2009. Other incremental benefits include the reduced evening peak load resulting from \nthe  reduced  demand  for  lighting  during  evening  peak  hours,  and  deferred  investment  in  new \nthermal  generating  plants  and  the  consequent  deferred  carbon  emissions.  The  benefits  are \nassumed to begin accruing in FY2010, when the first 6-month distribution of 10 million CFLs will \noccur. A second distribution of 20 million CFL will occur in FY2010 or FY2011. \n \n\nTable A9.1: Financial Benefits of the Compact Fluorescent Lamp Project \n\nCustomer \nClass \u2013 \nUsage in \nkWh \n\nNumber of \nCustomers \n\nUnits Sold \n(GWh) \n\nTariff \nRevenue \n(PRs \nmillion) \n\nSubsidy \nReceived/ \nPaid \n(PRs) \n\nCost of \nService \n(PRs/ \nkWh) \n\nAverage \nTariff \n(PRs/ \nkWh) \n\nEnergy \nSavings \nper \nClass \n(GWh/ \nyr) \n\nSubsidy \nSavings \n(PRs) \n\n< 50 \n51\u2013100 \n101\u2013300 \n301\u2013700 \n>700 \nTotal \n \n \nDISCO = distribution company, GWh = gigawatt hour, kWh = kilowatt hour, PRs = Pakistan Rupees. \n\n5,767,943 \n4,012,649 \n5,040,193 \n583,950 \n107,109 \n15,511,844 \n \n \n\n2,898,534,694 \n1,471,006,755 \n888,254,187 \n(123,053,782) \n(20,340,249) \n \n5,114,401,606 \n63,930,020 \n\n2,676 \n9,852 \n62,670 \n60,441 \n28,926 \n164,565 \n \n \n\n1,911 \n3,051 \n12,789 \n7,584 \n2,892 \n28,227 \n \n \n\n8,354 \n8,268 \n18,558 \n(11,518) \n(9,810) \n13,852 \n\nTotal Annual Revenue (PRs) \nTotal Annual Revenue ($) \n\n1.40 \n3.23 \n4.90 \n7.97 \n10.00 \n \n\n663 \n543 \n612 \n81 \n6 \n1,905 \n\n5.77 \n5.94 \n6.35 \n6.45 \n6.61 \n \n\nDISCO Profit \nfrom Excess \nSales \n\n2,898,534,694\n1,471,006,755\n888,254,187\n(123,053,782)\n(20,340,249)\n\n2,345,140,266\n29,314,253\n\n4. \nFor  the  analysis,  the  projected  growth  in  electricity  demand  is  assumed  to  continue  to \nexceed supply, and all energy saved by the CFL project will generate income to the distribution \ncompanies  (DISCOs)  through  reduced  subsidies  and  the  sale  of  the  saved  energy  to  other \nusers for at least 9 years.

CFL  distribution  costs  are  calculated  based  on  estimated  cost  of  DISCO \nemployees distributing the CFLs door-to-door within their respective service territories. Voucher \nprinting costs are estimated based on the marginal cost of printing the vouchers as part of the \nnormal printing of utility bills. Communication and marketing costs are estimated based on the \ncosts of these activities in CFL programs in other countries. \n \nB. \n \nThe  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  is  estimated  at  11.4%.  Calculated  from  the \n6. \nfinancial benefits in Table A9.3, the FIRR of the Project is 97.62%, including the capital costs of \nthe Project and financial benefits. The high FIRR is due to the strong financial benefits of CFLs \nin  the  Pakistan  electric  power  system,  particularly  the  reduced  subsidies  afforded  by  energy \nsavings  in  the  households  of  ratepayers  paying  below-market  rates.  The  FIRR  exceeds  the \nweighted average cost of capital, and therefore, the project is financially viable. \n \n\nTable A9.2: Financial Analysis of the Compact Fluorescent Lamp Project \n($ million) \nProfit \nfrom \nExcess \nSales \n\nCash Flow \nAfter Debt \nService \n\nGross \nExpected \nRevenue \n\nNet Cash \nFlow to \nProject \n(31,734,497) \n(32,387,569) \n93,244,273 \n93,244,273 \n\n \n\n \n9,771,418 31,081,424  31,081,424 \n29,314,253 93,244,273  93,244,273 \n29,314,253 93,244,273  93,244,273 \n\n \n\n29,314,253 93,244,273  93,244,273 \n\n93,244,273 \n\n29,314,253 93,244,273  93,244,273 \n29,314,253 93,244,273  93,244,273 \n29,314,253 93,244,273  93,244,273 \n29,314,253 93,244,273  93,244,273 \n31,081,424  93,244,273 \n29,314,253\n\n93,244,273 \n93,244,273 \n93,244,273 \n93,244,273 \n93,244,273 \n\n \n\nYear \n\nSubsidy \nSavings \n\nProject \nCapital \nCost \n(31,734,497) \n(63,468,993)  21,310,007 \n \n63,930,020 \n \n63,930,020 \n \n\n0 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n8 \n8 \n9 \n( ) = negative value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n63,930,020 \n63,930,020 \n63,930,020 \n63,930,020 \n63,930,020 \n\n63,930,020 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\nC. \n \n7. \n \n\nA sensitivity analysis was carried out (Table A9.3). \n\nTable A9.3: Sensitivity Analysis \n\nSensitivity Parameter \nBase case \nReduce benefits by 10% \nReduce benefits by 30% \nIncrease costs by 10% \nReduce benefits by 10% and increase costs by 10% \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\nFIRR (%) \n97.62 \n87.71 \n66.66 \n88.61 \n79.55 \n\n8. \n\nThe  sensitivity  analysis  reveals  that  the  project  is  viable  even  in  the  event  that  both \n\n \n\n\f74 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nRisk Analysis \n\nbenefits and costs change to its disadvantage by 10%. \n \nD. \n \n9. \nRegulatory  or  tariff  revision  risk  for  this  tranche  is  low.  Tariff  increases  could  reduce \nsubsidies and thus energy savings at subsidized households will not yield as much income to \nthe DISCOs. However, the lifeline tariff (0\u2013100 kilowatt-hours) is not likely to be raised quickly \nand this is the segment with the largest number of incandescent bulb users. The largest risk in \nthe  CFL  project  is  theft  of  CFLs;  although  if  stolen  CFLs  are  used  in  Pakistan,  they  will  still \ngenerate savings and contribute to peak reduction. \n \n10. \nGeopolitical and political risks are present as for all projects in Pakistan. However, the \nhigh number of households involved and their geographic spread lessen the risk of significant \nenergy savings not accruing. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10   75 \n\nSUMMARY OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Assumptions \n\nThe economic analysis of the Pakistan Energy Efficiency Investment Program is in line \n1. \nwith  a  standard  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  framework  and  in  accordance  with  Asian  Development \nBank  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.1 Since  economic  costs  and  benefits \noccur at different times, an economic discount rate of 12% is used to reflect the time factor and \nenable  all  economic  costs  and  benefits  to  be  expressed  and  compared  in  constant  April 2009 \nprices. The exchange rate in Pakistan is a managed floating rate, i.e., it is allowed to fluctuate in \nthe  exchange  market  within  prescribed  ceiling  and  floor  values.  No  adjustments  are  therefore \napplied to it. The rate used is PRs80 = $1, which was the average for month of April 2009. \n \n2. \nA managed floating exchange rate does not imply the lack of distortions (taxes, duties, \nand subsidies) in the balance of payments. Therefore, a standard conversion factor, determined \nfor Pakistan at 0.92, is applied to all domestic prices. \n \n3. \nThe  base  case  oil  price  is  taken  as  $50  per  barrel,  the  average  for  April  2009. \nCorresponding  actual  petroleum  product  prices  are  used  and  market  rates  are  corrected  for \ntaxes, levies, and distortions.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nProject  components  complement  each  other  in  reducing  energy  consumption  in  the \ncountry. The six projects identified include distribution of compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) in the \ndomestic sector, upgrades in the national gas transmission and distribution systems, reduction in \nthermal power generation losses, energy efficiency retrofits in government buildings, replacement \nof domestic gas appliances, and replacements and modifications in machinery and equipment to \nimprove energy performance in the industry sector. In this analysis, the economic benefits of the \nprojects  are  taken  as  the  value  of  electricity,  natural  gas,  oil,  and  coal  saved  by  introducing \nenergy-efficient replacements and retrofits in the targeted sectors. \n \nC. \n \n\nEvaluation of Project Costs and Benefits \n\nProject Cost\u2013Benefit Analysis \n\n1. \n\nProject Costs \n\nThe capital costs of the project to society are the costs of equipment, procurement, and \n5. \nproject  implementation.  They  include  physical  contingencies,  but  exclude  interest  during \nconstruction and price contingencies. The total project cost is expressed in 2009 prices. \n \nThe  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  of  the  project  to  society  are  the  costs  of \n6. \nfuel,  labor,  and  spare  parts  required  to  maintain  equipment  efficiency.  Under  the  gas \ncompressor  upgrade,  thermal  power  plant  loss  reduction,  and  industrial  efficiency  programs, \nO&M  expense  is  expected  to  be  lower  than  current  O&M  costs,2 with  new  equipment  having \nincreased automation. The remaining programs have negligible O&M costs.  \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n2   A detailed study for each project will be conducted at the tranche design stage. \n\n \n\n\f76 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n2. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n7. \nProject  benefits  include  energy  savings  from  energy-efficient  replacements  and  retrofits \nunder  the  various  proposed  projects.  These  energy  savings  are  valued  at  their  economic  price. \nThe economic price of gas is equated to the next-best alternative fuel for each sector. Natural gas \nis  priced  at  the  economic  price  of  imported  liquefied  natural  gas  (LNG),  which  is  the  alternative \nfuel  in  the  domestic  and  commercial  sectors.  The  economic  price  of  LNG  is  estimated  at  the \nexisting price of crude oil ($50 per barrel), using the pricing formula currently being considered by \ngovernment authorities. For the power subsector, the economic price of fuel oil is used. For the \nindustry sector, the economic price of fuel oil is used as a proxy economic price for natural gas \nused by industry. Gasoline is the alternative fuel to compressed natural gas in vehicles; therefore, \nthe economic price of natural gas in the transportation sector is equated to the economic price of \ngasoline. Border prices of petroleum products in the country are linked directly with international \ncrude oil prices. The market price of high-speed diesel, fuel oil, and light-diesel oil is corrected for \nthe petroleum development levy3 and general sales tax of 16% to arrive at the economic price for \ngasoline.  In  the  case  of  high-speed  diesel,  an  import  tariff  is  additionally  applied  on  the  import-\nparity price, which is incorporated into the economic price as well. The market price of indigenous \nand imported coal is adjusted for sales tax to arrive at the economic price of coal. \n \n8. \nPakistan  is  presently  facing  serious  power  supply  deficits;  the  situation  is  unlikely  to \nimprove  in  the  next  3\u20135  years.  In  these  conditions,  electricity  saved  through  energy  efficiency \nmeasures  will  make  a  corresponding  amount  of  energy  available  to  users  who  are  otherwise \ndeprived  of  power  supply.  The  benefit  of  additional  power  supplied  under  this  project  is  the \navoided loss to the economy as a  whole due to load shedding, or power outages, without the \nproject.  Consumers\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  the  power  not  supplied  is  used  as  a  proxy  for  the \neconomic  benefit  of  the  electricity  saved.  Assuming  that  all  segments  of  society  are  equally \ndeprived under a shortfall situation, and each will equally capture the electricity saved from the \nprojects,  willingness  to  pay  is  approximated  by  the  average  electricity  tariff4 net  of  subsidy.  It \nreflects society\u2019s willingness to pay during power shortages. Following the elimination of deficits \nin  power  supply,  electricity  savings  can  be  valued  at  the  system\u2019s  marginal  peak  rate  of \ngeneration,  which  in  the  case  of  Pakistan  ranges  from  PRs7.0/kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  to \nPRs8.5/kWh.5 In view of the uncertainty associated with the timing of possible capacity additions \nand  elimination  of  power  supply  deficits,  willingness  to  pay  corresponding  to  an  average \nelectricity tariff of PRs6.06/kWh6 is taken as a conservative estimate for the economic price of \nelectricity throughout the analysis period.   \n \n9. \nThe  total  project  costs  under  the  Investment  Program  are  estimated  at  $1,180  million. \nAfter  valuing  energy  benefits  at  the  economic  price,  the  aggregated  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn (EIRR) for the six projects is determined as 66%. The individual project EIRR is 145% for \nthe  CFL  distribution  program,  32%  for  gas  compressor  replacement,  26%  for  the  reduction  in \nthermal  power  generation  losses,  21%  for  energy  efficiency  retrofits  in  government  buildings, \n395%  for  replacement  of  domestic  appliances,  and  27%  for  improving  energy  performance  in \n\n                                                 \n3  The petroleum development levy was replaced with the carbon surcharge effective 1 July 2009. The imposition of \n\nthe carbon surcharge, however, was temporarily stayed by a Supreme Court ruling on 7 July 2009. \n\n4   A small segment of domestic, commercial, and industrial consumers opt for standby generation fueled by high-speed \ndiesel or gasoline. The willingness to pay for this segment is substantially higher than the electricity tariff applied by the \nutility. The average electricity tariff is therefore a conservative estimate for the willingness to pay for society as a whole.   \n5   Considering  the  implementation  of  tranche  3  (reduction  in  thermal  power  plants  loss),  the  likely  marginal  peak \n\ngeneration rate will drop to PRs7.0\u2013PRs7.5 per kWh, compared to the current rate of PRs8.23 per kWh.   \n6   Pakistan Electric Power Company Tariff Revenue, Energy Sales, and Subsidy Analysis for FY2008\u2013FY2009. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10   77 \n\nthe industry sector.

Power  generation,  particularly \nfar-reaching \nenvironmental  impacts,  which  will  be  mitigated  by  end  users  saving  electricity  and  improving \nenergy  efficiency  in  electricity  generation,  transformation,  and  distribution.   Improving  energy \nefficiency  in  the  country  will  reduce  emissions  of  atmospheric  pollutants  in  the  transportation \nand \nin  cleaner  air  and  reduced  greenhouse  gas  (GHG) \nemissions.  The natural gas saved will displace heavy fuel oil in power generation and industry, \nwhich will help improve air quality through lower sulfur and particulate emissions. \n \n11. \nCarbon  emission  reduction  potential  for  the  CFL  project  based  on  Clean  Development \nMechanism  methodology  is  estimated  at  908,000  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  equivalent \n(tCO2e) per year. At a conservative price of $10/tCO2e this will generate revenues of about $9 \nmillion per year. \n \n12. \nThe remaining projects will result in numerous environmental benefits. The benefits from \nreduction  of  GHG  emissions  and  the  contribution  to  mitigate  climate  change  can  be  shared \nregionally and globally. However, the literature on climate change suggests that avoided global \ndamage from reducing CO2 emissions, or the social value of carbon, is likely to be significantly \nlarger than the carbon market value.7 The Project\u2019s EIRR, even without accounting for the social \nvalue  of  carbon  on  the  benefit  side,  significantly  exceeds  the  economic  hurdles  rate  of  12%. \nTherefore,  keeping  on  the  conservative  side,  the  environmental  benefits  associated  with \nreduced GHG emissions are not accounted for in the overall economic analysis.8 \n \n13. \nUnder  the  CFL  project,  30  million  CFLs  will  be  distributed  throughout  the  country.  By \nprocuring the CFLs at wholesale price, the price per lamp will be reduced from the local retail \nprice.  A  survey  conducted  during  the  project  design  determined  the  wattage  of  incandescent \nbulbs  in  use  (Supplementary  Appendix  I).  About  62%  of  electrified  households  in  Pakistan \ncurrently  use  100  watt  (W)  incandescent  bulbs,  and  the  rest  use  either  60  W  or  40  W \nincandescent  bulbs.  Single  wattage  (20\u201323  W) 9  CFLs  will  be  procured  under  the  project, \nequivalent to at least 100 W incandescent bulbs in lumens output. Each replacement will result \nin a saving of 18\u201378 W, depending on the incandescent bulb wattage replaced. With 3.5 hours \nof average use per day, each replacement will save about 77 kWh annually, contributing to total \nannual energy savings of 2,132 gigawatt-hours per year. This will result in capacity savings of \n1,094  megawatts,  assuming  a  nationwide  lamp  use  coincidence  factor  of  66%  during  the \nevening peak. Transmission and distribution losses are not included as benefits of the project as \nthe energy saved will be resold to other users and thus T&D losses will remain unchanged. The \nenergy benefits are estimated based on a 7.7-year life of each CFL (corresponding to a 10,000-\nhour life rating). The EIRR of this project is 145%, reflective of a relatively short period in which \ninvestment in a CFL can be recovered. \n \n14. \nUpgrades of inefficient gas compressors on the utility networks will result in natural gas \nsavings, which are valued at the economic price of fuel oil; the alternative fuel of choice during \ngas  shortfalls.  Similarly,  upgrades  of  state-owned  thermal  power  plants  (at  generation \ncompanies) will result in their improved efficiency, reducing the plants\u2019 energy intake per unit of \n\n                                                 \n7  The  social  value  of  carbon  is  estimated  as  the  present  value  of  the  total  damages  inflicted  or  reduced  globally \n\nwhen an additional unit of CO2 is emitted into or taken out of the atmosphere. \n\n8  An estimation of carbon benefits for each project will be conducted at the tranche design stage. \n9  A  wattage  band  for  CFLs  (equivalent  in  lumens  produced  to  a  single  wattage  incandescent  bulb)  is  usually \nindicated to accommodate different manufacturers\u2019 specifications and not bias procurement criteria in favor of any \nparticular supplier. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10   79 \n\nelectricity  generated.  The  energy  saved  under  the  thermal  plant  upgrade  program  is  therefore \nalso valued at the economic price of fuel oil. \n \n15. \nThe government buildings retrofit program aims to improve building insulations; heating, \nventilating,  and  air-conditioning  installations;  lighting;  and  controls  in  approximately  50 \ngovernment  buildings.  These  could  include  offices,  hospitals,  schools,  colleges,  and  other \ninstitutions or public facilities. The retrofits will result in reduced electricity consumption, and the \ncorresponding benefits are valued at the economic price of electricity. \n \n16. \nUpgrade  and  replacement  of  domestic  gas  appliances  will  reduce  natural  gas \nconsumption  for  water  and  space  heating,  and  cooking  in  households.  Under  the  current  gas \nallocation  policy,  the  Government  assigns  highest  priority  to  the  domestic  and  commercial \nsectors. Supply of natural gas to these sectors is considered essential or given highest priority. \nWith  increasing  gas  shortfalls,  LNG  will  eventually  have  to  be  imported  to  meet  growing \nhousehold gas demand. Therefore, natural gas savings under the domestic appliance upgrade \nprogram are valued at the economic price of imported LNG, determined at a crude oil price of \n$50 per barrel. \n \n17. \nThe  industry  sector  has  diverse  energy  uses  and  the  industrial  efficiency  financing \nprogram  will  result  in  savings  in  electricity,  natural  gas,  and  coal.  These  are  valued  at  their \neconomic  price;  in  the  case  of  electricity  this  is  willingness  to  pay,  for  natural  gas  it  is  the \neconomic  price  of  fuel  oil,  and  for  coal  it  is  the  economic  price  of  coal  (net  of  taxes  and \nsubsidies). \n \n\n3. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n18. \nThe sensitivity of project economic results to changes in key variables was tested, and \nthe results are summarized in Table A10.3. In general, the EIRRs are sensitive to the variables \ntested,  but  exceed  the  economic  hurdle  rate  for  all  sensitivities  tested,  including  the  multiple-\ndownside (combined) scenario. On this basis, the project appears to be economically viable. \n \n\nTable A10.3: Sensitivity Analysis \n\nSensitivity Parameter  \n\nVariation  \n\nEIRR (%) \n\nBase case  \n\nCapital cost increase  \n\nBenefits reduced  \n\n  \n\n10% \n\n\u201310% \n\nImplementation delay  \n\n 1 year  \n\nCost increase and \nbenefits reduced  \n\n +10%, \u201310%  \n\nCost increase, \nbenefits reduced, and \nimplementation delay  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n +10%, \u201310%, 1 year  \n\n38 \n\n \n\n66 \n\n59 \n\n59 \n\n44 \n\n53 \n\n \n\n\f80 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS \n \n\nEnvironment Aspects \n\nA. \n\u00a0\n\n1. \n\nOverall Investment Program \n\n1. \nImproving energy efficiency and energy conservation, in general, leads to a cleaner and \nbetter  environment.  Electricity  production,  particularly  from  fossil  fuels,  has  far-reaching \nenvironmental  impacts.  Consequently,  energy  efficiency  is  closely  related  to  environmental \nbenefits.  Other  than  the  economic  and  financial  benefits,  improving  energy  efficiency  in  the \ncountry  will  decrease  the  demand  for  natural  resources  and  reduce  atmospheric  pollutants, \nresulting in reduced greenhouse gas emissions and consequently less climate change impact. \nMoreover,  improved  energy  efficiency  will  lower  water  use  and  improve  water  quality,  reduce \naccumulation of solid waste, and reduce pressure on natural wilderness and pristine areas from \nfossil fuel biomass and extraction.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProjects \n\n \n2. \nNational  Compact  Fluorescent  Lamp  Project.  This  project  will  replace  30  million \nincandescent bulbs in the domestic sector with efficient, high-quality compact fluorescent lamps \n(CFLs).  The  project  will  accelerate  CFL  market  penetration  and  will  result  in  about  a  \n1,094 megawatt reduction in peak evening electricity demand, resulting in savings in electricity \nconsumption  of  2,132  gigawatt-hours  per  year  by  2011,  thus  alleviating  power  supply  deficits \ncurrently common in the country. An initial environmental examination (IEE) of the CFL project \nconcludes  that  the  procurement,  distribution,  and  use  of  CFLs  will  not  have  any  significant \nadverse environmental or social impact.  \n \n3. \nCFLs typically contain 3\u20134  milligrams of mercury, which is a highly toxic substance. The \nharmful  impact  of  mercury  on  human  health  is  caused  by  long-term,  low,  or  chronic  exposure, \nwhich  affects  the  kidneys,  nervous  system,  and  female  reproductive  system.  Spent  CFLs  are \ntherefore  potentially  hazardous.  As  Pakistan  currently  has  no  hazardous  waste  handling \nregulations and disposal facilities, facilities dedicated to the handling and disposal of spent CFLs \nwill need to be organized on a commercial basis to properly dispose of the CFLs distributed under \nthe project (in addition to other CFLs and fluorescent tube lamps in use in the country) after they \nhave expired. The lamp waste management system would need to be in place by the fourth year \nof  the  program  as  the  CFLs  distributed  under  the  program  begin  to  reach  the  end  of  their \noperating lifetimes (a 10,000-hour rated lamp, used on average for less than 3 hours a day, could \nlast  for  10  years).  However,  the  program  could  be  started  even  earlier  to  help  manage  current \nCFL  or  fluorescent  tube  lamp  disposal  needs,  as  well  as  to  establish  and  test  an  effective \nrecycling  regime  and  create  the  necessary  public  awareness.  The  facilities  to  be  developed  fall \nunder category B of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Environmental Assessment Guidelines \n(2003),  and  consequently  an  IEE  for  the  facility  will  be  undertaken.  Under  the  environmental \nregulations  of  Pakistan,  \u201ca  waste  disposal  facility  for  domestic  or  industrial  wastes,  with  annual \ncapacity  of  less  than  10,000  cubic  meters\u201d  requires  an  IEE.  The  facilities  are  expected  to  be \ndeveloped  in  the  private  sector  and  therefore  the  IEE  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  project \nowners.  However,  because  the  facility  may  not  be  commercially  viable  for  the  private  sector,  a \ncontingency provision is included in the project budget to establish it in the public sector. In this \ncase,  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  project  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  IEE  is \nundertaken and approved. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11   81 \n\nGas Transmission and Distribution Upgrades. In the natural gas transmission system, \n4. \ngas compressors are used to increase the upstream pipeline pressure of the gas by compressing \nit  into  smaller  volumes.  The  increased  pressure  allows  the  transport  of  the  gas  through  the \ntransmission  and  distribution  pipeline  network.  Currently,  Sui  Northern  Gas  Pipelines  Limited \noperates 11 compressor stations that use natural gas as fuel. It proposes to replace the existing \noutdated  compressors  with  new,  more  efficient,  and  larger  machines  to  enhance  compression \ncapacity and improve system reliability. Installation of more efficient compressors will reduce gas \nconsumption and consequently the emission of air pollutants. The new compressors will replace \nexisting  compressors,  and  will  be  installed  within  the  premises  of  the  existing  facilities.  No  new \nland  will  be  acquired  for  this  purpose.  This  component  is  categorized  under  category  C  and \ntherefore no environmental assessment is required. \n \nThermal  Power  Plant  Loss  Reduction.  The  four  public  sector  power  generation \n5. \ncompanies  (GENCOs)  in  Pakistan  operate  13  power  units  based  mainly  on  steam-cycle  and \ncombined-cycle  technologies.  For  various  reasons,  mainly  associated  with  the  financial \nconstraints  faced  by  these  companies,  these  plants  are  being  operated  at  derated  capacities \nnearly  25%  below their  nameplate  ratings. The  average forced outage rate for the  GENCOs,  at \n12%,  is  high  compared  with  6%  for  independent  power  producers  in  the  country.  Nearly  all \nGENCO plants are operating at much lower efficiency than the industry benchmark for plants of \nsimilar ages and configurations. Due to the aging of several plants, all of the derated capacity and \nefficiency  cannot  be  economically  restored.  The  existing  units  at  three  plants\u2014Guddu  Steam, \nFaisalabad Steam, and Multan Steam\u2014are proposed to be replaced by modern combined-cycle \nplants. The plant at Guddu is gas-fired and can use the same gas already allocated to the existing \npower plant to fuel the replacement plant. At the other two plants, the less efficient steam-cycle \nplant  will  be  replaced  by  high-efficiency  combined-cycle  plants.  This  will  increase  the  power \ngeneration capacities of the plants by improving efficiencies from the existing 22%\u201331% to 43%\u2013\n48%. The installation of the more efficient plants will also result in overall environmental benefits. \nThese include reduced air pollution, reduced global warming and climate change impact, and less \nwater consumption. The new units will be installed at the existing plant sites. This will avoid the \nrequirement  of  purchasing  new  land,  consequently  eliminating  the  environmental  and  social \nissues  associated  with  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  land  use  conversion.  Lower \nemissions will also benefit the communities living around the plants by reducing potential health \nrisks  to  them.  Good  environmental  practice  demands  that  the  operation  of  the  entire  facility \ncomply with applicable environmental standards. Thus, modification of the plants will also address \nthe environmental and social issues associated with the existing plants, and will bring the plants to \npar with modern power plants in terms of their environmental performance. This will be an added \nbenefit to the local community and the environment. Nevertheless, activities associated with the \nconstruction  of  power  plants,  particularly  near  built-up  areas,  have  potential  environmental \nimpacts. A 750 MW plant at Guddu, and 450 MW plants at Faisalabad and Multan, are planned to \nbe replaced. These are categorized as category A projects and will require environmental impact \nassessments  (EIAs)  to  meet  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines.  Under  the  environmental \nregulations of Pakistan, thermal power plants exceeding 200 MW require an EIA.  \n \n6. \nBuilding  Retrofits.  This  program  aims  at  improving  energy  efficiency  through  system \nupgrades of three targeted groups of government buildings\u2014offices, hospitals, and educational \ninstitutions. The component includes creation of a new national energy efficiency center under \nthe  management  of  the  Planning  Commission,  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Investment \nProgram.  It  includes  a  detailed  study  of  selected  buildings;  energy  audits;  and  purchase  of \nenergy  audit  tools,  data  loggers,  and  energy  analysis  software  tools  for  undertaking  building \nenergy  use  analysis.  It also  includes  financing  for  implementation  of  energy  efficiency  retrofits \nfor the buildings selected for efficiency upgrades. The nature of activities in this component is \n\n \n\n\f82 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nsuch  that  no  environmental  assessments  are  required  as  the  component  is  categorized  as \ncategory C under ADB guidelines. \n \n7. \nIndustrial Energy Efficiency Financing. An industry sector energy efficiency fund will be \nestablished  to  provide  loans,  contingency  loans,  or  leases  for  the  purchase  of  energy-efficient \nequipment by industrial plants, especially electrical motors, boilers and furnaces, and other large- \nto medium-scale investments. Small cogeneration units; heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning; \nlighting  retrofits;  process  controls;  and  other  measures  could  be  financed  as  well.  Retrofits  and \nexpansions  would  be  supported  through  working  capital  and  bridge-funding  arrangements  with \ncommercial banks, supplemented by equity financing from owners. Other than benefits associated \nwith energy conservation, these measures often result in the installation of modern technologies \nthat  also  have  localized  benefits,  particularly  in  terms  of  occupational  health  and  safety  for  the \nworkers and the local community. Due to their scale and nature, these measures generally fall into \ncategory C assessment and do not require specific environmental assessments. \n \n8. \nDomestic  Gas  Appliance  Upgrades.  The  energy  efficiency  potential  in  gas  used  for \ndomestic water heating in Pakistan is estimated to be 30%, which can be achieved by retrofitting \nexisting water heating appliances. The gas utilities, Sui Southern Gas Company and Sui Northern \nGas  Pipelines  Limited,  have  devised  some  of  these  retrofits  in  collaboration  with  local  technical \npartners. These retrofits include (i) a timing device to switch off the heater during parts of the day \nwhen hot water is not required; (ii) descaling to improve heating efficiency; and (iii) flue gas control \nto  minimize  heat  loss  from  the  exhaust.  The  potential  for  improvement  in  energy  efficiency  in \nspace heating appliances is similarly estimated at 36%, which can be achieved by replacing them \nwith more efficient models.  \n \n9. \nThe  retrofits  could  be  developed  and  provided  by  the  gas  utility  companies,  or \nalternatively utility companies could involve the private sector in their commercial development \nand  marketing.  This  type  of  activity  is  unlikely  to  involve  any  significant  environmental  impact \nand is therefore categorized as C under ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines. \n \nB. \n\u00a0\n\nSocial Aspects \n\n1. \n\nOverall Investment Program \n\n10. \nPakistan is currently faced with a serious energy crisis to which inefficient use of available \nenergy resources is identified as one of the key contributors. The economic and social impacts of \nthis  situation  are  felt  across  all  sectors  of  national  life.  Although  some  of  the  economic  issues \nconfronting the country can be attributed to the global economic recession, many impacts can be \nclearly linked to the shortfall in energy supply. These include, most importantly, the shutting down \nof  industrial  units  or  reduction  in  their  production,  resulting  in,  among  other  negative  impacts, \nunemployment and reduced income for workers. The Government is taking various measures to \novercome  this  issue,  and  identifies  energy  efficiency  as  an  effective,  least-cost  short-  and \nmedium-term  solution.  Improvement  in  energy  supply  will  help  increase  employment  and \neconomic  productivity,  which  will  contribute  directly  to  reducing  poverty  and  improving  the  living \nconditions  of  workers.  Its  social  benefits  will  reduce  the  adverse  impact  of  power  outages  on \nsocial life, education, and quality of life in general. Indirect and wider economic benefits can also \nfollow to the community through, for example, increased business opportunities for local suppliers \nand retailers.  \n \n11. \nImproved energy efficiency will result in the reduction of instances of load shedding. At \ntimes  of  power  shortages,  the  electricity  distribution  companies  (DISCOs)  switch  off  power \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11   83 \n\nsupply  to  entire  parts  of  the  grid  to  reduce  the  load  on  the  distribution  system.  A  common \npractice is to maintain much longer load-shedding hours in rural areas than in urban areas. At \ntimes, load-shedding in rural areas is twice as long in duration compared to the case in towns \nand  cities.  Availability  of  additional  power  supply,  made  possible  through  energy  efficiency \nsavings,  is  likely  to  reduce  the  occurrence  of  load-shedding,  which  would  particularly  benefit \nrural areas where the majority of the poor population of the country resides.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProposed Projects \n\nGas  Transmission  and  Distribution  Upgrades.  This  project  will  not  have  any  direct \n\n12. \nNational CFL Project. This project will help improve the quality, reliability, and access to \nelectricity in the country. For households, the replacement of incandescent lamps with CFLs is \nexpected  to  improve  lighting  conditions,  particularly  for  poor  consumers  who  currently  use \ninferior  quality  or  wattage  lamps.  This  is  especially  important  for  children,  since  reading  and \nstudying  under  low  lighting  can  cause  eyestrain  and  lead  to  poor  eyesight.  Better  lighting  in \nhouseholds  will  also  help  improve  the  environment  for  social  and  economic  activities.  In \naddition,  CFL  lamps  will  benefit  poor  customers  directly  by  reducing  their  electricity  bills.  The \naverage  annual  consumer  electricity  savings  per  light  point  is  estimated  at  about  PRs293  per \nyear.  This  reduction  is  significant  for  lifeline  consumers,  representing  several  times  their \naverage monthly bills in the case of the lowest categories. Other less tangible benefits include \nincreased  public  awareness  of  hazardous  wastes,  availability  of  better  quality  lamps  due  to \ndevelopment  and  enforcement  of  product  standards  and  labeling,  and  development  of \ncommercial opportunities in waste management.  \n \n13. \nsocial impact other than those associated with overall energy efficiency. \n \n14. \nThermal  Power  Plant  Loss  Reduction.  The  installation  of  the  more  efficient  thermal \ngeneration  plants  will  result  in  overall  social  benefits.  Some  of  these  are  directly  related  to \nimproved  environmental  conditions  made  possible  by  the  replacements  and/or  rehabilitation. \nThese include, for example, the health benefits of cleaner air and water. Installation of the units \nat existing GENCO sites will avoid the need for purchasing new land, consequently eliminating \nsocial issues associated with land acquisition and resettlement. Construction-related impacts of \npower plant installation include generation of new employment opportunities; issues associated \nwith migrant workers, such as cultural conflicts between local and nonlocal workers; and traffic \nimpact  and  community  safety  hazards  caused  by  construction  vehicles.  The  project  EIAs  will \ninclude  a  full-scale  community  consultation  plan  for  the  design,  construction,  and  operations \nphases of the plants.  \n \n15. \nBuilding  Retrofits. Retrofitting of public buildings\u2014offices, schools, and hospitals\u2014will \nhelp improve comfort for building users. School children will particularly benefit from upgrades, \nas schools in the public sector are generally in a poor state of maintenance compared with their \ncounterparts in the private sector. \n \n16. \nIndustrial  Energy  Efficiency  Financing.  The  project  will  not  have  any  direct  social \nimpact  other  than  that  associated  with  overall  energy  efficiency.  However,  improved  energy \nefficiency\u2014for  example,  for  a  boiler,  furnace,  or  lighting\u2014may  result  in  reduction  of  ambient \ntemperatures  and  improved  illumination  in  the  work  area,  which  will  be  beneficial  for  the \nworkers. The industrial efficiency program can also be packaged with some of the occupational \nhealth and safety measures to improve occupational conditions for workers. \n \n\n \n\n\f84 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nDomestic Gas and Electric Appliance Upgrades. The project will result in savings on \n17. \nelectricity and gas bills, and is likely to improve comfort during winter. The project, if managed \nthrough the private sector, could also generate substantial job opportunities. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12   85 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\n PAK: Energy Efficiency Investment Program \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n \n\n \n\nMultitranche Financing Facility \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nCentral and West Asia Department \nEnergy and Natural Resources Division \n\nI. \n\n \nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\n \n\nA.   Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nDespite  recent  efforts  to  increase  capacity  and  supply,  Pakistan  is  presently  suffering  from  a  serious  energy \nshortfall.  The  shortfall  is  more  pronounced  in  the  electricity  subsector  during  peak  hours  resulting  in  significant \npower  cuts  affecting  economic  activity  and  delivery  of  social  services.  Recently  these  resulted  in  reduced \nproduction  in  various  industries  that  left  many  workers,  mostly  belonging  to  the  poor  segments  of  society, \nunemployed. In addition, the phased adjustment of petroleum prices and electricity tariffs starting in 2008 following \nthe increase in international oil prices burdened poor consumers with increased expenses in meeting their energy \nneeds. \n\nAchieving energy security and energy affordability are two main goals set in the Vision 2030 and the Medium-Term \nDevelopment Framework of Pakistan. The recently updated Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP-II) for 2009\u20132011 \naims at achieving poverty reduction through sustainable economic growth and employment generation. In achieving \nthese objectives the strategy regards the following as essential: the provision of adequate energy (i) to industry to \ndrive  economic  growth  and  create  employment  opportunities,  (ii)  to  the  domestic  sector  for  cooking  and  heating, \nand  (iii)  to  prevent  the  continuing  environmental  degradation  and  deforestation  by  massive  use  of  wood  for \ndomestic fuel. Based on these government priorities, improving energy efficiency is among the key target outcomes \nof  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  sector  assistance  under  its  country  partnership  strategy  (2009\u20132013)  for \nPakistan.a \n\nThe energy savings resulting from improved efficiency under the proposed program are expected to provide a more \nreliable energy supply to various sectors of the economy. The resulting sustained economic activity in particular in \nthe industry sector will indirectly benefit industrial laborers as their jobs will no longer be threatened by power cuts. \nPoor and vulnerable consumers, including social utilities like hospitals and schools, often hardest hit by insufficient \npower  supply  and  load  shedding  will  also  benefit  from  efficient  and  more  reliable  delivery  of  services.  Under  the \ncompact  fluorescent  lamp  (CFL)  distribution  program,  the  use  of  CFLs  by  low-income  (lifeline  tariff)  customers \nexpressed as a percentage of total lighting points used is expected to increase from the current 34% of households \nto 74% of households after two phases of distribution. \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.   Key Issues  \n \nEfficient energy use in all sectors of the economy is expected to help reduce the overall rate of increase of energy \ndemand  to  more  manageable  levels  and  reduce  potential  shortages.  Energy  efficiency  can  reduce  large  financial \noutlays  required  for  developing  additional  energy  supplies  in  the  future.  It  can  also  help  minimize  uneconomical \nstandby  capacity  required  to  cater  to  peak  loads,  reduce  subsidy  requirements,  and  defer  transmission  system \nexpansion  needs,  thereby  saving  public  funds  and  increasing  returns  on  energy  infrastructure  investments  that \ncould, in return, be directed to social programs. \n\nPoor  sectors  of  society  are  more  often  among  the  hardest  hit  by  the  shortfall  in  energy  supply.  Typically  the \nduration  of  load  shedding  is  far  higher  in  rural  areas  than  in  urban  areas  or  relatively  larger  cities.  The  poor  are \nexpected  to  benefit  from  energy  savings  realized  from  implementation  of  energy  efficiency  interventions  with \nreliable access to energy and improved lighting. This would have an improved impact on households\u2019 economic and \nsocial activities in the evening. In addition, the communication and social mobilization component will provide poor \nhouseholds with information on other affordable energy efficient choices to reduce household energy expenditure. \nThe impact of the promotion of CFLs also depends on affordability and effective distribution channels. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n Increased investments and market penetration of energy efficient technologies in Pakistan will result in \n   \n\n(i)  reduction  of  energy  wastage  in  industrial,  residential,  and  public  sector  gas  and  power  consumption: \n\n2,200 megawatt savings;  \n\n \n\n\f86 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nsavings; \n\n(ii)  reduction of energy transformation loss (gas transmission and thermal power generation): 500 megawatt \n\n(iii)  establishment of minimum national energy efficiency standards;  \n(iv) mainstreaming and proper management of energy efficiency in planning and investments; and \n(v)  reduction of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.  \n\n \nConsumers\u2019  energy  costs  will  be  reduced  with  the  use  of  efficient  technologies  and  practices.  With  reduced \nelectricity  demand,  the  overall  need  for  supply  (additional  generation)  will  be  reduced.  Also,  a  large  amount  of \ngreenhouse gas emissions\u2014and the associated cost of importing fuel\u2014will be avoided, creating emission reduction \ncredits under carbon financing. The Investment Program will establish a sustainable business model for large-scale \nimplementation  of  energy  efficiency  programs.  It  will  reduce  public  sector  energy  expenditure,  reduce  health  risks \nassociated  with  residual  mercury  and  kerosene  (in  off-grid  areas),  enhance  livelihoods  of  rural  communities, \nfacilitate a viable energy efficiency audit and management industry, and establish a certification process for energy \nand environmentally efficient technologies and practices.  \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Consultations  were  carried  out  with  various  government  and  nongovernment  agencies,  institutions,  and \ncompanies  relevant  to  energy  policy,  legislation,  planning,  management,  and  implementation,  which  will  be \ninvolved in development of the energy efficiency program. \n\n2.

Key Issues. \nThe  program  is  expected  to  improve  household  (and  women\u2019s)  living  standards  through  increased  access  to  and \nquality of energy services, which will result in greater savings from reduced energy expenditure. A more reliable and \nsecure  supply  of  energy  can  drastically  improve  the  quality  of  sanitation;  health  care;  and  other  social  services, \nparticularly education without gender discrimination. \n \n2.
