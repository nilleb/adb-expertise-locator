This  will  involve  the  improvement  of  flood \nmitigation  embankments  and  practices,  control  of  watershed  soil  erosion,  the  expansion  of \nwater  treatment  and  water  supply  to  upstream  rural  communities  and  Haidong,  as  well  as \nexpansion  of  the  city\u2019s  solid  waste  disposal  capacity.  This  multidisciplinary  approach  to  urban \nwatershed  management  will  play  a  critical  role  in  enhancing  environmental  protection, \necological rehabilitation, and climate change adaptation capacities in the river catchment area, \nthereby benefiting not only Haidong, but also many downstream communities. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nQinghai Province, situated mostly on the Qinghai\u2013Tibetan plateau in northwestern PRC, \nhas long been home to a number of ethnic groups due to its location along the old Silk Road.2 \nEthnically diverse and featuring a beautiful and rugged landscape with mountains and pastures, \nQinghai  is  the  source  of  the  Mekong,  Yangtze,  and  Yellow  rivers,  making  it  a  socially  and \nenvironmentally significant province for the PRC.3 Given the fragile terrain, Qinghai is promoting \nurbanization  within  a  northeastern  corridor  linking  its  capital,  Xining,  to  Lanzhou,  in  Gansu \nProvince. While protecting its natural resources, Qinghai also aims to protect urban areas from \nnatural hazards such as flash flooding, which has increased in cities across the PRC as a result \nof  impermeable  paved  surfaces,  deforestation,  poor  waterway  management,  and  an  overall \ndecrease in natural water collection areas. \n \n4. \nHaidong,  the  second-largest  city  in  Qinghai,  is  located  within  this  corridor,  immediately \neast of Xining. A city of 1.7 million residents (30.0% of Qinghai\u2019s total population of 5.7 million), \nHaidong  upgraded  to  a  prefecture-level  city  in  2013,  denoting  its  importance  in  regional \ndevelopment.  Haidong  has  two  districts\u2014Ping\u2019an  and  Ledu\u2014and  four  counties.4 Both  districts \nstraddle  the  Huangshui  River,  an  important  tributary  of  the  Yellow  River.  Strengthening  the \necological  function  of  the  Huangshui  River  to  protect  these  critical  watersheds  is  an  urgent \npriority.  This  involves  managing  flood  risks,  reducing  soil  erosion,  improving  water  quality  and \navailability, increasing climate change resilience, and limiting urban expansion.  \n\n \n\n5. \nAccording to the Haidong master plan, the two districts are expected to add more than \nhalf  a  million  residents  by  2030. 5  This  will  put  pressure  on  an  already  fragile  landscape; \n\n                                                \n1  The  concept  paper  was  approved  on  19  December  2014.  ADB.  2014.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  for  the  Qinghai  Haidong  Urban\u2013Rural  Eco  Development  Project.  Manila  (TA  8846-PRC).  \u201cEco \ndevelopment\u201d refers to ecological development. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n2  Qinghai  is  home  to  54  of  the 56  ethnic  groups  in  the  PRC.  It  is  also  one  of  the  less-developed  western  regions \ntargeted for accelerated socioeconomic development and poverty reduction by the preferential policies under the \nNational Strategy for Development of the West. \n\n3  Haidong\u2014located along the Silk Road near a number of significant Buddhist temples, Qinghai Lake, and the train \n\nlink to Lhasa\u2014attracts many tourists in summer, which generates significant revenue and local employment.  \n\n4  The current population of Ping\u2019an District is 68,100 while the current population of Ledu District is 109,800. \n5  Government of the PRC, Haidong Municipal Government. 2013.  Master Planning of Haidong Urban Area (2013\u2013\n\n2030). Haidong.   \n\n\f2 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nHaidong\u2019s  location  in  the  river  valley,  surrounded  by  steep  and  barren  mountains,  makes  it \nvulnerable to flash flooding.  According to Haidong\u2019s historical records, flood events of different \nlevels  have  occurred  every  year  since  1949,  with  large-scale  floods  every  6\u20137  years.  While \nsome  flood  infrastructure  is  in  place,  it  is  poorly  maintained  and  unevenly  distributed  across \nurban  and  rural  areas.  Mountainside  soil  erosion  exacerbates  flooding  risks,  increasing  the \nsediment loads and threatening agricultural land downstream.  \n\n6. \nAs  Haidong  continues  to  grow,  public  services  in  urban  and  rural  areas  remain \ninadequate;  without  upgrades,  they  will  further  fail  to  meet  local  water  supply  and  solid  waste \ndisposal  needs.  The  steep  terrain  surrounding  Haidong  has  led  to  the  development  of  small \nvillages in the mountains, including minority villages, which will suffer socially and economically \nif public service investments remain unbalanced between rural and urban areas. \n \n7. \nStrategic  fit.  The  proposed  project  is  closely  aligned with both the  PRC  government\u2019s \npriorities and the  country  strategy  and  operations  of the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB). The \nPRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, the National New-type Urbanization Plan (2014), \nand  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country  partnership  strategy,  2016\u20132020,  support  strategic  priorities,  in  the \nareas  of  urban  and  environmental  management.6 Key  thematic  areas  that  coincide  with  the \nproposed  project  include  (i)  strengthening  climate  resilience;  (ii) promoting  sustainable  use  of \nland  and  natural  resources;  (iii)  strengthening  water  security;  and  (iv)  promoting  integrated \nwater resource management, wetland protection, and afforestation. \n \n8. \nLessons  and  special  features. The project design incorporates lessons from previous \nADB-financed projects and studies.7 These cover the need for (i) an integrated approach to river \nrehabilitation,  including  structural  and  nature-based  measures;  (ii)  strong  leadership  and \ngovernance  in  urban  and  environmental  management;  and  (iii) better  coordinated  decision-\nmaking  on  integrated  water  resource  management.  These  lessons  are  reflected  in  several \ninnovative  and  special  features:  (i)  preparatory  in-depth  provincial,  local,  and  project-specific \nclimate risk and vulnerability assessments (CRVAs) to pinpoint and raise awareness of climate-\nrelated  risks,  and  build  ecosystem-friendly  adaptation  measures  into  the  design  of  various \ninfrastructure  components;  (ii)  reuse  of  treated  urban  wastewater  for  mountainside  forest \nirrigation, which will showcase an integrated approach to managing both water scarcity and soil \nerosion;  (iii) use  of  nature-based  measures  for  the  temporary  storage  of  floodwaters;  and \n(iv) institutional  strengthening  to  support  better  coordination  and  project  implementation  with \nregard to integrated water resource management.8 \n \nB. \n \n9. \nimpacts  will  be  enhanced  environmental  protection,  ecological \nrehabilitation, and climate change adaptation; and improved flood control standards and  urban \naesthetics  along  the  Huangshui  River  (footnotes  5\u20136).    The  intended  outcome  will  be  an \nimprovement in ecological and environmental services in Haidong.  \n\nImpacts and Outcome \n\nThe  expected \n\n                                                \n6  Government  of  the  PRC,  State  Council.  2015.

First,  the  rehabilitation  of  existing  and  the  addition  of  new  embankments \nalong the main Huangshui River channel will stabilize the riverbanks, securing both agricultural \nand  urban  land.  Based  on  the  CRVA,  climate-proofing  measures  were  incorporated  into  the \nproject design; the embankment heights were increased to accommodate the projected average \nincrease in flood flows (8%). Second, the establishment of a riverside greenbelt, including new \nvegetation  and  pedestrian  paths,  will  allow  for  public  space and  seasonal flood  water storage, \nthe \nimproving \ndevelopment of an ecological wetland park will rehabilitate existing wetlands and allow seasonal \nflooding while educating the public on environmental issues.  \n \nOutput  2  will  focus  on  controlling  soil  erosion  to  reduce  siltation  in  Huangshui  River, \n12. \npursue dust suppression, and set an urban growth boundary to protect the fragile mountainous \nlandscape  adjacent  to  Ping\u2019an  District\u2019s  urban  area.  Recognizing  the  increasing  local  water \nscarcity (identified in the CRVA), treated urban wastewater from the existing Ping\u2019an wastewater \ntreatment  plant  will  provide  irrigation  for  the  establishment  of  a  mountainside  forest.  Output  2 \nwill  have  two  components:  (i)  planting  new  vegetation  to  establish  a  mountainside  greenbelt; \nand  (ii)  expanding  the  irrigation  network  to  include  approximately  663  hectares  of  existing \nmountainside greenbelt using treated wastewater. The irrigation of these afforested areas with \nreused water has minimal impact on existing water resources while decreasing soil erosion.  \n \n13. \nOutput  3  will  focus  on  providing  critical  urban  and  rural  services;  it  will  contribute  to \nreducing water insecurity for rural and urban areas in Ping\u2019an District, as well as improving solid \nwaste treatment capacity for Ledu District. Output 3 will have two components: (i) building three \nwater  treatment  plants  and  new  conveyance  pipe  networks  for  raw  and  potable  water;  and \n(ii) adding  850,000  cubic  meters  of  capacity  to  the  Ledu  landfill  and  building  a  leachate \ntreatment  facility.  Based  on  the  CRVA,  climate-proofing  measures  include  providing  an \nalternative supply of drinking water to the Ping\u2019an urban area to reduce the water scarcity risk, \nand  increasing  drainage  and  leachate  collection  capacity  at  the  landfill  site.  The  provision  of \nbasic services to urban and rural areas aims to reduce the rural-urban infrastructure gap. \n \nOutput 4 will support consulting services, training, and equipment to boost the capacity \n14. \nof  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  for  (i)  project  implementation  and  operational \nmanagement,  (ii)  financial  management,  (iii)  landfill  operation  and  maintenance,  (iv) wetland \nand  forest  operation  and  maintenance,  (v)  flood  risk  management,  and  (vi) nonrevenue  water \nmanagement. The output will also contribute to institutional strengthening, promote cooperation \nand decision-making at the river basin level, and develop a water safety plan to mitigate water \ninsecurities  in  Haidong.  A  capacity  development  submodule  was  also  included  for  climate-\nresilient urban development planning and regional water resource management. \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n4 \n \n\nD. \n\n15. \n \n\nItem \nA.  \n\n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n  \nThe project is estimated to cost $234.3 million (Table 1).  \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\nBase Costb \n1.

A \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n6 \n \n\nCRVA  was  conducted  confirming  the  project\u2019s  medium  climate  risk  categorization. 10  Design \noptions  were  compared  before  selecting  the  best  possible  technologies  in  view  of  cost, \nenvironmental,  and  social  impacts.  Detailed  baseline  information  collected  from  topographic \nsurvey  data,  geotechnical  field  data,  detailed  hydrological  analysis,  and  detailed  hydraulic \nanalysis  was  applied  to  the  design  and  development  of  the  flood  mitigation  component.  The \nlandscape  components  (greenbelts  and  wetland  park)  incorporated  lessons  from  international \nand national best practice, and took into account local climatic and hydrological conditions. The \ncapacity-building  components  were  based  on  a  needs  assessment  for  the  successful \nimplementation and operation of project facilities.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic  analysis.  This  was  prepared  for  the  overall  project  and  for  individual \n21. \ncomponents  following  ADB  guidelines.11 Information  available  for  the  updated  subcomponents \nwas  verified  to  support  design  outcomes.  The  project  components  will  have  quantifiable  and \nnonquantifiable benefits such as avoided flood damage, increased forest cover and landscaping \nto maintain  the  balance of soil  and  water resources,  ecotourism  and  environmental  education, \nimproved irrigation and avoided water scarcity, sustainable rural and urban water supplies, more \nefficient  solid  waste  services  and  cleaner  environment,  and  reduced  health  risks.  The  present \nvalue  of  the  economic  benefits  is  CNY1,100.7  million,  while  economic  costs  amount  to \nCNY1,019.3 million, resulting in a benefit\u2013cost ratio of 1.1. The economic internal rate of return \nfor the individual components is: output 1 at 12.1%; output 2 at 12.1%; and output 3 at 15.4% \nfor  the  water  supply  subcomponent  and  23.8%  for  the  solid  waste  subcomponent.  For  the \noverall  project,  the  economic  rate  of  return  is  13.1%,  with  a  net  present  value  at  CNY70.2 \nmillion.  Based  on  the  sensitivity  analysis,  the  overall  project\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return \ncould fall below 12.0% in the event of investment cost overruns, a decrease in benefits, and a 1-\nyear delay in project implementation. \n \n The  project  will  have  nonquantifiable  benefits  such  as  a  better  microclimate,  greater \n22. \nbiodiversity, and higher market value of affected land. Likewise, food for bird, fish, and wildlife \nspecies  will  be  in  abundance  in  the  improved  habitat,  and  will  have  significance  in  species \npropagation. The large-scale project construction works will provide jobs during implementation \nand thereafter. The project will promote ecotourism and achieve joint development of upstream \nand  downstream  industry  chains  that  foster  economic  growth  in  the  communities  and \nsurrounding areas.     \n \nFinancial  analysis.  The  financial  sustainability  analysis  for  the  project  indicates  that \n23. \nHMG,  receiving  regular  budget  transfers  to  cover  its  expenditures,  has  sufficient  funds  to \nfinance the counterpart contributions during project implementation and to pay debt service and \noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs during operation. Average annual counterpart funding \naccounts  for  3.3%  of  projected  revenues,  or  0.4%  of  the  expenditures  of  HMG  during \nimplementation.  Annual  debt  service  and  project  O&M  costs  range  from  0.8%  to  1.0%  of \nprojected revenues  during  operations.  Under the direction  of  the  national  Thirteenth  Five-Year \nPlan  (footnote  6),  requirements  for  local  governments\u2019  counterpart  funds  will  be  reduced  or \nwaived for poor areas in the country engaged in domestic investment projects. This will alleviate \n\n                                                \n10 Climate  risks  were  assessed  (i)  at  regional  level  to  gauge  the  vulnerability  of  the  integrated  water  management \nplan  for  the  Huangshui  River  Basin;  and  (ii)  at  Haidong  City  level  to  evaluate  the  vulnerability  of  the  designs  of \nproposed project components and the water resource management elements of the Haidong City Master Plan. \n11 ADB.1999.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fsome of the fiscal burden on local governments\u2019 domestic investment projects and divert more \nresources to foreign-funded projects such as this project. \n\n \n24. \nFinancial evaluation of the three water treatment plants indicates that full cost recovery \nis  not  possible at reasonable  tariff assumptions, given  the  nature  of  low  revenue  collection  for \nrural water supply and the relatively small scale of the plants. To achieve a financial internal rate \nof  return  of  3.5%  for  the  water  supply  investment  component  (compared  with  the  weighted \naverage cost of capital of 2.3%), the water tariff for urban areas should be raised from CNY1.8 \nper cubic meter to CNY4.9 per cubic meter. If water tariffs are maintained at current levels and \nabout 23.0% of the investment cost of this component is included, the financial internal rate of \nreturn may reach 3.5%. However, full recovery of O&M costs can be achieved from the overall \ntariff revenue generated. The operating margin (estimated based on current tariff levels and full \nO&M  costs)  is  estimated  at  21.6%.  This  component  will  generate  a  positive  operating  margin \neven  with  a  10.0%  reduction  in  tariff  revenues  and  a  5.0%  increase  in  O&M  costs.  ADB\u2019s \ndecision  to  invest  in  this  component  is  based  on  the  benefits  of  bringing  safe  and  adequate \nwater  to  rural  populations  as  well  as  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  maintain  sound  fiscal \ncapacity to absorb project costs. \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\n25. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  its  Accountability \nMechanism  Policy  (2012)  were  explained  to  and  discussed  with  HMG.  A  procurement  risk \nassessment  of  HMG  and  the  project  management  office  (PMO)  confirmed  that  capacity  is \nadequate  with  assistance  of  a  procurement  agency  to  prepare  and  arrange  all  procurement \nactivities  according  to  the  PRC\u2019s  domestic  rules;  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as \namended from time to time); and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time). The specific policy requirements and measures are described in the PAM. \n \nA  financial  management  assessment  found  that  HMG  and  the  implementing  agencies\u2019 \n26. \nlack of knowledge of ADB financial management policies, lack of standardized procedures, and \ninadequate budget planning processes were the primary financial risks. Given the participation \nof Qinghai Provincial Government through Qinghai Finance Department, it is concluded that the \noverall  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  of  HMG  and  the  implementing  agencies  is \nmoderate to substantial. To mitigate these risks, an action plan was agreed with the PMO. With \nthese  measures  and  domestic  supervision,  the  financial  management  arrangements  are \nadequate.  The  specific  policy \nregarding \nprocurement and financial management are described in the PAM. \n\nrequirements  and  supplementary  measures \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n In  2015,  Haidong  had  a  poor  population  of  175,800  accounting  for  33.8%  of  the \n27. \nprovincial  poor  population.  Ping\u2019an  and  Ledu  districts  are  both  key  state-level  counties  for \ndevelopment-oriented poverty reduction. In 2014, Ping'an had 44 poor villages and 7,500 poor \npeople, and Ledu had 141 poor villages and 30,000 poor people. The poverty incidence of the \nproject area is 10.0%. \n \n28. \nThe  project  will  promote  the  sustainable  social  and  environmental  development  of \nHaidong\u2019s urban and rural areas. The project has a direct beneficiary population of 217,000 in \n180 villages  of  nine  townships  within  the  two  districts,  i.e.,  an  urban  population  of  152,000 \n(70.1%)  and  a  rural  population  of  65,000  (30.0%).  The  project  has  an  indirect  beneficiary \npopulation  of  205,600,  i.e.,  an  urban  population  of  26,900  (13.1%)  and  a  rural  population  of \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n8 \n \n\n178,700  (86.9%).  The  project  will  generate  135  skilled  and  404  unskilled  jobs  during \nconstruction  and  162  skilled  and  331  unskilled  jobs  during  operations.  The  PMO  and \nimplementing  agencies  provided  assurance  that  the  priority  for  employment  will  be  vulnerable \ngroups  such  as  women,  the  poor,  and  ethnic  minorities.  A  social  and  gender  action  plan  was \nprepared to ensure that the positive benefits of the project and programs will be conducted and \nsupported by output 4. These programs will particularly address the needs and risks for women \nand  children.  Social  and  gender  indicators  will  be  included  in  the  project  performance \nmanagement system and output 4 provides adequate consulting inputs on implementation and \nmonitoring.12 \n \n29. \nGender  benefits.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  It  will \nhave significant benefits for women because they are primarily responsible for water collection, \nsolid waste disposal, and related household activities. It will contribute to reducing the time and \neffort  spent  by  women  on  these  activities,  allowing  them  greater  participation  in  income-\ngenerating activities, leisure, or family entertainment. The social and gender action plan will help \nensure  that  (i)  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  project  is  increased,  including  a  target  for  at  least \n30.0% employment for women; (ii) up to 50.0% of participants in gender-sensitive environmental \nawareness  and  education  programs  on  water  saving,  solid  waste  recycling,  and  forest \nmanagement  are  women;  (iii)  at  least  30.0%  of  participants  in  capacity-building  activities  are \nwomen;  and  (iv)  gender  targets,  indicators,  and sex-disaggregated  data  for  project  monitoring \nand  evaluation  are  adequate.  International  and  national  social  development  specialists  with \ngender expertise will be provided under the capacity development output to ensure the effective \nimplementation of the social and gender action plan. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n30. \nEnvironment (category B). An initial environmental examination with an environmental \nmanagement plan was prepared in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) \nand disclosed on the ADB website.  The initial environmental examination incorporates findings \nof domestic environmental impact assessments and topical studies conducted under the project \npreparatory  technical  assistance. 13  Construction  will  cause  no  loss  of  valuable  ecology  or \nphysical cultural resources. Construction dust, noise, erosion, and local disruption to traffic and \ncommunities  will  be  temporary.  The  design  of  flood  mitigation  embankments  will  promote  the \nreestablishment of riverside habitats. Downstream afflux effects of flood mitigation works will be \nminor  and  manageable.  Strict  reservoir  operation  planning  will  ensure  drinking  and  irrigation \nwater security for the target rural communities as well as minimum environmental flows even in \ndry years. Landfill design, enforcement of buffer zone requirements, and operational control will \nminimize  impacts  on  environment  and  communities.  HMG  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall \nimplementation  and  compliance  with  the  environmental  management  plan.  Environmental \nmanagement  is  supported  by  capacity  development  and  institutional  strengthening  activities \nunder  output  4.  HMG  conducted  meaningful  consultation  with  potentially  affected  people  and \ncomplaints will be handled in accordance with the project\u2019s grievance redress mechanism. \n \n31. \nLand acquisition and resettlement (category A). One resettlement plan was prepared \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  project  will  need  to  acquire  a  total  area  of \n1,461  mu;  987  households  and  3,535  people  will  suffer  land  acquisition  impacts,  distributed \nacross  project  components.14 The  average  annual  income  loss  per  household  owing  to  land \n                                                \n12 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n13 Including  a  survey  of  wetland  resources,  biodiversity,  and  habitats  along  the  Huangshui  River  within  Haidong \n\nMunicipality; and a CRVA. \n\n14 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n\n \n\n\facquisition is estimated to be 16%; all households losing land opted for cash compensation, as \nfarming is not the main source of income. Also, 744 mu of collective land will be leased for the \nPing\u2019an  urban  riverside  greenbelt  component,  affecting  736  households  and  2,721  people. \nAbout  106.8  mu  will  be  occupied  temporarily,  affecting  145  households  with  423  people. \nCompensation rates for land acquisition and leasing are at replacement cost and are adequate \nfor  affected  persons\u2019  livelihood  restoration.  Meetings  with  district  officials and related  agencies \nrevealed that about 80% of cultivated land to be leased is of poor quality and has low production \nvalue  (less  than  CNY700  annually).  Consultation  results  indicated  that  villagers  prefer  land \nleasing  to  acquisition  because  they  can  receive  CNY1,040  in  annual  compensation  while \nretaining land-use rights. Upon the expiration of the 5-year lease term, the lease will be renewed \nat  an  updated  compensation  rate  based  on  the  government\u2019s  published  land  values.  The \nleasing  agreements  will  be  signed  between  affected  villages  and/or  affected  persons  and  the \ndistrict forestry bureau.  \n \n32. \nThe  resettlement  plan  was  disclosed  to  the  affected  people  and  posted  on  the  ADB \nwebsite in June 2016. During project implementation, HMG and the implementing agencies will \nestablish  a  proper  grievance  redress  mechanism,  allocate  resettlement  staff,  and  coordinate \nwith  relevant  government  departments  for  land  acquisition,  leasing,  and  income  restoration \nactivities.  HMG  has  committed  to  provide  adequate  and  timely  budget  for  land  acquisition, \nleasing, and resettlement costs; all compensation amounts and resettlement benefits to affected \npersons  will  be  distributed  prior  to  dispossession  of  land  or  livelihood.  HMG  and  the \nimplementing  agencies  will  conduct  internal  monitoring  and  report  on  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement activities in project progress reports. HMG and the implementing agencies will also \nengage  an  external  monitor  for  semiannual  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  resettlement  plan \nimplementation; these reports will be forwarded directly to the PMO and ADB.  \n \n33. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  B).  The  four  counties  in  Haidong  are  minority \nautonomous counties; the local population includes 18 ethnic minorities. In 2014, Haidong had a \nminority  population  of  618,500,  accounting  for  44.3%  of  official  city  residents;  among  these,  a \nHui population of 273,700 (19.0%), a Tibetan population of 132,400 (9.2%), and a Tu population \nof 115,000 (8.0%). Within the direct project areas, ethnic minorities comprise about 10.0% of the \npopulation.  Of  these,  10,054  Hui  people  (4.6%  of  direct  beneficiaries)  and  4,192  Tibetans \n(1.9%),  together  with  Menggu  and  Tu,  will  benefit  from  better  access  to  public  services  and \nenjoy  the  improved  living  environment.  While  most  of  the  minority  populations  in  the  direct \nproject  area  are  scattered  throughout  Ledu  and  Ping\u2019an  districts,  Shihuiyao  Xiang  County \ncontains  three  Tibetan  villages  with  a  concentrated  total  minority  population  of  370  that  will \nbenefit from rural water supply.  \n \n34. \nAn ethnic minority development plan (EMDP) was prepared and focuses on measures to \nfacilitate  the  inclusion  of  ethnic  minorities  in  all  project  activities,  and  to  ensure  that  their \ncustoms  and  beliefs  are  respected throughout  project  implementation. Two key  targets for  the \nEMDP  are  for  15%  of  jobs  going  to  the  poor  and  ethnic  minorities,  and  50%  of  those \nparticipating in the public awareness program are ethnic minorities. The EMDP was disclosed to \nethnic minorities in the areas targeted by the project. EMDP implementation and monitoring is \nsupported  under  output 4.  Monitoring  and  reporting  arrangements  for  the  ethnic  minority \nsafeguard are included in the PAM and the project agreement. \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n10 \n \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n35.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 15 The  overall  risk  level  is  medium.  The \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh costs and risks. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nin \n\nRisks \nOrganizational  and \nfinancial\u2014lack  of  overall \ncapacity  to  manage  the  project  in  the  areas  of \ninteragency  coordination,  proper  governance,  and \nprocurement   \n\nMitigating Measures \nTraining has been, and will continue to be, provided to  HPMO \nand the implementing agencies in (i) procurement, (ii) financial \nmanagement,  (iii)  and  O&M.
