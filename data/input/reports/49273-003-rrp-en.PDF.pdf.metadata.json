The Project finances subloans to qualified SMEs \nthrough the PFIs. \n \nThe  ongoing  project\u2019s  impact  will  be  employment  opportunities  in  SMEs  increased.7 Its \n3. \noutcome  will  be  SMEs\u2019  access to finance  strengthened. The  ongoing  project  has the following \noutputs:  (i)  financing  to  SMEs  through  formal  intermediaries  increased;  (ii)  innovative  SME \nfinancing  schemes  developed;  (iii)  capacity  of  SMEs  in  targeted  clusters  to  access  financial \nservices enhanced; and (iv) international competitiveness of the information and communication \ntechnology (ICT)-business process outsourcing (BPO) cluster strengthened.  \n\n \n4. \nThe ongoing project is on track to achieve its outcome of strengthened SMEs\u2019 access to \nfinance;  has  been  satisfactory  on  implementation  progress;  has  consistently  surpassed  its \ndevelopment  targets  of  lending  to  subborrowers  outside  Colombo,  first  time  borrowers  and  to \nwomen-led  SMEs;  has  complied  with  safeguard  policy  requirements;  and  has  successfully \nmanaged risks. \n\n                                                 \n1  This amount includes $9,500,000 million to provide grants for principal paydown support to eligible women-led SMEs \n\nand $665,000 of administrative fee for ADB.  \n\n2  We-Fi was launched on 12 October 2017 as an international financial intermediary fund to address financial and \nnonfinancial constraints faced by women-led small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries. \nIt aims to mobilize more than $1.0 billion in financing from international financial institutions and the private sector. \nWe-Fi is governed by a Governing Committee comprising 14 founding contributing countries that have committed \nover $340 million to date and is administered by a secretariat at the World Bank. \n\n3  The proposed increase in the budget and change in scope of the TA are described in Appendix 2 (Attached Technical \n\nAssistance). \n\n4  ADB.  2016.

Vision 2025: A Country Enriched. Colombo.  \n\n \n \n\n\f2 \n\nADB has disbursed 100% of the $100.0 million SME line of credit approved in 2016. For \n5. \nthe $75.0 million additional financing approved in January 2018, the government has submitted a \nwithdrawal request for $25.0 million, and this first allocation is expected to disburse by 30 June \n2018.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE ADDITIONAL FINANCING \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n6. \nThe  first  additional  financing  to  the  ongoing  project  was  approved  by  the  Board  on  15 \nJanuary  2018,  and  the  proposed  We-Fi  financing  materialized  only  after  such  approval.  The \nongoing project is performing well and the proposed We-Fi additional financing will be used to \nexpand the gender dimensions of the Project.  \n  \n7. \nWomen-led SMEs face significant barriers for access to finance. The International Finance \nCorporation  has  identified  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  gender  gap  in  micro,  small,  and  medium  enterprise \nfinancing at $350 million. The Government of Sri Lanka has prioritized financial inclusion for SMEs. \nThe 2018\u20132022 Country Partnership Strategy identified SME financing as an area of focus.8 \n \n8. \nThe We-Fi grant funding increases the ongoing project\u2019s benefit to women-led SMEs in \nSri Lanka by improving access to finance for underserved women-led SMEs through a $9,500,000 \ngrant for principal paydown support.  \n\n \n\nImpact, Outcome, and Outputs  \n\nB. \n \n9. \nImpact  and  outcome.  The We-Fi-funded  second  additional  financing  will  enhance  the \ngender dimensions of the ongoing project, as the We-Fi funded additional financing component \nis categorized as Gender Equity as a Theme (GEN), an upgrade from the ongoing project which \nwill  remain  categorized  as  Effective  Gender  Mainstreaming  (EGM).  The  impact  of  the  overall \nproject including the We-Fi additional financing will remain increased employment opportunities \nin  SMEs. 9 The  outcome  will  remain  strengthened  SMEs\u2019  access  to  finance.  With  the  We-FI \nadditional financing, at least $27.1 million of blended financing support, from both the We-Fi grant \nand the ongoing project, will be provided to women-led SMEs by 2020. Additional gender targets \nhave  been  included  in  the  Design  and  Monitoring  Framework  (DMF)  to  reflect  the  project\u2019s \nenhanced gender focus through the We-Fi financing.10 \n \nOutputs.11 The  ongoing  project\u2019s  outputs  including  financing  to  SMEs  through  formal \n10. \nintermediaries increased (Output 1), innovative SME financing schemes developed (Output 2), \nand international competitiveness of ICT-BPO cluster strengthened (Output 4) will remain largely \nunchanged.  \n \n11.  With  the  first  additional  financing  of  $75,000,000,  Output  (3)  has  been  expanded  to \nenhanced capacity of all SMEs to access financial services. With the proposed increase in the \namount  and  scope  of  the  attached  TA  to  be  grant-financed  by We-Fi,  at  least  250  actual  and \npotential  women  entrepreneurs  from  SMEs  across  all  industries  will  be  trained  in  business \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB.  2017.

Activities \nenvisaged to achieve these outputs include gap assessment and development plan on gender \npolicies and processes for PFIs, government agencies, and civil society organizations; a policy \npaper  on  women  entrepreneurship  in  Sri  Lanka;  rigorous  impact  evaluation;  and  development \ncommunications strategy. See Appendix 1 for revised DMF.  \n \nC. \n \n13. \nA call for gender-focused SME project proposals was made by the We-Fi Secretariat on \n11 October 2017, with a submission deadline of 15 December 2017. A grant project proposal was \ndeveloped to complement the ongoing project because of its strong track record and focus on \nwomen  entrepreneurship.  On  19  April  2018,  the  Governing  Committee  officially  approved  the \nproject proposal and awarded a grant, based on the ongoing project\u2019s track record,12 government \nownership, and availability of data that began during the ongoing project.13 \n \n14. \nInvestment and financing plans. The ongoing project includes the $100,000,000 original \nproject and $75,000,000 of first additional financing. With the proposed We-Fi additional financing \ngrant, the total project cost is estimated to be $185,165,000.

See also para. 4 and para. 5. \n\n13 The  proposal  was  one  of  the  three  successful proposals  out  of  the  seven  submitted by  multilateral  development \n\nbanks and was the sole single-country proposal approved. \n14 $10.165 million includes ADB\u2019s administrative fee of $665,000. \n15 After the completion of the seventh funding round, ADB will decide, in consultation with the government, on the use \nof any unused grant funds under the principal paydown component. Priority of uses for any such remaining funds will \nbe another SME project in Sri Lanka, an SME project in another SARD country, or blending with funds from the PFIs. \n\n\f4 \n\nTable 2: Schedule of Fund Allocation \nSixth Funding Round \n(September 2018) \n$25.00 million \n$3.17 million \n$28.17 million \n\nFifth Funding Round \n \n(March 2018) \nItem \n$25.00 million \nAvailable credit line \n$3.17 millionb \nAvailable We-Fi granta \n$28.17 million \nTotal \nWe-Fi = Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative. \na ADB will add any funds not allocated in the fifth or sixth round to the subsequent round. \nb For the fifth round of funding, decisions on allocation requests made for We-Fi grant funding for eligible women-led \nSME subborrowers will be made in June 2018. \n\nSeventh Funding Round \n(March 2019) \n\n$25.00 million \n$3.17 million \n$28.17million \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n16. \nImplementation arrangements. The We-Fi grant will be implemented from June 2018 to \n31 December 2019. The grant project and the current project will have the same executing agency, \nthe Ministry of Finance and Mass Media. The We-Fi grant will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).  \n \nThe government will disburse $9,500,000 of the We-Fi grant for principal paydown support \n17. \nin  local  currency  equivalent  through  PFIs.  The  PFIs  will  then  provide  the  grants  for  principal \npaydown support to eligible women-led SMEs. Women-led SMEs eligible for the We-Fi funded \n20% principal paydown grant support must meet the following criteria:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nat  least  51%  of  the  enterprise  ownership  is  controlled  by  women,  or  meets  the \nbelow three criteria: \n(a) \n(b) \n\nat least 20% of the enterprise ownership is controlled by women; \na woman is either the chief executive officer (i.e., senior most manager) or \nchief operations officer (i.e., second most senior manager); and  \n30% of the board members are women, where a board exists. \n\n(c) \nThe loan principal is at least Rs750,000.16  \n\n \n18. \nThe We-Fi grant will also finance eligible women-led SME borrowers for an additional: (i) \n10% principal paydown of individual loan if they complete the associated training, and (ii) 5% of \nprincipal  paydown  of  individual  loan  if  women-led  subborrowers  are  accessing  finance  for \neconomic activity in the regions within the Uva, Sabaragamuwa, Northern, and Eastern provinces. \nWe-Fi  grant  financing  for  eligible  women-led  SMEs  is,  cumulatively,  subject  to  a  ceiling  of \nRs17,500,000 for each individual loan transaction contingent on the conditions set out above.  \n \nAssurances.

The administration of a technical assistance (TA) grant in the \n1. \namount of $2,000,000 was approved on 15 February 2016 for an attached TA to SRI: Small and \nMedium-Sized  Enterprises  Line  of  Credit  Project  (the  Project).  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost \n$2,000,000,  of  which  $2,000,000  is  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty \nReduction (JFPR) and administered by ADB. \n  \n2. \nThe  TA  comprises  the  following  two  components:  Component  1  (administration  of  the \nauction system and study of the introduction of an SME credit guarantee scheme in Sri Lanka) \nwould  support  the  Project\u2019s  output  2  (innovative  SME  financing  schemes  developed);  and \nComponent  2  (development  of  three  industry  clusters).  Component  2  would  support  business \ndevelopment  and  financial  services  for  female  entrepreneurs  in  all  three  industry  clusters  to \nsupport the Project\u2019s output 3 (capacity of SMEs in targeted clusters to access financial services \nenhanced)  and  would  support  branding  and  promotion  of  female  participation  in  the  ICT-BPO \ncluster  to  support  the  project\u2019s  output  4  (international  competitiveness  of  ICT-BPO  cluster \nstrengthened).  \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Mass  Media  (MOF)  is  the  executing  agency.  MOF\u2019s \n3. \nDepartment of Development Finance is the implementing agency for Component 1 and the Export \nDevelopment  Board  (EDB)  is  the  implementing  agency  for  Component  2.  The  TA  was  made \neffective 27 April 2016 and is expected to be completed on 30 June 2020.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe  TA  is  on  track  for  completion  by  June  2020.  All  the  activities  envisaged  under \nComponent 1 has been completed. About half of the activities designed to be conducted under \nComponent 2 has been completed. Other key initiatives such as the training of 500 actual and \npotential female entrepreneurs in targeted sectors, and the facilitation of the participation of at \nleast 500 women in career events on working in the ICT-BPO cluster is ongoing and on-track for \ncompletion by the TA\u2019s current completion date of 30 June 2020. Of the $2,000,000, $1,880,000 \nhas been contracted and $778,000 has been disbursed. See Attachment 3 for progress of TA \nimplementation.  \n  \nC.  Proposed Changes in TA Scope and Implementation  \n \n5. \nA $2,386,800 increase in the TA amount to be financed on a grant basis by the Women \nEntrepreneurs  Finance  Initiative  (We-Fi)  and  a  minor  change  in  scope  and  implementation \narrangements are proposed for the TA to support the enhancement of the gender dimensions of \nthe  ongoing  project  and  the We-Fi  grant.  These  will  upgrade  the  gender  categorization  of  the \nproject from Effective Gender Mainstreaming (EGM) to Gender Equity as a theme (GEN). The \nwider  gender  dimensions  will  benefit  women-led  SMEs  in  Sri  Lanka  through  four  major \ncomponents:  \n \n\nCurrent Status of TA Implementation Arrangements \n\n(i) \n\nComponent  1:  Access  to  finance  for  underserved  women-led  SMEs \nimproved. The TA will support the project\u2019s output 1 (financing to SMEs through \nformal  intermediaries  increased).  At  least  7  out  of  10  of  the  ongoing  project\u2019s \nparticipating financial institutions (PFIs) will complete a gender gap assessment of \ntheir policies, products and processes, and have introduced new gender-inclusive \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n13 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\npolicies, products and processes to better serve women-led SME borrowers. \nComponent  2:  Gender-inclusive  policies  and  regulatory  frameworks, \nbusiness  practices,  and  networks  strengthened.  The  TA  will  support  the \nproject\u2019s output 5 (gender-inclusive policy and regulatory framework and support \nenhanced). At least 3 government agencies and 2 civil society organizations are \nto develop action plans to support women entrepreneurship leveraging on findings \nfrom gender gap needs assessment.  \nComponent  3:  Business  capacity  of  women-led  SMEs  enhanced.  This \ncomponent of the TA will increase support for the project\u2019s output 3 (capacity of \nSMEs to access financial services enhanced) and the ongoing TA\u2019s component 2 \n(gender-inclusive  policies  and  regulatory  frameworks,  business  practices,  and \nnetworks  strengthened).  In  addition  to  the  women  entrepreneurs  from  selected \nindustries  identified  for  capacity  building  in  the  TA,  at  least  an  additional  250 \npotential  and  existing  women  entrepreneurs from  all  industries  will  be  trained  in \nbusiness  development  and  management.  Further,  at \nleast  450  women \nentrepreneurs  will  be  registered  on  the  online  learning  and  development,  and \nmentoring platform.  \nComponent  4:  Evidence  base  on  women  entrepreneurship  strengthened. \nThis TA component will support the overall project\u2019s output 6 (evidence base on \nwomen  entrepreneurship  strengthened).  Focus  group  discussions  and  one \nrigorous  impact  evaluation  including  baseline  and  endline  surveys  will  be \nundertaken. Further, a policy paper on the challenges to women entrepreneurship \nin Sri Lanka will be submitted to the SME steering committee. At least four success \nstories of women-led SMEs that have benefitted from We-Fi grant financing will be \ndocumented.  At  least  4  national  and  regional  seminars  in  total  will  be  held  to \ndisseminate  findings  to  inform  future  policymaking  on  women  entrepreneurship \ndevelopment. \n\n \nImplementation  arrangements.  The  TA  completion  date  is  proposed  to  be  extended \n6. \nfrom 30 June 2020 to 14 February 2021. ADB will administer the We-Fi-funded grant, similar to \nthe  current  arrangements  for  the  current  TA.  All  procurement  of  goods  and  services,  and \nprocurement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time \nto time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions.  \n\n \n7. \nThe Ministry of Finance and Mass Media will continue to be the executing agency of this \nscaled-up TA. MOF\u2019s Department of Development Finance will be the implementing agency for \nthe  We-Fi-funded  components  1,  2,  and  4  of  the  TA.  The  National  Enterprise  Development \nAuthority (NEDA) will be the implementing agency for the We-Fi-funded component 3 (business \ncapacity of women-led SMEs enhanced) of this TA.  \n \nConsulting  services.  ADB  will  engage  the  consultants  and  carry  out  procurement \n8. \nfollowing the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated \nproject administration instructions and/or staff instructions. Consultants will procure the necessary \nworks and goods as applicable.  \n   \n9. \nADB  will  recruit  one  individual  consultant  to  be  financed  by  the We-Fi  grant  and  to  be \nbased in the Sri Lanka Resident Mission as project manager. A time-based contract will be used \nfor the  individual  consultant.  ADB  will  also  recruit  2 consulting firms:  one for TA  output  3,  and \nanother for TA outputs 1, 2, and 4. The 2 consulting firms will be recruited using the quality- and \ncost-based selection method with a standard technical-finance evaluation cost ratio of 90:10. An \noutput-based (lumpsum) contract will be used for the 2 consulting firms.

The \ndisbursement arrangement will be on a cost-sharing basis. \n\n1)  The implementing agency will identify either a government agency \nor a civil society organization to assume responsibility to moderate \nthe online learning and development platform upon TA completion.  \n\n2)  The consulting firm will turnover the tablets, purchased to conduct \nthe baseline and endline surveys, to ADB upon TA completion.  \n\nIncrease in the TA Amount \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n10. \nDue diligence. The ADB-administered additional financing grant TA will leverage on the \ndue  diligence  conducted  for  the  ongoing  project  including  that  of  the  PFIs\u2019  financial  strength, \npoverty and social, and safeguards aspects.  \n \nD. \n \nThe  current  budget  of  the  TA  is  proposed  to  be  increased  by  $2,386,800  of  which \n11. \n$2,386,800 will be financed on a grant basis by We-Fi. Of the $2,386,800, $2,244,0001 will be for \nthe TA components and $142,800 will be administrative fees2 for ADB. The disbursement of TA \nfinancing will be on a cost-sharing basis. See Attachment 1 for cost estimates and financing plan.  \n \nE. \n \n12. \nThe change in scope and implementation arrangements are considered minor as these \ndo  not  substantially  affect  the  TA\u2019s  outcome,  components,  benefits,  or  implementation \narrangements. The  ongoing  project  being  supported  is  low  risk. The  current TA  is  on-track for \ncompletion. Comments from Controller\u2019s Department, the Office of Cofinancing Operations, the \nOffice  of  the  General  Counsel,  and  the  Procurement,  Portfolio  and  Financial  Management \nDepartment have been incorporated and are listed in the attached matrix. \n \n\nStaff Views  \n\n                                                 \n1 This amount includes a 10% contingency.  \n2  This figure represents 7% of the amount required for the additional TA components excluding the 10% contingency. \nADB\u2019s administrative fee covers organizational costs in administering the We-Fi grant-financed program, following \nstandard ADB procedures. The fee is divided as per the following: 65% for general management costs (administrative \ncosts and legal administration) and 35% for project management costs by HQ project team.  \n\n\fREVISED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n \n\nItem \nI.
