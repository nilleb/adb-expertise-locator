JFS will use the proceeds of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfunding to finance microfinance loans, predominately loans to women customers under the joint \nliability  group  (JLG)  model,  as  well  as  other  small  loans  to  individuals  and  micro  and  small \nenterprises. Up to 5% of the ADB facility will be specifically dedicated to loans for building and \nimproving sanitation facilities (e.g., toilets and septic tanks) throughout India.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nEconomy. Real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at an average annual rate of \n7.8% from FY2005 to FY2015, helping the country reduce poverty from 37.2% in FY2005 to 21.9% \nin FY2012.1 Although India weathered the global financial crisis relatively well, growth slackened \nduring FY2012\u2013FY2014 as a result of tighter monetary policy to counter persistently high inflation, \nlack of consensus on some policy and regulatory issues, and the adverse effects of a decrease \nin  global  demand.2 Growth  rebounded  during  FY2015,  helped  by  increased  political  certainty, \nseveral policy actions, lower commodity (oil and non-oil) import prices, improved business and \nconsumer confidence, and reduced external vulnerabilities. GDP growth was 7.3% for FY2015. \nStable policy, lower commodity prices, increasing government spending on infrastructure while \nmaintaining the fiscal deficit and a supportive monetary policy are expected to boost real GDP \ngrowth to 7.4% in FY2016 and 7.8% in FY2017. The Indian economy is expected to grow by 8.0% \nover the next 5 years. However, the sustainability of high growth rates will depend on continuing \nto  address  supply-side  bottlenecks  and  structural  challenges  through  legislative  changes  and \npolicy implementation.3    \n \n3. \nFinancial  sector  overview.  The  Indian  financial  sector  is  still  developing  with  banks \ndominating  the  sector.  As  of  December  2015,  there  were  214  banks,  including  147 scheduled \ncommercial banks. As of 31 December 2015, the total deposits of all scheduled commercial banks \nstood  at  Rs91.3  trillion  and  total  credit  stood  at  Rs69.9  trillion. 4  As  of  the  end  of  FY2015 \n(FYE2015), 11,842 nonbank finance companies (NBFCs) were registered with the Reserve Bank \nof India (RBI), with total assets of Rs14.6 trillion (for NBFCs with assets of Rs1 billion and above).5 \nNotwithstanding  the  size  of  the  financial  sector  and  the  significant  strides  the  government  is \nmaking in this sector, including the successful Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana scheme (Prime \nMinister\u2019s  People  Money  Scheme) 6 ,  access  to  credit  in  India  remains  a  key  issue.  Gross \nnonperforming assets (NPAs) for the banking sector (according to the RBI\u2019s definition) worsened \nfrom 3.5% in FY2013 to 4.6% in FY2015 and 5.1% as of 30 September 2015. Loans undergoing \nrestructuring  also  increased  during  the  same  period,  rising  from  5.5%  to  6.2%.  The  capital \nadequacy ratio of the banking sector declined from 14.0% in FY2013 to 12.7% as of 30 September \n2015. The gross NPAs for the NBFC sector increased from 1.5% in FY2013 to 3.4% in FY2015 \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2015.

As of 31 December 2015, the microfinance sector in India \nhas provided microcredit to close to 28.8 million customers through 9,503 branches across the \ncountry,  disbursing  25.1  million  loans  amounting  to  $6.2  billion  (average  loan  size  of \napproximately $261). During FY2012\u2013FY2015, the sector had a compound annual growth rate \n(CAGR) of 44.9% in disbursements and a 40.8% CAGR in the gross loan portfolio. Strong growth \ncontinued  over  the  first  9  months  of  FY2016,  with  disbursements  rising  by  72.2%,  while  the \naggregate  gross  loan  portfolio  growth  increased  by  75.6%  over  the  previous  year. 8 CRISIL \nResearch, a ratings agency, expects the aggregate microfinance institution (MFI) loan portfolio to \ngrow  by  30.0%\u201334.0%  annually  over  the  next  5 years.  Problem  loans among  MFIs  decreased \nquite significantly from 2.32% in FY2012 to 0.25% in FY2015 for 30 days past due.9 More recently, \nhowever, portfolio at risk for 30 days (PAR 30) rose slightly to 0.42% as of 31 December 2015 \nagainst 0.38% as of 31 December 2014. CRISIL Research expects the profitability of MFIs to fall \nmarginally in relation to earlier years because of the introduction of caps on lending rates.10 The \nnet profit margin for the sector is expected to fall from 3.6% to 3.3% during FY2014-FY2017.11 In \nSeptember 2015, to promote financial inclusion and access to credit, the RBI awarded in-principle \nsmall finance bank (SFB) licenses to 10 applicants, of which eight were MFIs. The awardees have \n18 months to comply with the various requirements and start banking operations.  \n \n5. \nRationale.  Access  to  finance  in  India  remains  a  key  issue,  with  47.0%  of  people \nunbanked. Access to credit is even more limited, with less than 14.0% of borrowers accessing \ncredit  through  formal  channels.12 Given  the  continued  need  to  address  access  to  finance  and \naccess to credit issues for many customer segments in India, ADB has sought to identify financial \ninstitution  partners  that  have  demonstrated  the  ability  to  reach  underbanked  segments  on  a \nprofitable  and  sustainable  basis.  JFS\u2019s  deep  understanding  of  its  customer  segments  and \ncomprehensive  underwriting  systems  have  enabled  it  to  maintain  solid  asset  quality  and \nprofitability while achieving above industry average growth rates. The proposed transaction seeks \nto  support  JFS\u2019s  growth  as  it  transitions  into  a  pan-India  (urban  and  rural)  SFB  and  looks  to \ndiversify and increase the tenor of its liabilities, while it builds its deposit franchise, and in doing \nso, support JFS as it furthers its mandate of financial inclusion, in line with Government of India \nprograms. The proposed transaction also seeks to support the development and deployment of \nsanitation  loans  that  complement  the  government\u2019s  sanitation  initiatives.  More  than  53.0%  of \nhouseholds in India do not have a household toilet and over 50.0% of the population defecates in \nopen  spaces.  In  addition  to  the  spread  of  disease  and  various  health  issues  across the  wider \npopulation  that  result  from  mismanagement  of  waste,  women  are  particularly  affected\u2014as \nevidenced by girl school dropout rates and the heightened risk of sexual molestation and violence \n\n                                                \n7  RBI. 2015.

It introduced these caps in February 2014, replacing the previous overall \ninterest rate cap of 26%. Small finance banks (SFBs) do not need to adhere to these margin caps.   \n\n11 CRISIL Research. 2014. Tailwinds gather for rural banking rebound. November. Mumbai. \n12 World Bank. 2015.

The level of unbanked people in India has \ndeclined from 65% in 2011 following the launch by the Government of India of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana \nscheme, which aims to open 100 million bank accounts for poor families; as of 6 April 2016, more than 215 million \naccounts have been opened under the scheme. \n\n2 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy  \n\nwhen relieving  themselves at  night  or  dawn in unsafe locations.

Founded  in  2000  as  an  offshoot  of  the  Sanhamithra  Urban  Program,  an \nincubated  microfinance  initiative,  JFS  is  currently  India\u2019s  largest  NBFC-MFI,  providing  market-\nbased financial services to underserved customers in urban India. With a diversified presence in \n18 states throughout the country, reaching over 3.8 million customers in 331 Jana Centres and \n50 Jana Pragati Centres, JFS had assets under management of over $1.7 billion as of the end of \nMarch 2016.13 JFS is assisted in this effort by Jana Urban Foundation, its (Section 8) nonprofit \nholding  company,  which  undertakes  client-centric  analytical  research  activities  that  deepen \nunderstanding of the challenges of financial inclusion. In line with JFS\u2019s long-term strategic focus \nof developing a platform to provide a full range of financial products and services for the urban \npoor,  the  RBI  awarded  JFS  an  in-principle  SFB  license  in  September  2015.  Under  RBI \nregulations, SFBs are allowed to undertake normal banking operations, including deposit taking, \nbut  are  mandated  to focus on  smaller  inclusive loans,  with at  least  50.0%  of the  loan  portfolio \nconstituting  loans  of  less  than  $37,000  and  a  minimum  of  75.0%  of  the  loan  portfolio  directed \ntoward priority sector lending (against 40.0% for standard banks). JFS is expected to be awarded \nthe final license and commence banking operations in July 2016.   \n \n7. \nJFS  has  two  core  business  units:  Retail  Financial  Services  and  Enterprise  Financial \nServices.14 As part of its transition to an SFB, it will add two additional business lines: Payments-\nPlus and Inclusions-Adjacencies (Table 1).  \n \n\nTable 1: Janalakshmi Financial Services Business Lines \n\nBusiness Line \nRetail Financial Services \n\nEnterprise Financial \nServices \n\nPayment-Plus \n\nInclusions-Adjacencies  \n(Other Businesses) \n\nDescription \nRetail financial services include such loan products as micro loans to JLGs (small \nbatch); loans used for education, housing, and home improvement; and loans to \nindividuals that have graduated from the group loan structure to support working \ncapital, and capital investment needs for their businesses (Nano Loan). JFS also \noffers retail fee based products such as micro pensions, reloadable prepaid cards, \nand a goal-based savings plan. \nEnterprise financial services offer loan products to MSMEs for working capital and \ninvestment needs, such as the purchase of machinery. JFS also offers the Super \nNano Loan to customers that have graduated from the individual Nano Loan cycle.  \nThis vertical will focus on providing products and fee-based services involving \ndigital payment processes. \nPublic finance vertical that will finance sustainable urban infrastructure projects in \nfields  viewed  as  integral  to  inclusion  such  as  sanitation  or  waste  management \nservices,  affordable  housing  development,  and  renewable  energy.  Also  rural \nfinance. \n\nJFS = Janalakshmi Financial Services, JLG = joint liability group. \nSource: Janalakshmi Financial Services. \n \n8. \nBusiness  strategy.  Driven  by  its  long-term  strategy  to  develop  a  scalable  platform  to \nservice the financial  needs of the  urban poor  by  offering  the  complete value  chain  of financial \nproducts  and  services,  JFS  has  formulated  successive  business  plans  that  focus  on  this  core \n\n                                                \n13 JFS branches are well distributed across the southern (27%), northern (29%), western (27%), and eastern (17%) \n\nstates of India. \n\n14 It is compulsory for all JFS borrowers to obtain life insurance for the period of the loan. All housing loan customers \nare required to participate in a group property insurance plan and all livestock loan customers must obtain livestock \ninsurance. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\n \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\nobjective. The foundations for  JFS\u2019s  establishment  were  laid out  in its  Jana 1.0  Strategic  Plan \n(2005\u20132009), as the company initiated operations as a microfinance provider. Initially focusing on \nproviding group microfinance lending under the JLG scheme, central to JFS\u2019s evolution has been \nthe interconnection of three key factors: technology, human capital, and communication.15 JFS\u2019s \nJana  2.0  Strategic  Plan  (2010\u20132014)  focused  on  expanding  the  range  of  its  product  offerings \nbeyond  JLG-based  microfinance  loans,  as  well  as  scaling  its  operations  by  expanding  its \ngeographical footprint to the national level. Under the Jana 3.0 Strategic Plan (2014\u20132015), JFS \nsought to enhance the capacity of the pillars of its foundation\u2014technology, human capital, and \ncommunication\u2014given  the  rapid expansion  of  its  operations  in terms  of  both product  offerings \nand its distribution network. On all three fronts, JFS has partnered with leading global institutions \n(including  Accenture  and IBM)  to  obtain the  expertise  needed  to  advance  JFS\u2019s  mandate  and \noperational capacity. With the awarding of its in-principle SFB license, JFS\u2019s Jana 4.0 Strategic \nPlan  (2015 to present)  refines  the core building blocks  of  its  operating model  as  the  company \ntransitions.  \n \nC. \n \n9. \nOwnership. Integrity due diligence has been conducted on JFS in accordance with the \nIntegrity Due Diligence Guidelines for Nonsovereign Operations.16The largest single shareholding \nin JFS (20.54%) is held by Jana Urban Foundation, a nonprofit organization, which will change to \nJana  Holdings  Limited  in  August  2016.  In  light  of  new  regulations  allowing  JFS  to  become  an \nSFB, JFS is now creating a three-tiered structure similar to other SFBs because of limitations on \nforeign ownership. JFS\u2019s founder, Ramesh Ramanathan and his family\u2019s shares are held by Jana \nUrban Foundation. Seven private equity funds hold about 73.63% of JFS\u2019s shares, of which four \nfunds are established by large institutional investors\u2014Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, TPG Capital, \nand Tata Capital.  \n \n10. \nThe private equity funds holding shares in JFS in Singapore and Mauritius are typical for \nfunds  investing  in  India,  since  India  has  a  double  taxation  avoidance  agreement  with  both \nMauritius  and  Singapore.  Both  of  these  jurisdictions  are  rated  as  largely  compliant  with  the \ninternational  tax  standard  of  exchange  of  information  on  request  by  the  Global  Forum  on \nTransparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes. Citigroup\u2019s funds incorporated in \nMauritius are held through funds established in the Cayman Islands and Jersey. India does not \nhave double taxation agreements with the Cayman Islands and Jersey, but none of the countries \nis listed by the Financial Action Task Force as a strategically deficient jurisdiction. None of the \nultimate beneficial owners of the private equity funds have been identified, as the private equity \nfunds are well established in jurisdictions not identified to be deficient or noncompliant. JFS relies \non the  reputation  of these funds for  the  investments.  ADB  is  not  in  a  position  to  obtain further \ndetails of the funds, to identify these ultimate beneficial owners, or to consider if tax exchange \nagreements are in place for the relevant jurisdiction. ADB\u2019s review of the funds does not give ADB \ncause to believe that it has been established, or is being used for cross-border tax evasion, money \nlaundering, or terrorism financing in the jurisdictions involved in the project. Integrity due diligence \nfindings indicated that a politically exposed person is an independent member of the BOD, but \ntheir  involvement  does  not  appear  to  pose  any  integrity  risk.  Other  information  related  to  the \nprivate  equity  fund  investors  and  investment  bank  general  partners  was  discovered  during \nintegrity due diligence, but nothing was outside of the normal course of business and nothing was \nproject related. Due diligence did not find any apparent significant or potentially significant integrity \nissues. \n\n                                                \n15 A joint liability group  is an informal group of between 10 to 20 members (typically women), coming together for the \n\npurposes of taking out bank loan either singly or through a group mechanism against a mutual guarantee. \n\n16 http://www.adb.org/documents/integrity-principles-and-guidelines. \n\n\f \n\n \n11. \nCorporate governance. JFS\u2019s board of directors (BOD) is responsible for the strategic \ndirection, policy setting, and supervision of the company\u2019s performance, as well as ensuring its \ncompliance with laws and regulations. It is composed of professional members and leaders from \nthe banking, finance, and business segments as well as from microfinance investment funds and \nsocial investors. Of the 16 members, five are independent directors, eight are investor directors, \nand the remaining three are executive directors. The BOD is chaired by JFS\u2019s promoter, Ramesh \nRamanathan, a former banker (Citibank), and supported by a system of appointed committees \n(asset-liability  committee,  audit,  risk  and  credit,  borrowing,  nomination  and  remuneration, \ncorporate social responsibility).  \n \n12.  Management. JFS\u2019s 10-member executive management team is responsible for the day-\nto-day management of the company, as well as overseeing the transition of the NBFC MFI into \nan  SFB.  Business  lines\u2014Retail  Financial  Services  and  Enterprise  Financial  Services\u2014are \nheaded by former corporate credit bankers with over 20 years of experience. \n \nRisk  management.  JFS  is governed by  a  BOD-approved  risk management  policy  that \n13. \noversees  all  aspects  of  risk  including  credit,  operational,  market,  liquidity,  interest  rate,  and \ncompliance risks. The BOD Risk Management Committee is updated quarterly on company risks \nby  the  chief  risk  officer,  who  manages  the  day-to-day  functioning  of  the  Risk  Management \nDepartment.  JFS  has  developed  an  integrated  risk  management  approach,  with  well-defined \ncontrol systems in place. The first level of controls is built through the operations processes, with \na focus on business tracking to ensure quality assurance and successful collection. Monitoring\u2014\nthrough  credit  risk  management,  operations  and  compliance  risk  management,  and  fraud  risk \nmanagement\u2014is  the  second  level  of  controls.  Loan  processing  and  approval  processes  are \ncentralized at central processing centers, with a maker\u2013checker concept at every stage. Internal \naudit  is  viewed  as  the  third  level  of  control,  with  independent  quarterly  audits  of  the  branches \nundertaken on five major parameters: client acquisition, disbursements, recovery, systems and \nprocesses, and cash management. JFS\u2019s risk management framework is supported by a digitized, \ndata-driven performance management system based on the  balanced scorecard methodology, \nwhich covers both entity performance management and individual performance management.17  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n13. \nJFS in one or both of the following modalities described in Table 2: \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Modalities \n\nADB\u2019s debt financing up to $150 million (in Indian rupee equivalent) will be provided to \n\nStructure Options \n\nOn or Offshore \n\nNonconvertible Debentures \n (3\u20135 years) \n\nOnshore domestic debenture\u2014senior \nunsecured, settled in Indian rupees \n\nBilateral Loan  \n(3\u20135 years) \nOnshore senior unsecured loan\u2014settled \nin Indian rupees \n\n Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \n14. \n\nNonconvertible debentures,18 a bilateral loan, or a combination of these two modalities will \n\n                                                \n17 The balanced scorecard is a strategic planning and management system developed at Harvard Business School that \nis used extensively in business and industry, government, and nonprofit organizations worldwide to align business \nactivities to the vision and strategy of the organization, improve internal and external communications, and monitor \norganization performance against strategic goals. \n\n18 Nonconvertible debentures are unsecured bonds that cannot be converted to company equity or stock. \n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nbe considered, depending on market conditions and client needs. ADB\u2019s financing will be senior \nunsecured, with recourse on the JFS balance sheet. ADB is also providing technical assistance \nunder the regional Technical Assistance for Business Development and Implementation Support \nfor Nonsovereign Operations project in an amount of up to $250,000 to support the development \nof sanitation loan prototypes, a crucial need in India. 19,20 \n \nB. \n \nUse of proceeds. JFS will use the proceeds of the ADB funding to finance microfinance \n15. \nloans,  predominately  loans to women customers  under the  JLG model, as well  as other  small \nloans to individuals and micro and small enterprises. In addition, up to 5% of the ADB facility will \nbe dedicated to loans for building and improving sanitation facilities throughout India. Some 50% \nof the funding will target less developed states, as classified in the Raghuram Rajan Panel Report, \n2013.21   \n \n16.  Monitoring  and reporting.  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector Operations  Department  will  carry  out \nproject monitoring. JFS will provide ADB with financial reports at predetermined regular intervals \nand  as  requested.  These  will  include  (i)  unaudited  financial  statements  on  a  quarterly  basis, \n(ii) audited  financial  statements  on  an  annual  basis,  (iii)  compliance  certificates  for  financial \ncovenants on a quarterly basis, (iv) reporting on the microfinance and sanitation loan portfolios \non a semiannual basis, and (v) annual reporting on selected development indicators agreed by \nADB and the borrower. \n \n17. \nEvaluation. Monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB regularly and at \nleast  annually.  The  first  report  will  be  submitted  no  later  than  12  months  after  the  first \ndisbursement. \n \nC. \n \n18. \nSupporting  access  to  finance  and  financial  sector  development.  The  proposed \ntransaction seeks to support JFS\u2019s growth as it transitions into a pan-India (urban and rural) SFB \nand looks to diversify its liabilities while it builds its deposit franchise. As wholesale bank funding \nwill no longer be available to JFS as an SFB, ADB support will provide stable, longer-term funding \nas JFS transitions. In addition, ADB\u2019s funding will underpin JFS\u2019s mandate to provide a complete \nrange of products and services to address the financial needs of the underserved, which are not \nbeing  met  by  mainstream  financial  institutions,  and  thereby  complement  the  government\u2019s \nobjective to increase financial inclusion.  \n \n19. \nSupporting  development  of  the  sanitation  sector.  The  proposed  transaction,  in \ncombination  with  the  technical  assistance,  will  help  to  develop  and  deploy  sanitation  loan \nprototypes  that  can  be  used  by  financial  institutions  throughout  India  as  a  complement  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s sanitation initiatives.  \n \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\n \n                                                \n19 http://www.adb.org/projects/50036-001/main#project-overview. \n20  ADB.  2016.

The expected outputs from the transaction will be (i) increased JFS capacity for \nmicrofinance lending as evidenced by (a) active microfinance loan accounts increasing to 24.6 \nmillion by FY2024 (baseline 4.6 million, FY2016); (b) active microfinance loan accounts to women \nincreasing to 24.6 million by FY2024 (baseline 4.6 million, FY2016); and (c) at least 50% of the \nloans  made  using  ADB  funding  be  directed  to  less  developed  states;  and  (ii)  increased  JFS \noperations in sanitation as evidenced by (a) active sanitation loans reaching 206,000 by FY2024 \n(baseline:  not  applicable);  and  (b)  share  of  sanitation  loans  as  a  percentage  of  the  total  loan \nportfolio increasing to 1% by FY2024 (FY2016 baseline: not applicable). \n \nB. \n \nThe Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 emphasizes ADB\u2019s support to the financial sector \n23. \nby  helping  to  develop  financial  infrastructure,  institutions,  and  products  and  services.  The \nproposed transaction contributes to financial sector development by supporting the growth of an \nSFB, an important component of the financial sector in India. 23 The Midterm Review of Strategy \n2020 also seeks to promote inclusive growth. Without access to formal financial services, lower \nincome  people  or  underserved  segments  will  be  excluded  from  the  growth  process  and  its \nbenefits.  According to the India  country  partnership strategy,  2013\u20132017,  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign \noperations will continue to support the infrastructure and financial sectors by undertaking selective \nprojects  for  physical  and  social  infrastructure  and  financial  infrastructure. 24  The  proposed \ntransaction  will  support  the  development  of  microfinance  in  India,  one  of  the  financial \ninfrastructures identified and a high priority for the government. \n \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  investments  are  classified  as  category  FI  for  impacts  on  the  environment  and \n24. \ninvoluntary resettlement, and as category FI (treated as C) for indigenous peoples.
