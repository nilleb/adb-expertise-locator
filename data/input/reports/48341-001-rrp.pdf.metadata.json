The  urban  shortage  was  about  18.8  million \ndwelling units at the end of 2012.2 Due to the lack of housing in urban areas, many people live \nin  inadequate  conditions  and  slums  have  proliferated  across  the  country.  In  Mumbai,  for \ninstance, about 53% of the population lives in slums; however, officially, only 15% are identified \nas  the  real  poor.  This  led  industry  experts  to  comment  that  even  the  middle  class  is  having \ndifficulty finding housing that is not in slums or substandard conditions.3 Increasing urbanization \nfrom 28% in 2001 to 40% by 2030,4 nuclearization of families, positive demographics (more than \n50%  of the  population  is  under  25  years  of  age),  and  rising  incomes  will  increase  demand for \nurban  housing.  Increased  infrastructure  development  is  improving  connectivity  within  cities, \nallowing  workers  to  live  further  away  from  their  jobs  at  more  suburban  locations.  The \ncombination  of  high  demand  and  relatively  low  organized  supply,  as  well  as  new  policy \ninitiatives  allowing  foreign  direct  investment  in  real  estate  are  contributing  to  the  interest  of \nreputed developers to enter the lower price segment. \n \n3. \nShapoorji Pallonji and Company Private Limited (SPCPL or the sponsor) approached the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  invest  in  a  housing  platform  to  develop  a  portfolio  of \naffordable  housing  projects.  The  project  is  considered  to  be  one  of  the  best  opportunities  for \nADB  to  support  affordable  housing  in  India  because  of  its  high  development  impact  and  its \nstrong  and  experienced  sponsor.  SPCPL  is  one  of  the  first  large,  well-reputed  developers  to \nmove into the affordable housing market with a structured approach.  \n  \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n \nThe  sponsor,  SPCPL,  has  incorporated  DDPL  as  the  entity  under  which  all  future \n4. \naffordable  housing  projects  under  the  Shapoorji  brand  will  be  developed.  The  proposed \ntransaction  will  make  an  equity  investment  in  DDPL,  which  is  expected  to  construct \napproximately  20,000  affordable  housing  units.  The  project  will  provide  affordable  housing  for \nfamilies  in  the  upper  part  of  the  lower  income  group  and  the  middle-income  group  segment\u2014\ntargeting working class, salaried, service sector households. These households are expected to \nbe able to obtain a long-term mortgage from commercial banks and housing finance institutions \nthat will partner with SPCPL ahead of project launch.  \n\n                                                \n1   Credit Rating Information Services of India Limited Research. 2009.

Mumbai. \n\nMumbai.  \n\n\f2 \n \n\nThe  definition  of  affordable  housing  differs  around  the  world,  although  a  commonly \n5. \naccepted  guideline  is  that  cost  of  housing  should  not  exceed  40%  of  a  household\u2019s  gross \nincome.  Income,  size  of  dwelling,  and  affordability  are  three  key  parameters  used  to  define \naffordable housing. KPMG and Knight Frank, an international property consultant, have outlined \na useful affordable housing definition in India (Table 1).5 Affordable housing is distinct from the \nIndian high-end real estate market, which recently experienced a boom. Affordable housing is a \nlow-margin  (but  stable),  mass-market  business  with  an  estimated  market  size  of  Rs3  trillion  \n($50  billion)  in  India\u2019s  seven  largest  cities  alone  (footnote  5).  A  key  factor  that  determines \nfinancial  success  of  the  affordable  housing  segment  is  low  overall  cost,  which  includes  (i)  low \ncost of land, (ii) low construction cost, (iii) efficient implementation of construction, (iv) access to \nlow-cost  capital,  (v)  innovative  marketing  skills,  (vi)  dedicated  organizational  focus,  and  \n(vii) good government relations to obtain all required licenses in a timely manner. \n \n\nTable 1: Defining Affordable Housing \n\nSize of Dwelling Unit  Affordability \n\n \n\nEWS \n\nLIG \n\nMIG \n\nIncome Level \n<INR 150,000 per annum \n(< $ 2,444 per annum) \nINR  150,000  to  300,000  per \nannum \n($2,444 - $4,889 per annum) \nINR 300,000 to 1,000,000 per \nannum \n($4,889 -$16,287 per annum) \n\nUp to 300 ft2  \n\n300 to 600 ft2  \n\n600 to 1200 ft2  \n\nMonthly Installment to Monthly Income \n\u2022 30 to 40 percent \nHouse Price to Annual Income Ratio \n\u2022 Less than 5.1  \n\n  EWS = economically weaker section, LIG = low income group, MIG = middle income group \n  Source: KPMG advisory 2010. \n\n \n6. \nThe  project  will  draw  on  the  extensive  construction  experience  of  SPCPL  and  other \nShapoorji  Pallonji  Group  (SPG)  companies,  which  have  a  presence  across  the  construction \nvalue chain.. The projects will be located in suburban locations of preselected cities, have clear \ngrowth  potential,  and  are  carefully  selected  based  on  a  well-defined  geographic  strategy. \nAmenities  will  include  standard sanitation,  adequate  water  and  power  supply,  and  provision of \ncommunity  spaces.  They  could  include  amenities  such  as  parks,  schools,  and  health-care \nfacilities, where applicable.  \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Sponsor \n\n \n7. \nEstablished in 1865, SPG is one of the oldest and most reputable conglomerates in India \nwith  presence  across  construction,  real  estate,  infrastructure,  and  water,  with  a  total  annual \nturnover of $2.5 billion. As part of SPG, SPCPL is one of the leading real estate companies in \nIndia with a pan-India portfolio of residential and commercial developments, and experience in \naffordable  housing.  SPCPL  has  constructed  landmark  buildings,  such  as the  Reserve  Bank of \nIndia  (1952),  the  Taj  Mahal  Palace  Hotel  (1903),  and  the  Imperial  Towers  in  Mumbai  (2010), \nwhich  are  the  tallest  buildings  in  India  to  date.  SPCPL  has  also  constructed  international \nlandmark buildings in the Middle East and Africa, such as the Palace of the Sultan in Oman and \nthe Seat of Government in Ghana. SPCPL is the developer and contractor of the Shukhobrishti \nproject in Kolkata, which is one of the largest mass, affordable housing projects in India to date \nand  is  being  developed  for  the  government  of  West  Bengal  based  on  a  Public  Private \nPartnership.  Spread  over  61  hectares,  about  20,000  units  are  being  constructed  in  one  single \nlocation for lower, middle, and upper-middle-income households.  \n\n                                                \n5  KPMG. 2010.

Mumbai. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nB. \n \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n \nThe  direct  impact  of  the  project  is  to  increase  private  sector  investment  in  affordable \n8. \nhousing.  It  supports  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive  growth  by  generating  employment  and \nimproves  housing  availability  and  quality.  Access  to  adequate  housing  improves  health \nconditions, but also reduces stress and improves security, especially for children and women. At \nthe  same  time,  housing  provides  a  place  of  employment  for  micro  and  small  businesses  and \ncan be used as collateral to secure a loan.6 \n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n \n9. \nThe  outcome  of  the  project  is  improved  access  to  affordable,  available  and  quality \nhousing for target households in urban India. The shortage of housing in urban centers will be \npartially  addressed  by  the  construction  of  additional  units.  This  will  be  measured  through  the \nnumber of units sold to end consumers and ownership deeds transferred.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n \nThe  project\u2019s  outputs  will  be  the  construction  of  approximately  20,000  affordable \n10.  \nresidential  housing  units,  to  be  built  to  the  extent  possible  according  to  green  building \nprinciples. 7 The  project  is  expected  to  create  approximately  9,000  temporary  unskilled  and \nsemiskilled  direct  jobs  during  project  construction.  Locally  purchased  goods  and  services  are \nexpected to contribute approximately $640 million to the local economy. Construction is a large \ncontributor  to  employment,  particularly  in  the  form  of  semiskilled  and  unskilled  jobs  for  lower \nincome groups. According to an ADB study, Rs1 million invested in construction creates (direct \nand  indirectly)  22,000  unskilled,  23,000  skilled  and  semiskilled,  and  9,000  managerial  and \ntechnical person-days of employment in India (footnote 6). Environmental and social standards \nof the developer will be implemented at each subproject.  \n \nC. \n \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n \n11. \nThe project will promote private sector development, one of the pillars of Strategy 2020 \nand  its  midterm  review,  in  the  affordable  housing  segment.8 The  government  has  traditionally \nsupported this part of the real estate sector, which has historically not seen much interest from \nthe private sector. The Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 also calls for sharpening the focus of \nADB operations on inclusive economic growth, which is addressed through the spin-off effects \nof  construction.9 ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  India,  2013\u20132017  notes  that  housing \nfinance,  and  physical  and  social  infrastructure  development  will  be  supported.10 The  project \n\n                                                \n6  ADB.  2013.

The \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nB. \n \n15. \nLong-term  funding  for  the  real  estate  sector,  particularly  for  the  affordable  housing \nsegment, is not readily available in the Indian market due to limited risk appetite and commercial \nbank\u2019s  limits  to  the  sector  which  have  been  largely  used  for  the  high-end  real  estate  market. \nADB\u2019s  investment  will  be  catalytic  as  it  allows  SPCPL  to  launch  a  sizeable  and  sustainable \nhousing platform for affordable housing, an area that needs quality sponsors to build low-cost, \ngood quality housing stock. To date this segment is largely characterized by small unorganized \nparticipants  with  limited  capacity.  The  construction  of  housing  supply  affordable  to  the  middle \nclass will free up housing stock for people who currently live in substandard conditions but are \nunable to move out due to a lack of available options. The project will play a pioneering role in \ndemonstrating  the  commercial  viability  of  affordable  housing  projects  undertaken  without \ngovernment subsidies.  \n \nC. \n \nis  plagued  by  delays  and \n16. \nunderperformance due to the limited financial and operating capacity of developers. SPCPL has \nample  experience  as  a  real  estate  developer  and  construction  contractor,  having  delivered \nmultiple  landmark  buildings.  SPCPL  is  the  developer  and  engineering,  procurement,  and \nconstruction contractor of the Shukhobrishti project in Kolkata, which is one of the largest mass \nhousing projects in India to date.  \n \n17. \nProject implementation risk. Real estate projects are prone to construction delays and \ncost  overruns.  Construction  of  the  subprojects  will  be  done  by  SPCPL,  one  of  India\u2019s  most \nreputable and leading construction companies. Projects will be undertaken in a phased manner \nand  are  scalable,  as  the  project  will  comprise  multiple  independent  towers.  If  market  demand \ndictates  a  smaller  development,  fewer  towers  can  be  constructed,  reducing  the  capital  outlay \nand  the  risk  of  cost  overruns.  Increased  construction  costs  are  generally  absorbed  by  sales \nprice escalations for units sold in later stages of the development. \n  \n18.  Market risk. The transaction is exposed to underlying real estate risk of the projects (in \nterms  of  cost,  schedule,  unit  sales,  and  financing)  which,  if  materialized  would  result  in  lower \nsales proceeds than planned. By providing financing at a corporate level, ADB is able to invest \nin  affordable  housing  on  a  portfolio  basis,  mitigating  the  geographic  real  estate  concentration \nrisk of a single project location.  \n \n19. \nGovernment support. Reliance on government for provision of basic infrastructure and \npublic  transport  creates  a  risk  that  project  sites  might  not  be  sufficiently  connected  or  will \nencounter  connection  delays.  Sites  will  be  carefully  selected  on  the  (near)  availability  of  such \ntrunk infrastructure and connectivity services in order to mitigate against connection delays.  \n \n20. \nPermitting  risk.  The  real  estate  sector  has  seen  significant  delays  over  the  past  few \nyears  due  to  the  increased  number  of  permits  required  and  the  lengthy  processes  involved, \nwhich can contribute to high cost overruns. Several Indian cities have started implementing an \nautomated system for approving building plans. SPCPL\u2019s proven track record, good reputation, \nand ongoing relationship with authorities should mitigate permitting delays.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions  \n\n \nA. \n \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \n21. \ncategory B for environment and category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples \nimpacts. The potential environmental and social impacts were identified and effective measures \nto  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  are  incorporated  in  the \nsafeguard  reports  and  plans.  To  assess  compliance  with  the  safeguard  requirements  for \nindividual projects, DDPL will establish and maintain an environmental and social management \nsystem  (ESMS),  to  screen,  assess,  and  address  environmental  and  social  impacts  and  risks. \nThe  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  DDPL  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate.  \n \n22.   Sites  within  the  municipal  boundaries  of  the  metropolitan  areas,  subject  to  a \ndevelopment  control  plan  and  zoned  for  residential  development,  will  be  considered  for \ndevelopment  of  housing  projects  by  DDPL.  No  significant  environmental  disturbances  are \nanticipated  as  the  screening  criteria  for  site  selection  will  avoid  areas  in  the  vicinity  of \nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas.  Typical  construction  impacts  such  as  vegetation  clearance, \nstorm-water  management,  dust,  noise,  and  solid  and  liquid  waste  generation  will  occur  apart \nfrom an increase in local traffic due to operation of construction vehicles and equipment on site. \nNo  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  are  expected  as  DDPL  will  acquire  already  aggregated \nlands,  free  of  land  disputes  or  encumbrances,  from  (i)  lands  already  owned  by  SPG  in  the \nmetropolitan  cities,  (ii)  a  network  of  reputed  land  aggregators  and  realtors  with  access  to \nsuitable  lands,  and  (iii)  international  property  consultants  and  reputed  brokers.  DDPL  will \nperform due diligence of the process for all land procurement, and address any residual impacts \non  affected  persons  in  line  with  ADB  safeguard  requirements.  Impacts  on  indigenous  peoples \nare  not  expected  as  there  is  no  likelihood  of  concentrations  of  scheduled  tribes  occupying  or \nutilizing the sites within the metropolitan cities. Each project will undergo an initial environmental \nexamination and a social safeguards compliance due diligence as per the DDPL ESMS. \n \n23. \nA corporate audit was conducted on SPCPL\u2019s existing environment and social policy and \nprocedures.  The  audit  identified  corrective  actions  required  to  ensure  compliance  of  the \nprocedures  with  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements.  The  corrective  actions  were \ndiscussed  and  agreed  upon  with  SPCPL.  DDPL  commits  to  implement  the  corrective  actions \nproposed  and  to  have  in  place  a  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  compliant  ESMS,  which  is \nsatisfactory to ADB, prior to first disbursement.
