In line with  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132015 for \nViet Nam, the FSDP aims to strengthen the legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks and \nmarket infrastructure to sustain the financing of productive investment.1 The FSDP is included in \nthe country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014 for Viet Nam and will support the government \nin  transitioning  the  country  into  a  modern,  productive,  and  equitable  market-based  economy.2 \nThe  FSDP  and  its  supporting  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the \ndevelopment of a well-functioning money market and a deeper and more liquid capital market, \nand it will improve the capacity of public and private institutions in the nonbank financial sector.3 \nThese  focus  areas  have  been  discussed  with  all  relevant  government  agencies,  market  and \nindustry associations, and development partners. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe government\u2019s reform programs have helped the country reach lower middle-income \nstatus.4  However,  Viet  Nam  is  now  at  a critical  juncture  and needs to  sustain  its  development \nprogress.  The  government  aspires  to  achieve  a  higher  middle-income  status,  with  per  capita \nincome  of  at  least  $3,000,  along  with  significant  improvements  in  human  development  and \npoverty  reduction  by  2020.  To  meet  these  goals,  the  SEDS  focuses  on  structural  reforms, \nenvironmental  sustainability,  social  equity,  and  macroeconomic  stability.  The  government  has \nidentified financial sector development as a key aspect of the reform agenda, which underlies all \nof  these  focus  areas.  Recognizing  this,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  adopted  a \n\u201cwhole-of-sector\u201d  approach  to  support  financial  sector  development  in  Viet  Nam  based  on \nongoing policy dialogue  and regular financial sector assessments. The FSDP  will complement \nand  support  interrelated  and  reinforcing  effects  to  provide  greater  macroeconomic  stability, \nincrease  the  availability  of  credit  to  the  corporate  sector  and  small  businesses,  and  facilitate \nstructural  reforms.  The  recent  Financial  Sector  Assessment  Program  (FSAP)  reconfirmed  the \nneed to prioritize the development of Viet Nam\u2019s financial sector to support bank recapitalization \nand to facilitate the restructuring of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).5  \n \n4. \nADB\u2019s  comprehensive  financial  sector  engagement.  ADB  has  supported  financial \nsector development in Viet Nam with three successive clusters of financial sector program loans \n(FSPLs).  FSPL1  supported  the  introduction  of  basic  concepts  and  systems  that  represent  the \nprerequisites to developing a market-based financial system and economy.6 FSPL2 marked the \n\n                                                \n1    ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nbeginning of ADB\u2019s emphasis on development of the nonbank financial sector. Building on the \nwork  started  under  FSPL1,  the  program  strengthened  capital  markets,  institutional  investors, \nand  nonbank  financial  intermediaries.7  FSPL3  sought  to  increase  alternative  channels  for \nmarket-based financial intermediation.8 The program enhanced the securities issuance process, \nincreased  the  supply  and  quality  of  assets  available  to  investors,  and  supported  the \nestablishment of a Public Debt Management Office. These programs have been buttressed by a \nbroader  range  of  initiatives  benefiting  from  ADB  support,  such  as  the  Asian  Bond  Market \nDevelopment  Initiative. A  wide  range of  bilateral  and multilateral  donors  are  also  active in this \nsector,  including  the World  Bank  and  the  Canadian  International  Development  Agency,  which \nprovide substantial levels of assistance to the banking sector.9 \n \n5. \nADB is providing parallel targeted assistance to support and increase access to finance. \nThe  Second  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprise  (SME)  Development  Program  provides \nmeasures to promote SME development, strengthen the framework for competition policy, and \nenhance  SME  access  to  finance.10  At  the  same  time,  ADB  is  supporting  the  government\u2019s \nefforts  to  restructure  SOEs.  This  program,  which  depends  in  large  part  on  financial  sector \nreform,  aims  to  reduce  the  dominance  of  inefficient  state  production,  promote  private  sector \ndevelopment,  and  enhance  economic  growth  by  freeing  up  financial  resources  to  more \nproductive  uses.  Under  the  SOE  Reform  and  Corporate  Governance  Facilitation  Program, \nparticipating  SOEs  will  be  restructured  under  a  comprehensive  package  of  corporate  and \nfinancial  reforms.11  This  initiative  builds  on  an  earlier  ADB  engagement  that  developed  an \nenabling environment, including the creation of a centralized government institution to formulate, \ncoordinate, and lead the implementation of SOE reform.  \n \nPositive but measured results. ADB financial sector programs have contributed to the \n6. \nemergence of a nascent yet fast-growing financial sector. Viet Nam\u2019s total local currency bonds \noutstanding grew 26.8% year-on-year to reach D578 trillion as of end-June 2013, similar to the \n28.5%  year-on-year  increase  recorded  in  June  2012.  In  fact,  year-on-year  Viet  Nam  was  the \nfastest  growing  local  currency  bond  market  in  emerging  East  Asia  in  the  second  quarter  of \n2013.12  While  private  sector  issuance  has  recently  slowed,  local  currency  corporate  bonds \nincreased to 0.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in June 2013 from zero in June 2007. \n \nThe growth of the stock exchanges has far exceeded the government's initial target for a \n7. \ncombined market capitalization of 10% of GDP by 2010. Combined stock market capitalization \nhas increased to 23% of GDP as of the end of 2012, from zero in 2002. The Ho Chi Minh City \nStock Exchange began operations in 2000 with just two listed companies. By 2012 it had grown \nto  308  listed  stocks  and  a  total  market  capitalization  of  D678  trillion.  The  Ha  Noi  Stock \nExchange  (HNX)  opened  in  July  2005  with  six  listed  companies.  At  year-end  2012,  HNX \nreported  396  listed  stocks,  448  listed  government  bonds,  18  listed  treasury  bills,  and  132 \n\n                                                \n7    ADB. 2002.

Report and Recommendations of the President to the Board of Directors: Multitranche Financing \n\nFacility for the SOE Reform and Corporate Governance Facilitation Program. Manila. \n\n12   Emerging  East  Asia  includes  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China;  Hong  Kong,  China;  Indonesia;  the  Republic  of \n\nKorea; Malaysia; the Philippines; Singapore; Thailand; and Viet Nam. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nregistered  over-the-counter  stocks  (Unlisted  Public  Company  Market).  A  contractual  savings \nindustry  has  also  begun  to  emerge  as  a  precursor  for  an  enlarged  investor  base.  While  the \ncommercial insurance market in Viet Nam only began in 1993, the market has grown rapidly in \nterms  of  premiums,  products  on  offer,  and  diversity.  Penetration  rates  at  1.4%  of  GDP  are \ncomparable to those of Indonesia and the Philippines.  \n \nAccordingly, the country assistance program evaluation recorded a borderline successful \n8. \noverall finance sector assistance rating for Viet Nam over the period 1999\u20132008.13  In particular, \nthe  country  assistance  program  evaluation  described  ADB\u2019s  engagement  as  a  logical \nsequencing  of  reforms  beginning  with  the  basic  frameworks  and  then  expanding  to  more \ncomplex  reforms.  Likewise,  the  special  evaluation  study  on  ADB  Assistance  for  Domestic \nCapital Market Development rated ADB\u2019s capital markets assistance in Viet Nam successful.14 \nADB\u2019s  assistance was  regarded  as  highly  selective and well  sequenced,  while benefiting from \nsubstantial  aid  coordination.  However,  both  studies  recognized  that  the  establishment  of  a \nsound financial system and capital markets is a long-term process and that Viet Nam was likely \nto require more time and additional capacity development support to be able to move towards \nfull compliance with international standards.  \n \n9. \nThis  observation  was  further  validated  during  program  implementation.  Preliminary \nassessments indicate that as FSPL3 began calling for increasingly complex reforms, difficulties \nin  managing  the  required  coordination  between  government  agencies  produced  protracted \nimplementation  periods.  For  example,  the  government  is  only  now  beginning  to  address  the \nneed  to  recapitalize  the  banking  sector  and  restructure  SOEs,  both  of  which  are  needed  to \nprovide  incentives  for  capital  market  development.  In  addition,  the  scale  of  TA  provided  to \nsupport  early  programs  proved  insufficient.  These  issues  manifested  themselves  through  the \nemergence  of  compliance-based  program  implementation  in  which  policy  reforms  were \nimplemented and documented, and yet lacked effectiveness.  \n \nRemaining  challenges.  The  government  has  recognized  that  a  more  focused  and \n10. \nsustained effort is required to deepen Viet Nam\u2019s financial sector and to sustain the financing of \neconomic development. The money market remains small and extremely fragmented. Turnover \nis low and tenors are very short. Activity has been constrained by restrictive regulations, a lack \nof  an  enabling  infrastructure,  and  the  inability  of  participants  to  obtain  qualitative  and  reliable \ncredit  assessments.  Standardized  agreements  have  not  been  adopted  by  the  private  sector, \nsuch  as  in  the  case  of  repos,  and  transparency  is  poor.  Until  these  issues  are  addressed, \nmacroeconomic  stability  will  remain  elusive  as  authorities  are  forced  to  rely  on  less  efficient \npolicy tools such as control of the monetary base.  \n \n11. \nViet  Nam  remains  one of the  smallest  debt  markets  of  emerging  East  Asia  in terms  of \nGDP  and  size.  During  2009,  the  local  currency  bond  market  stagnated  due  to  the  global \nfinancial  crisis.  When  combined  with  the  overlay  of  other  structural  impediments,  such  as \ninterest rate caps, issuance became problematic for all but the shortest maturities. At the end of \nthe  second  quarter  of  2013,  the  total  local  currency  bond  market  represented  only  14.8%  of \nGDP,  well  below  the  overall  average  of  54.3%  for  emerging  East  Asia.  Bond  market \ndevelopment will be constrained in the absence of proper hedging mechanisms and instruments \nas  these  key  risk  management  tools  are  necessary  to  support  the  development  of  market \nmakers. Moreover, the contractual savings industry has not been supported with a development \n\n                                                \n13   ADB.  2009.

Over the short term (2010\u20132013), the government \nintroduced a number of initiatives aimed at strengthening the legal framework and providing an \nenabling environment to support the development of a short-term money market. As part of this \neffort, the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) will coordinate with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and \nother stakeholders to introduce standardized repurchase agreements and to study the feasibility \nof launching alternative money market instruments. The SBV will increase the transparency of \ncentral  bank  operations  within  the  money  market.  Over  the  longer  term,  the  government  will \nattempt  to  solve  some  of  the  more  challenging  issues,  such  as  the  SBV\u2019s  independence  and \nlegal mandate. \n \n13. \nThe  MOF  and  State  Securities  Commission  (SSC)  have  completed  the  Sector  Road \nMap  for the  Strategic  Development  of the  Vietnamese Capital  Market, which covers  the  years \n2011\u20132020. This document serves as a master plan for long-term capital market development \nand addresses bottlenecks that impede its growth. A bond market development road map has \nbeen  approved  and  adopted  that  includes  both  quantitative  and  qualitative  targets.  The \ngovernment  plans  to increase  outstanding  local  currency  bonds  to 38%  of  GDP  by  2020  from \n18%  of  GDP  in  2011.  A  mechanism  will  be  created  to  link  treasury  and  debt  management  to \nensure  predictable,  pre-announced  debt  auctions.  The  government  also  plans  to  develop  a \nprimary dealer system and to lay the foundations for market makers in both the primary market \nand  secondary  market.  By  identifying  benchmark  issues  and  lengthening  maturities,  the \ngovernment will begin building a risk-free yield curve to establish reference rates. An enabling \nenvironment will be provided to develop the corporate bond market as well as the establishment \nof a domestic credit rating agency. These efforts will be backstopped by a road map to develop \nthe insurance industry as a source of demand for capital market products. \n \n14. \nTo  complement  its  overarching  objectives,  the  SEDS  provides  for  comprehensive \ncapacity  development  throughout  the  financial  sector,  including  for  the  SBV  and  MOF.16  The \nstrategy  initially  focuses  on  preparing  the  necessary  conditions  to  implement  comprehensive \nhuman  resources  development  and  training  activities,  which  are  necessary  to  support  more \ncomplex  policy  reforms.  From  2015  to  2020,  the  government  will  restructure  training  activities \nfor  the  whole  financial  sector,  including  university  education.  To  strengthen  the  underlying \ninfrastructure  of  the  financial  sector,  the  government  will  establish  an  accounting  and  audit \nsystem  that  is  compatible  with  Viet  Nam\u2019s  circumstances  as  well  as  regional  and  global \nstandards,  including  the  adoption  of  market  or  fair  value.  Mark-to-market  is  instrumental  in \nproviding incentives to encourage discipline through risk management and the development of \nkey technical skills. Efforts will also be made to upgrade the clearing and settlement system and \nto establish a central clearing counterparty. \n \n15. \nThe proposed program. The design of the FSDP has incorporated the lessons learned. \nFinancial sector development is recognized as hierarchical and requires careful sequencing to \nsafeguard monetary and financial stability.17 Further, prior ADB programs indicate that program \neffectiveness is enhanced when reforms begin with the basic building blocks and are backed by \ncomprehensive  TA.  ADB\u2019s  experience  also  indicates  that  the  effectiveness  of  the  reforms \n\n                                                \n15   Summary Sector Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n16   Decision  219/QD-NHNN  of  9  February  2012;  the  Human  Resource  Development  Master  Plan  for  the  banking \n\nsector over 2011\u20132020. \n\n17   International  Monetary  Fund.  2003.

Therefore,  the  FSDP \nwill  utilize  a  programmatic  approach,  with  2  subprograms  to  narrow  and  refocus  a  sustained \neffort  to  develop  a  money  market  and  a  capital  market,  emphasizing  government  debt  as  the \nbasic  building  blocks  of  effective  macroeconomic  management  and \nfinancial  sector \ndevelopment.  The  FSDP  will  also  support  capacity  development  in  recognition  of  the  key  role \ntechnical  and  management  skills  play  in  implementing  reforms,  maintaining  stability,  and \nfostering investor confidence.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n16. \nThe impact of the FSDP  will be an expanded  level of nonbank financing, which  will be \nreflected, in part, through growth of local currency debt markets relative to GDP. The outcome \nwill be strengthened investor confidence.   \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nTo  achieve  the  envisioned  impact  and  outcome,  the  proposed  program  is  designed  to \n17. \nsupport  the  government  in  bringing  about  the  following  outputs:  (i)  a  well-functioning  money \nmarket, (ii) a deeper and more liquid capital market, and (iii) strengthened capacity of public and \nprivate institutions in the nonbank financial sector. Subprogram 1 contains 32 policy actions, all \nof which have been completed. The design and monitoring framework is provided in Appendix 1 \nand the policy matrix in Appendix 4.18 \n \n18. \nOutput 1: A well-functioning money market. To increase liquidity and accelerate the \ndevelopment  of  the  interbank  market,  the  SBV  and  MOF  have  significantly  enhanced \ncoordination and information exchange through the adoption of a comprehensive memorandum \nof  understanding  that  covers,  among  other  areas,  the  development  and  supervision  of  the \nmoney market. Within this framework, the SBV has established a Money Market Working Group \n(MMWG) to implement a Money Market Development Master Plan. The MMWG is headed by a \ndeputy  governor  and  is  supported  by  a  comprehensive  terms  of  reference  that  governs  the \nparticipation of a broad group of stakeholders.19 Under this cooperative framework, the SBV and \nMOF  have  agreed  to  coordinate  the  issuance  of  short-term  debt  to  eliminate  overlapping \nmaturities.  The  MMWG,  through  the  SBV,  has  issued  regulations governing  loans  secured  by \nthe  mortgage  of  valuable  papers  and  the  discount  and  rediscount  of  valuable  papers  by  the \nSBV.  The  MMWG  has  strengthened  the  code  of  conduct  for  the  foreign  exchange  interbank \nmarket.  Regulations  covering  brokerage  activities  have  been  improved.  Preparations  to \nintroduce a formal repo market have begun, which will include initiatives to introduce netting to \nreduce systemic credit risk.  \n \n19. \nTo  increase  transparency  and  price  discovery,  short-term  government  debt  with  a \nmaturity  of  1  year  or  less  is  now  traded  on  HNX.  The  SBV  is  collating  information  on  local \ncurrency interbank transactions and publishing basic transactional data on its external website. \nThe SBV has further improved transparency by publishing basic data on monetary and banking \noperations and has strengthened bank liquidity standards.  \n\n \n20. \nOutput  2:  A  deeper  and  more  liquid  capital  market.  To  further  develop  the \ngovernment debt market, thereby enhancing the private sector\u2019s access to nonbank finance, the \n\n                                                \n18   Contribution to the ADB Results Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n19   These stakeholders include the Monetary Policy Department, Credit Department, FX Department, Central Banking \n\nDepartment, Legal Department, and the Ministry of Finance. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nMOF strengthened the legal framework governing the issuance and management of public debt. \nThese guidelines  contain  measures to control  and  cap the  level  of  sovereign guarantees. The \nMOF  also  provided  an  enhanced  mechanism  to  issue  government  bonds,  including  auction \ntiming  and  announcements.  The  MOF  has  continued  its  program  of  large-lot  issuance  to \nfacilitate  liquidity  in  the  government  bond  market  and  has  used  switch  auctions  to  reduce  the \nnumber of outstanding issues from 185 in 2010 to 102 at the end of the first quarter of 2013. In \naddition,  the  MOF  has  taken  measures  to  (i)  increase  liquidity  and  trading  volumes  in  the \nsecondary market; (ii) better protect investors by setting guidelines for trading accounts; and (iii) \nprescribing standards and prohibitions for margin, inter-day, and insider trading. \n \n21. \nTo  provide  comprehensive  direction  and  measurable  performance  targets,  the  MOF \nfinalized the bond market development road map. The MOF rationalized regulations governing \nthe issuance of corporate bonds, streamlined administrative procedures, and increased the level \nof  responsibility  among  potential  issuers.  In  tandem,  the  MOF  strengthened  governance  by \nissuing  enhanced  disclosure  standards  and  by  adopting  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations (ASEAN) corporate governance scorecard.20 \n \nTo  strengthen  the  underlying  financial  market  infrastructure,  the  MOF  through  the \n22. \nInsurance  Supervisory  Agency,  completed  a  self-assessment  of  compliance  with \nthe \nAssociation  of  Insurance  Supervisors  Core  Principles,  while  the  SSC  completed  a  self-\nassessment of the implementation of International Organization of Securities Commissions Core \nPrinciples.  These  self-assessments  provided  direct  support  to  the  recently  completed  FSAP. \nBoth  agencies  developed  action  plans  to  improve  compliance.  MOF  implemented  the  Law  on \nIndependent  Audit  by  issuing  decrees  to  strengthen  the  creation  and  organization  of  auditing \nenterprises. The decrees further established the necessity of audits and prescribed the content \nof  audit  reports  and  files.  The  SSC  and  Viet  Nam  Securities  Depository  improved  customer \nservice and reduced operational risk in the securities settlement process. These initiatives serve \nas  a  precursor  to  the  eventual  transfer  of  the  cash  settlement  leg  of  government  securities \ntransactions to the SBV. \n \n23. \nOutput 3: Strengthened capacity of public and private institutions in the nonbank \nfinancial  sector.  To  address  the  sector-wide  capacity  deficit,  the  SBV  completed  a  human \nresources development plan covering the period 2011\u20132020. This plan recognizes the need to \nimprove  investor  confidence  through  more  effective  supervision  and  regulation.  It  ensures  the \ndevelopment  of  capacity  not  just  within  the  SBV  but  also  throughout  the  banking  industry.  It \nidentified a wide range of necessary inputs covering academia to internal training programs. To \naddress  the  sector\u2019s  most  pressing  needs,  the  SBV  is  focusing  initially  on  its  core  operations \nand identified several groups of 40\u201360 staff members for intensive training. A similar program is \nbeing  launched  for  the  banking  sector  which  focuses,  among  others,  on  bank  and  risk \nmanagement,  research  and  development,  information  technology,  credit  administration,  and \ninternal  audit  and  control.  Concurrently,  the  SSC  completed  a  plan  for  human  resources \ndevelopment covering the medium-term period of 2011 to 2020. From 2011 to 2013, the SSC is \nfocusing on improving the quality of its professionals. From 2014 to 2015, it will strengthen the \nstructure, functions, duties, and powers of its organization. \n \n24. \nTo  strengthen  public  disclosure  in  line  with  international  practices,  and  to  strengthen \ninvestor  protections,  the  MOF  completed  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  gaps  between  Viet \nNam Accounting Standards (VAS) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). An \naccounting  and  auditing  strategy  and  road  map  has  been  adopted  to  strengthen  the  legal \n\n                                                \n20   ASEAN Corporate Governance Scorecard. \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nlocal  standards \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nframework, improve the quality of the local industry and self-regulatory organizations, and foster \ngreater  international  cooperation.  Within  the  accounting  and  auditing  strategy,  the  MOF  has \nbegun  strengthening  accounting  and  auditing  standards,  which  will  lead  to  the  eventual \nrecognition  of  market  or  fair  value  accounting.  Likewise,  the  MOF,  through  the  Insurance \nSupervisory  Agency,  has  reviewed  the  amended  Law  on  Insurance  Business  to  identify  gaps \nfrom international sound practice. This review is serving as a benchmark to begin the eventual \nimplementation of Solvency 1 for the insurance sector.21 \n \nSubprogram  2.  Recognizing  the  long-term  nature  of  financial  sector  development  and \n25. \nthe  unique  and  challenging  nature  of  the  Vietnamese  market,  subprogram  2  contains  45 \nindicative policy actions designed to build on the accomplishments of subprogram  1. The SBV \nand MOF will continue to coordinate to further deepen the short-term yield curve, and legislation \nwill be proposed to introduce interest rate derivatives. New money market instruments, including \nthe  possible  development  of  a  standardized  repurchase  agreement,  will  be  introduced.  The \nMOF  will  implement  the  bond  market  development  road  map  and  will  further  strengthen  the \nprimary  government \nto \nissuance  process.  The  government  will  align \ninternational standards by increasing compliance with the Association of Insurance Supervisors \nCore  Principles and the International  Organization of  Securities Commissions  Core  Principles. \nThe  government  will  take  steps  to  introduce  fair  value  accounting.  The  SSC  and  SBV  will \nimplement their human resources development plans.  \n \nD. \n \n26. \nIn  2013,  the  government  will  need  to  borrow  D162  trillion  to  cover  a  budget  deficit \ntargeted at 4.8% of GDP. In 2012, deficit financing was obtained from domestic sources (44%) \nand  external  sources  (56%),  of  which  some  84%  was  accounted  for  by  official  development \nassistance  (ODA).  Assuming  a  similar  distribution  for  2013,  the  government  will  borrow  an \nestimated  $3.7  billion  through  ODA  to  close  the  budget  gap.  The  size  of  the  loan  primarily \nreflects the government financing needs. Secondary considerations include the strength of the \nreform  program  and  the  costs  of  implementation.22  For  example,  the  government  will  absorb \nincreased  issuance  costs  with the  ongoing  extension  of government maximum  bond  tenors  to \n15  years  from  10  years.  In  addition,  the  transfer  of  the  cash  settlement  leg  of  securities \ntransactions  to  the  SBV  will  encompass  significant  capital  expenditures.  Under  the  FSDP, \ntraining budgets in both the MOF and SBV  will be increased significantly to provide for higher \nlevels of technical expertise and larger staff numbers. The SSC alone has projected an increase \nin  staff  count  to  1,000  by  2015  from  the  current  level  of  400.  A  recently  completed \ncomprehensive  skills  gap  assessment  indicates  the  SBV  will  require  $20  million  for  training \ncosts over the program period.23 \n \n27. \nto \nSDR29,238,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan \nwill have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be disbursed in accordance with the \nprovisions  of  ADB's  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for \nProgram  Loans.24  Subprogram  2,  with  an  indicative  amount  of  $70  million,  will  be  subject  to \n                                                \n21   Solvency 1 is the name given to changes to the EU's insurer solvency regime made in 2002.

Subprogram  2  will  be  submitted  for  Board  approval  upon \ncompletion of the indicative policy actions. The policy matrix given in Appendix 4 indicates the \nprogram framework, including the  32 policy actions completed prior to Board consideration for \nsubprogram 1, and those proposed for subprogram 2.  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe FSDP comprises two single-tranche subprograms. Subprogram 1 covers July 2010 \n28. \nto August 2013. Subprogram 2 covers September 2013 to June 2015. To reduce compliance-\nbased program implementation, emphasis will be placed on the achievement of tangible results. \nThe  executing  agency  for  the  FSDP  will  be  the  SBV;  the  implementing  agencies  will  be  the \nMOF,  SSC,  HNX,  and  SBV.  The  MMWG  acts  as  a  coordination  mechanism  for  the \nimplementation  of  the  Money  Market  Development  Master  Plan,  meeting  biannually  and \nproviding  a  ready  mechanism  through  which  the  government  can  bring  various  stakeholders \ntogether to implement reforms, which will become increasingly more challenging going forward.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n29. \nA  growing  body  of  empirical  research  produces  a  remarkably  consistent  narrative:  the \nservices  provided  by  the  financial  system  exert  a  first-order  impact  on  long-run  economic \ngrowth.  Building  on  work  by  Bagehot  (1873),  Schumpeter  (1912),  Gurley  and  Shaw  (1955), \nGoldsmith  (1969),  and  McKinnon  (1973),  recent  research  has  employed  different  econometric \nmethodologies  and  data  sets  in  producing  three  core  results.25  Levine  and  Zervos  have \nquantified  this  cost.26  Using  panel  data  from  47  countries  from  1976  through  1993,  they \ndemonstrated  that  stock  market  liquidity  and  banking  development  both  positively  predict \neconomic growth, and that both together, as opposed to separately, provided a larger boost to \nreal  GDP  per  capita.  Another  study  also  indicated  that  contractual  savings  (e.g.,  insurance, \nmutual  funds,  and  pensions)  play  a  significant  role  in  fostering  economic  development.27  This \nsame  research  indicates  that  the  boost  to  economic  growth  achieved  from  increasing  the \npenetration of life insurance is even more pronounced given higher levels of bank credit to GDP \nand stock market liquidity. In addition, a third study predicted that the positive impact of foreign \ndirect investment on economic growth in Viet Nam will be larger if more resources are invested \nin financial market development.28  \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n30. \nSince 2008, ADB has supported efforts to strengthen governance by improving planning \nprocesses, strengthening public financial management and pubic administration, and improving \nlegal  transparency  and  accessibility.29  Public  financial  management  reforms  are  at  an  early \nstage,  but  steady  progress  is  being  made.  For  example,  the government  has  adopted  several \n                                                \n25    J.  Rosengard  and  H.  Du.  2009.

Under  the  National  External  Debt  and Public \nDebt  Strategy,  2011\u20132020  aggregate  public  debt  information  has  been  published  for  the  first \ntime, but more needs to be done.30 In spite of good tax collection ratios (approximately 26% of \nGDP),  the  determination  of  actual  budget  deficits  is  compromised  by  the  application  of \nstandards  different  from  the  Global  Financial  Statistics  in  the  government\u2019s  official  accounts. \nFurther  efficiency  of  budget  allocations  and  service  delivery  requires  better  linkages  between \nmedium-term  planning  and  budgeting  and  between  capital  and  recurrent  expenditures.  The \ngovernment  is  reviewing  the  2002  Budget  Law  to  deepen  the  implementation  of  the  medium-\nterm  expenditure  framework  and  performance-based  budgeting,  and  to  improve  budget \nexecution,  monitoring,  and  implementation.  The treasury  and budget  management  information \nsystem  is  strengthening  government  budget  reporting  and  accounting.  Tax  management  and \ncustoms  modernization  reforms  are  underway,  increasing  the  transparency  of  administrative \nprocedures and reducing compliance costs for taxpayers. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n31. \nThe SEDS targets a 7%\u20138% annual economic growth rate, the creation of 8 million new \njobs,  and  an  average  annual  reduction  in  the  number  of  poor  households  of  2%\u20133%.  To \naccomplish these goals, the SEDS includes a focus on economic restructuring that is grounded, \nin  part,  on  capacity  and  financial  sector  development.  Under  the  FSDP,  money  market \ndevelopment will help the  government better manage inflation through monetary interventions, \nwhile a deeper government bond market will anchor commercial issuance and provide the long-\nterm  funding  to  much  needed  infrastructure  projects  and  social  expenditures.  The  ongoing \nrationalization of debt management and issuance will complement these efforts, leading to lower \nfinancing costs and increased fiscal space that could be allocated to social development goals. \nThe  FSDP  also  complements  subprogram  2  of  the  Second  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise \nDevelopment  Program,  which  will  strengthen  regulatory  frameworks  and  enhance  access  to \nfinance.31 \n \n32.  Moreover, a number of empirical studies have supported the direct relationship between \nfinancial  sector  development  and  poverty  reduction.32  The  link  between  economic  growth  and \nfinancial  sector  development  is  well  known  and  has  been  empirically  substantiated (para.  29). \nHowever, financial sector development also improves access to finance by reducing information \nand transaction costs. This allows more entrepreneurs, especially those less well-off, to obtain \nexternal finance. For these reasons, the poor will benefit from the FSDP because a deeper and \nmore  liquid  finance  sector  will  increase  access  to  finance  at  a  lower  cost  through  a  greater \nnumber  and  diversity  of  financial  providers  and  financial  products.  Finally,  financial  sector \ndevelopment  reduces  financial  instability,  which  is  becoming  more  common  in  increasingly \nglobal markets, and which has been shown to have a disproportionate impact on the poor. \n  \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n33. \nThe  FSDP  will  not  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  negatively  affect  indigenous \npeople or the environment. It is assigned category C for all safeguards  categories (involuntary \nresettlement, impact on indigenous people, and environmental impact). \n \n                                                \n30     Government of Viet Nam. 2012.

Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n34. \nAs a policy-based loan, FSDP is exposed to broader national and macroeconomic risks \nand  risks  associated  with  public  financial  management  and  corruption.    ADB  is  actively \ncoordinating with other development partners to mitigate these risks through policy dialogue to \nsupport  ongoing  efforts  to  enhance  macroeconomic  stability.  Annual  debt  sustainability \nassessments  are  being  conducted  to  monitor  macroeconomic  vulnerabilities,  and  the  ADB  is \nproviding  technical  assistance  to  strengthen  both  public  financial  management  and  debt \nmanagement. Among other initiatives, ADB will mitigate corruption risks through policy dialogue, \nincreased  monitoring  and  support  for  select  transparency  initiatives.  Program-specific  risks \ninclude  a  possible  decline  in  political  will  to  implement  technically  difficult  reforms,  and \nprotracted or inadequate efforts to advance SOE reform and bank recapitalization which could \nresult  in  a  loss  of  investor  confidence.  The  policy  goals  of  SEDS  2011\u20132020  and  the  recent \ncompletion  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  first  FSAP  provide  evidence  of  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to \nreform. Under an ongoing project, ADB is supporting the restructuring of selected SOEs through \na  process  which  can  be  replicated.33  In  addition,  the  government  has  taken  steps  to  address \nbanking  sector  vulnerabilities  by  establishing  an  asset  management  company,  resolution \nstrategies, and authorizing higher levels of foreign ownership. Specific risks and corresponding \nmitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan..34 \n  \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES   \n\n \n35. \nThe  government  and  the  SBV  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  program \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n36. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  loan  would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank and recommend that the \nBoard approve \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nthe programmatic approach for the Financial Sector Deepening Program, and \nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR29,238,000  to  the  Socialist \nRepublic  of  Viet  Nam  for  subprogram  1  of  the  Financial  Sector  Deepening \nProgram,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an  interest  charge  at  the \nrate  of  2%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  thereafter;  for  a  term  of  25 \nyears, including a grace period of 5 years, and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n\n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n\n12 November 2013\n\n                                                \n33  ADB.  2009.
