I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $6,000,000 or dram equivalent to Finca Armenia UCO CJSC (FIAR) for the Rural \nFinancial Inclusion Project in Armenia.1 \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n2.  Armenia\u2019s economy has undergone profound transformation since independence from \nthe  former  Soviet  Union  in  1991.  Ambitious  reforms,  as  well  as  the  inflow  of  capital  and \nremittances, helped create a market-oriented economy. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth \nfor 2007, before the onset of the 2008 financial crisis, was 13.7%. Economic growth was driven \nby the real estate and construction industries, as well as strong remittance inflows. Armenia has \none of the highest emigration rates in the world with net migration flows of \u20133.2% from 2008 to \n2012.2 Remittances  from  migrant  workers  therefore  play  an  important  role  in  Armenia\u2019s \neconomy and are estimated at 16% of GDP. This is twice as much as foreign direct investment \nand four times more than official government inflows, such that remittances finance roughly two-\nfifths of Armenia\u2019s imports. The large Armenian workforce in the Russian Federation contributes \nbetween 80% and 90% of all remittances.3 Armenia\u2019s economy is very closely tied to  the \nRussian Federation because it is the country\u2019s main trade and investment partner. \n \n3.  The global financial crisis hurt the country considerably\u2014GDP growth slowed to 2.2% in \n2010, and only slightly recovered thereafter to 3% in 2015.4 Rural and urban poverty in Armenia \nincreased sharply. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that 32% of the population \nlives below the poverty line, compared with 28% in 2008. The geography of poverty in Armenia \nalso shows marked gaps between the capital city of Yerevan (25.2%), rural areas (29.9%), and \nother  urban  areas  (35.1%).5 Many  Armenians  are  engaged  in  low-productivity  agriculture, \ntrapped in low-wage jobs, or suffer from long-term unemployment (footnote 2). Owing to the \ndeteriorating macroeconomic performance of the Russian Federation, which has added stress \nto the Armenian economy, remittances declined significantly since 2014. At the end of 2014, \nArmenia experienced a 20% drop in the value of the dram. However, the currency depreciation \nwas  still  less  than  in  other  neighboring  countries  and  has  since  stabilized,  with  slight \nappreciation during 2016. Thanks to a recovery in the industrial sector (excluding construction) \nand services, the economy is strengthening somewhat\u2014growth is estimated at 2% for 2016 and \n2.3% for 2017 (ADB forecast). \n \n4.  Micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and  agriculture.  Micro,  small,  and \nmedium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) account for the vast majority of enterprises in Armenia but \ncontribute a disproportionately low amount to GDP (43%), employment (41.7%), foreign trade, \nand  foreign  investment.  The  informal  economy  represents  a  significant  part  of  Armenia\u2019s \neconomy and has a particular effect on MSMEs, especially in the retail sector, where up to 50% \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  EV Consulting. 2014.

Yerevan. \n ", "2  \nof total sales are unregistered.6 According to ADB estimates, the informal economy represents \n11.3% of total GDP and is highest in agriculture (22.4%), construction (15.4%), and wholesale \nand retail trade (14.8%), the sectors with the largest MSME share. Given the large share of the \ninformal economy, the importance of MSMEs may be underestimated in official statistics. \n \n5.  Agriculture is one of the most important sectors in the Armenian economy, accounting \nfor more than 35% (2015) of total employment. It is the largest contributor to GDP at 21.9%.7 \nArmenian agriculture consists of 68% plant growing and 32% animal husbandry. Small farms \nand households play a key role in the production of whole milk and meat, for instance. They \ncontribute more than 90% of the country\u2019s meat production. The sector has significant potential \nfor  growth  through  further  investment  and  productivity  improvements.  However,  agriculture \nproduction and value chains still lack adequate investment and working capital. The majority of \nArmenian banks refrain from agriculture financing because of the high risks of the sector. In \n2015, only 5% of total commercial banking credit went to agriculture.8 Despite these limitations \nand challenges, the sector has performed well from 2013-2015 and recorded a growth rate of \n13.2% in 2015, although helped by very favorable weather conditions. \n \n6.  Finance sector. The Armenian finance sector is heavily dominated by banks, which \naccount  for  about  90%  of  sector  assets.  The  banking  subsector  consists  of  21  banks,  is \nrelatively fragmented, and dominated by foreign-owned banks, which account for over 50% of \ntotal banking assets. The largest bank, Ameriabank, has a market share of around 14.8% in \nterms of total assets. To drive consolidation and strengthen the banking system, the Central \nBank of Armenia has increased the minimum capital requirements for commercial banks from \nAMD5 billion ($10 million) to AMD30 billion ($60 million) by 1 January 2017. \n \n7.  Low access to finance is a significant problem in Armenia. Only 18% of adults aged 15 \nand above have a bank account compared with an average of 43% for lower middle-income \ncountries.  The  World  Bank  estimates  that,  out  of  the  130,000  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) in Armenia, 50% have no access to finance, and this figure increases to \n60%\u201370% in rural areas.9 The banking industry lacks some important funding tools (e.g., a well-\nfunctioning interbank market or developed capital markets) and is not effectively supplemented \nby nonbank financial institutions, nor supported by institutional investors. Banking has low credit \npenetration\u2014credit to the private sector stands at less than 45% of GDP (2014) compared with \n60% in the Russian Federation and Ukraine, 50% in Georgia, and 38% in Azerbaijan. Bank \nlending is highly concentrated in Yerevan (two-thirds of total bank lending), even though two-\nthirds of the people live in the regions.10 Low population density, riskiness of agriculture loans, \nlack of financial information on borrowers, and lack of real estate collateral in rural areas are \nmajor obstacles to lending in the regions. Given the need to increase access to finance in \nArmenia, some international financial institutions (IFIs) and bilateral institutions are active in the \ncountry and play an important role in providing finance. \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s nonsovereign support for private finance in Armenia has focused on funding \nbanks that support MSME activities, in addition to the Trade Finance Program. In 2011, ADB \n                                                \n6  European Investment Bank. 2014. Private Sector Financing and the role of Risk-bearing Instruments. Luxembourg. \n7  WB. 2016.

", "3 \napproved loans totaling $65 million to four Armenian banks for onlending to SMEs.11 Continued \nsupport is needed to strengthen the finance sector and help develop MSMEs, as well as the \nagriculture sector in Armenia. The MSME funding gap in Armenia is most evident in the case of \naffordable  local  currency  loans,  especially  at  a  longer  tenor,  because  commercial  banks \nthemselves do not have access to such funds to onlend. Banks deem a large number of \nMSMEs \u201cunbankable\u201d, especially those that lack the required collateral. Such entities are more \nlikely  to  be  in rural  areas,  engaged  in  agriculture,  and  classified  as either  micro  or  small \nenterprises. In addition, insufficient financial literacy means that many MSMEs are not aware of \nall the products available to them. Operating in Armenia for over 15 years, FIAR, a part of \nFINCA  International  Inc.\u2019s  network,  was  identified  by  ADB  as  a  good  candidate  for  local \ncurrency  funding  to  help  improve  access  to  finance  in  Armenia\u2019s  rural  regions.  FIAR  has \n38 branches spread across the country and a strong emphasis on rural and agriculture lending. \nIt also undertakes financial literacy training to help raise awareness and understanding of \nstandard bank products. In 2015, FIAR was recognized as the year\u2019s \u201cBest Credit Organization \nin Armenia\u201d, according to the results of a public opinion poll, conducted by the Armenian \nrepresentation of Gallup International. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n9.  Founded in 1999, FIAR has grown to become one of the largest nonbank financial \ninstitutions in Armenia, with 40% market share among the top five MFIs.12 Thanks to FIAR\u2019s \nstrong management team and 651 committed staff, FIAR successfully reached new clients in \nArmenia\u2019s underbanked regions. As of 31 December 2015, FIAR had an outstanding loan \nportfolio of $60.6 million, serving more than 52,000 clients, 85% of which belong to regions \noutside Yerevan. FIAR has developed a rural banking model from inception, based on the \nvillage banking model pioneered by its parent, FINCA International Inc. It has designed specific \nproducts  for  rural  and  agriculture  customers  and  operates  through  an  expansive  branch \nnetwork, giving it a unique advantage in the Armenian market. The FINCA brand name is well \nknown and trusted in Armenia, which helps FIAR attract and retain clients. FIAR is an equal \nopportunity employer and makes considerable efforts to service women customers. Women \nborrowers currently represent 30% of the loan volume and 35% of outstanding loans. \n \n10.  FIAR caters to low-income individuals and micro and small enterprises in rural and urban \nareas engaged in manufacturing, services, and agriculture and seeking to expand their business \ncapacity. FIAR competes with other microfinance lenders as well as with informal lenders. To a \nlimited extent, FIAR also competes with banks. However, micro enterprises, which are the main \ntarget clients of FIAR, are underserved by commercial banks. Banks extend consumer credit to \na number of current or potential FIAR borrowers, but competition with FIAR\u2019s core business \nfrom  banks\u2019  consumer  lending  business  is  limited  because  consumer  lending  is  heavily \nregulated, products cannot easily be customized to clients\u2019 needs, and many of FIAR\u2019s target \nclients would not be able to avail of it on a large enough scale. \n \n11.  The primary value proposition that FIAR offers to its target customers is access to credit \non terms that differ from those of banks, and better customer service. Its credit products feature \nlow collateral requirements. FIAR\u2019s clients are low-income entrepreneurs and farm households \nthat generate income from diversified farming and business. FIAR expects to grow its loan \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendations of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Senior Loans to \nACBA  Credit  Agricole  Bank,  Ameriabank,  Ardshininvestbank,  Inecobank  for  the  Small  and  Medium-Sized \nEnterprise Finance Program. Manila. \n12 Union of Credit Organizations of the Republic of Armenia. 2016. Quarterly Financial Report April\u2013June 2016. \nYerevan. \n ", "4  \nportfolio from $54.3 million in September FY2016 by 4% annually for the next 4 years. Given the \nchallenging macroeconomic situation at present, management concentrates on prudent lending, \ncustomer service, and retention of clients, rather than on aggressive expansion. FIAR\u2019s 5-year \nbusiness plan aims to deepen the relationship with existing customers by offering a broader \nrange of financial products in addition to meeting their credit needs, such as remittances, money \ntransfers, and exchanges. It also plans to work with third-party insurance providers to create \nother value-added offerings for its clients, i.e., health insurance and motor third-party liability \ninsurance. Moreover, in 2016 FIAR has introduced a consumer loan product and plans to \nintroduce renovation and home improvement loans. \n \n12.  During 2016, FIAR is phasing out its two group loan products (group loans and group \nrural loans), which currently represent 3.2% of the total loan portfolio (September 2016). From \n2017-2021, FIAR will concentrate fully on offering individual loans, individual rural loans, and \nloans to SMEs, in addition to potentially introducing new products as mentioned in paragraph \n11. As of September 2016, individual loans made up 39% of the portfolio, individual rural loans \ncomprised 48%, and loans to SMEs totaled 9% of its portfolio. The portfolio mix between these \nthree products is expected to stay fairly constant over the next 5 years. The shift to purely \nindividual lending is market-driven since demand for group loans has been decreasing. In \naddition, group loans have proven to be of lower credit quality but are costly to monitor. The \naverage loan term is  26 months for individual loans,  27 months for individual rural loans, \n40 months for loans to SMEs, and 23 months for group loans. In phasing out group loans, which \nhave a maximum tenor of 96 weeks, FIAR will also shift to longer-tenor lending\u2014168 weeks for \nindividual loans and 240 weeks for loans to SMEs. \n  \n13.  FIAR\u2019s asset growth has mainly been funded by loans from IFIs, microfinance funds, and \ncommercial banks, with which FIAR has established excellent relationships. It has received \nloans from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the European Bank for Reconstruction \nand  Development  (EBRD),  the  Black  Sea  Trade  and  Development  Bank,  DWM,  and \nresponsAbility. Commercial bank loans tend to be shorter in tenor at typically 12 months. To \nfund its financing gap of $30 million in 2017, FIAR intends to diversify its lending relationships \nand work with new IFIs such as ADB. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n14.  Ownership.  FIAR  is  wholly  owned  by  Netherlands-based  FINCA  Microfinance \nCo\u00f6peratief UA, which is wholly owned by FINCA Microfinance Holding LLC, Delaware (FMH). \nFMH is incorporated in the state of Delaware as a for-profit corporation and is owned to 62% by \nFINCA International Inc. and to 38% by IFIs (such as the Netherlands Development Finance \nCompany or FMO, IFC, and German development cooperation through KfW) and microfinance \ninvestment funds (e.g., Triple Jump and Triodos). It has adopted high integrity and responsible \nfinance standards, and is regulated by the Central Bank of Armenia. \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s review of the ownership structure does not give ADB cause to believe that such \nentity has been established, or is being used for cross-border tax evasion, money laundering, or \nterrorism financing in the jurisdictions involved in the investment. \n \n16.  Management and governance structure. FIAR\u2019s corporate governance policies have \nbeen heavily influenced by its international shareholders and lenders, such as the IFIs. Local \nmanagement is of high quality with many years of experience in the Armenian market. The chief \nexecutive officer, Hrachya Tokhmakhyan, has been with FIAR since 2007 and was appointed to \nthe top position in 2013. The chief financial officer, Anush Petrosyan, joined FIAR in 2013 with ", "5 \nmore than 10 years of external audit experience in leading audit companies in Armenia. The \nboard of directors consists of five members, both internal and external. The Chairman of the \nBoard is part of the senior management of FINCA International Inc. FIAR has a separate audit \ncommittee appointed by the general meeting of shareholders. The committee consists of at \nleast three members. \n \n17.  Risk management. FIAR has a number of internal policies and procedures approved by \nits board of directors and covering all aspects of risk, including credit, operational, market, \nliquidity, interest rate, and compliance risks. FIAR has a centralized credit department that \nreviews all loans above $5,000. The credit committee composition depends on the loan amount \nbeing considered. For any new loan exceeding $25,000, attendance of a management board \nmember is required. For each loan appraisal, credit assessment is done on the basis of the \nclient\u2019s income declaration, credit bureau data, and FIAR\u2019s own credit data. Post disbursement, \nFIAR continues the risk assessment of its clients with regular monitoring and on-site visits. FIAR \nis implementing a new customer relationship management software that is expected to shorten \ncredit origination time. Automation of certain functions is expected to lower the administration \ncosts, and the savings could then be passed on to the customer. \n \n18.  FIAR\u2019s  lending  process  is  determined  by  the  credit  policy  and  related  procedures \napproved by the Board of Directors. It includes origination, disbursement, loan management and \nsupervision, and loan workout. Similar to the developments at other subsidiaries, FIAR\u2019s lending \nmodel shifted from group to individual loans in 2013. For loans of less than AMD750,000 \n($1,500), no collateral is required but a spouse or any other family member must act as co-\nborrower (guarantor), and a guaranty of all formal or informal participants in the business is also \nmandatory. Loans in excess of AMD750,000 ($1,500) require either varying types of physical \ncollateral or external guarantors. \n  \nD.  Financial Performance \n19.  Capital adequacy. FIAR is well capitalized with a tier 1 ratio of 18.9% (FY2014: 19.6% \nand FY2013: 19.3%) and a total capital ratio of 19.7% (FY2014: 21.2% and FY2013: 20.9%). \nThe regulatory minimum is 10%. Under FINCA International Inc.\u2019s capital policy, subsidiaries \nwere historically required to maintain common tangible equity equal of at least 20% of total \nassets. In FY2014, certain subsidiaries, including FIAR, were granted approval to maintain a \n15% limit. No dividends were paid for during 2014 and 2015, allowing for some buildup of \nretained earnings. \n \n20.  Portfolio and asset quality. FIAR\u2019s loan portfolio is well diversified, with an average \ntenor of 23 months. Given its high number of borrowers and small average loan size of $1,160 \n(2016), it is highly granular, providing a favorable risk profile. FIAR\u2019s rural presence is strong, \nwith agriculture and food processing loans representing 50% of its loan book (2016). The bulk \n(78%) of its lending is outside Yerevan. Other loan segments include trade (24%), industry and \nproduction (7%), construction (3%), and transport (5%). FIAR\u2019s loan portfolio is denominated in \ndram (45%) and in US dollars (55%). While it is highly concentrated in the agriculture sector, the \nagriculture portfolio itself is also highly diversified: 75% involves mixed farming by individuals or \nbusinesses engaged in several types of agriculture production. \n \n21.  FIAR\u2019s credit policy and underwriting standards are prudent and supported by a rigorous \nclient selection and monitoring process. FIAR\u2019s nonperforming loan ratio increased to 4.01% in \nFY2015 (from 1% in FY2014 and 1.93% in FY2013) as a result of the difficult economic situation \nin FY2015 and the depreciation of the dram in the fourth quarter of 2014, which caused financial \n ", "6  \nstrain  on  borrowers  of  US  dollar  loans.  As  noted,  55%  (August  2016)  of  the  portfolio  is \ndenominated in US dollar loans. FIAR has been proactive in rectifying the situation through \nearly restructuring of outstanding loans, as well as the engagement of a law firm that specializes \nin  collections.  Given  the  improved  economic  outlook  and  the  stability  of  the  dram, \nnonperforming loans are expected to decrease. In addition, the weaker dram is benefiting the \nexport sector, particularly agriculture and food processing, which constitute 50% of FIAR\u2019s loan \nbook.  In  FY2015,  restructured  loans  accounted  for  62%  of  nonperforming  loans.  FIAR\u2019s \nprovisioning policy is prudent, with loan loss provisions representing 39% of nonperforming \nloans (FY2015). This is a decline from 55% in FY2014 but decreasing nonperforming loans and \nincreasing profitability will boost the ability to increase the provisioning coverage. The 20 largest \nloans represent only 0.2% of FIAR\u2019s portfolio. \n \n22.  Earnings and profitability. For FY2015, net income fell to $0.1 million, from $1.3 million \nin FY2014, owing to the challenging economic situation, the devaluation of the dram, and higher \nprovisioning. Return on average equity decreased \n to  1.19%  in  FY2015, from  11.24%  in  FY2014.  FIAR  expects  a  recovery  in  profitability  in \nFY2016 and forecasts after-tax profit of $0.9 million and return on average equity of 7.6% for the \nyear.  Since  March  2016,  FIAR\u2019s  monthly  profit  on  average  exceeded  $100,000  and  is \nsignificantly ahead of budget. The net interest margin is healthy and stood at 17.63% in 2015, \ncompared with 21.19% in 2014\u2014a result of the changing currency composition of the loan \nportfolio as customers once again preferred US dollar loans because of lower interest rates and \nthe stability of the dram. Typical for MFIs with a high unit cost, the margin is high. FIAR\u2019s cost\u2013\nincome ratio was 84% in 2015, compared with 79% in 2014. This is expected to fall with \nincreased profitability, and FIAR is considering closing a costly branch in Yerevan and instead \nopening an additional branch in a rural area to save costs. \n \n23.  Funding and liquidity. As a nonbank and non-deposit-taking financial institution, FIAR\u2019s \nfunding entirely relies on borrowings and equity. FIAR depends mainly on funding by IFIs, \nmicrofinance investment funds, and commercial banks. As of May 2016, FIAR had signed \nagreements with local banks and International Financial Institutions (IFIs) for total funding of $10 \nmillion. The average tenor of these borrowings is 2 years. FIAR is in negotiations with another \nIFI for a $6 million, 4-year loan to be funded in dram. Currently, FIAR\u2019s local currency funding \ncomes from Armenian commercial banks and is very short term with a maximum tenor of 1 year. \nIn 2015, 67% of borrowed funds were in US dollars, compared with 46% in 2014. At year-end \n2015, the ratio of gross loans to total assets was 93.7% (89.7% in 2014). \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n24.  ADB will provide a loan to FIAR in an amount of up to $6 million or dram equivalent. \nADB\u2019s funding will be used to support MSMEs13 and the agriculture sector, primarily outside of \nthe capital. Up to 75% of ADB\u2019s funding will go to MSMEs outside of Yerevan, and up to 70% \nwill be used to onlend to agri-borrowers. ADB will also be providing technical assistance (TA) in \nan amount of up to $200,000 funded from an existing TA.14 The TA will support the development \nof a credit scoring system and \u201cSmart\u201d certification15 of FIAR. \n                                                \n13 For the purpose of the loan, MSMEs are defined in accordance with the definition of the European Union as having \nan annual business turnover of up to AMD1,500 million and up to 250 employees. \n14 ADB. 2014.

These will include (i) quarterly unaudited management accounts, \n(ii) quarterly  compliance  certificates  for  financial  covenants,  (iii)  semiannual  performance \nreports, (iv) annual audited financial statements, and (v) annual gender, environmental and \nsocial safeguard monitoring and compliance reports. \n \n26.  Evaluation. Monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB regularly, and at \nleast  annually.  The  first  report  will  be  submitted  no  later  than  12  months  after  the  first \ndisbursement. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n27.  Economic diversification and widening of access to finance. As noted, access to \nfinance is very constrained for lower-income individuals and smaller enterprises in Armenia, \nparticularly in rural regions. Banks do not generally service this segment because of perceived \nhigher risks, difficulties in obtaining information, and collateral requirements. ADB\u2019s funding will \nsupport FIAR\u2019s funding to this customer segment and diversification into new financial products. \nIn addition, ADB\u2019s funding will support FIAR\u2019s efforts to lend to women. The long tenor of the \nADB loan will support FIAR\u2019s growth focus on individual loans that have relatively longer tenors, \nthereby enhancing the impact of the transaction. \n \n28.  Access to local currency funding. ADB\u2019s funding is expected to be in local currency. \nADB\u2019s Treasury Department has obtained the necessary approvals to raise dram through a \nlocal currency bond issuance. To date, EBRD and IFC have issued local currency bonds in the \nmarket. Although the market is small, preliminary indications are that demand is strong enough \nto support $6 million equivalent of funding. Providing local currency funding to FIAR will help \nreduce the currency mismatch and lower the foreign exchange risk for FIAR\u2019s borrowers. More \nbroadly, access to long-term funding for nonbank financial companies and banks in Armenia is \ndifficult. ADB\u2019s funding will help narrow this market gap and thus strengthen the finance sector. \n \n29.  Better risk management and consumer protection practices. The TA will help FIAR \nimprove its risk management by introducing a credit scoring system that will allow FIAR to \nincrease  the  quality  of  its  credit  underwriting  process,  potentially  lowering  the  risk  of \nnonperforming loans, and reduce the cost of loan processing for loans of up to $5,000 by at \nleast 50%. Such an increase in both efficiency and quality of service will enable FIAR to serve a \ngreater number of low-income and rural customers. Under the TA, FIAR will also participate in \n\u201cSmart\u201d certification, which will help it strengthen its consumer protection practices. \u201cSmart\u201d \ncertification  will  award  FIAR  a  client  protection  certification,  an  independent,  third-party \nevaluation to publicly recognize financial institutions that meet adequate standards of care in \nhow they treat clients. \n \nD.  Risks \n30.   Country  risk.  Armenia  has  shown  resilience  to  the  current  adverse  economic \nenvironment when compared with other countries in the region. However, financial institutions \nwill continue to be exposed to the macroeconomic situation, as well as to any political tensions. \nDissatisfaction with President Serzh Sargsyan continued to rise, and political instability remains \n ", "8  \na risk. A resolution of the Nagorny Karabakh dispute with Azerbaijan (fighting erupted between \nArmenian and Azerbaijani forces on 2 April 2016) and normalization of relations with Turkey are  \nunlikely in the near future. Armenia\u2019s accession to the Eurasian Economic Union, which was \nlaunched on 1 January 2015, has further increased economic and political dependence on the \nRussian Federation. The recession in the Russian Federation and lower remittances will remain \na drag on growth. ADB expects Armenia\u2019s GDP to grow by 2% in 2016. \n \n31.   Asset quality. Asset quality has weakened following the 2014 currency devaluation and \nmacroeconomic downturn. Although the nonperforming loan ratio is lower than the industry \naverage, the current challenging economic environment and any future devaluation of the dram \nmay expose FIAR to higher credit risk. FIAR is limiting this risk by thorough due diligence on \nborrowers and prudent underwriting and collection practices. \n \n32.   Currency risk. The dram has demonstrated some resilience relative to other regional \ncurrencies. It has stabilized since the 20% depreciation in the fourth quarter of 2014 and no \nfurther depreciation is expected. FIAR\u2019s loan book is split almost equally between the dram and \nUS dollar. FINCA has a foreign currency risk management policy in place, and is mitigates \ncurrency risk  with foreign  exchange forward  and  swap  deals,  by  increasing  or  decreasing \nlending in the respective currency, and by sourcing adequate funding from IFIs and commercial \nbanks.  If ADB is able to provide a dram loan, this will also help lessen foreign exchange risk for \nFIAR and its borrowers. \n \n33.   Profitability. Increased provisioning led to a decline in profitability in 2015. FIAR is \nexpecting  a  recovery  in  2016.  Midyear  results  show  that  since  March,  monthly  profit  has \nexceeded $100,000 on average and reached $267,556 in September, permitting some capital \nbuildup. Nonetheless, FIAR\u2019s small size and limited economies of scale has created a high \noperating cost base. FIAR\u2019s growth focus on the regions and efforts to boost the efficiency of its \nrelatively costly business model help mitigate this risk. Net interest margins remain strong and \nare expected to be stable.  \n \n34.  The proposed loan of up to $6,000,000 to FIAR has an obligor risk rating and a facility \nrisk rating of NSO 10. \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n35.  Impacts. The impacts will be (i) improved availability of credit to MSMEs and agriculture, \nand (ii) expanded private financial services in Armenia\u2019s regions outside of Yerevan. \n \n36.  Outcome. Sustainable growth in MSME- and agriculture-related loans demonstrated, as \nevidenced by an increase in the number of microfinance loans outstanding from 27,474 to \n28,862, and of agribusiness loans outstanding from 24,613 to 25,946 by 2022. \n \n37.  Output. FIAR will expand its financing to MSMEs and agriculture in rural areas, as \nevidenced by an increase in disbursements from $26.9 million to $34.1 million for agribusiness \nloans, and from $26.0 million to $39.3 million for microfinance loans by 2020. \n ", "9 \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n38.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. Under ADB\u2019s Midterm Review \nof Strategy 2020, ADB aims to strengthen its support for the finance sector by assisting the \ndevelopment  of  financial  infrastructure,  institutions,  and  products  and  services;  and  by \npromoting inclusive growth.16 FIAR\u2019s emphasis on lending to segments with a high potential for \nemployment and income generation will support inclusive growth. The ADB loan will help the \nborrower provide loans to MSMEs to realize their investment needs. This is consistent with the \ngovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  promote  growth  and  economic  diversification,  and  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy with Armenia, 2014\u20132018.17 \n \n39.  Consistency  with  ADB  operations.  ADB  plays  a  tangible  role  in  supporting  the \ndeepening of financial services in Armenia. In 2011, ADB supported four banks in Armenia \nthrough  senior  loans  totaling  $65  million.  ACBA  Credit  Agricole,  Ameriabank, \nArdshininvestbank, and Inecobank were the banks selected in ADB\u2019s Small and Medium-Sized \nEnterprise Finance Program (footnote 11), through which ADB loan proceeds were onlent to \nSMEs. The loan to FIAR will continue ADB\u2019s efforts  to strengthen and develop Armenia\u2019s \nfinancial market and support MSMEs. It complements sovereign programs in the finance sector \nsuch as the Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Support Sector Development Program (2012).18 \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n40.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  senior  loan  is \nclassified category FI based on potential impacts on the environment, and category FI treated \nas  C  for  impacts  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  Subloans  under \nenvironment category A, and social safeguard categories A and B will not be financed under the \nloan. The subloans under the proposed ADB loan are expected to have minimal or no adverse \nenvironmental and social impacts. No land acquisition, physical or economic displacements, nor \nimpact on indigenous communities is foreseen in relation to any activities of the subborrowers. \nThe environmental and social management system established by FIAR will be enhanced to \ncomply with the Safeguard Policy Statement, and will be adopted before the first disbursement \nfor subloan financing. FIAR will apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, exclude all \nprojects  that  will  have  adverse  environmental  and  social  safeguard  impacts,  ensure  that \ninvestments using ADB funds abide by applicable national laws and regulations, and comply \nwith the Safeguard Policy Statement. FIAR will confirm this in its periodic report to ADB. FIAR \nwill monitor and provide information on its compliance with the Safeguard Policy Statement and \nwith  relevant  national  laws,  standards,  and  guidelines  in  the  annual  report.  The  loan  is \ncategorized as some gender elements because the number of subloans for businesses owned \nby women is expected to increase by 7.9% (microfinance segment), 72% (SMEs), and 6.4% \n(agribusinesses) by 2020. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n41.  FIAR was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific.

Investment Limitations \n42.  The  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \ninvestment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n43.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter), 19  ADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the \nGovernment of Armenia has no objection to the proposed assistance to FIAR. ADB will enter \ninto  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  following \napproval of the proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n44.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \n$6,000,000 or dram equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to Finca Armenia UCO \nCJSC for the Rural Financial Inclusion Project in Armenia, with such terms and conditions as \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the \nBoard. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n \n15 November 2016 \n \n                                                \n19 ADB. 1966.
