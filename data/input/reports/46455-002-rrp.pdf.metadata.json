This  will  be  achieved  through  the \ndelivery  and  installation  of  new  diesel-fired  generation  to  provide  reliable  base-load  power  for \nthe  NUC,  allowing  it  to  retire  older  generation  assets  and  perform  scheduled  refurbishment  of \nexisting units to extend the service life of such units. The project will also repair the roof of the \nexisting structure housing the NUC\u2019s generators to shield them from the elements and provide a \nsafer working environment for NUC employees.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nNauru is a Pacific island country with a total population of 10,000 people. Access to grid \nelectricity  is  universal  but  the  supply  is  unreliable  because  of  underinvestment  in,  and  poor \nmaintenance  of,  generation  and  distribution  assets.  The  cost  of  generation  is  also  extremely \nhigh because of the poor condition and inefficiency of  the NUC\u2019s generators. The powerhouse \n(physical  structure)  is  also  in  poor  condition,  which  represents  a  vulnerability  to  Nauru\u2019s \nelectricity supply security. \n \n4. \nInstalled generation currently comprises eight units with a total nominal capacity of 12.90 \nmegawatts  (MW).  However,  Nauru\u2019s  current  available  capacity  is  only  3.70  MW  because  two \nunits  are  inoperable  and  the  output  of  the  remaining  units  is  reduced  because  of  their  poor \ncondition. Current peak load is 3.75 MW. Scheduled service outages (rationing) are a constant \nfeature of electricity service in Nauru. Unscheduled outages due to faults are frequent. \n \n5. \nAs  in  other  Pacific  developing  member  countries,  Nauru  has  established  ambitious \ntargets for increasing the share of  renewable energy generation in its system. But, as in other \nparts  of  the  Pacific  where  significant  intermittent  renewable  energy  generation  sources  are \nbeing  introduced  into  legacy  diesel-based  systems,  Nauru  will  remain  reliant  on  reliable  and \nefficient thermal generation (i.e., diesel) for its base load, and for system stability and reliability, \nfor  the  foreseeable  future.  Nauru\u2019s  current  diesel  generation  equipment  is  neither  reliable  nor \nefficient. \n \n6. \nAddressing  reliability  and  efficiency  shortcomings  in  Nauru\u2019s  current  diesel  generation \nequipment  is  of  first-order  priority  to  improve  service  reliability  and  mitigate  the  risk  of \ncatastrophic  failure  of  the  NUC\u2019s  power  generation.  The  NUC\u2019s  investment  priorities  include \nintroducing  3.0  MW  of  new  diesel-fired  generation  under  the  project  to  replace  existing \ngeneration, improve efficiency and reliability, and reduce fuel costs. The NUC estimates that this \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  Electricity  Supply \n\nSecurity and Sustainability (TA 8524-NAU). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nwill  result  in  a  20%  improvement  in  generation  efficiency  from  the  existing  3.4  kilowatt-hours \n(kWh) generated per liter of diesel consumed to 4.1 kWh. \n \n7. \nThe  consequences  of  the  failings  of  Nauru\u2019s  power  system  are  far-reaching.  The  high \ncost of power generation is a significant burden on the state budget in the form of fuel subsidy to \nthe  NUC  (at  least  $7.0  million  per  year  \u2013  24%  of  the  2011-2012  national  budget  of  $29.5 \nmillion).  Development  assistance  resources  are  consistently  diverted  to  support  the  NUC, \nincluding  for  capital  investments  that  would  not  be  necessary  (at  least  in  such  volumes)  if  the \nNUC\u2019s  assets  were  better  maintained.  Nauru\u2019s  consumers  are  frequently  forced  to  endure \npower outages and some customers, especially commercial customers, have to resort to high-\ncost  independent  generation.  The  diversion  of  government  funding  to  prop  up  the  NUC\u2019s \noperations  away  from  more  productive  social  and  infrastructure  investments  (e.g.,  education \nand  health  care)  and  the  high  cost  of  independent  generation  (where  available)  has  negative \nimpacts on Nauru\u2019s development and the quality of life of its inhabitants. \n \n8. \nFor  the  NUC  to  operate  sustainably  while  avoiding  diversion  of  scarce  government \nfunding to subsidize its operations, it must be able generate sufficient revenue to cover its long-\nterm  costs,  including  a prudent  maintenance and  capital  investment  program. The  adoption of \nan appropriate tariff structure, with due consideration of the legitimate needs of some of Nauru\u2019s \npoorer  residential  customers,  is  crucial for  the NUC\u2019s  transition from  being  a  perennial  burden \non the government budget to becoming a solvent, efficient power utility. \n \n9. \nProviding for this transition and improving the NUC\u2019s operations will generate significant \nbenefits to Nauru\u2019s people and economy. The reduced burden on the state budget will allow its \nlimited  resources  to  be  directed  towards  more  productive  public  investments  (e.g.,  education, \nhealth  care,  or  other  infrastructure).  The  benefits  of  improved  service  reliability  for  household \nand commercial consumers of electricity are self-evident. Finally, provision of reliable base load \ngeneration will allow eventual integration of intermittent generation from renewable sources that \nwould not be possible with the current unreliable system. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  project\u2019s  impact  will  be  increased  economic  activity\u2014all  NUC  customers  will  enjoy \n10. \nmore  dependable  supply  with  fewer  outages,  and  the  NUC  will  resume  supply  to  commercial \nand  industrial  customers.  The  project\u2019s  outcome  will  be  increased  reliability,  lower  cost,  and \ngreater sustainability of power generation in Nauru. The incidence of power outages is expected \nto decrease by 50% by June 2016, and generation efficiency  is expected to increase from 3.4 \nkWh per liter of fuel consumed to 4.1 kWh. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \n\nThe project will have three outputs: \n(i) \n\nNew  diesel-fired  generation  put  into  service. A new, medium-speed, 2.6\u20133.0 \nMW diesel generator will be installed at the NUC, together with related auxiliary \nequipment; NUC personnel will be trained on its operation and maintenance. \nRepair and/or replacement of existing roof and structural reinforcements of \nNUC\u2019s  powerhouse.  The  NUC  powerhouse  roof  will  be  rehabilitated  and  all \nasbestos will be removed and safely disposed of. \nEfficient  project  implementation. The NUC will be assisted by the design and \nsupervision consultants (DSCs) during project implementation. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n \n\n\f3 \n\nAmounta \n\n  \n3.23 \n0.79 \n0.41 \n\n4.43 \n \n0.03 \n0.09 \n0.20 \n0.10 \n0.08 \n0.07 \n0.57 \n0.54 \n5.54 \n\nD. \n \n12. \n \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n\n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $5.54 million (Table 1). \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\nBase Costb \n1. \n2. \n3. \n\n \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\nEfficient generation installed at the Nauru Utilities Corporation \nNauru Utilities Corporation powerhouse roof repaired \nEfficient project implementation \n\nB. \nGovernment In-Kind Contributions \n             1.

Nevertheless, \ntariffs still remain far below cost-recovery levels and are highly distortionary. As the government \npursues  gradual  reduction  of  direct  and  indirect  subsidy  to  the  NUC\u2019s  power  operations,  the \ncorporation\u2019s revenues from tariffs will need to become sufficient to maintain its operations over \nthe  long  term.  The  proposed  TA  will  help  the  government  and  NUC  prepare  a  schedule  of \ngradual  tariff  adjustments  to  support  this,  with  a  target  of  50%  cost-recovery  from  tariffs  by \nDecember 2016. \n\n                                                \n6  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \nTo support the NUC\u2019s long-term viability and the sustainability of the investments under \n23. \nthe proposed project, ADB will provide TA to the NUC and the Government of Nauru to develop \npolicy options for ensuring that the NUC\u2019s revenues from power sales are sufficient to cover the \ncost of power service to its customers. \n \n24. \nThe  TA  will  (i)  analyze  and  confirm  the  NUC\u2019s  long-run  marginal  cost  of  electricity \nservice,  consistent  with  established  best  practices  for  determining  a  utility\u2019s  rate  base,  fixed \ncosts  (including  prudent  maintenance  and  reinvestment  costs),  and  marginal  operating  costs \n(e.g.,  fuel);  (ii)  identify  and  value  all  existing  subsidies  provided  to  the  NUC  from  the \nGovernment  of  Nauru,  between  and  among  the  NUC\u2019s  distinct  operations  (power,  water,  and \nfuel tank management operations) and to and among different classes of electricity customers; \n(iii)  propose  options  for  rebalanced  power  tariffs  that  provide  for  revenue  sufficient  to  recover \nthe  NUC\u2019s  power  operations  costs  and  that  eliminate  embedded  cross-subsidies  between \nconsumer  classes  and  between  the  NUC\u2019s  distinct  areas  of  operations  (e.g.,  between  power \nand  water);  and  (iv)  propose  options  for  provision  of  a  subsidy  to  residential  customers  to \nprovide  for  basic  power  service  on  a  means-tested  or  proxy-means-tested  basis,  for  which \nmeans-testing approaches will be elaborated and assessed for practicality of implementation. \n \n25. \nThe findings  of the TA will  be  presented to the Government  of  Nauru, NUC,  and other \nstakeholders  in  a  report  and  presentation  containing  a  recommended  policy  framework  for \nadoption  by  the  government  and  a  practical  implementation  schedule.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented by ADB through consultants selected in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants. \n \n26. \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). \n\nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $225,000,  of  which  $225,000  will  be  financed  on  a  grant \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nThe  proposed  investments  in  diesel generation and powerhouse  roof repair  have been \n27. \nassessed  to  be  technically  viable  and  appropriate  to  the  NUC\u2019s  needs.  The  optimal  size  and \nperformance  characteristics  of  the  diesel  generator  have  been  determined.  The  necessary \nscope  of  work  for  repair  of  the  powerhouse  roof  has  been  elaborated.  A  2-year  post-\ncommissioning operation and maintenance and training contract will be concluded between the \nNUC and the diesel-generator supplier to provide capacity development of NUC staff to improve \nlong-term sustainability of the investment. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n28. \nEconomic.  The  project\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  48.30%,  with  a  project \neconomic  net  present  value  of  $10.50  million  using  a  discount  rate  of  12.00%  over  a  25-year \nproject life cycle.  Economic benefits accrue from a reduction in operational expenses (including \nreduced fuel consumption), increased revenue from serving un-served load (reduced incidence \nof  forced  outages),  and  reduced  reliance  on  more  expensive  self-generation  by  industrial  and \ncommercial  customers. Sensitivity  analyses  were performed  assuming  increases of  20.00%  in \ncapital  and  operational  expenses  and  decreases  of  10.00%  and  20.00%  in  tariff  and  fuel-\nefficiency  levels,  respectively.  Under  all  plausible  sensitivity  scenarios,  the  project\u2019s  economic \ninternal rate of return is robust, ranging from 18.80% to 44.70%. \n\n\f7 \n\n29. \nFinancial.  The  project  has  a  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  11.50%  and  a  financial \nnet present value of $3.69 million using a financial discount rate equal to the weighted average \ncost of capital of 7.32%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that an increase in capital and operational \nexpenditures  of  20.00%  decreases  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  to 9.80%.  The  project\u2019s \nfinancial  performance  is  most  sensitive  to  a  decrease  in  tariffs.    Though  highly  unlikely,  a \n10.00%  decrease  in  tariffs  would  produce  a  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  0.74%  and  a \nnegative financial net present value.   \n\nC. \n\nGovernance  \n\n30. \nSensitivity  to  tariff  levels  underscores  the  importance  of  tariff  rationalization,  which  the \ngovernment has begun to implement through a 70.00% tariff increase effective July 2014.  The \nattached  technical  assistance  will  address  further  tariff  and  subsidy  policy  reform  to  support \nfinancial sustainability of the NUC. \n\n31. \nFinancial  management.  To  facilitate  cash  flow  during  project  implementation,  the \nimplementing  agency  will  approve  and  submit  to  ADB  withdrawal  applications  from  the  PMU, \nassisted  by  the  DSC,  for  direct  payment  procedure  for  all  project  goods,  works,  and  services \nfunded  under  proceeds  of  the  grants.  A  financial  management  assessment  of  the  NUC  was \nundertaken. While the executing agency\u2019s financial management practices and procedures were \ndeemed  adequate  for  the  implementation  and  operational  phases  of  the  project,  those  of  the \nimplementing  agency  require  urgent  improvements  that  have  been  a  covenanted  condition  of \nthe grant. The NUC does not currently have all the necessary capability for energy accounting \nor financial  management. While the  PMU  will  be responsible for  project financial  management \nand accounting, the DSC will assist the executing and implementing agencies in accounting for \nall  project  transactions,  including  in-kind  and  other  contributions  from  the  government. \n(Simultaneously, ADB TA is being mobilized, managed separately from the proposed grant, to \nassist the NUC in development of its asset management practices and systems.) \n \n32. \nProcurement.  In  the  interest  of  time  and  efficiency,  procurement  activities  funded \nthrough  grants  proceeds  will  be  conducted  by  the  DSC.  The  PMU  will  participate  in  the \npreparation  of  the  bid  documents  and  evaluation  of  the  bids.  Signing  contracts  and  contract \nmanagement responsibilities will remain with the grant recipient. \n \n33. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 7). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe  present  erratic  power  supply  is  a  constraint  on  economic  and  socioeconomic \n34. \ndevelopment. The entire population of Nauru will benefit from the project through more reliable \nelectricity supplies, and Nauru\u2019s economy will benefit from more efficient power generation. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n35. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  project  works  will  have  impacts  that  are  site  specific; \nnone of the foreseen environmental impacts are irreversible or cannot be readily mitigated. An \ninitial  environmental  examination  has  been  undertaken.8 The  project  will  undertake  (i)  delivery \nand installation of a new diesel generator, (ii) decommissioning and disposal of generators to be \n\n                                                \n8  Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nretired,  and  (iii)  repair  and/or  demolition  of  existing  structures  at  the  NUC\u2019s  powerhouse  and \ndisposal of waste material. These activities are expected to create only a small range of impacts, \nwhich are largely contained within the site owned and managed by the NUC and which can be \nmitigated  through  the  measures  set  out  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  and \nenvironmental  management  plan.  The  NUC  have  assigned  staff  to  the  PMU,  which  will  be \nresponsible  for  overall  project  implementation,  including  the  environmental  management  plan. \nThe DSC will support the PMU as the owner\u2019s engineer, and will also assist in implementation of \nthe environmental management plan. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  is  not  expected  to  involve  any \n36. \nphysical displacement or relocation of people. All activities will be undertaken at the existing site \nof  NUC\u2019s  powerhouse,  and  will  not  require  additional  land  acquisition.  No  resettlement  plan  is \nrequired per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n37. \nIndigenous  peoples (category C).  The majority of the population in the project area  is \nnot considered to be distinct from the mainstream society. The project is not expected to affect \nany distinct and vulnerable group of indigenous peoples as defined by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement,  and  does  not  require  an  indigenous  peoples  plan.  The  project  outputs  will  be \ndelivered in a culturally appropriate manner. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n38.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.9 The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nMitigating Measures \nAll grant-funded procurements will be managed by design and \nsupervision consultants (DSC). \n\nRisks \nGovernment procurement agency \narrangement is inefficient and subject to \ninappropriate outside influence \nExecuting and implementing agencies\u2019 \naccounting for in-kind government \ncontributions is deficient, inaccurate \n\nDSC will support accounting for government in-kind contributions; \nimplementing agency has competent in-house financial management \nexperts who are developing finance department\u2019s capacity. However, \ngrant covenants are required to ensure that the implementing agency \nimplements adequate financial management policies and procedures \nas a matter of urgency, and undertakes commensurate capacity \ndevelopment of its staff. In addition, the DSC will be tasked to assist \nin the development of these financial management policies and \nprocedures, and also to provide related capacity development. \nGovernment of Nauru has acknowledged the urgency of revising tariff \nand subsidy policies.  The attached technical assistance will support \nrevision of these policies to ensure that the Nauru Utilities \nCorporation is able to meet its revenue requirement through tariffs \n(and explicit budget transfers, as appropriate.) \n\nTariff and subsidy policies do not align to \nallow the Nauru Utilities Corporation to \ngenerate sufficient revenues from its \ncustomer base to cover costs. If these \npolicies are not properly aligned, the financial \nperformance of the project could be at risk. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DSC = design and supervision consultant \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n9  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f9 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe  government  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain \n\n39. \nThe government and the Ministry of Finance have assured ADB that implementation of \nthe project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and grant documents. \n \n40. \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the grant agreements and project agreement. \n \n41. \nIn  addition,  the  government,  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  the  NUC  have  agreed  with \nADB  that  the  preparation  of  the  project  site  for  the  installation  of  the  new  generator  will  be  a \ncondition for awarding civil works contracts as set forth in the grant agreements. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n42. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  grant  not  exceeding  $2,000,000  to  Nauru,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources, for the Electricity Supply Security and Sustainability Project, on terms \nand  conditions  that  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the \ndraft grant and project agreements presented to the Board; and \nthe administration by ADB of the grant not exceeding \u20ac2,000,000 to Nauru for the \nElectricity  Supply  Security  and  Sustainability  Project,  to  be  provided  by  the \nEuropean Union. \n\n16 October 2014 \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n\f10 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \n \nIncreased  economic \nactivity \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \n \nNUC  billing  records  and \nperformance logs \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \nBy December 2019: \n \n10% increase in average \nmonthly consumption \n(June 2015 baseline: to be \nconfirmed during \nimplementation) \n \n20% increase in peak load  \n(2014 baseline: 3.75 MW) \n \n \n\nOutcome \n\nBy December 2016: \n\nIncreased reliability, \nlower cost, and \ngreater sustainability \nof power generation \nin Nauru \n\nNUC service logs \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.
