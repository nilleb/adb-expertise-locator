The structural reform priorities include efforts to enhance the business climate \nby  promoting  competition  policy,  regulatory  efficiency,  competitive  logistics,  and  private  sector \nparticipation  in  infrastructure  through  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  projects.  The  program \nalso supports the government\u2019s efforts to promote competitive labor markets through piloting a \njob placement program to assist young school leavers find decent jobs (MyFirstJob), piloting an \nindustry-led skills and services development program, and labor policy reforms. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe government has made decent employment creation one of its central tenets. \nThe Philippine Development Plan (PDP), 2011\u20132016 aims to create 1 million new jobs per year \nand  maintain  the  unemployment  rate  within  a  narrow  range  of  6.8%\u20137.2%.2\n Improvements  in \nthe business climate and infrastructure to attract investment and create jobs, and programs  to \nimprove the skills of young people and address the mismatch of skills in the labor market, form \ncentral themes of the economic program. \n \n4. \nLow  investment  rate. There was significant growth in private and public investment in \nthe  1990s.  The  investment  rate  started  to  decline  after  the  Asian  financial  crisis  of  1997  and \nbottomed out at 13.0% in 2005. It had recovered to 15.0% of gross domestic product by 2010 \n(1988 prices), but is still lower than in most other Southeast Asian economies. A consequence \nof  this  lower  investment  rate  has  been  lower  long-term  economic  growth  potential.  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) staff estimates suggest that the Philippines is under-investing by as \nmuch  as  5  percentage  points  of  gross  domestic  product  if  it  is  to  raise  its  potential  growth  to \n6.0% from the current level of 5.0%. \n \n5. \nWeak competitiveness. While there has been a marked improvement in the rankings of \nthe  Philippines  in  key  global  competitiveness  surveys,  indicating  improved  perceptions  about \nthe  investment  climate,  the  country  continues  to  rate  low  on  an  international  comparison  of \ncompetitiveness indicators.3\n Several ADB and other diagnostic studies found that high business \ncompliance  costs  in  the  regulatory  environment,  the  prevalence  of  anticompetitive  regulation \nand  practices  in  several  key  services  sectors,  and  high  costs  in  trade  logistics  affected  the \ncompetitiveness  of  the  Philippines  economy.  Inefficiencies  in  tax  policy  and  tax  administration \nhurt exporters of goods and services. The Philippines is under-investing in infrastructure due to \nlimited  national  budget  resources  and  a  weak  regulatory  framework  for  infrastructure  projects \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Unemployment rate is 7.2% in January 2012. \n3  The 2012 Global Competitiveness Index ranks the Philippines 75th out of 142 countries, up 10 places from 2011. \nThe 2012 Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom ranks the Philippines 107th out of 179 countries, up \neight  places  over  the  previous  year.  The  2012  World  Bank  Group  Doing  Business  Index  ranks  the  Philippines \n136th out of 183 countries, down two places from the 2011 report.  \n\n\f 2 \n\nunder the 1990 Build\u2013Operate\u2013Transfer (BOT) Law. Inadequate skills of workers in key sectors \nand structural rigidities in the labor market have also affected competitiveness of the economy.4\n \n \n6. \nLabor  market  and  employment  generation.  While  higher  and  sustainable  economic \ngrowth  is  necessary  to  create  more  jobs,  it  is  not  sufficient  as  there  are  structural  and  policy \nimpediments to employment generation. The 2012 ADB study on youth labor market experience \nfound  that  high  school  leavers  and  dropouts  have  a  difficult  time  integrating  into  the  labor \nmarket.  5\n It  can  take them  up to  4  years  to find a  wage  job  compared  with  2  years for  college \ngraduates,  and  only  50%  of  high  school  leavers  actually  find  wage  employment  indicating  a \nsizeable  proportion  of  young  persons  excluded  from  productive  employment.  Several  factors \ncontribute  to  this  slower  transition  to  the  workplace  for  high  school  leavers.  First,  economic \ngrowth averaging 5.0% per annum has been insufficient to create enough wage jobs for the 1 \nmillion new labor market entrants each year (economic growth above 6.0% is needed). Second, \nthe labor market has been undergoing a structural change with an increased demand for skilled \nworkers.  This  change  has  resulted  in  a  widening  skills  mismatch  in  the  labor  market  as  many \nhigh school leavers are ill-equipped for entry into the labor market. Third, public provisioning of \nemployment services to connect job seekers with jobs is in the early stages of development and \nnot well targeted. There is limited labor market information available to school leavers. Fourth, \nsome labor regulations have dampened employment growth.  \n \nthese \nPhilippine  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132016.  The  government  recognizes \n7. \nconstraints  on  the  investment  climate  and  on  employment  generation.  The  PDP,  2011\u20132016 \nhas  improving  the  competitiveness  of  industry  and  services  as  a  core  component,  and  its \nagenda  includes  creating  a  better  business  environment  and  promoting  PPP  projects  in \ninfrastructure. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132016 is consistent and aligned with the \nPDP. 6  It  has  set  expansion  in  investment  as  an  outcome  indicator.  ADB  has  extensive \nexperience  in  assisting  with  improving  the  investment  climate  in  the  Philippines,  including \nassistance  to  the  energy  sector,  capital  market  development,  road  infrastructure,  and  the \nbusiness  climate.7\n Lessons  learned  from  these  programs  include:  (i)  policy  reforms  are  more \nlikely  to  show  impact  if  they  are  performance-based  measures;  (ii)  interventions  are  also \nrequired  to  operationalize  policy  reforms  at  the  ground  level;  and  (iii)  programs  should  embed \nevaluation  and  monitoring  frameworks  to  assist  governments  with  evidenced-based  policy \ndevelopment.  \n \n8. \nIn response to private sector demands for structural reforms to specific sectors that hold \npromise  for  further  lifting  economic  growth,  the  government  has  also  prioritized  support  for \nseveral  sectors  in  the  PDP,  2011\u20132016. 8\n The  tourism  sector  has  been  identified  by  the \ngovernment  and  private  sector  for  longer-term  development  based  on  its  recent  growth \nperformance, job creation possibilities across the archipelago, and positive externalities to other \nsectors. The challenges facing the tourism sector are also reflective of the challenges facing the \n\n                                                \n4  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management - Investment Climate (accessible from the list of linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2).  \n\n5  Sector Assessment (Summary): Youth School-to-Work Transition (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\n6  ADB. 2011.

Arangkada  Philippines  2010.  Manila,  identifies  tourism,  business  processing \noutsourcing, creative industries, infrastructure, manufacturing and logistics, agribusiness, and mining as seven big \nsectors with promising growth prospects. International Monetary Fund. 2007. Philippines Selected Issues. Country \nReport  No.  07/131.  Washington,  DC,  also  noted  the  services  sector  holds  promise  for  lifting  growth  in  the \nPhilippines. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\neconomy  as  a  whole:  the  2011  World  Economic  Forum  Tourism  and  Travel  Competitiveness \nIndex ranks the Philippines 94th out of 139 countries. To address this, and with support under \nthe  program,  the  government  has  put  together  a  package  of  structural  reforms  to  promote  a \nconducive  business  environment  in  the  sector,  PPP  infrastructure  investments  to  improve \nconnectivity between different destinations, and interventions to improve service standards and \nindustry  skills.  It  is  in  this  context  that  the  government  and  the  private  sector  believe  that \nsuccessful  implementation  of  these  structural  reforms  in  the  tourism  sector  could  provide  a \npotential demonstration model for reforms in other sectors of the economy. The logistics sector \nhas  also  been  identified  by  government  and  the  private  sector  for  development  based  on  its \neconomy-wide  linkages.  The  logistics  sector  remains  high  cost  for  air,  sea,  and  road \ntransportation  affecting  competitiveness  of  industry  and  services  sector.  The  government \nintends  to  address  this  through  reforms  to  the  aviation  sector  (\u201copen  skies\u201d  policy  and  tax \nreform), improvements in port management and customs procedures.  \n \n9. \nThe  program  builds  on  and  complements  other  ADB  programs  promoting  governance \nreforms  in  the  Philippines,  such  as  the  Governance  and  Justice  Sector  Reform  Program, \ncompleted  in  December  2011. 9  Also,  ADB\u2019s  technical  assistance  (TA)  on  public  financial \nmanagement (PFM) is assisting implementing agencies under the program to enhance internal \ncontrol  and  audit  systems. 10    Previous  ADB  programs  supporting  technical  and  vocational \neducation  in  the  Philippines  have  laid  down  the  infrastructure  for  the  tourism  industry  skills \nintervention under the program (para. 11).11\n \n \n10. \nThe Programmatic  Approach. The program comprises of two subprograms enveloped \nby a medium-term results-based framework. The program has identified three outputs critical for \nraising  competitiveness  and  promoting  labor  market  inclusiveness:  (i)  structural  policy  reforms \nto  promote  competitiveness  through  a  better  competition  policy,  regulatory  efficiency,  and \ncompetitive  trade  logistics;  (ii)  creating  an  efficient  market  for  infrastructure  through  PPP \nprojects;  and  (iii)  promoting  competitive  labor  markets  to  address  structural  weaknesses  and \ngenerate employment. The program includes a set of high-impact structural policy reforms (such \nas competition policy, regulatory reform, tax, and trade logistics) designed to potentially benefit \nall  sectors.  It  also  adopts  a  package  of  deeper  structural  policy  reforms  and  assistance  to \nspecific  leading  sectors,  starting  with  the  tourism  sector  and  logistics  in  subprogram  1.  Other \nsectors on a case by case basis may be considered for structural reforms in subprogram 2.12\n \n \n11. \nThe  program  includes  three  innovative  interventions  that  apply  policy  and  make  it \noperational  on  the  ground  with  clearly  defined  and  measurable  performance  indicators. \nSubprogram 2 loan disbursement will be based on progress with these performance indicators. \nThe  proposed  youth  job  placement  program,  referred  to  as  MyFirstJob,  will  be  a  flagship \nprogram of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). Drawing on successful models in \nLatin  America,  Canada, and  Europe,  MyFirstJob  will  provide  job  placement  assistance to  high \nschool leavers to help them better integrate into the labor market. Services that will be provided \ninclude career counseling and grants for vocational training linked to internships with public and \nprivate sector employers. The MyFirstJob pilot will be implemented through public employment \nservice  offices  (PESOs)  in  three  localities  in  subprogram  2  and  aims  to  target  1,600  school \nleavers, of which 50% will be women. Another innovative intervention is the establishment of the \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2011.

The  skills  development  program  will  include  industry-led  upgrading  of \ncurriculums,  and  a  matching  grants  program  for  industry  to  fund  training  of  workers  in  the \ntourism  sector.  The  pilot  will  be  initiated  in  subprogram  2  and  will  target  approximately  5,000 \ntourism workers. The industry skills program will also be complemented by the new hotel quality \nassurance  and  accreditation  system  aimed  at  raising  services  standards  in  the  sector.  The \naccreditation  system  includes  new  hotel  standards  aligned  with  international  benchmarks.  A \nthird-party international assessor will be engaged to assist with the pilot to ensure credibility in \nthe  new  hotel  rating  system.  Both  the  skills  development  and  hotel  accreditation  interventions \nwill  be  piloted  in  a  few  selected  tourism  destinations  to  produce  successful  demonstration \nmodels  that  can  be  rolled  out  nationally.  The  final  intervention  is  the  establishment  of  the \nregulatory  impact  assessment  (RIA)  program  in  key  departments  to  improve  the  quality  of \nregulations. The RIA promotes transparent, evidence-based policy development in government. \nIt is intended that the programs will be rolled out nationally after completion of the pilots. ADB is \npreparing  separate  TA  to  support  the  DOLE  and  DOT  to  design,  implement,  and  fund  the \npilots.13\n  \n \n12. \nThird, the program will have built-in monitoring and evaluation frameworks to assist the \ngovernment with evidenced-based policy making aimed at building stronger political support for \neventual  national  rollout  of  the  pilot  programs.  The  evaluations  could  also  guide  government \nand  development  partners  in  adopting  these  models  for  other  sectors.  The  monitoring  and \nevaluation frameworks will be funded under the separate TA (footnote 13). Baseline data will be \ncollected  for  each  pilot  and  performance  of  participants  in  the  pilots  (treatment  groups)  and \ncomparable nonparticipants (control groups) will be tracked over a 2\u20133\u2013year period to enable a \nrigorous impact evaluation of the results of the pilots.  \n \n13. \nThe  program  has  been  jointly  formulated  by  the  Government  of  the  Philippines,  ADB, \nand  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  Government  of  Japan  (through  the  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency,  JICA)  is  cofinancing  components  1  and  2  of  the  policy-based  loan  for \nsubprograms  1  and  2.  The  JICA  will  cofinance  subprogram  1  in  the  amount  of  $100  million \nequivalent.  The  Government  of  the  Philippines  (through  the  Department  of  Finance)  has \ncoordinated \nthrough  established \nthe  reform  agenda  with  other  development  partners \ncoordination mechanisms such as the National Competitiveness Council.14\n \n \nB. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  program  is  an  improved  investment  climate.  The  benchmark  will  be \n14. \nimprovements in key global competitiveness indicators. The growth inclusiveness element of an \nimproved  investment  climate  is  measured  by  the  expansion  in  the  number  of  young  people \nemployed  in  full-time  wage  jobs.  Wage  employment  provides  higher  economic  returns  to \nschooling than informal employment, and evidence points to wage employment helping families \nescape from poverty (footnote 5). The outcome of the program will be improved competitiveness \nof selected sectors.  \n \nC. \n \n15. \nSubprogram  1  supports  the  government\u2019s  efforts  in  improving  competitiveness  and \ninclusiveness  in  three  outputs:  (i)  structural  policy  reforms  to  the  economy,  (ii)  creating  an \n                                                \n13 Two proposed TA projects are being processed to provide assistance to DOT and DOLE to pilot the programs in \nsubprogram  2.  The  Government  of  Canada  (through  the  Canadian  International  Development  Agency)  is \nconsidering financing the two proposed TA projects with a grant of $12,500,000. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n14 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\nefficient market for infrastructure projects through PPP projects, and (iii) promoting competitive \nlabor markets. All 25 policy measures required for subprogram 1 have been fully accomplished. \n \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Structural Policy Reforms to Promote Competitiveness \n\nSubprogram 1 supports the government in initiating a competition policy and measures \n\n \n16. \nto promote competitive trade logistics. \n \n17. \nCompetition  policy  and  regulatory  efficiency. The government has initiated steps to \ndevelop a robust competition policy framework. Its approach adopts three pillars: (i) develop a \ncompetition  policy  law,  (ii)  institutionalize  RIAs  in  government,  and  (iii)  undertake  sector-by-\nsector  competition  and  regulatory  reforms.  It  is  recognized  that  this  is  a  long-term  agenda. \nUnder subprogram 1, the following measures were accomplished to start the development of a \ncompetition policy. First, in June 2011, a presidential executive order was issued mandating the \nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) to lead the implementation of a competition law as a precursor to \nCongress  passing  a  competition  law.  A  departmental  order  was  issued  establishing  the  Office \nfor  Competition  at  the  DOJ,  and the  office  was  provided  with  a  startup budget  in  2012.  Under \nsubprogram  2,  capacity  development  activities  at  the  office  will  be  carried  out  and  the  office \nmade  operational.  Second,  the  government  started  implementing  RIA  through  accomplishing \nthe  following  critical  institutional  steps:  (i)  a  memorandum  of  agreement  between  DOT  and \nDOLE  to  pilot  RIAs  in  the  departments;  (ii)  DOT  and  DOLE  designated  focal  persons \nresponsible  for  overseeing  RIA  implementation  in  the  respective  agencies;  and  (iii)  2012  work \nplans  drafted  by  DOLE  and  DOT  identifying  regulations  to  be  subject  to  RIA.  The  DOLE  will \nsubject the review  of the  Labor  Code to the  RIA  process  and DOT  will  use  RIA to  assess  the \nimpact on the business community of proposed implementing regulations and standards under \nthe 2009 Law on Tourism. Under subprogram 2, RIA will be extended to 2\u20133 other agencies and \na legal framework for establishing an office of better regulatory practice will be drafted. Ongoing \nADB TA is providing capacity building support for the RIA program.15\n \n \nPromoting  competitive  trade  logistics.  A  major  reform  to  the  logistics  market  is  the \n18. \ngovernment\u2019s  \u201copen  skies\u201d  reforms.  Presidential  Executive  Order  29  was  issued  in  2011 \nproviding  for  open  skies  in  the  domestic  aviation  sector,  whereby  the  Philippine  Air  Panels \n(which  negotiates  agreements  on  landing  rights)  may  offer  and  promote  freedom  rights  to  the \ncountry\u2019s airports other than Ninoy Aquino International Airport without restriction on frequency, \ncapacity,  and  type  of  aircraft.  Tax  distortions  have  also  prevented  a  conducive  business \nenvironment  between  domestic  and  foreign  carriers  in  the  domestic  aviation  and  shipping \nmarkets. In subprogram 2, with ADB TA, the government will draft amendments to the tax code \nabolishing  the  common  carrier  tax  applied  to  gross  cargo  and  passenger  revenue  of  foreign-\nowned  carriers.  Both  these  reforms  will  align  the  Philippines  aviation  sector  with  neighboring \neconomies and will boost the competitiveness of the logistics sector benefiting a wide range of \nindustries including tourism. \n \n19. \nAnother  major  reform  benefiting  exporters  of  goods  and  services  is  the  reform  to  VAT \nrefunds  for  enterprises.  Until  2011,  enterprises  received  tax  credit  certificates  (TCCs)  for  VAT \nrefunds,  instead  of  cash  refunds  commonly  used  elsewhere  in  the  region.  The  TCC  approach \ntied  up  the  working  capital  of  firms  and,  therefore,  significantly  raised  their  cost  of  working \ncapital. With analytical support funded by JICA, the government has abolished the TCC system \nand  will  make  cash  refunds,  starting  with  new  VAT  refunds  in  2012.  The  2012  General \nAppropriations  Act  (national  budget)  allocated  P9.3  billion  for  VAT  cash  refunds  in  2012. \nEncashment  of  the  stock  of  TCCs  will  occur  during  subprogram  2.  As  a  result  of  this  reform, \n\n                                                \n15 ADB. 2011. Philippines: Strengthening Institutions for an Improved Investment Climate. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\nADB  staff estimate that exporters  could  save  up  to  $150 million  on  the  cost  of  working  capital \nover  the  program  medium-term  period  of  2011\u20132016.  Other  accomplishments  aimed  at \nimproving trade logistics include (i) the Bureau of Customs including in its 5-year strategic plan \nmeasures  for  improving  customs  clearance  and  for  aligning  customs  procedures  with \ninternational  standards  under  the  ratified  Revised  Kyoto  Convention  on  the  simplification  and \nharmonization  of  customs  procedures;  and  (ii)  the  government,  through  the  Department  of \nTransportation  and  Communications  and  port  authorities,  agreeing  to  improve  container  traffic \nand  revenue  performance  at  the  Manila,  Subic,  and  Batangas  ports  in  an  effort  to  ease \ncontainer  congestion  at  the  Manila  port.  The  government  is  drafting  a  ports  utilization  plan \ncontaining  concrete  measures  to  decongest  the  Manila  port.  These  measures  will  be \nimplemented in subprogram 2. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput  2:  Creating  an  Efficient  Market  for  Infrastructure  Projects  through \nPublic\u2013Private Partnerships \n\nSubprogram 1 supports the government in creating a world class PPP for infrastructure \n\n \n20. \nas one financing modality for addressing the underinvestment in infrastructure.16\n  \n \n21. \nStrengthening  the  public\u2013private  partnership  policy,  regulatory,  and  institutional \nframework.  In  2010, the government  announced  the  promotion  of  PPPs  in  infrastructure  as  a \ncentral  priority  of  its  economic  agenda.  As  a  first  step,  in  September  2010,  the  government \nrestructured the  build\u2013own\u2013transfer  center  into the  Public\u2013Private  Partnership  Center  (PPPC), \nan agency attached to the NEDA. Building on this reform in subprogram 1 and with ADB\u2019s TA \non PPP in infrastructure, the government implemented a series of measures to strengthen the \nPPP governance framework and build capacity of the PPPC with the aim of improving service \ndelivery. 17 These accomplishments included (i) The NEDA drafted amendments to Presidential \nExecutive Order 8 (2010) to streamline functions of the PPPC and strengthen the operations of \nthe  Project  Development  and  Monitoring  Facility,  which  helps  prepare  PPP  projects.  The \npresidential  executive  order  will  be  issued  during  subprogram  2.    (ii)  The  government  drafted \nand  circulated  amendments  to  the  implementing  rules  and  regulations  of  the  BOT  Law  to \naddress regulatory impediments to PPPs in infrastructure, and drafted amendments to the joint-\nventure guidelines to ensure consistency with the PPP regulatory framework. These legislative \nand regulatory measures will be completed in subprogram 2.  (iii) To advance the preparation of \nPPP  projects  prepared  by  the  PPPC,  the  PPPC  established  a  panel  of  firms  for  fast-track \nselection  of  PPP  project  development  consultants.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  Project \nDevelopment  and  Monitoring  Facility  will  provide  support  for  carrying  out  six  feasibility  studies \nfor  PPP  projects.  Recently,  much  progress  has  been  made  in  bringing  PPP  projects  to  the \ncompetitive bidding stage. Through the PDMF, nine projects are being prepared for competitive \nbidding  in  2012,  of  which  three  PPP  projects  are  new  international  and  domestic  airports  in \nsupport of tourism infrastructure.18\n  \n \n22. \nThe  government  introduced  measures  to  provide  for  sustainable  financing  of \npublic\u2013private  partnership  projects.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government  carried  out  the \nfollowing  measures  to  provide  budgetary  support  to  the  PPPC  and  develop  instruments  for \nsustainable  financing  of  PPPs:  (i)  The  2012  national  budget  allocated  total  funding  of  P19.6 \nbillion  to  the  Strategic  Support  Fund  (SSF)  and  P161.0  million  to  the  PDMF  to  finance \npreparation  of  PPP  projects  and  public  capital  expenditure.  The  NEDA  board\u2019s  Investment \nCoordination Committee\u2019s guidelines for the use of the SSF were issued.  (ii) The Department of \n                                                \n16 Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Public\u2013Private  Partnerships  in  Infrastructure  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n17 ADB. 2011.

Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  will \nformulate a policy on financing and contingent liabilities. \n \n\nthrough \n\nthese  efforts \n\nfurther  capacity  building  measures  at \n\nOutput 3: Promoting Competitive Labor Markets  \n\n3. \n23. \nSubprogram  1  supports  the  government  in  implementing  measures  and  programs  to \nimprove youth job placements, improve skills development in the workplace, and address other \nstructural rigidities in the labor market with the aim of stimulating job growth. \n \n24.  MyFirstJob  pilot. The government  is  addressing the  slow  school-to-work  transition for \nyoung persons with its proposed MyFirstJob pilot. To initiate the pilot, the government undertook \nseveral institutional and capacity development measures: (i) DOLE has been advocating among \nlocal government units to institutionalize PESOs as permanent, staffed, and funded agencies of \nlocal  government  units.  As  of  December  2011,  89  PESOs  had  been  institutionalized,  placing \napproximately  95,000  people  into  jobs.  With  the  assistance  of  the  International  Labor \nOrganization,  DOLE  has  provided  capacity  building  support  to  the  PESOs  in  employment \nfacilitation,  including  staff  training  in  coaching  and  counseling.    (ii)  DOLE  drafted  labor  market \ninformation  materials  for  dissemination  among  the  public  and  high  schools  with  the  aim  of \nimproving  awareness  among  young  people  about  career  opportunities.  Subprogram  2  will \nthe  PESOs  and \nextend \nimplementation  of  the  MyFirstJob  pilot.  Under  ADB  TA,  work  on  the  design  of  the  MyFirstJob \npilot is ongoing (footnote 15). \n \nPrivate\u2013public  partnership  in  tourism  industry  skills  and  service  development. \n25. \nEmployers  in  several  sectors  complain  about  the  skills  mismatch  of  many  school  leavers  and \nthe  emerging  shortages  of  skilled  workers.  The  government  recognizes  these  constraints  on \ncompetitiveness  and  employment  and  is  trying  to  address  them  through  both  crosscutting \ninterventions and sector-specific programs. Under subprogram 1, the following measures have \nbeen instituted to set out the foundations for skills development, starting with the tourism sector: \nThe  DOT  endorsed  the  National  Tourism  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132016.  Key  features  of  the \nplan  relevant  to  the  program  include  (i)  recommended  adoption  of  a  PPP  framework  for \naccreditation  and  certification  of  tourism  service  providers,  and  (ii)  a  PPP  in  tourism  industry \nskills development. Ongoing ADB TA is supporting the DOT to design and develop the PPP in \nindustry  skills  development  and  a  matching  grants  fund.  The  skills  development  program  and \nfund will be made operational in subprogram 2; to improve service standards, the government \n(through  the  DOT)  drafted  new  standards  for  hotels  and  resorts  consistent  with  international \nstandards. Piloting of the new standards will be carried out in subprogram 2.  \n \n26. \nEmployment  policies  and  programs.  The  government,  in  collaboration  with  other \nstakeholders, initiated actions to improve labor and employment policies and programs with the \naim  of  generating  employment  and \nto  decent  employment.  These \naccomplishments included the following: (i) DOLE initiated a comprehensive review of the labor \ncode  with  the  aim  of  improving  quality  employment  facilitation  and  addressing  structural \nimpediments  in  the  labor  market.  The  review  will  be  carried  out  by  DOLE  staff  under  the  RIA \ninitiative  with  TA  from  ADB  (footnote  15).  A  tripartite  committee  comprising  government, \nemployers,  and  union  groups  will  oversee  the  review.  Key  recommendations  for  reforming \naspects of the Labor Code are expected in late-2012.  (ii) DOLE completed a series of studies \nto  identify  policies  to  mitigate  labor  market  risks,  such  as  unemployment  insurance  and  risks \nfrom  climate  change  and  natural  disasters.    (iii)  In  2010,  the  government  established  the \n\nimproving  access \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nCommunity-Based  Employment  Program,  which  is  the  umbrella  for  the  different  public \nemployment programs in several departments.  This program will be evaluated in subprogram 2. \n \n27. \nTriggers  for  subprogram  2  and  medium-term  results  framework. The program has \nspecified  (i)  15  policy  triggers  that  need  to  be  satisfactorily  accomplished  by  early  2014,  and  \n(ii)  a  set  of  medium-term  expected  results.  The  triggers  advance  accomplishments  under \nsubprogram  1  with  the  primary  focus  on  employment  facilitation  systems,  skills  development, \npromoting  competition  policy,  tax  reform,  lowering  costs  of  trade  logistics,  and  advancing  the \npreparation of PPP projects (Appendix 4). \n \nD. \n \nTo support its reform initiatives, the government has requested a single tranche loan of \n28. \n$350,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  subprogram  1  of  the \nprogram.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  annual \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these \nterms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own  independent \ndecision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.  The  loan \nproceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  exchange  cost  (excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of \nitems produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans,19\n the \nproceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  as  the \nborrower. \n \nThe  subprogram  1  loan  proceeds  will  support  key  development  spending  in  the  2012 \n29. \nbudget, including (i) budget allocation of P9.3 billion to fund the VAT cash refund policy trigger \nunder subprogram 1; (ii) budget allocation of P22.1 billion to fund the SSF and P161.0 million to \nthe  PDMF  to finance  the  public  sector  share  of  capital  spending  and  project  preparation  costs \nfor PPP projects; and (iii) other spending items in the 2012 budget such as for the start up of the \nOffice  of  Competition  at  the  DOJ,  capacity  development  of  the  PESOs,  and  the  review  of  the \nLabor Code, among other things. The indicative loan amount for subprogram 2 is $350,000,000 \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. It will support key development spending in the 2013 and \n2014 budgets (policy triggers) including VAT cash refunds, SSF, PDMF, competition office, and \nindustry  skills  development  fund.  The  loan  will  also  offset  the  reduction  in  tax  revenues  of \napproximately $80 million per annum resulting from the abolition of the 3.0% common carrier tax \non foreign carriers. \n \nE. \n \n30. \nSubprogram 1 period is from August 2010 to October 2012 and the subprogram 2 period \nis from April 2012 to October 2014. The DOF will be the executing agency for the program and \nwill be responsible for the overall implementation of subprogram 1 and the medium-term results \nframework. The program implementing agencies \u2014 DOJ, DOLE, DOT, the Department of Trade \nand  Industry,  the  Department  of  Transportation  and  Communications,  NEDA,  the  Bureau  of \nCustoms,  and  the  Bureau  of  Internal  Revenue  \u2014  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nimplementation  of  subprogram  1.  The  DOF  will  coordinate  with  implementing  agencies  and \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n                                                \n19 ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\nmeet  with  them  as  required  to  monitor  progress  on  subprogram  1  reforms.  The  National \nCompetitiveness Council will consult with representatives of the key chambers of commerce \u2014\nsuch as the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industries and the Joint Foreign Chambers \nof  Commerce  \u2014  to  provide  feedback  to  the  DOF  and  implementing  agencies  on  program \nimplementation, impact, and other issues affecting competitiveness. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nGovernance \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n31. \nThe size of the program loan is based on (i) the relative importance of the sector to the \neconomy and the weight of the benefits of the reform program, (ii) the policy adjustment costs \nincurred by the government and stakeholders in implementing and complying with reforms, and \n(iii) the need to conform to the overall financing requirement of the country partnership strategy \nperiod.  ADB  staff  simulations  indicate  that  the  benefits  of  the  reforms  over  the  program\u2019s \nmedium-term period\u2014from 2011 to 2016\u2014could be at least $1.87 billion (in 2010 prices). These \neconomic benefits arise from a reduction in business costs of compliance with licensing, lower \ncosts  of  trade  logistics,  an  improved  competition  policy,  and  increased  investment  in \ninfrastructure.  The  policy  adjustment  costs  to  the  government  and  the  private  sector  are \nconservatively  estimated  at  $966  million  discounted  over  the  program\u2019s  medium-term  period. \nThese  adjustment  costs  include  the  administrative,  enforcement,  and  fiscal  costs  to  the \ngovernment  in  implementing  the  reforms  and  direct  budgetary  funding  of  the  SSF  and  PDMF. \nThere  are  also  substantial  revenue  transfers  from  the  public  sector  to  the  private  sector  that \ncould amount to $1.47 billion discounted over the program\u2019s medium-term period. These arise \nfrom reforms to the VAT refund system and the abolition of the common carrier tax. 20\n \n \nB. \n \n32. \nImproved  governance  and  anticorruption  efforts  are  core  priorities  of  the  new \ngovernment. The government\u2019s  PFM  plan  was  announced  in  February  2011,  and  it  includes a \nseries  of  short-  to  medium-term  reforms  building  on  previous  accomplishments  made  since \n2006. The plan is supported by development partners. ADB has supported PFM reforms since \n2006,  starting  with  the  Development  Policy  Support  Program  loan  completed  in  2009,  and \nassociated  PFM  TA  focusing  on  public  debt  management  (footnote  9).  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nC. \n \n33. \nSubprogram 1 is categorized as some gender benefits and subprogram 2 is proposed as \neffective  gender  mainstreaming.  Unemployment  rates  are  higher  among  young  women  than \nyoung men. The program aims to address this gender employment gap through a set of policy \nmeasures  and  interventions.  Key  interventions  include  setting  quotas  of  50.0%  or  more  for \nyoung  women  participating  in  the  MyFirstJob  pilot  and  55.0%  or  more  for  young  women \naccessing skills training under the Tourism Skills Development Program. Both DOLE and DOT \nwill also develop gender-responsive manuals for these two pilot programs. In PPP infrastructure \nprojects, gender-sensitive checklists will be produced and completed at the design stage. \n \nD. \n \nThe  program  does  not  trigger  the  safeguard  policies  and  is  categorized  C  for  the \n34. \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The following are agreed upon, \n                                                \n20 Summary Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of documents in Appendix 2). \n\nPoverty and Social  \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nand  will  be  incorporated  into  the  legal  agreement.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nprogram. The government agreed to cooperate, and shall cause any and all government offices, \norganizations,  and  entities  involved  in  implementing  the  program  to  cooperate  fully  with  any \nsuch  investigation  and  to  extend  all  necessary  assistance,  including  providing  access  to  all \nrelevant books and records, as may be necessary, for the satisfactory completion of any such \ninvestigation. \n \nE. \n \n35. \nThere are four main risks to the program that are rated low to medium and are expected \nto  be  outweighed  by  the  benefits  of  the  program.  These  risks  are  that  (i)  there  will  be  weak \ninteragency coordination; (ii) the capacity of agencies to implement reforms may be constrained \nby resources; (iii) the reform agenda remains sensitive to political interests; and (iv) increased \nrisks to global financial markets slows economic growth and limits budget resources to fund the \nprogram  commitments.  Measures  to  mitigate  these  risks  are  put  in  place  and  include  public-\nprivate coordination and monitoring of reforms. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n\n \n36. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 1 shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan agreement. The loan \nwill not be declared effective until the government, through the DOF, has fulfilled all conditions \nas set out in the Policy Reform Matrix (Appendix 4). \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  loan  would \n37. \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  programmatic  approach  for  the  Increasing  Competitiveness  for  Inclusive \nGrowth Program; and \nthe loan of $350,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 1 of \nthe  Increasing  Competitiveness  for  Inclusive  Growth  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of 15 \nyears, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n1 June 2012 \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n\n \nDesign Summary \nImpact \nImproved investment \nclimate \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\nAssumption \nMacroeconomic \nstability \nmaintained \n \nRisk \nLack of effective \ncoordination \namong national \ngovernment \ndepartments \n\nNational Statistics Office \nhousehold labor force \nsurvey \n \nWorld Economic Forum \nGlobal Competitiveness \nReport  \n \nHeritage Foundation \nEconomic Freedom Index  \n \nWork Bank Group Doing \nBusiness  \n\n \nDepartment of Labor and \nEmployment annual PESO \ndata \n \n \n \n \nADB red tape survey 2012 \nand 2014 \n \n \n \nOfficial Gazette of the \nRepublic of the Philippines \n \n \n \nWorld Economic Forum \nGlobal Competitiveness \nReport on Tourism and \nTravel \n\n \nDOJ Office of Competition \nannual report \n \n \n \nDepartment administrative \norders from Department of \nLabor and Employment, \nDOT, NEDA, and two \nothers \n \n\nAssumption \nGovernment stays \non course with key \nbusiness \nregulatory reform \n \nRisk \nLack of \ncommitment and \nwillingness of \ngovernment \nagencies and \nstakeholders to \nparticipate in \nimplementing \nreforms \n\nRisks \nWeak interagency \ncoordination \n \nCapacity of \nagencies to \nimplement reforms \nmay be \nconstrained by \nresources and \nother emerging \npriorities \n\nBy mid-2018:  \n(i) Philippines ranking in \nglobal surveys of \ncompetitiveness improved by \nat least 15 places: \n(2010 baseline: ranked 87th in \nthe World Economic Forum \nGlobal Competitiveness \nReport; 109th in the Heritage \nFoundation Economic \nFreedom Index; 134th in the \nWorld Bank Group Doing \nBusiness Survey); and \n \n(ii) youth full-time wage \nemployment increased by an \naverage of 5.0% per annum \n(2010 baseline: average 3.4% \ngrowth in 1991\u20132010) \nBy December 2015: \n(i) number of persons found \njobs through institutionalized \nPESOs increased by 10% per \nannum (2010 baseline: \naverage 1,000 persons per \nPESO), \n \n(ii) cost of rules and \nregulations for key licenses \nreduced by 15% (baseline \n2012), \n \n(iii) Philippines ranking in \nglobal logistics index \nimproved by at least 10 \nplaces (2010 baseline), and \n \n(iv) Philippines ranking in \nglobal tourism and travel \ncompetitiveness index \nimproved by at least 15 \nplaces (2010 baseline) \nBy end of 2014: \n(i) at least three complaints of \nanticompetitive practices \ninvestigated (2011 baseline: \nno data), \n \n(ii) RIA piloted at five national \ndepartments or agencies with \nat least half pilots with women \nfocal persons (2011 baseline: \nno data), \n \n\nOutcome \nImproved \ncompetitiveness of \nselected sectors \n\nOutputs \n1.
