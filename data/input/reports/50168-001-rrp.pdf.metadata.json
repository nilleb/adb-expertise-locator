The government\u2019s priority areas to reduce income inequality include \n(i) aligning medium-term expenditure and programs with its national medium-term development \nplan (RPJMN) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets,2 (ii) enhancing the national \npublic  expenditure  systems  to  improve  quality  of  spending,  and  (iii)  improving  fiscal  transfers \nand subnational governments\u2019 spending to promote better public service delivery.   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  development  problem.  Indonesia  is  facing  the  twin  problems  of  prolonged \neconomic  slowdown  and  rising  household  income  inequality.  Economic  growth  has  steadily \ndeclined from 6.4% in 2010 to 4.8% in 2015, and is expected to remain only slightly above 5.0% \nin 2016 and 2017.3 Growth slowed initially because of falling commodity prices, which then fed \nback  into  lower  growth  in  the  non-resource  sector,  while  new  sources  of  growth  have  yet  to \nemerge. The economic slowdown, combined with persistent volatility in the global financial and \ncommodity markets, also translated into lower fiscal revenue collection, which in turn challenges \nthe  government\u2019s  efforts  to  stimulate  the  economy.  Revenue  collection  fell  by  9.8%  from \nJanuary to April 2016, compared with the same period in 2015, and the government expects a \nshortfall  of  $16.7  billion  in  2016.  Given  the  constitutional  limit  on  the  budget  deficit  at  3.0%  of \ngross domestic product (GDP), falling budget revenues impose constraints on the government\u2019s \nspending  in  the  social  sector  and  for  infrastructure,  even  though  these  are  necessary  to \novercome  the  income  inequality  problem.  ADB  analysis  shows  that  expenditure  on  education \nand  health  is  most  sensitive  to  declines  in  revenue  and  to  overall  deficit  levels,  despite  the \ngovernment being legally required to allocate 20% of the budget to education and 5% to health.4 \n \n4. \nAgainst  this  backdrop  of  slower  economic  growth  and  increased  fiscal  pressures,  the \ngovernment  is  finding  it  difficult  to  reverse  the  trend  of  rising  income  inequality.  Since  2000, \nIndonesia  has  experienced  one  of  the  largest  increases  in  household  income  inequality  in \nSoutheast Asia. The Gini coefficient, which measures a country\u2019s household income inequality, \nincreased from 0.30 in 2000 to 0.40 in 2015. Income inequality is closely connected to poverty, \nespecially in rural areas, where it stands at 14.1% of the population (urban poverty: 7.8% of the \npopulation). Moreover, while 10.9% of the population lives below the poverty line, about 40% of \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  full  list  of  SDGs  is  available  at  http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-developmentgoals \n(accessed  on  21  April  2016).  Please  refer  to  Measures  to  Implement  SDGs  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n3  The government, the World Bank and ADB\u2019s updated Asian Development Outlook projects growth of 5.1%, and the \n\nInternational Monetary Fund projects growth of 4.9% for 2016. \n\n4  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Public  Expenditure  and  Fiscal  Management  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n\fall  people  remain  clustered  around  the  national  poverty  line. 5  This  situation  is  caused  by \nunequal access to education, public services, and jobs; and by the fact that commodity-driven \neconomic growth creates few jobs and concentrates wealth.6 Uneven infrastructure investment \nand economic growth across provinces has widened regional income disparities and inequality; \nsome provinces in Eastern Indonesia significantly lag Java and Bali in per capita income.   \n\nFigure 1: Market and Net Inequality in Selected Association of Southeast Asian Nations Countries, 2000-2013 \n\nNote: The full length of the bars and the shorter bars represent market and net inequality respectively. The gap between market \nand net inequality (shaded areas) highlights the impact of social protection programs and government\u2019s redistribution policies.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates based on the Standardized World Income Inequality Database, 2014.  \n\n \n\n5. \nIndonesia\u2019s  social  protection  programs  have  not  adequately  tackled  the  income \ninequality  problem,  as  reflected  in  Figure  1,7 which  reports  two  indexes  taken  from  the  recent \nInternational Monetary Fund study and the standardized world income inequality database.8 The \nfirst index\u2014the Market Gini Index\u2014 measures income inequality without subsidies and income \ntransfers  to  the  population.  This  shows  the  counterfactual  condition  of  what  income  inequality \nwould  be  without  the  government\u2019s  income  redistribution  policies.  The  second  index\u2014the  Net \nGini Index\u2014measures income inequality with government subsidies and income transfers to the \npopulation  and  is  the  most  commonly  reported  Gini  index.  The  difference  between  the  two \nindexes (represented by the shaded areas in Figure 1) shows the estimated reduction in income \ninequality as a result of the government\u2019s income redistribution policies. Figure 1 provides two \nconclusions.  First,  Indonesia\u2019s  Gini  index  has  increased  significantly,  while  Malaysia,  the \nPhilippines, and Thailand have all experienced declines in their Gini indexes between 2000 and \n2013. Second, Indonesia has been less successful in reducing income inequality through social \npolicies and programs than the other three countries. In 2013, Indonesia\u2019s income redistribution \npolicies reduced the Gini index from 44.8 to 42.0, or by 2.8 points, compared with much larger \nreductions in the Philippines (4.5 points), in Malaysia (4.0 points), and in Thailand (3.5 points).9  \n \nInsufficient  public  spending  on  social  programs  and  infrastructure,  weaknesses  in \n6. \nnational  and  subnational  public  expenditure  management  (PEM),  overreliance  on  universal \nprice  subsidies  (such  as  on  energy),  and  poor  targeting  of  income  transfers  to  the  population \nexplain  the  smaller  reduction  impact  on  income  inequality  in  Indonesia.  For  example,  public \n                                                \n5  Statistics \n\nIndonesia\u2019s  National  Statistics  Office  and \n\nIndonesia  Overview \n\nthe  World  Bank \n\nfrom \n\nhttp://www.worldbank.org/en/country/indonesia/ (accessed 7 April 2016).  \n\n6  ADB.  2016.

Manila. \n\n7  Social Protection Programs Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  International Monetary Fund. 2014. Redistribution, Inequality, and Growth. Washington, DC and the Standardized \n\nWorld Income Inequality Database available at http://fsolt.org/swiid/ (accessed on 7 April 2016). \n\n9  There is a small discrepancy between data obtained from the database and government\u2019s official statistics.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fspending on health is about 3% of GDP\u2014one-third of the average in Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development economies\u2014and Indonesia ranks 147th out of 195 countries in \nhealth spending  per  capita. The  low  public  spending  is  manifested  in the  poor  performance  of \nkey  health  indicators.  For  example,  maternal  mortality  ratios  stand  at  359  for  every  100,000 \nbirths,  and  infant  mortality  rates  are  at  22.8  for  every  1,000  births  in  2015.  Although  these \nindicators have improved, they are still relatively high for a middle-income country. Similarly, in \n2013,  Indonesia\u2019s  spending  on  education  was  17.6%  of  total  government  expenditure, \ncompared  with  21.5%  in  Malaysia,  20.0%  in  Singapore,  and  21.4%  in  Thailand.  While  the  net \nenrollment  rate  in  basic  education  stands  at  95.5%  in  2013,  the  rate  for  senior  secondary \neducation falls steeply to only 57.7%. Public spending on infrastructure averaged 1.5% of GDP \nbetween 2008 and 2012, and Indonesia ranks 62nd out of 140 countries in the quality of overall \ninfrastructure, well below Malaysia (24th) and Thailand (44th). The SDGs stress the importance \nof targets related to health, education, social protection, and infrastructure quality to overcome \nincome  inequality,  so  the  government  will  have  to  boost  volume  and  efficiency  of  spending  to \nmeet  these  targets.  There  is  an  extensive  volume  of  international  empirical  studies  that  show \nthat  an  efficient  and  effective  PEM  systems  (good  governance)  at  both  the  national  and \nsubnational government level enables a reduction in household income inequality through better \ndesign and targeting of pro-poor spending initiatives over the medium term (footnote 8).  \n \n7. \nBinding  constraints.    The  government  has  recognized  the  challenges  it  needs  to \naddress  to  improve  social  sectors  and  infrastructure  spending:  (i) poor  alignment  of  medium-\nterm  expenditures  and  programs  with  its  RPJMN  and  SDGs  targets,  (ii) weaknesses  in  the \nnational PEM system that affect the quality of pro-poor spending, and (iii) poor quality of public \nservice delivery by subnational governments. These constraints are discussed in paras. 8\u201310. \n \n8. \nMisalignment  of  medium-term  expenditures  and  programs.  Lessons  learned  from \nIndonesia\u2019s experience in implementing the Millennium Development Goals shows that meeting \ntargets  requires  sequential  steps  such  as  mapping  SDGs  against  the  RPJMN  targets  and \ndevising an effective monitoring mechanism with regular reporting on implementation progress. \nTo  achieve  the  SDGs,  the  government  will  need  to  embed  these  targets  into  the  budget \nplanning  process  and  medium-term  expenditure  of  relevant  line  ministries,  address  funding \ndeficiencies in key social and infrastructure areas, and undertake incremental but vital reforms \nto  social  protection  so  they  are  fiscally  sustainable  while  expanding  program  coverage  to  the \npoor. By 2016, 167 million citizens (65% of the population) were covered by the national health \ninsurance  (JKN),  although  some  of  the  poorest  40%  can\u2019t  afford  the  coverage.  The  monthly \npremium contributions of the non-poor beneficiaries are also very low at Rp19,225 per person \n(about  $1.50),  resulting  in  higher  public  subsidy    to  fully  fund  the  program  (the  subsidy \namounted to Rp20.3 trillion in 2015). Premium rates require upward adjustment to ensure JKN\u2019s \nfiscal sustainability. Another major anti-poverty program that needs reform is the subsidized rice \nprogram (RASKIN). The program benefits many poor families but is costly to run, and program \ntargeting could be improved. In 2015, the government allocated Rp18.9 trillion for the program, \nand 42.6% of households received support, greater than the intended target.  It is estimated that \neligible households receive only one-third of the subsidy (footnote 7). The RASKIN assistance \nprogram needs to be better targeted to the poor and this will require the use of information and \ncommunications technology to register beneficiaries and record benefit entitlements. \n \n9. \nWeaknesses  in  national  public  expenditure  management.  Although  MOF  has \nintroduced  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework  in  2011,  weaknesses  remain  in  budget \nplanning,  execution,  monitoring,  and  reporting  that  impede  quality  pro-poor  spending.  For \nexample, inconsistent information on government assets makes it difficult to manage assets and \nallocate  budget  for  maintenance  expenditure,  which  undermines  the  quality  of  public \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\finfrastructure  investment.  Another  recurring  constraint  that  has  impeded  pro-poor  spending  is \nthe low and delayed disbursement rates for capital spending, i.e., 50%\u201360% of disbursements \nare  made  in  the  last  quarter  of  each  fiscal  year.10 These  constraints  are  largely  attributed  to \ncumbersome and complicated reallocation procedures between spending units and expenditure \nprograms, and severe delays in procurement because of insufficient capacity in spending units. \nAnother  constraint  in  PEM  is  the  incomplete  implementation  of  performance-based  budgeting, \nwhich  is  important  for  embedding  RPJMN  targets  in  the  budget  process  and  monitoring \nprogress toward achieving them. Also, a budget reporting system is needed to support a robust \nmonitoring and evaluation process that gives more immediate information on spending impacts. \nFinally,  macroeconomic  risk  analyses  of  the  budget  must  be  made  transparent  to  ensure  the \noverall  fiscal  sustainability  of  spending  goals.  The  2012  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial \nAccountability  Report  (PEFA)  noted  that  weaknesses  in  budget  execution,  such  as  high \nvariation  between budget  plans  and outturns,  affect  the government\u2019s  budget  and expenditure \ncredibility. 11  The  PEFA  report  rated  Indonesia\u2019s  aggregate  expenditure  outturn  as  C  and \ndowngraded  the  composition  of  expenditure  outturn  from  C  to  D.  Both  ratings  reflect  the \ngovernment\u2019s focus on expenditure controls rather than delivery and performance.  \n \n10. \nPoor  quality  of  public  service  delivery  by  subnational  governments.  The  central \ngovernment  implemented  major  local  governance  and  fiscal  decentralization  reforms  in  2001. \nThe  government  instituted  four  types  of  fiscal  transfers:  (i)  general  allocation  to  support  basic \nspending  including  civil  service  salaries;  (ii)  specific  allocation  grant  (DAK)  for  specific \ninvestment expenditures aligned with national priorities; (iii) revenue-sharing fund which covers \nnatural  resources  and  tax  revenue;  and  (iv)  regional  incentive  fund  (DID)  to  incentivize \nsubnational  governments\u2019  performance  including  on  public financial  management. While much \nwas accomplished, Indonesia\u2019s decentralization reforms remain a work in progress. The volume \nand  quality  of  local  public  service  delivery  varies  across  subnational  governments,  and \nimproving public service delivery in the poorer localities is a critical element of the government\u2019s \nefforts to reduce household income inequality. Two main factors impede quality of public service \ndelivery. First, fiscal transfers to poorer regions are insufficient to overcome funding deficiencies \nin social sectors and infrastructure therefore do not have the revenue equalizing effect intended, \nnor  are  they  linked  to  improved  performance  in  service  delivery  and  financial  management  of \nsubnational governments (footnote 4). Second, PFM capacities are uneven especially in poorer \nregions. Different accounting and reporting systems are used leading to difficulties in monitoring \nby  the  central  government.  The  PEFA  report  (footnote  11)  graded  the  extent  of  central \ngovernment monitoring of subnational government\u2019s budget performance as C. One outcome of \nthese  weaknesses  is  that  even  when  transfers  are  made,  some  subnational  governments \ndeposit transfers into fixed-term accounts instead of spending for public service delivery, due to \ninability  to plan  expenditure\u2014the  total  of  subnational  governments\u2019  budget  amounts  deposited \nin banks increased from Rp52.2 trillion in 2009 to Rp99.13 trillion in 2012.  \n \nGovernment  reform  agenda.  The  government\u2019s  approach  is  to  manage  the  twin \n11. \nproblems of the prolonged economic slowdown  and rising household income inequality  is built \naround two pillars. The first is to tackle household income inequality directly by implementing its \nSDGs\u2014aligning them with RPJMN targets, working out the cost and incorporating them into the \nmedium-term expenditure of line ministries, and addressing public spending deficiencies in the \nsocial sector and for infrastructure. The government will complement SDG implementation with \nnational  and  subnational  PEM  reforms  to  improve  the  quality  of  pro-poor  spending, \nreinforcement of performance incentives for fiscal transfers, and incremental but vital reforms to \n\n                                                \n10 International Monetary Fund. 2013.

Jakarta. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fsocial protection programs.  Fiscal decentralization is executed through the government\u2019s 2014 \ninstitutional  transformation  blueprint.  The  second  pillar  is  to  stimulate  the  economy  through \nfiscal  expansion  with  more  spending  on  public  infrastructure  and  the  social  sector,  which  is \nconsidered to have the largest multiplier effects on the economy. Fiscal savings of about Rp211 \ntrillion annually from the recent reduction in general subsidies to the non-poor will help fund the \ntargeted  social  protection  programs  and  the fiscal  stimulus.  Even  so,  to fund  the  stimulus, the \ngovernment  expects  to  operate  much  higher  national  government  budget  deficits  close  to  the \nconstitutional limit of 3.0% and net financing needs estimated at $22.3 billion in June 2016. The \ngovernment is implementing reforms to boost fiscal revenue collection which should bear result \nin  the  medium-term.  In  the  long-term,  higher  economic  growth  will  be  achieved  through \nstructural reforms to the investment climate, access to finance, energy sectors, more public and \nprivate  infrastructure  investments,  and  reforms  to basic  education,  all  supported  through  other \nADB program and project loans as well as technical assistance (TA).   \n \n12. \nADB  experience.  ADB  has  long  supported  reforms  in  PEM  and  social  protection \nthrough  several  loan  programs  and  TA  (Figure  2).  In  2005,  the  governance  focus  was  on \nbuilding  a  modern  national  public  financial  management  (PFM)  system  and  ADB  provided \nsupport  in setting  up  the  public  debt  management  office.  In  2008,  this  shifted  to  developing  a \nstronger  intergovernmental  fiscal  and  governance  framework.  ADB's  support  produced \nmeasurable  results,  including  introduction  of  financial  management  information  system  at  147 \nlocal  governments  and  devolution  of  local  taxes  to  subnational  governments. 12  ADB  also \nsupported  the  development  of  a  social  protection  framework  such  as  the  conditional  cash \ntransfer program and fiscal sustainability of JKN.13 Since 2012, ADB provided TA to improve the \nfiscal sustainability of social security, strengthen the fiscal decentralization framework (including \nDAK  reform),  and  support  fiscal  risk  management  from  accelerated  delivery  of  infrastructure \nprojects.14 Going forward, the FPEMP provides an umbrella operation supporting PEM reforms \nboth  at  national  and  subnational  levels  to  better  align  SDGs  with  the  RPJMN  and  the  budget \nplanning  process,  address  deficiencies  in  expenditure  in  social  sectors  and  for  infrastructure, \nand  improve  effectiveness  of  social  protection  programs.  The  FPEMP  supplements  ADB\u2019s \nprograms supporting the government to promote inclusive growth (footnote 6).15  \n \n13. \nLessons  from  the  experience.  ADB\u2019s  experience  provided  three  lessons  that  were \nincorporated  into  the  program.  First,  addressing  household  income  inequality  requires  a \ncomprehensive approach. This includes establishing an efficient PFM system to improve quality \nof spending and reforms to social protection to enable better targeting of pro-poor interventions. \nADB\u2019s previous Development Policy Support programs (footnote 13), and international empirical \nevidence shows a direct link between improvements in PEM and a reduction in poverty and the \nGini index (footnote 8).

ADB has given direct \nsupport  to  selected  reforms  that  underpin  FPEMP.  ADB  provided  TAs  to  improve  the  fiscal \nsustainability  of  social  security  reforms  including  JKN  and  strengthening fiscal  decentralization \nframework including introduction of performance based grant mechanism (footnote 13-14). ADB \nalso  helped  improve  the  fiscal  transfer  mechanism  by  creating  forward  estimates  for \nintergovernmental  financing,  upgrading  the  design  and  monitoring  of  DAK,  and  providing \ncapacity  building  on  fiscal  decentralization.  ADB  support  in  JKN  reforms  resulted  in  upward \nadjustments  in  premiums  which  improved  JKN\u2019s  financial  sustainability.  In  addition,  ADB  is \nproviding  TA  support  to  the  education  sector  including  capacity  development  of  subnational \ngovernments  in  108  districts  and  municipal  administrations  in  16  provinces  to  achieve  the \nminimum  service  standards  for  basic  education. 17  A  TA  is  being  prepared  to  help  the \ngovernment monitor and report progress in achieving the SDGs.  \n \n15. \nDevelopment partner coordination. Development partner coordination is strong in the \narea  of  fiscal  policy  and  PFM.  The  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW  is \nconsidering parallel financing for subprogram 1 with an indicative amount of  \u20ac200 million. Both \nthe ADB and KfW teams have worked closely with the government in formulating the program, \nincluding  the  policy  matrix.  The  World  Bank  supports  the  government\u2019s  efforts  on  revenue \nmobilization through its development policy loan. Close coordination between ADB, the IMF, the \nWorld  Bank,  and  other  development  partners  created  strong  programmatic  synergies  in \nsupporting  the  government\u2019s  fiscal  policy  and  PEM  reforms.  The  government  leads  the \ndevelopment partner coordination for assistance in decentralization, fiscal and PEM policies at \n                                                \n16 ADB.  2015.

The \ngovernments of Australia, France, Germany, and the United States are also active in PFM.18 \n \n16. \nThe  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  loans.  The  programmatic  approach \nthrough  policy-based  loans  was  chosen  over  other financing modalities  because  it  is  the most \neffective  in:  (i)  implementing  policies  to  achieve  RPJMN  and  SDGs  targets;  (ii)  leveraging \nreforms to PEM to make social protection programs fiscally sustainable; (iii) contributing to filling \nthe  gap  in  the  government\u2019s  financing  needs  to  address  funding  deficiencies  in  education, \nhealth,  social  protection  and  infrastructure;  and  (iv)  enabling  ADB  to  have  a  medium-term \nengagement  with  the  government.  The  program  will  have  two  subprograms  covered  by  a \nmedium-term results framework that reflects  the  long-term  engagement between ADB  and  the \ngovernment  on  fiscal  policy  and  PEM  reform.  Subprograms  3  and  4  may  be  included \nsubsequently  and  will  be  formulated  during  the  processing  of  subprogram  2  to  ensure  a \ncontinuous dialogue with stakeholders on emerging policy priorities including domestic revenue \nmobilization  and  the  government\u2019s  request.  Flexibility  is  retained  in  determining  the  loan  size \ndepending on the financing needs of the government in this period of revenue uncertainty.    \n \n17. \nEconomic  impact  of  the  program.  The  three  outputs  of  the  program  combined  are \nexpected to lead to improved social sector and infrastructure spending. The following potential \neconomic  gains  are  to  be  achieved  through  efficiency  gains:  (i)  medium-term  expenditure \naligned  with  RPJMN;  (ii)  national  public  expenditure  system  enhanced;  and  (iii)  transfers  and \nsubnational governments\u2019 spending on service delivery improved (para. 28). \n \nB. \n \n18. \nThe  impact  will  be  reduced  household  income  inequality  as  measured  by  the  Gini \ncoefficient in alignment with the government\u2019s RPJMN targets. The outcome will be social sector \nand infrastructure  spending  improved. The  program  will  include a series of  policy  reforms  and \ninterventions  and  is  designed  to  deliver  three  outputs.  Subprogram  1  contains  12  reform \nactions,  which  the  government  completed  between  January  and  August  2016.  Subprogram  2 \ncontains 12 reform policy actions, six of which are expected prior actions (triggers).  \n \nC. \n \n19. \nOutput  1:  Medium-term  expenditures  aligned  with  National  Medium-Term \nDevelopment  Plan  and  Sustainable  Development  Goals\u2019  targets. This output will align the \ngovernment\u2019s  medium-term  expenditure  with  RPJMN  and  SDGs  targets,  increase  spending  in \nsocial  sectors  and  infrastructure  and  reform  social  protection  programs.    Achievements  under \nsubprogram  1 \nthe  SDG \nimplementation  framework.  The  Presidential  Regulation  submitted  to  the  Cabinet  Secretariat \nlaid  out  implementation  plans  in  a  sequential  manner,  including  mapping  the  SDGs  targets \nagainst existing targets in RPJMN and setting up a steering committee chaired by the Minister \nof  National  Development  Planning  Agency  to  coordinate  implementation.  The  additional  fiscal \nspace  created  by  the  reduction  in  general  subsidies  was  utilized  to  increase  spending  on \neducation,  health,  social  protection,  and  infrastructure.  In  the  2016  budget,  the  government \nimplemented a 5% budget allocation to health (compared to 3.8% of total spending in the 2015 \nbudget),  which  amounts  to  a  39%  increase  in  health  spending.  The  2016  education  budget \nincreased by 2.0% over the 2015 budget, which translated to a small decline in spending when \nadjusted  for  inflation.  Social  protection  programs  received  a  five-fold  increase  in  the  2016 \n\nIn  2016,  the  government  developed \n\nthe  following. \n\nOutputs  \n\nincluded \n\n                                                \n18 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fbudget allocation.  The government, through the Social Security Agency, implements the JKN, \nwhich guarantees participants\u2019 access to basic health care. The government provides subsidies \nto those who fall within the bottom 40% of Indonesia\u2019s income distribution. In 2016, the number \nof subsidy recipients increased from 88.2 million to 92.4 million, representing 37% of the bottom \n40% of the population. In addition, the government implemented a 20% increase in the health \ninsurance premium of better off beneficiaries to improve the fiscal sustainability of the JKN. The \ngovernment also approved implementation of non-cash social protection (smart card) to improve \ntargeting and efficiency of the subsidized rice program (RASKIN).  \n \n20. \nFor  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  delineate  responsibilities  of  line  ministries  for \nSDG implementation and provide periodic reporting of progress achieved. The government will \nalso  implement  (i)  measures  to  improve  the  targeting,  coverage,  and  monitoring  of  its  social \nprotection  programs,  (ii)  inflation-adjusted  spending  increases  in  education  and  health  aligned \nwith mandated target and (iii) inflation adjusted spending increase in public infrastructure.  \n \n21. \nOutput 2: National public expenditure system enhanced. This output will improve the \nnational  PEM  with  a  focus  on  disbursement,  reporting  and  evaluation.  Accomplishments \nincluded  under  subprogram  1  included  the  following.  The  government  adopted  information \ntechnology  tools  (i)  which  required  line  ministries  to  prepare  standardized  budget  proposal \nfocusing  on  output  and  outcomes  and  (ii)  through  Ministry  of  Finance  implemented  online \nmonitoring  of  budget  implementation  including  revenue,  expenditure  and  financing.  Both \nreforms are part of the broader integrated financial management information system supporting \nperformance-based budgeting. The government also established a budget realization evaluation \nand  monitoring  team  headed  by  the  Minister  of  Finance  to  speed  up  budget  execution.    The \nstate  treasury  and  budget  system  aims  to  manage  all  financial  transaction  data  of  the  central \ngovernment in a full cycle, from budget appropriation to production of financial statements.  \n \n22. \nministries more flexibility, and improve online monitoring of financial management information. \n \n23. \nOutput  3:  Fiscal  transfers  and  subnational  governments\u2019  spending  for  service \ndelivery  improved.  This  output  will  strengthen  subnational  PFM  system  to  improve  budget \nexecution.  Accomplishments  under  subprogram  1  included  the  following.  The  government \nincreased  allocation  and  better-targeted  fiscal  transfers.  In  2016,  51%  of  the  national  budget \nconsists  of  transfers  to  subnational  governments.  This  is  a  significant  increase  in  the  overall \nDAK \u2014from Rp58.8 trillion in 2015 to Rp211 trillion in 2016\u2014 and in DAK allocation for health \nservice:  from  Rp6.8  trillion  in  2015  to  Rp20.9  trillion  in  2016.  The  government  also  increased \nDID  allocation  from  Rp1.6  trillion  in  the  revised  2015  national  budget  to  Rp5.0 trillion  in  the \nnational  budget  for  2016.  To  provide  incentives  for  better  performance  by  subnational \ngovernments,  the  government  integrated  local  government  rating  on  PFM  and  public  services \ndelivery to determine DID allocation. Finally, to address idle funds, the government implemented \ngovernment bond transfers to subnational governments with low levels of budget execution. \n \n24. \nFor subprogram 2, the government will implement a monitoring and evaluation system of \nthe  DAK  for  health,  education,  and  local  infrastructure;  refine  subnational  governments\u2019 \nperformance  indicators  to  improve  the  selection  criteria  for  recipients  of  DID;  and  reinforce \nmeasures to address idle funds and slow budget execution at subnational governments\u2019 level.  \n \nD. \n \n25. \n\nFor  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  simplify  budget  execution,  such  as  giving  line \n\nThe government has requested a policy-based loan of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs  \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fcapital resources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace  period  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest rate determined in  accordance with ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  Based  on  this,  the \naverage loan maturity is 9.25 years, and no maturity premium is payable to ADB. The proceeds \nof  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  disbursed  to  Indonesia  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time).  \n \nThe  net  development  financing  needs  are  estimated  between  $22.3  billion  and  $26.8 \n26. \nbillion, and the budget deficit  between 2.4% and 2.8% of GDP depending on final tax revenue \ncollection.  To  finance  the  deficit,  the  government  planned  to  raise  $5.5  billion  from  official \nforeign  loans  (including USD  2.7  billion  of  program  loans). The size of  subprogram  1  primarily \nreflects  the  government\u2019s  financing  needs,  the  strength  of  the  reform  program,  and  the \nimplementation  costs,  including  increasing  JKN  subsidies  for  the  bottom  40%  and  boosting \nspending on education and health (para. 28). \n \nE. \n \n27. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance\u2019s  Fiscal  Policy  Agency  as the  executing  agency  is  responsible \nfor  coordinating  the  government\u2019s  FPEMP-related  reforms.  Implementing  agencies  include the \ndirectorates  general  of  budget,  treasury,  and  fiscal  balance.  SDG  implementation,  monitoring, \nand  progress  reports  will  be  through  the  national  steering  committee  on  SDG  implementation. \nThe  implementation  period  is  January  2015  to  August  2016  for  subprogram  1  and  September \n2016 to November 2017 for subprogram 2.  \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nGovernance \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n28. \nThe program will have positive economy-wide impacts. The program impact assessment \nestimates  the  potential  new  quantifiable  benefits  of  the  program  at  $6.4  billion,  under \nconservative  discounting  assumptions,  which  well  exceed  the  program\u2019s  costs. 19 Using  the \nsocial  accounting  matrixes,  the  reallocation  of  general  subsidies  to  additional  expenditure  on \nhealth  and  education  is  estimated  to  yield  a  benefit  of  $3.0  billion,  social  protection  at  $7.3 \nbillion,  and  infrastructure  at  $1.6  billion.  Strengthening  subnational  PEM  systems,  increasing \nfiscal  transfer  and  design  of  DAK  and  DID,  is  estimated  to  yield  a  benefit  of  $8.8  billion.  The \nreforms and associated higher expenditures will entail costs of about $14.8 billion.   \n \nB. \n \nThe government has made considerable progress in improving the legal and regulatory \n29. \nframework  for  PFM.  Since  the  enactment  of  laws  on  state  finance,  state  treasury,  and  state \naudit in 2003\u20132004, most regulations underpinning these laws have been promulgated. In 2012, \nthe number of government agencies that received an unqualified audit opinion from the external \naudit agency increased to 65% (from about 40% in 2009). ADB has reinforced this momentum \nwith  continuing  support  to  improve  technical  capacity  on  state  audit.  As  a  result  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s  continuing  commitment  to  reducing  corruption,  the  capacity  of  the  Corruption \nEradication  Commission  has  improved  markedly.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \n                                                \n19 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n \n30. \nThe reforms supported under the program will help reduce income inequality. More pro-\npoor  spending  and  better-targeted  subsidies  will  benefit  the  bottom  40%  of  the  population. \nImproved  PEM  systems  and  additional  and  better-designed  fiscal  transfers  to  subnational \ngovernments  will  benefit  the  poor  through  improved  targeting  of  assistance.  Subprogram  1  is \ncategorized  as  no  gender  elements,  but  ADB  will  discuss  with  government  to  elevate  future \nsubprograms to at least some gender elements.  \n \nD. \n \n31. \nFollowing an assessment of the proposed policy actions, the program will not have any \nlikely  social  safeguard  issues  and  is  assigned  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \nE. \n \n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the  risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.20 The expected net benefits and impacts of the program are expected to \noutweigh  the  risks.  Weakness  in  PEM  and  inadequate  capacity  are  risks  that  may  slow \ntargets.  Revenue  shortfall  may  also  undermine \nimplementation  of  RPJMN  and  SDG \ngovernment\u2019s  proposed  spending  in  social  sector  and  for  infrastructure.  ADB  is  supporting \nstrengthening PEM through the program and is providing TA to improve capacity on state audit \nand SDG implementation in health and education (footnotes 16 and 17).  \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n33. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as described  in  detail  in the loan \ndocuments.  \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION  \n\n \n34. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  loan  would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\nthe  programmatic  approach  for  the  Fiscal  and  Public  Expenditure  Management \nProgram, and  \nthe  loan  of  $500,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  subprogram  1  of  the \nFiscal  and  Public  Expenditure  Management  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of \n15 years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n19 October 2016 \n\n                                                \n20 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible form the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Program is Aligned with \nHousehold income inequality reduced (National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2015\u20132019)a \n\n \n\n \nResults Chain \n\nPerformance Indicators with \nTargets and Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \n\n \nRisks \n\nOutcome \nSocial sector and \ninfrastructure \nspending improved \n\nContinuous market \nturmoil and low \ncommodity prices affect \nbudget revenue. \n\nBy 2020 \n \na.
