Since August 2017, Bangladesh has received more than \n700,000  displaced  persons.  These  displaced  persons,  which  mostly  reached  Bangladesh  by \ncrossing the nearby border on foot, joined about 400,000 other displaced persons who had arrived \nin waves from Rahkine State earlier.4 The vast majority of displaced persons who have arrived in \nBangladesh  are  living  in  32  camps  in  Coxsbazar  District,  with  more  than  600,000  living  in  the \nKutupalong\u2013Balukhali  mega  camp.  The  large  influx  of  displaced  persons  has  caused  a  huge \nstrain  on  the  local  infrastructure  and  economy.  The  2:1  ratio  of  displaced  persons  to  the  local \npopulation poses significant challenges to the food supply, shelter, health, sanitation, water, and \nother essential services. Although UN agencies and other donors are providing humanitarian relief \nsuch as food, water, medical aid, and temporary shelter, the existing services are stretched, and \nlarge gaps remain.5 \n \n4. \nRequest for emergency assistance. On 7 May 2018, the Government of Bangladesh \nrequested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  grant  support  to  provide  high-priority  basic \ninfrastructure and essential services to help address the humanitarian crisis caused by the arrival \n\n                                                \n1  The provision of a grant to Bangladesh from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Special Fund resources (Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  [ADF])  for  the  project is  subject  to  the Board\u2019s approval  of  a separate  proposal  (submitted in \nparallel to this paper) waiving provisions of applicable ADB policies that would otherwise prohibit such grant support. \nPrior  to  submission  of  this  proposal  to  the  Board,  ADF  donors  endorsed  the  allocation  of  $100  million  in  ADF \nresources to provide special grant support to Bangladesh for the project. \n\n2  UN, Strategic Executive Group. 2018. 2018 JRP for Rohingya Humanitarian Crisis, March\u2013December 2018.

The  policy  further  provides  that  an  emergency \noccurs after a disaster when unforeseen circumstances require immediate action; and that emergencies may involve, \namong other things, displacement of people, disease, food insecurity, and reduced public safety and security. All \nthese circumstances and factors are present in this case. \n\n5  UN, Strategic Executive Group. 2018. 2018 JRP for Rohingya Humanitarian Crisis, March\u2013December 2018.

The  international  community,  led  by  the  UN,  has \nengaged in multisector needs assessments, consultations, and strategic planning that culminated \nin a joint humanitarian response plan and the JRP.7 The JRP lays out a vision for a coordinated \nresponse to address the immediate needs of the displaced persons and mitigate the impact on \nthe local communities. The cost to implement the JRP for March\u2013December 2018 is about $950 \nmillion, of which only 21% is funded. The JRP identifies the key needs related to (i) decongestion \nand relocation to protect more than 200,000 displaced persons currently vulnerable to floods and \nlandslides  in  camp  areas;  (ii)  the  lack  of  sludge  management  facilities  to  process  420,000 \nkilograms of human waste generated per day in camps; (iii) the construction and maintenance of \nhand pumps and surface water treatment plants to provide 16 million liters of safe water; and (iv) \nfood  and  cooking  fuel;  basic  health  care,  obstetric  and  childcare,  and  disease  prevention; \neducation and skills; and ecosystem rehabilitation. In response to the government\u2019s request, ADB \nfielded a reconnaissance mission on 15\u221216 May 2018 to collect the most up-to-date information \nand consulted with government officials, development partners, and stakeholders. Accordingly, \nADB identified a preliminary scope of the project, in coordination with development partners, in \nline with the JRP. A fact-finding mission during 3\u22127 June confirmed the high-priority needs.8 \n \nDisaster risk. The southeastern part of Bangladesh is highly susceptible to various types \n6. \nof  natural  hazards,  and  cyclone  and  monsoon  seasons,  which  include  flooding,  landslides, \nwindstorms,  lightning,  fires,  heat  waves,  and  cold  spells.9  Climate  change  is  expected  to \naggravate the intensity, frequency, and unpredictability of extreme weather events. Much of the \nland used for the camps is steep or low-lying and prone to flooding and landslides. This is further \nexacerbated by hill cutting and vegetation clearing on the mainly clay hills (footnote 5). The host \npopulation  in  the  seven  Upazilas  (subdistricts)  comprising  Coxsbazar  District  is  among \nBangladesh\u2019s  most  vulnerable  because  of  food  insecurity,  poor  health conditions,  and  poverty \nrates that are well above Bangladesh\u2019s national average (footnote 5). Congested living conditions \nand poor sanitation in the camps create additional health risks, including fires and vector- and \nwaterborne  diseases.  Women  and  children  in  these  camps  are  among  the  most  vulnerable \npopulation groups in disaster events.10 \n \n7. \nEconomic  impacts.  There  is  no  clear  estimate  of  the  economic  and  financial  losses \ncaused  by  the  crisis  emanating  from  the  influx  of  displaced  persons,  according  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s  Office of  the  Refugee  Relief  and Repatriation Commission  (RRRC).  However,  a \nwide range of sectors have been affected. After crossing the border, hundreds of thousands of \ndisplaced persons walked through paddy fields causing significant agricultural production losses. \nIn  addition  to  the  camp  areas,  which  occupy  about  2,350  hectares  of  reserve  forest  land,  the \nequivalent of about four football field-sized areas of forest is being cut down every day for fuel. \nThe  prices  of  necessary  commodities  have  increased  significantly  because  of  rising  demand. \nOverburdened infrastructure in the area is also causing social and economic losses. \n\n                                                \n6  The project meets the five eligibility criteria for an emergency assistance loan, as well as the six characteristics of an \nemergency  assistance  loan,  as  defined  in  ADB.  2015.  Staff  Instruction  on  Processing  and  Administration  of \nEmergency Assistance Loans. Compendium of Staff Instructions. Manila. \n\n7  The JRP targets 1.3 million people, including 336,000 host community members. Its four strategic objectives are to \n(i) provide timely lifesaving assistance and protection to and improve the living conditions of people; (ii) ensure the \nwell-being and dignity of people; (iii) support environmentally sustainable solutions; and (iv) build the confidence and \nresilience of people. \n\n8  Summary Assessment of Damage and Needs (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  Disaster risk is a function of hazards, exposure, and vulnerability. \n10 UN,  Inter  Sector  Coordination  Group.

Coxsbazar  District,  especially  the  Teknaf  and  Ukhia  Upazilas \n(subdistricts), has high baseline levels of poverty, environmental vulnerability, underemployment, \nand underinvestment; and had poor access to services even before the 2017 influx.11 The poor \ndepend on daily labor as their main source of income. Most settlements are in rural villages and \nagricultural plots interspersed with government forest, plantations, and ecologically critical areas. \nThe  geographical  location  produces  a  multi-hazard  environment  where  recurrent  extreme \nweather events undermine households\u2019 resilience and livelihoods. \n \n9. \nDevelopment partner coordination. Twelve UN agencies, some 127 international and \nnational  nongovernment  agencies,  and  several  faith-based  organizations  and  government \ninterventions are providing humanitarian aid and relief.12 The UN-led Inter Sector Coordination \nGroup (ISCG) prepared the JRP in coordination with the government (para. 5). The World Bank \nis preparing its support in phases. The first phase would amount to $240 million and include (i) a \nhealth,  nutrition,  and  population  service  project  to  expand  health  service  provisions;  (ii)  an \neducation  and  skills  training  project  that  would  target  out-of-school  children  and  expand  basic \nnumeracy and literacy programs and life skills training; and (iii) a multisector support project that \nwould combine interventions in disaster risk management, water and sanitation, environmental \nprotection, social protection, gender equality and social inclusion. \n \nADB would ensure that there is no duplication with other development partners through \n10. \nits Bangladesh Resident Mission, which is coordinating closely with the Local Consultative Group, \nUN  agencies,  and  the  World  Bank.  The  Strategy  Executive  Group\u23af  led  by  the  UN  High \nCommissioner  for  Refugees,  the  UN  Resident  Coordinator  (UNRC),  and  the  International \nOrganization for Migration\u23afin Dhaka and the ISCG and RRRC in Coxsbazar are coordinating \nwith  the  donors.  The  National  Task  Force  is  the  government\u2019s  highest  coordination  body \nconstituted by a cabinet comprising of 37 ministries and agencies, with the secretariat in Ministry \nof Foreign Affairs. \n \n11. \nAt  the  Donors\u2019  Consultation  Meeting  organized  by  ADB  on  6  June  2018,  development \npartners agreed to collaborate closely to avoid duplication and to take up the prioritized projects.13 \nADB has held detailed consultations through bilateral meetings with the World Bank, the World \nFood Programme, the UN Development Programme, the UNRC, and other development partners; \nand regularly briefs the Local Consultative Group, which coordinates donors in Bangladesh. ADB \nwill continue to participate in the Strategy Executive Group\u2019s fortnightly meetings and will also join \nthe  site-level  coordination  group  in  Coxsbazar  to  avoid  duplicating  activities  and  to  maintain \nquality and speed during implementation. \n \n\n                                                \n11 According to the UN Development Assistance Framework, Coxsbazar is one of the 20 (out of 64) lagging districts in \nBangladesh  based  on  poverty,  literacy,  and  nutrition  indicators;  and  environmental  degradation  risks.  Further, \naccording to the pockets of social deprivation evaluation of the UN Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), Teknaf and Ukhia are \namong the 50 most socially deprived subdistricts of Bangladesh, based on indicators of literacy, child labor, access \nto sanitary toilets, and connection to electricity. On average, 33%  of the population in these two subdistricts  lives \nbelow the poverty line (17% live below the extreme poverty line), and 38% is vulnerable to food insecurity (12.5% is \nconsidered highly vulnerable). Food production in the district is scarce, leading to increased household expenditures \non food and economic vulnerability overall. \n\n12  Emergency Assistance Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Participants included Australia, Canada, Danida, European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations,  the \nEuropean Union, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, the International Organization for Migration, Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency,  the Netherlands, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, \nUNICEF,  the  UN  Development  Programme,  the  UN  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees,  the  UN  Population  Fund, \nUNRC, the United States, the United States Agency for International Development, the World Bank, and the World \nFood Programme. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fImpact and Outcome \n\nLessons in disaster response. The government is successfully coping with cyclone risk \n12. \nand has a track record of emergency preparedness and community-based disaster risk reduction. \nEmergency  preparedness  and  community-based  disaster risk management  in  the  project  area \nwill build on past and ongoing government efforts and will complement the JRP. In addition to \nensuring that new infrastructure will factor in the risks of natural hazards and climate change, the \nproject  will  support  awareness  raising,  capacity  development,  and  risk  management  action \nplanning in the camps and local communities. To promote transparency, reduce the administrative \nburden,  and  ensure  sound  management,  ADB  will  provide  a  TA  grant  to  set  up  results-based \nmonitoring and evaluation systems. ADB will also coordinate closely with donors while selecting \nand designing the individual subproject activities to identify synergies and avoid duplication. \n \n13. \nProposed ADB support. Given the urgent need to provide basic infrastructure services \nto the displaced persons, ADB proposes grant financing of $100 million for investments that will \nhelp with the immediate needs of the displaced persons, with the possibility of additional financing \nof up to $100 million in a second phase. The scope and timing of the second phase of support \nwould be subject to the progress of the first phase, an assessment of needs, and the availability \nof additional grant funds, among other factors. ADB support will be within the framework of the \nJRP  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  water  and  sanitation,  (ii)  disaster  risk  management,  (iii)  energy \nsupply, and (iv) road access to and within camps.  \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: social recovery of displaced persons in \nTeknaf  and  Ukhia  camps  accelerated.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  living \nconditions and the resilience of displaced persons improved (footnote 3). The project will directly \nbenefit  the  lives  of  people  in  camps  while  indirectly  co-benefitting  host  communities  in  some \ninstances.  ADB  is  cognizant  of  sensitivities  and  potential  conflicts  among  and  within  affected \ncommunities. These will be addressed through a gender- and socially-inclusive approach, among \nothers. \n \nC. \n \nOutput 1: Water supply and sanitation improved. This consists of providing the camp \n15. \nareas  with  (i)  mobile  water  carriers  for  the  distribution  of  treated  water;  (ii)  community  bathing \nfacilities for women; (iii) mini piped water supply systems with a production tube well, distribution \npipe  network,  and  standpipe  water  distribution  points;  (iv)  an  integrated  waste  management \nfacility with collection system; and (v) small surface water treatment plants. \n \n16. \nOutput 2: Disaster risk management strengthened. This includes constructing in and \naround the camp areas (i) multipurpose cyclone shelters with emergency access roads, (ii) food \ndistribution centers, (iii) hill slope protection and/or toe walls to resist landslides, and (iv) storm \nwater  drainage  networks.  The  project  will  also  provide  lightning  arresters  and  support  the \npreparation of gender-sensitive disaster risk management plans with community-based disaster \nrisk reduction approach. \n \n17. \nOutput  3:  Energy  sources  provided.  This  includes  providing  the  camp  areas  with  (i) \nretained heat cookers; (ii) stand-alone solar powered street lights with solar photovoltaic panels, \nbattery boxes, and mini grid-connected street lights; and (iii) access to electricity by augmenting \nsubstations, distribution lines, and transformers. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fOutput  4:  Access  roads  improved.  This  consists  of  rehabilitating  (i)  rural  roads  to \n18. \nconnect to food storage and distribution centers, field hospitals, primary health care centers, and \nprimary  education  centers;  (ii)  emergency  access  roads  to  the  camp  areas;  and  (iii)  existing \naccess  roads  to  and  within  the  camps  and  drainage  systems.  The  project  also  supports \nresurfacing the road from Coxsbazar to Teknaf, which is the main supply line. \n \n19. \nSubprojects. ADB will apply a sector lending approach in selecting an investment under \neach of the outputs.14 Within the JRP framework, ADB will prioritize subprojects for development \nand implementation to optimize the available resources in close coordination with the government \nand development partners. Each subproject will be subject to ADB\u2019s prior approval based on the \nfollowing selection criteria: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\ndirect impact on the lives of the international displaced persons in the camp areas, \nno or minimal land acquisition or acquisition of government land, \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguards  requirements  and  no  activities  inside  critical \nhabitats and protected areas, \nno duplication of activities funded by other donors, \nimplementation period not extending beyond the project closing date, and \ninclusion of feedback from a beneficiary consultation process. \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n \nD. \n \n20. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $120  million  (Table  1).

RRRC  and  ADB  will  conduct  regular  coordination  meetings \ninvolving  all  executing  and  implementing  agencies;  stakeholders,  including  the  deputy \ncommissioner  of  Coxsbazar;  and  other  development  partners  and  agencies.  ADB  plans  to \nestablish a liaison office in Coxsbazar to facilitate coordination with RRRC, the ISCG, and other \ndevelopment partners; and expedite subproject development and implementation. \n \nThe  Local  Government  Engineering  Department,  the  Department  of  Public  Health \n26. \nEngineering,  the  Roads  and  Highways  Department,  and  the  Bangladesh  Rural  Electrification \nBoard will each be concurrent executing and implementing agencies for project activities in their \nrespective  areas  of  responsibility.18  Dedicated  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  will  be \nestablished in each implementing agency, as needed, and will be headed by experienced project \ndirectors to manage day-to-day implementation activities, project management, and reporting. \n \n27. \nthe PAM (footnote 15). \n \n28. \nProcurement.  Executing  and  implementing  agencies  will  carry  out  the  procurement  of \ngoods, works, and consulting services in a manner consistent with the simplified and expedient \nprocedures  in  ADB  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  (2004),  the  ADB  Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time), and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\n                                                \n17 Climate Risk Assessment and Management Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  The Local Government Engineering Department is expected to implement subprojects under outputs  2, and 4 within \nits areas of responsibility. Depending on the nature of the activity, subprojects will be implemented by the Department \nof Public Health Engineering (output 1), the Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board (output 3), and the Roads and \nHighways Department (output 4). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f(2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Most  civil  works  and  goods  contracts  will  be  awarded \nthrough  open  competitive  bidding  (OCB)  and  the  national  advertisement  method.  To  ensure \nefficiency, special procedures for emergency lending will be used, including reducing the bidding \nperiod  to  14  days  when  appropriate;  using  single-stage  one-envelope  bidding  procedures; \ndeveloping a master bid document for each implementing agency; and developing a time-bound \naction  plan  to  award  contracts,  including  a  contract  management  plan.  Some  civil  works  and \ngoods  contracts  may  be  procured  using  direct  contracting,  where  appropriate,  following \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Small  and  simple  works  and  goods  up  to  $100,000  may  be \nprocured using international and/or national request for quotations. ADB encourages community \nparticipation in the procurement of small works of a simple nature. Subject to bidding documents \nbeing modified to comply with ADB requirements, the national electronic government procurement \nsystem will be used for OCB to award most civil and supply contracts, although manual or off-line \nbidding may be used where appropriate. \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date  \nEstimated grant closing date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)   Implementing agencies \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and advance \ncontracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nArrangements \nJuly 2018\u2013December 2020 \n31 December 2020 \n30 June 2021 \n\n55 contracts \n\n$99.1 million \n\nCentral Committee \nOffice of the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commission in Coxsbazar  \nLGED, DPHE, RHD, BREB \nLGED, DPHE, RHD, BREB  \nDedicated PIU of each implementing agency \nOCB (national advertisement) \nDirect contracting \nLCB \nRequest for quotation \nQCBS and CQS, OCB, international \nand/or national advertisement, or LCB \nSingle source selection \nIndividual consultant international \nadvertisement/national advertisement \nAdvance and retroactive financing will apply for the procurement of civil \nworks, goods, and consulting services; and for project administration.

Other \nmethods, such as the consultants\u2019 qualifications selection, may also be used where appropriate. \nIndividual  consultants  will  be  recruited  using  the  individual  selection  method  with  international \nand/or local advertisements, based on the project\u2019s requirements. Consultants who are already \nengaged in ADB-financed projects and provide similar services as those required for the project \nmay be recruited directly, subject to their satisfactory performance. This arrangement will provide \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nan  efficient  way  to  recruit  consultants  under  the  circumstances.  Local  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) may provide some social and gender studies and/or support. The option to \nhave  a  direct  contract  or  a  memorandum  of  understanding  with  NGOs  and/or  UN  agencies \nalready engaged in the project area may also be explored where appropriate. \n \n30. \nGoods,  works,  and  consulting  services  will  be  procured  based  on  the  detailed \narrangements  in  the  project\u2019s  procurement  plan,  including  the  procurement  and  selection \nmethods, the type of bidding documents, and ADB\u2019s review requirements. ADB will review two \nsimilar contracts for each respective agency prior to tendering, and the rest of the contracts will \nbe post reviewed (sampling). All executing and implementing agencies will be required to (i) use \nthe Procurement Activity Monitoring Tool, a web-based database, to record and monitor the time \ntaken for each step of the procurement process and track any delays; and (ii) take appropriate \nactions for all prior and post-review packages of goods and works under the project.19 \n \n\nIII. \n\nATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \nTo strengthen and sustain the institutional and technical capacities of the executing and \n31. \nimplementing agencies for the timely and efficient delivery of the project outputs, the government \nhas  requested  ADB  to  provide  TA  grant  support  for  the  project.  ADB,  through  its  Bangladesh \nResident Mission, will administer the TA to support the project activities being carried out by the \nexecuting and implementing agencies within their respective areas of responsibility. The TA will \nhave three outputs: (i) institutional and technical capacity strengthened; (ii) planning, designing, \nand  implementing  the  proposed  subprojects  supported;  and  (iii)  an  effective  monitoring  and \nevaluation  system  established.  The  first  output  will  provide  capacity  building  support  to  the \nexecuting and implementing agencies and RRRC, including the liaison office, for procurement, \ncontract  management,  quality  control,  and  disbursement.  The  second  output  will  support \nexecuting and implementing agencies with capacity constraints and low readiness of subproject \nselected, \ntechnical  and  safeguards  due  diligence,  design,  procurement,  and  contract \nmanagement.  The  third  output  will  help  establish  monitoring  and  evaluating  systems  for  the \nexecuting and implementing agencies, RRRC, and the liaison office. The TA is estimated to cost \n$3,100,000, of which $3,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial  Fund  (TASF  6).20  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \nlocal \ncounterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  office  supplies,  secretarial  assistance, \ntransportation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n32. \nAll  new  infrastructure  will  be  disaster-resilient  and  climate-smart  and  will  be  based  on \nhazard, climate, and risk analyses; modified design criteria; and the careful selection of materials \nand  monitoring  of  field  practices.  The  final  selection  of  subprojects  will  follow  the  subproject \nselection  criteria  included  in  the  PAM  (footnote  15).  These  include  adherence  to  safeguard \nrequirements and technical and economic viability. The implementing agencies and ADB will lead \nthe screening process of priority projects, in coordination with other development partners to avoid \nduplication. \n \n\n                                                \n19 ADB developed the Procurement Activity Monitoring Tool under TA (ADB. 2013.

However, because of the short processing time available for the emergency response, it \nwas not possible to collect data and undertake full economic due diligence prior to seeking Board \napproval. Therefore, economic due diligence will be conducted on all selected subprojects during \nproject implementation following ADB guidelines on economic analysis to ensure that the selected \nsubprojects are economically viable. The TA for project implementation will include resources to \nundertake the necessary subproject economic analysis in compliance with ADB requirements. \n \n34. \nProject  outputs  are  public  service  goods  with  no  opportunity  for  cost  recovery,  so  no \nfinancial  viability  assessment  is  required.  Water  supply  and  sanitation  systems,  buildings  and \nstructures, energy supply systems, and roads constructed under the project will be maintained \nusing the relevant ministries\u2019 ongoing recurrent budget. While this will be assessed during project \nimplementation, government commitment has also been obtained as a grant assurance. \n \nC. \n \n35. \nADB  conducted  an  updated  financial  management  assessment  of  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies for the project.21 The review is based on existing financial management \nassessment  of  the  same  executing  and  implementing  agencies  taking  into  consideration  the \nlessons  learned  during  implementation  of  past  and  existing  projects,  various  sector  level \ngovernance  assessments,  and  interviews  with  project  management  units  and  other  relevant \ngovernment staff.22 All four executing and implementing agencies have experience implementing \nADB-funded projects. The overall financial management risk is substantial, but it can be managed \nby implementing the mitigation measures agreed with the executing and implementing agencies, \nincluding (i) deploying PIU staff with prior ADB project experience, and (ii) strengthening internal \ncontrols and financial reporting based on detailed assessments. Financial management experts \nfunded  by  the TA grant will  be  engaged  to  provide  capacity  building support  and fiduciary risk \nmonitoring, including compliance with audited project financial statement requirements. \n \nA  procurement  assessment  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  revealed  that \n36. \nprocurement  and  contract  management  risk  is  manageable  through  the  implementation  of \nmitigation measures agreed with the executing and implementing agencies, including (i) deploying \nPIU staff with prior ADB project experience, and (ii) introducing an efficient contract award and \ncontract implementation management plan. Procurement experts funded by the TA grant will be \nengaged  to  provide  capacity  building  support  to  ensure  compliance  with  agreed  procurement \nprocedures. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n37. \nwith  the  government  and  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \n\n                                                \n21 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 LGED is currently implementing loans 2462, 3142, 2695, 3550 and 2542; DPHE is currently implementing loans 3133 \nand 3550; RHD is currently implementing loans 2949 and 3592; and BREB is currently implementing loans 3522 and \n3350. \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nSafeguards \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nD. \n \n38. \nThe project is expected to ease basic infrastructure and social service constraints in the \nTekhnaf and Ukhia camps. The settlements are in rural villages and agricultural plots interspersed \nwith  government  forest,  plantations,  and  ecologically  critical  areas.  Providing  clean  water  and \naccess to sanitation and latrines in and around the camps will improve the health conditions of \nthe communities and prevent waterborne diseases. Better lighting will make it safer for women \nand  children  to  move  and  will  help  bridge  the  supply  and  demand  gap  for  fuel  and  energy  in \nhouseholds. The construction and rehabilitation of roads will accelerate relief distribution, improve \nmobility in the camps, and facilitate economic activities and income generation. \n \n39. \nThe project is classified effective gender mainstreaming, and ADB has prepared a gender \nequality and social inclusion (GESI) action plan in consultation with the ISCG and its Gender in \nHumanitarian  Assistance  platform.  To  ensure  the  effective  implementation  of  the  GESI  action \nplan, the project team will hire social development experts based in Coxsbazar and a national \nNGO  for  effective  social  mobilization  services.  This  will  ensure  the  effective  participation  of \nwomen and disadvantaged groups in project-supported activities, in line with the commitments \nset out in the action plan, including labor opportunities, decision-making processes, and access \nto basic services. ADB will collect sex-disaggregated data to report GESI-related results. \n \nE. \n \n40. \ncategories are as follows.23 \n \n41. \nEnvironment (category B). ADB formed subproject selection criteria to avoid significant \nadverse  environmental  impacts.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF) \nhas been prepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement (2009) and government laws \nand regulations. ADB has disclosed the EARF on its website. Implementation arrangements build \non  the  implementing  agencies\u2019  experience  from  other  ADB-financed  projects,  and  the  project \nteam  will  help  the  implementing  agencies  gain  adequate  capacity  to  manage  environmental \nimpacts  through  consultant  support.  Initial  environmental  examinations  and  environmental \nmanagement plans will be prepared consistent with the EARF and will be incorporated in bidding \ndocuments  and  contract  documents  to  be  implemented  by  contractors  and  monitored  by  the \nimplementing  agencies.  Executing  and/or  implementing  agencies  will  provide  environmental \nreport to the Bangladesh Resident Mission on a semiannual basis. \n \n42. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). ADB formed subproject selection criteria to avoid \nland acquisition and involuntary resettlement impacts and social risks. A resettlement framework \nhas been prepared and disclosed, following ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement and government \nlaws and regulations, to guide planning studies and detailed designs of subprojects. The project \nteam will help the implementing agencies gain adequate capacity to prepare resettlement plans, \nif  required,  through  consultant  support.  Consultations  will  be  undertaken  with  stakeholders  in \nproject  areas  during  implementation.  Executing  and/or  implementing  agencies  will  provide \nresettlement implementation report to the Bangladesh Resident Mission on a semiannual basis. \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n                                                \n23  ADB.
