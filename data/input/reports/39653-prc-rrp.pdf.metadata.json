Nine \nsubprojects have been selected for the first financing tranche. The \nenergy savings will result from retrofitting existing equipment with \nmore efficient equipment, which in aggregate will reduce the need \nto  construct  and  operate  a  conventional  coal-fired  power  plant. \nThe Investment Program requires designing a suitable EPP model \nas  a  pilot  in  Guangdong  that  can  be  scaled  up  and  replicated  in \nother  high  energy  consuming  provinces.  An  EPP  can  be \ndeveloped  at  about  half  the  cost  of  a  coal-fired  power  plant. \nEnergy  savings  from  an  EPP  have  multiple  benefits:  (i)  energy \nsecurity  improves  as  lesser  new  power  supply  capacity  will  be \nneeded  to  meet  future  demand,  and  less  coal  will  be  used  for \npower  generation;  and  (ii)  the  local  and  subregional  environment \nimproves,  and  the  contribution  to  global  climate  change  is  lower \nbecause of avoided coal use. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  consider  only  retrofits  of  proven \nenergy  efficiency  technologies  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  motors \nand  motor-drive  systems;  (ii)  transformers  and  reactive  power \ncompensators;  (iii)  lighting;  (iv)  heating,  ventilation,  and  air \nconditioning; \n(v)  air  compressors  and  pumping  systems; \n(vi) recovery  of  waste  energy  from  industry;  (vii)  industrial  boilers \nand  industrial  cogeneration;  and  (viii)  other  related  energy \nefficiency improvement projects. \n \n \n\n \n\n\fthe \n\nimplement \n\n(EPP-PMO)  will \n\nThe success of the pilot EPP Investment Program will depend on \nhow  quickly  barriers  can  be  lowered  and  necessary  investments \nare made by end users. A multitranche financing facility (MFF) is \nproposed  to  enable  Guangdong  provincial  government  (GPG)  to \nincrease awareness of EPP, select appropriate EPP subprojects, \nand  systematically  expand  and \nInvestment \nProgram.  Since  this  is  the  first  EPP  project  for  both  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and GPG, a phased implementation is \nplanned  under  successive  tranche  loans  of  the  MFF.  While \nimplementation of subprojects under tranche 1 is in progress, the \nEPP-Project  Management  Office \nseek \napplications  from  other  high  impact  subborrowers  with  potential \nfor  higher  energy  savings.  The  experience  gained  during  the \nselection  and  design  of  subprojects  in  tranche  1  will  be  used  to \nsolicit applications from other types of subborrowers (e.g., budget-\nfunded  institutions  like  schools  and  hospitals)  and  improve  the \ndesign of subsequent subprojects. \n \nReadily  available  debt  is  often  the  key  barrier  for  energy  users \nwanting  to  use  energy  efficiency  technologies  for  retrofitting;  this \nis  the  case  in  Guangdong.  Such  investments  are  different  from \ntraditional  infrastructure  project  financing,  as  (i)  retrofits  involve \nnumerous  relatively  small  investments  (subprojects)  with  short \nimplementation  periods  of  a  few  months;  (ii)  end  users  do  not \nexpand  production  or  develop  new  products,  i.e.,  no  additional \nrevenue; (iii) commercial banks lack the understanding of energy \nefficiency  technologies  and  benefits;  and  (iv)  the  payback  period \nof  subprojects  is  shorter  (generally  less  than  5  years).  In \nconsideration  of  these  characteristics,  use  of  the  FIL  modality  is \nproposed,  with  simplified  subproject  approval,  strengthened \nimplementation supervision, and the required flexibility to GPG for \nquicker  turnaround  of  EPP  activities.  Given  the  numerous  small \nprocurement, \nsubprojects,  ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement,  and  subproject  approval  will  not  be  necessary \nunder the FIL modality. Further, a FIL will allow ADB loan funds to \nbe  rolled  over  for  new  subprojects  as  each  batch  of  subloans  is \nrepaid, thus creating additional energy savings.  \n \nCurrently, the PRC has the second largest energy demand in the \nworld; it is projected to become the largest energy consumer soon \nafter 2010. Approximately, 63% of the primary energy demand is \nmet  by  coal,  and  82%  of  electricity  is  generated  from  coal. \nAlthough  the  country  has  traditionally  been  self-sufficient  in \nenergy,  the  massive  increase  in  internal  demand  has  resulted  in \nincreased reliance on imported energy. \n \n\nsupervision \n\ndirect \n\nof \n\nii \n\n \n \n\nMultitranche Financing \nFacility \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\niii\n\nIt \n\nresource  endowments. \n\nThe  high  share  of  coal-fired  power  generation  results  in  serious \nenvironmental  issues  and  accounts  for  about  50%  of  the  PRC\u2019s \nsulfur  dioxide  emissions  and  80%  of  nitrogen  oxide  emissions\u2014\nboth  pollutants  result  in  acid  rain  that  falls  on  one  third  of  the \ncountry. Approximately, 48% of cities fail to meet the national air \nquality  standards.  Carbon  dioxide  emissions \nfrom  power \ngeneration  account  for  26%  of  the  greenhouse  gas  emitted  from \nthe  PRC.  The  PRC  currently  accounts  for  5.1%  of  global  carbon \nemissions;  this  is  estimated  to  increase  to  28%  by  2030.  Rapid \nimplementation  of  energy  conservation  measures, \nincluding \nimplementation of EPPs, will lower the burden for later addressing \nthe consequence of carbon emission and climate change. \n \nGuangdong has the largest and fastest-growing economy among \nall  the  PRC  provinces;  its  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  has \ngrown  at  14%  per  annum  since  1995.  Electricity  consumption  is \ndominated by energy-intensive heavy industries, with the industry \nand  manufacturing  sectors  combined  representing  about  73%  of \ntotal electricity use. The total installed power generation capacity \nwas  59.3  gigawatts  in  2007.  The  province  has  relatively  low \nimports  100%  of  coal \nnatural \nrequirements  and  80%  of  oil  needs;  approximately  20%  of \nelectricity is imported from other provinces. The demand for power \nhas  outpaced  supply  and  power  shortages  have  been \nexperienced during the summer peak periods. More than 75% of \nthe  generation  capacity  is  from  coal-fired  power  plants,  which \nhave  caused  serious  air  pollution.  The  energy  intensity  of \nGuangdong\u2019s  economy  is  relatively  low  compared  with  other \nprovinces  in  the  PRC,  however,  it  is  high  by  international \nstandards\u2014about  3.4  times  the  average  of  member  countries  of \nthe  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development  in \n2006.  Improving  energy  efficiency  is  a  high  priority  for  GPG  to \nhelp  address  both  energy  security  and  environmental  issues. \nGuangdong  also  provides  a  good  setting  to  pilot  the  EPP  model \nbecause of its vibrant economy and the large impact that energy \nsavings will have in comparison with less industrialized provinces. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Investment  Program  will  be  improved  energy \nsecurity  and  environmental  conditions \nin  Guangdong.  The \noutcome  will  be  improved  energy  efficiency  in  the  industry  and \ncommercial sectors. The outputs will be (i) establishment of an on-\nlending  model  that  will  enable  an  EPP  to  be  developed  with \nannual  532  gigawatt-hours  of  energy  savings  and  an  equivalent \n107  megawatt  capacity,  (ii)  development  of  the  energy  service \ncompany  sector  in  Guangdong,  (iii)  development  of  capacity  for \nthe promotion and assessment of energy efficiency projects, and \n(iv) replication of the EPP model in other provinces. \n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n \n\nInvestment Plan  \n\nThe cost of the Investment Program is estimated at $142 million.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nItem \nA. \nB. \nC. \n  \nSources: Guangdong provincial government and Asian Development \nBank estimates. \n\n  \nTranche 1 \nSubsequent Tranches \nImplementation Cost \nTotal \n\n($ million) \nCost \n 44.2 \n 83.8 \n 14.0 \n142.0 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n($ million)\nTotal  \n\n35.00\n65.00\n100.00\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n\nSource \nA.

The  Government  and  GPG  were \nthat \napproval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  does \nnot commit ADB to finance any of the proposed subprojects.  \n \nThe  last  financing  tranche  should  be  executed  by  30  June  2010 \nand disbursed by 31 December 2012. Each loan may be onlent to \nnew subborrowers as subloans are repaid until the ADB loans are \nrepaid in full. \n \nGPG  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  overall \nimplementation of the Investment Program. GPG has established \nthe  EPP-PMO  to  implement  the  EPP;  GFTC  will  be  the  financial \nintermediary  to  onlend  to  subborrowers.  The  EPP  Steering \nCommittee  will  provide  policy  direction  and  operating  guidance, \nand approve subloans. If GFTC and the EPP-PMO have differing \nopinions on the qualification of subloan applications, the steering \ncommittee  will  make  the  final  decision.  The  EPP-PMO  will  be \nresponsible  for  (i)  marketing  and  promoting  EPP;  (ii)  reviewing \nthe \nand  assessing  EPP  subproject  applications  based  on \nselection  criteria  and  approval  process  for  subprojects;  (iii) \noverseeing  implementation  of  subprojects;  (iv)  measuring  and \nverifying energy savings of completed subprojects; and (v) overall \nmonitoring, managing, and reporting for the Investment Program. \nThird  party  consultants  may  be  hired  to  (i)  perform  independent \nmeasurement and evaluation of EPP energy savings, (ii) assist in \nsupervising  subproject  implementation,  and  (iii)  help  with  clean \ndevelopment  mechanism  document  preparation  and  verification \nactivities. \n \nGFTC will be responsible for (i) assessing the financial capacity of \nthe  subprojects, \nfinancial  viability  of \nsubborrowers  and \n(ii)  disbursing  funds  and  administering  the  subloan  portfolio, \n(iii) managing the trust account, (iv) managing subloan collaterals \nand  guarantees, \ntaking  necessary  action  against \nnonperforming  loans,  and  (vi)  ensuring  that  the  accounts  are \naudited yearly. \n \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n\ffor \n\nrules \n\nfinancial \n\nis  overseen  by \n\nrelevant  procurement \n\nThe Investment Program design is innovative, wherein onlending \nis  through  a  financial  intermediary  and  implementation  of  EPP \nsubprojects \nthe  EPP-PMO.  The  approach \nconsiders  sustainability  and  replicability  of  the  EPP  model,  and \ntakes  into  account  the  current  barriers  of  the  energy  efficiency \nmarket  in  Guangdong.  Successful  EPP  implementation  requires \neffective  management  of \nfinancial  and  project  aspects; \ninvolvement  of  GFTC  and  EPP-PMO  addresses  both  these \nrequirements and their strengths are complementary. \n \nProcurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Subborrowers  will  be  required  to \nin  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nfollow \nGuidelines \nintermediary  and  adopt  appropriate \nprocurement  procedures  which  will  include  (i) reasonable  prices, \nand  (ii)  fair  canvassing  when  selecting  suppliers.  Procurement \nmust  be  from  ADB  member  countries.  Subborrowers  will  be \nencouraged  to  procure  goods  through  competitive  bidding  and \nshopping  when  such  procedures  are  applicable  in  the  interest  of \neconomy  and  efficiency.  In  case  of  noncompliance,  GFTC  will \nexercise the right to recall the subloan. \n \nThe  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  concludes \nthat  the  Investment  Program  will  provide  an  overall  benefit  to \nenvironmental  conditions  in  Guangdong.  Regional  air  quality  will \nimprove  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions  will  be  lowered  as  the \nneed  for  coal-fired  power  generation  will  be  reduced.  The \nenvironmental  benefits  include  the  reduction  of  coal  use  by \n175,813  tons/year  (t/y);  and  the  reduction  of  emission  of  total \nsuspended  particulates  by  1,785  t/y,  sulfur  dioxide  by  4,795  t/y; \nnitrogen  oxide  by  1,066  t/y,  and  carbon  dioxide  by  415,560  t/y. \nBased  on  a  methodology  in  ADB\u2019s  Workbook  on  Economic \nEvaluation  of  Environmental  Impacts,  the  total  economic  net \npresent value of tranche 1 subprojects with environmental benefits \nis estimated to be about $21.9 million compared with $14.1 million \nwithout environmental benefits. \n \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nvi \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions \n\n \nGrant Assistance \n\n \n \n\n \n\nvii\n\nthe \n\nfinancial \n\nfees  of \n\nto  be  part  of \n\ntrust  management \n\nThe  PRC  places  high  importance  on  energy  efficiency  in  its \n11th  Five-Year  Plan,  and  benefits  from  the  Investment  Program \nwill ensue as long as the Government and GPG continue to make \nthis a priority. Technical risks are addressed by ensuring that the \nsubprojects  will  use  only  proven  technology.  The  amount  of \nenergy savings that can be achieved is dependent on the number \nand  magnitude  of  subborrowers  willing \nthe \nInvestment  Program.  The  EPP-PMO  will  undertake  marketing \ncampaigns to inform potential participants. Subloan repayment is \na  risk;  it  will  be  kept  low  by  ensuring  that  subborrowers  have  a \npositive  cash  flow  from  energy  savings,  i.e.,  the  repayment \ninstallments  are  lower  than  the  reduction  in  monthly  energy  bills. \nGFTC  will  constantly  monitor  the  repayments  and  make  suitable \ninterventions  to  recover  the  subloans,  when  required.  GPG  will \nestablish  an  energy  efficiency  fund  in  2008  to  provide  for  the \nimplementation support costs of the Investment Program, such as, \nintermediary, \nthe \nindependent measurement and verification of energy savings from \nsubprojects, financial incentives to attract more EPP subprojects, \napplication costs associated with clean development mechanism, \ncapacity  building,  information  dissemination,  and  provision  for \nsubloan default. \n \nGrant  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $2  million  from \nthe  Clean  Energy  Fund  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing \nPartnership  Facility  is  proposed  to  provide  capacity  building \nassistance  for  (i)  module  1:  information  sharing,  training  of \ntrainers, and development of tools; (ii) module 2: appraisal of EPP \napplications,  monitoring  of  implementation  and  evaluation  of \nenergy  savings;  and  (iii)  module  3:  evaluation  of  EPP  potential, \nbarriers,  new  technologies,  and  estimation  and  projection  of \nenergy  savings.  The  initial  amount,  based  on  available  donor \ncontributions, will be for $800,000.

The design and monitoring framework for the MFF is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \nThe PRC has achieved and sustained impressive economic growth averaging 9.5% for \n2. \nthe past two decades. It now accounts for 15% of the global economy, up from 3% in 1980. By \n2010, the economy is expected to double from its 2000 level, and quadruple by 2020. Given the \nprojected  growth,  demand  for  energy  and  in  particular  electricity  is  expected  to  continue \nincreasing rapidly. Per capita electricity consumption has risen dramatically, increasing from 340 \nkilowatt-hours (kWh) in 1983 to 1,840 kWh in 2005. Currently, the PRC has the second largest \nenergy demand in the world, and is projected to overtake the United States soon after 2010. By \n2030, the PRC is expected to account for 20% of global energy demand.1 \n  \n3. \nThe current growth in the PRC\u2019s power generation capacity is unprecedented. Installed \npower generation capacity increased at an annual average of more than 8% during the past two \ndecades.  Since  2000,  the  annual  growth  of  electricity  consumption  has  been  about  13%.  In \n2006 alone, 114 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity was installed, equivalent to the entire installed \ncapacity  in  Africa  and  a  record  annual  increase  for  any  country.  An  additional  91  GW  new \ncapacity was added in 2007. The rapid addition of generation capacity has still not fully met the \nsurging  electricity  demand;  since  2002,  more  than  half  of  the  provinces  have  had  to  curtail \npower  supplies  during  the  summer  peak  periods.  PRC  electricity  demand  increased  from  259 \nterawatt-hours (TWh) in 1980 to about 3,250 TWh in 2007, and is projected to increase to 7,230 \nTWh by 2030. \n \n4. \nApproximately 69% of the PRC's primary energy demand is met from coal, and 83% of \nelectricity  is  generated  from  coal.  The  PRC  has  the  third  largest  proven  coal  reserves  in  the \nworld. It is the world\u2019s largest coal producer and consumer. Coal production accounted for 38% \nof  global  production  in  2005,  and  is  projected  to  increase  to  49%  by  2030.  Coal  demand \nincreased from 447 million tons of coal equivalent (tce) in 1980 to 1,563 million tce in 2005, and \nis  projected  to  increase  to  3,462  million  tce  by  2030.  Coal-fired  power  generation,  using \nconventional  power  generation  technology, 2  results  in  serious  environmental  issues  and \naccounts  for  about  50%  of  the  nation\u2019s  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2)  emissions,  80%  of  nitrogen  oxide \n(NOx)  emissions,  and  26%  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions.  Acid  rain,  caused  primarily  by \nSO2 and NOx, falls on one third of the country. Approximately, 48% of the cities fail to meet the \nnational air quality standards,3 and the country is projected to become the world\u2019s largest emitter \n                                                 \n1   Projections  of  energy  demand,  electricity  consumption,  carbon  emissions,  and  energy  intensity  are  taken  from \n\nvarious reports published by the International Energy Agency, including World Energy Outlook, 2007. \n\n2   The  most  common  conventional  power  generation  technology  is  based  on  steam  turbines  with  subcritical \nparameters and pulverized coal-fired boilers. The \u201ccritical\u201d parameter is 22.1 megapascals, or about 218 times the \nstandard  atmospheric  pressure,  when  water  changes  directly  from  liquid  to  the  steam  phase  with  the  addition  of \nenergy.  Modern  power  plants  based  on  \u201csupercritical\u201d  or  \u201cultrasupercritical\u201d  parameters  have  considerably  higher \ntransformation efficiency so require less coal input and consequently have lower emission of pollutants and CO2. \n3   World  Bank.  2007.

The PRC currently accounts for 5.1% of global carbon emissions; \nthis is estimated to increase to 28% by 2030. \n \n5. \nThe PRC has traditionally been self-sufficient in energy. However, the rapid increase in \ninternal  demand  has  increased  the  reliance  on  imported  energy,  and  since  the  quantities  are \nsignificant  in  terms  of  international  energy  trade,  it  is  impacting  energy  security.  The  PRC  is \nanticipated to become a net importer of coal in 2007, with imports increasing to 132 million tce \nby 2015, representing 10% of the world\u2019s coal trade. Declining domestic oil reserves will result in \nsurging imports, from 3.5 million barrels per day in 2006 to an estimated 13.1 million barrels per day \nin  2030.  Imported  oil  is  projected  to  increase  from  49%  of  primary  oil  demand  in  2005  to  65%  in \n2015, rising to 79% by 2030. The PRC is currently self-sufficient in natural gas; however, by 2015, it \nis anticipated to import about 22% of the supply, rising to 54% by 2030. \n \nImproving  energy  efficiency  of  the  economy  is  a  crucial  response  to  reducing  the \n6. \nenvironmental and energy security impacts resulting from the rapidly increasing energy demand \nand  associated  increases  in  power  generation  capacity.  Between  2002  and  2005,  industrial \nvalue  added  grew  by  12%  per  year,  while  energy  consumption  grew  by  15.9%.  The  surge  in \nenergy  demand  has  been  largely  driven  by  the  industry  sector.  Energy  consumption  by  the \nsector increased from 36% of total consumption in 1990 to 42% in 2005, which is substantially \nhigher than the 29% average of member countries of the Organization of Economic Cooperation \nand  Development.  Compared  with  international  standards,  the  energy  intensity  of  the  PRC \neconomy  is  relatively  high  at  9.18  tce  per  $10,000  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  (2006), \ncompared with 2.47 tce for the United States and 1.52 tce for Japan. \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Problems and Constraints \n\n \n7. \nGuangdong province is located in the south of the PRC, with an area of 179,757 square \nkilometers. Its population has been growing at an annual rate of about 2.2% since 1995 and is \nabout 92 million (2005). It has the largest and fastest-growing economy of all the provinces; its \nGDP has grown at a rate of 14% per annum since 1995, significantly higher than the national \naverage.  Its  GDP  was  CNY2.24  trillion  in  2005,  representing  approximately  one  eighth  of  the \nnation\u2019s  total  GDP.  Guangdong\u2019s  industry  sector  is  export  orientated  and  represents  32%  of \nnational  exports.  An  analysis  of  the  provincial  power  subsector  is  in  Appendix  2.  Electricity \nconsumption is dominated by energy-intensive heavy industries including cement, iron and steel, \npetrochemical,  chemical,  clay  and  porcelain,  glass,  paper  and  paper  products,  metals,  textiles \nand  other  manufacturing  industries.  The  industry  and  manufacturing  sectors  combined \nrepresent  about  73%  of  total  electricity  use;  residential  consumption  is  about  13%;  and  the \nremaining 14% is for transport, construction, farming, and others. \n \nBy  the  end  of  2007,  Guangdong\u2019s  total  installed  generation  capacity  was  59.3  GW, \n8. \nwhich is greater than the installed generation capacity of all but 13 countries of the world. It has \nrelatively low natural resource endowments, and imports 100% of its coal requirements, 80% of \noil needs, and approximately 20% of electricity from other provinces. The demand for power has \nbeen  growing  at  13%  annually  since  1995,  outpacing  capacity  addition.  The  fast  growth  in \npower demand is expected to continue reflecting rapid expansion of the economy. Since 2002, \nGuangdong  has  experienced  severe  power  shortages  during  the  summer  peak  periods,  and \nhad to curtail power supply to many industrial consumers. The estimated power shortage in the \nsummer  of  2007  was  about  6.3  GW.  About  75%  of  the  generation  capacity  in  the  province  is \nfrom coal-fired power plants, which has caused serious air pollution. About 86% of the province \nexperienced acid rain in 2005; and since 2000, most of Guangdong\u2019s large cities have had an \n\n \n\n\fImprovements \n\nincrease in the number of days when the ambient air quality failed to meet national air quality \nstandards. The energy intensity of Guangdong\u2019s economy is relatively low compared with other \nprovinces in the PRC; however, it is high by international standards. In 2006, energy intensity \nwas  5.87  tce  per  $10,000  GDP,  which  was  3.4  times  the average  of  member  countries  of  the \nOrganization of Economic Cooperation and Development, 3.9 times that of Japan, and 2.4 times \nthat of the United States. \n \n9. \nImprovements  to  the  energy  efficiency  of  the  Guangdong  industry  sector  will  lower \nenergy  consumption  and  the  need  for  additional  power  generation  capacity,  thereby  reducing \nadverse  environmental  impacts  and  intermittent  energy  shortages,  and  improving  energy \nsecurity. \nlower  energy \nconsumption at a significantly lower economic, environmental, and social cost than installation \nof additional generation capacity. Improved energy efficiency also lowers end users\u2019 electricity \nbills,  improves  production  efficiency,  and  enhances  competitiveness.  Key  constraints  to \nimproving energy efficiency include (i) limited access to low-cost, long-term capital for utilizing \nenergy  efficiency  technologies;  (ii)  lack  of  awareness  among  industry  managers  and  officials \nabout  the  benefits  of  energy  efficiency  technologies;  (iii)  agency  issues,  such  as,  shared \nincentives  for  owners  and  tenants  of  buildings;  and  (iv)  weak  supply  chain  of  energy  efficient \nproducts  due  to  low  volumes  (demand)  and  thus  higher  unit  prices.  These  barriers  severely \nconstrain  private  sector  participation \nthe \ndevelopment of energy service companies (ESCOs), which have generally been highly effective \nin delivering energy efficiency benefits to industry in industrialized countries. \n \n\nin  energy  efficiency  present \n\ninvestments,  particularly \n\nin  energy  efficiency \n\nthe  opportunity \n\nto \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\n \nDue to the relatively large size of the Guangdong economy and its  underinvestment in \n10. \nenergy  efficiency,  the  potential  for  energy  efficiency  improvement  is  large.  During  the  next  15 \nyears,  its  power  subsector  has  an  estimated  cost-effective  energy  efficiency  improvement \npotential of 17 GW (32% of current installed generation capacity) and 41 TWh per annum.4 This \npotential can be realized at less than half the cost of construction and generation from coal-fired \nconventional  power  plants.  In  aggregate,  investment  in  a  broad  range  of  energy  efficiency \ntechnologies  will  lower  energy  demand  in  sufficient  quantities  to  displace  the  requirement  to \nconstruct conventional power plants. The aggregated energy efficiency investment is, therefore, \nreferred  to  as  an  efficiency  power  plant  (EPP)  with  the  equivalent  displaced  capacity  in  MW \nterms, although the efficient equipment is installed in the premises of many consumers. \n \n11. \nPower  subsector  analysis  indicates  that  projects  focusing  on  retrofitting  of  energy-\nintensive  facilities  at  existing  industrial  and  commercial  establishments  are  the  most  cost-\neffective  areas \nfor  retrofit  efficiency \ninvestments  exist  for  motors,  transformers,  lighting,  air  conditioning,  etc.  Improvement  in  the \nefficiency  of  energy  consumption,  as  seen  from  international  experience,  has  two  significant \nbenefits: (i) less primary energy supply will be needed for economic growth, which strengthens \nenergy security; and (ii) less fossil fuel will be used, which will lower pollution and greenhouse \ngas  emission.  A  MW  of  avoided  power  generation  capacity  reduces  the  investment  in  energy \nsupply by more than $2 million, and every megawatt-hour saving will avoid 330 kilogram (kg) of \ncoal  consumption;  and  emissions  of  780  kg  of  CO2,  9  kg  of  SO2,  3.4  kg  of  total  suspended \n                                                 \n4  Asian Development Bank. 2005.

Draft  Final  Report,  July  2007. \nEnergy  efficiency  improvement  potential  is  not  the  same  as  energy-saving  potential.  The  former  is  achieved  by \nusing  more  efficient  equipment  and  can  be  measured  and  monitored,  it  does  not  reduce  output  service,  for \nexample,  using  compact  fluorescent  lamps  for  lighting.  The  latter,  however,  generally  depends  on  behavioral \nchanges and often leads to foregone service, for example, switching off lights when not needed. \n\nimprovement.

Investment in energy efficiency allows a rapid reduction \nin  energy  demand,  which  is  particularly  important  for  provincial  energy  planning  and \nmanagement.  An  energy  efficiency  project  can  save  energy  in  a  shorter  time  frame  (a  few \nmonths) than construction of equivalent capacity conventional power plants (typically 2\u20134 years). \nIt,  therefore,  provides  provincial  energy  planners  a  useful  energy  supply  development \nalternative. \n \n12. \nThe  establishment  of  the  energy  efficiency  industry  in  Guangdong  largely  depends  on \nthe  development  of  private  sector  ESCOs  and  high-efficiency  equipment  manufacturers  and \ndistributors that assist industrial and other consumers improve energy efficiency at their facilities. \nESCOs  typically  assist  consumers  through  a  shared  savings  contract,  wherein  they  initially \nfinance  energy  efficiency  equipment  and  recover  their  investment  from  the  savings  in \nconsumers\u2019 electricity bills. This model has been adopted internationally; however, the PRC has \na number of persistent barriers including low capitalization of ESCOs and lack of access to debt \nfrom local banks. The small but developing ESCO industry in Guangdong can expand into a full \nenergy service industry after removal of barriers. \n \n\n3. \n\nStrategies of the Government and Asian Development Bank \n\n \n13. \nThe Government has implemented significant reforms in the energy sector. The national \nenergy  enterprises  have  autonomy  for  investment  decisions.  Coal  prices  are  being  gradually \nderegulated;  only  some  of  the  coal  used  for  power  generation  is  now  administratively  priced. \nThe power subsector was unbundled in 2003 with the creation of five national and several jointly \nowned  provincial  power  generation  companies,  along  with  two  power  transmission  and \ndistribution  companies  that  have  provincial  subsidiaries  for  satisfying  consumer  demand.  The \nindependent State Electricity Regulatory Commission now has a presence in all provinces. The \nNational  Development  and  Reform  Commission  regulates  the  retail  electricity  tariff.  The \ncountrywide  average  retail  tariff  in  2006  was  CNY0.505/kWh  ($0.0656/kWh);  in  Guangdong  it \nwas CNY0.682/kWh ($0.0886/kWh), the highest among all provinces. Time-of-day tariff, which \nleads  to  greater  utilization  of  generation  assets,  is  being  used  in  most  provinces  for  industrial \nconsumers,  including  Guangdong.  The  tariff  for  industrial  (manufacturing)  consumers  in \nGuangdong is $0.1/kWh and for commercial consumers $0.12/kWh, which is high in comparison \nwith large consumers in industrialized countries and higher than the other provinces. However it \nsends a strong signal for improving energy efficiency. \n \n14. \nThe Government of the PRC prioritizes energy efficiency and environmental protection in \nthe  11th  Five-Year  National  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  (11FYP).  It  includes  obligatory  targets  of \nimproving energy intensity by 20%5 and reducing major pollutants by 10%, including SO2, which \nis  emitted  mostly  by  coal-fired  power  plants.  Energy  intensity  reduced  by  1.23%  in  2006  and \n3.7%  in  2007,  indicating  that  larger reductions will  be needed  during the  remaining  3  years  of \nthe  11FYP.    Since  announcement  of  the  targets,  the  State  Council  issued  a  number  of \nguidelines  and  plans  to  strengthen  the  nation\u2019s  efforts  on  energy  efficiency  improvement  and \npollutant  reduction.  The  recently  amended  Energy  Conservation  Law  became  effective  on  1 \nApril 2008. \n \n15. \nThe  11FYP  targets  have  been  reallocated  to  the  provinces.  Guangdong  has  targets  of \nimproving  energy  efficiency  by  16%  and  reducing  SO2  emissions  by  15%  by  2010.  The \nGuangdong  provincial  government  (GPG)  recently  issued  a  series  of  separate  strategies  to \n\n                                                 \n5  Energy  intensity  is  the  measure  of  energy  input  per  unit  of  output,  with  output  measured  in  financial  or  physical \nterms. Energy efficiency improves when less energy is consumed per unit of output. The elasticity ratio of energy \nconsumption is the ratio of the increase in energy consumption to the growth of GDP.  \n\n \n\n\fsupport the proposed energy efficiency and pollutant reduction targets.6 A policy framework was \nestablished for energy efficiency improvement and pollutant reduction in key sectors including (i) \nenergy-intensive manufacturing industries, (ii) commercial and government facilities, (iii) building \nconstruction,  (iv)  electric  equipment  manufacturing,  and  (iv)  transportation.  The  policy \nframework  also  allows  for  improved  compliance  and  encouragement  of  local  financial \ninstitutions  to  support  energy  efficiency  improvement  and  pollutant  reduction  projects.  The \nGuangdong  Energy  Conservation  and  Pollutants  Reduction  Plan  specifically  requires  GPG  to  \n(i)  expedite  the  pilot  testing  of  EPP  projects  and  promote  implementation  of  EPP  subprojects, \nand  (ii)  develop  a  strong  ESCO  industry.  GPG  views  the  Investment  Program  as  an  integral \ncomponent of the provincial strategy to achieve the 11FYP energy intensity target. A summary \nof the GPG policy framework is attached to the framework financing agreement (Schedule 1 \u2013 \nRoad Map and Investment Program). \n \nThe proposed Investment Program is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \n16. \n(i)  Medium-Term  Strategy  II,  2006\u20132008  strategic  priority  of  managing  the  environment,  and  \n(ii)  the  strategic  development  objectives  of  the  country  strategy  and  program  for  sustainable \ndevelopment  of  energy  and  economic  growth. 7 It  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  energy  sector \npolicies. 8 ADB  has  been  actively  supporting  policy  reforms  and  the  development  of  energy \nefficiency  projects  in  the  PRC,  including  a  number  of  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects  for \npolicy  reforms 9  and  recent  inputs  for  designing  the  Investment  Program. 10  In  2005,  ADB \n\n                                                 \n6  Guangdong  Electricity  Demand  Side  Management \n\nImplementation  Plan,  20  November  2006;  Plan  on \nStrengthening  Energy  Conservation  Effort  in  Guangdong,  22  November  2006;  Guangdong  Provincial  Mid-  and \nLong-Term  Energy  Conservation  Plan,  5  June  2007;  Guangdong  Comprehensive  Energy  Conservation  and \nPollutants Reduction Plan, 19 July 2007. \n\n7   ADB. 2006.

Manila (TA 6392-REG, approved on 30 March, for $2,300,000).  \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nlaunched  the  Energy  Efficiency  Initiative,  which  supports  energy  efficiency  and  renewable \nenergy projects through a range of innovative grant and financing mechanisms. \n \n\n4. \n\nLessons  \n\n \nADB\u2019s experience in the PRC\u2019s energy sector indicates that projects are generally well \n17. \nplanned and implemented smoothly. The overall implementation performance of ADB\u2019s energy \nportfolio  is  satisfactory  (Appendix  3).  Several  lessons  from  previous  financial  intermediation \nloans (FILs) and project loans relate to innovative financing of energy projects. First, to capture \nthe  small-scale  segment  of  the  energy  efficiency  market,  typically  overlooked  by  financial \ninstitutions,  ESCOs  must  be  developed;  they  are  currently  limited  in  their  capacity  to  serve \nconsumers by their access to capital. Therefore, the Investment Program will extend loans for \nthe emerging ESCO industry in Guangdong. This is consistent with the initial findings of three \nongoing  country  studies\u2014Brazil,  PRC,  and  India\u2014being  implemented  by  the  World  Bank  and \nUnited Nations Environment Programme. \n \nSecond,  some  projects  encountered  difficulty  in  adequately  verifying  actual  energy \n18. \nefficiency  improvements;  this  detracts  from  demonstrating  project  benefits.  The  Investment \nProgram  includes  an  independent  postinstallation  verification  and  monitoring  component  to \ncapture  the  project  benefits.  Third,  some  FILs  encountered  implementation  difficulties  due  to \nlack  of  technical  capacity  in  project  identification  and  assessment  within  the  financial \nintermediary. This issue will be addressed by the EPP Project Management Office (EPP-PMO) \nproviding technical support. Fourth, some demonstration projects have not been replicated. The \nInvestment Program will improve the probability of replication by providing targeted support for \nESCOs  and  working  with  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  to  widely \ndisseminate lessons and propose the EPP model to other provinces.  \n \n19. \nOther  approaches  for  reducing  energy  demand  are  being  designed.  The  Energy \nEfficiency  Multi-Project  Financing  Program  prepared  by  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment in 2007 has a guarantee mechanism for domestic banks when a preselected ESCO \nprovides the technical services for improving energy efficiency in buildings. The World Bank is \npreparing  a  normal  FIL,  which  includes  capacity  building  input  from  the  Global  Environment \nFacility;  and  another  private  sector  proposal  extends  guarantees  for  loans  offered  by  partner \ndomestic  banks  to  utility  companies  to  help  consumers  improve  their  efficiency  of  gas  and \ndistrict heat use. Considering the extremely large potential for improving energy efficiency in the \nPRC, pilot implementation of various approaches is justified. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\n \n20. \nThe  Investment  Program  is  to  finance,  for  up  to  $100  million,  an  EPP  investment  in \nGuangdong province equivalent to 107 megawatt (MW). Appendix 4 provides a summary of the \nestimated  energy  (in  terms  of  megawatt-hours)  and  demand  (MW)  savings  for  the  nine \nsubprojects  included  in  the  first  financing  tranche  and  the  Investment  Program.  The  energy \nsavings  will  result  from  retrofitting  existing  equipment  with  more  efficient  equipment,  which  in \naggregate  will  reduce  the  need  to  construct  and  operate  an  equivalent  coal-fired  conventional \npower plant. The proposed Guangdong EPP will be the first of its kind in the PRC. It requires \ndesigning  a  suitable  model  as  a  pilot  in  Guangdong  that  can  be  scaled  up  and  replicated  in \nother high energy consuming provinces.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nA. \n \n21. \nThe  impact  of  the  Investment  Program  will  be  improved  energy  security  and \nenvironmental  conditions  in  Guangdong.  The  outcome  will  be  an  improvement  in  energy \nefficiency in industry and commercial sectors in Guangdong. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nThe outputs include (i) establishment of an onlending model that will enable an EPP to \nbe  developed  with  annual  532  gigawatt-hours  of  energy  savings  and  an  equivalent  107  MW \ncapacity,  (ii)  development  of  the  ESCO  sector  in  Guangdong,  (iii)  development  of  capacity  for \npromoting  and  assessing  energy  efficiency  projects,  and  (iv)  replication  of  the  EPP  model  in \nother provinces. Implementation of the EPP will avoid consumption of 175,813 tons/year (t/y) of \ncoal,  resulting  in  emission  reductions  of  415,560  t/y  of  CO2,  1,785  t/y  of  total  suspended \nparticulates, 4,795 t/y of SO2, and 1,066 t/y of NOx. Postinstallation verification and monitoring \nwill be carried out by a third party to ensure energy savings are achieved. \n \nC. \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nBenefits of the FIL Modality \n\nfor  example,  (i)  retrofits \n\ninvolve  numerous  relatively  small \n\n \n23. \nReadily  available  debt  is  often  the  key  barrier  for  energy  users  wanting  to  use  energy \nefficiency technologies for retrofitting; this is the case in Guangdong. The characteristics of such \ninvestments  are  different  from  traditional  infrastructure  project  financing,  hence,  need  special \ninvestments \nconsideration; \n(subprojects) with short implementation periods of a few months; (ii) end users11 do not expand \nproduction or develop new products, i.e., no additional revenue; (iii) commercial banks lack the \nunderstanding  of  energy  efficiency  technologies  and  benefits;  and  (iv)  the  payback  period  of \nsubprojects  is  shorter  (generally  less  than  5  years).  Despite  the  benefits,  energy  users  are \ndisinclined  to  seek  loans  to  retrofit  energy  efficient  equipment  and  prefer  to  obtain  capital  for \nexpansion  and  new  business.  In  consideration  of  these  characteristics,  the  use  of  the  FIL \nmodality  is  proposed  with  strengthened  implementation  supervision,  and  simplified  subproject \nappraisal giving GPG the required flexibility for quicker turnaround of EPP activities. Given the \nnumerous  small  subprojects,  ADB\u2019s  direct  supervision  of  procurement,  disbursement,  and \nsubproject approval will not be necessary under the FIL modality. Further, an FIL will allow ADB \nloan  funds  to  be  rolled  over  for  new  subprojects  as  each  batch  of  subloans  is  repaid,  thus \ncreating additional energy savings. \n \n24. \nThe Investment Program will finance goods and services to reduce energy consumption \nand create savings for subborrowers. The financial intermediary, in this case a registered trust \ncompany,  will  manage  the  special  purpose  trust  that  will  be  established  using  ADB  loan \nproceeds.  The  financial  intermediary  will  appraise  subproject  applications  and  onlend  to \nfinancially  viable  EPP  subprojects.  Repayments  of  subloans,  net  of  transfers  to  GPG  for \nservicing the ADB loan, will be used for further onlending. By law and under regulatory oversight, \nthe  trust  company  is  required  to  administer  the  funds  according  to  the  terms  of  the  trust \nagreement and may not commingle the funds with other trust funds. Unlike a commercial bank, \nthe  trust  account  will  be  kept  distinct  from  its  own  assets,  which  offers  protection  against \nadverse  results  from  other  financial  operations  of  the  company.  Thus,  GPG  will  be  able  to \nensure  that  ADB  loan  proceeds  are  only  used  to  implement  EPP  subprojects  and  will  not  be \n\n                                                 \n11 In this report, the term end user refers to the entity that will borrow to retrofit equipment in its own facilities; the term \nmiddle user refers to the entity that will borrow to retrofit equipment in facilities owned by other users of electricity. \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nto  assess  and  monitor \n\nexposed to other banking risks. The trust company will earn a management fee from GPG for \nthe service. \n \nADB\u2019s  Operations  Manual 12  defines  and  establishes  the  criteria  for  eligible  financial \n25. \nintermediaries that onlend funds under the FIL modality. These include: (i) financial soundness; \n(ii)  adequate  credit  and  risk  financial  management  practices;  (iii)  compliance  with  prudential \nregulations; (iv) acceptable corporate and financial management practices; (v) sound business \nobjectives  and  strategy;  (vi)  autonomy  in  lending  and  pricing  decisions;  and  (vii)  adequate \npolicies,  systems  and  procedures \nthe  economic,  social,  and \nenvironmental  impacts  of  subprojects.  In  addition,  financial  intermediaries  should  have  or \ndevelop  capacity  to  mobilize  domestic  resources.  In  the  past,  financial  intermediaries  have \nusually  been  commercial  or  development  banks  and  the  requirements  were  structured \naccordingly.  For  this  Investment  Program,  a  special  single  purpose  trust  that  supports  GPG's \nenergy efficiency program will be established and managed by a duly registered trust company, \nthe Guangdong Finance Trust Company Ltd. (GFTC). As a result, criteria (vi) and (vii) above are \nnot  applicable  to  GFTC,  and  will  be  carried  out  by  other  participating  entities.  Lending  and \npricing  decisions  will  be  made  by  GPG  as  it  bears  the  risk  of  the  project,  EPP-PMO  will \nundertake  the  requirement  in  item  (vii).  Due  diligence  of  GFTC  indicates  that  the  company  is \nfinancially sound, has adequate credit and risk management policies, acceptable corporate and \nfinancial management practices, complies with prudential regulations and has a sound business \nstrategy. Given that GFTC is neither a commercial bank nor a development financial institution, \nas has been the case in FILs in the past, the requirement to relend ADB's loan proceeds to a \nfinancial intermediary13 is not applicable; instead of relending the loan proceeds, it will be made \navailable to GFTC through a trust agreement. \n \n26.  While  GFTC  may  review  and  reject  any  subproject  that  does  not  meet  its  financial  or \ncredit  risk  thresholds,  it  will  not  have  autonomy  to  set  the  interest  rate,  as  the  Investment \nProgram is designed to promote investment in energy efficiency technologies which may include \nincentives. Rather, GFTC\u2019s revenue will be derived from management fees and its interest will \nbe protected through the trust agreement. The current barriers to borrowing for EPP subprojects \nhave  prevented  the  establishment  of  a  benchmark  interest  rate  for  such  loans  from  domestic \nbanks.  However,  the  trust  agreement  with  GPG  will  allow  GFTC  to  keep  the  term  of  the \nsubloans as 5 years to match the payback period of the subprojects. The interest rate will be set \nwithin  the  allowable  band  of  the  6-month  interest  rate  set  by  the  People's  Bank  of  China  for \nlending by commercial banks.14 Onlending will be restricted to EPP subprojects that satisfy the \nselection  criteria  agreed  under  the  Investment  Program  and  that  have  been  technically \nappraised by the EPP-PMO. Moreover, the selection criteria exclude lending for subprojects that \ninvolve  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement,  which  significantly  lowers  the  safeguard \nrisks. \n \n\n2. \n\nUse of the Multitranche Financing Facility \n\n \n27. \nThe success of this pilot EPP Investment Program will depend on how quickly barriers \ncan  be  lowered  and  necessary  investments  are  made  by  end  users.  An  MFF  is  proposed  to \nenable  GPG  to  increase  the  awareness  of  EPP,  recruit  appropriate  EPP  subprojects,  and \nexpand  and \nin  a  systematic  manner.  A  phased \nimplementation is planned under successive tranche loans of the MFF to manage the risk of the \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2003. Operations Manual.

(R27-87). \n14Commercial banks in PRC do no have the complete freedom to set interest rates. However, the People\u2019s Bank of \n\nInvestment  Program \n\nimplement \n\nthe \n\nChina allows interest rates to be fixed within a narrow band to reflect the credit risk of the borrower. \n\n \n\n \n\n\finnovative approach for reaching out to end users. While implementation of subprojects under \ntranche  1  is  in  progress,  the  EPP-PMO  will  seek  applications  from  other  high  impact \nsubborrowers  with  potential  for  higher  energy  savings.  The  experience  gained  during  the \nselection  and  design  of  subprojects  in  tranche  1  will  also  be  used  to  solicit  applications  from \nother  types  of  subborrowers  (e.g.,  budget-funded  institutions  like  schools  and  hospitals)  and \nimprove the technical design of subsequent subprojects. \n \n\n3. \n\nPotential Benefits from Use of the Clean Development Mechanism \n\n \nThe rigor of the subproject certification functions in the Investment Program creates an \n28. \nopportunity for the EPP-PMO to help borrowers develop the subprojects into clean development \nmechanism  (CDM)  projects  and  consolidate  them  for  registration  for  certified  emission \nreductions (CERs). The CDM is a market-based arrangement under the Kyoto Protocol allowing \nindustrialized  countries  with  greenhouse  gas  reduction  commitment  to  invest  in  projects  that \nreduce carbon emission in developing countries as an alternative to more expensive emission \nreductions in their own countries. CERs will be achieved under the Investment Program by the \navoided equivalent of coal-fired generation.  \n \n29. \nThe subprojects identified under tranche 1 have potential carbon revenue ranging from \n5% to 10% of the subprojects' total investment cost. This is a conservative estimate based on \nthe cumulative CO2 emission reductions until 2012, the end of the first commitment period under \nthe Kyoto Protocol. Once the CERs are registered, the Asia Pacific Carbon Fund administered \nby ADB under the Carbon Market Initiative can consider upfront purchase of a maximum of 50% \nof the CERs generated by 2012.15 Potential payments range from $1.2 million to $2.4 million. \n \n\n4. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\n \n30. \nESCOs  have  played  an  important  role  in  implementing  energy  efficiency  projects  in \ndeveloped  countries.  Their  business  model  requires  considerable  capital  because  the \nrepayments from end users are spread over a longer period to keep within the actual saving in \nelectricity  expenditure.  In  Guangdong  and  elsewhere  in  the  PRC,  ESCOs  are  still  a  fledgling \nindustry  due  to  limited  access  to  capital,  as  local  banks  lack  knowledge  of  energy  efficiency \nmatters  and  have  been  reluctant  to  lend  when  sales  revenues  are  not  being  increased.  The \nInvestment Program will extend a line of credit to ESCOs that they can draw upon for installing \nefficient  equipment  in  their  client\u2019s  premises  and  recover  their  cost  over  the  duration  of  the \nsubloan. It will thereby demonstrate a model for appropriately assessing financial and technical \nrisks,  monitoring  implementation  and  evaluating  savings  that  local  banks  can  use  to  support \nprivate sector ESCOs and end users\u2019 EPP subprojects. \n \n\n5. \n\nReplicability \n\n \nThe  simplified  onlending,  application  assessment,  and  procurement  procedures \n31. \nproposed under the Investment Program are designed to facilitate participation of a wide variety \nof  EPP  subprojects.  At  the  same  time,  it  will  have  a  stronger  mechanism  for  supervision  of \nimplementation and evaluation of results through the EPP-PMO, and third party measurement \nand  verification  of  results.  In  cases  where  subprojects  result  in  a  lower  saving,  the  EPP-PMO \nwill have the responsibility to (i) engage other end users to take subloans and implement EPP \nsubprojects,  and/or  (ii)  tighten  the  technical  eligibility  criteria  for  subprojects  in  subsequent \ntranches.  Once  the  model  is  adopted  by  the  wide  variety  of  EPP  subborrowers,  its  scalability \n\n                                                 \n15  The proceeds from the sale of CERs cannot be commingled with the subloans. When such sales take place, part of \nthe proceeds will be transferred to the EPP-PMO in consideration of its aggregation of the small subprojects, and \nused for promoting more EPP subprojects. \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nProgram Investment Plan \n\nand  replicability  will  be  assured,  and  GPG  may  attract  other  external  resources  for  its  energy \nefficiency programs. \n \nD. \n \n32. \nincludes  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and \nimplementation.

Financing  will  be \nprovided  in  accordance  with  ADB  policy. 17 The  MFF  will  extend  multiple  loans 18 to  finance \nenergy  efficiency  subprojects  under  the  Investment  Program,  subject  to  the  submission  of  a \nrelated periodic financing request (PFR) by the Government and execution of the related loan \nand  project  agreements.  The  Government  has  entered  into  a  framework  financing  agreement \n(FFA) with ADB, and is obligated to comply with its requirements.19 The minimum amount of a \nPFR will be $20,000,000. Each PFR will be accompanied by a list of EPP subprojects identified \nfor  financing.  All  provisions  of  the  loan  regulations  applicable  to  loans  based  on  the  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)20 will  apply  to  each  loan,  subject  to  any  modifications  that  may \nbe  included  under  the  individual  loan  agreement.  The  Government  has  the  option  to  choose \nbetween  eligible  currencies  and  the  interest  rate  regime  for  each  loan.  The  specific  terms  for \neach loan will be based on the related PFR with interest rate to be determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility and the applicable commitment charge, and such other \nterms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.

GPG,  through  GFB,  will  entrust  the  loan  proceeds  to  GFTC  for  onlending  to  EPP \nsubborrowers. The interest rate will be set within the allowable band of the 6-month interest rate \nset by the People\u2019s Republic of China for lending by commercial banks. GFTC will set up a trust \naccount specifically for this purpose. GPG will bear the foreign exchange risk as it is best suited \nto  manage  the  risk  because  of  its  larger  portfolio  of  foreign-funded  investments,  and  its \nwillingness  to  support  the  Investment  Program  as  it  relates  to  public  goods,  namely,  energy \nsecurity and environmental improvement.  \n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Program Management \n\n \n36. \nGPG  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  overall  implementation  of  the \nInvestment  Program.  GPG  has  established  the  EPP-PMO  to  implement  the  energy  efficiency \nsubprojects and will entrust GFTC as the financial intermediary for the purpose of lending to the \nsubborrowers.  The  EPP  Steering  Committee  (steering  committee)  is  also  in  place  comprising \nsenior  officials  from  Guangdong  Province  Economic  and  Trade  Commission,  Guangdong \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission,  Guangdong  Finance  Bureau,  and  State  Assets \nSupervision  and  Administration  Commission.  The  committee  will  provide  policy  direction  and \noperating guidance, and approve subloans. The EPP-PMO will be responsible for nonfinancial \nand technical assessment of applications and supervision of EPP subproject implementation.  \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \nGFTC,  under  the  terms  of  a  trust  agreement  with  Guangdong  Finance  Bureau \n37. \n(representing  GPG),  will  establish  a  separate  unit  to  administer  the  trust.  Its  onlending \nresponsibilities will include assessing the financial viability of the subprojects, disbursing funds \nand managing the subloan portfolio, including subloan collateral and guarantees, and preparing \nfinancial  statements.  For  internal  control  purposes,  GFTC  maintains  segregation  of  duties  for \nthe various functions of administration, financial accounting, and legal matters. It currently has \nadequate staff for managing the tranche 1 subloan portfolio. Additional staff will be engaged, as \nnecessary,  when  the  number  of  subloans  increases.  In  the  event  that  GFTC  does  not  meet \nperformance standards to the satisfaction of ADB and GFB, or its financial health deteriorates \nsignificantly,  GPG  may,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  propose  a  new  financial  intermediary.  The \noverall Investment Program management and onlending model is presented in Appendix 6. An \nassessment  of  financial  management  of  GFTC  is  in  Appendix  7.  Details  of  the  Investment \nProgram implementation arrangement are presented in Appendix 8. \n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria \n\n \n38. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  consider  only  retrofits  of  proven  energy  efficiency \ntechnologies  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  motors  and  motor-drive  systems;  (ii)  transformers  and \nreactive  power  compensators;  (iii)  lighting;  (iv)  heating,  ventilation,  and  air  conditioning;  (v)  air \ncompressors and pumping systems; (vi) recovery of waste energy from industry; (vii) industrial \nboilers  and  industrial  cogeneration;  and  (viii)  other  related  energy  efficiency  improvement \nprojects.  \n \nThe EPP subprojects have been selected according to the criteria set out in Appendix 9. \n39. \nThe  EPP-PMO  will  apply  the  same  criteria  in  the  selection  of  subsequent  subprojects. \nSubprojects  that  involve  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  issues  will  not  be  considered.  In \nsubsequent batches of onlending, individual subloans that exceed $10 million (the free limit) will \nbe subject to prior review by and approval from ADB. For individual subloans below the free limit, \nADB reserves the right to review subproject proposals and refuse financing for any subproject \nthat does not meet the eligibility criteria or comply with ADB guidelines. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n40. \nThe Investment Program will be implemented over 5 years between 2008 and 2012. The \nmajority  of  tranche  1  loan  is  expected  to  be  disbursed  in  2008  soon  after  loan  effectiveness, \nenabling  energy  savings  and  demand  reduction  to  be  realized  from  2008.  The  PFRs  for  the \nsubsequent  tranches  are  expected  in  late  2008  and  in  2009.  The  disbursement  of  the  last \ntranche  will  be  completed  not  later  than  31  December  2012.  Onlending  to  EPP  subborrowers \nwill take place according to the implementation schedule set forth in the subproject agreement \nsigned by the EPP-PMO and the subborrowers. As subloans are repaid, the repayments, net of \ndebt  service  payments  to  ADB,  will  be  used  to  finance  further  batches  of  EPP  subprojects, \nthereby multiplying the benefits of the ADB loan. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n \n41. \nProcurement will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). Subborrowers will be required to follow the relevant procurement \nrules  in  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  for  financial  intermediaries,  and  adopt  appropriate \nprocedures  including  (i)  payment  of  reasonable  prices;  and  (ii)  fair  canvassing  when  selecting \nsuppliers. Procurement must be from ADB member countries. Subborrowers will be encouraged \nto  procure  goods  through  competitive  bidding  or  shopping  when  such  procedures  are  most \n\n \n\n\fappropriate  in  the  interest  of  economy  and  efficiency.  In  case  of  noncompliance,  GFTC  will \nexercise the right to recall the subloan. The procurement plan is in Appendix 10. \n \n42. \nDisbursements  under  each  PFR  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). The loan proceeds will be paid through GFB \nto  a  trust  account  that  will  be  set  up  upon  loan  effectiveness  of  the  first  loan  at  a  commercial \nbank  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  transfer  of  such  loan  proceeds  from  GFB  to  the  trust  account \nshould take place promptly within 5 working days from approval by the State Administration of \nForeign  Exchange  Guangdong  Branch.  The  trust  account  will  be  managed  by  GFTC.  The \nwithdrawal  request  for  any  subproject  loan  proceeds  will  be  supported  by  a  withdrawal \napplication, and certification from the GFB that the subloan and subproject agreements for the \nsubproject  have  been  executed  between  GFTC,  EPP-PMO,  and  the  related  subborrower, \nrespectively, and include terms and conditions specified in related legal agreements with ADB, \nand  are  legally  binding  upon  the  parties.  This  certification  will  be  a  condition  for  loan \ndisbursement. Additionally, each withdrawal request needs to be supported by the simultaneous \napplication  for  subloan  approval  and  withdrawal  for  subloans  not  exceeding  the  free  limit  of \n$10,000,000.00. For subloans in excess of the free limit, copies of the subloan and subproject \nagreements will be submitted together with the subloan approval and withdrawal statement. The \ndisbursements  under  each  subloan  may  be  in  several  installments  based  on  the  readiness  of \nthe subproject.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n43. \nDue  to  the  urgency  of  meeting  annual  energy  savings  targets  set  out  in  Guangdong\u2019s \n11FYP,  the  EPP-PMO  proposes  commencing  implementation  of  some  EPP  subprojects \nincluded in tranche 1 prior to ADB\u2019s approval of the Investment Program and accompanied PFR \nfor  tranche  1.  For  these  subprojects,  the  Government  has  requested  approval  of  advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing. For each loan under the MFF, GPG may request advance \ncontracting for the required energy efficient equipment, and retroactive financing of up to 20% of \nthe first loan provided such expenses were incurred in accordance with procurement practices \nacceptable to ADB. The Government has been informed that provision of advance contracting \nand procurement and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the subprojects. For \nfinancing  of  otherwise  eligible  expenditures  may  be \nsubsequent \nconsidered  and  allowed  by  ADB  Management  when  included  in  a  PFR.  Total  retroactive \nfinancing  will  not  exceed  an  amount  equivalent  to  20%  of  the  individual  loan  and  must  have \nbeen incurred not more that 12 months before the signing of the related legal agreements. \n \n\ntranches,  retroactive \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n44. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government,  GPG,  EPP-PMO,  and  GFTC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nInvestment  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998) are included in the loan regulations and bidding documents under the Investment \nProgram. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Investment Program \nshall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and \naccounts  of  the  financial  intermediary,  the  EPP-PMO,  subborrowers,  and  all  contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Investment Program. In \naddition,  the  following  characteristics  of  the  Investment  Program  promote  transparency  and \nstrengthen governance: (i) dual scrutiny of the subprojects (technical, economic, environmental, \nand  social  by  the  EPP-PMO  and  financial  by  GFTC);  (ii)  the  use  of  trust  agreement  (between \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nGFB and GFTC), and subloan and subproject agreements; and (iii) an information campaign to \nbe carried out by the EPP-PMO to inform enterprises and other large energy consumers about \nthe Investment Program and their entitlements. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n45. \nGFB,  GFTC,  the  EPP-PMO,  and  each  EPP  subborrower  will  ensure  that  proper \naccounts and records are maintained and audited in a timely manner to adequately identify the \nuse of loan proceeds. The EPP-PMO, in cooperation with GFTC, will prepare and provide ADB \nwith  quarterly  progress  reports  on  program  implementation.  These  reports  will  include  a \ndescription  of  progress  made  during  the  review  period,  problems  encountered  and  remedial \nactions taken, and subsequent activities to be undertaken. GFTC will submit quarterly financial \nreports to ADB on each subproject showing transactions during the quarter; loan defaults, if any; \nand any other relevant information. GFTC will submit its audited annual financial statements to \nADB  within  6  months  after  the  fiscal  year-end.  The  audit  report  will  include  an  opinion  on  the \nuse of the GPG account and the trust account and subloan approval and withdrawal procedures. \nThe EPP-PMO, in cooperation with GFTC, will submit a project completion report to ADB within \n6 months of physical completion of the first batch of subprojects financed under each financing \ntranche, and an investment program completion report within 6 months of physical completion of \nall  ADB-supported  activities  and  subprojects  under  the  Investment  Program,  i.e.,  after  all  the \nADB loans extended under the Investment Program are repaid.  \n \n\n8. \n\nInvestment Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nThe  investment  program  performance  and  monitoring  system  indicators  and  their \n46. \nrelevance  were  discussed  with  GPG,  EPP-PMO,  and  GFTC  during  project  preparation.  The \nindicators are based on the monitoring indicators in the design and monitoring framework. The \nEPP-PMO, in cooperation with GFTC, will ensure that within 6 months of the effective date of \nthe first loan agreement under the Investment Program, a performance and monitoring system \nis  established.  The  system  will  be  in  a  form  and  substance  acceptable  to  ADB  in  accordance \nwith the Investment Program performance indicators. The system should also include a detailed \nplan  for  measuring  and  verifying  actual  energy  savings  of  the  implemented  subprojects.  The \nEPP-PMO and GFTC will undertake periodic project performance review under each subloan, in \naccordance with the performance and monitoring system to evaluate the scope, implementation \narrangements, progress, achievements of the claimed energy savings, and other benefits of the \nprojects and the overall Investment Program. \n \n\n9. \n\nInvestment Program Review \n\n \n47. \nADB, GPG, EPP-PMO, and GFTC will meet regularly as required to discuss progress of \nthe individual subloan portfolios and any changes to implementation arrangements or remedial \nmeasures  required  for  achieving  the  objectives  of  the  Investment  Program.  Results  of \nindependent  postinstallation  verification  and  monitoring  of  energy  savings  will  be  considered. \nADB and GPG will undertake joint reviews of the Investment Program until it is fully disbursed. \nGPG will develop a monitoring plan and ensure that periodic progress and financial reports are \nsubmitted to ADB regularly. \n \n\nIV. \n\nCAPACITY BUILDING GRANT FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT \n\n48. \nThe  EPP-PMO  is  assessed  to  have  reasonable  technical  expertise  for  energy \nconservation activities. However, considering the innovative design of the Investment Program, \nareas  identified  as  requiring  assistance  include  technical  assessment  for  certain  energy \n\n \n\n\fefficiency  technologies,  economic  analysis  of  subprojects  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines, \nmeasurement  and  verification  of  energy  savings  from  subprojects,  and  development  of  CDM \nprojects.  \n \n49. \nGPG will build the capacity of the EPP-PMO. It plans to establish the Guangdong energy \nefficiency  fund  to  support  such  activities  and  meet  other  related  expenses,  such  as  the  trust \nmanagement  fees  of  the  financial  intermediary,  independent  measurement  and  verification  of \nenergy  savings  from  subprojects,  financial  incentives  to  attract  more  EPP  subprojects, \napplication costs associated with CDM, information dissemination, provision of subloan default, \nand other investment program implementation costs. The fund will be financed by (i) provincial \ngovernment  budget,  (ii)  provincial  energy  surcharge  on  high  energy  users,  and/or  (iii) \ninternational donor grant support. GPG has tentatively agreed to fund $1.5 million for EPP-PMO \noperations in 2008 including third-party savings measurement and verification activities.  \n \n50. \nThe Government has also requested continued ADB support for the Investment Program, \nparticularly  in  the  area  of  market  analysis  of  the  potential  energy  savings  in  Guangdong, \nimplementation  support,  and  training  in  various  aspects  of  energy  efficiency  activities.  The \nscope of the project preparatory TA (footnote 10, iii) was expanded to include the initial training \nof  EPP-PMO  staff,  as  it  processes  applications  for  subsequent  tranches.  Further,  a  grant  of \n$2,000,000 is proposed for capacity building for energy efficiency implementation to be sourced \nfrom  the  Clean  Energy  Fund  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility.  While \nseveral donor countries have indicated their intent to contribute to the Clean Energy Fund, the \nfull contributions have not yet been made. The initial approval, based on the allocation from the \navailable  donor  contribution,  will  be  for  $800,000 21 ,  which  will  provide  the  resources  for \nimplementing activities included in the first phase. The remaining $1,200,000 will be considered \nfor  ADB  approval  when  additional  donor  contributions  are  in  place  and  the  allocation  is \napproved  under  the  guidelines  for  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility,  which  is \nexpected  in  mid-2008.  The  terms  of  reference,  the  division  of  consulting  services  inputs,  and \ncost estimates of the two phases are in Appendix 11. \n \n51. \nConsultants under the grant will be recruited by GPG according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Consulting firms will be selected \nthrough  international  competition  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method.  Full \ntechnical proposals will be required and be evaluated based on a quality-cost ratio of 80:20. To \nensure continuity between the two  phases, GPG will invite proposals from consulting firms for \nthe  phased  implementation  of  activities,  but  the  implementation  of  phase  II  activities  will  be \nlinked to ADB approval of the subsequent grant components of $1,200,000. Grant proceeds will \nbe disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from \ntime to time); direct payment and reimbursement procedures will be used. \n \n\nV. \n\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nEnvironmental Benefits and Impacts \n\nA. \n \nAn  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  prepared  for  the  Investment \n52. \nProgram (Appendix 12) concludes that the Investment Program will provide an overall benefit to \nthe  environmental  conditions  in  Guangdong.  Regional  air  quality  will  improve  and  greenhouse \ngas  emissions  will  be  reduced  as  the  need  for  coal-fired  power  will  be  reduced.  The \nenvironmental benefits include reduction of coal use and emissions (para. 22).  Based on ADB\u2019s \nWorkbook  on  Economic  Evaluation  of  Environmental  Impacts,  the  total  economic  value  of  the \n\n                                                 \n21  Contributor: Government of Australia. \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nquantifiable  environmental  benefits  from  reduced  air  emissions  is  estimated  to  be  about  $7.8 \nmillion (Appendix 13) over the life of tranche 1. Unquantifiable environmental benefits are also \nsignificant. \n \n53. \nBecause  the  Investment  Program  deals  with  only  retrofits  of  existing  facilities  at \nconsumer  sites,  the  potential  environmental  impacts  are  limited  to  disposal  of  the  replaced \nelectrical  and  mechanical  equipment  and  appliances.  Disposal  will  comply  fully  with  GPG \nregulations  to  minimize  any  potential  impacts.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \n(2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003),  the  first  tranche  of  the  Investment \nProgram is classified as FI as all the subprojects have insignificant environmental impacts.  \n \nB. \n \n54.  A forecast of the electricity demand in Guangdong considered trends, structural changes, \nefficiency  improvements,  GDP  growth,  and  other  important  factors  affecting  energy  demand \nElectricity demand (GWh) was conservatively forecast to grow at more than 10% for 2007\u20132011 \nand  about  8%  for  2016\u20132020;  peak  system  load  (MW)  is  projected  to  grow  at  more  than  9% \nfrom 2007 to 2015 and about 7% from 2016 to 2020 (Appendix 2). EPP is a least-cost option to \nhelp  balance  power  demand  and  supply  in  Guangdong;  it  will  cost  about  half  of  the  cost  of \npower supply from a conventional coal-fired power plant.  \n \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  calculated  to  assess  the  economic \n55. \nviability  of  the  subprojects.  The  economic  analyses  were  performed  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects (1997). The economic costs include capital costs, \nand  operation  and  maintenance  costs.  Appropriate  conversion  factors  were  used  to  convert \nfinancial  values  into  economic  values.  Values  are  expressed  in  2007  local  currency.  The \neconomic benefits mainly include the cost savings of electricity and coal. The economic benefits \nof avoided air emissions were also considered. The estimated EIRR and economic net present \nvalues for the subprojects are shown in Table 3. For tranche 1, the EIRR is estimated at 23.3% \nwithout environmental benefits and 28.9% with the benefits. The economic net present value is \n$14.1 million without environmental benefits and $21.9 million with. Sensitivity and risk analyses \nmodeling  were  performed  for  adverse  scenarios,  and  the  EIRRs  were  found  to  be  stable  and \nrobust. The EIRR of tranche 1 would decrease to (i) 22.7% if the subprojects experience a cost \noverrun  of  20%;  (ii)  20.7%,  if  the  benefits  reduce  by  20%;  (iii)  24.1%,  if  the  subprojects \nexperience a commissioning delay of 1 year; and (iv) 18.5%, if (i), (ii), and (iii) all happen. Even \nunder  the  unlikely  case  of  (iv),  the  EIRR  for  tranche  1  is  still  significantly  higher  than  12%. \nAdditional information about the economic analyses is in Appendix 13. \n \n\nTable 3: Summary of Economic Internal Rate of Return and Economic Net Present Value \n \nSubcomponent \n\nWithout Environmental \nBenefits \n\nWith Environmental Benefits \n\nEIRR (%) \n\nENPV ($1,000) \n\n \nFenghua Advanced Technology Co.             \nGuangzhou Iron and Steel Co. \nHuizhou South Thermo-Electricity Co. \nHongtai Trade Co. \nJinguan Energy Services Co. \nHaihong Co.

The FIRR \nand financial net present value were computed for each of the nine subprojects as well as for all \nthe nine subprojects combined (Table 4). The financial analyses were carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects (2005).22 The financial costs include \ncapital  costs,  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs.  The  financial  benefits  are  based  on  the \ncost  savings  for  electricity  resulting  from  reduced  electrical  consumption.  To  be  conservative, \nthe  potential  revenue  from  sale  of  the  CERs  under  the  CDM  is  not  included  in  the  FIRR \ncalculation. The weighted average cost of capital is estimated to be 7.5%. The FIRRs for each \nof  the  nine  subprojects  are  higher  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  confirming  the \nfinancial  viability  of  the  subprojects.  The  FIRR  for  tranche  1  is  estimated  at  16.6%  and  the \nfinancial  net  present  value  at  $21.3  million.  Sensitivity  analyses  show  that  the  FIRR  is  stable \nand  robust  under  various  adverse  scenarios.  The  overall  FIRR  would  decrease  to  (i)  12.8%  if \nthe subprojects experience a cost overrun of 20%; (ii) 11.3%, if the benefits are lowered by 20%; \n(iii) 14.4%, if commissioning is delayed by 1 year; and (iv) 4.3%, if (i), (ii), and (iii) all happen. \nThe detailed project financial analysis is in Appendix 14. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Financial Internal Rate of Return and Financial Net Present Value  \nSubproject \nFenghua Advanced Technology Co.                \nGuangzhou Iron and Steel Co. \nHuizhou South Thermo-Electricity Co. \nHongtai Trade Co. \nJinguan Energy Services Co. \nHaihong Co.

GFTC  is  owned  by  GPG  and  is  the  only  provincial \n57. \ntrust  company  operating  in  Guangdong.  Strict  new  rules  and  regulations  introduced  by  the \nChina  Banking  Regulatory  Commission,  following  the  industry  shakeout  during  the  Asian \nfinancial  crisis,  has  led  the  company  to  reorganize  its  operations  and  strengthen  its  finances. \nThe new regulations mean that GFTC has been provided with paid-up capital of CNY565 million \n($75 million), and must maintain complete separation between its trust operations and its own \nproprietary  investments,  avoid  taking  deposits  or  secure  loans  against  its  own  balance  sheet, \nand  conduct  its  trust  business  with  arms  length  transactions  at  fair  market  prices.  Conditions \nthat favor GFTC include Guangdong\u2019s rapid economic development; the strengthened financial \nmarket  regulatory  framework  of  the  China  Banking  Regulatory  Commission,  and  GFTC\u2019s  own \ngood  reputation  and \nlack  of \nunderstanding of trust companies by the general public, lack of innovation, and overregulation. \n \n58. \nBy  the  end of  2006,  GFTC  had  fully  written  off non-performing  assets and  disposed  of \nloans that no longer comply with current trust company regulations. The successful cleaning up \nof  the  balance  sheet  was  facilitated  by  GFTC  using  its  own  proprietary  capital  to  earn  good \nreturns  in  the  buoyant  economic  conditions  that  prevailed  during  2006.  Revenues  virtually \ndoubled to reach CNY118 million ($15 million), while operating profits grew from CNY20 million \n\nfinancial  strength.  However,  negative  elements \n\ninclude \n\n                                                 \n22 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.

These  returns  were \nsufficient  to  cover  the  write-off  (CNY60  million)  of  the  remaining  nonperforming  loans  and \nprovide an after-tax profit of CNY12 million. Fee income from managing trusts made a relatively \nminor  CNY5.6  million  (5%)  contribution  to  revenue,  but  enabled  GFTC  to  leverage  its \nprofessional capabilities and take advantage of its ability to do business in a field that offers a \nrelatively  more  stable  income  stream  than  its  other  activities.  GFTC  anticipates  that  planned \nincreases in its trust management activities will reduce its dependence on the speculative and \nvolatile securities trading business, and thereby help stabilize returns from one year to the next. \nGFTC managed more than 40 trusts in 2006 with a total of CNY995 million ($133 million) under \ntrust management at year-end. Trust accounts under GFTC management are projected to grow \nfrom around 5% of revenues in 2006 to 25% by 2012, thereby ensuring steady financial returns. \nManagement of GPG\u2019s EPP trust will greatly assist GFTC to achieve this objective. The overall \nprofit forecasts to 2012 anticipate that the 26% after-tax operating return on capital employed in \n2006 is likely unsustainable; and while potential returns from stocks may be volatile from year to \nyear,  the  trend  will  align  closely  with  the  overall  national  economic  growth  rate.  Growth  in  the \ntrust  management  portfolio  is  a  potentially  profitable  development,  but  will  require  more \nintensive staff supervision and higher administrative and general costs. Its experience and good \nrecord indicate that the company is capable of managing the proposed Investment Program.  \n \nD. \n \n59. \nBy  including  only  retrofits  of  existing  electricity  consuming  facilities,  the  Investment \nProgram will not involve any land acquisition or resettlement. Therefore, no land acquisition or \nresettlement plan is needed. Negative social impacts resulting from worker layoffs are unlikely. \nThe  improvement  in  energy  security  and  environmental  quality  under  the  Investment  Program \nwill  benefit  the  poor  more  than  the  general  population,  as  the  poor  are  generally  more \nvulnerable under adverse circumstances. The Investment Program will create a number of jobs \nin  the  energy  efficiency  service  sector.  In  addition,  it  will  reduce  coal  consumption,  free  up \nresources,  and  lower  the  risks  associated  with  coal  mining  and  transportation.  The  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is presented in Appendix 15. \n \nE. \n \n60. \nRisks  associated  with  potential  changes  in  Government  policy  and  uncertain  power \ndemand  in  Guangdong  are  minimal.  In  fact,  the  Investment  Program  is  an  integral  part  of \nGuangdong's  FYP,  which  mandates  16%  energy  efficiency  improvement  during  2005\u20132010, \nand 28% improvement during 2005\u20132020. An analysis of the demand for electricity shows that \nthe province will continue to need additional power supply to sustain its economic development, \nregardless  of  whether  this  is  to  be  provided  through  coal-fired  power  plants  or  EPPs. \nMacroeconomic  conditions  are  expected  to  continue  to  be  sound  with  continuing  political \nstability in the PRC. Strong economic performance is expected in Guangdong based on GPG\u2019s \nprojections and its growth trends. \n \n61. \nAll subprojects included in tranche 1 are based on proven and established technologies; \nand  involve  installation  of  energy  efficiency  equipment  and  appliances  that  have  been  used \nsuccessfully in the PRC. In addition, most of the proposed retrofits can be implemented within a \nrelatively short time, i.e., 1 to 4 months. For subsequent tranches, all subprojects will use similar \nproven  energy  efficiency  technologies  with  reliable,  measurable,  and  verifiable  energy  and \ncapacity  savings.  Third  party  measurement  of  actual  energy  savings  of  implemented \nsubprojects  will  be  carried  out  to  verify  the  subprojects\u2019  energy  savings.  Should  the  actual \nenergy savings be less than originally calculated, the EPP-PMO will be required to strengthen \n\nRisks \n\n \n\n\ftechnical eligibility criteria and/or recruit more EPP subprojects in each cycle of lending. Thus, \nthe technical risks of the Investment Program are minimal. \n \n62. \nThe economic analysis of all subprojects included in tranche 1 suggests little economic \nrisk.  Sensitivity  and  risk  analyses  indicate  tranche  1  will  be  economically  viable  under  various \nadverse scenarios. \n \n63. \nThe subloan credit risks are minimized in various ways, including (i) requiring the posting \nof  collateral  and/or  guarantees,  (ii)  checking  credit  and  financial  criteria  when  appraising \napplicants, (iii) accepting only subprojects with investment payback periods of less than 5 years \nto  ensure  adequate  cash  flow  for  subloan  repayments,  and  (iv)  requiring  subborrowers  to \nassume  at  least  20%  of  total  subproject  investment  cost.  GFTC  will  constantly  monitor  the \nrepayments and make suitable interventions to recover the subloans, when required. \n \n64. \nSuccessful  implementation  requires  sound  project  and  financial  management.  The \ninvolvement  of  GFTC  and  the  EPP-PMO  addresses  both  requirements  as  their  strengths  are \ncomplementary;  they  have  adequate  capacity,  but  the  innovative  design  of  the  Investment \nProgram will necessitate additional training.  Supplemental TA support provided by ADB would \nfurther  assist  GPG  in  strengthening  their  capacities.  GPG  has  given  its  support  for  the  model \nthrough budgetary support for part of the costs incurred by GFTC and the EPP-PMO. \n \n65. \nThe  key  EPP-PMO  personnel  are  former  senior  staff  from  Guangdong  Energy \nConservation  and  Monitoring  Center  with  expertise  in  marketing  and  implementing  energy \nconservation projects. To ensure better implementation results, the Clean Energy Fund grant for \ncapacity  building  will  enable  GPG  to  recruit  experienced  consultants  to  strengthen  the  EPP-\nPMO  in  the  areas  of  technical  assessment;  savings  measurement  and  verification;  carbon \ncertification under the CDM; and investment program management, monitoring, and compliance. \nGFTC has more than 20 years experience in trust management, and was one of the few trust \ncompanies to be issued a license to operate by China Banking Regulatory Commission. \n \n66. \nAn additional risk is that end users may not wish to carryout retrofit projects to improve \nenergy  efficiency.  To  address  this,  the  Government  and  GPG  have  announced  aggressive \ntargets  and  action  plans  to  require  end  users  to  reduce  energy  consumption  per  unit  of  GDP. \nFurther, energy efficiency programs help to mitigate the adverse impacts of energy generation \nand  its  use  on  the  environment.  They  foster  rational  use  of  energy  that  conserves  natural \nresources, thus helping to reduce dependence on fossil-based generation; they also relieve the \nshortage  of  energy  supply.  The  Government  has  carried  out  public  information  campaigns  to \nraise awareness. For end users, retrofits of energy efficient equipment reduce operating costs \nand  increase  productivity,  so  will  be  inherently  attractive.  Lowering  the  barriers  for  debt \nfinancing will encourage end users to implement EPP subprojects and avail of the benefits. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n67. \nIn  addition  to  the  assurances  included  in  the  framework  financing  agreement,  the \nGovernment  and  GPG  have  given  the  following  assurances,  which  will  be  incorporated  in  the \nrelated legal documents as appropriate: \n \n\n(i) \n\nAuditing  and  accounting.  GPG,  EPP-PMO,  GFTC,  and  each  subproject  will \nmaintain  proper  accounts  and  records,  and  ensure  that  such  accounts  are \naudited  in  a  timely  manner  to  adequately  identify  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  in \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\n\f \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\nsuch  a  manner  and  detail  as  may  be  specified  under  the  loan  agreement  and \nproject agreement(s). \n\nGuangdong  energy  efficiency  fund.  GPG  will  establish  an  energy  efficiency \nfund  not  later  than  31  December  2008  to  provide  for:  (a)  direct  financial \nincentives  for  EPP  subprojects  based  on  actual  energy  savings,  (b)  capacity \nbuilding  and \ninformation  dissemination  activities,  (c)  promotion  of  clean \ndevelopment  mechanism,  (d)  expenses  related  to  the  EPP-PMO  and  GFTC  for \nthe  Investment  Program  implementation,  and  (e)  other  activities  designed  to \npromote energy conservation. \n\nEnergy efficiency policy framework. GPG will establish by 31 December 2008 \nan  energy  efficiency  policy  framework  to  expand  and  accelerate  participation  of \nend  users  in  energy  efficiency  improvement.  As  a  minimum,  GPG  will  establish \nby  31  December  2008  (a)  maximum  per-unit  energy  consumption  for  selected \nenergy-intensive  industries  such  as  cement,  iron  and  steel,  metals,  electricity \ntransmission  and  distribution,  petrochemical,  chemical,  paper, \ngeneration, \nconstruction  materials,  and  other  industries,  and  related  energy  auditing  and \nenforcement  regulations;  and  (b)  incentives  (such  as  direct  financial  incentives \nfunded by the GPG budget to end users based on achieved energy savings) to \novercome  financial  barriers  to  end  users\u2019  participation  in  energy  efficiency \nimprovement projects.  \n\nPolicy  change.  GPG  shall  inform  ADB  in  due  course  of  any  changes  in  its \nenergy  efficiency  regulations,  power  pricing,  and  power  dispatch  and  other \nsimilar policies that may adversely  affect the financial viability of each financing \ntranche under the Investment Program. \n\nGovernance. GPG will ensure that GFTC maintains proper internal controls in its \noperations.  GFTC  will  adopt  acceptable  computerized  accounting  and \nmanagement information systems, and prepare financial statements and reports \nin accordance with national accounting standards. \n\nDevelopment  of  an  EPP  market.  GPG  will  ensure  that  the  EPP-PMO \nundertakes  measures  to  promote  energy  efficiency  and  that  adequate  staff  are \ntrained and deployed to fully implement the Investment Program. \n\n(vii)  Compliance  with  national  labor  laws.  GPG  will  ensure  that  any  new \nemployment  generated  by  the  subprojects  financed  by  ADB  will  comply  with \nnational labor laws. \n\n \n(viii)  Subprojects and subloans. GPG will ensure that the EPP-PMO and GFTC will \n(a) select  subprojects  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  criteria;  and  (b)  execute \nsubloan  and  subproject  agreements  in  form  and  substance  acceptable  to  ADB, \nincluding terms and conditions agreed between GPG and ADB. \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\n \nB. \n \nFor the first loan only, the trust agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, \n68. \nwill have been executed between GFB and GFTC, and will have become effective and binding \nupon GFB and GFTC in accordance with its terms. \n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fCondition for Loan Disbursement \n\nC. \n \n69. \nThe  first  loan  will  be  disbursed  when  GFB  certifies  to  ADB  that  the  subloan  and \nsubproject  agreements  of  the  amount  to  be  withdrawn  have  been  executed  between  GFTC, \nEPP-PMO, and the relevant subborrowers, in form and substance acceptable to ADB, and have \nbecome effective and binding upon the parties to the agreements.  \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  would  comply  with  the \n70. \nArticles  of  Agreement  of

million,  has  the  largest  and  fastest  growing \neconomy among all the provinces in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Its gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) has grown by 14% per year since 1995; and was about CNY3.07 trillion in 2007, \nrepresenting  approximately  one  eighth  of  the  nation\u2019s  total  GDP.  The  high  growth  was \naccompanied by rapidly growing electricity demand. The growth in demand for power averaged \n13% annually since 1995, outpacing that of capacity addition. Since 2002, Guangdong has been \nexperiencing  power  shortages  during  the  summer  peak  periods,  and  has  had  to  curtail  power \nsupply to many industrial consumers. During the summer of 2007, the shortage was estimated \nto be 6,250 megawatts (MW). Electricity consumption and demand in Guangdong is provided in \nTable A2.1.  \n \n\nTable A2.1: Electricity Consumption and Demand in Guangdong Province, 1995\u20132007 \n\nElectricity \nConsumption \n(GWh) \n\nAnnual \nGrowth Rate \n(%) \n\nElectricity \nDemand \n(MW) \n\nAnnual Growth Rate \n(%) \n\n78,768 \n\n85,771 \n\n91,886 \n\n98,787 \n\n108,626 \n\n133,458 \n\n145,842 \n\n168,783 \n\n203,129 \n\n238,714 \n\n267,356 \n\n299,105 \n\n7.6 \n\n8.9 \n\n7.1 \n\n7.5 \n\n10.0 \n\n22.9 \n\n9.3 \n\n15.7 \n\n20.4 \n\n17.5 \n\n12.0 \n\n11.9 \n\n13,600 \n\n14,960 \n\n16,530 \n\n17,730 \n\n19,530 \n\n23,500 \n\n25,800 \n\n28,630 \n\n34,000 \n\n39,700 \n\n44,150 \n\n49,700 \n\n7.5 \n\n10.0 \n\n10.5 \n\n7.3 \n\n10.2 \n\n20.3 \n\n9.8 \n\n11.0 \n\n18.8 \n\n16.8 \n\n11.2 \n\n12.1 \n\n12.3 \n\n2007 \nGWh = gigawatt-hour, MW = megawatt. \nSource: Guangdong provincial government and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n339,301 \n\n55,829 \n\n13.0 \n\n2. \nBy  the  end  of  2007,  Guangdong's  total  installed  generation  capacity  was  59,323  MW. \nCoal-fired  power  plants  account  for  45,109  MW  (76%),  hydropower  7,830  MW  (13%),  nuclear \npower  3,780  MW  (6.4%),  pumped  storage  2,400  MW  (4%),  and  wind  power  204  MW  (0.3%). \nGuangdong imports electricity from other provinces to meet about 20% of its electricity demand. \nThe coal-fired power plants contribute significantly to environmental problems. \n \n3. \nDemand  for  electricity  is  expected  to  continue  its  rapid  growth.

In  2006,  energy  efficiency  in  terms  of  standard \ntons  of  coal  equivalent  (tce)  per  $10,000  GDP  was  5.87,  3.4  times  the  average  of  member \ncountries  of  the  Organization  of  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development,  3.9  times  that  of \nJapan,  or  2.4  times  that  of  the  United  States.  Guangdong\u2019s  electricity  efficiency  in  2005  was \n1,195  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  per  CNY10,000  GDP,  ranking  it  14th  among  the  PRC  provinces. \nThe potential for energy efficiency improvement is large; the power subsector has an estimated \ncost-effective energy efficiency improvement potential of 17,000 MW and 41,210 gigawatt-hours \nper year energy saving.1 Least-cost opportunities for retrofit efficiency investments are available \n                                                 \n1  Optimal Energy, Inc. 2007.

The \nfirst two options involve resetting electricity tariffs, which is not within the control of the provincial \ngovernments.  The  third  option  requires  considerable  budget  resources  although  benefits  will \nmostly  accrue  to  the  participating  consumers.  The  Guangdong  provincial  government  (GPG) \nhas selected the fourth option with a complementary program to attract consumers to participate \nin the EPP. \n \n7. \nPRC recently amended the Energy Conservation Law of 1997. The amendments include \n(a)  expansion  of  sectors  brought  within  the  ambit  of  the  law,  such  as,  the  transport  sector; \n(b) requiring  government  at  all  levels  to  increase  investment  in  public  transportation,  improve \nservices,  and  encourage  people  to  use  public  transportation;  and  (c)  strengthening  of \nadministrative  enforcement  of  energy  conservation.  Local  energy  saving  standards  are \nexpected  to  be  more  stringent  than  those  set  by  central  government,  and  achievement  of \nenergy conservation targets are incorporated into the performance evaluation of the responsible \ngovernment officials.  \n \nB. \n \n8. \nEnergy services are a young industry in Guangdong. At present only 13 energy service \ncompanies (ESCOs) are registered with the China Energy Management Companies Association. \nMost  of  them  are  small  privately  owned  companies.  ESCOs  typically  offer  large  energy  users \nfree energy audits to identify and recommend cost-effective energy-saving measures. Once the \nenergy  users  agree,  ESCOs  develop  and  design  detailed  energy-saving  proposals.  To \npersuade energy users to implement recommended energy-saving proposals, ESCOs typically \noffer a shared savings or an energy performance contract. These contracts enable the ESCOs \nto  finance  the  front-end  cost  of  energy-saving  equipment.  The  users  use  the  savings  from \nenergy  expenditure  to  pay  for  the  ESCO  investment,  including  a  reasonable  return  on \ninvestment.  ESCOs  negotiate  their share  of  energy  savings  (typically 50%\u201480%)  with  energy \nusers so that the payback period is 3\u20138 years. After the payback period, energy users retain the \nfull benefit of reduced energy consumption.  \n \n9. \nIn  this  business  model,  the  critical  success  factor  is  the  availability  of  capital.  The \nESCOs need to borrow funds to implement energy savings for new energy users. This has been \ndifficult because of the narrow asset base that they possess. The growth of ESCOs has been \nseverely restricted by the lack of capital; numerous smaller ESCOs had to close within a year or \ntwo as they were unable to build the equity needed to sustain their business. Commercial banks \nhave been reluctant to lend to ESCOs because of a lack of understanding of the technologies \nand production processes; and they were unable to properly evaluate the risk profile of this new \nbusiness model, specially the use of shared savings and energy performance contracts. When \ncommercial  banks  do  lend  for  the  sake  of  maintaining  relationships,  they  generally  require  a \n\nEnergy Service Companies  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nfor  energy  efficiency \n\nimprovement.  Opportunities \n\nEnvironmental Impact of the Energy Sector \n\nloan  guarantee  that  considerably  increases  the  cost  of  borrowing.  The  ESCOs  interviewed \nduring  project  preparation  indicate  that  (i)  the  lack  of  finance  limits  their  capacity  to  enter  into \nshared  savings  contracts;  (ii)  the  majority  of  industrial  energy  users  prefer  shared  savings \ncontracts because ESCOs share the technology and financial risks; and (iii) when such energy \nservices were not available, energy users generally deferred retrofit projects and the opportunity \nto save energy (and fuel expenses) was lost.  \n \n10. \nIn countries like Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, ,ESCOs have been \nplaying an important role by helping energy users improve energy efficiency and reduce energy \nconsumption.  In  Guangdong,  the  large  industrial  and  commercial  users  that  account  for  more \nthan 73% of total electricity consumption are busy expanding their businesses; they either lack \nthe  capacity  or  are  reluctant  to  divert  their  resources  to  energy  efficiency  improvement.  GPG \nhas announced an aggressive program to reduce energy consumption per unit of GDP by 16% \nduring 2006\u20132010. To be able to realize the energy-saving potential, particularly by the medium-\nsized and smaller energy users, the ESCOs must be helped to overcome the financing barrier \nand thus be able to grow bigger and stronger.  \n \nC. \n \n11. \nAnalysis of the power subsector indicates that projects focusing on retrofitting of energy-\nintensive  facilities  at  existing  industrial  and  commercial  establishments  are  the  most  cost-\neffective  areas \nfor  retrofit  efficiency \ninvestments  exist  for  motors,  transformers,  lighting,  and  air  conditioning,  etc.  Improving  the \nefficiency  of  energy  consumption,  as  seen  from  international  experience,  has  two  significant \nbenefits: (i) less primary energy supply will be needed for economic growth, which strengthens \nenergy security; and (ii) less fossil fuel will be used, which will lower pollution and greenhouse \ngas  emission.  A  MW  of  avoided  power  generation  capacity  reduces  the  investment  in  energy \nsupply by over $2 million, and every MWh saving will avoid consumption of 330 kilogram (kg) of \ncoal; and emissions of 780 kg of carbon dioxide, 9 kg of sulfur dioxide, 3.4 kg of total suspended \nparticulates, and 2 kg of nitrogen oxide. Investment in energy efficiency allows a rapid reduction \nin  energy  demand,  which  is  particularly  important  for  provincial  energy  planning  and \nmanagement.  An  energy  efficiency  project  can  save  energy  in  a  shorter  timeframe  (a  few \nmonths) than construction of equivalent capacity conventional power plants (typically 2\u20134 years). \nIt,  therefore,  provides  provincial  energy  planners  a  useful  energy  supply  development \nalternative. \n \nD. \n \n12. \nThe  PRC's  power  subsector  went  through  major  reform  from  2002  to  2003  when \ngeneration  was  separated  from  distribution  and  transmission.  This  separation  means  that  the \nbenefits  of  energy  efficiency  get  diluted  as  they  are  now  divided  between  two  entities. \nGeneration companies have no interest in investing in or encouraging end-use energy efficiency. \nThey have an incentive for lowering operating costs to improve supply-side margins, but have \nno interest in lowering demand or peak prices or improving energy efficiency among end users. \nAt the same time, the current pricing method discourages grid company investment in end-use \nenergy efficiency as revenue and profits are linked to electricity sales.  \n \n13. \nInvestment in energy efficiency is influenced by both price levels and structure, but thus \nfar, end-use energy efficiency has played an insignificant role. The PRC's electricity price and \nstructure are not designed to encourage energy efficiency or address known market barriers to \nenergy  efficiency.  Although  the  State  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  was  established  in \n2003, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) still sets the electricity tariff \n\nElectricity Tariffs \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nbased on costs of power generation, transmission, and distribution, including a reasonable rate \nof  return  on  investments.  NDRC  has  been  gradually  reforming  the  electricity  tariff  structure  in \nthe past few years. The price of coal has been mostly deregulated to enable it to adjust to the \nsupply-demand  position;  the  price  increase  has  been  rapid.  NDRC  has  linked  power  supply \nprices  of  coal-fired  power  plants  to  coal  prices.  Further,  the  recent  retail  pricing  reform \nannounced in NDRC\u2019s March 2005 pricing circular links prices for some large customers to their \nefficiency performance. The efficiency of several energy-intensive industries was reviewed and \ncategorized by levels of energy efficiency. Price discounts have been abolished and surcharges \nincreased  for  the  least  efficient.  This  pricing  policy  has  been  quite  effective;  in  2006,  it  is \nunderstood  that  about  1,200  high  energy-consuming  enterprises  had  shut  down,  suspended \noperations, invested in energy efficiency, or changed production processes. \n \n14. \nThe  general  tariff  in  Guangdong  is  comparable  to  international  norms;  however,  its \nstructure  can  be  improved  to  give  a  stronger  signal  to  all  end  users  to  improve  efficiency  of \nelectricity  consumption.  Table  A2.4  shows  the  representative  electricity  tariffs  in  Guangdong \nprovince. Across tariff classes, the cross-subsidies are substantial. The per unit price (CNY per \nkWh) for domestic class is typically higher than that of industrial and commercial classes due to \nload  density  and  pattern  of  usage.  However,  in  Guangdong,  the  current  per  unit  prices  of \nindustrial  and  commercial  consumers  are  higher  than  the  domestic  tariff.  To  provide  an \neconomic price signal, the current tariff should be gradually adjusted to more closely reflect the \ncost of providing electricity service for each class of end user. The time-of-use rates encourage \nconsumers  to  reduce  demand  during  peak  load  periods,  thus  increasing  the  utilization  of \ninstalled  generation  capacity.  In  Guangdong,  such  rates  currently  apply  only  to  industrial  end \nusers.  The  market  penetration  of  air  conditioning  in  commercial  and  residential  sectors  has \nbeen  steadily  increasing;  severe  power  shortages  in  the  summer  peak  period  have  occurred \nevery  year  since  2002.  Time-of-use  rates  can  be  set  for  large  commercial  and  residential \nelectricity  users,  and  seasonal  rates  (summer  and  other  seasons)  can  be  considered  to \nmotivate  end  users  to  use  electricity  more  efficiently.  Another  improvement  is  to  establish \nunbundled  power  supply,  transmission  and  distribution  tariffs  to  improve  accountability  and \nefficiency in each category of electricity service business.  \n\n \n\n\fItem\n\nTable A2.4: Guangdong Representative Electricity Tariff in 2007\nDonguan Fashan Jiangmen Zhuhai\nCNY/KVA or CNY/KW per month\n18.00\n27.00\n\nGuangzhou\n15.38\n23.08\n\n18.00\n27.00\n\n18.00\n27.00\n\n18.00\n27.00\n\nDemand Charge (transformer size), o\nDemand Charge (peak demand)\n\nAverage\n17.48\n26.22\n\nCNY/KWh per month\n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\nAverage\n$/KW\n\n2.33\n3.50\n\n$/KWh\n\n0.74\n0.73\n0.72\n\n0.24\n0.23\n0.23\n\n0.47\n0.46\n0.45\n\n1.01\n1.00\n0.99\n\n0.32\n0.32\n0.31\n\n0.64\n0.63\n0.06\n\n0.81\n0.80\n0.79\n0.50\n\n0.29\n0.50\n\n1.00\n0.98\n0.97\n\n0.32\n0.31\n0.31\n\n0.63\n0.62\n0.61\n\n1.19\n1.17\n1.15\n\n0.38\n0.37\n0.37\n\n0.75\n0.74\n0.73\n\n0.87\n0.86\n0.85\n0.59\n\n0.36\n0.52\n\n1.01\n0.99\n0.97\n\n0.32\n0.32\n0.31\n\n0.64\n0.62\n0.62\n\n1.24\n1.24\n1.22\n\n0.39\n0.39\n0.39\n\n0.78\n0.78\n0.77\n\n0.98\n0.97\n0.96\n0.60\n\n0.34\n0.59\n\n1.01\n1.00\n0.98\n\n0.32\n0.32\n0.31\n\n0.64\n0.63\n0.62\n\n1.20\n1.18\n1.17\n\n0.38\n0.38\n0.37\n\n0.76\n0.75\n0.75\n\n0.96\n0.95\n0.94\n0.60\n\n0.33\n0.58\n\n0.92\n0.90\n0.88\n\n0.29\n0.28\n0.28\n\n0.58\n0.57\n0.56\n\n1.22\n1.20\n1.19\n\n0.39\n0.38\n0.38\n\n0.77\n0.76\n0.75\n\n0.96\n0.95\n0.94\n0.61\n\n0.35\n0.60\n\n0.94\n0.92\n0.90\n\n0.30\n0.29\n0.29\n\n0.59\n0.58\n0.57\n\n1.17\n1.16\n1.14\n\n0.37\n0.37\n0.36\n\n0.74\n0.73\n0.72\n\n0.92\n0.91\n0.90\n0.58\n\n0.33\n0.56\n\n0.12\n0.12\n0.12\n\n0.04\n0.04\n0.04\n\n0.08\n0.08\n0.08\n\n0.16\n0.15\n0.15\n\n0.05\n0.05\n0.05\n\n0.10\n0.10\n0.10\n\n0.12\n0.12\n0.12\n0.08\n\n0.04\n0.07\n\nB.

The  assistance  is  divided  evenly  between  projects  that  increased  energy  supply \n($1.6 billion) and that improved the environment ($1.9 billion). On the energy supply side, 47% \nwas  for  hydropower,  pumped-storage,  and  coal-mine  methane  projects;  20%  for  transmission \nlines;  and  33%  for  thermal  power.  In  1994,  ADB  supported  the  implementation  of  one  of  the \nearlier combined heat and power plants in Heilongjiang, which is now internationally recognized \nas a low carbon approach to meeting energy demand in colder regions. Similarly, the pumped-\nstorage power project loan approved in 1993 helped expand the capacity of the first such power \nplant  in  Guangdong  province.  It  used  new  technology  (reversible  turbines)  and  was  an \neconomically  efficient  and  cleaner  way  to  meet  peak  power  demand.  The  coal-mine  methane \nproject that started producing electricity in March 2008 is another innovation that addresses two \nmajor concerns: coal-mine safety and emission of greenhouse gases.  \n \n2. \nThe  environment  projects  helped  reduced  pollution  in  urban  centers  by  (i)  modernizing \nthe  district  heat  and  domestic  gas  supply  (37%),  and  (ii)  retrofitting  cleaner  production \nprocesses  in  industries  (63%).  The  industrial  cleanup  has  since  been  a  major  thrust  area  for \nlocal governments; these projects were ADB\u2019s initial efforts to support energy end users. Recent \nADB-financed energy projects have focused particularly on energy efficiency and environmental \nimprovement.  By  improving  efficiency,  the  projects  directly  reduce  coal  consumption  and \nconsequently reduce emission of pollutants, including greenhouse gases linked to global climate \nchange.  \n \n3. \nADB  has  also  provided  about  100  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects  for  the  energy \nsector,  costing  about  $50  million,  to  help  prepare  projects,  provide  policy  advice,  and  build \ninstitutional  capabilities  of  utilities  (power,  district  heat,  and  urban  gas  supply)  that  are  the \nimplementing agencies of ADB loans. ADB provided TA projects to help restructure the power \nsubsector, formulate power pricing strategy, improve the power planning process, and establish \nthe  State  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission.  The  TA  projects  also  covered  clean  production, \nenergy  conservation,  energy  efficiency,  and  environmental  management.  ADB  is  currently \nconducting  a  comprehensive  study  jointly  with  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission  to  analyze  opportunities  and  challenges  for  promoting  energy  efficiency  and \nrenewable energy. It will make practical policy recommendations to overcome barriers, facilitate \nimplementation of development strategies and industrial policies, explore innovative approaches \nto  utilize  external  assistance,  and  identify  key  provinces  and  projects  for  piloting  high  impact \nclean energy projects.1 \n \n4. \nADB has also extended two project loans (totaling $90 million) to the private sector for \npower  generation.  Its  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  recently  provided  a  partial  credit \nrisk guarantee program with an overall limit of CNY800 million to cover an agreed portion (about \n48% of the overall portfolio) of principal repayment of loans extended by selected partner banks \nto finance energy efficiency projects, which are designed and implemented by an internationally \nreputable  energy  service  company.  This  innovative  mechanism  ensures  the  most  reliable \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2007.

In  recent  years,  the  World  Bank  provided  loans  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  urban \nenvironment  improvement  and  development  of  renewable  energy.  Its  projects  also  have  a \nstrong  focus  on  environment  energy  efficiency  and  use  of  renewable  energy.  One  notable \nproject approved in 1998 supported three pilot companies in Beijing, Liaoning, and Shandong, \nwhich were among the first energy service companies (ESCOs) in the PRC.2 The World Bank \nalso  provided  TAs  for  power  subsector  restructuring  and  heating  subsector  reforms.  In  the \ninterest  of  addressing  finance-related  barriers  for  implementing  energy  efficiency  projects,  the \nWorld  Bank  together  with  other  organizations  implemented  a  study  covering  Brazil,  PRC,  and \nIndia  to  establish  banking  windows,  explore  guarantee  mechanisms,  support  ESCOs,  and \nattract equity investment in energy efficiency projects. The World Bank is currently preparing a \ntypical  financial  intermediation  loan  (FIL)  in  partnership  with  domestic  banks  for  approval  by \nJune  2008,  which  will  include  capacity  building  support  from  the  Global  Environment  Facility. \nAnother FIL in the private sector will extend guarantees to loans extended by domestic partner \nbanks to utility companies that help gas and district heating consumers reduce energy demand. \n \n6. \nThe  United  Nations  Development  Programme  is  providing  assistance  for  studies \nregarding  options  for  power  sector  restructuring  and  promotion  of  energy  conservation.  The \nongoing  China  End-Use  Energy  Efficiency  Project  aims  to  promote  energy  efficiency  in  major \nenergy-consuming sectors such as industries and building constructions.  \n \n7. \nThe  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  is  the  largest  source  of  external \nassistance  for  the  PRC\u2019s  power  subsector.  It  has  provided  concessional  loans  totaling  \nCNY438 billion for 14 power projects through its official development assistance window. It has \nalso provided special credits to major cities to improve their environment by installing emission \ncontrol  devices  and  equipment  in  power  plants  and  factories,  and  by  building  water  treatment \nfacilities. It is considering shifting its traditional focus of assistance in the power subsector from \nhydropower  and  thermal  power  generation  to  energy  conservation  and  renewable  energy, \nparticularly in the western region. The European Investment Bank extended a Euro 500 million, \nmulti-project,  China  Climate  Change  Framework  Loan \nto  assist \nimplementation  of  projects  that  prevent  or  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  German \ndevelopment cooperation, through Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, has approved approximately \n$400 million in mixed credits, mostly for power plants and turbine modernization projects. It also \nsupported  the  Government  in  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  development.  Other \nbilateral sources providing export credits or mixed credits in the energy sector include Australia, \nCanada, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, and United States.  \n \n8. \nADB  has  established  a  working  relationship  with  the  World  Bank  in  addressing  policy \nissues and coordinating lending and TA operations; and exchanges views with bilateral sources \nand the private sector. Both ADB and the World Bank emphasize the importance of promoting \nenergy  efficiency  projects,  increasing  provincial  government  involvement  in  clean  energy \nprojects, developing ESCOs and local banks to play a bigger role in clean energy financing, and \n\nin  November  2007 \n\n                                                 \n2   World Bank. 1998.

Success  is  attributed  to  extensive  preparation  prior  to  ADB \nintervention, high sense of local ownership, effective leadership in project management offices, \nand  timely  policy  and  enterprise  reforms.  The  front-end  delays  in  loan  signing  and  loan \neffectiveness  did  not  lead  to  unsatisfactory  performance.  The  Government  has  implemented \nreforms  on  investment  regulations,  which  simplify  approval  procedures  and  delegate  some \napproving  authority  to  the  provincial  governments.  ADB  has  been  working  closely  with  the \nGovernment  to  harmonize  the  two  approval  procedures  to  minimize  project  start-up  and \nimplementation delays. \n \nProject completion and performance audit reports for ADB-financed projects in the PRC \n10. \nhighlight the (i) need to improve financial reporting; (ii) need for more attention to environmental \nmatters;  (iii)  advisability  of  using  larger  boiler-turbine  units;  and  (iv)  necessity  for  capacity \nbuilding,  not  only  for  project  preparation,  but  also  for  staff  training  in  operations  and \nmanagement  aspects.

In particular, access \nto appropriate project financing that supports ESCO transactions should be an integral aspect of \nproject  design.  It  also  suggests  that  procurement  and  disbursement  procedures  should  be \nsimplified as these increase transaction costs and discourages energy efficiency.3 \n \nThese  lessons  were  taken  into  account  when  designing  and  preparing  the  Investment \n12. \nProgram.  During  preparation,  lessons  of  experiences  were  addressed  by  (i)  thoroughly \nreviewing  project  readiness  on  key  factors  that may  potentially  delay  the  start-up;  (ii)  carefully \nassessing institutional capacity and strengthening measures to improve corporate governance; \n(iii)  providing  conservative  estimates  of  the  expected  energy  savings  consistent  with  existing \npractices;  and  (iv)  setting  up  project  implementing  units  with  autonomy  for  operations  and  for \nprocurement decisions. \n \n\n                                                 \n3  World  Bank.  2004.

LTD. \n\nBackground \n\nOwnership and Organization  \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nGuangdong Finance Development Company, established in December 1984, served as \nthe financing arm of Guangdong Provincial Finance Bureau. The company was later renamed \nGuangdong  Finance  Trust  and  Investment  Company  (GFTIC)  in  1990.  At  that  time,  trust  and \ninvestment  companies  did  not  have  a  proper  regulatory  framework  and  many  were \noverleveraged,  engaged  in  high-risk  business,  and  went  into  insolvency  following  the  Asian \nfinancial crisis. More than 100 trust and investment corporations nationwide were closed by the \nPeople\u2019s Bank of China, including 20 from Guangdong. GFTIC became the only provincial trust \nand  investment  corporation  in  Guangdong  that  survived  the  crisis.  It  was  reorganized  as  a \nlimited liability company, and People\u2019s Bank of China reregistered it in 2002. The reregistration \nsharply reduced the scope of GFTIC\u2019s business. For example, it is not allowed to take deposits \nor borrow against its balance sheet. Following the issuance of new regulations on Administrative \nRules Governing Trust Companies and Administration Methods for Collective Fund Trust Plan \nand Trust Companies in 2007, GFTIC was again reregistered by the China Banking Regulatory \nCommission  (CBRC)  on  20  July  2007  and  placed  under  its  jurisdiction;  it  was  renamed \nGuangdong Finance Trust Company Ltd (GFTC). \n \nB. \n \n2. \nGFTC  has  a  registered  capital  of  CNY565.5  million  ($75  million),  of  which  98.14%  is \nowned  by  Guangdong  Finance  Investment  Holding  Company  and  1.86%  by  Guangdong \nScience  Venture  Investment  Company.  Both  shareholders  are  government  owned.  The \norganization  structure  of  the  company  (Figure  A7)  is  stipulated  in  the  Measures  for \nAdministering Trust Companies promulgated by CBRC in January 2007. It includes a board of \ndirectors, and a board of supervisors reporting to the shareholders. The board of directors has \nfive  members;  four  are  from  Guangdong  Finance  Investment  Holding  Company  and  one  from \nGuangdong  Science  Venture  Investment  Company.  GFTC  plans  to  add  two  independent \ndirectors.  The  board  of  supervisors,  comprising  three  members,  has  an  oversight  role.  Three \ncommittees  report  to  the  board  of  directors:  Risk  Management  Committee,  Investment \nCommittee,  and  Audit  Committee.  GFTC  operations  are  managed  by  a  general  manager  with \nthe assistance of two deputy general managers, and conducted by six functional departments. \nThe internal audit department reports directly to the board of directors.  \n \nC. \n \n3. \nThe roles and responsibilities of shareholders, board of directors, board of supervisors, \nand  management  are  clearly  defined  to  ensure  independence  and  effective  checks  and \nbalances. Mechanisms to separate duties and internal controls are in place. The organizational \nsetup  and  operating  procedures  are  reported  to  CBRC,  which  has  the  right  to  examine  the \ncompany  at  any  time.  Closer  supervision  of  trust  companies  by  CBRC  is  intended  to  ensure \nthese  companies  act  prudently  in  conducting  their  business.  GFTC  constantly  reviews  its \noperations  for  potential  risks  so  that  mitigating  measures  may  be  taken  in  a  timely  manner.  It \nhas clear procedures for the internal audit department, which operates independently from other \ndepartments and reports directly to the board of directors.  \n \n\nOperations \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nFigure A7: Organization Chart of Guangdong Finance Trust Company Ltd \n\nShareholders  \n\nBoard of \nDirectors  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoard of  \n \nSupervisors \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTrust  \n \nAccounting \n \n \n \n\nAudit \nCommittee \n\n \n \n \n\nRisk \nManagement \nCommittee   \n\n  Investment  \n  Committee   \n\nManagement \n\nGeneral  \nAdministration  \n\n \n\n    Trust  \n Accounting   \n  \n  \n  \n\nFinance \nAccounting \n  \n  \n  \n\n \n \n \n\n   Securities  \n   Investment \n\n  Asset  \n   Management   \n\n \n \n \n\nInternal  \nAudit \nDepartment \n \n\n  \n\n \n\nSource: Guangdong Finance Trust Company Ltd. \n \n4. \nGFTC's scope of business, as approved by CBRC, includes management of trust funds \nwith  lending  services  if  defined  in  trust  agreements.  It  can  also  provide  guarantees  provided \nthese are not more than 50% of its net assets. Although CBRC's new regulation has curtailed \nsome  of  its  activities,  some  existing  market  conditions  are  favorable  for  GFTC,  including  (i) \ncontinued  rapid  economic  development  and  income  growth  requiring  diversified  financial \nservices;  (ii)  rapid  capital  market  development  following  the  successful  reform  of  nontradable \nshares,  introduction  of qualified  foreign  institutional  investors,  and  a  regulatory  framework  that \nallows  trust  companies  to  develop  new  financial  services;  (iii)  new  regulations  that  aim  to \ndevelop the trust industry; and (iv) good reputation of GFTC among its clients. The challenges \nthat  GFTC  faces  include  (i)  trust  companies  are  not  understood  by  the  general  public;  (ii) \ntendency to be overly conservative due to historical problems of the sector; (iii) other financial \ninstitutions are increasingly venturing into trust operations, intensifying market competition; and \n(iv) financial market supervisors tend to overregulate and supervise.  \n \nD. \n \n5. \nGFTC's  risk  management  policies  are  provided  by  the  board  of  directors  with  advice \nfrom  the  Risk  Management  Committee,  Investment  Committee,  and  Audit  Committee. \nOperations  risks  are  managed  by  a  set  of  clearly  defined  operating  procedures,  segregating \nduties, and taking a scientific approach in decision making. It also conducts internal audit of its \noperations and postevaluation of its portfolio performance. Its risk management system aims to \nstrike  a  balance  among  research,  decision-making,  execution,  and  audit  and  evaluation \nfunctions.  For  the  Investment  Program,  GFTC  will  undertake  due  diligence  of  the  subproject \napplicants, identify risks, and take necessary mitigation measures to control these risks. \n \nE. \n \nFor  the  3  years  up  to  the  end  of  2006,  GFTC  reorganized  its  finances  by  clearing  out \n6. \nnonperforming assets and disposing of loans that no longer comply with current trust company \nregulations.  By  the  end  of  2006,  GFTC  had  resolved  the  nonperforming  assets  in  its  own \nproprietary books and virtually eliminated loan financing from the balance sheet. As required by \n\nFinancial Performance \n\nRisk Management \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n39 \n\nCBRC\u2019s Administrative Rules Governing Trust Companies, GFTC is also making provisions in \nits  reserves  for  potential  breaches  of  trust.  The  trust  compensation  reserve  stood  at  CNY1.28 \nmillion at the end of 2006, and is growing at 5% of annual after-tax profits. \n \n7. \nGFTC  has  facilitated  the  successful  restructuring  of  the  balance  sheet  by  using  its \ncapital  to  earn  good  returns  in  the  buoyant  economic  conditions  that  prevailed  during  2006. \nRevenues virtually doubled to reach CNY118 million ($15 million), while operating profits grew \nfrom  CNY20  million  in  2005  to  reach  CNY96  million  in  2006\u2014an  almost  five-fold  increase. \nThese returns were sufficient to cover the write-off (CNY60 million) of remaining nonperforming \nloans  and  provide  for  an  after-tax  profit  of  CNY12  million.  Fee  income  from  managing  trusts \nmade  a  relatively  minor  CNY5.6  million  (5%)  contribution  to  revenue,  but  enabled  GFTC  to \nleverage  its  professional  capabilities  and  take  advantage  of  its  ability  to  do  business  in  a  field \nthat offers a relatively more stable income stream than its other activities. \n \n8. \nThe financial and regulatory developments over the last 3 years have resulted in GFTC \nconsolidating its operations and establishing sound finances with no debt, high liquidity, and a \nmixed portfolio of tradable securities and longer term investments in unlisted financial services \ncompanies. GFTC therefore plans to take advantage of its strong financial structure and unique \nposition in Guangdong to develop its trust management business. Increased trust management \nactivities will reduce its degree of dependence on the speculative and volatile securities trading \nbusiness,  and  thereby  help  stabilize  returns  from  one  year  to  the  next.  GFTC  managed  more \nthan  40  trusts  in  2006  with  a  total  amount  under  trust  management  of  CNY995  million  \n($133  million)  at  the  end  of  2006.  Trust  activities  are  split  into  two  categories:  entrusted \ninvestments  and  entrusted  loans,  with  one  client  accounting  for  all  of  the  entrusted  loan \nbusiness.  Although  trust  accounts  under  GFTC  management  declined  from  CNY1.2  billion  at \nthe  beginning  of  2006,  (because  of  declining  loan  balances  in  the  entrusted  loans  category), \nthey  are  projected  to  grow  from  around  5%  of  revenues  in  2006  to  reach  25%  by  2012  and \nthereby  ensure  GFTC  achieves  steady  financial  returns  over  this  period.  Management  of  the \nInvestment Program's energy efficiency trust will greatly help GFTC to achieve this target. The \noverall  profit  forecasts  to  2012  anticipate  that  the  26%  after-tax  operating  return  on  capital \nemployed achieved in 2006 is likely unsustainable; and while potential returns from stocks may \nbe  volatile  from  year  to  year,  the  trend  rate  will  align  more  closely  with  the  overall  national \neconomic growth rate. Growth in the trust management portfolio will entail a concurrent shift to \nhigher  administrative  and  general  staff  costs,  with  the  overall  result  being  more  stable  and \nsteady returns on capital employed. \n \nF. \n \n9. \nThe energy efficiency trust to be established under the Investment Program is protected \nby CBRC\u2019s rules, as each trust is a separate account and cannot be commingled with other trust \naccounts or the proprietary investments of GFTC. GFTC will establish an energy efficiency trust \nmanagement unit with separate functions for (i) assessing financial viability of the subprojects; \n(ii)  disbursing  funds;  (iii)  managing  the  subloan  portfolio,  collaterals  and  guarantees,  and \nnonperforming loans; and (iv) preparing the relevant financial statements. The unit will have its \nown  director,  supported  by  three  deputies  for  the  functional  areas  of  administration,  financial \naccounting,  and  legal  matters.  The  administrative  section  will  establish  procedures,  monitor \nsubborrowers'  performance,  and  maintain  the  database  of  subloans.  The  financial  section  will \nmanage the financial and accounting systems for the trust. The legal section will be responsible \nfor preparation and custody of legal documents and for initiating any legal proceedings that may \nprove  necessary.  GFTC  currently  has  about  40  staff;  this  is  deemed  sufficient  for  tranche  1 \nsubborrowers.

The \nInvestment  Program  proposes  utilizing  the  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  The  Investment  Program  will  improve  energy  efficiency  in  the \nGuangdong  economy  and  mitigate  against  environmental  impacts  from  coal-fired  power \ngeneration  by  developing  energy  efficiency  power  plants  (EPPs)  in  Guangdong.  This \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  is  to  guide  the  Guangdong  Provincial \nGovernment  (GPG),  the  executing  agency,  in  the  environmental  assessment  of  subprojects \nincluded under the MFF to ensure compliance with the environmental  safeguard requirements \nof ADB. \n \nA. \n\nType of Schemes to Be Assessed \n\n \n\nThe  Investment  Program  will  include  energy  efficiency  subprojects  located  within \n\n2. \nGuangdong. The subprojects may include retrofits of \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\nmotors and motor-drive systems; \ntransformers and reactive power compensators; \nlighting; \nair conditioning, ventilation, refrigeration, and heating; \nair compressors and pumping systems; \nrecovery of waste energy from industry; \nindustrial boilers and industrial cogeneration; and \nother related energy efficiency improvement projects. \n\nThe  Investment  Program  will  also  provide  support  for  capacity  development  and \n\n \n3. \ninformation dissemination.  \n\n \nEnvironmental Assessment Procedure \n\nB. \n \n\n1. \n\nResponsibilities  and  Procedure \nSubprojects \n\nfor  Environmental  Assessment  of \n\n \nResponsibilities  and  Authority.  The  Investment  Program  will  be  implemented  in \n4. \naccordance with Guangdong's Road Map and Investment Program for energy efficiency. GPG \nwill  be  responsible  for  implementation  of  the  Road  Map  and  Investment  Program.  The  EPP-\nProject  Management  Office  (EPP-PMO)  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  ensuring  that  all \napplicable PRC and ADB environmental standards and procedures are followed.  \n \n5. \nEnvironmental  Assessment.  The  Investment  Program  is  classified  as  environmental \ncategory  FI,  which  involves  lending  through  a  financial  intermediary.  Tranche  1  has  been \nassessed and is classified as environmental category C, as all subprojects will have insignificant \nimpacts,  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003).  \n \nDuring  preparation  of  subsequent  tranches,  the  EPP-PMO  will  assess  the  potential \n6. \nenvironmental impacts from the tranche subprojects. Based on the assessment, the EPP-PMO \nwill categorize the subprojects into one of the following: \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nbatches  of  subprojects  requiring  an  environmental  management  system, \nincluding environmental assessment and review procedures for subprojects; and  \nbatches of subprojects that will only have insignificant impacts, which will require \na review of environmental implications.  \n\n \n\n7. \nDuring assessment of the potential environmental impacts from the tranche subprojects, \nthe EPP-PMO will categorize the subprojects into either category A, B, or C, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). Based on \nthe categorization, the subproject owner will submit to ADB the following reports: category A, a \nsummary  environmental  impact  assessment;  category  B,  a  summary  initial  environmental \nexamination; and category C, a review of environmental implications. The EPP-PMO will ensure \nthe  environmental  review  documents  comply  with  ADB  environmental  safeguard \nthat \nrequirements.  \n \n8. \nThe EPP-PMO will submit to ADB the proposed classification of (i) the tranche; and (ii) \nthe  subprojects  for  review  and  approval  prior  to  submission  of  the  periodic  financing \nrequirement  (PFR).  The  PFR  for  subsequent  tranches  will  include  a  safeguard  compliance \nstatus  report  for  subprojects  under  all  ongoing  tranches.  In  case  any  major  noncompliance  is \nidentified, a corrective action plan will be prepared and submitted together with the PFR. GPG \nwill  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  PRC  and  ADB  environmental  safeguard  requirements \nare being achieved and will maintain a centralized database of all environmental reports that will \nbe made available during ADB review missions.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Criteria for Subproject Selection \n\nThe  following  environmental  criteria  will  be  utilized  when  screening  selection  of \n\n \n9. \nsubprojects for subsequent tranches: \n \n\nThe  proposed  subprojects  will  be  energy  efficiency  projects  located  within \nGuangdong province. \nThe  subprojects  will  not  be  located  in  any  designated  environmental  protection \nzone. \nEach  subproject  must  be  designed,  constructed,  and  operated  in  accordance \nwith relevant national environmental laws and regulations. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n55 \n \n \n\nSUBPROJECT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n\nEstimation of Economic Costs \n\nEstimation of Economic Benefits \n\nA. \n \nThis appendix describes the economic analysis for each subproject included in tranche 1 \n1. \nand the overall result for all the nine subprojects. The analysis was prepared in accordance with \nthe  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects  (1997)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB). The input data and assumptions were reviewed and found appropriate. Economic costs, \nexpressed  in  mid-2007  constant  values,  were  used.  These  include  the  economic  costs  of \nsubprojects\u2019 capital, operation, and maintenance. Tradable commodities were valued at border \nprices  at  the  prevailing  exchange  rate.  Nontradable  commodities  are  valued  by  applying  a \nstandard  conversion  factor  of  0.987  and  the  following  specific  conversion  factors:  1.0  for \nequipment,  1.0  for  skilled  labor,  and  0.67  for  unskilled  labor.  The  capital  costs  are  net  of \nallowances for price inflation, interest during construction, and taxes.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nFor  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  calculations,  the  cost  savings  were \ngenerally  valued  at  the  avoided  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  costs  of  electricity \nsupply arising from the energy efficiency improvement projects. In the case of the boiler retrofit \nfor Huizhou Southeast Thermo-Electricity Co., the electricity savings from power plant efficiency \nimprovement  are  supplemented  by  savings  in  coal  consumption.  The  economic  value  of \nelectricity cost savings were quantified on the basis of the avoided marginal costs for electricity \ngenerated  by  a  conventional  coal-fired  power  plant  and  the  associated  marginal  transmission \nand distribution costs.1  \n \n3. \nThe  energy  efficiency  improvement  subprojects  will  reduce  emissions  from  coal-fired \npower  plants.  Major  air  pollutants  from  coal-fired  power  plants  include  total  suspended \nparticulate,  sulfur  dioxide,  nitrogen  oxide,  and  carbon  dioxide. 2  The  subproject  economic \nanalysis  therefore  includes  allowances  for  the  economic  benefits  of  reduced  air  pollution \nemissions.  The  economic  evaluation  of  the  environmental  impact  is  based  on  the  benefits \ntransfer  method  described  in  ADB\u2019s  Workbook  on  Economic  Evaluation  of  Environmental \nImpacts  (1996).  The  evaluation  of  the  damage  caused  by  greenhouse  gas  emissions  utilized \ndata  from  the  latest  carbon  credit  evaluation  in  Guangdong  province  under  the  clean \ndevelopment mechanism. \n\nEstimation of the Economic Internal Rate of Return \n\nC. \n \n4. \nThe projected EIRRs are high but  regarded as conservative, as they take into account \nonly the main benefits of different components, and include all project-related costs. The EIRRs \nfor  the  nine  subprojects  range  from  16.4%  to  34.8%  without  the  environmental  benefits  and \n20.9%  to  44.7%  with  the  benefits  (Supplementary  Appendix  B,  Detailed  Economic,  Financial, \nand  Environmental  Analyses  of  Tranche  1  Subprojects).  The  overall  result  for  the  first  set  of \nnine  subprojects  is  23.3%  without  environmental  benefits  and  28.9%  with.  Table  13.1 \nsummarizes  the  EIRRs  and  net  present  values  of  economic  benefits  for  all  subprojects.  The \n\n                                                 \n1  The marginal cost for electricity generated by conventional coal-fired power plant is CNY0.36/kWh. A benchmark \nfigure  of  CNY0.16/kWh  was  used  for  the  incremental  transmission  and  distribution  cost.  The  final  result  of \nCNY0.52/kWh was used for all economic benefit calculations. \n\n2   The  estimated  average  emissions  factors  from  a  typical  coal-fired  power  plant  is  0.78  kg/kWh  for  CO2,  \n\n0.009 kg/kWh for SO2, 0.002 kg/kWh for NOX, and 0.0035 kg/kWh for TSP. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\neconomic net present value of the nine subprojects included in tranche 1 is $21.8 million when \nenvironmental benefits are included.  \n \n\nTable A13.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return and Economic Net Present Value \n\nWithout Environmental Benefits  With Environmental Benefits \n\nSubcomponent \n \nFenghua Advanced Technology Co. \nGuangzhou Iron and Steel Co. \nHuizhou South Thermo-Electricity Co. \nHongtai Trade Co. \nJinguan Energy Services Co. \nHaihong Co. \nZhiguan Electric Co. \nLaifu Electric Co. \nZhuhai Secopower Transformer Co. \nTotal for Tranche 1 \n\nEIRR (%) \n\n23.5 \n33.0 \n34.0 \n24.8 \n23.3 \n16.4 \n17.3 \n34.8 \n31.2 \n23.3 \n\nENPV ($000) \n1,164 \n669 \n1,976 \n1,386 \n1,200 \n275 \n2,694 \n1,121 \n423 \n14,083 \n\nEIRR (%) \n30.7 \n41.8 \n44.7 \n31.7 \n28.8 \n28.8 \n20.9 \n22.8 \n39.5 \n36.5 \n\nENPV ($000) \n1,865 \n1,007 \n2,928 \n2,118 \n1,992 \n660 \n5,302 \n14,899 \n586 \n21,850 \n\nSensitivity and Risk Analysis \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, ENPV = economic net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD. \n \n5. \nSensitivity  analysis  showed  that  the  EIRR  would  decrease  to  (i)  22.7%  if  all  the \nsubprojects experience a cost overrun of 20%; (ii) 20.7%, if the benefits are reduced by 20%;  \n(iii)  24.1%,  if  the  first  set  of  subprojects  experiences  a  commissioning  delay  of  1  year;  and \n(iv) 18.5%, if (i), (ii), and (iii) all happen (Table A13.2). Even under the unlikely case of (iv) the \nEIRR is still significantly higher than 12%.  \n \n6. \nTo complement this analysis, risk analysis was performed using a probabilistic approach \nto  the  perceived  risk  factors  that  affect  the  viability  of  the  whole  project.  The  selected  risk \nvariables  include  capital  cost,  avoided  marginal  cost  for  electricity,  electricity  savings, \ncommissioning  year,  foreign  exchange  rate,  and  environmental  benefit.  A  total  of  1,000 \nsimulations  were  made.  Based  on  the  weighted  average  of  all  simulated  combinations,  the \nexpected  EIRR  of  the  whole  project  is  25.9%  with  a  standard  deviation  of  3.8%.  This  is  3 \npercentage points lower than the base value without consideration of project risks. \n\n \nTable A13.2: Sensitivity Analysis of the Economic Internal Rate of Return  \nChange \n\nCase \nA. \nB. \n \n \n \n \n\nBase Case \nSensitivity Cases \nCapital Cost Overrun \n(i) \nLower Benefits \n(ii) \n(iii) \nImplementation Delay \n(iv)  Combination of (i), (ii), and (iii) \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n20% \n20% \n1 Year \n\nEIRR (%) \n28.9 \n \n22.7 \n20.7 \n24.1 \n18.5 \n\nSI \n \n \n2.0 \n3.0 \n \n \n\nSV \n \n \n45.6 \n33.3 \n \n \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, SI = sensitivity indicator, SV = switching value. \nNote:  Sensitivity  indicator  is  the  ratio  of  percentage  change  in  the  EIRR  divided  by  the  percentage  change  in  the \ngiven parameter.

The analysis was performed in accordance with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nguidelines in  Financial Management and Analysis of Projects (2005). The analysis focuses on \nthe nine subprojects identified for funding under tranche 1. All costs and prices are in constant \n2007  currency  values.  For  subprojects  to  be  funded  by  subsequent  tranches,  similar  financial \nanalysis will be conducted. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nCapital  costs  are  based  on  projected  estimates  of  investment  for  the  nine  subprojects, \nincluding  labor,  equipment,  and  materials.  Much  of  the  equipment  can  be  purchased  off  the \nshelf  and  therefore  a  5%  allowance  for  labor  to  cover  installation  is  considered  realistic. \nLikewise  a  5%  allowance  for  physical  contingencies  is  provided.  The  exception  is  the  boiler \nretrofit for Huizhou Southeast Thermo-Electricity Company, for which a 30% labor allowance is \nprovided.  \n \n3. \nFinancial  benefits  for  all  the  nine  subprojects  are  the  reductions  in  electricity  bills \nresulting  from  each  subproject\u2019s  electricity  savings,  valued  at  the  current  applicable  electricity \ntariff.  Benefits  in  the  case  of  the  boiler  retrofit  for  Huizhou  Southeast  Thermo-Electricity \nCompany  include  coal-fuel  savings  as  well  as  electricity  savings  from  power  plant  efficiency \nimprovements.  The  analysis  excludes  any  potential  income  from  the  clean  development \nmechanism program for certified emission reductions.  \n \n4. \nOperation  and  maintenance  costs  are  assumed  to  be  about  3%  of  gross  fixed  assets. \nNet cash flows from the subprojects were determined after allowing for income taxes at 25% of \nincremental pretax profit.  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nTable  A14.1  provides  a summary  of  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  and  the \nfinancial net present value (FNPV) of each of the nine subprojects, and the overall result for all \nsubprojects.  Detailed computations of  FIRRs  and  FNPVs  are  in  Table  14.2.  All  the FIRRs  are \nhigher  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  estimated  at  7.5%  (para.  6).  The  FNPV  for \neach  subproject  is  calculated  using  the  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital.  The \nsubprojects are potentially financially attractive. The financial viability of the entire tranche 1 was \nsubjected  to  sensitivity analysis  under  various  adverse  conditions  (Table  14.3).  The  sensitivity \nanalysis  indicates  that  the  entire  tranche  of  nine  subprojects  remain  stable  and  robust  under \nvarious adverse scenarios.  \n \nC. \n \n6. \nThe weighted average cost of capital was calculated after tax, in real terms using actual \ncapital mix and costs of funds. The result is 7.5%. Actual interest rates of local loans were used \nand for the ADB loan the interest rate is based on the current London interbank offered rate on \n5-year  fixed-interest  swap  (currently  at  4.9%)  plus  the  ADB  loan  spread  of  0.6%.  The  cost  of \nequity  was  assumed  to  be  25.0%,  based  on  the  current  financial  performances  of  the  nine \nsubborrowers,  which  generally  have  returns  on  capital  employed  of  this  magnitude  or  better.1 \n                                                 \n1   These subprojects will be implemented by energy consumers that are subject to market-based pricing, unlike the \nusual ADB-funded projects for the supply side that have administered pricing and the government expects none or \nlittle return on equity. The high cost of equity has, therefore, led to a higher weighted average cost of capital than \nthe usual ADB projects.  \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return and Financial Net Present Value \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital  \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nThe income tax rate is 25.0%, and the average domestic inflation rate is assumed to be 2.5% \nper year. \n \n\nTable A14.1: Financial Internal Rates of Return and Financial Net Present Value \n\nSubprojects \nFenghua Advanced Technology Co.                \nGuangzhou Iron and Steel Co. \nHuizhou South Thermo-Electricity Co. \nHongtai Trade Co. \nJinguan Energy Services Co. \nHaihong Co.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe  Guangdong  Energy  Efficiency  and  Environment  Improvement  Investment  Program  (Investment  Program)  involves \ninvestments to improve energy efficiency in the industry, commercial, and other high energy consuming sectors in Guangdong \nProvince.  By  providing  economically  and  environmentally  superior  substitutes  for  conventional  electricity  generation,  the \naggregate savings from such investments can be thought of as an efficiency power plant (EPP). The strategy for assistance \nand  operations  in  the  2007\u20132008  country  strategy  and  program  update1 is  based  on  four  development  objectives  of  the \n(ii)  making  markets  work  better, \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China: \n(iii) improving the environment, and (iv) promoting regional cooperation. Promoting equitable and inclusive growth is the main \nstrategic  focus  for  reducing  poverty  and  income  disparity.  Despite  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  efforts  to  control  air  pollution, \nenvironmental  degradation  continues  to  be  a  problem  that  counteracts  economic  progress.  Rapid  growth  has  outpaced \nenvironmental  protection  and  many  cities  are  still  polluted.  The  Government  recognizes  the  strong  correlation  between \npoverty  and  the  environment.  It  has  asked  for  the  continued  support  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  in  protecting  and \nimproving the environment. This Investment Program will reduce energy demand in Guangdong, leading to stabilized current \npower generation.  \nB1.  Poverty Analysis                                                        Poverty Classification:   General intervention \nEnergy  efficiency  investments  lead  to  the  following  socioeconomic  and  environment  benefits  in  addition  to  reduced  energy \ncosts and emissions. \n \n1.  Reduce  Environmental  Impacts.  By  the  end  of  the  Investment  Program,  carbon  dioxide  emissions  will  be  reduced  by \n415,560  tons/year,  sulfur  dioxide  emissions  by  4,795  tons/yr,  nitrogen  oxide  emissions  by  1,066  tons/year,  and  total \nsuspended  particulates  emissions  by  1,785  tons/year.  This  will  result  in  socioeconomic  and  environmental  benefits  to  local \ncommunities. Improved air quality will reduce the morbidity and mortality rate of air-related diseases and associated medical \ncosts,  and  loss  of  healthy  working  days  in  Guangdong.  The  poor,  elderly,  children,  and  women,  who  have  less  coping \nresources and are more vulnerable, will benefit greatly from the reduction of air emissions.  \n \n2. Improve Environment of Private and Public Institutions. An improved environment for employees and users of facilities \nis a significant positive benefit of energy efficiency investments. Improvements in industrial and nonindustrial (public schools \nand hospitals) lighting, noise, and temperature and air quality conditions have all been found to result from efficiency retrofits. \nImproved lighting in schools has been found to result in improved test scores.  \n \n3.  Develop  the  Energy  Service  Company  (ESCO)  Business  Model.  The  Investment  Program  will  demonstrate  energy-\nsaving  benefits  from  EPP  subprojects  and  extend  finance  to  ESCOs  for  developing  the  business  model  for  middle  users. \nConsidering the large opportunity for energy savings, Guangdong could have about 20 medium-sized ESCOs with about 100 \nemployees each, most in the skilled workers category. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n \nThe average electricity rate in Guangdong is much higher than the national average in recent years. For example, in 2001, the \naverage rate was CNY0.68 per kilowatt hour, compared with a national average of CNY0.51. For industrial users, the rates in \n2001 were higher than all other developed countries except Japan. The province suffered from substantial power shortages in \n2004 and 2005, requiring it to purchase power from other provinces in the southwest of the country, including the Hong Kong \nSpecial Administrative Region. Implementation of the Investment Program would help avoid large electricity price increases by \nreducing the amount of electricity purchased from other provinces.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006.
