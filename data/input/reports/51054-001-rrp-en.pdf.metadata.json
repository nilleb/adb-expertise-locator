The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the \nBanking  Sector  Rehabilitation  and  Financial  Stability  Strengthening  Program,  and  if  the  Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe TA. \n \n2. \nThe  Government  of  Mongolia  has  requested  financial  assistance  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in the form of a PBL to stabilize and restructure the banking industry, \nstrengthen financial  stability,  and enhance  competition among  banks. The program  aligns  with \nand supports the government\u2019s Economic Recovery Program (ERP) and was requested by the \nMinister of Finance in the development policy letter in Appendix 3.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDevelopment challenges. The government faces two interrelated challenges: restoring \neconomic growth and reviving the banking industry. Mongolia\u2019s economy has deteriorated as it is \nhighly dependent on its mining industry and is vulnerable to shocks. Mineral exports have declined \ndue  to  falling  commodity  prices  and  moderating  growth  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China, \nMongolia\u2019s largest trading partner. The growth rate of its gross domestic product (GDP) fell from \n17.5% in 2011 to 1.0% in 2016, and the fiscal deficit rose from 5.0% of GDP in 2015 to 15.4% of \nGDP  in  2016,  amounting  to  MNT3,667.8  billion. As  a  result,  the  ratio  of  public  debt  to  GDP, \nexcluding  central  bank  liabilities  and  state-owned  enterprise  debt,  rose  from  31.0%  in  2010  to \n83.1%  in  2016.  Consequently,  Moody\u2019s  Investors  Service  Singapore  Pte  Ltd.  downgraded \nMongolia\u2019s credit rating to Caa1 in November 2016.2 \n \n4. \nThe  government  responded  quickly  by  passing  the  ERP  in  2016. The  ERP  aims  to  (i) \nreduce balance-of-payment pressures; (ii) increase foreign exchange reserves; (iii) intensify the \nimplementation of infrastructure projects; and (iv) implement strategies to increase foreign direct \ninvestment,  job  growth,  and  economic  diversification.  However,  weaknesses  in  the  banking \nsystem have constrained government efforts to restore macroeconomic stability and growth. High \nlevels  of  nonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  impede  financial  intermediation  and  reduce  the  banking \nindustry\u2019s capacity to increase private sector credit and support job creation. Unless addressed \nquickly, elevated NPL levels will continue to depress financial intermediation and credit growth, \njeopardize the ERP\u2019s implementation, continue the gridlock in markets like property, detract from \nfinance sector development, and further heighten bank vulnerabilities. \n \n5. \nSlowing economic growth, combined with increases in the central bank\u2019s policy rate, has \nreduced loan growth.3 Moreover, declining GDP is depressing business conditions, leading to a \nrise in bank NPLs and threatening the solvency of banks. The banking industry\u2019s aggregate NPL \n\n                                                \n1  Government of Mongolia. 2016. Economic Recovery Program, 2016\u20132020. Ulaanbaatar. The government passed \n\nthe ERP on 24 November 2016. \n\n2  Moody's  downgraded  the  government's  long-term  issuer  and  senior  unsecured  ratings  from  B3  to  Caa1  on  18 \nNovember  2016.  Caa1  refers  to  a  country\u2019s  long-term  foreign  currency  credit  rating,  and  is  considered  non-\ninvestment grade and speculative. \n\n3  The volume of loans declined by 1% during 2014\u20132016. \n\n\fratio increased from 3.8% in June 2013 to 8.5% in December 20164 (15.0% when past due loans \nare  incorporated).5  Compounding  this  problem,  the  currency  declined  25.3  percentage  points \nagainst the United States (US) dollar in 2016, exposing additional financial vulnerabilities. The \nMongolian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry has reported a rising number of small \nand  medium-sized  enterprise  (SME)  bankruptcies  due  to  increased  debt  service  requirements \nfrom loans made in US dollars. In 2016, about 19% of banking system loans were denominated \nin a foreign currency as banks often preferred to lend to SMEs in US dollars to maximize interest \nmargins and help balance foreign currency open positions. \n \n6. \nOverall,  weak  oversight  encouraged  regulatory  forbearance  and  the  underreporting  of \nrisks,  primarily  of  NPLs,  because  of  lenient  restructuring  policies  and  noncompliance  with \ninternational  capital  standards. This  has resulted  in the  overstatement  of  the reported  banking \nindustry consolidated total capital adequacy ratio that stood at 18.5% as of the end of 2016. The \nloan loss provision covers only 44.8% of NPLs and past due loans, relative to the international \nbest  practice of  100.0%,  and return  on  assets  was only  0.7% for  2016, which is  insufficient to \ncover additional provisioning and capital augmentation.6 \n \n7. \nEmpirical  evidence  shows  strong  links  between  finance  sector  development,  economic \ngrowth,  and  poverty  alleviation.7 Lessons  from  the  1997\u20131998 Asian  financial  crisis  show  that \nrapid NPL resolution is essential to strengthen credit flows and hasten economic recovery. Higher \nlevels of NPLs reduce credit-to-GDP ratios, lower growth, and increase unemployment.8 Financial \ninclusion impediments may stem from concerns regarding access to credit, the depth of the credit \nmarket, and inefficient credit intermediation. When blockages arise in these areas, financing for \nindividuals, SMEs, and entrepreneurs is impaired most due to their perceived higher credit risk. \nThe resulting inequality and inefficiency in credit allocation will negatively impact economic growth \nand thus hamper inclusive growth. The ultimate result is reduced credit relative to GDP. The credit-\nto-GDP gap, which is the difference between the credit-to-GDP ratio and its long-term trend, is a \nuseful  early  warning  indicator  for  banking  crises.9  The  deterioration  in  credit  intermediation  in \nMongolia is outlined in Table 1, which shows the credit-to-GDP gap for Mongolia and indicates \nthe downward trend in credit supply during the period when NPLs increased from 5.3% in 2013 \nto 8.5% in 2016, reflecting the banking industry crisis. \n \n\nTable 1: Ratio of Credit to Gross Domestic Product \n(%) \n\n  \nCredit-to-GDP ratio (actual) \nCredit-to-GDP trend (estimate) \nCredit-to-GDP ratio gap \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource:  Asian  Development  Bank  estimates;  Bank \nhttp://www.bis.org/statistics/c_gaps.htm. \n \n\n2013 \n61.6 \n64.0 \n (2.4) \n\n2014 \n59.7 \n61.0 \n (1.4) \n\n2015 \n50.3 \n52.1 \n (1.8) \n\nfor \n\nInternational  Settlements.

Basel. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\n8. \nBinding  constraints.  Mongolia\u2019s finance  sector is facing  three  major challenges.  First, \nthe government  does  not  have a framework for resolving  the  high level  of  NPLs  in banks that \njeopardize their solvency and has not developed a bank rehabilitation framework to facilitate bank \nrecapitalization.  The  lack  of  an  out-of-court  corporate  debt-restructuring  arrangement  further \nconstrains stabilization efforts. Second, the financial stability framework is not robust enough to \nprevent  possible  crises.  The  relevant  law  and  supporting  regulations  of  the  Financial  Stability \nCouncil  (FSC)  do  not  fully  address  its  mandate,  membership,  authority,  tools,  and  powers \nneeded.10 Further, widespread nonconformance with international capital adequacy and banking \nsupervision standards impair banks\u2019 capacity to sustain shocks. Weak supervisory oversight and \nregulatory  forbearance  practices  by  the  Bank  of  Mongolia  (BOM)  have  resulted  in  banks \nrescheduling  past  due  loans  and  NPLs  too  leniently,  while  the  deposit  insurance  fund  lacks \nbackup  funding  to  support  possible  claims.  Third,  banking  competition  and  development  are \nimpaired.  Weak  governance  and  risk  management  practices  and  a  lack  of  strategic  direction \nimpede the creation of a competitive environment that meets the private sector\u2019s needs and will \nattract human and financial capital. Government ownership of the State Bank LLC also creates \ngovernance and development issues that impede competition and the development of expanded \nproducts  and  services,  as  government  interests  unduly  influence  the  bank\u2019s  operations. 11 \nRegulations  do  not  clearly  support  the  licensing  and  operation  of  foreign  bank  subsidiaries, \nimpairing competition, access to credit, and the transfer of best practices in risk management. \n \n9. \nGovernment  plans  and  alignment  with  ADB  strategy.  Following  the  June  2016 \nelections, the government passed the ERP to promote foreign direct investment, job growth, and \neconomic  diversification.  With  regard  to  finance,  the  ERP  (i)  aims  to  strengthen  sector \ngovernance, (ii) includes legal and institutional reforms to ensure the BOM\u2019s independence, (iii) \nprovides for the revision of the foreign exchange law and FSC functions and authority, and (iv) \ncalls for the preparation of a finance development plan through 2025. \n \n10. \nThe government has not formally defined a distinct national finance policy; however, the \nnational  development  strategy,  2008\u20132021  calls  for  strengthening  the  banking  and  financial \nsystem consistent with practices found in highly developed countries.12 Key activities include (i) \nstrengthening the nonbanking financial system and operations, (ii) developing the securities and \ncapital  market,  and  (iii)  strengthening  risk  management  in  banking  and  financial  institutions. \nMongolia\u2019s  Sustainable  Development  Vision  2030  also  aims  to  establish  sound  development \nfinance and a financial market that would promote stable economic growth, increase the role of \nnonbank financial institutions, and stabilize the soundness of financial institutions.13 The program \naligns  closely  with the first  pillar  of ADB\u2019s  proposed  country  partnership strategy  for  Mongolia, \nwhich  promotes  economic  growth  and  social  stability.14 It  is  consistent  with  the ADB  Strategy \n\n                                                \n10 The FSC was established in January 2010 by an amendment to the Law on the Bank of Mongolia and a regulation \nissued in  April  2010.  The  council  members  are  the  minister  of  finance,  governor  of  the  BOM  and  the  Ministry  of \nFinance (MOF), the BOM, and the chair of the Financial Regulatory Commission. The FSC identifies and monitors \nsystemic  risks,  and  proposes  actions  to  mitigate  these  risks  to  protect  and  enhance  the  resilience  of  Mongolia\u2019s \nfinancial system. \n\n11 The State Bank was established by the government from the assets of two failed banks in 2009, and it assumed the \nassets of the failed Savings Bank in 2013; it is the fifth-largest of 14 banks in Mongolia with a 10% deposit share. \nThe assets of the top five banks comprise 83% of total banking industry assets. \n\n12 Government  of  Mongolia.  2007.

ADB has extensively coordinated the objectives of \nthis program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. On 19 February \n2017,  the  IMF  reached  staff-level  agreement  with  the  government  on  a  3-year  extended  fund \nfacility.  The  program  is  consistent  with  the  IMF\u2019s  recommendations  and  will  support  the \nrecapitalization  and  restructuring  of  the  banking  industry,  enhance  regulation  and  supervision, \nand improve governance. The program is also consistent with the World Bank\u2019s plans to support \nfinancial  stability  and  the  finance  sector  by  developing  the  capacity  of  the  Deposit  Insurance \nCorporation of Mongolia (DICOM). \n \n\nContributions of Previous ADB Assistance to the Program \n\n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \na  ADB. 2016.

ADB\u2019s  strength  lies  in  its  experience  in  deep \npolicy  engagement,  lending  operations,  and  extensive  capacity  development  in  finance.  In \nparticular, ADB assistance has focused on supporting a stable finance sector and providing the \n                                                \n15 ADB.  2008.

ADB has also contributed to economic \ndiversity and mitigated the risk exposures affecting SMEs and the poor. Prior ADB assistance for \nfinance sector reform set a foundation for the outputs of this program (Figure).16 ADB provided \nthe basic outline for the establishment of an NPL resolution mechanism, promoted a framework \nfor financial consumer protection, enhanced the stability of savings and credit cooperatives, and \nexpanded the capacity of the FSC secretariat function located within the BOM. ADB supported \nefforts to restructure banks; establish a bank deposit insurance system; and strengthen banking \nlegislation  and  regulations,  including  expanding  the  BOM\u2019s  capacity,  banking  industry \ngovernance, and risk management. ADB has also promoted capital market development and the \nexpansion  of  inclusive  financial  services  for  the  poor.  Finally, ADB  has  extensively  supported \nprivate sector development through onlending programs to Khan Bank, Xac Bank, and TenGer \nFinancial Group LLC, which helped finance micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. \n \n13. \nLessons learned. The program builds on lessons learned from prior ADB engagement in \nMongolia\u2019s finance sector and from the experience of dealing with past finance sector crises in \ndeveloping  markets  across Asia. A  key  lesson  is  to  support  processes  through  a  sequenced \napproach over time, whereby current outputs result from prior policy and capacity development \nwork with counterparts. Prior engagement has helped guide the government\u2019s efforts, leading to \nthe financial infrastructure and policy reforms that this program supports. A second lesson is the \nneed  for  a  realistic  policy  framework  with  manageable  policy  actions  to  achieve  the  intended \nresults and successfully implement the reforms. \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe  program  aligns  with  the  ERP  and  will  support  the  government\u2019s  plans  for  a  well-\ndeveloped  finance  sector  and  stable  financial  system  that  helps  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  The \noutcome will be a strengthened and stable banking industry. Stabilizing the industry by dealing \nrapidly with the large NPL overhang is the first step towards rehabilitation. As the program is a \nsingle  tranche, ADB  and  the  government  have  agreed  on  a  medium-term  reform  framework, \n2017\u20132020 to provide a basis for continuing reforms and structure for future assistance. There \nare 12 policy actions with seven linked to disbursement. All policy actions are complied with or \nare expected to be completed by June 2017. \n \nC. \n \n15. \nOutput  1:  Framework  for  bank  restructuring  completed.  Output  1  will  support  an \neffective restructuring of the banking industry and a reduction in NPLs. To accomplish this, the \ngovernment will develop a transparent road map for a banking  industry rehabilitation program, \nand  will  create and  initially  capitalize  an  asset  management  company  (AMC).  Effective private \nmarket solutions are lacking because the high level of unresolved NPLs exceeds the absorptive \ncapacity  of  the  domestic  illiquid  capital  market.  Banks  often  lack  the  capacity  to  handle  large \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2016.

Centralized AMCs achieve economies of scale and allow \nfor the more effective management and sale of distressed assets. Moreover, the legal and capital \nmarket\u2019s framework in Mongolia is challenging and impedes banks\u2019 ability to resolve NPLs rapidly. \nIn  this  context,  a  government-supported  AMC  has  advantages  based  on  the  following  special \npowers,  which  will  be  granted  to  it  by  law:  (i)  legislation  will  ensure  that  AMC  operations  are \nefficient, transparent, and market-based to maximize NPL recovery values; (ii) AMC management \nand  staff  will  be  given  immunity  and  legal  protection  in  the  operation  of  their  duties;  and  (iii) \nmechanisms to enable the clear transfer of distressed assets will be included. \n \n16. \nThe AMC  will  acquire  eligible  NPLs  from  commercial  banks  at  values  determined  by  a \nrigorous and transparent methodology17 (these will be lower than the book values to reflect the \nNPLs\u2019  deteriorated  condition).  The  AMC  will  manage  this  portfolio  of  assets,  take  steps  to \nmaximize their recovery values, and sell them over time. The government will also support the \ncreation of a corporate debt restructuring committee (CDRC) to deal with the large debt burden \nthrough  an  inter-creditor  agreement.  A  CDRC  provides  a  platform  for  corporations  and  their \nlenders to work out feasible debt resolutions without resorting to legal proceedings or bankruptcy. \nThe  out-of-court  arrangement  found  in  an  inter-creditor  agreement  enables  eligible  distressed \ncorporations  to  resolve  their  nonperforming  obligations  uniformly  across  multiple  lenders. The \nprocess facilitates the timely and orderly restructuring of debt to support firms that have a viable \nbusiness model but are experiencing a temporary downturn. \n \n17. \nOutput  2:  Financial  stability  enhanced.  Output  2  will  enhance  financial  stability  and \noversight to prevent problems from recurring. The government will amend the law governing FSC \noperations to clarify its mandate, authority, and tools; and will expand the FSC\u2019s membership to \ninclude  the  DICOM. The  output  will  also  support  stronger  oversight  of  the  banking  industry  to \ndiscourage  regulatory  forbearance.  The  BOM  will  restructure  its  supervision  department  and \namend regulations to bring banking practices into compliance with international standards. Finally, \nthe  government  will  expand  the  DICOM\u2019s  capacity  to  deal  with  possible  bank  insolvencies  by \nproviding financing for the potential payout of deposit claims. \n \n18. \nOutput  3:  Competition  and  governance  strengthened.  Output  3  will  strengthen \ngovernance, risk management, and banking industry competition to protect the finance sector\u2019s \ndevelopment and attract foreign capital and expertise. The government will improve the sector\u2019s \ncapacity and governance to meet its functional needs better, as well as those of individuals and \ncorporations  by  formulating  a  financial  market  development  program.  It  will  also  expand \ncompetition and the banking industry\u2019s potential to adopt best practices in risk management by \nclarifying the regulations supporting (i) the licensing and regulation of foreign bank subsidiaries, \nand (ii) the privatization of the State Bank. \n \nD. \n \n19. \nThe government has requested a regular loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the program (Table 2). The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace  period  of  3 years;  an  annual  interest  rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  Based  on  the  straight-line \nmethod, the average maturity is 9.25 years and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n                                                \n17 Eligible NPLs exclude those that will be resolved in a CDRC process and those that are not commercially viable to \n\nbe managed by the AMC due to their small size or unique characteristics not allowing for economies of scale. \n\n\f7 \n\n \n20. \nThe loan proceeds will finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local taxes and \nduties) of the items procured, excluding ineligible items and imports on the negative list attached \nto the loan agreement. The loan size was determined based on the importance of supporting the \nERP, the extent of the fiscal gap, the level of NPLs and past due loans needing resolution, and \nMongolia\u2019s overall development financing needs. Given the country\u2019s challenging fiscal condition, \nthe  use  of  budget  support  is  justified.  Specifically,  the  loan  proceeds  will  support  the  AMC\u2019s \nfunding and capitalization needs and help it purchase a share of eligible NPLs and past due loans. \nBonds  issued  by  the AMC  and exchanged  with banks for  the transferred assets  will  cover  the \nremaining funding needs. \n \n\nTable 2: Investment and Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n\nOrdinary capital resources (loan) \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nAmount ($ million) \n \n100.0 \n100.0 \n\nShare of Total (%) \n \n100.0 \n100.0 \n\n \n21. \nProposed financing modality. ADB proposed a single-tranche, stand-alone PBL, as the \nscope  and  timing  for  potential  future  assistance  will  be  identified  only  after  the  result  of  this \nprogram and the impact of the IMF\u2019s program are known. The PBL will help the government create \nan AMC that will help banks deal with the large NPL overhang. ADB will not assume risk from the \npurchased  NPLs,  which  will  be  managed  independently  under  market  practices  through  the \ncreation  of  an  AMC  and  CDRC.  Mongolia\u2019s  payment  obligations  under  the  ADB  loan  are \nindependent  of  the  NPL  collection  or  the AMC\u2019s  performance.  Should  banks  ultimately  require \nrecapitalization,  private  commercial  banks  are  expected  to  be  fully  supported  by  their \nshareholders.  The  program  combines  dialogue  with  TA  in  recognition  of  ADB\u2019s  long-term \nengagement in developing Mongolia\u2019s finance sector. The program is urgently needed to manage \nrising banking risks and prevent a systemic crisis that could threaten the economy, further reduce \nGDP growth prospects, and harm the poor and vulnerable even more. ADB and the government \nhave agreed on a medium-term reform framework, 2017\u20132020 to provide the basis for continuing \nreforms and the structure for future assistance. \n \nE. \n \n22. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  will  oversee  and \ncoordinate the  timely  implementation  of  the  policy  actions.  The  BOM  will  be  the  implementing \nagency  and  will  implement  certain  policy  actions  under  the  PBL.  MOF  will  withdraw  the  loan \nproceeds in line with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) \nonce ADB  is  satisfied  that  the  agreed  policy  actions  have  been  completed.  The  program  will \nsupport a policy framework with corresponding outputs and policy actions (Appendix 4). Of the \nprogram\u2019s 12 policy actions, seven are linked to disbursement and the rest are complementary \nactions that  reflect  the  progressive  steps  taken  to  achieve  the  overall  policy  action  objectives. \nThey aim to reflect more holistically the government\u2019s commitments to reform. The government \nwill maintain or advance the policy actions at least through December 2019. ADB may consider a \nfollow-on program based on the progress of the reforms and the development financing needs. \nThe program period is 1 July 2015\u201330 June 2017. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n23. \nThe  program  will  be  supported  by  TA  grants  in  the  amount  of  $1,600,000,  of  which \n$750,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-\n6)  and  $750,000  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Financial  Sector  Development \nPartnership Special Fund.18 ADB will engage TA consultants through a firm. Selection will follow \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended from  time  to time)  using  the \nquality-  and  cost-based  method,  with  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  90:10,  following  a  full  technical \nproposal.  ADB  will  disburse  TA  resources  following  its  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  government  will  provide  counterpart \nsupport in the form of staff, access to data and documents, facilities for key meetings, and other \nin-kind contributions. The MOF will be the executing agency and the BOM will be the implementing \nagency. The TA is estimated to begin in July 2017 and will be implemented over 24 months.19 The \nTA will provide 48 international and 31 national person-months of consulting services. The TA will \nhelp establish and operationalize the AMC, and will create a transparent and effective oversight \nand  governance  process  that  supports  the AMC\u2019s  independent  operations,  free  from  external \npolitical influences and vested interests. The TA will also establish and guide the operations of an \nout-of-court corporate debt-restructuring framework to address the corporate debt burden through \nthe Mongolian Bankers Association, with the BOM\u2019s support. Finally, the TA will guide and support \nthe government in privatizing the State Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n24. \nEconomic. Through support for NPL resolution mechanisms including the creation of an \nAMC,  the  program  will  improve  prospects  for  GDP  growth,  employment  and  credit  extension. \nProgram support will help the banking industry reduce the volume of NPLs, which will then allow \nbanks to reduce risks and raise capital adequacy levels, enabling them to extend new credit more \nfreely. Expanding credit availability will positively impact employment and income. The benefits \nwill accrue to all Mongolians.  Applicable research by the IMF shows that, other things being equal, \na one percentage point increase in NPLs results in a cumulative decline of 1.5 percentage points \nin  the  credit-to-GDP  ratio,  and  a  cumulative  increase  of  nearly  0.5  percentage  points  in \nunemployment  (over  a  3-year  horizon). Also,  a  one  percentage  point  rise  in  NPLs  leads  to  a \ncumulative contraction of 1.3 percentage points in real GDP over 2 years. 20 \n \n25. \nFinancial management. Procyclical fiscal management and the misalignment of public \nexpenditure  and  strategic  priorities  are  two  major  public  financial  management  challenges  in \nMongolia. The government has put certain actions in place to provide strategic guidance for the \nannual budget process and reduce vulnerability to the boom\u2013bust economic cycle; however, these \nhave  been  ineffective  due  to  poor  windfall  revenue  management  and  frequent  amendments \naffecting budget expenditure. The comprehensiveness of information included in the budget, its \npublic  disclosure,  and  citizen  participation  have  improved,  but  recent  increases  in  off-budget \nexpenditures and limited oversight of fiscal risks in state-owned enterprises undermine progress.  \nThe  IMF-led  program  will  help  improve  public  financial  management  by  preventing  the \ngovernment from engaging in quasi-fiscal activity, creating a fiscal council to provide independent \nbudget forecasts and costings of new policy proposals, allowing the government sole authority to \n\n                                                \n18 Established by ADB, with the Government of Luxembourg as a financing partner. \n19 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Ibid 8. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nGovernance \n\nPoverty and Social \n\ndetermine the total amount of spending in the budget, and granting MOF the authority to approve \nproposals  to  the  cabinet  that  have  a  budgetary  cost.  Due  diligence  relied  on  the  2015  public \nfinancial  management  assessment  completed  by  the  World  Bank. 21  ADB  confirmed  that  the \nresults of the assessment remain valid for this program and that no specific mitigating measures \nare needed. The MOF has sufficient financial management capabilities and is familiar with ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement  requirements,  social  and  environmental  safeguards,  and  negative  list.  Financial \nmanagement assessments in 2015 for ADB-funded projects have also deemed the MOF capable \nof acting as an executing agency.22 \n \nB. \n \n26. \nGovernance. Mongolia has taken steps to improve accountability and transparency in the \npublic sector. The Independent Authority Against Corruption has implemented public education \ncampaigns. Reporting coverage of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in Mongolia is \nalso expanding. Despite these efforts, corruption continues to threaten the development of the \nMongolian economy.23 Major corruption risks include weak institutions and enforcement, lack of \ncapacity of integrity institutions, political interference, lack of transparency and accountability, and \nthe  prevalence  of  conflicts  of  interest.  The  policy  actions  under  the  IMF-led  program  and \nmonitoring  indicators  would  ensure  strict  compliance  with  the  program  objectives  and  thereby \nminimize  risks. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government. \n \nC. \n \n27. \nThe  economic  slowdown  in  Mongolia  has  reduced  employment  opportunities,  lowered \nincome, delayed loan repayment, weakened loan access, depreciated the currency, decreased \nbank loan growth, and increased lending rates. It has also constrained access to credit, which is \na key factor affecting the creation of new jobs and employment. Mongolian poverty data shows \nthat the percentage of the population living in poverty declined from 27.4% in 2012 to 21.6% in \n2014; however, the data also show a significant clustering of households near the poverty line, \nindicating  that  many  people  are  vulnerable  to  falling  back  into  poverty  because  of  shocks  or \nprolonged economic stress.24 Poor households cope by (i) reducing food consumption and quality, \n(ii) limiting health expenditure, and (iii) increasing debt (38% of the poor have debt). Access to \ncredit is an important coping strategy, and 82% of the lowest income quintile took out loans almost \nsolely to support household consumption (including food, health and education, and other daily \nlife needs) compared with 49% of the highest quintile.  The program will have a positive impact \non access to credit, and will improve economic growth and employment prospects. Successful \nprogram implementation and a strengthened banking industry will benefit all Mongolians, and the \nunemployed,  poor,  and  vulnerable  in  particular.  In  the  long  term,  the  government\u2019s  plans  will \ninvolve systems for implementing an efficient finance policy that will ultimately benefit the poor \nand  vulnerable  by  developing  a  favorable  business  environment,  increasing  job  opportunities, \nreducing loan interest rates, and expanding the acceptability of loan collateral. \n                                                \n21 World Bank. 2015.
