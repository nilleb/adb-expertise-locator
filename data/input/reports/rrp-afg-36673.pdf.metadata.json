Lack  of  resources  and  of  capacity  prevented \nmaintenance, which led to major deterioration and in some cases loss of \ninfrastructure. This is particularly true for major national roads, power and \nnatural  gas  facilities.  Revival  of  the  economy  of  Afghanistan  and \nresumption of growth depends critically on reconstruction and rehabilitation \nof this key infrastructure, which could contribute to employment creation, \nincome  generation  at  the  household  level,  rehabilitation  of  displaced \npopulations  and  excombatants,  improvement  of  security  and  stability, \ninterethnic reconciliation, and political unification of the country. The Project \nwill  contribute  to  reviving  the  economic  activities  across  the  country, \nthereby providing employment and reducing poverty. \n \nObjectives and  The  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  help  the  Islamic  Transitional \nScope  Government of Afghanistan (Government) restore key infrastructure in the \ntransport (roads) and energy (power and gas) sectors.

In addition, the total amount of \nthe interest charge during the grace period will be capitalized and charged \nto the loan account. \n \nPeriod of  Until June 2013 \nUtilization  \nEstimated Project  30 June 2006 \nCompletion Date \nExecuting  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency (EA). The \nAgencies  implementing agencies (IAs) are the Ministry of Public Works for the roads \ninfrastructure component; the Ministry of Water and Power for the power \ninfrastructure component; and the Ministry of Mines and Industries for the \ngas infrastructure component. \n \nImplementation  A project coordination unit will be established within MOF to monitor project \nArrangements  implementation and coordinate with the IAs. MOF will appoint a project \ncoordinator and assign appropriate staff to assist in overseeing project \nactivities.  Overall  a  project  steering  committee  (PSC),  chaired  by  the \ndeputy minister of finance, will provide guidance and approvals. The PSC \nwill consist of the ministers of IAs and will meet at least quarterly to review \nproject  implementation  and  to  resolve,  among  others,  interministerial \ncoordination issues. The project coordinator will also serve as the secretary \nto PSC. \n \nProcurement  Procurement of goods, services and civil works to be financed under the \nProject  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development \nBank\u2019s  (ADB)  Guidelines  for  Procurement,  with  flexible  interpretation, \nwherever essential, as provided under emergency assistance projects. All ", "  iii\ninternational  procurements,  including  other  major  procurements,  will  be \nundertaken  by  the  Procurement  Unit  of  the  Afghanistan  Assistance \nCoordination Authority, under MOF, with assistance from the international \nprocurement  advisor.  Advance  actions  have  been  approved  for \nprocurement of consulting services, civil work contracts under the road \ninfrastructure component, and turnkey contracts under the power and gas \ninfrastructure components. \n \n \nConsulting  Consulting  services  (280  person-months  international  and  500  person-\nServices  months  domestic)  will  be  required  to  assist  the  EA  and  IAs  in  project \nimplementation. All consultants financed under the project will be selected \nand  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  with  the  flexibility,  wherever  essential,  provided  under \nemergency assistance projects. \n \nProject Benefits   The road, power, and gas infrastructure components of the Project will \nand Beneficiaries  benefit approximately 9 million people in seven provinces (Baghlan, Balkh, \nFaryab Jowzjan Kabul, Parvan, and Samangan) in which about 45% are \nliving below $0.25 per capita income per day. The proportion below the $1 \nlevel would be much higher. The direct and indirect impact of the Project \nwill be pro-poor, since the poor will benefit through employment generation \nand increased household income. While the Project will generate short-\nterm  employment  during  the  construction  period,  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  facilities  rehabilitated  under  the  Project  will  generate  \npermanent  employment.  Additional  long-term  employment  will  be \ngenerated  from  increased  production,  trade,  transport,  and  services \nattributable to improved roads, power, and gas supply. There will be both \ndirect employment impact as well as impact through interindustry linkages.  \n \nRisks and  (i) The overall political and security situation remains volatile. ADB will \nAssumptions  continue to closely monitor and coordinate with local and central authorities \nand the United Nation (UN) agencies to ensure adequate protection. (ii) \nUndue delays in implementation of key activities are possible due to the \nGovernment\u2019s weak implementation capacity. Project consultants as well \nas consultants working under the ongoing technical assistance cluster for \ncapacity  building  will  assist  the  EA  and  IAs  in  implementation.  (iii) \nCounterpart resources may be inadequate. ADB will work closely with MOF \nand  IAs  to  ensure  adequate  allocation  of  resources.  (iv)  Roads  may \ndeteriorate  due  to  overloading  and  lack  of  maintenance.  ADB  will \nencourage the Government to make appropriate budgetary resources from \nthe  Postconflict  Multisector  Program  Loan  for  controlling  vehicle \noverloading and carrying out road maintenance. \n \n ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan for the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation \nand Reconstruction Project.1 \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Rehabilitation/Reconstruction \n2.  Much  of  the  infrastructure  in  Afghanistan  has  been  destroyed  or  damaged  by  two \ndecades of war. Lack of resources and capacity prevented maintenance, leading to major \ndeterioration  and  loss  of  infrastructure.  Revival  of  the  economy  depends  critically  on \nreconstruction and rehabilitation of key infrastructure including roads, electric power, and natural \ngas facilities. Such rehabilitation and reconstruction would also contribute towards employment \ncreation, income generation at the household level, rehabilitation of displaced populations and \nexcombatants,  improvement  of  security  and  stability,  interethnic  reconciliation, and  political \nunification of the country. Given the strong political support for this process, and pledges for \nassistance  expressed  by  the  international  community,  it  is  critical  to  urgently  commence \nrehabilitation and reconstruction of vital infrastructure. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n3.  During  December  2001,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme, and the World Bank undertook a preliminary needs assessment \n(PNA), which outlined strategic choices for reconstruction and development, presented the aid \ncommunity with indicative funding requirements, and identified initial priorities supported by cost \nestimates. The PNA covered immediate needs, short-term options, and long-term development \ninitiatives. The PNA report was presented at the Ministerial Meeting of the Steering Committee \nheld  in  Tokyo  in  January  2002,  where  the  funding  agencies  pledged  assistance  of \napproximately $4.5 billion. The meeting also endorsed undertaking of comprehensive needs \nassessments (CNAs) for each sector. Multi-agency missions were mobilized subsequently, and \ndetailed CNA reports2 were prepared based on field surveys and discussions with the relevant \nagencies of the Islamic Transitional Government of Afghanistan. The CNA reports provided the \ninitial database for the funding agencies to develop assistance programs in specific sectors.  \n \n4.  Need to Rehabilitate the Primary Road System. Afghanistan is a landlocked country.  \nWith a large area (of about 652,000 square kilometers) and a population of 26 million widely \nspread across the largely mountainous terrain, roads are the principal means of transport for \ninternal and international traffic. Aside from facilitating urgent humanitarian aid and returning \nrefugees, roads are critical for economic revival and development. The road network comprises \nof about 6,000 kilometers (km) of national roads, of which 3,300 km are primary roads including \n2,400 km roads that were originally paved.  The national primary road network consists largely \nof the 2,227 km ring road (Kabul \u2013 Mazar Sharif \u2013 Sheberghan \u2013 Maymana \u2013 Herat \u2013 Kandahar \n\u2013 Kabul) and links to neighboring countries totaling about 800 km.3 The 615 km Sheberghan \u2013 \nMaymana \u2013 Herat section of the ring road is only partly constructed and is generally unpaved. \nThe secondary and tertiary roads network of about 15,000 km consists of either gravel or \n                                                 \n1  See Project Framework in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB took the lead in preparation of CNA reports for agriculture, environment, education, and transport in 2002 and \ncontributed to the CNA for the energy sector.  \n3  The international links are to Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.  ", "2  \nearthen roads. These roads have not yet been systematically surveyed, though it appears that \nthey are generally in poor condition. The recorded traffic during the preconflict period on the \nprimary network varied between 250 and 1,000 vehicles per day. Recent traffic surveys indicate \nthat the traffic levels have grown fast and have significantly exceeded these figures. However, \nthe road conditions have further deteriorated due to lack of rehabilitation and maintenance. To \nkeep up with increasing traffic volume, promote trade links with neighboring countries, and \nimprove movement of goods and services, thereby fostering trade and commerce, it is essential \nthat the entire primary road network be rehabilitated on a priority basis.  This is also supported \nby the findings of CNA report for the transport sector.  \n \n5.  The Government has declared that reconstruction and rehabilitation of the road network, \nespecially of national primary roads, is the country\u2019s top priority. Improved roads will not only \nfacilitate the physical and political integration of Afghanistan but will also help unify international \nand domestic trade. Rebuilding the road network is also critical to facilitate humanitarian and \ndevelopment assistance. The reconstruction and rehabilitation works will utilize, to the extent \npossible,  labor-intensive  construction  methods  to  provide  much-needed  employment  and \nincome generation opportunities. It will contribute to social stability by engaging, among others, \nrefugees  and  excombatants.  Production,  trade,  and  commerce  will  be  promoted,  thereby \nexpediting economic recovery and growth. A strengthened transport system will serve regional \ninterests, with the possibility of reestablishing Afghanistan as a trade hub, bringing enormous \nbenefits to the country. \n \n6.  Need to Rehabilitate Power Infrastructure. The power infrastructure of Afghanistan \ncomprises mainly three isolated power systems centered around Kabul, Kandahar and Mazar \nSharif cities. Of an estimated 230,000 electricity consumers in the country, about 76,000 are \nlocated in Kabul and its surrounding districts. The entire electric power infrastructure (covering \ngeneration,  transmission,  distribution,  and  consumer  services)  is  in  very  poor  condition, \nresulting in high system losses, poor service, low reliability of supply, and daily load shedding. \nThe Government attaches highest priority to improving the power supply in Kabul.  \n \n7.  The Kabul power system is supplied mainly by four snow-fed hydroelectric plants with an \ninstalled capacity of nearly 200 megawatts (MW)4 but with a firm output of only about 65 MW in \nthe 2003 winter season due to the low availability of water compounded by the age of the \ngenerating plants. In addition, a diesel-fired gas turbine plant, recently rehabilitated with World \nBank assistance, produces a peaking output of 45 MW. The peak load demand of Kabul city \nand its surrounding districts decreased from about 250 MW in 1996 to an estimated 160 MW in \nJanuary  2003,  since  only  about  40%  of  the  network  is  operational,  the  remainder  being \ndamaged. The proposal for rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Kabul distribution network, \ntogether with the ongoing interventions by the World Bank and Kreditanstait f\u1ee7r Wiederaufbau \n(KfW)  will  contribute  an  additional  100  MW  of  peak  load  demand  by  the  end  of  2005. \nConsequently, there is a need in the short term to augment the power supply to Kabul by about \n150 MW to meet the expected load demand of 260 MW. The least\u2013cost option is through import \nof power from neighboring Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan by rehabilitation and reconstruction of \nexisting transmission lines in the north.5  \n                                                 \n4  Darunta (3x4 MW). Mahipar (3x22 MW), Naghlu (4x25 MW), Sarobi (2x11 MW). However, the current combined \nworking capacity is only about 160 MW. After rehabilitation of these four plants, provided by ongoing World Bank \nand European Union assistance, the combined generating output is expected to be restored up to about 200 MW, \nexcept during winter, when the low availability of water limits the combined firm output to about 80 MW. \n5  According to the Ministry of Water and Power, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan have recently signed a 10-year power \npurchase agreement for the import of 150 MW at $0.02 per kilowatt-hour to meet the short-term power supply \nshortfall in Kabul.  ", "  3\n8.  Technical losses are estimated to be about 25% (due to overloading of transmission and \ndistribution equipment and makeshift, substandard overhead conductor and underground cable \njoints), while nontechnical losses (mainly due to pilferage and partly due to lack of reliable \nmetering) are estimated to be as high as 20%. Besides contributing to the very high technical \nlosses, exposed cable joints pose considerable safety risks to the public, especially during \nwinter and rainy season, when the danger of electrocution for those walking accidentally into the \nvicinity of such joints is greatly increased. Hence, in addition to an urgent need to rehabilitate \nand reconstruct the Kabul distribution system to reduce system losses and ensure best use of \nthe available power supply, there is also the need to minimize electrical hazards.  \n \n9.  Da  Afghanistan  Brishna  Moassesa  (DABM),  constituted  under  a  special  act,  is \nresponsible  for  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  of  electricity  in  Afghanistan.  A \npresident who reports to the deputy minister of the Ministry of Water and Power (MWP) heads \nDABM, which has about 5,200 staff but lacks technical skills and access to modern technology \nincluding computers and communication equipment. During the conflict period, maintenance \nand repairs could not be undertaken on the power generation, transmission, and distribution \nsystems. This was exacerbated by non-availability of spare parts, tools, and testing equipment. \nAccordingly, staff morale and productivity is low. There is an urgent need to strengthen the \ncapacity of DABM, particularly in project design and management, asset management, load \ndispatching, accounting, billing, revenue collection, and operation and maintenance (O&M). \n \n10.  Need to Rehabilitate Gas Infrastructure. Gas is produce at Sheberghan and is utilized \nlargely in Mazar Sharif. Eight gas fields were discovered in the northern part of the country, of \nwhich three were developed, and gas production first commenced in 1967. In the earlier years, \nmost of the country\u2019s gas production was exported to the Former Soviet Union based on an 18-\nyear  agreement.  The  export  of  gas  ended  in  1987  with  the  end  of  Soviet  domination  in \nAfghanistan, whereafter the export agreement was not renewed. The gas availability is grossly \ninadequate to meet the current requirements mainly due to loss of production facilities and high \nrate of leakage. Gas leakage represents not only a loss of revenue but also a major safety \nhazard. The immediate problems facing the gas subsector in Afghanistan relate to (i) lack of \nequipment, spare parts, and material to maintain the integrity of operations; (ii) inadequate \nresources  for  repair  and  rehabilitation  of  production  wells,  gas  processing  plant,  and \ntransmission and distribution pipelines; (iii) lack of expertise in geological and geophysical \nassessment of gas fields, including gas field management and reservoir depletion; and (iv) \nabsence  of  corrosion  prevention  and  cathodic  protection  of  gathering  mains  and  the \ntransmission and distribution network. The quality of gas from some of the producing wells is not \nsuitable for fertilizer production due to high hydrogen sulfide content in particular zones, and \nneeds to be purified prior to transmission. The gas processing plant installed by the Russians \nfor removal of hydrogen sulfide is not operating. The current gas production is about 830,000 \ncubic meters per day, of which 250,000 cubic meters per day leaks to the atmosphere. Present \ngas production is less than one fourth of the level produced in the early 1980s. For domestic \nconsumption of gas, transmission pipelines were built from Sheberghan to Mazar Sharif, located \nat a distance of about 135 km. The consumers in the two cities and smaller towns and villages \nin the vicinity of the transmission lines are connected through distribution lines. The present \nnetwork serves (i) a fertilizer factory including a 48 MW gas\u2013fired thermal power plant at the \nfactory site; (ii) the commercial sector such as bakeries, a textile factory, food processing plant, \netc.; and (iii) domestic consumers for heating and cooking. Gas supply to domestic consumers \nis not metered, and tariff collection rate is very low. \n \n11.  There is need to optimize the use of indigenous natural gas and reduce dependence on \npetroleum fuel. The increased supply of natural gas will also help curtail the demand for fuel ", "4  \nwood, thereby reducing deforestation. At present, fuel wood accounts for about 75% of total \nenergy supplies, and constitutes the basic source of energy for cooking and heating for the bulk \nof the population residing in rural areas. Rehabilitation and development of the existing gas \ninfrastructure will mitigate environmental and safety hazards, reduce ecological problems, and \npromote efficiency of natural gas use. Accordingly, the Government has given a high priority to \nthe rehabilitation and development of natural gas as a significant source of energy in the \ncountry. \n \nC.  Social Dimension and Impact on Poverty \n12.  Security and stability are critical for the recovery and development of Afghanistan. The \nGovernment is making efforts to establish the rule of law, bring provincial and local authorities \nunder central control, build a national army and police force, and extend the tenure and expand \nthe role of international security forces. Improved security and stability are necessary for further \nprogress in infrastructure rehabilitation and reconstruction. \n \n13.  Poverty is endemic in Afghanistan. A large proportion of the population lived below any \nacceptable poverty line even prior to the civil conflict. The conflict has left them poorer, and new \ngroups have joined the ranks of the poor. These include small and marginal farmers, especially \nin the rain\u2013fed, arid, and semiarid regions with irrigation systems in disrepair and many fields \nstill  inaccessible  due  to  mine  infestation;  landless  workers  in  the  agriculture  sector;  wage \nearners; nomadic populations whose herds have been decimated; returning refugees; internally \ndisplaced populations; ex-combatants; the disabled; as well as settled population groups in rural \nareas  facing  food  needs  as  defined  by  the  World  Food  Program  (WFP).6  According  to  a \npreliminary estimate undertaken by ADB, about 53% of the population live below the poverty \nline of $90 per capita per annum in 2002 prices, which is sufficient to meet the minimum energy \nrequirement7 and an additional 30% allowance for nonfood items (see Supplementary Appendix \nA).  The  challenges  of  poverty  reduction  and  reintegration  of  the  displaced  population  are \nmultifaceted, and a strong foundation is needed for all\u2013round economic growth. \n \nD.  External Assistance and Aid Coordination \n14.  The  pledges  made  by  the  aid  agencies  at  the  first  conference  on  recovery  and \nreconstruction of Afghanistan, held in Tokyo in January 2002, took some time to be realized into \nspecific  assistance  projects.  While  there  is  significant  assistance  in  the  road  sector  by \nmultilaterals  (ADB,  World  Bank,  and  European  Commission)  and  bilaterals  (United  States, \nJapan,  Saudi  Arabia,  Italy,  Sweden,  Iran,  and  Pakistan),  only  a  few  agencies  (Germany, \nEuropean Commission, World Bank, and ADB) are providing assistance in the power sector. \nWith the exception of ADB, there is no external support for the gas sector. See Appendix 2 for \ndetails.  \n \n15.  Within the Government, the Afghan Assistance Coordination Authority (AACA) continues \nto play a strong role in coordinating external assistance in Afghanistan. The Government has \ntaken  three  initiatives  to  improve  aid  coordination.  First,  the  funding  agencies  have  been \nrequested to focus on specific (three) sectors. Second, the Government has established local \nlevel aid agency\u2013government consultative groups covering 12 national development programs \n                                                 \n6  The WFP food needs assessment is based on a minimum per capita daily requirement of 2100 kcal. \n7   WFP. 2002.

Therefore the \npercentage of population living below $1 per day per capita would be much higher, maybe as much as 60-80%. ", "  5\n(NDPs)8 and four crosscutting advisory groups for gender, environment, humanitarian affairs, \nand human rights, with one designated external agency acting as the focal point. Third, the \nfunding  agency\u2013government  forum  will  be  moving  from  the  implementation  group  (IG) \nframework to a government-led consultative group (CG) process. ADB is the focal point for \ntransport, natural resource management and environment. ADB is also a member of two other \nCGs covering energy, mining, and telecommunication; and public administration and economic \nmanagement.  ADB  staff  are  actively  engaged  in  the  proceedings  of  the  CGs,  and  the \ncomponents for the proposed Project were developed in close consultation with other external \nagencies at the CG meetings.   \n \nE.  Afghanistan\u2019s National Development Framework and Budget \n16.  The goal of the Government\u2019s National Development Framework (NDF) is to provide a \nstrategic plan for the development of Afghanistan, around which all actors can unite, to address \npoverty and provide economic opportunity through a series of concrete programs and projects. \nThe NDF is based on five principles: (i) the development strategy must be domestically owned, \nwith the Government in the driver\u2019s seat; (ii) markets and the private sector are more effective \ninstruments than the state in delivering sustained growth; (iii) aid cannot be effective without the \nstate investing in human capital and the creation of an institutional framework that allows the \nrule of law to prevail; (iv) promotion of sustainable economic growth requires active participation \nof the population; and (v) externally funded investments must be anchored in the Government\u2019s \ndevelopment program to be successful over the longer term. The NDF focuses on three pillars \nof development: (i) security and human development, (ii) rebuilding physical infrastructure, and \n(iii) enabling the creation of a viable private sector as the engine for sustainable and inclusive \neconomic  growth.  Restoring  security  and  reestablishing  law  and  order,  administrative  and \nfinancial reforms, and gender development are crosscutting priorities. The key challenges and \npriorities in the short term are to quickly establish basic security for the population, revitalize \nagriculture, facilitate private economic activity, and rebuild infrastructure and social services. \nThe national development budget (NDB) translates the priorities of the NDF into programs and \nprojects while simultaneously providing a vehicle for policy development. It provide an outline of \nongoing and proposed investments within the NDF. The development budget for FY2004 was \ndeveloped through the CG process and was presented at the Afghanistan Development Forum \nmeeting held in Kabul in March 2003. \n \nF.  ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update \n \n17.  The objective of the Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for Afghanistan (2002-2004) \nwas to assist the Government in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the country to ensure a \nseamless transition from humanitarian to reconstruction and development assistance. The CSP \nwas  endorsed  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  in  May  2002,  paving  the  way  for  delivery  of \nassistance earmarked for 2002. Since then ADB has approved the $150 million Postconflict \nMultisector Program Loan (PMPL)9 and grant\u2013financed technical assistance (TA) and other \nnonlending operations totaling $37 million including a $14.5 million capacity\u2013building technical \n                                                 \n8  (i) Refugee Return; (ii) Education; (iii) Health and Nutrition; (iv) Livelihood and Social Protection; (v) Culture, \nHeritage, Media, and Sports; (vi) Transport and Telecommunications; (vii) Urban Management; (viii) Energy and \nMining; (ix) Natural Resource Management; (x) Trade and Private Investment; (xi) Public Administration; and (xii) \nSecurity and Rule of Law. \n9  ADB. 2002.

An update of the CSP covering 2003 \u2013 2005 program has been circulated for Board \nconsideration.  The  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (CSPU)  follows  the  overriding \nobjective of the CSP, and focuses on agriculture, transport, and energy sector based upon a \nnumber of considerations, including (i) the 12 NDPs and six national priority subprograms \nidentified by the NDB, (ii) the government\u2019s expressed wish to limit each aid agency to three \nsectors,  (iii)  ADB\u2019s  comparative  advantage,  and  (iv)  ADB  and  other  funding  agencies\u2019 \noperational experience in Afghanistan. \n \nG.  Lessons Learned \n \n19.  A number of lessons can be drawn from past emergency assistance projects, best \npractices, and initial lending and nonlending operations of ADB in Afghanistan in 2002. First, the \nstrategic focus of ADB operations has to be closely linked to the Government\u2019s own strategies \nand priorities. Second, continued emphasis has to be given on capacity building to improve \nplanning, project design and implementation, administration, and financial management. The \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) has successfully launched both the ordinary and the development \nbudget. Systems are being put in place for fiscal accounting and transparency. Third, to the \nextent feasible, external funds should be channeled through the budget so that resources made \navailable  by  the  international  community  can  be  appropriately  accounted  for.  Fourth,  aid \ncoordination through AACA/CGs is extremely important for avoiding duplication and delays. \nFifth, aid groups must work closely with MOF and the central bank to develop a viable and \nworking payment system, without which funds flow has remained a difficult undertaking. Sixth, \ncapacity building of executing agencies is vital, and consulting services for project design and \nimplementation should have provision for training the EA staff in O&M of rehabilitated facilities. \nSeventh,  the  number  of  procurement  packages  should  be  minimized,  keeping  in  view  the \nimplementation capacity of the EAs. Eighth, ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines should be flexibly \napplied for emergency assistance projects to allow reduced procurement periods for urgent \ndelivery of project activities. These lessons have been carefully built into the design of the \nProject. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n20.  The main objective of the Project is to help the Government rehabilitate and reconstruct \nkey infrastructure in the transport and energy sectors that was damaged during two decades of \nconflict and neglect.  It is anchored in the second pillar of the NDF. The proposed Project is in \nline with ADB\u2019s assistance strategy outlined in the ICSPU, which focuses, among others, on the \nnational road network and international link roads, power, and gas development. While the \nProject involves rehabilitation of key infrastructure, the related policy and institutional reforms in  \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2002.

The  Project  will  rehabilitate  damaged  facilities  through  the  provision  of  civil  works; \nequipment/material; and consulting services for design, supervision of implementation, and \nevaluation. The Project will have three parts as described in the following paragraphs. \n \n22.  Part A: Road Infrastructure. This component will comprise urgently needed repair and \nrehabilitation to the Pule Khumri \u2013 Mazar Sharif \u2013 Sheberghan \u2013 Andkhoy section of the ring \nroad, including the link to Uzbekistan (Naibabad \u2013 Hairatan road).12 The road section generally \nmeets the standards13 established by the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) for core roads in \nAfghanistan.    However,  shoulder  widening  and  geometric  improvements  may  be  needed. \nRehabilitation of bridges and cross\u2013drainage structures will vary from minor repairs to restoring \ndamaged sections.  The roadside drainage needs to be improved. The 164 km road section \nfrom Pule Khumri to Naibabad (junction of road turning to Hairatan, border with Uzbekistan) \nrequires pothole patching, crack sealing, shoulder restoration, and bituminous seal.  The 25 km \nNaibabad \u2013 Mazare Sharif section, the 132 km Mazare Sharif \u2013 Sheberghan road section, and \nthe 48 km section of the Sheberghan \u2013 Andkhoy road (72 km) is largely deteriorated and \nrequires  major  pavement  strengthening.  The  24  km  remaining  section  of  Sheberghan  \u2013 \nAndkhoy road requires embankment rehabilitation and construction of asphalt pavement. The \n55 km Naibabad \u2013 Hairatan road section is continuously blocked due to shifting sand dunes that \nmakes  it  impassable,  requiring  construction  of  barriers  along  the  road  in  affected  areas. \nConsulting services will be provided for design review, supervision of civil works contracts, and \nenhancing MPW O&M capacity. See Appendix 3 for details.  \n \n23.  Part  B:  Power  Infrastructure.  This  component  will  comprise  (i)  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction of damaged transmission lines and substations in the northern provinces to \nenable increased power imports; (ii) urgently needed rehabilitation and reconstruction of the \nKabul distribution system, which was damaged during the conflict period; and (iii) consulting \nservices  for  project  management  and  on-the-job  management  support  training.  The \nrehabilitation and reconstruction of the Kabul distribution system will complement and integrate \nthe efforts provided by the World Bank, KfW, and the European Commission to bring about a \ntotal improvement in electric power supply to Kabul city and surrounding districts, which will \nreduce system losses, improve security, and provide reliability and quality of electricity supply to \nusers. Electrical hazards, specifically those attributed to exposed cable joints, will be minimized. \nThis component will cover (i) rehabilitation of 230 circuit\u2013kilometers (cct\u2013km) of 220 kilovolts \n(kV) and 50 cct\u2013km of 110 kV transmission lines; (ii) reconstruction of Khulum and Pule Khumri \n220/110 kV substations, (iii) rehabilitation of distribution substations, junctions, transformers, \n                                                 \n11  The  policy  objectives  in  the  transport  sector  include  (i)  creating  an  enabling  framework  for  market\u2013based \ncompetition  and  efficiency,  (ii)  establishing  safe  and  reliable  transport  services,  (iii)  improving  institutional \nefficiency, (iv) establishing a regulatory framework, (v) improving transparency and accountability, (vi) instituting \nmechanism for cost recovery, (vii) encouraging private sector participation, and (viii) establishing a system for \nnational road improvement and maintenance. The policy objectives in the energy sector include (i) creating an \nefficient, safe, and reliable energy system; (ii) separating policy\u2013making and regulatory functions from operational \nfunctions; (iii) capacity building of public utilities to improve generation/production, transmission, and distribution; \n(iv) improving cost recovery; (v) encouraging private sector investment; and (vi) improving corporate governance.   \n12  The United States, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, the World Bank, and the European Commission are providing \nassistance for rehabilitation of other sections of the ring road and international links. ADB is providing assistance \nthrough a Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction financed project that includes, among others, rehabilitation of the \nKandahar \u2013 Spin Boldak road in the south.  \n13  These standards are consistent with international standards and are followed by all funding agencies assisting \nAfghanistan in road rehabilitation.  ", "8  \nequipment, cables, and material; (iv) electricity service delivery including installation of 30,000 \nmeters and utilization of low\u2013voltage aerial bundled conductors, which are insulated to deter \nillegal  connections;  (v)  load  dispatch  center  for  Kabul;  (vi)  billing,  revenue  collection,  and \ncomputerization;  and  (vii)  geographic  information,  asset  management,  and  customer \nmanagement systems. See Appendix 4 for details.   \n \n24.  Part C: Gas Infrastructure. This component will comprise (i) provision for two mobile \nrigs to carry out workover activities for 12 gas wells; (ii) provision for two complete well wire line \nunits to carry out down-hole flow tests; (iii) supply and installation of one skid\u2013mounted gas \nsweetening plant; (iv)  two containerized gas production testing laboratories; (v)  repair and \nreconstruction of corroded gas transmission lines including pigging facilities and condensate \ndisposal; (vi) repair and reconstruction of corroded gas distribution lines including installation of \ncity gate station; (vii) cathodic protection system for corrosion mitigation of transmission and \ndistribution pipelines; (viii) chemicals, tools, equipment, spare parts, instrumentation, piping and \nassemblies,  and  vehicles;  (ix)  consulting  services  for  design,  engineering,  contract \nmanagement, and construction supervision; (x) contracting services for gas well rehabilitation, \nrepairs, and reconstruction of gas transmission and distribution facilities; and (xi) institutional \nstrengthening and training of the Ministry of Mines and Industries (MMI) and Afghan Gas. See \nAppendix 5 for details. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates \n \n25.  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $150  million  equivalent,  comprising \napproximately $126.51 million in foreign exchange cost and $23.49 million equivalent in local \ncurrency cost. The cost estimates are given in Table 1. A summarized cost table is included as \nAppendix 6, and detailed breakdowns are available in sector appendixes 3\u20135. \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nPart A: Road Infrastructure  60.64  14.35  74.99 \n \nPart B: Power Infrastructure  26.76  3.24  30.00 \n      \nPart C: Gas Infrastructure  18.12  1.98  20.10 \n \nPhysical and Price Contingencies  10.81  2.00  12.81 \n \nInterest During Grace Period  10.18  1.92  12.10 \n \n             Total  126.51  23.49  150.00 \nPercentage               84      16       100 \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n \n26.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $150 million equivalent from its Special Fund \nresources, representing 100% of the total cost of the Project.  The loan will finance the entire ", "  9\nforeign exchange and local currency costs of civil works, equipment, material, and services. The \nloan proceeds will not be used for costs of land, right-of-way, taxes, or duties.14 \n \n27.  The loan will have a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, an interest \ncharge at the rate of 1% per annum, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. In addition, \nthe total amount of the interest charge during the grace period will be capitalized and charged to \nthe loan account. \n \n28.  The Swedish International Development Agency (Sida) has expressed strong interest in \ncofinancing consulting services for the road infrastructure component. This will be firmed up \nduring implementation.     \n \nE.  Special Loan Terms \n \n29.  In view of the extraordinary postconflict situation in Afghanistan, the prevailing Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF)  lending  terms  approved  by  the  Board  are  not  appropriate  for \nsustainable development in that country. It is therefore proposed that the loan be made on the \nconcessional terms identical to those provided for the PMPL. These are (i) grandfathering pre-\n1999 ADF lending terms so that the loan has 40\u2013year maturity including a 10\u2013year grace \nperiod, with 1% interest charge throughout its term, and (ii) capitalizing interest during the grace \nperiod. The justification for the proposed loan terms is the same as for the PMPL and includes \nthe following: \n \n(i)  Afghanistan is just beginning to emerge from a long period of economic decline \nand stagnation and needs highly concessional resources now to develop its \npromising endowments (such as agriculture, gas, and mineral production) while \nits debt situation is carefully managed. It is therefore important that Afghanistan\u2019s \nincome\u2013generating  capacity  is  developed  without  further  straining  its  debt\u2013\nrepayment situation. \n \n(ii)  Further analysis of debt sustainability by ADB and the International Monetary \nFund  concludes  that  borrowings  of  Afghanistan  should  be  on  a  highly \nconcessional  terms  for  key  projects  and  structural  reforms  for  which  grant \nfinancing cannot be found.  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management and Coordination \n30.  MOF will be the executing agency (EA) for the Project. Implementation of the Project will \nbe managed by the relevant line ministries.  As such, MPW will be the implementing agency (IA) \nfor road infrastructure, MMI for gas infrastructure, and MWP will be the implementing agency for \nthe power infrastructure.   \n \n31.  A project coordination unit (PCU) will be established within MOF to monitor project \nimplementation  and  coordinate  with  the  aforementioned  IAs.    MOF  will  appoint  a  project \ncoordinator and assign appropriate staff to assist in overseeing and monitoring project activities \nand milestones. A project steering committee (PSC), chaired by the deputy minister of finance, \nwill  be  established  to  provide  overall  guidance  and  approvals  required  for  smooth \n                                                 \n14    The Government will allow duty\u2013free import of equipment and material under Project\u2013financed contracts. ", "10  \nimplementation of the Project. The PSC will consist of the ministers of the IAs and will meet at \nleast quarterly to review project implementation and to resolve, among others, interministerial \ncoordination issues. The project coordinator will also serve as the secretary to the PSC. \n \n32.  Each IA will appoint a project director supported by adequate staff, who will liaise with \nthe project coordinator for implementation of the respective components.  See Appendix 7 for \nimplementation arrangements. The consultants engaged under the Project and the TAC for \ncapacity building (footnote 10) will develop capacity and assist IAs in implementation.  \n \n2.  Implementation Schedule \n33.  As the Project is for emergency assistance, it will be implemented over 36 months \nstarting from the date of loan effectiveness. A detailed implementation schedule is attached as \nAppendix 8.  \n \n3.  Consulting Services \n34.  Consulting services will be required to assist the EA and IAs in implementation of the \nProject. The consulting services will involve Project management, detailed design, preparation \nof bid documents, assistance in procurement, supervision of construction and installation of \nequipment, testing and certifying completed works, training in management and O&M, and \nbenefit monitoring and evaluation. The consultants will also assist the IAs in preparing initial \nenvironment examinations (IEEs) and environment management plans including disposal of \nhazardous wastes where applicable. In addition, the consultants will assist in developing social \nscreening and mitigation plans as needed, and in monitoring poverty.  \n \n35.  All consultants financed under the Project will be selected and engaged in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements for recruitment of \ndomestic  consultants  acceptable  to  ADB.  However,  where  required  and  justified,  direct \nselection, negotiation, and hire procedures as allowed under emergency situations will be used. \nThe outline terms of reference for consulting services under each component are provided in \nAppendixes 3\u20135.  \n \n4.  Procurement \n36.  Procurement of goods, services, and civil works to be financed under the Project will be \ncarried out in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, with provision for flexible \napplication of such guidelines for emergency assistance projects.15 This involves, among others, \nshorter bidding period for international procurement if required. All international procurements, \nincluding other major procurements, will be undertaken by the AACA Procurement Unit with \nassistance from the international procurement advisor. The IAs will execute and administer the \ncontracts as employer.  \n \n37.  All contracts for civil works and supply of equipment and materials will be divided into \nsuitable contract packages. The contracts have been mostly packaged as turnkey and design-\nbuild to ensure delivery within the project implementation period. The civil works contracts \nexceeding $1 million will be awarded following international competitive bidding procedures.  \nThe contracts for equipment and materials valued at $500,000 and below should be procured \nusing  international  shopping  procedures.  For  equipment  and  material  contracts  exceeding \n                                                 \n15  As provided under Operations Manual Section 25: Rehabilitation Assistance After Disasters. ", "  11\n$500,000,  international  competitive  bidding  procedures  will  be  followed.  Appendix  9  gives \nindicative contract packages.   \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n38.  Loan funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nImprest accounts, primarily for incremental expenditures relating to administrative support for \nthe IAs and the PCU, will be established with the PCU in the Ministry of Finance, in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The initial amount to be deposited into the imprest \naccount will be a 6-month estimated expenditure that will be replenished on submission of \nstatements of expenditures. \n \n6.  Advance Action  \n39.  In view of the short implementation time frame, there is an urgency to commence \nprocurement. Accordingly, ADB Management has approved advance actions for procurement of \nconsulting services, civil works, equipment, and material. Such advance action incorporates \ngeneral  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement  requirements  and  procedures.  Approval  of \nadvance action will not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n40.  Overall project monitoring will be conducted by the PCU.  In consultation with the IAs, \nthe PCU will establish a system for preparing quarterly reports for performance monitoring, \nissues resolution, and periodic actions plans. These action plans, developed by the IAs, will \nincorporate  quantitative  and  time-bound  implementation  targets  and  will  be  reviewed  and \napproved by the PSC. The quarterly reports will serve as management feedback to update and \nimprove  procedures  and  project  implementation.  The  PCU  will  ensure  submission  of  the \nquarterly reports to ADB. Within 3 months of project completion, the PCU will prepare, with the \nassistance of the IAs, a comprehensive project completion report on the overall impact of the \nProject.     \n \n41.  The Government will maintain separate accounts and records for the Project, including \nall components, in accordance with sound accounting principles. MOF will ensure that proper \naudit and accounting procedures are in place by the IAs to ensure efficient and economical use \nof  the  loan  proceeds  for  the  beneficiaries.  Separate  accounts  and  financial  statements  in \nrelation to the Project adequate to identify the goods and services financed from the loan \nproceeds,  financing  resources,  expenditures  incurred,  and  the  use  of  local  funds  will  be \nmaintained. Such accounts and financial statements will be maintained in accordance with \nsound accounting principles and certified by independent private auditors acceptable to ADB. \nThe audited reports and related financial statements will be submitted to ADB no later than 9 \nmonths after the end of the fiscal year. The annual audits will also include audit of the imprest \naccount and statement of expenditure records, and a separate opinion on such audit will be \nincluded in the audit report. The Government will facilitate ADB representatives to carry out spot \nand random checks on flow of funds and their use for the Project, work in progress and \nimplementation. \n \n8.  Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening \n42.  Capacity  building  of  the  government  agencies/ministries  and  utility  companies  is \nessential for O&M of the rehabilitated infrastructure and facilities and to achieve the economic ", "12  \nand financial benefits. To this end, in the road sector, consultants engaged under the TAC16 \n(see footnote 10) are providing training to MPW and Ministry of Transport staff in project \nplanning, design, procurement, financial management, and maintenance. In the power sector, \nconsultants17 have been working closely with MWP and DABM counterparts to strengthen their \ncapacity in project planning, design, asset management, load dispatching, accounting, billing, \nrevenue collection, and O&M. In addition, under the Project, DABM will receive suitable training \nas well as tools, equipment, and spare parts to effectively operate and maintain the integrated \nnorthern power system and the Kabul distribution power system. Further capacity building of \nMWP is also planned in 2004.18 For the gas sector, the Project will provide operational training \nto MMI and Afghan Gas staff. Moreover, a separate TA in 200319 will provide institutional \nstrengthening in the sector. \n \n9.  Operation and Maintenance \n43.  All infrastructure rehabilitated and reconstructed under the Project will be operated and \nmaintained by the relevant ministry/IA during and after completion of the works. Related O&M \ntraining of the IA staff will be part of the contracts for supervisory consultants and contractors for \ncivil works, and supply and installation of equipment. \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n44.  The PCU will undertake quantitative and qualitative performance monitoring for each \nproject component to evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the project benefits \naccrued. Within 6 months after the effective date of the Loan Agreement, the PCU, with the \nassistance of the Project Implementation Unit (PIUs) and Project\u2013financed consultants, will \ndevelop a comprehensive project performance monitoring system (PPMS) in accordance with \nthe ADB\u2019s standards. ADB will review and approve the PPMS. The PIUs will assist in carrying \nout the PPMS activities. ADB and the Government will agree on the performance parameters to \nbe monitored during the implementation of the Project.       \n \nG.  Environmental and Social Measures \n45.  The Project will have significant positive impact on, and will result in improvement of, the \nenvironment. All project components will be designed to follow environmental safeguards and \ntechnical specifications established for ongoing ADB-financed projects, which have already \nbeen subjected to ADB\u2019s initial environmental examination procedures.  The Project will be \nprepared  to  follow  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected \nInfrastructure,  Industrial,  and  Power  Development  Projects  and  to  comply  with  the  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy. The responsible IAs will submit a waste management plan for the gas \ninfrastructure component. An environmental monitoring system will be built into each project \ncomponent including training for IAs to strengthen their capacity to deal with environmental \nproblems, particularly hazardous wastes.   \n \n46.  Community  consultations  were  undertaken  as  part  of  the  design  of  the  Project. \nMechanisms for maximizing local employment benefits, particularly for the destitute, landless \n                                                 \n16  Component 3a: Capacity Building for Key Infrastructure Agencies Including Support for Feasibility Studies for Road \nReconstruction Projects; and Component 3b: Capacity Building for Project Planning in the Transport Sector, for \n$2.46 million and $0.84 million, respectively, approved on 30 July 2002.  \n17  Component 3c: Capacity Building and Training of Ministry of Water and Power; for $0.7 million, approved on 18 \nJune 2002. \n18  Proposed TA for Institutional Strengthening of MWP, for $0.75 million in 2004.   \n19  Proposed TA for institutional Strengthening of Gas sector, for $0.75 million in 2003. ", "  13\nlaborers,  internal  displaced  people,  and  ex-combatants  will  be  included  in  the  bidding \ndocuments.  This will include road embankment rehabilitation under the road infrastructure \ncomponent, which will maximize the use of local labor. ADB and the Government will ensure \nthat a specific plan for local consultation to address safety, social, and cultural matters during \nproject construction will be included in the bidding document. The Government will work closely \nwith the local community leaders in the Project area to ensure that both men and women are \ngiven equal employment opportunities to benefit from the Project. Contractors will be required to \nensure equal payment for equal work.  \n \n47.  Rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  road,  gas  and  electricity  transmission  and \ndistribution facilities will occur on existing rights-of-way. Therefore, the Project will not entail land \nacquisition  and  resettlement.    The  rehabilitation  works  are  designed,  using  engineering \nsolutions, to ensure that reconstruction and rehabilitation will be within existing rights-of-way. No \nnew roads, gas pipelines, or electricity transmission and distribution lines will be constructed. \n \n48.  However, several possible minor shoulder adjustments and movement of movable stalls \nand sheds may be necessary at certain locations. Urgency and the uncertain security situation \nrequire flexibility in applying social and related safeguard policies. At the same time, in order to \nundertake due diligence, avoid negative impacts, and ensure consistent treatment of social \nissues,  a  social  assessment  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  social  screening \nframework (Appendix 10). Its purpose will be to assist IAs in screening project components for \nlikely  social  impacts,  identifying  documentation,  ascertaining  requirements,  and  preparing \nnecessary  mitigation  plans  for  project  components  triggering  safeguard  policies.  Social \nassessment will include a focus on gender impacts. Consultation and disclosure requirements \nwill be simplified in consideration of the uncertain security situation in the country. The EA will \nsubmit a social assessment report to ADB for review and approval.20 Based on field visits and \npublic consultations in the project area for each component, the Project will have no negative \nimpact on indigenous people or ethnic minorities.   \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Impact on Poverty and Other Benefits \n49.  The Project will contribute to economic recovery, diversification of activities, employment \ngeneration, higher productivity, improved per capita income, increased revenue generation, \nimproved  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  public  sector,  private  sector  development, \nenvironmental  preservation,  and  social  stability.  Specific  beneficiaries  will  include,  among \nothers, the rural and urban poor, displaced populations, demobilized combatants, and women. \nSpecifically, the benefits will be directly or indirectly attributable to different project components. \n \n50.  Road transport development will (i) improve the national road network; (ii) facilitate the \nmovement  of  humanitarian  aid  through  the  northern  corridor;  (iii)  reduce  the  cost  of \ntransportation; (iv) promote international and regional trade; (v) increase the income of the \nvulnerable groups in rural and urban areas; (vi) build up the capacity of local contractors for \nconstruction, rehabilitation, and maintenance of major roads and bridges; and (vii) promote \nenvironmental preservation. Road rehabilitation and reconstruction will open up a wide range of \nopportunities for the private sector involved in road construction, production, trade, transport, \nand services. Rehabilitated roads will improve the supply of and access to health, education, \nand other social services. The road component will assist some of the most vulnerable groups in \nthe country in their repatriation, resettlement, and reintegration within their communities; provide \n                                                 \n20  The consultants under the TAC (footnote 10) will assist the EA/IAs in preparing the social assessment report. ", "14  \nlivelihood; and develop capacity and skills that provide sustainability. Women's welfare will be \npromoted through improved availability and access to social services including education and \nhealth. Private sector development will open up opportunities for women entrepreneurs. \n \n51.  Energy development will (i) improve gas and electricity supply in terms of quantity, \nquality, reliability, safety and environmental impact; (ii) improve household quality of life; (iii) \nrevive industries and establish new ones; (iv) contribute to energy security and self-reliance; (v) \npromote private sector activities including those owned and operated by women; (vi) make \nnatural gas available where demand exists, and also stimulate demand for gas instead of fuel \nwood or imported oil; and (vii) make gas supply safe by avoiding the present  problem of \nleakages. Tariff collection will improve the financial viability and reduce Government subsidy. \nUse of indigenous gas will save foreign exchange used to import energy. The increased and \nmore reliable power supply will encourage private sector investment in all sectors, particularly \nmanufacturing,  commerce,  and  services.  The  improved  power  supply  will  improve  the \navailability of safe water, and the quality of health services. Improvement in health care delivery \nwill bring down maternal mortality. A summary of the poverty and social development strategy is \npresented in Appendix 11.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Assessment \n1.  Economic Analysis \n52.  An economic analysis of the three components of the Project has been undertaken, and \nthe findings and assumptions are summarized in the following paragraphs. Results of the base \ncases and sensitivity analysis for each component are given in Appendix 12. As the numbers \nsuggest, investments in road and energy infrastructure are economically justified. However, the \nencouraging  results  for  the  energy  components  are  dependent  upon  certain  assumptions \nregarding  achievement  of  sector  restructuring  and  policy  reforms  as  anticipated  under  the \nPMPL, leading to improvement of operational and administrative efficiency that will, among \nothers, call for streamlining of tariff structure, accounting, billing, and collection, and reduction of \ntransmission and distribution losses, as appropriate.   \n \na.  Road Infrastructure \n53.  The economic evaluation of the road rehabilitation component weighs the savings in \nvehicle  operating  costs  and  travel  time  costs21  gained  by  the  Project  against  the  initial \ninvestment costs and the savings in future periodic and routine maintenance costs over a 20\u2013\nyear period. The level of current average daily traffic on various road sections varies from a low \nof 1,505 to a high of 2,819. The economic evaluation indicates that the overall project is \neconomically viable, with an Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) of 31.5% and a net \npresent value of $167.5 million. The economic returns are quite robust, as indicated in the \nsensitivity tests by decreasing benefits by 20% and increasing costs by 20% and both: The \nEIRR varied from 23% to 27%. Similarly reduction of traffic growth rates by 25% and 50 % \nreduces EIRR to 29% and 26.5%, respectively. These sensitivity tests demonstrate that the \noverall  project  component  is  very  robust  considering  increases  in  construction  cost, \nimplementation delays, and reduction in traffic growth. \n \n                                                 \n21 Travel-time savings contribute less than 10% to the benefit stream.  ", "  15\nb.  Power Infrastructure \n54.  For  the  power  component,  the  benefit  streams  identified  over  a  20\u2013year  operating \nperiod, 2007-2026 reflects the importance of electric power and its distribution to the economic \nrecovery of the country. It has been assumed that failure to provide the minimum amount of \nelectricity to Kabul envisaged by this Project would have significant repercussions on ADB\u2019s \nsector-specific  economic  growth  projections  (low  case)  for  Afghanistan.  Restricted  to  the \nmanufacturing and the trade sectors, it has been estimated that 25% of the projected growth to \n2015 and 10% of anticipated growth thereafter would fail to be achieved. These potential losses, \nto be avoided as a result of the Project, represent the principal benefits of the Project and are \ndeemed  conservative  in  light  of  the  current  situation  and  Kabul\u2019s  present  and  projected \npredominance in the economy of the country. The project exhibits a robust EIRR of 32% and a \nNPV of $414 million. Sensitivity analyses revealed that a 20% cost increase combined with a \n20% decrease in benefits would still result in an EIRR of 23%. \n \nc.  Gas Infrastructure \n55.  Rehabilitation of existing pipeline and production wells appears to be the least\u2013cost \noption compared with the drilling of new wells and/or building a new pipeline. The economic \nbenefits of rehabilitating transmission and distribution facilities consist of revenues from the sale \nof an additional 320,000 cubic meters per day. The additional supply is attributed to 250,000 \ncubic meters savings from losses and 70,000 cubic meters from new production. Revenue has \nbeen calculated at current average tariff of about $12.13 per 1000 cubic meters. The economic \nevaluation indicates that the overall Project is economically viable, with an economic internal \nrate of return of 35%. Sensitivity tests indicate that the overall project component is robust to \nvariations in construction cost and benefits. A combined cost escalation of 20% and benefit \nreduction of 20% results in a decline of EIRR to 23%. \n \n2.  Financial Analysis \n56.  Financial  analysis  of  the  energy  components  (power  and  gas  infrastructure \nrehabilitation) was undertaken. The financial rate of return for the Project is based on estimated \nincremental  revenues  and  costs  resulting  from  the  operations  of  the  power  and  gas \ninfrastructure rehabilitated under the Project. Many assumptions underlying financial analysis \nare the same as those discussed earlier for economic analysis. Additional assumptions used \nhere and findings are described in paras. 57 \u2013 59. Details are provided in Appendix 13. \n \na.  Power Infrastructure \n57.  The power sector is weak, as the power supply suffers from heavy losses, unreliable \npower  generation,  and  damaged  transmission  and  distribution  systems.  The  technical  and \nnontechnical losses are currently estimated at 45%. As an outcome of the Project, 200 MW at a \nload  factor  of  65%  is  expected  to  be  generated  in  rehabilitated  hydropower  plants  during \nsummer, and 80 MW at a load factor of 90% during winter plus 45 MW from gas turbines as \npeak load during 6 hours per day. In addition, 200 MW will be imported from the neighboring \nCentral Asian Republics (Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) at a load factor of 65%, less 5% \ntransmission losses. In calculating the FIRR for the base case, the current average tariff of 2.4 \ncents/kWh and the current total system losses have been used. The average cost of generation \nis estimated at 0.9 US cents per kWh, and 2.0 US cents per kWh is projected for the imported \npower.  The  technical  losses  are  assumed  to  be  25%,  and  nontechnical  losses  20%.  The \ncollection  efficiency  is  extremely  poor  as  well  at  54%.  Considering  all  these  losses,  the ", "16  \ncollection/generation  ratio  totals  only  around  30%.  Costs  for  O&M  and  administration  are \nestimated at 5% of the invested capital.  \n \n58.  Due  to  existing  tariffs,  limited  technical  resources,  as  well  as  lack  of  accurate \nadministration, DABM is not financially viable at present. To make this Project component viable \nand at the same time bring DABM back to financial sustainability without heavy subsidies from \nthe government budget, major restructuring efforts are needed. These efforts have to be carried \nout simultaneously with a review of the current tariff structure to achieve financial sustainability. \nTo reflect possible opportunities, two scenarios have been analyzed aside from the above \npresented base case: \n \n(i)  The first scenario assumes that the financial recovery is achieved solely through \ndecreased technical and nontechnical losses directly derived from the project \ninvestments  (from  45%  to  30%)  as  well  as  increased  average  tariffs  from \ncurrently 2.4 US cents per KWh to 7.3 US cents per kWh to attain a 15% FIRR \non investment for this component. \n \n(ii)  In attaining the same FIRR of 15%, the second scenario assumes major efforts in \nimproving the administration of meter reading, billing, and revenue collection in \navoiding too steep tariff increases. If the commercial losses, aside from the \ntechnical and nontechnical, can be brought down to 30% from the currently \nestimated 46%, after the implementation of this Project, the average tariff will be \nlimited to 6.5 US cents per KWh. \n \nb.  Gas Infrastructure \n59.  Afghan Gas under MMI is responsible for production, transmission, and distribution of \nnatural gas. Given its very low level of tariff collection, Afghan Gas is currently not a financially \nviable  entity.  Major  restructuring  efforts  are  needed  with  regard  to  administration,  finance, \naccounting, billing, and revenue collection together with a review of the current tariff structure to \nrestore profitability. The current supply of 580,000 cubic meters a day, after accounting for high \nlosses  (250,000  cubic  meters  a  day)  in  transmission  and  distribution,  cannot  satisfy  the \nestimated demand of 900,000 cubic meters a day. The average tariff of $12.13 per 1000 cubic \nmeters is well below the comparable tariff in neighboring countries. Using the current rates and \nvolumes as presented by Afghan Gas, assuming a restructured Afghan Gas with (O&M) cost of \n5%  and  even  with  minimal  losses  in  transmission  and  distribution,  the  component  is  not \nfinancially viable. Major tariff rationalization is needed, as the current tariffs are significantly \nbelow current prices in neighboring countries. About 3.65 times increase in tariff will result in a \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 15%. In addition, the existing collection rate also needs \nmajor improvements. A collection rate of 75% for industrial/commercial consumers and 50% for \ndomestic consumers is assumed for achieving the 15% FIRR. Sensitivity analysis shows that a \nreduction in the proposed level of tariff and collection rate will reduce the FIRR, however \nfinancial viability could still be achieved with a different combination of tariff increase and \nreduction in collection rate. \n \nC.  Project Sustainability \n60.  Though not a primary concern for emergency assistance projects where restoration of \ninfrastructure and facilities is critical, sustainability considerations are important for long-term \nviability. The road component of the Project relies on toll collection on the improved roads for \nfunding of maintenance. Generating road maintenance revenues through toll collection has ", "  17\nbeen in practice since 1974 in Afghanistan. Though the system has been modified over the \nyears and may not be fully in practice at present, tolls offer a viable short-term means to finance \nroad maintenance. MPW is in the process of reviving tolls on the improved road sections. For \nsustainable funding of maintenance in the long term, the ongoing review of the transport sector, \nsponsored by Sida and supported by ADB and the World Bank, is preparing recommendations \nfor establishing a road fund with revenues generated through fuel levies, vehicle licensing, and \nroad user charges. \n \n61.  For the gas and power components, the Project includes capacity building efforts at the \noperational level that will improve the O&M capacity of DABM and Afghan Gas. The Project\u2013 \nproposed enhancement in tariff, reduction of technical and nontechnical losses, and increase in \ncollection rates are critical for the financial sustainability of these institutions. Major institutional \nimprovements have a key role in achieving these objectives. It is recognized that full cost \nrecovery will take time. Since the energy components are networked systems, it is difficult to \nachieve  cost  efficiencies  at  this  stage.  Cost  recovery  is  actually  the  next  step  after  the \ntransmission  and  distribution  systems  have  been  rehabilitated  and  improved  through  the \nProject. However, the Government has shown deep commitment to pursue the reforms and set \nspecific targets for achieving institutional improvements and enhancing cost recovery during the \nrecently concluded Afghanistan Development Forum.  \n \nD.  Environmental Impact  \n62.  The Project is classified as a Category B environmental Project, as it is unlikely to have \nany  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.  For  the  road  and  power  distribution  and \ntransmission lines, the rehabilitation will follow existing alignments. Hence, these components \nare  deemed  to  have  minor  environmental  impacts.  In  addition,  the  power  distribution  and \ntransmission  component  will  not  involve  replacement  of  transformers  and  conductors,  and \ntherefore there will be no scrap equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyl. Environmental \nimpacts related to the construction activities will be mitigated and will be incorporated into the \ncontractor\u2019s  responsibilities.  While  the  gas  infrastructure  component  will  improve  the \nenvironmental  conditions  of  the  project  area,  these  components  will  involve  activities  that \ngenerate  environmental  problems  related  with  hazardous  wastes.  Therefore,  a  waste \nmanagement plan will be prepared and submitted to ADB prior to executing any construction \nwork. Environmental monitoring, particularly for pollution into the water, will be developed as a \npart of project implementation. The summary initial environmental examination is attached as \nAppendix 14. \n \n63.  The road component will improve the environment in a number of ways: (i) improving the \nsupply of fuel, thereby reducing pressure on forests for fuel wood; (ii) improving fuel efficiency, \nthereby saving fuel and reducing pollution; (iii) stabilizing embankments; (iv) preventing erosion; \n(v) channelizing water; and (vi) reducing permanent loss of agricultural land from encroachment \nby vehicles along roads. The Project will optimize the use of natural gas, reduce dependence on \npetroleum, and curtail the demand for fuel wood, thereby saving forests. Safety will be improved \nas pipeline leakages are eliminated. A cathodic protection system for the buried gas pipelines \nwill safeguard against corrosion. \n \nE.  Risks \n64.  Implementation of the Project entails a number of risks: \n ", "18  \n(i)  The overall political and security situation remains volatile. ADB will need \nto  closely  monitor  the  situation  and  coordinate  with  local  and  central \nauthorities and the United Nation to ensure adequate protection.22 \n \n(ii)  Government  implementation  capacity  being  very  weak,  there  may  be \nundue  delays  in  implementation  of  key  activities.  Also  the  lack  of \naccounting and auditing capacity implies a risk of corruption. Resources \nhave  been  allocated  for  consultancy  services  to  assist  in  project \nmanagement and implementation. Additional capacity\u2013building initiatives \nfocused on financial management have been provided under the TAC. \nBesides,  MOF  will  establish  a  strong  coordination  and  monitoring \nmechanism. ADB will also field review missions as frequently necessary. \n \n(iii)  The  Government  may  not  provide  counterpart  resources,  in  a  timely \nmanner, of the type required. ADB will work closely with AACA, MOF, and \nthe IAs to address this issue. \n \n(iv)  Rehabilitated roads may not be maintained properly, leading to rapid \ndeterioration. The deterioration process will be further accelerated by lack \nof axle load controls. The adjustment cost for policy reforms under the \nPMPL includes resources for road maintenance and establishment of \nweighing  stations.  The  Government  will  be  encouraged  to  make \nappropriate allocation of budgetary resources for this purpose. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n65.  The Government has given the following specific assurances, in addition to the standard \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will provide adequate security for the smooth and uninterrupted \nimplementation of the Project. \n \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that the objectives, policies, and actions set forth in \nthe development policy letter dated 4 November 2002 and the policy matrix \nattached to the development policy letter (together, the Policy Letter) relating to \nADB\u2019s  Postconflict  Multisector  Program  Loan  to  the  Government  will  (a)  be \nachieved, adopted, undertaken, and implemented in the manner stipulated in the \nPolicy  Letter;  and  (b)  continue  to  be  in  full  force  and  effect  during  the \nimplementation and O&M stages of the Project. \n \n(iii)  The Government will allocate and make available, in a timely manner, sufficient \nfunds from its budget for each fiscal year for the O&M of the project facilities and \nwill ensure that such facilities are operated and maintained in accordance with \nsound practices in the transport and energy sectors. For the maintenance of the \nroad component of the Project, the Government will, as a short\u2013term measure, \nensure implementation of a toll collection system on improved roads. Based on \nthe recommendations of the ongoing Transport Sector Review, the Government \n                                                 \n22 Coordination with the United States\u2013sponsored provincial reconstruction teams providing security for development \nactivities in Kabul and other provinces may also be explored.  ", "  19\nwill, in a timely manner, establish sustainable means for revenue generation such \nas setting up a dedicated road maintenance fund based on fuel levies, vehicle \nlicensing, and other road user\u2013related taxes.      \n \n(iv)  To  ensure  long-term  viability  of  the  power  component  of  the  Project,  the \nGovernment will, before the completion of the power component, finalize and \nenter into long\u2013term power purchase/supply agreements with its neighboring \ncountries for sufficient and uninterrupted supply of electricity to the country. \n \n(v)  To secure an adequate and continuous supply of electricity to the country, the \nGovernment will comply with its payment obligations under the aforesaid power \npurchase/supply  agreements.

Rationale \n \n1.  Afghanistan is a landlocked country. With a large area (of about 652,000 square \nkilometers)  and  population of  24  million  widely  spread  across  the  largely  mountainous \nterrain, roads are the only means of transport not only for facilitating urgent humanitarian aid \nand returning refugees, but more importantly for economic revival and development. Key \ncomponents  of  the  primary  road  network  are  the  2,200  kilometer  (km)  ring  road  that \nconnects Afghanistan\u2019s major regional centers (Herat, Kandahar, Mazar Sharif, Meymaneh \nand Sheberghan) with Kabul and the six international links to neighboring countries (Iran, \nPakistan,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan).  These  roads  are  essential  to \nAfghanistan\u2019s economy, but they have suffered widespread damage due to the last 20 years \nof hostilities, allied with the lack of any effective maintenance. The general condition of these \nroads is poor to very poor, which results in long journey times and high transport costs.  \nInternational  trade  is  stifled  by  these  poor  road  links,  and  agricultural  development  is \nsuppressed by the difficulties growers have in transporting perishable goods to the main \npopulation centers.   \n \n2.  To keep up with increasing traffic volume, to promote trade links with neighbouring \ncountries, and to improve movement of goods and services, thereby fostering trade and \ncommerce, it is essential that the entire primary road network be rehabilitated on a priority \nbasis. This is also supported by the findings of the comprehensive needs assessment \n(CNA)1 for the transport sector.  The road rehabilitation efforts should not only respond to the \ncurrent requirements of domestic trade but also start taking advantage of the possibilities of \nexpansion  of  regional  trade.  The  Government  has  declared  that  reconstruction  and \nrehabilitation of the road system, especially of national roads, is the country\u2019s top priority in \nreconstruction. Improved roads will not only facilitate the physical and political integration of \nAfghanistan  but  also  help  unify  the  international  and  domestic  trade  of  Afghanistan.  \nRebuilding the road network is also critical in facilitating humanitarian and development \nassistance.  The  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  work  will  maximize  labor-intensive \nconstruction methods, providing much-needed employment and income generation. It will \ncontribute  to  social  stability,  by  engaging, among  others,  refugees  and  ex-combatants. \nProduction, trade, and commerce will be promoted, thereby expediting economic recovery \nand growth. A strengthened transport system will serve regional interests, with the possibility \nof reestablishing Afghanistan as a trade hub. The benefits for Afghanistan will be enormous. \n \nB.   Objectives and Scope \n \n3.  The main objective of this project component is to promote economic development \nby carrying out rehabilitation of the primary road network in northern Afghanistan. This will \nimprove local, regional, and international access and will reduce transport costs and journey \ntimes. The road will be restored to a good maintainable condition, and road maintenance \ncosts will be reduced.   \n \n4.  The scope of work covers rehabilitation and reconstruction2 of (i) 392 km of the \nprimary ring road running between Pule Khumri, Mazar Sharif, Sheberghan, and Andkhoy; \n                                                 \n1  The transport sector CNA was based on findings of a joint aid mission in March 2002.  The report was finalized \nin May 2002.   \n2  The Ministry of Public Works standards for national roads, which are consistent with international standards, \ninclude 7 meters (m) pavement with 2 m shoulders (partly paved or improved) on either side. These standards \nhave been agreed among the aid agencies providing assistance for rehabilitation of national roads in \nAfghanistan. \n ", "26 Appendix 3 \nand (ii) 55 km of the primary international link that runs from the Naibabad junction (some 25 \nkm east of Mazar Sharif) to the border crossing with Uzbekistan at Hairatan.   \n \nC.   Components and Output \n \n5.  The  project  component  comprises  (i)  rehabilitation  of  157  km  of  existing  road \npavement (Naibabad Junction to a point 22 km east of Andkhoy); (ii) crack sealing, patching, \nand a surface seal of 219 km of existing road pavement (Pule Khumri to Naibabad Junction \nand Naibabad Junction to Hairatan); (iii) construction of 22 km of road pavement on an \nexisting embankment (east side of Andkhoy); (iv) reconstruction of 1 bridge that has been \nwashed out; (v) rehabilitation and repair of 66 existing bridges and 388 existing drainage \nstructures and culverts; (vi) stabilization of embankment slips; (vii) construction of busbays \nand turnouts; (viii) provision of other safety features such as guard railings, road markings \nand road signs; and (ix) consulting services for design review, project management, and \nconstruction supervision. \n \nD.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n7.  MPW will be the implementing agency (IA) for the road component of the Project. A \nproject implementation unit (PIU) under a project director will be established by MPW to \noversee implementation. The project director will be responsible, inter alia, for the overall \nmanagement,  coordination,  and  monitoring;  audit  of  Project  accounts  and  financial \nstatements; and preparation of progress reports. The PIU will function under the overall \nsupervision and guidance of the project steering committee under the Ministry of Finance. \nThe Procurement Unit of the Afghan Assistance Coordination Authority will undertake all \nprocurement  of  civil  works,  goods,  and  services  through  the  international  procurement \nadvisor.

Operation and Maintenance \n \n11.  MPW is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the primary road network.  \nIn the past, road maintenance was carried out under force account or through its parastatal \nconstruction department. Due to lack of funds, at present MPW is able to carry out only the \nemergency maintenance, particularly in the northern region. Lack of skilled manpower for \nplanning and management, and lack of operational plant and equipment are generic causes \nfor low maintenance capability. This situation is not likely to improve unless the whole \nspectrum of maintenance funding issues, management, and implementation activities at the \nnational, regional, and local levels are addressed. Under the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)-financed technical assistance cluster (TAC), maintenance management expertise is \n                                                 \n3   See detailed cost breakdown in Table A3.3. \n ", "28 Appendix 3 \nimparted to MPW staff in terms of carrying out inventory and road condition surveys. Under \nthe  same  TAC,  ADB  is  assisting  the  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation \nAgency\u2013sponsored  Transport  Sector  Review,  which  involves  review  of  the  policy, \ninstitutional, and sector needs. The Transport Sector includes, among others, preparation of \nrecommendations for road maintenance funding, planning and implementation with a move \ntowards funding through cost recovery from road users, and the use of private sector \ncontractors to perform periodic and routine maintenance. MPW is reviewing an old system of \ntoll collection on both sides of the Salang tunnel and in the Kabul area. If successful, this \nseems to be an appropriate short-term solution for generating revenues for maintenance of \nimproved roads. \n \n12.  At the present time, there appears to be no effective control of axle loads on vehicles \ncarrying goods. Vehicles are overloaded in terms of weight and height of the load.  Not only \ndoes  this  impact  on  safety,  but  overloaded  vehicles  reduce  the  effective  life  of  the \nrehabilitated pavement.

The entire \nelectric power infrastructure (covering generation, transmission, and distribution equipment, and \nconsumer  service  connections)  is  in  a  very  poor  condition,  caused  by  almost  continuous \nconflicts over the last two decades. The overall power system is characterized by daily rationing \nof  electricity,  frequent  brownouts  caused  by  system  faults  and  a  dysfunctional  protection \nsystem, aging power generation plants, missing overhead transmission and distribution lines, \nhazardous exposed cable joints, and high system losses. The electrification ratio is estimated to \nbe only about 6% and the annual per capita consumption of electricity is estimated to be about \n16 Kilowatt-hour (kWh), which ranks among the lowest in the world. Of an estimated total of \nabout 230,000 electricity consumers in the country, about 76,000 are located in Kabul and its \nsurrounding districts. \n \n2.  The Kabul power system is supplied mainly by four snow-fed hydroelectric plants with an \ninstalled capacity of nearly 200 megawatts (MW)1 but with a firm output of only about 65 MW in \nthe 2003 winter season due to the low availability of water compounded by the aging generating \nplants.  A  diesel-fired  gas  turbine  plant,  recently  rehabilitated  with  World  Bank  assistance, \nproduces a peaking output of 45 MW. The peak load demand of Kabul city and its surrounding \ndistricts decreased from about 250 MW in 1996 to an estimated 160 MW in January 2003, as \nonly about 40% of the distribution networks are operational, and the rest of the networks have \nonly  poles  standing,  with  line  conductors  missing.  The  proposed  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction of the Kabul distribution network together with the ongoing interventions by the \nWorld Bank and Kreditanstalt f\u1ee7r Wiederaufbau (KfW) will contribute an additional 100 MW of \npeak load demand by end 2005. Hence, there is a need in the short term to increase the power \nsupply to Kabul by about 150 MW to meet its expected peak load demand of 260 MW.2 The \nleast-cost option is through power imports from neighboring Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan (see \npara. 4).  \n \n3.  Technical losses are estimated to be about 25% (due to overloading of transmission and \ndistribution equipment and makeshift substandard overhead conductor and underground cable \njoints), while nontechnical losses (due mainly to pilferage and partly to lack of reliable metering) \nare estimated to be as high as 20%. Besides contributing to the very high technical losses, \nexposed cable joints pose considerable safety risks to the public, especially during winter and \nrainy periods when the danger of electrocution for those walking in the vicinity of such joints is \ngreatly increased. \n \n4.  Afghanistan currently imports, based on yearly annual power purchase agreements, up \nto  25  MW  each  from  Turkmenistan  (via  existing  110  kilovolt  [kV]  transmission  link)  and \nUzbekistan (via damaged 220 kV link but operated at 110 kV) to supplement the load demands \ncentered around Andhkoy, Sheberghan, and Mazar Sharif in the northern provinces. According \n                                                           \n1  Naghlu (4x25 MW), Mahipar (3x22 MW), Sarobi (2x11 MW), and Darunta (3x4 MW). However, the current \ncombined working capacity is only about 160 MW. After rehabilitation of these four plants, provided by ongoing \nWorld Bank and European Commission assistance, the combined generating output is expected to be restored up \nto about 200 MW, subject to availability of water.  During winter, the low availability of water limits the combined \nfirm output to about 80 MW. \n2  The expected peak load demand of 260 MW, only 4% higher than the 1996 actual figure of 250 MW, is constrained \nby the limited extent of damaged distribution networks being rehabilitated and reconstructed with funding from the \nWorld Bank and KfW, and to be rehabilitated and reconstructed under the proposed Project.  ", " 30 Appendix 4 \nto the Ministry of Water and Power (MWP), Afghanistan and Uzbekistan have recently signed a \n10\u2013year power purchase agreement for the import of 150 MW from Uzbekistan at an initial price \nof $0.02 per kWh for the first year3 to meet the acute power supply shortfall in Kabul. \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n \n5.  The power component of the Project will focus on (i) rehabilitation and reconstruction of \ndamaged transmission lines and substations in the northern power system to enable increased \npower imports; (ii) rehabilitation and reconstruction of damaged Kabul distribution network to \nrestore electricity supply to consumers and reduce system losses; and (iii) consulting services \nfor detailed design, engineering, and project implementation supervision. This component has \nbeen formulated in close consultation with MWP, taking into account the assistance committed \nby other development partners in the subsector. The rehabilitation and reconstruction of the \nKabul distribution system will complement and integrate the efforts provided by the World Bank, \nKfW, and the European Commission to bring about a total improvement in electric power supply \nto Kabul city and surrounding districts that will reduce system losses, improve security, provide \nreliability and quality of electricity supply to residential and commercial users, and also support \nlight industries to promote economic growth. Damaged equipment will be replaced to ensure \nthat electrical hazards, specifically those attributed to exposed cable joints, will be minimized. \nThe related policy and institutional reforms in the power subsector are reflected in the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)\u2013financed Postconflict Multisector Program Loan.4   \n \nC.  Components and Outputs \n \n6.  The power component will cover (i) rehabilitation and reconstruction of about 230 circuit-\nkilometers (cct-km) of 220 kV transmission lines and about 50 cct-km of 110 kV transmission \nlines; (ii) reconstruction of Khulum and Pule Khumri 220/110 kV substations, (iii) reconstruction \nof distribution substations; (iv) reconstruction of junctions; (v) supply and installation of 75 \ndistribution  transformers  and  30,000  single-phase  energy  meters;  (vi)  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction of about 230 cct-km of medium voltage  overhead conductors and poles, about \n30  cct-km  of  medium  voltage  cables,  about  210  cct-km  of  low  voltage    aerial  bundled \nconductors, and about 35 cct-km of low voltage cables; (vii) supply of testing equipment and \ntools; (viii) computerized billing and revenue collection, including 50 data loggers; (ix) setting up \nan  interim  load  dispatch  center  for  monitoring  the  Kabul  power  system  based on  satellite \ncommunication  to  facilitate  demand  and  supply  management;  and  (x)  development  of  a \ngeographic information system to improve asset and customer management. \n \n \nD.

DABM has about 5,200 staff, but they lack computers, modern \ncommunication equipment, and training in best practices. During the conflict period, proper \nmaintenance and repairs could not be carried out on the power generation, transmission, and \ndistribution systems. This has been exacerbated by the non-availability of spares, tools, testing \nequipment, and vehicles. Staff morale and productivity are low.

Manila. ", "34 Appendix 5 \n   \nGAS INFRASTRUCTURE  \n \nA.   Rationale \n \n1.  The  Project  component  is  consistent  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s policy  on \nrehabilitation assistance after disasters, as it is the least-cost solution for the restoration of gas \ninfrastructure.1 The most important indigenous primary energy resource in Afghanistan is natural \ngas. The infrastructure of the gas sector is in a state of decline, caused by a combination of \nfactors that include the direct effects of the wars that the country has undergone, the shortage of \nexpertise, and unavailability of spare parts and equipment due to lack of funding. The gas \nproduction, transmission, and distribution systems have severe operating problems and are in \nurgent  need  of  rehabilitation.  Gas  availability  is  grossly  inadequate  to  meet  the  current \nrequirements mainly due to loss of production facilities and high rate of leakage. The gas \nleakage is not only a loss of revenue but also a major safety hazard.  \n \n2.  The immediate problems facing the gas subsector in Afghanistan relate to (i) lack of \nequipment,  spare  parts  and  materials  to  maintain  integrity  of  operations;  (ii)  inadequate \nresources  for  repairs  and  rehabilitation  of  production  wells,  gas  processing  plant,  and \ntransmission and distribution pipelines; (iii) lack of expertise in geological and geophysical \nassessment of gas fields including gas field management and reservoir depletion; and (iv) \nabsence  of  corrosion  prevention  and  cathodic  protection  of  gathering  mains  and  of  the \ntransmission and distribution network. Eight gas fields have been discovered in the northern \npart of the country, of which three have been developed. Gas production commenced in 1967. \nIn the earlier years, most of the country\u2019s gas was exported to the Soviet Union. The export of \ngas terminated in 1987 with the end of Soviet domination in Afghanistan. \n \n3.  For domestic consumption of gas, transmission pipelines were built from Shebarghan to \nMazar-e Sharif, located at a distance of about 135 kilometers. The consumers of natural gas in \nthe two cities and smaller towns and villages in the vicinity of the transmission lines were \nconnected through distribution pipelines. The present network serves a fertilizer plant; a gas \nfired thermal power plant with a total capacity of 48 Megawatts at the fertilizer factory site; the \ncommercial sector such as bakeries, textile factory, food processing plant, etc., and domestic \nconsumers for heating and cooking. Present gas production is less than one fourth of the level \nproduced in the early 1980s. \n \n4.  The entity responsible for gas production, transmission, and distribution (Afghan Gas) \nurgently needs modern technology related to field depletion and reservoir management.  The \nreservoir pressures have decreased significantly, and a large number of production wells have \nbeen  shut  down.    Some  of  the  nonproducing  wells  have  to  be  worked-over  to  enhance \nproduction and to prolong the life of the fields. Gas availability is inadequate to meet current \ndemand due to loss of production facilities and high rate of leakage; 30% of the gas currently \nproduced leaks to the atmosphere, as several transmission and distribution pipelines have \ncorroded.  There  is  no  cathodic  protection  system  installed,  which  leaves  buried  pipelines \nexposed to corrosion. In many places gas pipelines have been constructed without adhering to \nsafety standards and industry good practices. The transmission and distribution systems will \nhave to be rehabilitated and upgraded. Condensates and other pollutant effluents are presently \nbeing discharged in areas adjacent to the gas transmission lines which poses health hazards for \nwhich mitigation measures are urgently required.  \n                                                 \n1  Based on the findings of Technical Assistance Cluster 3874- AFG: Capacity Building for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment for $14.5 million, which included oil and gas sector among others \n ", "                      Appendix 5  35\n5.  It is proposed to increase the availability of gas by rehabilitation of wells, upgrading of \nproduction facilities, and repair and rehabilitation of transmission and distribution pipelines.  The \nproposed Project will optimize the use of indigenous natural gas and reduce dependence on \npetroleum fuel. The increased supply of natural gas will also help curtail the demand for fuel \nwood,  thereby  reducing  deforestation.  Fuel  wood  accounts  for  about  75%  of  total  energy \nsupplies, and constitutes the basic source of energy for cooking and heating in rural areas, \nwhere  the  majority  of  the  population  live.  Long-term  sustainability  requires  promoting  the \ndevelopment of natural gas resources on a least\u2013cost basis in an environmentally sound and \nsocially acceptable way. There is an immediate need for external assistance in the rehabilitation \nof the current infrastructure facilities and in the further development of the sector. The project \ncomponents will enhance environmental and safety standards, reduce ecological problems, and \npromote efficiency of natural gas use. In light of the above, the Government has given high \npriority to the rehabilitation and development of natural gas as a significant source of energy in \nthe country. \n \nB.   Objectives and Scope \n \n6.  The main objective of this project component is to increase indigenous natural gas \nproduction, transmission, and distribution capability by rehabilitating and repairing the integrated \ngas  supply  and  distribution  system  while  enhancing  environmental  and  safety  standards, \npromoting improved efficiency of natural gas use, and strengthening the institutional capabilities \nof Afghan Gas for the future development of the gas sector. \n \n7.  The gas infrastructure in the country is poorly managed, mainly due to the shutdown of a \nnumber of production wells, closure of gas processing facilities, and high rate of gas losses from \nthe transmission and distribution network. There is lack of geological and geophysical expertise \nin the country, which urgently needed to establish the gas field management strategy and to \ndetermine  the  optimum  field  depletion  policy  as  reservoir  pressures  have  decreased \nsignificantly. The scope of work will encompass a wide range of rehabilitation activities. The \nproducing gas fields need to be rehabilitated to enhance gas production and to prolong the life \nof the fields. Some of the nonproducing wells have to be worked over, and the wells that were \nuncompleted need to be reevaluated. The quality of gas from some of the wells is not suitable \nas feedstock for fertilizer production due to the high hydrogen sulfide content in particular gas \nbearing zones. A skid\u2013mounted gas processing plant needs to be installed for hydrogen sulfide \nremoval, as rehabilitation of the present plant is not cost effective. Gas losses due to pipeline \nleakage are a major safety hazard in addition to a colossal loss of revenue, because the \ntransmission and distribution pipelines have severe corrosion problems and need to be partly \nreplaced or repaired to eliminate leak. A cathodic protection system needs to be installed for the \nburied pipelines to safeguard against corrosion. The pipeline capacity has been reduced as a lot \nof  condensate  has  accumulated  due  to  lack  of  dew  point  depression.  Therefore,  pigging \nfacilities need to be installed to clean the pipelines internally. \n \nC.  Components and Output \n \n8.  The project component comprises (i) provision for two mobile rigs to carry out work over \nactivities for 12 gas wells; (ii) provision for two complete well wire line units to carry out down-\nhole flow tests,;(iii) supply and installation of one skid-mounted gas sweetening plant; (iv) two \ncontainerized gas production testing laboratories; (v) repair and reconstruction of corroded gas \ntransmission  lines  including  installation  of  pigging  facilities  and  condensate  disposal \narrangements;  (vi)  repair  and  reconstruction  of  corroded  gas  distribution  lines  including \ninstallation of city gate stations; (vii) cathodic protection system for corrosion mitigation of \n ", "36 Appendix 5 \n   \ntransmission  and  distribution  pipelines;  (viii)  chemicals,  tools,  equipment,  spare  parts, \ninstrumentation,  piping  and  assemblies,  and  vehicles;  (ix)  consulting  services  for  design, \nengineering, project management, and construction supervision; (x) contracting services for gas \nwells rehabilitation, and repairs and reconstruction of gas transmission and distribution facilities; \nand (xi) institutional strengthening and training of Afghan Gas. \n \nD.

Introduction   \n \n1.  The  Emergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Project  involves \nreconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  key  infrastructure  in  transport  and  energy  sectors:  (i) \nrehabilitation  of  the  471  km  of  the  national  road  network  (Pule  Khumri  -  Mazar  Sharif  - \nSheberghan \u2013 Andkhoy section of the ring road) including the international link to Uzbekistan \n(Naibabad  \u2013  Hairatan  section);  (ii)  power  infrastructure  component  \u2014  urgently  needed \nreconstruction and rehabilitation of transmission lines in the northern provinces and Kabul \ndistribution  system;  and  (iii)  gas  infrastructure  component  \u2013  urgently  needed  repairs  and \nrehabilitation of gas production, transmission and distribution facilities. The poverty and social \nanalysis has been prepared following the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Handbook for Poverty and \nSocial Analysis (2001).  \n \n2.  This Social Screening Framework was prepared for the Project as required under ADB\u2019s \nsocial safeguard policy. The Framework outlines the policy and procedures for preparation of \nproject components, which require mitigation measures in particular related to land acquisition. \nThe  implementing  agencies  (IA\u2019s)  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  social  screening  plans \n(SSP\u2019s) for subprojects as outlined in this framework and will submit the same to the Executing \nAgency (EA) and ADB for review and approval.   \n \nB.  Social Screening Framework  \n \n3.  ADB policy requires (i) preparation of social assessment; (ii) avoiding or minimizing \nimpacts where possible;  (iii) consultation with beneficiaries and affected people in project \nplanning and implementation, including disclosure of Project-related information; (iv) payment of \ncompensation for acquired assets at the market/replacement value; (v) assistance to affected \npeople, including nontitled persons (e.g., informal dwellers/squatters, and encroachers); (vi) \nspecial attention to vulnerable people and groups; and (vii) income restoration and rehabilitation \nprogram according to ADB\u2019s policies on Involuntary Resettlement (mcmxcv) and Indigenous \nPeople (mcmxcviii), as amended from time to time.   \n  \nC.  Procedures for Preparing Social Screening Plans  \n \n4.  The SSP for each component will be prepared as follows: The IA concerned with the \nassistance of the consultant for the road component will carry out social impact assessment \nsurveys for identified project components, based on preliminary technical designs; in case of \nadverse impact on affected persons, IA\u2019s will prepare an SSP for each component, with the \nassistance of the screening and monitoring consultant, for submission to ADB.  \n \n5.  The EA will ensure that the consultant responsible for resettlement plan (RP) preparation \nis aware of the framework and procedures for social assessment and resettlement planning so \nthat appropriate entitlements and mitigation measures are established in the RP. The EA and \nIA\u2019s will further ensure that resettlement budgets are delivered on time to the local office for \ntimely RP implementation. The consultants will assist the IA\u2019s in the following: (i) conducting \ncensus, socioeconomic survey, and asset inventory work to identify impacts and options; (ii) \npreparing an entitlement matrix; (iii) conducting consultation and participation procedures with \nall stakeholders, especially the people affected by planning and management; (iv) preparing \nspecific measures to improve the status and incomes of the poor and vulnerable groups; (v) \npreparing  a  detailed  budget  and  implementation  schedules;  (vi)  making  management ", "                          Appendix 10   45\n   \narrangements; and (vii) preparing arrangements for internal and independent monitoring and \nevaluation. \n \nD.  Institutional Responsibilities  \n \n6.  For subprojects that require a SSP, the EA will have overall coordination, planning, \nimplementation, and financing responsibilities. An IA staff member will be appointed as social \ndevelopment officer to supervise the implementation work. The EA will ensure that the IA \nresponsible for SSP preparation for subprojects is aware of the framework and procedures for \nSSP planning so that appropriate mitigation measures are established in the SSP. \n \nE.  Consultation and Disclosure \n \n7.  Consultation and disclosure requirements will be simplified, taking into consideration the \nuncertain security situation. Each SSP will be prepared and implemented in close consultation \nwith the stakeholders, particularly with the Project-affected people. The SSP will be discussed \nduring meetings at the village/community level.  \n \nF.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n8.  The EA will establish a quarterly monitoring system involving itself and the IA\u2019s and will \nprepare progress reports on all aspects of land acquisition and social development activities. \nThe screening and monitoring consultants will monitor the implementation of the SSP\u2019s and will \nreport to ADB on the progress of SSP implementation in quarterly progress reports, including \nfulfillment of the safeguard measures.  \n ", "46   Appendix 11 \n \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nSector identified as a National Priority in  Yes  Sector identified as a National Priority  No PPA \nCountry Poverty Analysis?    in Country Poverty Partnership  yet \n  Agreement?   \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Afghanistan. \n \nMuch of Afghanistan\u2019s infrastructure was destroyed and damaged during 20 years of war. War also \nprevented  new  investments  from  taking  place.  Reestablishing  and  restoring  essential  infrastructure, \nparticularly the road network and power and gas supplies is critical for the revival and resumption of \neconomic activities, which would contribute to employment creation, income generation, rehabilitation of \ndisplaced populations and ex-combatants, improvement of security and stability, inter-ethnic reconciliation, \nand political unification of the country. The poor, who constitute the majority of Afghan\u2019s population, will \nbenefit directly through job opportunities for unskilled and semiskilled laborers during the reconstruction of \ninfrastructure facilities. Furthermore, the Project will also provide social and economic opportunity to the \nbeneficiaries, particularly the poor, that will help to reduce poverty.     \n \nThe Project will contribute to economic recovery, diversification of activities, employment generation, \nhigher productivity, improved per capita income, increased revenue generation, improved efficiency and \neffectiveness of the public sector, private sector development, environmental preservation, and social \nstability. Specific beneficiaries will include the rural and urban poor, displaced populations, demobilized \ncombatants, and women. Specifically, the benefits will be directly or indirectly attributable to different \nproject components. Energy development will (i) improve energy \u2013 gas and electricity supply in terms of \nquantity, quality, stability, safety, and environmental impact; (ii) improve household quality of life; (iii) revive \nindustries and establish new ones; (iv) contribute to energy security and self-reliance; (v) promote private \nsector activities including those owned and operated by women; and (vi) improve electricity supply to \nKabul, which is the political and economic hub of the country; (vii) make natural gas available where \ndemand exists and also for stimulating demand for gas away from alternative sources such as fuel wood, \nand imported oil; and (viii) make gas supply safe, avoiding the present problem of leakage. Production \nfrom manufacturing industries will increase substantially due to improved supply of power, oil, and gas, \nespecially in and around major urban locations such as Kabul, Kunduz, Mazar Sharif, Pule Khumri, and \nSheberghan. The output of service establishments will get a boost from the improved energy supply. Tariff \ncollection will increase, improving the financial viability of power and gas distribution; the Government \nsubsidy can be reduced or eliminated; and revenue from taxes will go up. Indigenous gas will save foreign \nexchange currently used to import energy. Increased and secure power supply will encourage private \nsector investments in all sectors, particularly manufacturing, commerce, and services. Improved power \nsupply will improve the supply of safe water and the quality of health services. Improvement in health care \ndelivery will bring down maternal mortality. The Project will optimize the use of natural gas and curtail the \ndemand for fuel wood, thereby saving forests. \nRoad transport development will (i) improve the national road network; (ii) improve the maintenance of \nroads; (iii) facilitate the movement of humanitarian aid through the northern corridor; (iv) reduce the cost of \ntransportation; (v) promote international and regional trade; (vi) increase the income of vulnerable groups \nin rural and urban areas; (vii) build up the capacity of local contractors for construction, rehabilitation, and \nmaintenance of major roads and bridges; and (viii) promote environmental preservation. Production from \nmanufacturing industries\u2014small, medium, and large\u2014will increase substantially due to improved supply of \nmachinery, equipment, and materials and to better marketing prospects. Toll collection will increase, and \nGovernment tax revenue will go up from income, corporate, and trade taxes.  Road rehabilitation and  ", "                                    Appendix 11  47\n \nreconstruction  will  open  up  a  wide  range  of  opportunities  for  the  private  sector  involved  in  road \nconstruction, production, trade, transport, and services. Rehabilitated roads will improve the supply of and \naccess to health services. The road component will assist some of the most vulnerable groups in the \ncountry in their repatriation, resettlement, and reintegration within their communities; provide livelihood and \ndevelop the capacity and skills that provide sustainability. Women's welfare will be promoted through \nimproved  availability  and  access  to  social  services,  including  education  and  health.  Private  sector \ndevelopment will open up opportunities for women entrepreneurs.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                              Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \n \nAfghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, with an estimated 2002 population of 27.8 million. \nPoverty has worsened over the past two decades, with an estimated 60\u201380% of the population living \nbelow the threshold of $1 a day1 or consuming below the Food and Agriculture Organization requirement \nof 2,453 kilocalories; 70% of the Afghan population is malnourished, and only 13% have access to \nimproved water resources. Six million Afghans are vulnerable, include small farmers, landless laborers, \nex-combatants, war widows, war orphans, debtors, sharecroppers, returning refugees, internally displaced \npersons (1.1 million), the abandoned, and the disabled (800,000, of whom 200,000 are mine victims) \u2013 in \nneed of basic food items, medical supplies, clean drinking water, etc. Nonmaterial poverty as reflected in \nphysical and social insecurity; isolation; marginalization; alienation; and ethnic, religious, and gender \ndiscrimination further pushes many Afghanis deeper down the poverty ladder.2 \n \nTwo decades of war have prevented any progress that might otherwise have occurred, and on the \ncontrary have made the situation worse. In 1996, Afghanistan ranked 169th (of 174 countries) in the UN \nHuman Development Index. Access to education in Afghanistan is limited, and the quality of the education \nis very poor. The primary gross enrolment rate has been most recently estimated at 39% for boys and 3% \nfor girls. The situation in health is equally grim. According to the World Bank report (2002),3 infant mortality \nis estimated to be one of the highest in the world at around 165 per 1,000 live births, while 257 of every \n1,000 live births die before they are five. The maternal mortality rate is estimated to be 1,700 per 100,000 \nlive births, and life expectancy at birth is estimated at around 41 years of age.  \n \nAfghanistan's economy was traditionally based mainly on agriculture and animal husbandry. Most recently, \nAfghanistan has been hit by a severe, protracted drought that started in 1999 and has lasted until the \npresent. Crop production has been halved, and livestock herds are heavily depleted. Large and increasing \nnumbers of people have lost their means of livelihood. The impact of the drought, which would have been \nserious under any circumstances, has been aggravated by the run-down condition of irrigation systems \nand other agricultural infrastructure. An estimated 4.3 million people will be facing food deficits in 2003 \nuntil the next harvest.4 \n \nBy  the  mid-1990s  most  of  the  country\u2019s  limited  modern  infrastructure  \u2013  roads,  bridges,  irrigation, \ntelecommunications, and electricity \u2013 had been damaged and destroyed, and traditional irrigation systems \nsuffered greatly from destruction and lack of maintenance. This is particularly true for major national roads, \nand  power  generation,  transmission  and  distribution  infrastructure,  and  natural  gas  production  and \ndistribution infrastructure. In sum, Afghanistan's economic structure has been greatly weakened, distorted, \nand made more vulnerable through two decades of conflict and 4 years of drought.  While no systematic \npoverty study is available, poverty is associated with low economic growth and the collapse of employment \nopportunities due to a long period of war.  \n                                                 \n1 Reliable data on poverty indicators are not available.

A preliminary economic analysis of the three components of the Project has been carried \nout.  The  findings  and  assumptions,  summarized  in  the  following  paragraphs,  suggest  that \ninvestment in road and energy infrastructure is economically justified. However, the encouraging \nresults are predicated upon certain assumptions regarding achievement of sector restructuring \nand policy reforms as anticipated under the Postconflict Multisector Program Loan leading to \nimprovement  of  operational  and  administrative  efficiency  that  will,  among  others,  call  for \nstreamlining  of  tariff  structure,  accounting,  billing  and  revenue  collection,  as  appropriate. \nAdequate  resources  will  be  needed  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  assets \nrehabilitated under the Project.   \n \nA.  Road Infrastructure \n \n2.  An economic evaluation of the road rehabilitation component of the Project has been \ncarried out that weighs the savings in vehicle operating costs (VOCs) and travel time costs \ngained by the Project against the initial investment costs and the savings in future periodic and \nroutine maintenance costs over a 20-year period. In carrying out this evaluation, a maintenance \nstrategy was adopted in the base case (without Project) scenario that assumed minimal periodic \nmaintenance would be carried out. This reflects the current situation. Base year (2003) daily \ntraffic data collected through 24-hour traffic counts on selected links show a vehicle count of \n1505 for Pule Khumri to Naibabad Junction, 1716 for Naibabad Junction to Hairatan, 2819 for \nNaibabad  Junction  to  Mazar  Sharif,  2049  for  Mazar  Sharif  to  Sheberghan,  and  639  for \nSheberghan to Andkhoy. Traffic growth rates over the evaluation period were taken to match \n(Asian Development Bank) staff\u2019s estimates of Gross Domestic Product growth.1 \n \n3.  VOCs and travel time costs were calculated for seven types of vehicles2 using Highway \nDesign  Model  roughness  \u2013  VOC  and  roughness  \u2013  speed  relationships.  Based  on  various \nassumptions regarding occupancy, value of time per car is estimated at $0.38 plus $0.13 per \npassenger, going up to $0.50 per truck plus $0.25 per passenger (excluding crew members, \nwhose time is valued in VOC). These values are derived from the average wage required to \nmeet  minimum  food  requirements  for  bus  passengers  and  a  premium  over  it  for  truck \npassengers. No allowance is made for nonwork-related travel. All calculations are done on the \nbasis  of  normal  traffic,  (projected  traffic  that  will  occur  both  without  or  with  the  Project), \nexcluding generated traffic which makes estimated economic returns on the conservative side. \nLack  of  data  did  not  permit  consideration  of  accident  cost  savings,  thereby  further \nunderestimating benefits.     \n \n4.  A factor of 0.9 was used to convert financial construction and maintenance costs to \neconomic costs. The economic evaluation3 indicates that the overall Project is economically \nviable, with an (Economic Internal Rate of Return) of 31.5% and a net present value (NPV) of \n$167.5 million. Table A12.1 shows the EIRR and NPV of the project road, as well as its various \nsections. \n                                                 \n1  9.7% (2003), 9.7% (2004), 7.8% (2005), 6.4% (2006 -2010), 5.4% (2011 - 2015), and 5.0% (2016 - 2025). \n2 Car, PU/4WD, minibus, large bus, medium truck, and heavy truck with distribution being 11.4%, 17.2%, 47.8%, \n6.6%, 5.1%, and 11.9% obtained from traffic survey. \n3  Contribution of travel-time savings to the benefit stream is less than 10%.

Sensitivity tests were carried out to investigate the robustness of the economic viability \nof the project component to cost overrun and reduction in benefits. The results of the sensitivity \ntests carried out on the total project component comprising all road links are summarized in \nTable A12.2. Sensitivity was also tested by decreasing benefits by 20 percent and increasing \ncosts by 20 percent and both. These sensitivity tests demonstrate that the overall Project is very \nrobust to variations in construction cost and benefits. Similarly reduction of traffic growth rates \nby 25 percent and 50 percent reduces EIRR to 29 percent and 26.5 percent respectively. These \nsensitivity tests demonstrate that the overall Project component is very robust to increase in \nconstruction cost, implementation delays and reduction in traffic growth. \nTable A12.2: Sensitivity Analysis - Road Component \n \nSensitivity Test  EIRR   NPV \n(%)  ($ million)\nBase Case  31.5  167.5 \nBenefits Decreased by 20%  26.5  122.7 \nInitial Construction Costs Increased by 20%  27.0  156.0 \nBenefits Decreased by 20% and Initial Construction Costs \n23.5  110.2 \nincreased by 20% \n \nB.  Power Infrastructure \n \n6.  The  DABM  is  (DABM)  quasi-government  enterprise  in  the  power  sector,  and  is \nresponsible for O & M, of Afghanistan\u2019s power infrastructure. DABM is responsible for about \n80% of the country\u2019s electricity production, with the Ministry of Mines and Industry accounting \nfor  the  balance.  System  (technical  and  nontechnical)  losses  are  estimated  at  45%  in  the \ndistribution system, and another 46% is estimated as commercial loss. \n \n7.  The economic analysis of power import options was carried out excluding revenues. \nBenefits attributed to the project were shares of the ADB\u2019s growth projections (low case) for the \nmanufacturing and trade sectors. These \u201cenergy-dependent\u201d shares consist of 25% projected \ngrowth to 2015 and 10% thereafter for the remainder of the 20-year operating period under \nassessment.  The  economic  evaluation  indicates  that  the  overall  project  component  is \neconomically viable, with an EIRR of 32.2% and a NPV of $414 million. Sensitivity tests were \ncarried out to investigate the robustness of the project component to variations in the initial \nconstruction  cost,  resulting  cost  overrun,  and  variations  in  revenue  benefits  resulting  from \nreduced collection and/or leakage in transmission and distribution.  The results of the sensitivity \ntests carried out on the entire project component, summarized in Table A12.3, demonstrate that ", "                            Appendix 12  51\nthe overall project component is very robust to variations in costs and benefits. A combined cost \nescalation of 20% and benefit reduction of 20% results in a decline of EIRR to 22.8%, still well \nwithin the acceptable range.  \nTable A12. 3: Sensitivity Analysis - Power Component \n \nSensitivity Test  EIRR (%)  NPV \n  ($ million) \nBase Case   32.2  414.2 \nBenefits Decreased by 20%  26.8  278.0 \nCosts Increased by 20%  27.8  360.9 \nBenefits Decreased by 20% and Costs Increased \n22.8  224.7 \nby 20% \n \nC.  Gas Infrastructure \n \n8.  The economic analysis for the gas component was calculated on the basis of estimated \ncapital costs of $20.1 million divided equally between production and transmission. O&M costs \nare assumed to be 5% of total capital costs. Rehabilitation of existing pipeline and production \nwells appears to be the least-cost option compared with the drilling of new wells and/or building \nnew pipeline. The economic benefits of rehabilitating transmission and distribution facilities \nconsist of revenues from the sale of an additional 320,000 cubic meters per day. Additional \nsupply is attributed to 250,000 cubic meters savings from losses and 70,000 cubic meters from \nnew production. Revenue has been calculated at current tariff averages of $12.13 per 1,000 \ncubic meters. End consumer tariff is $10.87 for the fertilizer factory, $16.74 for power plants, \n$22.83 for commercial clients, and $16.74 for domestic users. Prices are for 1,000 cubic meters. \nCollection rates are poor now. Future collection rates are put at 75% for the fertilizer plant, \npower plants, and commercial clients, and 50% for domestic users, giving an average collection \nrate of 69.1%. It is assumed that gas has to be supplied over 300 operating days a year, taking \ninto account breakdown, shutdown of the fertilizer factory, and other consumers. \n \n9.  The economic evaluation indicates that the overall project component is economically \nviable, with an EIRR of 34.7% and a NPV of $34.1 million. Sensitivity tests were carried out to \ninvestigate  the  robustness  of  the  gas  component  of  the  Project  to  variations  in  the  initial \nconstruction  cost  resulting  cost  overrun  and  variations  in  revenue  benefits  resulting  from \nreduced collection and/or leakage in transmission and distribution. The results, summarized in \nTable A12.4, indicate that the overall project component is very robust to variations in costs and \nbenefits. A combined cost escalation of 20% and benefit reduction of 20% results in a decline of \nEIRR to 23.4% and NPV to $18.4 million, both still high compared with alternatives. \n \nTable A12.4: Sensitivity Analysis - Gas Component \n \nSensitivity Test  EIRR  NPV \n(%)  ($ million)\nBase Case  34.7  34.1 \nBenefits Decreased by 20%  28.1  22.8 \nInitial Construction Costs Increased by 20%  29.3  29.7 \nBenefits Decreased by 20% and Initial Construction Costs \n23.4  18.4 \nIncreased by 20% ", "52   Appendix 13 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n \n1.  For the purpose of working out the financial internal rates of return (FIRRs), the Project \nhas been divided and individually analyzed into two segments: (i) gas sector rehabilitation, and \n(ii) power sector rehabilitation. The assumptions for the different segments are discussed in the \nfollowing paragraphs. The rate of exchange has been assumed as $1.00 = Afs46. \n \nA.  Power Infrastructure \n \n2.  Based on available information, the power supply is weak regarding reliable power \ngeneration as well as having damaged transmission and distribution systems. The technical \nlosses in transmission are estimated at 5% and 20% in the Kabul distribution system at 20%. \nDue to the lack of a sufficient number of meters and of efficient administration for meter reading \nand billing, the nontechnical losses are currently estimated at 20%, making the total system \nlosses in the distribution system as high as 45%. Collection efficiency is also extremely poor, \n54%. The collection/generation ratio for Kabul is estimated at around 30% only. Restructuring \nand training efforts are essential to reduce the losses and thus the heavy burden on the \ngovernment budget. These efforts have to be carried out simultaneously with a review of the \ncurrent tariff structure to be able to achieve financial sustainability in the sector. \n \n3.  The  financial  evaluation  of  the  Project  was  carried  out  in  real  terms  and  on  an \nincremental basis by comparing \u201cwith Project\u201d and \u201cwithout Project\u201d scenarios. The assumptions \nwere as follows: \n \n(i)  In the base case, the revenues were calculated at the current average tariff, 2.4 \nUS cents/kilowatt-hour (kWh) \n \n(ii)  The average generation cost, 0.9 US cents/kWh is based on hydropower at 0.5 \nUS cents/kWh and, during the four winter months (6 hours/day), gas turbine \ngeneration at 13 US cents/kWh as additional supply. \n \n(iii)  Based on the project investments, the technical and nontechnical losses in the \nKabul distribution system are expected to be reduced from the current 45% to \n30%. \n \n(iv)  Operational, maintenance, and administration costs are estimated at 5% of the \ninvested capital. \n \n(v)  In achieving the estimated benefits, (a) investments funded by the World Bank, \nKreditanstalt f\u1ee7r Wiederaufbau, and the European Commission; (b) investments \nin  the  northern  distribution  system;  and  (c)  investments  in  the  remaining \ntransmission link to Kabul are included in the capital cost (8, 20, 5 and 20 million \nUS$, respectively). \n \n4.  Based  on  existing  tariffs,  limited  technical  resources,  as  well  as  lack  of  accurate \nadministration, DABM is currently not financially viable. To make this project component viable \nand at the same time bring DABM back to financial sustainability without heavy subsidies from \nthe government budget, major restructuring efforts are needed. To reflect possible opportunities, \ntwo scenarios have been analyzed aside from the above presented base case: \n \n   ", "    Appendix 13  53\n(i)  Financial  recovery  is  achieved  solely  through  improved  system  losses  in \ndistribution (from 45% to 30%, equivalent to an expected collection/generation \nratio  of  38%  compared  with  the  current  30%)  derived  from  the  Project  and \nincreased tariffs from current average 2.4 US cents/kWh to 7.3 US cents/kWh to \nattain 15% FIRR for this Project. \n \n(ii)  In attaining the same FIRR, 15%, the second scenario assumes major efforts in \nimproving the administration of meter reading, billing, and collection to avoid too \nsteep tariff increases. If the commercial losses can be brought down to 40% from \nthe currently estimated at 46% (equivalent to a collection/generation ratio of \n42%), the average tariff needed will instead be 6.5 US cents/kWh.  \n \n \nB.  Gas Infrastructure \n \n5.  Based on available information, the gas supply is in very poor condition regarding both \nthe gas fields and the transmission/distribution systems. The physical losses are estimated at \n30%,  mainly  due  to  leaks  in  the  transmission  and  distribution  systems.  Based  on  almost \nnonexisting  collection,  Afghan  Gas  is  currently  not  a  financially  viable  company.  Major \nrestructuring efforts are needed regarding operation; administration including accounting, billing, \nand revenue collection; as well as review of the current tariff structure to be able to bring the \nfinancial performance back to profitability. \n \n6.

The  financial  evaluation  of  the  Project  was  carried  out  in  real  terms  and  on  an \nincremental  basis  by  comparing  the  \u201cwith  Project\u201d  and  \u201cwithout  Project\u201d  scenarios.  The \nassumptions were as follows: \n \n(i)  Revenue was calculated at current rates and volumes as presented by Afghan \nGas. \n \n ", "54   Appendix 13 \n(ii)  Collection rates are based on the assumption of restructured Afghan Gas, fully \ncapable of metering, billing, and collecting (Table A13.2). \n \nTable A13.2: Collection Rate \n \nConsumer  Collection (%) \nFertilizer Plants  75 \nPower Plants  75 \nCommercial  75 \nDomestic  50 \n     Total Collected Revenues       44.1% \n \n(iii)  Costs  for  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  gas  fields,  transmission  and \ndistribution  pipelines,  as  well  as  administration,  are  assumed  at  5%  of  the \nestimated project cost. \n \n(iv)  No transmission and distribution losses were considered. \n \n \n8.  Based  on  existing  tariffs,  limited  technical  resources,  as  well  as  lack  of  accurate \nadministration, Afghan Gas is currently not financially viable. To make this project component \nviable and at the same time bring Afghan Gas back to financial sustainability without heavy \nsubsidies  from  the  government  budget,  major  restructuring  efforts  are  needed  to  improve \noperational efficiency, reduce losses, and enhance collection. However, the major factor to \nachieve 14.9% FIRR is through a 3.65 times increase in existing tariffs,1 which are extremely \nlow, heavily subsidized, and unrealistic. \n \nC.  Conclusion \n9.  Based on the current total losses; technical, nontechnical and commercial in the power \nsector, this component is not financial viable. However, as this component will have major \npositive impact on the country\u2019s economy and is urgently needed, it is essential that the above-\nmentioned restructuring measures along with tariff restructuring are implemented. Without these \nmeasures, the Power Sector will continue to be a major burden on government resources.

Given the present level of tariffs, which are significantly below the current market prices \nin neighboring countries, compounded by the poor collection rates, the gas sector component is \nnot financially viable. Though the technical losses will be minimized through the proposed \nrehabilitation and reconstruction of the facilities, major improvements in collection rates and \ntariff rationalization are required.

For the gas and power components, the Project includes capacity building efforts at the \noperational level that will the improve operation and maintenance capacity of DABM and Afghan \nGas.  The  Project\u2013proposed  enhancement  in  tariff,  reduction  of  technical  and  nontechnical \nlosses, and increase in collection rates are critical for financial sustainability of these institutions. \nTables A13.3 and A13.4 demonstrate that financial viability could be achieved through a variety \nof measures. Major institutional improvements have a key role in achieving these objectives. It \nis recognized that full cost recovery will take time.

Description of Environmental Condition of the Project Area \n \n1.  Project Area Affected by Road Component \n \n3.  The project area connecting Pule Khumri \u2013 Naibabad \u2013 Hairatan (244 km) lies at an \naltitude of 400 meters above sea level. The topography is mostly plain, and rolling in a few \nsections while the section connecting Pule-Khumri to Naubabad passes hilly terrain. Land use \nalong the road is mainly rangeland, agricultural land (e.g., orchards and irrigated agriculture), \nand residential area. The road crosses two rivers (Pule-Khumri and Jasmesher Spring), which \nhave water only during the spring and early summer seasons, and are dry during the remaining \nseasons. No lakes or ponds are located in the corridor of this road. There is no ecologically \nsensitive area along the road corridor. \n    \n4.  The topography of the corridor area of road connecting Naibabad \u2013 Mazar Sharif \u2013 \nSheberghan - Andkhoy (203 km) is mostly plain. The road passes mainly desert, rangeland, and \nresidential areas. Two rivers (Tanji Tajkargaon and Puleackcha) are crossed by this road. They \nare filled by water only during the spring and early summer seasons. No lakes or ponds are \nfound in the corridor of this road. No ecologically sensitive area is involved in this project area. \n \n5.  The project roads runs through 71 villages. The population densities are very low. In the \nentire project area, water supply and sanitation facilities do not exist. Energy supply is mostly \nfrom firewood, crop residues, and animal wastes.  \n \n2.  Project Area Affected by Power Distribution and Transmission Component \n \n6.  Kabul and its surroundings are the main area of the power distribution component. The \narea  is  one  of  the  busiest  cities  in  Afghanistan.  The  existing  environmental  problems  are \ndominated  by  problems  related  to  domestic  activities  and  the  traffic  sector.  The  existing \ndistribution line still has very good concentric concrete poles. The facility in the substation is \nbadly damaged. The area is mainly residential area, and no environmentally sensitive area is \ninvolved.  \n \n3.  Project Area Affected by Gas Component \n \n7.  The existing gas pipeline covers mainly the area from the border of Uzbekistan, passing \nthrough Amu Darya and Sheberghan, and ending in Mazar Sharif. The topography along the \npipeline is mainly plain. The project area is mostly irrigated. Land use along the pipeline is \nmainly agricultural (vineyards, orchards, and gardens). Neither the existing protected area nor \nthe proposed protected area is located in the project area. \n \nD.  Potential Impact and Mitigation Measures \n \n  1.   Road Component \n \n8.  There will be no significant environmental impact due to siting of these project roads, \nbecause the Project will be executed only on existing roads and none of them are located in an \nenvironmentally sensitive area. The environmental impacts associated with the construction \nstage will include (i) disruption of traffic in the construction area, (ii) increased air pollution due \nto increasing dust and other volatile chemical substances from the asphalt plant, (iii) noise and \nvibration, (iv) disruption of the water system due to cut and filling and other earthworks, and (v) \npotential landslides associated with elevating some parts of the road. These impacts will occur \n ", "58   Appendix 14 \nonly during the construction period. However, mitigation measures to minimize them will be \nadopted including: (i) rerouting traffic with clear signs; (ii) maintaining the optimum moisture \ncontent during handling of soil, spraying water to minimize dust, and maintaining a safe distance \nbetween the asphalt plant and public facilities, including educational facilities; (iii) strictly control \nthe construction works that create noise and vibration by prohibiting night work in the residential \nareas; (iv) pumping out of stagnant water, and providing an  adequate drainage system; and (v) \nstabilizing road embankment side slopes, and rehabilitating bridges only in the dry season. All \nthese mitigation measures/requirements will be included in the bidding/contract documents for \nthe contractor. All these impacts are temporary and manageable. The environmental impact \nassociated with the operation of the Project is mainly on traffic safety; therefore, adequate traffic \nsigns and physical barriers to reduce motorists\u2019 speed will be adopted. The other important \nenvironmental impact that will not concentrate in the road areas is the borrow pit excavation. In \nthis context, strict borrow pit operation will be adopted (i.e., no borrow pits in fertile agriculture \nlands and area prone to erosion and landslides, restoration and rehabilitation of ex-borrow pit \nareas). \n \n2.   Power Distribution and Transmission Component \n \n9.  The  screening  of  potential  impacts  identifies  that  there  will  be  no  significant \nenvironmental impact due to siting of these distribution lines and substation, because the project \nactivities will be executed only at the existing facilities and along the road in Kabul. The potential \nenvironmental  impacts  associated  with  the  construction  stage  will  involve  mostly  traffic \ndisturbance and accidents due to electric shock. To minimize this impact a clear traffic sign will \nbe placed in the construction area and, if necessary, traffic will be rerouted. Best practices \nduring the installation of cable or distribution lines will be adopted and will be included in the \nbidding/contract documents to minimize electric shock problems. Therefore, it is clear that the \nimpacts associated with the rehabilitation of distribution lines will be very minimal and the \nmitigation measures are manageable. No environmental impacts will be associated with the \nrehabilitation of the substation, particularly related to disposal of damaged equipment (e.g., \ntransformer, conductors). This project component will not involve replacement of transformers \nand conductors, and will focus on providing new transformers to replace the missing parts. To \navoid future environmental problems, it is also recommended that this project component use \nonly  (i)  Poly  Chlorinated  Biphenyl\u2013  free  transformers  and  conductors;  and  (ii) \nchlorofluorocarbon\u2013free cooling equipment. To avoid noise problems, it is recommended to \nlocate the transformers so that noise levels from the fence will not exceed 55 decibels (db) \nduring daytime and 45 dB at night. It is clear that the proposed mitigation measures are practical \nand manageable, and all will be included in the bidding documents. The transmission line \ncomponent will focus only on replacing the missing line and fixing the existing line; therefore, no \nsignificant impact is expected due to its siting due to construction work or operation. However, \nthe establishment of temporary access roads to reach the transmission towers, and mobilizing \nthe construction material and equipment will cause temporary impacts such as increased dust \nand traffic disturbance. Mitigation measures, including watering the road and rehabilitating the \ntemporary access road, will be part of the contractor\u2019s working requirements (will be included \ninto  the  bidding/contract  document).  Similarly,  the  requirement  to  provide  clear  traffic \ninstructions  in  the  project  area  will  also  be  included  in  the  contractor\u2019s  bidding/contract \ndocuments. \n \n \n \n \n \n   ", "            Appendix 14  59\n4.  Gas Infrastructure Component \n \n10.  There will be no significant impact due to siting of this project component, because it will \nnot require any land for expansion and will not affect any protected area. However, there will be \nsome potential environmental impacts involved due to (i) the use of chemicals (e.g., to clean up \nthe corrosive pipeline, use for welding process); (ii) disposal of corrosive equipment, and (iii) \ndisposal  of  byproducts  of  the  desulfurification process.  All  of  these impacts  will  affect  the \ndownstream area, which is mostly agriculture land. Any chemical contamination into the shallow \nand  deep  groundwater  will  pollute  the  irrigation  water,  the  residues  of  these  chemical \nsubstances will be found in the agricultural products. The following mitigation measures will be \nemployed:  (i)  a  waste  management  plan  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  for  review  prior  to  executing  any  construction  work;  and  (ii)  all \nhazardous wastes (corrosive pipeline and other corrosive unused equipment) will be stored in \nclearly labeled containers and will be kept within the area belong to the Executing Agency. \n \nE.  Institutional Arrangements and Monitoring Plan \n  \n  1.   Road Component \n   \n11.  Implementation  of  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction  stage  will  be  the \nresponsibility of the contractor. An environmental engineer, who will be hired as part of the \nconsultant team for implementing Project, will assist the Implementation Agency (IA) concerned \nin preparing contract documentation so that the bidding documents, bills of quantity, and other \ncontractual obligations of the contractor identify the contractor\u2019s environmental responsibilities \nand stipulate penalties for noncompliance. In addition, the consultant will also be required to \nassist the IA concerned in monitoring the implementation of the environmental management \nplan that was described in the IEE report. \n \n2.  Power Distribution Component   \n \n12.  Implementation  of  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction  stage  will  be  the \nresponsibility  of  the  contractor.  The  environmental  consultant  engaged  for  supervising  the \nconstruction will be responsible for (i) preparing contract documentation so that the bidding \ndocuments, bills of quantity, and other contractual obligations of the contractor identify the \ncontractor\u2019s environmental responsibilities and stipulate penalties for noncompliance, and (ii) \nassisting the IA concerned in monitoring the environmental management plan described in the \nIEE report.   \n \n3.  Gas Infrastructure Component \n \n13.  The implementation of the mitigation measures during the construction stage will be the \nresponsibility  of  the  contractor.  The  environmental  consultant  engaged  for  supervising  the \nconstruction will be responsible for (i) preparing a waste management plan to be approved by \nthe IA concerned and submitted to ADB prior to commencement of any construction work; (ii) \npreparing contract documentation so that the bidding documents, bills of quantity, and other \ncontractual obligations of the contractor identify the contractor\u2019s environmental responsibilities \nand stipulate penalties for noncompliance, and (iii) assisting the IA concerned in implementing \nthe environmental management plan described in the IEE report as well as implementing the \nwaste management plan. \n   \n ", "60   Appendix 14 \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n14.  The  initial  findings  of  the  IEE  study  show  that  the  negative  environmental  impacts \nassociate with the road and power distribution components are deemed to be minor and the \nmitigation measures will be incorporated into the contract document for the contractor. The gas \ncomponent will involve environmental impacts related to hazardous wastes due to unused or \ndamaged equipment that has to be disposed of or chemical wastes due to spillage, leakage, \nand byproducts. Therefore, an environmental consultant will be hired to assist in preparing a \nwaste management plan. Nonetheless, all the proposed mitigation measures for all project \ncomponents are manageable, and a full environmental impact assessment to assess further \nimpacts of the Project is not required. \n \n15.  The Project will generate environmental benefits, particularly because of the availability \nof electricity, and improve access to basic services due to the improvement of roads. All the \nproposed mitigation measures are manageable, and therefore a full Executing Implementation \nAgency to assess further impacts of the Project is not required. \n \n16.  It is, however, recommended that the IA concerned for gas infrastructure needs to be \ntrained to strengthen its capability to deal with hazardous substance and wastes. \n \nG.  Conclusion \n \n17.  The  Project  will  generate  environmental  benefits,  particularly  in  improving  the \nenvironmental performance in gas sector, by reducing deforestation through reduction in the \nuse of firewood because of the availability of electricity, and improve access to basic services \ndue  to  the  improvement  of  roads.  However,  the  environmental  costs  due  to  potential \nenvironmental problems associated with the hazardous wastes need to be carefully mitigated. \nAll  the  proposed  mitigation  measures  are  manageable,  and  therefore  a  full  Executing \nImplementation Agency to assess further impacts of the Project is not required. \n \n \n \n \n   "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R81-03 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20030514150313Z", "Title": "R81-03", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 5.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20030603173818+08'00'"}}
