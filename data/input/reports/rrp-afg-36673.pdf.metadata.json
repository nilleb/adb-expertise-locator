Revival  of \n\nTransitional Islamic State of Afghanistan \n \nPoverty Classification: Poverty intervention \nThematic Classification: Economic growth \n \nCategory B   \n \n \nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  (i)  447  kilometers  (km)  of  the \nprimary  national  road  network,  including  the  link  to  Uzbekistan;  (ii)  power \ntransmission lines in the northern provinces and the distribution system in \nKabul;  and  (iii)  damaged  gas  production,  transmission,  and  distribution \nfacilities in Sheberghan, including the natural gas pipeline to Mazar Sharif. \n \nMost  of  the  infrastructure  in  Afghanistan  is  destroyed  or  damaged  due  to \ntwo  decades  of  war.  Lack  of  resources  and  of  capacity  prevented \nmaintenance,  which  led  to  major  deterioration  and  in  some  cases  loss  of \ninfrastructure. This is particularly true for major national roads, power and \nnatural  gas \nthe  economy  of  Afghanistan  and \nresumption of growth depends critically on reconstruction and rehabilitation \nof  this  key  infrastructure,  which  could  contribute  to  employment  creation, \nincome  generation  at  the  household  level,  rehabilitation  of  displaced \npopulations  and  excombatants,  improvement  of  security  and  stability, \ninterethnic reconciliation, and political unification of the country. The Project \nwill  contribute  to  reviving  the  economic  activities  across  the  country, \nthereby providing employment and reducing poverty. \n \nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  help  the  Islamic  Transitional \nGovernment of Afghanistan (Government) restore key infrastructure in the \ntransport  (roads)  and  energy  (power  and  gas)  sectors.  The  Project  will \nhave the following parts: \n  \nPart  A:  Road  Infrastructure:  urgently  needed  repair  and  rehabilitation  of \nthe  Pule  Khumri  \u2013  Mazar  Sharif  \u2013  Sheberghan  \u2013  Andkhoy  section  of  the \nring  road  (392  km),  including  the  link  to  Uzbekistan  (Naibabad  \u2013  Hairatan \nroad, 55 km) \n  \nPart  B:  Power  Infrastructure:  (i)  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  230 \ncircuit-kilometers  (cct-km)  of  220  kilovolt  (kV)  and  50  cct-km  of  110  kV \ntransmission lines; (ii) reconstruction of Khulum and Pule Khumri 220/110 \nkV  substations;  (iii)  reconstruction  of  distribution  substations,  junctions, \ntransformers,  equipment,  cables,  and  material;  (iv)  electricity  service \ndelivery including installation of 30,000 meters and utilization of low voltage \naerial bundled conductors; (v) load dispatch center for Kabul; (vi) improved \nbilling,  revenue  collection,  and  computerization;  and  (vii)  development  of \ngeographic  information,  asset  management,  and  customer  management \nsystems \n \n\n\fii\n\n \n\nCost Estimates \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n \n\nPeriod of \nUtilization  \n\nExecuting \nAgencies \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nProcurement \n\ntesting \n\nPart  C:  Gas  Infrastructure:  urgently  needed  repairs  and  rehabilitation  of \n(i)  12  gas  wells,  (ii)  gas  processing  plant,  (iii)  two  containerized  gas \nproduction \ntransmission  and \nlaboratories,  (iv)  corroded  gas \ndistribution  lines  including  city  gate  stations,  and  (v)  cathodic  protection \nsystem \n \nThe cost of the Project is estimated as $150 million equivalent. \n\n \nComponent \n \nPart A: Road Infrastructure \nPart B: Power Infrastructure \nPart C: Gas Infrastructure \nInterest During Grace Period  \nTotal: \n\nForeign \nExchange\n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n66.85 \n29.50 \n19.98 \n10.18 \n126.51 \n\n15.82 \n3.57 \n2.18 \n1.92 \n23.49 \n\n($ million)\n\nADB \nFinancing\n\n100%\n100%\n100%\n100%\n100%\n\nTotal \nCost \n\n82.67 \n33.07 \n22.16 \n12.10 \n150.0 \n\n \nA  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  One  Hundred  and  Ten  million \nand Eighteen Thousand Special Drawing Rights (SDR110,018,000) ($150 \nmillion  equivalent)  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources \nwith  a  term  of  40  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  10  years,  and  an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1% per annum. In addition, the total amount of \nthe interest charge during the grace period will be capitalized and charged \nto the loan account. \n \nUntil June 2013 \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA).  The \nimplementing agencies (IAs) are the Ministry of Public Works for the roads \ninfrastructure  component;  the  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power  for  the  power \ninfrastructure component; and the Ministry of Mines and Industries for the \ngas infrastructure component. \n \nA project coordination unit will be established within MOF to monitor project \nimplementation  and  coordinate  with  the  IAs.  MOF  will  appoint  a  project \ncoordinator  and  assign  appropriate  staff  to  assist  in  overseeing  project \nactivities.  Overall  a  project  steering  committee  (PSC),  chaired  by  the \ndeputy minister of finance, will provide guidance and approvals. The PSC \nwill consist of the ministers of IAs and will meet at least quarterly to review \nproject  implementation  and  to  resolve,  among  others,  interministerial \ncoordination issues. The project coordinator will also serve as the secretary \nto PSC. \n \nProcurement  of  goods,  services  and  civil  works  to  be  financed  under  the \nProject  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development \nBank\u2019s  (ADB)  Guidelines  for  Procurement,  with  flexible  interpretation, \nwherever  essential, as provided under emergency assistance projects. All \n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n\n30 June 2006 \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nConsulting \nServices \n\nProject Benefits  \nand Beneficiaries \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nthe \n\ninternational  procurements,  including  other  major  procurements,  will  be \nundertaken  by  the  Procurement  Unit  of  the  Afghanistan  Assistance \nCoordination  Authority,  under  MOF,  with  assistance  from  the  international \nprocurement  advisor.  Advance  actions  have  been  approved \nfor \nprocurement  of  consulting  services,  civil  work  contracts  under  the  road \ninfrastructure component, and turnkey contracts under the power and gas \ninfrastructure components. \n \n \nConsulting  services  (280  person-months  international  and  500  person-\nmonths  domestic)  will  be  required  to  assist  the  EA  and  IAs  in  project \nimplementation. All consultants financed under the project will be selected \nand  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  with \nflexibility,  wherever  essential,  provided  under \nemergency assistance projects. \n \nThe  road,  power,  and  gas  infrastructure  components  of  the  Project  will \nbenefit approximately 9 million people in seven provinces (Baghlan, Balkh, \nFaryab  Jowzjan  Kabul,  Parvan,  and  Samangan)  in  which  about  45%  are \nliving below $0.25 per capita income per day. The proportion below the $1 \nlevel  would  be  much  higher.  The  direct  and  indirect  impact  of  the  Project \nwill be pro-poor, since the poor will benefit through employment generation \nand  increased  household  income.  While  the  Project  will  generate  short-\nterm  employment  during \nthe  construction  period,  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  facilities  rehabilitated  under  the  Project  will  generate  \npermanent  employment.  Additional \nlong-term  employment  will  be \ngenerated  from  increased  production,  trade,  transport,  and  services \nattributable to  improved  roads,  power,  and  gas  supply.  There  will  be both \ndirect employment impact as well as impact through interindustry linkages.  \n \n(i)  The  overall  political  and  security  situation  remains  volatile.  ADB  will \ncontinue to closely monitor and coordinate with local and central authorities \nand  the  United  Nation  (UN)  agencies  to  ensure  adequate  protection.  (ii) \nUndue  delays  in  implementation  of  key  activities  are  possible  due  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s  weak  implementation  capacity.  Project  consultants  as  well \nas  consultants  working  under  the  ongoing  technical  assistance  cluster  for \ncapacity  building  will  assist  the  EA  and  IAs  in  implementation.  (iii) \nCounterpart resources may be inadequate. ADB will work closely with MOF \nand  IAs  to  ensure  adequate  allocation  of  resources.  (iv)  Roads  may \ndeteriorate  due  to  overloading  and  lack  of  maintenance.  ADB  will \nencourage the Government to make appropriate budgetary resources from \nthe  Postconflict  Multisector  Program  Loan \nfor  controlling  vehicle \noverloading and carrying out road maintenance. \n \n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan for the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation \nand Reconstruction Project.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nRehabilitation/Reconstruction \n\n2. \nMuch  of  the  infrastructure  in  Afghanistan  has  been  destroyed  or  damaged  by  two \ndecades  of  war.  Lack  of  resources  and  capacity  prevented  maintenance,  leading  to  major \ndeterioration  and  loss  of  infrastructure.  Revival  of  the  economy  depends  critically  on \nreconstruction and rehabilitation of key infrastructure including roads, electric power, and natural \ngas facilities. Such rehabilitation and reconstruction would also contribute towards employment \ncreation, income generation at the household level, rehabilitation of displaced populations and \nexcombatants,  improvement  of  security  and  stability,  interethnic  reconciliation,  and  political \nunification  of  the  country.  Given  the  strong  political  support  for  this  process,  and  pledges  for \nassistance  expressed  by  the  international  community,  it  is  critical  to  urgently  commence \nrehabilitation and reconstruction of vital infrastructure. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n3. \nDuring  December  2001,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme,  and  the  World  Bank  undertook  a  preliminary  needs  assessment \n(PNA), which outlined strategic choices for reconstruction and development, presented the aid \ncommunity with indicative funding requirements, and identified initial priorities supported by cost \nestimates. The PNA covered immediate needs, short-term options, and long-term development \ninitiatives. The PNA report was presented at the Ministerial Meeting of the Steering Committee \nheld  in  Tokyo  in  January  2002,  where  the  funding  agencies  pledged  assistance  of \napproximately  $4.5  billion.  The  meeting  also  endorsed  undertaking  of  comprehensive  needs \nassessments (CNAs) for each sector. Multi-agency missions were mobilized subsequently, and \ndetailed CNA reports2 were prepared based on field surveys and discussions with the relevant \nagencies of the Islamic Transitional Government of Afghanistan. The CNA reports provided the \ninitial database for the funding agencies to develop assistance programs in specific sectors.  \n \nNeed to Rehabilitate the Primary Road System. Afghanistan is a landlocked country.  \n4. \nWith  a  large  area  (of  about  652,000  square  kilometers)  and  a  population  of  26  million  widely \nspread  across  the  largely  mountainous  terrain,  roads  are  the  principal  means  of  transport  for \ninternal  and  international  traffic.  Aside  from  facilitating  urgent  humanitarian  aid  and  returning \nrefugees, roads are critical for economic revival and development. The road network comprises \nof about 6,000 kilometers (km) of national roads, of which 3,300 km are primary roads including \n2,400 km roads that were originally paved.  The national primary road network consists largely \nof the 2,227 km ring road (Kabul \u2013 Mazar Sharif \u2013 Sheberghan \u2013 Maymana \u2013 Herat \u2013 Kandahar \n\u2013 Kabul) and links to neighboring countries totaling about 800 km.3 The 615 km Sheberghan \u2013 \nMaymana \u2013 Herat section of the ring road is only partly constructed and is generally unpaved. \nThe  secondary  and  tertiary  roads  network  of  about  15,000  km  consists  of  either  gravel  or \n\n                                                 \n1   See Project Framework in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB took the lead in preparation of CNA reports for agriculture, environment, education, and transport in 2002 and \n\ncontributed to the CNA for the energy sector.  \n\n3  The international links are to Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.  \n\n\f 2\n\nearthen roads. These roads have not yet been systematically surveyed, though it appears that \nthey  are  generally  in  poor  condition.  The  recorded  traffic  during  the  preconflict  period  on  the \nprimary network varied between 250 and 1,000 vehicles per day. Recent traffic surveys indicate \nthat the traffic levels have grown fast and have significantly exceeded these figures. However, \nthe road conditions have further deteriorated due to lack of rehabilitation and maintenance. To \nkeep  up  with  increasing  traffic  volume,  promote  trade  links  with  neighboring  countries,  and \nimprove movement of goods and services, thereby fostering trade and commerce, it is essential \nthat the entire primary road network be rehabilitated on a priority basis.  This is also supported \nby the findings of CNA report for the transport sector.  \n \n5. \nThe Government has declared that reconstruction and rehabilitation of the road network, \nespecially  of  national  primary  roads,  is  the  country\u2019s  top  priority.  Improved  roads  will  not  only \nfacilitate the physical and political integration of Afghanistan but will also help unify international \nand  domestic  trade.  Rebuilding  the  road  network  is  also  critical  to  facilitate  humanitarian  and \ndevelopment  assistance.  The  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  works  will  utilize,  to  the  extent \npossible,  labor-intensive  construction  methods  to  provide  much-needed  employment  and \nincome generation opportunities. It will contribute to social stability by engaging, among others, \nrefugees  and  excombatants.  Production,  trade,  and  commerce  will  be  promoted,  thereby \nexpediting economic recovery and growth. A strengthened transport system will serve regional \ninterests,  with  the  possibility  of  reestablishing  Afghanistan  as  a  trade  hub,  bringing  enormous \nbenefits to the country. \n \n6. \nNeed  to  Rehabilitate  Power  Infrastructure.  The  power  infrastructure  of  Afghanistan \ncomprises  mainly  three  isolated  power  systems  centered  around  Kabul,  Kandahar  and  Mazar \nSharif  cities.  Of  an  estimated  230,000  electricity  consumers  in  the  country,  about  76,000  are \nlocated in Kabul and its surrounding districts. The entire electric power infrastructure (covering \ngeneration,  transmission,  distribution,  and  consumer  services)  is  in  very  poor  condition, \nresulting in high system losses, poor service, low reliability of supply, and daily load shedding. \nThe Government attaches highest priority to improving the power supply in Kabul.  \n \n7. \nThe Kabul power system is supplied mainly by four snow-fed hydroelectric plants with an \ninstalled capacity of nearly 200 megawatts (MW)4 but with a firm output of only about 65 MW in \nthe  2003  winter  season  due  to  the  low  availability  of  water  compounded  by  the  age  of  the \ngenerating plants. In addition, a diesel-fired gas turbine plant, recently rehabilitated with World \nBank  assistance,  produces  a  peaking  output  of  45  MW.  The  peak  load  demand  of  Kabul  city \nand its surrounding districts decreased from about 250 MW in 1996 to an estimated 160 MW in \nJanuary  2003,  since  only  about  40%  of  the  network  is  operational,  the  remainder  being \ndamaged.  The  proposal  for  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  the  Kabul  distribution  network, \ntogether with the ongoing interventions by the World Bank and Kreditanstait f\u1ee7r Wiederaufbau \n(KfW)  will  contribute  an  additional  100  MW  of  peak  load  demand  by  the  end  of  2005. \nConsequently, there is a need in the short term to augment the power supply to Kabul by about \n150 MW to meet the expected load demand of 260 MW. The least\u2013cost option is through import \nof power from neighboring Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan by rehabilitation and reconstruction of \nexisting transmission lines in the north.5  \n\n                                                 \n4   Darunta  (3x4  MW).  Mahipar  (3x22  MW),  Naghlu  (4x25  MW),  Sarobi  (2x11  MW).  However,  the  current  combined \nworking capacity is only about 160 MW. After rehabilitation of these four plants, provided by ongoing World Bank \nand European Union assistance, the combined generating output is expected to be restored up to about 200 MW, \nexcept during winter, when the low availability of water limits the combined firm output to about 80 MW. \n\n5   According to the Ministry of Water and Power, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan have recently signed a 10-year power \npurchase  agreement  for  the  import  of  150  MW  at  $0.02  per  kilowatt-hour  to  meet  the  short-term  power  supply \nshortfall in Kabul.  \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nTechnical losses are estimated to be about 25% (due to overloading of transmission and \n8. \ndistribution equipment and makeshift, substandard overhead conductor and underground cable \njoints),  while  nontechnical  losses  (mainly  due  to  pilferage  and  partly  due  to  lack  of  reliable \nmetering) are estimated to be as high as 20%. Besides contributing to the very high technical \nlosses,  exposed  cable  joints  pose  considerable  safety  risks  to  the  public,  especially  during \nwinter and rainy season, when the danger of electrocution for those walking accidentally into the \nvicinity  of  such  joints  is  greatly  increased.  Hence,  in  addition  to  an  urgent  need  to  rehabilitate \nand reconstruct the Kabul distribution system to reduce system losses and ensure best use of \nthe available power supply, there is also the need to minimize electrical hazards.  \n \n9. \nDa  Afghanistan  Brishna  Moassesa  (DABM),  constituted  under  a  special  act,  is \nresponsible  for  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  of  electricity  in  Afghanistan.  A \npresident who reports to the deputy minister of the Ministry of Water and Power (MWP) heads \nDABM, which has about 5,200 staff but lacks technical skills and access to modern technology \nincluding  computers  and  communication  equipment.  During  the  conflict  period,  maintenance \nand  repairs  could  not  be  undertaken  on  the  power  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution \nsystems. This was exacerbated by non-availability of spare parts, tools, and testing equipment. \nAccordingly,  staff  morale  and  productivity  is  low.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to  strengthen  the \ncapacity  of  DABM,  particularly  in  project  design  and  management,  asset  management,  load \ndispatching, accounting, billing, revenue collection, and operation and maintenance (O&M). \n \n10. \nNeed to Rehabilitate Gas Infrastructure. Gas is produce at Sheberghan and is utilized \nlargely in Mazar Sharif. Eight gas fields were discovered in the northern part of the country, of \nwhich three were developed, and gas production first commenced in 1967. In the earlier years, \nmost of the country\u2019s gas production was exported to the Former Soviet Union based on an 18-\nyear  agreement.  The  export  of  gas  ended  in  1987  with  the  end  of  Soviet  domination  in \nAfghanistan, whereafter the export agreement was not renewed. The gas availability is grossly \ninadequate to meet the current requirements mainly due to loss of production facilities and high \nrate  of  leakage.  Gas  leakage  represents  not  only  a  loss  of  revenue  but  also  a  major  safety \nhazard.  The  immediate  problems  facing  the  gas  subsector  in  Afghanistan  relate  to  (i)  lack  of \nequipment,  spare  parts,  and  material  to  maintain  the  integrity  of  operations;  (ii)  inadequate \nresources  for  repair  and  rehabilitation  of  production  wells,  gas  processing  plant,  and \ntransmission  and  distribution  pipelines;  (iii)  lack  of  expertise  in  geological  and  geophysical \nassessment  of  gas  fields,  including  gas  field  management  and  reservoir  depletion;  and  (iv) \nabsence  of  corrosion  prevention  and  cathodic  protection  of  gathering  mains  and  the \ntransmission and distribution network. The quality of gas from some of the producing wells is not \nsuitable  for  fertilizer  production  due  to  high  hydrogen  sulfide  content  in  particular  zones,  and \nneeds to be purified prior to transmission. The gas processing plant installed by the Russians \nfor  removal  of  hydrogen  sulfide  is  not  operating.  The  current  gas  production  is  about  830,000 \ncubic meters per day, of which 250,000 cubic meters per day leaks to the atmosphere. Present \ngas  production  is  less  than  one  fourth  of  the  level  produced  in  the  early  1980s.  For  domestic \nconsumption of gas, transmission pipelines were built from Sheberghan to Mazar Sharif, located \nat a distance of about 135 km. The consumers in the two cities and smaller towns and villages \nin  the  vicinity  of  the  transmission  lines  are  connected  through  distribution  lines.  The  present \nnetwork  serves  (i)  a  fertilizer  factory  including  a  48  MW  gas\u2013fired  thermal  power  plant  at  the \nfactory site; (ii) the commercial sector such as bakeries, a textile factory, food processing plant, \netc.; and (iii) domestic consumers for heating and cooking. Gas supply to domestic consumers \nis not metered, and tariff collection rate is very low. \n \n11. \nThere is need to optimize the use of indigenous natural gas and reduce dependence on \npetroleum  fuel.  The  increased  supply  of  natural  gas  will  also  help  curtail  the  demand  for  fuel \n\n\f 4\n\nwood,  thereby  reducing  deforestation.  At  present,  fuel  wood  accounts  for  about  75%  of  total \nenergy supplies, and constitutes the basic source of energy for cooking and heating for the bulk \nof  the  population  residing  in  rural  areas.  Rehabilitation  and  development  of  the  existing  gas \ninfrastructure  will  mitigate  environmental  and  safety  hazards,  reduce ecological  problems,  and \npromote efficiency of natural gas use. Accordingly, the Government has given a high priority to \nthe  rehabilitation  and  development  of  natural  gas  as  a  significant  source  of  energy  in  the \ncountry. \n \nC. \n\nSocial Dimension and Impact on Poverty \n\n12. \nSecurity and stability are critical for the recovery and development of Afghanistan. The \nGovernment is making efforts to establish the rule of law, bring provincial and local authorities \nunder central control, build a national army and police force, and extend the tenure and expand \nthe role of international security forces. Improved security and stability are necessary for further \nprogress in infrastructure rehabilitation and reconstruction. \n \nPoverty is endemic in Afghanistan. A large proportion of the population lived below any \n13. \nacceptable poverty line even prior to the civil conflict. The conflict has left them poorer, and new \ngroups have joined the ranks of the poor. These include small and marginal farmers, especially \nin  the  rain\u2013fed,  arid,  and  semiarid  regions  with  irrigation  systems  in  disrepair  and  many  fields \nstill  inaccessible  due  to  mine  infestation;  landless  workers  in  the  agriculture  sector;  wage \nearners; nomadic populations whose herds have been decimated; returning refugees; internally \ndisplaced populations; ex-combatants; the disabled; as well as settled population groups in rural \nareas  facing  food  needs  as  defined  by  the  World  Food  Program  (WFP).6  According  to  a \npreliminary  estimate  undertaken  by  ADB,  about  53%  of  the  population  live  below  the  poverty \nline of $90 per capita per annum in 2002 prices, which is sufficient to meet the minimum energy \nrequirement7 and an additional 30% allowance for nonfood items (see Supplementary Appendix \nA).  The  challenges  of  poverty  reduction  and  reintegration  of  the  displaced  population  are \nmultifaceted, and a strong foundation is needed for all\u2013round economic growth. \n \nD. \n\nExternal Assistance and Aid Coordination \n\nThe  pledges  made  by  the  aid  agencies  at  the  first  conference  on  recovery  and \n14. \nreconstruction of Afghanistan, held in Tokyo in January 2002, took some time to be realized into \nspecific  assistance  projects.  While  there  is  significant  assistance  in  the  road  sector  by \nmultilaterals  (ADB,  World  Bank,  and  European  Commission)  and  bilaterals  (United  States, \nJapan,  Saudi  Arabia,  Italy,  Sweden,  Iran,  and  Pakistan),  only  a  few  agencies  (Germany, \nEuropean  Commission,  World  Bank,  and  ADB)  are  providing  assistance  in  the  power  sector. \nWith the exception of ADB, there is no external support for the gas sector. See Appendix 2 for \ndetails.  \n \n15.  Within the Government, the Afghan Assistance Coordination Authority (AACA) continues \nto  play  a  strong  role  in  coordinating  external  assistance  in  Afghanistan.  The  Government  has \ntaken  three  initiatives  to  improve  aid  coordination.  First,  the  funding  agencies  have  been \nrequested  to  focus  on  specific  (three)  sectors.  Second,  the  Government  has  established  local \nlevel aid agency\u2013government consultative groups covering 12 national development programs \n\n                                                 \n6   The WFP food needs assessment is based on a minimum per capita daily requirement of 2100 kcal. \n7    WFP. 2002.

Therefore the \npercentage of population living below $1 per day per capita would be much higher, maybe as much as 60-80%. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n(NDPs)8  and  four  crosscutting  advisory  groups  for  gender,  environment,  humanitarian  affairs, \nand  human  rights,  with  one  designated  external  agency  acting  as  the  focal  point.  Third,  the \nfunding  agency\u2013government  forum  will  be  moving  from  the  implementation  group  (IG) \nframework  to  a  government-led  consultative  group  (CG)  process.  ADB  is  the  focal  point  for \ntransport, natural resource management and environment. ADB is also a member of two other \nCGs covering energy, mining, and telecommunication; and public administration and economic \nmanagement.  ADB  staff  are  actively  engaged  in  the  proceedings  of  the  CGs,  and  the \ncomponents for the proposed Project were developed in close consultation with other external \nagencies at the CG meetings.   \n \nE. \n\nAfghanistan\u2019s National Development Framework and Budget \n\nThe goal of the Government\u2019s National Development Framework (NDF) is to provide a \n16. \nstrategic plan for the development of Afghanistan, around which all actors can unite, to address \npoverty and provide economic opportunity through a series of concrete programs and projects. \nThe NDF is based on five principles: (i) the development strategy must be domestically owned, \nwith the Government in the driver\u2019s seat; (ii) markets and the private sector are more effective \ninstruments than the state in delivering sustained growth; (iii) aid cannot be effective without the \nstate  investing  in  human  capital  and  the  creation  of  an  institutional  framework  that  allows  the \nrule of law to prevail; (iv) promotion of sustainable economic growth requires active participation \nof the population; and (v) externally funded investments must be anchored in the Government\u2019s \ndevelopment program to be successful over the longer term. The NDF focuses on three pillars \nof development: (i) security and human development, (ii) rebuilding physical infrastructure, and \n(iii) enabling the creation of a viable private sector as the engine for sustainable and inclusive \neconomic  growth.  Restoring  security  and  reestablishing  law  and  order,  administrative  and \nfinancial reforms, and gender development are crosscutting priorities. The key challenges and \npriorities  in  the  short  term  are  to  quickly  establish  basic  security  for  the  population,  revitalize \nagriculture,  facilitate  private  economic  activity,  and  rebuild  infrastructure  and  social  services. \nThe national development budget (NDB) translates the priorities of the NDF into programs and \nprojects while simultaneously providing a vehicle for policy development. It provide an outline of \nongoing  and  proposed investments  within  the NDF.  The  development  budget  for  FY2004  was \ndeveloped through the CG process and was presented at the Afghanistan Development Forum \nmeeting held in Kabul in March 2003. \n \nF. \n \nThe objective of the Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for Afghanistan (2002-2004) \n17. \nwas to assist the Government in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the country to ensure a \nseamless transition from humanitarian to reconstruction and development assistance. The CSP \nwas  endorsed  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  in  May  2002,  paving  the  way  for  delivery  of \nassistance  earmarked  for  2002.  Since  then  ADB  has  approved  the  $150  million  Postconflict \nMultisector  Program  Loan  (PMPL)9  and  grant\u2013financed  technical  assistance  (TA)  and  other \nnonlending operations  totaling  $37 million  including  a  $14.5  million capacity\u2013building  technical \n\nADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update \n\n                                                 \n8   (i)  Refugee  Return;  (ii)  Education;  (iii)  Health  and  Nutrition;  (iv)  Livelihood  and  Social  Protection;  (v)  Culture, \nHeritage,  Media,  and  Sports;  (vi)  Transport  and  Telecommunications;  (vii)  Urban  Management;  (viii)  Energy  and \nMining; (ix) Natural Resource Management; (x) Trade and Private Investment; (xi) Public Administration; and (xii) \nSecurity and Rule of Law. \n\n9   ADB.  2002.

Manila. \n\n\f 6\n\nLessons Learned \n\nassistance  cluster  (TAC),10  The  program  loan  and  TA  will  have  indirect  but  broad\u2013based \npositive impact for the country\u2019s reconstruction.  \n \n18. \nAn  update  of  the  CSP  covering  2003  \u2013  2005  program  has  been  circulated  for  Board \nconsideration.  The  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (CSPU)  follows  the  overriding \nobjective  of  the  CSP,  and  focuses  on  agriculture,  transport,  and  energy  sector  based  upon  a \nnumber  of  considerations,  including  (i)  the  12  NDPs  and  six  national  priority  subprograms \nidentified  by  the  NDB,  (ii)  the  government\u2019s  expressed  wish  to  limit  each  aid  agency  to  three \nsectors,  (iii)  ADB\u2019s  comparative  advantage,  and  (iv)  ADB  and  other  funding  agencies\u2019 \noperational experience in Afghanistan. \n \nG. \n \n19. \nA  number  of  lessons  can  be  drawn  from  past  emergency  assistance  projects,  best \npractices, and initial lending and nonlending operations of ADB in Afghanistan in 2002. First, the \nstrategic focus of ADB operations has to be closely linked to the Government\u2019s own strategies \nand  priorities.  Second,  continued  emphasis  has  to  be  given  on  capacity  building  to  improve \nplanning,  project  design  and  implementation,  administration,  and  financial  management.  The \nMinistry  of  Finance  (MOF)  has  successfully  launched  both  the  ordinary  and  the  development \nbudget.  Systems  are  being  put  in  place  for  fiscal  accounting  and  transparency.  Third,  to  the \nextent feasible, external funds should be channeled through the budget so that resources made \navailable  by  the  international  community  can  be  appropriately  accounted  for.  Fourth,  aid \ncoordination  through  AACA/CGs  is  extremely  important  for  avoiding  duplication  and  delays. \nFifth,  aid  groups  must  work  closely  with  MOF  and  the  central  bank  to  develop  a  viable  and \nworking payment system, without which funds flow has remained a difficult undertaking. Sixth, \ncapacity building of executing agencies is vital, and consulting services for project design and \nimplementation should have provision for training the EA staff in O&M of rehabilitated facilities. \nSeventh,  the  number  of  procurement  packages  should  be  minimized,  keeping  in  view  the \nimplementation  capacity  of  the  EAs.  Eighth,  ADB\u2019s  procurement  guidelines  should  be  flexibly \napplied  for  emergency  assistance  projects  to  allow  reduced  procurement  periods  for  urgent \ndelivery  of  project  activities.  These  lessons  have  been  carefully  built  into  the  design  of  the \nProject. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\nThe main objective of the Project is to help the Government rehabilitate and reconstruct \n20. \nkey infrastructure in the transport and energy sectors that was damaged during two decades of \nconflict and neglect.  It is anchored in the second pillar of the NDF. The proposed Project is in \nline with ADB\u2019s assistance strategy outlined in the ICSPU, which focuses, among others, on the \nnational  road  network  and  international  link  roads,  power,  and  gas  development.  While  the \nProject involves rehabilitation of key infrastructure, the related policy and institutional reforms in  \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance Cluster to the Republic of Afghanistan for Capacity Building for Reconstruction \n\nand Development. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nthe transport and energy sectors are reflected in the ongoing PMPL.11  \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Output \n\nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  damaged  facilities  through  the  provision  of  civil  works; \n21. \nequipment/material;  and  consulting  services  for  design,  supervision  of  implementation,  and \nevaluation. The Project will have three parts as described in the following paragraphs. \n \nPart A: Road Infrastructure. This component will comprise urgently needed repair and \n22. \nrehabilitation  to  the  Pule  Khumri  \u2013  Mazar  Sharif  \u2013  Sheberghan  \u2013  Andkhoy  section  of  the  ring \nroad, including the link to Uzbekistan (Naibabad \u2013 Hairatan road).12 The road section generally \nmeets  the  standards13  established  by  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (MPW)  for  core  roads  in \nAfghanistan.    However,  shoulder  widening  and  geometric  improvements  may  be  needed. \nRehabilitation of bridges and cross\u2013drainage structures will vary from minor repairs to restoring \ndamaged  sections.    The  roadside  drainage  needs  to  be  improved.  The  164  km  road  section \nfrom  Pule  Khumri  to  Naibabad  (junction  of  road  turning  to  Hairatan,  border  with  Uzbekistan) \nrequires pothole patching, crack sealing, shoulder restoration, and bituminous seal.  The 25 km \nNaibabad \u2013 Mazare Sharif section, the 132 km Mazare Sharif \u2013 Sheberghan road section, and \nthe  48  km  section  of  the  Sheberghan  \u2013  Andkhoy  road  (72  km)  is  largely  deteriorated  and \nrequires  major  pavement  strengthening.  The  24  km  remaining  section  of  Sheberghan  \u2013 \nAndkhoy  road  requires  embankment  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  asphalt  pavement.  The \n55 km Naibabad \u2013 Hairatan road section is continuously blocked due to shifting sand dunes that \nmakes  it  impassable,  requiring  construction  of  barriers  along  the  road  in  affected  areas. \nConsulting services will be provided for design review, supervision of civil works contracts, and \nenhancing MPW O&M capacity. See Appendix 3 for details.  \n \n23. \nPart  B:  Power  Infrastructure.  This  component  will  comprise  (i)  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction  of  damaged  transmission  lines  and  substations  in  the  northern  provinces  to \nenable  increased  power  imports;  (ii)  urgently  needed  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  the \nKabul  distribution  system,  which  was  damaged  during  the  conflict  period;  and  (iii)  consulting \nservices \ntraining.  The \nrehabilitation and reconstruction of the Kabul distribution system will complement and integrate \nthe  efforts  provided  by  the  World  Bank,  KfW,  and  the  European  Commission  to  bring  about  a \ntotal  improvement  in  electric  power  supply  to  Kabul  city  and  surrounding  districts,  which  will \nreduce system losses, improve security, and provide reliability and quality of electricity supply to \nusers. Electrical hazards, specifically those attributed to exposed cable joints, will be minimized. \nThis  component  will  cover  (i)  rehabilitation  of  230  circuit\u2013kilometers  (cct\u2013km)  of  220  kilovolts \n(kV) and 50 cct\u2013km of 110 kV transmission lines; (ii) reconstruction of Khulum and Pule Khumri \n220/110  kV  substations,  (iii)  rehabilitation  of  distribution  substations,  junctions,  transformers, \n\nfor  project  management  and  on-the-job  management  support \n\n                                                 \n11  The  policy  objectives  in  the  transport  sector  include  (i)  creating  an  enabling  framework  for  market\u2013based \ncompetition  and  efficiency,  (ii)  establishing  safe  and  reliable  transport  services,  (iii)  improving  institutional \nefficiency,  (iv)  establishing  a  regulatory  framework,  (v)  improving  transparency  and  accountability,  (vi)  instituting \nmechanism  for  cost  recovery,  (vii)  encouraging  private  sector  participation,  and  (viii)  establishing  a  system  for \nnational  road  improvement  and  maintenance.  The  policy  objectives  in  the  energy  sector  include  (i)  creating  an \nefficient, safe, and reliable energy system; (ii) separating policy\u2013making and regulatory functions from operational \nfunctions;  (iii)  capacity  building  of  public  utilities  to  improve  generation/production,  transmission,  and  distribution; \n(iv) improving cost recovery; (v) encouraging private sector investment; and (vi) improving corporate governance.   \n12  The  United  States,  Japan,  Saudi  Arabia,  Iran,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  European  Commission  are  providing \nassistance for rehabilitation of other sections of the ring road and international links. ADB is providing assistance \nthrough  a  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  financed  project  that  includes,  among  others,  rehabilitation  of  the \nKandahar \u2013 Spin Boldak road in the south.  \n\n13  These  standards  are  consistent  with  international  standards  and  are  followed  by  all  funding  agencies  assisting \n\nAfghanistan in road rehabilitation.  \n\n\f 8\n\nequipment,  cables,  and  material;  (iv)  electricity  service  delivery  including  installation  of  30,000 \nmeters  and  utilization  of  low\u2013voltage  aerial  bundled  conductors,  which  are  insulated  to  deter \nillegal  connections;  (v)  load  dispatch  center  for  Kabul;  (vi)  billing,  revenue  collection,  and \ncomputerization;  and  (vii)  geographic \ninformation,  asset  management,  and  customer \nmanagement systems.

See \nAppendix 5 for details. \n \nC. \n \n25. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $150  million  equivalent,  comprising \napproximately  $126.51  million  in  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $23.49  million  equivalent  in  local \ncurrency cost. The cost estimates are given in Table 1. A summarized cost table is included as \nAppendix 6, and detailed breakdowns are available in sector appendixes 3\u20135. \n\n(ix)  consulting  services \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\n \nItem \nPart A: Road Infrastructure \n\nPart B: Power Infrastructure \n  \nPart C: Gas Infrastructure \n \nPhysical and Price Contingencies \n \nInterest During Grace Period \n \n             Total \nPercentage \n\nForeign \nExchange \n60.64 \n \n26.76 \n \n18.12 \n\n10.81 \n\n10.18 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n14.35 \n\n3.24 \n \n1.98 \n\n2.00 \n\n1.92 \n\nTotal \nCost \n74.99 \n\n30.00 \n\n20.10 \n\n12.81 \n\n12.10 \n\n126.51 \n             84 \n\n23.49 \n    16 \n\n150.00 \n     100 \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nD. \n \n26. \nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $150 million equivalent from its Special Fund \nresources,  representing  100%  of  the  total cost of  the  Project.    The  loan  will  finance  the  entire \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nforeign exchange and local currency costs of civil works, equipment, material, and services. The \nloan proceeds will not be used for costs of land, right-of-way, taxes, or duties.14 \n \n27. \nThe loan will have a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, an interest \ncharge at the rate of 1% per annum, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. In addition, \nthe total amount of the interest charge during the grace period will be capitalized and charged to \nthe loan account. \n \n28. \nThe Swedish International Development Agency (Sida) has expressed strong interest in \ncofinancing  consulting  services  for  the  road  infrastructure  component.  This  will  be  firmed  up \nduring implementation.     \n \nE. \n \n29. \nIn  view  of  the  extraordinary  postconflict  situation  in  Afghanistan,  the  prevailing  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF)  lending  terms  approved  by  the  Board  are  not  appropriate  for \nsustainable development in that country. It is therefore proposed that the loan be made on the \nconcessional terms identical to those provided for the PMPL. These are (i) grandfathering pre-\n1999  ADF  lending  terms  so  that  the  loan  has  40\u2013year  maturity  including  a  10\u2013year  grace \nperiod, with 1% interest charge throughout its term, and (ii) capitalizing interest during the grace \nperiod. The justification for the proposed loan terms is the same as for the PMPL and includes \nthe following: \n \n\nSpecial Loan Terms \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nAfghanistan is just beginning to emerge from a long period of economic decline \nand  stagnation  and  needs  highly  concessional  resources  now  to  develop  its \npromising  endowments  (such  as  agriculture,  gas,  and  mineral  production)  while \nits debt situation is carefully managed. It is therefore important that Afghanistan\u2019s \nincome\u2013generating  capacity  is  developed  without  further  straining  its  debt\u2013\nrepayment situation. \n\nFurther  analysis  of  debt  sustainability  by  ADB  and  the  International  Monetary \nFund  concludes  that  borrowings  of  Afghanistan  should  be  on  a  highly \nconcessional  terms  for  key  projects  and  structural  reforms  for  which  grant \nfinancing cannot be found.  \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management and Coordination \n\n30.  MOF will be the executing agency (EA) for the Project. Implementation of the Project will \nbe managed by the relevant line ministries.  As such, MPW will be the implementing agency (IA) \nfor road infrastructure, MMI for gas infrastructure, and MWP will be the implementing agency for \nthe power infrastructure.   \n \n31. \nA  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  will  be  established  within  MOF  to  monitor  project \nimplementation  and  coordinate  with  the  aforementioned  IAs.    MOF  will  appoint  a  project \ncoordinator and assign appropriate staff to assist in overseeing and monitoring project activities \nand milestones. A project steering committee (PSC), chaired by the deputy minister of finance, \nwill  be  established \nfor  smooth \n                                                 \n14    The Government will allow duty\u2013free import of equipment and material under Project\u2013financed contracts. \n\nto  provide  overall  guidance  and  approvals  required \n\n \n\n \nF. \n \n\n\f 10\n\nimplementation of the Project. The PSC will consist of the ministers of the IAs and will meet at \nleast  quarterly  to  review  project  implementation  and  to  resolve,  among  others,  interministerial \ncoordination issues. The project coordinator will also serve as the secretary to the PSC. \n \nEach  IA  will  appoint  a  project  director  supported  by  adequate  staff,  who  will  liaise  with \n32. \nthe  project  coordinator  for  implementation  of  the  respective  components.    See  Appendix  7  for \nimplementation  arrangements.  The  consultants  engaged  under  the  Project  and  the  TAC  for \ncapacity building (footnote 10) will develop capacity and assist IAs in implementation.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n33. \nAs  the  Project  is  for  emergency  assistance,  it  will  be  implemented  over  36  months \nstarting from the date of loan effectiveness. A detailed implementation schedule is attached as \nAppendix 8.  \n \n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n34. \nConsulting  services  will  be  required  to  assist  the  EA  and  IAs  in  implementation  of  the \nProject. The consulting services will involve  Project management, detailed design, preparation \nof  bid  documents,  assistance  in  procurement,  supervision  of  construction  and  installation  of \nequipment,  testing  and  certifying  completed  works,  training  in  management  and  O&M,  and \nbenefit  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  consultants  will  also  assist  the  IAs  in  preparing  initial \nenvironment  examinations  (IEEs)  and  environment  management  plans  including  disposal  of \nhazardous wastes where applicable. In addition, the consultants will assist in developing social \nscreening and mitigation plans as needed, and in monitoring poverty.  \n \n35. \nAll consultants financed under the Project will be selected and engaged in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  for  recruitment  of \ndomestic  consultants  acceptable  to  ADB.  However,  where  required  and  justified,  direct \nselection, negotiation, and hire procedures as allowed under emergency situations will be used. \nThe  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  under  each  component  are  provided  in \nAppendixes 3\u20135.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n36. \nProcurement of goods, services, and civil works to be financed under the Project will be \ncarried out in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, with provision for flexible \napplication of such guidelines for emergency assistance projects.15 This involves, among others, \nshorter  bidding  period  for  international  procurement  if  required.  All international  procurements, \nincluding  other  major  procurements,  will  be  undertaken  by  the  AACA  Procurement  Unit  with \nassistance from the international procurement advisor. The IAs will execute and administer the \ncontracts as employer.  \n \n37. \nAll  contracts  for  civil  works  and  supply  of  equipment  and  materials  will  be  divided  into \nsuitable contract packages. The contracts have been mostly packaged as turnkey and design-\nbuild  to  ensure  delivery  within  the  project  implementation  period.  The  civil  works  contracts \nexceeding  $1  million  will  be  awarded  following  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  \nThe  contracts  for  equipment  and  materials  valued  at  $500,000  and  below  should  be  procured \nusing  international  shopping  procedures.  For  equipment  and  material  contracts  exceeding \n\n                                                 \n15  As provided under Operations Manual Section 25: Rehabilitation Assistance After Disasters. \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n$500,000,  international  competitive  bidding  procedures  will  be  followed.  Appendix  9  gives \nindicative contract packages.   \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n38. \nLoan funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nImprest  accounts,  primarily  for  incremental  expenditures  relating  to  administrative  support  for \nthe IAs and the PCU, will be established with the PCU in the Ministry of Finance, in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The initial amount to be deposited into the imprest \naccount  will  be  a  6-month  estimated  expenditure  that  will  be  replenished  on  submission  of \nstatements of expenditures. \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Action  \n\n39. \nIn  view  of  the  short  implementation  time  frame,  there  is  an  urgency  to  commence \nprocurement. Accordingly, ADB Management has approved advance actions for procurement of \nconsulting  services,  civil  works,  equipment,  and  material.  Such  advance  action  incorporates \ngeneral  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement  requirements  and  procedures.  Approval  of \nadvance action will not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n40. \nOverall  project  monitoring  will  be  conducted  by  the  PCU.    In  consultation  with  the  IAs, \nthe  PCU  will  establish  a  system  for  preparing  quarterly  reports  for  performance  monitoring, \nissues  resolution,  and  periodic  actions  plans.  These  action  plans,  developed  by  the  IAs,  will \nincorporate  quantitative  and  time-bound  implementation  targets  and  will  be  reviewed  and \napproved by the PSC. The quarterly reports will serve as management feedback to update and \nimprove  procedures  and  project  implementation.  The  PCU  will  ensure  submission  of  the \nquarterly reports to ADB. Within 3 months of project completion, the PCU will prepare, with the \nassistance  of  the  IAs,  a  comprehensive  project  completion  report  on  the  overall  impact  of  the \nProject.     \n \nThe Government will maintain separate accounts and records for the Project, including \n41. \nall  components,  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  MOF  will  ensure  that  proper \naudit and accounting procedures are in place by the IAs to ensure efficient and economical use \nof  the  loan  proceeds  for  the  beneficiaries.  Separate  accounts  and  financial  statements  in \nrelation  to  the  Project  adequate  to  identify  the  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan \nproceeds,  financing  resources,  expenditures  incurred,  and  the  use  of  local  funds  will  be \nmaintained.  Such  accounts  and  financial  statements  will  be  maintained  in  accordance  with \nsound  accounting  principles  and  certified  by  independent  private  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB. \nThe  audited  reports  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  no  later  than  9 \nmonths after the end of the fiscal year. The annual audits will also include audit of the imprest \naccount  and  statement  of  expenditure  records,  and  a  separate  opinion  on  such  audit  will  be \nincluded in the audit report. The Government will facilitate ADB representatives to carry out spot \nand  random  checks  on  flow  of  funds  and  their  use  for  the  Project,  work  in  progress  and \nimplementation. \n \n8. \n\nCapacity Building and Institutional Strengthening \n\n42. \nCapacity  building  of  the  government  agencies/ministries  and  utility  companies  is \nessential for O&M of the rehabilitated infrastructure and facilities and to achieve the economic \n\n\f 12\n\nand  financial  benefits.  To  this  end,  in  the  road  sector,  consultants  engaged  under  the  TAC16 \n(see  footnote  10)  are  providing  training  to  MPW  and  Ministry  of  Transport  staff  in  project \nplanning,  design,  procurement,  financial  management,  and  maintenance.  In  the  power  sector, \nconsultants17 have been working closely with MWP and DABM counterparts to strengthen their \ncapacity  in  project  planning,  design,  asset  management,  load  dispatching,  accounting,  billing, \nrevenue collection, and O&M. In addition, under the Project, DABM will receive suitable training \nas well as tools, equipment, and spare parts to effectively operate and maintain the integrated \nnorthern  power  system  and  the  Kabul  distribution  power  system.  Further  capacity  building  of \nMWP is also planned in 2004.18 For the gas sector, the Project will provide operational training \nto  MMI  and  Afghan  Gas  staff.  Moreover,  a  separate  TA  in  200319  will  provide  institutional \nstrengthening in the sector. \n \n\n9. \n\nOperation and Maintenance \n\n43. \nAll infrastructure rehabilitated and reconstructed under the Project will be operated and \nmaintained by the relevant ministry/IA during and after completion of the works. Related O&M \ntraining of the IA staff will be part of the contracts for supervisory consultants and contractors for \ncivil works, and supply and installation of equipment. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n44. \nThe  PCU  will  undertake  quantitative  and  qualitative  performance  monitoring  for  each \nproject  component  to  evaluate  the  delivery  of  the  planned  facilities  and  the  project  benefits \naccrued.  Within  6  months  after  the  effective  date  of  the  Loan  Agreement,  the  PCU,  with  the \nassistance  of  the  Project  Implementation  Unit  (PIUs)  and  Project\u2013financed  consultants,  will \ndevelop  a  comprehensive  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  in  accordance  with \nthe ADB\u2019s standards. ADB will review and approve the PPMS. The PIUs will assist in carrying \nout the PPMS activities. ADB and the Government will agree on the performance parameters to \nbe monitored during the implementation of the Project.       \n \nG. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures \n\nThe Project will have significant positive impact on, and will result in improvement of, the \n45. \nenvironment.  All  project  components  will  be  designed  to  follow  environmental  safeguards  and \ntechnical  specifications  established  for  ongoing  ADB-financed  projects,  which  have  already \nbeen  subjected  to  ADB\u2019s  initial  environmental  examination  procedures.    The  Project  will  be \nprepared  to  follow  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected \nInfrastructure,  Industrial,  and  Power  Development  Projects  and  to  comply  with  the  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy.  The  responsible  IAs  will  submit  a  waste  management  plan  for  the  gas \ninfrastructure  component.  An  environmental  monitoring  system  will  be  built  into  each  project \ncomponent  including  training  for  IAs  to  strengthen  their  capacity  to  deal  with  environmental \nproblems, particularly hazardous wastes.   \n \n46. \nCommunity  consultations  were  undertaken  as  part  of  the  design  of  the  Project. \nMechanisms  for  maximizing  local  employment  benefits,  particularly  for  the  destitute,  landless \n                                                 \n16  Component 3a: Capacity Building for Key Infrastructure Agencies Including Support for Feasibility Studies for Road \nReconstruction  Projects;  and  Component  3b:  Capacity  Building  for  Project  Planning  in  the  Transport  Sector,  for \n$2.46 million and $0.84 million, respectively, approved on 30 July 2002.  \n\n17  Component  3c:  Capacity  Building  and  Training  of  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power;  for  $0.7  million,  approved  on  18 \n\nJune 2002. \n\n18  Proposed TA for Institutional Strengthening of MWP, for $0.75 million in 2004.   \n19  Proposed TA for institutional Strengthening of Gas sector, for $0.75 million in 2003. \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nlaborers,  internal  displaced  people,  and  ex-combatants  will  be  included  in  the  bidding \ndocuments.    This  will  include  road  embankment  rehabilitation  under  the  road  infrastructure \ncomponent,  which  will  maximize  the  use  of  local  labor.  ADB  and  the  Government  will  ensure \nthat  a  specific  plan  for  local  consultation  to  address  safety,  social,  and  cultural  matters  during \nproject construction will be included in the bidding document. The Government will work closely \nwith  the  local  community  leaders  in  the  Project  area  to  ensure  that  both  men  and  women  are \ngiven equal employment opportunities to benefit from the Project. Contractors will be required to \nensure equal payment for equal work.  \n \n47. \nRehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  road,  gas  and  electricity  transmission  and \ndistribution facilities will occur on existing rights-of-way. Therefore, the Project will not entail land \nacquisition  and  resettlement.    The  rehabilitation  works  are  designed,  using  engineering \nsolutions, to ensure that reconstruction and rehabilitation will be within existing rights-of-way. No \nnew roads, gas pipelines, or electricity transmission and distribution lines will be constructed. \n \n48. \nHowever, several possible minor shoulder adjustments and movement of movable stalls \nand sheds may be necessary at certain locations. Urgency and the uncertain security situation \nrequire flexibility in applying social and related safeguard policies. At the same time, in order to \nundertake  due  diligence,  avoid  negative  impacts,  and  ensure  consistent  treatment  of  social \nissues,  a  social  assessment  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  social  screening \nframework (Appendix 10). Its purpose will be to assist IAs in screening project components for \nlikely  social  impacts,  identifying  documentation,  ascertaining  requirements,  and  preparing \nnecessary  mitigation  plans  for  project  components  triggering  safeguard  policies.  Social \nassessment  will  include  a  focus  on gender  impacts.  Consultation  and disclosure  requirements \nwill be simplified in consideration of the uncertain security situation in the country. The EA will \nsubmit a social assessment report to ADB for review and approval.20 Based on field visits and \npublic  consultations  in  the  project  area  for  each  component,  the  Project  will  have  no  negative \nimpact on indigenous people or ethnic minorities.   \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nImpact on Poverty and Other Benefits \n\n49. \nThe Project will contribute to economic recovery, diversification of activities, employment \ngeneration,  higher  productivity,  improved  per  capita  income,  increased  revenue  generation, \nimproved  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  public  sector,  private  sector  development, \nenvironmental  preservation,  and  social  stability.  Specific  beneficiaries  will  include,  among \nothers, the rural and urban poor, displaced populations, demobilized combatants, and women. \nSpecifically, the benefits will be directly or indirectly attributable to different project components. \n \nRoad transport development will (i) improve the national road network; (ii) facilitate the \n50. \nmovement  of  humanitarian  aid  through  the  northern  corridor;  (iii)  reduce  the  cost  of \ntransportation;  (iv)  promote  international  and  regional  trade;  (v)  increase  the  income  of  the \nvulnerable  groups  in  rural  and  urban  areas;  (vi)  build  up  the  capacity  of  local  contractors  for \nconstruction,  rehabilitation,  and  maintenance  of  major  roads  and  bridges;  and  (vii)  promote \nenvironmental preservation. Road rehabilitation and reconstruction will open up a wide range of \nopportunities  for  the  private  sector  involved  in  road  construction,  production,  trade,  transport, \nand  services.  Rehabilitated  roads  will  improve  the  supply  of  and  access  to  health,  education, \nand other social services. The road component will assist some of the most vulnerable groups in \nthe country in their repatriation, resettlement, and reintegration within their communities; provide \n                                                 \n20  The consultants under the TAC (footnote 10) will assist the EA/IAs in preparing the social assessment report. \n\n\f 14\n\nlivelihood;  and  develop  capacity  and  skills  that provide  sustainability.  Women's  welfare  will  be \npromoted  through  improved  availability  and  access  to  social  services  including  education  and \nhealth. Private sector development will open up opportunities for women entrepreneurs. \n \nEnergy  development  will  (i)  improve  gas  and  electricity  supply  in  terms  of  quantity, \n51. \nquality,  reliability,  safety  and  environmental  impact;  (ii)  improve  household  quality  of  life;  (iii) \nrevive industries and establish new ones; (iv) contribute to energy security and self-reliance; (v) \npromote  private  sector  activities  including  those  owned  and  operated  by  women;  (vi)  make \nnatural gas available where demand exists, and also stimulate demand for gas instead of fuel \nwood  or  imported  oil;  and  (vii)  make  gas  supply  safe  by  avoiding  the  present    problem  of \nleakages.  Tariff  collection  will  improve  the  financial  viability  and  reduce  Government  subsidy. \nUse  of  indigenous  gas  will  save  foreign  exchange  used  to  import  energy.  The  increased  and \nmore  reliable  power  supply  will  encourage  private  sector  investment  in  all  sectors,  particularly \nmanufacturing,  commerce,  and  services.  The  improved  power  supply  will  improve  the \navailability of safe water, and the quality of health services. Improvement in health care delivery \nwill bring down maternal mortality. A summary of the poverty and social development strategy is \npresented in Appendix 11.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial Assessment \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n52. \nAn economic analysis of the three components of the Project has been undertaken, and \nthe findings and assumptions are summarized in the following paragraphs. Results of the base \ncases  and  sensitivity  analysis  for  each  component  are  given  in  Appendix  12.  As  the  numbers \nsuggest, investments in road and energy infrastructure are economically justified. However, the \nencouraging  results  for  the  energy  components  are  dependent  upon  certain  assumptions \nregarding  achievement  of  sector  restructuring  and  policy  reforms  as  anticipated  under  the \nPMPL,  leading  to  improvement  of  operational  and  administrative  efficiency  that  will,  among \nothers, call for streamlining of tariff structure, accounting, billing, and collection, and reduction of \ntransmission and distribution losses, as appropriate.   \n \n\na. \n\nRoad Infrastructure \n\n53. \nThe  economic  evaluation  of  the  road  rehabilitation  component  weighs  the  savings  in \nvehicle  operating  costs  and  travel  time  costs21  gained  by  the  Project  against  the  initial \ninvestment costs and the savings in future periodic and routine maintenance costs over a 20\u2013\nyear period. The level of current average daily traffic on various road sections varies from a low \nof  1,505  to  a  high  of  2,819.  The  economic  evaluation  indicates  that  the  overall  project  is \neconomically  viable,  with  an  Economic  Internal  Rate  of  Return  (EIRR)  of  31.5%  and  a  net \npresent  value  of  $167.5  million.  The  economic  returns  are  quite  robust,  as  indicated  in  the \nsensitivity  tests  by  decreasing  benefits  by  20%  and  increasing  costs  by  20%  and  both:  The \nEIRR  varied  from  23%  to  27%.  Similarly  reduction  of  traffic  growth  rates  by  25%  and  50  % \nreduces  EIRR  to  29%  and  26.5%,  respectively.  These  sensitivity  tests  demonstrate  that  the \nin  construction  cost, \noverall  project  component \nimplementation delays, and reduction in traffic growth. \n \n\nis  very  robust  considering \n\nincreases \n\n                                                 \n21 Travel-time savings contribute less than 10% to the benefit stream.  \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nb. \n\nPower Infrastructure \n\n54. \nFor  the  power  component,  the  benefit  streams  identified  over  a  20\u2013year  operating \nperiod, 2007-2026 reflects the importance of electric power and its distribution to the economic \nrecovery  of  the  country.  It  has  been  assumed  that  failure  to  provide  the  minimum  amount  of \nelectricity  to  Kabul  envisaged  by  this  Project  would  have  significant  repercussions  on  ADB\u2019s \nsector-specific  economic  growth  projections  (low  case)  for  Afghanistan.  Restricted  to  the \nmanufacturing and the trade sectors, it has been estimated that 25% of the projected growth to \n2015 and 10% of anticipated growth thereafter would fail to be achieved. These potential losses, \nto be avoided as a result of the Project, represent the principal benefits of the Project and are \ndeemed  conservative  in  light  of  the  current  situation  and  Kabul\u2019s  present  and  projected \npredominance in the economy of the country. The project exhibits a robust EIRR of 32% and a \nNPV  of  $414  million.  Sensitivity  analyses  revealed  that  a  20%  cost  increase  combined  with  a \n20% decrease in benefits would still result in an EIRR of 23%. \n \n\nc. \n\nGas Infrastructure \n\n55. \nRehabilitation  of  existing  pipeline  and  production  wells  appears  to  be  the  least\u2013cost \noption  compared  with  the  drilling  of  new  wells  and/or  building  a  new  pipeline.  The  economic \nbenefits of rehabilitating transmission and distribution facilities consist of revenues from the sale \nof  an  additional  320,000  cubic  meters  per  day.  The  additional  supply  is  attributed  to  250,000 \ncubic meters savings from losses and 70,000 cubic meters from new production. Revenue has \nbeen calculated at current average tariff of about $12.13 per 1000 cubic meters. The economic \nevaluation  indicates  that  the  overall  Project  is  economically  viable,  with  an  economic  internal \nrate  of  return  of  35%.  Sensitivity  tests  indicate  that  the  overall  project  component  is  robust  to \nvariations  in  construction  cost  and  benefits.  A  combined  cost  escalation  of  20%  and  benefit \nreduction of 20% results in a decline of EIRR to 23%. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nFinancial  analysis  of \n\nthe  energy  components \n\n56. \ninfrastructure \nrehabilitation) was undertaken. The financial rate of return for the Project is based on estimated \nincremental  revenues  and  costs  resulting  from  the  operations  of  the  power  and  gas \ninfrastructure  rehabilitated  under  the  Project.  Many  assumptions  underlying  financial  analysis \nare  the  same  as  those  discussed  earlier  for  economic  analysis.  Additional  assumptions  used \nhere and findings are described in paras. 57 \u2013 59. Details are provided in Appendix 13. \n \n\n(power  and  gas \n\na. \n\nPower Infrastructure \n\n57. \nThe  power  sector  is  weak,  as  the  power  supply  suffers  from  heavy  losses,  unreliable \npower  generation,  and  damaged  transmission  and  distribution  systems.  The  technical  and \nnontechnical losses are currently estimated at 45%. As an outcome of the Project, 200 MW at a \nload  factor  of  65%  is  expected  to  be  generated  in  rehabilitated  hydropower  plants  during \nsummer,  and  80  MW  at  a  load  factor  of  90%  during  winter  plus  45  MW  from  gas  turbines  as \npeak  load  during  6  hours  per  day.  In  addition,  200  MW  will  be  imported  from  the  neighboring \nCentral  Asian  Republics  (Turkmenistan  and  Uzbekistan)  at  a  load  factor  of  65%,  less  5% \ntransmission losses. In calculating the FIRR for the base case, the current average tariff of 2.4 \ncents/kWh and the current total system losses have been used. The average cost of generation \nis estimated at 0.9 US cents per kWh, and 2.0 US cents per kWh is projected for the imported \npower.  The  technical  losses  are  assumed  to  be  25%,  and  nontechnical  losses  20%.  The \ncollection  efficiency  is  extremely  poor  as  well  at  54%.  Considering  all  these  losses,  the \n\n\f 16\n\ncollection/generation  ratio  totals  only  around  30%.  Costs  for  O&M  and  administration  are \nestimated at 5% of the invested capital.  \n \n58. \nDue  to  existing  tariffs,  limited  technical  resources,  as  well  as  lack  of  accurate \nadministration, DABM is not financially viable at present. To make this Project component viable \nand at the same time bring DABM back to financial sustainability without heavy subsidies from \nthe government budget, major restructuring efforts are needed. These efforts have to be carried \nout simultaneously with a review of the current tariff structure to achieve financial sustainability. \nTo  reflect  possible  opportunities,  two  scenarios  have  been  analyzed  aside  from  the  above \npresented base case: \n \n\nThe first scenario assumes that the financial recovery is achieved solely through \ndecreased  technical  and  nontechnical  losses  directly  derived  from  the  project \ninvestments  (from  45%  to  30%)  as  well  as  increased  average  tariffs  from \ncurrently 2.4 US cents per KWh to 7.3 US cents per kWh to attain a 15% FIRR \non investment for this component. \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nIn attaining the same FIRR of 15%, the second scenario assumes major efforts in \nimproving  the  administration  of  meter  reading,  billing,  and  revenue  collection  in \navoiding  too  steep  tariff  increases.  If  the  commercial  losses,  aside  from  the \ntechnical  and  nontechnical,  can  be  brought  down  to  30%  from  the  currently \nestimated 46%, after the implementation of this Project, the average tariff will be \nlimited to 6.5 US cents per KWh. \n\n \n\nb. \n\nGas Infrastructure \n\n59. \nAfghan  Gas  under  MMI  is  responsible  for  production,  transmission,  and  distribution  of \nnatural gas. Given its very low level of tariff collection, Afghan Gas is currently not a financially \nviable  entity.  Major  restructuring  efforts  are  needed  with  regard  to  administration,  finance, \naccounting, billing, and revenue collection together with a review of the current tariff structure to \nrestore profitability. The current supply of 580,000 cubic meters a day, after accounting for high \nlosses  (250,000  cubic  meters  a  day)  in  transmission  and  distribution,  cannot  satisfy  the \nestimated demand of 900,000 cubic meters a day. The average tariff of $12.13 per 1000 cubic \nmeters is well below the comparable tariff in neighboring countries. Using the current rates and \nvolumes as presented by Afghan Gas, assuming a restructured Afghan Gas with (O&M) cost of \n5%  and  even  with  minimal  losses  in  transmission  and  distribution,  the  component  is  not \nfinancially  viable.  Major  tariff  rationalization  is  needed,  as  the  current  tariffs  are  significantly \nbelow current prices in neighboring countries. About 3.65 times increase in tariff will result in a \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 15%. In addition, the existing collection rate also needs \nmajor improvements. A collection rate of 75% for industrial/commercial consumers and 50% for \ndomestic consumers is assumed for achieving the 15% FIRR. Sensitivity analysis shows that a \nreduction  in  the  proposed  level  of  tariff  and  collection  rate  will  reduce  the  FIRR,  however \nfinancial  viability  could  still  be  achieved  with  a  different  combination  of  tariff  increase  and \nreduction in collection rate. \n \nC. \n\nProject Sustainability \n\n60. \nThough  not  a  primary  concern  for  emergency  assistance  projects  where  restoration  of \ninfrastructure  and  facilities  is  critical,  sustainability  considerations  are  important  for  long-term \nviability.  The  road  component  of  the  Project  relies  on  toll  collection  on the  improved  roads  for \nfunding  of  maintenance.  Generating  road  maintenance  revenues  through  toll  collection  has \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nbeen  in  practice  since  1974  in  Afghanistan.  Though  the  system  has  been  modified  over  the \nyears and may not be fully in practice at present, tolls offer a viable short-term means to finance \nroad maintenance. MPW is in the process of reviving tolls on the improved road sections. For \nsustainable funding of maintenance in the long term, the ongoing review of the transport sector, \nsponsored by Sida and supported by ADB and the World Bank, is preparing recommendations \nfor establishing a road fund with revenues generated through fuel levies, vehicle licensing, and \nroad user charges. \n \nFor the gas and power components, the Project includes capacity building efforts at the \n61. \noperational  level  that  will  improve  the  O&M  capacity  of  DABM  and  Afghan  Gas.  The  Project\u2013 \nproposed enhancement in tariff, reduction of technical and nontechnical losses, and increase in \ncollection rates are critical for the financial sustainability of these institutions. Major institutional \nimprovements  have  a  key  role  in  achieving  these  objectives.  It  is  recognized  that  full  cost \nrecovery  will  take  time.  Since  the  energy  components  are  networked  systems,  it  is  difficult  to \nachieve  cost  efficiencies  at  this  stage.  Cost  recovery  is  actually  the  next  step  after  the \ntransmission  and  distribution  systems  have  been  rehabilitated  and  improved  through  the \nProject. However, the Government has shown deep commitment to pursue the reforms and set \nspecific targets for achieving institutional improvements and enhancing cost recovery during the \nrecently concluded Afghanistan Development Forum.  \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impact  \n\nthe  gas \n\ninfrastructure  component  will \n\n62. \nThe Project is classified as a Category B environmental Project, as it is unlikely to have \nany  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.  For  the  road  and  power  distribution  and \ntransmission  lines,  the  rehabilitation  will  follow  existing  alignments.  Hence,  these  components \nare  deemed  to  have  minor  environmental  impacts.  In  addition,  the  power  distribution  and \ntransmission  component  will  not  involve  replacement  of  transformers  and  conductors,  and \ntherefore  there  will  be  no  scrap  equipment  containing  polychlorinated  biphenyl.  Environmental \nimpacts related to the construction activities will be mitigated and will  be incorporated into the \ncontractor\u2019s  responsibilities.  While \nthe \nenvironmental  conditions  of  the  project  area,  these  components  will  involve  activities  that \ngenerate  environmental  problems  related  with  hazardous  wastes.  Therefore,  a  waste \nmanagement  plan  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  prior  to  executing  any  construction \nwork. Environmental monitoring, particularly for pollution into the water, will be developed as a \npart  of  project  implementation.  The  summary  initial  environmental  examination  is  attached  as \nAppendix 14. \n \n63. \nThe road component will improve the environment in a number of ways: (i) improving the \nsupply of fuel, thereby reducing pressure on forests for fuel wood; (ii) improving fuel efficiency, \nthereby saving fuel and reducing pollution; (iii) stabilizing embankments; (iv) preventing erosion; \n(v) channelizing water; and (vi) reducing permanent loss of agricultural land from encroachment \nby vehicles along roads. The Project will optimize the use of natural gas, reduce dependence on \npetroleum, and curtail the demand for fuel wood, thereby saving forests. Safety will be improved \nas pipeline leakages are eliminated. A cathodic protection system for the buried gas pipelines \nwill safeguard against corrosion. \n \nE. \n\nimprove \n\nRisks \n\nImplementation of the Project entails a number of risks: \n\n64. \n \n\n\f 18\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe overall political and security situation remains volatile. ADB will need \nto  closely  monitor  the  situation  and  coordinate  with  local  and  central \nauthorities and the United Nation to ensure adequate protection.22 \n\nGovernment  implementation  capacity  being  very  weak,  there  may  be \nundue  delays  in  implementation  of  key  activities.  Also  the  lack  of \naccounting  and  auditing  capacity  implies  a  risk  of  corruption.  Resources \nhave  been  allocated  for  consultancy  services  to  assist  in  project \nmanagement  and  implementation.  Additional  capacity\u2013building  initiatives \nfocused  on  financial  management  have  been  provided  under  the  TAC. \nBesides,  MOF  will  establish  a  strong  coordination  and  monitoring \nmechanism. ADB will also field review missions as frequently necessary. \n\nThe  Government  may  not  provide  counterpart  resources,  in  a  timely \nmanner, of the type required. ADB will work closely with AACA, MOF, and \nthe IAs to address this issue. \n\nRehabilitated  roads  may  not  be  maintained  properly,  leading  to  rapid \ndeterioration. The deterioration process will be further accelerated by lack \nof  axle  load  controls.  The  adjustment  cost  for  policy  reforms  under  the \nPMPL  includes  resources  for  road  maintenance  and  establishment  of \nweighing  stations.  The  Government  will  be  encouraged \nto  make \nappropriate allocation of budgetary resources for this purpose. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe Government has given the following specific assurances, in addition to the standard \n\n65. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nThe Government will provide adequate security for the smooth and uninterrupted \nimplementation of the Project. \n\nThe Government will ensure that the objectives, policies, and actions set forth in \nthe  development  policy  letter  dated  4  November  2002  and  the  policy  matrix \nattached to the development policy letter (together, the Policy Letter) relating to \nADB\u2019s  Postconflict  Multisector  Program  Loan  to  the  Government  will  (a)  be \nachieved, adopted, undertaken, and implemented in the manner stipulated in the \nPolicy  Letter;  and  (b)  continue  to  be  in  full  force  and  effect  during  the \nimplementation and O&M stages of the Project. \n\nThe Government will allocate and make available, in a timely manner, sufficient \nfunds from its budget for each fiscal year for the O&M of the project facilities and \nwill  ensure  that  such  facilities  are  operated  and  maintained  in  accordance  with \nsound practices in the transport and energy sectors. For the maintenance of the \nroad  component  of  the  Project,  the  Government  will,  as  a  short\u2013term  measure, \nensure  implementation  of  a  toll  collection  system  on  improved  roads.  Based  on \nthe recommendations of the ongoing Transport Sector Review, the Government \n\n                                                 \n22 Coordination with the United States\u2013sponsored provincial reconstruction teams providing security for development \n\nactivities in Kabul and other provinces may also be explored.  \n\n\f \n\n19\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nwill, in a timely manner, establish sustainable means for revenue generation such \nas  setting  up  a  dedicated  road  maintenance  fund  based  on  fuel  levies,  vehicle \nlicensing, and other road user\u2013related taxes.      \n\nTo  ensure  long-term  viability  of  the  power  component  of  the  Project,  the \nGovernment  will,  before  the  completion  of  the  power  component,  finalize  and \nenter  into  long\u2013term  power  purchase/supply  agreements  with  its  neighboring \ncountries for sufficient and uninterrupted supply of electricity to the country. \n\nTo  secure  an  adequate  and  continuous  supply  of  electricity  to  the  country,  the \nGovernment will comply with its payment obligations under the aforesaid power \npurchase/supply  agreements.  For  such  purpose,  the  Government  will,  if \nnecessary, allocate and set aside adequate funds from its budget for each fiscal \nyear to meet its payment obligations under such agreements. \n\nThe  Government  will  adopt  and  implement  strict  measures  (a)  for  improved \nmetering, billing, and collection of arrears for the power and gas components of \nthe Project; and (b) to eliminate evasion of electricity payments by consumers. \n\nThe Government will, if necessary, increase power and gas tariffs to achieve full \ncost  recovery  in  the  medium  term  based  on  actual  technical  and  nontechnical \nlosses. In case the Government decides to protect vulnerable groups against the \nadverse  impacts  of  tariff  increases  by  subsidization,  it  will  ensure  that  such \nsupport will be paid directly from its budget and the subsidy will be targeted for \nthe poor.  \n\n(viii)  The Government will ensure timely construction and implementation of the Pule \nKhumri  220  kV \nto  guarantee  successful \ncommissioning of the proposed Project, in particular, transmission of at least 150 \nMW of electricity to Kabul. The Government will also ensure the integration and \ncorrelation of the proposed Project with the Pule Khumri 220 kV transmission line \nsegment. \n\nline  segment \n\ntransmission \n\nThe Government will ensure that no duties or other similar levies will be imposed \non any equipment, material or services required for the Project, and if such duties \nand levies are imposed, they will be paid by the Government promptly to ensure \ntimely project implementation.  \n\nTo  the  extent  feasible,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the  reconstruction  and \nrehabilitation  of  the  project  components  will  be  carried  out  on  land  already \nacquired and/or owned by the Government. The Government will further ensure \nthat  no  persons  will  be  adversely  affected  in  terms  of  the  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous People. In case there \nare  adjustments  to  the  rights\u2013of\u2013way  that  necessitate  land  acquisition,  a  social \nscreening  and  assessment  plan  will  be  prepared  by  the  EA  and  submitted  to \nADB for review and approval to ensure that the social and economic base of the \naffected persons will be restored and/or enhanced through mitigating measures. \nThe  Government  will  also  ensure  that,  if  essential,  all  land  and  rights\u2013of\u2013way \nrequired for project implementation will be made available in a timely manner.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\n 20\n\n \n\nimplemented,  operated,  and  maintained \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  adequate  environmental  protection  and  safety \nmeasures are included in the design of the project facilities; and that the Project \nis \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure,  Industrial,  and  Power \nDevelopment Projects and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy, as amended from time to \ntime, and the recommendations made in the management plan set out in the IEE. \n\nThe Government will ensure that a specific plan for local consultation to address \nsafety, social, and cultural issues, during project implementation, will be included \nin  the  bidding  documents.    The  Government  will  further  ensure  that  men  and \nwomen  are  given  equal  employment  opportunities  for  benefits  from  the  Project.  \nThe mechanisms for maximizing local employment benefits will be included in the \nproject design and the bidding documents.   \n\n(xiii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  civil  works  contracts  include  legally \nmandated  provisions  on  health  and  sanitation  and  on  appropriate  working \nfor  construction \nconditions, \nworkers at campsites during the construction period. \n\nincluding  accommodation,  where  appropriate, \n\n(xiv)  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will establish fully staffed \n\nand equipped offices of the PCU in MOF and PIUs in MPW, MMI, and MWP. \n\n(xv)  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  establish  a  PCU, \nchaired  by  the  deputy  minister  of  finance  and  consisting  of  the  ministers  of  the \nIAs, with the project coordinator serving as the secretary.    \n\n \nB. \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\n66. \nconsultation with ADB. \n \n\n67. \nADB and recommend that the Board approve \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe Government will appoint the project coordinator and project directors of the PIUs in \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights \n110,018,000  to  the  Transitional  Islamic  State  of  Afghanistan  for  the \nEmergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project, from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% \nper annum, a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with \nthose  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the  Board;  in \naddition,  the  total  amount  of  the  interest  charge  during  the  grace  period \nwill be capitalized and charged to the Loan Account; and \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nin  respect  of  such  loan,  a  variation  from  the  existing  loan  terms  under \nADF resources on an exceptional basis. \n\n12 May 2003 \n\n \n \n\nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n\nMonitoring \nMechanism \n\n \nADB\u2019s project \nperformance audit \nreport \n\n \nADB loan review \nmissions \n \nADB\u2019s project \ncompletion report  \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks \n\n \n\n \nStable political and \nsecurity situation \n \n  \n\n \n \nExecuting and \nimplementing \nagencies\u2019 progress \nreports \n \nConsultants\u2019 periodic \nreports \n \n \n \nADB project review \nmissions \n \n  \n \n \n\n \n \nImproved capacity of \nimplementing \nagencies \n \n \nRealistic tariff \nstructure and \nimproved revenue \ncollection \n \nImproved \nmanagement and \nefficiency of power \nand gas utilities \n \nSystems established \nfor operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) \nof rehabilitated \ninfrastructure \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \n\nGoal \nEconomic growth and \npoverty reduction  \n \n \nPurpose \nRehabilitate and \nreconstruct key \ninfrastructure  \n \n \n \n \n \n\nOutputs \n \n1.

The  major  external  agencies  financing  these \nrehabilitation works are (i) the United States through the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment  (USAID),  (ii)  Japan  through  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA), \n(iii)  the  World  Bank,  (iv)  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  (ADB);  (v)  the  European  Commission, \n(vi)  Sweden  through  the  Swedish  International  Development  Agency,  (vii)  Italy,  (viii)  Iran,  (ix) \nPakistan, and (x) Saudi Arabia.      \n \n2. \nThe power sector in Afghanistan is currently supported by four major agencies: (i) ADB, \n(ii)  Germany  through  Kreditanstalt  f\u1ee7r  Wiederaufbau  (KfW)  and  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u1ee7r \nTechnische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ),  (iii)  USAID,  and  (iv)  the  World  Bank.  The  European \nCommission is providing cofinancing for the KfW project to carry out investments in the power \nsector.  JICA  has  appraised  some  urgent  power  infrastructure  rehabilitation  works  in  Kabul, \nthough  these  are  yet  to  be  approved  by  the  Japanese  Government.  Other  bilaterals  (Iran  and \nIndia) have shown interest, but the details need to be confirmed.  \n \n3. \nIn  the  gas  sector,  the  bulk  of  assistance  is  being  provided  by  ADB  in  the  form  of \ntechnical  assistance.  The  World  Bank  is  also  providing  technical  assistance  for  policy, \nregulatory, and technical support in a number of sectors including gas. \n \n4. \n \n\nTable A2.1 \u2013 A2.3 summarize external assistance in road, power, and gas sectors. \n\nTable A2.1: External Assistance in the Road Sector \n\n \n\n \nDuration \n\n2003\u201304 \n2003 \n\nAmount \n($million) \n \n\u2013 \n4.20 \n\n \nProject  \n1.

With  a  large  area  (of  about  652,000  square \nkilometers)  and  population  of  24  million  widely  spread  across  the  largely  mountainous \nterrain, roads are the only means of transport not only for facilitating urgent humanitarian aid \nand  returning  refugees,  but  more  importantly  for  economic  revival  and  development.  Key \ncomponents  of  the  primary  road  network  are  the  2,200  kilometer  (km)  ring  road  that \nconnects Afghanistan\u2019s  major regional centers  (Herat, Kandahar, Mazar Sharif,  Meymaneh \nand  Sheberghan)  with  Kabul  and  the  six  international  links  to  neighboring  countries  (Iran, \nPakistan,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan).  These  roads  are  essential  to \nAfghanistan\u2019s economy, but they have suffered widespread damage due to the last 20 years \nof hostilities, allied with the lack of any effective maintenance. The general condition of these \nroads  is  poor  to  very  poor,  which  results  in  long  journey  times  and  high  transport  costs.  \nInternational  trade  is  stifled  by  these  poor  road  links,  and  agricultural  development  is \nsuppressed  by  the  difficulties  growers  have  in  transporting  perishable  goods  to  the  main \npopulation centers.   \n \n2. \nTo  keep  up  with  increasing  traffic  volume,  to  promote  trade  links  with  neighbouring \ncountries,  and  to  improve  movement  of  goods  and  services,  thereby  fostering  trade  and \ncommerce,  it is essential that the entire primary  road network be rehabilitated on a  priority \nbasis.  This  is  also  supported  by  the  findings  of  the  comprehensive  needs  assessment \n(CNA)1 for the transport sector.  The road rehabilitation efforts should not only respond to the \ncurrent requirements of domestic trade but also start taking advantage of the possibilities of \nexpansion  of  regional  trade.  The  Government  has  declared  that  reconstruction  and \nrehabilitation of the road system, especially of national roads, is the country\u2019s top priority in \nreconstruction. Improved roads will not only facilitate the physical and political integration of \nAfghanistan  but  also  help  unify  the  international  and  domestic  trade  of  Afghanistan.  \nRebuilding  the  road  network  is  also  critical  in  facilitating  humanitarian  and  development \nassistance.  The  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  work  will  maximize  labor-intensive \nconstruction  methods,  providing  much-needed  employment  and  income  generation.  It  will \ncontribute  to  social  stability,  by  engaging,  among  others,  refugees  and  ex-combatants. \nProduction,  trade,  and  commerce  will  be  promoted,  thereby  expediting  economic  recovery \nand growth. A strengthened transport system will serve regional interests, with the possibility \nof reestablishing Afghanistan as a trade hub. The benefits for Afghanistan will be enormous. \n \nB.  \n \n3. \nThe  main  objective  of  this  project  component  is  to  promote  economic  development \nby carrying  out  rehabilitation  of  the primary  road  network  in  northern  Afghanistan.  This  will \nimprove local, regional, and international access and will reduce transport costs and journey \ntimes.  The  road  will  be  restored  to  a  good  maintainable  condition,  and  road  maintenance \ncosts will be reduced.   \n \nThe  scope  of  work  covers  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction2  of  (i)  392  km  of  the \n4. \nprimary  ring  road  running  between  Pule  Khumri,  Mazar  Sharif,  Sheberghan,  and  Andkhoy; \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n                                                 \n1  The transport sector CNA was based on findings of a joint aid mission in March 2002.  The report was finalized \n\nin May 2002.   \n\n2  The Ministry  of Public  Works  standards  for  national  roads,  which  are  consistent  with  international standards, \ninclude 7 meters (m) pavement with 2 m shoulders (partly paved or improved) on either side. These standards \nhave  been  agreed  among  the  aid  agencies  providing  assistance  for  rehabilitation  of  national  roads  in \nAfghanistan. \n\n \n\n\f26\n\nAppendix 3 \n\nComponents and Output \n\nand (ii) 55 km of the primary international link that runs from the Naibabad junction (some 25 \nkm east of Mazar Sharif) to the border crossing with Uzbekistan at Hairatan.   \n \nC.  \n \nThe  project  component  comprises  (i)  rehabilitation  of  157  km  of  existing  road \n5. \npavement (Naibabad Junction to a point 22 km east of Andkhoy); (ii) crack sealing, patching, \nand a surface seal of 219 km of existing road pavement (Pule Khumri to Naibabad Junction \nand  Naibabad  Junction  to  Hairatan);  (iii)  construction  of  22  km  of  road  pavement  on  an \nexisting  embankment  (east  side  of  Andkhoy);  (iv)  reconstruction  of  1  bridge  that  has  been \nwashed  out;  (v)  rehabilitation  and  repair  of  66  existing  bridges  and  388  existing  drainage \nstructures  and  culverts;  (vi)  stabilization  of embankment  slips;  (vii)  construction  of  busbays \nand  turnouts;  (viii)  provision  of  other  safety  features  such  as  guard  railings,  road  markings \nand  road  signs;  and  (ix)  consulting  services  for  design  review,  project  management,  and \nconstruction supervision. \n \nD.  \n \n6. \nequivalent as summarized in Table A3.1.  \n \n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  road  infrastructure  component  is  estimated  at  $89.96  million \n\nCost Estimates \n\nTable A3.1:   Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nItem \n \nCivil Works \nConsulting Services \nIncremental Administrative Support \nPhysical and Price Contingencies \nInterest During Grace Period \n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nForeign \n\nLocal \n\nExchange  Currency \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  13.77 \n0.29 \n \n0.29 \n \n1.47 \n \n \n1.40 \n  17.22 \n\n55.09 \n4.24 \n1.31 \n6.21 \n5.89 \n72.74 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nTotal \nCost \n68.86 \n4.53 \n1.60 \n7.68 \n7.29 \n89.96 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nE.  \n \n7. \nMPW will be the implementing agency (IA) for the road component of the Project.

MPW is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the primary road network.  \nIn the past, road maintenance was carried out under force account or through its parastatal \nconstruction department. Due to lack of funds, at present MPW is able to carry out only the \nemergency  maintenance,  particularly  in  the  northern  region.  Lack  of  skilled  manpower  for \nplanning and management, and lack of operational plant and equipment are generic causes \nfor  low  maintenance  capability.  This  situation  is  not  likely  to  improve  unless  the  whole \nspectrum of maintenance funding issues, management, and implementation activities at the \nnational,  regional,  and  local  levels  are  addressed.  Under  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)-financed  technical  assistance  cluster  (TAC),  maintenance  management  expertise  is \n\n                                                 \n3   See detailed cost breakdown in Table A3.3. \n\n \n\n\f28\n\nAppendix 3 \n\ninvolves  review  of \n\nimparted to MPW staff in terms of carrying out inventory and road condition surveys. Under \nthe  same  TAC,  ADB  is  assisting  the  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation \nAgency\u2013sponsored  Transport  Sector  Review,  which \nthe  policy, \ninstitutional, and sector needs. The Transport Sector includes, among others, preparation of \nrecommendations for road maintenance funding, planning and implementation with a move \ntowards  funding  through  cost  recovery  from  road  users,  and  the  use  of  private  sector \ncontractors to perform periodic and routine maintenance. MPW is reviewing an old system of \ntoll  collection  on  both  sides  of  the  Salang  tunnel  and  in  the  Kabul  area.  If  successful,  this \nseems to be an appropriate short-term solution for generating revenues for maintenance of \nimproved roads. \n \n12. \nAt the present time, there appears to be no effective control of axle loads on vehicles \ncarrying goods. Vehicles are overloaded in terms of weight and height of the load.  Not only \ndoes  this  impact  on  safety,  but  overloaded  vehicles  reduce  the  effective  life  of  the \nrehabilitated  pavement.  Effective  action  to  control  axle  loads  needs  to  be  taken  at  the \nnational  level  in  the  first  instance  through  installation  of  weighing  devices4  at  selected \nlocations on the national road network.   \n \n\nTable A3.3: Detailed Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nItem \n \nRoad Rehabilitation Contract 1 \n(Pule Khumri to Mazar Sharif and Naibabad Junction to Hairatan  - 244 \nkm) \nPreliminary Items \nEarthworks \nPavement \nStructures \nRoad Furniture \nService Diversions \nContingencies \nSubtotal \nRoad Rehabilitation Contract 2 \n(Mazar-Sharif to Sheberghan to Andkhoy \u2013 204 km) \nPreliminary Items \nEarthworks \nPavement \nStructures \nRoad Furniture \nService Diversions \nContingencies \nSubtotal \n \nTotal for Road Rehabilitation Contracts 1 and 2  \n \nConsulting Services \n \nOther Costs \n \n                                                                                    Total Cost \n\nLocal \n\nForeign \nTotal \nCurrency Currency  Cost \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.7 \n2.1 \n10.0 \n4.5 \n2.1 \n0 \n2.2 \n23.6 \n \n \n5.3 \n1.9 \n23.6 \n0.7 \n2.0 \n0.1 \n4.1 \n37.7 \n \n61.3 \n \n4.2 \n \n7.2 \n \n72.7 \n\n0.7 \n0.5 \n2.6 \n1.1 \n0.5 \n0 \n0.5 \n5.9 \n \n \n1.3 \n0.6 \n6.6 \n0.2 \n0.4 \n0.0 \n1.0 \n9.3 \n \n15.2 \n \n0.3 \n \n1.7 \n \n17.2 \n\n3.4 \n2.6 \n12.6 \n5.6 \n2.6 \n0 \n2.7 \n29.5 \n \n \n6.6 \n2.5 \n30.2 \n0.9 \n2.4 \n0.1 \n5.1 \n47.0 \n \n76.5 \n \n4.5 \n \n8.9 \n \n89.9 \n\n                                                 \n4   Under the Postconflict Multisector Program Loan, the adjustment cost includes provision of weighing devices \n\nto be installed at a number of locations on the ring road and international link roads. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n29\n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nPOWER INFRASTRUCTURE  \n\n1. \nThe power infrastructure of Afghanistan comprises mainly three isolated power systems \ncentered around Kabul, Mazar Sharif, and Kandahar cities. There is no national grid. The entire \nelectric power infrastructure (covering generation, transmission, and distribution equipment, and \nconsumer  service  connections)  is  in  a  very  poor  condition,  caused  by  almost  continuous \nconflicts over the last two decades. The overall power system is characterized by daily rationing \nof  electricity,  frequent  brownouts  caused  by  system  faults  and  a  dysfunctional  protection \nsystem,  aging  power  generation  plants,  missing  overhead  transmission  and  distribution  lines, \nhazardous exposed cable joints, and high system losses. The electrification ratio is estimated to \nbe only about 6% and the annual per capita consumption of electricity is estimated to be about \n16  Kilowatt-hour  (kWh),  which  ranks  among  the  lowest  in  the  world.  Of  an  estimated  total  of \nabout  230,000  electricity  consumers  in  the  country,  about  76,000  are  located  in  Kabul  and  its \nsurrounding districts. \n \nThe Kabul power system is supplied mainly by four snow-fed hydroelectric plants with an \n2. \ninstalled capacity of nearly 200 megawatts (MW)1 but with a firm output of only about 65 MW in \nthe 2003 winter season due to the low availability of water compounded by the aging generating \nplants.  A  diesel-fired  gas  turbine  plant,  recently  rehabilitated  with  World  Bank  assistance, \nproduces a peaking output of 45 MW. The peak load demand of Kabul city and its surrounding \ndistricts decreased from about 250 MW in 1996 to an estimated 160 MW in January 2003, as \nonly about 40% of the distribution networks are operational, and the rest of the networks have \nonly  poles  standing,  with \nline  conductors  missing.  The  proposed  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction  of  the  Kabul  distribution  network  together  with  the  ongoing  interventions  by  the \nWorld  Bank  and  Kreditanstalt  f\u1ee7r  Wiederaufbau  (KfW)  will  contribute  an  additional  100  MW  of \npeak load demand by end 2005. Hence, there is a need in the short term to increase the power \nsupply  to  Kabul  by  about  150  MW  to  meet  its  expected  peak  load  demand  of  260  MW.2  The \nleast-cost option is through power imports from neighboring Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan (see \npara. 4).  \n \n3. \nTechnical losses are estimated to be about 25% (due to overloading of transmission and \ndistribution equipment and makeshift substandard overhead conductor and underground cable \njoints), while nontechnical losses (due mainly to pilferage and partly to lack of reliable metering) \nare  estimated  to  be  as  high  as  20%.  Besides  contributing  to  the  very  high  technical  losses, \nexposed cable joints pose considerable safety risks to the public, especially during winter and \nrainy periods when the danger of electrocution for those walking in the vicinity of such joints is \ngreatly increased. \n \n4. \nAfghanistan currently imports, based on yearly annual power purchase agreements, up \nto  25  MW  each  from  Turkmenistan  (via  existing  110  kilovolt  [kV]  transmission  link)  and \nUzbekistan (via damaged 220 kV link but operated at 110 kV) to supplement the load demands \ncentered around Andhkoy, Sheberghan, and Mazar Sharif in the northern provinces. According \n\n                                                           \n1   Naghlu  (4x25  MW),  Mahipar  (3x22  MW),  Sarobi  (2x11  MW),  and  Darunta  (3x4  MW).  However,  the  current \ncombined  working  capacity  is  only  about  160  MW.  After  rehabilitation  of  these  four  plants,  provided  by  ongoing \nWorld Bank and European Commission assistance, the combined generating output is expected to be restored up \nto about 200  MW, subject to availability  of water.  During winter, the low availability  of water limits the combined \nfirm output to about 80 MW. \n\n2   The expected peak load demand of 260 MW, only 4% higher than the 1996 actual figure of 250 MW, is constrained \nby the limited extent of damaged distribution networks being rehabilitated and reconstructed with funding from the \nWorld Bank and KfW, and to be rehabilitated and reconstructed under the proposed Project.  \n\n\f \n30\n\nAppendix 4 \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\nto the Ministry of Water and Power (MWP), Afghanistan and Uzbekistan have recently signed a \n10\u2013year power purchase agreement for the import of 150 MW from Uzbekistan at an initial price \nof $0.02 per kWh for the first year3 to meet the acute power supply shortfall in Kabul. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe power component of the Project will focus on (i) rehabilitation and reconstruction of \ndamaged transmission lines and substations in the northern power system to enable increased \npower  imports;  (ii)  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  damaged  Kabul  distribution  network  to \nrestore electricity supply to consumers and reduce system losses; and (iii) consulting services \nfor  detailed  design,  engineering,  and  project  implementation  supervision.  This  component  has \nbeen formulated in close consultation with MWP, taking into account the assistance committed \nby  other  development  partners  in  the  subsector.  The  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  the \nKabul distribution system will complement and integrate the efforts provided by the World Bank, \nKfW, and the European Commission to bring about a total improvement in electric power supply \nto Kabul city and surrounding districts that will reduce system losses, improve security, provide \nreliability and quality of electricity supply to residential and commercial users, and also support \nlight  industries  to  promote  economic  growth.  Damaged  equipment  will  be  replaced  to  ensure \nthat  electrical  hazards,  specifically  those  attributed  to  exposed  cable  joints,  will  be  minimized. \nThe  related  policy  and  institutional  reforms  in  the  power  subsector  are  reflected  in  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)\u2013financed Postconflict Multisector Program Loan.4   \n \nC. \n \nThe power component will cover (i) rehabilitation and reconstruction of about 230 circuit-\n6. \nkilometers  (cct-km)  of  220  kV  transmission  lines  and  about  50  cct-km  of  110  kV  transmission \nlines; (ii) reconstruction of Khulum and Pule Khumri 220/110 kV substations, (iii) reconstruction \nof  distribution  substations;  (iv)  reconstruction  of  junctions;  (v)  supply  and  installation  of  75 \ndistribution  transformers  and  30,000  single-phase  energy  meters;  (vi)  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction of about 230 cct-km of medium voltage  overhead conductors and poles, about \n30  cct-km  of  medium  voltage  cables,  about  210  cct-km  of  low  voltage    aerial  bundled \nconductors,  and  about  35  cct-km  of  low  voltage  cables;  (vii)  supply  of  testing  equipment  and \ntools; (viii) computerized billing and revenue collection, including 50 data loggers; (ix) setting up \nan  interim  load  dispatch  center  for  monitoring  the  Kabul  power  system  based  on  satellite \ncommunication  to  facilitate  demand  and  supply  management;  and  (x)  development  of  a \ngeographic information system to improve asset and customer management. \n \n \nD. \n \n7. \nequivalent as summarized in Table A4.1. \n \n \n \n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Power  Infrastructure  Component  is  estimated  at  $35.97  million \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nCost Estimates \n\n                                                           \n3  The price will be negotiated later for future years. \n4  ADB. 2002.

A  president,  who  reports  to  the  professional  Deputy \nMinister of MWP, heads DABM. DABM has about 5,200 staff, but they lack computers, modern \ncommunication  equipment,  and  training  in  best  practices.  During  the  conflict  period,  proper \nmaintenance  and  repairs  could  not be  carried  out  on  the  power  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution systems. This has been exacerbated by the non-availability of spares, tools, testing \nequipment, and vehicles. Staff morale and productivity are low. Consultants engaged under the \n\n                                                           \n5 See detailed cost breakdown in Table A4.3. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n33\n\nADB-assisted  Capacity  Building  Technical  Assistance  cluster6  have  since  August  2002  been \nworking  closely  with  MWP  and  DABM  counterparts  to  strengthen  MWP  capacity  in  project \nplanning,  design,  and  management;  and  DABM  capacity  in  asset  management,  load \ndispatching,  accounting,  billing,  revenue  collection,  and  O&M.

Manila. \n\n\f34\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nA.  \n\nRationale \n\n \n\nGAS INFRASTRUCTURE  \n \n\n \n\nThe  Project  component  is  consistent  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  policy  on \n1. \nrehabilitation assistance after disasters, as it is the least-cost solution for the restoration of gas \ninfrastructure.1 The most important indigenous primary energy resource in Afghanistan is natural \ngas.  The  infrastructure  of  the  gas  sector  is  in  a  state  of  decline,  caused  by  a  combination  of \nfactors that include the direct effects of the wars that the country has undergone, the shortage of \nexpertise,  and  unavailability  of  spare  parts  and  equipment  due  to  lack  of  funding.  The  gas \nproduction, transmission,  and  distribution  systems  have  severe  operating  problems  and  are  in \nurgent  need  of  rehabilitation.  Gas  availability  is  grossly  inadequate  to  meet  the  current \nrequirements  mainly  due  to  loss  of  production  facilities  and  high  rate  of  leakage.  The  gas \nleakage is not only a loss of revenue but also a major safety hazard.  \n \n2. \nThe  immediate  problems  facing  the  gas  subsector  in  Afghanistan  relate  to  (i)  lack  of \nequipment,  spare  parts  and  materials  to  maintain  integrity  of  operations;  (ii)  inadequate \nresources  for  repairs  and  rehabilitation  of  production  wells,  gas  processing  plant,  and \ntransmission  and  distribution  pipelines;  (iii)  lack  of  expertise  in  geological  and  geophysical \nassessment  of  gas  fields  including  gas  field  management  and  reservoir  depletion;  and  (iv) \nabsence  of  corrosion  prevention  and  cathodic  protection  of  gathering  mains  and  of  the \ntransmission  and  distribution  network.  Eight  gas  fields  have  been  discovered  in  the  northern \npart of the country, of which three have been developed. Gas production commenced in 1967. \nIn the earlier years, most of the country\u2019s gas was exported to the Soviet Union. The export of \ngas terminated in 1987 with the end of Soviet domination in Afghanistan. \n \n3. \nFor domestic consumption of gas, transmission pipelines were built from Shebarghan to \nMazar-e Sharif, located at a distance of about 135 kilometers. The consumers of natural gas in \nthe  two  cities  and  smaller  towns  and  villages  in  the  vicinity  of  the  transmission  lines  were \nconnected  through  distribution  pipelines.  The  present  network  serves  a  fertilizer  plant;  a  gas \nfired thermal power plant with a total capacity of 48 Megawatts at the fertilizer factory site; the \ncommercial  sector  such  as  bakeries,  textile  factory,  food  processing  plant,  etc.,  and  domestic \nconsumers for heating and cooking. Present gas production is less than one fourth of the level \nproduced in the early 1980s. \n \n4. \nThe  entity  responsible  for  gas  production,  transmission,  and  distribution  (Afghan  Gas) \nurgently  needs  modern  technology  related  to  field  depletion  and  reservoir  management.    The \nreservoir pressures have decreased significantly, and a large number of production wells have \nbeen  shut  down.    Some  of  the  nonproducing  wells  have  to  be  worked-over  to  enhance \nproduction  and  to  prolong  the  life  of  the  fields.  Gas  availability  is  inadequate  to  meet  current \ndemand due to loss of production facilities and high rate of leakage; 30% of the gas currently \nproduced  leaks  to  the  atmosphere,  as  several  transmission  and  distribution  pipelines  have \ncorroded.  There  is  no  cathodic  protection  system  installed,  which  leaves  buried  pipelines \nexposed to corrosion. In many places gas pipelines have been constructed without adhering to \nsafety  standards  and  industry  good  practices.  The  transmission  and  distribution  systems  will \nhave to be rehabilitated and upgraded. Condensates and other pollutant effluents are presently \nbeing discharged in areas adjacent to the gas transmission lines which poses health hazards for \nwhich mitigation measures are urgently required.  \n\n                                                 \n1  Based on the findings of Technical Assistance Cluster 3874- AFG: Capacity Building for Reconstruction and \n\nDevelopment for $14.5 million, which included oil and gas sector among others \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n35\n\nObjectives and Scope \n\nIt  is  proposed  to  increase  the  availability  of  gas  by  rehabilitation  of  wells,  upgrading  of \n5. \nproduction facilities, and repair and rehabilitation of transmission and distribution pipelines.  The \nproposed  Project  will  optimize  the  use  of  indigenous  natural  gas  and  reduce  dependence  on \npetroleum  fuel.  The  increased  supply  of  natural  gas  will  also  help  curtail  the  demand  for  fuel \nwood,  thereby  reducing  deforestation.  Fuel  wood  accounts  for  about  75%  of  total  energy \nsupplies,  and  constitutes  the  basic  source  of  energy  for  cooking  and  heating  in  rural  areas, \nwhere  the  majority  of  the  population  live.  Long-term  sustainability  requires  promoting  the \ndevelopment  of  natural  gas  resources  on  a  least\u2013cost  basis  in  an  environmentally  sound  and \nsocially acceptable way. There is an immediate need for external assistance in the rehabilitation \nof  the  current  infrastructure  facilities  and  in  the  further  development  of  the  sector.  The  project \ncomponents will enhance environmental and safety standards, reduce ecological problems, and \npromote  efficiency  of  natural  gas  use.  In  light  of  the  above,  the  Government  has  given  high \npriority to the rehabilitation and development of natural gas as a significant source of energy in \nthe country. \n \nB.  \n \n6. \nThe  main  objective  of  this  project  component  is  to  increase  indigenous  natural  gas \nproduction, transmission, and distribution capability by rehabilitating and repairing the integrated \ngas  supply  and  distribution  system  while  enhancing  environmental  and  safety  standards, \npromoting improved efficiency of natural gas use, and strengthening the institutional capabilities \nof Afghan Gas for the future development of the gas sector. \n \n7. \nThe gas infrastructure in the country is poorly managed, mainly due to the shutdown of a \nnumber of production wells, closure of gas processing facilities, and high rate of gas losses from \nthe transmission and distribution network. There is lack of geological and geophysical expertise \nin  the  country,  which  urgently  needed  to  establish  the  gas  field  management  strategy  and  to \ndetermine  the  optimum  field  depletion  policy  as  reservoir  pressures  have  decreased \nsignificantly.  The  scope  of  work  will  encompass  a  wide  range  of  rehabilitation  activities.  The \nproducing gas fields need to be rehabilitated to enhance gas production and to prolong the life \nof the fields. Some of the nonproducing wells have to be worked over, and the wells that were \nuncompleted need to be reevaluated. The quality of gas from some of the wells is not suitable \nas feedstock for fertilizer production due to the high hydrogen sulfide content in particular gas \nbearing zones. A skid\u2013mounted gas processing plant needs to be installed for hydrogen sulfide \nremoval,  as  rehabilitation  of  the  present  plant  is  not  cost  effective.  Gas losses  due  to  pipeline \nleakage  are  a  major  safety  hazard  in  addition  to  a  colossal  loss  of  revenue,  because  the \ntransmission  and  distribution  pipelines  have  severe  corrosion  problems  and  need  to  be  partly \nreplaced or repaired to eliminate leak. A cathodic protection system needs to be installed for the \nburied pipelines to safeguard against corrosion. The pipeline capacity has been reduced as a lot \nof  condensate  has  accumulated  due  to  lack  of  dew  point  depression.  Therefore,  pigging \nfacilities need to be installed to clean the pipelines internally. \n \nC. \n\nComponents and Output \n\nThe project component comprises (i) provision for two mobile rigs to carry out work over \n8. \nactivities for 12 gas wells; (ii) provision for two complete well wire line units to carry out down-\nhole  flow  tests,;(iii)  supply  and  installation  of  one  skid-mounted  gas  sweetening  plant;  (iv)  two \ncontainerized gas production testing laboratories; (v) repair and reconstruction of corroded gas \nfacilities  and  condensate  disposal \ntransmission \narrangements;  (vi)  repair  and  reconstruction  of  corroded  gas  distribution  lines  including \ninstallation  of  city  gate  stations;  (vii)  cathodic  protection  system  for  corrosion  mitigation  of \n\ninstallation  of  pigging \n\nincluding \n\nlines \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9. \nA5.1.  \n \n\n \n\n Item \n \n \n\n36\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\ntransmission  and  distribution  pipelines;  (viii)  chemicals,  tools,  equipment,  spare  parts, \ninstrumentation,  piping  and  assemblies,  and  vehicles;  (ix)  consulting  services  for  design, \nengineering, project management, and construction supervision; (x) contracting services for gas \nwells rehabilitation, and repairs and reconstruction of gas transmission and distribution facilities; \nand (xi) institutional strengthening and training of Afghan Gas. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nThe total cost of this component is estimated at $24.07 million as summarized in Table \n\nTable A5.1: Cost Estimates2 \n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nGas Field Rehabilitation \nTransmission & Distribution Rehabilitation\nEquipment and Materials \nConsulting Services \nTraining \nPhysical and Price Contingencies \nInterest During Grace Period \n\n \n \n\nTotal \n\n8.12 \n5.50 \n4.00 \n0.30 \n0.20 \n1.86 \n1.72 \n \n21.70 \n\n \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n8.85 \n6.50 \n4.00 \n0.35 \n0.40 \n2.06 \n1.91 \n \n24.07 \n\n0.73 \n1.00 \n0.00 \n0.05 \n0.20 \n0.20 \n0.19 \n \n2.37 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nE.  \n \n10. \nThe Ministry of Mines and Industries (MMI) will be the implementing agency (IA) for the \npower component of the project.

\n\nSocial Screening Framework  \n\nThe  Emergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Project  involves \n1. \nreconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  key  infrastructure  in  transport  and  energy  sectors:  (i) \nrehabilitation  of  the  471  km  of  the  national  road  network  (Pule  Khumri  -  Mazar  Sharif  - \nSheberghan  \u2013  Andkhoy  section  of  the  ring  road)  including  the  international  link  to  Uzbekistan \n(Naibabad  \u2013  Hairatan  section);  (ii)  power  infrastructure  component  \u2014  urgently  needed \nreconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  transmission  lines  in  the  northern  provinces  and  Kabul \ndistribution  system;  and  (iii)  gas  infrastructure  component  \u2013  urgently  needed  repairs  and \nrehabilitation  of  gas  production,  transmission  and  distribution  facilities.  The  poverty  and  social \nanalysis has been prepared following the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Handbook for Poverty and \nSocial Analysis (2001).  \n \n2. \nThis Social Screening Framework was prepared for the Project as required under ADB\u2019s \nsocial  safeguard  policy.  The  Framework  outlines  the  policy  and  procedures  for  preparation  of \nproject components, which require mitigation measures in particular related to land acquisition. \nThe  implementing  agencies  (IA\u2019s)  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  social  screening  plans \n(SSP\u2019s) for subprojects as outlined in this framework and will submit the same to the Executing \nAgency (EA) and ADB for review and approval.   \n \nB. \n \nADB  policy  requires  (i)  preparation  of  social  assessment;  (ii)  avoiding  or  minimizing \n3. \nimpacts  where  possible;    (iii)  consultation  with  beneficiaries  and  affected  people  in  project \nplanning and implementation, including disclosure of Project-related information; (iv) payment of \ncompensation  for  acquired  assets  at  the  market/replacement  value;  (v)  assistance  to  affected \npeople,  including  nontitled  persons  (e.g.,  informal  dwellers/squatters,  and  encroachers);  (vi) \nspecial attention to vulnerable people and groups; and (vii) income restoration and rehabilitation \nprogram  according  to  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (mcmxcv)  and  Indigenous \nPeople (mcmxcviii), as amended from time to time.   \n  \nC. \n \n4. \nThe  SSP  for  each  component  will  be  prepared  as  follows:  The  IA  concerned  with  the \nassistance  of  the  consultant  for  the  road  component  will  carry  out  social  impact  assessment \nsurveys  for  identified  project  components,  based  on  preliminary  technical  designs;  in  case  of \nadverse  impact  on  affected  persons,  IA\u2019s  will  prepare  an  SSP  for  each  component,  with  the \nassistance of the screening and monitoring consultant, for submission to ADB.  \n \n5. \nThe EA will ensure that the consultant responsible for resettlement plan (RP) preparation \nis aware of the framework and procedures for social assessment and resettlement planning so \nthat  appropriate  entitlements  and  mitigation  measures  are  established  in  the  RP.  The  EA  and \nIA\u2019s  will  further  ensure  that  resettlement  budgets  are  delivered  on  time  to  the  local  office  for \ntimely  RP  implementation.  The  consultants  will  assist  the  IA\u2019s  in  the  following:  (i)  conducting \ncensus,  socioeconomic  survey,  and  asset  inventory  work  to  identify  impacts  and  options;  (ii) \npreparing  an  entitlement  matrix;  (iii)  conducting  consultation  and  participation  procedures  with \nall  stakeholders,  especially  the  people  affected  by  planning  and  management;  (iv)  preparing \nspecific  measures  to  improve  the  status  and  incomes  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups;  (v) \nimplementation  schedules;  (vi)  making  management \npreparing  a  detailed  budget  and \n\nProcedures for Preparing Social Screening Plans  \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n      Appendix 10  \n\n45\n\nConsultation and Disclosure \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities  \n\narrangements;  and  (vii)  preparing  arrangements  for  internal  and  independent  monitoring  and \nevaluation. \n \nD. \n \n6. \nFor  subprojects  that  require  a  SSP,  the  EA  will  have  overall  coordination,  planning, \nimplementation,  and  financing  responsibilities.  An  IA  staff  member  will  be  appointed  as  social \ndevelopment  officer  to  supervise  the  implementation  work.  The  EA  will  ensure  that  the  IA \nresponsible for SSP preparation for subprojects is aware of the framework and procedures for \nSSP planning so that appropriate mitigation measures are established in the SSP. \n \nE. \n \n7. \nConsultation and disclosure requirements will be simplified, taking into consideration the \nuncertain security situation. Each SSP will be prepared and implemented in close consultation \nwith the stakeholders, particularly with the Project-affected people. The SSP will be discussed \nduring meetings at the village/community level.  \n \nF. \n \nThe EA will establish a quarterly monitoring system involving itself and the IA\u2019s and will \n8. \nprepare  progress  reports  on  all  aspects  of  land  acquisition  and  social  development  activities. \nThe screening and monitoring consultants will monitor the implementation of the SSP\u2019s and will \nreport  to  ADB  on  the  progress  of  SSP  implementation  in  quarterly  progress  reports,  including \nfulfillment of the safeguard measures.  \n \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n\f46\n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \nYes \n\n \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY \n \nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nNo PPA \nyet \n\n \nSector identified as a National Priority \nin Country Poverty Partnership \nAgreement?   \n\nA. \n \nSector identified as a National Priority in \nCountry Poverty Analysis?   \n \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Afghanistan. \n \nMuch  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  infrastructure  was  destroyed  and  damaged  during  20  years  of  war.  War  also \nprevented  new  investments  from  taking  place.  Reestablishing  and  restoring  essential  infrastructure, \nparticularly  the  road  network  and  power  and  gas  supplies  is  critical  for  the  revival  and  resumption  of \neconomic  activities,  which  would  contribute  to  employment  creation,  income  generation,  rehabilitation  of \ndisplaced populations and ex-combatants, improvement of security and stability, inter-ethnic reconciliation, \nand  political  unification  of  the  country.  The  poor,  who  constitute  the  majority  of  Afghan\u2019s  population,  will \nbenefit directly through job opportunities for unskilled and semiskilled laborers during the reconstruction of \ninfrastructure  facilities.  Furthermore,  the  Project  will  also  provide social  and  economic  opportunity  to  the \nbeneficiaries, particularly the poor, that will help to reduce poverty.     \n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  economic  recovery,  diversification  of  activities,  employment  generation, \nhigher  productivity,  improved  per  capita  income,  increased  revenue  generation,  improved  efficiency  and \neffectiveness  of  the  public  sector,  private  sector  development,  environmental  preservation,  and  social \nstability.  Specific  beneficiaries  will  include  the  rural  and  urban  poor,  displaced  populations,  demobilized \ncombatants,  and  women.  Specifically,  the  benefits  will  be  directly  or  indirectly  attributable  to  different \nproject components. Energy development will (i) improve energy \u2013 gas and electricity supply in terms of \nquantity, quality, stability, safety, and environmental impact; (ii) improve household quality of life; (iii) revive \nindustries and establish new ones; (iv) contribute to energy security and self-reliance; (v) promote private \nsector  activities  including  those  owned  and  operated  by  women;  and  (vi)  improve  electricity  supply  to \nKabul,  which  is  the  political  and  economic  hub  of  the  country;  (vii)  make  natural  gas  available  where \ndemand exists and also for stimulating demand for gas away from alternative sources such as fuel wood, \nand  imported  oil;  and  (viii)  make  gas  supply  safe,  avoiding  the  present  problem  of  leakage.  Production \nfrom  manufacturing  industries  will  increase  substantially  due  to  improved  supply  of  power,  oil,  and  gas, \nespecially  in and  around major urban  locations such  as  Kabul, Kunduz,  Mazar  Sharif,  Pule  Khumri,  and \nSheberghan. The output of service establishments will get a boost from the improved energy supply. Tariff \ncollection  will  increase,  improving  the  financial  viability  of  power  and  gas  distribution;  the  Government \nsubsidy can be reduced or eliminated; and revenue from taxes will go up. Indigenous gas will save foreign \nexchange  currently  used  to  import  energy.  Increased  and  secure  power  supply  will  encourage  private \nsector  investments  in  all  sectors,  particularly  manufacturing,  commerce,  and  services.  Improved  power \nsupply will improve the supply of safe water and the quality of health services. Improvement in health care \ndelivery will bring down maternal mortality. The Project will optimize the use of natural gas and curtail the \ndemand for fuel wood, thereby saving forests. \n\nRoad  transport  development  will  (i)  improve  the  national  road  network;  (ii)  improve  the  maintenance  of \nroads; (iii) facilitate the movement of humanitarian aid through the northern corridor; (iv) reduce the cost of \ntransportation; (v) promote international and regional trade; (vi) increase the income of vulnerable groups \nin rural and urban areas; (vii) build up the capacity of local contractors for construction, rehabilitation, and \nmaintenance of major roads and bridges; and (viii) promote environmental preservation. Production from \nmanufacturing industries\u2014small, medium, and large\u2014will increase substantially due to improved supply of \nmachinery, equipment, and materials and to better marketing prospects. Toll collection will increase, and \nGovernment tax revenue will go up from income, corporate, and trade taxes.  Road rehabilitation and  \n\n\f           \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n      Appendix 11 \n\n47\n\n \n\nreconstruction  will  open  up  a  wide  range  of  opportunities  for  the  private  sector  involved  in  road \nconstruction, production, trade, transport, and services. Rehabilitated roads will improve the supply of and \naccess  to  health  services.  The  road  component  will  assist  some  of  the  most  vulnerable  groups  in  the \ncountry in their repatriation, resettlement, and reintegration within their communities; provide livelihood and \ndevelop  the  capacity  and  skills  that  provide  sustainability.  Women's  welfare  will  be  promoted  through \nimproved  availability  and  access  to  social  services,  including  education  and  health.  Private  sector \ndevelopment will open up opportunities for women entrepreneurs.  \n\nPoverty Analysis                                              Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \n\n \nB. \n \nAfghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, with an estimated 2002 population of 27.8 million. \nPoverty  has  worsened  over  the  past  two  decades,  with  an  estimated  60\u201380%  of  the  population  living \nbelow the threshold of $1 a day1 or consuming below the Food and Agriculture Organization requirement \nof  2,453  kilocalories;  70%  of  the  Afghan  population  is  malnourished,  and  only  13%  have  access  to \nimproved  water  resources.  Six  million  Afghans  are  vulnerable,  include  small  farmers,  landless  laborers, \nex-combatants, war widows, war orphans, debtors, sharecroppers, returning refugees, internally displaced \npersons (1.1 million), the abandoned, and the disabled (800,000, of whom 200,000 are mine victims) \u2013 in \nneed of basic food items, medical supplies, clean drinking water, etc. Nonmaterial poverty as reflected in \nphysical  and  social  insecurity;  isolation;  marginalization;  alienation;  and  ethnic,  religious,  and  gender \ndiscrimination further pushes many Afghanis deeper down the poverty ladder.2 \n \nTwo  decades  of  war  have  prevented  any  progress  that  might  otherwise  have  occurred,  and  on  the \ncontrary have made the situation worse. In 1996, Afghanistan ranked 169th (of 174 countries) in the UN \nHuman Development Index. Access to education in Afghanistan is limited, and the quality of the education \nis very poor. The primary gross enrolment rate has been most recently estimated at 39% for boys and 3% \nfor girls. The situation in health is equally grim. According to the World Bank report (2002),3 infant mortality \nis estimated to be one of the highest in the world at around 165 per 1,000 live births, while 257 of every \n1,000 live births die before they are five. The maternal mortality rate is estimated to be 1,700 per 100,000 \nlive births, and life expectancy at birth is estimated at around 41 years of age.  \n \nAfghanistan's economy was traditionally based mainly on agriculture and animal husbandry. Most recently, \nAfghanistan  has  been  hit  by  a  severe,  protracted  drought  that  started  in  1999  and  has  lasted  until  the \npresent. Crop production has been halved, and livestock herds are heavily depleted. Large and increasing \nnumbers of people have lost their means of livelihood. The impact of the drought, which would have been \nserious  under  any  circumstances,  has  been  aggravated  by  the  run-down  condition  of  irrigation  systems \nand  other  agricultural  infrastructure.  An  estimated  4.3  million  people  will  be  facing  food  deficits  in  2003 \nuntil the next harvest.4 \n \nBy  the  mid-1990s  most  of  the  country\u2019s  limited  modern  infrastructure  \u2013  roads,  bridges,  irrigation, \ntelecommunications, and electricity \u2013 had been damaged and destroyed, and traditional irrigation systems \nsuffered greatly from destruction and lack of maintenance. This is particularly true for major national roads, \nand  power  generation,  transmission  and  distribution  infrastructure,  and  natural  gas  production  and \ndistribution infrastructure. In sum, Afghanistan's economic structure has been greatly weakened, distorted, \nand made more vulnerable through two decades of conflict and 4 years of drought.  While no systematic \npoverty study is available, poverty is associated with low economic growth and the collapse of employment \nopportunities due to a long period of war.  \n\n                                                 \n1 Reliable data on poverty indicators are not available.

Community  consultation  will  be \ncarried  out  to  determine  selection  priority  including  engineering  solutions  to  exclude  all  resettlement \nimpacts.  Based on the technical requirements, opportunities for local communities, in particular displaced \npopulations and ex-combatants, to work on the civil works such as earthworks will be incorporated. \n \n \nC. \n  \n\nPotential Issues \n \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nSignificant/ \nNot \nSignificant/ \nUncertain/ \nNone \n\n \n\nResettlement  \n\nNone \n\n \n  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nGender  \n \n \n\nNone \n\nAffordability  \n\nNot \nsignificant \n\nLabor \n\nNot \nsignificant \n\nIndigenous \nPeople \n\nNone \n\nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n\nNone \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Project will not involve any land acquisition. The \nreconstruction and rehabilitation of infrastructure facilities \nwill occur on existing rights-of-way only. The works will be \ndesigned, using engineering solutions, to ensure that \nreconstruction and rehabilitation will be within the existing \nrights-of-way. \n  Earthworks are a significant component of the civil works.  \nThe implementing agency of the road component will \nensure that women and men are given equal opportunities \nfor employment on the Project. Contractors will be \nrequired to ensure equal payment for equal work. These \nactions will be monitored by the supervision consultant. \nThe Project will have positive impact in reducing transport \ncost and the impact of improved infrastructure facilities, \nparticularly electricity, on the affordability of consumers \nwill be monitored. \nEmployment opportunities within the Project will be \navailable on an equal basis to all, on the basis of \nprofessional competence, irrespective of gender, or ethnic \nor religious groups. \nNo indigenous people and communities will be negatively \naffected by the Project.   \n\nThe capacity of implementing agencies to address social \ndimensions, particularly social safeguard policies, is very \ninadequate. A cluster Technical Assistance for Capacity \nBuilding for Reconstruction and Development for \nAfghanistan was approved in 2002.  One of its \ncomponents is to strengthen key infrastructure agencies in \nensuring social safeguard policies and incorporating social \ndimensions in the development of transport and energy \nsector projects.  \n\n \nPlan \nRequired \n\nNone \n\nA specific \nclause will \nbe included \nin the \nbidding \ndocuments \nNone \n\nNone \n\nNone \n\nNone \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        Appendix 12 \n\n49\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n \n \n1. \nA preliminary economic analysis of the three components of the Project has been carried \nout.  The  findings  and  assumptions,  summarized  in  the  following  paragraphs,  suggest  that \ninvestment in road and energy infrastructure is economically justified. However, the encouraging \nresults are predicated upon certain assumptions regarding achievement of sector restructuring \nand  policy  reforms  as  anticipated  under  the  Postconflict  Multisector  Program  Loan  leading  to \nimprovement  of  operational  and  administrative  efficiency  that  will,  among  others,  call  for \nstreamlining  of  tariff  structure,  accounting,  billing  and  revenue  collection,  as  appropriate. \nAdequate  resources  will  be  needed  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  assets \nrehabilitated under the Project.   \n \nA. \n\nRoad Infrastructure \n\n \n\n2. \nAn  economic  evaluation  of  the  road  rehabilitation  component  of  the  Project  has  been \ncarried  out  that  weighs  the  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs)  and  travel  time  costs \ngained by the Project against the initial investment costs and the savings in future periodic and \nroutine maintenance costs over a 20-year period. In carrying out this evaluation, a maintenance \nstrategy was adopted in the base case (without Project) scenario that assumed minimal periodic \nmaintenance  would  be  carried  out.  This  reflects  the  current  situation.  Base  year  (2003)  daily \ntraffic  data  collected  through  24-hour  traffic  counts  on  selected  links  show  a  vehicle  count  of \n1505 for Pule Khumri to Naibabad Junction, 1716 for Naibabad Junction to Hairatan, 2819 for \nNaibabad  Junction  to  Mazar  Sharif,  2049  for  Mazar  Sharif  to  Sheberghan,  and  639  for \nSheberghan  to  Andkhoy.  Traffic  growth  rates  over  the  evaluation  period  were  taken  to  match \n(Asian Development Bank) staff\u2019s estimates of Gross Domestic Product growth.1 \n \nVOCs and travel time costs were calculated for seven types of vehicles2 using Highway \n3. \nDesign  Model  roughness  \u2013  VOC  and  roughness  \u2013  speed  relationships.  Based  on  various \nassumptions  regarding  occupancy,  value  of  time  per  car  is  estimated  at  $0.38  plus  $0.13  per \npassenger,  going  up  to  $0.50  per  truck  plus  $0.25  per  passenger  (excluding  crew  members, \nwhose  time  is  valued  in  VOC).  These  values  are  derived  from  the  average  wage  required  to \nmeet  minimum  food  requirements  for  bus  passengers  and  a  premium  over  it  for  truck \npassengers. No allowance is made for nonwork-related travel. All calculations are done on the \nbasis  of  normal  traffic,  (projected  traffic  that  will  occur  both  without  or  with  the  Project), \nexcluding generated traffic which makes estimated economic returns on the conservative side. \nLack  of  data  did  not  permit  consideration  of  accident  cost  savings,  thereby  further \nunderestimating benefits.     \n \n4. \nA  factor  of  0.9  was  used  to  convert  financial  construction  and  maintenance  costs  to \neconomic  costs.  The  economic  evaluation3  indicates  that  the  overall  Project  is  economically \nviable, with an (Economic Internal Rate of Return) of 31.5% and a net present value (NPV) of \n$167.5 million. Table A12.1 shows the EIRR and NPV of the project road, as well as its various \nsections. \n\n                                                 \n1   9.7% (2003), 9.7% (2004), 7.8% (2005), 6.4% (2006 -2010), 5.4% (2011 - 2015), and 5.0% (2016 - 2025). \n2  Car,  PU/4WD,  minibus,  large  bus,  medium  truck,  and  heavy  truck  with  distribution  being  11.4%,  17.2%,  47.8%, \n\n6.6%, 5.1%, and 11.9% obtained from traffic survey. \n\n3   Contribution of travel-time savings to the benefit stream is less than 10%. \n\n\f50\n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nTable A12.1: Economic Analysis - Road Component \n \n\n \nRoad Link \n\nPule Khumri to Naubabad Junction \nNaibabag Junction to Hairatan \n\nNaibabad Junction to Mazar Sharif  \n\nMazar Sharif to Sheberghan \n\nSheberghan to Andkhoy \n\nTotal Project \n\n \nEIRR (%) \n23.9 \n41.5 \n\n49.9 \n\n35.8 \n\n19.2 \n\n31.5 \n\n \nNPV ($ million) \n\n24.6 \n20.7 \n\n27.9 \n\n84.6 \n\n 9.7  \n\n         167.5 \n\n \n5. \nSensitivity tests were carried out to investigate the robustness of the economic viability \nof the project component to cost overrun and reduction in benefits. The results of the sensitivity \ntests  carried  out  on  the  total  project  component  comprising  all  road  links  are  summarized  in \nTable  A12.2.  Sensitivity  was  also  tested  by  decreasing  benefits  by  20  percent  and  increasing \ncosts by 20 percent and both. These sensitivity tests demonstrate that the overall Project is very \nrobust to variations in construction cost and benefits. Similarly reduction of traffic growth rates \nby 25 percent and 50 percent reduces EIRR to 29 percent and 26.5 percent respectively. These \nsensitivity  tests  demonstrate  that  the  overall  Project  component  is  very  robust  to  increase  in \nconstruction cost, implementation delays and reduction in traffic growth. \n\nTable A12.2: Sensitivity Analysis - Road Component \n\n \n\nSensitivity Test \n\nBase Case \nBenefits Decreased by 20% \n\nInitial Construction Costs Increased by 20% \nBenefits Decreased by 20% and Initial Construction Costs \nincreased by 20% \n\nEIRR  \n(%) \n\nNPV \n($ million)\n\n31.5 \n26.5 \n\n27.0 \n\n23.5 \n\n167.5 \n122.7 \n\n156.0 \n\n110.2 \n\nB. \n\n \nPower Infrastructure \n \nThe  DABM  is  (DABM)  quasi-government  enterprise  in  the  power  sector,  and  is \n6. \nresponsible  for  O  &  M,  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  power  infrastructure.  DABM  is  responsible  for  about \n80%  of  the  country\u2019s  electricity  production,  with  the  Ministry  of  Mines  and  Industry  accounting \nfor  the  balance.  System  (technical  and  nontechnical)  losses  are  estimated  at  45%  in  the \ndistribution system, and another 46% is estimated as commercial loss. \n \n7. \nThe  economic  analysis  of  power  import  options  was  carried  out  excluding  revenues. \nBenefits attributed to the project were shares of the ADB\u2019s growth projections (low case) for the \nmanufacturing  and  trade  sectors.  These  \u201cenergy-dependent\u201d  shares  consist  of  25%  projected \ngrowth  to  2015  and  10%  thereafter  for  the  remainder  of  the  20-year  operating  period  under \nassessment.  The  economic  evaluation  indicates  that  the  overall  project  component  is \neconomically  viable,  with  an  EIRR  of  32.2%  and  a  NPV  of $414  million.  Sensitivity tests  were \ncarried  out  to  investigate  the  robustness  of  the  project  component  to  variations  in  the  initial \nconstruction  cost,  resulting  cost  overrun,  and  variations  in  revenue  benefits  resulting  from \nreduced collection and/or leakage in transmission and distribution.  The results of the sensitivity \ntests carried out on the entire project component, summarized in Table A12.3, demonstrate that \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        Appendix 12 \n\n51\n\nthe overall project component is very robust to variations in costs and benefits. A combined cost \nescalation of 20% and benefit reduction of 20% results in a decline of EIRR to 22.8%, still well \nwithin the acceptable range.  \n\nTable A12. 3: Sensitivity Analysis - Power Component \n\nSensitivity Test \n \n\nEIRR (%) \n\nNPV \n($ million) \n\nBase Case  \n\nBenefits Decreased by 20% \n\nCosts Increased by 20% \n\n32.2 \n\n26.8 \n\n27.8 \n\n22.8 \n\n414.2 \n\n278.0 \n\n360.9 \n\n224.7 \n\nBenefits  Decreased  by  20%  and  Costs  Increased \nby 20% \n\nGas Infrastructure \n\n \nC. \n \n8. \nThe economic analysis for the gas component was calculated on the basis of estimated \ncapital costs of $20.1 million divided equally between production and transmission. O&M costs \nare  assumed  to  be  5%  of  total  capital  costs.  Rehabilitation  of  existing  pipeline  and  production \nwells appears to be the least-cost option compared with the drilling of new wells and/or building \nnew  pipeline.  The  economic  benefits  of  rehabilitating  transmission  and  distribution  facilities \nconsist  of  revenues  from  the  sale  of  an  additional  320,000  cubic  meters  per  day.  Additional \nsupply is attributed to 250,000 cubic meters savings from losses and 70,000 cubic meters from \nnew  production.  Revenue  has  been  calculated  at  current  tariff  averages  of  $12.13  per  1,000 \ncubic  meters.  End  consumer  tariff  is  $10.87  for  the  fertilizer  factory,  $16.74  for  power  plants, \n$22.83 for commercial clients, and $16.74 for domestic users. Prices are for 1,000 cubic meters. \nCollection  rates  are  poor  now.  Future  collection  rates  are  put  at  75%  for  the  fertilizer  plant, \npower plants, and commercial clients, and 50% for domestic users, giving an average collection \nrate of 69.1%. It is assumed that gas has to be supplied over 300 operating days a year, taking \ninto account breakdown, shutdown of the fertilizer factory, and other consumers. \n \nThe  economic  evaluation  indicates  that  the  overall  project  component  is  economically \n9. \nviable, with an EIRR of 34.7% and a NPV of $34.1 million. Sensitivity tests were carried out to \ninvestigate  the  robustness  of  the  gas  component  of  the  Project  to  variations  in  the  initial \nconstruction  cost  resulting  cost  overrun  and  variations  in  revenue  benefits  resulting  from \nreduced collection and/or leakage in transmission and distribution. The results, summarized in \nTable A12.4, indicate that the overall project component is very robust to variations in costs and \nbenefits. A combined cost escalation of 20% and benefit reduction of 20% results in a decline of \nEIRR to 23.4% and NPV to $18.4 million, both still high compared with alternatives. \n \n\nTable A12.4: Sensitivity Analysis - Gas Component \n\nSensitivity Test \n\nBase Case \nBenefits Decreased by 20% \n\nInitial Construction Costs Increased by 20% \nBenefits Decreased by 20% and Initial Construction Costs \nIncreased by 20% \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n\n34.7 \n28.1 \n\n29.3 \n\n23.4 \n\nNPV \n($ million)\n\n34.1 \n22.8 \n\n29.7 \n\n18.4 \n\n\f52\n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nPower Infrastructure \n\n \n \n1. \nFor the purpose of working out the financial internal rates of return (FIRRs), the Project \nhas been divided and individually analyzed into two segments: (i) gas sector rehabilitation, and \n(ii) power sector rehabilitation. The assumptions for the different segments are discussed in the \nfollowing paragraphs. The rate of exchange has been assumed as $1.00 = Afs46. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nBased  on  available  information,  the  power  supply  is  weak  regarding  reliable  power \ngeneration  as  well  as  having  damaged  transmission  and  distribution  systems.  The  technical \nlosses  in  transmission  are  estimated  at  5%  and  20%  in  the  Kabul  distribution  system  at  20%. \nDue to the lack of a sufficient number of meters and of efficient administration for meter reading \nand  billing,  the  nontechnical  losses  are  currently  estimated  at  20%,  making  the  total  system \nlosses  in  the  distribution  system  as  high  as  45%.  Collection  efficiency  is  also  extremely  poor, \n54%.  The  collection/generation  ratio  for  Kabul  is  estimated  at  around  30%  only.  Restructuring \nand  training  efforts  are  essential  to  reduce  the  losses  and  thus  the  heavy  burden  on  the \ngovernment  budget.  These  efforts  have  to  be  carried  out  simultaneously  with  a  review  of  the \ncurrent tariff structure to be able to achieve financial sustainability in the sector. \n \n3. \nThe  financial  evaluation  of  the  Project  was  carried  out  in  real  terms  and  on  an \nincremental basis by comparing \u201cwith Project\u201d and \u201cwithout Project\u201d scenarios. The assumptions \nwere as follows: \n \n\nIn the base case, the revenues were calculated at the current average tariff, 2.4 \nUS cents/kilowatt-hour (kWh) \n\nThe average generation cost, 0.9 US cents/kWh is based on hydropower at 0.5 \nUS  cents/kWh  and,  during  the  four  winter  months  (6  hours/day),  gas  turbine \ngeneration at 13 US cents/kWh as additional supply. \n\nBased  on  the  project  investments,  the  technical  and  nontechnical  losses  in  the \nKabul  distribution  system  are  expected  to  be  reduced  from  the  current  45%  to \n30%. \n\nOperational,  maintenance,  and  administration  costs  are  estimated  at  5%  of  the \ninvested capital. \n\nIn  achieving  the  estimated  benefits,  (a)  investments  funded  by  the  World  Bank, \nKreditanstalt  f\u1ee7r  Wiederaufbau,  and  the  European  Commission;  (b) investments \nin  the  northern  distribution  system;  and  (c)  investments  in  the  remaining \ntransmission link to Kabul are included in the capital cost (8, 20, 5 and 20 million \nUS$, respectively). \n\n \n4. \nBased  on  existing  tariffs,  limited  technical  resources,  as  well  as  lack  of  accurate \nadministration, DABM is currently not financially viable. To make this project component viable \nand at the same time bring DABM back to financial sustainability without heavy subsidies from \nthe government budget, major restructuring efforts are needed. To reflect possible opportunities, \ntwo scenarios have been analyzed aside from the above presented base case: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n53\n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nFinancial  recovery  is  achieved  solely  through  improved  system  losses  in \ndistribution  (from  45%  to  30%,  equivalent  to  an  expected  collection/generation \nratio  of  38%  compared  with  the  current  30%)  derived  from  the  Project  and \nincreased tariffs from current average 2.4 US cents/kWh to 7.3 US cents/kWh to \nattain 15% FIRR for this Project. \n\nIn attaining the same FIRR, 15%, the second scenario assumes major efforts in \nimproving the administration of meter reading, billing, and collection to avoid too \nsteep tariff increases. If the commercial losses can be brought down to 40% from \nthe  currently  estimated  at  46%  (equivalent  to  a  collection/generation  ratio  of \n42%), the average tariff needed will instead be 6.5 US cents/kWh.  \n\nGas Infrastructure \n\n \n \nB. \n \n5. \nBased on available information, the gas supply is in very poor condition regarding both \nthe  gas  fields  and  the  transmission/distribution  systems.  The  physical  losses  are  estimated  at \n30%,  mainly  due  to  leaks  in  the  transmission  and  distribution  systems.  Based  on  almost \nnonexisting  collection,  Afghan  Gas  is  currently  not  a  financially  viable  company.  Major \nrestructuring efforts are needed regarding operation; administration including accounting, billing, \nand  revenue  collection;  as  well  as  review  of  the  current  tariff  structure  to  be  able  to  bring  the \nfinancial performance back to profitability. \n \n6. \npart of the country as presented in Table A13.1. \n \nTable A13.1: Gas Consumption and  Tariffs \n\nThe  supply  as  well  as  the  major  customer  groups  are  currently  located  in  the  northern \n\nCurrent Supply \n\nImmediate Demand \n\nGas Supply (CM/day) \nFertilizer Plants \nPower Plants \nCommercial \nDomestic \nLosses \n     Total \n\nEnd Consumer Tariffs \nFertilizer Plants \nPower Plants \nCommercial \nDomestic \n     Average Tariff \n\n               300,000  \n                 60,000  \n               100,000  \n               120,000  \n               250,000  \n               830,000  \n\n                     500  \n                     770  \n                  1,050  \n                     770  \n                     557  \n\n            440,000  \n              60,000  \n            200,000  \n            200,000  \n                     -    \n            900,000  \n\n                  10.87  \n                  16.74  \n                  22.83  \n                  16.74  \n                  12.13  \n\nAfs/1000cm \n\nUSD/1000CM \n\n \n7. \nThe  financial  evaluation  of  the  Project  was  carried  out  in  real  terms  and  on  an \nincremental  basis  by  comparing  the  \u201cwith  Project\u201d  and  \u201cwithout  Project\u201d  scenarios.  The \nassumptions were as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\nRevenue  was  calculated  at  current  rates  and  volumes  as  presented  by  Afghan \nGas. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54\n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n(ii) \n\nCollection  rates  are  based  on  the  assumption  of  restructured  Afghan  Gas,  fully \ncapable of metering, billing, and collecting (Table A13.2). \n\nTable A13.2: Collection Rate \n\nConsumer \nFertilizer Plants \nPower Plants \nCommercial \nDomestic \n     Total Collected Revenues \n\nCollection (%) \n75 \n75 \n75 \n50 \n     44.1% \n\n \n(iii) \n\nCosts  for  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  gas  fields,  transmission  and \ndistribution  pipelines,  as  well  as  administration,  are  assumed  at  5%  of  the \nestimated project cost. \n\n(iv) \n\nNo transmission and distribution losses were considered. \n\n \n \n8. \nBased  on  existing  tariffs,  limited  technical  resources,  as  well  as  lack  of  accurate \nadministration,  Afghan  Gas  is  currently  not  financially  viable.  To  make  this  project  component \nviable  and  at  the  same  time  bring  Afghan  Gas  back  to  financial  sustainability  without  heavy \nsubsidies  from  the  government  budget,  major  restructuring  efforts  are  needed  to  improve \noperational  efficiency,  reduce  losses,  and  enhance  collection.  However,  the  major  factor  to \nachieve  14.9%  FIRR  is  through  a  3.65  times  increase  in  existing  tariffs,1  which  are  extremely \nlow, heavily subsidized, and unrealistic. \n\nC. \n\nConclusion \n\nBased on the current total losses; technical, nontechnical and commercial in the power \n9. \nsector,  this  component  is  not  financial  viable.  However,  as  this  component  will  have  major \npositive impact on the country\u2019s economy and is urgently needed, it is essential that the above-\nmentioned restructuring measures along with tariff restructuring are implemented. Without these \nmeasures, the Power Sector will continue to be a major burden on government resources.

Though  the  technical  losses  will  be  minimized  through  the  proposed \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  the  facilities,  major  improvements  in  collection  rates  and \ntariff rationalization are required.

The  Project\u2013proposed  enhancement  in  tariff,  reduction  of  technical  and  nontechnical \nlosses, and increase in collection rates are critical for financial sustainability of these institutions. \nTables A13.3 and A13.4 demonstrate that financial viability could be achieved through a variety \nof measures. Major institutional improvements have a key role in achieving these objectives. It \nis recognized that full cost recovery will take time. However, the Government has shown deep \ncommitment  to  pursue  these  efforts  and  has  given  specific  targets  for  achieving  institutional \nimprovements  and  enhancing  cost  recovery  during  the  recently  concluded  Afghanistan \nDevelopment Forum. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56\n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Project  was  classified  as  a  \u201cB\u201d  Project  and,  therefore,  initial  environmental \n1. \nexaminations  (IEEs)  for  all  sample  project  components  (viz.,  rehabilitation  of  road,  and  power \ndistribution line, gas transmission pipeline) were undertaken.

The  topography  is  mostly  plain,  and  rolling  in  a  few \nsections while the section connecting Pule-Khumri to Naubabad passes hilly terrain. Land use \nalong  the  road  is  mainly  rangeland,  agricultural  land  (e.g.,  orchards  and  irrigated  agriculture), \nand residential area. The road crosses two rivers (Pule-Khumri and Jasmesher Spring), which \nhave water only during the spring and early summer seasons, and are dry during the remaining \nseasons.  No  lakes  or  ponds  are  located  in  the  corridor  of  this  road.  There  is  no  ecologically \nsensitive area along the road corridor. \n    \n4. \nThe  topography  of  the  corridor  area  of  road  connecting  Naibabad  \u2013  Mazar  Sharif  \u2013 \nSheberghan - Andkhoy (203 km) is mostly plain. The road passes mainly desert, rangeland, and \nresidential areas. Two rivers (Tanji Tajkargaon and Puleackcha) are crossed by this road. They \nare  filled  by  water  only  during  the  spring  and  early  summer  seasons.  No  lakes  or  ponds  are \nfound in the corridor of this road. No ecologically sensitive area is involved in this project area. \n \n5. \nThe project roads runs through 71 villages. The population densities are very low. In the \nentire  project  area,  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities  do  not  exist.  Energy  supply  is  mostly \nfrom firewood, crop residues, and animal wastes.  \n\n \n\nProject Area Affected by Power Distribution and Transmission Component \n\n2. \n \n6. \nKabul and its surroundings are the main area of the power distribution component. The \narea  is  one  of  the  busiest  cities  in  Afghanistan.  The  existing  environmental  problems  are \ndominated  by  problems  related  to  domestic  activities  and  the  traffic  sector.  The  existing \ndistribution  line  still  has  very  good  concentric  concrete  poles.  The  facility  in  the  substation  is \nbadly  damaged.  The  area  is  mainly  residential  area,  and  no  environmentally  sensitive  area  is \ninvolved.  \n \n\n3.  Project Area Affected by Gas Component \n\nPotential Impact and Mitigation Measures \n\n \n7. \nThe existing gas pipeline covers mainly the area from the border of Uzbekistan, passing \nthrough  Amu  Darya  and  Sheberghan,  and  ending  in  Mazar  Sharif.  The  topography  along  the \npipeline  is  mainly  plain.  The  project  area  is  mostly  irrigated.  Land  use  along  the  pipeline  is \nmainly  agricultural  (vineyards,  orchards,  and  gardens).  Neither  the  existing  protected  area  nor \nthe proposed protected area is located in the project area. \n \nD. \n \n \n \nThere  will  be  no  significant  environmental  impact  due  to  siting  of  these  project  roads, \n8. \nbecause the Project will be executed only on existing roads and none of them are located in an \nenvironmentally  sensitive  area.  The  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  construction \nstage will include (i) disruption of traffic in the construction area, (ii) increased air pollution due \nto increasing dust and other volatile chemical substances from the asphalt plant, (iii) noise and \nvibration, (iv) disruption of the water system due to cut and filling and other earthworks, and (v) \npotential landslides associated with elevating some parts of the road. These impacts will occur \n\nRoad Component \n\n1.  \n\n \n\n\f58\n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nonly  during  the  construction  period.  However,  mitigation  measures  to  minimize  them  will  be \nadopted  including:  (i)  rerouting  traffic  with  clear  signs;  (ii)  maintaining  the  optimum  moisture \ncontent during handling of soil, spraying water to minimize dust, and maintaining a safe distance \nbetween the asphalt plant and public facilities, including educational facilities; (iii) strictly control \nthe construction works that create noise and vibration by prohibiting night work in the residential \nareas; (iv) pumping out of stagnant water, and providing an  adequate drainage system; and (v) \nstabilizing road embankment side slopes, and rehabilitating bridges only in the dry season. All \nthese  mitigation  measures/requirements  will  be included in  the  bidding/contract  documents  for \nthe  contractor.  All  these  impacts  are  temporary  and  manageable.  The  environmental  impact \nassociated with the operation of the Project is mainly on traffic safety; therefore, adequate traffic \nsigns  and  physical  barriers  to  reduce  motorists\u2019  speed  will  be  adopted.  The  other  important \nenvironmental impact that will not concentrate in the road areas is the borrow pit excavation. In \nthis context, strict borrow pit operation will be adopted (i.e., no borrow pits in fertile agriculture \nlands  and  area  prone  to  erosion  and  landslides,  restoration  and  rehabilitation  of  ex-borrow  pit \nareas). \n \n2.  \n\nPower Distribution and Transmission Component \n\n \n\nthat \n\nimpacts \n\nidentifies \n\nThe  screening  of  potential \n\n9. \nthere  will  be  no  significant \nenvironmental impact due to siting of these distribution lines and substation, because the project \nactivities will be executed only at the existing facilities and along the road in Kabul. The potential \nenvironmental  impacts  associated  with  the  construction  stage  will  involve  mostly  traffic \ndisturbance and accidents due to electric shock. To minimize this impact a clear traffic sign will \nbe  placed  in  the  construction  area  and,  if  necessary,  traffic  will  be  rerouted.  Best  practices \nduring  the  installation  of  cable  or  distribution  lines  will  be  adopted  and  will  be  included  in  the \nbidding/contract  documents  to  minimize  electric  shock  problems.  Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  the \nimpacts  associated  with  the  rehabilitation  of  distribution  lines  will  be  very  minimal  and  the \nmitigation  measures  are  manageable.  No  environmental  impacts  will  be  associated  with  the \nrehabilitation  of  the  substation,  particularly  related  to  disposal  of  damaged  equipment  (e.g., \ntransformer,  conductors).  This  project  component  will  not  involve  replacement  of  transformers \nand conductors, and will focus on providing new transformers to replace the missing parts. To \navoid  future  environmental  problems,  it  is  also  recommended  that  this  project  component  use \n(ii) \nonly \nchlorofluorocarbon\u2013free  cooling  equipment.  To  avoid  noise  problems,  it  is  recommended  to \nlocate  the  transformers  so  that  noise  levels  from  the  fence  will  not  exceed  55  decibels  (db) \nduring daytime and 45 dB at night. It is clear that the proposed mitigation measures are practical \nand  manageable,  and  all  will  be  included  in  the  bidding  documents.  The  transmission  line \ncomponent will focus only on replacing the missing line and fixing the existing line; therefore, no \nsignificant impact is expected due to its siting due to construction work or operation. However, \nthe establishment of temporary access roads to reach the transmission towers, and mobilizing \nthe construction material and equipment will cause temporary impacts such as increased dust \nand  traffic  disturbance. Mitigation  measures,  including  watering  the  road  and  rehabilitating  the \ntemporary  access  road,  will  be  part  of  the  contractor\u2019s  working  requirements  (will  be  included \ninto  the  bidding/contract  document).  Similarly,  the  requirement  to  provide  clear  traffic \ninstructions  in  the  project  area  will  also  be  included  in  the  contractor\u2019s  bidding/contract \ndocuments. \n\ntransformers  and  conductors;  and \n\n(i)  Poly  Chlorinated  Biphenyl\u2013 \n\nfree \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n        Appendix 14 \n\n59\n\n4.  Gas Infrastructure Component \n \n10. \nThere will be no significant impact due to siting of this project component, because it will \nnot require any land for expansion and will not affect any protected area. However, there will be \nsome potential environmental impacts involved due to (i) the use of chemicals (e.g., to clean up \nthe  corrosive  pipeline,  use  for  welding  process);  (ii)  disposal  of  corrosive  equipment,  and  (iii) \ndisposal  of  byproducts  of  the  desulfurification  process.  All  of  these  impacts  will  affect  the \ndownstream area, which is mostly agriculture land. Any chemical contamination into the shallow \nand  deep  groundwater  will  pollute  the  irrigation  water,  the  residues  of  these  chemical \nsubstances will be found in the agricultural products. The following mitigation measures will be \nemployed:  (i)  a  waste  management  plan  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  for  review  prior  to  executing  any  construction  work;  and  (ii)  all \nhazardous wastes  (corrosive  pipeline  and  other  corrosive  unused  equipment)  will  be  stored  in \nclearly labeled containers and will be kept within the area belong to the Executing Agency. \n \nE. \n  \n1.  \n \n \n \n11. \nImplementation  of  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction  stage  will  be  the \nresponsibility  of  the  contractor.  An  environmental  engineer,  who  will  be  hired  as  part  of  the \nconsultant team for implementing Project, will assist the Implementation Agency (IA) concerned \nin preparing contract documentation so that the bidding documents, bills of quantity, and other \ncontractual  obligations  of  the  contractor  identify  the  contractor\u2019s  environmental  responsibilities \nand  stipulate  penalties  for  noncompliance.  In  addition,  the  consultant  will  also  be  required  to \nassist  the  IA  concerned  in  monitoring  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  management \nplan that was described in the IEE report. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements and Monitoring Plan \n\nRoad Component \n\n \n\n2. \n\nPower Distribution Component \n\n \n\n12. \nImplementation  of  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction  stage  will  be  the \nresponsibility  of  the  contractor.

The gas \ncomponent  will  involve  environmental  impacts  related  to  hazardous  wastes  due  to  unused  or \ndamaged  equipment  that  has  to  be  disposed  of  or  chemical  wastes  due  to  spillage,  leakage, \nand  byproducts.  Therefore,  an  environmental  consultant  will  be  hired  to  assist  in  preparing  a \nwaste  management  plan.
