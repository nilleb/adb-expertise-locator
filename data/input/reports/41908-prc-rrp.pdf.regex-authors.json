I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) an equity \ninvestment of up to $50 million equivalent in HNA Airport Group Company, Limited (HAG), and \n(ii) a loan to HAG consisting of two tranches: A Tranche, for up to CNY1.2 billion, funded by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), and B Tranche, for up to $200 million, funded by commercial \nbanks. The proceeds of the equity investment and loan will be applied for the financing of HAG\u2019s \nairport portfolio in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  The Airport Sector \n1.  Background \n \n2.  With a total area of 9.6 million square kilometers (km2), a population of 1.3 billion, and \ngross domestic product of $2.67 trillion in 2006, the PRC remains the leading emerging market \nin Asia. With a sustained growth rate of 9.5% over the past 26 years, the economy of the PRC \ncontinues to benefit from the comparative advantage of lower labor costs, higher productivity \nlevels and increased ease of global movement of goods and services. The civil aviation industry \nhas  benefited  from  this  growth  through  increased  demand  for  both  cargo  and  passenger \nservices.  The  Government  of  the  PRC  (the  Government)  recognizes  the  importance  of \ninfrastructure as a prerequisite for economic growth, and has focused on the development of \nland, sea and air transport.     \n \n2.  Demand for Air Transportation \n \n3.  The PRC currently has the second largest civil aviation market in the world, after the \nUnited States. In 2006, the General Administration of Civil Aviation of China (CAAC) reported \npassenger  transportation  volume  of  332  million  person-times  and  cargo  and  postal \ntransportation of 7.53 million tons (t), increasing by 16.7% and 19% respectively, over 2005 \nlevels. Average annual passenger growth stood at 22.1%, and average annual cargo traffic \ngrowth at 22.0% over the past decade.  \n \n4.  The  demand  for  travel,  for  both  work  and  leisure,  is  projected  to  increase  at  an \nunprecedented pace as a result of increased labor movement flexibility and disposable income \ngrowth.  It  is  estimated  that  Chinese  air  passenger  transportation  throughput,  measured  in \nrevenue passenger-kilometers (RPK),1 will average 8.4% annually during 2007\u20132026, while the \nPRC\u2019s air cargo transportation turnover, measured in freight ton-kilometers (FTK),2 will increase \nat an annual average of 10.5%.3\n \n3.  Development of Airport Sector \n \n                                                 \n1  RPK is a measure of airline passenger volume calculated by multiplying the number of revenue passengers carried \non each flight stage by the flight stage distance. \n2  FTK is a measure of airline freight volume calculated by multiplying freight carried on each flight stage by the flight \nstage distance. \n3  Research in China. 2007. China Air Transportation and Airport Industry Report. Beijing. ", "2       \n5.  The  PRC  had  146  civil  airports  in  operation  in  2006.  There  were  7  airports  with \nthroughput capacity for 10 million passengers, 12 with capacity for 5\u201310 million, and 25 with \ncapacity for 1\u20135 million.4 Seven of the top ten airports in the PRC have experienced double-digit \ngrowth rates over the past 20 years and continue to expand, both in scale and number. \n \n6.  During  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005),  CNY110  billion  ($13.25  billion)  was \ninvested in hub and regional airport construction in the PRC. The 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u2013\n2010) continues to reflect the Government\u2019s emphasis on development of the airport sector. It \nstipulates the construction and expansion of some 60 airports, mostly in the western region. \nMoreover, almost all existing airports need rehabilitation. It is estimated that about $17.7 billion \nin capital expenditure is required for the civil airports in the 11th Five-Year Plan. It is projected \nthat more than 237 civil airports will come into operation by 2010. From 2006 to 2020, CAAC \nestimates that the number of airports is projected to grow 11% annually. \n \n4.  Government Policies and Regulations \n7.  Before 2003, all civil airports were directly controlled by CAAC, and most of them were \nsuffering losses. Since 2004, all civil airports (except those in Beijing and Tibet) have been \ntransferred to provincial and/or municipal governments. Although the local governments can \nbetter  plan  and  coordinate  the  development  of  airports  together  with  other  infrastructure \nfacilities, the capital expenditure required to expand and/or rehabilitate airports is an additional \nburden on local fiscal budgets. This is especially the case in the central and western regions, \nwhere  municipal  and  provincial  governments  are  constrained  by  (i)  their  limited  financial \nbudgets  and  overall  infrastructure  needs,  (ii)  lack  of  direct  access  to  multilateral  or  other \nexternal financing sources, and (iii) inability to meet the Government\u2019s counterpart funding \nrequirements.  \n \n8.  In 2002, the Provisions on Foreign Investment in Civil Aviation were promulgated, which \nallow for up to 25% foreign ownership, with approval from the National Development and \nReform Commission (NDRC) and CAAC. A majority of shares must remain with the domestic \nChinese partner, however. In 2005, CAAC passed the Provision on Domestic Investments on \nCivil  Aviation  Industry  and  the  Provision  on  Administration  of  Alliance,  Reorganization  or \nRestructuring  of  Civil  Aviation,  which  detail  the  regulatory  framework  for  participation  of \ndomestic private sector investment in civil aviation. \n \n5.   Tariff and Price  \n \n9.  The current airport pricing mechanism is enacted by CAAC with approval from NDRC. \nCAAC issues detailed pricing standards for landing fees, passenger processing and ground \nhandling fees. Overall, the airport tariff structure does not take into consideration the capital \nintensive nature of airports and is biased towards airports with larger passenger and cargo \nvolumes. The charges are based on a uniform formula used by CAAC, regardless of differences \nin operational and capital expenditures. Because the fee received is directly correlated with \naggregate passenger throughput, smaller airports with lower throughput often have difficulties \nwith long-term profitability and operational sustainability.  \n \n10.  Under a new CAAC pricing proposal, it is very likely that the overall charges will increase, \nwith charges on domestic routes increasing substantially. Almost all airports will benefit from the \n                                                 \n4  CAAC. 2007. Civil Aviation Sector Overview. Beijing. \n ", "  3 \nreform plan, especially small and medium-sized airports that derive all their business from \ndomestic routes.  \n \n5.   Constraints in Private Sector Participation  \n \n11.  The operation of civil airports requires special knowledge and sector-specific experience \nthat most local governments lack, reducing the efficiency of airports. Private sector participation, \naccompanied by funding and experience, is clearly needed in development of the airport sector \nin  the  PRC,  especially  in  the  central  and  western  regions.  However,  experienced  foreign \noperators are focusing on investments in hub or large airports in the coastal region, so as to \ncreate synergies with their existing operations and minimize investment risks. As a result, \npotential investors and/or operators for medium and small airports are likely to be from domestic \nmarket.  \n \n12.  Local investors and/or operators are typically relatively new and have limited financial \nresources, limiting their capacity to develop a large number of projects. Moreover, the local \nfinancing market, especially for the central and western PRC, is unfavorable to the private \nsector. Long-term private sector financing, which is desperately needed in the airport sector, is \nnearly nonexistent, limiting local private sector participation, especially in small and medium \nairports, and restricting mobilization of resources for the sector. Consequently, priority needs to \nbe given to dedicated and qualified local sponsors of airport infrastructure development in the \nPRC, particularly in the central and western regions. This can be achieved through equity \ninvestments and long-term local currency debt\u2014with which ADB has extensive experience in \nother, similar sectors\u2014which can in turn mobilize other financing. \n \nB.  ADB Operations, Strategy and Sector Policy \n13.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  the  PRC 5   is  based  on  five  development  objectives: \n(i) promoting equitable and inclusive growth, (ii) making markets work better, (iii) improving the \nenvironment,  (iv)  promoting  regional  cooperation,  and  (v)  private  sector  development  and \noperations. This  is consistent  with  priorities  highlighted  in  ADB\u2019s  Medium-Term  Strategy  II \n2006\u20132008 (MTS II),6 including (i) catalyzing investment to improve the investment climate and \nexpand private sector operations, (ii) strengthening inclusiveness through increasing investment \nto support rural development and social development interventions, and (iii) promoting regional \ncooperation and integration. In the PRC, ADB is enhancing its focus on achieving a better \ndevelopment balance between rural and urban areas, and between coastal and inland regions. \nThe emphasis on infrastructure projects in rural areas and less-developed central and western \nregions has increased.  \n \n14.  The PRC has been steadily transforming into a market economy, which has become the \nbasis and driving force for economic growth and job creation. In addition to ADB\u2019s policy advice \nto the Government on private sector development, ADB also provides project-based financial \nassistance. ADB\u2019s private sector operations in the PRC have focused on the infrastructure and \nenergy sectors, the financial sector, and environmental improvements. In the infrastructure and \nenergy sectors, ADB prioritizes pioneering projects with innovative contractual and financial \nstructuring  to  encourage  private  sector  participation,  enhance  management  expertise,  and \nimprove corporate governance. As agreed with the Government, ADB private sector operations \nwill identify and support viable projects that are located in the less-developed central and \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2006.

Project Description \n15.  The Project, which allows for both loan and equity participation by ADB, will support \nHAG\u2019s expansion and capital expenditure plan to privatize, rehabilitate, expand, upgrade, and/or \noperate medium and small airports in the PRC\u2019s central and western regions. The Project aims \nto (i) enhance the development of efficient medium and small airports in the central and western \nPRC through private sector participation; (ii) ease the financial constraints being faced by \nprovincial and/ or municipal governments through mobilization of private sector capital; and (iii) \nsupport  regional  economic  growth  and  equitable  economic  development  of  the  country. \nProceeds from the ADB loan and equity participation will be channeled through HAG to the \nportfolio airports in the central and western PRC. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Privatization \n16.  HAG procures the ownership and management rights to all its portfolio airports through \nprivatization, so both new and existing portfolio airports generate revenue and cash flow. HAG \nhas its own team to conduct pre-privatization evaluation and negotiation, with support from \nexternal  professionals.  The  pre-privatization  evaluation  is  typically  very  comprehensive, \ncovering legal, engineering, operational and financial aspects. Each privatization structure is \nunique, but all transactions are well documented and approved by various government agencies, \nincluding the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) and \nCAAC.  The  privatization  agreements  define  the  rights  and  obligations  of  HAG  and  local \ngovernments, with implementation closely monitored by various government agencies.  \n \nC.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n1.  Environmental Safeguards \n17.  HAG  and  its  portfolio  airports  abide  by  national  and  provincial  environmental  laws \nrelated to airport operations. HAG conducts environmental impact assessments for all of its \nprojects and applies for all required permits when implementing projects and operating project \nfacilities. Where environmental impacts related to construction and operation of airport terminal \nand associated facilities exist, these are rendered \u201cnot significant\u201d through implementation of \nappropriate monitoring and mitigation measures. \n \n18.  The  Project  is  classified  as  category  FI  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003) under ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). Due diligence was \nconducted on the environmental, safety, and health aspects of HAG\u2019s current operations to \nensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies.  HAG\u2019s  environmental  management  is \nconsidered satisfactory and in line with ADB\u2019s and local policies. In addition, HAG will ensure \nthat  environmental  monitoring  for  all  future  operations  of  each  subsidiary  company  is \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy. HAG is establishing environment \nmanagement systems (EMSs), including environmental assessment and review procedures \nsatisfactory to ADB. HAG will also ensure it complies with the PRC\u2019s environmental laws and \n ", "  5 \nregulations. HAG will periodically confirm with ADB its compliance with ADB\u2019s and the PRC\u2019s \nenvironmental requirements, and make reports on these matters available to ADB.  \n \n2.  Land Acquisition, Resettlement, and Indigenous Peoples \n19.  The Project is classified as category A with respect to ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy (1995) and category B with respect to ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). Due \ndiligence was conducted on the social aspects of HAG\u2019s current operations. With respect to \nHAG\u2019s planned expansion, land acquisition and resettlement activities could have substantial \nimpact, which cannot be identified at this stage. HAG has expressed the intention to avoid \ninvoluntary resettlement or adverse impacts on ethnic minorities if at all possible, and/or to \nadopt measures to minimize land acquisition or other activities that would lead to involuntary \nresettlement.  In  the  event  of  involuntary  resettlement  or  any  adverse  impacts  on  ethnic \nminorities as a result of HAG\u2019s investment, HAG will ensure that resettlement plans and/or \nethnic  minority  development  plans  are  prepared  and  implemented  consistent  with  the \nrequirements of ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy and Policy on Indigenous Peoples, and \nin accordance with the Social Safeguards Management Framework. \n \nD.  Development Impact \n20.  The Project serves as an important catalyst for the overall economic growth of the PRC\u2019s \nless-developed central and western regions. Airport facilities with inadequate passenger and \ncargo capacity and service constitute the major aviation infrastructure bottleneck in the central \nand western PRC. Through assistance to HAG in increasing airport capacity and improving \nairport efficiency in the central and western PRC, the Project will directly benefit the people in \nthe  area  by  (i)  providing  direct  access  to  and  from  markets  in  both  the  PRC\u2019s  relatively \ndeveloped coastal regions and in other countries, (ii) improving aviation safety and level of \nservice, (iii) reducing the cost and duration of long distance travel, and (iv) creating more \nemployment demand and opportunities. According to an estimate by the International Civil \nAviation  Organization,  every  $100  of  output  from  air  transport  generates  triple  that  much \ndemand, and 100 air transport jobs induce 610 jobs in other industries. \n \n21.  The Project promotes private sector participation in airport development in the PRC, \nthereby increasing the amount of available private capital in the civil aviation sector, which is a \nfocus  for  improving  the  country\u2019s  long-distance  transportation.  HAG,  a  local  private  sector \ndeveloper based in a relatively advanced coastal region, will transfer its financial resources, \nsuccessful experience and good practice to the less-developed central and western PRC in a \nsustainable manner through privatization of loss-making airports. The privatization of these \nairports will ultimately eliminate airport subsidies now being made by local governments, freeing \nup local government resources for other critical expenditures related to social concerns and \nhealth. \n \n22.  The Project will have a positive impact on the development of local capital markets \nthrough its use of locally raised funds. If the Project is implemented, and subject to Government \napproval, ADB will issue its second CNY-denominated bond (Panda Bond) to fund the Project, \nthereby assisting the Government to further improve the bond market in the PRC. The Project \nwill also increase the efficiency of the local financing market. ADB\u2019s CNY-denominated loan will \ncatalyze risk participation by international commercial banks, which otherwise could not finance \na  project  requiring  CNY  financing  due  to  a  lack  of  CNY  funding  capacity.  The  Project \nestablishes  an  excellent  platform  for  international  commercial  banks,  which  have  the  risk \nappetite to provide long-term local currency loans, but limited capacity to do so. \n ", "6       \n \nE.  Development Effectiveness \n23.  The development effectiveness of the Project is assessed in terms of private sector \ndevelopment,  business  success,  and  economic  sustainability  as  per  the  guidelines  for \nimplementing  the  Good  Practice  Standards  for  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector  Investment \nOperations prepared by the Evaluation Cooperation Group of multilateral development banks. \nHAG  will  be  in  a  position  to  comfortably  fund  the  privatization,  expansion,  rehabilitation, \nimprovement and operation of airports in the central and western PRC, thereby improving \ncapacity and enhancing service. The increase in passenger and cargo traffic volume in its \nportfolio airports will lead to increased revenue and reinforce HAG\u2019s financial sustainability and \ncontinuous operations. On a broader level, the development effectiveness is reflected in the \nincreased capacity and enhanced service levels in HAG\u2019s portfolio airports in the central and \nwestern PRC. The impact of this can be observed by assessing the quantity and quality of the \nrelated aeronautical operations in the area.  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \nA.  Equity Investment \n24.  The proposed equity investment is to subscribe ordinary shares in HAG7 at a cost of up \nto  $50  million,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR).  The  terms  and  conditions, \nincluding valuation, representations, warranties, covenants, etc, of ADB\u2019s equity investment will \nbe similar to other equity investment to HAG at about the same time.  \n \n25.  The proposed ADB equity investment constitutes a critical and integral part of ADB \nassistance for HAG and the Project. Although HAG has already achieved significant success \nand established sound reputation in the sector, HAG is at the starting point of its planned \nexpansion and IPO. HAG has been actively seeking strategic investors to ensure its continued \ngrowth in the rapidly expanding sector. ADB is expected to assist HAG to enhance its good \ncorporate governance and improve its environmental and social management system.  \n \n26.  The proposed equity investment will be documented appropriately, and all contractual \nand financial arrangements should be satisfactory to ADB. The disbursement will be subject to \ncomprehensive  conditions  precedent,  including  all  necessary  governmental,  creditor,  and \nshareholder approvals and consents. \n \nB.  Loan \n27.  The proposed ADB loan will comprise an A Tranche funded by ADB and a B Tranche \nfunded by commercial banks. \n \n28.  The A Tranche is for up to CNY1.2 billion, or about $160 million equivalent. The A \nTranche will be funded from ADB\u2019s OCR without government guarantee, but with a 50% risk \nparticipation from international commercial banks to cover up to CNY600 million of ADB\u2019s risk \nexposure under the A Tranche. \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB may structure the proposed equity investment through an offshore special purpose company to be set up \ntogether with other investors. This is in line with international practice.  \n ", "  7 \n29.  The A Tranche will be funded through the proceeds of a CNY-denominated bond issued \nby  ADB.  The  A  Tranche  will  have  an  interest  rate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with \nprocedures applicable to ADB local currency loans.  \n \n30.  The B Tranche of up to $200 million will be funded by international commercial banks \nunder terms and conditions to be mutually agreed upon between HAG and the participating \ncommercial banks, with the concurrence of ADB.  \n \n31.  The proposed loan will be documented in loan agreements, which will contain standard \nterms  and  conditions  that  apply  to  loans  to  private  sector  borrowers  without  government \nguarantee. The terms of the loan will include financial and operational covenants and reporting \nrequirements. \n \nC.  Justification   \n32.  ADB\u2019s assistance for the Project is justified on the basis of its development impacts and \ndemonstration effects. It supports the Government\u2019s development plan and ADB\u2019s operational \nstrategies. ADB\u2019s participation in the Project will produce substantial added value. \n \n(i)  The  Project  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  Western  Region  Development \nStrategy to enhance economic development and reduce poverty in the central \nand  western  PRC,  which  is  the  key  theme  of  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan.  The \nstrategy  aims  to  reduce  development  disparities  between  the  western  and \ncoastal  regions.  The  Project  is  also  in  line  with  the  civil  aviation  policy  in \nGovernment\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Plan,  which  has  accorded  priority  to  the \ndevelopment of airport infrastructure in the central and western regions.  \n \n(ii)  The Project supports the Government\u2019s strategy of encouraging private sector \nparticipation in the airport sector, given the substantial investment required to \nexpand and improve airport facilities and the limited self-financing capacity of \nlocal  governments.  The  Project  is  expected  to  free  the  resources  of  local \ngovernments  from  local  airport  investment  and  operations,  making  them \navailable for other critical expenditures related to social concerns and health. \n \n(iii)  The Project is fully in line with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program in the PRC. \nADB is focusing its activities on promoting equitable and inclusive growth, with a \nstrong emphasis on infrastructure projects in rural areas and less-developed \ncentral and western regions. The Project will substantially impact the balance of \ndevelopment between coastal and inland regions. \n \n(iv)  The Project will be the first airport project supported by ADB in the PRC, and will \nbe ADB\u2019s first long-term local currency financing in the transportation sector, \nwhere  such  financing  is  desperately  needed.  It  complements  ADB\u2019s  existing \npublic operations in the PRC\u2019s transportation sector (mainly in the road subsector) \nby easing a major transportation sector constraint: airport capacity and efficiency.  \n \n(v)  The Project reflects the infrastructure focus of ADB\u2019s non-sovereign operations in \nthe PRC. In the infrastructure sector, ADB prioritizes pioneering projects with \ninnovative  contractual  and  financial  structuring  to  encourage  private  sector \nparticipation,  enhance  management  expertise,  and  improve  corporate \ngovernance. The Project will enable HAG, a local private sector airport developer, \n ", "8       \nto transfer its financial resources, successful experience, and good practice to \nthe less developed central and western PRC in a sustainable manner through \nprivatization of loss-making airports, which are essential infrastructure facilities \nfor economic growth. ADB will assist HAG to mobilize long-term local currency \nfinancing, which is not currently available in the market, by easing the concerns \nof private equity investors, who will co-invest with ADB in HAG.  \n \n(vi)  The Project will have positive impacts on the development of the local capital \nmarket and local financing market. The CNY-denominated A Tranche will be \nfunded by a CNY-denominated bond issued by ADB, the issuance of which will \nassist the Government to improve the bond market in the PRC. The loan will also \ncatalyze financing from international commercial banks, including those with the \nrisk appetite, but limited capacity, to provide long-term local currency loans. \n \n(vii)  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  play  an  important  role  in  the  total  financial  plan  by \nsatisfying funding requirements and mobilizing additional funds from international \nbanks and private equity investors, but will also assist in attracting private sector \ninvestors by enhancing the institutional capacity of HAG. With potential board \nrepresentation throughout the period that ADB holds shares, ADB will support \nHAG  in  (i)  strengthening  its  institutional  capacity,  (ii)  enhancing  corporate \ngovernance, and (iii) developing a formal environmental and social management \nsystem for HAG\u2019s continued growth. ADB\u2019s participation in the Project will be \nviewed  as  demonstrational  and  catalytic,  and  is  expected  to  establish  more \nconfidence in HNA\u2019s upcoming IPO and future private sector participation in \nairport projects in the PRC. \n \nD.  Anticorruption and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism   \n33.  HAG was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and the \nCombating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism Policy (2003). Consistent with \nits commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require HAG to \ninstitute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best \npractice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption, money laundering, or the financing \nof terrorism, and covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The loan and \nequity documentation between ADB and HAG will allow ADB to investigate any violation or \npotential violation of these undertakings. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n34.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance to \nHAG. No funding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. ADB will enter into \nfinance documents acceptable to ADB following the approval of the proposed financing by \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed equity investment and loan would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove \n \n ", "  9 \n(i)  the equity investment in HNA Airport Group Company, Limited for an amount up to \n$50,000,000 to be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources; and \n \n(ii)  the loan, to HNA Airport Group Company, Limited, consisting of (a) an A Tranche in an \namount  of  up  to  CNY1,200,000,000  funded  by  ADB  and  supported  by  a  50%  risk \nparticipation from international commercial banks rated A or above, to be provided from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources without government guarantee; an interest rate to be \ndetermined based on the procedures applicable to ADB local currency loans for private \nsector operations; and (b) a B Tranche for an amount of up to $200,000,000 to be \nfunded by commercial banks under terms and conditions to be mutually agreed upon \nbetween HAG and the participating commercial banks with the concurrence of ADB, \nsubject to ADB\u2019s arrangement fee and annual administration fee to be approved by \nADB\u2019s Pricing and Credit Enhancement Committee, \n \nfor  the  Central  and  Western  Airports  Development  Project,  and  on  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report and as may be \nreported to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n16 November 2007 \n \n ", "Appendix 1     10 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance  Data Sources/Reporting \nDesign Summary  Assumptions and Risks \nTargets/Indicators  Mechanisms \nImpact       \n1.
