High  population  density,  poor \nhygiene  practices,  and  inadequate  sanitation  infrastructure  have  contributed  to  a  high \nprevalence  of  waterborne  disease  among  the  local  population  and  degradation  of  the  natural \nenvironment.  The  proposed  project  will  support  improvements  to  the  health  of  communities  in \nSouth  Tarawa.  This  will  be  achieved  through:  (i)  enhanced  community  engagement  in,  and \npublic  awareness  of,  hygiene  and  sanitation;  (ii)  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  sanitation \ninfrastructure;  (iii)  capacity  development    in  sector  planning,  and  operations  and  maintenance \n(O&M)  of  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation  services;  and  (iv)  the  creation  of  a  sanitation \nmaintenance fund to ensure adequate financing for sanitation infrastructure maintenance.1\n  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nAlmost  50%  of  Kiribati\u2019s  population  of  103,466  lives  in  South  Tarawa,  the  country\u2019s \npolitical and economic center. South Tarawa\u2019s main urban areas of Bairiki, Betio, and Bikenibeu \nhave  a  combined  population  of  24,171.  Rapid  urbanization  has  resulted  in  an  annual  average \npopulation growth rate of 4.4% since 2005. The average population density in South Tarawa is \n4,150  per  km2,  and  it  is  as  high  as  10,610  per  km2  in  the  most  densely  settled  areas. 2  In \ncomparison,  in  2010,  Singapore  had  a  population  density  of  7,126  per  km2. 3\n  Population \npressures, combined with uncontrolled urban settlement, have resulted in overcrowding that has \nput stress on critical public infrastructure and the natural environment. \n \n4. \nThe infant mortality rate in Kiribati at 46 per 1,000 live births is among the highest in the \nworld and can be attributed, in part, to infantile diarrhea.4 Health officials report an average of \ntwo to three outbreaks of acute diarrheal disease in South Tarawa every year which is directly \nlinked  to  inadequate  sanitation  and  poor  hygiene. 5  A  number  of  studies  have  shown  that \nhousehold groundwater wells, lagoon water close to the shoreline, and edible shellfish contain \nhigh  faecal  coliform  levels. 6  The  dominant  source  of  contamination  is  the  lack  of  adequate \nresidential  sanitation  infrastructure.  According  to  2005  census  data,  33%  of  South  Tarawa\u2019s \nhouseholds used toilets connected to the sewerage system, 27.3% used flush toilets connected \nto  septic  tanks,  3.7%  used  compost  toilets,  20%  used  the  sea,  29.1%  used  the  beach,  34% \nused pit latrines, and 6.8% used the bush.7\n  \n\n \n\nSuva. \n\n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.   \n2 Government of Kiribati, National Statistics Office. 2010.

The total \n\nis greater than 100% since households use multiple forms of sanitation. \n\n\f(MPWU)  staff  has  contributed \n\nDue  to  a  shortage  of  management  and  technical  skills  and  financial  resources,  the \n5. \nsewerage  system,  operated  by  the  Public  Utilities  Board  (PUB),  is  in  a  severely  dilapidated \ncondition. Weak capacity to manage existing sanitation assets and operations among PUB and \nMinistry  of  Public  Works  and  Utilities \nto  chronic \nunderperformance  of the  sewerage  system.  Sewerage services  are  provided free  of  charge  to \ncustomers.  O&M  activities  are  funded  through  government  transfers,  while  periodic  capital \ninvestments  in  system  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  have  been  externally  financed  by \ndevelopment partners. The current situation has resulted in low sustainability. In the absence of \nadequate resources, no preventive or routine maintenance is carried out; instead, maintenance \nis deferred until the system fails. This situation imposes high costs on both the government and \nthe  local  population  in  terms  of  lost  productivity,  health  expenditures,  and  degradation  of \nfreshwater resources and coastal areas. \n \n6. \nThe  problem  of  inadequate  sanitation  infrastructure  is  compounded  by  limited  public \nawareness  of  the  links  between  sanitation,  hygiene,  and  health.  Accordingly,  demand  and \nwillingness to pay for improved sanitation facilities are low. Households do not perceive the full \nbenefits associated with improved sewerage services, nor the large negative externalities linked \nto common behavior such as open defecation and not washing one\u2019s hands. A widespread and \nsustained  public  awareness  and  education  campaign  specifically  targeting  groups  such  as \nwomen  and  children  is  required  to  bring  about  improved  hygiene  behavior  and  to  create \ndemand for improved sanitation. \n \n7. \nThe project is consistent with the Kiribati Development Plan, 2008\u20132011, which commits \nto improving health outcomes, strengthening governance in the provision of public services, and \ninvesting  in  social  and  economic  infrastructure.  The  project  is  included  in  the  Kiribati  country \npartnership  strategy,  2010\u20132014,  which  aims  to  reduce  poverty  and  promote  economic \nopportunity  by  improving  the  delivery  of  sustainable  infrastructure  services. 8\n  The  project \nsupports  the  country\u2019s  National  Sanitation  Policy;  National  Water  Resources  Policy;  and  the \nGovernment  of  Kiribati\u2019s Water  Supply,  Sanitation,  and  Solid Waste  Management  Program for \nSouth  Tarawa  that  was  developed  in  2010  with  assistance  from  the  Pacific  Infrastructure \nAdvisory Center. This program is intended to support a whole-of-sector approach and promote \neffective coordination of development partner-supported activities in the sector.  \n \n8. \nThe project meets the criteria for sector financing as (i) the government has prepared a \nwater  and  sanitation  program  for  South  Tarawa,  and  a  20-year  water  supply  and  sanitation \ninvestment roadmap, which provides a comprehensive framework for planning and coordinating \nsector  investments;  (ii)  additional  capacity  development  support  to  the  MPWU  and  PUB \nprovided  under  the  project  will  ensure  that  the  government  has  the  institutional  capacity  to  \nimplement  its  sector  development  plans;  and  (iii)  the  country\u2019s  sector  policies  are  appropriate, \nand assistance provided under the project will support their implementation, including increasing \naccess to sanitation and ensuring cost recovery in the delivery of water and sanitation services \nthrough tariff reform.  \n \nA  number  of  lessons  have  been  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  previous  sector  experience  in \n9. \nKiribati  under  the  Sanitation,  Public  Health  and  Environment  Improvement  Project. 9\n  These \ninclude  (i)  community  sanitation  and  hygiene  practices  are  slow  to  change  and  critically  affect \n\n                                                \n8 ADB. 2009.

Manila (Loan 1648-KIR(SF) approved on 8 December 1998). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nproject outcomes, (ii) lasting service improvements require sustained capacity development and \ncommitment \nto  reform,  (iii)  multi-dimensional  projects  require  coordination  among  all \nstakeholders to be effective. 10 These lessons are reflected in the project design as discussed in \nAppendix 1 of the Project Administration Manual (PAM).11\n \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  is  the  improved  health  of  South  Tarawa\u2019s  population.  The \noutcome  of  the  project  will  be  that  South  Tarawa\u2019s  urban  population  has  enhanced  access  to \nimproved sanitation infrastructure and services. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nThe project will deliver the following outputs: (i) sanitation and hygiene practices among \nSouth Tarawa\u2019s population will be improved, (ii) wastewater in South Tarawa will be effectively \nmanaged  by  PUB,  (iii)  the  MPWU  and  PUB  will  have  the  capacity  to  plan  and  manage  water \nand  sanitation  services,  (iv)  adequate  funds  will  be  available  to  the  PUB  to  finance  sanitation \nO&M, and (v) project management and implementation services by the Ministry of Finance and \nEconomic  Development  (MFED)  and  MPWU  will  ensure  efficient  and  effective  project \nimplementation.  The  majority  of  project  outputs  will  include  specific  gender  design  features  to \nensure women\u2019s participation in and access to project benefits. \n \n12. \nOutput  1:  Community  engagement.  Sanitation  and  hygiene  practices  among  South \nTarawa\u2019s population will be improved. A comprehensive and sustained community awareness, \nimprove \neducation,  and  participation  program  will  be  designed  and \nunderstanding of the close links among health, hygiene, water use, and sanitation practices at \nthe  urban  and  village  household  levels  throughout  South  Tarawa.  Awareness  activities  at  the \ncommunity  level  will  be  delivered  through  community  mobilizers,  engaged  under  the  project, \nwho  will  be  trained  in  sanitation  and  hygiene  promotion.  A  culturally  appropriate  media \ncampaign  will  also  be  launched. The  community  engagement  and  public  awareness  programs \nwill  be  implemented  in  coordination  with  development  partners  including  the  United  Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank, and the New Zealand Aid Programme. \n \n13. \ninfrastructure.  Priority  water  and  sanitation \ninfrastructure  will  be  upgraded.  High  priority  investments  identified  in  the  water  supply  and \nsanitation  road  map,  2011\u20132030  were  selected  as  core  subprojects.  These  include  (i) \nrehabilitation  of  the  existing  Bairiki,  Betio,  and  Bikenibeu  sewerage  systems;  (ii)  upgrading \nworks  on  three  sewerage  outfalls;  and  (iii) procurement  of  a  sludge  digester  for  septic  tank \neffluent,  and  sewerage  and  septic  tank  cleaning  equipment.  Additional  subprojects  will  be \nguided  by  the  country\u2019s  sector  road  map  and  investment  plan,  and  will  be  selected  during \nproject  implementation. Subprojects  will  be  screened  using  eligibility  criteria  defined  under the \nproject. 12\n  Investments  in  on-site  sanitation  are  likely  to  be  included  among  additional \nsubprojects. To ensure the sustainability of investments, maintenance contracts to provide O&M \nsupport  for  up  to  5  years  following  completion  of  civil  works  project  are  included  under  the \nproject. \n\nImproved  sanitation \n\nimplemented \n\nOutput  2: \n\nto \n\n                                                \n10 ADB. 2008.

The  MPWU and PUB will have the capacity to plan and \n14. \nmanage water and sanitation services. The project will strengthen the MPWU\u2019s capacity to plan \nand  develop  the  sanitation  and  water  supply  sectors.  The  project  will  deliver  training  to  PUB \nstaff  in  financial  management  and  O&M  to  ensure  effective  implementation  of  asset \nmanagement plans. The project will also assist with the development and phased introduction of \nan appropriate tariff structure. To address critical skills gaps within the MPWU and PUB, at least \ntwo staff will be provided with the opportunity to obtain diplomas in engineering. \n \nOutput  4:  Sanitation maintenance  fund.  Adequate funds will be available to the PUB \n15. \nto  finance  sanitation  O&M.  A  dedicated  sanitation  maintenance  fund  (SMF)  will  be  created \nunder the MPWU to ensure that adequate resources are available to finance O&M activities that \nare  critical  for  the  sustainability  of  infrastructure  investments.  The  SMF  will  initially  be  set  up \nwith  $1.4  million  in  grant  funds.  A  tariff  structure  will  be  developed  in  consultation  with  the \ngovernment  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  at  the  beginning  of  the  project \nimplementation  period,  and  tariffs  will  be  phased  in  over  the  life  of  the  project.  By  the  end  of \n2018, the PUB will be expected to recover at least 85% of O&M costs through user charges. \n \n16. \nOutput 5: Project management. Project management and implementation services by \nthe  MFED  and  MPWU  will  ensure  effective  and  efficient  project  implementation.  The  existing \nproject  management  unit  (PMU)  established  within  the  MFED  to  oversee  the  ADB-supported \nKiribati  Road  Rehabilitation  Project13\n  will  also  be  responsible  for  overall  project  coordination, \nfinancial  management,  procurement,  and  project  monitoring  and  reporting.  The  coordination, \nfinancial  management,  and  procurement  capacity  of  the  PMU  will  be  strengthened  with \nadditional  consultant  support  provided  under  the  project.  Consultants  will  assist  in  day-to-day \nadministration,  coordination,  financial  management,  and  project  performance  monitoring  and \nreporting. \n \n17. \nA  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  established  within  the  MPWU  to  oversee \nproject implementation. The PIU will be responsible for (i) civil  works construction supervision; \n(ii) feasibility  assessments  for  appraisal  of  additional  subprojects;  (iii)  detailed  design  of \nadditional  subprojects;  (iv)  design,  establishment,  and  management  support  for  the  SMF; \n(v) MPWU  and  PUB  capacity  building  activities;  (vi)  community  engagement  and  public \nawareness  activities;  (vii)  implementation  of  the  gender  action  plan  (GAP);  (viii)  ensuring \nsafeguards  compliance; \nto \ncontractors; and (x) carrying out and evaluating the results of periodic baseline and monitoring \nsurveys. The PIU will also assist the PMU in preparing work plans and tender documents, and \nsupport  the  tender  process,  reporting,  and  other  relevant  tasks.  Consultant  support  will  be \nprovided to the PIU to ensure effective project implementation. \n \nD. \n \n18. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $22,480,000  including  taxes  and  duties,  physical  and \nprice contingencies, and financing charges during project implementation.

The  project  will  utilize  a  seawater  reticulation  system  to  conserve  scarce \nfreshwater resources. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nEconomic  analysis. The economic internal rate of return is estimated at 16.1%, which \nis  considered  to  be  acceptable  as  it  exceeds  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12% \nadopted for the analysis. The high economic internal rate of return can be attributed to expected \nimprovements  in  productivity  resulting  from  reduced  incidences  of  mortality,  particularly  of \ninfants  and  children  under  5  years  of  age,  and  from  the  avoided  near-term  risk  of  a  serious \noutbreak of a potentially fatal disease such as cholera. \n \n23. \nFinancial sustainability. The financial analysis concluded that the project is both viable \nand sustainable based on the government\u2019s commitment to introduce tariffs to cover sewerage \nO&M costs along with service delivery improvements. The establishment of the SMF will ensure \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nthat  adequate funds  are  available  to  cover  O&M  costs  of the  sanitation system  in  the short  to \nmedium term. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nFinancial  management.  The  use  of  expenditure  commitment  controls  varies  between \nministries  but  is  generally  insufficient.  Although  financial  laws  and  regulations  have  been \nupdated periodically since their original enactment in the mid-1970s, they do not reflect current \nbusiness practices or modern public financial management. Understanding of, and compliance \nwith, existing regulations is also weak. Internal audit is weak, does not have its own mandate, \nand  is  not  actively  involved  in  systems  monitoring.  A  public  expenditure  and  financial \naccountability  assessment  conducted  in  Kiribati  in  2010  identified  weaknesses  in  budget \naccuracy,  significant  delays  and quality  issues  in  recording  and  reporting financial  information, \nand  deficiencies  in  internal  controls  and  audit.  To  mitigate  financial  management  risks,  the \nPMU,  supported  by  a  finance  officer  engaged  under  the  project,  will  ensure  the  accuracy  of \nproject  accounts.  Direct  payment  and  reimbursement  procedures  shall  be  used  for  all  works, \ngoods,  and  services  except for sanitation  maintenance  contracts  which  will  be  funded  through \nthe SMF. \n \n25. \nProcurement capacity. A procurement capacity assessment of MFED and MPWU was \nundertaken, which is included in the PAM. Given identified procurement capacity gaps, ADB will \nadminister  selection  of  project  management  and  implementation  consultants.  Procurement  of \ngoods and works will be managed by the project support consultant located in the PMU within \nthe MFED, with close oversight by ADB. A procurement review for effective implementation will \nbe carried out during the midterm review. \n \n26.  Weakly  performing  country.  Kiribati  is  recognized  as  a  fragile  state,  as  described  in \nADB\u2019s    Achieving    Development    Effectiveness    in    Weakly    Performing    Countries.14\n  Factors \ncontributing to the country\u2019s fragile situation were assessed and taken into consideration in the \ndesign of the project. \n \n27. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto,  and  discussed  with,  the  government  and  MFED.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 11). \n \nD. \n \n28. \nThe  project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  provide  social  benefits  through \nimproved sanitation and hygiene practices and enhancing access to improved sanitation among \nSouth Tarawa\u2019s population. This is expected to result in significant health improvements among \nthe local population. Improved productivity through a reduction in lost days of work as a result of \nillness  or  caring  for  sick  family  members,  and  reduced  expenditure  on  medical  treatment,  are \nalso expected to reduce poverty. \n \n29. \nGender.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  majority  of \nproject  outputs  have  specific  gender  design  features  to  facilitate  and  ensure  women\u2019s \nparticipation in, and access to, project benefits. The GAP will ensure that any potentially harmful \neffects  on  women  are  avoided,  with  specific  actions  that  will  allow  women  to  benefit  from  the \nproject.  The  GAP  includes  awareness  and  behavior  change  campaigns,  the  recruitment  of \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                \n14 ADB. 2007.

The  project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B  under  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  because  it  will  not  result  in  any  significant  environmental \nimpacts,  and  all  potential  impacts  can  be  adequately  mitigated  and  monitored.  Initial \nenvironmental examinations have been prepared for core subproject civil works in accordance \nwith the environmental assessment and review framework that has been prepared to guide the \nassessment of subsequent subprojects.15\n The environmental assessment found that the project \nwill improve the overall environmental quality of freshwater and nearshore marine areas through \nimproved  sewage  and  sanitation  facilities.  Some  impacts  are  expected  near  the  sewerage \noutfalls  but  these  are  expected  to  be  minimal  because  the  outfalls  are  located  more  than  100 \nmeters  (m)  offshore  and  25  m  deep  to  enable  high  levels  of  dilution.  A  climate  change \nadaptation risk evaluation was conducted and considered in infrastructure design. \n \n31. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  according  to  the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. It is expected to have minimal involuntary resettlement impacts, as \nthe  project  facilities  will  be  rehabilitated  on  existing  footprints  mostly  on  government  land. \nGovernment  lands  that  will  be  used  are  uninhabited  and  devoid  of  crops  and  other  assets. \nHowever, acquisition of a few parcels of private land and provisions for temporary access and \nuse during construction will result in minor resettlement impacts. A resettlement plan has been \nprepared  for  the  sample  subproject  based  on  assessment  of  impacts  and  consultations  with \naffected  persons. 16   A  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  providing  guidelines  on \nscreening,  assessment,  and  preparation  of  resettlement  plans,  if  needed,  for  additional \nsubprojects  that  will  be  selected  during  implementation. 17\n  Affected  people  and  local \nstakeholders have been consulted and provided with relevant information. \n \n32. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  C.  The  people  of  South \nTarawa  are from  a  single  ethnic group. There  are  no  customary,  cultural,  economic,  social,  or \npolitical institutions that set South Tarawa apart from the rest of Kiribati society. \n \n33. \nAll safeguard documents have been endorsed by the MFED, the executing agency, and \ndisclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  The  project  will  support  the  capacity  of  MFED  and  MPWU,  the \nimplementing agency, to manage safeguards. \n \nF. \n \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 18\n  The  expected  benefits  of  the  project \noutweigh the associated risks. \n \n \n \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n                                                \n15 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInsufficient procurement \ncapacity causes delays in \nproject implementation \n\nMitigating Measures \nAn  international  procurement  specialist  will  be  recruited  to \nfor  effective \nsupport \nimplementation  will  be  carried  out  during  the  midterm  review. \nInternational  competitive  bidding  will  be  used  for  procurement \nof all civil works and high-value equipment.  \n\nthe  PMU.

The  PUB  will  be  provided  with  capacity \ndevelopment  support  to  ensure  effective  implementation  of \nasset  management  plans.  Maintenance  contracts  for  civil \nworks  and  equipment  O&M  will  be  implemented  for  up  to  5 \nyears following completion of works. \n\nAn  extensive  education  and  awareness  program  has  been \ndesigned  based  on  in-depth  assessments  and  surveys  of \ncommunity  attitudes,  preferences  and  current \nlevels  of \nunderstanding  on  the  links  between  health,  hygiene  and \nsanitation. The program will be integrated with the awareness \nprograms  of  other  development  partners  to  ensure  a  uniform \nand consistent approach. Progress will be assessed as part of \nperiodic monitoring surveys, and corrective action will be taken \nas needed. \n\nSupport provided to the PUB will assist in developing a fair and \nequitable  tariff  for  recovery  of  O&M  costs.  The  project  will \nperform  outreach  activities  to  increase  awareness  among  the \npublic, PUB board members, and the government on the need \nfor  tariff  reform,  and  the  benefits  associated  with  ensuring \nquality service delivery. \n\nClimate change impacts \nreduce the life of sanitation \ninfrastructure. \n\nClimate change risk has been factored into the engineering \ndesign. A saltwater flush system has been selected for \ninclusion in the sewerage system rehabilitation works to \nconserve scarce freshwater resources. \n\nO&M  =  operations  and  maintenance,  MFED  =  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Development,  PMU  =  project \nmanagement unit, PUB = Public Utilities Board, SMF = sanitation maintenance fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n35. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents. \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fThe  government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are \n\n36. \nset forth in the loan agreement and grant agreement. \n \n37. \nEffectiveness  of  the  loan  agreement  is  conditional  upon  effectiveness  of  the  grant \nagreement, and vice versa.
