The  Program  is \nanchored in the Government\u2019s reforms in secondary education.  \n \nThe  SESDP  is  aimed  at  improving  the  average  learning  outcome \namong  secondary  students  through  three  outputs:  effective  and \naccountable management of secondary education, improvements in \nquality  for  international  competitiveness,  and  better  access  and \nequity  for  disadvantaged  groups.  The  SESDP  will  comprise  the \nfollowing  activities:  (i) updating  the  Secondary  Education  Sector \nMaster  Plan  2011\u20132015,  (ii) developing  new  national  standards  for \nsecondary  schools,  (iii) establishing  a  national  accreditation  board \nfor  secondary  schools,  (iv) introducing  a  new  human  resource \nmanagement strategy for secondary teachers, (v) issuing certificates \nto  secondary  teachers,  (vi)  introducing  a  new  learning  assessment \nsystem, (vii) participating in the Programme for International Student \nAssessment  of  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \n(ix) expanding \nDevelopment, \ncontinuing  education, \nfor \ndisabled students, and (xi) pilot-testing the conditional cash transfer \nprogram. \n \nViet Nam has enjoyed rapid economic growth over the past decade \non  the  strength  of  higher  farm  incomes,  strong  domestic  demand, \nand  fast  export  growth.  Exports  are  growing  by  15%\u201320%  per  year \nin  value  terms,  and  foreign  direct  investment  inflows  by  10%  per \nyear.  \n \nRecent  economic  growth  has  changed  the  sectoral  composition  of \nthe economy. In 1999, the country was primarily agricultural: 76% of \nthe  population  lived  in  the  countryside  and  agricultural  production \naccounted  for  26%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  (1998).  By \n2007,  the  share  of  agriculture,  forestry,  and  fishery  had  declined  to \n14.2% of GDP. Industry, on the other hand, has increased its share \nof GDP to 43.3%, while services now make up 42.5%. Such a shift\n\ncurriculum, \nintegrated  education \n\n(viii) upgrading \n\n(x) expanding \n\nthe \n\n\f \n\nii \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProgram Loan \n\nthe \n\nfrom \n\nthose \n\n \nwill  require  an  educated  and  skilled  workforce  to  support  an \neconomy based on services, technology, and industry.  \n \nThere  is  a  growing  need  for  more  than  just  equitable  compulsory \neducation.  Parents,  particularly \nincreasingly \nprosperous middle class, aspire to have their children succeed in the \nmarket economy and view the acquisition of academic qualifications \nand professional skills as a key strategy toward that objective. They \nrealize  that  primary  education  alone  will  not  secure  employment  in \nmodern  industries  and  well-paid  professional  careers.  Secondary \neducation is considered an entry-level requirement that can provide \nthe  basic  competencies  and  skills  for  technology  management  and \nproblem solving. \n \nViet Nam  must  improve  the  quality  of  its  labor  force  to  stay \ncompetitive within the region and sustain economic growth. In 2006, \nViet Nam had a work force (15\u201360 years of age) of 45.6 million, 3% \nmore  than  in  2005.  Nearly  half  (45.5%)  were  below  the  age  of  34. \nYoung  people  must  become  proficient \ninformation  and \ncommunication \nlanguages,  and  other \nprofessional skills and areas of knowledge. The quality of schooling \nand  the  learning  outcomes  must  be  equivalent  to  those  in  other \ncountries for Viet Nam to continue to compete internationally. \n \nThe expected impact of the program is enhanced learning outcomes \nand  competitiveness  of  secondary  school  students.  The  program \noutcome  will  be  improved  quality  and  equity  of  the  secondary \neducation system by 2015. \n\ntechnology, \n\nforeign \n\nin \n\nUntil  recently  Viet  Nam  was  largely  concerned  with  the  supply  side \nof  education.  Now  it  can  pay  greater  attention  to  making  sure  that \nthe  secondary  education  system  is  well  connected  and  has \nappropriate  means  to  give  all  students  access  to  good  education, \nregardless of their location and personal circumstance.  \n \nWhile  the  Government  sets  national  policies  and  programs,  local \ngovernments  have  long  had  autonomy  in  management  decisions. \nThis  arrangement  has  encouraged  local  ownership,  but  it  has  also \nresulted in critical gaps in access and quality of service provision in \nsome districts. To address concerns over the inconsistent quality of \neducation  across  provinces  and  districts,  the  central  Government \nmust  provide  a  clear  and  relevant  policy  reform  agenda  and \neducation policy framework, and have local governments adopt it in \ntheir decision making.  \n \nThe  program  loan  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  reform \nagenda \nand \nquality, \ncompetitiveness  in  secondary  education.  The  policy  actions  under \nthe  program  loan  will  deal  with  three  key  subsector  constraints: \n(i) sector management and accountability, (ii) quality and relevance, \nand (iii) access and equity. \n \n\nefficiency, \n\nimproving \n\naccess, \n\nfor \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nOverall Financing Plan \n\nTo  help  finance  the  estimated  cost  of  the  SESDP  of  $71  million \nequivalent,  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  has  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for a sector development program loan of \n$60 million  equivalent  (84.5%  of  the  total)  from  Special  Funds \nresources (Asian Development Fund)\u2014a program loan of $20 million \nand  a  project  loan  of  $40  million.  The  Government  will  provide \ncounterpart  funds  of  $11  million  equivalent  (15.5%)\u2014$7.3  million \nequivalent  (10.28%)  from  the  central  budget  and  $3.7  million \n(5.21%)  from  provincial  budgets\u2014for  a  construction  site  survey, \nmaintenance  of  facilities,  equipment  to  be  procured  under  the \nSESDP,  and  taxes  and  duties.

The loan amount covers \npart of the adjustment costs for the measures in the policy matrix to \nbe  implemented  over  the  first  3  years  of  loan  implementation.  The \nprogram  loan  will  be  released  in  two  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of \n$5  million  will  be  released  after  the  Government  meets  the  agreed \nconditions  in  the  policy  reform  matrix.  The  second  tranche  of \n$15 million  is  expected  to  be  released  24  months  after  loan \neffectiveness provided that ADB is satisfied that the Government has \nmade  enough  progress  in  implementing  the  Program  and,  in \nparticular,  has  met  all  the  conditions  in  the  policy  reform  matrix  for \nthe release of the second tranche.  \n \nJanuary 2008\u2013December 2012 \n \nThe  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full \nforeign  exchange  costs  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB \nmember  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed \nfrom other bilateral and multilateral sources.  \n \nThe  project  loan  will  support  activities  that  transform  the  policy \nprogram  into  local  actions  targeted  at  identified  areas  of  need.

MOET will be \nresponsible  for  overall  program  management  and  guidance  as  the \nExecuting  Agency.  A  central  project  management  unit  (CPMU)  will \nbe  created  in  MOET  to  oversee  day-to-day  project  implementation. \nThe  CPMU  will  comprise  a  qualified  full-time  project  manager  and \nkey technical staff. A provincial project management unit (PPMU) will \nbe  formed  in  the  department  of  education  and  training  (DOET)  of \neach  target  province.  The  PPMUs  will  implement,  coordinate, \nmonitor,  and  report  activities  in  the  province  with  instruction  and \nguidance from the CPMU.  \n \nMinistry of Education and Training (MOET) \n \nAll  procurement  of  goods  and  works  to  be  financed  under  an  ADB \nloan  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).

The  Program  will  (i) increase  the  number  of \nsecondary school graduates; (ii) improve the skills and performance \nof  secondary  school  graduates  in  the  labor  market,  leading  to \nincreased  earnings;  and  (iii) reduce  the  unit  costs  of  schooling  per \nstudent  through  improved  participation  and  completion  rates  in \nsecondary education. \n \nThe  Program  will  directly  benefit  ethnic-minority,  poor,  and  female \nstudents  by  making  secondary  education  more  accessible  and \naffordable.  The  pilot  conditional  cash  transfer  program  will  address \ndemand-side  constraints  and  reduce  the  direct  and  indirect  costs  of \neducation. The pilot program is expected to have significant impact in \nincreasing  attendance  and  transition  rates  among  the  poor,  ethnic \nminorities, and females from primary to lower secondary education, and \nfrom lower secondary education to upper secondary education, and in \nincreasing the number of years of education completed by poor children \nand girls. \n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions  There are still concerns about potential local government resistance \nto some of the proposed reforms. Efforts will be made to obtain the \nsupport  of  local  authorities  through  consultations  to  explain  the \noutputs and benefits of the reform actions. \n \nThe success of the Program requires substantial technical knowledge \nand management capacity. Institutional capacity development through \ntimely staff training will be essential. \n \nTo ensure that the proceeds of the program loan are used to support \nthe  agreed  policy  reforms,  the  loan  amount  has  been  earmarked  for \nthe policy reform actions and both MOET and the Ministry of Finance \nwill be responsible for the timely fulfillment of the target actions. Close \ninterministerial  coordination  and  a  solid  and  transparent  funds  flow \narrangement  will  be  the  key  to  the  successful  implementation  of  the \nProgram. \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nprogram loan, and (ii) a proposed project loan, both to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the \nSecondary Education Sector Development Program. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.  \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nIndicators and Analysis of Performance \n\n \n\n1. \n\nCountry Context \n\n2. \nSocioeconomic  development. Viet Nam has enjoyed rapid economic growth over the \npast  decade.  Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  per  capita  increased  from  $489.9  in  2003  to \n$1,052.7 in 2008. The real economic growth rate accelerated from 7.3% to 8.5% between 2003 \nand  2007  before  dropping  to  6.2%  in  2008.  This  progress  rests  on  fast  export  growth,  higher \nfarm  incomes,  and  strong  domestic  demand.  Exports  are  growing  by  15%\u201320%  per  year  in \nvalue terms, and foreign direct investment inflows by 10% per year.  \n \n3. \nAs  a  consequence  of  the  recent  economic  growth,  the  sectoral  composition  of  the \neconomy has also drastically changed. In 1999, the country was primarily agricultural, with 76% \nof the population living in the rural areas and agricultural production accounting for 26% of GDP \n(1998). By 2007, the share of agriculture, forestry, and fishery had declined to 14.2% of GDP. \nThe  share  of  industry,  on  the  other  hand,  has  been  climbing  and  is  now  at  43.3%,  while  the \nshare of services has risen to 42.5%. By 2010, it is estimated that the agricultural labor force will \nhave dropped to 50% but the labor force in industry and construction will have increased to 24% \nand the service labor force to 26%. Such a shift will require an educated and skilled workforce to \nsupport an economy based on services and industry.  \n \nThere  is  a  growing  need  for  more  than  just  equitable  compulsory  education.  Parents, \n4. \nparticularly those from the increasingly prosperous middle-income stratum of society, hold high \naspirations  for  their  children  to  succeed  in  the  market  economy  and  view  the  acquisition  of \nacademic  qualifications  and  professional  skills  as  a  key  strategy  toward  that  objective.  The \nfamilies  realize  that  primary  education  alone  will  not  secure  employment  for  their  children  in \nmodern  industries  and  well-paid  professional  careers.  Secondary  education  is  considered  an \nentry-level  requirement  that  can  provide  the  basic  competencies  and  skills  for  technology \nmanagement and problem solving. \n \n5. \nEnhancing  the  quality  of  the  labor  force  is  a  critical  element  for  Viet  Nam  to  retain \nregional  competitiveness  and  sustained  economic  growth.  In  2006  Vietnam  had  a  work  force \n(15  years  to  60  years  of  age)  of  45.6  million  people,  an  increase  of  3%  from  2005.  Of  this, \nnearly half or 45.5% are below the age of 34. Thus, it is important to equip young people with \nprofessional skills and knowledge such as information and communication technology (ICT) and \nproficiency in foreign languages. The quality of schooling and the learning outcomes of students \nneed to be equivalent with other countries for Viet Nam to remain internationally competitive.  \n \n6. \nGovernment\u2019s development strategy. The Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) \n2006\u20132010 underscores the Government\u2019s commitment to 14 major economic and social policy \ntargets, including (i) a slower population growth rate of 1.14%, (ii) reduced poverty, (iii) universal \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nthe  equitable  delivery  of  social  services \n\nlower secondary education (LSE),1 (iv) a reduction in the agricultural labor force to 50% of the \ntotal, (v) job creation and a stable unemployment rate, and (vi) less malnutrition. Key features of \nSEDP 2006\u20132010  are  an  emphasis  on \nto \ndisadvantaged  groups,  and  a  strong  results  orientation,  with  performance  indicators  including \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the localized Viet Nam Development Goals. \n \n7. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  high  rate  of  economic  growth  has  had  a  positive  impact  on  poverty  and \ncontributed to progress in achieving the MDGs and the Viet Nam Development Goals. Poverty \nincidence  was  reduced from  more  than  58%  in  1993  to less  than  20%  in  2007.  Youth  literacy \nhas reached 93%,2 and Viet Nam is close to achieving universal primary education. Most of the \ntargets  related  to  health  care  have  been  met.  These  significant  achievements  have  raised \nViet Nam\u2019s  human  development  index  to  a  high  level  relative  to  that  for  other  countries  in  the \nsame income group.  \n \n8. \nPersistent  development  inequalities  by  region,  ethnicity,  disability,  and  gender. \nHaving  achieved  impressive  overall  economic  growth  rates,  there  has  been  a  shift  in  poverty \nincidence\u2014from being widespread throughout the population it is now concentrated in specific \ngroups  that  are  harder  to  reach.  Four  groups  are  particularly  vulnerable:  rural  poor,  ethnic \nminorities, people with disabilities, and women and girls. \n \nIn 2006, 20.4% of rural households were poor, compared with 3.9% of urban households. \n9. \nThere  are  also  significant  differences  between  geographic  regions.  Poverty  is  highest  in  the \nNorth  West  region,  at  51.9%,  and  lowest  in  the  South  East,  at  6.1%.3 Ethnic  minorities,  in \nparticular,  have  not  progressed  to  the  same  extent  as  other  groups.  In  2006,  52.3%  of  ethnic \nminority households were poor, compared with 10.3% of ethnic Kinh and Chinese households. \nPoverty  among  ethnic  minority  groups  is  closely  associated  with  low  or  limited  access  to \nopportunities  for  education  and  training,  often  resulting  in  low  agricultural  productivity  and \nexclusion from participation in local governance. \n \n10. \nAs of March 2008, about 12.8 million persons have physical or mental disabilities in Viet \nNam.4 While  the  Government  has  provided  financial  support  programs  to  the  disabled,  they \nremain  restricted  in  accessing  education  opportunities  leading  to  lack  of  life  skills  and  job \nopportunities. Provision of schooling at secondary level is particularly limited. Until 2000, there \nwas only one lower secondary school in the country which was able to accept disabled children \nand  provide  integrated  education.  In  the  school  year  (SY)  2007/2008,  Viet  Nam  had  99,941 \ndisabled  students  receiving  schooling;  80,187  students  at  primary  schools,  but  only  17,329  at \nlower secondary school (LSS) and 2,425 at upper secondary school (USS).  \n \n11. \nGender  inequalities  continue  to  be  a  major  development  constraint  in  remote,  poor \nprovinces.  Literacy  among  adults  (15  years  and  over)  in  2000\u20132005  was  94%  for  males  and \n87% for females.5 One of the remaining inequalities in secondary education in the country is the \ndisparity between female and male enrollments at all levels\u2014LSE, upper secondary education \n(USE), and professional secondary education\u2014and especially in LSE. While gender disparities \nin  education  have  declined  in  recent  years,  it  persists  in  all  ethnic  groups  and  geographic \nregions.  The  percentage  of  students  in  secondary  school  is  generally  the  same  for  Kinh  and \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006.

This  gender  gap \nvaries  between  ethnic  groups  and  geographic  regions,  but  several  study  findings  and \nconsultations  identify  ethnic  minority  females  as  the  most  disadvantaged  group  in  secondary \neducation.  \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nEducation Sector Performance Indicators  \n\n12. \nKey investment option for development. Viet Nam considers education to be strongly \nlinked  to  economic  growth  and  gives  it  priority  in  investments  for  the  socioeconomic \ndevelopment of the country. The central goal of education is rapid human resource development \nto  meet  labor  needs  in  a  highly  competitive  market  economy  while  ensuring  a  high  level  of \nequity. Viet Nam\u2019s educated and low-cost workforce is an advantage, although this constitutes \nonly 27% of the national labor force, compared with 50% in some other developing countries in \nthe  region.6 The  Government  plans  to  increase  this  proportion  to  40%  by  2010,  and  60%  by \n2020.  However,  achieving  these  goals  will  depend  on  whether  education  in  Viet  Nam  can \nproduce a workforce with the creative and analytical skills needed to compete in an increasingly \nindustrial and knowledge-based economy.  \n \n13. \nEducation sector performance. Sustained efforts by the Government and development \npartners have resulted in relatively solid performance in education. In SY 2007\u20132008, the gross \nenrollment  rate  reached  95.2%  for  primary  education,  92%  for  LSE,  and  56.7%  for  USE. \nParticipation rate in higher education was 13% in 2008. Having achieved near-universal primary \neducation, as indicated in SEDP 2006\u20132010, the Government has made it the principal goal of \nthe education sector to achieve universal LSE by 2015 and improve the education system and \ncontent  by  2015.  Overall,  the  Government  has  gradually  shifted  the  focus  of  public  services \nfrom  equitable  provision  to  better  quality  of  services.  However,  a  remaining  critical  need  is \ndelivering  education  services  to  the  hardest-to-reach  groups  in  parallel  with  improving  the \nquality  and  effectiveness  of  secondary  education.  The  education  sector  is  analyzed  in \nAppendix 2. \n \n14. \nEducation finance. Public education expenditure is increasing at a steady rate, favoring \ndisadvantaged  areas.  The  current  sector  and  subsector  policy  frameworks  emphasize  these \ntrends.  In  SY2006/07,  education  accounted  for  19.8%  of  total  public  expenditure  and  5.1%  of \nGDP. In subsector share of education expenditure, there were clear shifts in priorities between \n2001  and  2008  (i) from  technical  training  (24.1%  to  18.9%)  to  general  education  (75.8%  to \n81.0%);  (ii) from  primary  education  (32.7%  to  29.2%)  to  secondary  education  (LSE  and  USE) \n(30.4% to 40.59%); and (iii) from relatively wealthy regions to remote, ethnic minority regions, in \nparticular, the Northern Mountainous, Central Highlands, and the Mekong River Delta regions.7 \n \n15. \nEducation sector policy and strategies. Secondary education development is guided \nby  the  (i) Education  Strategic  Development  Plan  2001\u20132010,  now  being  updated  as  the \nEducation  Sector  Strategic  Development  (ESSD)  for  2011\u20132020;  and  (ii) the  Secondary \nEducation Sector Master Plan 2006\u20132010.  \n \n\n                                                 \n6   Address by Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung to the National Assembly, 27 November 2006. \n7   ADB. 2009.

The  key  policy  targets  of  the \nESSD  are  (i) a  99%  net  enrollment  rate  for  primary  education  and  LSE;  (ii) an  80%  net \nenrollment rate for USE or its equivalent; (iii) a 90% completion rate for primary education, LSE, \nand  USE;  (iv) vocational  training  for  60%  of  the  labor  force;  (v) a  21%  share  for  education  in \nstate  expenditures;  (vi) secondary  school  students  with  subject  knowledge,  lifelong  skills,  a \ngeneral  understanding  of  science  and  technology,  a  vocational  orientation,  and  proficiency  in \nforeign languages; (vii) better-quality continuing education through diversified programs; (viii) a \n70% schooling participation rate for people with disabilities; (ix) foreign-language training for all \nstudents from grade 3 onward; and (x) increased attention to the education of gifted students. \n \nSecondary Education Sector Master Plan 2006\u20132010.8 The Secondary Education Sector \n17. \nMaster Plan 2006\u20132010 was developed with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand other partners. The plan sets out to (i) achieve universal LSE nationwide by 2010; (ii) improve \nthe quality of learning outcomes; and (iii) strengthen capacity for better resource management and \nmobilization, as key subsector targets. A new secondary education master plan will be developed \nfor 2011\u20132015 in accordance with the ESSD 2011\u20132020.  \n\n \n\n2. \n\nSubsector Challenges  \n\n18. \nAn  interim  review  of  progress  and  achievement  against  the  performance  targets  under \nSESMP 2006\u20132010 has indicated some emerging needs, which have been incorporated into the \ndraft  ESSD  2011\u20132020.  Among  these  are  better  international  benchmarking  and  performance \nassessment,  strengthened  foreign-language  training,  and  greater  use  of  ICT  in  learning  and \nteaching. The subsector performance assessment has also identified issues that still need to be \naddressed. The key sector constraints are shown in the program problem tree in Appendix 3.  \n\na. \n\nSystem Management \n\nNeed  for  a  new  subsector  strategy. While significant progress has been made under \n19. \nSESMP 2006\u20132010 in expanding secondary schools, the key policy objective has shifted from \nwider  coverage  of  general  secondary  education  to  improved  quality  of education  and  targeted \nsupport for more-equitable access for disadvantaged groups. An updated subsector strategy is \nneeded  to  provide  the  framework  for  secondary  education  and  guide  future  investments  and \nactions in the subsector. The new strategy must deal comprehensively with quality, relevance, \nand efficiency issues. \n \nOutdated national school standards. The Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) \n20. \nhas been using outdated national school standards (NSSs)9 for secondary education, which are \nof  insufficient  quality  or  relevance  to  allow  students  to  acquire  the  skills  and  knowledge  they \nneed to compete in modern society. The Government issued a directive for the updating of the \nNSSs for secondary education in 2005, but limited financial and human resources have delayed \nthis upgrading. NSSs that will equate better with international best practice but also recognize \nlocal  circumstances  are  needed.  These  NSSs  will  not  only  promote  world-class  education  but \nalso address issues of equity for all students.  \n \n21. \nIneffective  accreditation  system.  MOET\u2019s  Department  of  Education  Quality  and \nAccreditation  is  responsible  for  accrediting  public  schools.  Accreditation  is  now  done  only  on \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Strategic Secondary Education Planning \n\nand Cooperation. Manila. \n\n9   Viet  Nam  uses  three  levels  of  school  standards  for  primary  and  secondary  education:  (i) international  standards, \n\n(ii) national standards, and (iii) fundamental school quality. The current NSSs were developed in 2001. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nrequest,  so  many  rural  secondary  schools  have  not  yet  taken  part  in  this  important  quality \nassurance  process.  Moreover,  the  quality  of  accreditation  suffers  from  the  lack  of  adequate \nstandards.  To  ensure  that  all  secondary  schools  are  accredited  objectively  against  the  same \nbenchmarks,  a  more  rigorous  system  operating  under  an  independent  agency,  and  based  on \nthe new NSS, is needed. \n \n22.  Weak  quality  assurance  of  private  schools.  The  quality  of  nonpublic  schools,  with \ntheir poor teachers and facilities, and uncertain finances, is a source of particular concern. As \nthese schools are deemed part of the national education system (sharing in incentives related to \nfacilities,  land,  taxes,  fees,  credit,  insurance,  and  commendation  and  reward  systems),  the \nGovernment  expects  them  to  meet  the  same  standards  as  public  schools.  The  Government \ntherefore  plans  to  extend  the  accreditation  system  to  cover  both  public  and  private  schools  to \nmake sure that they all provide at least a minimum quality of schooling. \n \n23. \nPoor  human  resource  management  of  teachers.  Currently,  adequate  numbers  of \nteachers  are  being  trained,  although  demand  exceeds  supply  in  some  subject  areas  such  as \nEnglish, music, and ICT. There is no shortage of graduates qualified to teach, but few can be \ninduced to teach in rural and isolated areas. The incentive system set up by the Government to \nattract teachers to rural areas, particularly remote, ethnic-minority areas needs to be refined and \nexpanded.  As  full-day  schooling becomes  more  accessible  and  more  is  expected  of  teachers, \ntheir salaries and circumstances will have to be reviewed and improved to keep teaching jobs \ncompetitive with other forms of employment. \n\nb. \n\nQuality and Relevance \n\n24. \nNo  professional  certification  of  teachers.  While  more  than  80%  of  the  present  crop  of \nsecondary  teachers  have  the  required  academic  qualifications  and  adequate  subject  knowledge, \nsome lack practical teaching skills to motivate students to learn. Current teacher standards center \non academic qualifications and not actual teaching skills. Besides, there is no professional teacher \ncertification. While teachers are required to participate in some in-service teacher training programs, \nonce they graduate from a teacher training college (TTC) or a teacher training university (TTU), their \nprofessional status as teachers is secured.  \n \n25. \nTeachers need to upgrade their qualifications\u2014both in subject knowledge and teaching \nskills\u2014in order to meet the standards required for registration. There is also a pressing need for \nthem to be brought up-to-date with the latest education technology. Qualified teachers seeking \nre-entry  into  the  teaching  workforce  need  a  similar  range  of  in-service  courses.  The \ndevelopment of teacher standards will provide a clearer indication of the teaching skills, subject \nknowledge and attributes needed by teachers and will be incorporated into both pre-service and \nin- service programs. \n \n26. \nPoor assessment of learning outcomes. The concept of \u201clearning outcomes\u201d is new to \nViet Nam. Learning outcomes are often seen as amounts of memorized knowledge rather than \nthe acquired ability to think analytically, solve problems, and take a suitable attitude to learning \nrequired  to  compete  successfully  in  the  international  labor  market.  MOET  has  established  an \nassessment  monitoring  and  management  system  for  all  levels  of  education  including  the \nprovincial departments of education and training (DOETs) and the district bureaus of education \nand training. \n \n27. \nA  valid  and  reliable  system  and  standard  for  students\u2019  performance  and  attainments  is \nstill  being  developed,  although  MOET  has  been  monitoring  student  performance  through \n\n \n\n\fnational tests and examinations. New assessment instruments are being developed under the \nnational  achievement  monitoring  (NAM)  program  for  primary  education,  but  so  far  there  has \nbeen no such initiative for secondary education.  \n \n28. \nTo improve the assessment of learning outcomes, MOET plans to participate by 2012 in \nthe Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) of the Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation  and  Development  (OECD).  PISA  compares  the  performance  of  15  year-old \nstudents  near  the  end  of  basic  education  across  different  countries  using  internationally \nstandardized  assessment  tests.  Toward  the  end  of  compulsory  education,  it  evaluates  the \nadequacy  of  knowledge  and  skills  acquired  by  students  for  full  participation  in  society.  The \ndomains  of  reading,  mathematical  and  scientific  literacy,  problem-solving  skills,  and  analytical \nskills are covered.  \n \nLow-quality  secondary  curriculum. There are two major issues related to curriculum \n29. \nreform:  (i) there  is  no  regulatory  framework  for  the  periodic  review  and  upgrading  of  the \nsecondary curriculum, and (ii) the curriculum content still mainly emphasizes rote learning and \ndoes  not  help  secondary  students  develop  more  problem-solving  skills  and  analytical  abilities. \nAs the curriculum is the starting point of all other educational inputs, a system for the constant \nsupervision  of  curricular  content,  relevance,  and  application  in  schools  must  be  established. \nCurriculum  reform  will  thus  shift  from  the  ad  hoc  updating  of  subject  content  to  the  periodic, \ncomprehensive improvement of student learning outcomes through cognitive development and \nmore-innovative teaching. \n \n30. \ntertiary \ninstitutes\u2014universities,  technical  colleges,  and  other  training  institutes\u2014have  increasingly \nintegrated  the  use  of  ICT  into  their  programs,  ICT  in  secondary  schools  is,  still  too  often, \nnarrowly associated with the use of computers and the internet in classrooms. In addition, the \nconcept  of  \u201cICT  capability\u201d  in  secondary  learning  and  teaching  is  still  new  to  many  education \npolicy makers and teachers. For a smooth and effective transition from school to further study or \nwork, all secondary students must be skilled in the use of ICT to learn more, and learn better, in \nschool  and  be  prepared  for  future  study  or  work.  Students  are  expected  to  source  material \nthrough  the  web;  use  web-based  tools  to  create,  analyze,  and  evaluate  data;  and  submit  all \nreports  and  assignments  online.  Similarly,  industry  uses  ICT  as  a  critical  tool  and  requires \nworkers to have enough computer-based knowledge and technical skills to work efficiently and \neffectively.  \n \n\ninformation  and  communication  technology.  While \n\nLimited  use  of \n\nOutmoded \n\ntraining.  The \n\nforeign-language \n\nlimited  number  of  qualified \n31. \nforeign-language teachers and the outmoded teaching methods and instructional equipment at \nsecondary  schools  are  sources  of  great  concern.  English-speaking  teachers  often  leave \nteaching for better-paid jobs in the private sector and in urban areas. Viet Nam has decided to \nmake English-language skills a major feature of its school curriculum from grade 3 onward and \nto support that decision with additional funding at preservice teacher education institutions and \nin-service  teacher  training.  However,  a  vast  cadre  of  qualified  English  teachers  must  be \ndeveloped,  and  the  teacher  training  program  and  instruction  materials  urgently  need  to  be \nupgraded.  \n\nc. \n\nAccess and Equity \n\nDespite  the  impressive  growth  in  secondary  education,  inequality  in  the  distribution  of \n32. \nquality  schooling  has  remained  a  critical  challenge.  Ethnic  minorities,  girls,  children  from \ndisadvantaged and poor families, mentally and physically challenged children, children who are \noverage for their grade level, isolated rural populations, and recent urban migrants have not had \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\naccess to the same quantity or quality of instructional services as have other, more-privileged, \nsubgroups. This deficiency must be remedied through the provision of good-quality schools and \neducation, distributed according to need throughout Viet Nam. \n \n33. \nLow-quality  schooling  for  out-of-school  youth.  While  the  Government  needs  to \nincrease  access  to  secondary  schooling  to  achieve  universal  LSE,  it  is  also  necessary  to \nimprove the quality of continuing education (CE)10 for disadvantaged youth. On average, 47% of \nthe  students  attending  continuing  education  are  ethnic-minority  children  and  overage  students \nwho  could  not  start  schooling  at  the  regular  age.  CE  programs  generally  constitute  bridging \ncourses that create equivalency for years 7 and 9, and allow entry back into formal education or \ncreate  a  pathway  to  higher  or  vocational  education  for  disadvantaged  youth.  The  courses  are \nprovided at continuing education centers (CECs) in the provinces, districts, and communes. The \nCECs serve youth who have dropped out of the system, including the poor who cannot afford \nthe  cost  of  education;  youth  in  special  need  of  protection;  youth  affected  by  HIV/AIDS;  and \nyouth in the juvenile justice system. The aim of the equivalency programs is to draw these youth \nback into the education system and thereby improve their life chances and social opportunities. \n \n34. \nLimited  participation  of  disabled  children.  A  lack  of  social  awareness  regarding \ndisability  issues,  combined  with  traditional  negative  stereotypes,  can  restrict  educational \nopportunities  for  children  with  disabilities.  Parental  attitudes  may  also  hinder  enrollment  and \nsupport for the child to attend school. Many disabled children in Viet Nam are marginalized and \nexcluded from access to education, particularly at the secondary level. The high direct costs of \neducation  for  families  are  also  a  deterrent,  as  families  do  not  value  the  education  of  disabled \nchildren or spend much of their earnings caring for the disabled child.  \n \n35.  While  considerable  effort  has  been  made  to  promote  access  to  and  participation  in \nsecondary  education  for  students  with  disabilities,  reaching  the  2020  target  of  a  70% \nparticipation rate for disabled children will be a major task. Moreover, students must be able to \nparticipate in the full curriculum and realize their intellectual potential. As special schools cost a \ngreat  deal  to  build  and  operate,  one  alternative  would  be  to  start  by  equipping  classrooms  in \none  LSS  in  each  province.  Students  could  be  integrated  into  mainstream  classes  for  some \ncourses, and attend special classes for others. \n \n36. \nLow participation of the poor, ethnic minorities, and females. The Government has \nallocated  substantial  resources  to  improving  education  for  all  through  the  mainstream  MOET \nstate budget and other targeted initiatives such as the National Targeted Program on education. \nHowever,  the  participation  of  poor,  ethnic  minority,  and  female  students  is  still  substantially \nlower  than  the  national  averages.  In  SY2008\u20132009,  girls  made  up  47.8%  of  lower  secondary \nstudents nationwide, but, in the Northwest, where 82% of lower secondary students come from \nminorities,  less  than  44%  of  students  are  girls.  Dropout  rates  also  tend  to  be  higher  for \nminorities: in 2007\u20132008, the dropout rate for the Mekong River Delta region was 11%, almost \ntwice the national average of 6%.  \n \n37. \nLow participation is caused partly by supply-side constraints such as poor infrastructure, \nphysical isolation, language and cultural barriers, the small number and poor quality of teachers, \nand unsuitability of the curriculum to local needs. However, demand-side problems due to the \nsubstantial  direct  and  indirect  costs  of  education,  coupled  with  high  opportunity  costs, \n                                                 \n10  In  Viet  Nam,  the  term  \u201ccontinuing  education\u201d  does  not  mean  adult  education  or  lifelong  learning,  but  nonformal \neducation. Continuing education at the secondary level can be better tailored to the needs of overage students and \nout-of-school  youth  for  vocational  and  life  skills  while  earning  them  a  secondary  leaving  certificate.  The  SESMP \n2006\u20132010  emphasis  on  improving  access  to  and  the  quality  of  CECs  is  a  key  measure  for  the  realization  of \nuniversal secondary education. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nincreasingly  prevent  poor  parents  from  sending  their  children  to  school.  A  large  part  of  the \nopportunity cost, which increases at the LSE level as children get older, is the loss of child labor \nfrom  household  production.  Poor  families  are  reluctant  to  invest  in  children\u2019s  education, \nparticularly for their daughters, as the contribution of the child to the family income may be more \nimportant to the household in the short term. Children from the poorest quintile of the population \nwork  twice  as  many  hours  as  children  from  the  richest  quintile,  and  females  work  20%\u201350% \nmore  than  males  across  all  income  quintiles  and  ethnic  groups.  There  is  a  need  for \nawareness-raising  programs  to  promote  the  longer-term  benefits  of  investing  in  children\u2019s \nsecondary  education,  and \nthe  most \ndifficult-to-reach  groups,  such  as  ethnic  minorities  and  girls  in  the  poorest  communes,  into \nsecondary education. \n\ntargeted  assistance \n\ninnovative  and \n\nto  bring \n\nfor \n\n3. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Education Sector \n\n38. \nOfficial development assistance for the education sector. Many donor agencies and \nnongovernment  organizations  have  been  involved  in  the  education  sector.  The  Government \ngives  high  priority  to  education  and  training,  and  has  called  for  increased  investment  in  the \nsector  by  development  partners.  In  the  past  several  years,  official  development  assistance \n(ODA)  funds  for  education  and  training  composed  5.5%\u20136.0%  of  total  public  expenditures  for \neducation. Thirteen loan and grant projects totaling $782 million are providing ongoing support \nfor education sector development. While basic education has the largest share of ODA funds, all \nlevels  of  education,  from  nursery  to  tertiary,  have  received  substantial  assistance  from \ndevelopment partners. A donor coordination matrix is in Appendix 4. \n \n39.  Multilateral  partners.  The  World  Bank  has  supported  primary,  tertiary,  and  special \neducation.  The  World  Bank  and  the  Like-Minded  Donor  Group11 have  been  working  toward  a \nmedium-term  expenditure  framework  in  primary  education.  The  European  Commission  has \nrecently completed a teacher quality improvement project for basic education, and is providing \nongoing support to the education sector including the Support for the Renovation of Education \nManagement  and  the  Sector  Policy  Support  Programme  for  Education  for  All,  which  is  being \nimplemented  with  other  donors.  The  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural \nOrganization  (UNESCO)  is  also  a  key  development  partner  in  both  primary  and  secondary \neducation.  It  is  a  focal  agency  for  the  National  Action  Plan  for  Education  for  All  and  for  girls\u2019 \neducation,  the  capacity  development  of  local  education  authorities,  literacy  though  adult \neducation, and HIV/AIDS preventive education. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) \nis active in early childhood care and education, bilingual education for ethnic minority youth, and \nthe introduction of \u201cchild-friendly\u201d schools.  \n \n40. \nBilateral  partners.  France  is  the  largest  bilateral  partner  in  the  education  sector.  The \nGovernment  of  France  on  average  allocates  8%  of  its  ODA  to  education,  mainly  for  language \ntraining,  research  studies,  scholarships,  and  vocational  training.  The  Government  of  Japan  is \nalso  a  key  bilateral  donor  to  the  sector.  The  Japan  International  Cooperation  Organization \n(formerly  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency)  has  been  working  mainly  on  primary \neducation  through  school  construction  and  equipment  provision  since  the  early  1990s,  but \nrecently indicated a shift in priority from primary to secondary and tertiary education. Germany \nprovides  financial  and  technical  support  for  the  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  and \nTraining through German development cooperation (GTZ and KfW). Australia and Belgium have \nalso financed scholarships and have provided grant assistance to LSE as cofinanciers of some \n\n                                                 \n11  A group of 10 bilateral donors that share a common commitment to Viet Nam\u2019s Comprehensive Poverty Reduction \n\nand Growth Strategy for promoting pro-poor growth and aligning official development assistance. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nof ADB\u2019s technical assistance projects. The United Kingdom has similarly participated in World \nBank projects as a cofinancier. \n \n41. \nDonor  coordination  and  harmonization.  ADB  is  one  of  the  principal  development \npartners in the education sector in Viet Nam together with the World Bank, the Government of \nFrance,  and  the  European  Commission.  It  maintains  close  collaboration  with  the  key \ndevelopment  partners,  in  particular  with  the  World  Bank,  to  ensure  a  coordinated  approach \nacross  all  education  subsectors  and  to  harmonize  efforts  within  each  subsector.  ADB  is  a \nmember  of  the  sector  donor  coordination  framework,  the  Education  Sector  Group  (ESG), \ncomprising most development partners active in the sector. The major functions of ESG include \nproviding  consolidated  comments  on  various  government  education  policies  and  decrees, \nsharing  information  on  ongoing  and  upcoming  education  projects  financed  by  ESG  members, \nand organizing joint retreats and field trips among members. Since 2007, ADB has contributed \nto  the  formulation  of  several  new  education  policy  initiatives  and  joint  studies  with  other \ndevelopment partners.  \n \n42. \nADB\u2019s  education  sector  strategy  and  interventions. Under the country strategy and \nprogram (CSP) for Viet Nam 2007\u20132010, ADB is committed to long-term support for secondary \neducation as one of four key assistance areas. ADB investments in education have so far been \nmainly  in  secondary  education,  although  support  has  also  been  provided  more  recently  for \nvocational  training  and  higher  education.  ADB\u2019s  current  education  and  training  portfolio  is \nvalued  at  about  $195  million,  and  the  pipeline  for  2010\u20132012  at  about  $230  million.  All  of  the \nongoing  projects  will  assist  the  Government  in  achieving  the  MDG  and  SESMP  performance \ntargets for specific education levels and population groups.  \n \nADB\u2019s  education  investments  have  significantly  contributed  to  progress  in  meeting  the \n43. \nSESMP  development  targets:  (i) loans  2115  and  2384  have  helped  to  increase  LSE \nparticipation  rates  through  support  for  school  construction  and  LSS  teacher  development; \n(ii) loan  1979  has  helped  increase  the  USE  participation  rate  by  providing  more  then  2,000 \nclassrooms  and  school  dormitories;  (iii) loan  2384  has  helped  preserve  ethnic-minority \nlanguages  through  the  development  of  language  textbooks  and  instructional  materials  and \nthrough  multilingual  teacher  training;  and  (iv) a  public  expenditure  review  of  secondary \neducation and related capacity development programs, under TA 4603, laid the groundwork for \nan increase in the share of education to 20% of total government expenditure.  \n\n4. \n\nLessons Identified \n\nKey  lessons  identified  from  all  these  projects  are  that  to  meet  future  challenges  as  Viet \n44. \nNam becomes increasingly self-reliant requires that (i) improved institutional capacity building be \na  key  focus  of  future  projects;  (ii)  policies  be  reviewed  to  improve  and  coordinate  sector  wide \nstrategic  decisions;  (iii)  inclusiveness  be  redefined  to  include  groups  currently  not  receiving \nsufficient support; and (iv) innovation and research be better utilized to improve effectiveness and \nefficiency. How the Secondary Education Sector Development Program (SESDP) will incorporate \nthese issues is discussed in the Special Features section of this report (paras. 88\u201391).  \n \n45. \nLong-term  capacity  building.  Project-driven and project-based activities have not been \nfully  successful  in  eliminating  persistent  weaknesses  in  equity,  quality,  systemic  accountability, \nand  institutional  capacity.  A  comprehensive  and  dedicated  plan  for  institutional  and  human \nresource  development  must  be  designed  to  carry  out  and  sustain  educational  reforms  in  a \ndynamic  socioeconomic  environment  to  meet  the  country\u2019s  new  and  emerging  challenges.  The \nreform  actions,  when  implemented,  will  also  protect  ongoing  investments  in  other  development \nprojects in the sector.  \n\n \n\n\f \nSector  development  program  approach.  Most  ADB  education  projects  in  Viet Nam \n46. \nhave been primarily concerned with specific short-term development needs, in particular access \nand equity. These investment projects have assisted the country in meeting the urgent need to \nexpand and upgrade facilities and services and to increase enrollment, with expected positive, \ntangible, and quantifiable results. These investment projects have significantly helped improve \nenrollment,  transition,  retention,  and  teacher  training  in  the  secondary  school  subsector. \nHowever,  a  comprehensive  approach  to  more-complex,  systemic,  issues  of  quality,  efficiency, \nand capacity constraints demands policy-related reforms and initiatives.  \n \n47. \nThe  sector  development  program  (SDP)  is  thought  to  be  superior  to  traditional  project \napproaches  to  sustaining  reform.  An  SDP  is  an  appropriate  combination  of  policy  and \ninvestment  initiatives  that  will  enable  Viet  Nam  to  deal  more  effectively  with  the  major \nconstraints  on  secondary  education,  with  the  help  of  specific  supporting  investments.  The \nproposed  SESDP  responds \nthe  overall  subsector  difficulties  and  constraints  and \nrecommends policy and program initiatives for coping with these difficulties and constraints.  \n \n48. \nLimited  inclusiveness.  Out-of-school  youth  and  those  with  physical  disabilities  have \nnot  received  enough  support  under  past  policies  and  programs.  Both  of  these  groups  must \nreceive targeted support to realize the key goals of universal access. Innovative programs will \nhave  to  be  pilot-tested  and  their  effectiveness  monitored  for  the  effective  use  of  limited \nresources within a new national policy framework. \n \n49. \nImplementation  issues.  A  number  of  ADB\u2019s  education  projects  have  started  late \nbecause  of  delayed  loan  effectiveness.  With  better-harmonized  procedures  for  project \nadministration,  the  performance  of  projects  has  gradually  improved.  However,  there  are  still \ndelays caused by such factors as the slow and complex approval of procurement plans and the \nlimited number of staff in the State Treasury assigned to the education sector.  \n\nto \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n50. \nThe expected impact of the program is enhanced learning outcomes and competitiveness \nof  secondary  school  students.  The  program  outcome  will  be  improved  quality  and  equity  of  the \nsecondary education system by 2015. \n \n51. \nThe proposed SESDP will support the Government\u2019s policy reform agenda for improving \nthe quality, accessibility, efficiency, and competitiveness of secondary education. It will involve a \nprogram loan for policy reforms and an accompanying investment loan to support local actions \nrelated to three key constraints on the subsector: sector management and accountability, quality \nand relevance, and access and equity. The implementation of the program and project loans will \nbe coordinated.  \n\nB. \n\nProgram Loan \n\nPolicy  reforms.  The  secondary  education  sector  has  achieved  many  of  its  current \n52. \nnational  targets.  Access  has  improved,  due  to  the  introduction  of  targeted  national  programs \nand effective use of support from development partners. However the challenge is in moving the \nsystem from the achievement of equitable access to schooling, to one where both access and \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nquality  move  towards  international  standards.  For  this  next  stage,  the  strengthening  of  the \neducation  system  is  linked  to  poverty  reduction.  Viet Nam,  which  has  emphasized  the  supply \nside  of  education,  now  has  an  opportunity  to  turn  its  attention  to  the  demand  for  secondary \neducation that can ensure access to good education for all students, regardless of their location \nand personal circumstances.  \n \n53.  While  the  Government  is  responsible  for  setting  national  policies  and  programs,  local \nautonomy  for  management  decision  has  been  a  long-standing  feature  of  Viet  Nam's  political \nlandscape. Local ownership has grown as a result, but fundamental difficulties have also arisen \nin relation to the clarity of functional assignments, financial management, accountability, and the \nmonitoring and evaluation of the efficiency of educational expenditure programs. The significant \ndifferences in outcomes and performance across local governments have created critical gaps \nin access and quality of service provision in some districts.  \n \n54. \nIn order to address concerns over the inconsistent quality of local delivery of educational \nservices there is an increasing need for the central government to ensure that its policy reform \nagenda and actions emphasize government leadership and ownership. This is a complex task \nwithin a devolved system and requires that the education policy framework is clear and relevant \nand adopted as the underpinning framework for local decision-making. As national policies and \nprograms apply at the local level, there is a need to establish clear policies, goals and measures \nincluding rewards and sanctions, all linked to the principles of access for all, equity of outcomes \nand  an  expectation  of  excellence  and  transparency  of  processes  and  outcomes  that  underpin \nthe achievement of the MDGs. The policy reform matrix is in Appendix 5 and the Policy Letter is \nin Appendix 6. \n \n55. \n\nThe program loan will support various outputs, as follows. \n\na. \n\nOutput 1: Effective and Accountable Management of Secondary \nEducation  \n\n56. \nNew  subsector  policy  developed. The current subsector master plan, SESMP 2006\u2013\n2010, will expire in 2010. A new secondary education subsector master plan should be part of \nESSD 2011\u20132020, now being prepared by the Government. The MOET has issued the Decision \n7674/QD-BGDDT on the development of the new SESMP 2011\u20132015 and a draft concept paper \nin  2009.  The  preparation  of  the  new  SESMP  will  begin  with  a  review  of  the  progress  made \nunder SESMP 2006\u20132010. After the draft SESMP 2011\u20132015 is approved, the new SESMP will \nstart functioning as a base subsector policy for secondary education by 2012. All provinces and \ndistricts  will be  brought  under  the  national  policy  and  accountability  framework  of  this  SESMP \nfor consistency of educational outcomes with ESSD 2011\u20132020.  \n \nAll  secondary  schools  accredited.  The  MOET  will  develop  and  approve  a  new  set  of \n57. \nnational standards for secondary schools, last updated in 2007, in two phases\u2014a draft version in \n2009  and  a  modified  version  by  2012\u2014to  make  sure  that  all  schools  have  appropriate  school \nbuildings  and  facilities,  and  adequate  numbers  of  teachers  and  instructional  materials.  These \nNSSs are especially important in the rural areas, where costs are often higher but incomes lower. \nAll schools, no matter where they are built, must meet the national standards for effective teaching \nand  learning.  A  conceptual  framework  for  quality  assurance  for  secondary  education  is  in \nAppendix 7. \n \n58.  MOET has issued Decision 83/2008/QD-BGDDT on procedure, criteria and standards of \nthe  accreditation  of  all  secondary  schools.  An  independent  accrediting  agency  (the  National \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nAccreditation  Board  [NAB])  will  be  formed  to  undertake  transparent  and  regular  nationwide \naccreditation of all secondary schools\u2014public, semipublic, and private schools\u2014using the new \nNSSs. The nationwide accreditation will start by 2012.  \n \n59. \nImproved  working  conditions  for  secondary  teachers.  Equitable,  effective,  and \nsuccessful human resource management has always been a concern of the Government. It has \nstriven  to  train  people,  use  their  talents  and  expertise  efficiently  and  effectively,  and  suitably \nreward  them  for  their  efforts.  The  sustainable  provision  of  qualified  teachers  to  secondary \nschools in remote, ethnic-minority areas has also been a long-standing challenge. \n \n60.  MOET  has  finalized  the  ongoing  review  of  its  human  resource  management  (HRM) \nstrategy,  covering  teacher  recruitment  reform,12 and  draft  a  new  HRM  strategy  to  attract  more \nqualified secondary school teachers. An improved HRM framework, including new regulations, \nwill be developed to match teacher placements to need and reward teachers for their efforts and \neffectiveness. There is also an urgent need for a new reward system to motivate teachers who \nlive  and  work  in  difficult  conditions.  The  project  survey  of  20  disadvantaged  provinces  has \nshown  that  the  rewards  can  take  the  form  of  better  teacher  housing,  more-equitable \nopportunities for promotion through tailored career guidance, and instruction materials that meet \nlocal  needs.  By  2012,  the  MOET  is  expected  to  develop,  pilot-test  in  selected  provinces,  and \napprove  a  comprehensive  HRM  strategy  covering  not  only  recruitment  but  also  performance \nevaluation, transfers, incentives, and career development for secondary teachers.  \n\n \n\n \n\nb. \n\nOutput 2: Improved Quality for International Competitiveness  \n\nSecondary school teachers are certified and upgraded. The academic qualifications, \n61. \nknowledge,  and  teaching  skills  of  secondary  teachers  must  be  systematically  assured  and \nmanaged.  MOET  has  approved  the  new  standards  for  secondary  school  teachers  through \ncircular 30/2009/TT-BGDDT. The new standards identify the knowledge and skills that teachers \nmust have to teach more effectively. Three areas have been explored: (i) the subject knowledge \nrequired  to  teach  effectively,  (ii) the  teaching  skills  needed  to  motivate  students  to  learn,  and \n(iii) the  attributes  required  of  teachers  to  be  highly  effective.  MOET  will  start  assessing \nsecondary teachers on the basis of the new standards, and will issue professional certificates to \nqualified teachers who meet the standards.  \n \n62. \nThe  teacher  standards  describe  different  levels  or  standards  of  excellence,  from  those \nthat apply to a beginning teacher to those that define an excellent teacher, and will be used to \nreward excellence and to guide the professional development of teachers. They should replace \npromotion  and  reward  systems  based  on  years  of  service  with  a  competitive  system  of \npromotions  and  rewards  based  on  the  capacity  of  teachers  to  demonstrate  excellence  and \neffectiveness.  Teaching  standards  must  also  be  continuously  developed,  as  educational \nsystems  recognize  the  centrality  of  teacher  performance  in  high-quality  outcomes  of  students. \nThese  new  national  standards  establish  a  clear  policy  framework  for  assessing  teacher \neffectiveness.  The  first nationwide  teacher  quality  assessment  will  be undertaken and  the  first \nprofessional teacher certificates issued to qualified teachers by 2012.  \n \n63. \nLearning assessment system is upgraded. Decision 51/2008/QD-BGDDT from MOET \npertains to the updating of the learning assessment system for secondary education. Under the \nproposed  SESDP,  two  new  learning  assessment  programs  will  be  supported:  (i) the  NAM \nprogram; and (ii) the OECD\u2019s PISA.  \n \n                                                 \n12 Decision 62/ 2007/QD-BGDDT: Recruitment of teachers of preschools, general education schools, and CECs. \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n64. \nThe NAM will start providing reliable and objective data on learning outcomes, which can \nbe  used  by  MOET  in  planning  its  policies  and  by  schools  and  teachers  in  improving  their \neffectiveness. Its policy framework will guide local and national strategic decisions, especially in \ndirecting  resources  to  areas  of  concern.  MOET  will  develop,  approve,  and  pilot-test  the \nimplementation  of  the  draft  NAM  program  by  2012.  The  results  of  the  2012  NAM  will  be \nconsidered in the curricular reform scheduled for 2015. MOET has also officially approved the \ncountry\u2019s  participation  in  PISA  through  Decision  286/TB-BGDDT  (issued  on  5 May  2009). \nViet Nam  will  thus  become  the  third  country  in  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations \n(ASEAN), after Thailand and Indonesia, to participate in PISA. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nand  MOET  will  register  Viet  Nam\u2019s  participation  in  PISA  and  clear  the  technical  and  financial \nrequirements for the OECD assessment mission by 2012. The pilot-testing for PISA will start in \nselected LSSs.  \n \nSecondary school curricula are updated regularly. Viet Nam has had few policies or \n65. \nregulations  for  systematic  and  periodic  curriculum  review.  The  school  curriculum  is  therefore \nrevised ad hoc and according to curricular development theory and methods that do not meet \ninternational standards. As a result, the current secondary curriculum does not always meet the \nrequirements of society or the labor market. To improve the quality of the school curriculum, the \ncurriculum must be upgraded regularly. Minor revisions could be made every 5 years and a new \ncurriculum  developed  every  10  years.  Institutional  capacity  to  systematically  upgrade  the \nsecondary school curriculum according to international standards must also be strengthened.  \n \n66. \nThe regular review and upgrading of the secondary education curriculum is the subject of \nthe MOET Decision 7436/QD-BGDDT issued in 2008. MOET will create a task force to improve \nthe curriculum upgrading system. The curriculum will be reviewed regularly and revised every 5\u2013\n10 years to match content to the actual learning needs of society. The NAM program results will \nprovide added impetus for improving the problem-solving and analytical skills of students, which \nprevious  curricular  reviews  and  upgrading  did  not  fully  take  up.  MOET  will  issue  a  decision  or \ncircular approving the new curriculum upgrading system by 2012. The new system will contribute \nto the development and pilot-testing of the draft secondary curriculum in selected provinces, which \nwill start in 2012.  \n \nInformation  and  communication  technology  is  promoted.  ICT  use  in  secondary \n67. \nschools is currently limited to school administration (e.g., e-mail communication between MOET \nand \nissued \nDirective 55/2008/CT-BGDDT  (Enhancing  ICT  Application  for  Education  Sector  2008\u20132012) \npromoting the use of ICT in education. By 2012, MOET will approve a supplementary directive \non  the  use  of  ICT  to  support  effective  teaching  and  learning  in  secondary  schools.  The \nsupplementary  decision  will  also  define  more  clearly  the  expected  impact  of  ICT  use  on  the \nquality  of  education,  and  will  include  guidelines  on  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  ICT \nfacilities in schools. The new ICT teacher training and institutional materials will be pilot-tested \nin selected schools, starting in 2012.  \n\nlocal  offices)  and  basic  computer  courses \n\nfor  students.  MOET  has \n\nits \n\n \n\nc. \n\nOutput 3: Improved Access to and Equity of Education for \nDisadvantaged Groups \n\n68. \nContinuing  education  is  enhanced. Continuing education has been a key alternative \nlearning  opportunity  for  disadvantaged  youth  who  have  no  access  to  regular  LSS  because  of \npoverty,  distance  to  school,  and  the  need  to  engage  in  seasonal  labor.  However,  the  poor \nquality of the programs and the limited facilities at CECs have been key obstacles to universal \nLSE. To improve the quality of continuing education and make it more accessible, MOET issued \nCircular  48/2008/TT-BGDDT  (Guidance  for  Quality  Standards  and  Assessment  for  Continuing \n\n \n\n\fEducation  Centers),  which  redefines  continuing  education  and  sets  quality  standards.  A \nsupplementary MOET directive approving the expansion of the equivalency program for LSE at \nCECs  will  result  in  more-equitable opportunities  for  disadvantaged  youth.  By  2012,  MOET  will \nupgrade  and  approve  the  new  CEC  standards  and  LSE  equivalency  program  and  start  its \npilot-testing in selected disadvantaged provinces.  \n \n69. \nOpportunities for Disabled Students are Expanded. While the World Bank has been \nproviding  some  support  to  enable  physically-disabled  children  to  access  primary  education, \nthere has been no support provided to students with disabilities at secondary level. As a result, \nstudents with physical disabilities often need to give up secondary education since very few LSS \ncan  provide  these  students  safe  and  appropriate  learning  spaces,  particularly  in  the  poor \nprovinces. At household level, the families have a tendency in prioritizing their children without \ndisabilities  for  schooling  since  those  families  do  not  have  incentives  in  sending  their  disabled \nchildren to normal schools which are often not affordable for the disadvantaged families. \n \n70. \nTo achieve universal LSE, it is necessary to provide learning opportunities for physically-\ndisabled students. MOET has issued the Decision 23/2006/QD-BGD&DT on changes to special \neducation  from  a  \u2018separation  approach\u2019  to  an  \u2018inclusive  approach\u2019.  The  policy  shift  will  ensure \nthat more disabled students are able to access mainstream schools with ensuing improvements \nin LSE participation rates. In 2009, MOET has prepared an action plan to integrate \"secondary\" \neducation in accordance with the above Decision. By 2012, MOET will: (i) develop and approve \nthe guidelines for integration of physically disabled children in mainstream secondary education; \nand  (ii)  establish  model  integrated  LSS  in  selected  provinces.  The  Program  will  start \nestablishing  \"model  integrated  LSSs\"  for  physically-disabled  students  in  all  provinces  and  the \nawareness raising activities for integration education.   \n \nConditional cash transfer program is piloted. Decision 289/QD-TTg/2008 on targeted \n71. \nsupport for ethnic-minorities and poor households, issued by the Prime Minister, is expected to \nimprove  the  participation  of  ethnic-minority  and  female  students  in  education.  In  2009,  MOET \nissued  the Decision  7660/QD-BGDDT  regarding  the  pilot-testing  of  a conditional cash  transfer \n(CCT)  program  for  LSE  in  10  selected  disadvantaged  provinces.  The  program  will  provide \nfinancial  incentives  for  sending  children  to  school,  to  answer  demand-side  constraints  that \ncontinue to limit the participation of poor ethnic-minority and female students. By 2012, MOET \nwill review the results of the CCT test run and compare the CCT approach with other existing \npolicies for scholarships and financial support. The results will inform future support for poor and \ndisadvantaged students. \n\nC. \n\nProject Loan \n\n72. \nThe outputs of the proposed project loan (the Project) will be the same as those of the \nprogram loan except for an additional output (output 4), involving advisory support and capacity \ndevelopment activities for the effective and transparent implementation of the program activities. \nThe \nin \nSupplementary Appendix A. The outputs to be supported by the project loan will be as follows. \n\ntarget  provinces,  districts,  and  schools  covered  by \n\nthe  project \n\nloan  are \n\na. \n\nOutput 1: Effective and Accountable Management of Secondary \nEducation \n\n73. \nUpdating  of  the  secondary  education  sector  master  plan.  The  Project  will  provide \noverseas  management  training  to  relevant  agencies  in  strategic  policy  planning  for  secondary \neducation. After SESDP 2011\u20132015 is developed, three national workshops (for dissemination, \ninterim review, and final achievement assessment) will be organized.  \n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n74. \nUpdating of national secondary school standards. MOET will be assisted in updating \nthe  NSSs  for  the  nationwide  accreditation  of  all  secondary  schools  by  the  NAB.  Overseas \ntraining (accreditation and quality assurance training for 60 person-days) and in-country training \nwill  be  provided  to  1,260  persons  from  MOET,  the  DOETs,  LSSs,  and  USSs.  Females  will \ncompose  at  least  40%  of  the  participants  in  all  overseas  and  in-country  training.  The  draft \nstandards will be pilot-tested, and dissemination workshops on the new standards will be held \nfor the DOETs and schools.  \n \n75. \nEstablishment  of  the  National  Accreditation  Board.  The  Project  will  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s decision to establish an independent accreditation and quality assurance agency \nfor all schools, both public and private. The support will cover training to establish and develop \nthe  capacity  of  the  NAB,  and  the  cost  of  the  first  nationwide  school  accreditation.  Staff \ndevelopment  programs  in  quality  assurance,  including  a  degree  program  overseas,  will  total \nabout  800  person-days.  The  necessary  equipment  for  the  new  office  of  the  NAB  will  also  be \nprovided.  In  addition,  the  project  loan  will  support  research  for  the  nationwide  school \naccreditation.  \n \n76. \nIntroduction of new human resource management strategy. The Project will support \nin-country  training  and  a  series  of  workshops  in  the  new  HRM  strategy  for  secondary  school \nteachers. DOET officers in charge of personnel and secondary school principals will be trained \nto  apply  the  new  strategy  in  schools.  The  new  HRM  strategy  will  undergo  interim  review  and \nassessment in 2012 under the project loan. \n\nb. \n\nOutput 2: Improved Quality for International Competitiveness  \n\n77. \nCertification and upgrading of secondary school teachers. The Project will (i) issue \nprofessional  teacher  certificates  to  teachers  who  qualify  in  the  nationwide  assessment  of \nteacher quality using the new secondary teacher standards, and (ii) provide in-service training to \n\u201cunqualified\u201d teachers to enable them to meet the standards. A survey to gauge the impact of \nthe  new  teacher  standards  on  instruction  will  also  be  supported.  The  Project  will  provide  the \nnecessary training and equipment to the relevant departments of MOET and to TTCs and TTUs \nto upgrade the training of unqualified teachers. The project loan will support the MOET and its \nregional offices in the first nationwide teacher assessment by 2012.  \n \n78. \nUpgrading  of  the  learning  assessment  system. The Project will help (i) develop the \nnew  NAM  system,  and  (ii) increase  participation  in  PISA  through  related  overseas  and \nin-country  training.  MOET  and  the  Institute  for  Education  and  Science  will  be  assisted  in \nestablishing  a  professionally  competent  assessment  unit  that  can  undertake  periodic, \nsample-based  assessments  of \nlearning  outcomes,  using  modern  methods.  Training \n(3,200 person-days), equipment and software, and the cost of pilot-testing and implementing the \nNAM system and PISA will be covered by the project loan. \n \n79. \nRegular  upgrading  of  the  secondary  school  curriculum.  Overseas  and  in-country \ntraining  and  the  necessary  sample  instructional  materials  will  be  provided  to  strengthen  the \ninstitutional  capacity  of  MOET  and  the  relevant  institutes  and  agencies  to  systematically \nupgrade  the  secondary  school  curriculum.  The  Project  will  support  the  development, \npilot-testing, and dissemination of the new secondary school curriculum for both LSE and USE \nin 2015, using information obtained in the NAM and the first PISA results available after 2012. \nStaff will be trained in the international standard method and practice of curriculum reform and \ntextbook  writing.  The  project  loan  will  cover  the  pilot-testing  of  the  draft  curriculum  and \n\n \n\n\ftextbooks, based on the revised curriculum, and equipment for teaching practice centers under \nsix TTUs. \n \n80. \nPromotion  of  information  and  communication  technology  use.  The  Project  will \ndevelop and provide comprehensive technical support and background materials to facilitate the \npreparation  and  approval  of  a  supplementary  directive  on  the  use  of  ICT  in  secondary \neducation.  It  will  include  the  development  of  a  comprehensive  plan  including  software  and \nhardware  requirements,  ICT  training  programs  for  teaching  and  maintenance,  and  detailed \ncosting  and  plan  for  the  sustainable  financing  of  ICT.  An  appropriate  number  of  personal \ncomputers,  compatible  and  licensed  software,  and  supporting  accessories  for  effective \nclassrooms, as well as foreign-language training, will be provided to selected schools and TTUs \nnationwide.  The  Project  will  also  support  overseas  training  in  ICT-related  postgraduate \nuniversity  programs  in  countries  where  ICT  investments  have  been  empirically  linked  to \nimprovements in student learning outcomes.  \n \n81. \nImprovement  of  foreign-language  training.  The  Project  will  help  MOET  improve  the \nquality of foreign-language training and facilities by developing a new program for the teaching \nof  English  to  speakers  of  other  languages  and  providing  training  based  on  the  program. \nEquipment  for  language  laboratories,  overseas  training  for  English  teachers,  and  intensive \nEnglish training programs will be provided to 20 English teachers in TTCs and TTUs. In-country \nlanguage training will be provided to English teachers in 153 secondary schools and 423 subject \nteachers of specialized schools who teach their subjects in English.  \n \n82. \nSupport  for  gifted  students. Previously a small number of special schools existed for \nstudents with exceptional talents in some subjects such as mathematics. However, MOET has \nconverted  the  specialized  schools  into  experimental  schools,  where  innovative  education \ntheories  and  practices  are  pilot-tested  and  practiced.  The  experimental  schools  have  been \nestablished  in  63  provinces  and  contribute  to  the  improvement  of  the  quality  of  teaching  and \nlearning  in  regular  secondary  schools  in  the  provinces.  The  Project  will  provide  academically \nadvanced instructional materials and equipment and related teacher training. A tracer study of \ngraduates from the specialized schools and overseas training in the development of advanced \ninstructional  materials  and  teaching  methods  for  talented  students  will  also  be  provided  under \nthe Project. \n\nc. \n\nOutput 3: Improved Access to and Equity of Education for \nDisadvantaged Groups \n\n83. \nImproved continuing education. The Project will help develop continuing education by \n(i) providing 234 classrooms, 20 laboratories, 7 libraries, 32 sanitation facilities, and instructional \nmaterials  to  17  CECs  in  the  most  disadvantaged  provinces;  and  (ii) developing  the  new \nequivalency program, including instructional materials and teacher training. An impact survey on \nthe enrollment rate of disadvantaged youth in continuing education will be conducted under the \nProject. \n \nIncreased  access  for  physically  disabled  students.  The  Project  will  help  establish \n84. \n63 model  integrated  LSSs  in  all  provinces  for  physically  disabled  students  by  renovating  and \nupgrading existing school buildings. Civil works will include the installation of ramps for students \nusing  wheelchairs  and  crutches,  and  the  renovation  of  school  infirmaries  including  sanitation \nfacilities.  Equipment  and  school  furniture  specifically  designed  to  accommodate  the  needs  of \npersons  with  disabilities  will  be  provided.  The  Project  will  address  demand-side  issues  in \nintegrated  education  by  raising  public  awareness  of  the  importance  and  value  of  LSE  to \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nphysically disabled children. The Project will also support the first large-scale in-service training \nfor special education teachers at the secondary level, targeting 1,260 teachers nationwide.  \n \n85. \nImproved  access  and  retention  of  poor,  female,  and  ethnic  minorities  through \nconditional cash transfers. The Project will support MOET in pilot-testing a CCT program that \nbuilds  on  international  best  practices  for  improving  school  enrollment,  participation,  and \nretention  by  providing  conditional  grants  to  households  and  LSSs.  The  household  grants  will \nprovide about $120 per student per year in cash to very-poor families with children 11\u201314 years \nof age on the condition that the children enroll in LSSs and attend at least 85% of the classes. \nFemale  students  will  be  eligible  for  slightly  higher  grants  of  $140  per  student  per  year.  The \namounts  correspond  to  the  estimated  direct  and  indirect  costs  of  sending  children  to  school. \nPayments will be made to beneficiary mothers at 3-month intervals, with an up-front payment of \nthe grant equivalent for 1 month upon the signing of the agreement, to help households enroll \ntheir children in school. \n \n86. \nThe school block grants will address supply-side concerns such as teacher availability, \nteacher housing, textbooks, classrooms, and sanitary facilities. Its use will be determined by a \nschool\u2013community board composed of local stakeholders including representatives of DOETs, \nschool  administration,  parents\u2019  associations,  the  Vietnam  Women\u2019s  Union,  and  ethnic  minority \ngroups. The household and school grants will be transferred from MOET to the district bureau of \neducation and training offices, and from there to the individual school boards and households. \nThe CCT program will begin with a pre-pilot to test administrative, logistics, and other aspects of \nprogram  implementation.  The  implementation  plan  for  the  CCT  pilot  program  is  in  Appendix 8 \nand a detailed CCT report is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\n \n\nd. \n\nOutput 4: Program Implementation and Monitoring Support \n\n87. \nStrengthened  program  implementation  and  monitoring  capacity.  The  Project  will \nsupport  program-specific  monitoring  and  assessment  of  results  based  on  the  performance \nindicators  in  the  Program\u2019s  design  and  monitoring  framework.  Related  training  programs  will \nalso  be  provided  to  the  central  project  management  unit  (CPMU)  and  provincial  project \nmanagement  units  (PPMUs)  and  selected  program  implementation  partners.  In  addition,  the \nloan \nProject  will  provide  external  audit  services  covering \nimplementation.  \n \n88. \nProvision  of  implementation  support.  The  Project  will  provide  equipment,  vehicles, \ncomputers  and  software,  and  other  necessary  materials  and  furniture  for  the  SESDP \nimplementation  units  of  MOET  and  the  PPMUs,  the  participating  academic  institutes,  and \nselected agencies to ensure smooth project management and implementation. The Project will \nalso  provide  expert  international  and  national  consultants  to  help  MOET  and  other  related \nagencies implement a timely and high-quality program. \n\nfull  period  of  project \n\nthe \n\nD. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n89. \nSector  development  program  approach.  The  SESDP  will  be  the  first  SDP  in \nViet Nam\u2019s  education  sector.  Like  all  other  SDPs,  the  SESDP  comprises  a  set  of  interlinked \npolicy  reforms  and  investments.  The  three  key  policy  domains  are  fully  compatible  with \nESSD 2011\u20132020  and  are  anchored  in  the  Government\u2019s  policy  reform  agenda  for  secondary \neducation.  The  Program  recognizes  recent  key  policy  actions  while  supporting  the  complex \nreform  program  in  the  medium  term.  The  proposed  investments  are  consistent  with  these \npolicies and support their effective implementation. The improvement of the quality of secondary \n\n \n\n\feducation  with  an  equitable  approach  to  resource  utilization  is  the  overall  objective.  The  SDP \nmechanism allows simultaneous progress on both policy and project fronts. \n \n90. \nExpansion  of  targeted  support.  Past  and  ongoing  ADB  projects  have  been  poverty \noriented,  and  the  investment  priority  has  primarily  centered  on  access  to  schooling  for  the \ndisadvantaged such as ethnic minorities and girls. SESDP will continue to assist them but will \nalso target other disadvantaged groups that have been identified as vital to achieving universal \nLSE, such as physically disabled students. \n \nPilot-testing  of  the  conditional  cash  transfer  program.  SESDP will pilot-test a CCT \n91. \nprogram  that  provides  financial  support  to  poor  families  to  encourage  increased  enrollment, \nparticipation,  and  retention  of  poor,  female,  and  ethnic-minority  students.  Previously,  financial \nsupport  was  mainly  provided  through  scholarships  to  students  in  disadvantaged  regions  who \nwere already enrolled in school. To achieve universal LSE, out-of-school youth from the poorest \nfamilies must be brought into the school system. The CCT pilot program introduces a new and \ninnovative approach to achieving universal LSE by addressing demand-side constraints on poor \nfamilies who cannot afford to send their children to school. At the same time, the pilot program \nwill respond to the remaining supply-side needs through school block grants.  \n\nE. \n\nLoan Amounts, Terms, and Financing Plan \n\nOverall financing plan. To help finance the estimated cost of the SESDP of $71 million \n92. \nequivalent,  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  has  requested  ADB  for  an  SDP  loan  of  $60 million \nequivalent  (84.5%  of  the  total)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development \nFund)\u2014a program loan of $20 million (equivalent to SDR12,539,000) and a project loan of $40 \nmillion  (equivalent  to  SDR25,079,000).  The  Government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  of  $11 \nmillion  equivalent  (15.5%)\u2014$7.3  million  equivalent  (10.28%)  from  the  central  budget  and  $3.7 \nmillion (5.21%) from provincial budgets\u2014for a construction site survey, maintenance of facilities, \nequipment  to  be  procured  under  the  SESDP,  and  taxes  and  duties.  The  financing  plan  for \nSESDP is summarized in Table 1. \n \n\nTable 1: Financing Plan \n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank: Program Loan (ADF) \nAsian Development Bank: Project Loan (ADF) \nGovernment, Central \nGovernment, Provincial \n\nTotal \n($ million) \n20.00 \n40.00 \n  7.30 \n  3.70 \n71.00 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n% \n 28.17 \n 56.34 \n 10.28 \n 5.21 \n100.00 \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nADF = Asian Development Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n93. \nTerms and tranches of the program loan. The program loan of $20 million will have a \nterm of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate charge of 1% per year \nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  year  after  that.  The  size  of  the  program  loan  was \ndetermined by the strength of the policy package and its development impact. The loan amount \ncovers  part  of  the  adjustment  costs  for  the  measures  included  in  the  policy  matrix  to  be \nimplemented  over  the  first  3  years  of  loan  implementation.  The  proceeds  of  the  program  loan \nwill be disbursed in accordance with the State Budget Law to cover the following expenditures: \n(i) costs of legal procedures for the development and approval of new circulars and directives; \n(ii) human  resource  and  operating  costs  of  various  task  forces  and  agencies  such  as  NAB, \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nwhich will be established under the SESDP; (iii) costs involved in the upgrading of the teaching \nand management staff; (iv) costs of interministerial consultation and coordination for each policy \nreform action; and (v) other costs related to reform actions. The adjustment costs for the policy \nreforms are identified in Appendix 9. \n \nThe program loan will be released in two tranches. The first tranche of $5 million will be \n94. \nreleased  after  the  Government  meets  the  agreed  conditions  in  the  policy  reform  matrix \n(Appendix  5).  The  second  tranche  of  $15  million  is  expected  to  be  released  24  months  after \nloan  effectiveness  provided  that  ADB  is  satisfied  that  the  Government  has  made  enough \nprogress in implementing the Program and, in particular, has met all the conditions in the policy \nreform matrix for the release of the second tranche.  \n \n95. \nProject loan terms and investment plan. The project loan of $40 million will cover the \nbase  costs  of  the  project  activities,  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  interest  and  other \ncharges during implementation. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period \nof  8  years,  and  an  interest  rate  charge  of  1%  per  year  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nyear after that. The costs are summarized in Table 2. The detailed cost estimates and financing \nplan, by expenditure category and source of financing, are in Appendix 10. \n \n\nTable 2: Investment Plan (Project Loan) \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA. \n\nBase Cost a \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Effective and Accountable Management of Secondary \nEducation  \n\nB. \n\n2.

The  Government  will  establish,  within  3  months  of  loan \n96. \neffectiveness,  an  SESDP  steering  committee  chaired  by  the  vice  minister  of  education  and \ntraining to guide and supervise the overall management of the SESDP. The steering committee \nwill  comprise  representatives  from  the  relevant  ministries  and  agencies  including  the  Office  of \nGovernment,  MOET,  MOF,  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  and  the  State  Bank  of \nViet Nam.  \n \n97.  MOET will be responsible for overall program management as the Executing Agency. It \nwill guide the CPMU, the implementation agency to be established in MOET to oversee day-to-\nday  SESDP  implementation.  The  CPMU  will  comprise  a  qualified  full-time  project  manager,  a \ndeputy  project  manager,  and  key  technical  staff  including  specialists  in  learning  assessment, \ncurriculum  and  instructional  materials,  finance,  procurement,  civil  works,  teacher  training  and \n\n \n\n\fdevelopment,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  social  and  community  development,  and  ICT.  The \nCPMU  manager  and  staff  will  be  appointed  by  the  Government,  and  the  appointments  will  be \napproved by ADB. \n \n98. \nPPMUs will be formed, within 3 months of loan effectiveness, in the DOETs of all target \nprovinces,  given  their  success  in  past  and  ongoing  project  implementation.  The  PPMUs  will \nimplement, coordinate, monitor, and report activities in the provinces with instruction and guidance \nfrom  the  CPMU.  The  TTUs  and  TTCs  will  be  involved  in  the  SESDP  implementation  under  the \nguidance of the CPMU. The implementation organization chart is in Appendix 11. \n \n99. \nImplementation  period.  The  program  loan  will  be  implemented  from  January  2008  to \nDecember 2012, and the project loan from June 2010 to June 2015. The project loan will close \non 31 December 2015. The detailed implementation schedule is in Appendix 12. \n \n100.  Procurement.  For  the  program  loan,  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full \nforeign  exchange  costs  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible items in Appendix 13 and imports financed from other bilateral and multilateral sources. \nFor the project loan, all procurement of goods and works to be financed under an ADB loan will be \ncarried  out  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nThe CPMU, in close cooperation with relevant PPMUs, will be responsible for all procurement.  \n \n101.  Contract  packages  for  goods  valued  at  more  than  $1.0  million  (or  its  equivalent)  will  be \nprocured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  Contract  packages  for  goods  valued  at  less \nthan  $1.0 million  (or  its  equivalent)  but  more  than  $100,000  (or  its  equivalent)  will  be  procured \nthrough national competitive bidding (NCB) consistent with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Since \nthe proposed civil works will involve only small-scale construction such as the extension of CECs \nor  the  renovation  of  the  integrated  lower  secondary  schools  to  install  ramps  to  accommodate \nwheelchairs  and  crutches,  all  civil  works  contracts  will  be  procured  through  NCB.  Modifications \nand clarifications that need to be made in the Borrower\u2019s NCB procedures must be agreed on by \nADB and the Borrower. Goods packages and (where appropriate) works packages valued below \n$100,000 (or its equivalent) will be procured through shopping, according to ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines.   \n \n102.  MOET will develop and update the procurement plan with the contract packages for the \nproject loan (Appendix 14), and have it reviewed and approved by ADB. Within 1 year of loan \neffectiveness MOET will submit for ADB\u2019s approval a revised procurement plan that captures all \nprocurement that is ongoing or planned for the next 18 months. The plan will be updated yearly \nin the same way throughout the Program. MOET will undertake advance procurement action for \nthe  recruitment  of  an  individual  consultant  in  the  case  of  the  international  project  facilitation \nadviser.  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  with  advanced  action  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  related \nexpenditure under the SESDP or to finance the SESDP.  \n \n103.  Consulting services. Consultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). For smooth start-up, the international \nand national project facilitation advisers will be selected and hired individually to help CPMU develop \na solid implementation framework. The rest of the services will be provided by an international firm, \nto be selected and hired through quality- and cost-based selection, at the standard quality\u2013cost ratio \nof 80:20.  \n \n104.  The Project will provide 388 person-months of consulting services\u201468 international and \n320  national.  The  international  consultants,  to  be  recruited  through  an  international  firm,  will \ncomprise experts in (i) education system and curriculum improvement, (ii) school standards and \n\n20 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\naccreditation, (iii) learning assessment, (iv) ICT for education, (v) inclusive education, (vi) CCT, \n(vii)  gender  and  ethnic  minorities,  and  (viii)  procurement.  The  national  consultants  will  have \nexpertise in (i) education system and policy development, (ii) school accreditation, (iii) teacher \ncertification and accreditation, (iv) teacher assessment, (v) national achievement monitoring, (vi) \ninternational-standard learning assessment and PISA support, (vii) curriculum and instructional \nmaterial  upgrading,  (viii)  ICT  for  education,  (ix)  foreign-language  training,  (x)  continuing \neducation, (xi) civil works, (xii) inclusive education, (xiii) CCT, (xiv) gender and ethnic minorities, \n(xv) procurement, and (xvi) monitoring and evaluation. A summary of the consulting services is \nin Appendix 15 and details are in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n105.  Overseas training will be provided by international training providers, including research \ninstitutes and universities, which will be selected through fixed-budget selection. Detailed terms \nof  reference  and  selection  criteria  for  the  overseas  training  providers  will  be  developed  by \nCPMU with the assistance of international consultants during implementation.  \n \n106.  Governance  and  anticorruption  measures.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the \nProgram.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Program  shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe MOET and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate \nto the Program.  \n \n107. \nIn  addition  to  these  requirements,  to  deter  corruption  and  increase  transparency,  the \nGovernment  will  disclose  information  about  public  procurement,  including  that  related  to  the \nProgram,  on  the  procurement  website.  For  each  contract,  the  list  of  participating  bidders,  the \nname of the winning bidder, basic details on the bidding procedures adopted, the amount of the \ncontract award, and the list of goods and services procured, among other things, will be found \non  MOET\u2019s  project  website.  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  shall \nestablish a grievance redress task force at the MOET, to the satisfaction of ADB, to receive and \nresolve  complaints  and  grievances  or  act  upon  reports  from  stakeholders  on  misuse  of  funds \nand other irregularities, including ay grievance related to the CCT pilot program. The task force \nwill  (i) review  and  address  grievances  of  stakeholders  of  the  Program,  in  relation  to  either  the \nProgram, any of the service providers, or any person responsible for carrying out any aspect of \nthe Program; and (ii) proactively and constructively respond to them. \n \n108.  Disbursement  arrangements.  For \nin  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans,13 the \nproceeds will be disbursed to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam as the Borrower. No supporting \nimport documentation will be required, provided that the value of Viet Nam\u2019s total imports, minus \nimports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official \ndevelopment  assistance,  is  at  least  equal  to  the  amount  of  the  loan  to  be  disbursed.  The \nGovernment will certify its compliance with this formula with its withdrawal request. Otherwise, \nimport  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required.  ADB  will  have  the  right  to \naudit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. As such, \nthe procedures for procurement and disbursement of funds, and the use of counterpart funds, \nare felt to be satisfactory. \n\nloan,  as  provided \n\nthe  program \n\n                                                 \n13  ADB. 1998.

For  the  project  loan,  the  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  according  to  the \nprocedures in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). To \nspeed  up  project  implementation  through  the  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds  for  eligible \nexpenditures, a dollar imprest account will be established by the Government at a commercial \nbank chosen by the State Bank of Viet Nam and acceptable to ADB. The ceiling of the account \nand  the  initial  amount  deposited  in  it  will  not  exceed  $2  million  equivalent  or  the  estimated \nexpenditures for the next 6 months to be funded through the imprest account, whichever is less. \nThe \nthe  CPMU.  The \nstatement-of-expenditures  (SOE)  procedure  may  be  used  when  seeking  reimbursement  of \neligible expenditures and liquidating advances made into the imprest account according to the \nguidelines.  Each  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  SOE  will  not  exceed  the \nequivalent of $100,000. The funds flow arrangement is in Appendix 16. \n \n110.  Accounting,  auditing,  and  reporting.  MOET,  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  will \nmaintain separate records and accounts for the Project to identify goods and services financed \nfrom the loan proceeds. Project accounts, including financial statements, and SOE and imprest \naccount  records,  will  be  audited  yearly  by  independent  external  auditors  selected  through  a \ncompetitive procedure acceptable to ADB, according to the provisions of the Loan Agreement. \nThe auditors\u2019 services will be financed from the loan proceeds. The audit report and copies of \nthe  certified  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  no  later  than \n6 months after each fiscal year. The audit report will include the auditors\u2019 opinion on the use of \nloan  proceeds,  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  and  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  under \nADB\u2019s  SOE  procedure.  A  separate  audit  opinion  will  be  issued  on  the  use  of  the  imprest \naccount  and  the  SOE  procedure.  The  financial  management  assessment  and  fiduciary \nassessment, including the risk management and mitigation of procurement and corruption risk \nassessed under the midterm review of the CSP for Viet Nam 2008\u20132010, is in Supplementary \nAppendix D. \n \n111.  The CPMU will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation and submit them to \nADB  within  30  days  after  each  quarter.  These  reports,  which  will  include  data  on  the \nimplementation targets and their fulfillment, the problems and constraints faced, and proposed \nactions  and  solutions,  will  be  submitted  in  English,  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB.  Within \n3 months  after  the  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  CPMU  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project \ncompletion report providing details of project implementation, accomplishments, and impact.  \n \n112.  Program and project performance monitoring and evaluation. To monitor the overall \nprogress  made  by  the  SESDP  in  achieving  the  expected  outcomes,  MOET  will  establish  a \nperformance  monitoring  system  using \nfrom \nSESMP 2011\u20132015  with  baseline  information  from  MOET\u2019s  existing  education  management \ninformation system. CPMU will collect the education sector performance indicators annually and \nassess  the  progress  and  impact  of  the  SESDP.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  conduct  joint \nSESDP  reviews,  including  an  inception  mission,  regular  reviews,  a  midterm  review,  and \ncompletion reviews. The reviews will examine and assess (i) the implementation and progress \nof the Program and its outcomes, activities, inputs, administration, financial performance, policy \nreforms  provided  in  the  development  policy  letter,  and  institutional  and  sustainability  aspects \nincluding  aid  coordination;  and  (ii) compliance  with  social,  environmental,  financial,  and  other \ncovenants in the Loan Agreement.  \n \n113.  Stakeholder  participation  and  consultation.  The  Program  will  be  implemented  in \nclose consultation with central and local stakeholders. For the policy reform program, the MOET \nand  the  MOF  will  share  the  responsibility  for  interministerial  consultation  and  coordination  to \n\nresults-based  monitoring \n\nindicators \n\nthe \n\n22 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\nobtain  consensus  on  the  procedures  and  expected  outcomes  that  will  fulfill  the  conditions  for \ntranche release. The participation of local stakeholders, including communities, nongovernment \norganizations,  and  district  governments  in  the  SESDP  activities,  is  essential  for  the \nimplementation  of  some  subcomponents  in  the  disadvantaged  regions.  Communication  and \nconsultation  strategies  will  generate  support  from  ethnic-minority  communities,  particularly  for \nparticipation  in  LSE.  Such  strategies  can  use  village  assemblies  and  other  state-sponsored \nvillage  organizations.  Ethnic  minorities  tend  to  be  organized  around  the  village  and  village \nauthorities  that  have  considerable  legitimacy  as  a  result.14 The  gia  lang  (village  council)  can \nbecome  a  program  strategy  for  reaching  ethnic-minority  communities.  It  will  be  appropriate  to \nseek  the  support  of  nongovernment  organizations  and  prominent  ethnic-minority  intellectuals \nwith close links with their communities of origin. \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impact \n\nfrom \n114.  Sector  benefits.  The  secondary  education  sector  will  benefit  directly \n(i) strengthened  quality  control  and  assessment  of  secondary \nteachers  and  schools; \n(ii) improved  learning  outcomes  of  students,  measured  through  internationally  standardized \ntests,  which  will  provide  information  for  the  upgrading  of  the  secondary  curriculum  and \ntextbooks;  (iii) more-effective  teaching  and  learning  with  the  use  of  ICT  and  other  modernized \ninstructional  materials;  and  (iv) a  significant  increase  in  secondary  school  coverage  with \nnarrower  gaps  between  males  and  females,  between  income  groups,  and  between  ethnic \ngroups. \n \n115.  Economic  and  financial  benefits.  The  major  economic  benefits  of  the  Program  will \ninclude improved productivity of secondary school graduates and cost savings due to increased \nsystem  efficiency.  The  Program  will  (i) increase  the  number  of  secondary  school  graduates; \n(ii) improve  the  skills  and  performance  of  secondary  school  graduates  in  the  labor  market, \nleading  to  increased  earnings;  and  (iii) reduce  the  unit  costs  of  schooling  per  student  through \nimproved  participation  and  completion  rates  in  secondary  education.  The  economic  and \nfinancial analysis of the Program is in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n116.  Social  impact.  The  Program  will  directly  benefit  ethnic-minority  and  poor  students  by \nmaking  secondary  education  more  accessible  and  affordable.  The  pilot  CCT  program  will \naddress  demand-side  constraints  and  reduce  the  direct  and  indirect  costs  of  education.  It  will \nimprove the human capital of children of poor households and reduce intergenerational poverty \nin the future. The pilot program will also address supply gaps in the sector through community \nparticipation and school block grants. Community awareness-raising activities will demonstrate \nthe benefits of school participation. The pilot program is expected to have significant impact in \nreducing  the  poverty  of  poor  households,  improving  the  attendance  of  children  enrolled  in \nschool, improving transition rates to LSS and from LSS to USS, increasing the number of years \nof  education  completed  by  poor  children,  and  reducing  child  labor.  In  addition,  support  for \ncontinuing  education  and  improved  access  for  students  with  disabilities  will  address  long-term \nconstraints on equitable access to secondary education for groups that have traditionally been \nexcluded from attaining education beyond primary school. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 17. \n \n\n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2002. Indigenous Peoples/Ethnic Minorities and Poverty Reduction in Viet Nam. Manila. \n\n \n\n\flaws  supported  by \n\n117.  Gender  impact.  There  are  considerable  and  well-documented  gains  to  society  from \nimproved  educational  attainment,  and  social  benefits  are  particularly  profound  where  girls\u2019 \neducation  is  improved.  Empirical  evidence  demonstrates  that  educated  girls  have  reduced \nfertility rates, provide better nutrition for their families, and are more likely to use health services. \nEducated  mothers  are  more  likely  to  send  their  own  daughters  to  school,  thus  breaking  the \nintergenerational  transmission  of  poverty.  The  Program  will  directly  address  the  limited \nenrollment of female students by providing larger cash transfers to girls through the CCT pilot \nprogram. Families will thus have financial incentives to address the larger opportunity costs of \nsending  girls  to  school.  Channeling  the  funds  directly  to  mothers  will  promote  women\u2019s \nempowerment.  In  addition,  gender  issues  will  be  incorporated  into  the  overall  program.  A \ngender  action  plan  has  been  developed  to  ensure  participation,  equal  access,  and  equitable \nbenefits to men and women from program activities. Specific actions will ensure that women are \nequitably  represented  in  all  training  programs,  and  are  key  project  stakeholders  and \nfor \nbeneficiaries.  Curricula  and \ngender sensitivity, and the Government will see to it that all activities are consistent with the Law \non Gender Equality. The gender and ethnic-minority action plan is in Appendix 18. \n \n118. \nImpact on ethnic minorities. The Program is not expected to have any negative impact \non  ethnic  minorities  and  will  not  discriminate  against  ethnic  minorities  or  other  marginalized \ngroups. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), the Program has been \nclassified as category B. Specific actions have been included to ensure that (i) ethnic minorities \nand other vulnerable groups are part of all capacity-building and training processes, (ii) minority \nand  marginalized  groups  are  represented  on  community-school  boards  in  proportion  to  their \noverall  population  in  the  community,  and  (iii) ethnic  minorities  benefit  proportionally  from \nimproved access to and quality of secondary education. These actions are further detailed in the \ngender and ethnic-minority action plan in Appendix 18. \n \n119.  Resettlement.  No  involuntary  resettlement  or  land  acquisition  is  foreseen  under  the \nSESDP.  \n \n120.  Environmental aspects. No negative environment impact from the Program is foreseen. \nThe  Program  will  finance  only  minor  civil  works  involving  the  construction  of  additional \nclassrooms in existing CECs or the renovation of selected secondary schools to install ramps to \naccommodate wheelchairs for disabled students.  \n\nthe  Program  will  be  screened \n\nB. \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n121.  Local support for reforms. The SESDP outlines a range of policy initiatives that require \nthe support of the Government. While ADB has been undertaking intensive policy dialogue with \nMOET and other government agencies and confirmed their commitment to the proposed reform \nactions,  there  are  still  concerns  about  potential  local  government  resistance  to  some  of  the \nproposed  reforms.  The  reforms  related  to  human  resource  management  in  particular  are  not \neasy for the local governments to accept, as they are responsible for recruiting and paying the \nsalaries of LSE teachers. Efforts will be made to obtain the support of local authorities through \nconsultations to explain the outputs and benefits of the reform actions. \n \n122.  Technical  capacity  constraints.  The  success  of  the  Program  requires  substantial \ntechnical knowledge and management capacity. In particular, the establishment of the NAB and \nthe  development  and  adoption  of  the  NAM  and  PISA  need  staff  with  expertise  in  educational \ntesting  and  psychometrics,  and  the  management  of  an  independent  organization.  Institutional \ncapacity development through timely staff training will be essential.  \n\n24 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\n123.  Program loan utilization. To ensure that the proceeds of the program loan are used to \nsupport the agreed policy reforms, the loan amount has been earmarked for the policy reform \nactions  and  both  MOET  and  MOF  will  be  responsible  for  the  timely  fulfillment  of  the  target \nactions. Close interministerial coordination and a solid and transparent funds flow arrangement \nwill be the key to the successful implementation of the Program.   \n\nV.  \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n124. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nthat \n\nto  ensure \n\nthe  MOET \n\nThe Government will ensure that the counterpart funds for project implementation \nare  provided  on  time,  and  that  MOET  makes  available  all  funds  and  resources \nnecessary for construction and operation and maintenance of the Program on a \ntimely  basis.  The  Government  will  also  make  timely  submission  of  annual \nbudgetary  appropriation \nrequests  and  ensure  prompt  disbursement  of \nappropriated funds during each year of program implementation. \nThe  Government  will  cause \nthe  gender  and \nethnic-minority  action  plan  agreed  on  between  the  Government  and  ADB  is  fully \nimplemented  and  budgeted  for  and  that  all  program  activities  are  designed  and \nimplemented in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998) \nand Policy on Indigenous People. This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that \n(a) 40% female representation in Program-supported training programs; (b) ethnic \nminority  representation  in  training  supported  by  the  Program  is  at  least \nproportionate to their representation in the training pool and not less than 10%; and \n(c) all monitoring and evaluation data is disaggregated by sex and ethnicity. \nMOET will design, construct, and operate the physical facilities to be upgraded or \nconstructed under the Program in line with the Government\u2019s environmental laws \nand regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). In case of discrepancies \nbetween  the  Government\u2019s  laws,  regulations,  and  procedures  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy, ADB\u2019s policy will prevail. \nThe  Government  will  establish,  by  December  2011,  the  monitoring  framework, \nwhich  will  enable  the  progress  tracking  of  secondary  graduates  in  both  higher \neducation  institutions  and  the  work  environment  and  generate  feedback  for \nimproving \nimplementation  of  secondary \neducation. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  (a) the  CCT  program  is  implemented,  and \n(b) agreements  are  executed  with  the  selected  households  for  CCT  support \nensuring that their children will enroll in LSSs and attend at least 85% of classes; \nand \nThe Government will ensure that (a) transparent and merit-based selection citeria \nare  developed  and  agreed  on  between  the  Government  and  ADB  for  the \noverseas  training  of  the  teachers  and  the  teachers  are  strictly  selected  in \naccordance with the agreed selection criteria; and (b) agreements are executed \nwith  all  selected  candidates  for  receiving  overseas  training,  financed  under  the \nProgram,  ensuring  that  the  training  recipients  continue  working  with  the  same \nministry or institution from which they were originally selected for at least 3 years \nafter completing the overseas training program.  \n\nthe  relevance,  management  and \n\n \n125.  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  MOET  will  establish  and  submit  to  ADB  for \napproval, the baseline data and monitoring and evaluation indicators, paying particular attention \nto gender-disaggregated data. \n\n \n\n\fVI.  \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n126. \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 12,539,000 to \nthe  Socialist  Republic  of

Viet  Nam  has  experienced  significant  economic  success  over  recent \nyears. This success has resulted from considerable effort being directed at developing a skilled \nand  knowledgeable  workforce  through  a  focus  on  improving  educational  opportunities  for  all. \nWhile this success is applauded, a closer analysis of the situation indicates that only 27% of the \nnational  labor  force  meets  international  training  standards,  compared  with  50%  for  other \ndeveloping  countries  in  the  region.  However,  the  Government  recognizes  that,  to  remain \ncompetitive, it must increase the educational levels of the workforce. It has therefore set for itself \nthe target of improving the proportion of the workforce with the required formal skills to 40% by \n2010, and to 60% by 2020. \n \nThis  need  to  build  capacity  through  a  greater  focus  on  policy  development,  as  well  as \n2. \ncontinued  support  for  targeted  programs,  stems  in  part  from  the  reality  that  Viet  Nam  is  rapidly \nadvancing  toward  an  average  per  capita  income  of  $1,000,  which  it  is  expected  to  achieve  by \n2010. This will result in its being accorded middle-income country status and eventually lead to \ngreater internal funding of educational programs. For the country to make a successful transition \nfrom  aid  dependence  to  increased  financial  self-reliance,  it  must  develop  greater  policy  and \nstrategic  planning  capacity.  This  will  require  improved  internal  capacity  to  collect  and  analyze \ndata as the basis for identifying future areas of need, and to use resources effectively to improve \naccess to and the quality of capacity building programs.  \n \n3. \nPolicy  planning  and  finance  under  decentralization.  The  Ministry  of  Education  and \nTraining  (MOET)  oversees  the  education  sector  and  is  responsible  for  setting  broad  policy \ndirections  for  all  levels  of  education.  However,  management  responsibility  for  school  buildings, \nstaffing,  and  distribution  of  financial  resources  has  been  progressively  decentralized,  with \nuniversities  being  directly  managed  by  MOET,  upper  secondary  education  schools  (USSs)  and \nprofessional  secondary  schools  being  managed  at  the  provincial  level  by  the  departments  of \neducation and training, and lower secondary schools and primary schools being managed locally \nin the districts or communes by district bureaus of education and training. Service provision has \nbecome  increasingly  decentralized  through  the  removal  of  controls  from  the  center  and  the \nincrease in revenue-raising powers at the local level.  \n \n4. \nWhile  all  local  governments  must  adopt  national  policies,  there  are  considerable \ndifferences in educational outcomes between regions and provinces. Reducing gaps in regional \neducational performance outcomes is central to improving national performance and is one of the \nbiggest challenges facing both developing and developed countries. All students, irrespective of \ntheir local circumstances, must have access to good-quality schooling. The central Government \nmust  therefore  play  a  major  role  in  seeing  to  it  that  all  schools  meet  minimum  performance \nstandards  by  implementing  national  policies  that  are  constantly  reviewed  and  amended  on  the \nbasis  of  periodic  and  comprehensive  monitoring  and  assessment  of  sector  performance  and \nresults.  Part  of  this  process  will  be  reviewing  funding  arrangements,  although  this  will  be  an \nactivity over the longer term, when more valid and reliable national data become available. \n \nSchool  funding  is  a  complex  process,  with  revenue  provided  at  the  State,  province,  and \n5. \nlocal levels. Funds provided by the State are distributed according to a per-capita weighted index \nof disadvantage. This is supplemented at the local level through the application of fees that cover \nnecessary teaching and learning expenses and school development. Through targeted programs, \nthe  State  provides  fee  relief  and  scholarships  to  students  who  are  policy  beneficiaries,  such  as \nethnic minorities, students who live in difficult circumstances, the poor, and excellent learners in \nboth public and nonpublic schools at all levels of schooling. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n  \nQuality  assurance  of  secondary  schools. While secondary school provision continues \n6. \nto  expand,  many  rural  and  isolated  students  still  have  considerable  difficulty  gaining  access  to \ngood-quality  secondary  education.  Many  poorer  communities  have  secondary  schools  whose \nfacilities are not suited to the modern pedagogical approaches adopted by teachers. With limited \nfacilities,  teachers  cannot  use  small-group  and  problem-solving  approaches  that  are  central  to \nimproving learning outcomes.  \n \nSeveral standards have been developed to assist in the establishment of quality schools. \n7. \nInternational standards provide broad guidelines for lower secondary schools (LSSs) and USSs \nand assist in the development of national standards to guarantee access to facilities that facilitate \ngood-quality  learning  for  all  students.  National  standards  are  now  being  developed,  but  these \nmust  undergo  quality  assurance  to  make  certain  that  the  standards  equate  with  current \ninternational  standards.  As  part  of  this  process,  fundamental  school  quality  levels  are  being \ndeveloped  for  LSSs;  similar  standards  must  also  be  developed  for  USSs,  as  part  of  future \ninvestment  projects.  While  high  national  standards  are  a  central  part of  a  strong national  policy \nframework, they must apply nationwide and all schools must meet these standards irrespective of \nlocation or local circumstances. \n \n8. \nPrivate provision of schooling. The majority of formal education and training is publicly \nprovided  through  state-run  schools,  colleges,  universities,  and  training  centers.  There  are, \nhowever,  a  number  of  nonpublic  institutions  operating  at  each  level.  The  Government  has \nestablished a policy of encouraging the development of nonpublic or private schools, although the \neducation  law  states  that  private,  people-funded,  and  semipublic  schools  all  belong  to  and \ncontribute to the national education system. Nonpublic schools therefore benefit from incentives \nrelated to facilities, land, taxes, fees, credit, insurance, and commendation and reward systems. \nThe  same  expectations  and  laws  apply  to  both  nonpublic  and  public  schools  in  the \nimplementation  of  the  objectives,  contents,  curriculum,  textbooks,  teaching  methods,  and \nregulations relating to enrollment, teaching and learning, examinations, completion requirements, \ndiploma certification, and other matters. The nonpublic school system has been established at all \neducation levels, from early childhood care to higher education. \n  \nHowever, what is apparent is the lack of quality control across all schools and of national \n9. \nstandards for the quality of facilities and for the competencies and professional skills required for \neffective teaching, as well as an improved curriculum. Current policies will have to  be reviewed \nand new strategic plans developed for a coordinated national approach to improvement.  \n \n10.  While the need to develop national standards has been mentioned, these standards must \napply  to  all  schools.  Current  performance  data  highlight  considerable  national  variation  in  the \nquality of schools and in student achievement. To improve national consistency and reliability, an \nindependent,  specialized  agency  must  be  established  to  accredit  schools,  so  that  all  students, \nirrespective  of  their  local  circumstances,  have  access  to  good  schools  and  programs.  This \nagency  will  also  assist  in  strategic  decision making,  as  areas  of  need  are  identified  through \nindependent,  objective  analysis  of  performance,  and  provide  the  Government  with  relevant  and \naccurate data for the effective deployment of resources. \n \n11. \nQuality  assurance  of  secondary  teachers.  There  is  considerable  evidence  that  the \nquality  of  teaching  is  central  to  improving  student  learning  outcomes,  as  good  teachers  are \nknowledgeable and able to use a range of pedagogical approaches to improve student learning \noutcomes.  Recent  research  on  what  teachers  should  know  and  should  be  able  to  do  has  been \nused to develop a range of teacher standards. This development has  been critical to improving \nteacher  performance,  as  it  has  enabled  analytical  and  objective  analysis  of  performance.  Many \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n35\n\nsystems use teacher standards to make certain that all teachers have the skills, knowledge, and \nattributes  to  teach  well.  These  standards  inform  training  programs  and  focus  professional \ndevelopment programs on improving teacher effectiveness.  \n \n12. \nThey  are  also  used  as  the  basis  for  initial  selection  and  promotion,  as  there  is  a  high \ncorrelation between standards and student learning outcomes. While student learning outcomes \nare  critical  to  evaluating  teacher  effectiveness,  they  should  be  used  within  a  broader  teacher \nstandards framework, as not all students come from backgrounds that assist learning. Processes \nare  being  developed  to  measure  the  \u201cvalue-added\u201d  component  of  teacher  effectiveness,  where \nstudent  background  factors  are  acknowledged  and  measured,  enabling  judgments  to  be  made \nabout what an individual teacher adds to a student\u2019s learning irrespective of background factors. \nFor teacher standards to be effectively used, support must be given for their use as the basis for \ninitial training, for the upgrading of qualifications and skills, and for promotion. \n \n13. \nHuman  resource  management  of  teachers.  Effectively managing teachers is critical to \nimproving  student  learning  nationwide.  To  start  with,  a  teacher  workforce  plan  that  identifies \nfuture teacher needs must be developed on the basis of projected enrollment and teacher attrition. \nThis  analysis  must  be  refined  to  identify  locations  and  specialist  subject  teachers  where  future \nshortages  are  likely.  Teacher  training  can  thus  be  planned  so  that  sufficient,  but  not  excessive, \nnumbers of teachers are trained to meet projected needs. Incentives may have to be provided to \nmeet expected vacancies in hard-to-staff locations.  \n \n14. \nThe  initial  process  of  selecting  potential  teachers  must  also  be  better  planned  to  better \nensure that those who enter teacher training have the required attributes and abilities to develop \ninto successful teachers. Countries like Singapore and Finland use rigorous selection based on \nteacher  standards  to  select  candidates  for  teacher  training.  National  teacher  graduation \nstandards also make certain that all teacher-training graduates meet national standards, and that \nstudents,  irrespective  of  location,  are  taught  by  teachers  who  meet  the  national  standards. \nGraduates  also  require  support  in  their  first  years  of  teaching,  and  the  support  must  be  of  high \nquality.  Teacher  standards  for  experienced  and  highly  effective  teachers  allow  teacher \neffectiveness, and no longer years of service, to be used as the basis for promotion.  \n \nGood  teachers  are  critical  to  improving  student-learning  outcomes,  but  so  are  highly \n15. \ncompetent  school  principals.  Many  educational  systems,  recognizing  the  centrality  of  school \nleadership, have established leadership colleges and developed standards for school leaders and \nprincipals.  Many  require  prospective  principals  to  demonstrate  that  they  meet  leadership \nstandards before they can be considered for appointment. \n \n16.  Many of the aspects associated with effective human resource management of teachers \nare  currently  under  development,  but  much  more  is  needed  before  a  national  and  consistent \napproach  to  the  overall  management  of  teachers  is  achieved.  Such  an  approach  is  central  to \nimproving teacher effectiveness and improving student learning outcomes. \n \n17. \nLearning  assessment  system.  National  tests  that  are  more  valid,  more  reliable,  and \nfairer are proposed. Viet Nam\u2019s participation in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment  (OECD)  Programme  for  International  Student  Assessment  (PISA)  in  2012  would \nenable educational policy planners to analyze performance between provinces and districts, and \nto compare national performance against international norms. Better strategic decisions would be \nmade, equalizing opportunities as well as highlighting national areas for further development. It is \nanticipated that participation in PISA will enable 15-year old students to apply the knowledge and \nskills  they  have  acquired  to  solve  problems,  and  teachers  to  gain  an  increased  focus  on \nmore-effective educational practices instead of rote learning. \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n18.  While PISA will provide an invaluable assessment of national performance, it uses only a \nsmall sample of students to measure national performance. Current assessment practices must \nbe improved at all levels of schooling. These assessment practices must be both formative and \nsummative. Formative assessment allows teachers to monitor student learning progressively and \nuse  the  information  gained  to  improve  teaching  practice.  As  teachers  become  more  competent \nand professional, they can meet identified learning needs by adopting a range of approaches to \nteaching.  This  is  especially  important  in  meeting  the  individual  and  group  needs  of  particular \nstudents  and  addressing  concerns  over  different  learning  styles  often  associated  with  ethnicity \nand gender. A range of teacher support material will have to be developed so that teachers have \naccess to a variety of materials that will meet the particular needs of various students. Summative \nassessment, which has traditionally measured what has been learned after a study unit or subject \nis  completed,  is  still  important  but  new  and  more  innovative  assessment  practices  should  be \nfurther explored to ensure that the assessment covers both knowledge and the student\u2019s ability to \nuse the knowledge and skills acquired. \n \nAt  the  national  level  there  is  the  opportunity  to  develop  assessment  materials  that \n19. \ndemonstrate  to  teachers  how  they  can  assess  a  student\u2019s  ability  to  apply  knowledge  to  solve \nproblems. Such sample assessment materials encourage teachers to see that the application of \nknowledge and skills is central to achieving high-quality learning outcomes that are relevant in the \nworkplace  and  central  to  economic  and  social  progress.  This  focus  on  analytical  skills  and \nproblem solving must be central to the development of teacher standards and the effective use of \ndifferent pedagogies and assessment practices. \n \nCurriculum and textbook upgrading. Processes must be put in place for the systematic \n20. \nreview  of  the  curriculum  to  ensure  that  it  supports  the  achievement  of  national  goals,  including \nimproved competence in English. This is critically important, as the Government has made clear \nits  reliance  on  the  ability  of  the  educational  system  to  produce  high-quality  graduates  who  can \ndrive future economic growth, as well as to increase social harmony and reduce the gap between \nthe advantaged and the disadvantaged.  \n \n21. \nThe  relevance  and  quality  of  the  curriculum  and  the  assessment  practices  used  to \nmeasure  success  must  be  ensured.  A  broad  range  of  people,  including  teachers,  principals, \nemployers,  and  international  experts,  must  be  involved  in  this  process.  Approaches  to  effective \nteaching  should  be  constantly  reviewed,  together  with  the  curriculum  and  the  support  materials \nprovided to teachers. A number of nations are creating teacher \u201cidea banks,\u201d where teachers post \neffective  approaches  to  teaching  on  a  dedicated  website.  Because  these  idea  banks  undergo \nquality assurance, what is available is typically of high quality. Such practices make possible the \nstrategic  review  of  the  curriculum  and  the  introduction  of  systematic  improvements  to  meet \nchanging needs and put new technologies to the best use to improve student learning. \n \n22. \nAs teachers increase their professionalism, they will move from using a single prescribed \ntext  to  using  a  variety  of  materials  that  better  enable  them  to  achieve  the  learning  outcomes \nsought. This will require a move from a single prescribed text to recommending several texts that \ncan  be  used  depending  on  the  preference  of  the  teacher  and  the  learning  style  of  the  student. \nThis practice also helps students prepare better for university and further study, where they will \nbe required to source information and learning from various sources, including the internet. \n \nContinuing  education. While considerable effort has been targeted to ethnic minorities, \n23. \nthere are ongoing concerns that the Government\u2019s policies that place a high priority on supporting \nethnic-minority  students  have  not  achieved  the  outcomes  sought.  New  policies  and  support \nprograms must be explored and pilot studies undertaken to identify how current performance and \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n37\n\naccess  gaps  can  be  reduced.  The  central  Government  will  have  to  take  a  leadership  role  to \nensure  that  more  effective  policies  and  practices  are  adopted  nationally  in  this  key  area  of \ndisadvantage.  The  pilot-testing  of  new  approaches  will  better  ensure  that  targeted  support \nachieves the goal of improving secondary educational outcomes for the poor. Approaches such \nas conditional cash transfers, which tie support to the successful participation and involvement of \nfamilies,  provide  the  opportunity  to  refine  national  policies  and  programs  so  that  educational \nparticipation  and  success  are  better  assured.  This  will  help  achieve  the  goal  of  universal  lower \nsecondary education by 2015 (only 48 of 63 provinces had achieved this goal by 2008). \n \nEducation  for  children  with  special  needs.  The  Government  has  decreed  that  all \n24. \nstudents,  irrespective  of  background  circumstances,  should  receive  a  good  education.  This \nespecially applies to students with disabilities, as there is a need to ensure that their abilities and \naspirations  are  recognized  and  addressed.  As  students  with  disabilities  live  within  the  broader \ncommunity there are increasing trends to educate these students as part of mainstream schooling. \nStudents such as those with physical disabilities and those with limited sight or hearing are being \nincreasingly  integrated  into  mainstream  schools.  They  are  thus  provided  with  access  to  the  full \nrange  of  programs  available  to  other  students,  who  go  through  the  experience  of  living  and \nlearning  with  these  disabled  students.  This  process  provides  greater  opportunities  to  disabled \nstudents and develops a greater appreciation of their skills and abilities in the rest of the students. \nSuch  an  inclusive  approach  to  disability  better  ensures  that  all  students  develop  increased \nunderstanding of diversity and improved social harmony. \n \n25. \nFor such an approach to succeed, specialist teachers must be trained to support disabled \nstudents through direct teaching and other forms of support, possibly involving specialist classes \nfor part of the day as well as support for particular students within mainstream classes.  \n \n26. \nTransition  to  postsecondary  education.  As  a  country  committed  to  having  a \nknowledgeable and effective workforce operating within a harmonious society, Viet Nam aspires \nto have its people involve themselves in lifelong learning. This starts with school graduates either \ncontinuing with  their  education  in tertiary  institutes  or,  if  moving  directly  to  work,  participating in \nwork-based learning programs. For this to be effective, plans must be developed to facilitate the \ntransition from school to further study or work. In this process, students are counseled in school in \nselecting  subjects  that  provide  a  pathway  to  further  study  or  work  that  meets  their  aspirations, \ninterests,  and  abilities.  Work  experience  programs  may  be  developed  so  that  school  students \nwork for a short time within an industry or profession to gain a better understanding of post-school \noptions.  Employers  and  tertiary  institutes  must  take  increased  interest  in  school  programs  to \nensure continuity and relevance of learning. Final school assessment practices must also reflect \nthe  various  post-school  pathways  open  to  students.  Some  assessment  programs  will  require \nstudents to demonstrate academic excellence; others will be based on particular competencies. \nWhichever approach is deemed to be more suitable, all will need to ensure that they encourage \nlearning to be seen as dynamic and personally fulfilling.  \n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \nFigure A2: The National Education and Training System of Viet Nam \n\n \nDoctorate \n(2\u20134 years) \n\nMasters Degree \n(2 years) \n\n \nUniversity \nFirst Degree \n(4-6 years) \n\n \nCollege \n(3 years) \n\nUpper Secondary (3 years) \n\nLower Secondary (4 years) \n\nProfessional \nSecondary \n(3\u20134 years) \n\nVocational Training \nLong-term (1\u20133 years) \nShort-term (< 1 year) \n\nN\no\nn\n-\nf\no\nr\nm\na\nl\n \n\nE\nd\nu\nc\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n \n\nPrimary (5 years) \n\nKindergarten \n\nNursery \n\nSource: Ministry of Education and Training. \n\n \n \nAge \n27 \n26 \n25 \n24 \n23 \n22 \n21 \n20 \n19 \n18 \n17 \n16 \n15 \n14 \n13 \n12 \n11 \n10 \n9 \n8 \n7 \n6 \n5 \n4 \n3 \n2 years \n2 \nmonths \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fPROBLEM TREE FOR THE SECONDARY EDUCATION SUBSECTOR \n\nWeak Education Policy and System Resulting in Low Learning \nAchievement and Inequity of Access \n\nNoncompetitive \nEducation Quality  \n\nOut of School \nDisadvantaged \nGroups  \n\nPoor Management \nSystems and Tools \n\nNo  \ncomprehensive \nsubsector policy \nframeworks \n\nWeak learning \nassessment \nsystem \n\nOld national \nstandards for \naccreditation \n\nNo \naccreditation \nboard \n\nNo teacher \nstandards \n\nIrrelevant \ncurriculum \n\nNo teacher \ncertificates \n\nPoor \nlanguage \ntraining \n\nLimited \nICT use \n\nNo quality \nassurance of \nschools \n\nUnattractive \nHRM for \nteachers \n\nLanguage \nbarrier \n\nMale sibling \nprioritized \n\nLack of  \nrole model \n\nLow social \nawareness \n\nEthnic Minorities \n \nPoor households \n \nRemote areas \n \nGirls \n \nOverage cohort \n \nDisabled children \n\nCan't afford \nschooling \n\nLimited \nscholarships \n\nLimited \ndormitories \n\nlong distance \nto schools \n\nLow quality \nnonpublic schools \n\nNo job after \ngraduation \n\nlimited special \nschools \n\nICT = information and communication technology, HRM = human resource management. \n\n \n           Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n3\n\n \n\n3\n9\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fPre-Primary\n\nPrimary\n\nSecondary \n\nNon-formal Capacity Development\n\n  Multilateral Donors\n\nPPT A for Higher Education \nSector Development \nProgram; $1m, Grant, \n2009\u20132010\n\nDONOR COORDINATION MATRIX \n\n2nd Lower Secondary Education \nDevelopment Project, $55m, Loan, \n2004\u20132010: Upper Secondary \nEducation Development Project, \n$55m, Loan, 2002\u20132009: Technical \nand Vocational Education Project, \n$50m, Loan, 1999\u20132008: Secondary \nEducation Sector Master Plan, \n$600,000, Grant, 2006\u20132010: \nCapacity Development for Upper \nSecondary Education, $420,000, \nGrant, 2003\u20132004, LSE for the Most \nDisadvantaged Regions Project, \n$50m, Loan, 2007\u20132013\n\nSecondary Education Sector Master \nPlan, Advisory Support, 2006\u20132010\n\nTeacher \nTraining\n\nTeacher Training \nProject, $25m, Loan, \n1999\u20132007: Upper \nSecondary and \nProfessional Teacher \nDevelopment Project, \n$33m, Loan, \n2006\u20132011                   \n\nPolicy Research on \nTeacher \nManagement, Grant, \n2005\u20132008\n\nEducation for \nAll, $96,000, \nGrant, \n2001\u20132010\n\nEducational Innovation for \nDevelopment Program, \nn.a.

Poverty is associated with poor access to \neducation  and  illiteracy,  and  lack  of  basic  education  excludes  the  uneducated  from  economic \nopportunities and limits access to higher incomes.  \n \n2. \nViet Nam has made great progress in improving the quality of education at the primary \nand  secondary  levels,  and  national  statistics  show  little  difference  in  school  achievement \nbetween boys and girls. However, national statistics do not reflect the differences, including the \ngender  gap,  between  ethnic  groups  and  regions,  especially  between  ethnic-minority  girls  and \nboys in poor districts. While the national net enrollment rate for lower secondary school (LSS) is \n80%, in the Northwest provinces, where 39% of the people remain poor, the net enrollment rate \nis only 60%, and only 73% of the women are literate, compared with 90% of the men.  \n \n3. \nThe cost of education is a key reason cited for the lower schooling outcomes of the poor \nand  ethnic  minorities.  In  recent  years,  the  cost  of  schooling  has  increased  by  47%,  adversely \naffecting  the  access  of  the  poor  and  girls  to  education.  Average  expenditure  on  education  in \nschool year 2005\u20132006 increased in comparison with 2003\u201320042 and, on average, households \npaid  D1.211  million  per  person.  School  fees,  expenditure  for  extra  classes,  and  other \neducational expenditure accounted for large proportions of education expenditure of household \nmembers.  Costs  also  include  school  supplies,  clothes,  and  adequate  food.  For  the  poorest \nquintile, education expenditure represents 6%\u20137% of total household expenditure. A survey of \nProgram 135  communes  gave  the  following  main  reasons  for  dropping  out  of  school  or  not \nattending  school  (i) cost  of  education  (62%),  (ii) unwillingness  to  attend  school  (59%),  and \n(iii) the need to work (27%) (footnote 2). \n \n4. \nConditional  cash  transfers  (CCTs)  have  generated  significant  attention  in  addressing \neducation attendance and outcomes by compensating the parents for the cost of sending their \nchildren to school. As the findings from the 2006 Viet Nam Household Living Standard Survey \n(VHLSS)  suggest  that  the  opportunity  costs  of  sending  children  to  school  are  high,  financial \nincentives  such  as  CCTs  could  be  effective  in  addressing  education  access  and  outcomes. \nHowever,  in  addition  to  demand-side  issues  of  school  enrollment  and  attendance  related  to \nfinancial barriers, the quality of schools and distance to them must be addressed.  \n \n5. \nPilot  conditional  cash  transfer  program  in  communities.  The  proposed  pilot \ncommunity CCT program for Viet Nam\u2019s lower secondary students is aimed at reducing extreme \npoverty  and  hunger  among  families,  and  improving  the  human  capital  of  children  of  poor \nhouseholds.  The  pilot  program  will  also  address  supply  gaps  in  the  subsector  through \ncommunity participation and school block grants. The Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) \nhas  gained  significant  experience  in  implementing  targeted  programs  for  the  poor  and  is  in  a \nposition to implement the proposed community CCT program. The proposed program will also \ntake advantage of the high social capital in rural areas that has proven to be a great source of \nassistance, enabling communities to take collective action to tackle common demand-side and \nsupply-side problems to improve access to services.  \n\n                                                 \n1  A more detailed description is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n2  Ministry of Labor. 2006. Household Survey. Hanoi. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n53\n\nB.  Description of the Pilot Program \n\n6. \nThe  community  CCT program  will  provide grants to  households  and LSSs conditioned on \nthe  completion  of  education  activities  (households)  and  the  improvement  of  education  conditions \n(communities  and  schools). It  will  involve two  kinds of  grants:  household grants  and school  block \ngrants. \n \n7. \nHouseholds grants. The household grant will provide cash (about $120 per student per \nyear for 4 years) to extreme poor families with children 11\u201314 years of age on the condition that \nthe children enroll in LSSs and attend at least 85% of classes. The cash transfers will be made \nevery  quarter  and  will  be  paid  to  mothers  or  those  responsible  for  the  care  of  children,  upon \nverification that the families have met the conditions. A slightly higher allocation will be given if a \nstudent is a girl (about $140 per year for 4 years).  \n \n8. \nTo  receive  the  initial  grant,  households  must  sign  an  agreement  with  the  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  that  they  are  willing  to  abide  by  the  conditions  of  the  program. \nContinuation of the grant is based on regular attendance in classes (85% of classes), as verified \nby  the  school  boards.  The  grant  will  be  paid  to  mothers  whose  children  have  completed  the \nrequired attendance of over 85% of school classes. If the mother is not present in the household, \nthe payment will be made to the household head. The grant will be given for all LSS students in \nthe household who fulfill the conditions regardless of the LSS year attended, excluding students \ncurrently  receiving  scholarships.  However,  if  a  household  has  three  students  in  LSS  and  only \none is on scholarship, the two remaining students will be eligible for the CCT program. \n \nSchool  block  grants.  The program will also provide block grants to participating LSSs \n9. \nto  address  supply-side  concerns  such  as  teacher  availability  (lodging  houses  for  teachers), \ntextbooks, classrooms, and sanitary facilities. The use of the block grant will be determined by a \nschool\u2013community board composed of representatives of MOET (the local bureau of education \nand  training),  commune  administration,  school  administration,  parents\u2019  association,  Viet  Nam \nWomen\u2019s  Union,  and  ethnic  minority  groups.  The  size  of  the  block  grant  will  depend  on  the \npopulation  size  of  the  commune.  The  average  amount  is  $5,000  per  school  for  4  years.  A \ncondition for participation in the program is the communities\u2019 commitment to improve education \nconditions.  \n \n10. \nThe  grant  will  be  used  to  improve  the  quality  of  education and  ensure that  supply-side \nissues are addressed. The use of the funds will be decided by the school board, after a review \nof the results of a supply-side assessment done at the start of the program. Examples of eligible \nactivities or investments include but are not limited to: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\npaying  the  transportation  costs  of  teachers  or  teaching  assistants  from  ethnic \nminority groups; \nproviding housing for teachers or teaching assistants from ethnic minority groups; \nimproving living and housing conditions in boarding or semi-boarding schools; \nimproving the water and sanitation facilities in schools; \nimproving infrastructure and facilities for schools and teachers, such as physical \ninfrastructure  (solid  construction  for  walls,  floors,  and  roofs),  adequate  lighting, \nand  teaching  aids  (such  as  blackboard  per  classroom,  tables  and  chairs,  and \ninstructional materials); \ncontracting private providers or nongovernment organizations to provide services \nin villages; \nsupporting community mobilization and social pressure toward current nonusers; \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nproviding  small  access  infrastructure  such  as  roads  and  bridges,  which  lead  to \neducation service; \nassisting with transportation costs and educational materials for lower secondary \nschooling; and \nproviding teaching aids and instructional materials (textbooks, teaching manuals, \nand other guides). \n\nSize  of  the  program.  The  program  will  begin  in  the  school  year  of  2011  for  about \n\n \n11. \nAlthough  the  block  grants  can  be  used  for  anything  villagers  collectively  agree  on,  the \nfunds  must  be  used  to  improve  the  conditionalities.  Service  use  and  coverage  of  these \nconditionalities will be closely monitored and recorded. All schools must also develop operations \nand maintenance plans for the school grant investments. \n \nThe  program  will  be  implemented  by  MOET  under  the  direction  of  a  steering  committee \n12. \ncomposed  of  MOET;  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  Invalids,  and  Social  Affairs;  and  the  Ministry  of \nPlanning  and  Investment.  The  project  management  unit  for  the  Secondary  Education  Sector \nDevelopment  Program  will  support  the  steering  committee.  The  departments  of  education  and \ntraining  at  the  provincial  level  will  support  the  program  implementation  in  the  field.  Community \nschool boards will take the lead in the implementation of the community CCT program. They will \nbe primarily  responsible  for ensuring that beneficiaries  are selected  properly, cash transfers  are \ndone  in  a  timely  and  adequate  manner,  verification  of  conditions  is  undertaken,  complaints  and \ngrievances  are  resolved,  adequate  educational  services  exist  or  are  provided,  and  that  families \nand schools meet the conditions of the program.  \n \n13. \n3,000\u20133,500 school-age children and 35\u201340 LSSs in the poorest districts in 10 poor provinces.  \n \n14. \nTargeting  of  beneficiaries.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  current  antipoverty  programs  rely  heavily  on \ngeographic  targeting  of  poor  households.  The  main  instrument  used  in  targeting  the  poor  is  a \ncombination of commune-level vetting and the VHLSS.  \n \n15. \nEligible  households  must  meet  the  following  criteria.  They  must  (i) reside  in  the \ncommunes  selected  for  the  CCT  pilot  program;  (ii) be  considered  \u201cpoor\u201d  according  to  the \ndefinition  in  the  latest  (2006)  VHLSS  (per  capita  income  of  D250,000);  (iii) have  children  from \n11 to  14  years  of  age  or  older  who  are  willing  to  undergo  lower  secondary  schooling;  and \n(iv) agree to meet their obligations under the program. \n \nIn determining eligible families, MOET will follow a multistep process. First, it will select \n16. \nthe  poorest  provinces  and  districts.  The  selection  has  already  been  made  by  the  General \nStatistics Office and is being used in the ongoing Program 135. Second, it will select the poorest \ncommunes  within  the  districts.  This  will  be  done  in  coordination  with  provincial  and  commune \npeople\u2019s councils and departments. Finally, it will select households within the communes that \nmeet the above eligibility criteria. The selection of beneficiary households will be based on three \nkey  factors:  (i)  information  from  the  provincial  people\u2019s  committees  and  commune  people\u2019s \ncommittees (CPCs), (ii) degree of poverty as certified by CPCs (under the 2006 VHLSS), and \n(iii) a  rapid  survey  by  the  school  boards.  This  list  will  be  prepared  by  the  provincial  people\u2019s \ncommittees and CPCs, in coordination with the district Bureau of Education and Training offices, \nand reviewed by the school boards. \n \nFrom  the  areas  selected  for  household  beneficiaries,  data  from  LSSs  will  be  gathered \n17. \nfrom the heads of schools in order to choose beneficiary schools for school grants. The data will \nconsist of information on educational attainment, school enrollment, attendance, promotion, and \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n55\n\ndropout and completion rates. About two schools will be selected to receive the school grants in \neach  district.  A  ranking  will  be  developed  for  the  schools  and  those  with  a  large  number  of \nstudents from poor households or CCT beneficiaries will be identified. Large gaps that emerge \nin the rapid assessment will be prioritized.  \n  \n18. \nPayments  to  beneficiary  mothers  will  generally  be  made  at  3-month  intervals.  The  first \npayment  to  households,  however,  will  be  only  for  the  first  month  and  will  be  made  upon  the \nsigning  of  the  agreement  with  the  central  project  management  unit  (CPMU)  and  the  school \nboards.  This  payment  will  help  households  enroll  their  children  in  schools.  Subsequent \npayments will be conditional. Payment to schools will be based on plans submitted to the CPMU \nand will be in two tranches of 50% each, conditioned on progress in completing funded activities.  \n \n\nTable A8: Payment and Condition Schedule \n \n\nHousehold Grant \n\nSchool Grant \n\nCondition / requirement \n\nPayment \n\nCondition/Requirement \n\nSigning of Agreement \n\nFirst 50% \n\nSecond:D612,000/child  Enrollment \n\nSecpmd 40% \n\nPayment \nA.

The  community  CCT  will  follow  a  cycle  consisting  of  five  main  stages: \n(i) information dissemination, (ii) school board planning and selection, (iii) distribution of grants, \n(iv) verification of compliance with conditions, and (v) performance monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n20. \nThe  information  dissemination  stage  will  provide  an  orientation  on  the  project \nbackground to provincial, district, and commune administrators, school administrators, parents\u2019 \nassociations, and representatives of the Viet Nam Women\u2019s Union and ethnic minorities in the \nlocalities where the program will be implemented. The rationale, objectives, and process flow of \nthe program will be discussed with the different groups, and their responsibilities in the program \nclarified.  This  stage  will  culminate  in  the  creation  of  a  school  board  composed  of  the  different \ngroups involved in the program. \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n21. \nSchool boards will then take the lead in assessing the qualifications of households and \nLSSs to become beneficiaries of the program. They will also plan activities for the target schools \nto  be  financed  from  the  school  block  grants.  Schools  boards  will  also  approve  subsequent \nreleases of funds to households and school administrators. \n \n22. \nThe  grants  will  be  distributed  in  tranches.  For households,  an  initial  1-month  allocation \nwill  be  given  upon  the  signing  of  their  agreement  with  the  program  and  its  conditions. \nSubsequent releases will be based on compliance with the condition of enrollment and school \nattendance.  Schools  will  receive  grants  based  on  the  plans  submitted  and  approved  by  the \nDOET. Subsequent releases will depend on the progress of funded activities. \n \nVerification of compliance will occur between the first and subsequent fund releases. This \n23. \nwill be initiated by teachers (for school attendance) and the school administrators (for school block \ngrant activities). Compliance will be reviewed by the school boards and appropriate action will be \ndecided by them to assist households and schools in case of difficulties in meeting conditions. \n \n24.  Monitoring  and  evaluation.  In  collaboration  with  the  Government  Statistics  Office,  an \nimpact  evaluation  of  the  program  will  be  developed  to  measure  program  benefits.  Community \nCCT  areas  and  households  will  be compared  with  similar  but  nonparticipating  communes  and \nfamilies. Before the program starts, a baseline survey measuring consumption, education, and \nother  socioeconomic  variables  will  be  conducted  for  a  random  sample  of  beneficiary  and \nnon-beneficiary  families  and  LSSs.  This  will  determine  the  baseline  indicators  against  which \nprogress  will  be  measured.  The  program  will  also  have  a  monitoring  component  to  track \nprogress in implementation, and compliance with conditions.  \n \n25. \nGrievance  and  complaints  resolution.  Households  and  communities  can  direct  their \nquestions or complaints to the PMU or directly to the school board, to representatives of parents \nand  ethnic  minority  groups,  or  school  administrators.  The  school  board  will  function  as  a \ncomplaints  handling  unit.  Noncompliance  with  the  conditions  of  the  program  and  the  of \nresources for activities other than those approved will be penalized.  \n \nPenalties will take the form of warning, temporary suspension, or permanent suspension \n26. \nfrom the benefits of the program. A warning will be issued to mothers or other household heads \nand schools that do not meet commitments after one payment cycle. Temporary suspension will \nbe imposed on mothers or other household heads and schools that fail to meet the conditions \nfor two consecutive payment cycles. Mothers and schools may however request readmission to \nthe  program.  In  all  cases,  the  school  board  will  investigate  the  cause  of  noncompliance  and \ndevelop  an  action  plan  with  the  mother  and  school  administrator  to  assist  the  household  or \nschool in complying with conditions. Permanent suspension will be imposed on households and \nschools that fail to meet conditions after 1 year. No readmission will be allowed in this case.  \n\nD. \n\nCost and Financing \n\nTotal  Cost:  $3  million.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe  Government  of  Viet  Nam  recognizes  secondary  education  as  one  of  the  principal  mechanisms  for \nachieving  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction  and  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  The \nSecondary  Education  Sector  Development  Program  (SESDP)  supports  Viet  Nam\u2019s  5-year  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010, which targets universal secondary education as a key priority. Special \nemphasis is placed on reaching ethnic minorities in remote areas for equitable and inclusive development. Key \ntargets include (i) universal upper secondary education in all provinces, (ii) a reduction in poverty to 10%\u201311% \nof households, (iii) an increase to 90% in the net enrollment rate among children of lower secondary school \nage,  and  (iv)  an  increase  to  more  than  50%  in  the  net  enrollment  rate  among  children  of  upper  secondary \nschool  age.  The  Secondary  Education  Sector  Master  Plan  2006\u20132010  identifies  three  core  issues:  (i) \npersistent  inequality  of  access  to  schooling,  (ii)  weak  system  and  strategies  for  improving  the  quality  of \nteaching and learning, and (iii) lack of an accountability framework for effective delivery.  \n \nThe country partnership strategy (CPS) for Viet Nam 2007\u20132010a of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is \ndirectly  linked  to  supporting  the  SEDP\u2019s  targeted  outcomes,  including  expanded  access  to  good-quality \nservices, especially for ethnic minorities. The Program responds to both Government and ADB priorities by \nsupporting fundamental legal and policy reforms related to improving secondary education in Viet Nam.  \n \nB. \nDevelopment Goals (TI-M) \n1.    Key Issues  \n\nPoverty Analysis         Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention\u2013non-income Millennium \n\nViet Nam continues to make impressive progress in poverty reduction and socioeconomic development and \nthe  national  poverty  rate  has  fallen  from  58.1%  in  1993  to  less  than  20%  in  2007.  Viet  Nam  has  already \nachieved the poverty target under the MDGs and is on track to achieve most of the MDG targets by 2015. \nMost  human  development  indicators  have  risen  steadily  and  are  now  comparable  with  those  of \nmiddle-income countries.  \n\nDespite  the steady  progress reflected  in  national statistics,  wide  variations  and  inequities persist.  In  2006, \n20.4%  of  rural  households  were  poor,  compared  with  3.9%  of  urban  households,  and  52.3%  of  ethnic \nminorities were poor compared with 10.3% of ethnic Kinh and Chinese households. In 2006, close to 9% of \nrural  households  and  29%  of  ethnic  minority  households  also  suffered  hunger  during  some  periods  of  the \nyear.  While  the  urban  poverty  rate  is  relatively  low,  it  also  appears  to  have  stagnated  or  even  increased, \nsuggesting that economic growth alone will not reduce poverty in urban centers, and that inflation and other \nfactors may be pushing more people below the poverty line. Households whose consumption is just over the \npoverty  line  are  vulnerable  to  external  shocks  and  remain  at  risk  of  falling  back  below  the  poverty  line, \nparticularly in the current global financial environment.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPoverty,  particularly  among  minority  groups,  is  closely  associated  with  low  or  limited  access  to  education. \nThe main barriers to access are lack of infrastructure, physical inaccessibility, language and cultural barriers, \nlack of good-quality teachers, curricula that are not suited to local needs or languages, and high costs. The \nopportunity  costs  for  many  ethnic  minority  and  poor  families  of  sending  their children  to secondary  school \nversus  working  for  the  family  are  high.  Fee  exemption  policies  are  often  insufficient  to  cover  all \neducation-related costs associated with attending secondary education and many families cannot afford to \nsend  their  children  to  school  because  of  these  financial  constraints.  The  financial  obligations  are  only \nexacerbated  in  rural  and  remote  regions  of  the  country,  and  this  places  a  large  burden  on  already \ncash-strapped families. Financial constraints were among the top two reasons students from 42 provinces in \n2004 were unable to attend school. \n \n\n \n\n\f74 \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n2. Design Features \n \nThe  Program  supports  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  and social  development  goals  by  supporting a \nmore  equitable  distribution  of  high-quality  secondary  education.  It  will  provide  direct  benefits  to \nethnic-minority  and  poor  students  by  increasing  access  to  and  affordability  of  lower  secondary  education \n(LSE). The pilot conditional cash transfer (CCT) will address demand-side constraints and alleviate the direct \nand indirect costs of education. It will improve the human capital of children of poor households and reduce \nintergenerational poverty in the future. The pilot program will also address supply gaps in the sector through \ncommunity participation and school block grants, and community awareness-raising activities will focus on \ndemonstrating the benefits of school participation. The pilot program is expected to have significant impact \nin reducing poverty for poor households, increasing school attendance, increasing transition rates from lower \nsecondary school (LSS) to upper secondary school (USS), increasing the years of education completed by \npoor children, and reducing child labor.  \n         \nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nThe  policy  reforms  included  in  the  Program  are  expected  to  positive  impact,  especially  for  the  poor  and \nthose living in remote areas.  \n \n\nThe new national standards for secondary schools will ensure that all schools have appropriate \nlevels of school buildings and facilities and provision of adequate numbers of quality instructional \nmaterials. This is especially important in rural areas, where costs of education are often higher \nbut incomes lower. The updated school standards will ensure that no matter where a school is \nbuilt, it will meet national standards for effective teaching and learning.  \n \nThe human resource management framework will ensure that teacher placements are matched \nto  need  and  that  teachers,  particularly  those  who  live  and  work  in  difficult  conditions,  are \nrewarded for efforts and effectiveness.  \n \nThe Decision on Regulations and Roles for Continuing Education Centers redefines the function \nof and quality standards for continuing education and will promote greater equity of opportunities \nfor disadvantaged youth. Continuing education has been a key alternative learning opportunity \nfor disadvantaged youth who cannot access or remain in the regular LSSs because of poverty, \nlong distance to school, or the need to engage in seasonal labor. However, poor quality of the \nprograms  and  limited  facilities,  which  cannot  absorb  increasing  demand,  have  been  a  key \nobstacle to the universalization of LSE. \n \nThe  Decision  on  an  \u201cinclusive  approach\u201d  to  special  education  will  ensure  that  more  disabled \nstudents are able to gain access to mainstream schools. \n \nCCTs will promote poverty reduction and enhanced access to education for poor families.  \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nPoverty  rates  and  education  indicators  lag  substantially  behind  in  the  Northwest  and  Central  Highlands \nregions,  in  rural  areas,  and  among  the  most  marginalized  ethnic  groups.  Viet  Nam  has  54  officially \nrecognized ethnic groups, with the ethnic Kinh composing over 86%. Except for the ethnic Chinese, Khmer, \nand Cham, ethnic minorities reside mainly in remote, mountainous, and other disadvantaged areas. While \nthey represent less than 15% of the population, these minorities accounted for 44% of the poor and 59% of \nthe hungry in 2006. Viet Nam\u2019s ethnic minorities are extremely heterogeneous, and their relative positions \nappear  to  be  shifting  significantly.  While  the  ethnic  Chinese,  Khmer,  and  Cham  have  improved  theire \nposition  relative  to  the  Kinh  majority,  the  relative  positions  of  several  Northern  and  Central  Highlands \nminority  groups  have  actually  worsened.  Poor  access  to  health  care  and  education,  lack  of  good-quality \nfarmland  in  upland  areas,  limited  access  to  markets,  and  lack  of  fluency  in  the  Vietnamese  language  are \ncontributing factors. These findings underscore the importance of tailoring the activities under the Program \nto the different needs and constraints of the most marginalized ethnic minority groups. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 17 \n\n75 \n\nThere  is  a  significant  gap  in  access  to  secondary  education  between  students  living  in  remote  and \nmountainous  regions  and  those  residing  in  delta  regions.  Grade  repetition  and  dropout  rates  are  much \nhigher  in  mountainous  and  rural  regions  than  in  predominantly  delta  and  urban  areas.  There  is  also  a \nrecognizable  quality  education  gap  between  these  regions,  including  disparities  in  teacher  training, \ninfrastructure  standards,  and  curricular  offerings  (e.g.,  information  technology,  textbook  availability,  and \naccess  to  electricity).  There  is  also  a  gap  between  rural  and  urban  areas.  Economic  opportunities  and \nperceived improvements in the quality of life in urban and costal-port regions draw large numbers of migrant \nfamilies  from  remote  mountainous  and  rural  regions  of  the  country.  While  the  overall  national  secondary \neducation student cohort is decreasing over time, student enrollments in urban centers are increasing. This \nurban  increase  is  projected  through  the  next  two  decades,  with  the  addition  of  up  to  1  million  people \nmigrating  to  major  urban  areas  by  the  year  2020.  This  population  shift  to  follow  greater  job  opportunities \nincludes  a  major  education  component.  While  not  all  migrant  workers  bring  their  families  with  them  to  the \ncities, many do. The dropout rate among unregistered migrant secondary education students is four times \nhigher than among regular residents in urban centers. \n \nThere  is  also  disparity  between  female  and  male  enrollments  at  all  levels,  and  especially  at  the  lower \nsecondary level. While education gender disparity has declined in recent years, it persists among all ethnic \ngroups and geographic regions. There are generally no differences in the percentage of students attending \nsecondary  schools  between  Kinh  and  ethnic  minority  males  (roughly  73%  for  both),  but  there  is  a \n10 percentage  point  difference  in  female  enrollments  by  ethnicity  (71%  for  Kinh  and  61%  for  ethnic \nminorities). This gender gap varies between ethnic groups and geographic region, but several study findings \nand  multiple  consultations  identify  ethnic  minority  females  as  the  most  disadvantaged  group  at  the \nsecondary education level. Semi-boarding at school is particularly difficult for girls because of security and \nprivacy concerns. Sociocultural factors also play a role in keeping girls out of school: minority girls tend to \nmarry early,  especially in  the Hmong culture. Many children drop out of school in  the absence of parental \nencouragement and discipline, and when parents do not see the relevance of education they do not object. \nOpportunity costs become higher as children enter their teens and are needed for agricultural work, or family \ncare in the case of girls.  \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n \n1. Consultation and participation process during the project preparation: \n\nStakeholders  have  been  actively  engaged  in  the  design  of  the  Program  through  individual  consultations, \nworkshops, and field visits to secondary schools, to provincial and district education departments, and with \nstudents,  parents  and  teachers,  village  residents,  and  other  key  informants.  Consultation  workshops  with \nnational and provincial stakeholders were organized to review policy and design issues.  \n \n2.  What  level  of  consultation  and  participation  (C&P)  is  envisaged  during  the  project  implementation  and \nmonitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.

Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues \n \nDespite considerable progress in key education outcomes as reflected in national statistics, there are wide \nvariations  and  persistent  inequities  in  health  indicators  between  regions  and  province,  between  the  urban \nand  rurals,  and  and  between  ethnic  groups.  Women  and  adolescent  girls  in  poor,  remote,  and \nethnic-minority  communities,  and  migrant  women,  are  particularly  affected  by  the  limited  access  to \neducational  opportunities.  Gender  in  the  education  workforce  varies  by  level  and  subject.  While  there  has \nbeen progress in increasing the number of female teachers and administrators in all education subsectors, \n\n \n\n\f76 \n\nAppendix 17 \n\nthere remains a significant gender gap nationwide in some key positions, including principals of LSS, USS, \nand  professional  secondary  schools.  There  is  a  negative  correlation  between  school  level  and  female \nadministrators: the higher the school level, the fewer the number of females in administrative positions.  \n    \n2.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n\na ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program Viet Nam 2007\u20132010. Manila. \n\n  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 18 \n\n77\n\nGENDER AND ETHNIC MINORITY ACTION PLAN \n \n\n1. \nA gender and ethnic minority action plan (GEMAP) has been prepared to ensure that the \nProgram  fully  supports  gender  equality,  ethnic  inclusion  and  equity.  The  GEMAP  aims  to \nintegrate  equity  concerns  in  all  outputs  of  the  Program.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all \nactivities under the Program are consistent with the Gender Equality Law. The GEMAP is based \non  a  poverty  and  social  analysis  of  the  education  sector.  It  is  in  accordance  with  current \nViet Nam  laws,  policies,  and  regulations  and  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  Policy  on \nGender and Development (1998) and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \n\nA. \n\nInstitutional and Legal Framework  \n\n2. \nA  strong  policy  and  institutional  environment  supporting  gender  equality  has  been \ninstrumental  in  empowering  Vietnamese  women  and  reducing  gender  gaps.  The  National \nCommittee  for  the  Advancement  of  Women  is  the  formal  state  machinery  responsible  for \npromoting gender equality. It is a high-level multi-sectoral committee that reports directly to the \nPrime  Minister.  The  Vietnam  Women\u2019s  Union  is  a  mass-based  organization  for  women  that \nfacilitates  the  implementation  of  projects  and  programs  at  the  local  level,  in  addition  to \nrepresenting their members in national policy dialogue. The newly issued Gender Equality Law \n(2007) provides leverage for addressing priority gender issues by redressing gender disparities \nin  existing  laws,  calling  for  gender  mainstreaming  in  public  administration,  and  providing  for \ntargets and quotas for women\u2019s participation in decision making. \n \n3. \nunder the Project. \n \n\nTable  A18  summarizes  the  proposed  actions  for  gender  equity  and  ethnic  minorities \n\nTable A18: Gender and Ethnic Minority Action Plan \n \n\nOutput \nA.
