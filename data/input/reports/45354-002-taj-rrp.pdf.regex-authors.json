I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nadministration of a grant to be provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategic Climate \nFund1 to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Building Climate Resilience in the Pyanj River Basin \nProject.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n2.  Tajikistan is considered to be one of the Central Asian countries most vulnerable to the \nadverse effects of climate change. It frequently experiences extreme climate events such as \nintense  spring  rainfall,  excessive  melt-waters  from  large  snow  accumulations,  droughts,  and \noccasionally devastating glacial lake outburst floods. These cause mudflows, floods, reduced water \navailability, avalanches, landslides, and rockfalls.  \n3.  With a population of approximately 1.27 million, the Pyanj River Basin (114,500 square \nkilometers) is the largest of the five principal basins of Tajikistan (Pyanj, Vakhsh, Kafernigan, \nZerevshan, and Syr Darya). It has a large range of altitude, from 300\u2013350 meters (m) in the semi-\narid lowlands of southern Khatlon to more than 7,000 m in the Pamir and Hindu-Kush mountains. It \nis also the bread-basket of Tajikistan, containing a large portion of the country\u2019s agricultural land. \nCommunities located in the Pyanj River Basin are already experiencing extreme climatic events.3 \nIn  the  mountainous  Gorno  Badakhsan  oblast  (province),  droughts,  avalanches,  landslides, \nrockfalls, and violent winds are routine events which disrupt social and economic life, damage \nhouses and infrastructure, and erode land. Occasional but devastating flash floods are released \nwhen temporary glacial lakes, created by glacier surges in the Pamir Mountains, burst without \nwarning (glacier lake outburst flood). In the hills, lowlands, and flood plains of the eastern Khatlon \nregion, droughts caused by decreased snowfall, and mudflows and floods caused by intense \nspring rain, occur annually. These hazards routinely destroy land, crops, and infrastructure and, in \nthe worst cases, take lives. \n4.  Recent studies (footnote 3) indicated that projected rise in temperature of up to 2 degree \nCelsius by 2050 will result in glacial melt and early snow melt. The runoff peak is likely to shift from \nthe current late spring and early summer towards late winter and early spring runoff regime. This \nshift has significant repercussions for farming practices and water resources management because \nit leads to a major water deficit during the crop growing season. Increasing risks from hazards such \nas catastrophic flooding due to glacial lake outbursts, destabilizations of mountain slopes, and \nmore landslides will result in a progressive increase in economic losses and risk to the population, \nand reduce the ability of communities located in the Pyanj River Basin to move out of poverty. \nThese  adverse  effects  will  be  exacerbated  by  an  increase  in  water  demand  resulting  from \nincreased  evapotranspiration  and  a  projected  25%  population  increase  by  2050.4  Water \ninfrastructure in the Pyanj River Basin is in a state of disrepair. Irrigation systems and flood \n                                                \n1  Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience financed by the Strategic Climate Fund. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3 ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to Tajikistan for Climate Resiliency for Natural Resources Investments. Manila \n(Phase 1 of the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience); ADB. 2010.

World Population Prospects: \nThe 2010 Revision. New York. ", "2      \n \nprotection  need  major  repair,  and  safe  drinking  water  is  often  inaccessible.  Planning  and \nmaintenance capacity at the jamoat (subdistrict) and community level is very weak. Financial \nresources for subsector-specific development planning and operation and maintenance (O&M) are \nabsent. National and local institutions lack climate change risk management skills. In addition, the \nPyanj River Basin faces particular development challenges arising from the high rate of out-\nmigration  by  males  and  the  consequent  prevalence  of  households  headed  by  women.  Main \nbarriers to climate resilience include the lack of information on climate change impacts on water \nresources, limited availability of financial resources to introduce resilient practices, absence of risk \ntransfer mechanisms, and limited women\u2019s involvement in decision making.   \n5.  As a result of its high exposure and its limited capacity to anticipate and manage climate \nchange risks, Tajikistan is a beneficiary of the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience\u2015a multilateral \nprogram financed by the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF) that aims to increase climate resilience in \ndeveloping countries. Building climate change resilience in the Pyanj River Basin was identified as \na priority in the extensive consultations5 that the government has conducted in partnership with \nADB, the World Bank, and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development since 2009, as \npart of the first phase of the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience. Priorities identified include the \nneed for a better coordinated and strategic approach to water resources management in the Pyanj \nRiver  Basin,  encompassing  (i)  improved  access  to  water  resources  through  climate-resilient \ninfrastructure for irrigation, drainage, water supply, and storage; (ii) increased resilience to extreme \nclimate events through flood protection, early warning systems, and risk transfer mechanisms; and \n(iii) improved access to information and financial resources, particularly for women. \n6.  The proposed project is consistent with the Tajikistan country partnership strategy, 2010\u2013\n20146 and is included in the Tajikistan country operations business plan, 2013\u20132014.7 This project \nis also in line with ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework, Strategy 2020.8 The project design reflects \nlessons from previous ADB interventions in the country.9 \nB.  Impact and Outcome  \n7.  The  project\u2019s  impact  will  be  improved  livelihoods  of  Pyanj  River  Basin  communities \nvulnerable to climate variability and change. The project\u2019s outcome will be reduced adverse effects \nof climate variability and climate change in 59 villages in 19 jamoats in the Pyanj River Basin. \nC.  Outputs \n8.  The project has four outputs. Output 1 is flood protection infrastructure climate-proofed in 10 \njamoats.10 It will (i) upgrade and climate-proof flood and mudflow protection infrastructure in 10 \nlocations, including riverbank reinforcement, embankment reconstruction, restoration of stream \nbeds, terracing and planting of trees, and soil stabilization; (ii) establish O&M practices, develop \n                                                \n5  The consultations engaged over 1,400 stakeholders from government agencies, international organizations, donors, \ncivil society, and communities living in the Pyanj River Basin.  \n6  ADB. 2010.

The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will lend a total of $2.8 million in somoni equivalent of the \ngrant  to  PFIs  that  meet  ADB\u2019s  eligibility  criteria  (paragraph  16)  and  have  demonstrated  a \nwillingness and ability to design and offer microfinance loans and deposits in the Pyanj River \nBasin.12 PFIs will lend these funds to individuals and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises \n(subborrowers)  to  finance  investment  activities  (subprojects)  that  meet  ADB\u2019s  eligibility  and \nsafeguards requirements. PFIs will provide a minimum of 10% of each subloan amount, increasing \nthe total amount made available to subborrowers to at least $3 million equivalent. Relending to the \nPFIs will be based on a 5-year repayment term and an interest rate based on the prevailing \nNational Bank of Tajikistan refinancing rate.13 Subloans to subborrowers will (i) cover a maximum \nof 90% of the eligible subproject cost; (ii) be for amounts of  up to TJS150,000; (iii) have a \nrepayment term of up to 5 years; and (iv) carry a market-based interest rate. At least 50% of the \nsubloans will be for amounts of TJS5,000 or less, and at least 30% of the total number of subloans \nwill  be  to  women  or  organizations  having  substantial  female  ownership.  PFIs  will  undertake \nindependent assessment of subborrowers, including creditworthiness. All proposed subloans in \nexcess of TJS100,000 will require ADB approval and ADB will undertake prior review of the first \nthree subloans issued by each PFI for each credit line. Following project completion, MOF will \nrecycle the credit line funds for the same purposes as utilized under the project for a minimum \nadditional period of 6 years. ADB and MOF will agree on the ultimate use of the repaid credit lines \nbefore project completion. \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.

An estimated 87 person-months of consulting services will be required to support the PMO \nunder the MOF (10 person-months international, 77 person-months national) to (i) facilitate project \nmanagement and implementation, (ii) strengthen the institutional and operational capacity of the \nexecuting  agency,  (iii)  carry  out  feasibility  studies  and  technical  assessments,  and  (iv)  build \ncapacity of PFIs and potential borrowers and savers. \n20.  Each consulting firm will be engaged using the quality- and cost-based selection method \nwith a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. Full technical proposals will be required for each consulting \nservice  under  the  MLRWR  and  KMK.  Simplified  technical  proposal  will  be  required for  each \nconsulting service under the MOF. Detailed terms of reference for consultants to be engaged \nunder the project are in the project administration manual.  \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n21.  A  climate  vulnerability,  impact,  and  adaptation  assessment  was  carried  out  to  identify \npriority communities that are particularly vulnerable to climate variability and change, with a focus \non water resources. A methodology was developed to identify and rank the most vulnerable \ncommunities, and for each identified community prioritize adaptation measures (subprojects). Key \ncriteria for prioritizing communities included (i) exposure (magnitude and frequency) to climate \nshocks  (drought,  flood,  mudslide,  etc.);  and  (ii)  technical,  financial,  and  human  capacity  to \nanticipate and manage climate risks. Key criteria for prioritizing subprojects included effectiveness \nin reducing climate risks, and replication potential. Community participation, including women, \nensured that perspectives and insights of people whose livelihoods are being affected by changes \nin climate are reflected in the specific adaptation measures under the project. \n22.  A technical feasibility assessment was carried out to assess the technical feasibility of the \nsubprojects, including preliminary engineering design of the infrastructure components. Twenty-two \nsubprojects were selected based on field assessments and local experience, including 10 flood \nand mudflow subprojects, 5 irrigation subprojects, and 7 rural drinking water supply subprojects. \nThe  flood  and  mudflow  subprojects  will  comprise  (i)  constructing  and  upgrading  riverbank \nprotection, including forestation of embankments and soil stabilization; (ii) providing for heavy \nmachinery  to  maintain  the  restored  flood  protection  and  irrigation  facilities;  (iii)  training  local \nauthorities  and  communities,  and  (iv)  establishing  early  warning  systems  and  disaster  risk \nmanagement committees. The irrigation subprojects will comprise (i) modernizing and climate-\nproofing irrigation infrastructure, (ii) modernizing and climate-proofing one existing pumping station \nand upstream delivery canal, (iii) constructing new infrastructure for piped drip-type irrigation, and \n(iv) agricultural extension services and training water users\u2019 associations. The rural drinking water \nsupply subprojects will comprise (i) upgrading ground water sources and protecting them from \nflood risk and contamination, (ii) storage equivalent to 1 day\u2019s demand, (iii) providing dedicated \npumping mains, (iv) upgrading communal water points with self-closing taps, and (v) establishing \nand training water consumer groups. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  The economic internal rate of return for the project was estimated at 18% and the economic \nnet present value at the discount rate of 12% was $7.8 million. The project will bring social \n  ", "8      \n \nbenefits, particularly for poorer beneficiaries, by reducing (i) losses of agricultural land, personal \nproperty, houses, and livestock and consequent damage to family living conditions; (ii) declines in \nincome levels; (iii) emergence of disease; (iv) decrease in agricultural crop yields; (v) deterioration \nof drinking water; and (vi) levels of migration. The project is likely to have a significant positive \nimpact on agricultural productivities, soil and water resources, public health, and rural livelihoods.20 \n24.  Financial  and  integrity  due  diligence  was  conducted  on  four  MFIs  (para.  16).  The \nassessment comprised review of (i) credit and risk management policies, operating systems, and \nprocedures to prudently make loans; (ii) corporate and financial governance and management \npractices; (iii) sound business objectives and strategy; (iv) ability to assess creditworthiness of \nborrowers and determine market-based loan terms; (v) policies and measures for anti-money \nlaundering and combating the financing of terrorism; (vi) environment and social management; and \n(vii) other requirements. As a result, two MFIs have been selected to participate in the project. It \nwill be a condition of disbursement of credit line funds to PFIs that adequate anti-money laundering \nand combating the financing of terrorism customer due diligence measures are in place. \nC.  Governance \n25.  An  assessment carried  out from  January  to March  2013  confirmed that the  executing \nagencies\u2019  procurement  capacity  and  financial  management  capacity  are  sufficient  to  manage \ninternational procurement and funds flow arrangements, accounting, internal and external audits, \nand information. Obstacles identified include less transparent operations, outdated operational \ntools, and a skills gap. Implementation support will be provided by consulting services to ensure \nthat  the  project\u2019s  financial  management,  procurement,  accounting,  monitoring,  reporting,  and \nauditing requirements are met.  \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was discussed with the three \nexecuting agencies and the government. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual.  \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  The project is aligned with Tajikistan\u2019s National Development Strategy, 2007-2015 and \nPoverty Reduction Strategy, 2010\u20132012. It will improve the livelihoods of over 100,000 people in \nthe Pyanj River Basin by reducing and reversing (i) livelihood losses and declining income levels, \n(ii) lack of access to essential services, (iii) employment-related out-migration, and (iv) vulnerability \nto waterborne diseases. Women are particularly vulnerable in the project areas. High rates of male \nmigration have resulted in high engagement of the female population in agriculture. However, \nwomen have little access to financial resources and information to switch to more climate-resilient \nlivelihoods. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming, and includes a gender \naction plan to ensure women are actively involved in, and benefit from, all project components. \nWomen will benefit from the project through improved access to water resources for irrigation and \ndrinking water supply, enhanced knowledge of climate-resilient agriculture, and increased access \nto micro deposits and credit lines for climate-resilient economic activities. The project will assist \nwomen  in  accessing  the  micro  credit  they  need  to  undertake  adaptive  measures  and  build \nresilience; and support the active participation of women in irrigation water users\u2019 association, \ndisaster risk management committees, and drinking water consumer groups. \n                                                \n20 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  The project is classified category B for environment. The infrastructure subprojects are \nexpected to have limited site-specific adverse environmental impacts during both construction and \noperation,  and  are  located  outside  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  Two  initial  environmental \nexaminations have been prepared, one by the MLRWR for the flood protection and irrigation \nsubprojects and one by the KMK for the water supply subprojects, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). Adequate mitigation measures for each subproject will be \nimplemented  through  site-specific  environmental  management  plans  based  on  generic \nenvironmental management plans for water supply, flood management, and irrigation components. \nSite-specific environmental management plans will be prepared by contractors, and approved by \nthe PMO in the MLRWR and the project implementation group in the KMK. Consultants will assist \nthe MLRWR and KMK in strengthening institutional capacity to manage environmental impacts.  \n29.  The  project  is  expected  to  have  only  nonsignificant  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nimpacts and is classified involuntary resettlement category B, according to the ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. The engineering design of the infrastructure subprojects under the project has \nnot yet advanced to a stage where land acquisition and resettlement impacts on individual or \ncollective land users can be identified. A land acquisition and resettlement framework has been \nprepared in lieu of land acquisition resettlement  plans.21 During project implementation, each \nsubproject will be screened for land acquisition and resettlement impacts. For subprojects with \nsuch  impacts,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  in \naccordance with the land acquisition and resettlement framework before the commencement of \ncivil works. For subprojects involving the rehabilitation of existing facilities, due diligence will be \nconducted  to  determine  past  or  present  social  safeguard  concerns  and  to  identify  corrective \nactions, as necessary. Capacity building on social safeguards will be provided to the executing \nagencies through ongoing ADB technical assistance.22  \n30.  The project is classified category C for indigenous peoples. Project preparation activities \nhave determined that there will be no indigenous peoples issues associated with the project. \n31.  Before receiving their first disbursement under the proposed project, PFIs will establish a \nbasic environmental and social management system to screen out subprojects including activities \nlisted in ADB\u2019s Prohibited Investment Activities List and posing more than minimal environmental \nand social risks.23 Each PFI will be required to designate at least one staff member responsible for \nthe  implementation  of  its  environmental  and  social  management  system.  Only  subprojects \ncategorized C for environment and social impacts will be eligible for financing under the project.  \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  The project carries manageable risks that will be mitigated during implementation. Main \nrisks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.24 \n                                                \n21 ADB. 2008.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n33.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, \nprocurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  project \nadministration manual and grant documents. The government, the executing agencies, and the two \nselected PFIs have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the \ngrant agreement and project agreements. \nV.
