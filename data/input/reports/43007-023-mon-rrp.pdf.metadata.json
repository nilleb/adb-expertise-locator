Project interventions include institutional capacity building, human resource \ndevelopment, provision of learning and research facilities, equipment and materials, consultant \nservices,  minor  civil  works, support for  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPP),  and  improvement of \nthe higher education policy environment. \n  \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nfor \n\nRationale \n\nthe  country\u2019s \n\ninvestment  option \n\nA. \n \n3. \nRapid  economic  expansion  has  led  to  increased  demand  and  supply  for  higher \neducation  in  Mongolia.  The  Government  of  Mongolia  has  emphasized  the  value  of  higher \neducation  as  a  principal \nlong-term  economic \ncompetitiveness. The gross enrollment ratio for higher education rose from 27% in 2000 to 47% \nin  2007,  supported  by  private  higher  education  institutions  beginning  in  the  1990s.  Over  100 \nHEIs  are  now  in operation,  but  only  around  40%  of graduates  are  employed.  Persistent  rural\u2013\nurban  inequalities  also  undermine  Mongolia\u2019s  competitiveness  in  higher  education.  Poverty \nserves  to  destabilize  children\u2019s  school  performance  in  rural  areas;  even  if  poor  households \nmanage  to  send  their  children  to  HEIs  in  urban  areas,  there  is  no  guarantee  they  will  be \nemployable after graduation. The government's vision is of an effective higher education system \nthat  can  help  accelerate  sustainable  economic  development,  improve  people's  livelihoods, \nensure social equality, and reduce poverty. However, the system is currently constrained by (i) \nlow  quality  and  relevance;  (ii)  weak  governance  and  management;  (iii)  inadequate  financing; \nand  (iv)  limited  opportunities  in  the  higher  education  subsector,  particularly  for  the  poor  and \nthose in rural areas. \n \n4. \nLow quality and relevance, and weak quality  assurance. Over the last 2 decades\u2014\nas Mongolia progressed from a command to a market economy, and experienced rapid growth \nin  the  higher  education  subsector\u2014higher  education  has  fallen  behind  in  its  mission  of \ndelivering  high-quality  and  relevant  education.  Higher  education  teachers,  program  offerings, \nand  teaching  and  learning  processes  were  unable  to  adapt  to  technological  and  knowledge-\nbased developments, and structural changes in labor market demand. This has led to a growing \nnumber  of  unemployed  graduates,  because  many  HEIs  offer  low-cost,  low-quality  programs \ndesigned  mainly  to  attract  students  and  generate  profit  for  the  HEIs.  The  professionalism  and \nskill levels of higher education graduates are inadequate, and there is a mismatch between HEI \noutputs  and  labor  market  demands.  There  is  little  initiative  by  the  public  higher  education \nsubsector  to  forge  linkages  with  the  business  sector  in  areas  needed  by  industry.  Generally, \ncurriculum development is not given priority in faculty management, and curriculum review is not \nrigorously undertaken within individual HEIs or across the broader higher education system. As \ncurrently  structured,  the  higher  education  system  in  Mongolia  does  not  foster  innovation  or \nprovide skilled labor, thereby constraining knowledge creation. \n\n                                                \n1  The  project  was  prepared  through  a  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  grant  (Asian  Development  Bank \n[ADB].  2009.  Technical  Assistance  to  Mongolia  for  Strengthening  Higher  and  Vocational  Education.  Manila  [TA \n7333-MON, for $600,000, approved on 21 August]). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \nThe National Council for Education Accreditation (NCEA)2 is chaired by the minister who \n5. \nheads the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science (MECS) and many of its board members \nare  themselves  either  owners  or  trustees  of  HEIs,  which  could  lead  to  potential  conflicts  of \ninterest.  While  the  accreditation  process  is  well-defined,  there  are  implementation  lapses  and \nthere is no systematic monitoring of follow-up actions recommended by the external evaluation \nteam.  Moreover,  only  about  40%  of  HEIs  have  national  institutional  accreditation,  as \naccreditation is not mandatory. There is a need to review NCEA policies and practices, ensure \nindependence from government and vested interests, and align business processes according \nto sound corporate governance principles. In view of dynamic changes in the subsector, NCEA \nalso needs to review its institutional setup and capacity, and take stock of whether it is able to \naddress  the  evolving  higher  education  quality  assurance  requirements  and  carry  out  its \nmandate, given the existing organizational setup. \n \n6. \nLow  staff  quality  and  inadequate  learning  and  research  environment.  Most  HEI \nstaff are either inadequately trained or have fallen behind in their qualifications and skills. As a \nconsequence, higher education graduates have inadequate professional expertise and technical \nskills. HEIs remain uncompetitive by international standards in terms of their research capability. \nInternational  partnerships  have  often  resulted  in limited  cooperation,  with  little  or  no  benefit  to \neither  side  because  they  are  seldom  adequately  resourced  or  well  structured.  Teaching \nmethods  and  learning  and  research  environments  need to  be greatly  improved  by  investing  in \nmodern facilities and equipment, and upgrading staff skills through training. \n \n7. \nIneffective governance and management, lack of autonomy, and weak leadership. \nThe  current  HEI  system  in  Mongolia  is  characterized  as  highly  bureaucratic,  because  vital \nacademic,  financial,  and  management  decisions  need  to  be  approved  by  either  MECS  or  the \nprivate  owners  of  HEIs. Their  decision-making  power  is  not  usually  restrained  by  any  external \nbody.  Both  public  and  private  HEIs  lack  a  strong  accountability  mechanism  for  academic  and \nmanagement decisions. In addition, the management of HEIs lack strategic vision, capacity, and \nincentives  to  manage  their  funds  efficiently,  because  there  is  no  system  holding  them \naccountable  for  the  quality  of  the  graduates  trained  in  their  institutions.  The  prevailing \nenvironment surrounding HEIs does not stimulate competition. \n \n8. \nInadequate  financing.  The  bulk  of  the  government's  education  budget  is  allocated  to \nprimary and secondary education; higher education receives just 12% of the amount budgeted \nfor the education sector, leaving HEIs highly dependent on income generated from tuition fees. \nPrivate HEIs receive almost 60% of their funding from tuition fees, and public HEIs almost 58%.3 \nGovernmental pressure on both public and private HEIs keeps tuition fees low, generally below \n$1,000  per  year.  As  a  consequence,  most  HEIs  admit  too  many  students,  many  of  whom  are \nunderqualified  for  higher  education,  in  order  to  generate  sufficient  revenue  to  pay  their \nacademic and administrative staff. Most HEIs lack the financial capacity to attract qualified and \nwell-trained  teachers  and  researchers  and  to  invest  in  up-to-date  equipment,  libraries,  and \nlaboratories. This has led to a low-cost, low-quality higher education system. \n \n\n                                                \n2  Originally established as the National Council for Higher Education Accreditation as per Government Resolution No. \n\n240, 1997, and reconstituted into the NCEA in 2004. \n\n3  Additionally, the state training fund (STF) provides about 28% of funding to higher education through the provision \nof grants and loans to help offset the cost of education for about 40% of  higher education students. However, the \ntargeting  of  these  subsidies  is  sometimes  inappropriate  and  the  STF's  grant  and  loan  mechanisms  need  to  be \nreviewed. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nLack of equity and access. Socioeconomic and gender disparities in access to higher \n9. \neducation  persist,  resulting  in  low  representation  of  males  and  students  from  poor  families, \nespecially in rural areas. The gender imbalance in higher education enrollment favors females \n(60.4%),  while  the  employment  market  favors  males,  with  a  national  labor  force  employment \nrate  of  67.5%  for  males  and  58.3%  for  females.  More  males  are  also  engaged  at  a  decision-\nmaking level. Even in HEIs, a majority of board members are male, and only about 31% of HEI \nmanagement  are  female.  For  disadvantaged  students  (e.g.,  the  poor  and  those  from  rural \nareas),  fundamental  problems  include  a  lack  of  information  on  how  to  avail  the  programs, \ninappropriate  targeting  of  state  subsidies,  bureaucracy,  and  unfriendliness  among  faculty  and \npeers at the local level. \n \nDiscussions  on  higher  education  policy  reforms  have  been  ongoing  for  years.4 In  2009 \n10. \nthe  newly  elected  government  emphasized  the  value  of  higher  education  as  a  principal \ninvestment  option  for  the  country\u2019s  long-term  competitiveness.  With  a  strong  commitment  to \nhigher education reforms, concrete initiatives are now being implemented. These steps include \nreducing  the  numbers  of  public  HEIs5 from  42  to  16,  creating  a  campus  development  plan \n(2010\u20132021)6 for  national  HEIs  to  be  at  par  with  global  standards,  and strengthening  linkages \nbetween  education,  research,  and  business  throughout  Mongolia.  A  major  breakthrough  was \nthe  development  of  the  roadmap  for  higher  education  reform  (2010\u20132021)7 to guide  long-term \npolicy  development  in  the  subsector.  MECS,  with  the  assistance  of  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB),8 is currently proposing amendments to the Law on Higher Education, which include \nimprovements \nframework  on  governance  and  management.  These \namendments aim to strengthen the academic and administrative autonomy of HEIs, which is a \nkey factor in implementing reform initiatives. \n \n11. \nThe  government's  objectives  to  address  these  issues  and  reform  its  higher  education \nsubsector  are  within  the  framework  of  ADB's  country  partnership  strategy  (2011\u20132015,  under \npreparation)  for  Mongolia,  the  Mongolia  country  operations  business  plan  (2011\u20132013,  under \npreparation),  and  Mongolia\u2019s  National  Development  Strategy  2020.  Further,  higher  education \ndevelopment  is  consistent  with  ADB's  Education  Sector  Operations  Plan  by  2020,  in \naccordance  with  the  growing  demand  for  developing  good  tertiary  education  in  ADB's \ndeveloping member counties. \n\nlegislative \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n                                                \n4  ADB.  1996.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loans  and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to Mongolia for the Education Sector Development Program. Manila (Loans 1507-MON \nand  1508-MON  and  TA  2719-MON,  approved  on  19  December)  gave  recommendations  to  improve  higher \neducation but most of the recommendations were never been put into practice. Fundamental reform has not been \nundertaken due to a lack of political will; in 1996 the priority for education sector development was basic education. \n5  The  number  of  HEIs  increased  from  14  public  HEIs  in  1991  to  a  total  of  146  at  the  end  of  2009,  comprising  42 \npublic and 99 private HEIs, and 5 branches of foreign HEIs. The government adopted Resolution No. 15 (dated 20 \nJanuary  2010)  with  the  objective  of  increasing  public  HEI  quality  by  reducing  their  number  and  focusing \ndevelopment resources into fewer, higher-quality HEIs.  \n\n6  Approved by the cabinet on 9 June 2010. \n7  Approved by the cabinet on 7 July 2010. \n8  ADB.  2009.

Manila (TA 7571-MON). \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nB. \n\n Outputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n \n12. \nThe project impact will be an increased number of Mongolia's globally competitive higher \neducation  graduates  responsive  to  labor  market  demands.  The  outcome  will  be  an  improved, \nwell-managed,  and  equitable  higher  education  system.  The  project  primarily  involves  capacity \nbuilding of the entire subsector to improve its performance. \n \nC. \n \n13. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  deliver  the  following  three  outputs:  (i)  improved  quality  and \nrelevance  of  higher  education  programs;  (ii)  improved  effectiveness  of  higher  education \ngovernance, management, and financing; and (iii) improved equity and access. \n \n14. \nQuality  and  relevance.  Quality  assurance  and  accreditation  will  be  improved  through \ninstitutional  strengthening  of  NCEA  and  its  business  processes.  By  the  end  of  the  project,  all \nHEIs will have institutional accreditation, at least 20 programs will be nationally accredited, and \nthree  programs  in  priority  disciplines 9  will  be  internationally  accredited.  Core  minimum \ncurriculum standards and a national credit and levels system will be in place and at least 50% of \nall HEIs will be carrying out their own internal curriculum review and development. In addition to \nthe capacity building of academic and administrative staff, 22 public and private HEIs will have \nimproved  facilities,  equipment,  laboratories,  and  libraries.  Research  capacity  and  output  in \npriority  disciplines  will  be  improved  through  the  provision  of  modern  research  facilities  to  two \nHEIs.  At  least  60  joint  research  studies  will  be  commissioned  under  the  project.  A  national  e-\nlearning center and three smaller centers will be established along with two testing centers, with \ntheir resources and services to be shared by all HEIs nationwide. \n \n15. \nRelevance  to  labor  market  needs  will  be  improved  through  strengthened  industry \nlinkages and PPPs. They will be monitored under the project through four annual labor market \nsurveys  and 12  tracer  studies.  A total  of  20  new  PPP  and twinning  arrangements  with foreign \nHEIs  will  be  introduced.  The  industry  linkages  and  PPPs  will  focus  on  knowledge  and \ntechnology  transfer  and  development  of  industry-ready  graduates.  They  will  (i)  strengthen  the \nexisting  program-promotion  systems  of  HEIs,  (ii)  expand  internship  programs  in  industry  for \nresearchers  and students  to improve  their  employability,  and (iii)  strengthen  HEI  management \nprograms. The knowledge transfer will result in a more balanced emphasis between specialized \nknowledge and relevant workplace skills such as flexible thinking, problem solving, innovation, \nadaptability, and intercultural communications. \n \n16. \nGovernance,  management,  and  financing.  Reforms in autonomy, accountability, and \nsound corporate governance will be piloted in two public HEIs and subsequently rolled out to the \nremaining 14 public HEIs. Reforms to improve the quality and sustainability of private HEIs will \nbe piloted in two private HEIs and rolled out to at least 10 other private HEIs. A new institution \nwill be established under the project. The Higher Education Endowment Fund will serve as the \nmain conduit for funding of development initiatives for higher education and competitive grants10 \nto be  awarded under the project.11 Financing  of  higher  education  will  be  improved through  the \npromotion  of  PPPs  to  enhance  resource  mobilization  at  the  institutional  level  and  through  the \nrationalization  of  state  funding  mechanisms,  policies,  and  practices  to  improve  targeted \n\n                                                \n9  The programs are (i) natural sciences, (ii) engineering and technology, and (iii) agriculture. \n10 Indicative  Selection  Criteria  for  Higher  Education  Institutions  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n11 Indicative  Selection  Criteria  for  Higher  Education  Institutions,  and  Organogram  of  Higher  Education  Subsector \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nassistance.  There  will  be  a  20%  increase  in  the  number  of  scholarships  funded  for  priority \ndisciplines by the end of the project. \n \n17. \nEquity  and  access.  The  project  will  provide  for  the  improvement  of  state  support \nmechanisms  for  poor  students  and  students  in  rural  areas,  development  of  policies  and \nmechanisms  to  attain  and  maintain  gender  balance  in  higher  education  enrollment,  and \nexpansion of higher education outreach to rural areas. A total of four rural HEIs will be piloted to \nprovide  distance  education  and  other  mechanisms  to  expand  higher  education  outreach  to  at \nleast  2,000  rural  students.  The  information  base  for  key  social  development  indicators  will  be \nimproved and mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation of those indicators will be established. \nThe project will also strengthen information dissemination and advocacy for social development \nin higher education. \n \n18. \nThe project will introduce market competitiveness in the higher education system, which \nis  a  new  approach  in  Mongolia.  Interventions  will  include  competitive  grants  to  assist  HEIs  in \nimproving  their  strategic  planning  and  management,  accountability,  and  transparency.  These \nreforms  will  require  a  fundamental  change  in  the  mindsets  of  government  officials,  HEI \nmanagers,  and  staff,  and  require  them  to  improve  their  knowledge  and  skills.  The  project  will \nalso  include  capacity  building,  which  aims  to  improve  overall  higher  education  subsector \nperformance.  The  project  will  fully  utilize  technical  outputs  from  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  technical \nassistance (TA)  in  higher  education,12 the  recommendations  of  which  on  improving  the  quality \nand  management  of  HEI  examinations  will  be  implemented  under  this  project.  An  overall \nassessment  of  ADB\u2019s  higher  education  loans  undertaken  in  2008  is  highly  relevant,  efficient, \nand effective.13 Lending for policy support and infrastructure development is important for higher \neducation development in developing member countries. \n \n19. \nThe  project  will  facilitate  Mongolia\u2019s  participation  in  regional  cooperation  regarding \nhigher education. As economies in the region grow more complex and become more integrated, \ncross-border higher education plays a key role in human resource development and workforce \nmobility. The project's capacity-building activities and promotion of twinning arrangements with \nforeign HEIs will enhance Mongolia's capacity for regional cooperation.  \n \nThe  project  will  rely  on  the  existing  donor  coordination  platform,  namely  the  Education \n20. \nDonor  Consultative  Mechanism  (EDCM),14 with  the  purpose  of  coordinating  higher  education \ndevelopment efforts and to align and harmonize donor contributions. During project preparation, \na  working  group  on  higher  education  and  technical  and  vocational  education  subsectors  was \nestablished  under  the  EDCM.  EDCM  members\u2014including  the  World  Bank  and  the  United \nNations  Educational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization 15 as  well  as  bilateral  donors  that \nprovide  direct  assistance  to  HEIs\u2014will  continue  their  dialogue,  and  possibly  harmonize  their \nefforts in the subsector. \n \n\n                                                \n12 ADB.  2010.

The  economic  rate  of  return  for  the  project  is  26.8%,  which \nindicates  the  project  is  economically  viable.18 Overall,  the  project  will  contribute  significantly  to \nimproving  the  capacity  of  HEIs  and  HEI  faculties,  teachers,  and  administrators;  developing \nresearch  activities;  and  upgrading  the  higher  education  system,  which  are  all  expected  to \ndirectly impact the quality of graduates and generate positive economic gains for the economy. \nA  cost\u2013benefit  sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  strong  benefits  will  likely  accrue  from  both \nincreased  employability  of  higher  education  graduates  and  improved  productivity  through \nincome generation. Other  external  benefits  of  the  project,  which will  accrue to society  at  large \n\n                                                \n17 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nand not just the direct beneficiaries of the project, are (i) improvements in teaching practices at \nHEIs,  which  will  filter  down  to  lower  levels  of  the  education  system  and  thereby  improve  the \neffectiveness  and  efficiency  of  education  at  these  levels;  (ii)  improved  responsiveness  of  the \nhigher  education  system  to  the  needs  of  the  labor  market  and  the  economy;  and  (iii)  cost \nefficiencies  at  HEIs  resulting  from  improved  governance,  management,  and  finance  reforms \nunder the project. \n \n27. \nFinancial  analysis.  Public  expenditures  on  higher  education  made  up  2.1%  of  total \ngovernment  expenditures  in  2009.  Mongolia\u2019s  higher  education  has  been  financed  largely  by \nprivate  funds  through  the  payment  of  tuition  fees,  donations,  and  income  generation.  Tuition \nfees  are  the  largest  source  of  financing  for  public  HEIs,  making  almost  60%  of  all  funds.  The \nState  Training  Fund  (STF)  augments  state  budgets  to  HEIs  through  loans  and  grants  to \nstudents of civil servants, and poor herders and other disadvantaged groups. Higher education \nfinancing is undermined by insufficient financial support from the government to HEIs, as well as \nby  other  issues:  (i)  the  lack  of  a  higher  education financing  policy;  (ii)  insufficient  autonomy of \nHEIs at the institutional level, as the government caps tuition fees, imposes student quotas, and \ncontrols governance structures; and (iii) deficiencies in the current program of state grants and \ntuition  loans.  Keeping  tuition  fees  low  has  made  it  difficult  for  HEIs  to  cover  major  costs  for \neducational  inputs  such  as  teachers\u2019  remuneration,  improvement  of  learning  facilities,  and \nresearch activities. As a result, private providers\u2014which focus largely on low-investment, high-\nreturn programs, with little regard for maintaining quality standards\u2014have proliferated.  \n \n28. \nThe  government\u2019s  higher  education  budget  is  projected  to  increase  by  an  average  of \n13.2%  annually  from  2011  to  2015.  Meanwhile,  the  government\u2019s  annual  commitment  to  the \nproject  as  a  percentage  of  the  total  education  budget  is  projected  to  increase  from  0.44%  in \nyear  1  of  the  project  to  2.37%  in  year  2,  and  is  expected  to  decline  to  0.34%  in  year  5.  The \ngovernment\u2019s annual commitment to the project as a percentage of the higher education budget \nis  also  expected  to  initially  increase  (from  2.48%  in  year  1  to  13.45%  in  year  2)  and \nsubsequently decline (to 1.39% in year 5 of project implementation). The government\u2019s annual \ncommitment to the project is therefore deemed affordable, as its share in the project represents \nonly about 0.93% of the higher education budget, on average, over the 5-year period. \n \nB. \n \n29.  MECS,  the  executing  agency,  has  been  a  long-term  partner  of  ADB,  and  actively \ninvolved  in  implementing  education  sector  development  projects  since  1997.  There  is  an \nongoing effort by ADB and MOF's procurement policy department to review Mongolia's standard \nbidding  documents  for  goods  and  civil  works.  ADB  carried  out  a  performance  review  of \nprocurement19 and  disbursement  by  the  executing  agency  in  February  2010,  and  compliance \nreviews were done by ADB in 2009 and 2010. MECS and MOF are in the process of improving \ntheir  effectiveness  to  follow  the  recommendations  stemming  from  these  assessments.  During \nproject  preparation,  an  assessment  of  MECS'  existing  project management  arrangements  and \ncapacity  was  also  carried  out,  which  confirmed  that  MECS  has  adequate  capacity  to  conduct \nprocurement and disbursement in compliance with ADB policy and procedural requirements and \nrelevant national laws and regulations on public procurement. Audits of the executing agency\u2019s \nprocurement activities were undertaken by external auditors or the National Auditing Authority. \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n19 In  the  report,  procurement  practices  were  rated  average  and  organizational  structure  and  staff  capacity,  records \nmanagement,  effectiveness,  and  accountability  all  received  high  ratings.  MECS  and  MOF  have  implemented \nmitigating  measures  including  (i)  placing  an  officer  of  the  Finance  and  Administration  Department  in  MECS  to \ncheck  and  facilitate  procurement  and  disbursement,  and  (ii)  systematic  knowledge  and  experience  sharing  from \nexperienced to new staff. \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \n30. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MECS. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nC. \n \n31.  While  the  project's  support  for  reforms  in  quality,  relevance,  and  governance  and \nmanagement will benefit all higher education students and their families, the equity and access \ncomponent  will  specifically  target  poor  students  and  those  from  rural  areas  through  initiatives \nsuch as rationalizing state support mechanisms to remove financial barriers to higher education \nand \nimproving  higher  education  outreach  to  rural  students.  Socioeconomic  and  sex-\ndisaggregated information on the status of higher education students is not available at present \nand  the  project  will  develop  a  clearly  defined  disaggregated  information  base  for  key  social \nindicators in higher education, integrate these into the national statistical system, and establish \nmechanisms for systematic information gathering, monitoring, and evaluation. By the end of the \nproject, it is envisaged that the enrollment of students from poor and rural families will increase \nby at least 5% above 2013 levels (the envisaged completion of the disaggregated data base), \nwith  four  rural  HEIs  offering  distance  education  programs  for  outreach  to  at  least  2,000  rural \nstudents. The project will also provide competitive grants for innovative approaches to address \nequity  and  access  issues  in  higher  education.  Information  and  advocacy  campaigns  on  social \nissues  in  higher  education  will  be  conducted  for  administrators,  teachers,  and  other \nstakeholders. \n \nGender  benefits.  The  project  is  designed  to  be  classified  under  the  gender  equity \n32. \ntheme.  The  gender  action  plan 20  designed  for  the  project  will  build  MECS'  capacity  for \nidentifying  and  addressing  gender  issues,  eliminating  gender  imbalances  in  higher  education, \nand  promoting  gender-neutral \nlearning.  The  project  will,  among  other \ninterventions,  (i)  develop  training  programs  and  manuals  for  higher  education  managers  and \nteachers on gender sensitivity; (ii) revise curricula and learning materials to make them gender \nsensitive;  (iii)  develop  strategies  and  incentives  to  address  the  gender  imbalance  in  higher \neducation enrollment; and (iv) develop policies to promote gender balance among HEI boards, \ntop management, and the teaching staff. \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  is  categorized  as  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \n33. \nindigenous  peoples.  No significant  impact  on  the  environment  is  anticipated.  No  acquisition  of \nland  or  relocation  of  people  is  planned.  The  simplified  environmental  management  plan  was \nprepared to  ensure full  mitigation  of  any  environmental  impacts  of  limited  civil  works,  such  as \nrehabilitation of existing laboratories and libraries supported by the project. No negative impacts \non  indigenous  peoples  are  expected.  Targeting  approaches  under  the  project  will  be  applied \nnationwide and benefit indigenous peoples. \n \n \n \n \n \n\nteaching  and \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n20 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in  Appendix 2).

The project will further reinforce this through \nadvocacy workshops and study visits for key \npolicymakers to observe the results of similar reforms in \nother countries. The Asian Development Bank (ADB)-\nfunded TA projectsa would support the Ministry of \nEducation, Culture, and Science Working Group on \nHigher Education Law Revision in identifying and \npreparing the key policy reforms. \nAll the ADB-funded projects will have an experienced \ndeputy PIU director (project manager) to provide general \nguidance and overall direction to PIU operations. The \nselection criteria for PIU staff should include previous \nwork experience with ADB-funded projects and a good \ntechnical background. In either case, the PIU staff will be \ntrained under the project (note also the government\u2019s \nongoing efforts, indicated in footnote 19.) \n\nA new project implementation unit (PIU) with \ninexperienced staff will be set up to manage and \nimplement the project. As a result, project disbursements \nand procurement activities could be delayed and \nprogress may be behind the implementation schedule. \n\na  ADB.  2009.
