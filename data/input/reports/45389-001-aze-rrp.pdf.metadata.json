THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Republic of Azerbaijan for the Second Road Network \nDevelopment Investment Program (the investment program).1 \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n2.  The investment program will construct an approximately 63 km section of the motorway \nbetween Masalli and Shorsulu, along the South\u2013North corridor of the country. It also includes a \nnonphysical investment component for road safety improvement and capacity development. \nThe investment program is a government priority and is included in the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) country operations business plan for Azerbaijan for 2012\u20132014. \n \n3.  The transport sector plays an important role in Azerbaijan\u2019s economy, accounting for \nabout 6% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Roads are the dominant mode of freight and \npassenger transport. The country occupies an important geographical position for transit routes \nwith roads and railway lines connecting the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Thus, the transport \nsector contributes to regional cooperation by facilitating the development of international trade. \nThe sector is also crucial to the domestic economy since it links the rural population to urban \nand international markets. \n \n4.  The development of transport infrastructure is one of the government\u2019s key tasks to \nsustain GDP growth and promote trade with neighboring countries. The poor condition of the \nnational road network poses a challenge. About 56% of the main road network is in poor \ncondition and needs urgent repair; most of the lower category roads are in extremely bad \nshape. The East\u2013West corridor (Baku\u2013Ganja\u2013Georgia border through Alyat and a more direct \nroute  through  Shamakhi)  and  the  North\u2013South  corridor  (Russian  Federation  border\u2013Baku\u2013\nAlyat\u2013Iran border), as well as feeder roads connecting rural areas and the main corridors, are \ncrucial to addressing the transport bottlenecks to national development and poverty reduction. \n \n5.  The road subsector in Azerbaijan faces four main problems: (i) poor road conditions, \n(ii)  inadequate  program  delivery  because  of  weak  institutional  capacity,  (iii)  inadequate \nmaintenance of roads, and (iv) poor quality of construction. These bottlenecks lead to higher-\nthan-average construction and maintenance costs and delay construction.2While the ADB-\n \nassisted road projects  have experienced delays and cost overruns, overall they have been built \nas designed. Building projects on time, within budget, and to high standards is possible, but it \nrequires effective and efficient program and project management. \n \n6.  Strategic  context  and  road  map.  The  State  Program  on  Poverty  Reduction  and \nEconomic Development (SPPRED), 2008\u201320153 and the State Program on Socioeconomic \nDevelopment of Regions, 2009\u201320144 represent the government\u2019s overall strategic framework \nfor development. The infrastructure pillar of the SPPRED includes reconstructing a significant \nportion of the country\u2019s roads in accordance with international standards. To realize the strategic \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework for the investment program is in Appendix 1. \n2  Sector Assessment (Summary): Roads (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n3  Republic of Azerbaijan. 2008.

Baku. \n ", "2 \ngoal for road reconstruction, the government prepared a Road Network Development Program \n(RNDP)5 for 2006\u20132015, which was subsequently extended to 2022. Under the RNDP, the \nreconstruction and rehabilitation of about 9,500 kilometers (km) of roads is planned during \n2006\u20132022 at a total cost of about $8.46 billion (in 2012 prices). Through both physical and \nnonphysical interventions, the RNDP establishes a road map for the development of an efficient, \nsafe, sustainable, and internationally and domestically integrated transport network to support \nthe  country\u2019s  economic  and  social  development.  A  new  MFF  is  needed  to  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s  new  priority  projects.  The  strategy  and  road  map  of  a  2007  MFF  for  road \ndevelopment have been updated and remain valid for this new MFF. The proposed investment \nprogram is in line with the overall transport sector development strategy of the government.6 \n \n7.  First Road Network Development Program. In September 2007, ADB approved an \nMFF in the amount of $500 million equivalent for the first Road Network Development Program.7 \nThe program is ongoing with three tranches approved to date. Project 1, supported by a $200 \nmillion loan, is for the construction of sections of the Masalli\u2013Astara expressway. Project 2 \n($55.4 million loan) is for the construction of the Ganja bypass. Project 3 ($200 million loan), \nalso  for  the  construction  of  sections  of  the  Masalli\u2013Astara  expressway,  was  approved  in \nDecember 2011. \n \n8.  Project 1 experienced initial implementation delays because (i) the implementing agency \nlacked the expertise to comply with ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements regarding land acquisition \nand resettlement (LAR); and (ii) the construction period was not synchronized with the working \nseason. Project costs also increased, primarily because of a sharp rise in the cost of fuel and \nconstruction materials, and the failure of the feasibility study to account for certain additional \nexpenditures. Since land acquisition for the entire project road could not be completed in a \ntimely manner, two sections of the project road were removed from the scope of project 1 and \nare  being  constructed  under  project  3.  With  continuous  ADB  monitoring  and  project \nmanagement  support,  implementation  of  project  1  has  accelerated  and  is  targeted  for \ncompletion by the end of 2013.  \n \n9.  Project 2 did not have any LAR impacts, but the implementation progress has been slow \ndue to (i) the late mobilization of the contractor, (ii) delayed customs clearance for imported \nequipment, and (iii) low rate of civil works progress by the contractor. Through joint efforts by \nADB and the government, the civil works have been accelerating and will be completed by the \nend  of  2012.  Project  3,  which  is  undergoing  procurement,  is  targeted  for  completion  by \nDecember 2015. Like project 1, implementation of project 3 has been affected by increased cost \nestimates. Overall, the physical investment components under the first investment program are \nexpected to be completed as designed.8 The study on development of legal and regulatory \nframeworks and operational procedures for toll roads is ongoing. This will create an enabling \nenvironment for private sector participation in road construction, operation, and maintenance. \n \n                                                \n5  The Ministry of Transport (MOT) prepared a RNDP for 2006\u20132015 in July 2006 with an estimated cost of  \n$5.3 billion (in 2006 prices). While the government undertook implementation of the road projects, implementation \nof the RNDP was slowed by delays in land acquisition and resettlement, lack of project readiness, delays in \nprocurement of works and consulting services, and lack of institutional capabilities. \n6  In support of implementing the SPPRED and other programs of the government, MOT prepared a transport policy \npaper, followed by a transport sector development strategy developed with ADB assistance: ADB. 2006. Republic \nof Azerbaijan: Transport Sector Development Strategy. Baku. (Technical assistance consultant report). \n7  ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to the Republic of Azerbaijan for the Road Network Development Program. Manila. \n8  At the request of the executing agency, the balance of the MFF funding totaling $44.6 million is available for any \nnew project meeting MFF criteria, or additional financing under tranches 1, 2, and 3, if required. \n ", "3 \n10.  New multitranche financing facility. The Alyat\u2013Masalli motorway, which is a priority \nproject  under  the  government\u2019s  RNDP,  was  originally  planned  for  implementation  under  a \nhighway project financed by the World Bank. The World Bank dropped a road section of about \n63  km  (Masalli  to  Shorsulu)  for  its  financing,  primarily  because  of  cost  overruns  and  low \ndisbursement  rates  in  its  ongoing  projects.9 However,  the  World  Bank  had  carried  out \npreparatory  work  including  detailed  designs,  cost  estimates,  and  safeguard  documents. \nLAR activities have been substantially completed in accordance with World Bank requirements. \nThus, given the level of project readiness, the government asked ADB to provide a new MFF to \nfinance the construction of the motorway between Masalli and Shorsulu. ADB has carried out \ndue diligence on the World Bank\u2019s preparatory documents and confirms that they comply with \nADB policy requirements. \n \n11.  The proposed investments\u2014both physical and nonphysical\u2014will add to those being \nsupported by ADB and other development partners in Azerbaijan. Built on the results of the \nongoing first Road Network Development Program (footnote 7) and using a holistic approach to \nthe road subsector, the new MFF will help make Azerbaijan\u2019s road network more effective and \nefficient. It will include a capacity development component to strengthen the capacity of the \nexecuting and implementing agencies through training in planning, project preparation, and \nproject  implementation.  The  capacity  development  will  also  assist  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies in (i) mainstreaming road safety audits during the design, construction, \nand  implementation  phases  of  the  road  network,  including  prescribing  road  safety \nimprovements; (ii) developing road standards and specifications, including for pavement layers \nunder different climatic and site conditions; and (iii) prioritizing road sections for long-term, \nperformance-based maintenance contracts. \n \n12.  The government has selected the MFF modality to finance this highway section based \non the experience with the first MFF and to ensure continuity. The MFF is the suitable funding \nmodality because of its flexibility and ability to sequence investments based on the readiness of \nthe program. In addition, the country allocation limit would not allow a stand-alone loan large \nenough to finance the entire 63 km road section. All the preconditions for the MFF are in place, \nincluding a coherent strategy, sector road map, investment and financing plans, and policy \nframework.  Preparatory  work  for  the  road  section  has  been  completed  and  is  ready  for \nimplementation  in  two  tranches.  Based  on  the  near-term  investment  requirements  of  the \ngovernment, the proposed new MFF will cover 80% of the estimated cost of the investment \nprogram. This will consolidate the partnership started under the first MFF. Lessons from the \nimplementation  of  the  first  Road  Network  Development  Program  and  from  World  Bank \nprojects\u2014such  as  cost  overruns,  slow  implementation,  and  low  disbursement  rates\u2014were \nconsidered in designing the new MFF.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the investment program will be greater economic growth in Azerbaijan and \nexpanded trade with neighboring countries. The outcome will be an efficient, adequate, safe, \nand sustainable southern motorway corridor from Baku in Azerbaijan. \n \n                                                \n9  The World Bank provided additional financing to cover cost overruns, but not enough to cover this section.  \nIn addition, the World Bank policy restricts additional investment, as the disbursement rate is below the minimum \nrequirement. Hence, the World Bank cannot finance this section of the Alyat\u2013Masalli motorway. \n ", "4 \nC.  Outputs \n14.  Tranche 1. The outputs of tranche 1 will be (i) about 30 km of the newly constructed \nroad  between  Masalli  and  Jalilabad,  a  section  of  the  Masalli\u2013Shorsulu  motorway;  and  \n(ii)  improved  program  and  project  management,  and  implementation  capacities  of \nAzerRoadServices (ARS). \n \n15.  Tranche 2. The outputs of tranche 2 will be (i) about 33 km of the newly constructed \nroad between Jalilabad and Shorsulu, a section of the Masalli\u2013Shorsulu motorway; (ii) further \nimproved  program  and  project  management,  and  implementation  capacities  of  ARS;  and \n(iii) improved transport sector governance through mainstreaming of road safety audits and \nimprovements, development of road and pavement standards and guidelines, and development \nof performance-based maintenance contracts. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n1.  Investment Plan \n16.  Implementation  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s  RNDP,  2006\u20132022  will  cost  about  $8.46  billion. \nThe new investment program will cost $625 million equivalent, with the cost of tranche 1 being \n$312 million equivalent (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Investment Program \n($ million) \n  Amounta \nItem  MFF  Tranche 1  Tranche 2 \nA.

Financing Plan \n17.  The government plans to finance the RNDP, 2006\u20132022 through a balance of domestic \nand foreign financing. Domestic sources include the road fund restored in 2007 to finance road \nsubsector and budgetary allocation totaling about $2.6 billion. The government will also obtain \nfinancial assistance from multilateral and bilateral development partners, as well as commercial \nbanks.10 \n                                                \n10 In addition to ADB, other external aid agencies that have expressed a willingness to support implementation of the \nRNDP include the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank (about $1 billion \neach), and commercial banks (about $1.3 billion). The government is still seeking additional funding to cover the \nbalance. \n ", "5 \n18.  The government has requested an MFF in an amount up to $500 million equivalent from \nADB's ordinary capital resources to help finance part of the investment program, which will in \nturn support a portion of the RNDP, 2006\u20132022. The MFF will consist of two tranches, subject to \nthe government's submission of related periodic financing requests, execution of the related \nloan agreement for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings set \nforth in the framework financing agreement. The first tranche of the MFF will have a 21-year \nterm, including a grace period of 4 years, straight-line repayment method, an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan agreement. Based on these loan terms and repayment method, the average \nloan maturity is 12.75 years and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \n19.  The financing plan is summarized in Table 2. The government\u2019s contribution will be used \nto  meet  land  acquisition  costs,  taxes  and  duties,  and  interest  and  other  charges  during \nconstruction. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n  Amount ($ million)  Share of \nSource  MFF  Tranche 1  Tranche 2  Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  500.0  250.0  250.0  80.0 \nGovernment  125.0  62.0  63.0  20.0 \nTotal  625.0  312.0  313.0  100.0 \nMFF = multitranche financing facility. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The Ministry of Transport (MOT) will be the executing agency and ARS will be the \nimplementing agency. To administer the investment program effectively, the program steering \ncommittee chaired by a deputy minister of transport to oversee the implementation of the first \nRoad  Network  Development  Program  will  continue  to  provide  overall  guidance  for  the \nimplementation of the new investment program. It will include representatives from the Cabinet \nof  Ministers,  Ministry  of  Economic  Development,  Ministry  of  Finance, MOT,  ARS,  and  the \ndirector of the project implementation unit (PIU). The committee will meet quarterly to monitor \nand  ensure  that  appropriate  measures  are  taken  for  the  timely  program  implementation. \nThe committee will support interagency coordination to facilitate timely approvals. \n \n21.  ARS will be responsible for daily implementation activities. ARS will expand the existing \nPIU  to  implement  the  investment  program.  Given  the  limited  technical  staff  in  the  PIU,  \na program management consultant will be engaged under tranche 1. Based on the consultant\u2019s \nperformance under tranche 1, the scope of the contract may be extended to cover various \nstudies on transport sector governance under tranche 2 and to assist ARS with implementation \nof the entire investment program. The consultant will also build the capacity of ARS and PIU \nthrough  on-the-job  training  and  other  specialized  training.  These  may  include  integrating \nclimate-proofing  measures  in  the  road  design,  procurement,  construction  monitoring  and \nmaintenance, environmental and social safeguards, financial management, and contract and \nproject management. The  aim  is  to  enable  the  PIU  staff  to  handle program management \nindependently in future. Thus, the consultant\u2019s role is to build, not to substitute, the PIU\u2019s \ncapacity. The consultant will help ARS prepare project and program management reports to be \nsubmitted to MOT and ADB. \n \n ", "6 \n22.  The program management consultant and the PIU will jointly oversee all activities during \nthe implementation of the investment program, including project preparation and administration, \nprocurement  of  works  and  consulting  services,  disbursements  and  financial  management, \ncompliance with safeguard requirements, and reporting to MOT and ADB. The consultant will \nintroduce a suitable management information system in the PIU and train the staff to achieve \nefficient and effective management of the investment program. The consultant will assist ARS in \npreparing and submitting flash reports and photographs concerning implementation progress of \neach  tranche.  The  consultant  will  also  submit  other  required  performance  and  monitoring \nreports  consistent  with  existing  project  implementation  requirements  and  compliance  with \ncovenants. \n \n23.  Procurement of works financed by the MFF will follow ADB's Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time). Consultant recruitment will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  approved  advance \ncontracting of works and consulting services under the investment program on 4 July 2012. \nThe government has been advised that ADB approval of advanced contracting does not commit \nADB to financing any ensuing projects under the investment program. The implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the facility administration \nmanual.11 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2012\u2013December 2020 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2021 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Program steering committee \n(ii) Executing agency  Ministry of Transport \n(iii) Key implementing agency  AzerRoadServices \n(iv) Project implementation  PIU in Baku No. of staff = 20 \nunit \nProcurement  ICB  2 works contracts  $360 million (each contract $180 \nmillion) excluding taxes. \nConsulting services  QCBS   Consulting services for construction  $6 million (100 international and \n  supervision under tranche 1 (one  50 national person-months) \ncontract) \nQCBS  Consulting services for construction  $7 million (100 international and \nsupervision under tranche 2 (one  50 national person-months) \ncontract) \nQCBS   Program management consulting  $10 million (168 international and \nservices (up to two contracts)  78 national person-months) \nQCBS   Various studies for transport sector  Total $6 million (120 international \ngovernance under tranche 2 (up to  and 75 national person-months) \nthree contracts)  \nICS  Transport sector governance under  $300,000 (9 international person-\ntranche 2 (up to three contracts)  months) \nAdvance contracting  Works and consulting services  \nDisbursements  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nupon between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICB = international competitive bidding, ICS = individual consultant selection,  \nPIU = project implementation unit, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n                                                \n11 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n24.  The investment program, which will modernize the road network, does not present any \ntechnical issues. The detailed design and cost estimates prepared by the World Bank have \nbeen  reviewed  through  value  engineering,  and  cost  estimates  were  updated.  During \nimplementation,  climate  change  impacts  will  be  minimized  and  greenhouse  gas  reduction \nmeasures will be employed. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n25.  An economic analysis12 of the investment program was conducted in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.13 It evaluated the benefits with and \nwithout the investment program using the highway development and management model.14 \nRoad traffic data were updated based on the elasticity of transport demand with respect to GDP. \nThe benefits are generated by the road being less congested, faster, shorter, and safer than the \nexisting road. The investment program is economically viable, with an estimated economic \ninternal rate of return of 17.3% and an estimated net present value of $224 million at a 12% \ndiscount rate. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the investment program. Overall, \nthe investment program is justified in social cost\u2013benefit terms. \n \n26.  A financial analysis15 of the investment program was carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.16 Likely toll revenues \nwere considered in the analysis. The financial internal rate of return is estimated at 6.6%, which \ncompares well with the weighted average cost of capital (5.4%), indicating the financial viability \nof the investment program. \n \nC.  Governance \n27.  Institutional capacity. ARS staff involved in project implementation lacked knowledge \nabout ADB\u2019s guidelines and requirements, which caused initial implementation delays under the \nongoing  projects.  To  address  this  weakness,  a  program  management  consultant  will  be \nengaged to train and assist ARS in implementing this investment program (paras. 21\u201322). \n \n28.  Procurement. Procurement plans will be developed for each tranche. ADB will review \nthe procurement and consultant selection processes at key stages. The bid documents will be \nbased on an independent engineer\u2019s cost estimates and international best practices. Optimal \nqualification criteria will be prescribed to maximize competition. The construction period will be \nsynchronized with the climate cycle, and bidders will be given at least 8 weeks to prepare bids. \nADB will monitor procurement activities by ARS and participate in procurement and consultant \nselection. \n   \n                                                \n12 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 ADB. 1997.

Financial management. The financial management assessment of ARS17 highlights the \nneed  for  improvement  in  accounting  systems  and  corporate  governance.  The  program \nmanagement  consultant  will  help  strengthen  the  financial  management  capacity  of  ARS. \nARS received World Bank assistance to develop a corporate plan and a manual on financial \nreporting and procedures. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development assisted \nARS in implementing the corporate plan. With external assistance, the capacity of ARS to \nmanage  the  implementation  of  externally  funded  projects  improved.  External  independent \nauditing of contracts, accounts, and financial statements will be undertaken to ensure fiduciary \noversight. For the MFF, MOT and ARS will maintain separate project records and accounts \nadequate to identify the (i) works and services financed from the loan proceeds, (ii) financing \nresources received, (iii) expenses incurred by the components of each project, and (iv) use of \ncounterpart funds. All bidding documents for contracts will specify ADB\u2019s right to audit the \nrecords and accounts of all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. \n \n30.  Anticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government, MOT, and ARS. Specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the facility administration manual (footnote 11). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n31.  The investment program\u2019s direct benefits to the poor are small. However, it will create an \nenabling environment for poverty reduction, which includes (i) lower transport costs, (ii) additional \njobs and income from construction and maintenance of the  new motorway, and (iii) better \naccess to markets and social services.18 These will generate indirect benefits to the poor. \n \n32.  The investment program includes some gender elements in terms of improving women\u2019s \naccess to markets and services, generating opportunities for skilled women and offering women \nthe chance to participate in monitoring the impact of the investment program. The investment \nprogram is linked to a pilot project to train women entrepreneurs to scale up their businesses, \nwhich will enable them to benefit from better access to markets.19 Improved access to social \nservices, economic opportunities, and consumer choices is expected to increase the welfare of \nwomen, raise household incomes, enhance the achievement of the Millennium Development \nGoals, and reduce poverty. \n \n33.  All projects financed under the MFF will include appropriate measures to raise public \nawareness on the potential risks of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, as well \nas  drug  and  human  trafficking.  Contractors  will  be  required  to  take  measures  to  protect \nconstruction workers from the risks of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, and \nto give construction workers time to be tested or receive treatment. The supervision consultant \nand  program  management  consultant  will  coordinate  with  the  contractors  and  monitor \nimplementation. \n \n   \n                                                \n17 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 ADB. 2010.

An environmental assessment and review framework20 for the investment \nprogram was prepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and relevant laws \nand regulations in Azerbaijan. The proposed motorway is on a new alignment with a 7 km \nsection passing through wetlands. The sections to be financed by tranche 1 and 2 are classified \nas  environment  category  A.  The  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)21 reports  were \nprepared in 2007; the World Bank in 2011 prepared an addendum that looked more closely into \nthe wetlands and its environmental implications. Based on these reports, a single updated EIA \nwas  prepared  that  reflects  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement. The EIA recommends specific mitigation measures with regard to motorway design \nand construction and a robust long-term monitoring program. The contracts for the supervision \nconsultant, program management consultant, and civil works will include stringent provisions for \ncompliance with environmental safeguards. An ecological expert and environmental specialist \nwill be engaged to ensure implementation of the environmental management plan. Assurances \nto mitigate potential harm to the wetlands are also included in the loan agreement, framework \nfinancing agreement, and facility administration manual. \n \n35.  Involuntary resettlement. A resettlement framework22 for the investment program was \nprepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and relevant laws and regulations in \nAzerbaijan,  and  adopting  the  rehabilitation  strategy  in  the  resettlement  policy  framework.  \nLAR activities were substantially completed based on the World Bank\u2019s resettlement plan, which \nthe government agreed upon under the earlier World Bank-assisted highway project. A due \ndiligence  assessment  confirmed  that  compensation  payments  were  made  following  the \nresettlement policy framework agreed upon with the World Bank and are consistent with the \nrequirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Outstanding  LAR  activities  include \ncompensating the remaining 2% (15 privately owned plots) of households losing portions of their \nagricultural lands, paying compensation for affected municipal land, and providing additional \nrehabilitation assistance for severely affected and vulnerable households by prioritizing them for \ncivil works jobs. Tranche 1 is classified as category A for involuntary resettlement. For tranche \n1, a land acquisition and resettlement plan was prepared to cover the remaining LAR activities, \nincluding rehabilitation measures and actions to address temporary impacts and emerging LAR \nissues during implementation. Both the LAR framework and plan were disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite on 23 July 2012. Implementation of the LAR plan will be monitored internally and \nexternally. The program management consultant will conduct refresher training for the land \nacquisition department of ARS and respective district administrative staff on safeguards, and \nwill monitor LAR-related activities. \n \n36.  Indigenous peoples. The investment program area does not have any known social or \ncultural groups classified as indigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \nTranche 1 is classified as category C for indigenous peoples impact. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n37.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 \n \n                                                \n20 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInadequate capacity of  Program management consultant will be engaged to assist ARS and PIU in \nthe implementing  implementing the investment program and dealing with daily implementation \nagency to implement  matters, including procurement, contract administration, and compliance with \nthe investment program  Asian  Development  Bank  safeguard  requirements,  to  augment  projects \nprogress.  \nCost overruns  The cost estimates for civil works are based on the detailed design and the \nengineer\u2019s estimates. Value engineering analysis and due diligence was \ncarried out to ensure the adequacy of the cost estimates according to the site \nrequirements and market costs. Adequate contingencies are included in the \nfinancing plan in case cost estimates increase for unforeseen reasons. \nConstruction delays  The construction period will be aligned with the climate cycle. The civil works \ncaused by weather and  contracts will prescribe a construction period, including the shutdown period \nsite conditions  for  winters  and  rainy  season.  The  program management  consultant  will \nclosely  monitor  the  situation  with  a  backup  plan  agreed  upon  with  the \ncontractor to minimize such delays. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n38.  The government and MOT have assured ADB that implementation of the investment \nprogram shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the facility administration manual and loan documents. \n \n39.  The government and MOT have given ADB certain undertakings, which are set forth in \nthe framework financing agreement. Specific covenants agreed upon by the government and \nMOT with respect to individual tranches are set forth in the loan agreement for the respective \ntranches. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n40.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount not exceeding $500,000,000 equivalent to the Republic of Azerbaijan for the Second \nRoad Network Development Investment Program, from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n12 September 2012\n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact  By 2025    Assumptions \nGreater economic  Increase in trade with  National economic and  Continued political and \ngrowth in Azerbaijan  neighboring countries to $5.0  trade statistics  macroeconomic stability in \nand expanded trade  billion (2011 baseline: $3.7  Azerbaijan \nwith neighboring  billion)   \ncountries    Continued government \nIncreased gross domestic  commitment to regional \nproduct from $64 billion  cooperation \n(2011) to $120 billion    \nRisk \nDelay in implementation of the \nState Program on Poverty \nReduction and Economic \nDevelopment as planned \nOutcome  By 2020    Assumptions \nAn efficient, adequate,  30% increase in freight traffic  MFF and project  Government\u2019s commitment to \nsafe, and sustainable  (2010 baseline: 11,325 million  progress and completion  implement the road map and \nsouthern motorway  ton-km)  reports of ARS  the Road Network \ncorridor from Baku in      Development Program \nAzerbaijan  20% increase in passenger  Statistical Yearbook of   \ntraffic (2010 baseline: 16,633  Azerbaijan  Adequate government \nmillion passenger-km)    financing \n  ARS annual surveys   \nIncreased funding for road    Support of local government \nmaintenance to at least $350  Road subsector budget  continues from the outputs \nmillion (2011 baseline: $200  and expenditure records  stage \nmillion)   \n  Risk \n10% reduction in the number  Rapid deterioration of the road \nof road traffic accidents (2011  network caused by weak axle-\nbaseline: 2,890 number of  load controls, weather and \naccidents)   climatic conditions \n \nAbout 4 million beneficiaries  \nOutputs  By 2018    Assumptions \n1.
