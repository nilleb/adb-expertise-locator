It also includes a \nnonphysical  investment  component  for  road  safety  improvement  and  capacity  development. \nThe  investment  program  is  a  government  priority  and  is  included  in  the  Asian  Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) country operations business plan for Azerbaijan for 2012\u20132014. \n \nThe  transport  sector  plays  an  important  role  in  Azerbaijan\u2019s  economy,  accounting  for \n3. \nabout  6%  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  Roads  are  the  dominant  mode  of  freight  and \npassenger transport. The country occupies an important geographical position for transit routes \nwith roads and railway lines connecting the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Thus, the transport \nsector contributes to regional cooperation by facilitating the development of international trade. \nThe  sector  is  also crucial  to  the  domestic  economy  since  it  links  the  rural  population  to  urban \nand international markets. \n \nThe  development  of  transport  infrastructure  is  one  of  the  government\u2019s  key  tasks  to \n4. \nsustain  GDP  growth  and  promote  trade  with  neighboring  countries.  The  poor  condition  of  the \nnational  road  network  poses  a  challenge.  About  56%  of  the  main  road  network  is  in  poor \ncondition  and  needs  urgent  repair;  most  of  the  lower  category  roads  are  in  extremely  bad \nshape. The  East\u2013West corridor (Baku\u2013Ganja\u2013Georgia border through Alyat  and a more  direct \nroute  through  Shamakhi)  and  the  North\u2013South  corridor  (Russian  Federation  border\u2013Baku\u2013\nAlyat\u2013Iran  border),  as  well  as feeder  roads  connecting rural  areas  and  the main corridors,  are \ncrucial to addressing the transport bottlenecks to national development and poverty reduction. \n \n5. \nThe  road  subsector  in  Azerbaijan  faces  four  main  problems:  (i)  poor  road  conditions, \n(ii)  inadequate  program  delivery  because  of  weak  institutional  capacity,  (iii)  inadequate \nmaintenance  of  roads,  and  (iv)  poor  quality  of  construction.  These  bottlenecks  lead  to  higher-\nthan-average  construction  and  maintenance  costs  and  delay  construction. 2\n While  the  ADB-\nassisted road projects  have experienced delays and cost overruns, overall they have been built \nas designed.  Building  projects  on time,  within budget,  and to  high  standards  is  possible,  but  it \nrequires effective and efficient program and project management. \n \n6. \nStrategic  context  and  road  map.  The  State  Program  on  Poverty  Reduction  and \nEconomic  Development  (SPPRED),  2008\u20132015 3 and  the  State  Program  on  Socioeconomic \nDevelopment  of  Regions,  2009\u201320144 represent  the  government\u2019s  overall  strategic  framework \nfor  development.  The  infrastructure  pillar  of  the  SPPRED  includes  reconstructing  a  significant \nportion of the country\u2019s roads in accordance with international standards. To realize the strategic \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework for the investment program is in Appendix 1. \n2  Sector Assessment (Summary): Roads (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n3  Republic  of  Azerbaijan.  2008.  State  Program  on  Poverty  Reduction  and  Economic  Development,  2008\u20132015. \n\n4  Republic of Azerbaijan. 2009. State Program on Socioeconomic Development of Regions, 2009\u20132014. Baku. \n\nBaku. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ngoal for road reconstruction, the government prepared a Road Network Development Program \n(RNDP) 5 for  2006\u20132015,  which  was  subsequently  extended  to  2022.  Under  the  RNDP,  the \nreconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  about  9,500  kilometers  (km)  of  roads  is  planned  during \n2006\u20132022  at  a  total  cost  of  about  $8.46  billion  (in  2012  prices).  Through  both  physical  and \nnonphysical interventions, the RNDP establishes a road map for the development of an efficient, \nsafe,  sustainable,  and  internationally  and  domestically  integrated  transport  network  to  support \nthe  country\u2019s  economic  and  social  development.  A  new  MFF  is  needed  to  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s  new  priority  projects.  The  strategy  and  road  map  of  a  2007  MFF  for  road \ndevelopment have been updated and remain valid for this new MFF. The proposed investment \nprogram is in line with the overall transport sector development strategy of the government.6 \n \n7. \nFirst  Road  Network  Development  Program.  In  September  2007,  ADB  approved  an \nMFF in the amount of $500 million equivalent for the first Road Network Development Program.7 \nThe program is ongoing with three tranches approved to date.  Project 1, supported by a $200 \nmillion  loan,  is  for  the  construction  of  sections  of  the  Masalli\u2013Astara  expressway.  Project  2 \n($55.4  million  loan)  is  for  the  construction  of  the  Ganja  bypass.  Project  3  ($200  million  loan), \nalso  for  the  construction  of  sections  of  the  Masalli\u2013Astara  expressway,  was  approved  in \nDecember 2011. \n \n8. \nProject 1 experienced initial implementation delays because (i) the implementing agency \nlacked  the  expertise  to  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  requirements  regarding  land  acquisition \nand resettlement (LAR); and (ii) the construction period was not synchronized with the working \nseason.  Project  costs  also  increased,  primarily  because of a sharp  rise  in the  cost  of fuel  and \nconstruction  materials,  and  the  failure  of  the  feasibility  study  to  account  for  certain  additional \nexpenditures.  Since  land  acquisition  for  the  entire  project  road  could  not  be  completed  in  a \ntimely manner, two sections of the project road were removed from the scope of project 1 and \nare  being  constructed  under  project  3.  With  continuous  ADB  monitoring  and  project \nmanagement  support,  implementation  of  project  1  has  accelerated  and  is  targeted  for \ncompletion by the end of 2013.  \n \n9. \nProject 2 did not have any LAR impacts, but the implementation progress has been slow \ndue  to  (i)  the  late  mobilization  of  the  contractor,  (ii)  delayed  customs  clearance  for  imported \nequipment,  and (iii)  low  rate  of  civil  works  progress  by  the  contractor.  Through  joint  efforts  by \nADB and the government, the civil works have been accelerating and will be completed by the \nend  of  2012.  Project  3,  which  is  undergoing  procurement,  is  targeted  for  completion  by \nDecember 2015. Like project 1, implementation of project 3 has been affected by increased cost \nestimates. Overall, the physical investment components under the first investment program are \nexpected  to  be  completed  as  designed.8 The  study  on  development  of  legal  and  regulatory \nframeworks  and  operational  procedures  for  toll  roads  is  ongoing.  This  will  create  an  enabling \nenvironment for private sector participation in road construction, operation, and maintenance. \n \n                                                \n5  The  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  prepared  a  RNDP  for  2006\u20132015  in  July  2006  with  an  estimated  cost  of  \n$5.3 billion (in 2006 prices). While the government undertook implementation of the road projects, implementation \nof  the  RNDP  was  slowed  by  delays  in  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  lack  of  project  readiness,  delays  in \nprocurement of works and consulting services, and lack of institutional capabilities. \n\n6  In support of implementing the SPPRED and other programs of the government, MOT prepared a transport policy \npaper, followed by a transport sector development strategy developed with ADB assistance:  ADB. 2006. Republic \nof Azerbaijan: Transport Sector Development Strategy. Baku. (Technical assistance consultant report). \n\n7  ADB.  2007.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Multitranche \n\nFinancing Facility to the Republic of Azerbaijan for the Road Network Development Program. Manila. \n\n8  At the request of the executing agency, the balance of the MFF funding totaling $44.6 million is available for any \n\nnew project meeting MFF criteria, or additional financing under tranches 1, 2, and 3, if required. \n\n\fNew  multitranche  financing  facility.  The  Alyat\u2013Masalli  motorway,  which  is  a  priority \n10. \nproject  under  the  government\u2019s  RNDP,  was  originally  planned  for  implementation  under  a \nhighway project financed by the World Bank. The World Bank dropped a road section of about \n63  km  (Masalli  to  Shorsulu)  for  its  financing,  primarily  because  of  cost  overruns  and  low \ndisbursement  rates  in  its  ongoing  projects. 9  However,  the  World  Bank  had  carried  out \npreparatory  work  including  detailed  designs,  cost  estimates,  and  safeguard  documents. \nLAR activities have been substantially completed in accordance with World Bank requirements. \nThus, given the level of project readiness, the government asked ADB to provide a new MFF to \nfinance  the  construction  of  the  motorway  between  Masalli  and  Shorsulu.  ADB  has  carried  out \ndue  diligence  on the World  Bank\u2019s  preparatory  documents  and  confirms that  they  comply  with \nADB policy requirements. \n \nThe  proposed  investments\u2014both  physical  and  nonphysical\u2014will  add  to  those  being \n11. \nsupported  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners  in  Azerbaijan.  Built  on  the  results  of  the \nongoing first Road Network Development Program (footnote 7) and using a holistic approach to \nthe road subsector, the new MFF will help make Azerbaijan\u2019s road network more effective and \nefficient.  It  will  include  a  capacity  development  component  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  through  training  in  planning,  project  preparation,  and \nproject  implementation.  The  capacity  development  will  also  assist  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies in (i) mainstreaming road safety audits during the design, construction, \nincluding  prescribing  road  safety \nthe  road  network, \nand \nimprovements; (ii) developing road standards and specifications, including for pavement layers \nunder  different  climatic  and  site  conditions;  and  (iii)  prioritizing  road  sections  for  long-term, \nperformance-based maintenance contracts. \n \n12. \nThe  government  has  selected  the  MFF  modality  to  finance  this  highway  section  based \non the experience with the first MFF and to ensure continuity. The MFF is the suitable funding \nmodality because of its flexibility and ability to sequence investments based on the readiness of \nthe  program.  In  addition,  the  country  allocation  limit  would  not  allow  a  stand-alone  loan  large \nenough to finance the entire 63 km road section. All the preconditions for the MFF are in place, \nincluding  a  coherent  strategy,  sector  road  map,  investment  and  financing  plans,  and  policy \nframework.  Preparatory  work  for  the  road  section  has  been  completed  and  is  ready  for \nimplementation  in  two  tranches.  Based  on  the  near-term  investment  requirements  of  the \ngovernment,  the  proposed  new  MFF  will  cover  80%  of  the  estimated  cost  of  the  investment \nprogram.  This  will  consolidate  the  partnership  started  under  the  first  MFF.  Lessons  from  the \nimplementation  of  the  first  Road  Network  Development  Program  and  from  World  Bank \nprojects\u2014such  as  cost  overruns,  slow  implementation,  and  low  disbursement  rates\u2014were \nconsidered in designing the new MFF.  \n \nB. \n\nimplementation  phases  of \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe impact of the investment program will be greater economic growth in Azerbaijan and \nexpanded  trade  with  neighboring  countries.  The  outcome  will  be  an  efficient,  adequate,  safe, \nand sustainable southern motorway corridor from Baku in Azerbaijan. \n \n\n                                                \n9  The  World  Bank  provided  additional  financing  to  cover  cost  overruns,  but  not  enough  to  cover  this  section.  \nIn addition, the World Bank policy restricts additional investment, as the disbursement rate is below the minimum \nrequirement. Hence, the World Bank cannot finance this section of the Alyat\u2013Masalli motorway. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nimproved  program  and  project  management,  and \n\n14. \nTranche  1.  The  outputs  of  tranche  1  will  be  (i)  about  30  km  of  the  newly  constructed \nroad  between  Masalli  and  Jalilabad,  a  section  of  the  Masalli\u2013Shorsulu  motorway;  and  \nimplementation  capacities  of \n(ii) \nAzerRoadServices (ARS). \n \n15. \nTranche  2.  The  outputs  of  tranche  2  will  be  (i)  about  33  km  of  the  newly  constructed \nroad  between  Jalilabad  and  Shorsulu,  a  section  of  the  Masalli\u2013Shorsulu  motorway;  (ii)  further \nimproved  program  and  project  management,  and  implementation  capacities  of  ARS;  and \n(iii)  improved  transport  sector  governance  through  mainstreaming  of  road  safety  audits  and \nimprovements, development of road and pavement standards and guidelines, and development \nof performance-based maintenance contracts. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Plan \n\n16. \nImplementation  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s  RNDP,  2006\u20132022  will  cost  about  $8.46  billion. \nThe new investment program will cost $625 million equivalent, with the cost of tranche 1 being \n$312 million equivalent (Table 1). \n \n\nTable 1: Investment Program \n($ million) \n\n \n\nItem \nA.

Domestic sources include the road fund restored in 2007 to finance road \nsubsector and budgetary allocation totaling about $2.6 billion. The government will also obtain \nfinancial assistance from multilateral and bilateral development partners, as well as commercial \nbanks.10 \n                                                \n10 In addition to ADB, other external aid agencies that have expressed a willingness to support implementation of the \nRNDP  include  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  and  the  World  Bank  (about  $1  billion \neach), and commercial banks (about $1.3 billion). The government is still seeking  additional funding to cover the \nbalance. \n\n \n\n\fThe government has requested an MFF in an amount up to $500 million equivalent from \n18. \nADB's  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help finance  part  of  the  investment  program,  which  will  in \nturn support a portion of the RNDP, 2006\u20132022. The MFF will consist of two tranches, subject to \nthe  government's  submission  of  related  periodic  financing  requests,  execution  of  the  related \nloan agreement for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings set \nforth  in  the  framework  financing  agreement.  The  first  tranche  of  the  MFF  will  have  a  21-year \nterm,  including  a  grace  period  of  4  years,  straight-line  repayment  method,  an  annual  interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin  the  draft  loan  agreement.  Based  on  these  loan  terms  and  repayment  method,  the  average \nloan maturity is 12.75 years and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \nThe financing plan is summarized in Table 2. The government\u2019s contribution will be used \n19. \nto  meet  land  acquisition  costs,  taxes  and  duties,  and  interest  and  other  charges  during \nconstruction. \n\n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n\nMFF \n500.0 \n125.0 \n625.0 \n\nAmount ($ million) \nTranche 1 \n250.0 \n62.0 \n312.0 \n\nTranche 2 \n250.0 \n63.0 \n313.0 \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n80.0 \n20.0 \n100.0 \n\nTotal \nMFF = multitranche financing facility. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n\n20. \nThe  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  ARS  will  be  the \nimplementing  agency.  To  administer  the  investment  program  effectively,  the  program  steering \ncommittee  chaired  by  a  deputy  minister  of  transport  to  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  first \nRoad  Network  Development  Program  will  continue  to  provide  overall  guidance  for  the \nimplementation of the new investment program. It will include representatives from the Cabinet \nof  Ministers,  Ministry  of  Economic  Development,  Ministry  of  Finance,  MOT,  ARS,  and  the \ndirector  of  the  project  implementation  unit  (PIU).  The  committee  will  meet  quarterly  to  monitor \nand  ensure  that  appropriate  measures  are  taken  for  the  timely  program  implementation. \nThe committee will support interagency coordination to facilitate timely approvals. \n \n21. \nARS will be responsible for daily implementation activities. ARS will expand the existing \nPIU  to  implement  the  investment  program.  Given  the  limited  technical  staff  in  the  PIU,  \na program management consultant will be engaged under tranche 1. Based on the consultant\u2019s \nperformance  under  tranche  1,  the  scope  of  the  contract  may  be  extended  to  cover  various \nstudies on transport sector governance under tranche 2 and to assist ARS with implementation \nof  the  entire  investment  program.  The  consultant  will  also  build  the  capacity  of  ARS  and  PIU \nthrough  on-the-job  training  and  other  specialized  training.  These  may  include  integrating \nclimate-proofing  measures  in  the  road  design,  procurement,  construction  monitoring  and \nmaintenance,  environmental  and  social  safeguards,  financial  management,  and  contract  and \nproject  management.  The  aim  is  to  enable  the  PIU  staff  to  handle  program  management \nindependently  in  future.  Thus,  the  consultant\u2019s  role  is  to  build,  not  to  substitute,  the  PIU\u2019s \ncapacity. The consultant will help ARS prepare project and program management reports to be \nsubmitted to MOT and ADB. \n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nThe program management consultant and the PIU will jointly oversee all activities during \n22. \nthe implementation of the investment program, including project preparation and administration, \nprocurement  of  works  and  consulting  services,  disbursements  and  financial  management, \ncompliance  with  safeguard  requirements,  and  reporting  to  MOT  and  ADB.  The  consultant  will \nintroduce  a  suitable  management  information  system  in  the  PIU  and  train  the  staff  to  achieve \nefficient and effective management of the investment program. The consultant will assist ARS in \npreparing and submitting flash reports and photographs concerning implementation progress of \neach  tranche.  The  consultant  will  also  submit  other  required  performance  and  monitoring \nreports  consistent  with  existing  project  implementation  requirements  and  compliance  with \ncovenants. \n \n23. \nProcurement  of  works  financed  by  the  MFF  will  follow  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2010,  as  amended from  time to time).  Consultant  recruitment  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  approved  advance \ncontracting  of  works  and  consulting  services  under  the  investment  program  on  4  July  2012. \nThe government has been advised that ADB approval of advanced contracting does not commit \nADB  to  financing  any  ensuing  projects  under  the  investment  program.  The  implementation \narrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in  detail  in  the  facility  administration \nmanual.11 \n\n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \nOctober 2012\u2013December 2020 \n30 June 2021 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body \n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii) Key implementing agency  AzerRoadServices \n(iv) Project implementation \n\nProgram steering committee \nMinistry of Transport \n\nPIU in Baku  No. of staff = 20 \n\nunit \nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n \n\nICB \n\n2 works contracts \n\nQCBS  \n\nQCBS \n\nQCBS  \n\nQCBS  \n\nICS \n\nConsulting services for construction \nsupervision under tranche 1 (one \ncontract) \nConsulting services for construction \nsupervision under tranche 2 (one \ncontract) \nProgram management consulting \nservices (up to two contracts) \nVarious studies for transport sector \ngovernance under tranche 2 (up to \nthree contracts)  \nTransport sector governance under \ntranche 2 (up to three contracts) \n\n$360 million (each contract $180 \nmillion) excluding taxes. \n$6 million (100 international and \n50 national person-months) \n\n$7 million (100 international and \n50 national person-months) \n\n$10 million (168 international and \n78 national person-months) \nTotal $6 million (120 international \nand 75 national person-months) \n\n$300,000 (9 international person-\nmonths) \n\nAdvance contracting \nDisbursements \n\nWorks and consulting services  \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nupon between the government and ADB. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  ICB  =  international  competitive  bidding,  ICS  =  individual  consultant  selection,  \nPIU = project implementation unit, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n                                                \n11 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe investment program, which will modernize the road network, does not present any \n24. \ntechnical  issues.  The  detailed  design  and  cost  estimates  prepared  by  the  World  Bank  have \nbeen  reviewed  through  value  engineering,  and  cost  estimates  were  updated.  During \nimplementation,  climate  change  impacts  will  be  minimized  and  greenhouse  gas  reduction \nmeasures will be employed. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nAn  economic  analysis12 of  the  investment  program  was  conducted  in  accordance  with \n25. \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.13 It  evaluated  the  benefits  with  and \nwithout  the  investment  program  using  the  highway  development  and  management  model.14 \nRoad traffic data were updated based on the elasticity of transport demand with respect to GDP. \nThe benefits are generated by the road being less congested, faster, shorter, and safer than the \nexisting  road.  The  investment  program  is  economically  viable,  with  an  estimated  economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  of  17.3%  and  an  estimated  net  present  value  of  $224  million  at  a  12% \ndiscount rate.  Sensitivity  analysis  confirms  the robustness  of  the  investment  program.  Overall, \nthe investment program is justified in social cost\u2013benefit terms. \n \nA  financial  analysis 15 of  the  investment  program  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with \n26. \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.16 Likely  toll  revenues \nwere considered in the analysis. The financial internal rate of return is estimated at 6.6%, which \ncompares well with the weighted average cost of capital (5.4%), indicating the financial viability \nof the investment program. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n27. \nInstitutional  capacity.  ARS  staff  involved  in  project  implementation  lacked  knowledge \nabout ADB\u2019s guidelines and requirements, which caused initial implementation delays under the \nongoing  projects.  To  address  this  weakness,  a  program  management  consultant  will  be \nengaged to train and assist ARS in implementing this investment program (paras. 21\u201322). \n \n28. \nProcurement.  Procurement  plans  will  be  developed  for  each  tranche.  ADB  will  review \nthe procurement and consultant selection processes at key stages. The bid documents will be \nbased  on  an  independent  engineer\u2019s  cost  estimates  and  international  best  practices.  Optimal \nqualification criteria will be prescribed to maximize competition. The construction period will be \nsynchronized with the climate cycle, and bidders will be given at least 8 weeks to prepare bids. \nADB will monitor procurement activities by ARS and participate in procurement and consultant \nselection. \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n12 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 ADB. 1997.

The  program \nmanagement  consultant  will  help  strengthen  the  financial  management  capacity  of  ARS. \nARS  received  World  Bank  assistance  to  develop  a  corporate  plan  and  a  manual  on  financial \nreporting  and  procedures.  The  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  assisted \nARS  in  implementing  the  corporate  plan.  With  external  assistance,  the  capacity  of  ARS  to \nmanage  the  implementation  of  externally  funded  projects  improved.  External  independent \nauditing of contracts, accounts, and financial statements will be undertaken to ensure fiduciary \noversight.  For  the  MFF,  MOT  and  ARS  will  maintain  separate  project  records  and  accounts \nadequate  to  identify  the  (i)  works  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  (ii)  financing \nresources received,  (iii) expenses  incurred  by  the components  of  each  project,  and (iv)  use of \ncounterpart  funds.  All  bidding  documents  for  contracts  will  specify  ADB\u2019s  right  to  audit  the \nrecords and accounts of all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. \n \n30. \nAnticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government, MOT, and ARS. Specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the facility administration manual (footnote 11). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe investment program\u2019s direct benefits to the poor are small. However, it will create an \n31. \nenabling environment for poverty reduction,  which includes (i)  lower transport costs, (ii)  additional \njobs  and  income  from  construction  and  maintenance  of  the  new  motorway,  and  (iii)  better \naccess to markets and social services.18 These will generate indirect benefits to the poor. \n \n32. \nThe investment program includes some gender elements in terms of improving women\u2019s \naccess to markets and services, generating opportunities for skilled women and offering women \nthe  chance  to  participate  in  monitoring  the  impact  of  the  investment  program.  The  investment \nprogram is linked to a pilot project to train women entrepreneurs to scale up their businesses, \nwhich  will  enable  them  to  benefit  from  better  access  to  markets.19 Improved  access  to  social \nservices, economic opportunities, and consumer choices is expected to increase the welfare of \nwomen,  raise  household  incomes,  enhance  the  achievement  of  the  Millennium  Development \nGoals, and reduce poverty. \n \n33. \nAll  projects  financed  under  the  MFF  will  include  appropriate  measures  to  raise  public \nawareness on the potential risks of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, as well \nas  drug  and  human  trafficking.  Contractors  will  be  required  to  take  measures  to  protect \nconstruction workers from the  risks of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, and \nto give construction workers time to be tested or receive treatment. The supervision consultant \nand  program  management  consultant  will  coordinate  with  the  contractors  and  monitor \nimplementation. \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n17 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 ADB.  2010.

An environmental assessment and review framework20 for the investment \n34. \nprogram  was  prepared  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  relevant  laws \nand  regulations  in  Azerbaijan.  The  proposed  motorway  is  on  a  new  alignment  with  a  7  km \nsection passing through wetlands. The sections to be financed by tranche 1 and 2 are classified \nas  environment  category  A.  The  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA) 21  reports  were \nprepared in 2007; the World Bank in 2011 prepared an addendum that looked more closely into \nthe wetlands and its environmental implications. Based on these reports, a single updated EIA \nwas  prepared  that  reflects  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement. The EIA recommends specific mitigation measures with regard to motorway design \nand construction and a robust long-term monitoring program. The contracts for the supervision \nconsultant, program management consultant, and civil works will include stringent provisions for \ncompliance  with  environmental  safeguards.  An  ecological  expert  and  environmental  specialist \nwill be engaged to ensure implementation of the environmental management plan. Assurances \nto  mitigate  potential  harm  to the  wetlands  are also included  in the  loan agreement,  framework \nfinancing agreement, and facility administration manual. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  A resettlement framework22 for the investment program was \n35. \nprepared  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  relevant  laws  and  regulations  in \nAzerbaijan,  and  adopting  the  rehabilitation  strategy  in  the  resettlement  policy  framework.  \nLAR activities were substantially completed based on the World Bank\u2019s resettlement plan, which \nthe  government  agreed  upon  under  the  earlier  World  Bank-assisted  highway  project.  A  due \ndiligence  assessment  confirmed  that  compensation  payments  were  made  following  the \nresettlement  policy  framework  agreed  upon  with  the  World  Bank  and  are  consistent  with  the \nrequirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Outstanding  LAR  activities  include \ncompensating the remaining 2% (15 privately owned plots) of households losing portions of their \nagricultural  lands,  paying  compensation  for  affected  municipal  land,  and  providing  additional \nrehabilitation assistance for severely affected and vulnerable households by prioritizing them for \ncivil works jobs. Tranche 1 is classified as category A for involuntary resettlement. For tranche \n1, a land acquisition and resettlement plan was prepared to cover the remaining LAR activities, \nincluding rehabilitation measures and actions to address temporary impacts and emerging LAR \nissues  during  implementation.  Both  the  LAR  framework  and  plan  were  disclosed  on  the  ADB \nwebsite  on  23  July  2012.  Implementation  of  the  LAR  plan  will  be  monitored  internally  and \nexternally.  The  program  management  consultant  will  conduct  refresher  training  for  the  land \nacquisition  department  of  ARS  and  respective  district  administrative  staff  on  safeguards,  and \nwill monitor LAR-related activities. \n \n36. \nIndigenous peoples. The investment program area does not have any known social or \ncultural  groups  classified  as  indigenous  peoples  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement. \nTranche 1 is classified as category C for indigenous peoples impact. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n37.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 \n \n                                                \n20 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nInadequate capacity of \nthe implementing \nagency to implement \nthe investment program \n\nCost overruns \n\nConstruction delays \ncaused by weather and \nsite conditions \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \nProgram management consultant will be engaged to assist ARS and PIU in \nimplementing the investment program and dealing with daily implementation \nmatters, including procurement, contract administration, and compliance with \nAsian  Development  Bank  safeguard  requirements,  to  augment  projects \nprogress.  \nThe cost estimates for civil works are based on the detailed design and the \nengineer\u2019s  estimates.  Value  engineering  analysis  and  due  diligence  was \ncarried out to ensure the adequacy of the cost estimates according to the site \nrequirements and market costs. Adequate contingencies are included in the \nfinancing plan in case cost estimates increase for unforeseen reasons. \nThe construction period will be aligned with the climate cycle. The civil works \ncontracts will prescribe a construction period, including the shutdown period \nfor  winters  and  rainy  season.  The  program  management  consultant  will \nclosely  monitor  the  situation  with  a  backup  plan  agreed  upon  with  the \ncontractor to minimize such delays. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe  government  and  MOT  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  investment \n38. \nprogram  shall  conform  to all  applicable ADB  policies  including those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the facility administration manual and loan documents. \n \n39. \nThe government and MOT have given ADB certain undertakings, which are set forth in \nthe  framework  financing  agreement.
