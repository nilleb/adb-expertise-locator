I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based grant to Nepal for the School Sector Program. The report also describes proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Capacity Development for School Sector Program Implementation, \nand if the Board approves the proposed grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, will approve the TA.1  \n \n2.  The program is a follow-on to the ongoing Education Sector Program, subprogram III,2 \nwhich supports the Government of Nepal's 7-year (FY2010\u2013FY2016) School Sector Reform \nProgram (SSRP). The SSRP is supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and eight \nother  development  partners3  using  the  sector-wide  approach  (SWAp).  Building  on  the \nachievements of the Education for All Program (2004\u20132009), the SSRP aims to (i) expand \naccess  and  equity,  (ii)  improve  quality  and  relevance,  and  (iii)  strengthen  the  institutional \ncapacity of the entire school education system. The Education Sector Program, subprogram III \nsupported the first 3 years of SSRP implementation, and this program will continue to support it \nduring  FY2012\u2013FY2014.  It  will  contribute  to  Nepal\u2019s  long-term  economic  and  social \ndevelopment through an equitable, efficient, and relevant education system. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Nepal is undergoing major change, mainly emanating from deep political changes over \nthe past two decades. This, in turn, is significantly impacting social transformation\u2014the clearest \nmanifestation of which is evident in the education sector, with rapid progress in participation and \ngender parity in school education. The sector may be characterized as having high demand, but \ninvestments have a long gestation period. The SSRP and this program must be viewed in this \ncontext. When the SSRP was designed (in the aftermath of the decade-long conflict), there was \na high level of optimism. But the protracted peace and constitutional drafting process and \nfrequent changes in government have made full implementation of the SSRP challenging.  \n  \n4.  Improving  equitable  access  to quality  education  is  accorded  the  highest  priority  on \nNepal\u2019s development agenda. Despite the challenging environment, successive governments \nhave shown a strong commitment to implementing the SSRP, which is reflected in the periodic \ndevelopment plans as well as government spending for education. In the first 2 years of SSRP \nimplementation,  substantial  progress  has  been  made  in  creating  an  enabling  policy \nenvironment.  The  government  has  approved  policies  for  free  basic  education,  minimum \nenabling  conditions  (MECs)  for  student  learning,  curriculum  reforms,  teacher  minimum \nqualification upgrading and equitable deployment, and capacity development at the district and \nschool levels. The new basic education cycle (grades 1\u20138) is in place and piloting of the new \nsecondary education cycle (grades 9-12) has been initiated in five districts. \n \n5.  Impressive progress has been made in sector performance, particularly in access to \neducation. Currently, about 95% of children have access to a primary school within 30 minutes\u2019 \n                                                      \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Asian Development \nFund Grant and Loan for Subprogram III to Nepal for Education Sector Program. Manila. \n3  The pooling partners include Australia, Denmark, the European Union, Finland, Norway, the United Kingdom, the \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund, and the World Bank including funds from the Fast Track Initiative. In addition, a \nnumber of non-pooling agencies support the SSRP. \n ", "2 \nwalking distance. In 2010, (i) the net enrollment rate (NER) in primary education reached 95%, \nand Nepal is on track to meet Millennium Development Goal 2 (achieving universal primary \neducation by 2015); (ii) the NER in basic education reached 86% and in secondary education \n27%; (iii) the share of grade 1 entrants with early childhood education and development (ECED) \nexperience was 52%; (iv) the percentage of fully trained teachers was 77% at the basic and \n74% at the secondary levels; and (v) literacy programs benefited 2.8 million participants in \n2008\u20132010. Good progress was also evident in gender equity and social inclusion (GESI): (i) \nthe gender parity index in NER reached 0.98 at all levels of primary and secondary education; \n(ii) the literacy rate of the 15+ age group reached 60% and its gender parity index 0.92; and (iii) \nshares of (a) Dalit (so-called untouchable caste) students (as a percentage of total enrollment) \nreached  18%  in  ECED,  20%  in  basic  and  9%  in  secondary  education;  and  (b)  Janajati \n(indigenous peoples) students 39% in ECED, 39% in basic and 38% in secondary education, \nboth roughly in line with their share in the general population.4 \n \n6.  The  progress  in  school  education  demonstrates  the  resilience  built  up  through \nincremental but critical reforms. This resilience stems mainly from the decentralized school \nsystem, which is a unique feature and strength of the education system in Nepal. However, \nrapid  expansion  in  access  has  underscored  the  urgency  of  ensuring  commensurate \nimprovements in quality, efficiency, and institutional capacity to manage an expanded and \ninclusive school system. In particular, the school sector faces continuing challenges in: (i) \nproviding quality basic education to hard-to-reach children from disadvantaged groups and \nareas; (ii)  ensuring  a  high quality  of  education;  (iii)  creating  an  enabling  and  safe  school \nenvironment; (iv) implementing an effective teacher management and professional development \nsystem;  and  (v)  strengthening  procurement,  financial  management,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation (M&E) capacity. \n \n7.  The  lessons  from  the  Education  Sector  Program,  and  noted  in  2009  ADB  country \nassistance performance evaluation,5 indicate that (i) difficult reforms are feasible even during a \nfragile political transition, through sustained support to the decentralized school system with \nschool-level  management  capacity  development;  (ii)  a  mature  SWAp  demonstrates  that \nsustained support to country systems enhances overall capacity of the government, including \nstronger program leadership and ownership; (iii) enhancing quality and efficiency in a rapidly \nexpanding system requires improvements in M&E and data quality to produce the desired \nresults; (iv) equitable improvements in student learning outcomes, particularly for disadvantaged \nchildren, require an integrated system-wide approach to GESI and investments in implementing \nMECs; and (v) the capacity of relevant central and local bodies must be enhanced to strengthen \ninternal control mechanisms to improve transparency and mitigate fiduciary risks. \n \n8.  The program will build on these achievements and lessons by sharpening the focus on \nimplementation of key policy reforms, including: (i) customized strategies for reaching out-of-\nschool children; (ii) enhancing student learning through meeting the MECs and assessment \nreforms; (iii) improving the safety of school buildings; (iv) strengthening the teaching force \nthrough better management, qualification upgrading, and increasing representation of women \nand  excluded  social  groups;  and (v)  strengthening  institutional  capacity for  effective  M&E, \nfinancial management, internal control and compliance, safeguards, and GESI implementation. \n                                                      \n4  Further information on sector performance is in Sector Assessment (Summary): Education (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5  ADB. 2009. Country Assistance Program Evaluation: Nepal\u2014Delivering Assistance in a Challenging Environment. \nManila.  Further information on  lessons  from  ADB engagement in  Nepal\u2019s  education  sector  is  available at: \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/PPARs/NEP/ppa-nep-18011.pdf \n ", "3 \nThe program will also make necessary adjustments, including: (i) re-costing and revising the \nSSRP financial plan for FY2012\u2013FY2014, (ii) assessing the fiduciary risks and incorporating \nadditional mitigating measures, (iii) updating the gender and vulnerable communities action plan \n(GVCAP)6 for coherent implementation throughout the entire system, and (iv) updating the \nenvironmental management framework. \n \n9.  The program will support the SSRP in accordance with the provisions set forth in the \nJoint Financing Arrangement (JFA)7 mutually agreed upon by the government and development \npartners. To ensure SSRP implementation as envisaged, the program has developed a number \nof policy conditions with which the government must fully comply to receive the grant. In view of \nthe pooled funding, the government and development partners follow a common SSRP results \nframework with agreed targets and performance indicators as summarized in the program \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). Some of these targets and indicators may be \nrevised during the joint midterm review of SSRP in early 2012. \n \n10.  The program has four special features: \n \n(i)  Stronger focus on gender, social inclusion, and quality. The program will focus \non equity and quality, and reinforce efforts to extend quality education to girls and \nchildren from vulnerable communities who are deprived as a result of gender and \nsocioeconomic  factors.  These  efforts  comprise  incentives  that  target  individuals \n(scholarships and incentives to needy students) and institutions (MECs to the most \ndisadvantaged basic education schools). \n(ii)  Strengthened  institutional  capacity  and  fiduciary  risk  management.  The \ncapacity of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Department of Education (DOE) \nto implement the program effectively is critical for program success, and requires \neffective  and  transparent  financial  management.  The  program  will  strengthen \ninstitutional capacity with a focus on program management, procurement, financial \nmanagement, and reporting systems, thereby helping mitigate fiduciary risks. \n(iii)  Greater focus on monitoring and evaluation. Good policy outcomes require policy \nmaking based on a robust understanding of what works and why. To achieve desired \nresults  and  address  governance  risks,  the  program  will  focus  on  establishing \nstronger  M&E  protocols.  Independent  validation  of  the  government\u2019s  education \nmanagement information system data will be undertaken, particularly in the areas of \nenrollments, textbook and scholarship distribution, and identification of schools for \ntargeted support. This will enable evidence-based interventions for high quality and \ninclusive education. \n(iv)  Innovative support for school safety. School buildings in Nepal are susceptible to \nmultiple hazards, such as earthquake, landslide, flood and storm, and those arising \nfrom  climate  change.  The  program  will  support  school  safety  as  an  essential \ncomponent of an enabling environment for student learning, a first for the education \nsector in Nepal. \n \n                                                      \n6  GVCAP is a detailed action plan with indicators and targets based on the Vulnerable Communities Development \nFramework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  Joint Financing Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  impact  of  the  SSRP  will  be  enhanced  educational  attainment  and  livelihoods, \nparticularly for girls and disadvantaged groups. The outcome will be increased access to and \nimproved  quality  of  school  education,  particularly  basic  education,  especially  for  girls  and \nchildren from disadvantaged groups. The program will support the SSRP, and its expected \nimpact and outcome will be consistent with the impact and outcome of the SSRP. \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The program is composed of five crosscutting outputs: (i) more equitable access to \nquality education, (ii) enhanced student learning, (iii) safer schools, (iv) enhanced teacher \nmanagement  and  development,  and  (v)  better  management  of  governance  risks  in  the \neducation sector. Social inclusion and quality are key objectives across the outputs. \n \n13.  Output 1: More equitable access to quality education. Despite substantial progress \nin expanding access to education, there are gaps in reaching the remaining out-of-school \nchildren in basic education, and retaining those in school. The program will support: (i) \nidentification of out-of-school children and development of customized interventions to bring \nthem into schools; (ii) scholarships and other basic and secondary  education incentives \nannually  for  more  than  3.8  million  girls  and  children  from  vulnerable  communities;  (iii) \nexpansion of ECED provision in poverty areas; and (iv) construction and rehabilitation of \nclassrooms and facilities in targeted schools to better serve disadvantaged students, especially \ngirls and students with disabilities. This output will help achieve the government\u2019s objective of a \nmore  inclusive  education  system.  Two  tranche  release  conditions  (TRCs)  are  included  to \nimplement strategic interventions to bring the out-of-school children to basic education schools. \n \n14.  Output 2: Enhanced student learning. The program will support quality improvement \nat the levels of inputs and processes. In terms of inputs, it will support government initiatives to: \n(i) ensure that all students receive the full set of textbooks within 2 weeks of the start of the \nacademic year, (ii) increase the percentage of new entrants in grade 1 with ECED experience, \nand (iii) implement MECs in the most deprived basic education schools. The program has \nidentified five priority MECs: provision of adequate numbers of classrooms, separate toilets for \ngirls and boys, textbooks, learning materials and/or book corners, and adequate teachers based \non the standard student\u2013teacher ratio (40:1). With respect to processes, it will support SSRP \ninitiatives to: (i) conduct the national assessment of student achievement for grades 3, 5, and 8; \n(ii) implement a continuous assessment system in the early grades; and (iii) scale up the \nprovision of multilingual education. The five TRCs in this output emphasize the implementation \nof priority MECs in needy schools, and national assessment of student achievement. \n \n15.  Output 3: Safer schools. The program will help improve school safety, especially in \ndensely populated areas, through: (i) vulnerability assessments; (ii) retrofitting and/or rebuilding \nof schools; (iii) providing training to teachers and students on best school safety practices; and \n(iv) training for masons, engineers and sub-engineers in construction of safe schools. The three \nTRCs in this output will require MOE to approve and implement the pilot school safety action \nplan and approve the comprehensive school safety action plan.  \n  \n16.  Output 4: Enhanced teacher management and development. A well-managed and \nqualified teaching force with role models for disadvantaged students is an essential component \nof quality improvement. The program will support government initiatives to: (i) enhance the \nqualification upgrading of basic school teachers; (ii) redeploy teachers based on the standard \n ", "5 \nstudent\u2013teacher ratio; and (iii) increase the proportional share of female, and Dalit and Janajati \nteachers as per the teacher service commission regulations. Decentralization poses significant \nchallenges  for  teacher  management,  and  the  program  will  also  support  the  design  and \nimplementation by the government of an effective teacher management system. The four TRCs \nin this output require MOE to (i) upgrade the academic qualifications of 7,000 teachers; and (ii) \ndevise and implement an action plan for effective teacher management. \n \n17.  Output 5: Better management of governance risks in the education sector. The \nprogram  will  support  the  government  to  improve  financial  management  and  procurement \nthrough initiatives to: (i) investigate and take appropriate actions on audit observations; (ii) \ninstitute a payroll system to disburse teachers\u2019 salaries through bank accounts; (iii) undertake \ntracking survey to check the flow of funds, particularly in the areas of textbooks, scholarships, \nand per capita funds; (iv) provide procurement training to the relevant staff in accordance with \nthe provisions in the amended Public Procurement Regulations; and (v) implement simplified \naccounting procedures and financial management training in all schools. The program will also \nstrengthen  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  through  initiatives  to:  (i)  improve  social \naccountability mechanisms; (ii) strengthen program implementation arrangements; (iii) enhance \nM&E, and educational and financial management information systems; and (iv) establish an \nincentive mechanism to promote good practices and innovations in the sector. The nine TRCs in \nthis output will help strengthen the management of governance risks in these two areas. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n18.  The revised estimated total cost for the SSRP for FY2012\u2013FY2014 is $2,705.8 million \nwhich includes all recurrent and investment costs (Table 1). This amount is 57% higher than \nwhat was originally estimated in 2009 for the same period. This is mainly due to faster than \nexpected  enrollment  growth,  significant  inflationary  pressures,  teacher  salary  adjustments, \nexpansion of the scholarship program, and the provision of free textbooks up to grade 10 \n(instead of grade 8). The currently projected available funding over the same period is estimated \nat  $2,365  million,  leaving  a  financing  gap  of  $340.9  million,  excluding  ADB\u2019s  proposed \nassistance. This gap starts in FY2012, increasing substantially thereafter over the next 2 years.8 \n \n19.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $65,000,000 from ADB's Special \nFunds resources to help finance the program. With this grant, the total ADB support to the \nSSRP in FY2010\u2013FY2014 will be $160 million. The terms and conditions for the grant will be as \nset forth in the draft grant agreement.9 The size of the ADB grant has been determined based \non the overall estimated cost of SSRP, the amount the government plans to allocate (defined by \nits  fiscal  space  and  the  Medium  Term  Expenditure  Framework),  ADB\u2019s  overall  assistance \nprogram to Nepal, and the pledged contribution from other development partners (as specified \nin the agreements signed with Ministry of Finance to date). Given the SWAp modality, the \nresources from development partners and the government are pooled and then allocated to \ncompeting needs in the sector. A significant portion of the ADB funding will be spent on \ntextbooks, physical infrastructure, scholarships, and teacher management and development \n(these areas represent the largest share of SSRP spending). ADB assistance through the \nprogram will narrow the financing gap from $340.9 million (12.6%) to $275.9 million (10.2%).  \n \n20.  The government is confident that it will be able to secure additional donor funding and \nincrease its own share to finance the gap. The World Bank is considering an additional grant of \n                                                      \n8  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  Grant Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nabout $75 million from 2012. The Government of Australia is also expected to provide additional \ngrant cofinancing equivalent to $4.1 million, of which $0.5 million will be provided for capacity \ndevelopment TA for output 3. The government accords high priority to the education sector as \nindicated in its budgetary allocation, which has doubled during FY2008\u2013FY2012, although the \nrelative share of education has cautiously kept at 16%\u201317% in the same period. If additional \ndonor funding is not available, the government is committed to increase its share to close the \nfinancing gap to achieve the SSRP results.    \n \nTable 1: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount  Share of  \n($ million)  Total Cost (%) \nADB (A)  65.0  2.4 \nDevelopment Partners (B)  264.5  9.8 \nAustralia: $15.6 million, Denmark: $17.9 million, EU/UK: $51.9 million, Finland: \n$13.2 million, FTI: $70.0 million, Norway: $22.4 million, UNICEF: $1.0 million, \nWorld Bank: $72.5 million \nGovernment (C)  2,100.5  77.6 \nTotal (A+B+C)  2,430.0  89.8 \nTotal SSRP Cost  2,705.8  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EU = European Union, FTI = Fast Track Initiative, FY = fiscal year, SSRP = School \nSector Reform Program, UK = United Kingdom, UNICEF = United Nations Children's Fund. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Ministry of Education estimates.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  Program management. MOE will be executing agency and DOE will be implementing \nagency. The program will follow the program management arrangements specified in the JFA \nfor SSRP. The JFA details the responsibilities of the government and the development partners, \nthe  funding  mechanism,  procurement,  reporting,  monitoring  and  auditing,  and  other \nadministrative requirements. The development partners meet regularly to review the financial \nstatus and implementation progress of the SSRP, and to commit and disburse funds. The \nprogram  will  focus  on  establishing  stronger  M&E  protocols,  strengthening  fiduciary  risk \nmanagement,  enhancing  results-based  consultative  decision  making  processes,  and \nimplementation of the governance and accountability action plan, and recommendations of the  \nperformance audits. \n \n22.  While  the  government  has  demonstrated  a  readiness  to  address  reported  financial \nirregularities during the first 2 years of SSRP implementation, its efforts have not been fully \neffective. This is primarily because of weak coordination and low capacity among MOE, DOE, \ndistrict education offices, and schools. As a result, the DOE has not been able to monitor district \nand school level expenditures and submit timely financial management reports (FMRs). Hence, \nin addition to the measures described in output 5 (para. 17), the program will strengthen \ncoordination  between  the  central  and  local  levels,  and  enhance  their  capacity  to  improve \nprogram management.  \n \n23.  Implementation period. The program will support the SSRP from January 2012 to July \n2014. The expected completion date will be 15 July 2014 and closing date 31 December 2014. \n \n24.  Disbursement arrangements. ADB disbursements to the government will depend on \nthe  government  fulfilling  the  tranche  release  conditions  as  outlined  in  the  Policy  Matrix \n(Appendix 4). The disbursements will be made in three tranches: a first tranche of $10 million in \n ", "7 \nFebruary 2012, a second tranche of $35 million in December 2012, and a third tranche of $20 \nmillion in December 2013. The proceeds of the grant will be disbursed to the Ministry of Finance \nas the recipient in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.10 The grant proceeds will be used to \nfinance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and \nprocured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items11 and imports financed by other \nbilateral and multilateral sources. No supporting import documentation will be required if, during \neach year that policy-based grant proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of total \nimports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed \nunder  other  official  development  assistance  is  greater  than  the  amount  expected  to  be \ndisbursed  during  that  year.  The  government  will  submit  with  each  withdrawal  request  a \ncertification confirming the government\u2019s compliance with the above formula in respect of the \nperiod covered by the withdrawal request. \n \n25.  All withdrawals from the grant account will be deposited in the pooled foreign currency \naccount (FCA) of the government established at the Nepal Rastra Bank. Under the JFA, the \ndevelopment partners have agreed to use the existing government system for disbursement and \naccounting  of  the  pooled  government  and  development  partner  funds.  MOE  will  use  the \ngovernment\u2019s reporting system to submit the FMR to the pooling development partners each \ntrimester. Reimbursement of the funds from the FCA to the government\u2019s consolidated account \nwill be  contingent upon timely and accurate submission of the actual expenditures through the \nFMR. The funds from the FCA will be transferred to the government\u2019s consolidated fund only \nupon the approval of the FMR by the pooling development partners. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n26.  Capacity development TA will be provided to MOE and DOE to assist them in effectively \nimplementing the program. Support will be provided for (i) data analysis; (ii) student learning \nassessment; (iii) teacher development; (iv) institutional capacity enhancement (in the areas of \nfinancial management, public expenditure tracking survey, procurement training, institutional \nanalysis, M&E, and social accountability mechanisms); and (v) program management.12 \n \n27.  The government has requested ADB to finance, on a grant basis, TA for $500,000 \nequivalent  to  be  funded  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV).  The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office, domestic \ntransportation, communication, and administrative support. The TA will commence in January \n2012 and end in July 2014, and require 4 person-months of international and 37 person-months \nof national consulting services. Consultants will be recruited individually and through a national \nfirm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from \ntime to time); TA disbursement will follow ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n                                                      \n10 ADB. 1998.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n28.  Economic viability. Three direct benefits resulting from the program can be identified: \n(i) an average 5% increase in the annual earnings of workers with 8 years of basic education; \n(ii) increased worker productivity; and (iii) improved internal efficiency and reduced educational \nwastage, including a reduction in the number of student years required to complete basic \neducation, from 11.5 to 9.7.13 In addition, a number of indirect benefits can be expected that are \ndifficult to quantify, including improved health and sanitation outcomes, improved agricultural \nproductivity, and more informed civic participation. \n \n29.  Fiscal sustainability. The sustainability of SSRP will depend primarily on two factors: \n(i) the ability of the government to allocate adequate budget to the education sector over time, \nand (ii) improvements in efficiency in the education sector as envisaged. As elaborated in the \nEconomic and Financial Analysis,13 the government\u2019s fiscal position is expected to improve in \nthe coming years. The much-anticipated conclusion of the protracted peace process and a \ngradual improvement in the business climate will likely put Nepal on a sustained higher growth \ntrajectory. These positive changes, coupled with the various tax reform initiatives to expand the \ntax base and eliminate leakages in collection, will create additional fiscal space over time \nenabling the government to increase the share of education spending in the total budget from \n16.3%  in  FY2010  to  19.8%  by  FY2016,  which  will  be  close  to  the  Fast  Track  Initiative\u2019s \nindicative target of 20%. The efficiency gains expected to accrue to Nepal\u2019s education sector as \na result of the reforms being supported by SSRP including restructuring of the school system, \nimproved financial management, and strengthened performance monitoring and evaluation will \nalso keep costs down while improving overall education outcomes. This will in turn help in \nreinforcing the long-term fiscal sustainability of Nepal\u2019s education sector. \n \nB.  Governance \n30.  Program-specific governance risks have been analyzed in line with the requirements of \nADB's  Second  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan.14  The  national  public  financial \nmanagement (PFM) system is generally well designed but unevenly implemented. There have \nbeen significant recent improvements in the public procurement system. For example, the \nProcurement Act, 2007 and the establishment of the Public Procurement Monitoring Office \nunder the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers have given direction for more \neffective procurement management, but require capacity enhancement and further reforms to \nminimize fiduciary risks. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the program. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n31.  Poverty incidence in Nepal has dropped to 25% in 2010 from 31% in 2005,15 but the \ndrop is less dramatic for vulnerable groups. The program will target disadvantaged groups and \npoverty areas in (i) provision of education of an acceptable quality, (ii) scholarships provision, \n                                                      \n13 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan. Manila. \n15 National Planning Commission and United Nations Development Programme. 2011. Millennium Development \nGoals: Needs Assessment for Nepal, 2010. Kathmandu.  \n ", "9 \n(iii) ECED coverage, (iv) promotion of education in mother-tongue up to grade 3, (v) provision of \nmidday meals, and (vi) recruitment of teachers from excluded groups.16 \n \n32.  Gender and development. Gender parity in NER reached 0.98 in primary, basic, and \nsecondary education in 2010, showing the contribution of SSRP in achieving gender equity in \naccess. However, efforts are required to improve retention and completion rates, and education \noutcomes for girls. Further, the share of women in the teaching force remains low. A GVCAP \nhas been developed to promote GESI across the system. Women\u2019s participation in teaching will \nbe increased as a result of the reservation policy introduced in January 2011, and through a \ngovernment  action  plan  to  encourage  admission  of  underrepresented  groups  in  teachers \ncolleges, and recruit and upgrade qualifications of under-qualified teachers from these groups. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n33.  Environment.  The  program  falls  into  environmental  category  B.  An  environmental \nassessment of the policy interventions shows that the construction and operation of school \ninfrastructure  may  have  some  minor  impacts  on  the  environment,  all  of  which  can  be \nmitigated.17  The  government  follows  the  National  Environmental  Guidelines  for  School \nImprovement and Facility Management for site selection, design, and monitoring construction of \nschool building and sanitation facilities. The guidelines also follow the National Building Code, \nwhich  aims  to  ensure  buildings  are  earthquake  safe.  The  program  has  prepared  an \nenvironmental management framework to ensure compliance with environmental safeguards. \n \n34.  Involuntary resettlement. The program falls into involuntary resettlement category C. \nThere  will  be  no  involuntary  land  acquisition  or  resettlement.  Land for  school  buildings,  if \nrequired, will be acquired only through either voluntary donation, or a willing buyer\u2013willing seller \napproach. A framework is in place to (i) establish voluntary donation and willing buyer\u2013willing \nseller procedures, including record keeping of the process and relevant information disclosure; \nand (ii) ensure that the government will follow the stipulated approach.18 \n \n35.  Indigenous peoples. The program falls into indigenous peoples category B because it \nwill have a positive impact on indigenous peoples, who are the direct program beneficiaries. \nNepal currently has 59 officially recognized Janajati groups (indigenous peoples) that together \nmake up about 38% of the population. A separate indigenous peoples\u2019 plan has not been \nprepared as indigenous peoples constitute the majority of program beneficiaries. The elements \nof an indigenous peoples\u2019 plan are included in the overall program design, with affirmative \naction in teacher recruitment, scholarship provision, multilingual education, and ECED provision. \nIndigenous peoples communities were consulted during the SSRP appraisal, and the GVCAP \nensures that they are beneficiaries of program implementation. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n36.  Political risks. The challenging security situation in some parts of the country makes \nit difficult to deliver educational services, and the program uses a peace building tool to help \nimprove children\u2019s access to education in these areas.19 Moreover, delays in writing the new \nconstitution have affected the approval of amendments to the Education Act, which in turn has \naffected  initiatives  to  formalize  secondary  education  restructuring.  Nonetheless,  while  the \n                                                      \n16 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 These are described in the Environmental Management Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n18 Framework for Land Acquisition through Voluntary Donation or Willing Seller\u2013Willing Buyer Process (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Peace Building Tool (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \ngovernment is committed to the amendments of the Education Act, MOE is carrying forward \nthe  reforms  in  an  incremental  manner  and  preparing  the  groundwork  for  full-scale \nimplementation once the required legislation is enacted. \n \n37.  Macroeconomic risks. Macroeconomic stability and sustained economic growth are \nkey to the government\u2019s ability to allocate sufficient resources to education. The government has \nreasonably maintained macroeconomic stability despite various challenges. Due to slower-than-\nexpected economic growth, continued support from development partners is essential to finance \nand sustain program implementation. Macroeconomic risks are minimal as both government \nand development partners have continued to accord high priority to education sector reforms. \n \n38.  Governance, including fiduciary, risks. An assessment undertaken by ADB indicates \nthat the program faces significant fiduciary risks.20 While a sound financial management policy \nis in place, and there are increased fund flows to local bodies in line with Nepal\u2019s strength in \ncommunity involvement, risks include those that arise from the absence of elected local bodies, \na  rigorous  M&E  protocol,  publicly  available  program-related  information,  and  financial \nmanagement capacity. The risks and mitigation measures identified concern improving financial \nmanagement  and  procurement,  monitoring  expenditures  and  performance,  strengthening \ncapacity and internal control as well as compliance mechanisms so that audit irregularities are \naddressed and school management committees receive targeted support.21 The government \nhas  committed  to  address  financial  management  issues  by  preparing  an  action  plan  and \nimplementing it with immediate effect. ADB will provide TA to implement this action plan, which \nwill complement the World Bank\u2019s oversight function for fiduciary risk management. Macro-level \nsteps are also being taken to mitigate systemic risks in PFM, procurement, and corruption. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n39.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, PFM, audits, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the JFA and grant documents. The government has agreed with ADB on the covenants for \nthe program, which are set forth in the grant agreement. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n40.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based grant would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, \nunder the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the \nBoard approve the grant not exceeding $65,000,000 to Nepal for the School Sector Program \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nUrsula Schaefer-Preuss  \nVice-President \n \n \n31 October 2011\n                                                      \n20 N.
