The  project  is envisaged  to (i)  play  a  demonstrative  role  for  rural \nareas with water pollution; (ii) promote regional public goods by reversing the negative impacts of \npollution;  and  (iii)  reduce  the  risk  of  future  epidemics,  which  is  strongly  required  after  the \ncoronavirus  disease (COVID-19)  pandemic. \n\ninformation \n\ninnovative \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n2. \nThe  Yangtze  River  Economic  Belt  (YREB)  covers  nine  provinces  and  two  specially \nadministered  cities  in  the  Yangtze  River  Basin.  It  accounts  for  more  than  40%  of  the  PRC\u2019s \npopulation  and has 40% of the freshwater  resources.  It also serves  as the drinking  water source \nfor 400 million people, provides 60% of the total fisheries production, has 20% of the total wetland \narea, and contributes  about 45% of the PRC\u2019s economic  output. The YREB has been earmarked \nas one of three key growth engines to ensure the PRC\u2019s future economic  development.2 \n\n3. \nThe  YREB  has  benefited  from  extensive  development  since  the  1990s.  Yet,  economic \ngrowth  in  the  middle  and  upper  reaches  of  the  Yangtze  River  Basin  is  lagging  and  below  its \npotential capacity.  The middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River Basin still face significant \ndevelopment  challenges because of (i) slow transformation  for green development and economic \ndiversification;  (ii) limited integration  of waterways,  ports, and intermodal  logistics;  (iii) increasing \npollution  and pressure  on natural resources;  and  (iv) weak institutional  coordination  for strategic \nplanning. 3  The  YREB  faces  a  growing  imbalance  between  economic  achievements  and  the \nquality  of the environment.  For example,  since  1980, water  pollution  in the  Yangtze  River  Basin \nhas  risen  by  73%  because  of  the  discharge  of  waste;4 soil  erosion,  which  is  critical  in  small \nwatersheds;5  and agriculture-related  nonpoint  source (NPS) pollution. \n\nTo  address  these  challenges,  the  Government  of  the  PRC  formulated  the  YREB \n4. \nDevelopment  Plan,  2016\u20132030,6  which  stipulates  the  prioritization  of  ecological  protection  and \nthe  promotion  of  green  development  as  the  guiding  principle  for  the  YREB  development. 7  In \n\n \n\n1  Eco-compensation  is  a  payment  and  incentive  system  that  supports  sustainable  ecosystems,  provides  stable \nfinancing for conservation,  and\u2014when  strategically  designed\u2014can  address  livelihood  issues  for the rural poor. \n2  The  other  flagship  projects  are  the  Belt  and  Road  Initiative  and  the  Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei  Integrated  Regional \n\nDevelopment  Strategy. \n\n3  Asian  Development  Bank (ADB). 2016.  Yangtze  River Economic  Belt  Environmental  Protection  and  Rehabilitation \n\nProject\u2014A Preliminary  Study. Consultant\u2019s  report.  Manila (TA 9044-PRC). \n\n4   The  upper  and  middle  reaches  of the  Yangtze  River Basin  account  for 80%  of the  YREB\u2019s  wastewater  discharge, \nand the tributaries  have the worst water quality in the basin.  Among the rural villages  in the YREB, about 40% do not \nhave garbage  collection  facilities and about  80% lack basic sewage  treatment. \n\n5  Every year, the Yangtze  River Basin  loses  2.24  billion  tons  of soil,  damaging  67,000  hectares  of farmland because \n\nof soil erosion. \n\n6  Government of the PRC. 2016.  Outline of the Yangtze  River Economic Belt Development  Plan,  2016\u20132030.  Beijing. \n7  Green  development  aims  to  (i)  change  the  traditional  development  model  to  a  sustainable  development  model, \n\n(ii) address  the challenges  of rapid urbanization,  and  (iii) serve as a guide  to socioeconomic development. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nrelation  to  this,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  government  agreed  to  adopt  a \nframework  approach,  providing  about  $2.0  billion  of  funding  in  the  YREB  during  2018\u20132020  to \nstrategically  program  ADB\u2019s lending  support  for development  initiatives  in the YREB,  prioritizing \nthe following four areas: (i) ecosystem restoration, environmental protection, and water resources \nmanagement;  (ii) green  and inclusive  industrial  transformation;  (iii) construction  of an integrated \nmultimodal  transport corridor; and (iv) institutional strengthening  and policy reform. \n\n5. \nZhaotong  City  of  Yunnan  Province  has  been  selected  to  demonstrate  water  pollution \nreduction  in  the  Sayu  River  Basin.  Zhaotong  has  one  district,  one  county-level  city,  and  nine \ncounties, of which the district  and all counties are nationally designated  poverty areas. Zhaotong \nhas 1,336,700 poor people\u2014the  largest poor population  in Yunnan  (as of 2016). The Sayu River \nis  a  186-kilometer  long  tertiary  tributary  of  the  Yangtze  River.  The  Sayu  River  Basin,  covering \n3,558 square kilometers, is an important area for ecological protection in the upper Yangtze River \nBasin.  It  is  the  only  centralized  drinking  water  source  in  Zhaotong.  Urban  drinking  water  is \nprimarily  provided  from  the  Yudong  Reservoir.  The  entire  Yudong  Reservoir  Basin  is  part  of \nLudian  County  and Zhaoyang  District  in Zhaotong.  Water in the  Sayu River  Basin, including  the \nYudong  Reservoir,  is polluted because  of (i) waste discharging  in the Sayu River  Basin, (ii) high \nsediment  runoff  into  the  Sayu  River  because  of  soil  erosion,  and  (iii) agriculture-related  NPS \npollution. In many locations of the Sayu River, the water quality is worse than the Class III national \nstandard, which is unfit for drinking.8  Local people living around the Sayu River Basin, particularly \nwomen and the poor, suffer from water pollution. Poor water quality also increases the time spent \nby women  seeking clean water for their families. \n\n6. \nRural domestic wastewater,  solid waste, and human and animal wastes pollute the water \nin the Sayu  River Basin because  of inadequate  waste  management.  Rural domestic  wastewater \nand solid waste contribute  27% of the chemical oxygen  demand (COD), 9% of the total nitrogen, \n16%  of the  total  phosphorus,  and  22%  of the  ammoniacal  nitrogen  (NH3-N)  in  the Sayu  River. 9 \nHuman and animal wastes contribute  39% of the COD, 25% of the total nitrogen, 52% of the total \nphosphorus,  and 48%  of the NH3-N in the  Sayu River  (footnote  9). Since  forest  coverage  in the \nSayu  River  Basin  is  only  30.2%  because  of  the  expansion  of  farmland,  which  is  significantly \nsmaller than the 60%\u221270% appropriate for centralized drinking water sources, soil erosion is quite \nserious  in  this  basin.  About  57.9%  of  the  Sayu  River  Basin  is  prone  to  soil  erosion,  providing \n1.1 million tons  of soil per year.  High sediment  runoff  caused by  soil erosion  contributes  34% of \nthe  COD,  21%  of the  total  nitrogen,  11%  of  the total  phosphorus,  and  18%  of  the NH3-N  in the \nSayu  River  (footnote  9).  Water  in  the  Sayu  River  Basin  is  further  deteriorated  by  agriculture-\nrelated NPS pollution because  of inadequate  waste management  systems,  uncontrolled  fertilizer \nrelease, and outdated  production systems. Agriculture-related  NPS pollution (e.g., farmland solid \nwaste and fertilizer) contributes  45% of the total nitrogen, 21% of the total phosphorus,  and 12% \nof the  NH3-N in the Sayu  River  (footnote  9). It also  contributes  to climate  change  through  direct \nand indirect emission  of greenhouse  gases. This situation  may be aggravated  by intensified  and \nmore frequent rainfall events induced by global climatic changes,  which contribute  to soil erosion \nand agriculture-related  pollution  to water systems. \n\n \n\n8  Following  the PRC\u2019s Environmental  Water Quality Standard  (GB 3838-2002). \n9  Zhaotong  City Government.  2015.  Zhaotong  Yudong  Reservoir Water  Resources  Protection  Special  Remediation \nPlan,  2015\u20132020.  Zhaotong.  In 2013,  the Sayu River had 14,345.51  tons  of the COD, 75,655  tons  of total  nitrogen, \n3,818.98  tons of total phosphorus,  and 185.12  tons  of the NH3-N.  \n\n\fCapacity  is  lacking  for  holistic  planning,  financing,  and  implementing  of  water  pollution \n7. \nreduction  activities.10  Public  awareness  of  water  pollution  problems,  particularly  interlinkages \nbetween household and economic activities and water quality, is also insufficient. As Zhaotong is \nconsidered  a poor  city,  it  urgently  needs  a  sustainable  financing  mechanism  for investments  to \naddress water pollution  sustainably. \n \n8. \nIn  2006,  the  Zhaotong  City  Government  (ZCG)  established  a  fund  for  ecological \nrestoration  and remediation  of water source protection  areas of the Yudong  Reservoir. The ZCG \nprovided  CNY3  million  to  the  fund  every  year  from  2006  to  2014.  Since  2015,  the  fund  has \nreceived  CNY17 million  annually.11 Deficiencies  of  this  fund  include  the  small  contribution  from \nbeneficiaries\u2014only  CNY2  million  out  of  CNY17  million  annually  (footnote  11);  and  lack  of \noperational  procedures  of  a  committee  managing  the  fund,  including  criteria  for  screening  of \nactivities proposed  for financing  from the fund. The ZCG would like to upgrade the fund to a new \neco-compensation  fund,  incorporating  international  good  practices  for  sustainable  financing \nmechanisms.  In 2018,  the ZCG  established  a district-  and  county-level  horizontal  (i.e., between \nthe  same  levels  of  local  government)  eco-compensation  mechanism,  which  consists  of \n14 horizontal  eco-compensation  agreements  for  17  river  sections  crossing  the  borders  of \nZhaotong\u2019s  one  district,  one  county-level  city,  and nine  counties.12 However,  these  agreements \nhave not yet been implemented  because of lack of water quality monitoring facilities.   \n\nIn February 2018,  the State Council  of the PRC promulgated  a policy on rural vitalization \n9. \nas a driver for the PRC\u2019s modernization  goals and for building  a moderately  prosperous  society. \nThe  policy  targets  establishing  an  institutional  framework  by  2020,  modernizing  rural  areas  by \n2035,  and  beautifying  the  countryside  by  2050.  Local  governments  will  formulate  and  start \nimplementing  their  plans,  aimed  at  improving  public  services  and  promoting  environmental \nprotection,  during  2018\u20132022.  Yunnan  Province,  particularly  Zhaotong,  will  be  a  government \npriority for this policy implementation.13 \n\nCOVID-19 pandemic.  The COVID-19  pandemic has amplified  the effects of interlinkages \n10. \nbetween  biodiversity,  public  health,  and ecosystem-dependent  global  supply  chains.  COVID-19 \nis  being  contained  in  the  PRC,  but  it  remains  a  risk.  With  COVID-19  as  a  trigger,  the  need  for \nmeasures  to prevent the spread of future infectious  diseases is attracting  attention. \n\n11. \nStrategic  fit.  The  project  aims  to  demonstrate  water  pollution  management  in  the \nSayu River Basin. This will contribute to the PRC\u2019s goal of building a harmonious  and prosperous \nsociety  through  environmentally  sustainable  growth;  and  is  consistent  with  (i)  the  PRC\u2019s \n\n \n\n10 An example is the  \u201criver chief\u201d system. The  \u201criver chief\u201d system was introduced  in the PRC in  2017.  It assigns  each \npart of a river and lake to a certain official. Currently, river chiefs have difficulties collecting the data  and information \nnecessary  for river management. \n\n11 This  comprises  CNY8  million  from  the  ZCG,  CNY5  million  from  the  Zhaoyang  District  Government  (ZDG), \nCNY2 million  from the Ludian  County Government (LCG), and CNY2 million  of water resources  utilization  fees from \na downstream  hydropower  station  every year. Zhaoyang  District  and Ludian  County  are in  Zhaotong  City, and  the \nLCG and the ZDG are the project implementing  agencies  (Table 3). \n\n12 Each  agreement  is  for one  to  three  river  sections  crossing  the  border.  Compensation  is  paid  based  on  the  water \nquality at the border. Of the 14 agreements,  one is for the Longshu  River in the Sayu River Basin and two other rivers \noutside  the  Sayu  River Basin,  signed  by the  LCG and  the  ZDG. Each  of them  provides  CNY2.0  million  per  year; \nCNY2.4 million  is  allocated  to  the  upstream  LCG  and  CNY1.6  million  to  the  downstream  ZDG.  At  the  border  of \nZhaoyang  District and Ludian  County, the water quality  of the  Longshu  River and two other rivers in the  Sayu River \nBasin  is measured  monthly (36  sets  of monitoring  data/year).  Every year, CNY2.4  million  multiplied  by the ratio  of \nmonitoring  data  number  which did  not meet the  standard  agreed  between  the  LCG and  the ZDG is  deducted  from \nthe LCG and added  to the ZDG.  \n\n13 State Council of the PRC. 2018.

This  includes  (i)  the  development  of  waste  management  systems,  particularly \ndistributed  systems,  which  have  advantages  over  the  traditional  centralized  system  (e.g.,  lower \noperational  cost);  (ii)  the  development  of  solid  waste  management  systems,  including  garbage \npyrolysis  facilities,  with  capacity  and  institutional  development  for  garbage  classification  and \ncollection;  (iii) the  development  of  pilot  eco-villages  to reduce  emissions  through  environmental \nprotection  activities,  education,  and  publicity;  (iv)  wetland  construction  to reduce  NPS pollution, \nintroducing  new  types  of  artificial  wetlands  combined  with  wastewater  treatment  facilities; \n(v) afforestation  and  the  establishment  of  a  quantifiable  soil  and  water  conservation  model  to \nestimate  afforestation\u2019s  effects  on  soil  and  water  conservation  based  on  tree  species,  planting \ndensity,  age of trees,  and slope degrees;  and (vi) the promotion  of low-emission  agriculture  with \ninnovative technologies  (ecological drainage ditches, gridded surface source pollution monitoring \nplatforms,  and  measures  to  estimate  at  least  necessary  fertilizer  volume)  and  incentives \n(establishing  green  and  organic  crop  brands).  The  project  will  conduct  baseline  and  \u201cendline\u201d \nsurveys  to  compare  the  amount  of  time  women  spend  on  waste  and  solid  waste  management \nbefore and after the project.20 \n\n14. \nOutput  2:  Water  resources  management  in  the  Sayu  River  improved.  This includes \n(i) the establishment of a smart water integrated management platform by constructing monitoring \nfacilities  and  integrating  them  with  the  existing  irrigation  area  information  system  for  real-time \nmonitoring  and  actions in the  event of water  quality deterioration;  and (ii) the  establishment  of  a \nriver protection model that links the existing river chief system in the PRC, a real-time water quality \nmonitoring  system  (a  subsystem  of  the  smart  water  integrated  management  platform),  and \nfacilities to protect rivers from pollution  (e.g., ecological embankments). \n\n15. \nOutput 3: Eco-compensation  mechanism  for the Sayu River Basin established.

While  the  horizontal  eco-compensation  agreements  incentivize  good  upper  basin \nmanagement and cost-sharing between upstream and downstream governments, (i) they lack the \ninvolvement  of  ecosystem  services  providers  and  beneficiaries  and  value  flow  between  the \necosystem  service  providers  and  beneficiaries;  and  (ii)  compensation  amounts  to  upstream \ngovernments  are small and insufficient  for interventions  needed in the upstream areas. The eco-\ncompensation  fund  will  make  up  for  these  shortcomings  of  the  horizontal  eco-compensation \nagreements. It will be established by improving the fund for ecological restoration and remediation \nof water source protection  areas of the Yudong Reservoir  (para. 8). The eco-compensation  fund \nwill  provide  grants  to  relevant  government  agencies  and  private  companies,21  for  (i)  activities \nunder Output 1, including wastewater  management,  solid waste management,  pilot eco-villages, \noperation  and maintenance  (O&M)  of the constructed  wetlands,  compensation  for the farmland-\nto-forest  conversion,  and  promotion  of  low-emission  agriculture;  (ii)  the  operation  of  the  river \nprotection model established under Output 2; (iii) the implementation  of the seven horizontal eco-\ncompensation  agreements  under  Output  3  (para.  15);  and  (iv)  management  of  the  eco-\ncompensation  fund,  excluding  any  civil  works.  The  fund  will  be  initially  supported  by  the  ZCG, \nLCG,  ZDG,  ADB,  and  a beneficiary,22  with  the  longer-term  goal  of collecting  more  funding  from \nbeneficiaries,23  to improve the sustainability of the fund and strengthen the direct linkage between \nupstream  eco-service  providers  and downstream  beneficiaries,  following  the principle  that those \nwho benefit should compensate. Assurances are included in the project agreement to ensure and \nincrease  contributions  to  the  fund,  particularly  from  beneficiaries.  An  eco-compensation  fund \nmanagement  committee (EFMC), of which women will comprise at least 35%, will be established \nin the ZCG.24 The EFMC will conduct screening  of activities proposed  for financing  from the eco-\ncompensation  fund,  following  an environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS,  paras. \n38\u221240).  The  Yudong  Reservoir  Water  Resources  Protection  Committee  Office  (YWPCO)  in the \nZCG  will  open  and  manage  an  account  for  the  eco-compensation  fund;  and  manage  the  fund, \nfollowing the decisions of the EFMC.25    \n\nOutput  4:  Education,  capacity,  and  public  awareness \n\n18. \nfor  water  pollution \nmanagement  strengthened.  This includes (i) capacity development of government  staff on rural \n\nwith the ZDG or the LCG. \n\n \n\n21 Private companies will operate  a wastewater  treatment plant or conduct solid waste management based on contracts \n\n22 From  2023,  annual  contributions \n\nfund  will  be  as  follows:  ZCG,  CNY8  million; \nZDG, CNY5 million;  and  LCG,  CNY2 million.  Some  CNY2  million  of  water  resources  utilization  fees  from  the \ndownstream  Baoho  hydropower  station  will  be  contributed  to  the  fund  every  year  from  2023.  An  ADB  loan  of \n$5 million  will be contributed  to the fund during  the project. \n\nto  the  eco-compensation \n\n23 Beneficiaries  will include  downstream  water and  hydropower users,  irrigation  water users,  and the business  sector. \n24 The chair  of the EFMC will  be the  vice mayor of the ZCG; and  the  members will be  the deputy  directors  general  of \nabout  10  ZCG  agencies,  including  the  Zhaotong  City  Development  and  Reform  Committee,  the  Zhaotong  City \nFinance  Bureau, and the Zhaotong  City Environment and Ecology Bureau. \n\n25 About 15 full-time staff of the YWPCO, which manages  the fund for ecological restoration  and remediation  (para.  8), \n\nwill manage the new eco-compensation  fund. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nwater  pollution  management  and eco-compensation;  (ii) the education  of students  in rural water \npollution  management  and  eco-compensation;  (iii)  public  awareness  raising;  and  (iv) the \ndissemination  and replication of project initiatives, with at least 40% participation  by women. \n\nLessons.  The  project  design  has  incorporated  lessons  from  international  practices  and \n19. \nprevious  ADB-financed  projects  and  studies  on  the  IWRM  and  environmental  and  ecosystem \nimprovement,  such  as  the  importance  of  (i)  implementation  arrangements  for  funds, 26  (ii) \npromoting  the  IWRM  at  river  basin  scale  by  prioritizing  upstream\u2013downstream  and  urban\u2013rural \nlinkages,  (iii)  promoting  nature-based  solutions,  (iv) strengthening  nonstructural  measures,  (v) \nsupporting  institutional  reforms  that  contribute  to  sustainable  IWRM,  (vi)  providing  capacity \ndevelopment  for  project  implementation  and  the  O&M,  and  (vii)  establishing  an  effective \nmonitoring  and evaluation  system for project performance. \n\nC. \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n20. \nThe  project  has  added  value  through  integrated  water  pollution  management,  with \ninnovations, including (i) distributed wastewater management systems with innovative information \ntechnology for operation and management,  operated at low cost; (ii) animal feces collection tanks \nusing a new material; (iii) garbage pyrolysis facilities with a shorter processing cycle, smaller floor \nspace,  and  maximum  volume  reduction;  (iv) pilot  eco-villages  to  demonstrate  integrated \nemissions  management;  (v)  introducing  new  types  of  artificial  wetlands;  (vi)  establishing  a \nquantifiable  soil  and  water  conservation  model,  which  will  enable  quantitative  estimates  of \nafforestation\u2019s  effects  on  soil  and  water  conservation;  (vii)  promoting  low-emissions  agriculture \nwith  innovative  technologies  and  incentives;  (viii) establishing  a  river  protection  model  with \ninnovative  information  technology  and  institutional  development;  and  (ix) establishing  and \nimplementing  horizontal  eco-compensation  mechanisms  and  an  eco-compensation  fund  as  a \nsustainable  funding  mechanism  for  water  pollution  management.  Experience  and  knowledge \ngained  through  the  project  can  be  replicated  in  other  small  tributaries  in  the  upper  and  middle \nreaches of the Yangtze River, which account for 80% of wastewater, and in other key river basins \nin Asia and the Pacific. Consultants  will assist in the replication  through workshops,  publications, \ndisclosure  of  project  information  on  websites,  submission  of  papers  to  academic  associations, \nand proposing of the project as a model for eco-civilization  and awards. \n\n21. \nResponse to COVID-19 pandemic. The project will contribute to the holistic development \nof the YREB by shifting traditional investments  toward valuing nature and reducing inequalities in \nrural areas.  This is part of the nature-positive  stimulus  package for recovery  from the COVID-19 \npandemic  which will promote a greener and healthier growth model. \n\n22. \nAlthough  COVID-19  is  being  contained  in  the  PRC,  measures  to  prevent  the  spread  of \nfuture  infectious  diseases  are  strongly  required  for  the  post-COVID-19  world.  The  project  will \nreduce  the  risk  of  future  epidemics  by  creating  a  safe  and  healthy  living  environment  through \nstrengthened wastewater and solid waste management and pollution control and improved quality \nof source water for water supply. \n\nD. \n\nSummary  Cost Estimates  and Financing Plan \n\n23. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $234.61  million  (Table  1).

A project  leading  group  has  been  established  in \nthe  ZCG  under  which  a  project  management  office  (PMO)  has  been  established.  The \nimplementing  agencies will be the YWPCO,  ZDG, and LCG. In the ZDG and LCG, a local project \nleading  group has  been established  under  which  a local  PMO has  also been established.  Since \nthe ZCG, including  the YWPCO, LCG,  and ZDG, do not have experience  with the ADB projects, \nadequate training will be provided to relevant staff, particularly for social and safeguard measures. \nThe implementation  arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM. \nThese will not be affected by the COVID-19  pandemic (para. 23). \n\nAspects \nImplementation  period \nEstimated  completion  date \nEstimated  loan closing  date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iv)  Implementation  unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting  services \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nTable 3: Implementation  Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nNovember 2020\u2013June  2026 (project completion  date)  \n30 June 2026 \n31 December 2026 \n\nProject leading  group \nMayor, ZCG (chair) \nVice mayor, ZCG (vice chair) \nDeputy secretary, ZCG; and representatives  of relevant  ZCG agencies  (members) \nZCG \nYudong  Reservoir Water Resources  Protection  Committee Office, Zhaoyang \nDistrict Government, and Ludian  County Government \nPMO in the ZCG, 31 staff \nLocal PMO in Zhaoyang  District Government, 36 staff \nLocal PMO in Ludian  County Government, 32 staff  \nOpen competitive bidding \n(nationally  advertised) \nIndividual  consultant \nselection \n$314,000 \nCQS \nQCBS \n$1,802,000 \nAdvance contracting and retroactive financing  will apply to consultants.

Recommendations  by  ADB,  including  the  addition  of \ninnovative technologies and arrangements, were incorporated in the project design. The technical \nfeasibility  was  confirmed  to be adequate  after  detailed  examination  of  the project\u2019s  compatibility \nwith local conditions and local capacity for the O&M. The designs of wastewater  correction pipes, \nmanure  collection  tanks,  artificial  wetlands,  afforestation,  irrigation  facilities,  drainage  ditches, \nintegrated  management  platform,  capacity \necological  embankments, \n\nthe  smart  water \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fdevelopment,  and  education  were  determined  considering  risks that  may  be  caused  by  climate \nchange, such as the increasing  frequency and extent of heatwaves,  floods, and droughts. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic  and Financial  Viability \n\n29. \nThe economic analysis for the project comprised least-cost and benefit\u2013cost analyses, an \nevaluation  of  demand,  and  a  poverty  analysis.  The  least-cost  analysis  tested  key  project \ncomponents:  wastewater, animal feces, and solid waste management; wetland construction;  and \nis \necological  embankment  construction.  The  net  present  value  of  project  benefits \nCNY344.74  million.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  12.2%  for  Output  1,  which  exceeds \nthe 9% threshold; and 8.1% for Output 2 (focusing on instream water quality), which exceeds the \nlower environmental  threshold  of 6%. The results of the sensitivity  analysis show that the project \neconomic  viability  is  sufficiently  robust  to  several  adverse  scenarios.  A  poverty  impact  ratio  of \n0.32 was estimated  in the benefit distribution  and poverty  impact analysis.29 \n\n30. \nThe  financial  analysis  focused  on  the  project\u2019s  financial  sustainability.  Incremental \nrecurrent cost analyses for the ZDG and LCG, which are responsible  for the O&M of the facilities \nconstructed  under  the project, were conducted  to determine  the project\u2019s  financial  sustainability. \nThe financial analysis  confirmed  the financial  capacities  of the two entities to cover the recurrent \ncosts of the project to sustain the facilities. The project is considered  financially  sustainable. \n\nC. \n\nSustainability \n\n31. \nAdequate  consulting services  will be provided during project implementation  for the O&M \nof the  facilities  constructed  under  the  project  and  the institutional  and  capacity  development  for \nwater  pollution  management  and  eco-compensation.  The  eco-compensation  mechanisms, \nparticularly the eco-compensation  fund, were designed to improve the sustainability  of the project \nsince the fund will be utilized for the O&M of the facilities constructed  under the project, reducing \nthe  fiscal  burden  on  governments\u2019  budgets.  Conservative  estimates  of  funding  to  the  eco-\ncompensation  fund and planned  investments  from the fund  confirmed  the fund\u2019s sustainability.30 \nSince the governments assured that they will provide the necessary counterpart funds to establish \nthe eco-compensation  fund, the risk to its financial  sustainability  is moderate. \n\nD. \n\nGovernance \n\n32. \nThe  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  moderate  because  of  key \nfinancial  management  risks,  including  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies\u2019  lack  of \nexperience  with  the  ADB  projects;  and  inadequate  coordination  between  relevant  agencies  for \neffective financial management,  which will be mitigated through the financial management  action \nplan described in the PAM.31 \n\n33. \nThe project procurement  risk assessment confirms that the implementing agencies, which \nwill  conduct  procurement  through  a  procurement  agency  with  the  assistance  of  ADB  and \nconsultants,  have  adequate  capacity to comply  fully with the ADB Procurement  Policy  (2017, as \namended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time). Overall, the procurement  risk is low after mitigation measures are considered. \n\n \n\n29 Economic Analysis  (accessible  from the list  of linked  documents in Appendix  2). \n30 Cumulative  contribution  to  the  eco-compensation  fund  until  2030:  at  least  CNY228.0  million;  and  cumulative \ninvestment  from the  fund until  2030:  CNY153.4  million.  Details  are  in Eco-Compensation  Mechanism  for the  Sayu \nRiver Basin  (accessible  from the list  of linked  documents in Appendix  2). \n\n31 Financial  Management  Assessment  (accessible  from the list  of linked  documents in Appendix  2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nA market analysis  confirms that an adequate  number  of qualified  local suppliers  and contractors \nhave  participated  successfully  in  similar  procurements.  To  achieve  better  value  for  money,  the \nproject will adopt open competitive bidding (nationally advertised) for all ADB-financed  works and \ngoods  packages.  Quality- and  cost-based  selection  (internationally  advertised)  will be used only \nfor  two  large  consulting  services  packages  for  project  management  support  and  for  rural  water \npollution  management  and  eco-compensation.  Procurement  under  the  eco-compensation  fund \nwill be conducted  based on local procurement  procedures  acceptable to ADB.32   \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption  Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained  to and discusse d \n34. \nwith the government and the ZCG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n\nE. \n\nPoverty, Social,  and Gender \n\n35. \nPoverty and social. The project is classified  general intervention for poverty reduction. A \npoverty  and  social  analysis  was  undertaken  based  on  intensive  stakeholder  consultations  and \nsocioeconomic  surveys. A total of 127,015 residents in the project area, including  59,697 women \n(47.0%) and 25,403 low-income  people (20.0%), are expected to benefit directly from the project \nthrough  reduced  solid  waste  and  water  pollution,  improved  river  management,  and  better \necological services. Other residents in Zhaoyang District and Ludian County of Zhaotong will also \nbenefit indirectly from the improved environment.  The project will create 1,834 jobs during project \nimplementation  and 372 jobs during project operation. A social development action plan prepared \nbased  on the  poverty  and  social  analysis  has  specific  targets  for  poor  and  low-income  people. \nConsultations  were  undertaken  with  local  residents  and  other  stakeholders.  A  consultation  and \nparticipation  plan for project implementation  is included in the PAM.  \n\n36. \nGender.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  following  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Gender  Mainstreaming  Categories  of  ADB  Projects.33  Gender  analysis  indicates \nthat women  are  the primary  caretakers  of household  wastewater  and solid  waste  management, \nand initial estimates  suggest  that project investments  will result in an important  reduction in time \n(50%)  spent  on these  tasks  through  improved  systems.  Migration  is a key  livelihood  strategy  in \nthe area, especially  among the young. However,  nonmigrant  women expressed  interested  in job \nopportunities  to be created by the project, which will include skilled and unskilled positions for the \nconstruction  and  operation  of  facilities.  A  gender  action  plan  has  been  prepared  that  will \n(i) measure results toward gender equality, particularly time savings as a result of improved waste \nmanagement  systems  for  women  through  baseline  and  endline  surveys;  (ii)  set  targets  for \nwomen\u2019s participation in decision-making  and in skilled and unskilled employment; (iii) set targets \nto  ensure  women  farmers\u2019  participation  in  training  to  facilitate  their  transition  to  low-emissions \nagriculture;  and  (iv)  set  targets  for  ensuring  the  active  participation  of  women  in  the  EFMC \nresponsible  for screening  and improvement  of activities proposed  to be financed from the fund. \n\nF. \n\nSafeguards \n\n37. \ncategories  are as follows.34 \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n38. \n\nEnvironment  (category  A).  An  environmental  impact  assessment  has  been  prepared \n\n \n\n32 For activities  that will  be financed  from the eco-compensation  fund, small amounts  of equipment  and  materials  will \n\nbe purchased  for the maintenance  of facilities  constructed  under the project. \n\n33 ADB. 2012.  Guidelines  for Gender Mainstreaming  Categories  of ADB Projects. Manila. \n34 ADB. Safeguard  Categories. \n\n\fand  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  This  includes  (i)  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP), \ndraft ESMS, and a project-specific  grievance  redress mechanism.  The EMP will be applied  to all \nproject  components,  except  the  eco-compensation  fund.  For  the  eco-compensation  fund, \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards  will  be  managed  under  the  ESMS.  The  environmental \nimpact  assessment,  the  EMP,  and  the  ESMS  are  based  on  the  domestic  feasibility  study  and \nenvironmental  assessment  reports,  site  visits,  and  consultations  with  stakeholder.  The  ZCG, \nthrough the PMO and the EFMC, will be responsible for compliance with the EMP and the ESMS. \nThe  implementing  agencies  do  not have  experience  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  procedures;  and so, \nthe  project  design  includes  qualified  safeguard  staff  and  a  training  program.  The  project  is \nexpected  to  achieve  significant  environmental  benefits,  including  (i)  improved  water  quality \nthrough  a reduction  of water  pollution  sources  and  protection  of water  resources  from pollution; \n(ii) improved designs and operational procedures for garbage pyrolysis plants (environmental and \nsocial assessments and safe management of pyrolysis by-products); (iii) reduced annual silt loads \nto the Sayu River; and (iv) the promotion of environmental  management  in the Sayu River Basin \nthrough  the ESMS.  Risks include  (i) environmental  and/or health  impacts  via air emissions  from \nthe  garbage  pyrolysis  plants;  (ii)  improper  management  of  leachate,  slag,  and/or  flue  ash  from \nthe  garbage  pyrolysis  plants;  and  (iii)  odors  and  leachate  from  garbage  transfer  stations. \nMitigation  measures  and  screening  procedures  to  address  these  risks  are  included  in the  EMP \nand  the  ESMS,  including  measures  for  the  safe  treatment  and  disposal  of  flue  ash,  slag,  and \nleachate; and the air and soil monitoring  programs  for early detection of environmental  impacts. \n\n39. \nInvoluntary resettlement  (category A). The land use of the project (for Outputs 1 and 2) \nwill include (i) permanent acquisition of 743.38 mu of collective land; (ii) land user right transfer of \n416.49  mu  of  collective  land;  (iii)  land  use  for  ecological  farming  or  forestry  of  25,765.59  mu; \n(iv) land  use  for  rural  public  infrastructure  of  15.40  mu;  (v)  state-owned  land  occupation  of \n1,973.88 mu; and (vi) temporary land occupation  of 4,828.06 mu. The project will not involve any \nhouse  or  structure  demolition.  Permanent  land  acquisition  will  affect  1,257  households  with \n4,386 persons  and  is  mainly  related  to widening  or straightening  of ecological  embankments  in \nsome  river  sections.  Households  will  not  be  physically  relocated.  A  resettlement  plan  was \nprepared,  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  relevant  PRC  laws and  regulations. \nIt includes adequate  measures  for compensation,  resettlement,  and rehabilitation.  It is based on \nsurveys  and  consultations  with  affected  people  and  will  be  updated  through  additional  surveys \nand  consultations  during  project  implementation.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  has  been \nestablished  and  incorporated  into  the  resettlement  plan.  The  ZCG,  LCG,  and  ZDG  have  the \ncapacity  to  implement  domestically  funded  projects;  and  the  consultants  will  strengthen  their \ncapacity to implement the resettlement  plan in compliance  with ADB\u2019s requirements.  An external \nmonitoring  agency  will  be  engaged  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  and \nsubmit semiannual  reports  to ADB. Outputs  3 and 4 are not expected  to involve involuntary  land \nacquisition  or resettlement  impacts.  The  ESMS,  prepared  for  the eco-compensation  fund  under \nOutput  3,  includes  necessary  measures  for  screening  and  avoidance  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  impacts, including  any issues from past land acquisition or existing facilities. \n\n40. \nIndigenous  peoples  or  ethnic  minorities  (category  B).  The  Hui,  Miao,  and  Yi  ethnic \nminority groups in the project area will benefit from the project, including  (i) improved wastewater \nand solid  waste  management;  (ii) pilot  development  of  eco-villages;  (iii)  job opportunities  during \nconstruction  and  operation;  (iv)  livelihood  support  from  the  eco-compensation \nfund;  and \n(v) capacity  development.  A social  assessment  revealed  that  the  socioeconomic  and  livelihood \nsystems  of the  ethnic  minorities  are not  different  from  those of  the Han  majority.  However,  they \nmaintain distinct cultural characteristics, such as traditional festivals and different religious beliefs. \nProject  activities,  such  as  pilot  eco-village  development  in  the  ethnic  minority  villages,  will \nconsider  such  cultural  characteristics.  An  ethnic  minority  development  plan  was  prepared, \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nfollowing  ADB\u2019s Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and relevant  PRC laws and regulations.  It includes \nactions related to awareness raising, consultations, and the participation of ethnic minority groups; \nmonitoring  and  evaluation;  and  strengthening  the  capacities  of  the  ZCG,  LCG,  and  ZDG  to \nimplement  and monitor  the ethnic  minority  development  plan.  The ESMS includes  measures  for \nscreening  and avoiding  adverse impacts on ethnic minorities. \n\n41. \nCapacity  for  social  and  safeguard  measures.  The  ZCG,  LCG,  and  ZDG  have \nexperience  in  implementing  domestic  projects;  but  they  do  not  have  experience  with  the  ADB \nprojects.  To implement  the  social  and  safeguard  measures  following  ADB  requirements,  (i) the \nZCG, LCG, and ZDG will each appoint focal social and safeguard staff; (ii) consultants  for project \nmanagement  support  will  include  environment,  resettlement,  social  development,  and  gender \nspecialists; (iii) staff of the ZCG, LCG, and ZDG will be trained on social and safeguard measures; \nand (iv) external monitoring  agencies  will be recruited for safeguard  monitoring. \n\nG. \n\nSummary  of Risk Assessment  and Risk Management  Plan \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\n42. \ndetail in the risk assessment  and risk management  plan.35 \n\nTable 4: Summary  of Risks and Mitigating  Measures \n\nRisks \nPopulation  of the Sayu River Basin  exceeds \nforecasts and exerts heavier  pollution  load on the \nSayu River. \nChanges  in administrative  procedure or budgetary \nprocess  delay the provision  of counterpart  funds. \na  Counterpart  fund provision  could still  be delayed (e.g.,  by a rapid  rise in prices). \nSource: Asian  Development Bank. \n\nAdditional  water pollution  management,  such as increased \ncapacity of the existing  wastewater  treatment plant  (the plant \nhas adequate  land  for additional  capacity) \nAn assurance  is included  in the project agreement  to ensure \ntimely provision  of counterpart  funds.a  \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe government and the ZCG have assured ADB that implementation  of the project shall \n43. \nconform to all applicable ADB requirements,  including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards,  gender, procurement,  consulting services, financial management,  and disbursement \nas described  in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n\nThe government and the ZCG have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\n44. \nwhich are set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n45. \nI am satisfied  that the proposed  loan  would comply  with the Articles  of Agreement  of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$100,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Yunnan  Sayu  River  Basin  Rural  Water \nPollution  Management  and  Eco-Compensation  Demonstration  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital  resources,  in  regular  terms,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility; for  a term  of 25 years, including  a \ngrace period  of 6 years; and such  other terms and conditions  as are substantially  in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements  presented  to the Board. \n\nMasatsugu  Asakawa \nPresident \n\n35 Risk Assessment  and Risk Management Plan  (accessible  from the list of linked documents  in Appendix 2). \n\n4 September  2020  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix  1 \n\n13 \n\nRisks \n\n \nPopulation \nexerts heavier \npollution  load \nthan forecast. \n\n \nChanges  in \nadministrative \nprocedure  or \nbudgetary \nprocess  delay \nthe provision \nof counterpart \nfunds. \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nQuality of life and sustainable  aquatic  ecosystem in the Yangtze  River Basin improved (Yangtze  River Economic Belt \nDevelopment  Plan, 2016\u20132030)a \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nCondition  of \nwater resources \nand \nenvironment  in \nthe Sayu River \nBasin  improved \n\nOutputs \n1.
