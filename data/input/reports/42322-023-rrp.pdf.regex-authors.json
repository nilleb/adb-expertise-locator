I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Mongolia for the additional financing of the Food and Nutrition Social Welfare Project. The \nreport  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Supporting  Social  Protection \nReforms, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the original program ($9 million Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  [ADF]  grant)  and  project  ($3  million  ADF  grant)  in  2008,  which  were \ndesigned in the context of the 2008 food crisis to improve access to food by vulnerable and poor \nhouseholds.2 The original program, which included the design and implementation of a food \nstamp  program  as  part  of  the  social  welfare  system,  has  exceeded  its  target  number  of \nbeneficiaries.3 The original project improved targeting, provided capacity building, and prepared \nstrategies to reform social welfare in Mongolia. ADB\u2019s contribution to the reform of social welfare \nhas been significant at both policy and operational levels.4 Progress made in reforming social \nwelfare since 2009 includes (i) the introduction of proxy means testing to target the poor, \n(ii) cancellation of several universal benefits, (iii) the introduction of the food stamp program as \nthe first poverty-targeted benefit in Mongolia, and (iv) passage of an amended Social Welfare \nLaw in January 2012 that legalized the reforms. \n \n3.  The  government  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  consideration  of  additional  financing  to  the \nongoing  project  to  continue  reforming  social  welfare  and  to  strengthen  social  insurance \nservices. It will scale up the original project by pursuing the reforms initiated in social welfare. \nSocial welfare benefits will be further consolidated to reduce the complexity of the system and \nincrease its effectiveness. The additional financing will also support an expansion in the scope \nof the original project by improving the delivery of social insurance services and modernizing the \nsocial protection sector to adapt to a fast-growing economy.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n4.  In Mongolia, high economic growth coexists with large numbers of vulnerable and poor \npopulations\u2014requiring a continuous focus on social welfare.5 Mongolia\u2019s promising economic \noutlook  and  the  prospect  of  increased  labor  participation  in  the  formal  sector  justify  the \nincreasing focus on social insurance. In July 2012, the newly elected government issued the \nGovernment Action Plan, 2012\u20132016, which aimed at introducing new and transparent financial \n                                                \n1  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Asian Development \nFund Grants to Mongolia for the Food and Nutrition Social Welfare Program and Project. Manila. The program was \ncompleted in December 2012. \n3  The food stamp program has reached 124,371 beneficiaries (65,972 females and 58,399 males), surpassing the \nproject outcome target of 100,000 beneficiaries. \n4  ADB  has  been  at  the  forefront  of  social  welfare  reforms  with  the  following:  ADB.  2001.

Manila. \n5  The National Statistical Office released its latest poverty statistics: the 2012 national poverty rate was 27.4%, down \nfrom 33.7% in 2011. National Statistical Office. 2012. National Socio-Economic Household Survey. Ulaanbaatar. ", "2 \nservices and advanced information technology (IT) tools in the social welfare and insurance \nsector. The government\u2019s intention is to address user dissatisfaction with insurance and social \nwelfare services. The Ministry of Population Development and Social Protection (MPDSP) has \ntwo  main  attached  agencies\u2014the  Social  Insurance  General  Office  (SIGO)  in  charge  of \nmanaging five social insurance funds,6 and the General Office for Social Welfare Services \n(GOSWS) in charge of social welfare benefit management. SIGO and the GOSWS are fairly \ndecentralized, with their 30 branch offices in all 21 aimags (provinces) and nine districts of \nUlaanbaatar, and services offered in all 352 soums (administrative subdivisions of the aimag) of \nMongolia.  \n \n5.  Social  welfare. Social welfare has undergone major reforms  since 2001 with ADB \nsupport, but key issues such as fiscal sustainability and the impact of welfare benefits still need \nto be addressed through consolidation of social welfare benefits. Social welfare includes an \nexcessive number of benefits (more than 60), which lack proper targeting and are overlapping. \nThe absence of an effective, centrally operated management information system in the GOSWS \nleads to duplication of benefits, limited analysis, and other inefficiencies. Further progress in \nsocial welfare reforms requires better availability of data and information for more efficient and \neffective delivery of social welfare services. A major lesson is the need for sustained support, as \nreforming a sensitive sector such as social welfare requires long-term efforts and commitment. \n \n6.  Social insurance. The population coverage of each of the five social insurance funds \nmanaged by SIGO varies. All funds are subsidized by the government, and the pension and \nhealth insurance funds are contributory funds.7 The pension fund covered about 301,940 people \nat the end of 2011. The MPDSP has initiated reform to shift from a single-layer contributory \nsystem to a multilayer pension system encouraging private sector involvement. The health \ninsurance system, covering up to 98% of the population, albeit with low financial protection, is \nundergoing  reforms.  These  include  better  governance,  more  managerial  autonomy,  and \nincreased health services purchasing capacity.8 With recent changes in the economy and the \nchanging  living  conditions  of  Mongolians,  the  social  security  sector  strategy  needs  to  be \nassessed and updated to develop a consensus on the way forward to 2020. The social security \nsector strategy was last updated in 2003.9  \n    \n7.  Information technology systems. The IT systems of SIGO and the GOSWS suffer \nfrom lack of automated procedures for reporting, poor connectivity to automate social services \nat  the  soum  and  aimag  levels,  and  a  multitude  of  databases,  which  complicate  data \nmanagement, analysis, and reporting. SIGO is using an outdated software system that cannot \nsupport  international  accounting  standards  requirements  for  the  public  sector.  The  current \napproach to strictly separate IT systems for the GOSWS and SIGO is inefficient. The lack of \ninformation  flow  and  availability  constrains  efficient  functioning  of  the  social  welfare  and \ninsurance  system.  Reporting  and  data  analytics  (business  intelligence)  lack  automated \nprocesses in SIGO, the GOSWS, and at the MPDSP level\u2014creating considerable difficulty in \nanalyzing the performance data of social welfare and insurance, and in preparing projections for \n                                                \n6  The five funds are the (i) pension fund; (ii) unemployment fund; (iii) health insurance fund; (iv) benefits fund \n(sickness, maternal, and funeral grants); and (v) industrial accidents, occupational diseases insurance fund. \n7  Shared contributions of employers and employees (2% for health insurance and 7% for pension contributions each \nfrom employers and employees). \n8  ADB  is  preparing  capacity  development  TA  (effectiveness  expected  in  November  2013)  to  support  the \nimplementation of the revised citizens\u2019 health insurance law to be passed by the Parliament within 2013. ADB. \n2013. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Strengthening the Health Insurance System. Manila. \n9  Social security is to be understood as synonymous with social protection, and includes social welfare and social \ninsurance. \n ", "3 \npolicy analysis and development. Further, data security, disaster prevention measures, and the \nuse of licensed software are lacking. The World Bank is supporting efforts to upgrade selected \naspects of the social welfare IT system. IT processes for both the GOSWS and SIGO need to \nbecome  transparent,  with  web-based  interfaces,  and  stakeholder-centric.  Beneficiaries  and \nother  stakeholders  request  access  to  information  to  inquire  about  the  status  of  benefits \nprocessing, capacity to retrieve information, clear grievance and complaints mechanisms, and \nsimplified procedures. \n \n8.  Both  SIGO  and  the  GOSWS  seem  adequately  staffed,  but  the  human  resources \ncapacity  will  need  to  be  strengthened  given  the  planned  IT  improvements.  Additional  IT \nhardware (computer, server, digital storage) will need to be acquired at central level, aimag, \ndistrict, and soum level. This needs to be supported by proper IT budget allocation to implement \neffective maintenance, depreciation, and replacement policies.10 About 50% of the soums are \nconnected through an internet network. The government is working with private parties to \nextend network connectivity to remote soums. Bandwidth, which seems sufficient for SIGO at \npresent, will need to be reassessed in light of the planned requirements of the IT system in the \nfuture.  \n \n9.  The current project was assessed on the following indicators and is considered to be \nperforming well.11 \n(i)  Implementation results against expected project outputs. All outputs under \ncomponent 1 (design and implementation of a targeted food stamp program) \nhave  been  achieved.  Nationwide  coverage  of  the  proxy  means  testing \nimplementation was achieved in July 2012 (1.1). The food stamp program is \ninstitutionalized and functioning (1.2).12 Outputs under component 2 (capacity \ndevelopment and communication strategy for the food stamp program) were \nachieved. Capacity development tools for national and local stakeholders were \nimplemented (2.1). A communication strategy was adopted and implemented \nnationwide  (2.2).  Outputs  under  component  3  are  nearly  achieved.  A \nmethodology to measure the impact of food price increases was developed and \ndisseminated (3.1). Policy notes, a knowledge product, and recommendations to \nthe  government  have  been  prepared  (3.2).  Recommendations  on  the  early \nwarning and response system to respond to social shocks were prepared and \nare awaiting the government\u2019s decision to set up the system (3.3).  \n(ii)  Implementation progress. Implementation progress is satisfactory. The current \nproject had achieved 98% of cumulative physical progress against 97% elapsed \ntime by 8 November 2013. Cumulative contract awards and disbursement are \nconsistent with projections. \n(iii)  Safeguard compliance. Safeguard classifications for environment, resettlement, \nand indigenous peoples were C. All requirements have been met. The gender \naction plan has been implemented satisfactorily. Progress on the gender action \n                                                \n10 SIGO has a policy to replace hardware every 5 years but most GOSWS hardware is 5\u20136 years old without a clear \nreplacement policy. \n11 ADB. 2011. Additional Financing. Operations Manual. OM H5/OP. Manila (para. 3). \n12 The initial results of the impact evaluation of the food stamp program show a significant increase in dietary diversity \nand a decrease in the number of months without adequate food supply, a significant reduction in negative coping \nstrategies (e.g., debt), a decrease in self-reported poverty, and food insecurity (ADB. 2011. Impact Evaluation \nStudy: Medicard and Food Stamp Programs in Mongolia. Manila). At the same time, the results show no significant \nimpact on household consumption (monetary)  or caloric increase. In total, 450,000 households (1.7 million \nindividuals) were covered by the proxy means test survey. The National Socio-Economic Household Surveys for \n2010\u20132012 show that 85% of food stamp eligible are poor\u2014performance in line with international benchmarking. \nThe remaining 15% (eligible non-poor) are the result of inaccuracies of the targeting methodology. \n ", "4 \nplan was reviewed, and minimal changes made to two indicators to reflect actual \nimplementation and monitoring. The proxy means testing database, food stamp \ndistribution,  grievances,  and  monitoring  are  fully  sex-disaggregated  in \naccordance with the gender action plan. \n(iv)  Management  of  risks.  Risks  were  managed  successfully.  The  report  and \nrecommendation of the President for the original project identified (a) food safety \nnets  used  as  a  political  tool, (b) resistance to  change  in  the  existing  social \nwelfare system, (c) the decision to expand or prolong the food stamp program \nbased on recommendations from the pilot approach, (d) lack of coordination \namong  ministries  and  levels  of  government,  and  (e)  the  risks  that  the \nrecommendations on the results from pilot testing will not be turned into policy \nreforms. Mitigation measures were implemented and no further risk has surfaced.  \n(v)  Project performance rating. The current project is rated on track in the project \nperformance rating. \n \n10.  The additional financing is considered to meet the four eligibility criteria for additional \nfinancing.13 First,  ADB  reviewed  the  original  project  in  October  2012.  It  confirmed  the \nsatisfactory  performance  of  the  original  project,  and  no  changes  in  approaches  or \nmethodologies were envisioned.14 Accordingly, the original project remains technically feasible, \neconomically viable, and financially sound. Second, the government accords high priority to the \noriginal  project  as  proposed  to  be  expanded  through  the  additional  financing.  Additional \nfinancing will be crucial in meeting a key reform in the Government Action Plan, 2012\u20132016 to \ndeliver social protection services to citizens efficiently and without bureaucratic difficulties, as \nacknowledged by the government\u2019s request for additional financing. Third, the revised project \noutcome will continue improving social welfare services started under the original project and \nextend to social insurance services, while the output related to preparing a package of reforms \nof social welfare will be expanded to cover social insurance. These changes are consistent with \nthe revised project\u2019s development objectives. Fourth, the expanded project and its outcome are \nconsistent  with  the  inclusive  social  development  pillar  of  the  current  country  partnership \nstrategy, 2012\u20132016 as well as with the ongoing reform efforts of the government.15  \n \n11.  The additional financing meets the three criteria for priority consideration: (i) the project \nis performing well (para. 9); (ii) there is a high degree of project readiness to implement the \nadditional financing; and (iii) developing social welfare and insurance services that are effective, \nefficient, transparent, and user-centered is highly innovative in the context of Mongolia and \ncould have a demonstration effect for other sectors.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact and outcome will be revised. The impact of the overall project (including the \nadditional financing) will be improved social equity, less poverty, better social risks mitigation \nand prevention, and improved food security. The outcome will be more efficient and transparent \ndelivery  of  social  welfare  and  insurance  services  (including  support  to  food  consumption), \nthrough strengthened policy, systems, and IT. The outputs will be retained, except for output 3.2 \nof the original project, which will be expanded to include IT improvements and social protection. \n \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2011.

The outputs will be regrouped under the three components of the original program \n(component 1) and project (components 2 and 3):  \n(i)  Component  1:  Design  and  implementation  of  a  targeted  food  stamp \nprogram. The two original outputs\u2014innovative targeting approaches for food \nstamps pilot tested by December 2009 (1.1) and a mechanism for delivering food \nstamps established by June 2009 (1.2)\u2014have been achieved. \n(ii)  Component 2: Capacity development and communication strategy for the \nfood stamp program. The two original outputs\u2014capacity development tools for \nnational  and  local  stakeholders  and  institutional  strengthening  designed  and \nimplemented by January 2010 (2.1) and a communication strategy to ensure \ntransparent  implementation  of  the  food  stamp  program  developed  and \nimplemented by December 2009 (2.2)\u2014have been achieved as well. \n(iii)  Component 3: Strengthening social welfare strategies and systems. The \nfirst original output under this component\u2014effective food crisis response by 2010 \n(3.1)\u2014has  been  achieved.  The  third  original  output\u2014an  early  warning  and \nresponse system to respond to social shocks by October 2011 (3.3)\u2014is partially \nachieved as the system is not in place yet. The second original output of the \nproject\u2014a package of reform of social welfare strategies by October 2011 (3.2), \nwhich  is  partially  achieved\u2014will  be  replaced  by  two  new  outputs  under  the \nadditional  financing  to  continue  reforming  social  welfare  and  improve  social \ninsurance.  \n(iv)  Output  3.2  (new):  Information  technology  processes  and  systems \nupgraded. Activities will include (a) improving IT systems to support international \naccounting standards for SIGO; (b) automating periodic reporting and reducing \nmanual  processing;  (c)  enhancing  the  transparency  of  SIGO  and  GOSWS \noperations  to  ensure  friendly  and  web-based  access  of  social  welfare  and \ninsurance data based on a secure and electronic access policy; (d) establishing \nthe data analytics and a business intelligence system; (e) setting up information \nsecurity  and  disaster recovery  infrastructure;  (f)  building capacity for staff of \nSIGO,  the  GOSWS,  and  the  MPDSP  at  all  levels;  and  (g)  upgrading  IT \nequipment at central, aimag, district, and soum level. \n(v)  Output  3.3  (new):  Social  welfare  reformed  and  social  protection \nstrengthened. Activities will include (a) rationalizing the social welfare system \n(consolidate benefits, improve the targeting of social welfare benefits, balance \ncash transfer and services, and link social welfare beneficiaries to employment \nservices); (b) updating the social protection strategy; (c) building capacity for staff \nof SIGO, the GOSWS, and the MPDSP at all levels; (d) updating the database of \npoor  households  identified  through  proxy  means  testing  and  running  the \ngrievance and redress mechanism; (e) improving the investment opportunities of \nthe social insurance funds; and (f) making recommendations on gender equality \nin social protection, and on better linking social protection with labor market \npolicies, including gender, and child and youth protection issues. \n \nD.

Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.17 Most implementation arrangements of the original project \nwill be retained for the overall project. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period   June 2014\u2013May 2017 \nLoan closing date  30 November 2017 \nEstimated completion date  31 May 2017 \nManagement   \n(i) Oversight body  The project steering committee of the overall project will oversee the implementation of \nthe project and give strategic direction. It will be chaired by the state secretary of the \nMPDSP and include representatives of the Ministry of Economic Development; Ministry \nof Finance; SIGO; GOSWS; National Statistical Office; IT, Post and Telecommunication \nAuthority;  Mongolian  Employers\u2019  Federation;  Mongolian  Trade  Unions  Federation; \nAssociation of Elderly; social workers; and a nongovernment organization working for \nthe vulnerable and the poor.

The implementing agency \nchairs the steering committee and is responsible for procurement under the original project. In 2009, the choice of \nthe MOF as the executing agency was required as the original program and project were part of a wider \ngovernment plan led by the MOF to address the food and fuel crisis. The additional financing focuses primarily on \ntechnical matters and is no longer designed in a crisis context. Therefore, it is relevant to designate the MPDSP as \nthe executing agency of the overall project. The Ministry of Economic Development concurred with the change of \nexecuting agency.  \nb  The MPDSP has advised that the procurement will be conducted by the Government Procurement Agency (GPA). \nSuch arrangements and the respective role of the GPA and the  MPDSP  will be confirmed during project \nimplementation subject to ADB\u2019s assessment of the GPA capacity and resources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n                                                \n17 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n17.  ADB will provide capacity development TA for Supporting Social Protection Reforms. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $0.5 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The TA will finance consulting services, capacity \nbuilding for the MPDSP, and contingencies.18 The MPDSP will be the executing agency for the \nadditional financing and the TA.19  The TA will be implemented from 30 June 2014 to 30 May \n2017.20  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n18.  Technology solutions will be introduced under the IT component to ensure the efficiency \nand transparency of social welfare and insurance services. Web-based IT will be designed and \nimplemented to ensure access to data from all levels, automated reporting systems, strict user \naccess control, an integrated security framework, business intelligence software, infrastructure \nfor backup and disaster recovery, an IT system catalog, and a centralized help desk for all IT-\nrelated issues. Capacity building will be provided. A link to the intersectoral poverty database \nwill  allow  improved  targeting  of  welfare  programs  of  different  ministries  and  government \nagencies. \n  \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n19.  The economic analysis evaluated the economic viability of the project as a whole. The \nanalysis  covers  the  macroeconomic  context  to  review  the  potential  for  the  government  to \ncontinue to finance the project activities in the longer term following project completion. The \nquantifiable economic costs and benefits for the upgraded IT processes and systems have been \nevaluated.  Benefits  will  lead  to  productivity  gain,  cost  savings  for  the  beneficiaries,  and \nimproved allocation of human resources at the agencies level. The evaluation of the economic \nbenefit  of  reformed  social  welfare  and  strengthened  social  protection cannot  be quantified \nmonetarily  at  this  stage;  an  evaluation  will  be  possible  once  the  efficiency  of  the  current \ntargeting  is  analyzed  and  new  measures  are  defined  during  the  envisaged  project.  Using \nconservative  estimates  of  project  implementation,  the  baseline  results  show  an  economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) of 14.85% without taking into account unquantifiable economic \nbenefits for the reformed social welfare and strengthened social protection output. The EIRR \nwas tested through sensitivity analysis using a 20% decrease in economic benefits as the worst-\ncase scenario for all economic benefits. Under these assumptions, the EIRR is 11.16%. The \nproject is considered economically viable. \n \n20.  The project has no revenue-earning component, so a financial cost\u2013benefit analysis was \nnot necessary. The financial sustainability of the project was assessed at the fiscal and project \nlevel. An analysis of recent and projected government expenditures was undertaken to evaluate \n                                                \n18 Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). Consultants will be recruited under ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \n19 The government will provide in-kind counterpart support in the form of office accommodation, remuneration and per \ndiem of counterpart staff, and administrative support. The project implementation unit will provide day-to-day \nadministrative support to the MPDSP. A capacity assessment confirmed MPDSP\u2018s capacity to handle financial \nmatters and recruitment of consultants. \n20 Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nthe potential impact of the project on the budget of the MPDSP. The MPDSP, GOSWS, and \nSIGO will contribute counterpart funding and cover the project\u2019s operation and maintenance \n(O&M) costs. The government\u2019s annual share of project costs will average $1.00 million, or less \nthan 0.10% of the population development and social protection sector annual budget in 2012. \nThe recurrent costs of the project are estimated to be about $0.67 million per annum and \ninclude O&M of IT systems. The annual O&M cost to be borne by the MPDSP will not exceed \n0.005% of its current expenditure. The counterpart funding and O&M costs are considered both \nfinancially  sustainable and  affordable.  Considering  an  average  depreciation  value  of  $2.00 \nmillion per annum for the project investment, the recurrent cost impact will be $2.67 million per \nannum,  which  represents  less than  0.01%  of the  total  recurrent  cost  of  2012.  A financial \nmanagement assessment concluded that the MPDSP is experienced in managing ADB projects \nand is prepared for project implementation. The financial management analysis identified issues \nthat will be addressed through the maintenance of project accounts by a project implementation \nunit and through external audits for the project duration. The government has committed to \nprovide the necessary funds to ensure that the investment benefits are not lost.  \n  \nC.  Governance \n \n21.  The MPDSP is a long-term partner of ADB since 2001. IT improvements and better \nsocial funds management will substantially improve the transparency of financial transactions. A \nprocurement capacity assessment conducted for the MPDSP, GOSWS, and SIGO confirmed \ntheir general ability to conduct procurement in compliance with ADB policy and relevant national \nlaws and regulations on public procurement. Financial management assessments conducted for \nthe  MPDSP,  GOSWS,  and  SIGO  noted  that  all  the  agencies  have  staff  with  adequate \naccounting skills; computerized financial accounting and reporting systems; and accounting, \nfinancial, and project monitoring procedures. A project implementation unit will support the \nMPDSP in project financial matters, procurement, and recruitment of consultants. The Ministry \nof Finance will arrange annual external audits for the project. The MPDSP, GOSWS, and SIGO \nare subject to annual auditing conducted by independent auditors.  \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the MPDSP. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 17). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social  \n \n23.  The poor and socially excluded will particularly benefit from the project through improved \nsystems, better targeting, and increased analytical capabilities and capacity of the MPDSP to \nbetter design benefit coverage and plan for the future. Members of the social insurance systems \nwill benefit from more effective and transparent services. The additional financing project is \nclassified under effective gender mainstreaming. Mongolia has a wide range of social protection \nbenefits with social welfare entitlements designed specifically to address strengthening the role \nof women in society. To date, gender analysis of social protection policies or programs has not \nbeen carried out. The additional financing will build on gender aspects developed under the \noriginal project by updating the social protection strategy to ensure that the gender implications \nof social protection policies are identified and policy reforms built into the strategy. The gender \naction plan was reviewed and updated in light of the additional financing. \n \n ", "10 \nE.  Safeguards \n \n24.  The  current  project  and  additional  financing  will  not  cause  any  environment, \nresettlement,  or  indigenous  peoples\u2019  impact.  Therefore,  the  overall  project  and  additional \nfinancing remain category C for environment, resettlement, and indigenous peoples. No further \nactions are required. The assessment of potential environmental implications of the original \nproject is accessible from the list of linked documents to the original report and recommendation \nof the President (footnote 2). \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n25.  The overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks involved. \nThe main risks are (i) resistance by the public and decision makers to rationalize the social \nwelfare  system,  which  will  be  mitigated  through  participative  processes  and  effective \ncommunication; (ii) SIGO and the GOSWS oppose reorganization of the IT department for \nincreased efficiency, which will be mitigated by technical and policy dialogue with the MPDSP \nand the two agencies; and (iii) the government provides insufficient resources for the O&M of \nthe upgraded IT systems, which will be addressed by a covenant in the loan agreement on the \nprovision  of  sufficient  counterpart  funding  to  cover  maintenance  costs.  Major  risks  and \nmitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n26.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  gender, \nprocurement, consulting services, disbursements, and safeguards as described in detail in the \nproject administration manual and loan documents. The  government and the MPDSP  have \nagreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  loan \nagreement.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n27.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR12,960,000 to Mongolia for the additional financing of the Food \nand Nutrition Social Welfare Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest \ncharge at the rate of 2.0% per annum during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n18 November 2013 \n                                                \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \n \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nData Sources and  Assumptions and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  (Overall Project)  (Overall Project) \nImpact       \nCurrent project   Current project    Assumptions \nVulnerability to food  Daily calorie intake of lowest  National nutrition surveys \u2013  International food \ninsecurity reduced  quintiles of income distribution  NSO  prices will stabilize and \nthrough increased  increased from 1,728 in 2004 to    food can continue to \nsupply of and  at least 2,000 calories by 2015;
