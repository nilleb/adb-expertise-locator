This  will  (i)  reduce  fuel \nconsumption  and  enhance  energy  efficiency;  (ii)  reduce  pollution;  (iii)  enhance  railway  safety; \n(iv) increase line capacity, benefitting consumers and producers of goods and services through \nthe provision of timely and efficient transport services and lower logistics costs; and (v) improve \nstaff productivity.2\n  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe growth rate of the Indian economy has been close to 8% in the last 6 years; while \nthis  is  expected  to  continue  for  several  years.  India\u2019s  transport  infrastructure  needs  further \ninvestment  to  meet  the  country\u2019s  growth  demand.  The  Government  of  India\u2019s  Eleventh  Five \nYear Plan (FY2007/08\u2013FY2011/12) highlights the need for an efficient transportation system to \neffectively  increase  productivity  and  competitiveness  in  the  world  market.  The  development  of \nvarious  transport  modes  needs  to  be  integrated  to  build  an  efficient,  sustainable,  safe,  and \nregionally  balanced  transportation  system.  Railways  make  up  a  significant  part  of  India\u2019s \ntransport sector\u2014in FY2009/10, railways carried 7.5 billion passengers and 888 million tons (t) \nof freight. The railways\u2019 share, particularly of freight transport, has gone down steadily over the \npast few decades (from 89% in FY1950/51 to 30% in FY2007/08). \n \n4. \nOne of the most widespread constraints facing railway operations is the capacity of high-\ndensity  railway  routes.  The  railway  trunk  routes  comprise  just  16%  of  the  network  but  carry \nmore  than  50%  of  the  traffic.  The  speed  of  freight  trains  on  Indian  Railways  has  stagnated  at \naround  25  kilometers  (km)  per  hour.  Passenger  services  are  also  slow.  Accidents  per  million \ntrain-km  have  been  steadily  reduced,  from  5.5  per  million  train-km  in  FY1960/61  to  0.2  in \nFY2008/09. The operating ratio  improved from 91.0% in FY2004/05 to 75.9% in FY2007/08, but \nwas    90.5%  in  FY2008/09.  Critical  efficiency  parameters  have  improved,  such  as  the  net t-km \nper  wagon  day  (from  2,574  in  FY2003/04  to  3,539  in  FY2007/08)  and  the  net  t-km  and \npassenger-km per employee (from 0.69 in FY2004/05 to 1.01 in FY2008/09). However, there is \nroom for further improvement. \n \n5. \n estimates  that  an  investment  of  around  Rs14,000 \nbillion (about $310 billion) is needed for FY2010/11\u2013FY2020/21. Indian Railways would be able \nto  generate  about  64%  of  the  investment  required  for  FY2010/11\u2013FY2020/21  through  internal \ngeneration and extra budgetary resources, including public\u2013private partnerships. The remaining \n36% would need to be provided through gross budgetary support from the central government. \n\nThe  Indian  Railways  Vision  2020 3\n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory assistance. ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to \n\nIndia for Preparing the Railway Sector Investment Program. Manila. \n\n3   Ministry of Railways, Government of India. 2009. Indian Railways Vision 2020. New Delhi. \n\n\fIndian  Railways  needs  to  generate  more  funds  through  its  operations  to  finance  the  needed \nexpansion.  Together  with  capital  investment  to  augment  the  railway  network  capacity, \naccounting  reform  can  facilitate  greater  commercialization  of  railway  operations,  thereby \nincreasing revenue generation. The Indian Railways Vision 2020 highlights that critical elements \nof the plan include (i) removal of infrastructural bottlenecks, (ii) creation of adequate capacity, (iii) \ndesign  and  delivery  of  highly  efficient  market-driven  services,  (iv)  safety  and  reliability  of \noperations, and (v) building institutional and organizational capacity.  \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-financed  Railway  Sector  Improvement  Project 4 \n6. \nformulated a detailed reform program and provided support for implementation of the key reform \nmeasures, especially accounting reform; this is most critical for better financial governance and \nmanagement,  and  will  lead  to  overall  efficiency  enhancement  of  Indian  Railways.  It  was  also \nrecognized by all parties that accounting reform that makes the costs and revenues of railway \nservices  and  operations  transparent  is  a  prerequisite  for  successful  implementation  of \nsubsequent  reforms.  As  assessed  in  the  ADB  sector  assistance  program  evaluation  (SAPE),5 \nprogress on implementation of reforms has been mixed. Indian Railways implemented some of \nthe  envisaged  reforms.6\n Private  sector  participation  was  substantially  increased,  especially  in \nthe  operation  of  container  trains  and  terminals.  Separating  core  and  noncore  businesses  was \nstarted by creating subsidiaries to run several noncore businesses as separate business activity \ncenters.  Computerization  was  undertaken  on  a  massive  scale  to  provide  better  services,  and \nincrease  the  commercial  orientation  of  Indian  Railways.  Other  envisaged  reforms,  such  as \nmaking  concession  of  loss-making  branch  lines,  are  by  themselves  not  realistic  while  some \nefforts were made. The accounting reform has been slow, but steady progress has been made, \nand continued ADB support is needed. Substantial progress has been made in putting in place \nthe  prerequisites  for  implementation  of  the  new  accounting  systems\u2014such  as  standardized \ncomputerization\u2014with  completion  targeted  for  2012.  As  recommended  by  the  SAPE,  new \nsupport is essential to continue implementation of the accounting reforms. \n \nThe  Railway  Sector  Improvement  Project  reform  program  was  overly  ambitious,  and \n7. \nsought  to  implement  several  major  reforms  in  a  relatively  short  timeframe  and  in  a  large, \ncomplex  organization.  A  focused  approach  on  the  accounting  system  is  considered  more \nappropriate and effective, as this is the core of all reform measures to enhance Indian Railways\u2019 \noverall  operational  efficiency.  However,  the  reform  process  did  allow  for  wider  dialogue  within \nIndian Railways, as well as wider government circles, on the need for reform. The importance of \naccounting reform has been accepted and incorporated in Indian Railways\u2019 own reform program \n(Indian Railways Vision 2020) and in the government\u2019s Eleventh Plan (FY2007/08\u2013FY2011/12).  \nAccounting reform implementation is now being monitored by the Planning Commission, which \nhas facilitated a continuing dialogue on the sector development between ADB and the Ministry \nof  Railways  (MOR).  The  detailed  institutional  strengthening  action  plan  was  agreed  with  MOR \nas set out in the framework financing agreement (FFA).7\n \n \n8. \nWhile  investments  under  the  investment  program  are  a  small  subset  of  the  total \ninvestment  required  under  Indian  Railways  Vision  2020,  they  underline  the  very  nature  of \nprojects  that  the  vision  proposes  to  address:  capacity  enhancement,  connectivity,  and \nenvironmental sustainability. Investment in physical infrastructure under the investment program \n\n                                                \n4  ADB. 2002.

Two  of  the  projects  are  in  the  eastern  states  of  Chhattisgarh  and  Orissa,  while  the \nothers  are  mainly  in  the  states  of  Maharashtra  and  Karnataka.  Some  of  these  are  located  in \nremote  areas  of the  country  that  are rich  in minerals  and related  industries. These  routes  and \nelectrification (i) are also along the Indian Railways\u2019 high density corridors, such as the \u201cGolden \nQuadrilateral\u201d  that  connects  Chennai,  Kolkata,  Mumbai,  and  New  Delhi;  and  (ii)  connect  ports \nand  provide  hinterland  access.  Finally,  the  lines  carry  heavy  traffic  such  as  ore,  coal,  and \ncement,  which  are  best  carried  by  rail.  The  modal  shift  of  bulk  goods  from  road  to  rail  would \nreduce carbon emissions, and would possibly be eligible for carbon credits. \n \nTransport infrastructure development is high priority for the government, making ADB\u2019s \n9. \nstrategy  of  reducing  poverty  through  infrastructure-led  growth  especially  relevant.  ADB\u2019s \ncontinued  support  for  the  railways  will  help  from  an  environmental  perspective,  and  is  in  line \nwith  the  country  partnership  strategy  (2009\u20132012)  for  India,8\n in  terms  of  supporting  inclusive \nand  environmentally  sustainable  growth.  The  investment  program  has  been  designed  in \ncoordination with development partners to ensure wide geographic coverage and avoid overlaps, \nand  continues  ADB support for  institutional  strengthening  of  MOR,  with  a focus  on  accounting \nreform in parallel with capacity augmentation of existing railway lines. Lessons from the ongoing \nproject were incorporated, and SAPE recommendations taken into account, e.g., enhancing the \nbid  document  to  address  more  than  500  cost  items,  and  engaging  a  general  consultant  to \nstrengthen  project  implementation  programming  capacity.  Project  readiness  is  substantially \nadvanced, e.g., the bid documents have been approved for issuance in 2011. \n  \n10. \nThe  FFA  provides  details  of  the  roadmap,  strategic  context,  policy  framework,  and \ninvestment  program.  The  MFF  is  the  modality  best  suited  for  the  proposed  large-scale \ninvestment  program.  It  provides  for  ADB  to  enter  into  a  sustained  partnership  with  the \ngovernment  for  a  long-term  investment,  with  larger  and  multiple  contracts  in  parallel  with \ncontinued  support  for  railway  efficiency  improvement.  All  projects  to  be  financed  under  the \ninvestment  program  have  already  been  appraised. The  use  of  an  MFF  allows  the government \nand ADB to focus on institutional strengthening and project implementation, and to provide an \noptimal  amount  of  timely  financing  by  arranging  contract  packages  in  specialized  components \nand/or a larger size, which stimulates more competition and increased participation by qualified \ncontractors.  It  also  opens  the  possibility  of  exploring  cofinancing  opportunities  in  subsequent \ntranches, with the government financing a larger portion, as financing products for projects that \nreduce  carbon  emission  are  emerging  (e.g.,  Global  Action  for  Reconciling  Economic  Growth \nand Environmental Preservation by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation). \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe investment program will improve the transport network and promote greater mobility \nthat supports sustainable socioeconomic development in the country by developing an energy-\nefficient, safe, reliable, affordable, and environment-friendly railway system along corridors with \nheavy bulk freight traffic. \n \nC. \n \n12. \nRailway  improvement  component.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5 \nyears,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan and project agreements. \n \nE. \n \n20. \nthe facility administration manual (FAM).11\n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \n \n\n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \n7 years \n \n\n                                                \n10 Framework  Financing  Agreement  and  Periodic  Financing  Request  for  Tranche  1,  and  Approach  to  Time-Slice \n\nFinancing (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n11 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fArrangements \n31 December 2018 \n\nAspects \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n(i) Executing agency \n(ii) Key implementing agency  Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL) for the railway improvement component \n(iii) Implementation unit \n\nMinistry of Railways (MOR) \n\nProcurement (ADB-financed  \ncontract packages) \nConsulting services (ADB-\nfinanced contract packages) \nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \nDisbursementa  \n\nRVNL head office I n Delhi, and 5 RVNL project site offices and 1 MOR project office: \nNumber of staff proposed: 50 \nICB for railway improvement \nICB for efficiency enhancement and CDM \nQCBS (full technical proposal) \nGeneral consultant \nWorks, goods, and consulting services \n\n20 contracts \nTbd \n78 international \nand 390 national \n\n$731 million \n$13 million \n$7 million \n \n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed \nupon between the government and ADB. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  CDM  =  Clean  Development  Mechanism,  ICB  =  international  competitive  bidding, \nQCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and the Ministry of Railways. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n21. \nTo  enhance  competition  in  procurement,  contracts  are  packaged  to  allow  bidders  to \nsubmit  multiple  contracts  at  once  with  discounts.  A  general  consultant  is  engaged  to  manage \nthe overall investment program and provide technical advice on implementation scheduling with \ncritical  path  analysis  based  on  international  best  practice.  Environmental  considerations  were \nenhanced  by  providing  tree  planting  along  the  railways  in  addition  to  mandatory  government \ntree  planting.  A  modern  signaling  and  telecommunication  system  will  be  provided  that  will \nenhance safety and environmental considerations such as light-emitting diode (LED) signals for \ngood  visibility  and  use  of  solar  panel  systems  in  all  non-electrified  areas  as  primary  means of \npower supply. \n \n22. \nA  preliminary  study  indicated  that  the  potential  exists  for  the  investment  program  to \nregister  CER  credits  with  the  CDM,  due  to  substantial  (0.9  million  t)  annual  carbon  emission \nreductions as a result of the modal shift from vehicular traffic along project corridors. Technical \nassistance will be provided separately along with the investment program to pursue CER credits \nand  enhance  Indian  Railways\u2019  CDM  activities,  including  possible  registration  under  the  United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \n \nB. \n \nThe  economic  assessment12 was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for \n23. \nthe Economic Analysis of Projects.13\n The program will enhance capacity to meet the anticipated \ntraffic  demand  and  avoid  diversion  of  incremental  goods  traffic  onto  the  road  network,  which \nwould  result  in  increased  transport  costs.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  ranges  from \n15.6%  to  20.1%  for  individual  projects,  indicating  that  the  proposed  investment  program  is \neconomically viable. A sensitivity analysis tested the effects of possible negative changes in the \nkey parameters that determine the program\u2019s costs and benefits. This analysis indicates that the \nprogram\u2019s economic viability would remain satisfactory even under adverse scenarios. \n \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n12 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nThe  financial  assessment  (footnote  12)  was  undertaken  on  an  incremental  basis  using \n24. \nthe discounted cash flow method, and calculating the internal rate of return of the program. The \nexisting  single-line  railway  sections  are  operating  at  or  above  capacity;  without  capacity \naugmentation,  they  will  not  be  able  to  carry  the  projected  incremental  traffic.  The  financial \ninternal rate of return ranges from 12.9% to 15.9%, which is above the average cost of capital \n(7.9%).  Sensitivity  and  risk  analyses  indicate  that  the  investment  program\u2019s  financial  internal \nrate  of  return  is  robust  under  adverse  conditions.  Based  on  the  financial  projections  and \nfinancial evaluation, the program is considered both financially viable and sustainable. \n \nC. \n \n25. \nInstitutional.  RVNL  is  primarily  a  project  delivery  organization.  The  administrative \ncontrol  rests  with  MOR. RVNL  has  sufficient  capacity  to  implement the  program,  which  will  be \nsupported  by  the  general  consultant  for  the  overall  program  scheduling  and  coordination,  in \naddition to the project-specific project management consultants for construction supervision. \n \nFinancial  management.  RVNL  has  satisfactory  project  financial  accounting  capacity \n26. \nand knowledge of ADB disbursement procedures. All finance units of the project implementation \nunits will be staffed before project commencement. The project accounts will be audited by the \nstatutory  auditor.  MOR  and  RVNL  will  establish  and  maintain  separate  project  records  and \naccounts to  identify  the financing resources  received  and  expenditures, ensuring  an  adequate \naudit  trail.  RVNL  has  a  quarterly  internal  audit  which  is  reviewed  by  the  audit  committee.  The \nstatutory auditor appointed by the government's Office of Comptroller and Auditor General will \nannually  audit  the  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  in  accordance  with \ninternational auditing standards. All recommendations of financial management assessment will \nbe \nreporting \nstandardization, strengthening project audit, and assessment of budget and actual expenditure \nfor better budgeting and control. \n \n27. \nProcurement  and  anticorruption.  RVNL  has  a  chief  vigilance  officer  to  handle  all \ngrievances including those relating to procurement. The Central Vigilance Commission, through \nits  Chief  Technical  Examiners  Organization,  conducts  systematic  analysis  and  monitoring  for \ncompliance with procurement procedures and rules as well as issues guidance and instructions \nto  prevent  any  irregularities.  The  independent  safety  commissioner  will  undertake  a  final \ntechnical  audit  before  commissioning.  Contracts  financed  by  ADB  will  use  a  procurement \nprocess  and  bidding  documents  that  follow  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  include  a  policy  statement  on \navoiding  corrupt  practices.  The  government  will  publish  information  relating  to  the  investment \nprogram\u2014  including  business  opportunities,  and  information  on  procurement  of  goods,  works, \nand consulting services\u2014on RVNL and MOR websites. RVNL will also make available to ADB \non  request  copies  of  internal  audit  reports.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to \ndate)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  MOR,  and  RVNL.  The  specific \nmeasures are described in the FAM (footnote 11).  \n \nD. \n \nThe  railway  will  traverse  Andhra  Pradesh,  Chhattisgarh,  Karnataka,  Maharashtra,  and \n28. \nOrissa.  According  to  the  government\u2019s  Human  Development  Report  2001, 14\n the  human \ndevelopment index for Maharashtra (0.523) and Karnataka (0.478) are higher than the national \nlevel of 0.472, while Andhra Pradesh (0.416), Chhattisgarh, and Orissa (0.404) are lower than \nthe  national  level.  About  64%  of the  people  living  in the five  states  reside  in rural  areas; most \n\nimplementation  such  as \n\ninvestment  program \n\nimplemented  during \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nthe \n\n                                                \n14  Government of India. National Planning Commission. 2001. National Human Development Report. New Delhi. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fderive their livelihood from agriculture and labor. Poverty is particularly acute in the rural areas. \nAccording to 2005 government estimates, the proportion of the rural population living below the \nofficial poverty line in Orissa (46%), Chhattisgarh (41%), and Maharashtra (31%) are above the \nnational  average  (28%).  The  poverty  and  social  assessment  (PSA)  surveyed  11,297 \nhouseholds  and  held  125  focus  group  discussions,  participated  in  by  men  and  women;  the \nmajority  stated  that  the  investment  program  will  increase  economic  and  employment \nopportunities  by  improving  linkages  to  markets,  production  centers,  and  public  and  social \nservice facilities. Approximately 21 million people living in the areas influenced by the program \nwill experience direct and indirect economic benefits brought about by the proposed investment, \nand about 5,400 person-years of work will be created for laborers during construction.15\n \n \n29. \nGender.  Data  from  2009  indicate  the  average  gender  development  index  in  the  five \nstates  as  0.586,  close  to  the  national  figure  of  0.590.  The  gender  development  indexes  for \nMaharashtra  (0.677)  and  Karnataka  (0.611)  are  above  that  of  India,  while  the  indexes  for \nAndhra Pradesh (0.574), Chhattisgarh (0.542), and Orissa (0.524) are below the national level. \nA  total  of  91  focus  group  discussions  were  undertaken  with  914  women  from  different \nsocioeconomic groups. Women stated that the investment will benefit them, as increased train \nreliability  and  frequency  will  facilitate  industrial  development  and  economic  growth.  The \nparticipation of both men and women has been ensured during project planning and will also be \nensured  during  implementation.  MOR  established  the  Railway  Women\u2019s Welfare  Organization \nin  1962,  which  has  successfully  contributed  to  women\u2019s  empowerment  by  increasing  the  self-\nsufficiency  of  women.  The  same  effects  for  women  are  expected  to  be  attained  under  this \ninvestment.  The  bidding  documents  provide  clauses  designed  to  ensure  that  all  civil  works \ncontractors  comply  with  applicable  labor  laws;  do  not  employ  child  labor;  encourage  the \nemployment  of  the  poor,  particularly  women;  and  do  not  offer  different  wages  to  men  and \nwomen,  particularly  for  work  of  equal  value.  The  nongovernment  organization  responsible  for \nresettlement  plan  implementation  will  employ  a  gender  expert  to  ensure  implementation  of \ncontracts. The expert will also train poor women to upgrade their livelihood skills, and conduct \ngender and child labor awareness campaigns. \n \n30. \nHIV  and  AIDS.  Andhra  Pradesh,  Karnataka,  and  Maharashtra  are  all  noted  to  have  a \nhigh prevalence of HIV/AIDS by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) and have been \nconducting  HIV  sentinel  surveillance  since  1998  as  part  of  NACO\u2019s  National  AIDS  Control \nProgram. All five states traversed by the railway have their own state AIDS control or prevention \nsociety  and  are  committed  to  tackle  HIV/AIDS,  undertaking  a  multipronged  and  multisectoral \napproach  in  prevention  and  control;  programs  include  mass  media  campaigns,  adolescence \neducation,  and  awareness  building  in  women\u2019s  self-help  groups,  and  improving  access  to \ntesting  facilities.  The  states  also  collaborate  closely  with  other  development  partners  in \nprevention and treatment efforts. Chhattisgarh and Orissa have a low prevalence of HIV/AIDS, \nbut  intense  prevention  and  communication  programs  are  ongoing.  MOR  has  an  AIDS  control \ncell in MOR and its operational zones, and has adopted a wide range of national policies for HIV \ncontrol  since  1997.  The  focus  of  the  cell  is  to  improve  awareness  among  all  employees  and \nothers  associated  with  the  Indian  Railways  community  and  introduce  HIV/AIDS  training  to \nmedical and paramedical staff. \n \n31. \nBased on the PSA, there is no risk that the investment program will increase HIV/AIDS \nincidence.  Contractors  will  carry  out  HIV/AIDS  awareness  for  their  laborers  at  work  sites  and \nthis will be monitored by the general consultant during project implementation. In addition, with \nthe  State  AIDS  Control  Society,  NACO,  and  other  public  health  agencies,  the  nongovernment \n\n                                                \n15 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\norganizations  responsible  for  implementing  the  resettlement  plan  will  carry  out  HIV/AIDS \ninformation campaigns in communities in areas influenced by the program. \n \nE. \n \n32. \nEnvironmental  impact.  There  are  no  environmentally  sensitive  features  in  the  areas \naffected  by  the  proposed  investment,  and  the  program  has  been  categorized  as  B  in \naccordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Initial environmental examinations \nprepared for all the projects show that the environmental impacts associated with establishment \nof  double  tracks,  including  embankment  construction,  are  minor,  with  most  impacts  likely  to \noccur  during  the  construction  stage.  Recommended  mitigation  measures  will  be  implemented \nunder the environmental management plan and monitored under the environmental monitoring \nplan.  The  general  consultants  will  conduct  a  training  program  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of \nRVNL officials to address environmental concerns, including supervising implementation of the \nenvironmental  management  and  monitoring  plans.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework  has  been  prepared  to  guide  the  implementation  of  environment  safeguard \nrequirements for the investment program and subsequent tranches. \n \n33. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  investment  program  is  categorized  as  A  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Six  resettlement  plans  were  prepared  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement; the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (amended \nin  1984);  and  the  National  Rehabilitation  and  Resettlement  Policy  (2007).  According  to  the \nproject census, 3,945 persons will be affected by the projects, out of which 76 households will \nbe  physically  displaced  and  344  economically  displaced. The total  resettlement  budget for  the \nprogram  is  Rs135,033,578.  Compensation  rates  for  the  loss  of  land  and  structures,  shifting \nassistance,  income  restoration  assistance,  and  additional  support  for  vulnerable  groups  are \nprovided  in  the  resettlement  framework  and  resettlement  plans.  Meaningful  consultation  and \ninformation  disclosure  were  undertaken  during  the  preparation  of  resettlement  plans,  including \nwith  (i)  project-displaced  persons  and  (ii)  the  general  public  through  the  ADB  website.  If  any \nchanges  or  additional  land  requirements  or  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  are  identified \nduring implementation, a related resettlement plan will be prepared or modified according to the \napplicable laws referred to in the resettlement plan. ADB\u2019s prior approval will be obtained before \nfurther implementation of the relevant section of the subproject. \n \n34. \nImpact on indigenous peoples. The investment program is classified as category B in \naccordance  with  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Scheduled tribes  account for  31.8%  of \nthe total population in Chhattisgarh, 16.6% in Orissa, 8.9% in Maharashtra, 6.6% in Karnataka, \nand  6.6%  in  Andhra  Pradesh.  The  tribal  population  is  scattered  and  not  concentrated  in  any \nparticular project areas, and interacts freely with the outside community. The study undertaken \nduring  investment  program  preparation  did  not  show  any  difference  in  impact  between \nindigenous and non-indigenous groups in the project locations. The PSA survey confirmed that \nthe socioeconomic impacts of the investment program will not differ significantly for tribal groups \ncompared  with  the  remainder  of  the  population.  In  addition,  meaningful  consultations  were \nconducted  with  both  primary  and  secondary  stakeholders  to  obtain  a  comprehensive \nperspective on the investment program and its impacts, and to obtain an estimate of losses that \nthey  would  suffer  and to  develop  ways  to  mitigate those  losses.  Special provisions  have  been \nmade  under the  resettlement  plans to  address  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples.  An  indigenous \npeoples planning framework was prepared to address any unanticipated impacts on indigenous \npeoples during the implementation of existing or additional projects. If any significant impacts on \nindigenous peoples are identified, an indigenous peoples plan will be prepared and submitted to \nADB for approval. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n \n35. \nmeasures are summarized in the risk assessment and risk management plan.16\nbenefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nThe  key  risks  are  delays  in  implementation  (Table  4).
