Quality \ninclude  developing  competency-based  standards  and \ncurriculum,  training  vocational  instructors,  and  strengthening  TVET  management  capacity  in \nHunan\u2019s TVET institutions to support inclusive and environmentally sustainable development. A \nkey  project  focus  is  on  strengthening  industry  participation  in  TVET  and  ensuring  greater \nalignment between TVET and labor market needs.2   \n \n\nimprovements \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe PRC is one of the fastest growing economies, with an average annual growth rate of \nover 9.0% since the 1980s. The government\u2019s 12th Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015, targets annual \ngross domestic product (GDP) growth of 7.5%. Despite impressive growth, the PRC is facing a \nnumber of urgent development challenges. The government\u2019s key priorities include restructuring \nthe  economy  from  production  and  export  to  consumption-oriented  growth,  from  low  to  higher \nvalue-added industries, and supporting rapid urbanization and environmentally sustainable and \nsocially  inclusive  development\u2014all  of  which  require  significant  investments  in  human  capital. \nStrengthening  human  resources  through the  development  of  TVET  is  one  of  the  key  priorities \nunder the 12th Five-Year Plan. \n \n4. \nThe  PRC  is  experiencing  skill  and  labor  shortages.  National  labor  market  data  from \n91 cities  in  2012  showed  that  demand  exceeded  supply  in  almost  all  technical  and  skilled \ncategories.  The  PRC\u2019s  comparative  advantage  in  low-skilled  labor-intensive  production  is \nexpected  to  decline,  with the  economy  shifting  to more  skill-intensive  products  and  production \ntechnologies.  The  Government  of  the  PRC  is  increasingly  emphasizing  the  value  of  highly \nskilled  human  capital.  In  2010,  the  central  government  identified  TVET  as  the  key  target  for \neducational  expansion  to  develop  a  skilled  work  force,  and  approved  the  National  Long-Term \nStrategy  on  Education,  2010\u20132020.  The  education  plan  sets  up  goals  and  reforms  to  better \nalign the education system with the demands of economic and social development. \n \n5. \nHunan is a province with a population of 70 million, located in the south central part of \nthe  PRC.  The  GDP  per  capita  of  Hunan  in  2011  was  $4,742,  below  the  national  average  of \n$5,583. In 2011, 9.08 million people, or 15.9% of the rural registered population in Hunan lived \nbelow the national poverty line, higher than the national average of 13.4%.3  \n \n6. \nThe  structure  of  Hunan\u2019s  economy  is  undergoing  fundamental  transformation.  The \nGovernment of the PRC\u2019s policy of geographical rebalancing of economic growth toward inland \nprovinces has led to Hunan\u2019s emergence as an important industrial base, requiring a large and \nmulti-skilled  work \ninclude  manufacturing,  automobile, \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

The  growth  rate  of \nthe  manufacturing  and  services  sectors  in  Hunan  has  been  higher  than  the  national  average, \nparticularly  for  the  manufacturing  sector,  which  contributed  56.0%  to  Hunan\u2019s  GDP  in  2010. \nDemand for skilled workers in Hunan exceeded supply in 2011, with manufacturing having the \nhighest  demand.  Hunan  ranks  19th  in  the  PRC  in  terms  of  educational  attainment,  with  an \naverage  level  of  educational  attainment  of  9.1  years.  The  urbanization  level  of  Hunan  was \n45.0%  in  2011,  and  is  forecast  to  grow  to  66.0%  by  2030.  Increased  industrialization  and \nurbanization, and the subsequent transformation of livelihood bases, will require skilled workers. \n \n7. \nSince 2007, Hunan provincial government (HPG) has been actively pursuing reforms in \nthe  TVET  sector.  Investment  in  TVET  development  has  played  an  important  role  in  helping \ndisadvantaged  people gain  new  skills  and enjoy  the growth  benefits,  as over  80%  of  students \nenrolled in Hunan\u2019s TVET institutions are from rural areas or low-income urban families. Despite \nimpressive  progress,  TVET  development  in  Hunan  faces  a  number  of  challenges,  including \n(i) limited  industry  involvement,  (ii)  lack  of  accurate  and  consistently  sourced  labor  market \ninformation, (iii) outdated curriculum and teaching and learning materials, (iv) need to upgrade \ninstructional  skills  and  workplace  experience  of  vocational  instructors,  (v)  inadequate  TVET \ninstitution  management  capacity  to  strengthen  linkages  between  schools  and  industry,  and \n(vi) lack of and/or  obsolete  equipment to  simulate  a  workplace for  practical  demonstration  and \napplication.  \n \n8. \nGreater involvement of enterprises in advising and directing the TVET system is critical \nto increase TVET\u2019s responsiveness to labor  market  needs.  HPG  established  industry  advisory \ngroups (IAGs) as a way to foster industry involvement in TVET, but the capacity of the IAGs to \nengage with industry needs to be strengthened. While demand for workers is strong in Hunan \nand  placement  rates  for  graduates  are  high  (over  80%  in  many  TVET  institutions),  TVET \ninstitutions are faced with the challenge of updating their programs to meet the demands of new \nindustries, and upgrading older industries.  \n \n9. \nTo address these challenges, the project will provide targeted support to 13 public TVET \ninstitutions  in  Hunan  to  strengthen  the  capability  to  deliver  demand-driven  quality  programs \nrelated to priority industries. The project will  build the capacity of IAGs and foster partnerships \nbetween 13 project TVET institutions and employers to jointly develop the skills needed  in the \nworkplace,  and  prepare  graduates  who  are  able  to  adjust  to  changing  demands  in  the  labor \nmarket quickly; modernize the curriculum by developing competency-based curriculum (CBC) in \npriority  areas;  upgrade  the  instructional  capacity  of  vocational  instructors  and  build  TVET \nmanagement  capacity;  strengthen  market-oriented  program  planning  through  improved  labor \nmarket  information  system  (LMIS);  and  upgrade  equipment  and  facilities  in  selected  TVET \ninstitutions.  \n \nStrategic  fit.  The  project  is  the  first  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-financed  lending \n10. \nproject  for  TVET  in  the  PRC  and  is  envisaged  to  play  a  demonstration  role  for  TVET \ndevelopment  in  the  country.  Because  lack  of  worker  skills  and  education  are  viewed  as  a \nconstraint  to  the  PRC\u2019s  inclusive  growth,  ADB  involvement  in  the  TVET  sector  is  strongly \njustified.  The  project  supports  ADB\u2019s  education  policy  and  education  sector  strategies  and \nStrategy  2020. 4  It  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015 5  and \nsupports  the  PRC\u2019s  12th  Five-Year  Plan,  which  prioritizes  developing  high-quality  human \n\n                                                \n4  ADB.  2008.

The  project  will  strengthen  partnerships \nbetween  TVET  institutions  and  industries,  and  build  the  capacity  of  sector-\nspecific IAGs in the priority sectors. \nPromoting  inclusive  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training \ninformation  and  communication  technology.  The  project  will \nthrough \nbroaden  access  for  students  from  remote  areas  by  developing  online  TVET \ncourses, and thus foster sharing of teaching and learning resources among well-\ndeveloped TVET institutions in urban areas and less-developed TVET institutions \nin  poor  and  remote  areas  to  benefit  students  in  project  and  non-project  TVET \ninstitutions.  \nGreening  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training  provision.  The \nproject  will  contribute  to  the  Government  of  the  PRC\u2019s  objectives  of  developing \nan  environmentally  sustainable  and  energy-efficient  society  under  its  12th  Five-\nYear  Plan  by  designing,  constructing,  and  maintaining  teaching  and  learning \nbuildings that reduce energy and water use, and promoting sustainable practices \nsuch as reducing, reusing, and recycling resources; encouraging the selection of \ntraining  equipment  with  low  energy  consumption;  and  skills  mapping  to  identify \nskills needed for environmentally sustainable development in Hunan. \n\n \n\n \n11.  \nIncorporation  of  the  lessons  learned.  Lessons  from  activities  in  skills  training \nsupported  by  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  were  incorporated  into  the  project  design.  Lessons \ninclude  (i)  actively  involving  representatives  of  industries  and  IAGs  in  identifying  occupational \nareas that are in demand, developing competencies for market-demanded occupational areas, \nand working with the project TVET institutions to develop modular, CBC and learning materials; \n(ii)  conducting  tracer  studies  of  the  trainees,  and  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  relevant \ngovernment  agencies  and  the  TVET  institutions  to  analyze  labor  market  demand;  and  (iii) \nestablishing a project benefit monitoring and evaluation system. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n12. \nThe  impact  of  the  proposed  project  will  be  that  adequate  skilled  human  resources  are \navailable  to  contribute  to  inclusive  growth  and  social  development  in  Hunan  province.  The \noutcome will be strengthened capacity of the formal TVET system to meet labor market needs. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n13.   Output  1:  Improved  quality  and  relevance  of  the  technical  and  vocational \neducation  and  training  system.

Employers  will  benefit  from  improvements  in  the  quality  and \nrelevance  of  TVET  as  improved  skill  levels  are  directly  linked  to  improving  workplace \nproductivity,  product  quality,  and  service  standards.  By  improving  the  quality  and relevance of \nstudy programs, community and industry confidence in the TVET system to provide a pathway \nto meaningful employment will increase. The instructor development program will enable up to \n2,000  instructors  to  be  up-skilled  through  improved  in-service  teacher  training.  TVET \nmanagement  capacity  building  will  enable  up  to  500  TVET  managers  to  strengthen  their \nmanagement skills through improved management training programs. \n \nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nEconomic benefits. The economic benefits from the project will be derived mainly from \nthe  incremental  productivity  gains  resulting  from  improved  quality  and  efficiency  of  training, \nexpressed  in  terms  of  the  incremental  income  of  the  graduates.  The  direct  economic  benefits \nfrom  the  project  will  flow  from  the  increased  numbers  of  TVET  graduates  who  will  find  direct \nemployment.  Based  on  conservative  assumptions,  such  targeted  skills  development  can \nincrease monthly wages by CNY76. Estimating these benefits over 25 years, based on the total \nproject  cost  of  $105.84  million,  yields  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  16.9%.  Individual \neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  have  been  computed  for  each  TVET  institution  and  yield \nsatisfactory results. These are documented in the economic analysis.9 Other indirect benefits of \nthe project, which will most likely accrue to society at large and not just the direct beneficiaries \nof the project, are (i) improvements in the provision of quality skills at selected TVET institutions \nwill also benefit non-project TVET institutions and thereby improve the quality and relevance of \nthe sector to the needs of industry, and (ii) enhanced responsiveness of TVET will improve the \nrelevance of skills and employment outcomes of graduates beyond project completion.  \n \n23. \nFinancial sustainability. A financial sustainability analysis was undertaken during project \npreparation,  based  on fiscal  impact.  The  project  should  be  financially  sustainable  as  the  bulk  of \nexpenditures  do  not  carry  on  beyond  the  end  of  the  project.  Recurrent  expenditures  such  as \nequipment maintenance cost can be absorbed by additional revenues from government funding, \ntuition fees,  and tailored  training for  enterprises.  The financial  analysis  shows  that  during fiscal \nyears 2009\u20132011, total recurrent expenditure for TVET has almost doubled from CNY2.7 billion \nto  CNY4.7  billion,  indicating  the  relative  importance  given  to  increasing  skills  improvement  in \nHunan.10 The project will increase the labor market relevance of the TVET system, and this will \nimprove the sustainability of the TVET sector by making it better serve Hunan\u2019s socioeconomic \ndevelopment  needs.  Efficiency  gains  in  the  13  project  TVET  institutions  will  also  be  realized \nfacilities  and  equipment.  The \nthrough \ngovernment\u2019s annual commitment to the project as a percentage of the total education budget is \nprojected to increase from  0.03% in year 1 of the project to 0.18% in  year 3, and decrease to \n0.05%  by  year  5.  The  government\u2019s  annual  commitment  to  the  project  is  therefore  deemed \naffordable. \n \n\nincreased  enrolments  and  higher  utilization  of \n\n                                                \n9   Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10  Table 2 in the Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nGovernance  \n\nfinancing \n\ninstitutions. 11  The \n\n24. \nFinancial  management  and  procurement  capacity  assessment.  The  project  will  be \nADB\u2019s fourth project to Hunan, which is successfully managing other projects funded by bilateral \nfinancial  management  assessment  (FMA) \nand  multilateral \nconducted  for  the  project  management  office  (PMO)  and the  implementing  agencies  indicates \nthat  they  have  sufficient  financial  management  capacity  and  project  management  experience \nbut lack knowledge of ADB financial management, disbursement, and procurement guidelines. \nThe project includes the provision of training and advice to the PMO and implementing agencies \nin ADB procedures, including procurement, disbursement, and accounting systems. The project \nwill also support TVET institutions to undertake the necessary financial reporting required under \nthe project\u2019s financial compliance requirements. The FMA undertaken and the completed FMA \nquestionnaires are included in the full project financial analysis.12 Recommended improvements \nin  the  FMA  have  been  incorporated  into  the  project  design  and  are  documented  in  the  PAM. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with \nHPG  and  the  PMO.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 8). \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \n\nThe  project  contributes  to  the  central  and  provincial  government\u2019s  poverty  alleviation \n25. \nstrategies of enhancing the employability and skills of the labor force. In Hunan Province, over \n80%  of  TVET  students  are  from  rural  and  low-income  backgrounds.  The  project  will  support \nHunan\u2019s  distance  education  platform,  which  can  reach  thousands  of  adult  learners  in  Hunan \nevery  year  through  short-term  distance  learning  courses  to  improve  the  skills  of  farmers  and \nrural  migrants.  This  will  help  ensure  socially  inclusive  TVET  and  serve  as  a  model  for  other \nprovinces  seeking  to  increase  the  impact  and  scope  of  their  TVET  programs.  The  project  will \nmake selected online TVET courses available on Hunan\u2019s TVET portal for vocational schools in \nremote, poor areas, thus providing benefits to students from rural areas in non-project schools.  \n \n26. \nGender  and  development.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming \nand  includes  a  social  and  gender  action  plan  (SGAP)  to  facilitate  and  promote  the  increased \nparticipation  and  employment  of  female  students  in  priority  industries.  Gender  analysis  of \nstudents  and  staff  at  the  project  TVET  institutions  revealed  a  broad gender  balance  in  overall \nstudent and teaching numbers, but a significant under-representation of women in management \nlevel  jobs  in  the  TVET  institutions  and  a  gender  imbalanced  enrolment  depending  on  fields  of \nstudy. The key gender issues addressed by the project include (i) limited access of females to \nnontraditional  quality  skill  development  programs,  (ii)  limited  access  to  management  training \nand  teacher  training  among  female  instructors,  (iii)  gender  stereotypes  in  the  curriculum,  and \n(iv) lack of knowledge related to the range of study programs and career prospects for females \nin  male  dominant  skill  areas.  The  SGAP  includes  the  following  targets  and  gender-responsive \ndesign  features:  (i)  at  least  40%  of  instructors  trained  will  be  female,  (ii)  at  least  40%  of \nmanagers  trained  will  be  female,  (iii)  a  social  marketing  campaign  will  be  implemented  to \npromote female participation in nontraditional trades in priority sectors, (iv) gender indicators will \nbe  developed  in  the  pilot  LMIS,  and  (v)  gender  monitoring  and  evaluation  indicators  will  be \nintegrated in the overall design and monitoring framework to track  SGAP implementation. The \n\n                                                \n11  More  information  on  the  experience  of  Hunan  Provincial  Finance  Department,  HED,  and  the  PMO  in  managing \nprojects  funded  by  bilateral  and  other  multilateral  financing  institutions  is  available  in  the  linked  document  on \ndevelopment coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n12  Full Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fproject  will  conduct  a  study  on  access  to  TVET  for  disadvantaged  groups  during  loan \nimplementation. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment.  The  project \n\nis  classified  category  B  for  environment.  An \n\n27. \ninitial \nenvironment examination (IEE) including environmental management plan (EMP) was prepared \nand  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  12  February  2013.  The  IEE  complies  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  IEE  concludes  that  the  project\u2019s  anticipated \nenvironmental  impacts  can  be  mitigated  through  the  implementation  of  the  EMP.  During  the \nconstruction  of  new  buildings  and  facilities  on  existing  school  campuses,  some  environmental \nimpacts are anticipated including noise, fugitive dust, solid wastes, and risks to community and \noccupational  health  and  safety.  Overall,  construction-related  impacts  are  localized,  short-term, \nand can be effectively mitigated through the application of good construction practices and the \nimplementation  of  construction  phase  community  and  occupational  health  and  safety  plans. \nDuring operation, no major environmental impacts are anticipated. The EMP defines mitigation \nto  ensure  proper \nmeasures,  monitoring  requirements,  and \nenvironmental  management  throughout  the  project  construction  and  operation.  Environmental \nmanagement  is  supported  by  loan  covenants,  and  capacity  development  and  institutional \nstrengthening  activities  under  the  project.  The  PMO  will  establish  a  grievance  redress \nmechanism and handle any dispute arising from noncompliance with the EMP.  \n \n28. \nResettlement.  The  involuntary  resettlement  category  is  C.  The  project  activities  will \nneither  require  land  acquisition  nor  resettlement.  Resettlement  due  diligence  was  conducted, \nwhich confirmed that there are no legacy issues from the time the campuses were established.  \n \n29. \nIndigenous  people.  The  indigenous  peoples\u2019  category  is  C.  No  project  activities  will \nadversely affect indigenous people. The poverty and social assessment determined that ethnic \nminority  students  are  well  integrated  into  all  the  project  TVET  institutions.  Increased  quality  of \nTVET as a result of the project will benefit all students, including ethnic minorities. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\ninstitutional  responsibilities \n\n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.13 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nTVET programs do not \nmeet the needs of the \nindustries they aim to \nserve \n\nInadequate technical \ncapacity to implement \nCBC \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe project will build capacity of IAGs for key industries forming the main \nclient base of the project TVET institutions.  \nThe project will facilitate industry engagement in improving study program \nquality and relevance. \nThe project will pilot test an LMIS to assess industry needs. \nThe  project  will  front-load  capacity  building  and  training  activities  for \ncurriculum revision and school leadership development.  \nThe  project  will  develop  a  well-designed  monitoring  and  evaluation \nframework with implementation support from consultants. \n\n                                                \n13  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nRisks \nOveremphasis on \nupgrading equipment \nand infrastructure at \nschool level without due \nattention to CBC and \nteacher training \nLack of project \ncoordination and \nsynchronization between \nagencies \nDelays in the \nprocurement process \n\nMitigating Measures \nAll  TVET  institutions  benefitting  from  equipment  provision  under  the \nproject will benefit from capacity-building activities.
