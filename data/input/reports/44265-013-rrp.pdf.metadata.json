I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Second Health Care in the Central Highlands \nProject.1  \n \n2.  The central highlands lag most other regions of Viet Nam in terms of health and health \nservices indicators toward Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).2 The project will help the \ngovernment to further reduce maternal and child mortality by addressing access to and quality \ngaps in commune health stations (CHSs) and hospitals and by strengthening provincial health \nmanagement in five provinces, thereby targeting the poor, ethnic groups, and women and \nchildren in particular.   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale  \n \n3.  The Government of Viet Nam is highly committed to providing health care for all its \ncitizens. Viet Nam\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2011\u20132015 gives high priority to the \nhealth sector as a core pillar of sustainable socioeconomic development. Through its Five-Year \nHealth Sector Development Plan, 2011\u20132015, the government seeks to develop an extended \nand robust health-care network. Emphasis is on access to primary health care in mountainous, \nremote, and isolated areas to enhance public health performance.3 Investing in primary health \ncare helps prevent families slipping into poverty due to high out-of-pocket spending for higher \nlevel medical services, improves productivity, and addresses public goods and services with \nexternalities.4   \n \n4.  Poverty incidence remains high in the central highlands region of Viet Nam. The central \nhighlands, which comprises the provinces of Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Gia Lai, Kon Tum, and Lam \nDong, is changing rapidly  with strong economic growth and interregional and intraregional \nmigration.5 However, poverty persists in particular among the ethnic groups, who constitute 38% \nof  the  region\u2019s  population  of  5.3  million  people.  The  poor  comprise  22%  of  the  region\u2019s \npopulation, 6 a figure  that  rises  to  51%  among the  region\u2019s  ethnic groups.7 Nationally,  the \npoverty incidence is 14% (footnote 6). \n \n5.  Viet Nam\u2019s impressive progress towards MDGs is held back by poor health indicators in \nthe central and northern uplands, in particular for maternal and child mortality and especially in \nremote rural communities with ethnic groups. The national maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in \n2011 was 67 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births,8 still short of the MDG target of 58 in \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.

", "2  \n \n2015.9 In the central highlands region, the MMR in 2009 was an estimated 108 and probably \nmuch higher among ethnic groups.10 The national infant mortality rate (IMR) was 15.5 deaths \nper 1,000 live births in 2011(footnote 8), and among ethnic groups, 30.0,11 also above the MDG \ntarget of 14.8 in 2015.12 In the central highlands, the 2011 IMR of the general population was \n24.3 (footnote 8). The national under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) was 23.3 deaths per 1,000 live \nbirths in 2011, and among ethnic groups, 39.0 (footnote 11), compared with an MDG target of \n19.3 (footnote 12). In the central highlands, the 2011 U5MR of the general population was \n37.0.13 While communicable diseases are becoming less prevalent in the region among the \nmajority  Kinh  population,  ethnic groups  suffer  a  high  burden  of respiratory,  intestinal,  and \nparasitic infections that contribute to malnutrition, which is estimated to affect almost a quarter \nof the children below age 5 (footnote 8). \n \n6.  Nationally, the government has established a wide network of health services. The \nstandard  public  health system comprises  CHSs,  district hospitals,  provincial  hospitals,  and \nnational referral institutions. Recognizing constraints on accessibility, efficiency, and resources, \nthe  government  has  added,  where  needed,  intercommunal  polyclinics  (ICPs),  interdistrict \nhospitals, and interprovincial (regional) hospitals.  \n \n7.  To improve health care in the central highlands, the government has since the 1990s \nmobilized  state  bonds  and  external  assistance  toward  making  substantial  investments  in \nhospital development.14 The government has developed a network of health facilities in the \ncentral highlands region, including 71 hospitals,15 49 ICPs, and 722 CHSs, and preventive \nmedicine facilities. The few small private hospitals and most private clinics are in urban areas.  \n \n8.  Access to community health care and its quality. To help address the high burden of \ndisease and mortality in villages, the Ministry of Health (MOH) supports information, education, \nand communication (IEC) programs; outreach services; village health workers (VHWs); and \nvillage birth attendants (VBAs). Most villages have at least one VHW, male or female, and a \nVBA. VBAs are expected to attend deliveries only in remote locations, otherwise refer patients \nfor delivery in the CHS. The MOH has initiated a program to upgrade the skills of VHWs and \nVBAs with a 6-month training program, however, in-service training and the supervision of \nVHWs and VBAs need to be expanded and improved. VHWs and VBAs also lack basic supplies \nsuch as delivery kits.  \n \n9.  CHSs are essential links in the care and referral chain from communities and hospitals, \nparticularly for the poor and ethnic groups. In the central highlands, CHSs are underutilized: \npatients prefer to use public hospitals as first point of contact (footnote 6). The catchment areas \nof CHSs are twice as large as the national average because population density is low. CHSs \nmay be bypassed if located close to a hospital. Many CHSs are small and in bad condition, \nsometimes operating in one room or rented premises, with facilities and equipment requiring \n                                                \n9  United  Nations  Development  Programme.

Recognizing constraints on accessibility, efficiency, and resources, the government has added, where \nneeded, intercommunal polyclinics (ICPs), interdistrict hospitals, and interprovincial (regional) hospitals. \n15  Including provincial hospitals, municipal hospitals, specialized hospitals, and district health centers. \n ", "3 \n \nupgrade or replacement. The MOH is planning to upgrade selected busy CHSs into ICPs to \nimprove emergency care and relieve crowding in hospitals. This would require the provision of \nmore advanced diagnostic equipment and basic inpatient facilities.  \n \n10.  CHS quality is perceived as poor. The quality of care in CHSs is affected by the lack of \nskilled  staff,  standard  procedures,  and  quality  assurance.16 Only  65%  of  communes  met \nnational  quality  assurance  benchmarks  in  2010  (footnote  8).  MOH  has  issued  clinical \nstandards, but they are not adapted to local conditions and are not implemented at the CHS \nlevel.17 While most CHSs have core staff including a midwife, only 58% have a doctor, well \nbelow the national target of 80%. The MOH has tried to redress the shortage of rural doctors by \nappointing  assistant  doctors18 and,  more  recently,  by  intensively  educating  ethnic  college \nstudents to improve their grades and allow them to enter the medical university and become \ndoctors.  Medical  staff  also  tends  to  disregard  poor  patients  and  often  lacks  intercultural \ncommunication skills in dealing with ethnic patients.  \n \n11.   Access to hospital services and their quality. Life-threatening obstetric, pediatric, \nand other emergencies demand quick access to high-quality inpatient care. A 2001 study found \ntwo-thirds of maternal deaths occurring at home.19 Major issues are late referral and the lack of \nsuitable and affordable referral services. The central highlands have 1.6 hospital beds per 1,000 \npeople, or half the 3.1 in all of Viet Nam. A typical provincial hospital in the central highlands has \na bed occupancy rate of about 150%. A typical district hospital has a bed occupancy rate of \n100%. Public demand for hospital services, including from the poor, is expected to further \nincrease with more public awareness and the improved range and quality of services, as well as \nwith expanded health insurance coverage. Older hospitals are often small, congested, and \nrundown. The government has invested in replacing or upgrading these hospitals. However, \nseveral new hospitals could not be completed for lack of funds and need additional investment \nin equipment and civil works, including wastewater treatment plants.20   \n \n12.  Hospitals with high bed occupancy find it difficult to maintain hygiene and infection \ncontrol.  Overcrowding  in  the  outpatient  department  contributes  to  poor  diagnostics  and \nunnecessary admissions. On the other hand, some district hospitals are less busy for lack of \nspecialists, equipment, and supplies for core services like emergency surgery, delivery, and \nneonatal and infant care. District hospitals near a provincial hospital are particularly prone to \nbeing bypassed or routinely referring patients to provincial hospitals. Improving district hospitals \nand referral systems will help reduce overloading at provincial hospitals.  \n \n13.  Ratios of health care human resources to population in the central highlands are close \nto national ratios,  but  staff qualifications  are  much  lower. Particularly  lacking are medical \nspecialists, pharmacists, senior nurses, and ethnic staff. In general, hospital staff skills need to \nbe  upgraded  more  systematically  and  sustainably  using  local  capacity.  Provincial  medical \nteaching institutions are well placed to accomplish this but they need better equipment, training \nsystems, and teaching and methodological skills.  \n                                                \n16 Belgian Technical Cooperation. 2009.

Manila. \n20 As for CHSs, the catchment areas of district hospitals in the region are twice as large as the national average, but \ncatchment populations are too small to add hospitals. Instead, ICPs are being considered for rural hubs.     \n ", "4  \n \n14.  Provincial health systems management. In addition to gaps in access and quality, \nmanagement  challenges  need  to  be  addressed  to  improve  the  effectiveness,  equity,  and \nefficiency of the provincial health system. The government has substantially increased financing \nfor health services, but health spending continues to favor bureaucratic criteria over actual \nneeds, hospital services over community health care, and investments over recurrent spending. \nDemand for high-end medical technology may further undermine future spending on basic care. \nProvincial health managers need training on health financing. Provincial governments also play \nan  important  role  in  allocating  resources  and  need  guidance  on  result-based  health  care \ninvestment.  A  new  tool  for  annual  planning  and  budgeting  has  been  introduced  to  better \ncoordinate and target resources. This needs to be disseminated more widely in the provinces \nand  training  is  required  for  its  proper  and  effective  application.  Orienting  provincial  health \nmanagement  more  toward  results  requires  improving  the  health  management  information \nsystem,  which  is  currently  fragmented  and  offers  limited  accessibility  and  usefulness  in \ndecision-making. \n \n15.  In district hospitals, management support systems to help improve the quality of services \nare weak in terms of facility management, infection control and waste management, information \nmanagement, building and equipment maintenance, procurement and inventory management, \nand financial management. Managers make insufficient use of management tools, standards, \nand data, and lack opportunities to improve their management skills.21    \n \n16.  Further, a major concern in the region is the lack of information and public awareness on \nhealth issues, particularly among women, the poor, and ethnic groups. Unsafe practices such as \nchild delivery without skilled assistance and lack of hygiene at home are common. Major issues \nare the lack of IEC specially designed for women, the poor, and ethnic groups, compounded by \ndeficient communication skills among health care providers. Awareness campaigns for health \nthat deliver culture- and gender-sensitive messages are needed. Training should focus as well \non improving health care staff skills for culture-sensitive communication.  \n \n17.  Lessons. The earlier project, implemented from 2004 to 2011, helped improve hospital \nservices, staff capacity, and affordability for the poor in the central highlands.22 It (i) upgraded \nand equipped one provincial hospital, two secondary medical schools, nine preventive and IEC \ncenters, and 12 district hospitals and wastewater treatment plants; (ii) provided training for \ndoctors and nurses; and (iii) piloted a health equity fund for the poor. The project completion \nreport rated the project successful and recommended (i) targeting the poor and ethnic groups, \n(ii) focusing on more local facilities, (iii) improving resource allocation, (iv) improving health \nsector  planning,  (v) ensuring  counterpart  funding  for  infrastructure,  (vi)  preparing  long-term \ntraining plans, (vii) improving procurement systems, and (viii) improving project monitoring. 23 \nThe  proposed  project  was  designed  taking  into  consideration  these  lessons  from  the  first \nproject.  \n \n18.  ADB strategy. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy 2012\u22122015 emphasizes support for \ndisadvantaged  populations  to  ensure  inclusive  growth  and  thereby  increase  social  and \neconomic  benefits.24It  includes  support  to  health  care  in  disadvantaged  areas  to  ensure \n                                                \n21 Government of Viet Nam, MOH. 2010.

ADB\u2019s operational plan for health also stresses the importance of achieving \nthe MDGs and addressing governance and financing issues in the health sector jointly with \nother development partners.25 \n  \n19.  Development coordination. In addition to ADB\u2019s earlier project (footnote 22), the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency and the governments of the Republic of Korea and Spain \nsupported hospital development in the central highlands. The European Union and Atlantic \nPhilanthropies also supported community health care. Pathfinder and the Government of the \nNetherlands have supported the development of model CHS services. ADB and global funding \nagencies also support the control of HIV and of neglected and emerging infectious diseases. \nCoordination of development assistance in the central highlands is undertaken mainly through \ndialogue between the MOH and development partners at the national level.26  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n20.  The impact will be improved health and nutrition in the central highlands, in particular for \nwomen, children, the poor, and ethnic groups. The outcome will be the increased use of health \nservices, in particular maternal and child health services in district hospitals, ICPs, and CHSs. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n21.  The project will have three key outputs: (i) improved access and quality of community \nhealth  care,  (ii)  increased  access  and  quality  of  hospital  services,  and  (iii)  strengthened \nprovincial health system management. The project will provide support in the five provinces of \nthe central highlands, in particular for activities to improve health care for the poor, ethnic \ngroups, and women and children living in remote communities.  \n \n1.  Output 1: Improved Access and Quality of Community Health Care \n \n22.  The project will support improved community health care with a focus on maternal and \nchild care for the poor and ethnic groups in rural locations. With support from district health \noffices, at least 20% of the rural CHSs will be selected to work with surrounding villages to \nimprove  community  health  care  through  outreach  services,  including  health  and  nutrition \npromotion and maternal and child care. 27 The project builds on and expands earlier programs \nfor improving basic health care using standard packages and quality assurance mechanisms28 \nand will help improve the health system and address gaps in resources.  \n \n23.  The project will provide (i) 6-month pre-service training for VHWs and VBAs to ensure \nthat all villages in the catchment areas of targeted CHSs have adequate VHWs and VBAs; and            \n(ii) refresher courses for VHWs and VBAs in the selected provinces, with priority given to \ncatchment areas of selected CHSs as appropriate. It will provide toolkits for all eligible VHWs \nand delivery kits for all eligible VBAs. It will also support IEC campaigns on health and nutrition. \nPrior to these campaigns, the project will conduct a knowledge, attitudes, and practices study in \nthe villages and produce IEC materials appropriate to the sociocultural context of the region. \nEleven vehicles will be provided to districts lacking transportation to improve CHS supervision \nand outreach services.  \n                                                \n25 ADB. 2008.

The project will build and equip 24 CHSs, replace and equip 10 ICPs, upgrade and equip \n30 CHSs, and complete the equipment of other selected CHSs and ICPs. It will support 150 \nscholarships for ethnic students in medical technician or nursing degree courses and support \nhealth quality improvement through in-service skills training for CHS and ICP staff in hospitals. \nStaff will also be trained to be aware of sociocultural barriers, in IEC skills, and caring for ethnic \npatients.  \n  \n2.  Output 2: Increased Access and Quality of Hospital Services  \n \n25.  The project will support district hospitals toward improving access to referral services \nand reducing the overloading of provincial hospitals. A comprehensive approach, focusing on \ndelivery of standard packages of health services, will be followed to improve hospital services \nand strengthen quality assurance. The project will help upgrade eight district hospitals, build one \nnew district hospital, equip about 27 district hospitals and 3 provincial hospitals (including for \nemergency services), and provide 28 ambulances. It will help repair and maintain water supply \nand sanitation in all eligible district hospitals.  \n  \n26.  To improve service quality, the project will support system development and training in \ninfection control, waste management, and quality assurance for selected staff in all district \nhospitals. It will support (i) short-term technical skills training for nurses, laboratory assistants, \nand  maintenance  specialists  in  all  district  hospitals; (ii) training  162 specialist  doctors; (iii) \nupgrading 125 assistant doctors and assistant pharmacists into doctors and pharmacists; and \n(iv) providing short courses for 111 specialist doctors. Priority will be given to female and ethnic \ncandidates.  \n  \n3.  Output 3: Strengthened Provincial Health System Management \n \n27.  The  project  will  help  improve  provincial  and  district  health  management  systems. \nActivities will include orientation for provincial governments and local leaders and training for \nprovincial  and  district  health  managers  and  CHS  and  ICP  heads  on  annual  planning  and \nbudgeting,  management  and  supervision  tools,  quality  assurance,  building  and  equipment \nmaintenance, and a health management information system.  \n \n28.  Capacity  building  in  public  health  and  hospital  management  will  include  a  3-month \ncertificate course for provincial and district health office managers, CHS and ICP heads, and \nhospital  managers  in  health  services  management.  This  will  include  human  resources \nmanagement, financial management, quality assurance, and health management information \nsystem,  and  mainstreaming  gender  and  ethnic  concerns.  Female  and  ethnic  staff  will  be \nprioritized. To improve training outcomes, the project will support the development of an in-\nservice training system, including a provincial training team and coordinator, a core group of \nteachers to improve teaching methodologies, distant learning materials, a database to identify \nstaff training needs, and field assessment.   \n \n29.  The project will have a central project management unit (CPMU) and five provincial \nproject management units (PPMU). Staff will be trained in planning, monitoring, procurement, \ndisbursement, and financial management. A project monitoring and evaluation system will be \nestablished. Project activities will be included in the annual operational plans of provinces, \nwhich will contribute to the sustainability of project benefits. The project will provide one vehicle \nfor supervision by CPMU.  \n \n \n ", "7 \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n30.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n32.  The MOH will be the executing agency. The project will be implemented through the \nCPMU in the MOH and five PPMUs in provincial departments of health. An MOH steering \ncommittee will provide project guidance and oversight. The project will be implemented in \ncoordination with development partners. The implementation arrangements are summarized in \nTable 3 and described in detail in the project administration manual (PAM).31 \n \n \n \n                                                \n29  ADB may cover transportation, insurance, and part of recurrent costs under the project.  \n30 ADB will finance the amount of taxes and duties as it (i) is within the reasonable threshold identified in the country \npartnership strategy, (ii) does not represent an excessive share of the project investment, (iii) applies only in \nrespect to ADB-financed expenditures, and (iv) is administratively expedient for the success of the project. \n31 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2014\u2013December 2019 \nEstimated completion date  December 2019 \nManagement   \n(i) Oversight body  MOH steering committee chaired by the minister or appointed representative and \nincluding heads of departments and representatives from the Ministry of Interior, \nMinistry of Finance, State Bank of Viet Nam, and Office of the Government  \n(ii) Executing agency  MOH \n(iii) Key implementing agencies  CPMU and PPMUs in five provincial departments of health \n(iv) Implementation unit  CPMU in MOH  \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  9 contracts  $20.50 million \nNational competitive bidding  16 contracts  $23.30 million  \nShopping  Multiple   \nConsulting services  Individual selection of international \nconsultants  3 contracts  $0.41 million \n  Individual selection of national consultants  19 contracts   $1.35 million \n  Quality- and cost-based selection  4 contracts  $1.89 million \n  Quality-based selection  2 contracts  $0.80 million \n  Least-cost selection  1 contract  $0.20 million \nAdvance action   Preparation of international and national consultant recruitment \nPreparation of bidding documents for the first 18 months \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nupon between the governments and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CPMU = central project management unit, MOH = Ministry of Health, PPMU = \nprovincial project management unit. \nSource: Government of Viet Nam and Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n33.  Technical  challenges  include  providing  health  care  in  remote  villages  and  to                                                                                                                              \nethnic groups and ensuring the procurement of high-quality civil works, equipment, and training. \nContracting  local  institutions  is  proposed  to  help  reach  remote  villages,  and  international \nconsultants to prepare engineering designs and specifications of equipment.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n34.  The  project  will  contribute  to  lifting  the  burden  of maternal  and  child  mortality  and \nimproving the health of people in participating provinces and districts, particularly the poor and \nvulnerable, including ethnic groups living in border areas. The project is pro-poor in its focus on \ndelivering and expanding health care in districts and communes. The estimated economic \ninternal rate of return is 21.4%, with benefits derived mainly from beneficiaries\u2019 productivity \ngains.32 The financial analysis assessed the recurrent cost of project investments to be below \n2% of provincial recurrent health spending, which is considered sustainable. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n35.  The MOH has substantial experience in implementing ADB-assisted projects and staff \nwith experience in ADB procedures. A financial management assessment confirmed that the \n                                                \n32 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n \nMOH has adequate capacity in project implementation. No major governance issues have been \nidentified in previous ADB-financed projects. CPMU and PPMU staff will receive governance \norientation. All procurement will be posted on the project website. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the MOH. \nSpecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote \n31). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social  \n \n36.   The targeted provinces have a high proportion of poor, who have limited access to and \nuse of health services, have less healthy living conditions, and have limited information on \nimproving their health. The project will increase access to and the demand for good quality \nhealth services at both the community and district levels. This will help improve the health of \npeople in the central highlands, particularly of the poor and members of ethnic groups. In turn, \nthis will improve their labor productivity and reduce health expenditures.33  \n \nE.  Gender Impacts \n \n37.   The  project  is  classified  under  category  I  (gender  equity  as  a  theme)  under  the \nguidelines for gender mainstreaming categories for ADB projects.34 Key gender impacts of the \nproject  include  (i)  new  and  upgraded  medical  facilities  and  equipment  that  prioritize  and \nstrengthen the capacity of health services to respond to women\u2019s needs; (ii) increased skills of \nfemale health staff and managers at all levels; (iii) the institutionalization of gender-responsive \nand patient-focused approaches to providing health care; and (iv) increased understanding \namong women and their families of the importance of accessing health care. The gender action \nplan aligns with national and sector-specific gender equality commitments.35  \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n38.  Environment (category B). Mainly beneficial impacts are expected from the project, as \nit  will  support  the  construction,  rehabilitation,  and  operation  of  health  facilities,  including \nimproved water, sanitation, and waste management systems. However, the construction of \nhospitals will cause disturbances, such as dust and noise. An initial environmental examination \nincluding an environment management plan has been prepared.36  \n  \n39.    Resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  will  not  involve  any  resettlement.  Most \nconstruction will take place in the existing compounds of health facilities. For new locations, \ngovernment land has been made available without affecting any households.  \n \n40.   Indigenous peoples (category B). The project has among its beneficiaries a significant \nproportion  of  ethnic  groups  who  are  among  some  of  the  poorest  and  most  marginalized \nhouseholds in Viet Nam. The indigenous peoples plan ensures that ethnic peoples\u2019 needs will \nbe analyzed and that they will participate in the project and have access to its benefits.37 The \nindigenous peoples plan has been disclosed on the ADB website. \n \n \n                                                \n33 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34  ADB. 2012.
