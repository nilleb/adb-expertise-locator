Viet  Nam\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015  gives  high  priority  to  the \nhealth sector as a core pillar of sustainable socioeconomic development. Through its Five-Year \nHealth  Sector  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  the  government  seeks  to  develop  an  extended \nand robust health-care network. Emphasis is on access to primary health care in mountainous, \nremote,  and  isolated  areas  to  enhance  public  health  performance.3 Investing  in  primary  health \ncare  helps  prevent  families  slipping  into  poverty  due  to  high  out-of-pocket  spending  for  higher \nlevel  medical  services,  improves  productivity,  and  addresses  public  goods  and  services  with \nexternalities.4   \n \n4. \nPoverty incidence remains high in the central highlands region of Viet Nam. The central \nhighlands, which comprises the provinces of Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Gia Lai, Kon Tum, and Lam \nDong,  is  changing  rapidly  with  strong  economic  growth  and  interregional  and  intraregional \nmigration.5 However, poverty persists in particular among the ethnic groups, who constitute 38% \nof  the  region\u2019s  population  of  5.3  million  people.  The  poor  comprise  22%  of  the  region\u2019s \npopulation,  6  a  figure  that  rises  to  51%  among  the  region\u2019s  ethnic  groups. 7  Nationally,  the \npoverty incidence is 14% (footnote 6). \n \n5. \nViet Nam\u2019s impressive progress towards MDGs is held back by poor health indicators in \nthe central and northern uplands, in particular for maternal and child mortality and especially in \nremote  rural  communities  with  ethnic  groups.  The  national  maternal  mortality  ratio  (MMR)  in \n2011  was  67  maternal  deaths  per  100,000  live  births,8 still  short  of  the  MDG  target  of  58  in \n\n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

The  national  under-5  mortality  rate  (U5MR)  was  23.3  deaths  per  1,000  live \nbirths in 2011, and among ethnic groups, 39.0 (footnote 11), compared with an MDG target of \n19.3  (footnote  12).  In  the  central  highlands,  the  2011  U5MR  of  the  general  population  was \n37.0.13 While  communicable  diseases  are  becoming  less  prevalent  in  the  region  among  the \nmajority  Kinh  population,  ethnic  groups  suffer  a  high  burden  of  respiratory,  intestinal,  and \nparasitic infections that contribute to malnutrition, which is estimated to affect almost a quarter \nof the children below age 5 (footnote 8). \n \nNationally,  the  government  has  established  a  wide  network  of  health  services.  The \n6. \nstandard  public  health  system  comprises  CHSs,  district  hospitals,  provincial  hospitals,  and \nnational referral institutions. Recognizing constraints on accessibility, efficiency, and resources, \nthe  government  has  added,  where  needed,  intercommunal  polyclinics  (ICPs),  interdistrict \nhospitals, and interprovincial (regional) hospitals.  \n \n7. \nTo  improve  health  care  in  the  central  highlands,  the  government  has  since  the  1990s \nmobilized  state  bonds  and  external  assistance  toward  making  substantial  investments  in \nhospital  development.14 The  government  has  developed  a  network  of  health  facilities  in  the \ncentral  highlands  region,  including  71  hospitals, 15 49  ICPs,  and  722  CHSs,  and  preventive \nmedicine facilities. The few small private hospitals and most private clinics are in urban areas.  \n \nAccess to community health care and its quality. To help address the high burden of \n8. \ndisease and mortality in villages, the Ministry of Health (MOH) supports information, education, \nand  communication  (IEC)  programs;  outreach  services;  village  health  workers  (VHWs);  and \nvillage  birth  attendants  (VBAs).  Most  villages  have  at  least  one  VHW,  male  or  female,  and  a \nVBA. VBAs are expected to attend deliveries only in remote locations, otherwise refer patients \nfor  delivery  in  the  CHS.  The  MOH  has  initiated  a  program  to  upgrade  the  skills  of  VHWs  and \nVBAs  with  a  6-month  training  program,  however,  in-service  training  and  the  supervision  of \nVHWs and VBAs need to be expanded and improved. VHWs and VBAs also lack basic supplies \nsuch as delivery kits.  \n \n9. \nCHSs are essential links in the care and referral chain from communities and hospitals, \nparticularly  for  the  poor  and  ethnic  groups.  In  the  central  highlands,  CHSs  are  underutilized: \npatients prefer to use public hospitals as first point of contact (footnote 6). The catchment areas \nof  CHSs  are  twice  as  large  as  the  national  average  because  population  density  is  low.  CHSs \nmay  be  bypassed  if  located  close  to  a  hospital.  Many  CHSs  are  small  and  in  bad  condition, \nsometimes  operating  in  one  room  or  rented  premises,  with  facilities  and  equipment  requiring \n\n                                                 \n9   United  Nations  Development  Programme.

Recognizing constraints on accessibility, efficiency, and resources, the government has added, where \nneeded, intercommunal polyclinics (ICPs), interdistrict hospitals, and interprovincial (regional) hospitals. \n\n15  Including provincial hospitals, municipal hospitals, specialized hospitals, and district health centers. \n\n \n\n2\n \n\n \n\n\fupgrade  or  replacement.  The  MOH  is  planning  to  upgrade  selected  busy  CHSs  into  ICPs  to \nimprove emergency care and relieve crowding in hospitals. This would require the provision of \nmore advanced diagnostic equipment and basic inpatient facilities.  \n \nCHS quality is perceived as poor. The quality of care in CHSs is affected by the lack of \n10. \nskilled  staff,  standard  procedures,  and  quality  assurance. 16  Only  65%  of  communes  met \nnational  quality  assurance  benchmarks  in  2010  (footnote  8).  MOH  has  issued  clinical \nstandards,  but  they  are  not  adapted  to  local  conditions  and  are  not  implemented  at  the  CHS \nlevel.17 While  most  CHSs  have  core  staff  including  a  midwife,  only  58%  have  a  doctor,  well \nbelow the national target of 80%. The MOH has tried to redress the shortage of rural doctors by \nappointing  assistant  doctors 18  and,  more  recently,  by  intensively  educating  ethnic  college \nstudents  to  improve  their  grades  and  allow  them  to  enter  the  medical  university  and  become \ndoctors.  Medical  staff  also  tends  to  disregard  poor  patients  and  often  lacks  intercultural \ncommunication skills in dealing with ethnic patients.  \n \n11. \n Access  to  hospital  services  and  their  quality.  Life-threatening  obstetric,  pediatric, \nand other emergencies demand quick access to high-quality inpatient care. A 2001 study found \ntwo-thirds of maternal deaths occurring at home.19 Major issues are late referral and the lack of \nsuitable and affordable referral services. The central highlands have 1.6 hospital beds per 1,000 \npeople, or half the 3.1 in all of Viet Nam. A typical provincial hospital in the central highlands has \na  bed  occupancy  rate  of  about  150%.  A  typical  district  hospital  has  a  bed  occupancy  rate  of \n100%.  Public  demand  for  hospital  services,  including  from  the  poor,  is  expected  to  further \nincrease with more public awareness and the improved range and quality of services, as well as \nwith  expanded  health  insurance  coverage.  Older  hospitals  are  often  small,  congested,  and \nrundown.  The  government  has  invested  in  replacing  or  upgrading  these  hospitals.  However, \nseveral new hospitals could not be completed for lack of funds and need additional investment \nin equipment and civil works, including wastewater treatment plants.20   \n \nHospitals  with  high  bed  occupancy  find  it  difficult  to  maintain  hygiene  and  infection \n12. \ncontrol.  Overcrowding  in  the  outpatient  department  contributes  to  poor  diagnostics  and \nunnecessary  admissions.  On  the  other  hand,  some  district  hospitals  are  less  busy  for  lack  of \nspecialists,  equipment,  and  supplies  for  core  services  like  emergency  surgery,  delivery,  and \nneonatal  and  infant  care.  District  hospitals  near  a  provincial  hospital  are  particularly  prone  to \nbeing bypassed or routinely referring patients to provincial hospitals. Improving district hospitals \nand referral systems will help reduce overloading at provincial hospitals.  \n \nRatios of health care human resources to population in the central highlands are close \n13. \nto  national  ratios,  but  staff  qualifications  are  much  lower.  Particularly  lacking  are  medical \nspecialists, pharmacists, senior nurses, and ethnic staff. In general, hospital staff skills need to \nbe  upgraded  more  systematically  and  sustainably  using  local  capacity.  Provincial  medical \nteaching institutions are well placed to accomplish this but they need better equipment, training \nsystems, and teaching and methodological skills.  \n\n                                                 \n16 Belgian  Technical  Cooperation.  2009.

Manila. \n\n20 As for CHSs, the catchment areas of district hospitals in the region are twice as large as the national average, but \n\ncatchment populations are too small to add hospitals. Instead, ICPs are being considered for rural hubs.     \n\n3 \n \n\n \n\n\fProvincial  health  systems  management.  In  addition  to  gaps  in  access  and  quality, \n14. \nmanagement  challenges  need  to  be  addressed  to  improve  the  effectiveness,  equity,  and \nefficiency of the provincial health system. The government has substantially increased financing \nfor  health  services,  but  health  spending  continues  to  favor  bureaucratic  criteria  over  actual \nneeds, hospital services over community health care, and investments over recurrent spending. \nDemand for high-end medical technology may further undermine future spending on basic care. \nProvincial health managers need training on health financing. Provincial governments also play \nan  important  role  in  allocating  resources  and  need  guidance  on  result-based  health  care \ninvestment.  A  new  tool  for  annual  planning  and  budgeting  has  been  introduced  to  better \ncoordinate  and  target  resources.  This  needs  to  be  disseminated  more  widely  in  the  provinces \nand  training  is  required  for  its  proper  and  effective  application.  Orienting  provincial  health \nmanagement  more  toward  results  requires  improving  the  health  management  information \nsystem,  which  is  currently  fragmented  and  offers  limited  accessibility  and  usefulness  in \ndecision-making. \n \n15. \nIn district hospitals, management support systems to help improve the quality of services \nare weak in terms of facility management, infection control and waste management, information \nmanagement,  building  and  equipment  maintenance,  procurement  and  inventory  management, \nand  financial  management.  Managers  make  insufficient  use  of  management  tools,  standards, \nand data, and lack opportunities to improve their management skills.21    \n \n16. \nFurther, a major concern in the region is the lack of information and public awareness on \nhealth issues, particularly among women, the poor, and ethnic groups. Unsafe practices such as \nchild delivery without skilled assistance and lack of hygiene at home are common. Major issues \nare the lack of IEC specially designed for women, the poor, and ethnic groups, compounded by \ndeficient  communication  skills  among  health  care  providers.  Awareness  campaigns  for  health \nthat deliver culture- and gender-sensitive messages are needed. Training should focus as well \non improving health care staff skills for culture-sensitive communication.  \n \n17. \nLessons. The earlier project, implemented from 2004 to 2011, helped improve hospital \nservices,  staff  capacity,  and  affordability  for  the  poor  in  the  central  highlands.22 It  (i)  upgraded \nand equipped one provincial hospital, two secondary medical schools, nine preventive and IEC \ncenters,  and  12  district  hospitals  and  wastewater  treatment  plants;  (ii) provided  training  for \ndoctors  and  nurses;  and  (iii)  piloted  a  health  equity  fund  for  the  poor.  The  project  completion \nreport rated the project successful and recommended (i) targeting the poor and ethnic groups, \n(ii)  focusing  on  more  local  facilities,  (iii)  improving  resource  allocation,  (iv)  improving  health \nsector  planning,  (v) ensuring  counterpart  funding  for  infrastructure,  (vi)  preparing  long-term \ntraining  plans,  (vii) improving  procurement  systems,  and  (viii)  improving  project  monitoring. 23 \nThe  proposed  project  was  designed  taking  into  consideration  these  lessons  from  the  first \nproject.  \n \nADB  strategy.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  2012\u22122015  emphasizes  support  for \n18. \ndisadvantaged  populations  to  ensure  inclusive  growth  and  thereby  increase  social  and \neconomic  benefits. 24 It  includes  support  to  health  care  in  disadvantaged  areas  to  ensure \n\n                                                 \n21 Government  of  Viet  Nam,  MOH.  2010.

ADB\u2019s  operational  plan  for  health  also  stresses  the  importance  of  achieving \nthe  MDGs  and  addressing  governance  and  financing  issues  in  the  health  sector  jointly  with \nother development partners.25 \n  \nDevelopment coordination. In addition to ADB\u2019s earlier project (footnote 22), the Japan \n19. \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  and  the  governments  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  and  Spain \nsupported  hospital  development  in  the  central  highlands.  The  European  Union  and  Atlantic \nPhilanthropies  also  supported  community  health  care.  Pathfinder  and  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands have supported the development of model CHS services. ADB and global funding \nagencies  also  support  the  control  of  HIV  and  of  neglected  and  emerging  infectious  diseases. \nCoordination  of  development  assistance  in the  central  highlands  is  undertaken  mainly  through \ndialogue between the MOH and development partners at the national level.26  \n \nB. \n \n20. \nThe impact will be improved health and nutrition in the central highlands, in particular for \nwomen, children, the poor, and ethnic groups. The outcome will be the increased use of health \nservices, in particular maternal and child health services in district hospitals, ICPs, and CHSs. \n \nC. \n \n21. \nThe  project  will  have  three  key  outputs:  (i)  improved  access  and  quality  of  community \nhealth  care,  (ii)  increased  access  and  quality  of  hospital  services,  and  (iii)  strengthened \nprovincial health system management. The project will provide support in the five provinces of \nthe  central  highlands,  in  particular  for  activities  to  improve  health  care  for  the  poor,  ethnic \ngroups, and women and children living in remote communities.  \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Improved Access and Quality of Community Health Care \n\n \n22. \nThe project will support improved community health care with a focus on maternal and \nchild  care  for  the  poor  and  ethnic  groups  in  rural  locations.  With  support  from  district  health \noffices,  at  least  20%  of  the  rural  CHSs  will  be  selected  to  work  with  surrounding  villages  to \nimprove  community  health  care  through  outreach  services,  including  health  and  nutrition \npromotion  and maternal and  child  care. 27 The  project  builds  on  and  expands  earlier  programs \nfor improving basic health care using standard packages and quality assurance mechanisms28 \nand will help improve the health system and address gaps in resources.  \n \n23. \nThe  project  will  provide  (i)  6-month  pre-service  training  for  VHWs  and  VBAs  to  ensure \nthat all villages in the catchment areas of targeted CHSs have adequate VHWs and VBAs; and            \n(ii)  refresher  courses  for  VHWs  and  VBAs  in  the  selected  provinces,  with  priority  given  to \ncatchment  areas  of  selected  CHSs  as  appropriate.  It  will  provide  toolkits  for  all  eligible  VHWs \nand delivery kits for all eligible VBAs. It will also support IEC campaigns on health and nutrition. \nPrior to these campaigns, the project will conduct a knowledge, attitudes, and practices study in \nthe  villages  and  produce  IEC  materials  appropriate  to  the  sociocultural  context  of  the  region. \nEleven  vehicles  will  be  provided  to  districts  lacking transportation  to  improve  CHS  supervision \nand outreach services.  \n                                                 \n25 ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n26 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27  Selection  criteria  will  include  (i)  poverty  incidence,  (ii)  distance  from  the  district  hospital,  (iii)  ethnic  groups \npopulation, (iv) population density, and (v) achievement of commune health standards as defined by the MOH.  \n\n28  Based on models piloted with the support of partners such as Pathfinder.    \n\n5 \n \n\n \n\n\fThe project will build and equip 24 CHSs, replace and equip 10 ICPs, upgrade and equip \n24. \n30  CHSs,  and  complete  the  equipment  of  other  selected  CHSs  and  ICPs.  It  will  support  150 \nscholarships  for  ethnic  students  in  medical  technician  or  nursing  degree  courses  and  support \nhealth quality improvement through in-service skills training for CHS and ICP staff in hospitals. \nStaff will also be trained to be aware of sociocultural barriers, in IEC skills, and caring for ethnic \npatients.  \n  \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Increased Access and Quality of Hospital Services  \n\n \n25. \nThe  project  will  support  district  hospitals  toward  improving  access  to  referral  services \nand  reducing  the  overloading  of  provincial  hospitals.  A  comprehensive  approach,  focusing  on \ndelivery  of standard  packages  of  health  services,  will  be  followed  to  improve  hospital  services \nand strengthen quality assurance. The project will help upgrade eight district hospitals, build one \nnew  district  hospital,  equip  about  27  district  hospitals  and  3  provincial  hospitals  (including  for \nemergency services), and provide 28 ambulances. It will help repair and maintain water supply \nand sanitation in all eligible district hospitals.  \n  \n26. \nTo  improve  service quality, the  project  will  support  system  development and  training  in \ninfection  control,  waste  management,  and  quality  assurance  for  selected  staff  in  all  district \nhospitals.  It  will  support  (i)  short-term  technical  skills  training  for  nurses,  laboratory  assistants, \nand  maintenance  specialists  in  all  district  hospitals;  (ii)  training  162  specialist  doctors;  (iii) \nupgrading  125  assistant  doctors  and  assistant  pharmacists  into  doctors  and  pharmacists;  and \n(iv) providing short courses for 111 specialist doctors. Priority will be given to female and ethnic \ncandidates.  \n  \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Strengthened Provincial Health System Management \n\n \n27. \nThe  project  will  help  improve  provincial  and  district  health  management  systems. \nActivities  will  include  orientation  for  provincial  governments  and  local  leaders  and  training  for \nprovincial  and  district  health  managers  and  CHS  and  ICP  heads  on  annual  planning  and \nbudgeting,  management  and  supervision  tools,  quality  assurance,  building  and  equipment \nmaintenance, and a health management information system.  \n \n28. \nCapacity  building  in  public  health  and  hospital  management  will  include  a  3-month \ncertificate  course  for  provincial  and  district  health  office  managers,  CHS  and  ICP  heads,  and \nhospital  managers  in  health  services  management.  This  will  include  human  resources \nmanagement,  financial  management,  quality  assurance,  and  health  management  information \nsystem,  and  mainstreaming  gender  and  ethnic  concerns.  Female  and  ethnic  staff  will  be \nprioritized.  To  improve  training  outcomes,  the  project  will  support  the  development  of  an  in-\nservice  training  system,  including  a  provincial  training  team  and  coordinator,  a  core  group  of \nteachers  to  improve  teaching  methodologies,  distant  learning  materials,  a  database  to  identify \nstaff training needs, and field assessment.   \n \n29. \nThe  project  will  have  a  central  project  management  unit  (CPMU)  and  five  provincial \nproject  management  units  (PPMU).  Staff  will  be  trained  in  planning,  monitoring,  procurement, \ndisbursement,  and  financial  management.  A  project  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  will  be \nestablished.  Project  activities  will  be  included  in  the  annual  operational  plans  of  provinces, \nwhich will contribute to the sustainability of project benefits. The project will provide one vehicle \nfor supervision by CPMU.  \n \n \n\n \n\n6\n \n\n \n\n\fInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nD. \n \n30. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $76.6 million (Table 1).   \n\n  \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\nImproved access and quality of community health care \nIncreased access and quality of hospital services   \n\n \nBase Costb \n1. \n2. \n3.

ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the MOH. \nSpecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote \n31). \n \nD. \n \n36.  \nThe targeted provinces have a high proportion of poor, who have limited access to and \nuse  of  health  services,  have  less  healthy  living  conditions,  and  have  limited  information  on \nimproving  their  health.  The  project  will  increase  access  to  and  the  demand  for  good  quality \nhealth  services  at  both  the  community  and  district  levels.  This  will  help  improve  the  health  of \npeople in the central highlands, particularly of the poor and members of ethnic groups. In turn, \nthis will improve their labor productivity and reduce health expenditures.33  \n \nE. \n \n37.  \nThe  project  is  classified  under  category  I  (gender  equity  as  a  theme)  under  the \nguidelines for gender mainstreaming  categories for  ADB  projects.34 Key  gender  impacts  of the \nproject  include  (i)  new  and  upgraded  medical  facilities  and  equipment  that  prioritize  and \nstrengthen the capacity of health services to respond to women\u2019s needs; (ii) increased skills of \nfemale health staff and managers at all levels; (iii) the institutionalization of gender-responsive \nand  patient-focused  approaches  to  providing  health  care;  and  (iv)  increased  understanding \namong women and their families of the importance of accessing health care. The gender action \nplan aligns with national and sector-specific gender equality commitments.35  \n \nF. \n \n38. \nEnvironment (category B). Mainly beneficial impacts are expected from the project, as \nit  will  support  the  construction,  rehabilitation,  and  operation  of  health  facilities,  including \nimproved  water,  sanitation,  and  waste  management  systems.  However,  the  construction  of \nhospitals will cause disturbances, such as dust and noise. An initial environmental examination \nincluding an environment management plan has been prepared.36  \n  \n39.    Resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  will  not  involve  any  resettlement.  Most \nconstruction  will  take  place  in  the  existing  compounds  of  health  facilities.  For  new  locations, \ngovernment land has been made available without affecting any households.  \n \n40.  \nIndigenous peoples (category B). The project has among its beneficiaries a significant \nproportion  of  ethnic  groups  who  are  among  some  of  the  poorest  and  most  marginalized \nhouseholds  in  Viet  Nam. The  indigenous  peoples  plan  ensures that  ethnic  peoples\u2019  needs  will \nbe  analyzed  and  that  they  will  participate  in  the  project  and  have  access  to  its  benefits.37 The \nindigenous peoples plan has been disclosed on the ADB website. \n \n \n                                                 \n33 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34  ADB. 2012.
