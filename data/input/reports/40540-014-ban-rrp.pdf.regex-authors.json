I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan  and  (ii)  proposed  administration  of  a  loan  to  be  provided  by  the  OPEC  Fund  for \nInternational Development (OFID), both to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the South \nAsia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Road Connectivity Project.1 The report also \ndescribes proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) for the Institutional Development \nof the Roads and Highways Department, and if the Board approves the proposed loan and \nadministration of loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve \nthe TA. \n \n2.  The  project  will,  together  with  parallel  cofinancing,  support  the  Government  of \nBangladesh to upgrade about 70 kilometers (km) of the Dhaka\u2013Northwest corridor to four lanes \n(Joydeypur\u2013Chandra\u2013Tangail\u2013Elenga Road, which is part of a major subregional artery). The \nproject will also (i) improve two land ports at Benapole and Burimari, and (ii) strengthen the \ncapacity of the road sector and the land port operations. By increasing the road capacity of a \nmajor international trade corridor and enhancing land port capacity, the project will not only \nboost the national economy but also facilitate subregional cooperation and increase trade.2 The \nproject has been endorsed by the SASEC trade facilitation and transport working group meeting \nheld in Kolkata on 5 March 2012. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The  South  Asian  Association  for  Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC)  Summit  in  2010 \nrecognized  the  importance  of  transport  connectivity,  especially  for  landlocked  countries. \nAgreements between Bangladesh and India in 2010 for regional connectivity were a critical \nstepping stone for opening connectivity, not only between the two countries but also with Bhutan \nand Nepal, in diversifying international transport routes. This trend is expected to enhance \nsubregional markets and opportunities in South Asia, leading to balanced regional growth and \npoverty reduction.  \n \n4.  Bangladesh has the potential to become a transport and transshipment center for the \nsubregion. It borders India and Myanmar and is close to the landlocked countries of Bhutan and \nNepal,  and  Kunming\u2014the  southwestern  hub  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  With  the \nBhangabandhu Bridge over River Jamuna (the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge) and the provision \nof access to ports (i.e., Chittagong and Mongla), the Northwest\u2013Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor can \nfacilitate trade between Bangladesh and the northeastern states of India, the Indian state of \nWest Bengal, Bhutan, and Nepal and thereby have the potential to attract more foreign and \ndomestic investment to the country. Bangladesh has major international trade corridors, as \nidentified in the SAARC Regional Multimodal Transport Study3 and the Asian Highway Network. \nA study estimates that the improvement of priority regional transport corridors in Bangladesh \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2008. Technical \nAssistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Preparing the Priority Roads Project. Manila; ADB. 2009. \nTechnical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Port and Logistics Efficiency Improvement. \nManila; ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Regional Transport Development in South Asia. Manila. \n3  SAARC  Secretariat.  2007.  Regional  Multimodal  Transport  Study.  Kathmandu.  Prepared  under  ADB.  2004. \nTechnical Assistance for Promoting South Asian Regional Economic Cooperation. Manila (TA 6187-REG). Among \nSAARC priority corridors, Bangladesh has six out of 10 road corridors, two out of five rail corridors, and two \nprincipal ports (Chittagong and Mongla) for SAARC trade. ", "2 \ncould facilitate the movement of about 18 million tons of freight in Bhutan, India, and Nepal.4 A \nstudy shows that the impact of raising South Asia\u2019s trade facilitation performance to international \nlevels would result in large gains, i.e., intra-regional trade within South Asia would increase by \nalmost 60% and trade with the rest of the world would increase by over 30%.5  \n \n5.  Throughout  South  Asia,  trucks  carry  a  substantial  majority  of  inland  freight.  Road \ntransport is central to the competitiveness of supply chains. An expansion in rail freight is both \ndesirable and possible, but the absolute importance of road transport is unlikely to diminish, \nespecially as the markets for higher value and higher volume goods increase with per capita \nincomes.6 Therefore, among these international trade corridors, the highest priority is SAARC \nHighway Corridors (SHCs) 4 and 8, which provide Bhutan and Nepal with access to Bangladesh \nports (Chittagong and Mongla), including land ports. For trade between Bangladesh and India, \nBenapole Land Port is the priority to be improved as it is the busiest crossing, providing \ntransshipment services for about 80% of the annual trade between Bangladesh and India. \n \n6.  The road network in Bangladesh is very poor in terms of capacity and conditions, and \nthe  demand  for  road  transport  is  rapidly  increasing.  Inefficient  implementation  of  road \nmaintenance has increased both the number of roads that are beyond maintainable condition \nand the backlog of deferred maintenance. A mix of motorized and nonmotorized traffic, and \nencroachment onto roads, results in higher accident rates. To address these constraints, the \ngovernment  has  been  implementing  the  Road  Master  Plan,  2007\u20132026.  The  road  sector \ndevelopment  strategy  under  Bangladesh\u2019s  6th  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015  highlights  the \nimprovement of connectivity by upgrading the Asian Highway Network to four lanes to boost \ntrade and commerce, with emphasis on three arterial corridors: Dhaka\u2013Chittagong, Dhaka\u2013\nNorthwest, and Khulna\u2013Northwest. The road sector strategy in the 6th Five-Year Plan includes \ninstitutional  changes  and  capacity  development  in  maintaining  the  existing  road  network, \naddressing road safety issues, improving land port connectivity, and controlling overload. \n \n7.  ADB financed the Road Network Improvement and Maintenance Project II7 and, together \nwith the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom (DFID) and the World \nBank, has suggested a reform agenda for road in Bangladesh covering (i) a long-term and \nintegrated transport policy, (ii) modernization of road sector institutions, (iii) road maintenance \nfinancing, and (iv) private sector participation. The national land transport policy (supported by \nDFID) and the road master plan (supported by ADB) have been approved in 2004 and 2009, \nrespectively. The Ministry of Communications and the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) \nhave been restructured for focused operations. RHD, supported by DFID, has computerized its \nfinancial management and asset management systems. The central management system is \nbeing used in RHD divisions, resulting in expeditious and transparent payment processing, e.g., \nthe backlog of major unpaid contracts has been eliminated. The procurement capacity is being \nstrengthened under the World Bank\u2019s Public Procurement Reform II Project, utilizing the central \nmanagement system and introducing e-procurement. Maintenance financing has substantially \nincreased\u2014the  latest  approved  budget  for  FY2013  demonstrated  the  government\u2019s  policy \nemphasis on maintenance and rationalization of development work (i.e., increased by 37% from \nFY2012). A public\u2013private partnership (PPP) unit was established in RHD and pilot PPP road \n                                                 \n4  ADB.

The overall productivity of RHD has improved.8 The project will \ncontinue to support the reform agenda as agreed in the institutional development action plan9 \nand the maintenance financing strategy.10 \n \n8.  The Bangladesh Land Port Authority (BLPA) administers 16 land ports. It is a lean \norganization and financially self-sustained for the current level of operational efficiency and \nvolumes, mainly by outsourcing development and operations to the private sector. However, \ntaking into account the expected increase in trade among SASEC countries through land ports, \nit is urgently required to improve facilities to realize operational efficiency. \n \n9.  The project road is the common section of SHCs 4 and 8, and Asian Highway 2, carrying \nabout 15,000 vehicles per day, excluding two- and three-wheelers, making it the second busiest \nartery  in  Bangladesh  after  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  road.  However,  this  road  section  has \nsubstantial bottlenecks because of limited capacity, pavement deterioration, and mixed traffic of \nslow-moving vehicles, resulting in many traffic accidents in accident-prone areas. Burimari Land \nPort is a northwestern end point of the Dhaka\u2013Northwest corridor, providing a gateway to \nBhutan through India via SHC 8. Benapole Land Port is the busiest land port at the west end \npoint of the Asian Highway 1 and SHC 1 in Bangladesh. Burimari and Benapole land ports are \ncomplemented by India\u2019s Integrated Customs Posts Program at Changrabandha and Petrapole.  \n \n10.  In parallel with the project, ADB is preparing (i) a SASEC Road Connectivity Project to \nimprove two priority subregional roads in India11 and develop land customs stations; and (ii) a \nSASEC Trade Facilitation Program to strengthen the soft side of customs and cross-border \ntransport.  For  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor,  the  government  will  undertake  capacity \nexpansion  projects,  e.g.,  four-laning,  bridge  expansion  by  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency (JICA), railway doubling by ADB and JICA, and a possible expressway using PPP with \nADB support. ADB provided support to Chittagong Port efficiency improvement.12 ADB\u2019s Dhaka \nUrban  Transport  Project13 and  other  government  projects  such  as  the  Dhaka  expressway \nproject will also help reduce the bottleneck in Dhaka. The proposed project, therefore, is part of \nthe critical development of physical infrastructure for connectivity in South Asia. \n \n11.  The project has been designed in coordination with JICA to ensure development synergy. \nThe project takes into account lessons from past projects,14 mainly start-up delays, delayed \nrelease of the counterpart funds, and limited capacity of contractors.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The  impact  will  be  increased  domestic  and  regional  trade  through  Bangladesh.  The \noutcome will be the improvement to road connectivity and efficiency of the Dhaka\u2013Northwest \n                                                 \n8  Total kilometers completed under the development and maintenance budget per engineer have increased from \n4.5 km/engineer in 2004 to 7.9 in 2010.  \n9  Institutional Development Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 Maintenance Financing Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 Kakarvitta\u2013Panitanki\u2013Fulbari\u2013Banglabandha  road  (40  km)  for  Nepal\u2013India\u2013Bangladesh  connectivity  (Asian \nHighway 2 and SHC 4); and (ii) Phuentsholing\u2013Jaigaon\u2013Hasimara\u2013Changrabandha\u2013Burimari road (120 km) for \nBhutan\u2013India\u2013Bangladesh connectivity (SHC 8). \n12 ADB. 2004.

The government will upgrade about 70 km of the Joydeypur\u2013\nChandra\u2013Tangail\u2013Elenga Road, which is part of Asian Highway 2 and SHC 4 and 8, to a four-\nlane  highway  with  safety  features  including  a  separate  lane  for  slow-moving  traffic  and \nconstruction of flyovers at the busiest junctions. Civil works will be financed by ADB jointly with \nOFID for about 60 km and in parallel by the Abu Dhabi Fund for International Development \n(ADFD) for about 10 km. The project implementation consultant (PIC) will be financed by ADB \nto support implementation of the entire 70 km road works. \n \n14.  Roads and Highways Department (RHD) institutional development. The project will \nmodernize RHD headquarters and provide equipment and consulting services in line with the \ninstitutional development action plan. A technical assistance grant attached to the project for \ninstitutional development in RHD will be provided to support implementation of the action plan \n(para. 21). The TA consultants will identify the timing and details of equipment and services to \nbe procured under the loan. Equipment to be procured will include weighbridges and laboratory \nequipment. \n \n15.  Land  port  improvement. The project will improve two land ports at Benapole and \nBurimari. For Benapole Land Port, which has a larger master plan comprising several modules, \nthe project will focus on those that will cater for the increasing trade volumes: (i) redevelopment \nof old sheds including road access and drainage; (ii) redevelopment of the old truck terminal \nyard, and (iii) construction of shelter in the transshipment area. For Burimari Land Port, the \nproject will focus on more effective reconfiguration of traffic flows, and provision of covered \nshipment yards for perishable goods. The PIC will undertake detailed design, procurement \nassistance, construction supervision, and capacity development for operational efficiency. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n16.  The outputs under the project and the parallel financing are estimated together to cost \n$344.7 million (Table 1). The detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier \nare in the project administration manual.15 \n \n17.  The government has requested a loan (the ADB Loan) in various currencies equivalent \nto SDR128,114,000 ($198 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources16 to help \nfinance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an \ninterest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.17 OFID will \nprovide a loan of $30 million to help finance the project (the OFID Loan). Administered by ADB \non a partial administration basis,18 the OFID loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, and an annual interest rate of 2.25% (inclusive of a 1.0% service charge). The \nOFID loan will partially finance the works. The government has also requested cofinancing (the \nADFD Loan) of $30 million from ADFD, which has provided firm commitments for parallel \ncofinancing, with its board approval expected in December 2012. The ADFD Loan will have a \n                                                 \n15 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Inclusive of $40 million equivalent from the subregional pool of the Asian Development Fund. \n17 Loan Agreement; Project Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Partial services by ADB limited to procurement and disbursement supervision. \n ", "5 \n20-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2%. The ADFD Loan will \npartially finance the works and the contingencies. In the event that cofinancing from OFID is not \nsigned within 6 months following the effectiveness of the ADB loan, the government will take all \nnecessary and appropriate steps to make available all counterpart funds required for timely and \neffective completion of the project whether through budget allocations or other arrangements \nacceptable to ADB. In the absence of which, the government and ADB will scale down the \nscope of the project and if applicable to adjust the relevant financing arrangement. In the event \nthat the cofinancing from ADFD is not signed within 6 months following the effectiveness of the \nADB loan, the government and ADB will discuss what steps are to be taken. \n \nTable 1: Investment Plan \nItem     Amount ($ million) \nA.

Climate \n                                                 \n19 Technical Assistance: Institutional Development of the Roads and Highways Department (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nresilient design standards20 will be adopted following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Climate Proofing \nInvestment in the Transport Sector: Road Infrastructure Projects.21 A specific climate change \nstudy was carried out to be reflected in the final design (e.g., embankment level, bridge height, \nand drainage structures). Tolling has been discussed but not yet imposed because of the \nunavailability of alternate roads.22 The possibility of tolling will be further explored during project \nimplementation with support of the TA consultant. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  The  project  is  expected  to  (i)  facilitate  economic  development  of  northwestern \nBangladesh and subregional trade with Bhutan, India, and Nepal while reducing road accidents; \nand (ii) improve the transaction efficiency at the land ports to facilitate increased import and \nexport  trade  and  reduce  damage  to  goods  through  warehousing  facilities.  The  project  is \neconomically viable, with economic internal rates of return of 27.2% for the road and 32.8% for \nthe  land  ports.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  the  project\u2019s  economic  viability  would  remain \nsatisfactory even under several adverse scenarios. Incremental recurrent costs associated with \nthe road are estimated at about 5% of the current RHD maintenance budget and less than 1.5% \nof the overall RHD budget on an annual basis, which will be required after project completion on \n2016. The government has assured that the road network will be maintained and reduced the \nbacklog maintenance in line with the maintenance financing strategy.  \n \n24.  The financial analysis in real terms indicates a financial internal rate of return of 5.1% for \nthe land port improvement. The project is financially viable based on the estimated weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  of  1.9%.  The  sensitivity  analysis  indicates that  even  with  adverse \nvariations in costs and benefits, the project remains financially viable. Improved port facilities, \ninvestment  in  subregional  connectivity,  and  changes  in  government  policies  to  facilitate \nsubregional  trade  are  likely  to  achieve  higher  growth  than  the  medium-growth  scenario \nassumed in this analysis and thus have the potential to generate more surplus in the long term. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  Institutional  and  financial  management.  RHD  has  the  experience  and  sufficient \ncapacity to implement externally funded projects. BLPA is new to externally funded projects. \nThe  consultant  will  support  both  RHD  and  BLPA.  On  financial  management,  RHD  has \nexperience of ADB disbursement procedures while BLPA does not. The project will also provide \nsupport to BLPA for training in ADB procedures and for computerization and training in financial \nmanagement  systems.  One  accountant  will  be  assigned  to  each  project  manager.  All \nrecommendations of ADB as to financial management assessment (such as computerization of \nthe  systems  (including  fixed  asset  register),  strengthening  internal  control  mechanism  and \nexpediting external audit, and monitoring the mechanism of budget and actual expenditure for \nbetter budgeting and control) will be implemented during the project. \n \n26.  Procurement  and  anticorruption. Recruitment of consultants will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime),  with  ADB  selecting  and  the  executing  agencies  negotiating  and  signing  (para.  20). \nNational procurement regulation has also improved through the Public Procurement Act, 2006 \nand the related Public Procurement Rules, 2008 (with subsequent amendments). The World \nBank also supports capacity development in procurement under the Public Procurement Reform \n                                                 \n20 Summary of Design Standards (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21  ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n22 Tolling Opportunities (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nProject II to enhance transparency and streamline the procurement process. Contracts financed \njointly by ADB and OFID will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from \ntime to time) and use bidding documents that are in line with ADB\u2019s policies and will include a \npolicy  statement  on  avoiding  corrupt  practices.  Bidding  packages  procured  using  national \ncompetitive  bidding  will  follow  the  government\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Act  and  Public \nProcurement Rules, with modifications agreed between the government and ADB, as set out in \nthe procurement plan. RHD and BLPA will publish on their websites (i) procurement information \nrelating to the project, including business opportunities; and (ii) the track record of project \nimplementation. To enhance good governance in connection with the ADB and OFID loans, \n(i) design consultants under the ADB TA loan will provide procurement assistance;23 (ii) RHD \nand BLPA will involve in their procurement processes a procurement advisor to be engaged by \nADB;24 (iii) ADB will monitor procurement activities on a regular basis; and (iv) the consultant \nunder the TA grant associated with the project will undertake a procurement review of the \nproject.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government and executing agencies. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are in the project administration manual (footnote 15). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n27.  The project road passes through two districts where an estimated 6.9 million people \nreside. The social and poverty analysis found that project-affected persons were in favor of the \nproject and believed the road will contribute to regional economic and social development by \nproviding better and uninterrupted transport to and from commercial centers. Immediate benefits \ninclude employment generation in construction and associated activities. Long-term benefits \ninclude reduced transport costs and increased mobility, increased scope for higher education, \ndiversification in agriculture for access to wider markets, lower prices of farm and commercial \ninputs and less spoilage of agricultural produce, and improved access to specialized medical \nservices.  The  land  ports  are  located  in  Benapole  (49,000  population)  and  Burimari \n(25,000 population). The project will increase the efficiency of transshipment practices and \npotentially contribute to increased revenue of the land ports and a growing demand for local \ncommercial services, leading to an improved economic situation of the surrounding area. \n \n28.  Gender. Women will be encouraged to participate in civil works for the road component \nduring  the  construction  phase.  RHD  will  aim  to  employ  women  for  50%  of  labor  (about \n350 person-years)  for  road  maintenance.  For  the  RHD  building,  the  RHD  Gender  and \nDevelopment  Forum  will  be  involved  in  the  design  to  ensure  a  gender-friendly  working \nenvironment. \n \n29.  Sexually  transmitted  infections  and  human  trafficking.  Bangladesh  is  a  low-\nprevalence country for HIV/AIDS, with the incidence rate estimated to be less than 0.1% among \nthe general population. The 3rd National Strategic Plan for HIV and AIDS Response (2011\u2013\n2015) 25  formulated  by  the  National  AIDS/STD  Programme  continues  to  build  on  the \nachievements of the previous plans. A survey conducted in the project-affected area revealed \nthat  96%  of  households  are  aware  of  HIV/AIDS.  RHD  and  BLPA  will  conduct  awareness \nprograms for workers on the health risks of sexually transmitted diseases and the detrimental \nsocial and health impacts on women and children by disseminating information at worksites. \n                                                 \n23  ADB. 2010.

Within the land port compound, \nawareness posters will be posted in areas frequented by truck drivers and day laborers. In \nproject-affected communities, awareness programs will be conducted semiannually for men and \nwomen in separate groups to address specific needs from each group. \n  \nE.  Safeguards  \n \n30.  Environmental impact. Environment-related activities include enhancement of hygienic \nconditions in the land ports, construction of an environment-friendly office building for RHD, and \nexpansion of the Joydeypur\u2013Chandra\u2013Tangail\u2013Elenga Road. All three components fall under \nenvironment category B. Environmental impacts in the land ports and RHD office building are \nlargely positive and include establishment of structures and mechanisms for managing waste, \ndrainage, and occupational health and safety. Negative impacts related to construction waste; \nair, noise, and water pollution; occupational health and safety; tree removal; and erosion are \nexpected for all project components. However, these are mainly confined to the construction \nperiod and mitigation measures have been proposed in the environmental management plan, \nwhich will be included in the agreement with the contractor. Initial environmental examination \n(IEE) reports have been prepared for each component and are disclosed on the ADB website as \nrequired by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Local communities were consulted while \npreparing the IEE reports. Details of consultations, feedback received, and grievance redress \nmechanisms are included in the IEE reports.  \n \n31.  While RHD has a social and environmental unit to address safeguard concerns, the \nBLPA  does  not  have  such  a  unit.  Safeguard  focal  persons  will  be  appointed  in  BLPA \nheadquarters  and  at  sites.  They  will  be  supported  by  the  PIC\u2019s  environmental  specialist. \nSafeguard training workshops will be conducted during pre-construction and construction, as \nnecessary.  Capacity  development  for  BLPA  will  also  be  provided  under  the  loan.  Annual \nenvironmental monitoring reports will be submitted by the respective executing agencies to ADB. \n \n32.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project is classified under \nresettlement  category  A.  Two  resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  based  on  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  and  the  Acquisition  and  Requisition  of  Immovable  Property \nOrdinance  II  of  Bangladesh,  1982.  Affected  communities  were  extensively  consulted  to \nunderstand their views. The impact will be significant, with about 18.9 hectares of land acquired, \nwith commercial tenants experiencing the main impact. The project will affect 2,394 households \n(9,885 persons). The resettlement plans will be updated based on detailed design and will be \nimplemented by an experienced nongovernment organization, with the PIC providing external \nmonitoring. For the RHD institutional development component, 11 non-titleholder households \n(38  persons)  will  be  affected.  RHD  has  over  18  years  of  experience  in  managing  social \nsafeguard risks, including in projects funded by development partners. The land port component \nwill not require land acquisition and resettlement. The project will comply with ADB\u2019s information \ndisclosure requirements. No impact on indigenous people is envisaged.   \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n33.  Key risks are delays in implementation (Table 4). Other risks and mitigating measures \nare summarized in the risk assessment and risk management plan.26 Integrated benefits and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh costs. \n                                                 \n26  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan; Operational Risks and Measures (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2).  \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nGovernance  Procurement risks are mitigated by several measures as provided in para. 26. \nProject  The start-up delay has substantially reduced by 2 years, i.e., the design to be completed by 2012. \nimplementation  Recruitment of nongovernment organizations for supporting land acquisition and resettlement \ndelay  activities will be initiated immediately after loan negotiations. Contract packaging was made large \nenough to attract qualified contractors. \nSafeguard  Land acquisition, social, and environmental impacts have been minimized through engineering \ncompliance  and institutional measures. Works contracts will be awarded only after completing safeguard \nrequirements. Before construction, a due diligence mission will be fielded to create awareness \namong the project authorities about ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \nInstitutional  The institutional development action plan has been agreed with ADB and is built on ongoing \ndevelopment  government efforts. A financier\u2019s committee is set up with a major development partner in the \nactions delay  road sector (JICA) to monitor the progress closely. JICA has provided an in-house advisor to \nRHD  to  provide  hands-on  support  in  implementing  the  action  plan,  especially  on  bridge \nmanagement. \nJICA = Japan International Cooperation Agency, RHD = Roads and Highways Department. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES  \n \n34.  The government and BLPA have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. The government and BLPA have \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan and project \nagreements. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove: \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR128,114,000 to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of Bangladesh for the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation \nRoad Connectivity Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest \ncharge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the  administration  by  ADB  of  the  loan  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$30,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  South  Asia \nSubregional Economic Cooperation Road Connectivity Project, to be provided by \nthe OPEC Fund for International Development. \n \n \nBindu N.
