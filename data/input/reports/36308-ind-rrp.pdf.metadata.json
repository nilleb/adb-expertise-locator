The  environmental  implications  were  reviewed  and  no \nadverse impact was identified. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement \nImpact on indigenous people \n \nNo involuntary resettlement or adverse impact on indigenous people \nis expected from program implementation. \n \nThis is the second subprogram of the Assam Governance and Public \nResource  Management  Sector  Development  Program  (AGPRM). \nSubprogram  I  of  the  AGPRM  was  successfully  implemented  by  the \ngovernment of Assam from 2005 to 2007. Subprogram II consists of \na  loan  of  $100  million,  to  be  implemented  over  3  years,  and  a \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  grant  of  $600,000,  for  capacity  building \nand for supporting program implementation. \n \nIn the 1990s, the government of Assam faced fiscal and governance-\nrelated  structural  problems.  Its  weak  fiscal  position  was  due  to \nstagnation  of  tax  and  nontax  revenue  and  growing  recurrent \nexpenditure.  The  government  also  suffered  from  rising  expenditure, \npension liabilities, and fiscal drain caused by large subsidies to loss-\nmaking public sector enterprises (PSEs).  \n \nUnder subprogram I of the AGPRM, however, various reforms were \nundertaken by the government of Assam to improve governance and \nbetter  manage  available  resources.  Through  fiscal  reforms,  which \ninclude approval of a medium-term fiscal plan and introduction of the \nFiscal  Responsibility  and  Budgetary  Management  Act,  the  profile  of \nfiscal imbalances has been improved and a large revenue deficit has \nbeen  converted  into  a  surplus  in  recent  years.  This  was  achieved \nthrough  a  combination  of  revenue  augmentation,  a  reduction  in \nrevenue losses, and closer monitoring and control of expenditure.  \n \nIn  accordance  with  the  AGPRM  and  following  the  reforms  under \nsubprogram I, subprogram II is targeted at (i) strengthening revenue \nadministration  through  capacity  development  and  implementation  of \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nProgram Period \nand Tranching \n\n \n\nin \n\nthrough \n\nthe  state \n\nthe  gradual \n\nthrough  better \n\nfiscal  resources \n\ninformation  and  communication  technology  systems,  (ii)  improving \nexpenditure  management \nintroduction  of \noutcome-based  budgeting  and  improvements  in  operation  and \nmaintenance  expenditure  estimating,  (iii)  developing  a  centralized \ndebt  management  system  to  include  contingent  liabilities,  and  (iv) \nundertaking  further  PSE  closures  and  related  compensation  and \nlabor  rehabilitation.  Reforms  under  subprogram  II  will  allow  greater \nfiscal  space,  thus  enabling  the  government  of  Assam  to  allocate \nto  much-needed  social  and  economic \nmore \ninfrastructure.  This  will,  in  turn,  promote  private  sector  investment, \nthus leading to income generation and higher employment.  \n \nThe  impact  of  subprogram  II  is  to  achieve  improved  financial \nflexibility for the government of Assam so it is able to more actively \npromote social and physical infrastructure development and improve \neconomic  growth  performance.  This  will  lead  to  a  reduction  in \nfiscal  management  and \npoverty \ngovernance.  The  outcomes  of  subprogram  II  are  (i)  increased  tax \nbuoyancy  via  strengthened  revenue  administration;  (ii)  expenditure \nreoriented  to  allow  for  greater  allocation  for  investments  in,  and \nmaintenance  of,  assets;  (iii)  more  efficient  debt  servicing  through \nimproved  debt  management  policy  and  procedures  and  a \nstrengthened debt management unit; and (iv) accelerated closure of \nPSEs  and  implementation  of  related  compensation  and  labor \nrehabilitation. \n \nA loan of $100 million equivalent from the ordinary capital resources \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided under ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  The \nloan will have a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 years, an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \nThe  Government  of  India  will  relend  the  local  currency  generated \nfrom  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  to  the  government  of  Assam.  The \nrelending will be in accordance with the Government\u2019s arrangement \nfor transfer of external assistance to the government of Assam and it \nwill  be  treated  as  additional  to  the  central  government  transfers \nallocated annually to the state of Assam.  \n \nSubprogram  II  is  estimated  to  be  completed  by  September  2011. \nThe loan will be released in three tranches: (i) $40 million for the first \ntranche,  (ii)  $40  million  for  the  second  tranche,  and  (iii)  $20  million \nfor  the  third  tranche.  The  first  tranche  will  be  released  upon \nfulfillment  of  all  agreed  conditions  for  the  first  tranche  and  following \neffectiveness of the loan. The second tranche will be released upon \nfulfillment of all agreed conditions for the second tranche, estimated \nto be within 12 months of the first tranche release. The third tranche \nwill be released upon fulfillment of all agreed conditions for the third \n\n\f \n\niii\n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\n \nProgram Benefits  \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\ntranche,  estimated  to  be  within  18  months  of  the  second  tranche \nrelease.   \n \nThe  executing  agency  for  subprogram  II  will  be  the  Finance \nDepartment of the government of Assam.  \n \nA  program  steering  committee  will  be  responsible  for  overall \ncoordination,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  subprogram  II.  The \ncommittee, to be chaired by a senior official not below the rank of the \nprincipal  secretary  of  the  government  of  Assam,  will  include  all \nsecretaries of participating departments.  \n \nThe  fiscal  management  unit  in  the  Finance  Department  established \nunder  subprogram  I  will  continue  to  undertake  fiscal  management \nreforms and be responsible for daily implementation of subprogram II \nunder  the  guidance  of  the  program  steering  committee.  The  fiscal \nmanagement unit will coordinate with ADB and various stakeholders \nand  will  solicit  feedback  from  experts  from  within  and  outside  the \ngovernment of Assam on a regular basis.  \n \nThe proceeds of the program loan will be used to finance the foreign \nexchange costs (excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced \nin  and  procured  from  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible \nitems  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral \nsources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of \nDisbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program \nLoans (1998), the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to \nthe Borrower.  \n \nThe  benefits  of  subprogram  II  are  expected  to  be  evident  in  the \nfollowing: (i) the availability of more resources to invest in social and \neconomic  infrastructure  which  should  ultimately  assist  in  enhancing \nthe  welfare  of  the  poor  in  the  rural  hinterlands,  (ii)  more  efficient \nallocation  of  budget  resources  based  on  outcomes  sought  rather \nthan on an input-based system, and (iii) the ability of the government \nof  Assam,  in  the  long  term,  to  place  its  fiscal  affairs  on  a  sounder \nfooting  that  can  sustain  investments  for  more  rapid  and  inclusive \ngrowth.  \n \nThe  success  of  subprogram  II  depends  on  the  government  of \nAssam\u2019s  continuing  strong  commitment  to  fiscal  reforms  and  to  the \nbroader  governance  issues  of  transparency  in  fiscal  matters. \nHowever,  the  possibility  remains  that  current  measures  and  reform \nefforts, \nimplementing \ngovernment agencies to carry out the reforms, may not be sustained. \nThese risks will be mitigated by (i) continued policy dialogue with the \ngovernment  of  Assam  and  other  stakeholders  in  Assam  (such  as \nbusiness  associations),  and  (ii)  specific  technical  assistance  and \ncapacity-development  support  and  follow-up  aimed  at  the  weak \nimplementing  agencies.  For  its  part,  the  government  of  Assam  has \npublicly  and  officially  (i.e.,  in  the  budget  speech)  expressed  its \n\ninsufficient  capacity \n\nin  specific \n\nincluding \n\n \n\n\fin \n\ninherent \n\nin  subprogram \n\nlevel  of  engagement \n\ncommitment to pursue the reforms sought under subprogram II, and \nthe \nthe  program  design  has  been \nsubstantive. \n \nthe \nThe  assumptions \ngovernment  of  Assam  commitment  to  reforms  across  the  various \nsectors  (including  PSEs)  will  remain  high  during  the  program \nimplementation period, (ii) existing central policies that are favorable \nto  the  government  of  Assam  will  continue  to  be  in  place  in  the \nmedium  to  long  term,  (iii)  the  greater  fiscal  space  will  result  in \nreorientation  of  expenditure  into  social  and  economic  infrastructure, \nand  (iv)  any  political  developments  that  take  place  in  the  short-to-\nin  any \nterm  do  not  adversely  affect  subprogram \nmedium \nsubstantive manner.  \n \n\nthat  (i) \n\nII  are \n\nII \n\n \nTechnical Assistance  The TA will support the key government of Assam agencies that are \nimplementing  subprogram  II.  The  TA  will  also  mitigate  the  risks \nassociated  with \nthese  agencies.  The \nestimated cost of the TA program is $750,000, of which $600,000 will \nbe a grant from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government \nof  Japan,  and  $150,000  will  be  provided  by  the  government  of \nAssam  as  in-kind  support.  Consultants  for  the  TA  will  be  recruited \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). \n\ninsufficient  capacity \n\nin \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  India  for  the  second  subprogram  (subprogram  II)  of  the  Assam  Governance  and  Public \nResource  Management  Sector  Development  Program  (AGPRM).  The  report  also  describes \nproposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  supporting  subprogram  II  of  the  AGPRM.  If  the  Board \napproves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will \napprove the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\n \n2. \nRecent  Economic  Performance  in  India.  The  Indian  economy  continues  to  show \nimpressive growth with strong macroeconomic fundamentals. Since January 2005 the economy \nhas  recorded  a  growth  rate  of  over  8%  in  12  successive  quarters  up  to  the  end  of  December \n2007.  According  to  latest  estimates,  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  at  8.7%  during \nFY2007. Average annual growth achieved during the Tenth Five-Year Plan period (2002\u20132007) \nwas 7.8%, the highest ever in any plan period. With respect to fiscal management, the tax\u2013GDP \nratio increased from 9.2% in FY2003 to 12.4% in FY2007. The Government of India continued \nprogress in terms of reduction of revenue deficit and fiscal deficit, and increase in the outlays for \nseveral  social  sector  and  infrastructure  development  programs.  However,  the  inflation  rate  in \nmid-2008  has  crossed  to  11%  and  the  Indian  economy  is  showing  signs  of  slowing,  and  this \nmay  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  collection  of  revenue  at  the  central  government  level. \nPoverty  reduction  and  social  development  through  inclusive  growth  is  the  central  goal  of  the \n11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2007\u20132012),  which  rightly  recognizes  that  the  growth  process  cannot  be \nsustained or made more inclusive without the supporting physical and social infrastructure. \n \nDevelopment in Assam. Assam is the largest of the seven states in northeastern India.1 \n3. \nIt  has  2.5%  (or  26.7  million)  of  India\u2019s  population  spread  over  2.4%  of  the  country\u2019s  area. \nAssam\u2019s  development  is  of  particular  significance  as  a  gateway  for  development  of  the \nnortheast  given  both  its  relative  size  and  its  position  as  a  center  of  interstate  trade  and \nintegrated \nfeatures  have  historically \nthe  northeast.  Several  structural \nconstrained the economic performance of Assam. Its problems have been those of remoteness, \npartially hilly terrain, and high transportation costs. Assam is also constrained by high population \ndensity, a large but slow-growing agriculture sector, and a high incidence of poverty. In addition, \ninsurgency considerably slowed economic activity in the 1990s. All these factors contributed to \nAssam\u2019s  gross  state  domestic  product  (GSDP)  growth  rate  trend  at  constant  prices  during \nFY1993\u2013FY1999 remaining below 2%. With the decline in insurgency in recent years, and some \nstrong  tax  incentives  introduced  by  the  central  government,  the  manufacturing  and  services \nsectors  showed  buoyant  growth  during  FY1999\u2013FY2005,  with  manufacturing  growing  at  8.6% \nper annum and services growing by 8.0%. Led by these growth figures, the GSDP trend growth \nrate has risen to 5.4% during FY1994\u2013FY2006.2 However, due to potential slowing down of the \n\ninfrastructure \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n1  These states are Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura. \n2  In terms of compositional changes due to relatively low growth rates of agriculture, the primary sector (producing \nraw materials such as agriculture, fishing, and mining) as a whole has seen a fall in its share, whereas the share of \nthe services sector has steadily increased. The share of the primary sector fell from nearly 47% in FY1994 to 34% \nin FY2006, a fall of 13 percentage points, amounting to nearly one percentage point per year. Correspondingly, the \nshare  of  the  tertiary  sector  (providing  service  activities  such  as  banking,  transportation,  and  health  care)  has \nincreased from 38.2% in FY1994 to 49.5% in FY2006. A significant portion of the services sector comprises trade, \nhotels and restaurants, and public administration. The increase in the share of the secondary sector (manufacturing \nbusinesses  that  take  materials  from  the  primary  sector  and  other  secondary  businesses  and  make  them  into \ngoods) has been much less, from 14.9% in FY1994 to 17.4% in FY2006. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nIndian economy in coming years, revenue collection by the central government may decline and \nthis  may  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  central  transfers  to  Assam,  which  constitute  a  major \nsource of revenue for the government of Assam. \n \nAgainst the background of the poor performance of the state economy during the 1990s, \n4. \nthe  finances  of  the  government  of  Assam  underwent  a  major  crisis  in  the  late  1990s  with \nrevenue deficit and fiscal deficit reaching alarming levels.3 The government of Assam finances \nhave showed a steep deterioration since FY1999. With respect to a profile of fiscal imbalance \nrelative to GSDP, in FY1999, revenue deficit relative to GSDP rose to 3.4% of GSDP from the \nposition  of  a  surplus  in  the  3  preceding  years.  Revenue  deficit  continued  until  FY2004.  The \nfiscal deficit was close to 5% of GSDP in FY2001 and remained high until FY2004. It was due to \na  substantial  increase  in  central  transfers  and  several  reform  initiatives  of  the  government  of \nAssam\u2014including  improved  expenditure  management  measures\u2014that  a  revenue  surplus  and \neven  a  fiscal  surplus  were  recorded  in  FY2005  and  in  FY2006.  However,  a  fiscal  deficit  was \nrecorded again in FY2007 despite a surplus in the revenue account. The reemergence of fiscal \ndeficit  in  FY2007  was  primarily  attributed  to  a  sharp  increase  in  government  investment.  The \ndebt\u2013GSDP ratio of 30% in FY2007 remained higher than the overall benchmark for the debt\u2013\nGSDP ratio of 28% prescribed by the Twelfth Finance Commission (TFC).4   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n \nA. \n \n5. \nIntroduction.  In  explaining  the  development  of  the  fiscal  crisis  in  the  late  1990s,  it  is \nnotable that Assam's finances were exposed to at least four external shocks beyond the control \nof the government of Assam. Firstly, there was the revision of salaries and pensions of central \ngovernment  employees  and  the  subsequent  near-convergence  of  pay  scales  and  other \nallowances between the center and the states, including Assam. Secondly, there was a fall in \nthe central tax\u2013gross domestic product (GDP) ratio by nearly two percentage points during the \n1990s, leading to a fall in the government of Assam\u2019s share of central taxes.5 Thirdly, revenue \nfrom  forests  in  Assam,  which  at  one  time  was  a  mainstay  of  Assam's  nontax  resources, \ndeteriorated  sharply  after  the  Supreme  Court  judgment  banning  unplanned  felling  of  trees \nunless  done  according  to  scientific  plans.  Fourthly,  interest  rates  have  risen  sharply  since  the \nmid-1990s, especially on small savings and central loans. These external pressures worked in \ncombination  with  critical  internal  weaknesses,  which  emanated  from  (i)  a  rise  of  insurgency \naffecting economic as well as fiscal performance, (ii) subdued industrial growth, (iii) the dismal \nperformance  of  public  sector  enterprises  (PSEs),  and  (iv)  a  high  salary  burden  linked  to \nexcessive  employment  in  the  government  of  Assam.  The  basic  mismatch  in  Assam's  fiscal \nposition  was  reflected  in  its  perennial  dependence  on  the  ways  and  means  advance  (the \nresources available to meet expenses) to get through its cash-crisis problem.6  \n\n                                                 \n3   Revenue  deficit  (surplus)  is  the  difference  between  total  revenue  (tax  revenue,  nontax  revenue,  and  share  of \ncentral taxes and grants) and revenue expenditure (interest, salaries, pensions, and public sector enterprise [PSE] \nrestructuring expense). Fiscal deficit (surplus) is the difference between capital expenditure (capital outlays, loans, \nand advances) and revenue deficit (surplus). \n\n4    The  Government  of  India  sets  up  a  Finance  Commission  on  quinquennial  basis  to  determine  primarily  the \ndistribution  between  the  union  and  the  states  of  the  net  proceeds  of  taxes.  The  commission  also  prescribes \nbenchmarks to reward complying states and undertakes other tasks as per the terms of reference specified by the \nGovernment of India. \n\n5   Due to the slowdown of the Indian economy in the 1990s, there was a fall in the central tax\u2013GDP ratio.  \n6   During  the  crisis  period,  Assam  topped  the  list  of  states  for  the  number  of  days  of  access  to  ways  and  means \nadvance  in  a  year  for  several  years  and  regularly  ran  an  overdraft  with  the  central  bank  (the  Reserve  Bank  of \nIndia).  \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nHowever,  fiscal  reforms  have  since  been  initiated  pursuant  to  the  ADB  Assam \n6. \nGovernance  and  Public  Resource  Management  Sector  Development  Program  (AGPRM). 7 \nUnder  subprogram  I  of  the  AGPRM,  reforms  have  led  to  fiscal  recovery  with  manageable \ndeficits as a result of actions on debt restructuring and settlement, PSE closure, tax policy, and \nadministrative measures. The government of Assam is no longer resorting to ways and means \nadvances  and  does  not  run  an  overdraft  with  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India.  Moreover,  various \nreforms have been undertaken by the government of Assam during the subprogram I period to \nimprove  governance  and  better  manage  the  resources  available.  As  part  of  other  revenue \naugmentation  reforms,  in  order  to  strengthen  weaknesses  in  revenue  collection  (value-added \ntax  [VAT],  excise  duty,  motor  vehicle  tax,  and  forest  produce  levies),  subprogram  I  undertook \nstrengthening  of  checkposts  at  the  main  entry  and  exit  points  on  the  trading  routes  with \nneighboring  states  and  initiated  the  establishment  of  a  composite  computerized  database. \nFurthermore, controls on budget and expenditure management have been improved to enhance \nthe efficiency and effectiveness of budget processing.8 Moreover, closure of nine PSEs and two \nunits  of  the  Assam  Small  Industries  Development  Corporation  was  notified,  and  50%  of  the \nrequired disbursement for the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) has been paid to employees \nof PSEs identified for closure. Part of the explanation for the recovery is the effect of external \ninfluences.  The  reason  for  the  improvement  in  FY2005  and  in  FY2006  was  the  increase  in \ncentral fiscal transfers as directed by the recommendations of the TFC. This was combined with \nmuch higher central tax buoyancy, which helped increase the resource transfers from the center \nand,  consequently,  a  revenue  surplus  was  recorded  in  FY2005  after  a  long  period  of  deficits. \nMore details have been provided in Appendix 2. \n \n7. \nFiscal Performance. After considerable deterioration in the profile of fiscal imbalances, \ngovernment finances in Assam, as shown in the levels of revenue and fiscal deficits towards the \nlatter  part  of  the  1990s,  have  been  recovering  since  FY2001.  A  revenue  deficit  of  2.64%  of \nGSDP  in  FY2001  was  converted  into  a  surplus  of  1.2%  of  GSDP  as  per  FY2007  revised \nestimates.9 The  fiscal  deficit\u2013GSDP  ratio  has  also  been  reduced  from  4.33%  in  FY2001  to  a \nsurplus  of  1.09%  in  FY2006  and  is  well  below  permissible  levels  under  the  government  of \nAssam\u2019s Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management (FRBM) Act10 (Appendix 3).  \n \n8. \nThese changes are due to a combination of external and internal factors. The upsurge in \nthe GSDP growth rate to levels close to 9% since FY2003, accompanied by an increase in the \nbuoyancy  of  central  direct  taxes,  has  been  beneficial  to  Assam\u2019s  fiscal  profile.  Not  only  has \nthere  been  a  corresponding  growth  in  the  government  of  Assam\u2019s  share  of  central  taxes,  but \nboth  non-plan  and  plan  grants  have  also  been  substantially  increased.  Also,  nominal  interest \nrates have declined substantially in the current decade. The debt swap initiatives in the earlier \npart of this decade, and subsequently the substantial debt relief given by the TFC effective from \nFY2005, have resulted in a reduction in the effective interest rate from 10.2% in FY1999 to 8.5% \n\n                                                 \n7   The loan comprises (i) a program cluster concept consisting of two back-to-back subprograms to be implemented, \n(ii) a program loan of $125 million for subprogram I, and (iii) a project loan of $25 million for capacity development \nand program implementation during the period of subprograms I and II.

Manila. \n\n8   On the budget and expenditure management efforts, the debt recording and management system has been put in \nplace, operation and maintenance (O&M) expenditure targets consistent with the updated medium-term fiscal plan \n(MTFP)  for  FY2008  have  been  approved,  two  key  management  information  systems  (MISs)  have  been \nestablished, and an inventory of central transfer schemes has been undertaken. \n\n9   \u201cBudget estimates\u201d refers to the approximation of the cost of an activity, program, or project, which was prepared \nfor budgeting and planning purposes only. During the following year, the budget estimates will be updated with the \nlatest information and will be called \u201crevised estimates\u201d. \n\n10 The FRBM Act stipulates achievement of a balance on the revenue account and a fiscal deficit of 3% by FY2009. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nin  FY2006.  Also,  the  proportion  of  outstanding debt  as  a  percentage  of  GSDP  has  decreased \nfrom 37.56% in FY2001 to 28.82% in FY2006. The composition of the state debt portfolio has \nalso changed, with an increasing bias towards market and institutional loans and fewer centrally \nsourced loans. \n \n9. \nFactors within Assam have been equally important in improving the financial position of \nthe  government  of  Assam.  Among  the  several  initiatives  taken  by  the  government  of  Assam, \nsome of the important ones relate to the enactment of the FRBM  Act and sustained sales tax \nreforms leading up to the introduction of VAT. Assam\u2019s GSDP trend growth rate also picked up \nfrom less than 2% per annum during FY1993\u2013FY1999 on a trend basis to 5.4% during FY1999 \nand  FY2005.  Own-revenue  receipts  have  also  increased  from  6.15%  in  FY2001  to  8.2%  of \nGSDP in FY2006 despite a marginal fall in sales tax and VAT collection from 4.8% of GSDP in \nFY2004 to 4.27% in FY2006, due to the change from sales tax to VAT in FY2005.11  \n  \n10. \nThe government of Assam has also been successful in containing the growth of revenue \n(recurrent)  expenditure  due  to  the  earlier  mentioned  factors  of  debt  consolidation,  swaps  and \nretirement,  and  a  virtual  freeze  on  recruitments.  There  has  been  a  decline  in  the  revenue \nexpenditure\u2013GSDP ratio from 20% in FY2000 to 18% in FY2006. More importantly, the share of \nsalaries in revenue expenditure declined sharply from 60% to about 40% over the same period. \n \nConsiderable reforms have also been undertaken to put in order the affairs of the state \n11. \nPSEs. Eight PSEs were notified for closure under subprogram I of the AGPRM. In addition, the \ngovernment  of  Assam  identified  both  the  Assam  State  Electricity  Board  and  Assam  State \nTransport Corporation\u2014the two largest loss-generating enterprises\u2014for reform and operational \nrestructuring. There has been staff rationalization and public\u2013private partnership initiatives in the \nAssam State Transport Corporation; the Assam State Electricity Board is in the process of being \nunbundled and corporatized. \n \nThe results of all these efforts and changes are reflected in a reduction of the revenue \n12. \ndeficit from the peak of 3.4% of GSDP to less than 1% by FY2004, and a revenue surplus in the \nsubsequent  years  up  to  FY2007  (revised  estimate).  The  challenges  for  the  government  of \nAssam  are  to  sustain  this  trend  and  achieve  at  least  a  balance  on  the  revenue  account  by \nFY2008  to  meet  the  FRBM  Act  targets.  The  sustainability  of  the  recent  fiscal  performance \nrequires  continued  emphasis  on  some  areas  as  described  in  the  following  paragraphs.  The \ncurrent  achievements  in  fiscal  performance  are  due  to  one-time  corrections, 12  and  the \nadvantages accruing from these corrections could be lost if fiscal prudence is not maintained, or \nthrough exposure to risks such as spikes in salaries due to implementation of salary increases \nfollowing the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations. \n \n13. \nCentral  Transfers.  It  was  due  to  a  substantial  increase  in  fiscal  transfers  that,  in \nFY2005, a revenue surplus and even a small fiscal surplus were recorded. However, formula-\nbased  fiscal  transfers  to  the  states  depend  on  the  nominal  national  GDP  growth  rate.  Any \ndecline in the growth rate will have an adverse impact on transfers to the states. Given Assam\u2019s \ndependence on central transfers, this has the potential to destabilize fiscal consolidation. Thus, \nmobilizing  higher  revenue  from  own  sources  is  imperative  to  maintaining  the  pace  of  fiscal \nconsolidation in the state.   \n                                                 \n11 Sales tax was levied until FY2004 and from 1 April 2005 (from FY2005) onwards, it has been replaced by VAT. \n12  Revenue has been positively impacted by (i) the introduction of VAT, which has led to an increase in the tax base, \n(ii)  reduced  interest  outgoings  due  to  consolidation  of  Government  of  India  loans  following  the  enactment  of  the \nFRBM Act, (iii) arrested salary expenditure growth through checks on recruitments, and (iv) limits on subsidies to \nPSEs with the closure of inoperative PSEs.  \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nTax  Revenue. The government of  Assam\u2019s tax\u2013GSDP ratio continues to improve, and \n14. \nreached 6.2% in FY2004. In the following 2 years, the tax\u2013GSDP ratio experienced a marginal \nfall  due  to  the  impact  of  the  introduction  of  VAT.  However,  it  has  remained  higher  than  in  all \nprevious  years.  The  government  of  Assam  needs  to  sustain  key  reforms  in  the  areas  of  tax \nadministration  to  improve  tax  compliance.  It  is  essential  for  Assam  to  develop  an  efficient \nsystem for managing and administering its own tax revenue in order to benefit from the rise in \neconomic  activity.  Improving  own  tax  yields  are  important  because  that  will  enable  Assam  to \nobtain some measure of fiscal independence from the central government.  \n \n15. \nNontax Revenue. Nontax revenue relative to GSDP, which was close to 1% until 1998\u2013\n1999,  has  also  risen  continuously  and  it  was  estimated  at  2.6%  of  GSDP  in  FY2006.  With \ngrowing oil prices, ad valorem petroleum royalties will continue to be the largest contributor to \nnontax  revenue  from  economic  services;  they  have  been  gradually  strengthening  the  nontax \nrevenue  share.  Nontax  revenue  has  reasonable  scope  for  augmentation  provided  a  link \nbetween costs and recoveries is established. Among the social services, medical, public health, \nand  family  welfare  provide  the  largest  share  of  nontax  revenue.  Secondary  education \ncontributes most of the fees collected in education.  \n \n16. \nDependence on Central Fiscal Transfers. In spite of the continuously improving own-\nrevenue performance, the dependence of Assam on central transfers has always been large. In \nFY2005,  following  the  recommendations  of  the  TFC,  central  transfers  amounted  to  12.8%  of \nGSDP, and were estimated at nearly 17.7% of GSDP in FY2006 due to a rise in the share of \ncentral taxes and a steep rise in the plan grants. \n \nExpenditure. Total government expenditure relative to GSDP may be considered as an \n17. \nindicator  of  the  size  of  government.  There  was  a  discernible  declining  trend  in  government \nexpenditure as a percentage of GSDP in Assam up to FY1998. Since then, there has been an \nincrease in total expenditure relative to GSDP. Based on sharp increases in plan assistance, 2 \nrecent  years  show  significant  increases.  After  falling  in  the  mid-1990s,  revenue  expenditure \nstarted rising after FY1996, reaching close to 20% of GSDP in FY1999. It remained roughly at \nthis  level  up  until  FY2001.  There  was  a  small  fall  in  FY2002,  it  again  rose  in  FY2003  and \nFY2004,  before  falling  again  to  around  17%\u201318%  in  FY2005  and  FY2006.  Some  important \nfeatures  on  the  expenditure  side  relate  to  the  rising  share  of  committed  expenditures  such  as \ninterest payments, pensions, and salaries, and a low and stagnant share of capital expenditure \nin total expenditure. Interest payment peaked at 3.6% of GSDP in FY2002 but since then it has \nfallen  based  on  the  softening  of  the  interest  rate  and  relief  due  to  the  center\u2019s  debt  swap \nprogram.  Pensions  rose  steadily  up  to  FY2004,  accounting  for  2.43%  of  GSDP.  A  reversal  in \nthis trend is essential for promoting growth and fiscal consolidation, which would in turn require \nsustaining key reforms in areas such as staff rationalization, pension reform, debt restructuring, \nand expenditure management. \n \n18. \nAsset-forming government expenditure, such as capital outlay and net lending, steadily \ndeclined after the mid-1990s but has shown improvement in the current decade. The share of \ncapital outlay and loans and advances steadily declined due to a sharp increase in the share of \nrepayment obligations of the government of Assam for repayment of loans and advances from \nthe central government.  \n \n19. \nDebt. With regard to the composition of loans, within a span of 6 years (from FY2000 to \nFY2005), the share of market loans in total debt has risen from nearly 23% to 38%, whereas the \nshare  of  central  loans  has  fallen  from  64%  in  FY1998  to  25.8%  in  FY2005.  With  the \nrecommendation  of  the  TFC  regarding  disintermediation  of  state  loans  by  the  central \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ngovernment,  the  states  are  expected  to  approach  market  loan  sources  and,  therefore,  central \nloans  are  expected  to  have  a  smaller  share in  Assam\u2019s  debt  profile, and  most  of  them  will  be \nconsolidated debt following the TFC\u2019s recommendations. \n \nPublic  Sector  Enterprises.  The  PSEs  have  historically  been  a  fiscal  drag  on  the \n20. \ngovernment of Assam\u2019s finances. There are 48 PSEs in Assam, of which 33 are corporations, \neight are cooperatives, and seven are statutory bodies. The PSEs have historically been known \nfor  not  keeping  up-to-date  audited  accounts.  For  example,  at  the  end  of  March  2004,  no \ninformation was available for 15 PSEs and there was some information but no audited accounts \nfor  14  PSEs.  Thus,  for  60%  of  the  PSEs,  the  reliance  on  available  financial  information  has \nbeen limited. Of the remaining 19 PSEs, 15 had provisional accounts and there were only four \nPSEs where audited accounts were available. \n \n21. \nFiscal  Discipline.  The  government  of  Assam  has  enacted  the  FRBM  Act  stipulating \nlimitations on the levels of deficit for the state finances, with the targets being 3% fiscal deficit \nand  a  revenue  balance  by  FY2008  following  the  TFC  stipulated  targets.  Accordingly,  the \ngovernment of Assam\u2019s Medium-Term Fiscal Plan (MTFP) presents a fiscal profile that shows a \nrevenue  surplus  being  generated  throughout  the  period  from  FY2007  budget  estimates  to \nFY2011 projections. The fiscal deficit relative to GSDP shows a continuous decline from 3.16% \nin FY2007 to 2.28% in FY2011. In both cases, the targets stipulated by the TFC are projected to \nbe met. The only features of the MTFP that may cause some concern are that capital outlay as \na percentage of GSDP is shown to be falling over time and the debt\u2013GSDP ratio has exceeded \n37% of GSDP.  \n \nB. \n \n22. \nThe  issues  faced  in  public  resource  management  in  Assam  are  multifaceted.  An \nassessment of the various aspects of public resource management and the experiences under \nsubprogram  I  have  identified  that  lack  of  financial  flexibility  has  been  impacted  by  several \nvariables.  Key  ones  that  are  relevant  to  the  proposed  subprogram  II  include  (i)  revenue \nadministration, (ii) expenditure management, (iii) debt management, and (iv) PSE reforms.  \n \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\nRevenue Administration \n\n1. \n \n23. \nIn  the  revenue  departments,  the  first  major  issue  involves  the  constraint  of  human \nresources, particularly that of recruitment of operating staff and provision for regular training and \ncapacity  building  of  staff.  The  second  issue,  related  to  the  first  issue,  has  been  the  lack  of  a \nmechanism  to  facilitate  the  periodic  intensive  exposure  of  the  operating  staff  to  modern \npractices adopted by what are considered to be more advanced states in India. The third issue \nis  that  of  underfunding  for  the  modernization  of  the  revenue  administration  departments,  not \nonly in terms of the introduction of information and communication technology (ICT) facilities but \neven  of  renewal  of  basic  facilities,  to  enable  more  efficient  revenue  administration.  Issues \nspecific to major sources of revenue are described below.  \n \n\na. \n\nValue-Added Tax \n\n \n\nThe number of registered VAT dealers has grown phenomenally to around 82,300 as of \n\n24. \nSeptember 2007.13 Assuming 50% of them are required to file monthly returns, the total number \n\n                                                 \n13 As  VAT  is  a  self-assessment  based  tax,  the  increase  in  the  number  of  registered  dealers  for  VAT  is  a  good \n\nparameter to judge compliance leading to an increase in tax base and revenue collection. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nof  such  returns,  to  be  handled  by  about  220  superintendents  and  inspectors  positioned  in  the \ncircles and units (i.e., excluding those in the office of the commissioner of commercial tax and at \ncheckposts), would be about 41,000, i.e., over 180 returns per person per month and another \n60-plus  returns  per  quarter.  Since  VAT  is  a  self-assessment  tax,  the  role  of  audit  becomes \ncrucial. The filing and auditing of such a large number of returns is currently an unmanageable \nload. \n \n25. \nThe  Commercial  Tax  Department  has  so  far  focused  primarily  on  making  the  VAT \nsystem  operational  in  the  face  of  organizational  and  other  constraints.  As  a  result,  dealers\u2019 \neducation on the features of the new tax and associated matters like proactive and widespread \nassistance to facilitate compliance has not attracted as much attention as it deserves. It may be \nmentioned, though, that some publicity campaigns are being organized by the department. The \ngovernment of Assam has, however, put in place an institutional consultative forum, headed by \nthe commissioner and principal secretary of taxation of the Finance Department, which has as \nmembers  representatives  of  various  industry  associations.  It  can  be  a  useful  mechanism  to \ndevise  measures  based  on  websites  and  other  media  and  make  them  operational  to  fill  this \nconspicuous gap quickly. \n \n26. \nThe  tax  information  management  system  (TIMS)  has  been  installed  and  made \nfunctional. However, the system faces some issues with respect to performance of application \nsoftware, which is proving to be a bottleneck in the full functioning of the TIMS. Five modules of \nthe TIMS have been made functional: registration, returns, payments, a checkpost-geographical \ninformation  system,  and  statutory  form  modules.  There  are  several  other  modules  in  the \nsystems that are still to be made functional. Since the development of the TIMS was undertaken \nwhen  the  sales  tax  regime  existed,  there  is  a  requirement  for  redesign  of  the  forms  and \ndevelopment of an audit module that was not developed earlier. Online data entry and validation \nof past tax returns in the TIMS is facing a backlog due to the high system response time. \n \n\nb. \n\nExcise Tax \n\n \n27. \nThe  excise  commissioner\u2019s  office  and  the  field  formations  in  districts  and  circles  have \nneither undergone any reorganization nor do they have any improved mobility (transport facility) \nor  even  rudimentary  computer  facilities.  Most  routine  functions,  including  typewriting,  are  still \ncarried  out  manually  in  the  commissioner\u2019s  office  as  well  as  in  the  field  offices.  Under  such  a \nscenario,  even  if  the  ICT-based  management  information  system  (MIS)  at  the  composite \ncheckposts becomes fully operational for excise functions, the absence of suitable ICT support \nfacilities  and  connectivity  in  the  offices  of  the  commissioner  and  the  district  superintendents \nmeans that the enforcement database of the checkposts would not be utilized optimally in these \noffices.  \n \nThe second issue with respect to excise is that of the basic structure of the excise duty \n28. \non  India-made  foreign  liquor  (IMFL)14 and  country  spirits.  Excise  revenue  has  been  generally \nstagnant, though its potential for growth is considerable. The replacement of the existing fixed \nlicense fee system in respect of country spirits, as envisaged in subprogram I, has been notified. \nAs a next step, the notification will need to be implemented through auctioning of new country \nspirit  shop  licenses.  The  government  of  Assam  notification  was  issued  in  November  2006  to \nadopt  the  system  of  auctioning  the  retail  outlets  of  country  spirits  instead  of  fixed  license  fee-\nbased  tendering.  Accordingly,  the  auction  system  is  expected  to  become  operational.  The \n\n                                                 \n14 India-made  foreign  liquors,  such  as  whisky  and  vodka,  are  different  from  India-made  country  liquor  (licensed \n\ndistilled spirits made locally). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\ngovernment  has  moved  to  an  ad  valorem  excise  duty  structure  on  IMFL  with  a  consequent \nincrease  in  excise  duty  collection  of  11%  in  2006.  According  to  the  Excise  Department,  a \nproposal  for  levy  of  ad  valorem  duty  on  IMFL  was  submitted  to  the  government  of  Assam  in \nOctober 2006 under subprogram I. \n  \n\nc. \n\nStamp Duty and Registration Fees \n\n \n\n29. \nStamp duty and registration fees are comparatively simpler and they are suited to quick \nand  simple  technological  solutions.  The  manual  process  of  registration  of  properties  and  the \nnon-objective  valuation  method  of  properties  at  the  time  of  property  transactions  give  large \nscope  for  missed  revenue  collection.  The  introduction  of  ICT-driven  extensive  process \nreengineering in both the objective valuation method (OVM) of land records and registration of \nproperty transactions can bring about sustainable improvement in revenue collection as well as \nefficient and transparent service delivery to users by way of immediate provision of registration \ndocuments,  which  currently  takes  a  long  time.  One  of  the  issues  with  adopting  technology  for \nOVM  and  registration  of  properties  is  that  of  uploading  the  available  manually  recorded  sales \ndata. It is contained in the poorly maintained bulky records of the stamps and registration unit of \nthe land records directorate as well as in district and sub-registrars' offices. \n \n\n2. \n\nExpenditure Management \n\n \n30. \nThe key issue in expenditure management is the rising share of committed expenditure \nsuch  as  interest  payments,  pensions,  and  salaries,  and  the  low  and  falling  share  of  capital \nexpenditure among total expenditure. This is in the context of a situation where Assam, with its \nspecial  category  state  status. 15  Expenditure  on  salaries  and  pensions  is  vulnerable  to  the \nimpending central Sixth Pay Commission. There is a possibility of a sudden increase in revenue \nexpenditure due to higher salary scales following the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations. \nThis  could  jeopardize  Assam\u2019s  fiscal  consolidation  initiatives,  leading  to  a  drop  in  capital \nexpenditure. \n \n31. \nTo further rationalize expenditure management, the government of Assam is introducing \noutcome-based  budgeting  (OBB).  The  government  has  realized  that,  given  the  present \ndominance  of  input-based  line-item  budgeting,  OBB  will  have  to  be  introduced  in  a  phased \nmanner. As an important first step, 10 departments have been instructed to prepare their budget \nestimates  for  FY2009  around  specified  outputs,  rather  than  inputs.  Over  the  course  of \nsubprogram  II,  TA  will  be  provided  to  take  this  process  further  and  establish  a  proper  OBB \nprocess,  including  ex-ante  alignment  with  the  budget  classification  and  codification  system.16 \nUnder  subprogram  II,  the  government  of  Assam  will  issue  guidelines  for  OBB  and  will \nsubsequently pilot the implementation of these guidelines in a departmental scheme. \n \n\n3. \n\nDebt Management \n\n \n32. \nThe responsibility for government borrowing, debt recording, debt servicing, accounting \nfor  debt  transactions  and  overall  debt  management\u2014including  government  onlending  and \nguarantees\u2014is  scattered  across  several  government  agencies.  This  makes  it  very  difficult  to \n\n                                                 \n15 The  ratio  of  grant\u2013loan  composition  of  assistance  will  be  given  by  the  Planning  Commission  for  the  special \n\ncategory states. \n\n16  Budget  classification  is  currently  done  by  means  of  an  ex-post  analysis  of  endorsed  budgets  (by  the  State \nDirectorate  of  Economics  and  Statistics)  and  distinguishes  between  administrative,  economic,  and  purpose  (or \nfunctional)  classification.  Ex-ante  alignment  with  budget  nomenclature  will  be  introduced  as  part  of  the  OBB \nprocess.   \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nsystematically analyze government  debt and associated risks. The government does not have \nthe skills in the Finance Department for efficient debt management. This becomes more critical \nin an efficient public financial management system, which is a key ingredient for sustained fiscal \nconsolidation.17 It is thus a high-priority area for the state governments to consider towards their \ncapacity building for debt management, including external debt management. \n\nPublic Sector Enterprises \n\n \n4. \n \nThe  government  of  Assam  extends  guarantees  for  loans  taken  by  a  number  of  PSEs \n33. \nand  cooperative  institutions.  Given  the  financial  performance  of  these  enterprises,  many  of \nthese  guarantees  in  the  form  of  contingent  liabilities  have  the  potential  of  becoming  actual \nbudgetary  liabilities.  In many  cases,  the  debt  incurred  by  the  concerned  agency  has  not  been \nserviced, so that outstanding liabilities have mounted as a result of unpaid repayments as well \nas unpaid interest liabilities. As of 2007, out of the total guaranteed loan of Rs15 billion, nearly \nRs13 billion remain outstanding liabilities in terms of repayments and interest due. \n \nThere are several inoperative, or almost inoperative, PSEs in Assam. However, due to \n34. \nthe  non-notification  of  closure  of  such  PSEs,  the  salary  and  statutory  dues  to  the  employees \nhave  been  accumulating  and  these  ultimately  devolve  to  the  government  of  Assam.  The \ngovernment of Assam has notified closure of eight PSEs under subprogram I and plans to notify \nmore PSEs for closure to stop the accumulation of liabilities. The notification ensures effective \nfinancial  closure  of  the  PSEs.  However,  achieving  the  legal  closure  of  the  PSEs  will  be  time-\nconsuming as the accounts of the PSEs are not up to date and statutory audit of accounts are \npending for several years. \n \n \n \n35. \nThe  higher  tax  revenues  for  the  state  and  central  governments  are  the  result  of  high \ngrowth rates of GDP nationally and in Assam. The higher tax revenues for the Government also \ntranslate into larger central transfers to the government of Assam. This provides an opportunity \nfor  the  government  of  Assam  to  increase  investments  in  social  and  physical  infrastructure, \nwhich could possibly lead to attracting private investments into Assam. This, in turn, could lead \nto further economic growth, greater tax revenues, and peace, thus putting Assam into a cycle of \ngrowth and development.  \n \n \n  \n36. \nThe  government  of  Assam\u2019s  strategy  emphasizes  placing  its  public  finances  on  a \nsustainable  path  and  improving  governance  to  enable  higher  levels  of  investment  on  critical \nsocial  and  physical  infrastructure,  thus  strengthening  the  prospects  for  sustained  economic \ngrowth and reducing poverty. Sustained high growth depends crucially on the creation of fiscal \nresources  for  additional  public  investment.18 The  government  of  Assam  has  assured  that  the \nreforms  under  subprogram  II  will  sustain  the  development  momentum  initiated  under \nsubprogram  I.  The  government  of  Assam  is  also  taking  various  steps  as  facilitator  for  the \ndevelopment of industries and commerce in Assam. Against this background the government is \n\nGovernment of Assam Strategy \n\nBuoyant Economic Growth \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n                                                 \n17 There  is  a  change  in  the  policy  of  the  Government  of  India  whereby  states  have  been  allowed  to  obtain  loans \ndirectly from multilateral and bilateral sources rather than receive the proceeds through an Indian rupee loan from \nthe central government. \n\n18  In line with its strategy, the government of Assam signed the memorandum on the medium-term fiscal reform with \nthe  Government  in  March  2003,  thereby  indicating  its  commitment  to  a  medium-term  strategy  for  fiscal \nconsolidation.   \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nADB Strategy and Operations \n\ntaking  all  possible  steps  to  attract  investments  in  infrastructure  (including  roads,  ICT,  and \ntourism-related facilities), and is attempting to make Assam a regional hub of industrial activity \nin  the  northeast.  Schemes  like  the  New  Industrial  Policy,  2003,  are  being  implemented  to \nencourage  entrepreneurs  by  providing  various  investment  incentives.  With  continued  support \nfrom  the  Government  to  apply  earlier  patterns  of  loan  proceeds  of  externally  aided  project  to \nAssam,19 the government of Assam is accelerating its efforts to avail itself of assistance of other \nmultilateral  donors,  including  World  Bank  assistance  for  the  public  works  department  roads \nproject20 and ADB assistance for flood mitigation and financial sector reforms.    \n \n \n\n7. \n \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  2003\u20132006  for  India 21  was  the  first \n37. \noperational strategy proposed for India after the adoption of ADB's poverty reduction strategy in \n1999 and its incorporation into the long- and medium-term strategic frameworks.22 There have \nsince  been  two  updates  to  the  strategy\u2014CSP  update  2005\u20132007  and  CSP  update  2006\u2013\n2008.23 Mainstreaming  poverty  reduction  is  the  central  organizing  theme  of  the  most  recent \nstrategy.  \n \n38. \nThe most important challenge facing the achievement of high growth is that of a major \nfiscal turnaround. ADB assistance for fiscal consolidation has been provided to focal states such \nas Assam, Gujarat, Kerala, and Madhya Pradesh. In the new CSP, assistance for fiscal policy \nreforms,  improved  tax  administration,  and  other  fiscal  management  measures  of  the  state \ngovernments  will  be  significantly  strengthened.  Another  important  strategic  priority  in  the  new \nCSP is governance, which cuts across all other components of the strategy. Good governance \nwill considerably enhance the total developmental impact of ADB's assistance program. In the \ncase  of  Assam,  state-level  fiscal  policy  reforms  have  been  emphasized,  and  these  are \ncombined  with  interventions  to  strengthen  state  governments  to  ensure  greater  accountability, \ntransparency, and efficiency in service delivery, especially for pro-poor services. \n \n \n \n39. \nSubprogram II has been designed in light of some important recommendations put forth \nby ADB\u2019s Operations Evaluation Department in its special evaluation studies on ADB Support to \nPublic  Resource  Management  in  India  and  Policy-Based  Lending:  Emerging  Practices  in \nSupporting Reforms in Developing Member Countries.24 Moreover, subprogram II has benefited \nfrom  A  Comparative  Assessment  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  Public  Resource \nManagement Reform Programs.25 The design of subprogram II takes into consideration lessons \n\nLessons  \n\n8. \n\n                                                 \n19 The loan proceeds of externally aided projects were transferred by the central government to the special category \nstates  as  90%  grant  and  10%  loan.  Under  the  Twelfth  Finance  Commission  award,  the  Government  decided  to \ncontinuously apply the same assistance pattern to these special category states including Assam. \n\n20 Appendix 4 provides the development coordination matrix. \n21 ADB. 2003.

The following paragraphs highlight the \nkey lessons from these programs. Effective and viable political economy analysis is required to \nimprove reform design and risk-mitigation measures. Accordingly, a risk-mitigation analysis has \nbeen conducted in order to identify key political economy factors, how to address their impact \non  the  reform  program,  and  how  to  mitigate  related  risks\u2014such  as  low  capacity  of  relevant \nagencies, weak internal accountability mechanisms, and risks related to PSEs\u2014during program \nimplementation.   \n \nlegislation\u2013institutions\u2013\n40. \norganization\u2013people  provides  a  strategic  sequence  for  reforms.  Subprogram  II  has  been \ndesigned  in  line  with  subprogram  I,  which  has  shown  progress  in  legislative  and  regulatory \nreforms as well as capacity building of government and related institutions. As subprogram I is \nsequenced,  subprogram  II  will  focus  on  actual  implementation  of  reforms  initiated  under \nsubprogram  I.26   A  coherent  application  of  design  tools\u2014such  as  the  policy  matrix,  the  design \nand  monitoring  framework,  and  the  poverty  impact  assessment  matrix\u2014is  needed  to  achieve \ndevelopment  results.  Subprogram  II  pays  attention  to  developing  realistic  development \noutcomes and outputs, and ensures consistency among these design tools to forge the basis for \nbetter monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n41. \nFor sustainable reforms, there is a need to develop capacities\u2014including management, \nleadership, facilitation, and conflict resolution competencies\u2014for better institutional and human \ncapacity  building.  Subprogram  II  is  to  be complemented  by  an  attached  TA  program,  which  is \ndesigned  to  provide  technical  support  in  the  areas  of  (i)  capacity  development  of  government \nofficials  and \nrevenue \nto  undertake \nadministration,  debt  and  expenditure  management,  and  PSE  reform;  and  (ii)  institutional  and \nhuman  resources  capacity  development \nfacilitation, \nnegotiation,  and  conflict  resolution  competencies.  For  efficient  training  of  large  numbers  of \nofficials,  trained  consultants  will  be  mobilized  to  conduct  training  programs  in  the  field  in \njuxtaposition with training through designated local training institutions with curriculum designed \nfor client-oriented trainings. In summary, the components of the TA have been designed to help \ngovernment officials and related stakeholders to be better equipped with general management \ncompetencies as well as technical knowledge upgrading in specific fiscal management issues. \n \n \n\n9. \n \n42. \nDue  to  the  magnitude  of  fiscal  governance  issues  across  all  the  state  governments  in \nIndia,  ADB\u2019s  intervention  in  Assam  through  the  AGPRM  should  be  viewed  as  part  of  a  larger \nstrategy  involving  multiple  development  partners  to  address  the  issue  of  deficits  leading  to \nconstrained  investments  in  social  and  physical  infrastructure  in  the  less  advanced  states. \nSubprogram  II  draws  from  the  lessons  of  development  that  states  like  Andhra  Pradesh  and \nKarnataka  have  experienced  through  strengthening  of  their  public  resource  management  and \ngovernance systems over the past decade. Development partners are active in India in the area \nof fiscal governance reforms (Appendix 4) and areas of support have included \n \n\nExternal Assistance and Development Partner Coordination \n\nincluding  management, \n\nrelated  stakeholders \n\nidentified  areas, \n\nleadership, \n\nincluding \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nmaking delivery institutions more accountable; \nsustainable development through poverty reduction, private sector development, \nhealth,  basic  education,  equality  between  women  and  men,  and  environmental \nsustainability; \n\n                                                 \n26 Appendix 6 has details on the sequence between subprograms I and II. \n\n \n\n\f(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n(viii) \n\nincluding  budget  reforms \n\nfinancial  management \npublic \ndepartments as well as line agencies; \nintroduction of medium-term expenditure frameworks in state governments; \nsupport to outcome-based budgeting; \ndecentralization  and  assistance  for  procurement  services  for  modernizing \ngovernment and fiscal reforms; \ntax administration reforms; and  \ncomputerization  of  treasuries  and  other  financial  management  as  well  as  tax \nadministration processes. \n\nin  state \n\nfinance \n\n10. \n\nRationale \n\n \n43. \nCoordination among development partners in these and other activities is done through \ncentral  processing  of  all  external  assistance  by  the  Department  of  Economic  Affairs  in  the \nGovernment, as well as through consultation between the ADB India Resident Mission and the \nother  funding  agencies  in  India.  The  level  of  coordination  existing  among  the  development \npartners with respect to subprogram II is evident in support from the Government and the ADB \nmission  through  readiness  to  provide  funds  for  preparation  and  successful  execution  of \nsubprogram II. \n \n \n \nUnder subprogram I, various reforms were undertaken by the government of Assam to \n44. \nimprove governance and better manage available resources. Through fiscal reforms, including \napproval  of  an  MTFP  and  introduction  of  the  FRBM  Act,  the  profile  of  fiscal  imbalances  was \nimproved  and  a  large  revenue  deficit  has  been  converted  into  a  surplus  in  recent  years.  The \nefforts  towards  revenue  augmentation  have  included  introducing  VAT  in  2005,  broadening  the \ntax  base,  and  introducing  an  ad  valorem  excise  duty  structure  on  IMFL  with  a  consequent \nincrease  in  excise  duty  collection  of  11%  in  2006.  For  increasing  revenue  collection  in  areas \nsuch  as  VAT,  excise  duty,  motor  vehicle  tax,  and  forest  produce  levies,  subprogram  I  reform \nmeasures  introduced  composite  checkposts  at  the  main  entry  and  exit  points  on  the  trading \nroutes with neighboring states, which led to cross-verification of information as well as reduced \nstoppage time for the trucks at the checkposts.  \n \n45.  With regard to debt and expenditure, the debt recording and management system was \nput in place, operation and maintenance (O&M) expenditure targets consistent with the updated \nMTFP  were  approved,  and  two  key  MISs  were  established.  Moreover,  closure  of  eight  PSEs \nwas  notified  and  50%  of  the  required  compensation  disbursement  for  the  VRS  was  paid  to \nemployees of PSEs identified for closure. \n \n46. \nDespite  reforms  attained  under  subprogram  I,  given  the  fiscal  pressure  that  the \ngovernment  of  Assam  is  still  facing  due  to  an  increase  in  the  pension  bill  and  impending \nimplementation of the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations, the rationale of subprogram II \nis contained in the urgent need to concentrate on reform initiatives in the areas of (i) increasing \ntax \nthrough  capacity  building  and \nrevenue  administration \nimplementation  of  ICT-based  systems;  (ii) improving  expenditure  management  through  the \ngradual introduction of outcome-based budgeting, O&M expenditure estimating, and additional \nclosure of loss-generating PSEs; and (iii) developing a centralized debt management system to \ninclude contingent liabilities. The program reforms will allow greater fiscal space, thus enabling \nthe  government  of  Assam  to  allocate  more  resources  to  much-needed  social  and  economic \ninfrastructure.  This  will,  in  turn,  promote  private  sector  investment,  thus  leading  to  income \ngeneration and  higher employment.  Moreover,  given  that  youth  unemployment  has  historically \n\nrevenue  via  strengthened \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nbeen  a  major  contributor  to  social  unrest  in  Assam,  creating  greater  fiscal  space  will  help  to \nresolve the unrest problem.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nImpact and Outcomes \n\n \n47. \nThe  fiscal  reforms  embarked  upon  under  subprogram  I  have  put  state  finances  on  a \npositive path of increased revenue, controlled expenditure, debt restructuring leading to optimal \ndebt  servicing  costs,  and  limiting  the  fiscal  drain  on  state  finances  of  PSEs.  The  design  of \nsubprogram II is based on the lessons learned during subprogram I, the current fiscal situation \nin Assam, areas of policy progress where the implementation of policies needs to be pursued, \nand  key  implementation-oriented  actions  that  will  lead  to  tangible  improvements  in  areas  of \nrevenue administration, expenditure and debt management, and PSE financial closure.  \n \nA. \n \n48. \nThe proposed subprogram II is in keeping with national and international experience and \nthe government of Assam\u2019s own stated outcomes on good fiscal management in its FRBM Act. \nThe  impact  of  subprogram  II  is  to  achieve  improved  financial  flexibility  of  the  government  of \nAssam through controlled deficits and better fiscal management. It is expected to contribute to \neconomic growth through greater investments in social and economic infrastructure, leading to \nemployment opportunities and ultimately social peace and harmony.  \n \n49. \nThe  policy  actions  supported  by  subprogram  II  will  lead  to  the  consolidation  of  fiscal \nreforms in order to further improve the fiscal position of the government of Assam, as reflected \nin  the  development  policy  letter  and  policy  matrix  (Appendix  5).  The  key  end-of-program \noutcomes will include (i) increased tax revenues as a result of efficient revenue administration; \n(ii)  expenditures  prioritized  to  allow  greater  allocation  for  investments  in,  and  maintenance  of, \nassets;  (iii)  savings  in  debt  servicing  costs  as  a  result  of  strengthened  debt  management \ncapacities and consolidated policy procedures; and (iv) better mitigation of fiscal risk originating \nfrom selected loss-generating PSEs and further steps towards financial closure and initiation of \nthe legal closure process for PSEs notified for closure by getting the statutory audits completed \nand initiating liquidation of assets.  \n \n50. \n \n\nThese outcomes will be reflected in, and monitored through, \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\ncontinued  adherence  to  deficit  targets  prescribed  in  the  FRBM  Act  beyond \nFY2008, and possibly a surplus on the revenue account; \nprogressively improving own revenue\u2013GSDP ratio; \nprogressively increasing investments in assets as a percentage of GSDP; \nstable debt servicing cost to GSDP ratio; and  \nprogressively  reducing  budgetary  support  for  PSEs  and  reduced  contingent \nliabilities  on  account  of  guarantees  issued  by  the  government  of  Assam  for \nborrowings by the PSEs. \n\nOutputs  \n\n \nB. \n \n51. \nTo  achieve  the  outcomes  described,  the  government  of  Assam  has  declared  and \nexhibited political commitment to undertake fiscal reforms for sustainable fiscal balance through \nrationalization  of  its  exposure  to  PSEs,  tax  policy  and  administration  reforms,  and  continued \nimproved  expenditure  management  by  adopting  the  defined  contribution  pension  scheme  and \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nlimiting  public  sector  recruitment.  Subprogram  II  will  support  the  achievement  of  results  in  the \nfollowing four areas.27 \n \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: Efficient Revenue Administration \n\n \n52. \nUnder subprogram I, the principal objectives in the area of revenue administration were \nbroadening  the  tax  base  (through  transparent  and  efficient  implementation  of  taxes)  and \nenhancing  revenue  collection  (through  institutional  measures  to  check  leakages  and  evasion). \nUnder  subprogram  II,  the  focus  will  be  on  strengthening  the  tax  administration  processes \nthrough  implementation  of  ICT-based  systems  and  actual  implementation  of  policy  measures \nadopted under subprogram I. The key outputs being targeted under the revenue administration \noutcome are given in the following paragraphs.   \n \n53. \nValue-Added  Tax. Multi-point, destination-based ad valorem VAT, in lieu of the Assam \ngeneral  sales  tax,  was  introduced  by  the  government  of  Assam  in  May  2005  along  with  other \nstates  in  the  country,  as  a  result  of  a  consensus  forged  among  the  states  with  active \ninvolvement  of  the  Government.  In  terms  of  broadening  the  tax  base  of  sales  or  VAT,  the \nnumber  of  registered  dealers  in  Assam  increased  from  about  48,000  in  March  2005  (the  first \nyear of subprogram I) to about 75,860 in March 2007, and 82,300 in September 2007. The audit \nof  VAT  returns  assumes  greater  importance  in  a  VAT  regime  as  VAT  is  based  on  self-\nassessment.  With  the  limited  experience  of  tax  administration  officials  in  undertaking  audits, \ncombined with the increase in the number of registered dealers and consequent larger number \nof  tax  files,  addressing  this  issue  assumes  importance.  The  proposed  program  will  need  to \naddress the issues of (i) instituting standardized procedures for VAT audits, (ii) moving towards \nelectronic tax filing to address the problem of entering large number of returns in the TIMS, and \n(iii) greater focus on servicing and auditing large taxpayers who contribute the majority of VAT \nrevenue. In addition, reforms in VAT implementation will need to be harmonized with the goods \nand services tax, scheduled to be introduced in April 2010, without major modification to existing \nprocedures and applications.  \n \nSubprogram II will thus support finalization and implementation of an audit manual28 for \n54. \nVAT that will provide (i) a standardized tool for undertaking audits by tax administration officials, \nand (ii) criteria for selection of tax files to be audited. It will also support changes in the tax filing \nrequirements  to  ease  the  burden  of  the  number  of  tax  returns  to  be  entered  into  the  TIMS  as \nwell  as  allowing  tax  administration  officials  to  focus  on  larger  taxpayers.  A  large  taxpayer  unit \nwill be set up, on a pilot basis, to focus on the small number of large taxpayers who contribute \nthe majority of the taxes.  \n \n55. \nThe  ICT-based  TIMS  was  introduced  during  subprogram  I.  The  systems  requirement \nspecifications  and  application  software  of  the  TIMS,  on  which  the  main  operational  modules \nwere developed, were, however, predicated on the sales tax regime. Moreover, more modules \nwill  need  to  be  updated  in  order  to  improve  the  functionality  of  the  TIMS.  The  greatest \n\n                                                 \n27  The outputs and performance targets of subprogram II are in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n28 The  VAT  Act provides  for  submission  of  periodic  returns  by  registered  dealers  and  these  returns  are  crucial  in  a \nself-assessed tax regime. The audit manual will include (i) period of the returns based on an assessment of the tax \nyield  of  individual  bands  of  dealers,  (ii)  quick  audit  of  all  returns  with  some  objectives  (e.g.,  timely  submission \nreturns  including  non-filer  and  stop-filer  classification,  calculation  accuracy  including  application  of  correct  rates, \ndeviations  from  past  trends  of  reported  taxable  turnover,  and  input  tax  credit  claims;  (iii)  determination  of  risks \nassociated with specific business activities and dealer profiles. and (v) distribution of the audit functions among the \nfield and headquarters staff. \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nimplementation  efforts  to  be  supported  by  subprogram  II  will  be  upgrading  of  TIMS  to  enable, \namong other things, the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nupgrading  the  system,  keeping  in  view  the  impending  implementation  of  the \ngoods and services tax regime; \ne-filing of VAT returns; \ne-filing of motor vehicle data; \ninterfacing  between  TIMS  and \ninformation system; \nmaking  an  audit  module  in  the  TIMS  operational,  including  completion  of \nhistorical return data entry; and \nproviding online taxpayer services. \n\ntreasury  management \n\nthe  computerized \n\n \n56. \nExcise  Tax.  Among  the  constraints  affecting  excise  duty  in  Assam,  subprogram  I \nhighlighted  those  flowing  from  inadequacy  of  border  controls,  the  system  of  specific  levies  on \nIMFL  based  on  a  wide  range  of  administrative  parameters  (such  as  brand  and  strength),  and \nomnipresent departmental controls on production, transport, and retail outlets under a system of \nfixed vendor and license fees for country spirits. It is clear that the emphasis on border controls \nwas based primarily on the reported lower rates of excise duties on similar varieties of liquor in \nneighboring states. \n \n57. \nThe policy matrix of subprogram I and actions therein stipulated the commitment of the \ngovernment  of  Assam  to  include,  in  the  approved  revenue  policy  guidelines,  excise  policy \nreforms  by  way  of  alternative  methods  of  levy  and  collection  of  excise  duties.  This  was  to  be \nfollowed by legislative changes to convert specific excise duties on IMFL to ad valorem levies, \nand to similarly replace the fixed fee licenses with an alternative method of collection of excise \nduties on country spirits. In terms of implementation of these reforms, the government of Assam \nmodified  the  rules  relating  to  excise  duty  rates  on  IMFL  in  September  2005  and  prescribed \nspecific rates of duty based on normative cost brands for IMFL. In respect of reforms in the duty \nregime and collection methods for country spirits, it is understood that the government of Assam \nhas notified an auction-based system for awarding licenses of country spirit shops. With regard \nto  border  control,  composite  checkposts  have  been  notified  at  three  locations, 29 which  are \nreported to have provided surveillance of excisable goods. \n \n58. \nIn  view  of  the  government  of  Assam\u2019s  auction-based  system  for  awarding  licenses  of \ncountry  spirit  shops,  subprogram  II  will  support  the  government  of  Assam  in  ensuring  that  the \nauctions  adhere  to  generally  accepted  levels  of  transparency  and  accountability.  In  particular, \nthe  TA  will  support  the  government  of  Assam  in  preparing  the  framework  and  guidelines  for \nthese auctions based on best practices. Subprogram II also supports the implementation of an \nad valorem duty structure for IMFL on a percentage basis on the maximum retail price in order \nto continuously address the issue of loss of revenue due to price movements.  \n \n59. \nStamp  Duty,  Registration  Fees,  and  Land  Revenue.  In  subprogram  I,  it  was \nhighlighted that the stamp duty and registration fees have not grown commensurately with the \nincreasing  land  values  in  Assam.  It  identified  the  underlying  cause  as  being  the  system  of \nvaluation  of  properties  transacted  and  the  associated  high  rates  of  duty  that  result  in  heavy \n\n                                                 \n29  During  subprogram  I,  the  government  of  Assam  notified  composite  checkposts  in  Boxirhat,  Digarkhal,  and \nSrirampur. These checkposts are designed to enable the departments of excise, forest, transport, and taxation to \ncheck vehicles entering Assam at one place. Transporters save considerable time, tax collection becomes efficient, \nand interdepartmental coordination is facilitated. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\nundervaluation and consequent loss of revenue. The policy measures under subprogram I thus \nrequired the government of Assam to (i) approve and notify the use of OVM for properties, (ii) \nestablish valuation committees chaired by deputy commissioners of districts, and (iii) establish \nthe basis for the use of OVM.30 As the next step, preparatory work will be required before OVM \nis  actually  put  into  practice.  The  presently  notified  policy  guidelines  on  OVM  will  need  to  be \ndefined  with  (i)  the  specific  modalities  of  valuation,  (ii)  state  oversight  of  the  process,  and  (iii) \nharmonization of possible local (district-level) variations in the application of the methodology. \n \nSubprogram  II,  thus,  focuses  on  the  preparatory  work  required  for  making  OVM \n60. \nfunctional.  As  a  key  requirement  to  implementing  OVM,  subprogram  II  will  (i)  support  the \ncomprehensive computerization of land records in 21 districts (i.e., all Assam districts except the \ndistricts  under  autonomous  councils),  and  (ii)  computerization  of  the  property  registration \nprocess for the same 21 districts in the sub-registrars\u2019 offices. It will also support the preparation \nof  guidelines  at  the  central  level  for  OVM.  By  the  end  of  the  program  period,  a  pilot \ncomputerized  OVM  operation  in  at  least  one  sub-registrar\u2019s  office  will  be  in  place,  thus \neliminating human intervention in the valuation of properties for registration. This is expected to \n(i)  lead  to  greater  revenue  realization  by  way  of  stamp  duty  and  registration  fees,  as  well  as \nenhancement  of  transparency  and  governance;  and  (ii)  provide  a  basis  for  replicating  the \noperation into other sub-registrar\u2019s offices.  \n \nComposite  Checkposts.  For improving revenue collection of sales tax or VAT, excise \n61. \nduty, motor vehicle tax, and levies on forest produce, subprogram I envisaged (i) strengthening \nof composite checkposts at three main entry and exit points (such as Boxirhat, Digarkhal, and \nSrirampur)  on  the  trading  routes  between  Assam  and  other  states  in  the  northeastern  region, \nand  (ii)  building  up  a  composite  computerized  database  (covering  major  own-tax  sources)  at \nthese checkposts. This was based on the assumption that revenue losses were mostly due to \nthe other states in the region being \u201ctax havens\u201d. The above-mentioned checkposts have been \nnotified  during  FY2006.  The  checkposts  will  achieve  their  goals  upon  setting  up  of  the \ncomputerized  system  and  necessary  equipment  to  allow  for  building  up  of  the  database, \nfacilitating one-stop data capture for VAT, excise, motor vehicle tax, and forest produce levies \ninstead  of  the  current  four  stops  each  truck  has  to  undertake  for  each  data  capture.  This  is \nexpected  to  lead  to  cross-verification  of  information  as  well  as  reduced  stoppage  time  for  the \ntrucks at the checkposts.  \n \n62. \nSubprogram  II  thus  focuses  on  supporting  the  procurement,  installation,  and  use  of \nnecessary  facilities  and  equipment  for  the  composite  checkposts.  All  the  procurement  of \nfacilities and equipment in three checkposts will be completed and at least one checkpost will be \nmade comprehensively operational under subprogram II.   \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Prioritized Expenditure Management \n\n \n63. \nFollowing the enactment of the FRBM Act, the government of Assam has been able to \ncontrol  its  deficits  and  is  on  course  to  meet  the  targets  set  in  the  FRBM  Act  for  revenue  and \nfiscal  deficits\u2014revenue  deficit  of  0%  to  GSDP  and  fiscal  deficit  of  3%  of  GSDP.  Under \nsubprogram  I,  the  key  objectives  in  the  area  of  expenditure  management  were  (i)  limiting  the \ngrowth  rate  of  expenditure  by  limiting  the  committed  expenditure  on  pensions  and  salaries, \n(ii) improving the budget preparation and monitoring mechanisms, and (iii) increasing allocation \n\n                                                 \n30 For  this  purpose,  the  government  of  Assam  has  notified  the  policy  on  OVM  and  ordered  constitution  of  district \ncommittees  chaired  by  the  deputy  commissioners  of  the  districts.  The  committees  have  started  functioning  in \nseveral districts and have compiled basic data. \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nfor  O&M  expenditure  as  per  the  stipulations  under  the  MTFP.  Under  subprogram  II,  the  focus \nwill be on taking these reforms further by putting in place systems and procedures for the policy \nmeasures  adopted  under  subprogram  I  relating  to  expenditure  management.  The  key  outputs \nbeing  targeted  under  the  expenditure  management  outcome  area  are  given  in  the  following \nparagraphs. \n \n64. \nOutcome-Based  Budgeting.  Budgeting  in  state  governments  has  historically  been \nmore expenditure oriented than results oriented. Subprogram I thus focused on instituting better \nbudget  reporting  and  transparency  through  presentation  of  achievement  of  FRBM  targets,  or \nremedial action on key fiscal information, including contingent liabilities, off-budget borrowings, \narrears, PSE losses, and subsidy payments. The government of Assam has enacted the FRBM \nAct and has been presenting this information as part of FRBM compliance reports submitted in \nthe legislature. Subprogram II will focus on furthering the reforms in budgeting by supporting the \ninitiation of OBB, and, in doing so, will take into account the experiences of implementation over \nthe program period. Presently, the budget cycle is not linked to the achievement of the specified \noutcomes, but rather is driven by input-based line item budgeting.  \n \n65. \nRecognizing the drawbacks of this approach, the government of Assam\u2019s medium-term \nobjective is to move towards OBB, including full alignment (ex-ante and ex-post) with the budget \nnomenclature  (administrative,  economic,  and  functional  classification  and  corresponding \ncodification).31 As a first step in this reform process for FY2009, 10 administrative departments \nhave  been  directed  to  justify  budget  inputs  against  measurable  outputs.  Building  on  this,  the \ngovernment  of  Assam  will  subsequently  develop  and  issue  comprehensive  OBB  guidelines. \nFinally, and prior to implementation throughout Assam, the government of Assam will undertake \na  pilot  for  OBB  in  a  departmental  scheme.  Under  the  reform  initiative,  OBB  will  lead  to \nformulating  program  budgets  that  are  driven  by  a  number  of  desired  results  which  are  \narticulated  at  the  outset  of  the  budgetary  process,  and  against  which  actual  performance  is \nmeasured.32 Subprogram II will support the government of Assam in this process.  \n \n66. \nGreater  Allocation  for  Operation  and  Maintenance  Expenditure.  The  assets  of  the \ngovernment of Assam have deteriorated due to inadequate budget allocation for maintenance in \na  scenario  where  the  government  faced  financial  crisis  and  where  committed  expenditure \nconsumed  the  bulk  of  the  revenue.  The  focus  of  subprogram  I  was  the  prioritization  of \nexpenditure through detailed breakdown of expenditure in terms of revenue and capital heads, \nand  the  requirements  of  greater  budget  allocations  for  maintenance  in  accordance  with  the \nMTFP.  Subprogram  II  aims  at  putting  in  place  a  strategy\u2014through  a  strategy  document  and \nbudget guidelines\u2014to ensure sustainable allocation of O&M expenditure in all departments that \nundertake  capital  works.  Subprogram  II  will  also  support  actual  budget  allocation  for  O&M  as \nper  the  strategy  in  the  Department  of  Public  Works  (roads  and  buildings).  A  developed  state \nsuch  as  Gujarat  spent  3.1%  of  the  GSDP33 on  capital  outlay  in  FY2006,  while  Assam  spent \n2.23%  in  FY2006.  There  have  been  many  reform  initiatives  undertaken  by  other  states  in  this \nsector. For example, the government of Karnataka has introduced a mechanism through which \n\n                                                 \n31 Currently, alignment with budget nomenclature is done merely as an ex-post exercise by the State Directorate of \nEconomics and Statistics. In the government of Assam\u2019s nomenclature, the functional classification is referred to as \n\u201cpurpose classification\u201d. \n\n32 The  OBB  framework  will  involve  the  creation  of  a  logical  framework  made  up  of  six  components:  (i)  objectives, \n(ii) inputs,  (iii)  expected  results,  (iv)  outputs,  (v) performance  indicators,  and  (vi)  performance  measurement.  The \ndistinguishing feature of OBB is expected to be its primary focus on expected results and the use of performance \nindicators to measure the degree of achievement of the expected results. \n\n33 Source: Reserve Bank of India. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\n15%  of  the  planned  budget  can  be  utilized  for  repair  and  maintenance  activities  in  selected \nsocial and infrastructure sectors.34 \n \n67. \nCreation  of  Fixed  Asset  Registers.  There are inadequate accountability mechanisms \nin place in the asset-creating departments of state governments due to a lack of information on \nthe assets created by the departments. There has been an announcement of the intent of the \nGovernment to move to accrual-based accounting from cash-based accounting. Subprogram  I \nenvisaged  movement  towards  departmental  budget  performance  orientation.  Based  on  these \ndevelopments,  subprogram  II  envisages  supporting  the  creation  of  fixed  asset  registers  in  the \ndepartments  to  better  estimate  the  maintenance  expenditure  requirements  as  well  as  to \nfacilitate an eventual movement to accrual-based accounting. \n \nPensions  Liability  Management.  Pension liabilities of the government of Assam have \n68. \nbeen  increasing  over  the  years  with  an  aging  employee  population.  The  seriousness  of  the \nissue was compounded by the fact that the liability was unknown and unfunded. Subprogram I \nsupported  a  two-pronged  approach  to  address  the  issue  of  mounting  pension  liabilities.  First, \nthe  government  of  Assam  was  to  mitigate  the  liabilities  through  movement  from  the  current \ndefined benefit pension scheme to a defined contribution pension scheme for employees joining \nthe  government  after  1  February  2005.  Second,  the  government  was  to  create  an  employee \ndatabase  and  pensioners\u2019  database  to  enable  an  actuarial  valuation  of  pension  liabilities  of \nemployees who joined the government of Assam prior to 1 February 2005 and pensioners. This \nwas  to  enable  the  government  to  formulate  its  revenue  and  expenditure  policies  accordingly. \nThe  government  of  Assam  has  since  adopted  the  defined  contribution  pension  scheme.  The \ngovernment  has  also  included  in  the  budget  for  FY2008  its  contribution  to  the  defined \ncontribution  pension  scheme.  The  employees\u2019  database,  pensioners\u2019  database,  and  the \nvaluation  of  pension  liabilities  have  been  finalized  and  will  form  the  basis  for  future  reform \nactions.      \n \n69.  While the defined contribution pension scheme is currently in place, the government of \nAssam  has  neither  made  contributions  to  the  scheme  for  the  employees  who  joined  the \ngovernment  after  1  February  2005  nor  deducted  contributions  from  the  salary  of  those \nemployees. For the defined contribution pension scheme to function effectively, which includes \nmaking  use  of  the  fund  managers  identified  under  the  Government  of  India  pension  scheme, \nthere  should  be  an  agreement  between  the  government  of  Assam  and  those  fund  managers. \nSubprogram II supports the government of Assam\u2019s implementation of the defined contribution \npension scheme. The agreement is for the use of these fund managers for managing the funds \ncontributed  by  the  government  of  Assam  and  its  employees  under  the  scheme.  Second,  the \ngovernment  of  Assam  should  have  an  arrangement  with  the  employees  with  respect  to  the \nexisting  arrears  of  the  employees\u2019  contribution  to  the  scheme.  Counterpart  funds  generated \nfrom  the  loan  will  provide  support  to  the  government  of  Assam  in  meeting  the  arrears  in  its \ncontributions  under  the  defined  contribution  pension  scheme  for  employees  joining  the \ngovernment after 1 February 2005.   \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Strengthened Debt Management \n\n \n70. \nUnder  subprogram  I,  the  government  of  Assam  has  significantly  reduced  its  debt \nservicing costs through one-time settlements of outstanding loan repayments and interest dues \nwith its lenders. It has also undertaken debt swaps of high-cost loans from the Government. The \n\n                                                 \n34 Ram, N. Gokul. Bangalore: Karnataka Government Secretariat (21 November 2006). Guidelines for Classification \n\nof Expenditure for the Eleventh Five-Year Plan 2007\u20132012. http://www.kar.nic.in/finance/fd21bpe2006.pdf \n\n\f \n\n19\n\ngovernment  of  Assam  also  benefited  from  the  consolidation  of  central  government  loans  with \nthe revised interest rate of 7% per annum as a result of its enacting the FRBM Act following the \nrecommendations of the TFC. Another significant achievement is the establishment of the debt \nmanagement  cell  and  the  installation  of  the  debt  recording  and  management  system  that  has \ncaptured all the direct liability of the government of Assam in the system. The government has \nalso  limited  the  volume  of  guarantees  it  can  provide  for  borrowings  by  its  agencies  under  the \nFRBM Act.  \n \nDebt  Management.  However,  the  function  of  debt  management  is  fragmented  across \n71. \nvarious  departments  and  agencies  with  no  central  consolidation  of  data  on  outstanding  loans \nand  debt  servicing  obligation  projections.  Another  aspect  that  is  weak  in  the  government  of \nAssam is the process of issuance of guarantees and the lack of centralized information on the \noutstanding guarantees.  \n \n72. \nUnder  subprogram  II,  the  government  of  Assam  will  focus  on  consolidating  these \ndevelopments with strengthening the debt management unit with full-time staff, and building the \ncapacity  of  that  staff.  It  will  also  support  the  standardization  of  processes  and  procedures  by \npreparing a debt management policy and procedural manual. The debt reconciliation work will \nbe  advanced  through  reconciliation  of  outstanding  government  of  Assam  loans  from  the \nadministrative ministries of the central government.35  \n \n73.  Management  of  Guarantees.  Subprogram  I  focused  on  consolidating  the  information \non  all  guarantees  issued  by  the  government  of  Assam  against  the  borrowings  by  PSEs. \nSubprogram  II  will  focus  on  ensuring  that  suitable  guidelines  are  adopted  with  respect  to  the \nissuance of guarantees in order to control spiraling guarantees. It will also support the setting up \nof  the  Guarantee  Redemption  Fund  as  a  mechanism  for  addressing  liabilities  arising  from \nenforcement of guarantees against the government of Assam.  \n \n\n4. \n\nComponent 4: Closure of Public Sector Enterprises  \n\n \n74. \nThe state\u2019s PSEs have historically been a fiscal drag on its finances. There are 48 PSEs \nin Assam, of which 33 are companies, 8 are cooperatives, and 7 are statutory bodies. The PSEs \nhave  historically  been  known  for  not  keeping  up-to-date  audited  accounts.  At  the  time  of \ninitiation of the AGPRM, there was no information available for 15 PSEs, and there was some \ninformation but no accounts for 14 PSEs. Thus, for 60% of the PSEs, the reliance on available \nfinancial  information  was  limited.  Of  the  remaining  19  PSEs,  15  had  provisional  accounts  and \nthere  were  only  four  PSEs  where  audited  accounts  were  available.  The  salary  dues  of  the \nemployees  of  the  inoperative  PSEs  continued  to  grow  as  a  contingent  liability  for  the \ngovernment of Assam. The PSEs regularly defaulted on the loans taken by them and that also \nled to the build-up of the contingent liability on the government of Assam.36  \n \n\n                                                 \n35  Some outstanding loans of the government of Assam from the Government of India remain to be reconciled  with \n\nthe relevant government ministries.  \n\n36 The government of Assam\u2019s total contingent liability is around Rs8 billion. Moreover, the government of Assam has \nenacted clear guidelines for issuing guarantees in the FRBM Act. There are two such provisions such as (i) restrict \nthe  total  debt  stock  of  the  government  of  Assam  including  the  government  guarantee  to  45%  of  GSDP  of  the \nprevious year at current prices within a period of 5 years beginning on the 1 April 2005; and (ii) the government of \nAssam  guarantee  for  the  loan  contracted  by  PSEs,  boards,  companies,  corporations,  cooperative  societies  or \nautonomous  organizations  under  the  government  of  Assam,  shall  be  restricted  at  any  point  of  time  to  50%  of \nstate\u2019s  own  tax  and  nontax  revenue  of  the  previous  year  or  5%  of  the  GSDP  of  previous  year  at  current  prices, \nwhichever is lower. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\nAgainst this backdrop, under subprogram I the government of Assam notified the closure \n75. \nof  eight  loss-making  PSEs  and  provided  some  compensation  to  the  employees  of  the  PSEs \nnotified for closure. It also announced a one-time settlement of outstanding debt repayments of \nthese PSEs to stop the growth of salary dues. Moreover, subprogram I instituted a social safety \nnetwork for the employees of those PSEs that were notified for closure.  \n \n76. \nSubprogram  II  focuses  on  advancing  the  PSE  closure  process  through  notification  of \nmore inoperative PSEs for closure and the government of Assam has notified three more PSEs \nfor  closure.  In  this  respect,  the  government  of  Assam  will  set  up  a  taskforce  to  (i)  implement \nPSE  closure;  (ii)  implement  and  monitor  labor  rehabilitation  plans  for  employees  of  PSEs \nnotified  for  closure,  including  implementation  of  the  social  safety  net;  (iii)  complete  VRS \ncompensation  disbursement  for  employees  of  PSEs  notified  for  closure;  and  (iv)  retrain \nemployees of PSEs notified for closure (including public dissemination of training opportunities). \nSubprogram  II  will  support  the  completion  of  compensation  for  employees  of  the  12  PSEs \nnotified  for  closure,  which  includes  salary  dues  and  VRS  compensation  as  well  as  statutory \ndues of the PSEs notified for closure.37 The assets of those PSEs are required to be liquidated \nas part of the process of achieving legal closure. Subprogram II will support the initiation of the \nlegal  closure  process  of  the  PSEs  through  setting  up  of  an  asset  management  cell  (AMC)  to \nundertake  the  valuation  and  subsequent  liquidation  of  assets  of  the  PSEs  notified  for  closure. \nSubprogram  II  will  support  achievement  of  legal  closure  of  the  PSEs  through  (i)  getting  the \naccounts of the PSEs updated, (ii) completing statutory audits for the PSEs notified for closure, \nand (iii) liquidating assets of the closed PSEs through institution of the AMC. \n \n77. \nThe  institutional  arrangements  for  implementing  further  reform  actions  related  to  the \nPSEs  notified  for  closure  include  a  high-level  taskforce  for  the  implementation  of  accepted \ndecisions  taken  on  PSE  reform  proposals  in  a  systematic  manner.  It  is  proposed  that  the \ntaskforce  would  have  three  permanent  members,  such  as  the  principal  secretaries  of  the \nDepartment  of  Public  Enterprise,  the  Finance  Department,  and  the  Revenue  Department.  A \nfourth member will be co-opted in the form of principal secretary of the relevant administrative \ndepartment  for  the  PSE  concerned.  The  principal  secretary  of  the  Department  of  Public \nEnterprise will be the chairperson of the taskforce and the secretarial work will be done by the \nDepartment  of  Public  Enterprise.  Another  institutional  arrangement  is  that  an  AMC  will  be \nformed. It will hire specialists with the aim of managing custody and security of assets of closed \nPSEs until their disposal, and also assist the taskforce in undertaking other related tasks. The \ncomposition of the AMC will be decided by the taskforce based on the emerging requirements \non a case-by-case basis for liquidation of PSE assets. The AMC will be physically established in \nthe  Assam  Industrial  Development  Corporation  (AIDC) 38  and  will  utilize  the  available \ninfrastructure of the AIDC to efficiently discharge its functions. However, the AMC will report to \nthe taskforce and will not be under the administrative control of the AIDC.  \n \nC. \n \n78. \nOne of the important features of subprogram II is that consideration has been given to \nreform  phasing  and  sequencing  in  order  to  enhance  the  links  between  subprogram  I  and \nsubprogram  II.  First,  this  is  evident  in  areas  such  as  the  legislative  and  regulatory  reforms \ncombined with enhanced institutional and human resource capacities, which now move to actual \n\nImportant Features of Subprogram II \n\n                                                 \n37 The statutory dues include statutory audit fees, taxes, duties, and other outstanding levies. \n38  The  Assam  Industrial  Development  Corporation  (AIDC)  is  a  public  sector  enterprise  which  reports  to  the \nDepartment  of  Industries  and  Commerce  and  targets  at  improving  the  industrial  activities  and  environment  of \nAssam. The facilities of the AIDC will be used by the AMC to implement its mandate and tasks. \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nFinancing Plan \n\nimplementation  of  these  reform  initiatives  in  various  fields,  including  composite  checkposts, \ndistricts,  and  sub-registrars'  offices.  Second,  subprogram  II  targets  upgrading  the  MIS  and \nenhancing  the  interface  between  the  tax  MIS  and  treasury  MIS,  including  pilot  operation  of \nreform initiatives such as on land records, property registration, and e-filing. All these measures \nwill lead to increased efficiency and transparency, thus contributing to good governance. Third, \nsubprogram II also addresses institutional capacity limitations within the government of Assam \nby  sequencing  institutional  and  human  resource  capacity  building  prior  to  pilot  operation  of \nreform initiatives in various areas.   \n \nD. \n \n79. \nProgram  Loan  Amount,  Terms,  and  Conditions.  The  government  of  Assam  has \nrequested  a  loan  of  $100 million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help \nfinance  subprogram  II.  The  loan  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 \nyears,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement. The Government of India will relend the local currency generated from the \nproceeds of the loan to the government of Assam. The relending will be in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s arrangement for transfer of external assistance to the government of Assam, and \nit will be treated as additional to the central government transfers allocated annually to the state \nof  Assam.39 The  Government  of  India  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk.  Subprogram  II  loan \nproceeds  are  expected  to  be  utilized  over  3  years  from  the  date  of  loan  effectiveness.  The \nGovernment  of  India  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. \n \nProgram  Cost.  Subprogram  II  will  contribute  to  overall  adjustment  costs  for  the \n80. \ngovernment  of  Assam,  and  among  the  reform  initiatives  of  the  government  of  Assam,  the \nestimates  for  the  four  main  components  are  (i)  payments  relating  to  closure  of  12  PSEs  with \naround  4,950  employees  for  the  VRS  and  related  compensation,  liquidation  of  liabilities,  and \nstatutory  dues  of  these  PSEs  ($120  million);  (ii)  the  government's  contribution  to  the  defined \ncontribution pensions scheme for employees joining the government after 1 February 2005 ($22 \nmillion);  (iii)  the  guarantee  redemption  fund  ($12  million);  and  (iv)  O&M  for  a  public  works \ndepartment ($17 million). A summary of the government of Assam overall cost adjustment is set \nout in Appendix 7.  \n \nE. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n \n81. \nThe  government  of  Assam  will  be  responsible  for  the  effective  administration  and \nutilization of subprogram II loan proceeds and the counterpart funds. The program reforms will \nbe  implemented  with  the  support  of  a  program  steering  committee.  The  program  steering \ncommittee  will  be  responsible  for  overall  coordination,  implementation,  monitoring,  and  policy \napprovals. The committee will be chaired by a senior official not below the rank of the principal \nsecretary  of  the  government  of  Assam,  and  will  include  all  secretaries  of  participating \n\n                                                 \n39 The Government of India explicitly recognized Assam\u2019s unique geographic, natural, and exogenous constraints on \nits capacity to develop by granting special category state status and extending assistance to government of Assam. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n \n\ndepartments.  The  Finance  Department  will  continue  to  work  as  the  Executing  Agency  for \nsubprogram II. \n \n82. \nThe  fiscal  management  unit  (FMU),  established  in  the  Finance  Department  under \nsubprogram  I,  will  continue  to  coordinate  the  fiscal  management  reforms  envisaged  under \nsubprogram  II,  and  will  be  responsible  for  daily  implementation  of  subprogram  II  under  the \nguidance  of  the  program  steering  committee.  The  FMU  will  coordinate  with  ADB  and  various \nstakeholders  towards  achievement  of  the  actions  envisaged  under  subprogram  II.  The  debt \nmanagement  unit,  established  in  the  Finance  Department  under  subprogram  I,  will  be \nreorganized with dedicated full-time staff and one external advisor.40 An AMC will be established \nin the AIDC to estimate and manage the assets of the selected PSEs notified for closure, and to \nliquidate assets of selected PSEs. The program implementation schedule is in Appendix 8.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProgram Period and Tranching \n\n \n83. \nThe  reforms  supported  under  subprogram  II  are  expected  to  be  completed  in  3  years, \nfrom October 2008 to September 2011. Subprogram II will be meaningful through application of \nOBB, implementation of various reforms on a pilot basis initiated under subprogram I, such as \n(i) O&M expenditures and budget allocation and completion of fixed asset registers in selected \ndepartments, (ii) operation of the computerized OVM in selected sub-registrar\u2019s offices, and (iii) \nmaking the large taxpayer unit and e-filing operational. It is expected that the operation of these \nvarious policy reforms will be replicated easily in other departments and other districts in order \nto secure ongoing reform initiatives after the completion of subprogram II.   \n \nThe  loan  will  be  released  in  three  tranches:  (i)  $40  million  for  the  first  tranche,  (ii)  $40 \n84. \nmillion for the second tranche, and (iii) $20 million for the third tranche.41 The first tranche will be \nreleased  upon  satisfaction  of  all  agreed  conditions  for  the  first  tranche  and  following \neffectiveness  of  the  loan.  The  second  tranche  will  be  released  upon  satisfaction  of  all  agreed \nconditions for the second tranche, estimated to be within 12 months of the first tranche release. \nThe third tranche will be released upon satisfaction of all agreed conditions for the third tranche, \nestimated to be within 18 months of the second tranche release.   \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n \n85. \nThe proceeds of the subprogram loan will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs \n(excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB  member \ncountries, excluding ineligible items listed in Appendix 9 and imports financed by other bilateral \nand multilateral sources.  \n \n86. \nIn  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures \nand  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans  (1998),42 the  proceeds  of  the  subprogram  loan \nwill be disbursed to the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required but loan \nproceeds will be disbursed on the basis of certification provided by the Borrower for a period of \n\n                                                 \n40  To be recruited for 12 months under the AGPRM program loan in subprogram II.  \n41  Prior to the release of the third tranche, the government of Assam is required to apply $72 million from the first and \nsecond tranches for VRS and related compensation, and $8 million from the second tranche for the government of \nAssam\u2019s contribution to the defined contribution pension scheme. This is to ensure support for the two components \nof the government of Assam\u2019s reform initiatives that require substantial financial allocation from the government of \nAssam and support from subprogram II.  \n\n42 ADB.  1998.

For  each  tranche,  when  subprogram  loan  proceeds  are \nexpected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  total  imports  minus  (i)  imports  from  nonmember \ncountries,  (ii)  ineligible  imports,  and  (iii)  imports  financed  under  other  official  development \nassistance,  will  be  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  expected  to  be  disbursed  during  such \nyear.  \n \n\n4. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nThe  local  currency  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  used  to  finance \n87. \nadjustment  costs  under  subprogram  II,  including  compensation  for  employees  of  the  12  PSEs \nnotified  for  closure  (which  includes  salary  dues  and  VRS  compensation),  the  government  of \nAssam\u2019s  arrears  in  contributions  to  the  defined  contribution  pension  scheme,  the  guarantee \nredemption fund, and O&M budget allocation for a public works department on a pilot basis.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  the  Second  Governance \n88. \nand  Anticorruption  Action  Plan 43 was  explained  to,  and  discussed  with,  the  government  of \nAssam  and  the  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency,  implementation  of  subprogram  II  shall  adhere  to  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy. \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  review  and  examine,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  subprogram  II.  In  this  regard, \ninvestigation of government officials, if any, would be requested by ADB to be undertaken by the \nGovernment.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are \nincluded  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with subprogram II shall include provisions specifying \nthe right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to subprogram II. \n \n89. \nADB affirms that corrupt behavior is a serious hindrance to the development process. It \nrejects the argument that corruption\u2019s beneficial effects outweigh its negative consequences, or \nthat it is inappropriate for international financial institutions to address such issues. ADB notes \nthat  experience  drawn  from  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region  and  elsewhere  demonstrates  that \nsignificant progress can be made against corruption if the proper legal, institutional, and policy \nreforms are in place. ADB welcomes the growing focus upon anticorruption issues as part of its \nbroader  effort  to  advance  the  principles  of  transparency,  predictability,  accountability,  and \nparticipation under its governance policy. At the broadest level, ADB\u2019s stance on anticorruption \nissues is intended to reduce the burden that widespread, systemic corruption exacts upon the \neconomies  of  the  region  and  the  development  of  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries.  In \nkeeping  with  Article  36(2)  of  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,44 ADB \ninitiatives  regarding  corruption  will  be  grounded  solely  upon  economic  considerations  and \nconcerns of sound development management. They will not involve interference in the political \naffairs of a developing member country or be influenced by its political character. \n \nAs part of program preparation, a governance risk assessment was conducted along the \n90. \nlines  prescribed  by  the  implementation  of  the  second  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action \nPlan.  The  risk  assessment  identified  a  number  of  governance  and  corruption  risks  that  could \nimpact on subprogram II. The identified risks can be categorized as those that are (i) exogenous \n\n                                                 \n43 ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n \n\nto  the  state  (such  as  central  policy  changes,  delays  in  specific  initiatives,  and  exposure  to \ninternational  market  risks),  (ii)  within  the  state  machinery  (such  as  low  capacity  within \ngovernment agencies, weak internal accountability mechanisms, and risk of policy reversal), or \n(iii)  specifically  program-related  (such  as  the  risk  of  dispersion  of  state  functions  in  fiscal \nmanagement, potential proliferation of adjustment costs of PSE closures, and gaps in relevant \nrules and regulations). The identified risks vary, but the one type I risk (one that requires urgent \nattention  and  needs  to  be  addressed  prior  to  providing  any  support)  is  currently  managed  in \nselected  departments  through  the  technical  assistance  and  capacity-building  support  provided \nunder  subprogram  I.  Government  commitment  to  the  program  has  been  publicly  reinforced, \nincluding  through  the  budget  speech,  and  is  not  seen  as  a  risk.  For  further  risk  analysis,  see \nAppendix 11 and Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n91. \nThe central and state governments will maintain records of accounts. To ensure proper \nfund  management,  ADB  retains  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  program  loan  proceeds.  The \naccounts  will  be  managed,  operated,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  terms  satisfactory  to \nADB. The FMU in the Finance Department will send quarterly progress reports to ADB on policy \nand  institutional  reforms  implementation.  The  reports  will  describe  progress  made  in \nsubprogram  II  and  any  changes  to  the  implementation  schedule,  and  will  also  identify  any \nproblems encountered and remedial actions taken.  \n \n\n7. \n\nProgram Monitoring and Tranching \n\n \nADB will monitor program implementation through periodic progress reports and will field \n92. \nregular missions to (i) confirm fulfillment of policy actions for tranche release; (ii) confirm release \nof adequate funds from the government of Assam for program activities; (iii) monitor continued \napplicability  of  the  assumptions  that  might  impact  program  success,  such  as  on  political \nconditions,  as  well  as  on  specified  risks  and  their  mitigating  measures;  and  (iv)  advise  on \nactions  to maintain  effective  implementation  within  the  program  period.  The  program  loan  has \nthree  tranches  which  will  be  released  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with  respective  policy \nconditions. \n \n\n8. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n  \n93. \nThe FMU will operate a system to monitor and evaluate the performance of subprogram \nII  that  will  use  the  targets,  indicators,  assumptions,  and  risks  in  the  policy  matrix  and  the \nprogram framework. The FMU will submit quarterly reports to the program steering committee, \nand  these  will  also  be  made  available  to  ADB.  Not  later  than  3  months  after  program \ncompletion,  the  government  of  Assam  will  provide  ADB  with  a  program  report,  including  an \nassessment of overall program performance. The government of Assam and ADB will carry out \nperiodic reviews of subprogram II based on reports and other documents, and such reviews will \ninclude tracking the fiscal indicators under the MTFP. TA will be provided to the government of \nAssam by ADB, and this will enhance institutional capacity building in order to assist the reform \ninitiatives, including full compliance with tranche-related conditions. \n\n \n9. \n\nProgram Review \n\n \nThe  government  of  Assam  and  ADB  will  undertake  comprehensive  midterm  reviews  of \n94. \nsubprogram II 3 months prior to the scheduled release of the second and third tranche funds. \nimplementation \nThe  midterm  review  will  (i)  review \n\nthe  program  scope,  design,  and \n\n\f \n\n25\n\narrangements;  (ii)  assess  implementation  performance  against  program  conditions  and \ncovenants; and (iii) identify problems and constraints. The midterm reviews will be based on the \nassessment report to be prepared by the consultants under the associated TA program. If the \nmidterm  review  determines  that  changes  are  required  in  program  implementation,  the \ngovernment  of  Assam  and  ADB  will  agree  on  measures,  including  changes  in  implementation \narrangements, to ensure that the program obligations are met.  \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n95. \nThe  primary  objective  of  the  TA  will  be  to  support  the  key  institutions  responsible  for \nreform  programs  across  various  activities  to  improve  fiscal  management  performance.  The \nsecondary objective of the TA will be to support the government of Assam to comply with all the \npolicy  matrix  conditions  under  the  program  loan.  The  specific  areas  to  be  covered  under  the \nterms  of  reference  of  the  TA  include  strengthening  capacity  and  professional  skills  at  the \nFinance Department, the Department of Public Enterprises, the Department of Commercial Tax, \nthe AMC, and other government institutions linked to fiscal management reforms.  \n \n96. \nThe  Finance  Department  will  be  the  EA  for  the  TA.  Support  will  also  be  provided  to \nimplementing agencies to enable them to attain the policy reforms and actions that are specified \nin the policy matrix. In particular, TA support will be provided in the following areas: (i) revenue \nadministration,  (ii)  debt  management  and  expenditure  prioritization;  (iii)  PSE  reforms;  and  (iv) \ninstitutional and human resource capacity building to develop capacities such as management, \nleadership,  facilitation,  negotiation,  and  conflict  resolution  competencies,  as  well  as  skills \ntraining to implement policy and procedural actions under subprogram II. For efficient training of \nlarger numbers of officials, trained consultants will be recruited in conjunction with local training \ninstitutions.   \n \n97. \nTA program will commence within 4 months of the program loan effectiveness. It will be \nimplemented  over  2.5  years,  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  June  2011.  The  consulting \nservices  will  be  delivered  intermittently  over  the  TA  program  implementation  period.  It  will \nrequire a total of 55 person-months of national consulting services, and the national consultants \nwill  be  recruited  using  a  combination  of  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  and  individual \nselection methods according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). ADB will finalize terms of references and other related issues in consultation \nwith the government of Assam. \n \n98. \n \n\nThe TA is estimated at $750,000, of which \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n$600,000 will be a grant from the Japan Special Fund, financed on a grant basis \nby the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan; and \n$150,000  will  be  contributed  by  the  government  of  Assam  with  in-kind  support \nsuch  as  staff,  office  accommodation,  and  logistical  support  (government\u2019s \ncontribution). \n\n \nThe detailed cost estimates and a financing plan for the TA program is in Appendix 10 \n99. \n(the  terms  of  reference  for  the  consulting  services  and  other  details  are  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix E).  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nExpected Benefits \n\n \nA. \n \n100.  The program loan will help improve revenue administration, and strengthen expenditure \nmanagement  and  debt  management  of  the  government  of  Assam,  thus  enabling  it  to  create \ngreater  fiscal  space.  The  benefits  of  subprogram  II  are  expected  to  be  evident  in  (i)  the \navailability of more resources to invest in social and economic infrastructure in the state, which \nshould  ultimately  assist  in  enhancing  the  welfare  of  the  poor  in  the  rural  hinterlands;  (ii)  more \nefficient  allocation  of  budget  resources  based  on  outcomes  sought  rather  than  on  an \nincremental  and  ad  hoc  manner;  and  (iii)  the  ability  of  the  government  of  Assam,  in  the  long \nterm, to place its fiscal affairs on a sounder footing that can sustain investments for more rapid \nand inclusive growth.  \n \n101.  The  point  on  inclusive  growth  is  critical  to  the  state  if  it  is  to  deal  effectively  with  the \nsocial marginalization that exists currently. Specific benefits of subprogram II can be outlined as \nfollows: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\ngreater consideration of outcomes in resource allocations; \nbetter pension management for the employees of the state government; \nsimplified  administrative  and  procedural  requirements  (e.g.,  filing  requirements \nunder the VAT Act);  \n\n(iv)  more streamlined tax administration and engagement with large taxpayers; \n(v) \n\ngreater transparency and increased revenues, as a result of auctions of specific \nlicenses;  \n\n(vi)  more  objective  valuation  of  fixed  public  assets,  and  a  sustainable  system  of \n\nmaintenance of such assets; \n\n(vii)  more  effective  use  of  technology  to  manage  administrative  processes  (such  as \n\n(viii) \n(ix) \n\nthrough an upgraded TIMS and computerization of property records); \ngreater transparency in state affairs, such as on contingent liabilities; and \nreduced long-term burden on the government of Assam to support PSEs through \napplication of a VRS and consequent retraining schemes for employees. \n\n \n102.  As subprogram II seeks to strengthen state fiscal affairs, there should be a direct impact \non  the  economic  growth  rate  of  the state,  which  currently  lags  behind  the  national average.  A \nhigher growth rate and greater GSDP level will mean that the entire public will eventually benefit \nfrom subprogram II. The impact of subprogram II will also be felt in the medium term by the poor \nin the rural hinterlands. Subprogram II should create opportunities for the state government to \ninvest  in  much-needed  infrastructure  that  will  allow  the  broader  state  economy  to  be  better \nintegrated.  To  date,  and  to  some  extent,  the  remnants  of  the  insurgency  problem  in  the  state \nhave  been  a  function  of  the  inability  of  the  state  to  bring  about  inclusive  and  integrated \ndevelopment. A summary poverty reduction analysis is presented in Appendix 12. \n \nB. \n \n103.  Subprogram  II\u2019s  success  depends  on  the  government  of  Assam\u2019s  continuing  strong \ncommitment  to  fiscal  reforms  and  to  the  broader  governance  issues  of  transparency  in  fiscal \nmatters.  There  are  some  slight  risks  that  current  measures  and  reform  efforts,  including \ninsufficient  capacity  in  specific  implementing  government  agencies,  may  not  be  sustained. \nThese risks will be mitigated by (i) continued policy dialogue with the government of Assam and \nother  stakeholders  in  Assam  (such  as  business  associations),  and  (ii)  specific  technical \n\nRisks and Safeguards \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nassistance  and  capacity-development  support.  For  its  part,  the  government  of  Assam  has \nexpressed its commitment in the budget speech to pursue the reforms sought by subprogram II, \nand  the  level  of  engagement  in  the  program  design  has been  substantive.  The  economic  and \nsocial outcomes of policies adopted and actions taken under subprogram II are unlikely to have \nadverse environmental impacts. \n \n104.  The  assumptions  inherent  in  subprogram  II  are  that  (i)  the  government  of  Assam\u2019s \ncommitments to reforms across the various sectors (including PSEs) will remain high during the \nprogram  implementation  period,  (ii)  existing  central  policies  that  are  favorable  to  the  state  will \ncontinue  to  be  in  place  in  the  medium  to  long  term,  (iii)  any  political  developments  that  take \nplace  in  the  short-to-medium  term  do  not  adversely  affect  subprogram  II  in  any  substantive \nmanner, and (iv) the greater fiscal space will result in the reorientation of expenditure into social \nand economic infrastructure. The three main areas of risks that are likely to arise and impact on \nsubprogram II are (i) weaknesses in the institutional capacity of relevant government agencies, \n(ii) fiduciary risks relating to the use of loan proceeds, and (iii) external risks relating to inflation \nand flooding.    \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nInstitutional  Capacity. \nII  will  place  additional \nImplementing  subprogram \ndemands on the institutional capacities of government agencies (in terms of use \nof staff time, for example) that are executing and implementing it. Certain reforms \nunder subprogram II will also require skills and experience that are not currently \navailable in the relevant government agencies. These include (a) implementation \nof  OBB,  and  (b)  implementation  of  VRS  compensation  to  employees  of  PSEs \nnotified for closure. Close performance monitoring and targeted TA (as specified \nin  Supplementary  Appendix  D)  to  the  relevant  agencies  will  help  mitigate \nimplementation delays due to capacity constraints. \nFiduciary  Risks.  Fiduciary  risks  in  subprogram  II  could  arise  in  two  possible \nways.  First,  there  is  a  generic  risk  that  funds  might  not  be  applied  for  the \npurposes intended. To first mitigate this risk, assurances have been sought from \nthe  government  of  Assam  that  counterpart  funds  will  be  applied  for  program \npurposes.  This  includes  requiring  the  application  of  counterpart  funds  to  VRS \ncompensation for employees of PSEs notified for closure and to the government \nof Assam\u2019s contribution to the defined contribution pension scheme. Second, the \ngovernment  of  Assam  will  be  required  to  provide  quarterly  progress  reports  to \nADB.  Regular  monitoring  of  this  commitment  by  ADB  will  be  done  as  part  of \nprogram implementation.  \nExternal  Risks.  (a)  The  all-India  consumer  price  index  increased  from  3.0%  in \nFY2005 to 5.1% in FY2006. At the end of March 2008, the year-on-year inflation \nwas 7.4%.45 However, there seems to be upward pressure on the global prices of \nwheat (which increased by 88% between April 2000 and January 2008) and rice \n(which  increased  by  15%  in  the  same  period).  These  trends  are  no  doubt \ninflationary and there is resultant pressure on the domestic prices of these food \narticles. Since the major expenditure of the poor is on food, the income surplus of \nthe  poor  and  the  net  of  food  consumption  are  most  probably  reduced,  thus \nimpacting  the  consumption  of  nonfood  items.  The  inflation  rate  in  India  in  mid-\n2008 crossed to 11%, and the Indian economy is showing signs of slowing. This \nmay  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  collection  of  revenue  at  the  central \ngovernment  level  and  consequently  on  the  central  transfers  to  Assam  that \n\n                                                 \n45 As for Assam, the consumer price  index for the  working  class population (1982 = 100)  shows  a rise of 6.06%  in \n\n2007 over 2006. \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nconstitute a major source of revenue for the government of Assam. (b) Flooding \nis also a major concern for Assam. Floods occur on a regular basis, with the last \nmajor flood occurring in 2004.46 Apart from short-term health and hygiene issues, \nfloods also cause long-term food scarcity since no land is suitable for cultivation \nin the post-monsoon season. Extra resources and planning will be needed from \nthe government of Assam to relieve this perennial problem. \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n105. \nhas given the following specific assurances which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the government of Assam \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe Government and the government of Assam will ensure that policies adopted \nand  actions  taken  under  subprogram  II,  as  set  forth  in  the  development  policy \nletter  and  the  policy  matrix,  will  be  in  full  force  and  effect  for  and  beyond  the \nduration of subprogram II. \nThe  Government  will  transfer  the  counterpart  funds  generated  from  the  loan \nunder  the  normal  arrangements  for  transferring  external  assistance  to  the \ngovernment  of  Assam,  and  will  treat  such  counterpart  funds  as  additional  to  its \ntransfers  allocated  annually  to  the  government  of  Assam.  The  government  of \nAssam  will  use  these  counterpart  funds  to  support  the  adjustment  costs  for  the \npolicies adopted and actions taken for program implementation, and ensure that \nsufficient budgetary allocations are made in a timely manner for the efficient and \ntimely implementation of subprogram II. Prior to the release of the third tranche, \nthe government of Assam shall have inter alia (a) applied $72 million equivalent \nin  counterpart  funds  for  the  complete  disbursement  of  VRS  and  related \ncompensation for employees of the 12 PSEs that have been notified for closure \n(of  which  $40  million  equivalent  shall  be  from  the  first  tranche  and  $32  million \nequivalent  shall  be  from  the  second  tranche),  and  (b)  transferred  $8  million \nequivalent  in  counterpart  funds  from  the  second  tranche  for  the  contribution  of \nthe  government  of  Assam  to  the  defined  contribution  pension  scheme.  The \ngovernment  of  Assam  shall  apply  $12  million  equivalent  in  counterpart  funds \nfrom  the  third  tranche  for  the  contribution  of  the  government  of  Assam  to  the \ndefined contribution pension scheme. \nThe Government and the government of Assam will keep ADB informed of policy \ndiscussions  with  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  that  may  have \nimplications for the implementation of subprogram II and will provide ADB with an \nopportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals. The Government and \nthe government of Assam will take into account ADB\u2019s views before finalizing and \nimplementing any such proposals. \nThe  government  of  Assam  will  endeavor  that  (a)  critical  program  staff  shall \nremain  in  their  position  on  a  full-time  basis  for  a  reasonable  duration  to  ensure \ncontinuity  in  the  implementation  of  subprogram  II;  and  (b)  all  implementing \nagencies  are  adequately  staffed  and  provided  with  the  necessary  financial, \ntechnical, and other resources to perform their functions under subprogram II. \n\n                                                 \n46 According  to  the  National  Flood  Commission,  the  area  prone  to  flooding  in  Assam  is  around  300,000  hectares. \nAssam thus accounts for around 9% of the total flood-prone area in the country. Deforestation is a major reason for \nthe floods becoming an annual feature. \n\n\f \n\n29\n\n(v) \n\nThe  government  of  Assam  will  ensure  that  any  communication  relating  to  the \nimplementation  of  VRS  compensation  and  labor  rehabilitation  for  employees  of \nPSEs notified for closure is made available through the local media. \n\n \nConditions for Loan Effectiveness  \n\nB. \n \n106.  The conditions for the first tranche will be carried out to the satisfaction of ADB before \nthe loan becomes effective  \n \n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n \n107. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  loan  of  $100,000,000  to  India  for  the  second  subprogram  of  the  Assam \nGovernance  and  Public  Resource  Management  Sector  Development  Program  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  term  of  15  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  3  years;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \nand Program Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n27 August 2008 \n \n\nC.

Its  problems  have  been  those  of  remoteness,  partially  hilly  terrain,  and  high \ntransportation  costs.  The  low-income  plains  regions  are  also  constrained  by  high  population \ndensity,  a  large  but  slow-growing  agriculture  sector,  and  a  high  incidence  of  poverty.  In  the \n1990s  insurgency  considerably  slowed  economic  activity  in  Assam.  The  gross  state  domestic \nproduct  (GSDP)  growth  at  constant  prices  from  FY1993  to  FY1999  was  below  2%  on  a  trend \nbasis. With the decline in insurgency in recent years, and some strong tax incentives introduced \nby  the  central  government,  the  manufacturing  and  sectors  showed  buoyant  growth  during \nFY1999  to  FY2005,  with  manufacturing  growing  at  8.6%  per  annum  and  services  growing  at \n8.0%.  Led  by  this  growth,  the  GSDP  trend  growth  rate  was  5.4%.  The  primary  sector  growth \nrate, although higher than the previous period trend growth rate, was still close to 1%.  \n \n2. \nIn terms of compositional changes, the relatively low growth rates of agriculture and the \nprimary  sector  as  a  whole  have  led  to  a  fall  in  its  share  among  whole  sectors,  whereas  the \nshare of the services sector has steadily increased. The share of the primary sector fell from a \nlevel of nearly 47% to 34 %, a fall of 13 percentage points, amounting to nearly one percentage \npoint per year during FY1993 to FY2005. Correspondingly, the share of the tertiary sector has \nincreased  from  38.2%  to  49.5%.  A  significant  portion  of  the  services  sector  comprises  trade, \nhotels  and  restaurants,  and  public  administration.  The  increase  in  the  share  of  the  secondary \nsector has been much less, from 14.9% in FY1993 to 17.4% in FY2005. \n \n\n2. \n\nFiscal Performance \n\n \n3. \nAgainst  the  background  of  the  poorly  performing  state  economy  during  the  1990s,  the \nfinances  of  the  government  of  Assam  underwent  a  major  crisis  in  the  late  1990s  with  the \nrevenue deficit and fiscal deficit reaching alarming levels. In FY1999, the revenue deficit relative \nto GSDP rose to 3.4% of GSDP, having been in surplus in the 3 preceding years. State finances \nremained in revenue deficit until FY2004. The fiscal deficit was close to 5% of GSDP in FY2001, \nand it remained high until FY2004. It was due to a substantial increase in fiscal transfers that, in \nFY2005, a revenue surplus and even a small fiscal surplus was recorded. However, in FY2006, \nrevenue deficit was recorded once again.   \n \n\nFigure A2.1: Revenue Deficit and Fiscal Deficit as % of GSDP\n\nP\nD\nS\nG\n\n \nf\no\n%\n\n \n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n2000\u20132001\n\n2001\u20132002\n\n2002\u20132003\n\n2003\u20132004\n\n2004\u20132005\n\n2005\u20132006\n\n2006\u20132007\n\nRevenue deficit\n\nFiscal deficit\n\nGSDP = gross state domestic product.\nSources: Asian Development Bank and state government of Assam.\n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n39\n\nAlthough  Assam  was  recognized  as  a  special  category  state  in  the  Fourth  Five-Year \n4. \nPlan, it was given the benefit of 90:10 grant-loan composition of plan assistance, effective from \nApril 1990. It may be noted that the revenue deficit of a special category state is not comparable \nto the general category states because the revenue receipts of the former include 90% of plan \nassistance  given  as  grants,  a  significant  proportion  of  which  is  meant  for  capital  expenditure. \nThus, the true picture was far more serious than what was indicated by the budget accounts. \n \n5. \nIn  explaining  the  development  of  the  fiscal  crisis  in  the  late  1990s,  it  is  notable  that \nAssam's  finances  were  exposed  to  at  least  four  external  shocks  beyond  the  control  of  the \ngovernment  of  Assam.  First  was  the  revision  of  salaries  and  pensions  of  central  government \nemployees and the subsequent near-convergence of pay scales and other allowances between \nthe  center  and  the  states  including  Assam.  Secondly,  there  was  a  fall  in  the  central  tax-GDP \nratio by nearly two percentage points during the 1990s, leading to a fall in the states\u2019 share of \ncentral taxes. Thirdly, the revenue from forests in Assam, which at one time was a mainstay of \nAssam's  nontax  resources,  deteriorated  sharply  after  the  Supreme  Court  judgment  banning \nfelling  of  trees  unless  done  according  to  scientific  plans.  Fourthly,  interest  rates  have  risen \nsharply since the mid-1990s, especially on small savings and central loans.  \n \n6. \nThese external pressures worked in combination with critical internal weaknesses, which \nwere due to (i) a rise in insurgency affecting economic as well as fiscal performance, (ii) slow \nindustrial growth, (iii) the dismal performance of state public sector enterprises (PSEs), and (iv) \na  high  salary  burden  linked  to  excessive  employment  in  government.  The  basic  mismatch  in \nAssam's  fiscal  position  was  reflected  in  the  ways  and  means  problem.1 In  the  crisis  period, \nAssam  topped  the  list  of  states  for  the  number  of  days  in  a  year  for  which  payments  were \nsuspended from the treasury. The state had continuing ways and means problems for several \nyears and regularly ran an overdraft with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  \n \n7. \nJust as the onset of the fiscal crisis had extraneous causes, part of the explanation for \nthe beginning of recovery was also due to external factors. The reason for the improvement in \nFY2005  was  higher \nthe  Twelfth  Finance \nCommission  (TFC).  This  was  combined  with  much  higher  central  tax  revenue,  which  helped \nincrease the resource transfer from the center. A revenue surplus was recorded in FY2005 after \na  long  gap.  Among  the  internal  factors,  two  are  critically  important:  (i)  Assam  enacted  fiscal \nresponsibility legislation, and (ii) it implemented the value-added tax (VAT) regime. \n \n\nthe  recommendations  of \n\ntransfers \n\nfollowing \n\n3. \n\nResource Mobilization \n\n \n8. \nWhile  the  profile  of  fiscal  imbalance  provides  a  summary  indication  of  the  position  of \nstate  finances,  it  is  also  an  indicator  of  revenue  performance  against  expenditure  trends. \nRevenue  performance,  in  turn,  is  a  combination  of  the  state\u2019s  collection  of  own-tax  revenues, \nnontax revenues, and transfers from the center. The state\u2019s own revenue, inclusive of both tax \nand nontax revenues, increased at a trend annual growth rate of 14.46% between FY1993 and \nFY2005, which was nearly four percentage points higher than the transfers from the center, the \nhighest growth being in state tax revenues. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   During  the  crisis  period,  Assam  topped  the  list  of  states  for  the  number  of  days  of  access  to  ways  and  means \nadvance  in  a  year  for  several  years  and  regularly  ran  an  overdraft  with  the  central  bank  (the  Reserve  Bank  of \nIndia). \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n4. \n\nOwn-Tax Revenue \n\n \n9. \nBetween FY1993 and FY2005, Assam's own-tax revenues grew at the trend growth rate \nof  15.26%.  The  growth  in  this  period,  however,  was  not  uniform.  Own-tax  revenues  showed \nstrong  increases  after  FY1998.  The  state's  tax-GSDP  ratio  continued  to  improve  and  reached \n6.2% in FY2004. The tax-GSDP ratio showed a marginal fall compared to the peak reached in \nFY2004,  due  to  the  introduction  of  VAT.  It  still,  however,  remained  at  a  level  higher  than  all \nprevious years of the period under review.  \n \n10. \nAmong  the  contributors  to  own-tax  revenue,  the  highest  growth  was  in  state  excise \nduties,  followed  by  taxes  on  vehicles,  sales  tax,  other  taxes,  and  stamp  duty  and  registration \nfees. As the share of state excise duties in total taxes was low, its relatively higher growth rate \ncompared to sales tax failed to make any significant impact on aggregate revenue performance.  \n \n\nFigure A2.2: Own Revenue Receipts as % of GSDP\n\nP\nD\nS\nG\n\n \nf\no\n%\n\n \n\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n2000\u20132001\n\n2001\u20132002\n\n2002\u20132003\n\n2003\u20132004\n\n2004\u20132005\n\n2005\u20132006\n\n2006\u20132007\n\nSales tax\nTaxes on vehicles\nTotal\n\nState excise duties\nStamp duty & registration fees\n\nGSDP = gross state domestic product.\nSources: Asian Development Bank and state government of Assam.\n\n5. \n\nNontax Revenue \n\n \n\n \n\n \nNontax  revenue  relative  to  GSDP,  which  was  close  to  1%  until  FY1998,  also  rose \n11. \ncontinuously  and  is  estimated  to  be  2.6%  of  GSDP  in  FY2006.  The  government  of  Assam's \nnontax revenue arises from its ownership of assets and its role as a provider of services. There \nare  six  main  sources  of  nontax  revenue  in  Assam:  royalty  on  minerals,  interest  receipts, \ndividends,  and  receipts  from  general,  social,  and  economic  services.  In  each  case,  there  is  a \nrelationship between nontax revenue and a corresponding base, consisting of past investments \nand  current  expenditure.  Thus,  interest  receipts  relate  to  outstanding  loans  extended  by  the \ngovernment, dividends to the outstanding equity investment, and returns from services to past \ninvestments in building assets for providing these services (schools, hospitals, irrigation canals, \ngovernment buildings, etc.) and current expenditure on these services.  \n \n12. \nThe government of Assam\u2019s nontax revenue accounted for nearly 36% of own revenue \nin FY1993. This contribution steadily declined to 25.5% in FY2001. After this, once again, there \nhas  been  an  improvement  in  its  share  relative  to  GSDP.  The  improvement  after  FY2001  has \narisen  mainly  out  of  revisions  of  royalty  rates  by  the  central  government.  Like  tax  revenue, \nnontax  revenue  also  shows  considerable  volatility  as  indicated  by  the  annual  growth  rates. \nRoyalty on minerals is the major source of nontax revenue for the government of Assam. The \nrelative  importance  of  forestry  has  receded  significantly  following  the  decision  of  the  Supreme \nCourt  to  ban  felling  of  tress  except  under  suitable  scientific  plans.  It  has  been  highlighted  in \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n41\n\nseveral  studies  that  cost  recoveries  in  social  and  economic  services  have  been  dismally  low. \nThe returns on loans and advances and equity investment have also been extremely low.  \n \n13. \nPetroleum royalties have continued to be the largest contributor to nontax revenue from \neconomic services, and the petroleum sector revenue has gradually increased as a proportion \nof nontax revenue. Nontax revenue offers reasonable scope for augmentation, providing a link \nis established between costs and recoveries. Among the social services, medical, public health, \nand family welfare provide the largest share of revenue. Secondary education contributes most \nof the fees collected in education.  \n \n\n6. \n\nCentral Transfers \n\n \nThere  are  two  main  components  of  central  transfers:  the  share  in  central  taxes  and  in \n14. \ncentral grants. In FY1997 these transfers amounted to 13.43% of GSDP, but they had fallen to \n10.84% by FY1999. With the award of the Eleventh Finance Commission, central transfers rose \nto 11.8% in FY2000. In FY2004, these rose further to 14.05% of GSDP based on a rise in plan \ngrants.  In  FY2005,  following  the  recommendations  of  the  Twelfth  Finance  Commission, \ntransfers amounted to 12.8% and are estimated at nearly 17.7% in FY2006, which is due to a \nrise in the share of central taxes and a steep rise in plan grants.  \n \nThe  government  of  Assam  finances  are  highly  sensitive  to  changes  in  central  tax \n15. \nrevenue  because  the  tax  devolution  constitutes  a  significant  share  of  the  state's  total  tax \nrevenue. While the share of central taxes increased from 38.5% in FY1993 to 48% in FY1997, \nthere  was  subsequently  a  steady  decline.  This  corresponded  to  the  increasing  importance  of \nplan grants in total transfers; in FY2006, plan grants were estimated at 56% of total transfers. \nThe share of central transfers in total revenue receipts has fallen from a peak of 72% in FY1996 \nto  nearly  61%  in  FY2005.  Given  that  central  transfers  have  increased  in  this  period,  the \ndecrease in relative proportion does not reflect a fall in central transfers. It reflects the fact that \nAssam\u2019s  own  revenues  have  grown  even  faster.  It  is  a  healthy  trend  that  Assam\u2019s  own  tax \nrevenue,  after  being  lower  than  its  share  in  central  tax  revenue,  has  exceeded  central  tax \nrevenue  in  3  recent  years  (FY2002,  FY2004,  and  FY2005).  This  indicates  that  Assam\u2019s  tax \nbuoyancy has improved beyond that of the central tax revenue in recent years.  \n \n16. \nAlthough there has been a decline in the share of central transfers, the dependence of \nAssam on central transfers continues to be high. The recovery in recent years therefore has had \nstrong support due to a rise in both own revenue and central transfers. \n \n\n7. \n\nExpenditure Management \n\n \n17. \nTotal  government  expenditure  relative  to  GSDP  may  be  considered  as  an  indicator  of \nthe size of the government. There was a discernible declining trend in government expenditure \nas  a  percentage  of  GSDP  in  Assam  up  to  FY1998,  after  which  there  was  an  increase  in  the \nlevel  of  total  expenditure  relative  to  GSDP.  Based  on  sharp  increases  in  plan  assistance,  two \nrecent years show significant increases.  \n \n18. \nSome important features on the expenditure side relate to the rising share of committed \nexpenditure\u2014such  as  interest  payments,  pensions,  and  salaries\u2014and  a  low  share  of  capital \nexpenditure  in  total  expenditure.  Revenue  expenditure,  after  some  decline  in  the  mid-1990s, \nstarted  rising  after  FY1996,  reaching  an  unprecedented  level  of  27%  in  FY2006.  Within  the \ncategory  of  revenue  expenditure,  interest  payments  and  pensions  constitute  committed \npayments under general services. Interest payments peaked at 3.6% of GSDP in FY2002, but \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nP\nD\nS\nG\n\n \nf\no\n%\n\n \n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nsince  then  have  fallen,  based  on  lower  interest  rates  and  relief  due  to  the  center\u2019s  debt  swap \nprogram. Pensions rose steadily up to FY2004, when they accounted for 2.43% of GSDP. The \nother major committed liability comes from salary expenditure, which accounted for nearly 42% \nof  revenue expenditure  in  FY1994.  This  increased  to  a  peak  of 59%  in  FY2000,  reflecting  the \nimpact  of  salary  revisions,  but  it  has  since  fallen.  It  is  reported  to  have  come  down  to  40%  in \nFY2005.   \n \n\nFigure A2.3: Fiscal Indicators as % of GSDP\n\n2000\u20132001\n\n2001\u20132002\n\n2002\u20132003\n\n2003\u20132004\n\n2004\u20132005\n\n2005\u20132006\n\n2006\u20132007\n\nRevenue expenditure\n\nInterest payments\n\nPensions\n\nGSDP = gross state domestic product.\nSources: Asian Development Bank and state government of Assam.\n\n \n\n19. \nIt  now  appears  that  revenue  expenditure  is  in  the  process  of  becoming  stabilized. \nSimilarly,  capital  outlay,  which  had  languished  at  below  2%  of  GSDP  until  FY2003,  has  since \nshown signs of improvement.  \n \n20. \nAmong the main categories of revenue expenditure, general services and social services \nare broadly of the same order of importance relative to GSDP, while economic services account \nfor  a  much  lower  percentage.  Interest  payments  have  accounted  for  around  2.5%\u20133.6%  of \nGSDP; the peak level of 3.6% of GSDP occurred in FY2003. The share of economic services, \nwhich  was  4.23%  in  FY1993,  steadily  fell  in  the  1990s  and  remained  below  3%  until  FY2001. \nSince then it has started rising, reflecting the beneficial impact of recovery in state finances. In \nFY2006, expenditure on economic services is estimated at close to 6% of GSDP, which would \nbe  the  highest  level  ever  reached.  In  FY2006,  expenditure  on  social  services  is  estimated  at \n10.8% of GSDP. Expenditure on key social services like education and health has been more \nsalary  driven.  Expenditure  on  education  reached  6.7%  of  GSDP  in  FY1999,  reflecting  the \nimpact of salary revisions in the wake of the Fifth Central Pay Commission. It was after FY2002 \nthat this effect receded, and this expenditure was less than 4.5% in FY2005. \n \n21. \nlending\u2014steadily \ndeclined after the mid-1990s but has shown improvement in the current decade. The share of \ncapital  outlay  and  loans  and  advances  steadily  declined  due  to  a  sharp  increase  in  the \nrepayment  obligations  of  the  state.  The  major  factor  behind  the  increase  in  the  repayment \nobligations was the repayment of loans and advances from the central government.  \n \n\nAsset-forming  government  expenditure\u2014capital  outlay  and  net \n\n8. \n\nDebt \n\n \n\na. \n\nDirect Debt \n\n \nA major problem faced by state governments in India has been the sustainability of debt, \n22. \nwhich  accumulates  due  to  incurring  fiscal  deficits  year  after  year.  The  debt-GSDP  ratio  in \nAssam was nearly 28% in FY1993. It remained roughly at this level until FY1998 and after that \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n43\n\nstarted rising as more borrowing was needed to finance the increase in salaries and pensions \nexpenditure. The nominal interest rate also became extremely high in the late 1990s, and this \ncontributed to higher debt servicing costs, putting further pressure on deficits. The debt-GSDP \nratio continued to rise until FY2004, when it peaked at 37.5%. If reserve funds and deposits are \nalso  included  in  debt,  the  total  direct  liabilities  would,  on  average,  be  higher  by  a  margin  of \naround three percentage points.  \n \n\nFigure A2.4: Outstanding Debt as % of GSDP\n\nP\nD\nS\nG\n\n \nf\no\n%\n\n \n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2000\u20132001\n\n2001\u20132002\n\n2002\u20132003\n\n2003\u20132004\n\n2004\u20132005\n\n2005\u20132006\n\n2006\u20132007\n\nGSDP = gross state domestic product.\nSources: Asian Development Bank and state government of Assam.\n\n \n23.  With regard to the composition of state debt between FY2000 and FY2005, the share of \nmarket loans in total debt has risen from nearly 23% to 38%, whereas the share of central loans \nhas been falling, from 64% FY1998 to 25.8% in FY2005. With the recommendation of the TFC \nregarding  disintermediation  of  state  loans  by  the  central  government,  the  central  loans  are \nexpected to account for a small share of Assam\u2019s debt, with most of it being consolidated debt \nbased on the TFC\u2019s debt relief recommendations. Thus, in FY2005, the three major sources of \ndebt arranged in order of importance are market loans, National Small Savings Fund (NSSF)-\nbased loans, and the state provident funds.  \n \n24. \nApart from the change in composition of debt, as described above, there has also been \na significant change in the cost of borrowing from alternative sources. While for debt as a whole, \nthe fall in the effective interest rate is quite marked, the fall in the interest rates for market loans \nand institutional loans is by far the greatest. The average interest rate for debt as a whole had \nfallen to about 9.2% by the end of FY2004. With consolidation of central debt at 7.5% under the \nTFC  scheme  of  debt  relief  and  further  softening  of  the  interest  rate  on  market  loans,  the \neffective interest rate has come down even further since then. \n \n\nb. \n\nContingent Liabilities \n\n \nThe government of Assam has extended guarantees to loans taken by a number of state \n25. \npublic  enterprises  and  cooperative  institutions.  Given  the  financial  performance  of  these \nenterprises, many of these contingent liabilities have the potential of becoming actual budgetary \nliabilities. In many cases, the debt incurred by the organization has not been serviced, so that \noutstanding liabilities have mounted. Against a total guaranteed amount of $400.0 million, loans \namounting  to  $354.5  million  have  been  taken.  Out  if  these,  nearly  $294.4  million  remain  as \noutstanding liabilities in terms of repayments and interest due.  \n \n\n9. \n\nState Public Sector Enterprises \n\n \n26. \nThe state PSEs have historically been a drag on the government of Assam\u2019s finances. \nThere are 48 state PSEs in Assam of which 33 are companies, 8 are cooperatives, and 7 are \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nstatutory  bodies.  The  state  PSEs  have  historically  been  known  for  not  keeping  up-to-date \naudited accounts. For example, at the end of March 2004, there was no information available for \n15 state PSEs, and there was some information but no accounts for 14 state PSEs. Thus, for \n60% of the state PSEs, the reliance on available financial information has been limited. Of the \nremaining  19  state  PSEs,  15  had  provisional  accounts  and  there  were  only  four  state  PSEs \nwhere  audited  accounts  were  available.  The  government  of  Assam  has  a  share  of  more  than \n98% in the paid-up capital of state PSEs. In addition, substantial amounts of loans have been \nextended by the government of Assam to these public enterprises. Taking the state\u2019s share of \ndividends  and  interest  payments  received  on  the  loans,  the  return  on  total  investment  on  the \ngovernment  of  Assam\u2019s  investment  is  less  than  0.5%;  in  fact,  it  ranges  between  0.25%  and \n0.35% on total investment.  \n \nIt is notable that out of the 48 state PSEs, four account for nearly 60% of total turnover: \n27. \nthe  Assam  State  Electricity  Board,  the  Assam  Urban  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Board,  the \nAssam Industrial Development Corporation, and the Assam Tea Corporation.  \n \n\n10. \n\nFiscal Management Reform Path \n\n \n28. \nThe  government  of  Assam  enacted  the  Fiscal  Responsibility  and  Budget  Management \n(FRBM) Act in May 2005. It was amended in September 2005 and again in August 2007. With \nthese amendments, the FRBM Act has provided for meeting all the conditions for claiming debt \nrelief as provided by the TFC. The following are the main provisions of the FRBM Act: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nLowering the revenue deficit to zero by FY2008. With the latest amendment, it is \nfurther stipulated that the revenue deficit will be reduced annually at a rate that is \nconsistent with achieving the target of zero revenue deficit by FY2008. \nLowering the fiscal deficit to 3% of GSDP by FY2008. Further, fiscal deficit will be \nreduced annually in a manner consistent with achieving the 3% target of GSDP \nby FY2008. \nRestricting the total debt stock, including debt in respect of which the government \nof Assam may have extended guarantees, to 45% of GSDP by FY2009. \n\n \nIn respect of outstanding guarantees for debt raised by various PSEs, cooperatives, and \n29. \nautonomous bodies, these will be subject to the limit determined by 50% of the state\u2019s tax and \nnontax  revenue  of  the  second  preceding  year  consistent  with  the  figures  of  the  finance \naccounts. This stipulation, provided for in the latest amendment, changes the original provision \nwhere reference was only to the previous year, and an alternative condition of 5% of GSDP of \nthe previous year was also provided.  \n \n30. \nThe latest amendment has also provided that in the annual budget, a detailed statement \ngiving the number of employees in government, public sector, and aided institutions, and related \nsalaries, will be provided. \n \n31.  With  these  provisions,  the  FRBM  Act  of  the  government  of  Assam  now  meets  all  the \nTFC stipulations for getting debt relief subject to actual improvement in reducing revenue deficit. \nIt is understood that the government of Assam\u2019s debt to central government, outstanding as of \n31 March 2004, has already been consolidated and rescheduled for 20 years, as recommended \nby the TFC. The government of Assam now has to ensure that it takes maximum advantage of \nthe write-off provisions linked to any reduction in revenue deficit. \n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n45\n\nAs  provided  for  in  section  3  of  the  FRBM  Act,  the  government  of  Assam  presented  a \n32. \nstatement to the assembly giving details of a 5-year fiscal plan including the relevant indicators. \nThe Five-Year Fiscal Plan contained FY2007 budget estimates and projections from FY2007 to \nFY2011. \n \n33. \nThe  statement  presented  to  the  assembly  stated  that  \"the  fiscal  policy  of  the  state \ngovernment  is  to  make  the  Annual  Plan  Outlay  free  from  salary  burden  and  to  make  more \ninvestment  for  development  activities  and  accelerate  the  process  of  development  of  the  state \neconomy.\"  The  basic  assumptions  used  for  the  Five  Year  Fiscal  Plan  projections  are  listed \nbelow: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nOwn-tax  revenue.  Sales  tax,  state  excise  duties,  stamp  duty  and  registration \nfees,  motor  vehicle  tax,  and  other  taxes  are  all  assumed  to  grow  at  10%  per \nannum during the projection period. \nNontax revenue.

In  particular,  the  revenue  account  is \nbrought into balance from 2008 to 2009 onwards and fiscal deficit is kept at 3% of gross state \ndomestic product (GSDP).  \n \n2. \n\nThe following growth rates have been assumed to make the fiscal projections. \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nOutput growth. GSDP growth is assumed to be 11%.  \nInflation rate. Inflation rate for the projection period has been assumed to be 5%. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n47\n\n(iii) \n\nExpenditure growth  \n(a) \n\nInterest  payment.  For  consolidated  debt,  an  interest  rate  of  7.5%  per \nannum is applied. For other debt, an interest rate of 9% is applied based \non the progressive reduction of the interest rate. \nSocial  services. The expenditure growth rate in education and health is \nset  at  15%  as  compared  to  the  historical  growth  rates  of  10.1%  in \neducation  and  7.4%  in  health.  The  growth  rate  in  social  services  as  a \nwhole is taken as 10%.  \nEconomic  services  and  other  general  services.  The  growth  rate  for \nother  general  services  (other  than  interest  rate  and  pensions)  and \neconomic services is kept at 10% per annum. \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nRevenue  receipts  growth.  The growth rate for revenue receipts are detailed in \ntable A3.3.  \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\nTable A3.3: Tax Buoyancies \n\nTax \nOwn Tax \nSales Tax \nState Excise Duty \nStamp Duty and Registration Fee \nMotor Vehicle Tax \nOther Taxes \n\nBuoyancy \n1.399 \n1.604 \n1.589 \n1.336 \n1.345 \n0.494 \n\nT-values \n25.302 \n17.792 \n6.747 \n30.801 \n13.391 \n4.132 \n\nSource (basic data): Finance accounts of Assam and budget FY2007. \n\n \nFrom  the  buoyancy  coefficients,  the  growth  rate  for  the  respective  taxes  is  derived  by \n3. \nmultiplying  the  buoyancy  coefficient  with  the  GSDP  growth  rate.  Accordingly,  the  following \ngrowth rates for different taxes have been used.  \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nSales tax. 11% for the first 2 years and 17.6% for the last 2 years. \nState excise duties. 17.5%.  \nStamp duty and registration fees. 14.7%.  \nTax on motor vehicles. 14.8%.  \nOther taxes. 5.4%  \nNontax  revenues.  Nontax  revenues  are  allowed  to  grow  at  15%  per  annum, \ntaking into account the impact of public sector restructuring and increases in user \ncharges as the part of the reform process. \n\n(vii)  Central  transfers. Growth of central tax revenues will continue to be critical for \nAssam because of the relatively large contribution of central transfers in the form \nof  tax  devolution.  The  growth  in  the  states\u2019  share  of  central  taxes  has  been \nassumed to be 18.2% per annum. Assuming that Assam\u2019s share in central taxes \nremains the same during the entire projections period, the same growth rate has \nbeen applied for projecting the state's share in central taxes. \n\n \n\n4. \nGrants.  State  plan  grants  have  been  assumed  to  grow  at  10%  as  the  historical  trend \ngrowth  rate  is  9.98%.  For  other  components  of  grants,  including  Finance  Commission  grants, \nthe grant profile given in the state\u2019s medium-term fiscal plan has been used, as a large portion \nof these grants has already been determined. \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \nSector/ \nThematic/ \nArea/State \nLaw, \nEconomic \nManagement, \nand Public \nPolicy; \nSustainable \nEconomic \nGrowth; \nGovernance \n\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX  \n\n \n \nAsian Development Bank Activities \nSupport to improve stabilization and \nconsolidation of state finances for \nenhanced growth and reduction of \npoverty in Assam is carried out through \nthree channels: (i) reform of state \nfinances for fiscal space creation; (ii) \nreform of fiscal governance for \nimproved budget and expenditure \nmanagement processes for improved \nutilization and prioritization of existing \nfiscal resources; and (iii) core \ngovernance reforms to re-orient the \nstate away from unproductive \ngovernment and PSE expenditure, \nimprove the quality of public \nexpenditure, and foster alternative \nopportunities for growth, employment, \nand empowerment for delivery of \npublic goods and services. \n \nPublic resource management loans \nand TA grants for fiscal consolidation \nand better state governance were \nprovided to:  \n \n1.

Accordingly, this assessment takes a \nrisk-based approach to issues in public resource management in the state of Assam, India.2 \n \nB. \n \n\nRelevant Governance Issues \n\n1. \n\nPolitical Economy \n\n \n2. \nThe  broader  political  economy  of  Assam  is  characterized  by,  among  other  things,  (i) \nreliance  on  the  capacity  of  the  state  and  its  bureaucratic  arrangements  to  foster  development \n(development work in Assam is public expenditure-led and there is now a persistent expenditure \nburden  imposed  on  the  state);  and  (ii)  considerable  reliance  on  the  central  government  for \nresources (more than 60% of state revenue receipts). \n \n\n2. \n\nPublic Service and Public Sector Enterprises \n\n \n3. \nThe  level  of  government  employment  in  Assam  is  now  considered  to  be  fiscally \nuntenable  (almost  50%  of  revenue  expenditure  goes  to  the  salary  and  wages  bill).  Recent \nremedial measures have included restricting replacement of retiring government employees and \ngrowth  of  salaries,  abolishing  all  posts  which  have  been  vacant  for  more  than  1  year, \nconsideration  of  a  voluntary  retirement  scheme  (VRS) \nin  government  agencies,  and \nredeployment  of  staff.  The  government  of  Assam  currently  has  48  public  sector  enterprises \n(PSEs), but in 2001 only six PSEs were considered to be performing well, and this dropped to \nfive in 2003 (of these, only two were paying dividends and the other three had no accumulated \nloss). \n \n\n3. \n\nPublic Finance Management \n\n \n4. \nThe state\u2019s debt burden was 37.4% to gross state domestic product (GSDP) in FY2005. \nThe  government  of  Assam\u2019s  contingent  liabilities  are  also  high,  as  it  has  given  guarantees  to \nloans  taken  by  state  public  enterprises.  With  regard  to  revenue,  almost  two  thirds  of  state \nrevenue  comes  from  central  government  transfers.  Weaknesses  in  revenue  administration \nrange  from  lack  of  audit  and  an  operations  manual  to  a  weak  tax  information  management \nsystem.  These  not  only  impact  the  effective  collection  of  revenue  but  also  reflect  the \nvulnerability  to  mismanagement.  Finally,  there  are  gaps  in  expenditure  rationalization  that  are \nreflected in the absence of links between capital and recurrent budgets as well as inadequacies \nin operation and maintenance (O&M) expenditure, and weak internal audit function in agencies. \nAlready, the level of expenditure is expected to have reached an unprecedented level of 27% to \nGSDP. \n \n5. \nTo  better  understand  its  public  finance  management,  the  government  of  Assam  has \nrecently  enacted  the  Fiscal  Responsibility  and  Budget  Management  (FRBM)  Act  (latest \namendment  in  August  2007)  which  stipulates  several  fiscal  targets,  but,  more  importantly, \nrequires the government of Assam to show in the annual budget a detailed statement giving the \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan. Manila. \n2 A detailed risk assessment is shown in Supplementary Appendix F. \n\n \n\n\f78 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nnumber of employees in government, the public sector, and aided institutions, and the related \nsalary expense.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement, Corruption, and Transparency \n\n \n6. \nAssam  has  prepared  a  public  procurement  manual  which  focuses  on,  inter  alia,  the \nguiding  principles  of  economy,  transparency,  accountability,  equity,  effectiveness,  efficiency, \nand  ethical  standards.  Poor  governance,  lack  of  accountability  leading  to  leakage  of \ndevelopment funds, and the problem of corruption in Assam is reportedly substantial. The India \nCorruption  Study  2005  ranks  Assam  the  15th  most  corrupt  state  out  of  the  20  it  surveyed  in \nIndia.  \n \nThe  government  of  Assam  now  publishes  a  semi-annual  report  on  achievements  of \n7. \nfinancial reforms and budget targets. As per the FRBM Act, the Department of Finance should \nalso undertake an annual review of the trends in receipts and expenditure, including the fiscal \nindicator  targets  for  the  current  year,  explaining  the  reasons  for  any  deviations  and  related \nremedial measures. \n \nC. \n \nThe  assessment  of  risks  that  this  program  faces  is  by  nature  subjective,  hence  an \n8. \niterative  process  or  peer  review  both  within  the  government  of  Assam  and  at  ADB  is \nrecommended. \n \n\nIdentification of Risks, Their Severity, and Risk Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nUnderlying Assumptions \n\n \n9. \nThe  main  underlying  assumptions  that  are  made  here  are  that  (i)  the  government  of \nAssam will continue with reforms, (ii) effective institution-building processes in key agencies in \npublic  finance  management  will  continue,  and  (iii)  the  government  of  Assam  shares  the  view \nthat this assessment presents an accurate and rigorous review of the risks in the sector. \n \n\n2. \n\nRisk Specification \n\nSome of the risks that could arise, not only in relation to subprogram II but also across \n\n \n10. \nthe public sector broadly, can be grouped into three broad categories:   \n \n\n(i) \n\nExogenous to the state.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe  core  focus  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank's  (ADB\u2019s)  operational  strategy  in  India  is  poverty  reduction \nthrough  infrastructure-led  growth.  ADB\u2019s  current  operational  strategy  for  India  was  laid  down  in  the  country \nstrategy and program 2003a\u2014with updates in 2004 and 2005\u2014and the country operations business planb in 2006 \nto reflect the evolving priorities of the Government of India. The three pillars of ADB\u2019s strategy are inclusive and \nbroad-based  growth,  social  development,  and  good  governance.  The  country  strategy  and  program  for  India \nmainstreams poverty reduction through growth as the central goal of ADB operations in India.  \n \nIndia\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan (FY2007\u2013FY2011) envisages a new growth paradigm that will be much more broad-\nbased and inclusive, bringing about a faster reduction in poverty. It focuses on policies and investment plans that \nsupport (i) inclusive growth, with particular emphasis on agriculture and rural development and raising investment \nin  infrastructure;  (ii)  improvement  in  the  quality  and  delivery  of  public  services;  (iii)  creation  of  investment  and \nemployment opportunities, especially in rural areas; and (iv) strengthening of infrastructure.  \n \nIn addition to achieving progress in sector areas, the 11th Five Year Plan also aims to foster good governance by \nextending access to essential public services (such as health, education, clean drinking water, and sanitation) to \nthose  who  are  deprived  of  them,  improving  government  capacity,  promoting  local  government,  tackling \ncorruption,  enhancing  access  to  justice  for  the  poor,  and  improving  security  and  public  order.  This  is  to  be \ncomplemented by fostering partnerships between government, the private sector, and civil society organizations \nin order to improve service delivery.  \n \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program aims to assist good governance. It will address key governance issues on a \nsector and thematic basis, and will hence play a key role in supporting policy and institutional reforms to improve \nsector governance and increase sector efficiency (e.g., in energy, transport, education, urban health and urban \nwater  supply,  and  sanitation  sectors).  The  Assam  Governance  and  Public  Resource  Management  Sector \nDevelopment Program, in turn, aims to address the weaknesses in quality and delivery of services by orienting \nthe government of Assam towards a more results-oriented culture. It also stresses resource allocation both for \ninvestment and for proper maintenance of assets. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe  link  between  investment  and  growth  is  well  established.  Given  the  orientation  of  the  government  to  make \ngrowth more inclusive, economic growth is likely to have a positive impact on poverty alleviation. There are two \nkey issues implicit in subprogram II: \n \n(i) \n\nHow  best  to  maximize  revenue  so  as  to  enable  the  state  treasury  to  increase  investments  in  much-\nneeded social and economic infrastructure, particularly in the rural hinterlands where the bulk of the poor \npeople in the state live.  \nHow  best  to  rationalize  public  expenditure  (including  getting  a  better  understanding  of  the  problem  of \nincreasing  contingent  liabilities)  so  that  the  government  of  Assam  is  not  burdened  with  committed \nexpenditure,  as  this  diminishes  the  scope  for  proper  investment  in  social  and  economic  infrastructure \nwhich can directly address poverty. \n\n(ii) \n\n \nOther issues include (i) the significance of the operation and maintenance (O&M) expenditure on existing assets \n(the quality and efficiency of service output depends directly on the condition of the underlying asset); and (ii) the \n\n \n\n\f82 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nneed to ensure that maintenance expenditure does not fall below prescribed norms at the cost of expenditure on \noperations, and while the closure of loss-making public enterprises releases funds for public expenditure, such \nclosure  has  a  social  impact  with  employees  losing  their  source  of  livelihood.  As  such,  interventions  should  not \nonly  be  limited  to  the  voluntary  retirement  scheme,  but  the  government  also  needs  to  be  sensitive  to  the \nrequirement of sustained livelihood for the employees of these enterprises.  \n \n2.  Design Features. \n \nSome important features of subprogram II are as follows. \n \n(i) \n\nFor  the  first  time  in  Assam,  an  attempt  is  being  made  to  introduce  outcome-based  budgeting.  This will \nmean that resource allocations are not predominantly process-driven but are instead based on specific \noutcomes sought. \nSubprogram II aims to prepare O&M expenditure estimates in selected spending departments and also \nto ensure that budget allocation is in accordance with the estimates. This allows for more judicious asset \nusage. \nSubprogram II aims to raise transparency and efficiency in government operations by using information \nand  communication  technology  in  process  improvement  through  upgrading  the  tax  information \nmanagement system and making it fully functional, and by computerizing registration of properties in all \ndistricts except those in the autonomous councils. \nSubprogram  II  takes  a  holistic  view  of  public  sector  enterprise  restructuring.  While  an  attempt  is  being \nmade to close loss-making public sector enterprises, issues of management and liquidation of the assets \nof closed enterprises are being planned by setting up an asset management cell. In addition, the social \nimpact  of  such  closures  is  being  mitigated  by  issuance  of  guidelines  on  voluntary  retirement  scheme \ndisbursement  and  also  for  training  employees  participating  in  the  voluntary  retirement  scheme  in \nalternative skills in state industrial training institutes. \nFinally,  subprogram  II  is  wholly  aligned  with  the  outcomes  and  new  initiatives  of  the  government  of \nAssam, and has its full public backing. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \n\n1.  Discuss  the  impact  channels  of  the  policy  reform/s  (direct  and  indirect,  short  and  medium  term)  to  the \ncountry  and  major  groups  affected:  With  increased  public  expenditure  on  services  arising  from  enhanced \noutreach  and  cost-effective  delivery,  demand  for  labor  would  increase  (direct  effect,  short  term).  Wide \ndistribution  of  spending  on  services  will  generate  economic  linkages  that  will  further  increase  demand  for \nlabor  (indirect  effect,  short  term).  Vertical  and  horizontal  linkages  would  generate  additional  demand  for \nlabor (indirect effect, medium term). \n\n \n2.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them (refer to social \nanalysis): Prior information on affordability and accessibility by the poor will be obtained through the ADB-\nsupported  project.  Communication  program  to  demonstrate  a  parallel  increase  in  quality  of  access  of \nservices.  \n\nDiscuss  how  the  policy  reform(s)  contribute(s)  to  poverty  reduction,  pro-poor  growth,  and  the  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals:  Policy  reforms,  focusing  on  (i)  substantial  increases  in  own-tax  revenue  through \noptimal utilization of revenue administration and computerization; (ii) rationalization of expenditure through \noutcome-based  budgeting,  O&M  expenditure  estimates,  and  additional  closure  of  loss-generating  PSEs; \nand  (iii)  enhanced  management  capacity  of  debts  including  contingent  liabilities,  will  allow  greater  fiscal \nspace,  thus  enabling  the  government  of  Assam  to  allocate  more  fiscal  resources  to  much-needed  social \nand  economic  infrastructure.  This  will,  in  turn,  promote  private  sector  investment,  thus  leading  to  income \ngeneration  and  employment.  Moreover,  given  that  youth  unemployment  has  historically  been  a  major \ncontributor to the social unrest in Assam, creating greater fiscal space will have a consequential impact on \nthe resolution of the unrest. \n\n \n        (Please see Table A12: Poverty Impact Analysis Matrix, and Supplementary Appendix K: Matrix of Poverty \nImpact and Mitigation Assessment.) \n \n\n \n3. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n83\n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey  Issues.  The key socioeconomic issues that are evident in subprogram II deal with the adverse impacts of \nmismanagement of public resources on the economy as a whole and on the lives of the citizens (largely through \npoor  service  delivery  and  greater  costs  of  accessing  services).  Another  issue  is  how  the  government  can \ntranslate  greater  fiscal  space  (sought  under  this  program)  into  greater  investments  in  social  and  economic \ninfrastructure that will directly address the needs of poor people. Subprogram II attempts to orient the direction of \npublic services towards a results-oriented culture. There are also attempts to simplify provision of services and \nautomate  critical  operations  and  make  them  more  efficient.  The  social  impact  of  critical  elements,  such  as  the \nclosure of PSEs, has been adequately considered. Measures such as these will have positive economic as well \nas social effects, including a greater level of public trust in government, and more efficient and effective service \ndelivery.  \n \nThe primary beneficiaries of subprogram II will be not only the citizens who interact with the public sector on a \ndaily  basis  but  also  businesses  and  other  stakeholders.  All  the  stakeholders  have  the  same  demand  that  the \npublic sector provides better services more efficiently and effectively (i.e., costs charged do not exceed the true \ncosts of service provision). The state government will also ensure that the taskforce for review of PSEs publishes \na  report  on  the  implementation  and  monitoring  of  labor  restructuring,  and  on  the  completion  of  VRS \ncompensation  disbursement  and  retraining  of  displaced  employees  of  the  PSEs  that  have  been  notified  for \nclosure. \n \nMonitoring  and  Evaluation.  Social  indicators  have  been  included  in  the  program  framework  to  facilitate \nmonitoring  of  social  development  activities  or  social  impacts  during  program  implementation.  Regular  reviews \nand evaluation in subprogram II are also planned. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nConsultation  and  Participation.  Stakeholder  groups  engaged  in  the  program  formulation  process  include \ngovernment  agencies  (such  as  the  Department  of  Finance,  Department  of  Public  Enterprise,  Department  of \nRevenue,  Department  of  Pensions,  and  Chief  Minister\u2019s  Office),  think  tanks,  and  business  associations.  The \ndecisions made through consultation and participation processes included (i) closure of loss-making PSEs and \nmitigation  of  social  consequences;  (ii)  fiscal  discipline  (adherence  to  Fiscal  Responsibility  and  Budgetary \nManagement  Act  targets);  (iii)  computerization  and  simplification  of  processes,  including  those  in  value-added \ntax, excise, stamp duty, and land revenue; (iv) requirements related to joining the Government of India pension \nscheme for new employees and making necessary deductions from employees\u2019 salary; and (v) management of \nliabilities, including contingent liabilities, by forming an independent debt management unit. The consultation and \nparticipation  processes  (prior  to  program  finalization)  will  involve  engaging  other  stakeholders  and  getting  their \ncommitment to subprogram II. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and \nmonitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.
