Initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  have  been \nundertaken and summary IEEs are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nThe  proposed  Project  will  interconnect  the  power  grids  in \nAfghanistan and Tajikistan.  \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  scope  will  cover  the  construction  of  a  220 kilovolt \n(kV)  double-circuit  transmission  line  that  will  link  the  hydropower \nstations  located  on  the  Vakhsh  River  in  Tajikistan  to  the  border \ntown  of  Sherkan  Bandar;  then  to  Kunduz,  Baglan,  and  Pul-e-\nKhumri  in  Afghanistan.  This  line  will  be  ultimately  linked  to \nAfghanistan\u2019s major electricity demand centre, Kabul, through the \nAfghan 220 kV corridor currently under construction, linking Pul-e-\nKhumri to Kabul. \n \nThe  Project  will  also  include  upgrading  and  new  investments  in \nTajikistan  that  will  help  reduce  the  winter  power  deficit  by  (i) \nincreasing the available level of generation, and (ii) decreasing the \nlevel  of  technical  losses  in  south  Tajikistan.  Both  measures  will \naim  to  export  300  megawatt  (MW)  to  Afghanistan  and  generate \nadditional 320 gigawatt-hour (GWh) annually in Tajikistan. \n \nThe  Project  is  in  line  with  the  governments\u2019  strategies  and \npolicies.  In  Afghanistan,  the  policy  is  to  provide  reliable  power \nsupply  to  all  Afghans.  In  Tajikistan,  the  policy  is  to  maximize  the \nuse of its hydropower assets. \n \nThe  project  scope  has  been  coordinated  with  other  external \nfunding agencies. \n \nAfghanistan\u2019s  power  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution \nsystems have been severely damaged by years of conflict. There \nis almost no transmission grid and generation is very limited. Lack \nof generation capacity has led to widespread use of load shedding \nthroughout the country, including the capital Kabul where supply is \navailable  only  a  few  hours  a  day.  To  cope  with  this  situation, \nwhere  the  grid  is  unable  to  provide  reliable  supply,  most  of  the \nenergy  users  and  industry  have  shifted  to  decentralized  small-\nscale diesel power generation. Consequently, Kabul has become \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\nthat \n\nrecommend \n\na  highly  polluted  city  and  the  average  generation  cost  has  gone \nup to more than $0.33 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), taking into account \nhigh international market prices for crude oil.  \n \nRegionally,  there  are  large  surpluses  of  generation  in  Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan while Afghanistan is struggling with \na large power deficit. All economic and technical studies show that \nimporting  power  from  neighboring  countries\u2014even  during  a \nlimited  period  of  the  year\u2014has  a  sound  rate  of  return.  Recent \nstudies \ninterconnections  with  neighboring \ncountries  should  be  pursued  and  encouraged  in  parallel  with  the \ndevelopment  of  domestic  generation.  Reconstruction  of  power \nlines between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan is ongoing under Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) financing. A few small interconnections \nbetween  Iran,  Tajikistan,  and  Turkmenistan  are  in  operation  but \nnone of them are able to meet the demand in Kabul city. \n \nTajikistan has an installed generation capacity of 4,405 MW (98% \nhydropower)  and  current  surplus  generation  of  1,500 GWh  per \nyear.  At  a  nominal  value  of  $0.02/kWh  this  surplus  is  potentially \nworth $30 million per year.The surplus is only available for export \nfor 6\u20138 months during the spring-summer period and 90% of the \ninstalled  generation  capacity  in  Tajikistan  is  located  in  the \nsouthern  part  of  the  country.  Tajikistan  has  three  separate \ntransmission  grids  that  are  not  interconnected  (north,  south,  and \neast  grids).  The  only  way  for  Tajikistan  to  export  its  surplus  at \npresent \ntransmission \nconstraints  in  Uzbekistan  mean  that  Tajikistan  is  not  able  to  use \nthe Uzbek grid most of the time. Therefore, water is spilled without \ngenerating  electricity  during  the  summer  and  potential  electricity \nsupply is wasted. \n \nBased on the above, the Project offers a win-win situation where \nAfghanistan\u2019s  lack  of  power  supply  can  be  met  by  Tajikistan\u2019s \nsurplus, which it is currently unable to export.  \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  enhanced  cooperation  in  the \npower  sector  through  transmission  interconnectivity  between  \nTajikistan  and  Afghanistan.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be \n(i) increased  power  export  and  income  generation  capacity  of  \nTajikistan by increasing the capacity of its south grid hydropower \ngeneration,  (ii)  restored  power  supply  and  reduced  cost  for \nconsumers  in  Afghanistan,  (iii)  improved  capacity  of  the  utility \noperation  of  Afghanistan  Electricity  Authority  (DABM),  and \n(iv) improved commercial operation of Barki Tajik (BT).  \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $109.5 million. \nThe  Afghan  component  is  estimated  at  $55.5  million  equivalent, \nincluding  taxes  and  duties  of  $3.3  million  equivalent.

DABM  will \nbe the Implementing Agency (IA) for the Project. The PIU will be \nsupported  by  project  implementation  consultants  financed  under \nthe loan. To mitigate the lack of skill and experience of the EA, the \nProject  includes  provision  of  a  team  of  project  administration \nconsultants. \n \nTajikistan  Component.

Consulting  services  (45  person-\nmonths  international  and  30  person-months  national)  will  be \nrequired to assist MEW and DABM in project implementation. All \nproject-financed  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(April 2006, as amended from time to time) using quality and cost-\nbased selection. MEW will take advance action for the recruitment \nof the consultants. \n \nTajikistan  Component.  Consulting  services  (60  person-months \ninternational  and  80  person-months  national)  will  be  required  to \nassist  BT \nimplementation.  All  project-financed \nconsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (April  2006,  as \namended  from  time  to  time)  using  quality  and  cost-based \nselection.  BT  will  take  advance  action  for  the  recruitment  of  the \nconsultants. \n \nIn  Afghanistan,  the  primary  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  be \nbusiness  enterprises  and  the  population,  who  will  benefit  from \nimproved  supply  of  electricity  and  cost  reduction.  The  economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) of this component is 31.0%. \n \nIn Tajikistan, the economy and BT will benefit from power exports. \nRevenues from the Project are expected to be used to reduce the \nactual  winter  deficit  by  developing  new  generating  assets.  In  the \nshort  term,  they  will  help  to  settle  the  power  bill  from  Uzbekistan \nfor  winter  imports.  This  will  benefit  Tajikistan  power  consumers. \nThe EIRR of this component is 31.1%. \n \nThe  total  net  economic  benefits  of  regional  cooperation  of  the \nProject  are  estimated  to  be  $114.1  million\u201447%  to  Afghanistan \nand  53%  to  Tajikistan.  The  Project  is  a  win-win  example  of \nregional cooperation. \n \nThe  Project  has  been  formulated  to  minimize  potential  technical \nand economic risks.  \n \nThe main risks and assumptions identified are the following: \n \n(i) \n\nThe  overall  political  and  security  situation  in  Afghanistan \nmay delay the Project, and sabotage may affect the future \navailability  of \nline.  This  has  been \naddressed  by  allocating  $700,000  for  security  purposes \nfinancing  and \nduring  construction  as  counterpart \n$1.0 million  for  demining.  During  the  operation  stage,  the \nrisk of blasting the transmission line has been mitigated by \n\ntransmission \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  border \n\nthe fact that the line will supply electricity to local villagers \nfrom \nto  Pul-e-Khumri,  who  will  act  as \nguarantors for the security of the line. \nDefault on payment from the Afghan side for the purchase \nof power import. The intergovernmental agreement signed \nbetween  the  parties  anticipates  that  bank  guarantees  will \nbe  defined  and  set  up  under  the  provisions  of  the  power \npurchase  agreement  (PPA)  to  secure  the  obligations  of \neach party.  \nThe demands in Baglan, Kabul, Kunduz, and Pul-e-Khumri \nregions are not as high as expected. The PPA will include \na  minimum  off-take  volume  from  Afghanistan  that  will  be \ntreated as a \u201ctake or pay\u201d condition. \n\nin \n\nto \n\nIn  addition \n\n(iv)  Weak  implementation  capacity  in  Afghanistan  could  lead \nto  delays \nthe \nimplementation. \nimplementation  consultants  funded  under  the  Project, \nprovision  has  been  made  to  provide  support  to  MEW  for \nproject administration during the whole project period. \nLack  of  competition  and  high  bidding  prices.  The \nprocurement  plan  provides  for  the  issuance  of  a  single \ntender with two separate components\u2014one in Afghanistan \nand  the  other  in  Tajikistan\u2014for  the  entire  line.  This \narrangement  is  expected  to  attract  more  competition  and \nlower bidding prices.  \n\n(v) \n\n(vi)  Weak  performance  of  DABM  during  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  the  Project.  TA  has  been  proposed  to \nmitigate the risk of improper maintenance and operation.  \n\nTwo  advisory  TA  grants  are  attached  to  the  loan:  (i)  $1.2  million \nfor Afghanistan, and (ii) $1.5 million for Tajikistan.  \n \nThe  TA  in  Afghanistan  will  strengthen  the  capability  of  DABM  in \nfinancial,  managerial,  commercial,  and  technical  fields.  It  will \nfinance human resource development and domestic and overseas \ntraining  of  DABM  staff.  It  will  be  financed  as  a  grant  from  ADB\u2019s \nTA funding program. International consultants will be required for \n20 person-months and national consultants for 45 person-months. \nThey  will  be  recruited  as  a  firm  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (April  2006,  as  amended \nfrom time to time) using quality and cost-based selection.

The  Government  of  Tajikistan  is  actively  pursuing  opportunities  to \nsell its excess power in spring and summer, while the Government of Afghanistan has identified \npower imports as the most effective way of meeting its short-term power shortfall. The Project \nwas included in the regional project pipeline and endorsed by the energy and finance ministers \nand key power sector state-owned enterprises of both countries\u2014BT and DABM\u2014through the \nmemoranda of understanding (MOU) signed with ADB on 24 September 2006 by Tajikistan and \non 30 October 2006 by Afghanistan. The Fact-Finding Mission for the Project was undertaken \nfrom 28 August 2006 to 24 September 2006. The Project was formulated based on the findings \nof  the  TA 1  consultants  and  the  ADB  Mission.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII. \n \nA. \n \n3. \nIn  Afghanistan,  the  total  generation  capacity  has  declined  from  about  456  megawatt \n(MW) in the 1990s to about 250 MW in 2005. Only 6\u20139% of the population has access to power, \nof which approximately 30% is in Kabul. The other provinces have even less access, with rural \nareas  being  virtually  unserved.  Of  475  MW  of  original  installed  generation  capacity  (261  MW \nhydropower, 151 MW thermal, and 63 MW diesel generation), much was destroyed or damaged \nduring  the  war  years  and  a  significant  portion  of  transmission  and  distribution  networks  were \ndamaged, pillaged, or stolen.  \n \n4. \nThe power sector master plan, finalized in October 2004, identified power import as the \nfastest  way  to  reinstate  electricity  supply  to  Afghanistan  in  the  short  term.  A  220 kilovolt  (kV) \ndouble-circuit  transmission  line  to  facilitate  import  from  Uzbekistan  is  now  under  construction \nwith  financing  from  ADB  (from  Hairatan/Mazar-e-Sharif  to  Pul-e-Khumri),  Government  of  India \n(from Pul-e-Khumri to Chimtalah), World Bank (from Chimtalah to Kabul), United States Agency \nfor  International  Development  (USAID)  (for  demining  and  security),  and  Germany  (for  the \nconstruction of a 220 kV substations at Mazar-e-Sharif and Pul-e-Khumri). \n \n5. \nTajikistan has a surplus of power generation capacity in the summer months that could \nmeet  part  of  the  power  shortfall  in  Afghanistan.  BT  is  the  state-owned  power  company \nresponsible  for  the  development,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  power  sector;  and  has \ninstalled  generation  capacity  of  4,326  MW.  Its  operational  assets  also  include  about \n4,300 circuit-kilometers  (km)  of  transmission  lines.  Because  of  its  generation  mix  (98% \nhydropower), Tajikistan\u2019s power system is directly linked to hydrologic conditions and seasons. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2004.

Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nTherefore, in summer, Tajikistan has excess energy available for export. Part of this surplus is \nexported through Uzbekistan via its southern grid; the rest is not utilized and Tajikistan is forced \nto spill water without generating electricity because of lack of access to other power markets.  \n \nThe  Government  of  Tajikistan  is  actively  pursuing  new  interconnection projects  with  its \n6. \nneighbors (Afghanistan and Pakistan) that will allow it to sell its excess power. On 9 December \n2005, the minister of Energy of Tajikistan and the minister of Energy and Water of Afghanistan \nsigned  an  MOU  in  Dushanbe  that  recorded  the  interest  and  readiness  of  Tajikistan  to  supply \n300  MW  during  spring  and  summer  to  Afghanistan,  and  as  much  as  Tajikistan  can  provide \nduring  the  autumn  and  winter.  On  21  February  2006,  the  two  ministers  entered  into  an  MOU \nwith the purpose of establishing a framework for enhancing bilateral power exchange and trade \nbetween the two countries.   \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Framework in the Power Sector \n\n \n7. \nIn December 2004, the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) was created in Afghanistan \nby restructuring and merging the responsibilities of the Ministry of Water and Power and some \nresponsibilities  of  the  Ministry  of  Mines  and  Industry.  MEW  is  responsible  for  power,  gas, \npetroleum, and water resources. In the power sector, MEW owns and controls five state-owned \nenterprises responsible for (i) operations, (ii) civil works, (iii) construction, (iv) design consulting, \nand (v) research and development. The enterprises employ over 6,500 people. DABM is the unit \nresponsible for operations of the power generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. It is \nby  far  the  largest  of  these  enterprises,  with  over  5,400  employees.  DABM  will  be  the \nImplementing Agency (IA) for Afghan component of the Project. DABM has very limited capacity \nin terms of all aspects of power utility management and will receive support under the Project.  \n\n \n\nIn Tajikistan, at the policy and regulatory level, the Fuel and Energy Department in the \n8. \nOffice  of  the  President  has  overall  responsibility  for  the  energy  sector.  The  Ministry  of  Energy \n(MOE),  established  in  October  2000,  is  responsible  for  implementation  of  the  energy  policy  of \nthe Government of Tajikistan. The Agency on Anti-Monopoly Policy and Entrepreneurship acts \naccording  to  the  provisions  of  the  Law  on  Natural  Monopolies;  and  regulates  the  tariffs  on \nelectricity, gas, and district heat. It reports directly to the Office of the President. \n \n9. \nAt the operating level, the power sector in Tajikistan is the responsibility of the joint stock \ncompany  BT, 2  a  vertically  integrated  company  in  charge  of  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution of electricity and heat for the whole country\u2014except in the Gorno Badakshan region \nwhere a 25-year concession was given to a private company, Pamir Energy, in 2002. Under the \npresent  institutional  arrangement,  BT  consists  of  a  network  of  10  subsidiary  power  generation \ncompanies,  11  subsidiary  distribution  companies,  and  8  supporting  companies  (such  as  a \nresearch institute and a construction company). BT reports to MOE. BT serves a customer base \nof 969,000 and employs over 9,700 staff. Its biggest customer is Tursundaze Aluminum Smelter \n(TADAZ), which accounts for approximately 40% of the electricity sales in the country. BT will \nbe the Executing Agency (EA) for the Tajik component of the Project. While considerable efforts \nhave been made to improve the commercial operation of BT, support will be provided under the \nProject. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n2   BT became a joint stock company by Decree No. 272 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Tajikistan of 24 July 1992.  \n\n\f2. \n\nEnergy Balance \n\n \n10. \nAfghanistan  is  facing  a  serious  power  supply  shortage  which  is  expected  to  become \nmore acute as demand grows. No new generation capacity is expected in the next few years. \nAreas to be supplied by the Project include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe capital Kabul, with a rapidly growing population of 4\u20135 million people, has no \ncontinuous power supply. The total effective generation capacity is 120 MW but \ntotal  demand  is  estimated  at  300\u2013350  MW,  with  significant  demand  unserved \nthrough the grid system because of inadequate supply. A significant proportion of \nthe supply is met through privately operated small diesel-fired units and through \nthe  DABM-operated  North  West  Kabul  diesel-fired  plant,  for  which  USAID \nfinanced the purchase of fuel until 2006.  \nThe  Kunduz  Baglan  and  Pul-e-Khumri  regions  between \nthe  Tajikistan/ \nAfghanistan  border  and  Kabul,  which  have  a  present  load  of  15  MW  and  an \nunserved demand estimated by DABM to be in excess of 80 MW. \nThe northern part of the country, which has demand of about 130 MW, including \nan estimated suppressed demand of about 80 MW.   \n\n \n11. \nTotal  demand  is  forecast  to  grow  at  5.5%  per  annum  to  about  1,100  MW  by  2020.  To \nmeet  the  growing  demand,  and  with  lack  of  domestic  generation  capacity,  the  2004  power \nsector  master  plan  identified  the  import  of  energy  from  neighboring  countries  as  one  of  the \nshort-term  options  to  increase  power  supply  in  Kabul.  The  Government  plans  to  import  up  to \n150 MW each from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan via Khulm and  Pul-e-Khumri to meet  winter \ndemand,  and  up  to  300  MW  from  Tajikistan  via  Kunduz  and  Pul-e-Khumri  to  meet  summer \ndemand. \n \n12. \nIn Tajikistan, the installed power generation capacity is 4,405 MW, mainly comprising six \nhydropower plants (HPPs) totaling 4,060 MW and two fossil fuel-fired combined heat and power \nstations  totaling  345  MW.  Annual  hydropower  energy  output  is  about  16,000  gigawatt-hour \n(GWh) and electricity is delivered to nearly 100% of the population of almost 7 million. Nurek is \nby far the largest HPP and has been in operation since the mid-1970s with an installed capacity \nof 3,000 MW. It provides considerable regulation of the Vakhsh River and gives stability to the \npower  system  in  Kazakhstan,  Uzbekistan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Tajikistan.  On  average, \nTajikistan currently has a summer surplus of 1,500 GWh available for export. This surplus will \nbe  increased  by  2,700  GWh  when  Sangtuda-I  HPP,  currently  under  construction,  will  be \ncommissioned in April 2009. \n\n \n13. \nTajikistan  has  three  separate  power  systems  (grids):  (i)  the  southern  system,  (ii) the \nnorthern  system  (these  two  are  interconnected  but  only  via  the  Uzbekistan  grid),  and  (iii)  the \nsmall eastern (Pamir) system. The southern system is by far the largest, with installed capacity \nof 3,895 MW on the Vakhsh River and a further 15 MW elsewhere. The Khatlon region is served \nby the southern grid. \n \nBoth  the  southern  system,  which  includes  the  capital  Dushanbe,  and  the  northern \n14. \nsystem have a generation deficit in winter and rely on imported energy from Uzbekistan. This is \nbecause of lack of snowmelt and consequent low river flow in autumn and winter. The strategy \nof  the  Government  of  Tajikistan  is  to  increase  the  amount  of  electricity  available  during  the \nwinter  by  (i)  developing  new  generating  plants  on  the  Vakhsh  River;  (ii)  rehabilitating  and \nupgrading  the  existing  schemes;  and  (iii)  reducing  technical,  transmission,  and  distribution \nlosses while seeking new power markets for exporting its surplus energy in summer. \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n    \n\n3. \n\nPricing/Tariff Issues \n \na. \n\nAfghanistan \n\n \nDABM  recently  doubled  tariffs  from  an  average  of  $0.0416  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  to \n15. \n$0.0830/kWh. The tariff increases took effect on 23 September 2006. This significant increase \nin tariffs was based on advice from USAID that it will no longer fund the purchase of diesel to \nrun  the  North  West  Kabul  diesel  generator.  USAID  was  subsidizing  the  cost  of  diesel  in  the \namount  of  $50 million  per  year  for  the  last  2\u20133 years.  The  higher  tariffs  will  help  to  defray  the \ncost of diesel purchases that DABM will incur during the next 2\u20133 winter seasons until electricity \nimports from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan replace the expensive diesel generation. \n \nAssuming that sufficient imported electricity is available from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan \n16. \nto fully replace diesel generation, the new tariff significantly improves the financial sustainability \nof DABM. The average supply cost of DABM is estimated to be $0.080/kWh compared with the \nnew  tariff  of  $0.083/kWh  As  Uzbekistan\u2019s  supply  is  limited  to  only  150  MW,  some  diesel \ngenerated  power  will  be  still  be  needed  during  winter  and  the  average  annual  supply  cost  is \nlikely to be higher than $0.083/kWh. Therefore, DABM will need to increase real tariffs further to \nreach  cost  recovery  level  in  the  event  that  only  limited  import  supplies  are  available  over  the \nlong  term.  This  will  be  important  for  Afghanistan\u2019s  ability  to  pay  for  power  imports  and  the \nsustainability of the Project.  \n \n\nb. \n\nTajikistan \n\n \nThe  Government  of  Tajikistan  has  confirmed  to  ADB  that  it  is  developing  an  electricity \n17. \ntariff  increase  strategy  in  line  with  the  commitment  made  to  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  in \nJanuary 2006.3 In  September  2006,  BT  submitted  a  proposal  to  increase  tariffs  to  reach  an \naverage  tariff  of  $0.021/kWh  (in  2003  terms)  by  2010.  This  is  a  significant  increase  from  the \ncurrent  average  tariffs  of  $0.006/kWh.  The  new  tariff  is  expected  to  be  endorsed  by  the \nPresident and ratified by parliament in late November.  \n \n18. \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) recognizes that rising tariffs mean that the social safety \nnet  needs  to  be  strengthened  to  mitigate  their  effect  on  the  poorest  consumers.  The  present \nsize  of  the  social  welfare  tariff  block  is  250  kWh/month,  which  is  relatively  high.  The  current \nsocial  safety  net  includes  the  Energy  Compensation  Mechanism,  which  provides  a  100% \nsubsidy for poor consumers that earn less than TJS20/capita/month. It is envisaged that rising \ntariffs  will  raise  the  tax  revenues  from  BT\u2019s  profits  and  additional  dividend  income  to  the \nGovernment  of  Tajikistan  to  levels  sufficient  to  fund  the  safety  net.  MOF  has  committed  to \nrelend  the  concessionary  loans  from  ADB  and  co-financiers\u2019  at  the  OCR  rate  of  the  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)    and  use  the  difference  in  the  interest  to  partly  fund  the  social \nsafety net together with additional budget provisions. Rationalization and tariff increases will be \ncrucial for the long-term sustainability of the power sector in Tajikistan, together with maximizing \nexport revenues. \n \n \n\nGovernments\u2019 Strategy and Plans \n\n4. \n\na. \n\nAfghanistan \n\n \nIn February 2004, the Government of Afghanistan formulated an electricity sector policy \n19. \nand power sector road map (Appendix 2). The main elements will enable the establishment of a \n\n                                                 \n3 MOU on Energy Sector Development Strategy signed in Dushanbe in January 2006. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fregulatory  framework;  and  restructuring,  unbundling,  and  commercialization  of  the  sector.  The \npolicy  plans  to  supply  the  entire  country  with  reliable  power  and  create  730,000  more \nconnections  by  2010.  The  Government  of  Afghanistan  aims  to  make  more  power  available  in \nthe  main  regions  by  (i)  investing  in  system  rehabilitation;  (ii)  increasing  supply,  partly  by \ntransmission,  and  distribution \nimporting  more  power;  and  (iii)  expanding  generation, \ninfrastructure.  \n \n20. \nThe  reform  plan  of  the  Government  of  Afghanistan  is  to  corporatize  and  eventually \nunbundle DABM, appoint a new board of directors, and form four regional vertically integrated \nbusiness  units.  MEW  will  be  responsible  for  sector  policy  and  planning,  and  will  continue  to \nprepare  and  implement  sector  policies,  coordinate  external  assistance programs,  and  improve \ngovernance of the sector.   \n\nb. \n\nTajikistan \n\nits \n\nimprove \n\nfinancial  viability.  This  policy \n\n \n21. \nIn  2005,  the  Government  of  Tajikistan  developed  a  strategy  based  on  a  two-track \napproach for the domestic and export markets. The first track focuses on the domestic market, \nand comprises a set of policy and investment measures aimed to bring the sector to reasonable \noperating  conditions  and \nthe \nimplementation of a medium-term tariff policy; (ii) a social protection policy for energy services \nto improve the effectiveness of the scheme and ensure a more targeted approach to support the \npoor;  and  (iii)  an  institutional  reform  policy  for  the  energy  sector  to  improve  the  transparency \nand  efficiency  of  operations,  enable  electricity  trade,  and  pave  the  way  for  private  sector \nparticipation  in  the  sector.  The  second  track  focuses  on  increasing  electricity  exports\u2014first \nusing  existing  seasonal  surpluses  in  the  summer,  then  by  developing  newer  hydroelectric \ncapacities  for  export  to  countries  in  the  region  (including  Afghanistan,  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina,  Iran,  Pakistan,  and  Russia).  Some  seasonal  exports  to  Afghanistan  and  Russia  via \nUzbekistan  are  already  occurring,  and  the  Government  of  Tajikistan  is  developing  additional \nhydropower capacities with foreign investors, e.g., from Russia and Iran. \n\nincludes  (i) \n\n \n\n \n\n5. \n\nLessons  \n\nThe  key  lessons  learned  from  ADB  operations  in  Central  Asia  in  terms  of  regional \n22. \ncooperation  are  that  Central  Asian  countries  are  still  in  a  transition  stage.  Commercial \narrangements  between  governments  are  quite  often  dictated  more  by  political  than  economic \nconsiderations.  For  example,  Tajikistan  could  not  maximize  the  use  of  its  excess  generation \nthrough export sales during the summer season because of the unwillingness of Uzbekistan to \nimport Tajik power surplus, and transmission constraints in Uzbekistan. Therefore, excess water \nis  spilled  without  generating  electricity.  The  Regional  Transmission  Modernization  Project4 in \nTajikistan and Uzbekistan aimed to develop power trade relations between the two countries by \nmaximizing  the  use  of  hydropower  generation  but  it  could  not  be  implemented  because  the \ncountries were unable to agree on the terms of a power trade framework agreement. Given this \nexperience,  agreement  on  power  trade  should  be  achieved  during  the  project  design  stage. \nThese lessons are included in the project design. The intergovernmental agreement on power \ntrade  was  a  condition  for  loan  negotiations.  The  agreement  was  signed  and  is  dated  17 \nNovember 2006. A power purchase agreement (PPA) is currently in force for the existing 8 MW \ninterconnection  between  the  two  countries  until  2009  and  a  new  PPA  will  be  agreed  between \nthe two power utilities as stipulated in the intergovernmental agreement. \n \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President on a Proposed Loan to the Republic of Tajikistan and \n\nUzbekistan for the Regional Power Transmission Modernization Project. Manila. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fAnother important lesson is implementation delay in Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Delays \n23. \nhave  occurred  in  both  countries  mainly  because  of  lack  of  familiarity  with  ADB  guidelines  and \nprocedures. The Project will be the third ADB project in both countries and such delays should \nno  longer  be  encountered.  However,  in  Afghanistan,  MEW  still  lacks  sufficient  skills  so  the \nproject  design  includes  provision  to  strengthen  the  existing  project  implementation  unit  (PIU) \nand to assist MEW in implementing and administering the Project in a timely manner. \n \n24. \nCompetition  in  Afghanistan  is  weak  because  of  security  reasons,  and  bid  prices  are \nhigher  than  the  engineer\u2019s  estimates.  To  improve  competition,  the  project  design  involves  a \nsingle bid for both the Afghan and Tajik parts of the transmission line. This is expected to attract \nadditional bidders as about 75% of the works have to be carried out in Tajikistan where there \nare no security issues. \n \n25. \nPrevious loan covenants were too ambitious and could not be met within the agreed time \nframe.  Treatment  of  the  arrears  of  the  aluminum  smelter  TADAZ  with  BT  reached  agreement \nbut the target for accounts receivable of 3 months was not met. In addition, the commitment to \nincrease tariffs was not met as the tariff targets were too high. With hindsight, the time given to \nreach the targets may have been too tight and the targets too ambitious. While it is useful to set \nchallenging  targets,  they  must  be  realistic  and  achievable,  and  the  EA  management  must  be \ncommitted  to  achieve  them.  The  pace  of  sector  reform  has  been  slow.  The  unbundling  of  BT \nand tariff increases are behind schedule and need to be reconsidered. To address these issues, \na TA is included which will help to improve the corporate governance of BT and facilitate sector \nreforms and financial viability.  \n \nADB  Strategy.  ADB\u2019s regional cooperation program, which links and complements the \n26. \nindividual  country  programs,  has  focused  on identifying  infrastructure  needs  and  providing  the \ninvestment  environment  for  promoting  cross-border  trade  in  the  areas  of  energy,  trade,  and \ntransportation. In the energy sector, ADB\u2019s focus is on (i) maximizing the utilization of national \nresources  and  assets;  (ii)  benefiting  neighboring  countries  by  rationalizing  and  encouraging \nregional energy trade, based on market principles and (iii) rehabilitating existing infrastructure. \nThe Project is fully in line with ADB\u2019s regional and country-specific strategies. \n \n\n6. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\nfor  management \n\n \n27. \nAfghanistan.  The  power  sector  in  Afghanistan  has  received  substantial  support  from \nseveral aid agencies including (i) ADB: transmission; (ii) World Bank: distribution, generation in \nimprovement  and \nKabul  and  other  key  cities,  capacity  building \ncommercialization of DABM; (iii) German development cooperation through KfW banking group \n(KfW):  rehabilitation  of  power  distribution  networks  and  hydropower  plants  serving  the  Kabul \narea;  and  (iv)  USAID:  institutional  strengthening  and  restructuring  of  MEW,  rehabilitation  of \npower generation plants, and purchase of essential fuel supplies. The governments of India and \nIran  have  also  provided  assistance  to  finance  key  power  transmission  links  (summarized  in \nAppendix 3 and detailed in Supplementary Appendix I). \n \nTajikistan.  The  power  sector  in  Tajikistan  has  received  support  totaling  $123  million \n28. \nfrom several aid agencies including (i) World Bank: cofinancing the Pamir Private Power Project \nand  a  loss  reduction  project;  (ii)  Islamic  Development  Bank  (IsDB):  Dushanbe  substations \nrehabilitation,  construction  of  small  hydropower  plants,  and  transmission  line  feasibility  study; \n(iii) Kuwait Fund for Arabic and Economic Development (KFAED): Dushanbe distribution system \nrehabilitation;  (iv)  Swiss  State  Secretariat  for  Economic  Affairs  (SECO)  cofinancing  of  several \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fpower  projects;  and  (v)  ADB:  Power  Rehabilitation  Project.5 The  Aga  Khan  Foundation  has \ninvested equity in the Pamir Private Power Project (summarized in Appendix 3 and detailed in \nSupplementary Appendix I). \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  enhanced  regional  cooperation  through  transmission \n29. \ninterconnectivity  in  the  power  sector  between  Afghanistan  and  Tajikistan.  The  outcome  of  the \nProject  will  be  (i)  increased  power  export  and  income  generation  capacity  of  Tajikistan  by \nincreasing the capacity of its south grid hydropower generation; (ii) restored power supply and \nreduced  cost  for  consumers  in  Afghanistan;  (iii)  improved  capacity  of  the  utility  operation  of \nDABM, and (iv) improved commercial operation of BT. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs  \n\n \n30. \n \n\n \n \n\nThe Project consists of Afghan and Tajik components.  \n\n1. \n\nAfghan Component  \n\n \n\nPart A: Transmission Line that includes: \n\nA  new  double-circuit  river  crossing  at  Sherkan  Bandar  city  (50% to  be  financed \nunder the Tajik component).  \nApproximately  157  km  of  new  double-circuit  220  kV  transmission  line  from \nSherkan  Bandar  river  border  crossing  to  Pul-e-Khumri  via  Kunduz  and  Baglan \nsubstations. \nDemining  of  the  route  for  the  transmission  line  between  Pul-e-Khumri  and \nSherkan Bandar. \n\nPart B: Substations that includes: \n \n\nConstruction of new 220kV switchyards at Kunduz and Baglan substations, and \nsupply and installation of high accuracy export/import metering equipment at the \nnew 220 kV switchyard of Kunduz substation, and  \nconnection  of  the  new  220  kV  transmission  line  to  the  220kV  Pul-e-Khumri \nsubstation. \n\n2. \n\nTajik Component  \n\nPart A: Transmission Line that includes: \n\nConstruction  of  a  new  220  kV  double-circuit  river  crossing  at  Karadum  village \n(50% of the cost to be financed under the Afghan component). \nConstruction of approximately 118 km of new double-circuit 220 kV transmission \nline from Karadum river border crossing to Sangtuda substation.   \n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB.  2000.

The PPA will define: (i) the parties; (ii) the term of \nthe  PPA  (20  years);  (iii)  buyer  minimum  purchase  obligations;  (iv)  seller  minimum  supply \nobligation; (v) penalties for failure to supply or failure to sell; (vi) delivery and billing point; (vii) \nprice and terms of payment; (viii) condition for effectiveness; (ix) payment process and financial \nguarantees  on  the  seller  and  buyer  side  (access  to  necessary  property  and  construction \nfacilities and local labor, if any), and form and operation mode for cross-border assets. A copy of \nthe intergovernmental agreement is in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n\n2. \n\nAfghanistan \n\n \n32. \nPrivate  Sector  Participation/Strengthening  DABM  and  North  Electric  Power \nSystem  Capacity.  In  Afghanistan,  the  power  sector  needs  large  amounts  of  investment  in \ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution.  The  Government  of  Afghanistan  has  relied  on  aid \nfinance  to  meet  its  capital  expenditure,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  are \nsometimes externally financed. It is unable to recover full operation cost and this is worsened by \ngrowing insecurity and safety concerns. The dependency on aid financing of the Government of \nAfghanistan is likely to continue in the short to medium term, as the overall investment climate is \nnot favorable to private or other investors. However, in the interim, aid financing will benefit the \nprivate  sector  by  reducing  operational,  regulatory,  and  policy  uncertainties.  Private  sector \nparticipation  will  take  two  forms:  (i)  large-scale  involvement  (not  necessarily  direct  equity \ninvestment) in generation to supply base load for Kabul or other main cities, and (ii) small-scale \ngeneration  and  distribution  (by  domestic  entrepreneurs)  in  isolated  rural  areas.  Private  sector \ninvestment  barely  exists  in  the  energy  sector  but  it  may  be  the  only  viable  option  to  electrify \nlarge parts of the country quickly. Many years of war have left a weak power supply monopoly, \nunlike  many  other  countries  facing  deregulation.  Therefore,  regulation,  rules,  and  agencies\u2014\nwhile urgently needed\u2014must be carefully crafted so as not to discourage investment. \n \n33. \nOngoing  construction  of  the  transmission  line  from  Pul-e-Khumri  to  Kabul,  delayed \npreparation of the Second Emergency Power Rehabilitation Project under World Bank financing,  \n\n\frehabilitation of the Kabul distribution network, and the Project underscore the need for a timely \ndecision by the Government of Afghanistan on the management and operational arrangements \nfor  these  vital  assets.  The  Government  of  Afghanistan  appreciates  the  need  to  develop  this \narrangement  and  carry  out  competitive  bidding  to  select  a  management  contractor  for              \n3\u20135 years. This arrangement will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of DABM and North \nElectric Power System in delivering reliable power supply in Afghanistan. The financial viability \nand  strength  of  DABM  and  North  Electric  Power  System  will  be  enhanced  through  improved \naccounts receivable management, asset management, business planning, and sound financial \nmanagement  practices.  ADB,  together  with  the  loan,  will  provide  assistance  along  with  the \nWorld  Bank  and  other  donors  involved  in  the  power  sector  in  Afghanistan  in  identifying  and \nfinancing  the  necessary  preparatory  works  to  enable  private  sector  participation  through  a \nmanagement contract.  \n \n34. \nDemining  Operations.  Although  the  major  portion  of  the  transmission  line  passes \nthrough cleared terrain, a few zones have been identified near Kunduz where demining will be \nrequired. The specialized agency selected under the bidding process will have to clear the route \nfor  the  development  of  the  transmission  network  from  Pul-e-Khumri  to  Shekhanbandar.  An \nestimated $1 million for demining is included in the project loan amount.  \n \n35. \nProject  Implementation  Unit.  MEW  will  use  the  services  of  the  existing  PIU.  ADB \nrequested MEW to add an additional staff member to the PIU to take the Project into account. \nMEW was also requested to appoint a dedicated full-time project director who will be in charge, \nin addition to the normal administrative tasks inherent to project management, to negotiate and \ncoordinate with the Tajik counterparts.   \n \n\n3. \n\nTajikistan \n\n \n36. \nPrivate  Sector  Participation  in  Generation.  The  Government  of  Tajikistan  has \nsucceeded in attracting foreign investors in the Tajik power sector. RAO Unified Energy System  \n(UES)  of  Russia  is  currently  completing  the  670  MW  Sangtuda-I  hydropower  plant  on  the \nVakhsh  River  under  a  build-own-operate  scheme.  The  Government  of  Iran  has  expressed \ninterest in the construction of Sangtuda-II (220 MW) hydropower plant on the same river under a \nbuild-operate-transfer  scheme.  Other  private  investors  have  expressed  interest  in  the \ndevelopment  of  new  hydropower  generation  facilities.  This  will  increase  Tajikistan  generation \ncapacity and allow firm power year-round exports. The Project provides an incentive for private \nsector participation in the form of an export market to Afghanistan and further to Pakistan. \n \n37. \nRestructuring  and  Commercialization  of  BT.  The  energy  sector  plan,  agreed  under \nthe Power Rehabilitation Project (footnote 6) in November 2000, required the implementation of \na restructuring plan for BT. The key requirements of this plan included: (i) implementation of the \nenergy  law,  (ii)  creation  of  a  ministry  of  energy,  (iii)  adoption  of  a  comprehensive \ncommercialization and corporatization plan for BT (by December 2003), and (iv) unbundling of \nBT into incorporated independent electricity companies by December 2004. \n \nimplemented. \n38.  Most  of \nHowever,  BT  has  not  met  the  target  date  for  unbundling.  The  consultants  who  are  currently \nworking under this project recommended that managerial, commercial, financial, and technical \nskills  should  be  identified  and  strengthened  before  the  unbundling  takes  place.  In  preparation \nfor unbundling, ADB will, together with the loan, provide a TA that will set in place conditions to \nimprove  corporate  governance  of  BT  for  3\u20135  years  to  meet  agreed  financial,  technical, \noperational,  and  commercial  objectives.  A  management  contract  will  be  pursued  where  the \ncontractor\u2019s performance will be measured by setting key performance indicator targets relating \n\nrestructuring  plan  have  been \n\nthe  elements  of \n\nthe \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nto  (i)  improving  the  reliability  of  the  electric  power  networks;  (ii) expanding  access  to  network \nservices;  (iii)  reducing  costs  and  improving  commercial  operations,  particularly  in  the  area  of \nbilling and collection; and (iv) improving corporate functions and processes, including enterprise \ngovernance. \n \n39. \nProject  Implementation  Unit.  The Government of Tajikistan has reformed the existing \nPIU within BT. Under the new arrangement, a centralized project management unit (PMU) will \nhandle  all  projects  in  the  power  sector  financed  by  international  finance  institutions.  The \ncentralized PMU will be managed and controlled by the Government of Tajikistan and financed \nby  BT.  Taking  into  account  the  regional  dimension  of  the  Project,  ADB  and  the  Government \nagreed  to  set  up  a  separate  PIU  within  BT  with  a  project  director  reporting  directly  to  the \nchairperson of BT. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan  \n\n40. \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $109.5  million  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies,  financing  charges  during  construction,  taxes,  and  duties.  The  cost  of  the \nAfghanistan  component  is  $55.5  million  (inclusive  of  taxes  and  duties)  and  the  Tajikistan \ncomponent  is  estimated  to  cost  $54.0  million  (exclusive  of  taxes  and  duties).

The  loan  in \nvarious  currencies  equivalent  to  $35.0  million  in  Special  Drawing  Rights  will  have  a  32-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years with an interest rate of 1% during the grace period and \n1.5% thereafter. The Government of Afghanistan will relend the loan proceeds denominated in \nlocal currency to DABM on the same terms as the ADB loan. The Government of Afghanistan \nhas  approached  the  Afghanistan  Reconstruction  Trust  Fund  (ARTF)  and  other  cofinancers  to \ncofinance the Project with a $16.5 million loan. It is assumed that the loan will be on the same \nterms  as  the  ADB  loan.  As  the  budget  for  infrastructure  projects  of  the  Government  of \nAfghanistan is limited, ADB and the co-financier have agreed to fund the entire investment with \na minimum  contribution from the Government of Afghanistan of $4 million to cover local taxes \nand duties and security during construction.   \n \n43. \nThe Government of Tajikistan has requested a loan of $21.5 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources  to  help  finance  the  Project  which  will  cost  $54.0  million.  The  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  $21.5  million  in  Special  Drawing  Rights  will  have  a  32-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years with an interest rate of 1% during the grace period and 1.5% \nthereafter. The Government of Tajikistan will relend the loan proceeds to BT, at an interest rate \napplicable to ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility with a grace period of 5 years and repayment \nperiod of 25 years. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Government. Cofinancing in \nthe amounts of $8.5 million from OFID will be provided on a joint basis and $10.0 million from \nIsDB, will be provided on a parallel basis on similar concessional terms as the ADB loan. BT will \nprovide  funding  of  $14.0  million,  partly  through  the  supply  of  aluminum  cables  for  the \ntransmission lines. However, it was made clear to BT that this did not imply that ADB condoned \nthe barter arrangement with TADAZ; rather, this was being done partly to help liquidate the idle \naluminum cable stock.   \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n \n44. \nFor Afghanistan, MEW will be the EA for the Project. It will have overall responsibility for \nimplementation of the Project\u2014specifically, the timely mobilization of counterpart financing and \ncofinancing, as required. It will carry out supervision of the works and issuance of work permits, \nsupervision of testing, and commissioning. DABM will be the IA and will be responsible for O&M \nof the facilities. Taking into account the regional dimension of the Project, MEW will appoint a \nfull-time project director who will be responsible\u2014in addition to the normal project tasks related \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nto project administration\u2014for coordinating with the Tajik counterparts to ensure the smooth and \ntimely progress of the Project. To mitigate the lack of skill and experience of the EA, the Project \nincludes provision of an advisory team in project administration as described in Appendix 15. \n \nFor Tajikistan, BT will be the EA for the Project. It will appoint a full-time project director \n45. \nwho  will  be  responsible\u2014in  addition \nto  project \nadministration\u2014for coordinating with the Afghan counterparts to ensure the smooth and timely \nprogress of the Project. A new and independent PIU will be set up for this Project.  \n \n\nthe  normal  project \n\ntasks  related \n\nto \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period  \n\n46. \nThe Project will be implemented in 24 months, with target completion by 31 March 2009 \nfor the Afghan and Tajik components of the transmission line. The other Tajik components are \nexpected to be completed by 30 June 2010. Project implementation will commence in February \n2007.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement   \n\n \n47. \nAll goods and services procured under the ADB and OFID loans will be in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time), based on the \njoint  assessment  of  the  Borrower\u2019s  capacity  to  handle  the  procurement  activities.  For \nconstruction of the transmission line and in order to increase competition, it is envisaged to have \na single tender for both Afghan and Tajik components. However evaluation of the bid, contract \nnegotiations and contract award will be carried out separately for each component in order not \nto  penalize  the  Tajik  component  with  high  costs  experienced  in  past  projects  in  Afghanistan. \nThe ongoing project preparatory TA6 will fund the preparation of the full bidding documents. This \nwill  permit  a  contract  to  be  signed  for  construction  in  early  2007  and  ensure  the  timely \ncommissioning of the line.   \n \n48. \nThe  main  packages  (i.e.,  the  transmission  line  and  substation  works)  will  be  procured \nunder  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  using  a  single-stage  two-envelope  procedure  on \nthe basis of engineering, procurement, and construction contracts (turnkey contracts). Metering \nwill also be procured under ICB using the single-stage one-envelope procedure. For Tajikistan, \ninstallation of the meters will be done by BT staff as part of counterpart financing. Rehabilitation \nof  canals,  which  will  be  entirely  financed  as  counterpart  financing,  will  be  procured  following \nnational competitive bidding (NCB). \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n49. \nConsulting  services  will  be  needed  to  assist  BT  and  MEW/DABM  in  implementing  the \nProject. The consultants will also assist BT and MEW/DABM in environmental management and \nmonitoring social and resettlement safeguards. In Afghanistan, international consulting services \n(about  45 person-months)  and  national  consulting  services  (about  30  person-months)  will  be \nrequired for project management, detailed design, preparation of bidding documents, assistance \ntesting  and \nin  procurement,  construction  supervision, \ncommissioning  of  the  plants.  In  Tajikistan,  about  60  person-months  of  international  and \n80 person-months  of  national  consulting  services  will  be  required.  The  consultants  will  also \nassist  BT  and  MEW/DABM  in  environmental  management  and  monitoring  social  and \nresettlement  safeguards.  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  as  a  firm  by  BT  and  MEW/DABM  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time \n                                                 \n6 ADB.  2004.

The  consultant  is \nexpected  to  be  fielded  in  mid-2007.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 10. \n \n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n50. \nADB\u2019s  policy  Anticorruption  (1998)  will  be  enforced.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  the  Government  of  Afghanistan  and  the \nGovernment  of  Tajikistan  are  aware  that  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \nIn particular for Tajikistan, payment of the electricity exports to Afghanistan will be done \n51. \nthrough  a  transit  account  established  at  a  nominated  bank  for  the  purposes  of  collecting \nrevenues  generated  by  supply  of  electricity  to  Afghanistan.  The  details  of  the  account  will  be \nprovided in the PPA. The funds accumulated in this account will be used by BT exclusively for \nthe purposes of maintenance and rehabilitation of the existing facilities and for new investments \nby agreement with the Government of Tajikistan. The account will be subject to annual audit by \nan external auditor acceptable to ADB.   \n \nBT and MEW/DABM will establish within 1 year from the date of effectiveness a website \n52. \nthat  will  present  information  on  externally  funded  projects.  For  this  Project,  the  website  will \nprovide  information  on,  among  others,  financial  statements  of  BT  and  MEW/DABM;  and \nprocurement  activities,  including  the  list  of  participating  bidders,  name  of  the  winning  bidder, \nbasic details on bidding procedures adopted, amount of the contract awarded, the list of goods \nand/or services purchased, and their intended and actual utilization.  \n\n \n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n53. \nAll disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2001). Direct payment procedures will be utilized for the procurement \nand consulting services contracts. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n54. \nThere will be continued monitoring and evaluation of project implementation, with timely \nreporting deadlines. MEW and BT (as EAs under the Project) will prepare quarterly reports on \nthe  progress  of  project  implementation  and  provide  ADB  and  the  co-financiers  with  copies  of \nthese  reports.  ADB  will  review  the  implementation  of  the  Project  on  a  regular  basis,  at  least \nonce  a  year,  and  will  monitor  overall  performance  of  each  of  the  EAs  and  DABM.  Within \n3 months  of  project  completion,  each  of  the  EAs  will  provide  ADB  with  a  project  completion \nreport  covering  details  of  implementation  and  other  information  required  by  ADB.  Each  of  the \nEAs  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  the  Project  and  will  have  the  accounts \naudited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Copies  of  audited  project \naccounts will be provided to ADB within 6 months of the end of each relevant fiscal year.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Management System \n\n \n55. \nEach of the governments, through the EA and with the assistance of the implementation \nconsultants,  will  establish  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness  a  comprehensive  project \nperformance  management  system  acceptable  to  ADB  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  project \nperformance as a whole, as well as delivery of the planned facilities and project benefits under \nthe Afghan and Tajik components.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n56. \nRegular annual ADB review missions will be undertaken to discuss the latest progress, \nand  address  current  and  emerging  problems  by  developing  mitigating  measures.  An  in-depth \nmidterm review will be undertaken not later than in 2008 by ADB together with the EAs, the IA, \nand  co-financiers,  as  appropriate  to  assess  whether  the  project  outcomes  are  likely  to  be \nachieved. The midterm review will focus on relevant institutional, administrative, organizational, \ntechnical, environmental, social, economic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may have \nan impact on the performance of the Project and its continuing viability. \n \nG. \n \n\nExecuting Agencies \n\n1. \n\nAfghanistan \n\n \n57. \nDABM,  is  responsible  to  MEW  for  O&M  of  the  country\u2019s  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution  assets  as  well  as  for  metering,  billing,  and  revenue  collection.  It  employs  about \n5,400 people. \n \n58. \nFinancial  Management  and  Sustainability.  Financial  management  assessment  of \nDABM  was  undertaken  to  evaluate  its  ability  to  undertake  and  fulfill  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary \nrequirements  for  the  Project.  While  the  financial  management  for  the  IA  has  been  improving \nover  the  last  few  years,  it  was  still  found  to  be  unsatisfactory.  Capacity  and  institutional \ndevelopment  have  been  proposed  under  the  Project,  which  will  help  to  further  strengthen \nfinancial management capacity. A World Bank-funded program is currently in place to improve \nthe financial management of DABM, including improvement of its accounting systems and billing \nand  collection.  The  ADB-proposed  attached  TA  will  further  strengthen  DABM\u2019s  capacity  in \naccounting and financial management, which would further improve the financial management \nof DABM in the short to medium term. \n \n59. \nA review of DABM\u2019s past financial accounts showed that it had insufficient cash flow to \neven  meet  its  operational  requirements  and  that  its  financial  position  needs  to  be  significantly \nimproved. Recognizing this, on 23 September 2006, the Government of Afghanistan increased \nthe average tariff by almost 100% to $0.083/kWh. This tariff increase, together with the benefit \nof  cheap  imported  electricity  from  the  Project,  will  substantially  improve  its  financial  situation. \nAssuming  continued  annual  tariff  increases  at  the  rate  of  inflation,  DABM  will  be  able  to \ngenerate  sufficient  cash  flows  to  cover  operating  costs  and  meet  its  future  debt  servicing \nobligations.  The  summary  projected  income  statement,  cash  flow,  and  a  balance  sheet  are  in \nAppendix 8 and detailed analysis is provided in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n\n2. \n\nTajikistan \n\n \n60. \nThe EA for the Tajikistan component, BT, is responsible for the O&M of the power sector \nfor most of the country including generation, transmission, and distribution. BT, which reports to \nMOE, employed 9,800 staff in 2005.  \n\n\f \n61. \nFinancial  Management  and  Sustainability. Financial management assessment of BT \nwas satisfactory, but further strengthening of institutional and financial capacity will be needed \nto meet best practice standards. Under the Project, TA support for commercialization of BT will \nbe provided and a management contract will be pursued.  \n \n62. \nA  review  of  the  past  financial  statements  indicates  that  revenues  are  only  sufficient  to \ncover current operating expenses. Tariff increases are badly needed for financial sustainability. \nWith  the  commitment  of  the  Government  of  Tajikistan  to  increase  the  current  tariffs \nprogressively  from  an  average  of  $0.006/kWh  to  $0.021/kWh  (in  2003  terms)  by  2010,  and \npartly assisted by the incremental income from the Project, BT\u2019s financial situation is expected \nto  improve  greatly  and  will  enable  it  to  meet  its  operating  costs  and  future  debt  servicing \nobligations.  The  summary  projected  income  statement,  cash  flow,  and  a  balance  sheet  are  in \nAppendix 8 and detailed analysis is provided in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nThe  Project  includes  two  TAs  to  improve  the  capacity  of  IAs  both  in  Afghanistan  and \n\n \n63. \nTajikistan. The rationale and details of the TAs are discussed below. \n \nAfghanistan TA. This is designed to improve the capacity of DABM in utility operations. \n64. \nDABM  depends  heavily  on  the  Government  of  Afghanistan  and  donor  support  to  fund  its \noperational  and  capital  expenditure  programs.  It  is  necessary  to  improve  the  institutional, \ntechnical,  and  financial  capacity  of  DABM.  Two  key  areas  would  improve  DABM\u2019s  overall \nperformance:  (i)  strengthening  institutional  and  management  capacity  to  meet  operational \ndemands, and (ii) improving and expanding the capacity for technical employees of DABM. The \nTA is expected to start by March 2007 and be completed by March 2009. \n \nStrengthening the institutional management capacity of DABM will make it able to handle \n65. \nroutine  operational  work  in  the  areas  of  planning,  budgeting,  financial  management,  and \naccounting. Of these, special attention should be given to improvement of billing, collection, and \nmetering  skills.  Improving  and  expanding  capacity  for  technical  employees  of  DABM  is  the \nsecond  area  of  the  TA.  While  capacity  improvement  through  intensive  training  courses  in \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution is needed for DABM, training priority should be given \nto  transmission  because  of  the  nature  of  the  Project.  Therefore,  setting  up  long-term  training \ncourses for DABM\u2019s current staff and future employees is for the long-term sustainability of the \nProject. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,320,000. The TA will be entirely financed on \na grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program in the amount of $1,200,000. The government of \nAfghanistan  will  finance  the  remaining  $120,000  through  in-kind  contribution.  The  TA  will \nfinance the services of international consultants for 20 person-months and national consultants \nfor 45 person-months. They will be recruited as a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  using  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection  method  (full  technical \nproposal). The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 13. \n \nTajikistan  TA.  This  is  designed  to  strengthen  and  improve  internal  management  and \n66. \ncustomer  responsiveness  and  reliability  of  BT,  a  public-owned  power  company  in  Tajikistan. \nBT\u2019s management and institutional capacity have  been improved but its services are still poor \nand inefficient. While unbundling is the long-term solution and a target for BT in the short term, \nBT needs to develop and establish an efficient management and rational institutional structure \nto effectively design and control the planning, budgeting, revenue management, and corporate \naccounting system. These skills should be identified and good corporate governance practices \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nshould  be  in  place  before  BT\u2019s  unbundling  takes  place.  The  TA  is  expected  to  start  by \nMarch 2007 and be completed by September 2009. \n \n67. \nThe  outputs  of  the  TA  will  be:  (i)  preparation  of  the  legal  framework  enabling  the \nimplementation  of  a  management  or  similar  form  of  contract;  (ii)  definition  of  performance \ncriteria (commercial, financial, and technical); and (iii) selection of a management contractor for \n3\u20135  years  to  introduce  corporate  governance  within  BT  and  to  improve  the  financial  and \ntechnical efficiency of the power utility to pave the way to further unbundling and privatization. \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,800,000  equivalent.  As  requested  by  the  Government  of \nTajikistan, ADB will provide $1,500,000 equivalent, to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nSpecial  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  Government  of  Tajikistan  will  finance \nthe remaining cost equivalent to $300,000 through in-kind contribution. The TA will finance the \nservices  of  international  consultants  for  40  person-months  and  national  consultants  for  110 \nperson-months. They will be recruited as a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants  (April  2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  using  the  quality  and  cost-based \nselection method (full-technical proposal). The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 14. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nFinancial and Economic Assessment \n\n \nA. \n \n68. \nAll the components of the Project are part of the least-cost development program. The \nProject considered transmission supply alternatives to Kabul and related areas with grid supply \nto replace small-scale isolated diesel generation (with cost as high as $0.33/kwh). The Project is \nthe  most  effective  way  to  provide  reliable  and  affordable  power  supply  in  Afghanistan.  On  an \nincremental  basis,  the  Project  will  greatly  increase  power  capacity  to  provide  relatively  cheap \nand low-cost electricity supply to households and enterprises. The rehabilitation components in \nTajikistan will increase power generation and export capacity in a cost-effective manner. \n \n69. \nThe financial analysis of the Project was conducted from the perspective of DABM and \nBT. The analysis is based on total capital costs, including physical contingencies and taxes but \nexcluding  price  contingencies  and  financing  charges.  Only  incremental  costs  and  revenues \nhave been included in cash flows. \n \n70. \nFor Afghanistan, the financial benefits of the transmission interconnection are significant, \ngiven the high level of unserved demand for electricity and the average tariff of $0.083/kWh. In \naddition,  Afghanistan  will  invest  in  two  substations  along  the  route  of  the  line,  in  Kunduz \n(population  950,000)  and  Baglan  provinces  (population  850,000).  The  substations  will  permit \nincremental  electricity  sale  to  meet  unserved  demand  in  these  towns.  However,  to  realize  the \nfull  value  of  the  substations,  additional  downstream  distribution  costs  of  $15  million  and  $10 \nmillion,  spread  over  5  years,  have  been  included  into  the  costs  of  the  Kunduz  and  Baglan \nsubstations. This cost will be borne by the  Government of  Afghanistan after completion of the \nsubstations.  In  Afghanistan,  security  concerns  increased  the  operational  costs  for  the \ntransmission line by 33%, compared with those in Tajikistan.  \n \n71. \nFor  Tajikistan,  the  financial  benefit  is  from  the  export  of  incremental  hydroelectricity \nwhich has no alternative value in summer when river flows are high. Assuming a sale price of \n$0.025/kWh at the border, it will be a win-win situation for both countries. Additional investments \ninclude upgrading and rehabilitation of four HPPs in the Vaskh River Cascade. The investments, \nwhich will result in an average incremental generation capacity of 320 GWh per year, will help \nreduce the winter electricity shortfall in Tajikistan. \n \n\n\fThe financial evaluation of the Project was undertaken in real terms using constant 2006 \n72. \nprices. The project cost estimates and the financial projections in nominal terms were converted \nto real terms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency \nfluctuations. Incremental costs and benefits were derived by evaluating the financial position of \nthe EAs, BT, and DABM, under with- and without-project scenarios. The financial internal rate of \nreturn  (FIRR),  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  is  12.4%  for  the  Afghanistan  component  and \n20.8% for the Tajikistan component. This compares favorably with the weighted average cost of \ncapital  (WACC),  also  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  of  0%  for  Afghanistan  and  3.0%  for \nTajikistan. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the FIRR is robust under adverse conditions. The \nProject is considered both financially viable and sustainable. Detailed analysis is in Appendix 9.  \n \n73. \nEconomic  analysis  was  conducted for  the  Project.  To  test the  economic  viability  of  the \nProject, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated on the basis of incremental \ncost-and-benefit  streams  associated  with  each  project.  Economic  returns  are  high  for  the \nProject. This stems from the new transmission link which enables Tajikistan to export its surplus \nhydropower  energy  to  mitigate  the  power  shortage  in  Afghanistan.  Willingness  to  pay  was \nestimated considering the current cost of diesel generation of $0.33/kWh. Financial costs were \nadjusted to reflect the true economic opportunities forgone and realized because of the Project. \nFor Tajikistan, an export price of $0.025/kWh was used as calculation base for border price. For \nTajikistan, the EIRR of the Project was 31.1%\u201415.7% for the hydropower plant component and \n40.1% for the transmission line. For Afghanistan, the EIRR of the Project was 31.0%\u201439.6% for \nthe transmission line part and 19.8% for the Kunduz/Baglan part. \n \n74. \nVarious  financial  and  economic  sensitivity  analyses  were  conducted,  including  capital \ncost  increases,  benefits  (volume  and/or  tariff)  decreases,  and  delay  in  implementation.  The \nfinancial  sensitivity  analysis  showed  some  low  returns  in  the  Afghanistan  case  but  still \nexceeding  the  WACC.  However,  the  EIRR  values  remained  well  above  the  12%  cutoff  for  all \nscenarios.  In  addition,  political  instability  and  security  will  also  affect  project  implementation. \nThis is particularly important for Afghanistan where project risks are high. Although it is difficult \nto  quantify  such  damage  to  the  Project,  political  instability  and  security  will  mostly  cause  the \nProject cost increase and implementation delay. The calculation results showed that with 30%  \ncost increase and one-year delay, the FIRR was acceptable at 7.5% and the EIRR was 19.6%, \nstill above 12%. Analysis is provided in Appendix 9 and detailed analysis is in Supplementary \nAppendix D. \n \n75. \nDistribution of economic benefits arising from the Project in Tajikistan and from savings \nof  imported  electricity  of  the  Project  in  Afghanistan  was  calculated  at  a  discount  rate  of  12%. \nThe poverty impact analysis showed that 53% of economic benefits will go to poor people living \nbelow the official poverty line in Afghanistan and 54% of economic benefits will go to the poor in \nTajikistan. \n   \nB. \n \n76. \nThis regional Project will generate additional revenues to the Tajik economy and  lower \nthe cost of power for consumers in the Afghan economy. The power trade under the Project will \nfacilitate economic growth to bring additional benefits to the region.  \n \n77. \nDistribution analysis for regional cooperation was conducted to examine the distribution \nof  the  Project\u2019s  benefits  for  the  two  countries,  using  the  same  EIRR  methodology  and \nassumptions for discount rate, price numeraire, constant price, and standard conversion factor \nadjustment. Through this Project, increased trade is an additional benefit for the region as the \nProject will promote trade in electricity and trade from other areas. The net economic benefits of \n\nRegional Benefits \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\fSocial and Poverty Impacts  \n\nregional cooperation from trade are estimated at $114.3 million at 12% of discount rate for both \ncountries. It is estimated that Tajikistan would share 47% of the benefits and Afghanistan should \nshare  53%  of  the  benefits  from  the  Project.  Therefore,  the  Project  is  a  win-win  example  of \nregional cooperation. \n \nC. \n \n78. \nLand acquisition or impacts on crops will be extremely limited\u2014both for the Afghanistan \nand the Tajikistan components of the Project\u2014and will depend only on the construction of tower \nbases  and  expansion  of  Baglan  substation.  All  other  items  constructed  under  the  Project, \nincluding temporary access roads, will have no impacts on property and livelihoods. No house \nwill  be  affected  and  no  resettlement  is  needed  in  either  country.  In  Afghanistan,  most  of  the \ntransmission  line  will  pass  over  unused  desert  land  where  impacts  will  be  greatly  limited  by \nlocating  the  towers  within  the  tower  footing  of  an  old  Soviet  line  in  disuse  or  by  using  poles \ninstead of towers. In Tajikistan, most of the transmission line will pass in unused desert land and \nimpacts will occur only where the transmission line has to cross strips of cultivated land. To plan \nthe  compensation  program,  the  EAs  have  prepared  a  short  resettlement  plan  (RP)  for  each \ncomponent.  Each  RP  fits  the  relevant  national  law/regulation  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement (1995) and Operations Manual F2 on Involuntary Resettlement. The RPs provide \nimpacts  figures,  describe  the  compensation  and  rehabilitation  framework,  and  detail  all  RP \nimplementation  mechanisms/responsibilities.  After  detailed  design  completion,  the  RP  will  be \nreviewed  and,  if  necessary,  updated  as  a  condition  for  approval  of  the  civil  works  contract. \nImplementation of the RP in accordance with ADB requirements will be a condition for the notice \nto  proceed  with  civil  works  mobilization.  The  Afghanistan  and  the  Tajikistan  RPs  are \nsummarized in Appendix 11, and are in Supplementary Appendixes G and H.  \n \n79. \nNo  project-affected  person  in  Afghanistan  or  Tajikistan  fits  the  definition  of  indigenous \nperson provided by The Bank\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). Therefore, there will be no \nimpact on indigenous peoples from either of the project components.   \n \nD. \n \nIn Afghanistan, the Project will (i) provide cheap electricity and improved summer power \n80. \nsupplies to Afghanistan, which will ensure continuous provision of electricity to local users and \nlessen the country\u2019s dependence on other much more expensive indigenous or foreign sources; \nand (ii) provide savings that will influence year-round power flows and allow greater purchasing \nability during winter. The gains obtained will directly benefit the poor as money saved in summer \nmonths  will  translate  to  lower  year-round  tariffs  for  them.  In  Tajikistan,  the  Project  will  (i) \nincrease the budget needed to improve the availability of electricity during winter by selling part \nof its summer hydropower surplus to Afghanistan; and (ii) permit improvement of the efficiency \nof  the  sources  of  indigenous  winter  power,  develop  new  generating  assets,  or  increase  the \ncountry\u2019s purchasing capacity for additional winter power imports. Greater year-round access to \nelectricity  in  Afghanistan  and  Tajikistan  will  also  indirectly  benefit  poor  and  vulnerable \nconsumers by allowing more efficient operations to hospitals, schools, and other social utilities, \nwhich are often hardest hit by inadequate power supply and quality. Improved power supplies \nwill  also  encourage  light  industrial  and  commercial  activity,  creating  employment  opportunities \nand  improving  productivity  and  the  quality  of  outputs  in  the  manufacturing  and  agriculture \nsectors.  \n \n \n \n\nPoverty and Social Assessment \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\fEnvironmental Impacts  \n\nE. \n \n81. \nThe Project is classified category \u201cB\u201d. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) for both \nthe  Tajikistan  and  Afghanistan  components  of  the  Project  were  prepared,  anticipating \ninsignificant  environmental  impacts  which  can  be  readily  mitigated  by  the  implementation  of \nstandard mitigation measures and good engineering practices in the design and construction of \ntransmission lines, access roads, canal excavation, and spoil management. Such measures are \nspecified  in  both  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs)  and  relevant  contract  documents. \nFurthermore,  any  minor  environmental  impacts  are  offset  by  the  environmental  benefits, \nespecially  the  additional  power  generation  without  extra  greenhouse  gas  emission  from  the \nProject.  Minimal  impact  is  expected  on  any  ecologically  important  area  and  the  nearest \nprotected  area,  the  Tigrovaya  Balka  Nature  Reserve,  is  at  least  11.5  km  from  the  alignment. \nThe  biophysical  resources  along  the  proposed  transmission  line  alignment  and  the  project \nfacilities are areas of low habitat value, mainly comprising sparsely vegetated semidesert areas. \nOn  the  Tajikistan  side,  there  are  numerous  existing  transmission  lines  and  towers,  and  the \nProject  will  create  negligible  additional  visual  impacts.  Little  cumulative  impacts,  including \ntransboundary  or  induced  impacts,  are  expected  mainly  because  no  new  hydropower \ngeneration  will  be  added.  Therefore,  no  modification  of  the  actual  water  flows  are  expected \nwhich might affect riparian countries. \n  \nBT is responsible for adequate implementation of the EMP for the Tajikistan component. \n82. \nIt  currently  has  an  environmental  monitoring  unit  which  received  on-the-job  training  from  the \nimplementation consultant of the Power Rehabilitation Project (footnote 6), and is considered to \nhave  the  experience  and  capacity  to  undertake  environmental  management  functions  for  the \nProject. MEW is its counterpart on the Afghan side. Since MEW currently has limited capacity, \ntraining of staff in environmental management will be necessary. This will be undertaken by an \ninternational environmental specialist during project implementation. Effective implementation of \nthe EMP will be monitored throughout each phase of the Project.   \n \nF. \n \n83. \nThe overall political and security situation remains volatile and uncertain in Afghanistan. \nSuch instability might create delays in implementation and cost overruns. A longer-term issue is \nthe  post-construction  security  of  the  transmission  line  asset,  hence  its  ability  to  indirectly \ngenerate  cash  flows  to  repay  the  loan.  An  interministerial  committee  was  set  up  in \nSeptember 2006 and will continue to provide guidance on all security matters. \n \n84. \nAdequate  coordination with  other  donors  and  agencies  will  ensure  that  all  components \nnecessary to supply Kabul will be in place when the interconnection between the two countries \nis ready. These include not only the completion of the Pul-e-Khumri to Kabul transmission line \nbut also rehabilitation of the distribution system in Kabul. \n \n85.  Weakness of the EA in both countries could lead to delays in implementation. However, \nsteps have been taken to mitigate this risk (paras. 23 and 44). \n \n86. \nLack of financial capability from the Afghan side to pay for the power imports is a risk. \nAverage tariff levels were increased by 100% in September 2006, which will help the ability of \nDABM  to  pay  for  power  imports.  It  is  envisaged  that  DABM  will  obtain  a  bank  guarantee \ncovering up to 2 months of import, which will further mitigate this risk.  \n \n\nProject Risks \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nRegular  tariff  increases  over  the  next  few  years  in  Tajikistan  are  necessary  to  ensure \n87. \nthat the EA is able to generate electricity and service the debt. The governments have recently \ntaken steps to increase tariffs and have initiated significant tariff increases. \n \nThere are potential risks of inadequate EMP implementation because MEW has limited \n88. \nenvironmental  capacity.  Training  of  MEW  staff  in  environmental  management  and  monitoring, \nwhich will be provided initially by an international environmental specialist included in the project \nimplementation  consultant\u2019s  team,  will  be  necessary  to  establish  routine  environmental \nmonitoring protocols, and undertake periodic environmental monitoring and audit of construction \nworks during construction. Risks on inadequate EMP implementation can thus be minimized.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nthe \n\nterms  of \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nTrade  Enhancement.  The  governments  will  comply  with \n\n \nA. \n \n89. \nIn addition to the standard assurances, the governments of Afghanistan and Tajikistan, \nDABM  ,  BT,  and  MEW  have  given  the  following  assurances,  which  are  incorporated  in  their \nrespective legal documents. \n \n90. \nthe \nintergovernmental  agreement  including:  (i)  minimum  take  or  pay  assurance  by  Afghanistan, \nsecurity of supply assurance by Tajikistan, (ii) long-term tariff certainty through tariff escalation \nagreement and (iii) financial guarantee for coverage of the obligations of the parties.  \n \nTariffs.  Each  of  the  governments  will  ensure  that  (i)  tariffs  are  adequately  adjusted \n91. \nduring project implementation so that BT and DABM, as appropriate, comply with the financial \ncovenants,  as  discussed  in  paras.  93  and  94  below;  (ii)  a  lifeline  tariff  structure  has  been \nreviewed in the medium term in order to provide an element of tariff subsidy to the poor; and (iii) \npublic  awareness  programs  are  undertaken  to  educate  the  public  on  the  need  for  a  rational \nelectricity tariff scheme and the importance of energy conservation. \n \n92. \nThe Government of Tajikistan will ensure that the interest margin arising from relending \nof  the  ADB  loan  and  loans  provided  by  the  co-financiers  are  used  to  fund  the  subsidy  of  the \nlifeline tariff. \n \n93. \nFinancial  Matters.  The  government  of  Afghanistan  will  take  all  necessary  measures \nincluding  tariff  adjustments  to  ensure  that  DABM  complies  with  the  following  financial \ncovenants: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe accounts receivable (a) do not exceed the equivalent aggregate amount of \n6 months of billings at the end of each quarter from 20 September 2007; and (b) \nfrom 20 March 2009 onward, are maintained at the level of the aggregate amount \nof 3 months of billing.  \nAn  operating  ratio  is  maintained  at  a  level  of  less  than  90%  from  fiscal  year \nending 20 March 2008   \n\nThe Government of Tajikistan will take necessary measures to ensure that: \n \n(i) \n\nAn  operating  ratio  is  maintained  at  a  level  of  less  than  90%  from  fiscal  year \nending 31 December 2008.  \nBT shall not incur any debt, unless its free cash flows for the twelve months prior \nto  the  date  of  such  incurrence  shall  be  at  least  1.3  times  the  estimated  debt \n\n(ii) \n\n \n94. \n\n \n\n\f \n95. \n \n\nGovernance. The governments agree that: \n\nservice requirements of BT for any succeeding year on all debt of BT, including \nthe debt to be incurred. \nBy 31 December 2008, BT establishes an escrow account at a nominated bank \nfor  accumulating  payments  received  from  electricity  sales  to  Afghanistan.  The \naccumulated  funds  shall  be  used  by  BT  exclusively  for  the  purposes  of \nrepayment  of  the  principal  and  interest  of  the  subsidiary  loan,  for  maintenance \nand rehabilitation of existing facilities and for new investments; \nBT, by 30 June 2007, stops all barter trading and takes necessary measures to \nrequire cash payments in full from all its consumers; and \nBy 31 December 2008, BT liquidates inventory levels from the current 9 months \nof  sales  as  at  June  2005  to  6  months  of  sale  revenue,  and  from  June  2008 \nonwards,  maintains  the  inventory  at  a  level  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  the \naggregate amount of 3 months of sale revenue. \nThe accounts receivable (a) do not  exceed the equivalent aggregate amount of \n6 months of billings at the end of each quarter from 31 December 2008; and (b) \nfrom  31  December  2009  onward,  are  maintained  at  the  level  of  the  aggregate \namount of 3 months of billing.  \n\nNo  material  changes  (either  financial,  structural,  or  operational)  to,  nor  major \nasset  transfer  to  and  from,  the  EA  and/or  IA,  as  appropriate,  are  formally \napproved or implemented during the term of the loan without prior ADB approval \nif  such  changes  would  or  would  likely  affect  the  ability  of  the  EA  and/or  IA,  as \nappropriate,  to  perform  its  obligations  under  the  Project  Agreement  and/or \nSubsidiary Loan Agreements, as appropriate. \nThe  EA  will  provide  adequate  funds  to  carry  out  independent  audits  that  are \nacceptable to ADB, for the project and corporate accounts. \nAll payments of the electricity exports from Tajikistan to Afghanistan are done to \na transit account established in the name of BT at a nominated bank.

Afghanistan  is  well  endowed  with  hydropower,  natural \ngas,  and  coal.  Some  estimates  put  hydropower  potential  at  25,000  megawatt  (MW),  of  which \n5,000 MW are inside Afghanistan and the rest on the border of Amu Darya. Hydropower is the \nkey source (about 75% of total) of power supply in Afghanistan. The main dams are Kajakai in \nHelmand  Province  near  Kandahar,  Mahipar,  and  Breshna-Kot  in  Nangarhar  Province  near \nJalalabad; and Dahla in Kandahar Province. Kabul is fed by three hydroelectric power stations, \nwith a combined output of 80 MW (nameplate rating of 188 MW). \n \n2. \nTotal  generation  capacity  has  declined  from  about  456  MW  in  the  1990s  to  about \n250 MW  in  2006.  Only  about  6\u20139%  of  the  population  has  access  to  power,  of  which \napproximately  30%  is  in  Kabul.  The  other  provinces  have  even  less  access,  with  rural  areas \nbeing virtually unserved. Before the conflict in 1980, power transmission lines comprised about \n140 circuit-kilometers (km) of 220 kilovolt (kV) transmission lines and about 1,080 circuit-km of \n110 kV transmission lines. Many were destroyed during the war and only some 110 kV lines are \nnow operating. The damaged 220 kV lines have been downgraded to operate at 110 kV while \nsome damaged 110 kV lines now operate at 35 kV. \n \n\n2. \n\nDemand Scenarios \n\n \n3. \nEnergy  demand  forecasts  have  been  made  by  ongoing  studies  on  the  power  sector \nmaster  plan  (up  to  2020)  and  the  gas  development  master  plan  (up  to  2025).  The  power \ndemand forecast is based on adjusted actual energy sales of 2002. Adjusted demand includes \nsuppressed demand, which is around 75% of the energy supplied. In the basic forecast, energy \ndemand  is  assumed  to  reach  3,861  gigawatt-hour  (GWh)  in  2020,  giving  an  average  annual \ngrowth  rate  of  6.3%.  In  the  high  forecast,  energy  demand  is  assumed  to  reach  5,640  GWh  in \n2020, or 46% higher than the basic forecast, implying an average growth rate of 8.2%. \n \n4. \nThe  present  peak  load  is  assumed  at  around  215  MW  for  all  of  Afghanistan.  Adding  a \nsuppressed  demand  assumed  to  be  138  MW,  the  peak  load  starting  point  for  the  forecasts  is \n363 MW. In the basic forecast, the peak load is assumed to increase to 911 MW in 2020. This \ngives an average annual growth rate of 5.2%. The growth rate for the peak load is somewhat \nlower  than  the  growth  rate  for  energy  demand  since  the  load  factor  is  assumed  to  increase \nduring  the  forecast  period.  In  the  high  forecast,  the  peak  load  is  assumed  to  increase  to \n1,316 MW in 2020. This gives an average annual growth rate of 7.4%. \n \n\n3. \n\nSupply Options \n\n \nBusiness  as  Usual.  Business  as  usual  assumes  that  the  existing  practices  of  energy \n5. \ndevelopment will continue without any changes in strategy. Development of known hydropower, \nnatural gas, oil, and coal reserves will continue; indigenous hydropower, natural gas, and coal \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005.

Additional \n\nwill  be  used  for  power  generation;  no  program  on  energy  conservation  will  be  initiated;  and \ndevelopment  and  management  of  biomass  fuels  will  continue  without  any  linkages  with \ncommercial energy development program. The gap between projected demand and indigenous \nsupply can only be reduced with a serious exploration program; otherwise, the gap will have to \nbe met from imported sources. \n \n6. \nreference  option  are \n(i) enhancement  of  exploration,  appraisal,  and  extraction  of  indigenous  nonrenewable  energy \nresources; (ii) implementation of effective programs to conserve energy; and (iii) integration of \ncommercial  energy  and  biomass  fuels  program  to  maintain  a  sustainable  supply  of  biomass \nfuels.  Exploration  and  appraisal  of  oil  and  natural  gas  will  be  enhanced;  development  of \nhydropower,  natural  gas,  and  coal  will  continue;  new  and  renewable  energy  sources  will  be \nharnessed;  a  program  will  be  undertaken  to  conserve  commercial  energy  and  biomass  fuels; \nand development of biomass fuels will be considered along with the development of commercial \nenergy sources. \n \nA business-as-usual scenario would put a strain on the economy with a sharp increase \n7. \nin  energy  demand.  It  would  require  additional  fuel  because  of  a  lack  of  energy  conservation \nmeasures,  and  may  cause  severe  environmental  degradation  caused  by  overexploitation  of \nbiomass fuels. The analysis used the reference option. \n \n8. \nThe  Government\u2019s  power  sector  master  plan  estimates  over  $1.5  billion  for  the \nrecommended  generation  and  transmission  development  plan  up  to  2020  whereas  the  World \nBank estimates a requirement of about $1.9 billion on generation and transmission alone for the \nnext 7 years. Distribution will require another $800 million, according to the master plan. \n \n\n4. \n\nSector Road Map and Sustainability \n\n \nThe Government has developed a detailed road map for the power sector (Table A2.1). \n9. \nIn  the  preparatory  phase,  focus  will  be  on  capacity  building,  improvement  of  billing  and \ncollection, theft control, and development of a master plan. To date, the Government has met its \ntargets. In the medium term (2005\u20132007), the focus will be on developing a power sector law, \nestablishing  independent  regulation,  separating  generation  from  distribution,  commercializing \nKabul  Distribution  Company,  and  finalizing  key  transmission  infrastructure.  The  longer-term \ntarget  is  the  establishment  of  a  national  transmission  grid  and  increased  access  to  75%  for \nhouseholds. \n \n10. \nThe power sector\u2019s ability to provide sustainable economic and social benefits will need \nreliable infrastructure (investment in power generation, transmission, and distribution); capable \ninstitutions; and appropriate cost recovery. While investment in infrastructure is not an essential \nprecondition for sustainability in other countries, the power sector of Afghanistan will not be able \nto deliver basic services to existing consumers without investment. Table A4.2 summarizes the \ninitiative by the Government and other donors to ensure the overall sustainability of the power \nsector. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nTABLE A2.1: AFGHANISTAN POWER SECTOR ROAD MAP \n\n \nPhase \nActivities \nLegislation \n \n\nRegulator \n \n\nUtility \nOperation \n \n\nPhysical \nInfrastructure \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPreparatory Phase \n2003\u20132004 \n\u2022  New constitution enacted \n\u2022  National economic legislation completed \n\u2022  MWP policy framework approved \n\u2022  Power sector law prepared \n \n\u2022  Capacity building in MWP on regulation \n\nfunctions \n\n\u2022  MWP continues to adjust tariffs in Kabul to \n\ncost-recovering levels \n\n\u2022  Study on future industry structure completed \n\u2022  Basic commercialization activities \n\nundertaken \n\n\u2022  Billing and collection \n\u2022  Accounting systems \n\u2022  Cost of service analysis \n\u2022  Metering and connections \n\u2022  Theft control \n\u2022  New connections \n \n\u2022  Master plan for power sector completed \n\u2022  Reconstruction projects are completed \n\n(ADB, German development cooperation \nthrough KfW, World Bank) \n\n\u2022  Study/plan for Kabul and major provincial \ncities distribution network completed \n\n\u2022  Key feasibility studies initiated \n\u2022 \n\nImplementation of urgent priority projects \naccording to master plan initiated \n\u2022  Study on options to expand rural access \n \n\nIntermediate Phase \n2005\u20132007 \n\nLong-Term Phase \n2008\u20132010 \n\n\u2022  Power sector law enacted \n\u2022  Law and regulations \n\ncompleted and implemented \n\nResults \n \n\u2022  Comprehensive power \nsector regulation is \nfunctional \n\n\u2022 \n\nIndependent regulatory agency \ncreated \n\n\u2022 \n\nIndependent regulatory \nagency fully operational \n\n\u2022  The regulatory agency is \noperating independently \n\n\u2022  Separate generation and \ndistribution companies \nestablished according to the \npolicy framework \n\u2022  KDC created and a \n\nmanagement contract awarded \n\n\u2022  Generation and \n\n\u2022  Distribution and \n\ndistribution companies \nready for deeper private \nsector participation \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ngeneration companies \nprovide efficient and \nreliable power with \nprivate sector \nparticipation \n\n\u2022  The Government has a \nsubsidiary role in the \nsector \n\n\u2022  40% access is achieved \n(from 4\u20136% today) \n\u2022  Overall system losses \nare reduced from 40\u2013\n50% to  20\u201330% \n\n\u2022  Hairitan\u2013Kabul transmission \n\n\u2022  KDC connected 200,000 \n\n\u2022 \n\nline constructed \nIDA and soft loans finance new \nprojects in KDC (200,000 new \ncustomers connected) \n\u2022  MEW constructs new \n\ndistribution projects around the \ncountry (200,000 new \ncustomers connected) \n\nnew customers \n\n\u2022  New generation installed \n\nin the order of 200 MW \n\u2022  Electricity reaches 75% of \n\nall districts \n\n\u2022  Backbone of national \ntransmission grid \nconstructed \n\n\u2022  Master plan priority generation \nand transmission projects \ninitiated \n\n \n\n\u2022  Rural electrification program \n\nimplemented \nADB = Asian Development Bank, KDC = Kabul Distribution Company, KfW= Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, MEW = Ministry of Energy and Water, MW = megawatt, \nMWP = Ministry of Water and Power.  \nSource: World Bank 2004, Report No. T762-AFG, Appendix 2.\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n2\n \n\n2\n9\n\n \n\n\f \n\n   \n\n \nDrivers \n\n1.

Experts estimate that less than \n10% of its 40,000 megawatt (MW) potential is currently utilized. Nurek\u2014the largest hydropower \nplant, with capacity of 3,000 MW\u2014has insufficient storage, so it spills water every summer but \ncannot supply a winter deficit of about 1,800 gigawatt-hour (GWh). \n \n12. \nIn  winter,  hydropower  generation  depends  on  storage  of  water  in  reservoirs.  When \nstorage level depletes, the country has to rely on imported oil, gas, and coal to meet its energy \nrequirements. Tajikistan imports electricity from Uzbekistan from January until April every year, \ndespite self-sufficiency in installed generation capacity. \n \n13. \nAt the policy and regulatory level, the Fuel and Energy Department in the Office of the \nPresident  has  overall  responsibility  for  the  energy  sector.  The  Ministry  of  Energy  (MOE), \nestablished  in  October  2000,  is  responsible  for  implementation  of  the  Government  energy\u2019s \npolicy.  The  Agency  on  Anti  Monopoly  Policy  and  Entrepreneurship  acts  according  to  the \nprovisions  of  the  Law  on  Natural  Monopolies  and  regulates  the  tariffs  on  electricity,  gas,  and \ndistrict heat. It reports directly to the Office of the President. A separate regulatory body for the \nsector does not exist. \n \n14. \nAt the operating level, the power sector is the responsibility of the joint stock company \nBarki  Tajik1 (BT),  a  vertically  integrated  company  in  charge  of  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution of electricity and heat2 for the whole country\u2014except the Gorno Badakshan region \nwhere  a  25-year  concession  period  was  given  to  a  private  company,  Pamir  Energy,  in  2002. \nUnder  the  present  institutional  arrangement,  BT  consists  of  a  network  of  10  subsidiary  power \ngeneration companies, 11 subsidiary distribution companies, and 8 supporting companies (such \nas a research institute and a construction company). It serves a customer base of 969,754 and \nemployed 9,772 staff in 2005. BT reports to MOE. \n\n \nBT\u2019s  transmission  network  consists  of  three  separate  grids:  (i)  one  in  the  north  in \n15. \n220 kilovolt (kV) connecting the sole hydropower plant (Kairaikum hydropower plant\u2014240 MW); \n(ii) the central grid with an installed generation capacity of 3,895 MW; and (iii) one in the west in \nthe Gorno Badakshan region. \n \n16. \nAs in many former Soviet republics, 100% of the population has access to the electricity \ngrid, and BT\u2014despite scarce resources and investment since the fall of the Soviet Union\u2014has \nmaintained supply to all connected customers.  \n \n17. \nThe  operational  and  financial  performance  of  BT  has  improved  over  the  last  5  years. \nHowever, technical and nontechnical losses in the transmission and distribution systems are still \nhigh (estimated to be around 20% technical and 20% nontechnical).  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  BT became a joint stock company by Decree No. 272 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Tajikistan of 24 July 1992.  \n2   BT  is  responsible  for  heat  supply  to  Dushanbe  and  Khujand  only.  The  heat  and  power  combined  plant  in  Yavan \n\nhas not been in operation since 1997.  \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Policy and Sector Reforms \n\na. \n\nGovernment Policy \n\n \nThe  Government  has  approved  a  strategic  plan  to  improve  the  overall  situation  in  the \n18. \nelectricity sector, as part of a general plan to rationalize the availability and utilization of energy \nin Tajikistan, including gas and heating. \n \n\n19. \n\nIt is taking a two-track approach to energy sector development: \n\nThe  first  track  focuses  on  the  domestic  energy  sector,  taking  a  sector-wide \napproach by covering the electricity, gas, and heating sectors. The main aim of \nthis  track  is  the  recovery  of  the  domestic  energy  sector,  for  which  purpose  the \nGovernment is intending to take a series of policy and investment measures.  \nThe second track of the development strategy is oriented toward export markets. \nThis  strategy  calls  for  realizing  the  sector\u2019s  significant  potential  to  contribute  to \nmeeting  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth  through  electricity  exports.  At  present, \nthere are electricity surpluses in the summer which are already being exported to \nneighboring  Afghanistan,  Kazakhstan,  Uzbekistan,  and  Russia.  It  is  intended  to \nintensify  these  exports  and  secure  more  long-term  contracts  for  existing \nsurpluses.  \n\n \nA number of policy measures are also being considered by the Government to support \n\n20. \nthe implementation of its strategy for the energy sector. These include the following. \n \n\nRevised  energy  pricing  policy. In the power sector, despite tariff increases in \nthe  past  few  years,  the  current  tariffs  are  quite  low  compared  with  the  financial \nviability  level  of  $0.021/kWh  in  constant  terms.  The  Government  is  proposing  a \ngradual  yearly  increase  of  tariffs  from  1  January  2007  to  bring  them  to  cost \nrecovery by the end of 2010. The Government will also take measures for large \nconsumers,  including  Tursunzade  Aluminum  Smelter  (TADAZ),  to  pay  their \narrears  for  electric  power  consumed  and  to  make  advance  payments  for \nelectricity in the future.  \nLoss  reduction  and  improved  revenue  collection  program. A loss reduction \nprogram sponsored by the World Bank is under implementation for the electricity \nand  gas  sectors,  which  will  initially  focus  on  reducing  commercial  losses  and \nimproving  collections.  Metering  devices  will  be  replaced  and  modern  billing \nsystems will be introduced. \nEnergy  efficiency  program.  A  program  will  be  implemented  which  comprises \nenergy demand side management and efficiency enhancement. On demand side \nmanagement,  within  the  expected  TADAZ  concession  contract  between  the \nGovernment and the joint stock company Russian Aluminum, efforts will be made \nto  shift  the  bulk  of  TADAZ  production  from  winter  to  summer  to  facilitate \nelimination of winter electricity deficits. \nIncreasing  energy  supply.  Options  for  increasing  energy  supply,  particularly \nduring the winter months, are being investigated. These include rehabilitation and \nmodernization  of  Nurek  HPP,  Kairakum  HPP,  Golovnaya  HPP,  and  cascade  of \nVarzob HPPs, which will allow the installed generating capacity to be increased \nby 500\u2013550 MW.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n33 \n\n \n\nb. \n\nSector Reforms   \n\n \n \n \n21. \nThe  Government  set  up  a  high-level  working  group,  headed  by  the  energy  minister,  to \nlead restructuring via a presidential decree dated 3 June 2003. On 9 December 2004, MOE set \nup a commission to draw up a plan for restructuring of BT in accordance with instructions issued \nby the Government. The commission\u2019s report3 was submitted for review to the Government on \n14 July 2005. The report envisages a cautious approach to restructuring, with unbundling taking \nplace in a number of stages within a conservative time frame.  \n \n22. \n\nThe commission report recommends the following to be achieved by 2008: \n \n(i) \n\nCreation of a single company that will own and operate the installed generation \ncapacity and transmission lines above 110 kV. \nEstablishment  of  three  distribution companies:  one  for  Sogd  region;  one  for  the \ncentral  region,  including  the  city  of  Dushanbe  and  its  regions;  and  one  for  the \nKhatlon region. \n\n(ii) \n\n \n23. \nDuring the second phase of the reforms from 2008 to 2012, the Commission proposes to \nseparate the generation and the transmission lines above 110 kV into two separate companies. \n \n\nc. \n\nTariffs and Revenue Collection \n\nThe  tariff  system  is  intended  to  be  cost-based  and  is  inherited  from  the  Soviet  time. \n24. \nTariffs are calculated based on expenses divided by the total electricity transmitted and a profit \nelement that is currently set at 15%.  \n \nBT has made a number of efforts to improve revenue collection, including reducing the \n25. \ncategory of consumers from seven (industrial, agricultural, pumps and pumps stations for water \nsupply,  nonindustrial,  communal  utilities  enterprises,  city  electric  transport,  and  residential)  to \nthree (industrial, budget, and residential).  \n \n26. \nThe  Government  has  increased  electricity  tariffs  to  improve  cost  recovery  since  2000, \nbut in a moderate way. From January 2007 onward, the Government has committed to make a \nsubstantial increase with the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank. \n \n27. \nSince the enforcement of a disconnection policy, collection rates have improved over the \nlast  few  years.  TADAZ  recently  paid  some  long  outstanding  debts  and  has  commitments  to \nclear past debts.  \n \n\n3. \n\nSector Focus   \n\nAs  defined  in  the  country  strategy  and  program  update,4 ADB  strategy  is  driven  by  the \n28. \nthree  sector  goals:  (i)  utilizing  the  hydropower  export  potential;  (ii)  improving  efficiency;  and \n(iii) achieving financial sustainability, which will promote new investments in the sector. \n\n                                                 \n3 Commission\u2019s  Report.

Project  facilitates  a  higher  volume  of  electricity  trade  between  Afghanistan  and \n1. \nTajikistan. Afghanistan has one of the lowest per capita energy consumptions in the world, and \nis badly in need of more electricity supply. Tajikistan has surplus electricity during the summer \nmonths  when  there  is  excess  hydroelectric  capacity  because  of  high  river  flows.  Incremental \nelectricity is produced at minimal cost in Tajikistan and will be exported to Afghanistan at a likely \ntariff  of  $0.025  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh),  while  Afghanistan\u2019s  marginal  cost  of  electricity \ngenerated through diesel firing can be as high as $0.330/kWh. The Project will offer a win-win \nsituation for both countries. \n \n2. \nAll  the  components  are  part  of  the  least-cost  expansion  program  developed  under  the \npower  system  master  plan.  The  plan  considers  transmission  supply  alternatives  to  Kabul  and \nrelated areas with grid supply and replaces large-scale isolated diesel generation. The Project is \nthe  least-cost  option  for  developing  a  transmission  line  from  Afghanistan  to  Tajikistan.  On  an \nincremental  basis,  the  Project  will  greatly  increase  power  capacity  to  provide  relatively  cheap \nand low-cost electricity supply to households and enterprises. Currently, diesel generation costs \n$0.33/kWh. The Project can supply power with an estimated average cost of imported electricity \nof $0.025/kWh at the border. \n \nB.  \n \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n1.  \n\nProject Viability Analysis \n\n3. \nThe project viability analysis was undertaken on a conservative basis, assuming that the \nexpensive  diesel-fired  plant  in  Kabul,  which  provides  a  significant  incentive  for  importation  by \nAfghanistan,  only  runs  at  50%  capacity.  While  transmission  lines  have  a  serviceable  life  of \n40 years, a project life of only 20 years has been used.  \n \n\n2.  \n\nAfghanistan and Tajikistan Transmission Lines \n\n \n4. \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  has  been  computed  for  the  project \ncomponents from the perspective of the power utilities in each country based on the following \nkey assumptions. \n \n5. \nThe  benefit  accruing  to  Tajikistan  from  the  transmission  interconnection  line  is  mainly \nthrough  the  sale  of  incremental  electricity,  assumed  at  $0.025/kWh,  which  is  in  excess  of \nTajikistan\u2019s needs during the summer season and hence has no alternative value. The benefit \naccruing  to  Afghanistan  is  that  the  import  displaces  generation  from  Kabul\u2019s  high  cost  diesel-\nfired  power  generation  plant  with  an  incremental  cost  of  $0.330/kWh  and  imports  from \nUzbekistan at $0.030/kWh. The additional import from Tajikistan also helps to meet some of the \nunserved  energy  in  Kabul,  which  has  a  rapidly  growing  population  currently  estimated  at \n4 million.  \n \n6. \nOther  project  components  include:  (i)  in  Tajikistan,  several  subprojects  whose  benefits \naccrue  from  the  prevention  of  major  plant  shutdown  and  plant  capacity  and  efficiency \nimprovements;  and  (ii)  in  Afghanistan,  construction  of  two  new  substations  in  Kunduz \n(population 950,000) and Baglan (population 850,000) that will meet unserved and incremental \ndemand.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n47 \n\n \n7. \nThe financial analysis shows that the FIRR of the transmission project and the individual \nsubprojects  all  exceed  their  respective  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  for  both \ncountries.  The  Project  is  attractive  to  both  Afghanistan  (FIRR  12.4%)  and  Tajikistan  (FIRR \n20.8%),  and  well  exceeds  the  Project\u2019s  WACC  for  both countries  of  0%  and  3%,  respectively. \nThe analysis, including key assumptions and sensitivity analyses, is summarized in Tables A9.1 \nto A9.4. \n \nC.  \n \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n1.  \n\nAssumptions for Economic Cost of Project Components \n\n \nTo  convert  financial  project  cost  into  economic  cost,  turnover  and  income  taxes  were \n8. \ndeducted,  and  capital  costs  remained  with  no  contingencies  in  the  base  capital  cost.  Annual \noperation  and  maintenance  and  administration  costs  were  calculated  in  economic  prices \n(financial prices adjusted using the standard conversion factor). The cost of supply was valued \nbased on the long-run marginal cost for generation and transmission as calculated in the power \nsector  master  plan.  Consistent  with  the  financial  analysis,  20  years  is  used  for  the  project \neconomic analysis. Investment is assumed to take place during 2007\u20132009 and project benefits \nare assumed to be realized from 2009.  \n \n\n2.  \n\nQuantification of Benefits \n\n \n9. \nThe main benefits for Tajikistan are from (i) the transmission line from Tajikistan for the \nlong-term  reliable  electricity  to  Afghanistan  for  summer  season,  (ii)  rehabilitation  of  existing \nsubstations,  and  (iii)  provision  of  some  metering.  Incremental  benefits  were  calculated  from \nincreased outputs and exports to Afghanistan. \n \nFor Afghanistan, main benefits included (i) increased availability and capacity of power \n10. \nsupply for Kabul and Kunduz from the transmission line from Tajikistan, (ii) connection of related \nnorthern  areas  of  Afghanistan,  (iii)  rehabilitation  of  Kunduz  and  Baglan  substations,  and  (iv) \nreplacement of electricity from diesel sources and loss reduction. The incremental benefits were \ncalculated  as  savings  from  diesel  generation,  savings  from  Uzbekistan  imports  ($0.03/kWh), \nand  incremental  sales.  Incremental  benefits  were  calculated  using  customers\u2019  willingness  to \npay. \n \nThe  total  demand  in  Kabul  is  estimated  at  300  megawatt  (MW),  and  the  demand  on \n11. \nelectricity will continue to grow with economic growth. The Project can provide reliable electricity \nto the areas where the transmission line will pass. This will greatly benefit local people with no \naccess  to  electricity,  and  privately  operated  generators  based  on  diesel  or  petrol-powered \ngeneration  for  electricity.  Thus,  the  transmission  line  will  benefit  the  whole  economy, \nresidences,  the  Government,  and  enterprises  with  cheap  electricity.  The  economic  benefits  of \nextending  supply  to  Kunduz  and  Baglan  areas  are  estimated  based  on  the  cost  of  alternative \nenergy  sources  used  for  existing  consumption  levels,  and  based  on  the  willingness  to  pay  for \ninduced consumption because of the availability of reliable grid supply.  \n \n12. \nEconomic analysis revealed that electricity savings in Afghanistan or equivalent savings \nin  other  forms  of  energy  is  approximately  $0.33/kWh.  The  analysis  covered  the  benefits  from \nincreased  electricity  supply  that  would  attract  investment  in  the  country  and,  consequently  an \neconomic subsidy to household consumers (below 300 kWh/ for 2 months) and partial subsidies \n(below 700 kwh/ for 2 months) will be covered by the Government\u2019s budget. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n3.  \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n \n13. \nTo test the economic viability of the Project, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \nwas  calculated  on  the  basis  of  incremental  cost-and-benefit  streams  associated  with  each \nproject.  The  economic  analysis  evaluated  the  economic  performance  of  the  proposed \ncomponents  by  comparing  the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios,  i.e.,  the  economic  value  of \nthe incremental supply of electricity that the components will provide compared with the existing \npatterns of energy use in non-electrified areas. \n \n14. \nEconomic  returns  are  acceptable  for  the  Project  and  robust  for  most.  This  stems  from \nincreased  transmission  capacity  to  bring  reliable  power  in  Tajikistan  to  mitigate  the  power \nshortage  in  Afghanistan.  On  average,  the  Project  will  bring  reliable  and  cheap  power  to \nAfghanistan. Considering the current cost of diesel generation of $0.33/kWh, willingness to pay \nwas estimated to be high even with the tariff increase. The viability of the Project was analyzed \nfrom a broader national perspective in terms of the EIRR. The financial costs were adjusted to \nreflect  the  true  economic  opportunities  forgone  and  realized  on  account  of  the  Project.  The \neconomic analysis was based on the following additional assumptions: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nA  standard  conversion  factor  of  non-tradable  goods  of  0.9  is  used  for  both \nTajikistan and Afghanistan. \nBased  on  willingness  to  pay  for  the  transmission  line,  savings  for  NW  Kabul \ndiesel generation was calculated at border price of $0.0325/kWh; and at border \nprice of $0.030/kWh for the rest of analysis. \nThe shadow exchange rate is 1.10 for Afghanistan and 1.11 for Tajikistan. \n\n \n15. \nFor  Tajikistan,  the  EIRR  of  the  Project  was  31.1%.  The  EIRR  was  15.7%  for  the \nhydropower plant component and 40.1% for the transmission line. For Afghanistan, the EIRR of \nthe  Project  was  calculated  at  31.0%,  with  the  transmission  line  part  of  39.6%  and \nKunduz/Baglan part of 19.8%. \n \n16. \nThe  distribution  of  economic  benefits  arising  from  the  Project  in  Tajikistan  and  from \nsavings of imported electricity of the Project in Afghanistan was calculated at a discount rate of \n12%. The poverty impact analysis showed that 53% of economic benefits will go to poor people \nliving below the official poverty line in Afghanistan and 54% of economic benefit will go to the \npoor in Tajikistan.    \n \n\n4.  \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n \n17. \nVarious financial and economic sensitivity of the project performance to changes in key \nvariables  was  tested.  The  FIRR  and  EIRR  values  remained  robust  for  all  scenarios.  This  is \nparticularly  important  for  Afghanistan  where  risks  of  the  Project  seem  high.  The  sensitivity \nanalysis reveals that a 1-year delay will bring the FIRR down to 10.6%, from the base case of \n12.4%, and lower the EIRR to 24.5% from a base case of 31.0%. This implies that the delay in \nimplementation  will  incur  economic  costs.  In  addition,  political  instability  and  security  will  also \naffect  project  implementation.  This is  particularly  important  for  Afghanistan  where  project  risks \nare  high.  Although  it  is  difficult  to  quantify  such  damage  to  the  Project,  political  instability  and \nsecurity will mostly cause the Project cost increase and implementation delay. The calculation \nresults  showed  that  with  30%  of  capital  cost  increase  and  a  1-year  delay,  the  FIRR  was \nacceptable at 7.5% and the EIRR was 19.6%, still above 12%. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n49 \n\n5.  \n\nRegional Cooperation Benefits \n\n \n18. \nDistribution analysis for regional cooperation was conducted to examine the distribution \nof the Project\u2019s benefits for the two countries in the region, using the same EIRR methodology \nand  assumptions  for  discount  rate,  price  numeraire,  constant  price,  and  standard  conversion \nfactor adjustment. This Project offers the additional regional benefit of increased trade, as it will \npromote trade in electricity and encourage trade from other areas. The net economic benefits of \nregional cooperation from trade are estimated at $114.3 million at 12% of discount rate for both \ncountries.  Tajikistan  should  share  47%  of  benefits  and  Afghanistan  should  share  53%  of \nbenefits from the Project. This is a typical win-win case of regional cooperation. \n\n \nTable A9.1: AFG: Financial Internal Rate of Return \n($ million) \n\nNPV  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015

The Project\u2014\nto be implemented with the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) as executing agency (EA) and \nthe Afghanistan Electricity Authority (DABM) as implementing agency (IA)\u2014will require minimal \nland  acquisition  and  no  resettlement.  Most  of  the  transmission  line  (81%)  will  cross  unused \ndesert  land;  in  the  remaining  tracts,  towers  will  be  set  on  an  unused  transmission  line  tower \nbases or poles will be used. The Kunduz station improvement will not  require land acquisition \nwhile  the  Baghlan  station  expansion  will  require  only  300  square  meters  (m2).  A  total  of  61 \nfamilies will be affected by the Project (768 individuals). All of them will have some crop affected \nand  16  will  permanently  lose  some  land  (364  m2  in  total).  No  affected  family  will  be  severely \naffected1 or will need rehabilitation.  \n \nTo  plan  the  compensation  program  for  these  impacts,  the  EA  has  prepared  a  short \n2. \nresettlement  plan  (RP) 2  in  accordance  with  Afghanistan \nInvoluntary \nResettlement (1995) and Operations Manual F2 on Involuntary Resettlement. The RP provides \nimpacts  figures,  describes  the  compensation/rehabilitation  framework,  and  details  all  RP \nimplementation  mechanisms/responsibilities.  After  detailed  design  completion,  the  RP  will  be \nreviewed and, if necessary, updated as a condition for approval of the civil works contract. RP \nimplementation  in  accordance  with  ADB  requirements  will  be  a  condition  for  civil  works \nmobilization.  \n \n\nlaw  and  ADB\u2019s \n\n2. \n\nCompensation and Rehabilitation Framework  \n\n \n3. \nThe  basic  compensation/rehabilitation  principles  are  as  follows:  (i)  land  acquisition  will \nbe  avoided  or  at  least  minimized;  (ii)  compensation  will  ensure  the  maintenance  of  the  pre-\nproject  living  standards  of  affected  persons  (APs);  (iii)  APs  will  be  fully  informed/consulted  on \ncompensation  options;  (iv)  AP  sociocultural  institutions  will  be  supported/used;  (v)  land \nacquisition provisions will apply equally to women and men; (vi) lack of formal title will not be a \nbar  to  compensation/rehabilitation;  (vii)  particular  attention  will  be  paid  to  women-headed \nhouseholds and vulnerable groups; (viii) land acquisition will be conceived and executed as an \nintegral  part  of  the  Project  and  land  acquisition  budgets  will  be  included  in  project  costs;  and \n(ix) compensation will be fully provided prior to ground leveling and demolition.  \n \n4. \n(Table 11.1). \n \n\nThe RP also sets the eligibility/entitlement provisions for impacts caused by the Project \n\n                                                 \n1  Impacts are considered severe if more than 200 affected persons (APs) have to be resettled or suffer more than \n10% income losses. If so, a full resettlement plan (RP) must be prepared. Losses are not severe if less than 200 \nAPs are to  be  resettled  or suffer >10% income losses. If so, only  a short RP must be prepared. Based on  ADB. \nOperations Manual Section F2/OP & BP (2003). \n\n2  Based on the benchmarks for impact significance (footnote 1), and given the number of APs and type of impacts \n\nthey suffer, this Project will not cause severe losses so only a short RP was prepared.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nTable A11.1: Entitlements Matrix (Afghanistan) \n\nAsset \nPermanent Land \nAcquisition  \n\nSpecification \n\nNewly acquired land  \n \n \n \n\nAffected Persons \nHolders of titles, land-use \ncertificate, customary rights, \nsquatters \n\nLand acquired before \n(old tower base, \nleases) \n \n\nSame \n\nSame \n\nTemporary Land \nOccupation  \n\nCrops \n\nCrops affected \n\nAll affected persons \nincluding holders of land use \ncertificate, customary rights \nholders, tenants, and \nsquatters \n\n \n\nCommunal  \nAssets \nOther entitlements (in case  applicable after RP review) \nHouses/ \nStructures \n\nAll house structures \n\nOwners \n\n \n\nTrees \n\nAll trees under the line  Owners \n\nCompensation Entitlements \n\nCash replacement  free of taxes, registration, \nand transfer costs\u2014except for squatters who \nare given rehabilitation in the form of \ncompensation for one additional crop \n \n\nNo compensation for land; only for crops \n\nRent/plot rehabilitation equal to one tenth of land\nvalue.  \nTenants to share the lump sum with land use \ncertificate holders in accordance with their \ncontract \nOne crop compensation in cash at full market \nrate for one harvest by default for impacts \ncaused by tower/poles bases plus crop \ncompensation for crop damages occurring \nduring construction (on a default area of 50 m2). \nTenants use rights holders will share \ncompensation based on their contract. \nRehabilitation/substitution of the affected \nstructures \n\nReplacement rate compensation based on new \nmaterials, labor, and transport cost, free from \ndepreciation, transaction costs salvaged \nmaterials for whole affected item/section of it. \nFruit trees compensated in cash based on net \nmarket income of one harvest for the number of \nyears needed to regrow the tree at the same \nproductive level of tree lost.

In view of the minimal and geographically circumscribed \nimpacts caused by the Project, the RP organization will be very simple. MEW will have overall \nresponsibility for RP preparation, implementation, and financing and will exercise its functions at \nlocal level through DABM offices. A project implementation unit (PIU) under MEW is tasked with \ngeneral project execution tasks. At the PIUs, RP tasks will be handled by an RP team which will \nkeep  close  communication  with  affected  families,  local  DABM  offices,  and  local  governments. \nThe  RP  officer  will  be closely  assisted  by  the  resettlement team  of  the  project  implementation \nconsultants  which  will  plan  and  execute  all  post-detailed  design  surveys  and,  if  necessary, \nupdate  the  RP.  The  consultants  will  also  assist  the  RP  officer  in  organizing  and  implementing \nthe delivery of compensation/rehabilitation provisions. \n  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n57 \n\nDisclosure/Public  Consultation.  The  RP  has  been  prepared  based  on  repeated \n6. \nconsultation  with  the  affected  families.  As  an  appraisal  condition,  The  RP  in  English  will  be \ndisclosed on the ADB website while the RP in Dari will be disclosed in the APs\u2019 communities. \n \nGrievance  Procedures.  APs  will  first  lodge  a  complaint  with  local  MEW  offices  in \n7. \nKunduz or Pul-e-Khumri. If no settlement is reached within 14 days, the complaint will be lodged \nto  the  PIU.  If  the  grievance  remains  unsettled,  APs  may  then  seek  redress  at  the  appropriate \ncourt.    \n \n\nMonitoring. The PIUs will internally monitor and report to the EA on land acquisition and \n\n8.   \nresettlement (LAR) implementation. The EA will report to ADB quarterly.  \n \n9. \nprogram for the Project is $6,286, including 15% contingency. \n \n\n4. \n\nIndigenous Peoples Issues    \n\nFinances  and  Schedules. As indicated in the RP, the compensation and rehabilitation \n\n \n10. \nThe Project will not affect people that may be classified as indigenous under The Bank\u2019s \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). Although affected families may belong to different ethnic \ngroups, essentially Pashtun or Tajik, all of them fully participate in local political and economic \nlife in project areas, and are involved on equal terms in mainstream Afghan culture and society \nwhich is multiethnic.  \n \nB. \n \n\nTajikistan \n\n1. \n\nBackground \n\n \n\n \n11. \nThe  Government  of  Tajikistan  has  requested  $21.5  million  from  ADB  to  undertake  the \nTajikistan leg of the Project, connecting Sangtuda Hydropower Plant with the Afghan border via \na 118 km 220 kV transmission line. The Project, to be implemented with Barki Tajik (BT) as the \nEA, will require minimal land acquisition and cause no resettlement as most of the transmission \nline will cross unused desert land. In total, there will be 22 affected families (176 individuals) and \none  collective  enterprise.  They  will  lose  about  1,423  m2  of  land  permanently  and  1,450  m2 \ntemporarily during construction. All of them will also lose some crops.  \n \nTo  plan  the  compensation  program  for  these  impacts,  the  EA  has  prepared  an  RP3 in \n12. \naccordance with Tajikistan law and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement and Operations Manual F2 \non  Involuntary  Resettlement.  The  RP  provides  impact  figures,  describes  the  compensation/ \nrehabilitation  framework,  and  details  all  RP  implementation  mechanisms/responsibilities.  After \ndetailed design completion, the RP will be reviewed and, if necessary, updated as a condition \nfor  approval  of  the  civil  works  contract.  RP  implementation  in  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements will be a condition to civil works mobilization.  \n \n\n                                                 \n3  Based on the ADB Operations Manual (OM) Section F2/OP & BP (2003), the content/complexity of an RP varies \ndepending  on  the  degree  of  impact  severity  of  a  project.  When  impacts  are  severe  (more  than  200  APs  to  be \nresettled or suffering more than 10% income losses), a full RP will be prepared. When losses are not severe (less \nthan 200 APs to be resettled or suffering >10% income losses), only a short RP will have to be prepared. Given the \nnumber of APs and the type of impacts they suffer, the Project will not cause severe losses, therefore only a small \nRP has been prepared.  \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n2. \n\nCompensation and Rehabilitation Framework  \n\n13. \nThe  basic  compensation/rehabilitation  principles  are  as  follows:  (i)  land  acquisition  will \nbe  avoided  or  at  least  minimized;  (ii)  compensation  will  ensure  the  maintenance  of  APs\u2019  pre-\nproject  living  standards;  (iii)  APs  will  be  fully  informed/consulted  on  compensation  options; \n(iv) AP sociocultural institutions will be supported and used; (v) LAR provisions will apply equally \nto  women  and  men;  (vi)  lack  of  formal  title  will  not  be  a  bar  to  compensation/rehabilitation; \n(vii) particular  attention  will  be  paid  to  women-headed  households  and  vulnerable  groups; \n(viii) LAR will be conceived and executed as an integral part of the Project and LAR budgets will \nbe included in project costs; and (ix) compensation will be fully provided prior to ground leveling \nand demolition.  \n\nThe  RP  also  sets  detailed  eligibility/entitlement  provisions  (Table  11.2)  for  assets \n\n14. \naffected by the Project. \n\n \nTable A11.2: Entitlements Matrix (Tajikistan) \n\nSpecification \n\nAffected People \n\nCompensation Entitlements \n\nAsset  \nTemporary \nLand \nOccupation  \n\nPermanent \nAcquisition of \nArable Land \n\nHolders of land use \ncertificate or customary \nrights and tenants \n\nAll land losses   Holders of land use \n\ncertificate or customary \nrights \n\nCrops \n\nCrops affected  All affected persons \n\nincluding holders of land \nuse certificates,  \ncustomary rights holders, \nand tenants \n\n \n\n \n\nCommunity \nAssets \n \n\n \n\nLump sum rent for occupation. If applicable, land-use \ncertificate holders will share the rent with tenants based on \ntheir contract. \n \nLand x land compensation with plots of equal \nvalue/productivity to plots lost or cash for affected land at \nreplacement cost free of taxes, registration, transfer costs. \n \nOne crop compensation in cash at full market rate for one \nharvest by default for impacts caused by tower bases. One \nadditional crop compensation for crop damages occurring \nduring construction (on a default area of 50 m2). Tenants \nand use rights holders will share the compensation based \non their contract. \n \nRehabilitation/substitution of the affected structures \n\n3. \n\nRP Implementation Mechanisms and Responsibilities \n\n \n15. \nInstitutional  Responsibilities.  The  Ministry  of  Energy  (MOE)  will  have  overall \nresponsibility  for  RP  preparation,  implementation,  and  financing  and  will  exercise  its  functions \nvia the PIU at BT. At the PIUs, RP tasks will be handled by BT environment and resettlement \nteam  which  will  collaborate  with  BT  district  offices  and  district  governments \nthe \nimplementation  of \nlevel.  The  project \nthe  compensation/rehabilitation  program  at \nimplementation  consultants  will  assist  the  environment  and  resettlement  officer  in  organizing \nand implementing the delivery of compensation/rehabilitation provisions. \n  \n16. \nDisclosure/Public  Consultation.  The  RP  has  been  prepared  based  on  repeated \nconsultation  with  the  affected  families.  As  an  appraisal  condition,  the  RP  in  English  will  be \ndisclosed  on  the  ADB  website  while  the  RP  in  Russian  will  be  disclosed  in  the  APs\u2019 \ncommunities.  An  information  pamphlet  briefly  describing  the  Project,  its  compensation \nrehabilitation entitlements, and main implementation dates in Russian will be sent to all affected \nfamilies. \n \n\nlocal \n\nin \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n59 \n\nGrievance  Procedures.  APs  will  first  lodge  a  complaint  with  the  District  BT  office.  If \n17. \nsettlement  is  not  reached  within  14  days,  the  complaint  will  then  be  lodged  to  the  BT \nenvironmental and resettlement team at the PIU. If the grievance is still not settled, the APs may \nseek redress at the appropriate court.  \n   \n18.  Monitoring.  The  PMUs  will  internally  monitor  and  report  to  the  EA  on  LAR \nimplementation on a monthly basis. The EA will report to ADB each quarter.  \n \n19. \nrehabilitation program for the Project, including 15% contingency, is TJS43,473 ($12,786).  \n \n\nFinances  and  Schedules.

Ethnically, the affected families are either Tajik or Uzbek. They all \nparticipate equally in the economy and are well inserted in the mainstream multiethnic Tajikistan \nnational culture.\n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nA. \n \nIs  the  sector  identified  as  a  national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n \n\n \nIs  the  sector  identified  as  a  national \npriority  in  country  poverty  partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \nAFG   \n  Yes \n\n \n\n \n\n    No \n\n \nTAJ   \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \nAFG  \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \nTAJ   \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  Project  will  have  direct  poverty  reduction  potential  in  Afghanistan,  where  it  will  provide  the  poor  in \nseveral  regions  of  the  country  with  year-round  electricity  access  at  preferential  tariffs.  The  rural  poor  in \nTajikistan will enjoy improved irrigation/water supply in agricultural production in summer and to a lesser \ndegree  in  winter.  Greater  year-round  access  to  electricity  both  in  Afghanistan  and  Tajikistan  will  also \nindirectly  benefit  poor  and  vulnerable  consumers  by  allowing  more  efficient  operations  to  hospitals, \nschools,  and  other  social  utilities,  which  are  often  hardest  hit  by  inadequate  power  supply  and  quality. \nImproved power supplies will also encourage light industrial and commercial activity, creating employment \nopportunities,  and  improving  productivity  and  the  quality  of  outputs  in  the  manufacturing  and  agriculture \nsectors. Such developments will trickle down with beneficial effects on the poor. \n\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                        Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nAfghanistan and Tajikistan are the poorest countries in the region, with poverty incidence of 70% and 61%, \nrespectively.  Electricity  is  an  input  to  most  economic  processes  so  it  is  essential  for  poverty  alleviation. \nProvision  of  electricity  for  Afghanistan  and  Tajikistan  is  one  of  the  key  tasks  for  both  countries.  The \nproposed Project will build a transmission line from Tajikistan to provide 300 megawatt (MW) of electricity \nto  Afghanistan  to  reduce  electricity  shortage.  Although  the  impact  on  poverty  reduction  cannot  be \nquantified,  the  low  cost  of  power  supply  will  benefit  poor  consumers  in  Afghanistan  and  the  income  of \nelectricity supply will benefit the poor in Tajikistan. The low electricity cost from the transmission line can \nexpand  electricity  consumption  to  the  poor  in  Afghanistan  and  Tajikistan.  Both  governments  will  also \nprovide some lifeline subsidies to poor people. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) is providing technical assistance (TA) regarding poverty analysis and \nsocial protection of the poor in case of tariff increase.1 Moreover, the piggy-backed TAs aim to develop a \nwebsite  within  respective  power  utilities  that  will  be  used  for  dissemination  of  information  and  public \nawareness and participation. \n\n   Yes             \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\n \nD.

DABM  maintains  and  operates  power  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution  facilities  in  Afghanistan.  It  depends  heavily  on  government  and  donor  support  to \nfund its operational and capital expenditure programs. Until 2005, even salaries of DABM staff \nwere  paid  from  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Water  (MEW)  budget.  Improving  institutional, \ntechnical,  and  financial  capacity  of  DABM  is  necessary  if  the  Project  is  to  be  implemented  by \nDABM.  Two  key  areas  would  improve  DABM\u2019s  overall  performance:  (i)  strengthening \ninstitutional  and  management  capacity  to  meet  operational  demand,  and  (ii)  improving  and \nexpanding capacity for technical employees of DABM. \n\nActivities \n\nB. \n \n2. \n \n\nStrengthening Institutional and Management Capacity \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\nPreparing  guidelines  and  teaching  materials  for  capacity  building,  covering \ncorporate  management,  human  resources  management,  planning,  budgeting, \nfinancial management and accounting, and internal auditing and reporting. \nUsing  the  guidelines  and  teaching  materials  to  design  constant  and  vocational \ntraining to DABM employees. After training, DABM staff should be able to handle \nmanagement  and  operational  work  on  financial  management  and  accounting. \nThis activity will include designing training courses for (a) DABM management on \nmanaging skills for corporations; (b)  accounting  and \nfinancial  management, \nincluding  courses  for  financial  reporting  system  at  basic,  medium,  and  high \nlevels;  (c)  corporate  planning  and  budget  management;  (d)  tariff  collection  and \nmanagement; and (e) billing and metering management. \nEstablishing  selection  criteria  and  terms  of  reference  for  the  training \ninstitutions. \nConducting  training  through  regular  training  courses\u2014eight  training  courses  of \n4 weeks duration, with 30 participants each. \nPreparing reports, including an evaluation report on completion of the training \nprogram. \n\nImproving and Expanding Capacity for Technical Employees of DABM  \n\nDesigning  training  courses  for  the  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution \nnetwork  to  improve  the  operational  efficiency  of  DABM  technical  staff.

The  consultants  will  be  engaged  through  a  firm  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (April  2006,  as  amended  from \ntime  to  time).  Consultants  will  have  expertise  in  operation  and  maintenance  of  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution facilities including customer care management, billing, commercial \nand  financial  management  of  power  utilities  and  training  within  the  energy  sector,  and  will \nconduct a training needs assessment of MEW and DABM. \n \nTraining  equipment,  including  computers  and  multimedia  projectors,  will  be  provided. \n9. \nTeaching  materials  (such  as  reference  books,  instructional  video,  English  library  books,  and \ntesting and other technical equipment required for the training center) will be provided under the \nTA.  All  equipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (April \n2006, as amended from time to time), and will be handed over to the Department of Education \nof MEW upon completion of the TA. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n65 \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO TAJIKISTAN FOR STRENGTHENING CORPORATE \nMANAGEMENT OF BARKI TAJIK \n \n\nObjective \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  designed  to  strengthen  and  improve  the  internal \nmanagement  and  customer  responsiveness  and  reliability  of  Barki  Tajik  (BT),  a  public-owned \npower  company  in  Tajikistan.  During  the  past  5  years  BT\u2019s  management  and  institutional \ncapacity have improved but its services are still poor and inefficient. Current technical losses are \nassessed  to  be  around  16%  and  nontechnical  losses  about  14%.  The  company  is  run  by  a \nchairperson  without  the  control  of  a  board  of  directors,  the  decision  making  process  is  not \ntransparent, and there are no external controls. The Government of Tajikistan (the Government) \nplans to restructure and unbundle the company starting in 2008. Although unbundling is a long-\nterm  solution  and  target  for  BT  as  designed  under  the  Power  Rehabilitation  Project,1 in  the \nshort-  term,  BT  must  establish  an  efficient  management  and  rational  institutional  structure  to \neffectively  design  and  control  the  planning,  budgeting,  revenue  management,  and  corporate \naccounting  system.  One  way  to  achieve  immediate  results  in  terms  of  efficiency  and  proper \nmanagement structure is through a 3\u20135 year performance-based management contract or other \nform of contracts. \n \nB. \n \n2. \n \n\nAn international consulting firm will be recruited to undertake the following activities:  \n\nScope \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\nlong-term  benefits \n\nconducting an audit (managerial, financial, commercial, and technical) of BT and \nof the power sector in Tajikistan; \nby  benchmarking  against  similar  projects  around  the  world,  define  the  most \nappropriate  scheme  (service  contract,  management  contract,  lease,  etc.)  that \nbest suits the objectives of the Government and local environment in Tajikistan; \norganizing  a  study  tour  or  inviting  resource  persons  from  relevant  countries \nwhere  performance  based  management  contracts  have  been  implemented \nsuccessfully; \npreparing  and  conducting  training  programs  as  needed  on  the  various  forms  of \nprivate  sector  participation,  showing  the  advantages  and  disadvantages,  short- \nand \nthe  country/power  utility,  different  modes  of \ncontracting, etc.;    \nassessing  the  potential  interest  of  the  private  sector  in  performance  based \nmanagement contracts n Tajikistan; \nproposing a structure to the Government regarding the corporate governance of \nBT, including the formation of board of directors for BT and the preparation of a \nboard  of  directors\u2019  code  of  conduct,  terms  of  reference,  fiduciary  duties,  and \nrelated function rules; \ndeveloping a website for BT to advertise information on the company, project and \nongoing procurement, technical and financial results, etc.; \ndefining jointly with the Government the performance criteria that will apply to the \nmanagement contract, and fixing realistic and achievable targets;  \nspecifying  clear  targets  about  system  performance  to  be  achieved  over  the \ncontract; \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB.  2000.

MOE \nwill nominate a core group of counterpart staff, headed by the TA director, to work closely with \nthe consultant on a day-to-day basis.  \n \n7. \nThe  TA  will  finance  the  services  of  international  consultants  for  40  person-months  and \nnational consultants for 110 person-months. The consultants will be engaged through a firm in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (April  2006,  as  amended  from \ntime  to  time).  The  consultant  team  will  have  expertise  in  the  power  sector;  private  sector \nparticipation  under  management  contracts  and  other  forms  of  contracts;  and  financial, \ncommercial, technical, and legal expertise. \n \n8. \nTraining  equipment,  including  computers  and  multimedia  projectors,  will  be  provided. \nTeaching  materials  (such  as  reference  books,  instructional  video,  English  library  books,  and \ntesting and other technical equipment required for the training center) will be provided under the \nTA.  All  equipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (April \n2006, as amended from time to time), and will be handed over to BT on completion of the TA. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nAFGHANISTAN INCREMENTAL ADMINISTRATION, TRAINING, AND PROJECT \nIMPLEMENTATION UNIT SUPPORT \n \n\nA. \n\nBackground Information \n\nAs  in  other  sectors,  low  civil  service  wages  are  not  sufficient  to  attract  younger \n\n1. \nThe  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Water  (MEW)  manages  controls  and  operates  the  power \nsector of Afghanistan through eight departments and four state-owned enterprises, of which the \nlargest is Afghanistan Electricity Authority (DABM). \n \n2. \nOverall, capacity in the power sector to carry out core accountability functions is weak, \nboth  at  MEW  and  DABM.  This  is  particularly  evident  in  the  implementation  by  MEW  of  major \ncapital  investments  that  are  being  made  in  the  sector,  and  in  specific  areas  such  as \nprocurement, technical, and financial management.  \n \n3. \nTo date, MEW has been assisted by the project support implementation unit financed by \nthe  Afghan  Reconstruction  Trust  Fund  (ARTF)  to  cope  with  the  technical,  procurement,  and \nfinancial  management  of  ongoing  projects.  Since  September  2006,  the  services  of  the  project \nsupport implementation unit have been discontinued. The senior advisor to MOE has been also \ntransferred to the Ministry of Economy. The project implementation unit (PIU) within MOE relies \nonly  on  the  assistance  of  a  single  project  implementation  consultant  financed  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), whose services will end on 31 December 2006. \n \n4. \nprofessional staff who can replace the ageing workforce which has technically outdated skills.  \n \n5. \nThe  capacity  of  MEW  for  preparing  the  budget  and  overseeing  public  spending  in  the \nsector  is  weak.  MEW  also  has  weak  planning  capability\u2014all  MEW  projects  have  equal \nimportance and it has enormous difficulties prioritizing them. \n \n6. \ntechnical (engineering) capacity and in procurement principles and practices. \n \nMEW  is  fully  committed  by  its  project  administration  task  and  does  not  have  the \n7. \nresources to work on its own mandate\u2014to dictate the policy of the sector, including necessary \ntariff increases, power utility reporting, and restructuring of DABM. \n \nTo address the above issues, it is proposed to (i) strengthen MEW with support from an \n8. \ninternational  consultant  who  will  secure  this  new  capital  investment,  (ii)  assist  MEW  in  the \nsupervision of ongoing projects, and (iii) reinforce the existing PIU. \n \nB. \n\nMEW has a procurement unit which requires considerable strengthening both in terms of \n\nDescription of the Services \n\n9. \nThe  consultants  will  assist  MEW  in  (i)  project  administration  of  the  ADB  projects \n(ongoing  and  new);  (ii)  setting  up  and  updating  the  project  accounting  system;  (iii)  providing \nadvice to MEW in terms of project management and reporting to ADB; and (iv) technical matters \nincluding but not limited to procurement. \n \n10. \naccounting systems; and environmental, resettlement, social and poverty issues. \n \n\nThe consultants will provide training to MEW staff in procurement issues; financial and \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n69 \n\nThe  consultant  will  provide  advice  to  MEW  in  terms  of  planning  development  of  a \n11. \nstrategy  for  the  power  sector;  tariffs;  and  other  issues  such  as  reduction  of  technical  and \nnontechnical losses, negotiation and implementation of power purchase agreements, reporting \nfrom power utility, budgeting, etc. \n \nC. \n \n12. \ninclude the following: \n \n\nA total of 50 person-months of international consulting services will be required.
