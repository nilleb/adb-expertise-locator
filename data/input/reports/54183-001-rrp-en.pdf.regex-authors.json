THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Kingdom of Bhutan for the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program \n(CARES program) under the countercyclical support facility COVID-19 pandemic response option \n(CPRO).1 \n  \n2.   The CARES Program will support the efforts of the Royal Government of Bhutan to \nstimulate the economy, protect public health, and mitigate the effects of the coronavirus disease \n2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the population. The government is implementing a comprehensive \neconomic  contingency  plan  (ECP)  through  an  integrated  social,  fiscal,  monetary,  and \nprogrammatic approach to mitigate the shocks to the economy and protect public health. The \nprogram will support the economic response measures under the ECP. \n \n3.  The proposed program is critical, as it will provide timely support to help the government \nimplement socioeconomic responses\u2014supplementing the ongoing effective health responses to \ncontain the pandemic. This reflects the ability of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to respond \nquickly to the government\u2019s needs, based on a strong record of ADB assistance to Bhutan in \nstrengthening public sector and macroeconomic management. Bhutan meets all the access \ncriteria of ADB\u2019s CPRO under the countercyclical support facility (CSF). Table 1 summarizes the \nprogram\u2019s compliance with the criteria. Detailed justification is in Appendix 4.  \n \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria for CPRO \nCPRO Access Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \n1. Adverse impact of  Growth will likely plunge to 1.0%\u2014a 5.0 percentage point drop from pre-COVID-19 \nexogenous shocks  estimates.  Stringent  preventive  measures,  though  effective,  have  weakened  the \nperformance of the finance sector, the fiscal stance, and livelihoods. \n2. Countercyclical  Announced  on  10  April  2020,  the  government\u2019s  pro-poor  countercyclical  economic \ndevelopment  contingency package worth about $400 million (16.8% of GDP) is a comprehensive \nexpenditures  intervention. The bulk of this package (72.5%) involves cash transfers which will secure the \nlivelihoods of 8.2% of the population living below the poverty line and at least 23,000 \ndisplaced employees and their families. This will be complemented by various financial \nmeasures encompassing interest waivers on loan deferment and subsidized loans for \nbusinesses. The combined expenditures are expected to keep demand afloat while \nmitigating insolvency. \n3. Pre-shock record  Fiscal deficit has been maintained consistently lower than 3% of GDP since FY1993. \nof generally sound  Additional  safeguards  and  prudential  limits  are  reflected  in  the  Public  Debt  Policy \nmacroeconomic  (2016). The Royal Monetary Authority also applies strong macro-financial prudence, with \nmanagement  stringent  reserve  requirements  and  conservative  capital  adequacy  ratios.  Bhutan\u2019s \ndevelopment philosophy of Gross National Happiness is inherently aligned with the \nSustainable Development Goals. \n4. Structural reforms   On 29 January 2020, the national contingency committee led by the Ministry of Health \nlaunched the National Preparedness and Response Plan (NPRP) for COVID-19 and \nestablished a technical group who implemented action plans for COVID-19 responses. The \nNPRP was activated when the first positive case was confirmed on 6 March 2020, followed \nby  increased  budget  reallocation  to  implement  high  standard  responses  including \nmandatory  government-funded  quarantines  and  high  rates  of  real-time  reverse \ntranscription polymerase chain reaction tests. The government has incurred about $8.9 \nmillion, and an additional budget of $26.6 million has been allocated to the Ministry of \nHealth for worst-case scenario responses.   \n5. Debt sustainability  Although public debt reached 117.0% of GDP in FY2019, the IMF\u2019s assessment reflected \na \u201cmoderate level of debt distress\u201d as 74.4% of this debt is concentrated in financially viable \nhydropower projects. In the long term, the situation is expected to improve as hydropower \n \n1  ADB. 2020. Policy Paper: ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \nA.    Background and Development Constraints    \n4.  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread in Bhutan. The COVID-19 pandemic \nhas spread rapidly around the world, including Bhutan. On 29 January 2020, the government \nlaunched the National Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19. On 30 January 2020, the \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 epidemic a public health emergency \nof international concern. The Ministry of Health subsequently established a technical advisory \ngroup to prepare an action plan for the COVID-19 pandemic response. The group has completed \nimplementing the health-focused COVID-19 contingency plans in the country\u2019s 20 districts and \ntrained health staff and stakeholders on the various standard operating procedures related to \nCOVID-19. The first case in Bhutan was confirmed on 6 March 2020, when a foreign tourist who \narrived in the country by air on 3 March 2020 tested positive for COVID-19. The government \nsubsequently undertook intensive surveillance of this patient\u2019s contacts. As of 23 April 2020, \nseven confirmed cases, all imported and three of whom have recovered, have been reported to \nWHO.2  \n \n5.  Free health services in Bhutan. Bhutan\u2019s basic health services are free, as enshrined in \nthe Constitution. Bhutan is in the medium category of the United Nations Human Development \nIndex (0.62), ranked 134th out of 189 countries. It has seen rapid economic development, with an \nincrease in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita from $565 in 1990 to $3,243 in 2018.3 Only \n1.5% of the population lives under the $1.9 a day international poverty line, while 8.2% are below \nthe national poverty line.4 Comprehensive health services are provided through various levels of \ncare, including treatment abroad if a service is not available in the country. Bhutan ranks second, \nafter Sri Lanka, among the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries \non the universal health service coverage index, which comprises 16 indicators across four \nprogram areas: (i) reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health; (ii) communicable diseases; \n(iii) noncommunicable diseases; and (iv) health service capacity, access, and health security. \n \n6.  Inadequate health care system. Despite these developments, the health sector faces \nchallenges. Its bed\u2013population ratio, at 1.8 hospital beds per 1,000 population, is much lower than \n3.6 per 1,000 in Sri Lanka. Only one hospital in Bhutan (the Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National \nReferral Hospital in the capital, Thimphu) is equipped with CT scans and enough critical care \nbeds to manage severe and critical COVID-19 cases. In addition, most hospitals and health \nfacilities are in urban areas, and access to health care services is limited in most rural areas. \nBhutan had only 3.7 doctors per 10,000 population and 14.1 nurses per 10,000 population as of \n2017. Most doctors are primary care physicians, with specialists mostly based in Thimphu, where \n \n2 Royal Government of Bhutan, Ministry of Health.  \n3  World Bank. DataBank. Bhutan.  \n4  Government of Bhutan, National Statistics Bureau. 2017. Bhutan Poverty Analysis Report 2017. Thimphu. \n ", "3 \n \n104 of the 269 doctors were located in 2016. COVID-19 is stretching Bhutan\u2019s health service \ndelivery capacity, as it is already strained by the increasing burden of noncommunicable diseases, \nwhich account for 69% of all deaths (3,200 deaths per year, of which 1,700 are males and \n1,500 are females).5   \n \n7.  Prevention and containment measures. The government has taken early and stringent \nprevention and containment response measures. As a resource-constrained country with limited \nhealth facilities\u2014infrastructure and personnel\u2014an outbreak of infections could easily overwhelm \nthe existing system capacity. Bhutan\u2019s extended family households also pose high potential \ncontagion risks. When the first infectious case was identified, the government immediately \npursued  the  highest  standards  of  preventive  and  containment  measures.  These  include \nprohibiting the arrival of foreign visitors to the country, restricting public gatherings, closing \nschools  and  educational  institutions,  and  imposing  mandatory quarantines  financed  by  the \ngovernment. The mandatory quarantine of 14 days for returning citizens and residents was \nextended to 21 days on 1 April 2020. As of 23 April 2020, 5,568 citizens who have returned from \nabroad  are  undergoing  the mandatory  quarantine  period.  Bhutan\u2019s  1,891  real-time reverse \ntranscription polymerase chain reaction tests reflected the highest testing rate in the South Asian \nregion, at 2,600 tests per million inhabitants. Out of those tested, 7 have been confirmed positive \nfor COVID-19 and 98 are suspected cases. All visitors from high-risk countries are being tested \nfor laboratory evidence of infection with COVID-19, irrespective of symptoms, effective 3 April \n2020. The government has incurred about Nu672 million on preventive and preparatory activities \nsuch as quarantine facilities and the purchase of equipment and essential items. In the event of \nmultiple local transmissions, a lockdown will be activated. Priorities will then shift to ensuring \nuninterrupted access to essential services and sustenance. To ensure this does not paralyze the \ncountry,  while  prioritizing  public  safety,  targeted  lockdowns  will  be  implemented  based  on \nstandard operating procedures consistent with WHO guidelines. \n  \n8.  Severe economic impacts. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly dampened growth \nprospects. The adverse socioeconomic impacts, including secondary effects, are complex. Since \nthe first detection, stringent preventive measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 have \nresulted in an unprecedented decline in economic activity, including a complete standstill in \nindustries such as tourism. The ban on entry of foreigners by air has had a significant negative \nimpact on aviation and tourism and their supply chain of tour operators, hotels, restaurants, and \ntransport. An initial 30% reduction in direct tourism receipts from the daily tariff for visitors is \nestimated for FY2020. Further restrictions were imposed on 23 March 2020, with the closure of \nsurface entry points. This has resulted in significant supply-chain disruptions, especially on \nimports of goods and labor from India. The construction industry\u2014traditionally a strong driver of \ngrowth\u2014is now facing a shortage of 21,568 workers because of entry restrictions as the industry \nemploys migrant labor, and manufacturing sector also faces disruptions in raw material supply. \nOther precautionary measures, such as social distancing, have also dampened retail sector \ndemand.  \n \n9.  Uncertain economic outlook. Developments suggest that the pandemic is likely to be \nprotracted.  This  will  severely  test  the  capacity  of  economies,  especially  small  landlocked \ndeveloping countries, to absorb further shocks for a sustained period. Before the pandemic struck, \nGDP growth in FY2020 had been expected to rise to 6.0% because of increased hydropower \ncapacity. However, ADB\u2019s lower-bound estimates for GDP growth, which is the likely current \nsituation, factoring in the spillover effects caused by preventive restrictions and social distancing \nmeasures, could drive growth down by 5.0 percentage points to 1.0% in FY2020. This would \n \n5  WHO. 2018. Noncommunicable Diseases: Country Profiles 2018.

Moreover, these estimates do not include the additional impacts emanating \nfrom supply disruptions, interrupted remittances, possible social and financial crisis, and long-\nterm  effects  on  health  care  and  education.8 Therefore,  the  actual  costs  associated  with \ncontainment measures are substantially higher.      \n \nFigure: Economic Impact of COVID-19  \nGrowth Scenarios\n8\n777...444\n7\n666...333 Pre-COVID-19\n6 6.0\n5\n444...444\n4 4.1\n333...888\nCOVID-19 moderate;1.9 \n3 percentage point impact\n2\n1 1.0\nCOVID-19 Updated;5.0 \npercentage point impact\n0\n2016 2017 2018 2019 2020  \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n10.  Fiscal pressure. Efforts to contain the pandemic have placed significant fiscal pressure \non the government. The directly affected sectors have multiple linkages to the rest of the \neconomy\u2014in addition to being employment-intensive, they contribute tax revenue and convertible \ncurrency. The immediate fiscal impacts in FY2020 resulting from foregone revenues from tourism \nroyalties, visa fees, and income taxes are estimated to be Nu887 million.9 Further, fiscal space \nwill shrink as a result of diminished demand, causing losses in sales taxes and corporate income \ntaxes. Initial estimates for FY2020 alone highlight a 9.0% decline in domestic revenue compared \nwith initial projections (Table 2). Consequently, the fiscal deficit is expected to widen to 5.6% of \nGDP compared with a pre-COVID-19 estimate of 3.0% of GDP for FY2020. The impacts for \nFY2021 are projected to be more pronounced, with a steep decline in domestic revenue by 21.0% \ncontributing to further widening of the fiscal deficit to 9.4% of GDP. Considering that government \nspending accounts for 27.4% of GDP, an inevitable weakening of the government\u2019s fiscal position \nwill reinforce weak aggregate demand in the absence of offsetting sources of funding. \n \n11.  The  pandemic  has  also  forced  a  reprioritization  of  the  government\u2019s  development \nactivities. Considering that growth was expected to receive impetus from a 51.0% elevation in \n \n6   ADB estimates, 9 April 2020. \n7   International Monetary Fund. April 2020. World Economic Outlook.

Significant risks to the finance sector. The preventive measures pose significant risks \nto the finance sector. The economic slowdown will affect the asset quality of both the banking and \nnonbanking financial segments. Tourism and services account for 23.0% of outstanding credit, \nretail trade for 14.0%, and construction for 27.0%, all of which will be under stress. Nonperforming \nloans (NPLs) increased sharply from 12.8% to 29.8% in tourism and from 17.4% to 32.5% in \ntransport from December 2019 to March 2020. With accelerating job losses and plummeting \ndemand reinforcing each other, borrower defaults are imminent. The sharp increase in NPLs, as \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises struggle to meet debt repayments, signal weakening bank \nbalance sheets and a further breach in macro-prudential thresholds.11 This is evident in the \nincrease in NPLs for trade and commerce from 17.2% to 27.0% over the same period. The \nnonbank financial industry is similarly challenged, with falling credit growth and rising NPLs. \nNonbank NPLs increased in all areas from December 2019 to March 2020\u2014from 24.1% to 38.2% \nin the service sector, from 19.1% to 51.8% for personal loans, from 25.5% to 46.8% for trade and \ncommerce, and from 21.0% to 45.4% in transport. The general insurance segment has been \nseverely affected by the slowdown in areas such as construction, vehicles, and equipment \nimports. This is aggravated by the inevitable increase in defaults on life insurance premiums \nbecause of job losses. Capital markets, which have witnessed some growth in secondary trading \nover the past few years, are expected to slow down significantly, wiping out recent gains. With an \nanticipated fall in dividend payouts in the corporate segment, stock prices are anticipated to fall \ncombined with lower demand for new capital and a decline in fund-raising. \n \n13.  Profound  social  impacts.  COVID-19  will  also  have  profound  social  impacts.  An \nestimated 11,798 employees in the tourism and allied industries will be directly affected. Hotels \nand restaurants have a disproportionately large share of unskilled female employees. The \ninformal sector, which includes households and self-employed individuals, also engages a large \nnumber (estimated at 80% of the workforce) of unskilled and vulnerable groups such as young \n \n10 ADB. 2020.

Likewise, the poverty \nheadcount rate based on $1.9/day (adjusted for purchasing power parity) is expected to result in \n2,176\u201312,362 additional poor, driven by a COVID-19-induced per capita reduction in consumption \nof 5%\u201320%.14  \n \n14.  Sound  macroeconomic  management.  The  government  maintained  a  sound \nmacroeconomic management record before the pandemic. From FY1998 to FY2018, Bhutan\u2019s \neconomy grew remarkably\u2014at an annual average of 7.0%\u2014driven by hydropower construction \nand operations. Before the pandemic, the economy showed relatively strong performance, with \npositive longer-term development prospects (Table 3). While public debt and the current account \ndeficits are high, this largely reflects borrowing for investment in the expansion of revenue-\ngenerating hydropower capacity. The government has demonstrated its commitment and ability \nin servicing its debt without reneging on any repayments. Its Public Debt Policy (2016) also \nprovides clear guidelines for public institutions in accessing debt, with numerous safeguards. The \nconstitution requires that all recurrent expenditure be financed by domestic resources, which \nensures that any debt availed is channeled toward capital investment. The Constitution mandates \na minimum reserve requirement of 12 months of essential imports. Further, the government\u2019s \nmacroeconomic prudence has ensured adequate buffers to address any possible balance-of-\npayments challenges. On the external front, this is most evident in the cautious management of \nconvertible currency reserves and stringent external commercial borrowing regulations, resulting \nin a healthy accumulation of international reserves. This enabled the government to address \nbalance-of-payments challenges in 2013 when the Royal Monetary Authority (the central bank) \nliquidated $400 million to finance the current account deficit with India, without breaching the \nconstitutional threshold. On the domestic financial front, macro-financial prudence exercised over \nthe years has strengthened fundamentals, enabling the economy to build capital adequacy buffers \nto absorb macroeconomic pressures. \n  \nTable 3: Pre-COVID-19 Macroeconomic Indicators \n  Fiscal Year \nItem  2015  2016  2017  2018  2019 \nGDP growth (%, constant prices)  6.2  7.4  6.3  3.8  4.4 \nInflation (CPI % change)  6.7  3.4  4.3  3.6  2.8 \nCurrent account balance (% of GDP)  (28.3)  (31.1)  (23.2)  (19.1)  (22.6) \nRevenue and grants (% of GDP)  28.8  29.9  27.2  31.9  24.5 \n     Current revenue    20.5  19.5  22.6  19.6 \nExpenditure and on lending  29.3  32.0  31.9  32.2  27.4 \nOverall fiscal surplus (deficit)  (1.5)  (1.1)  (3.4)  (0.3)  (2.2) \nPublic debt (% of GDP)  94.0  112.3  109.3  105.2  117.0 \nGross international reserves ($ million)  958  1,119  1,104  1,111  1,065 \n ( ) = negative, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019, CPI = consumer price index, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates and Government of Bhutan, National Statistics Bureau.  \n \n15.

Inflation was \nalso at a 10-year low, at 2.8% in FY2019. An anticipated rebound of 6.0% for FY2020 was \npredicated based on fiscal expansion as well as robust consumption growth.15  \n  \n16.  Government\u2019s socioeconomic responses. While the government has implemented the \nNational  Preparedness  and  Response  Plan  for  COVID-19  effectively,  the  plan\u2019s  stringent \nmeasures on border closure and isolation have caused adverse socioeconomic impacts (paras \n8\u201313). To mitigate the adverse impacts, the government launched the Nu30 billion (about $400 \nmillion) ECP, equivalent to about 16.8% of GDP, on 10 April 2020. The proceeds of ECP will be \nchanneled through the newly established National Resilience Fund. The government priority is to \nensure that the livelihoods of the marginalized are secured, and the impacts on productive sectors \nare mitigated so they can eventually rebound. Given the data and information constraints and the \nlargely informal nature of employment, the risks of exclusion of vulnerable people are high, \nprompting a blanket extension of relief for some interventions. Hence, the financing requirements \nrelative to GDP are large. To ensure an inclusive intervention reaches as many of the affected \npeople as possible, the government plans to execute the ECP through three broad approaches \nbelow, which complement each other, making the program more impactful. \n \n(i)   Social relief. This takes the form of direct monthly cash transfers to affected \nindividuals, for an initial period of 3 months, extendable to 12 months depending \non the situation. This will involve an outlay of Nu21,665 million (about 72.5% of the \ntotal ECP cost), which will directly benefit 8.2% (about 57,000 people) of the \npopulation living below the poverty line (footnote 4) plus at least an estimated \n23,000 displaced employees, unemployed people actively seeking jobs, and self-\nemployed individuals in the informal sector (footnote 6). Monthly disbursements up \nto Nu12,000 per person will be made directly to the bank accounts of beneficiaries, \nif available. At the central level, the Ministry of Labour and Human Resources will \ncoordinate the registration and verification of beneficiaries. At the local level, \ndecentralized  institutional  bodies,  including  social  welfare  officers,  will  be \nleveraged to verify and facilitate the disbursement of benefits to those who do not \n \nhave bank accounts.  \n(ii)   Monetary and fiscal measures. The total outlay for these measures is about \nNu4.6 billion (about 15.0% of the total ECP cost). Monetary measures are critical \nto ensure the economy has adequate money for business entities to function. \nThese include (a) a waiver of interest and a 3-month loan repayment deferment \nfor all businesses and individuals; (b) subsidized working capital at a preferential \nrate of 5 %; (c) a 3-month extension of the gestation period for ongoing projects \n(extendable by another 3 months); (d) working capital through the Cottage and \nSmall Industries Bank for cottage and small industries at an interest rate of 4% for \na 3-month period (extendable by another 3 months); and (e) micro-loans through \nCottage and Small Industries Bank up to a ceiling of Nu0.5 million at an interest \nrate  of  2%  for  a  3-month  period  (extendable  by  another  3  months).16 The \ngovernment will also execute fiscal measures to ease cash flow constraints on \nbusinesses. These include deferments of business and corporate income taxes \nand the sales tax for businesses and customs duty on essential imports. As an \nimmediate measure, budgetary funds have been disbursed to procure 6 months\u2019 \n \n15 ADB estimates (2020). This is the baseline forecast. The growth rate of 5.2% highlighted in the Asian Development \nOutlook 2020 factors in some minor impacts (ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook 2020: What Drives Innovation \nin Asia? Manila). \n16 Bhutan\u2019s lending rates in FY2019 ranged from 7.94% to 14.0%, averaging 10.97%. \n ", "8 \n \nworth of essential commodities reserves, totaling Nu1.23 billion. As a highly import-\ndependent  country,  these  reserves  are  a  critical  component  of  the  National \nPreparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19. In the event of a complete \nlockdown in Bhutan coupled with the extended lockdown period in India, the \ncountry will likely experience acute shortages in essential food and commodities. \nThe ECP fiscal measures also include initial budget allocation of Nu1.0 billion to \nthe Ministry of Health for the prevention, containment, and treatment of COVID-19 \nfrom April 2020 to August 2020, and additional budget allocation of Nu2.0 billion \nfor health-related responses in preparation for a worst-case scenario. \n (iii)   Targeted  interventions.  In  addition  to  conventional  fiscal  measures,  the \ngovernment is planning to execute targeted projects to engage the displaced in \nproductive activities. This is contingent on no detection of local transmission of \nCOVID-19,  which  would  result  in  a  complete  lockdown.  These  targeted \ninterventions will focus on absorbing the economically displaced in three sectors: \n(a)  tourism  through  tourism  infrastructure  development  and  upskilling,  (b) \nagriculture through food security, and (c) construction. The proposed outlay for \n \nthese interventions is Nu3.7 billion (about 12.5% of the total ECP cost).\n \n17.  Regional cooperation and integration. Given the constraints arising from being a small \nlandlocked economy, regional cooperation is critical on many fronts. Foremost, the economy is \nheavily integrated with neighboring India through fiscal and trade channels, most notably in \nmutually beneficial energy cooperation. It is also continuously pursuing integration with other \nmembers of SAARC. This is most evident in the increase in Bhutan\u2013Bangladesh trade facilitation \narrangements. As a heavily import-dependent country, for both goods and labor, the pandemic \nhas  imposed  significant  disruptions.  Nevertheless,  the  government  has  entered  into  an \narrangement  with  the Government  of  India to  ensure  an  uninterrupted  supply  of  essential \ncommodities and raw materials. At the regional level, the government has expressed its solidarity \nby contributing $100,000 to the SAARC COVID-19 Emergency Fund to combat the pandemic. In \naddition to contributions from SAARC member states, the SAARC Development Fund contributed \n$5  million  to  the  emergency  fund.  Furthermore,  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic \nCooperation program recognizes the importance of regional cooperation in ensuring coordinated \nresponses to mitigate the impact of the pandemic effectively\u2014most importantly in the recovery \nprocess. \n \nB.    Proposed Program and ADB\u2019s Value Addition  \n18.  Proposed program. The CARES Program will support the government in implementing \nits countercyclical comprehensive COVID-19 response. It will support the implementation of relief \nmeasures for vulnerable groups and economic stimulus measures for productive sectors. It will \nprovide the government with the fiscal space to address critical public health needs while \nmanaging the economic downturn. The program is aligned with the following ADB Strategy 2030 \noperational priorities: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, (ii) accelerating \nprogress  in  gender  equality,  (iii)  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity,  and \n(iv) fostering regional cooperation and integration.17  ADB\u2019s long-standing experience in Bhutan \nin the areas of public sector management, health and gender; including engagement with other \ndevelopment partners, will add value to the proposed program. \n \n \n17 ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n ", "9 \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s Value Addition. ADB has long-standing experience in Bhutan highlights value \naddition  in  areas  of  (i)  public  sector  management,  (ii)  health  care  capacity  and  gender \ninclusiveness, and (iii) development partner coordination. ADB\u2019s sustained engagement in key \nsectors, accompanied by flexibility in approaches and modalities and a quick response to country \nneeds, is important for development effectiveness.18 ADB\u2019s support on public sector management  \nhas  encompassed  (i)  improving  macroeconomic  stability  and  resilience  to  shocks;  (ii) \nstrengthening  debt  and  government  financial management; (iii)  enhancing  the  stability  and \nintegrity  of  the  financial  systems  and  regulatory  reforms;  (iv)  supporting  capital  market \ndevelopment; and (vi) supporting capacity building. ADB supported the government in addressing \nmacroeconomic shocks and structural issues resulting from the Indian rupee shortage in 2012\u2013\n2013, through both policy advice and two policy-based loans on strengthening macroeconomic \nmanagement.19 Aligned with the first strategic pillar of the country partnership strategy, 2019\u2013\n2023, integrated reform programs and technical assistance are programmed to provide continuing \nsupport on public sector and finance sector management, aiming to help Bhutan\u2019s sustainable \nrecovery. Two structural reform programs for rural finance development and finance sector \ndevelopment are programmed in 2020\u20132021.20   \n \n20.  ADB has provided health-related and gender mainstreaming support. In response to the \nCOVID-19 outbreak, in March 2020 it has approved a grant of $100,000 to support Bhutan in \nenhancing its capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak.21 ADB is also \nexpediting medical supply procurement packages worth $400,000 that can be used for COVID-\n19 treatment under the ongoing Health Sector Development Program.22 The CARES gender-\nrelated support builds on ADB\u2019s prior technical assistance to strengthen gender mainstreaming \nat the central and decentralized levels. The government\u2019s response to COVID-19 has an explicit \nfocus on the needs and constraints faced by women and is informed by the findings of the ADB-\nsupported study on unpaid care work, which points to women\u2019s greater exposure and vulnerability \nto external shocks because of their multiple responsibilities as breadwinners and caretakers of \nchildren, the elderly, and the sick.23  \n \n21.  ADB has collaborated closely with the IMF and other development partners. ADB is \ncoordinating with the World Bank in its COVID-19 response assistance, which consists of about \n$19.8 million through its Investment Project Financing and International Bank for Reconstruction \nand Development Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option, scheduled for approval by June 2020. \nIn addition, the World Bank is providing the third programmatic Development Policy Credit for \nstrengthening fiscal management and private sector employment opportunities in the amount of \n$40  million.  Likewise,  the  IMF  continues  to  provide  advisory  and  technical  support  to  the \ngovernment in public sector and financial management, as well as regular debt sustainability \nanalysis in conjunction with its Article IV consultation missions, in which ADB participates as a \nmission member. For public health response, ADB has worked closely with WHO (lead), the \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and other resident United Nations agencies and \ndevelopment partners. ADB has participated in development partner group meetings and worked \n \n18 Independent Evaluation Department. 2019.

Impacts of the Reform \n22.  The program will contribute to government expenditures for mitigating the immediate \nadverse effects of COVID-19 on businesses and the population. This will be achieved through \ntwo reform areas: (i) inclusive relief measures for vulnerable groups\u2014displaced employees, \nunemployed people actively seeking employment, and self-employed individuals in the informal \nsector, most of whom are women\u2014implemented; and (ii) economic stimulus for productive \nsectors provided. The first reform area will secure at least 6 months\u2019 worth of commodities \nreserves to ensure uninterrupted supply for the entire population, which is crucial for a highly \nimport-dependent country in the event of a complete lockdown. Efficient distribution channels will \nbe used to reach the most vulnerable, including women and the economically displaced. The \nsecond reform area will implement measures to provide economic relief to productive sectors, \nstimulating some level of demand and economic activity. This will involve (i) 3-month deferment \nof loan repayments at 0% interest for all businesses and individuals, and (ii) highly subsidized \nloans at 2% interest for rural and agricultural activities, both with gender targets to address the \nimpact of the COVID-19 outbreak on vulnerable women.

The  government  has  requested  a  concessional  loan  of  $20  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nconcessional ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The program will be funded \nby a portion of the country\u2019s performance-based allocation in concessional ordinary capital \nresources lending. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an \ninterest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.26    \n \n25.  Debt sustainability. Bhutan\u2019s public and publicly guaranteed debt (public debt) reached \n117.0% of GDP in FY2019, of which domestic debt is 8.9% of GDP in FY2019.27 Of the total \nexternal debt, about 74.4% is Indian rupee-denominated self-liquidating hydropower debt, and \nthe remaining 25.6% in convertible currencies is mostly on concessional terms from multilateral \ndevelopment banks. Hydropower project loans from the government of India are low risk, in which \nIndia covers both the financial and construction risks of the projects and buys surplus electricity \nat a price, reflecting cost plus a 15.0% net return. Despite exceeding conventional thresholds, the \neconomic and financial viability of these loans are corroborated by the IMF\u2019s assessment of a \n\u201cmoderate level of debt distress.\u201d28 In addition, Bhutan\u2019s non-hydropower external debt stock is \nwell within the thresholds stipulated in the Public Debt Policy (35% of GDP).29 In the medium term, \nBhutan\u2019s public debt, after falling to 116.4% of GDP in FY2020, will increase to 119.1% in FY2021 \nas nominal GDP growth falls and the primary deficit rises because of the pandemic. The debt-to-\nGDP ratio is likely to continue to fall as the economic conditions improve and the primary balance \nturns a surplus and reaches 79.5% in FY2024. The proposed loan of $20 million will result in a \nmarginal 0.7% increase in the public debt stock. ADB\u2019s and the World Bank\u2019s loans for FY2020 \nbudget support are concessional, which will not alter the rating under the IMF-World Bank debt \nsustainability analysis. Details are in the Debt Sustainability Analysis document (footnote 26). \n \nE.    Implementation Arrangements \n26.  The program will be implemented from May 2020 to June 2021. The MOF will be the \nexecuting agency for the CARES Program. The government, through the MOF, will monitor the \nbudget execution and flow of funds for countercyclical measures under the ECP. The MOF will \nsubmit reports on expenditures made from the national budget to support the countercyclical \nmeasures under the ECP to ADB. The government has set up a dedicated committee within the \nMOF to monitor the implementation of the National Resilience Fund. The Prime Minister\u2019s Office \nand a special task force led by the governor of the central bank will oversee the implementation \nand  coordination  of  the  ECP,  facilitated  by  a  weekly  review  meeting.  For  monitoring  and \nevaluation, tracking of program beneficiaries will be undertaken by relevant agencies such as the \nMinistry of Labour and Human Resources, the Tourism Council of Bhutan, and the National \nStatistics Bureau through a central management information system. To ensure effective targeting \nand monitoring, the government has started registration of vulnerable groups, including single \nmothers, elderly, differently abled, displaced employees, and those in informal sector. Gender \ntargets have also been set in the design and monitoring framework and will be tracked during \nprogram  implementation  and  adequately  reported  in  MOF\u2019s  semiannual  progress  reports. \n \n26 Loan Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) was conducted by ADB in \nApril 2020. The actual government debt\u2013GDP figures in FY2019 were 109.7%, as reflected in the Asian Development \nOutlook 2020 (ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook 2020: What Drives Innovation in Asia? Manila), but the \nvariation in the Debt Sustainability Analysis is due to the use of estimated debt figures from the IMF\u2019s WEO 2019 to \nensure consistency for the following years (FY2020\u2013FY2024).  \n28 International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2018.

The \nproceeds of the loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n27.  Safeguards. The program is not expected to have adverse environmental or social \nsafeguards impacts and will not trigger ADB\u2019s safeguards policy requirements. It is category C for \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Investment activities prohibited \nunder ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement (2009) will be excluded. \n \n28.  Poverty and social. Bhutan has made remarkable progress in poverty reduction through \nbroad-based and targeted poverty interventions. Both consumption-based poverty measures and \nmultidimensional  poverty  indicators  show  that  the  percentage  of  income  poverty  reduced \nsubstantially from 23.0% in 2007 to 8.2% in 2017; and multidimensional poverty from 12.7% to \n5.8% in the same period (footnote 4). However, inequality remains. The Gini coefficient, a \nmeasure of inequality, increased to 0.38 in 2017 from 0.36 in 2012. The disparity between urban \nand rural areas is marked\u2014highest in the rural district of Dagana compared to lowest in Paro, \nnear the capital. With an already high unemployment rate among the youth (15.7% in 2018), the \nCOVID-19 pandemic may increase the numbers by an estimated 11,798 employees directly \naffected in the tourism and allied industries. Given that most people participating in the informal \neconomy are women and single-ownership self-employed individuals, the impact on them is likely \nto be worse.30 The government\u2019s ECP commits to deliver timely and effective livelihood support \nto the most vulnerable segments of the population.  \n  \n29.  Gender. The program is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. Bhutan has high \nlevels of gender inequality and ranks 134th out of 142 countries on the Gender Inequality Index. \nGender inequality is high in the areas of literacy, employment, and access to finance. The literacy \nrate  for  male  adults  is  78.1%  compared  with  only  63.9%  for  female  adults. 31  Female \nunemployment remained higher than male unemployment for more than a decade, and women \nhave lower participation in regularly paid employment (18.4% compared with 33.4% for men). \nWomen still account for higher employment (63.2% against 46.4% for men) in agriculture and \nfarming enterprises,32 a sector with the least productivity and a meager share of 5.0% of the total \ncredit in the country. As of December 2017, out of the 16.1% of the population who had access \nto  credit,  36%  were  women  and  54%  were  men.33 Given  women\u2019s  greater  exposure  and \nvulnerability  to  the  impact  of  the  pandemic,  ADB\u2019s  program  will  support  key  government \nexpenditure items with significant gender equality and social inclusion elements. These include \n(i) the establishment of a National Resilience Fund with a gender, age, and disability targeting \nand monitoring system and (ii) loan deferment schemes and micro loans addressing the needs of \nbusinesses headed by women. Gender targets have been set in the design and monitoring \nframework  and  will  be  monitored,  tracked,  and  reported  during  program  implementation. \nTargeting, monitoring and evaluation system for vulnerable groups, is described in para. 26. \n \n \n30 Royal Government of Bhutan, National Statistics Bureau. 2019.

Adverse impact of  Expectations of growth rebound shattered. The country was expected to rebound from two consecutive \n \nexogenous shock  years of lackluster growth that witnessed 3.8% growth in FY2018 and 4.4% in FY 2019. During this period of \nsluggishness, growth was largely driven by the tourism sector and more broadly by services. The initially \nanticipated rebound of 6.0% in 2020 was predicated on fiscal expansion as well as robust consumption \ngrowth. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly dampened these prospects. The adverse socioeconomic \n \nimpacts are also complex.\n \nEconomic standstill and supply-chain disruptions. The detection of the first case in the country on 6 March \n2020 and the rapid escalation globally has warranted stringent preventive measures to contain the spread of \nCOVID-19. These measures have invariably resulted in either an unprecedented decline in economic activity \nor a complete standstill in the directly affected services sector, including tourism, which accounts for about \n43% of GDP. Upon detection of the first case, a restriction on the entry of foreigners by air was imposed. The \nfirst sectors to feel the shockwaves were tour operators, hotels and restaurants and transport to some degree. \nThe direct reduction in tourism earnings is estimated to amount to 30% for FY2020. Further restrictions were \nimposed on 23 March 2020 with the closure of border entry points. This has resulted in significant supply-chain \ndisruptions, especially of imports of goods and labor from India. The construction sector and the manufacturing \nsector are also affected, facing disruptions in raw material supply. Furthermore, other precautionary measures \n \nsuch as isolation are also dampening demand in the retail sector.\n \nSharp decline in growth and uncertain outlook.  The outlook is highly uncertain, with developments \nsuggesting that the pandemic is likely to be protracted. This will severely test the capacity of less developed \neconomies to absorb further shocks for a sustained period. Preliminary forecasts indicate that growth will likely \nplunge to 1.0%\u2014a 5.0 percentage point reduction from the pre-COVID-19 estimates, translating into GDP loss \nof over $176 million. These are perhaps optimistic considering that estimates do not capture the informal sector \n \nwhich is inherently large in a developing country like Bhutan.\n \nInevitable weakening of fiscal position reinforces weak demand. The directly affected services sector has \nmultiple linkages to the rest of the economy; in addition to being employment-intensive, they contribute tax \nrevenue as well as convertible currency. The immediate fiscal impacts because of foregone revenues from \ntourism royalty, visa fees, and income taxes are estimated to be around Nu887 million (about $11.8 million). \nFurther, fiscal space will shrink as a result of losses in sales taxes and corporate income taxes. Considering \n ", "Appendix 4  21 \n \nthat domestic revenue accounts for 20% of GDP, an inevitable weakening in the government\u2019s fiscal position \n \nwill reinforce weak aggregate demand.\n \nIncreasing financial sector stress. The implications on the financial sector is also apparent. The services \nsector (including tourism) accounts for 23% of total outstanding credit. With all sources of earnings frozen, \ndefaults are imminent. Other sectors such as wholesale and retail trade with an outstanding debt of 16.5% are \nlikely to come under stress as well. With the sharp recent increase in NPLs to 17.1% in March 2020 compared \n \nto 8.2% in December 2019, financial indicators are likely to further breach macro-prudential thresholds.\n \nDevelopment  plans  require  reprioritization.  The  pandemic  has  also  forced  a  reprioritization  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s development activities. Considering that growth was expected to receive an impetus from a \n51.0% elevation in capital expenditure, the supply disruptions will severely impede infrastructure expansion \n \nand other development spending, thereby depressing longer term growth prospects as well.\n \nSocial implications are deep. The economic shock from the pandemic will hit the poor and the vulnerable \nincluding women the hardest and that these groups take the longest to recover. An estimated 11,798 \nemployees in the tourism and allied sectors will be directly affected. The hotels and restaurants in particular \nhave a disproportionately large share of unskilled female employees. The informal sector also engages a large \nnumber of unskilled and vulnerable groups such as young school dropouts and migrants from rural areas. With \nan official youth unemployment rate of 16.0%, a surge in the jobless is inevitable. Likewise, combined \n \nemployment loss in the services, construction and manufacturing sectors are estimated at around 23,000. \n2. Countercyclical  Expansionary fiscal and monetary measures implemented. While the public health measures have been \nDevelopment  all encompassing, the government is also rolling out an Economic Contingency Plan to extend relief to affected \n \nExpenditures sectors and employees. To execute this, the National Resilience Fund has been established. An outlay of \nNu30,000 million (16.8% of GDP) is being coordinated to extend relief to affected sectors and individuals. To \nensure an inclusive intervention that reaches as many of the affected as possible, the government plans to \nexecute its interventions through three broad approaches: (i) social relief, (ii) fiscal and monetary measures, \nand (iii) targeted interventions involving specific activities targeting the most affected and most vulnerable \ngroups including women while simultaneously contributing to longer-term objectives. \n \nSocial Relief. A social relief package in the form of direct monthly cash transfers to affected individuals, for \nan initial period of 3 months (extendable to 12 months depending on the situation). This will involve an outlay \nof Nu21,665 million. Beneficiaries will include displaced employees, unemployed people actively seeking jobs, \nself-employed individuals in the informal sector. \n \n ", "22  Appendix 4 \n \nFiscal and Monetary Measures. The government is coordinating a set of tax interventions in the immediate \n \nterm. These include a deferment of Business and Corporate Income Taxes and sales taxes for all businesses. \nWhile  fiscal  measures  are  focused  on  relief  through  revenue  forgone  and  targeted  expenditure,  the \ngovernment\u2019s monetary measures are critical to ensure that there is adequate money in the economy for the \nbusiness entities to function. These interventions are being coordinated by the Royal Monetary Authority. They \ninclude (i) waiver of interest and a repayment deferment for 3 months for all businesses; (ii) subsidized working \ncapital at a preferential rate of 5%; (iii) extension of gestation period for ongoing projects by 3 months \n(extendable by another 3 months); (iv) working capital through the Cottage and Small Industries (CSI) Bank to \nCSIs at an interest rate of 4% for a period of 3 months (extendable by another 3 months); and (v) micro-loans \nthrough CSI Bank up to a ceiling of Nu0.5 million at an interest rate of 2% for a period of 3 months (extendable \nby another 3 months). \n \nTargeted Intervention. Beyond conventional fiscal measures, the government is also planning to execute \ntargeted projects to engage the displaced in productive activities. This is further contingent on no detection of \nlocal transmission, which would otherwise result in a complete lockdown. These targeted interventions will be \norchestrated through three domains that target absorbing the displaced in i) tourism infrastructure development \nand upskilling; ii) food security; and iii) construction. The proposed outlay for these interventions is Nu3,700 \n \nmillion.\nu \nIn terms of the health response, through a proactive approach, the government prepared the National \nPreparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19 which aims to enhance the health sector\u2019s capacity in \nsurveillance, early detection, control and prevention, response, and recovery from the COVID-19 outbreak in \nthe country. The plan is flexible and being reviewed and updated as and when required by the Technical \nAdvisory Group for COVID-19, Ministry of Health. Given the risks associated with local transmission, the \ncountry has managed to achieve its preventive objectives thus far.  \n  \n3. Pre-shock record  Macroeconomic prudence. Bhutan has traditionally demonstrated a strong commitment to macroeconomic \n \nof general sound  prudence. \nmacroeconomic   \n \nmanagement   Notwithstanding its high debt, which is also predominantly concentrated in self-liquidating hydropower, the \nconstitution mandates that all recurrent expenditure be financed through domestic resources. This has ensured \nthat  any  external  borrowing  is  channeled  towards  either  hard  infrastructure  or  economically  viable \nundertakings. The fiscal deficit over the last Five-Year Plan periods since FY1993 has been maintained below \n3%. Additional safeguards and prudential limits are reflected in the country\u2019s Public Debt Policy 2016. \n \nAccordingly, the country has never defaulted on any of its debt obligations exhibiting fiscal reliability. \n \n ", "Appendix 4  23 \n \nOn  the  monetary  front,  macro-financial  prudence  in  the  form  of  stringent  reserve  requirements  and \n \nconservative capital adequacy ratios have enabled a certain level of liquidity buffers.\n \nOn the external front, the constitution mandates a minimum reserve requirement of 12 months of essential \n \nimports. At $1.1 billion, the country comfortably meets this threshold.\n \nThe 2016 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment observed several improvements \nthrough a series of reforms undertaken such as introducing a government e-payment system, and an \n \nintegration between budget and planning.\n \nFurthermore, the government of Bhutan has placed balanced development at the center of its efforts through \nits development paradigm of Gross National Happiness. Accordingly, there is inherent alignment between the \n \nSustainable Development Goals and Bhutan\u2019s development philosophy of Gross National Happiness. \n \n4. Structural reforms  Public Health Responses. The government has taken decisive and effective responses. \n(Health Response)   \nThrough a proactive approach the National Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19 was prepared \nwith  the  objective  to  enhance the  health  sector\u2019s  capacity  in surveillance,  early  detection, control  and \nprevention, response, and recovery from the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. The plan is flexible and being \nreviewed and updated as and when required by the Technical Advisory Group for COVID-19, Ministry of \n \nHealth. \n \nDecisions for these operations are executed by the Health Emergency Management Committee, chaired by \nthe Minister of Health. \n \nBhutan recorded the highest RT-PCR testing rate in the South Asian region at 2,600 per million inhabitants as \nof 23 April 2020. Given the risks associated with local transmission, the country has managed to achieve its \npreventive  objectives  thus  far.  As  a  resource-constrained  country  with  limited  health  facilities\u2014both \ninfrastructure and personnel\u2014an outbreak could easily overwhelm the existing capacity of the system. \nMoreover, as a society characterized by extended family households, the potential contagion risks are \nextremely high. Accordingly, the highest standards of preventive measures have been pursued. This has \nincluded a publicly financed mandatory quarantine, which was initially 14 days but was extended to 21 days \non 1 April 2020. For an enhanced surveillance, all visitors from high risk countries irrespective of symptoms \nare being tested for laboratory evidence of infection with COVID-19 with effect from 3 April 2020. In the \nabsence of adequate hospital accommodation, the government has used the facilities of unutilized hotel rooms \nat negotiated rates. As of 23 April 2020, 3,725 retuned citizens have undergone quarantine. Of those, 1,843 \nare still undergoing quarantine. Seven positive cases have been confirmed, three of whom have recovered. \n ", "24  Appendix 4 \n \nThe Ministry of Health has estimated a budget requirement of Nu1.0 billion for COVID-19 prevention, \ncontainment, and treatment from April 2020 to August 2020. Furthermore, an additional Nu2.0 billion has been \nallocated for health-related response measures consistent with WHO guidelines in preparation for a worst-\n \ncase scenario.\n5. Debt  Public debt (public and publicly guaranteed debt) stands at $2.7 billion, equivalent to 117.0% of GDP \n \nSustainability in FY2019, of which domestic debt is only 8.9% of GDP in FY2019. The bulk of Bhutan\u2019s public \nexternal debt is comprised of hydropower projects (74.4%) of which mostly is financed by the \nGovernment of India with debt dominated in Indian rupees. These projects are implemented under \nan intergovernmental agreement in which India covers both financial and construction risks of the \nprojects and buys surplus electricity at a price reflecting cost plus a 15% net return. The remaining \n25.6% of non-hydropower debt is modest and owed mostly to ADB and World Bank contracted on \nhighly concessional terms. Though the debt ratio is high, the International Monetary Fund has \nassessed Bhutan\u2019s risk of debt distress as moderate because hydropower debt is essentially self-\nliquidating through electricity sale agreements. The proposed loan of $20 million will result in a \nm  arginal 0.7% increase in the public debt stock. \n6. Coordination with  Close collaboration. ADB and the IMF coordinate closely through regular dialogue and collaboration on \n \nthe IMF macroeconomic monitoring and assessments. An ADB staff from Bhutan Resident Mission participated as a \nmission member of the previous IMF on Article IV consultations, which were concluded in July 2018. The \nupdated Article IV consultation mission due in 2020 was postponed from Spring 2020 to Fall 2020. ADB has \ncoordinated with IMF and other development partners including World Bank in designing the CARES program. \n \nIMF supports ADB\u2019s proposed program and provided the assessment letter on 15 April 2020.\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CARES = COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019, GDP = Gross \nDomestic Product, IMF=International Monetary Fund, NPL = Non-performing Loans, RT-PCR = reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, WHO = World Health \nOrganization.  \nSource: ADB staff assessment.  \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Developmet Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20200427105711+08'00'", "Creator": "PDF24 Creator", "Keywords": "bhutan, covid-19, coronavirus, covid-19 pandemic, adb covid-19 response, countercyclical support facility, cares program, public health, 54183-001, adb project, terms and conditions, board approval, rrp, approved projects, recommendations of the president", "ModDate": "D:20200505133813+08'00'", "Producer": "GPL Ghostscript 9.14", "Subject": "The CARES Program will support the efforts of the Royal Government of Bhutan to stimulate the economy, protect public health, and mitigate the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the population.
