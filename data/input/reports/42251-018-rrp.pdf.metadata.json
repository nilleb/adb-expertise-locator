The SSDP is the first sector-wide, medium-term development program,  incorporating \nseveral ministries\u2019 training efforts. The SSEP will reorient the technical and vocational education \nand  training  (TVET)  system  to  focus  on  increasing  gainful  employment  of  the  graduates,  thus \ncontributing  to  human  capital  development.  It  builds  on  the  long,  extensive  experience  of  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) in supporting Sri Lanka\u2019s TVET system.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nStrategic Context \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nSri Lanka is a middle-income country with a per capita income of $2,923 in 2012, which \naims to boost to $4,000 by 2016.3 Economic growth was impressive at an average 7.5% during \n2010\u20132012, after the end of the civil conflict in 2009. These economic achievements provide a \nsignificant opportunity to invest in human capital to set the economy on a high growth trajectory \nand  avoid  the  middle-income  trap.  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  progress  in  education  is  remarkable  compared \nwith that of other countries in South Asia. However, a significant mismatch exists between the \ncompetencies of graduates and labor market demand. Sri Lankan firms identified lack of skilled \nlabor as one of the key constraints to their business.4 Youth unemployment remains very high at \n17.3%  while  the  overall  unemployment  rate  is  4.0%.5 The  skills  mismatch  has  become  even \nmore evident during the recent period of economic growth as both education and TVET systems \nhave not been able to adapt to the rapid labor market shifts resulting from the rise of the service \nsectors.  \n \n4. \nSince 1990, Sri Lanka has developed a good basis for TVET, setting the benchmark for \nSouth  Asia.  Sri  Lanka  has  an  apex  body,  the  Tertiary  and  Vocational  Education  Commission \n(TVEC),  to  regulate  the  sector;  and  a  focal  ministry,  the  Ministry  of  Youth  Affairs  and  Skills \nDevelopment (MYASD), to coordinate key TVET delivery agencies. The TVET system consists \nof  over  1,100  registered  public  and  private  providers,  which  in  2012  enrolled  around  148,000 \nstudents across 27 vocational subjects.6 Sri Lanka has a TVET teacher development university, \nUniversity  of  Vocational Technology,  which is  unique  in  South  Asia.  The government  has  also \nimplemented  a  highly  successful  apprenticeship  program.  Career  guidance  and  counseling \nservices are widely available throughout the school system and TVET provider network.  \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB  provided  a  program  preparatory  technical  assistance.

In the absence of a \n5. \nsector-wide  plan  that  is  linked  with  national  development,  past  government  investments  and \ndevelopment  partner  support  have  been  project-driven,  only  addressing  specific  issues, \nresulting in a lack of system cohesion. They also tended to focus on the supply side of the TVET \nsystem and were less successful in meeting labor market demand. Key challenges faced by the \ncurrent  TVET  system  are  (i)  inadequate  capacity  to  provide  skills  training  opportunities  for \n326,000  new  labor  market  entrants  per  year  and  a  large  backlog  of  low-skilled  in-service \nworkers,  (ii)  lack  of  middle-level  skills  training  programs  for  technicians,  (iii)  low  market \nresponsiveness and relevance indicated by a 50% TVET graduate employment rate, (iv) limited \nrange  of  training  programs  and  lack  of  flexible  delivery  options,  (v)  a  narrowly  defined  and \noutdated national vocational qualification framework that neither provides multiple pathways nor \ncovers  higher  level  skills  relevant  to  industry,  (vi)  lack  of  qualified  instructors,  and  (vii)  low \ncapacity  of  TVEC  to  assure  system  quality.  At  the  heart  of  these  issues  is  the  weak  sector \ncoordination  and  planning  capacity,  which  fails  to  align  the  training  efforts  and  financial \nresources  with  industry  demand  and  priority  economic  growth  areas.  The  role  of  the  private \nsector  has  been  limited  in  the  largely  supply-driven  system.  Current  sector  financing  is \ninadequate to overcome the challenges.7  \n \nMahinda  Chintana  emphasizes  the  need  for  a  major  reconfiguration  of  skills,  abilities, \n6. \nand competencies of young people to meet the demands of the global economy and support the \ncountry\u2019s  transition  to  a  knowledge-based  economy  (footnote  3).  In  2013,  the  government \nadopted  the  first  sector-wide,  medium-term  skills  development  program,  the  SSDP.  It  aims  to \ntransform Sri Lanka\u2019s TVET into an efficient skills development system to meet rapidly evolving \nlabor  market  demand  by  2020.  It  has  the  five  strategic  thrusts  of  improving  (i) quality; \n(ii) relevance;  (iii)  access;  (iv)  recognition  for  vocational  training;  and  (v)  supportive  policies, \nsystems, and structures. Building on past investments in \u201ctraining assets\u201d, the SSDP will focus \non  investment  in  \u201cquality\u201d  to  make  the  TVET  system  better  serve  skill  demands  for  the  next \ndecades.8 \n \nB. \n \n7. \nADB has supported Sri Lanka\u2019s TVET sector since 1982 through a series of investment \nprojects.  As  a  lead  development  partner  of  TVET  in  Sri  Lanka,  ADB\u2019s  assistance  has  been \ninstrumental  in  SSDP  formulation.  Several  recommendations  from  the  Technical  Education \nDevelopment  Project,  2006\u20132011  completion  report  are  incorporated  in  the  SSDP  design. 9 \nSupporting  the  SSDP,  the  proposed  SSEP  will  contribute  to  the  government\u2019s  integrated \napproach  to  human  capital  development  alongside  the  Education  Sector  Development \nFramework  and  Program,  which  is  supported  by  ADB\u2019s  Education  Sector  Development \nProgram.10 The SSEP is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 and \nis included in the Sri Lanka country operations business plan, 2013\u20132015. \n\nProgram Rationale \n\n                                                \n7  Summary Sector Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n8  Government  of  Sri  Lanka,  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Planning.

The \nrecommendations  include  (i)  fundamental  institutional  reform,  (ii)  rationalization  of  teacher  recruitment  and \ncompensation, (iii) more autonomy to college heads, (iv) improvement of the management information system and \nlabor market information system, (v) gender and social equity, and (vi) rationalization of training facilities.  \n\n10 ADB.  2013.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Results-Based \nLoans to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Education Sector Development Program.  Manila. \nThe  Education  Sector  Development  Program  supports  the  government\u2019s  efforts  in  improving  labor  market \nrelevance of secondary  education  by strengthening science,  technology,  and commerce  streams.  The  SSDP  will \ncreate pathways for the secondary school leavers and graduates to transit to gainful employment.  \n\n\fADB\u2019s  results-based  lending  (RBL)  is  the  most  suitable  modality  primarily  because  the \n8. \nSSDP aims at a fundamental shift in sector orientation\u2014from the traditional, input-driven model \nto \u201cemployment results.\u201d The SSDP envisages sector-wide reforms involving several institutions \nto improve the TVET system as a whole and in a sustainable manner, rather than focusing on \nspecific  aspects  or  on  one  or two  institutions  only,  which was the case  in previous  investment \nprojects. Such sector-wide reforms would be better achieved through stronger accountability for \nresults than by focusing only on transactions. RBL also uses and strengthens country systems \nand  institutional  capacity,  which  are  key  to  building  a  market-responsive,  dynamic  TVET \nsystem.  ADB\u2019s  due  diligence  assessments  provide  reasonable  assurance  for  effective \nachievement of results through RBL, with measures to strengthen the country systems.  \n \n9. \nThe  RBL  approach  will  enhance  the  predictability  and  amount  of  sector  financing  by \nmotivating  the  government  to  adopt  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework  whereby  other \ndevelopment partners can participate with a harmonized approach. The World Bank will provide \nparallel financing for SSDP implementation using its results-based financing mechanism, similar \nto  RBL.  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  coordinated  due  diligence  assessments,  harmonized  key \ndisbursement-linked  indicators  (DLIs)  to  support  the  common  results  framework  of  the  SSDP, \nand  will  conduct  joint  reviews  during  implementation.  Other  bilateral  partners  also  expressed \nstrong support to the common sector results framework.11  \n \nC. \n \n10. \nof both programs are summarized in Table 1.12  \n \n\nThe SSEP will support the SSDP by covering activities from 2014 to 2016.

DLI  7  and  9  are  fully  harmonized.  German  development  cooperation  through  GIZ  supports  the  whole \nprogram by providing long- and short-term technical experts, and Export-Import Bank of Korea supports output 3 \nby upgrading and rebuilding two colleges of technology for middle-level training in information technology and light \nengineering.  \n\n12 The  SSEP  will  not  cover  high-value  contracts  or  activities  that  would  be  classified  as  category  A  under  ADB\u2019s \n\nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fProgram Results \n\nD. \n \n11. \nThe  impact  of  the  SSEP  will  be  increased  employability  of  the  Sri  Lankan  workforce, \nparticularly  the  youth.  The  outcome  will  be  a  market-responsive  and  inclusive  TVET  system. \nThe  outputs  of  the  SSEP  are  selected  from  the  SSDP\u2019s  key  performance  indicators.  Certain \noutput  targets  are  further  developed  into  annual  DLIs,  achievement  of  which  will  set  the \nprogressive  steps  toward  SSEP  outcome  target  achievement.  Some  output  targets,  which  are \nalso important for outcome achievement but difficult to link to disbursement, are included in the \nprogram action plan (PAP).13 The employment rate of TVET graduates is included to measure \nSSEP outcome achievement (DLI 1). The outputs are summarized below:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nOutput 1: Improved quality of TVET provision. This output will strengthen the \nquality assurance system covering both public and private TVET providers (DLI 2, \nPAP  1.2),  improve  articulation  of  competencies  within  the  national  vocational \nqualification  framework  for  multiple,  flexible  pathways  (PAP  1.3),  and  improve \ntrainee  assessment  for  consistency  across  training  providers  (PAP  1.4).  The \ncapacity  of  TVEC  as  sector  regulator  and  quality  assurance  body  will  be \nstrengthened  to  ensure  transparency  and  reliability  of  TVET  certificates  to \nemployers  and  students.  A  comprehensive  vocational  teacher  development \npolicy  and  plan  will  ensure  adequate  supply  of  qualified  instructors,  assessors, \nand managers through in-service training, revised recruitment requirements, and \na performance allowance scheme (DLI 3).  \n \nOutput 2: Enhanced industry partnership for TVET planning and provision. \nThis  output  will  increase  private  sector  participation  in  TVET  planning  and \nprovision.  Skills  gap  analyses  for  four  priority  sectors  will  be  carried  out  for \nindustry validation to inform the sector training plans (DLI 4, PAP 1.6 and 1.8).14 \nAt  least  2,000  trainees  will  be  trained  through  a  purchasing  model,  using  an \nemployment-linked training agreement (DLI 5).15 At least three university colleges \nwill be established through public\u2013private partnership (DLI 5, PAP 1.5).16  \n\nOutput 3: Increased participation and improved equity in TVET. This output \nwill  increase  the  number  of  students  enrolled  in  TVET  programs  to  at  least \n172,000  (DLI  6),  and  support  at  least  18,000  students  with  a  stipend  program \ntargeting  school  leavers,  women,  and  disadvantaged  groups  for  training  in \nemerging and critical skills gap areas (PAP 1.7). Existing workforce skills will be \nupgraded  by  offering  flexible  training  delivery  mechanisms  and  recognition  of \nprior  learning  (PAP  1.4).  People  in  the  underserved  areas  will  have  increased \naccess to training facilities through selected implementing agencies (PAP 1.8). A \nsector-wide  gender  and  social  equity  framework  will  be  developed  to  guide \noverall SSDP implementation (PAP 6).  \n\n \n                                                \n13 Program Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 These include (i) construction, (ii) tourism and hospitality, (iii) information technology, and (iv) light engineering and \n\nmanufacturing, identified in the consultation process of ADB\u2019s project preparatory technical assistance.  \n\n15 Through  the  purchasing  model,  the  TVET  system  can  flexibly  and  quickly  respond  to  skills  gaps  by  using \nperformance-based  contracts  with  a  public  or  private  provider,  whichever  is  capable  and  ready  to  deliver  the \nresults. The employment-linked training agreement with a potential employer will tie training to job placement and \ncan include cost sharing between government and employer.  \n\n16 MYASD  will  enter  into  a  performance-based,  3-year  agreement  with  private  sector  entities  to  develop  skilled \nworkers  in priority  sectors.  The  agreement  will  set  the  roles,  responsibilities of,  and  resources  to be  provided by \ngovernment and a private sector entity, with clearly set performance targets.    \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(iv) \n\nOutput  4:  Improved  TVET  sector  management  to  implement  policy, \ninstitutional,  and  operational  reforms.  This  output  will  strengthen  sector \nmanagement and coordination capacity for SSDP implementation by establishing \na  high-level  interministerial  committee  and  the  Sector  Development  Division \n(SDD)  in  MYASD  (DLI  8,  PAP  1.1,  1.10).  A  TVET  system  capacity  utilization \nassessment  will  reveal  underused  training  facilities  and  service  gaps,  and \ndevelop  a  rationalization  plan  (PAP  1.8).  It  will  also  pilot  performance-based \nfinancing for public training providers (DLI 7). This output will also improve sector \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  (PAP  5),  planning  and  budgeting  (DLI  9,  PAP \n1.9), fiduciary capacity (DLI 8, PAP 2 and 3), and safeguards (PAP 4).  \n\nDisbursement  allocation  is  summarized  in  Table  2.

The government will provide $185 million (47.9%) and contribution \nfrom  development  partners  is  expected  to  be  $201.4  million  (51.1%).  The  government  has \nrequested  (i)  a  loan  of  $50  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  and  (ii)  a  loan  in \nvarious  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR32,600,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help \nfinance the SSEP. The loan terms and conditions are set out in para. 30. The government may \nrequest  ADB  to  provide  additional  financing  upon  satisfactory  implementation  of  the  SSEP,  to \nbridge any financing gap from 2017 through 2020.

ADB loans will be disbursed over 3 years, subject to the \nachievement and verification of the agreed DLIs. The initial disbursement will be after the loan \neffectiveness and verification of achievement of prior results. Financing for prior results will be \nprovided  to  support  government  actions  that  are  essential  to  initiate  sector  reform,  such  as \n(i) approval  of  the  amendment  to  the  Tertiary  and  Vocational  Education  Commission  Act  to \nstrengthen  the  quality  assurance  system,  (ii)  signing  of  two  memorandums  of  understanding \nwith  private  sector  institutions  to  initiate  private  sector  engagement  in  TVET  provision,  and \n(iii) approval of cadre positions for the SDD to strengthen sector coordination and management. \nThe  subsequent  disbursements  will  be  made  annually  after  achievement  of  the corresponding \nDLIs.  MYASD  will  submit  a  withdrawal  application  along  with  the  evidence  verifying  the \nachievement  of  the  DLIs  and  unaudited  financial  statements  for  the  period  concerned.  Any \namounts not disbursed for unmet DLIs will be disbursed once they have been achieved.

The  loan \nproceeds will be disbursed to the government\u2019s consolidated fund. \n \nF. \n \n17. \nA PAP has been developed to complement the DLI matrix (footnote 13). It includes key \nactions  in  specific  technical  areas,  fiduciary  management,  M&E,  safeguards,  and  gender  and \nsocial equity to ensure that achievement of key SSEP results strengthen the country systems, \nthus  making  the  program  results  more  sustainable.  As  the  country  systems  are  assessed  as \nrobust at policy and regulatory levels, the PAP will focus on implementation capacity.  \n \nG. \n \n18.  MYASD  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  SSEP.  MYASD,  the  Department  of \nTechnical  Education  and  Training,  and  six  semi-autonomous  institutions  under  MYASD  are \nselected  as  initial  implementing  agencies.18 Other  agencies  under  the  SSDP  will  be  added  as \nimplementing  agencies  through  a  formal  agreement  with  MYASD,  once  a  fiduciary  capacity \nassessment  is  completed and measures to  mitigate risks,  if  any,  are identified. The  SSEP  will \nbe implemented using the existing country systems with selective enhancements as described \nin  the  PAP.  To  boost  the  capacity  of  MYASD  in  coordinating  and managing  the  TVET  sector, \nthe  SDD  was  established  in  2013.  It  will  (i)  coordinate  and  support  implementing  agencies  to \nplan, implement, and monitor SSDP activities; (ii) initiate implementation of new initiatives under \nthe  SSDP;  and (iii)  undertake timely  M&E  and  reporting  of  SSDP  activities,  including  DLI  and \nPAP  achievements.  A  high-level  interministerial committee  consisting  of key ministries  in  skills \ndevelopment will be established to coordinate and monitor SSDP implementation.19 The Ministry \nof Finance and Planning will ensure adequate budget appropriation and smooth fund flow.  \n \n19. \nADB  will  support  the  government  in  SSDP  implementation  through  ongoing  capacity \ndevelopment  technical  assistance.20 The  assistance  provides  technical  inputs  to  help  the  SDD \nachieve the annual DLIs and implement the PAP, complementing other development partners\u2019 \ntechnical assistance.21 It will also support independent verification of DLIs and annual fiduciary \nreviews as described in the DLI verification protocol. \n \n\nIII. \n\nSUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n\nProgram Technical Assessments \n\n \nA. \n \n20. \nSeveral  sector  assessments  concluded  that  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  TVET  system  needs  to \n(i) improve  quality  and  relevance  to  the  job  market  at  home  and  abroad;  (ii)  step  up  private \nsector  engagement;  (iii)  invest  in  upgrading  and  expanding  qualified  instructors;  (iv)  introduce \nmore  flexible  approaches  to  vocational  qualification  and  training  delivery;  (v)  streamline \ninstitutional  arrangements;  (vi)  improve  performance  management  through  better  planning, \n\n                                                \n18 The semi-autonomous institutions are TVEC, Vocational Training Authority, National Apprenticeship and Industrial \nTraining  Authority,  University  of  Vocational  Technology,  National  Institute  of  Fisheries  and  Nautical  Engineering, \nand National Youth Services Council. \n\n19 Chaired by  the Treasury secretary, the committee  will include  ministries involved in the SSDP. Two departments \n(national planning, and project management and monitoring) of the Ministry of Finance and Planning will support \nthe committee activities.  \n\n20 ADB.  2012.

The DLIs are carefully selected, prioritized, and \nsequenced to ensure that the government achieves reform results in the most crucial areas.  \n \n21. \nThe implementation planning and expenditure framework requires further strengthening \nthrough  at  least  two  to  three  iterations  of  the  annual  planning  and  budgeting  exercise.  The \nSSDP  is  the  first  medium-term  sector  development  program  that  the  government  undertook, \nand it is not yet fully incorporated into the regular work program and budget. The SSDP should \nbe fully integrated into MYASD\u2019s regular work program. A technical action is included as a DLI \nto  improve  5-year  strategic  planning,  3-year  rolling  budgeting,  and  annual  work  planning  at \nimplementing agencies, to fully incorporate the SSDP into their regular programs over the next \nfew  years.  To  strengthen  coordination  between  budget  planning  and  expenditures  and  to \nachieve program results, performance partnership agreements between the Ministry of Finance \nand Planning and MYASD, and between MYASD and its departments and agencies, will specify \nperformance targets and related budget amounts to support implementation.  \n \n22. \nA  study  in  Sri  Lanka  estimated  an  average  wage  premium  of  17%  for  TVET,  which \nindicates a large income gain from TVET for individuals (footnote 4). SSDP enrollment targets, \ngraduation and employment, the average wage premium, and the SSDP expenditure framework \nwere used to compute the incremental benefits and costs. The economic analysis resulted in a \nsound internal economic rate of return of 15.3%. A sensitivity analysis revealed that varying the \nwage  premium  affects  the  return  on  investment  more  than  other  variables,  implying  that \nelevating the overall skills profile of the workforce would bring a higher return on investment.  \n \n23. \nCurrently,  a  large  number  of  women  are  enrolled  for  training  in  traditionally  female \noccupations,  but  women\u2019s  participation  is  low  in technology-related  courses that  would lead to \nhigher-paying  jobs.  Women\u2019s  labor  force  participation  is  the  lowest  among  South  Asian \ncountries, and the unemployment rate is high among young, educated women. The SSEP aims \nto increase women\u2019s participation in TVET and improve their employment rate, especially in the \nfour  priority  sectors  (footnote  14).  The  government  is  committed  to  developing  a  system-wide \ngender and social equity framework and a targeted stipend program. Specific targets for women \nin employment, enrollment, stipend program, and instructor training are set in the PAP.   \n \nB. \n \n24.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  systems.  An  M&E  system  assessment  was  done  for \nMYASD  and  other  implementing  agencies.  The  central  system  is  robust,  but  agency  level \nsystems are fragmented and inconsistent and therefore need to be consolidated. The SSEP will \nimprove and consolidate the systems for timely and efficient monitoring and reporting. The SDD \nwill be responsible for performance monitoring against a set of key performance indicators that \nare  defined  within  the  SSEP,  including  DLIs  and  PAP  targets.  An  M&E  unit  at  each \nimplementing agency will collaborate with the SDD. The SDD will develop a new, computerized \nmanagement information system for preparing quarterly and annual sector performance reports \nthat  will  outline  progress  against  the  SSEP  targets.  This  new  system  will  be  housed  within \nTVEC, and implementing agencies will be able to access it online.  \n\nProgram Systems Assessments \n\n                                                \n22 Government  of  Korea,  Ministry  of  Strategy  and  Finance.  2012.

The  program  will  use  the  country  public  finance  management \nsystem  and,  as  per  the  RBL  policy,  the  strength  of  country  systems  has  been  assessed  to \ndetermine  whether  additional  assurances  and/or  institutional  capacity-building  measures  are \nrequired.  The  assessment  reviewed  the  government\u2019s  public  finance  management  system, \nincluding  the  Auditor  General\u2019s  Department  and  specific  agencies.  The  assessment  found \nweaknesses  in  predictability  of  budget  allocation  and  timeliness  of  budget  release.  MYASD\u2019s \nabsorption  capacity,  internal  control,  accounting  and  financial  reporting,  and  external  audits \nwere  rated  as  substantial  risks.  Key  mitigating  measures  included  as  DLIs  are  (i)  adequate \nallocation  of  budget  and  spending  of funds  and (ii) strengthening  of  the financial  management \ncapacity  of  MYASD,  especially  in  planning,  budgeting,  internal  control,  and financial  reporting. \nADB  will  conduct  periodic  external  fiduciary  reviews  to  spot-check  sample  procurements  and \nreview  follow-up  of  audit  recommendations  and  compliance  with  internal  controls.  A  detailed \nStatement  of  Audit  Needs  was  agreed  with  the  Auditor  General\u2019s  Department  and  MYASD  to \nensure timely financial reporting in accordance with Sri Lankan accounting standards.  \n \nA procurement system assessment was carried out using ADB\u2019s Procurement Capacity \n26. \nAssessment  and  Procurement  Review  for  Effective  Implementation  questionnaires.  Sri  Lanka \nhas  a  functional  public  procurement  system  in  line  with  comprehensive  national  procurement \nand  consultant  selection  guidelines  that  largely  follow  good  practices.  Most  implementing \nagencies have reasonable capacity for the current volume of work. Anticipating the increase in \nprocurement activities under the SSEP, procurement capacity needs to be strengthened and the \nfollowing  areas  need  to  be  improved:  (i)  procurement  planning  and  compliance  monitoring, \n(ii) document  management  and  retrieval  systems,  (iii)  monitoring  and  tracking  of  contractual \nperformances, and (iv) complaints-handling mechanism. Mitigating measures  are included in a \nDLI (e.g., a staffing and training plan and follow-up of annual audit findings) and the PAP. The \nGuidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities in  Results-\nBased Lending for Programs were explained to and discussed with the government.23 \n \n27. \nSafeguard  systems.  The  SSEP  will  entail  upgrading  and  refurbishing  training  centers \nand  constructing  some  new  buildings  in  already  existing  premises  or  on  government-owned \nland,  avoiding  new  land  acquisition  and  sensitive  areas.  A  program  safeguard  system \ninvoluntary \nassessment  confirmed \nresettlement (C), and indigenous peoples (C) and highlighted the capacity gap in complying with \nsafeguard requirements, especially at training centers. MYASD will adopt an environmental and \nsocial  management  framework  for  the  SSEP.  MYASD  will  develop  a  detailed  screening \nchecklist and train focal officers from each implementing agency on the required procedures in \nthe  framework  to  ensure  that  (i)  any  category  A  activities  are  excluded  from  the  program  and \n(ii) no activities involving involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples issues will be included. \nRecommendations from the assessment are in the PAP (e.g., a designated safeguard officer at \nthe SDD to provide support and monitor framework implementation).  \n \nC. \n \n28.
