I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based loan and (ii) a proposed technical assistance (TA) loan, both to the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR), for subprogram 2 of the Second Private Sector and Small and \nMedium-Sized Enterprises Development Program (PSME2).1  \n \n2.  Subprogram 2 of the PSME2 and the TA loan support the government's strategy to \ndevelop and promote small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and undertake SME trade-\nrelated  reforms  to  help  achieve  sustained  and  inclusive  economic  growth\u2014a  strategy \nembedded in the Seventh National Socio-Economic Development Plan (NSEDP7), 2011\u20132015. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The PSME2 cluster, which the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \napproved in October 2011, comprises two subprograms implemented from 2009 to 2013.2 \nSubprogram 1 was approved in the macroeconomic context of the resources boom and the \nimportance of developing the private sector, especially SMEs, to be more competitive.3 Since \n2011, gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the Lao PDR has been steady, averaging 7.7% \nfrom 2010 to 2012.4  Economic activity remained strong in 2011 and 2012 despite monetary and \nfiscal  tightening  and  global  uncertainty  in  major  export  markets.  Industry,  mainly  led  by \nresources,  recorded  the  highest  growth  rate  in  2012,  at  13.8%,  as  foreign  investment  in \nhydropower and mining proved to be key engines of growth. Services grew at 8.0% while \nagriculture\u2019s contribution to annual real growth was the lowest at 2.5%,5 which is consistent with \nthe steady decline of agriculture\u2019s share of GDP, from 61.2% in 1990 to 30.3% by 2010. This \npattern of structural change can be expected as an economy grows and develops; resources \nmove  from  low-productivity  activities  in  subsistence  agriculture  and  traditional  services  to \nhigher-productivity activities in industry and modern services.6  As a result of this steady growth, \nthe proportion of the population living below the poverty line dropped from 33.9% in 2008 to \n27.6% in 2012.   \n \n4.  The boom in resources has transformed the economy over the past 20 years and will \ncontinue to do so in the immediate future. The extent of the transformation and how it will affect \nthe country\u2019s economy will depend on (i) the magnitude, duration, and cyclical pattern of the \nmineral resources boom; (ii) the extent to which the resource revenue flows appreciate the real \nkip exchange rate and how that exchange rate appreciation transmits to the tradable goods \nsector; and (iii) what kind of policies the government implements to promote competitiveness in \nthe non-resource sectors, especially the SME subsector.  \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Program Cluster, \nand Loan and Grant for Subprogram 1, to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Second Private Sector and \nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development Program. Manila. \n3  SMEs in the Lao PDR are defined as enterprises with an annual average number of employees not exceeding 99 \nor total assets not exceeding KN1,200,000,000 or an annual turnover not exceeding KN1,000,000,000. \n4  GDP growth was 7.5% in 2010, 7.8% in 2011, and 7.9% in 2012 based on ADB. 2013. Asian Development Bank & \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic Fact Sheet. Manila. \n5  ADB. 2013. Basic 2013 Statistics. Manila.  \n6  K. Bird and S. Ismail. 2013. Lao PDR Assessment, Strategy and Road Map, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises. \nManila: ADB.  \n ", "2 \n5.  Strengthening small and medium-sized enterprises. According to government data, \n99% of economic enterprises in the Lao PDR are SMEs. Strengthening the competitiveness of \nSMEs is important for two main reasons\u2014the transitory nature of the resources boom and the \ncountry's  accession  to  the World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  in  February  2013.  While  the \nresources sector contributes significantly to exports and fiscal revenue, this is expected to \ndecline in the medium term. Non-resource sectors will thus need to expand their contribution to \nbe able to play a pivotal role in employment generation and in making the economic growth of \nthe country both sustainable and inclusive. Second, while WTO membership is a substantial \nachievement that will help integrate the Lao PDR further into the world economy, such trade \nexposure can affect industries differently; some will expand due to new opportunities while \nothers will have to undergo substantial restructuring to survive and prosper. Hence, assisting \nstructural adjustment so that SMEs can benefit from the new opportunities is essential. In \naddition, SMEs also face constraints such as inefficient regulations, poor access to services and \nfinance, non-transparent trade policies which results in low utilization of tariff preferences.  \n \n6.  The  government  recognizes  the  importance  of  developing  SMEs\u2014two  of  the  main \ntargets of enterprise development in the NSEDP7 are: (i) to have 13% annual growth in the \nSME subsector; and (ii) to have 85% of workers in business overall engaged by SMEs.7 The \nNSEDP7  is  further  supported  by  the  national  SME  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015.  ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 is also consistent with government priorities. Private \nsector development is one of the thematic areas of the strategy, which states that ADB will \ncontinue to promote a stronger enabling  environment for the private sector. Improving the \nbusiness environment for SMEs will naturally result in expansion of the SME subsector within \nthe formal sector, and ultimately a more competitive and efficient private sector. \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s support. ADB has extensive experience in SME and private sector development \nin the Lao PDR. The first Private Sector and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development \nProgram was implemented from 2006 to 2009.8  In that program, the government implemented \nreforms aimed at reducing the cost of doing business in the Lao PDR, including enactment of \nthe Law on Enterprises and establishment of enterprise registry offices; starting the process for \nregulatory reform; and advancing trade policy reforms. ADB\u2019s completion report rated the first \nprogram as successful overall.9 The country assistance performance evaluation prepared by the \nIndependent Evaluation Department concluded that ADB\u2019s programs in the SME subsector \nwere highly relevant, highly efficient, effective in achieving intended outcomes, and likely to be \nsustainable.10 This  provided  strong  rationale  for  ADB\u2019s  continued  involvement  through  the \nPSME2. ADB also works closely with other development partners in developing the sector by \ncoordinating through the trade and private sector working group.11 \n \n8.  Achievements  of  subprogram  1. Under subprogram 1 of the PSME2, which ADB \nfinanced in 2011 ($15 million), the government carried out reforms through: (i) implementation of \n                                                \n7  Government of the Lao PDR. 2011.

", "3 \nan  SME  policy  and  access  to  services;  (ii)  promotion  of  regulatory  efficiency;  and  (iii) \nstrengthening of the trade policy to support SME growth. Some tangible achievements include: \n(i) national rollout of a fully web-based enterprise registry system in the provinces, development \nof a web-based Credit Information Bureau (CIB-online), (ii) establishment of the regulatory \nimpact assessment (RIA) pilot unit in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOIC); and \n(iii) focus  on  trade  policy  measures  that  directly  benefit  SMEs,  including  preparation  of  a \ngeographical indication strategy and passing of decrees on rules of origin and import and export \nof goods consistent with WTO requirements.  \n \n9.  Lessons. Notwithstanding the achievements above, lessons from subprogram 1 include \nthe need for additional capacity building to mainstream reforms and make them sustainable, \nand a more direct and comprehensive approach to gender mainstreaming to promote women \nentrepreneurs.  First,  in  subprogram  1,  capacity  building  and  implementation  support  were \nprovided  through  TA  and  the  government\u2019s  budget  allocation. While  this  was  sufficient  to \ncomplete the reforms for subprogram 2, institutionalizing them and making them sustainable \nrequires more resources. Second, policy measures that promoted women entrepreneurs were \nlimited to only the first output (implementation of SME policy and access to services). These \nlessons have been incorporated in the design of subprogram 2. In addition to the government\u2019s \nbudget allocation, subprogram 2 includes a TA loan with more resources for capacity building to \nhelp make the reforms sustainable. This reflects government's commitment to the sector and to \nmeet all performance targets in the DMF including those with slow progress. Subprogram 2 also \nincludes policy measures to promote women entrepreneurs that cover all outputs.  \n \n10.  Subprogram 2. The proposed modality combines a policy-based loan designed to build \non government reforms under subprogram 1, and a TA loan to build capacities and make the \ncompleted reforms sustainable. The implementation period for the policy-based loan is October \n2011\u2013September 2013 and the implementation period for the TA is January 2014\u2013December \n2017. A post-program partnership framework (P3F) has also been agreed with the government, \nwhich  provides  an  opportunity  for  ADB  to  continue  working  with  the  government  in  SME \ndevelopment to achieve the medium-term direction and expected results. The policy actions in \nthe policy matrix cover both supply- and demand-side reforms. On the supply side, subprogram \n2 reforms inefficient regulations that hinder SME growth and competitiveness through the RIA \nsystem introduced by ADB. On the demand side, subprogram 2 focuses on improving access to \nservices and finance, and dissemination of trade-related information to help SMEs benefit from \ntrade  policies.  Subprogram  2  will  be  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020  focus  on  gender \nempowerment  and  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  by  including  gender-\nresponsive measures in the policy matrix and using gender-related indicators in the DMF.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact of the program will be expansion of SMEs in the formal sector by 100% from \nthe 2009 baseline. This is important, as registration allows SMEs to get access to services such \nas bank loans. In 2009, about 45,000 enterprises were registered and by the end of 2012, this \nnumber had increased to 91,077. The performance target for this impact has thus been reached \n3 years ahead of the timeline set in the DMF. The outcome of the program will be a more \nconducive business environment for SMEs based on two indicators in the DMF. The updated \nDMF (Appendix 1) contains an additional column with figures for 2012.  \n \n \n ", "4 \nC.  Outputs  \n \n12.  Subprogram 2 continues to support the government\u2019s efforts to develop the private \nsector and SMEs through: (i) implementation of an SME policy that widens SMEs\u2019 access to \nservices; (ii) improvement of regulatory efficiency; and (iii) strengthening of the trade policy to \nsupport SME development. When subprogram 1 was approved in 2011, eight triggers were set \nfor subprogram 2. An additional trigger was added in 2012. The nine triggers are reinforced by \n10 other accomplishments that are considered policy measures.  \n \n13.  Out of the original eight triggers, three exceeded expectations, four were completed as \nanticipated, and one was refined to reflect practical realities and the government\u2019s priorities. The \ntrigger  related  to  setting  up  a  pilot  online  enterprise  registry  in  one  province  was  refined \nbecause internet infrastructure in the provinces is not sufficiently developed to support online \nregistration. Instead, the government has decided to decentralize enterprise registration by \nsetting  up  registry  offices  in  51  districts,  which  will  achieve  the  same  objective  as  online \nregistration. Realization of an online registry will take more time and, as a first step, ADB helped \nthe government develop an appropriate strategy. The strategy looked at ways to overcome \ninadequate internet access in some provinces and develop an online payment system.12 \n \n1.  Output 1: Implementation of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Policy that \nWidens Access to Services \n \n14.  Coordination of policy development. SME development, which cuts across several \nline ministries, requires an anchor document as a reference point to formulate strategies and \nplan activities. The SME Development Plan 2011\u20132015 defines targets and measures and is \nincorporated in the government-approved NSEDP7. Key features of the plan include promoting \nwomen entrepreneurs and RIA to improve the business environment for SMEs. Approval of the \nplan as part of the NSEDP7, rather than as a standalone document, reinforces coordination of \nSME development with the government\u2019s overall priorities. In addition, the SME monitoring unit \ncontinues to publish updates on the implementation of the SME Development Plan and, as of \n2013, all activities are on track.  \n \n15.  To further strengthen SMEs, government also enacted the SME Law. It upgraded the \nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprise Promotion and Development Office to a department of \nMOIC with enhanced responsibilities such as promoting and supporting the development of \nwomen  entrepreneurs.  Effective  policymaking  should  always  include  engagement  with  the \nprivate  sector.  The  government  continues  to  do  so  through  the  Provincial  Public\u2013Private \nDialogue (P3D) Forum. The P3D in Luang Prabang was institutionalized and the Ministry of \nPlanning and Investment initiated phase 3 of the P3D in expanding it into Xiengkhouang. The \nP3D is coordinated through the Lao National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  \n \n16.  Wider  access  to  business  services  and  finance. SMEs\u2019 access to services and \nfinance is predicated on registration. The government has made great strides in simplifying \nenterprise  registration.  By  2011,  70,000  enterprises  had  registered,  compared  with  about \n35,000 in 2008. During implementation of subprogram 2, and by the end of 2012, the number of \nenterprises registered exceeded 91,000. Decentralizing registration offices into the provinces \nhas  also  had  a  positive  impact  on  women  entrepreneurs\u2014more  than  50%  of  registered \nindividual enterprises are owned by women. Despite this success, government is committed to \n                                                \n12 Policy matrix (Appendix 4); Assessment of Original Triggers (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). ", "5 \nfurther  progress.  The  Department  of  Enterprise  Registration  and  Management,  with  ADB \nsupport, undertook a thorough review of the registration system and based on the findings will \nconsider recommendations for: (i) decentralizing registry offices into districts; (ii) ensuring their \nfinancial sustainability; and (iii) reaching out to women entrepreneurs.  \n \n17.  Access to finance remains a problem. The GIZ Enterprise Survey of 2011 reported that \n26.6% of enterprises cited lack of capital as a \u201cvery big\u201d problem. When broken down by size, \n57% of micro businesses and 45% of small businesses said that lack of capital is a significant \nconstraint.13 In response, the government: (i) developed and launched  a web-based credit \ninformation system (CIB-online); and (ii) approved the implementing decree for the Secured \nTransaction Law. Under subprogram 2, CIB-online has been made fully operational. All banks \nare required to provide credit information of customers to the online system and all queries for \ncredit information now occur through the online system. As of March 2013, CIB-online received \nan average of over 3,000 queries per month. Further, all new loans above KN50 million require \ncredit reports. The government also made progress in the secured transaction registry. The \nMinistry of Finance agreed to host the registry and assigned a team to implement it. Apart from \nwidening access to finance, the government also recognizes the need for SMEs to access \nbusiness development services, and for these services to be led by the private sector for the \nprivate  sector.  According  to  the  GIZ  survey,  only  7.9%  of  enterprises  surveyed  received \nbusiness development services from the private sector. In subprogram 2, the Department of \nSME Promotion launched the network of service providers that had been piloted in subprogram \n1. It has been expanded to cover services like accounting, marketing, and business advice. The \nnetwork also facilitates vocational training for women entrepreneurs.  \n \n2.  Output 2: Promoting Regulatory Efficiency \n \n18.  One of the most effective ways to enhance the competitiveness of SMEs is to promote \nregulatory efficiency so that regulations do not unnecessarily burden SMEs.14 The objective of \nthe RIA process introduced by ADB in 2010 is to provide decision makers in the government \nwith information on the impact of regulations on the private sector. During  subprogram 2, \ngovernment accomplishments in mainstreaming the RIA system have exceeded initial targets. \nMost importantly, the government has passed the Law on Making Legislation, which makes \nimpact assessment mandatory for all lawmaking authorities. This is critical as it embeds the RIA \nprocess  into  national  legislation.  The  government  also  realizes  that  to  implement  this  law \neffectively, capacities have to be built in line ministries. The pilot unit in MOIC has led by \nexample and begun implementing its RIA work plan for capacity building by completing two \npreliminary impact assessments on rice and timber exports. MOIC has published both impact \nassessments  to  solicit  feedback  from  the  private  sector  before  they  are  finalized.  The \ngovernment, with the support of ADB, has set up additional RIA units in the ministries of finance, \njustice, and planning and investment. A unit was also set up in the National Assembly, which \nneeds to understand the process since it will deliberate on legislation that includes impact \nassessments prepared by line ministries.   \n \n19.  With  impact  assessments  being  made  mandatory  and  now  covering  several  line \nministries, it is important that the RIA interministerial task force (set up under subprogram 1 to \ncoordinate RIA implementation) is strengthened. During subprogram 2, government has taken \nconcrete steps by appointing representatives from all RIA units, including representatives from \n                                                \n13 GIZ. 2012. Enterprise Survey 2011. Vientiane.  \n14 ADB\u2019s Red Tape Study estimates that firms on average incur $483 annually to comply with the three most common \nlicenses. Overall, it costs the business community (those complying) $36 million to comply with the three licenses. ", "6 \nthe Lao Chamber of Commerce and the National Assembly, to be part of the task force, and \nappointing a secretariat to serve the task force. Such a mechanism will allow more effective \ndeliberation  and  sharing  of  information  and  experience  between  the  RIA  units.  Another \nsignificant  achievement  in  promoting  regulatory  efficiency  is  that  the  government  has \nimplemented the prime ministerial decree on the Investment Promotion Law by setting up a one-\nstop service center in the Ministry of Planning and Investment that is now fully operational. That \nthe  RIA  unit  in  this  ministry  has  begun  evaluating  the  one-stop  service  center  is  further \ndemonstration of the government\u2019s ownership of the RIA process.  \n \n3.  Output 3: Strengthening the Trade Policy to Support Small and Medium-\nSized Enterprise Development \n \n20.  Growth  from  trade.  Research,  including  that  published  by  ADB,  shows  that  the \nutilization rates for tariff preferences among SMEs are very low.15 One key reason is SMEs\u2019 lack \nof information on ways to benefit from preferential trade agreements. In view of the Lao PDR\u2019s \naccession to the WTO in February 2013, information dissemination becomes more critical so \nthat SMEs can compete within the country\u2019s more open economy. To respond to the needs of \nthe SMEs, government has undertaken two important reforms under subprogram 2. First, MOIC \n(through  its  Foreign  Trade  and  Policy  Department)  drafted  trade  integration  dissemination \nguidelines to inform SMEs on ways to utilize preferences. The guidelines include outreach \nactivities  for  the  business  community,  particularly  women  entrepreneurs.  Second,  the \ngovernment (through the Ministry of Science and Technology) issued the Intellectual Property \nLaw  and  implementing  regulations  on  geographical  indications  consistent  with  WTO \nprocedures, which set the stage for SMEs to register their products locally via the geographical \nindication registration framework. In most cases, these registrations have resulted in premium \npricing in international markets, which benefits SMEs along the whole value chain.  \n \n21.  Greater transparency. Under subprogram 2, the government took three steps toward \ngreater  transparency  in  its  trade  policy.  First,  MOIC  operationalized  the  Sanitary  and \nPhytosanitary and Technical Barriers to Trade Notification Unit and published notification on its \nwebsite. This is consistent with WTO requirements for transparency in trade policies. Second, \nMOIC  developed  and  implemented the  Lao  PDR  Trade  Portal,  which  provides  web-based \ninformation systems to assist SMEs on trade-related regulations. The government, with ADB \nsupport, developed a database for the notification units which are included in the trade portal. \nThird, the government institutionalized an information-sharing mechanism between ministries \nand agencies on trade-related measures. This improves transparency and should enable all line \nministries to provide consistent information to SMEs. \n \n22.  Post-program partnership framework. Subprogram 2 is followed by the P3F, which \nillustrates the government's recognition of its partnership with ADB and allows both parties to \ncontinue working together in this important area. Most of the actions specified in the P3F will be \nsupported through the TA loan. The medium-term direction and its expected results offer a \nreference point for targets that can be met through a results-based approach.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n23.  To support its reform initiatives, the government has requested a loan of $15 million \nequivalent to help finance subprogram 2 of the PSME2. The loan will have a 24-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \n                                                \n15 M. Kawai and G. Wignaraja. 2011. Asia\u2019s Free Trade Agreements. Cheltenham, UK: ADB. ", "7 \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft \nfinancing agreement. The closing date of the loan is 31 March 2014, by which date all proceeds \nof the loan will have been fully disbursed. Having satisfied all subprogram triggers, the loan will \nbe withdrawn in a single tranche upon loan effectiveness. The proceeds of the loan will finance \neconomy-wide imports from ADB member countries on the basis of the negative list16 and will \nbe  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB's  policy  on  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.17   \n \n24.  The size of the loan is based on consideration of a number of factors required to support \nimplementation of program reforms. The key considerations are: (i) the relative importance of \nthe sector to the economy, the weight and benefits of the reform program; (ii) the policy costs \nincurred by the government and stakeholders in implementing reforms; and (iii) the need to \nconform  to  the  overall  financing  requirement  from  the  country  partnership  strategy  period. \nSubprogram 2 loan proceeds will support key development spending in 2013, including about \n$1.5 million to institutionalize RIA; $0.3 million for decentralizing enterprise registration via \ndistrict offices; and other administrative, investment, and fiscal costs to the government in \nimplementing reforms. Paras. 28 and 29 summarize expected costs and benefits, and the \nprogram impact assessment provides details.18  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  MOIC will be the executing agency, which is responsible for overall implementation \nthrough the program coordination team. The team is chaired by the director general of the \nDepartment  of  SME  Promotion  and  will  include  the  Foreign Trade  Policy  Department;  the \ndepartments of import and export, and enterprise registration and management at MOIC; and \nthe  ministries  of  justice,  planning  and  investment,  and  science  and  technology,  who  are \nimplementing  agencies  for  the  program.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  responsible  for \ndisbursement. The implementation period is October 2011\u2013September 2013.  \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN \n26.  The government has requested a TA loan of $4.378 million equivalent. The TA serves \nthree purposes: (i) to mainstream the reforms completed in subprogram 2, including by setting \nup institutions to make these reforms sustainable; (ii) to provide capacity building support to the \ngovernment beyond 2013; and (iii) to help the government accomplish the P3F actions. The \nloan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  TA  loan  agreement.  The  TA  will  have  five  outputs  (i) \nenhanced  enterprise  registry;  (ii)  RIA  institutionalized;  (iii)  geographical  indication  system \nestablished; (iv) SME e-commerce and export development project established and (v) project \nmanagement unit established. The TA is estimated to cost $4.628 million. ADB will finance \n$4.378 million equivalent from ADB's Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund), \nincluding applicable taxes, duties, and bank charges. The government will provide $0.25 million \nequivalent through in-kind contributions (counterpart staff and various facilities) and financing of \ninterest  during  implementation.  The  project  administration  manual  outlines  the  proposed \nactivities under the TA, and will be further refined before implementation.19 The TA financing \nplan and investment plan are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. \n                                                \n16 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB. 1998.

Consultant inputs for the TA will total 276 person-months (international, 117 person-\nmonths; national, 159 person-months), from a combination of consulting firms and individual \nconsultants. The consulting firms will be selected through the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod, with a 90:10 ratio in the case of component 3 (due to its technical requirements) and an \n80:20 ratio for the other two components. At the request and on behalf of the government, ADB \nwill assist in the selection of consultants while MOIC will sign and administer their contracts \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nThe loan proceeds for financing activities under the TA loan will be disbursed in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2012,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n28.  Subprogram  2  will  generate  economic  gains  through  successful  implementation  of \nmedium-term policy actions. The estimated benefits exceed the loan amount. The policy costs \nto the government are conservatively estimated as a discounted present value lump sum of $9.3 \nmillion. These costs include the administrative, investment, and fiscal costs to the government in \nimplementing the reforms\u2014e.g., activities under the SME Development Plan; the investment \ncost to set up the one-stop service center, to make CIB-online fully operational, and to launch \nthe network of service providers; and the investment costs to set up RIA units  \n \n29.  ADB estimates the direct benefits of the reform program over the program period (2009\u2013\n2015) at approximately 0.3% of GDP, or a discounted present value lump sum of approximately \n$27 million. These economic benefits include the gains to the economy from a reduction in \nbusiness costs through RIA, efficiency gains for the private sector through the one-stop service \ncenter, potential growth and development of SMEs through better access to finance, and a \npremium to SMEs involved in export of geographical indication products.  \n \nB.  Governance \n \n30.  The government is committed to strengthening its public financial management system \nthrough the Public Financial Management Strengthening Program. A new procurement decree, \nimplementing rules and regulations, a standard procurement manual, and standard bidding \ndocuments have improved procurement practice. The government has taken credible measures \nto strengthen key oversight agencies such as the State Audit Organization, and has adopted the \nLaw on Anti-Corruption, Law on State Inspection, Law on Complaints and State Audit, and Law \non State Accounting. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand discussed with the government. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n31.  Reforms under subprogram 2 are expected to lower the incidence of poverty through two \nchannels\u2014(i) accelerating, broad-based, and sustainable growth, and (ii) lower prices for goods \nand services.20 Reducing business compliance costs will increase the number of SMEs in the \nformal sector, thereby supporting inclusive economic growth. By improving transparency in the \ntrade  policy  and  supporting  integration  in  the  region  and  the  rest  of  the  world,  economic \nefficiency will increase and domestic prices will fall. The PSME2 will have a positive impact on \nachieving the goal of gender equality through the SME Development Plan, 2011\u20132015, the \napproved SME Law, the network of service providers, and the regulatory review process. \n                                                \n20 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "10 \nD.  Safeguards \n \n32.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified \ncategory C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.21 \n \nE.  Risk and Mitigating Measures \n \n33.  The  risk  for  subprogram  2  is  assessed  as  medium  to  high.  Major  risks  include \nprocurement, corruption and threat to economic growth. Mitigation measures to address these \nrisks include support through ADB\u2019s public financial management strengthening program and \nimplementation of legislations such as Law on State Inspection and Law on State Accounting. \nThese  laws  seek  to  strengthen  public  financial  management  practices,  and  minimize \ndiscretionary exercise of power. The risk and mitigating measures are described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.22 \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n34.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 2 of the PSME2 \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed  in  detail  in  the  project  administration  manual  and  the  loan  agreements.  The \ngovernment has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for subprogram 2, which are set forth in \nthe loan agreements. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n(i)  the policy-based loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR9,890,000 to the \nLao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  subprogram  2  of  the  Second  Private \nSector and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development Program, from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 24 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and  \n(ii)  the technical assistance loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR2,887,000 \nto the Lao People\u2018s Democratic Republic for subprogram 2 of the Second Private \nSector and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development Program, from \nADB\u2018s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 \nyears including a grace period of 8 years,  \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement and technical assistance loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n9 September 2013 \n                                                \n21 Ibid., p9. \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).
