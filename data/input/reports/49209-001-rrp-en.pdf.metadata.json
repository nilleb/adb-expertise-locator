The report also \ndescribes  the  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Supporting  the  Second  West  Bengal \nDevelopment Finance Program, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1  \n \nThe  proposed  program  seeks  to  facilitate  the  continuation  of  a  comprehensive  fiscal \n2. \nconsolidation  program  in  West  Bengal  initiated  in  2012.  This  will  generate  fiscal  savings  and, \nthereby, assist West Bengal to augment growth-enhancing development financing and improve \ndelivery of public services.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe need to develop a comprehensive program that addresses fiscal consolidation and \ndevelopment for the Government of West Bengal (GOWB) has been on the agenda of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) since 2005 when the preparatory stage of a policy-based loan was first \ninitiated.2 This acquired renewed focus in 2011 when the state introduced a series of reforms with \nthe  change in  state  administration.  Since then,  ADB  and GOWB  have been  in constant  policy \ndialogue  to develop  a durable  reform  and  developmental  agenda  starting  with the  preparatory \nstage of the first policy-based loan in 2012.3 \n\n4. \nIn view of the GOWB\u2019s fiscally-stressed situation, ADB approved a policy-based loan of \n$400.0 million and a TA grant of $0.7 million to India in 2012 for the first West Bengal Development \nFinance  Program  (the first  program). The key  contributory factors  to the fiscal  stress  were  the \nstate\u2019s  low  own-tax  revenue4 effort  and  a  high level  of  non-discretionary  expenditure  (salaries, \ninterest  payments,  and  pensions),  which  adversely  affected  GOWB\u2019s  ability  to  pursue  its \ndevelopment financing objective.5 This provided the rationale to the first program, which aimed to \ncreate the fiscal space to augment and sustain higher development spending (public investment) \nin the state.  \n\n \n5. \nGiven the difficulties of rationalizing public expenditure over 2\u20123 years, ADB and GOWB \nagreed that the first program would facilitate the necessary steps to augment revenue and lay the \nfoundations for improved targeting of scarce public resources to improve the overall efficiency of \n\n                                                \n1  The proposed program is a continuation of the West Bengal Development Finance Program (the first program). A \n\nfollow-on program was envisaged in the original design of the first program. \n\n2   West  Bengal  is  a  densely  populated  state,  fourth  largest  in  India,  with  a  population  of  91  million  people  and \n\nstrategically located in eastern India bordering Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal.  \n\n3  ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors for Proposed Policy-Based Loan \nand Technical Assistance Grant to India for West Bengal Development Finance Program. Manila (Loan 2926-IND, \napproved on 30 October 2012). \n\n4  The state\u2019s revenue receipts comprise (i) own revenues, which include those tax and non-tax revenues that fall within \nthe jurisdiction of the Government of West Bengal (GOWB), and (ii) transfers from the Government of India in the \nform of grants and share in central government\u2019s taxes and duties. \n\n5  These have had an adverse impact both in terms of (i) preventing effective use of the budget as an instrument to set \npolicy priorities particularly through discretionary spending; and more importantly, (ii) constraining both public and \nindirectly private investments, thus undermining economic growth and development in the state. These have  also \nhad serious implications for manufacturing growth in the state leading to a narrowing of the commercial tax base. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nspending. The GOWB achieved full compliance on all policy actions under the first program, and \nhas  moved  beyond  the  goals  of  the  first  program.6 Independent  assessments  recognized  the \nGOWB\u2019s  commitment  to  fiscal  consolidation,  and  the  GOWB  received  several  awards  for  e-\ngovernance in tax administration in 2014.7 \n\n \n6. \nPolicy actions in the first program clearly enhanced the revenue performance of GOWB in \na  broad-based  manner,  and  improved  the  state\u2019s  finances  (Table  1).  Public  investment  (as  a \npercentage of gross state domestic product [GSDP]), reached almost 1.3% in FY2016 from 0.5% \nin FY2012, although the fiscal deficit reduced to 2.2% in FY2016 from 3.4% in FY2012. This was \none of the major contributions of the first program. \n \n\nTable 1: Key Fiscal Parameters \n(% of gross state domestic product unless stated otherwise) \n\nItem \nFiscal deficit \nRevenue deficit \nCapital outlay \nDebt stock \nCost of revenue collection as a \n   percentage of revenue  \nOwn-tax revenue \n\nFY2010 \n6.3 \n5.4 \n0.8 \n42.0 \n2.43 \n\nFY2012 \n3.4 \n2.8 \n0.5 \n39.3 \n1.64 \n\nFY2015 \n3.4 \n2.1 \n1.2 \n34.7 \n1.03 \n\nFY2016  \n2.2 \n1.0 \n1.3 \n32.6 \n\u2026 \n\n4.2 \n\n4.7 \n\n4.9 \n\n4.5 \n\n(\u2026) = not available, FY = fiscal year. \nSource: Government of West Bengal, Finance Accounts, FY2010\u2013FY2016.  \n \n7. \nThe first program was an example of successful partnership between the GOWB (and the \nGovernment of India) and ADB. It critically hinged on the political commitment of GOWB to bring \nabout  necessary  fiscal  reforms,  so  that  it  can  set  the  fiscal  objectives  on  a  balanced  and \nsustainable path geared toward meeting the state\u2019s long-term development financing needs. \n \nIt was recognized in the original design of the first program that the full effect of the reforms \n8. \non improvements of public service delivery would need a period of 5 years to materialize, and that \nthe  GOWB  will  require  additional  support  under  a  follow-on  program. 8  Additional  external \nassistance is required to sustain the reform momentum because of the following reasons: \n \n\n(i) \n\nSome  of  the  reforms  already  initiated,  by  their  very  nature,  have  a  long-term \nimplementation cycle. The foundations of these reforms were laid under the first \nprogram but they now need to be carried forward. These reforms include linking \nthe  medium-term  expenditure  frameworks  (MTEFs),  initiated  under  the  first \n\n                                                \n6  The  PCR  rating  for  the  first  program  was  successful.  The  TA  was  rated  highly  successful.  ADB.  2015.  Project \n\nCompletion Report for West Bengal Development Finance Program. Manila. \n\n7  In  recognition  of  the  success  of  many  e-governance  initiatives,  the  GOWB\u2019s  Directorate  of  Commercial  Taxes \nreceived the FY2015 Government of India\u2019s National Award for excellence in government process re-engineering. \nSimilarly,  the  Finance  Department  received  FY2014  CSI-Nihilent  e-governance  awards  for  (i)  promotion  of \ninformation  management  in  administration  of  commercial  taxes,  and  (ii)  workflow-based  file  and  letter  tracking \nsystem.  Furthermore,  the  Excise  Department  received  the  2014  Skotch  digital  inclusion  award  for  the  e-Abgari \nsystem, which introduced an online tax filing system in the state excise administration that also helps track production, \ndistribution, and sale of liquor. Finally, the Finance Department received an award from the Chief Minister on the \noccasion of the 68th Independence Day of India on 15 August 2014 for the outstanding contribution to citizen-friendly \ntax reforms and e-governance. In recognition of the improvements in finance and tax-related compliances, GOWB \nwas recognized by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion under the Ministry of Commerce and Industries, \nGovernment of India in May 2014 report on improving business environment across India. \n\n8  The GOWB requested a second program in a letter to the Department of Economic Affairs dated 29 October 2014. \nIt considers a second program necessary to further consolidate its finances and step-up financing of infrastructure, \nsocial welfare, and development programs, which are important prerequisites for improved service delivery.  \n\n\f(SOEs) \n\nimplementation  of \n\nto  ensure  effective \n\nprogram,  with  actual  budget  allocations;  payments  for  the  voluntary  retirement \nscheme  (VRS)  and/or  early  retirement  scheme  (ERS)  in  selected  state-owned \nenterprises \nthe  subsidy \nrationalization strategy; and digitizing legacy data on registered property deeds in \nall registration offices in the state. A continued assistance for such reforms through \nthe proposed second program would consolidate and sustain gains made towards \nbetter own-revenue management and expenditure rationalization. \n \nThe first program focused on augmenting public investment. However, creating an \nenabling environment for facilitating private investment, especially in the areas of \nsocial and economic infrastructures, is equally important in the context of growth \nand  public  service  delivery.  Thus,  the  second  program  envisages  supporting \nprivate investments more directly. This is intended to be achieved by creating an \ninfrastructure  facility  for  supporting  project  preparation,  development,  and \nappraisal activities as well as for viability gap funding (VGF).9 \n\nThe  follow-on  reforms  will  have  major  cost  implications,  such  as  linking  the \nmedium-term  expenditure  frameworks  (MTEFs)  with  actual  budget  allocations; \npayments  for  the  voluntary  retirement  scheme  (VRS)  and/or  early  retirement \nscheme (ERS) in selected state-owned enterprises (SOEs), settlement of liabilities \nof two SOEs, and VGF for PPP projects. If GOWB has to incur the entire cost of \nreforms,  then  this  could  undermine  GOWB\u2019s  regular  budgetary  allocations  for \npublic investment (enhanced under the first program). \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n \nAn integrated solution comprising a policy-based loan with clear program costs supported \n9. \nby  the  attached  TA  is  the  appropriate  lending  approach  and modality.  This  will  help  ADB  and \nGOWB to design and implement additional policy actions to carry forward GOWB\u2019s own reform \nagenda  without  putting unsustainable strain on the  public  exchequer  to finance  reforms  costs. \nThe  second  program  will  support key  elements of  the  state\u2019s  agenda  including  making the  tax \nadministration more efficient and transparent through simplification of rules and e-governance, \nenhancing outlays for capital creation, and improving the business environment for micro, small \nand medium enterprises.10 \n \nADB\u2019s India country partnership strategy for 2018\u2013202211 aims to support the Government \n10. \nof India\u2019s goal of higher, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth with its emphasis on three \npillars,  viz.  (i)  boosting  competitiveness  to  create  better  jobs;  (ii)  inclusive  provision  of \ninfrastructure and services, comprising public sector management among other thrust areas; and \n(iii) addressing climate change and increase climate resilience. The strategy declares that ADB \nwill extend assistance to improve the efficiency of public sector resource management at state, \nlocal  body,  sector  (including  public  sector  undertaking),  and  project  level.  The  first  area  of \nemphasis in public sector management includes ADB\u2019s support towards fiscal space creation and \nsound  fiscal  discipline  at  state  and  urban  local  bodies  levels,  through  fiscal  consolidation  and \nimproved capacity of public financial management. Support may include budgetary reforms with \n\n                                                \n9  Viability gap funding (VGF) is a grant that is provided as capital subsidy to attract private participation in those public-\nprivate partnership (PPP) projects that have economic justification but may not be financially viable without that grant. \n10 Government of West Bengal, Finance Department. 2017.

Another \nimportant  lesson  is  that  ownership  is  guaranteed  through  long-term  association  with  the \ndevelopment partner(s) and continuation of the key implementation staff. \n \nB. \n \nThe  impact  will  be  improved  accessibility,  quality,  and  affordability  of  public  services.12 \n12. \nThe outcome will be improved and sustained investment in the state, particularly in the social and \neconomic sectors.13 \n \nC. \n \n13. \n \n\nThe three output areas under the second program will be:14 \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n(i) \n\nExpenditure rationalization efforts accelerated.

The GOWB has already \ncomplied with the policy actions in the first tranche, which is expected to be released in October 2017. The balance \n14 second tranche actions are expected to be completed within 22 months of the release of the first tranche, or by \nAugust 2019. \n\n15 State  transport  corporations  include  Calcutta  State  Transport  Corporation,  Calcutta  Tramways  Company,  South \n\nBengal State Transport Corporation, North Bengal State Transport Corporation, and Shalimar Works Limited. \n\n16 These include National Iron and Steel Company Limited and Neo Pipes and Tubes Company Limited. \n17 An MTEF requires policymakers to look across sectors, programs, and projects to examine how public spending can \nbest serve  national  development  objectives  over  the  medium  term.  In  doing so,  they  must  weigh  the importance \nattached to short-term goals against the attached to medium-term objectives and set aside the narrow self-interests \nof spending agencies. MTEFs can promote fiscal discipline by addressing several causes of deficit bias. By specifying \nan overall resource constraint, MTEFs rein in the political tendency to overcommit public resources (the common \npool problem) by requiring policymakers to acknowledge that the total amount of resources is limited, to negotiate \ncollectively, and to commit themselves to detailed multiyear fiscal constraints. Further, by imparting a medium-term \nperspective to budgeting and taking into account the future fiscal costs of government policies and programs, an \nMTEF can fill information gaps that allow politicians to renege on their commitments to implement affordable policies. \nA few studies suggest that fiscal discipline is stronger in many countries after adoption of MTEFs.

Activities proposed under the program \nare broadly in continuation of the reform agenda initiated under the first program. \nThese  include:  (a)  improved  tax  monitoring  by  the  Directorate  of  Commercial \nTaxes;  (b)  completion  of  preparatory  steps  for  integration  with  the  goods  and \nservices  tax  network;  20 (c)  continued  support  to  information  technology  (IT) \nsystems  in  strengthening  administration  of  the Excise  Directorate; (d)  continued \nsupport  to  IT  systems  in  strengthening  administration  of  the  Land  and  Land \nReforms Department, and the Directorate of Registration and Stamp Revenue to \ncomplete  the  digitization  of  legacy  deed  data  in  both  departments,  and  enable \nsimultaneous mutation  of  land records  on  the  registration of  a  property; and (e) \nimproved  service  delivery  for  taxpayers  by  setting  up  facilitation  centers  in  the \nselected registration offices.  \n \n\n14. \nThe  objective  of  the  second  program  is  to  help  the  GOWB  sustain  a  fiscal  profile  that \nensures elevated public investment in the state without breaching the key fiscal targets. Higher \ninvestment  in  economic  and  social  infrastructure,  combined  with  policies  to  promote  private \ninvestment,  will  remain  an  important  prerequisite  for  sustaining  high  growth  and  employment. \nWithout  high  growth,  especially  manufacturing  growth,  GOWB\u2019s  own  revenue  will  not  grow  in \nadequate measure to support the state\u2019s development financing needs. Once public finances are \nplaced on a sustainable path, the GOWB will also be in a strong position to provide affordable \npublic services, leading to a discernible positive impact on the livelihoods of the people of West \nBengal.  \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n \nD. \n \n15. \nA development financing gap has been estimated based on discussions with GOWB about \n(i)  additional  development  financing  needs,  (ii)  the  current  fiscal  profile of  the  state,  and (iii)  a \nsustainable fiscal consolidation road map for 5 years (FY2018\u2012FY2022) to carry forward fiscal \nconsolidation  efforts  initiated  under  the  first  program.  At  a  macro  level,  the  proposed  second \nprogram  will  help  the  state  to  augment  and  sustain  development  financing.  Development \nexpenditure (capital outlays) as a percentage of gross state domestic product (GSDP) is expected \nto rise from 1.3% in FY2016 to 1.5% and 1.7% in FY2018 and FY2019, respectively, so as to \neventually reach 2.2% by FY2022 under the program. The policy reforms under the program will \nlead to improved revenue generation and contain growth of total expenditure leading to improved \nfiscal outcome under a reform scenario. The reforms will generate additional revenue equivalent \nto  $1.9  billion  over  the  program  period  directly  through  revenue  administration  reforms,  and \n                                                \n19 This will be in line with the Government of India\u2019s policy for VGF. \n20 Goods and services tax is a comprehensive, multi-stage, destination-based single indirect tax that will be levied on \nevery value addition and subsumes within it 5 taxes at the central level and 6 taxes at the state level. Other levies \nwhich were applicable on inter-state transportation of goods have also been done away with in GST regime. It has \nbeen implemented with effect from 1 July 2017. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nindirectly  through  revenue  buoyancy  impact  of  increased  growth-enhancing  investments.  The \nsecond  program  will  thereby  contribute  towards  sustainability  while  increasing  development \nspending  in  a  sustained  manner.  However,  there  is  a  development  financing  gap  (additional \ncapital outlays plus additional current expenditure under the ADB-supported reform program net \nof new fiscal space created under the program) of $431.3 million over the program period. ADB\u2019s \nassistance will help cover 69.6% of the gap (Appendix 5).21  \n\n \n16. \nBased  on  the  development  financing  requirements  of  the  policy  reform  program,  the \nGovernment of India has requested a regular loan in the amount of $300 million equivalent from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, to help finance the program. Two tranches in \nthe amount of $150 million equivalent each are envisaged, with the first tranche disbursed upon \nloan effectiveness, and the second tranche approximately 22 months after the first tranche. \n \nAt the request of the Government of India,22 ADB will provide the Government of India with \n17. \nan option to request disbursement in Indian rupees (INR) for either or both of the tranches under \nthe second program.23 In effect, withdrawals under either or both of the tranches may be made in \nINR or United States Dollar (USD), on terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and program \nagreements. The local currency financing option is at the discretion of the Government of India\u2015it \ncan choose not to exercise it. At the same time, ADB has provided this option to the Government \nof India on a best efforts basis. If the market condition is not conducive and ADB is unable to raise \nINR in full, the disbursement for that tranche will be, in part or in full, as applicable, in USD. \n \n18. \nThe USD portion of the loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, \nan  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the draft loan and program agreements. Based on the straight-line \nmethod, the average loan maturity is 10.39 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to \nADB.  The  Government  of  India  will  relend  to  GOWB  the  local  currency  generated  from  the \nproceeds  of  the  total  loan  amount  in  USD  in  accordance  with  its  arrangement  for  transfer  of \nexternal assistance to the GOWB. The tenor and grace period of the INR portion of the loan will \nmatch that of the USD loan, and have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years. The \nterms  and  conditions  of  any  disbursement  in  INR  will  be  specified  in  the  INR  pricing  notice, \nprovided to the GOWB in response to its withdrawal request for disbursement in INR.24  \n \n19. \nThe Government of India has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nin local currency and USD under LIBOR-based lending facilities based on the above terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices are its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n\n                                                \n21 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 This request was followed by the Government of India\u2019s relaxation of its regulatory requirements, facilitating ADB to \nraise INR funding. ADB may raise INR funding by, among others, issuance of local currency bonds or through cross-\ncurrency swaps with domestic bank counterparties. \n\n23 ADB. 2005. Introducing the Local Currency Loan Product. Manila. The drawdown amount in INR would be computed \nusing the ADB foreign exchange book rate (https://forex.adb.org/fx_rate/) on the date of receipt by ADB of the INR \nwithdrawal request.  \n\n24 Government of India can request for indicative cost any time before the disbursement date and it will submit a formal \n\nirrevocable withdrawal request at least 20 days prior to the requested disbursement date. \n\n\fE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n20. \nThe Finance Department of GOWB will continue to be the executing agency of the second \nprogram, and the Principal Secretary of the Finance Department will be the focal point for matters \npertaining to the program.  \n \n21. \nThe Fiscal Policy and Management Unit (FPMU), set up during implementation of the first \nprogram, will assist the line departments implementing the program. It will be headed by a senior \nGOWB official as the program director. The FPMU will be responsible for: \n \n\noverall coordination and monitoring of the program, including the policy actions; \npreparing and submitting all required reports to ADB;  \nsubmitting the quarterly reports to ADB; and \nhelping to implement the attached TA. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n \n22. \nProcurement,  advance  contracting,  and  retroactive  financing  are  not  expected.  The \nprogram  will  be  implemented  over  2  years.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements for \npolicy-based loans.25 ADB will monitor program implementation through periodic progress reports \nand will field regular missions to confirm fulfillment of policy actions for tranche release. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nThe attached TA will strengthen the key institutions responsible for implementing reforms \n\n \n23. \nto improve fiscal management performance in the state. The TA components are: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(v) \n\nRevenue  administration  strengthened.  The  TA  will  support  the  GOWB  in  (i) \nimplementation of the goods and services tax; (ii) implementation of supply chain \nmanagement system in excise, and (iii) strengthening of the property registration \nsystem. \nProject appraisal and monitoring capacity strengthened. The TA will train and \nassist FPMU in project appraisal and monitoring. \n\n(iii)  Medium-term expenditure frameworks developed. Support will be provided to \nupdate the MTEFs prepared under the first program and link the updated MTEFs \nwith actual budget allocations for FY2019. \n\n(iv)  West  Bengal \n\nInvestment  and \n\nInfrastructure  Development  Fund \noperationalized. Technical support will support and build capacity of the FPMU \nstaff to select, structure, and develop the PPP projects that will be provided viability \ngap funding  under the WBIIDF. \nInternal  audit  strengthened.  The  TA  will  help  strengthen  the  internal  audit \ndepartment within the Finance Department, including introduction of a risk-based \naudit manual. \n\n \n24. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others). The GOWB will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff remuneration, office accommodation and supplies, local \ntransport, other logistical support, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n25. \n\nThe implementation arrangements for the TA will be aligned with those of the policy-based \n\n                                                \n25  ADB. 1998.

The FPMU will implement the TA components, and the Finance Department will carry out \noverall  supervision  and  coordination.  A  total  of  28  person-months  of  consultancy  services \n(national)  will  be  required  intermittently.  The  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  for  recruiting  the \nnational consultants using the quality and cost-based selection method with a standard quality \ncost ratio of 90:10. All consultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). All disbursements under the TA will be made \nin  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic \n\nA. \n \n26. \nSeveral outputs of the program have technical components at their core. The information \nand  communication  technology-driven  initiatives  such  as  QR-code  based  holograms  for  liquor \nbottles  and  SMS-based  detection  facility  for  liquor  bottles  will  continue to  boost  compliance  of \nvarious  state  taxes.  Integration  with  the  goods  and  services  tax  network  will  remain  a  major \nchallenge. Preparation, selection, and monitoring of PPP projects to be funded under the WBIIDF \nwill require strong financial and project management skills. Updating the MTEFs and linking them \nwith actual budget allocations will require sound technical knowledge. Capacity building support \nunder the program will assist the relevant government departments to manage these technical \noperations better. \n \nB. \n \n27. \nThe program was subject to economic analysis, the results of which demonstrate that its \nbenefits  considerably  outweigh  the  costs.  The  key  direct  benefits  considered  are  (i) reduced \ncompliance costs in revenue administration (due to e-filing of tax returns, for example, and other \nIT-based  taxpayer  services)  leading  to  higher  tax  buoyancy;  (ii)  fiscal  savings  from  greater \nefficiency and cessation of systemic leakages; and (iii) targeted public expenditure on health and \neducation over the medium to long run. A comparison between the baseline and the pro-growth \nreform program scenarios shows that the overall fiscal deficit is expected to remain around the \ntarget  figure  of  3%  of  GSDP  despite  higher  capital  outlays  (development  financing)  under  the \nreform scenario (Table 2). Fiscal space created under the program, resulting both from revenue \naugmentation and expenditure rationalization, will contribute to this outcome. Moreover, the debt \nstock\u2013GSDP  ratio  will  decline  from  33.71%  in FY2017  to  30.01%  in FY2022  under the  reform \nscenario (footnote 21). \n \n\nTable 2: Baseline and Reform Scenarios  \n(% of gross state domestic product) \n\nFY2019 \n\nFY2020 \n\nFY2018 \n\nItem \nBaseline Scenario \nFiscal surplus or deficit \nCapital outlays \nDebt stock \nReform Scenario \nFiscal surplus or deficit \nCapital outlays  \nAdditional capital outlays \nDebt stock \n( ) = negative. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n\n \n(2.95) \n1.45  \n32.86  \n \n(2.93) \n1.50  \n0.05  \n32.83  \n\n \n(2.90) \n1.50  \n32.05  \n \n(3.07) \n1.70  \n0.20  \n32.20 \n\n \n(2.85) \n1.60  \n31.29  \n \n(2.89) \n1.80  \n0.20  \n31.41  \n\nFY2021 \n \n(2.85) \n1.70  \n30.62  \n \n(2.88) \n1.90  \n0.20  \n30.70  \n\nFY2022 \n \n\n(2.85) \n2.05 \n30.02  \n \n(2.82) \n2.20 \n0.15 \n30.01 \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n \n28. \nAs part of program preparation, a governance risk assessment was conducted along the \nlines  prescribed  by  the  implementation  guidelines  of  ADB\u2019s  Second  Governance  and \nAnticorruption  Action  Plan.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  also \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  GOWB\u2019s  Finance  Department.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  the  implementation  of  the  program  will  adhere  to  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy. This assessment was complemented by a review of areas of possible risk \nand  vulnerability  in  state  financial  management.  The  assessment  found  some  risks  that  could \naffect the proposed program. They include risks related to (i) political support for and ownership \nof  GOWB,  especially  for  sensitive  reforms;  and  (ii)  institutional  dimensions  of  the  proposed \nprogram (e.g., weak capacity in the relevant institutions). The financial assessment found several \nareas of concern: (i) weak appraisal capacity of investment projects and integration of capital and \ncurrent  budgets  through  proper  planning,  (ii)  weak  internal  audit  systems,  and  (iii)  lack  of \nalignment  between  sector  goals  and  resource  allocation. 26  While  no  major  risks  of \nmismanagement  of  resources  at  the  executing  level  can  be  discerned,  issues  identified  in  the \nfinancial assessments are targeted for capacity development under the TA and policy changes \nunder the loan.  \n \nD. \n \n29. \nThe  poverty  reduction  and  social  impacts  of  the  program  are  positive.  The  support  for \naugmenting and sustaining development financing will have a substantial impact on human and \nincome poverty. The program\u2019s emphasis on better expenditure targeting, especially in health and \neducation through linking MTEFs with budget allocations, is clearly geared toward protecting the \npoor and other vulnerable groups. The health indicators for women and children in the state are \npoor because of ineffective delivery of public services and lack of adequate budget allocations. \nThis  is  manifest  in  many  ways.  For  example,  higher  maternal  mortality  rates  in West  Bengal, \ncompared with some other advanced states, reflect inadequate health services and facilities for \nantenatal and obstetric care. Rectifying these problems becomes more challenging if GOWB is \nunable to invest in economic and social infrastructure\u2015either directly or through partnerships with \nthe private sector.27 \n \nE. \n \n30. \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples) are categorized C. \n \nF. \n \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures  are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.28 Fiduciary risks are moderate because of strong commitment of GOWB \nto reforms, as evidenced in the first program. Overall, the risks are assessed to be low and the \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n \n \n\nGiven the nature of the program, all three safeguard categories (environment, involuntary \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n26 An updated Results-Based Public Sector Management  Assessment Framework (accessible from the list of linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n27 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nGOWB\u2019s commitment to sensitive \nfiscal reforms is not sustained. \n\nWeak capacities in institutions \naffects proper identification and \ndevelopment of the PPP \nsubprojects  \n\nInterdepartmental transfers of key \nGOWB officials adversely impacts \nproject implementation. \n\nFiduciary risks \n\nExogenous macroeconomic shocks \nmay impact investment decisions. \n\nADB staff will engage continually with GOWB, and will adopt \npre-emptive strategy to avoid potential bottlenecks.
