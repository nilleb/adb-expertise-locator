The  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training \n(MOET)  plans  to  introduce  a  3-year  pilot  tryout  of  a  new, \ndiversified upper secondary curriculum starting from the 2002/04 \nschool  year.    The  Project  will  help  improve  the  quality  and \nefficiency  of  upper  secondary  education  by  supporting  the \nGovernment\u2019s  effort  to  diversify  the  curriculum  and  textbooks  in \nline with student-centered, active learning methods during the try-\nout  and  revision  period;  and  by  developing  quality  support \nsystems  such  as  trained  teachers,  improved  libraries,  and  well-\nequipped  laboratories,  and  student  assessment.  The  Project  will \npromote  access,  equity,  and  participation  in  upper  secondary \neducation in disadvantaged provinces through (i) school facilities; \n(ii) provision  of  furniture  and  equipment;  and  (iii)  study  support \nprograms for the poor, ethnic minorities, and girls. The Project will \nlocal \ninstitutional  capacity, \nalso  strengthen \nadministration, \nto \nexamining \nby \ndecentralized management of upper secondary education. \n\nfrom  MOET \n\napproaches \n\npossible \n\nto \n\nPrimary education became near-universal in 2000\u2014a remarkable \nachievement  among  developing  countries  with  similar  levels  of \nper  capita  income.  Expansion  of  secondary-level  coverage  has \nalso  been  remarkable.  During  1991\u20131999,  lower  secondary \nschool  enrollment  grew  from  2.7  million  to  5.8  million,  for  a  net \nenrollment  rate  (NER)  of  68%.  Upper  secondary  school \nenrollment also expanded rapidly, from about 700,000 to 2 million, \nfor  an  NER  of  32%.  Despite  impressive  gains  in  access,  much \nremains  to  be  accomplished  to  improve  the  quality  of  upper \nsecondary education. \n\nThe  quality  of  education  suffers  mostly  from  limited  instructional \ntime  and  out-of-date memorized teaching and learning methods. \nMOET  plans  to  introduce  the  new,  diversified  upper  secondary \nschool  curriculum,  with  general  curriculum  courses  designed  for \nthe  many  students  who  will  probably  not  proceed  to  the  tertiary \neducation  level.  To  improve  curriculum  relevance  to  the  labor \nmarket,  content  needs  to  be  linked  to  industry  demands.  The \ndiversified  curriculum  is  under  preparation,  and  try-out  of  new \nteaching  methods  and  instructional  materials  for  grade  10  will \nbegin  in  the  2003/04  school  year.  A  challenge  for  quality \nimprovement is to change classroom teaching and learning to be \nmore active and student centered. \n\n\f \n\n \n\niv \n \n\n \nObjectives and Scope  \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \n\nto \n\nSignificant disparities in enrollment and cycle completion between \nrural  and  urban  and  among  ethnic  groups  appear  at  the  upper \nlevel.  Ethnic  minority  students  are  particularly \nsecondary \ndisadvantaged.  The  Government  needs \nreach  poor, \nunderserved  groups  by  strengthening  institutional  capacity  in \ndecentralized  education  management  and  by  developing \nadequate  regulatory  options  to  manage  and  monitor  nonpublic \nupper secondary schools.   \n \nThe  broad  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction  in  Viet  Nam  through  development  and  improvement  of \nupper  secondary  education.  Over  the  medium  term,  the  Project \nimprove  quality,  efficiency,  access  and  equity,  and \nwill \nmanagement  capacity \nin  upper  secondary  education,  by \nstrengthening  quality  support  systems  nationwide  and  targeting \nsome  of  the  most  economically  and  educationally  disadvantaged \nareas  in  the  country.  The  specific  project  objectives  are  to \n(i) improve quality and efficiency of upper secondary education by \n(a)  supporting  the  Government  effort  to  try  out  and  diversify  the \ncurriculum,  textbooks,  and  other  instructional  materials;  and \n(b) developing education quality support systems such as trained \nteachers, improved libraries, equipped laboratories, and improved \nevaluation, student assessment, and quality assurance systems; \n(ii) improve  access,  equity,  and  participation  in  upper  secondary \neducation in the disadvantaged areas through school construction \nand replacement, provision of furniture and equipment, and study \nsupport  programs  for  the  poor,  ethnic  minorities,  and  girls;  and \n(iii) strengthen  institutional  capacity  to  manage  upper  secondary \neducation, from MOET to local administration, including provincial \ndepartments  of  education  and  training  (DOETs),  district  bureaus \nof  education  and  training,  and  schools,  by  examining  possible \napproaches to decentralized management. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $80  million  equivalent, \nincluding taxes and duties, physical and price contingencies, and \ninterest  charge  on  the  loan.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is \nestimated at $29.9 million (37.4% of the total cost), and the local \ncurrency cost at $50.1 million equivalent (62.6%).   \n \n                                                                                       ($ million) \n\nSources \n\nADB \nGovernment \nCommunity \n      Total \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\n29.9 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n29.9 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n25.1 \n17.0 \n8.0 \n50.1 \n\nTotal Cost  Percent \n\n55.0 \n17.0 \n8.0 \n80.0 \n\n69 \n21 \n10 \n100 \n\n  ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n   \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  SDR  41,615,000  ($55 \nmillion  equivalent)  from  its  Special  Funds  resources,  with  a \nmaturity term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years and \nan interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n \n\n\f \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\n \n\n v\n\nUntil 31 December 2009 \n \n30 June 2009 \n\noversee \n\nteachers\u2019  guides  will \n\nfor  administration  and \n\n \nMinistry of Education and Training \n \nMOET will have overall responsibility for project coordination and \nimplementation.  An  Interagency  Steering  Committee  will  provide \noverall  guidance  for  the  Project  and  help  other  government \nagencies coordinate and liaise with each other. A National Project \nImplementation  Unit \nday-to-day \n(NPIU)  will \nimplementation  of  project  activities.  A  deputy  manager  and  six \nspecialists \nfinance,  monitoring  and \nevaluation,  civil  works,  procurement,  textbook  and  curriculum \ndevelopment,  and  staff  development  will  assist \nthe  NPIU \nmanager. Provincial project implementation units (PPIUs), one in \neach  project  province,  will  be  set  up  in  existing  DOETs  to \ncoordinate,  plan,  implement,  monitor,  and  supervise the Project; \nand report to the NPIU on province-level project activities. \n \nAll  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  following \nfor  Procurement;  and  civil  works  and \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines \nprocurement  of \nfollow  government \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  International  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  will  be  applied  to  supply  contracts  for  goods  and \nservices  estimated  at  $500,000  equivalent  or  more.  Supply \ncontracts  for  goods  such  as  vehicles  and  computers  (other  than \ninstructional  materials)  of  less  than  $500,000  but  more  than \n$100,000  will  follow  international  shopping  procedures.  Supply \ncontracts  for  instructional  materials  of  less  than  $500,000 \nequivalent  but  more  than  $100,000  will  follow  local  competitive \nbidding (LCB) procedures. Small contracts for minor items of less \nthan  $100,000  equivalent  may  be  procured  by  direct  purchase. \nProject civil works will consist of construction and replacement of \nclassrooms  and  facilities.    All  project  civil  works  contracts  will  be \nawarded  on  the  basis  of  LCB  following  government  procedures \nacceptable to ADB.  \n \nThe  Project  will  use  consultants  to  develop  quality  support \nsystems  nationally;  promote  access,  equity,  and  participation  in \ndecentralized \nand \ndisadvantaged \nmanagement  of  upper  secondary  education.    Approximately  56 \nperson-months  of \ninternational  and  154  person-months  of \ndomestic  consulting  will  be  needed.    The  Government  will  select \nand  engage  all  ADB-finance  consultants  through  a  firm  using \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. \n \n\nstrengthen \n\nprovinces; \n\n\f \n\n \n\nvi \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nThe  Project  will  upgrade  upper  secondary  education  to  produce \ngraduates  with  the  skills  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the \nVietnamese  economy.  The  Project  will  improve  conditions  in  the \ncommunity  where  the  project  schools  are  and  ensure  that  upper \nsecondary education is responsive  to local needs. Approximately \n45% of all beneficiaries will be female.  \n \nThe  beneficiaries  of  component  1  will  be  all  upper  secondary \neducation  students  (about  5  million  during  the  Project)  who  will \nhave access to more modern, interesting, and relevant curriculum \nand learning materials. The Project targets approximately 66,000 \nstudents  during  the  pilot  try-out,  and  revision  of  the  curriculum \nand  textbooks  in  55  upper  secondary  schools  in  the  11  selected \nprovinces.  While  the  curriculum  is  being  developed,  100 master \nteachers,  1,000  core  trainers,  and  about  18,600  teachers  will \nreceive  training.    About  230,000  poor  students  will  benefit  from \naccess  to  improved  instructional  materials.  The  new  technical \nupper  secondary  schools  will  benefit  employers,  who  will  have a \nsource  of  well-trained  employees,  and  students,  who  will  have \nmore jobs.   \n \nUnder component 2, poor, ethnic minority, and female students in \nthe  20  disadvantaged  provinces  will  be  direct  beneficiaries. \nProvision  of  about  1,500  constructed  and  replaced classrooms \nwill  benefit  approximately  120,000  upper  secondary  students; \n22,500  poor,  ethnic  minority,  and/or  female  students  will  attend \nspecial  study  support  programs;  and  1,000  teachers  will  be \ntrained  to  provide  these  programs.  Another  810  teachers  will \nreceive \nteaching  skills. \nInformation,  education,  and  communication  programs  will  benefit \nethnic  minority  girls,  who  will  be  encouraged  to  attend  upper \nsecondary schools. \n \nThe  beneficiaries  of  component  3  will  be  communities, through \ncloser relationships with their schools, and better-managed public \nand  nonpublic  schools.  Pilot  initiatives  in  community-school \npartnerships  and  school  management  in  difficult  situations  will \nlead  to  efficiency  gains  and  resource  mobilization  for  schools. \nApproximately  1,400  education  administrators,  school  principals, \nand members of community groups and parents associations will \nreceive management training.  \n \n\nto  update \n\nin-service \n\ntraining \n\ntheir \n\nRisks and Assumptions  The Project will help the Government introduce a new, diversified \ncurriculum  and  textbooks,  but  not  all  classrooms  will  have \nteachers trained in the new curriculum, textbooks, or instructional \nmaterials at the beginning of the school year.  MOET is aware of \nthe  risk,  and  phasing  the  introduction  of  the  curriculum  and \ntextbooks  will  be  flexible.  The  Project  will  also  build  on  and \ncollaborate with existing systems at the DOET level for in-service \nteacher  training,  and  civil  works.  During  the  transition,  teachers \nwill continue to rely on familiar teaching methods. However, most \nteachers are willing to accept new teaching methods and will try \nto  adopt them.  Risks involved in  improving  access,  equity,  and  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n vii \n\nparticipation  in  upper  secondary  education  in  disadvantaged \nareas are that (i) qualified teachers and volunteers to conduct the \nspecial study support programs are lacking, and (ii) school sites in \nprovinces  might  not  be  in  the  neediest  areas.  During  project \npreparation, detailed discussions were held with DOETs, and the \nselection  criteria  carefully  developed.  To  minimize  risks  involved \nin  civil  works,  PPIUs  will  utilize  the  services  of  provincial \nconstruction  engineers  to  supervise  civil  works  and  budgets, \nundertake fieldwork, and hold consultative meetings. \n\n\fviii \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Upper Secondary Education Development Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance, Indicators and An alysis \n\n \nA. \n \nPrimary  education  became  near-universal  in  2000\u2014a  remarkable  achievement  among \n2. \ndeveloping  countries  with  similar  levels  of  per  capita  income.  Expansion  of  secondary-level \nschool  coverage  has  also  been  remarkable.  During  1991\u20131999,  lower  secondary  school \nenrollment  grew  from  2.7  million  to  5.8  million,  for  a  net  enrollment  rate  (NER)  of  68%.  Upper \nsecondary school enrollment also expanded rapidly, from about 700,000 to 2 million, for an NER \nof  32%.  In  1994\u20132000,  enrollment  in  lower  secondary  education  grew  by  61%,  and  upper \nsecondary,  by  202%.  Enrollments  of  males  (53%)  and  females  (47%)  are  almost  on  par.  Viet \nNam  is  making  good  progress  in  meeting  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  of  universal \nprimary education and gender equality. The Government\u2019s sector policy targets by 2010 are to \n(i) consolidate universal primary education, (ii) universalize lower secondary education, and (iii) \ngradually  expand  upper  secondary  education.1  The  Government  targets  a  nationwide  gross \nenrollment rate (GER) of upper secondary education at 45% in 2005 and at 50% in 2010. \n \n3. \nDespite  impressive  gains  in  access,  disparities  exist  by  geographic  location  and \neconomic  and  social  background,  and  much  remains  to  be  accomplished  to  achieve  these \nsector  policy  targets.  \u201cUnreached\u201d  and  poor  groups  must  be  reached,  and  education  quality \nimproved under decentralized education management.  Viet Nam remains a low-income country \nwith  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  of  $395  at  2000  prices.  Many  people  are  poor, \nwith  45%  of  the  rural  population  living  below  the  poverty  line,  typically  farmers  with  little \neducation, and upland ethnic minorities.  Ethnic minority children are particularly disadvantaged. \nIn 1999, 32% of the Kinh ethnic majority but only 8% of ethnic minorities were enrolled in upper \nsecondary schools.2 The gap between the poor and the nonpoor is also significant. According to \nthe Viet Nam Living Standard Survey (1997-1998), the GER was only 9.5% for upper secondary \nstudents from the lowest income quintile, and 75.4% for the highest.3 The poverty-related gender \ngap also widens at the upper secondary school level. In 1999, the female NER was 42.6% in the \n15 provinces with the best enrollment (top quartile), but only 20.0% in the 15 provinces with the \npoorest enrollment (bottom quartile).  \n \n4. \nImproving the quality of education is a high policy priority of the Ministry of Education and \nTraining  (MOET)  in  view  of  the  need  to  develop  a  creative,  flexible,  self-motivated, and skilled \nlabor force  for  a  knowledge-  and  market-based  economy.  A  new,  diversified  curriculum  and \ncompatible textbooks and instructional materials are thus being developed for upper secondary \neducation.  The  new,  diversified  curriculum  intends  to  encourage  active,  student-centered \nteaching and learning methods. The Project seeks to help the Government develop and improve \nupper  secondary  education  in  accordance  with  government  policies,  plans,  and  targets.4  The \nproject framework is in Appendix 1.   \n\n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Education and Training.

The sector and subsector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n6. \nThe  quality  of  teachers  needs  to  be  improved.  Although  most  possess  the  required \nformal qualifications, teachers badly need skill updating, familiarity with curricular changes, and \nnew  teaching  methods.  In-service  teacher  training  is  urgently  required.    In-class instructional \ntime is also low by international standards. Classes almost totally rely on teacher lectures. The \nGovernment plans to introduce the upper secondary curriculum, with general curriculum courses \ndesigned for the many students who will probably not proceed to the tertiary education level. To \nimprove relevance of the curriculum to the labor market, content needs to be linked to industry \ndemands. The diversified curriculum is under preparation, and try-out of new teaching methods \nand  instructional  materials  for  grade  10  will  begin  in  the  2003/04  school  year.  A  challenge  for \nquality  improvement  will  be  to  make  classroom  teaching  and  learning  active  and  student \ncentered. Internal efficiency remains low in upper secondary education. Dropping out and grade \nrepetition are common, particularly in rural and highland provinces. External efficiency is also a \nproblem, as measured by transition rates from one level to the next or by transition from school \nto work.  \n \n7. \nAccess to upper secondary education is limited to about one third of the age group (15\u2013\n17 years) and is more restrictive for ethnic minorities.  Significant disparities between rural and \nurban  enrollment  and  cycle  completion  are  found  at  the  upper  secondary  education  level.  In \n1999, NER was below the national average of 32% in predominately rural regions such as the \nNorthern  Uplands,  Central  Coast,  Central  Highlands,  and  Mekong  River  Delta.  The  GER  was \n47.52%  in  15  provinces  with  the  best  enrollment  (top  quartile)  and  only  21.37%  in  the  15 \nprovinces with the poorest enrollment (bottom quartile). Efforts to promote access and equitable \nparticipation  must  focus  on  the  provinces,  many  of  which  have  unique  economic  and  social \ncharacteristics requiring targeted responses to education issues. \n \nEnrollment  in  nonpublic  schools  is  growing  at  the  upper  secondary  education  level, \n8. \naccounting for 34% of total enrollment. Expanding nonpublic schools is an important means to \nfinance  expanded  access.  However,  other  ways  in  which  the  Government  can  support \nexpansion  must  also  be  considered  as  fees  for  upper  secondary  education  burden  poor \nhouseholds,  exceeding  their  annual  nonfood  consumption  outlay.  MOET  and  its  provincial \ndepartments  cannot  meet  all  the  education  expansion  and  quality  improvement  objectives  and \nthus need to (i) concentrate on investments that will most effectively expand access and raise \nquality;  and  (ii) develop  public-private  sector  partnerships,  including  the  option  of  establishing \npurely private schools, especially in affluent urban areas. \n \n9. \nInstitutional  capacity  for  effective  school  management  needs  to  be  strengthened  at  the \nprovincial  and  district  levels.  Managerial  capacity  is  weak  in  core  competencies  such  as \nplanning,  budget  allocation,  delivery  of  in-service  training  and  other  teacher  support  services, \nmonitoring  of  teacher  and  student  performance,  and  assessment  of  learning achievement with \nappropriate  feedback  to  teachers.  National  government  transfers  for  recurrent  budget  and \nprovincial  allocations  to  districts  should  be  rationalized  and  harmonized.  The  system  could \ncause resource shortfalls, and gaps between local plans and actual transfers.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n10. \nADB  is  supporting  lower  secondary  education  development  and  in-service  teacher \ntraining  and  lower  secondary  preservice  teacher  training  development.    Key  lessons  from  the \nongoing lower secondary education projects include the following:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nThe piloting of new curriculum and textbooks at the upper secondary education \nlevel can be shortened from 2 years to 1 since MOET has gained experience at \nthe lower secondary level. \nThe textbook loan scheme can generate income for school improvements.  \nCapacity-building  support  is  required  to  strengthen  project  management  and \nimplementation.5  \n\n \nADB  is  also  supporting  the  renovation  of  the  vocational  and  technical  education  system.6 To \nachieve  the  targets  set  forth  in  the  long-term  government  strategy,  and  other  international \ndevelopment  targets,  including  the  Millennium  Development  Goals,  the  Government  requested \nADB to help prepare the secondary education sector master plan (SESMP) as an analytical tool \nand  decision-making  guide.  The  SESMP  analyzes  issues,  policy  frameworks,  feasible \nstrategies, enrollment projections by province, financing trends, investment priorities with costed \noptions, and an implementation timetable to develop and improve secondary education.  \n \n11. \nThe  European  Union  is  supporting  improvements  in  MOET  capacity  in  sector  analysis, \nfinance,  and  management,  including  an  information  system.  The  World  Bank,  other  agencies \nfrom  Japan  and  the  United  Kingdom,  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  and \nnongovernment  organizations  have  focused  on  primary  education  and  primary  education \nteacher  training.  The  World  Bank  is  also  supporting  higher  education,  together  with  bilateral \nagencies  from  Canada,  Japan,  and  the  Netherlands.    The  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency  (JICA)  is  supporting  a  primary  education  development  plan.  Recently,  the  United \nNations  Education,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO)  began  helping  the \nGovernment prepare a national action plan for extended education for all (EFA), including early \nchildhood development, primary, lower secondary, and nonformal education. The national EFA \nplanning  process  will  integrate  findings  and  recommendations  of  JICA\u2019s  primary  education \ndevelopment  plan  and  of  SESMP.  External  assistance  to  the  education sector is described in \nAppendix 3. \n \nGiven  the  strategic  role  of  upper  secondary  education,  MOET  has  identified  three \n12. \nprimary  areas  for  its  development:  (i)  improving  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  education; \n(ii) increasing  access  to  education  in  poor  and  rural  provinces,  and  participation  of  poor  and \nethnic  minority  students;  and \nthrough \ndecentralization.  Quality  improvement  is  the  highest  policy  priority.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  will  support \nthe Government\u2019s  vision  to  modernize  the  economy  and  reduce  poverty  by  encouraging  pro-\npoor, sustainable growth and structural changes. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program will focus \neducation  sector  operations  on  helping  the  Government  achieve  universal  lower  secondary \neducation  by  2010  and  gradually  expand  upper  secondary  education  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  primary  areas  for  its  development  and  improvement.7  This  is  consistent  with \nADB\u2019s  past  operations  and  with  the  emphasis  of  other  aid  agencies  on  consolidating universal \naccess to quality primary education.  \n \n\n(iii)  making  education  management  efficient \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB. 1997.

The  Project  will \nimprove  quality,  efficiency,  access  and  equity,  and  management  capacity  in  upper  secondary \neducation  by  strengthening  quality  support  systems  nationwide  and  targeting  some  of  Viet \nNam\u2019s most economically and educationally disadvantaged. The specific project objectives are \nto  (i) improve  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  upper  secondary  education;  (ii)  promote  access, \nequity, and participation in upper secondary education; and (iii) strengthen institutional capacity, \nfrom  MOET  to  local  administration,  including  provincial  departments  of  education  and  training \n(DOETs), and bureaus of education and training at the district and school levels. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n14. \nThe Project will have three components: (i) supporting conditions for quality improvement \nin upper secondary education; (ii) improving access, equity, and participation in upper secondary \neducation  in  disadvantaged  areas;  and  (iii)  strengthening  management  of  upper  secondary \neducation.  While  all  provinces  will  be  involved  under  components  1  and  3,  the  20  most \neconomically  and  educationally  disadvantaged  provinces  will  be  under  component  2.  These \nprovinces  are  Ha  Giang,  Cao  Bang,  Lao  Cai,  Bac  Kan,  Lang  Son  and  Bac  Giang  in  the  North \nEast;  Lai  Chau,  Son  La,  and  Hoa  Binh  in  the  North  West;  Quang  Binh  on  the  North  Central \nCoast; Quang Ngai on the South Central Coast; Kon Tum, Gia Lai, and Dac Lac in the Central \nHighlands;  Ninh  Thuan  in  the  South  East;  and  Dong  Thap,  Kien  Giang,  Soc  Trang,  Bac  Lieu, \nand Ca Mau in the Mekong River Delta.8 Profiles and education data of these provinces are in \nSupplementary Appendix A. Project components are summarized briefly:   \n \n\n1.    Component  1:  Supporting  Conditions  for  Quality  Improvement  in  Upper \n\n  Secondary Education \n\n \n15. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  policy  of  improving  upper  secondary  education  through \ndevelopment,  testing,  and  dissemination  of  new  curriculums,  textbooks,  learning  materials, \nteaching  methods,  and  support  systems,  which  will  be  piloted  in  11  provinces.9  The  support \nsystems  include  learning  support  materials  and  equipment,  student  assessment,  school \nmanagement, and educational leadership and evaluation systems. Eleven technical centers for \ncomprehensive career orientation will be supported in the 11 provinces. Computer and science \nlaboratory equipment, libraries, and teaching materials will also be provided to 20 ethnic minority \nboarding  schools  (1  for  each  province)  and  61  model  schools.  Four  demonstration  schools \nattached to teacher training universities (TTUs) will be upgraded for observation and practice of \nnew  teaching  methods.  The  Project  will  also  develop  a  new  model  technical  upper  secondary \nschool  (TUSS)  and  assess  demand  for  it,  and  its  cost-effectiveness.  Component  1  has  three \nsubcomponents:  (i)  new  curriculum,  textbooks,  and  teaching  methodologies;  (ii)  provision  of \ninstructional materials and equipment; and (iii) development of quality assessment systems and \nenhanced education leadership.  \n\n                                                 \n8   Selection criteria for these 20 provinces are (i) lowest NER in the country, (ii) low GER and female GER, (iii) a large \nnumber of very poor communes and/or low human development index rating, (iv) a high number of ethnic minority \npeople,  and  (v)  relatively  high  completion  rate  in  lower  secondary  education  but  low  transition  rate  to  upper \nsecondary education.  \n\n9   Selection of the 11 pilot provinces will be based on the following criteria: (i) geographical balance\u2014north, central, \nand south provinces; (ii) socioeconomic conditions \u2014rich  and  poor  provinces;  and  (iii)  ethnic  background\u2014plain, \nmountainous, and coastal provinces.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\na. \n\nNew Curriculum, Textbooks, and Teaching Methodologies \n\n \n16. \nSince  2001,  the  Government  has  been  revising  the  curriculum  and  textbooks,  and  has \ndeveloped  a  pilot  diversified  curriculum  for  all  14  upper  secondary  education  subjects  and  is \ndeveloping  textbooks.  MOET  plans  to  introduce  a  3-year  pilot  try-out  period  starting  from the \n2003/04  school  year.  Grade-10  curriculum,  learning  materials,  and  teaching  methods  will  be \ntested during the year, then revised during the summer break. Grade-11 materials and methods \nwill  undergo  the  same  process  in  2004/05,  and  grade-12  materials  and  methods,  in  2005/06. \nNationwide  introduction  by  the  Government  will  follow  the  piloting  and  revision  for  each  grade. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  Government  policy  of  introducing  the  new  diversified  curriculum, \ntextbooks,  teachers\u2019  guides,  and  workbooks  to  around  66,000  students  during  the  pilot  try-out \nand  revision  stage  in  55  upper  secondary  schools  in  11  selected  provinces.  About  2,700 \nteachers and 55 school principals will be trained in student-centered teaching methods. Women \nteachers and principals will be given priority to achieve at least the same proportion of women \ntrainees in the overall pool of targeted teachers and principals. Four demonstration schools will \nbe upgraded for observation and practice of the new teaching methods. A multimedia  laboratory \nwill be provided with the latest production equipment to help MOET produce audio, video, and \nother  learning  support  materials.  A  framework  for  the  new  diversified  curriculum  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \nNational Assembly Decree No. 40 authorizes MOET to develop a new TUSS model. The \n17. \nProject  will  support  the  policy  by  developing  a  model  curriculum  and  learning  materials, \nproviding  management  support,  and  assessing  the  relevance  of  the  TUSS  model  to  economic \nand  social  objectives.  Four  TUSSs\u2014two  focusing  on  agriculture  and  two  on  industry  or \nservices\u2014are to be included in the pilot try-out of the TUSS model. The model schools will be \nupgraded and provided with equipment and learning materials.   \n \n18. \nOverseas short-term training will also be provided for 16 curriculum development and 16 \ninstructional  design  specialists  from  government  agencies  and/or  institutions.  The  instructional \ndesign specialists will help train 110 curriculum designers and 480 textbook writers. Consulting \nservices will be provided in curriculum development, textbook design, and instructional design. \nCurriculum  renovation  must  also  include  the  development  of  teaching  skills.  For  this  reason, \noverseas  training  will  be  provided  for  16  teacher  trainers  in  especially  designed  3-month \nprograms,  which  will  focus  on  active,  student-centered  learning  methodologies  and  combine \nacademic training with practical observation and discussions with teachers. Two groups of eight \ntrainers  will  be  sent  to  two  countries.  Trainers  will  have  backgrounds  in  physics,  chemistry, \nbiology,  history,  geography,  mathematics,  information  technology,  Vietnamese  language,  and \ntwo  other  specialties.  Upon  return  from  their  study  programs,  the  core  trainers  will  develop  in-\nservice  training  programs  for  teachers  in  the  new  curriculum  and  pedagogical  methods  in \ncollaboration  with  the  Hanoi  University  of  Education.  Training  materials  will  be  produced.  \nNationwide  training  will  be  provided  for  100  master  trainers,  1,000  core  trainers,  and  10,000 \nteachers in instructional methods and student assessment approaches to effectively deliver the \ncurriculum.  Women  trainers  and  teachers  will  be  given  priority  to  achieve  at  least  the  same \nproportion  of  women  trainers  and  teachers  in  the  overall  pool  of  the  targeted  trainers  and \nteachers.  \n \n19. \nIn the 20 disadvantaged provinces under component 2, in-service training will update the \nskills of 810 teachers in subject areas where they are assigned but not fully trained, and retrain \n3,660 teachers on new teaching methods. The teachers will be identified by the provinces and \nschools.  As the new curriculum and teaching and learning materials will be finalized for grades \n10, 11, and 12, a total of 128 teacher trainers will be trained under the Project. \n\n\f6\n\n  \n\n \n\nb. \n\nProvision of Instructional Materials and Equipment \n\n \nOnce  the  new  teaching  materials  and  approaches  have  been  tested  and  refined,  the \n20. \nGovernment  will  disseminate \nthe  Project  will  provide \ntextbooks  nationwide.  However, \ninstructional  materials,  teachers\u2019  guides  and  workbooks  to  all  upper  secondary  schools  that \nserve  the  poor  populations  in  selected  provinces;  the  schools  will  receive  120,000  sets  of \nlearning  materials,  initially  consisting  of  learning  support  materials  such  as  teaching  aids, \nposters, laboratory supplies, computers, and library materials. Where the shortage of textbooks \nfor  grades  11  and  12  is  severe,  old  textbooks  can  be  provided  temporarily  until  the  new \nmaterials become available in 2005 and 2006, respectively. \n \n21. \nEach of the 20 disadvantaged province has an ethnic minority boarding school, which the \nProject  will  support  by  providing  equipment.  The  Project  will  thus  help  the  ethnic  minority \nboarding  school  meet  the  new  standards,  including  the  career  orientation  needs  of  ethnic \nminority  students,  and  enhancement  of  technical  skills,  especially  of  ethnic  minority  students \nwho wish to work after their upper secondary education.  \n    \nThe  Project  will  supply  equipment  and  teaching  materials  for  61  model  schools  (1  for \n22. \neach province), including 2 schools which meet international standard, to the extent required for \nthe  diversified  and  streamed  curriculum.  The  schools  will  demonstrate  the  effective  use  of \ninstructional  aids  and  student-centered  teaching  methods.  The  Project  will  also  provide \nequipment  for  four  TUSSs,  which  will  support  courses  relevant  to  local  industry\u2019s  general \nrequirements  and  to  on-the-job  training  unique  to  specific  industries  and  provided  by  the \nemployers. \n \n23. \nThe  Project  will  support  four  demonstration  schools  attached  to  TTUs  to  demonstrate \nteaching  methods.  The  Project  will  provide  the  schools  with  high-standard  equipment  and \nreplace outdated equipment. \n \n24. \nTo  strengthen  career  orientation,  curriculum,  and  teaching  methods  for  tec hnical and \nvocational  activities,  the  Project  will  support  the  extension  of  11  existing  centers  in  11  try-out \nprovinces. The Project will upgrade existing vocational education centers by transforming them \ninto  centers  for  comprehensive  career  orientation.  They  will  provide  technical  and  practical \ntraining  for  upper  secondary  school  students  undertaking  optional  topics  in  career  orientation. \nThe  centers  will  be  equipped  for  skill  training  in  locally  specific  activities  such  as  agriculture, \nfishery, horticulture, forestry, engineering, and technology. \n \n\nc. \n\nDevelopment  of  Quality  Assessment  Systems  and  Enhanced \nEducation Leadership \n\nAssistance will be provided to develop, try out, and disseminate materials and programs \n25. \nto  train  school  managers  (principals  and  administrators)  in  education  leadership,  supervision, \nand school management. All public upper secondary school principals will be trained in school \nmanagement and education leadership techniques to support student-centered, active learning \napproaches.  New  student  assessment  systems  will  also  be  developed.  School  managers  and \nteachers will train in the new assessment techniques after they have been tried out and refined. \nAppropriate education evaluation and quality assessment systems will be disseminated through \nteacher and principal training programs.  \n \n26. \nDesigning strategies to improve the cost-effective delivery of education in poor and often \npredominantly  rural  areas  is  not  easy.  Ensuring  that  the  curriculum  remains  manageable  for \nteachers  and  pupils  and  allows  a  degree  of  flexibility  for  students\u2019  different  academic  ability \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nlevels and aptitudes will require systematic assessment of learning outcomes. Curricular reform \nand development will be accompanied by a pilot assessment of pupils\u2019 performance. Information \nfrom the assessment will help MOET and provincial education leaders understand the extent to \nwhich  the  reforms  are  effective.  The  assessment  of  learning  achievement  will  be  designed  to \nreveal  the  individual  student's  strengths  and  weaknesses  in  specific  skill  areas,  and  give \nvaluable feedback to the teacher about how to pace and structure lessons, for example, and to \nthe curriculum developer and textbook writer information about how well students learned what \nwas  intended  to  be  taught.  The  cost  of  the  assessment  will  be  kept  low  by  relying  on  a \nrepresentative  sample  of  students  from  participating  pilot  schools  and  new  curricular  areas. \nBaseline  data  on  student  performance  will  be  used  for  comparative  estimates  of  incremental \nlearning across different types of schools with similar student intake. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent  2:  Improving  Access,  Equity,  and  Participation  in  Upper \nSecondary Education in Disadvantaged Areas  \n\n \n27. \nComponent  2  will  help  the  20  disadvantaged  provinces  improve  access,  equity,  and \nparticipation. Special programs and support services will be provided for ethnic minority, female, \nand very poor students. Civil works for building new schools and replacing existing classrooms \nwill  provide  greater  access  to  upper  secondary  education  for  these  groups.  Component  2  has \nthree  subcomponents:  (i)  school  facilities  development;  (ii)  study  support  programs  with \nvocational orientation; and (iii) development of information, education, and communication (IEC) \nprograms. \n \n\na. \n\nSchool Facilities Development \n\n \n28. \nCivil  works,  together  with  furniture,  equipment,  and  sanitary  facilities,  will  initially \ncomprise  construction  of  2,000  schoolrooms,  including  1,484  classrooms,  130  libraries,  226 \nscience  laboratories,  and  160  computer  laboratories. Construction and replacement of school \nfacilities  in  the  districts  with  the  poorest  communes  will  be  scheduled  in  each  province  on  a \npriority  basis.  Assistance  to  the  20  provinces  will  be  provided  in  stages,  depending  upon \nreadiness and need to expand.  Construction and replacement will begin in the second year of \nthe Project and can take place during summer when school is not in session or during the school \nyear if classes will not be disrupted.  Construction will be contracted locally. \n\nStudy Support Programs with Vocational Orientation \n\n \nSpecial  study  support  programs,  including  tutorials  and  vocational  orientation,  will  be \n29. \ndeveloped  and  provided  annually  for  5,000  very  poor,  female,  and  ethnic  minority  students  to \nhelp them keep up with their studies and remain in school. 10 The study support programs will be \nprovided  by  1,000  qualified  teachers  and  other  volunteers.  Upper  secondary  teachers  in  very \npoor and ethnic minority areas will be targeted and expenses provided for them to deliver these \nprograms. \n\nDevelopment  of \nPrograms \n\nInformation,  Education  and  Communication \n\n \n30. \nThe reasons for low enrollment of the poor, ethnic minorities, and girls are complex, and \nIEC  programs  will  consider  the  sociocultural  factors  and  implications  of  direct  and  opportunity \ncosts  of  upper  secondary  schooling  for  these  groups.  IEC  programs  and  materials  will  be \ndeveloped to encourage families and girls, especially of ethnic minorities, to enter and remain in \nupper secondary schools. Materials will include print (newsletters, posters, handouts) and mass \n                                                 \n10  Further details of the study support programs are given in para. 38. \n\n \nb. \n\n \nc. \n\n\f8\n\n  \n\n \n\nmedia  (radio  and  television  programming),  and  approaches  such  as  discussion  groups, \nmeetings,  and  teacher  awareness  training.  Twenty  core  volunteer  trainers  selected  from \nteachers, the community, and NGOs will be trained; and 3,600 educators will receive awareness \ntraining.  Consultants  will  develop  IEC  programs  focusing  on  learning  needs  of  ethnic  minority \nstudents and vulnerable girls from poor families, and complementing the Government\u2019s poverty \nreduction  efforts  to  provide  scholarships  and  stipends  to  the  poor,  especially  ethnic  minority \ngirls. \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Strengthening Management of Upper Secondary Education \n\n \n31. \nUnder  the  decentralized  implementation  structure,  lower  levels  of  administration  have \ndecision-making  authority  to  allocate  resources.  However,  Viet  Nam  faces  new  challenges  in \nstrengthening  decentralized  education  management.  Component  3  will  support  government \nefforts to identify means to decentralize education management.  Five pilot initiatives will explore \nnew  approaches  to  financing  schools,  improving  school-community  partnerships,  identifying \nappropriate  administrative  roles  and  responsibilities,  managing  schools  in  difficult  areas,  and \nsocializing  (cost  sharing  in)  upper  secondary  education.  Regulatory  options  to  better  manage \nnonpublic  upper  secondary  education  will  be  examined,  and  new  information  technology, \nincluding a student-based education management information system (EMIS), will be applied to \nupper  secondary  school  management.    Project  activities  under  component  3  will  complement \nthe  public  administration  reform  program,  which  promotes  autonomy  of  MOET  and  its  lower \nadministrative bodies.11 \n \n\na. \n\nStrengthening Decentralized Upper Secondary School Management \n\n \n32. \nPilot initiatives in two provinces\u2014one richer than the other\u2014will be selected for each of \nthe  five  pilot  activities  dealing  with  approaches  to  decentralized  management:  (i)  financing  of \nschools,  (ii)  improvement  of  community-school  partnerships,  (iii)  administrative  roles  and \nresponsibilities in a decentralized environment, (iv) management of schools in difficult situations, \nand  (v)  socializing  of  upper  secondary  education  in  rural  and  remote  areas.  Thai  Binh,  Tuyen \nQuang, Yen Bai, Hoa Binh, Quang Ngai, and Ninh Thuan provinces will host the first three pilot \nactivities.  Lang  Son  province  in  the  North  East  and  Dong  Thap  province  in  the  Mekong  River \nDelta will host the pilot initiatives on school management in difficult situations and socializing of \nupper  secondary  education  in  rural  and  remote  areas.  Based  upon  the  results  of  the  pilot \ninitiatives,  decentralization  management  training  will  be  provided  to  approximately  1,400 \neducation  administrators,  school  principals,  and  members  of  community  groups  and  parents \nassociations.  Such  training  will  be  conducted  in  20  disadvantaged  provinces  involved  in \ncomponent 2, starting from the third year of project implementation.  \n\nRegulatory Options to Manage Nonpublic Upper Secondary Schools  \n\n \n33. \nIn view  of  the  recent  rapid  increase  of  nonpublic  upper  secondary  schools,  the  Project \nwill examine the options for regulating and monitoring them, including techniques and training to \nmanage  the  three  types  of  nonpublic  schools  (semigovernment,  people-funded,  and  private \nschools). The provinces involved will be Hai Phong in the Red River Delta, and Quang Ninh in \nthe North East.  Based on the findings and a thorough review of experience of other countries, \nthe Government will develop regulatory measures that will concentrate on school outputs rather \nthan on overly restrictive barriers that might inadvertently discourage nonpublic schools.   \n\n \nb. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n11 The Government of Viet Nam. 2001.

The  Project  will  also  use  the  student-based EMIS to conduct students\u2019 \nassessment, train managers, and provide software for subject teachers in TUSSs. The student-\nbased  EMIS  will  first  be  developed  in  two  provinces  to  be  identified.  The  Project  will  provide \ntraining for 126 EMIS specialists and EMIS equipment to 61 DOETs and MOET. \n \nC. \n \n35. \nA  Modular  Approach  in  Diversified  Upper  Secondary  Curriculum.  The  Project  will \nrecommend  modules  such  as  (i) generic  enterprise  and  work  education;  (ii)  health,  sex, \nHIV/AIDS,  and  gender  education;  and  (iii)  computer  and  information  technology.  The  first  will \nprovide  students  with  skills  to  complete  the  transition  from  upper  secondary  schools  to \nemployment or further education and training and to foster the desire for life-long learning.  The \nsecond will mainly help students enter adulthood by developing self-esteem, respect for self and \nothers,  rewarding  human  relationships,  and  the  joy  of  desired  parenthood.  The  third  will  teach \nstudents how to use personal computers and computer applications.  \n \n36.  Model Technical Upper Secondary Education. Support for TUSS involves a pilot try-\nout of a new type of institution in Viet Nam. TUSSs will serve a target group not served under \nthe new curriculum and provide a pool of trained persons who may contribute to human capital \nformation  in  unique  ways.  The  assumption  that  students  and  employers  demand  more \ntechnology-oriented education will be examined as part of the project evaluation by referring to \nindicators  of  external  efficiency.    While  the  comparative  analysis  of  external  efficiency  will \nrequire  tracer  studies  of  several  years,  the  Project  will  provide  interim  results  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s  consideration.  Interim  results  will  include,  among  other  things,  (i)  an  analysis  of \ncosts  and  learning  achievement  in  TUSS  schools  compared  to  general  secondary  school \nstudents,  and  (ii)  a  demand  analysis  for  TUSS  among  potential  students  and  demand  for \ngraduates among employers.  \n   \n37. \nIntegrated  Provision  of  Upper  Secondary  Education  in  Disadvantaged  Areas. The \nProject  includes  several  integrated  elements  in  the  20  disadvantaged  provinces:  (i)  in-service \nteacher  training  for  teaching  methods  based  on  student-centered,  active  learning  approaches; \n(ii)  provision  of  the  new  curriculum,  instructional  materials,  and  equipment;  (iii)  school \nconstruction  and  replacement,  and  study  support  and  IEC  programs;  and  (iv)  school \nmanagement and EMIS training. An integrated provision of education services by targeting poor, \nethnic  minority,  and  female  students  is  envisaged  to  help  reduce  poverty  in  the  most \neconomically and educationally disadvantaged areas in the country.     \n \n38. \nStudy  Support  Programs.    They  will  target  poor  students  in  the  20  provinces  under \ncomponent 2. The programs are designed to provide additional opportunities for general study \nand  vocational  orientation  when  school  is  not  in  session.  Three  special  concerns  of  the  study \nsupport programs are (i) identifying students who need support, (ii) encouraging them to attend \nthe  programs  given  their  home  and  work  commitments,  and  (iii)  evaluating  the  results  of  the \nprograms.  If  the  programs  can  keep  at-risk  students  in  school,  the  programs  should  be \nexpanded nationwide.  \n \n39. \nStudent-Based  EMIS.  An  innovation  will  be  introduced  to  EMIS,  which  is  effective  in \ngathering  fairly  accurate  data  nationwide,  which  is  not,  however,  disaggregated  by  gender, \n\n\f10\n\n  \n\n \n\nCost Estimates \n\nethnicity,  or  other  important  student  characteristics.  The  student-based  EMIS  is  designed  to \nallow tracking of individual or groups of students with special learning needs. \n \nD. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $80.0  million  equivalent,  of  which  an  estimated \n40. \n$29.9  million  or  37.4%  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  including  $2.4  million  interest  on  the \nproposed loan. The local currency cost is estimated at $50.1 million equivalent or 62.6% of the \ntotal cost.

ADB will fund 100.0% \nof  the  foreign  exchange  cost  or  37.4%  of  the  estimated  total  project  cost,  and  $25.1  million \nequivalent of the local currency cost or about 50.1% of the total local currency cost. The loan will \nhave a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1.0% per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The  remaining  $25  million \nequivalent  as  counterpart  financing  or  31.2%  of  the  total  project  cost  will  be  provided  by  the \nGovernment  ($17  million)  and  communities  ($8  million),  including  financing  in  kind  by \ncommunities, provision of land for new schools and facilities, provision of materials and labor for \nsmall civil works, taxes and duties, and operation and maintenance of project facilities.  \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nForeign Exchange     Local Currency    Total Cost \n\n \n \n \n \n\n25.1 \n17.0 \n8.0 \n50.1 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n55.0 \n17.0 \n8.0 \n80.0 \n\n% \n69 \n21 \n10 \n100 \n\nSources \nADB \nGovernment \nCommunity \n        Total \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n29.9 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n29.9 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n42. \nThe  provision  of  financing  for  local  currency  cost  of  about  $25.1  million  equivalent  is \nconsidered  justified  under  ADB's  local  currency  financing  policy.12  From  an  economic \nperspective,  assistance  is  required  to  meet  the  local  currency  cost  of  development  projects \nbecause a low level of per capita income hinders national savings and puts public finance under \npressure.  The  Government  is  enhancing  revenue  collection  and  improving  the  efficiency  of \npublic  expenditure  and  incentives  for  private  sector  participation  in  revenue-generating  public \nsector  projects.  Although  these  efforts  are  expected  to  increase  national  savings, a significant \nresource gap will continue for some time because the country needs large capital investments. \nThus,  ADB  assistance  for  project-related  local  currency  expenditures  is  economically  justified. \nFrom  a  technical  perspective,  the  high  level  of  financing  of  local  currency  cost  is  justified \nbecause  (i)  many  small  civil  works  are  scattered  over  numerous  rural  sites,  which  will  utilize \nlocally produced construction materials; and (ii) the Project is funding the delivery of in-country \ntraining programs, and recruitment of domestic consultants. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nA  National  Project \n\n43. \nAs Executing Agency, MOET will have overall responsibility for project coordination and \nimplementation. An Interagency Steering Committee (IASC) will provide overall guidance to the \nProject, monitor its activities and outputs, and help coordinate and liaise with other government \nagencies. Members will be MOET representatives, including from the departments of secondary \neducation,  planning  and  finance,  and  teachers;  National  Institute  for  Educational  Science; \nMinistries of Planning and Investment, Ministry of Finance; State Bank of Viet Nam; and Office \nof Government. The IASC will be chaired by a MOET vice minister.  \n \n44. \nIm plementation  Unit  (NPIU)  will  oversee  day-to-day  project \nimplementation,  and  consist  of  a  manager,  a  deputy  manager,  and  staff  appointed  by  MOET. \nThe  NPIU  manager  will  be  a  member  of  IASC  and  report  directly  to  it.  Six  specialists  for \nadministration  and  finance,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  civil  works,  procurement,  textbook \ndevelopment, and staff development will assist the NPIU manager. Other members of the NPIU \nwill  be  senior  staff  of  concerned  MOET  departments  and  institutes,  assigned  to  implement \nproject  activities  at  the  central  level.  Two  international  consultants  (one  management  advisor \nand  one  midterm  review  specialist)  and  two  domestic  consultants  (one  project  management \nspecialist  and  one  monitoring  and  evaluation  specialist)  will  assist  the  NPIU.  It  will  also  have \nadministrative  staff:  secretaries,  translators,  a  finance  officer,  and  other  support  staff.  \nEquipment and operating resources for the NPIU will be provided under the Project. The NPIU \nwill have overall responsibility for project planning, budgeting, monitoring, and reporting; various \nstudies; and coordination of the work of the provincial project implementation units (PPIUs). The \ncurriculum, textbook, in-service training, and other subcomponents will be supported through the \nGovernment\u2019s  scheme  to  implement  the  diversified  curriculum,  and  will  be  managed  and \nimplemented by the NPIU. It will also coordinate the work of consultants.  \n \n45.  Many  project  activities  will  be  delegated  to  DOETs,  and  will  be  implemented  within  the \nexisting administrative structure. PPIUs\u2014one in each of the selected project provinces\u2014will be \nset  up  in  existing  DOETs  to  coordinate,  plan,  implement,  monitor,  and  supervise  project \nactivities,  and  report  on  them  to  the  NPIU  at  the  provincial  level.  The  PPIU  will  consist of a \nprovincial  project  manager  and  basic  administrative  staff  designated  from  existing  DOET \npersonnel,  with  support  provided  by  various  specialist  staff  from  provincial  government \ndepartments as required. PPIUs will undertake general project management and implementation \nactivities,  and  be  responsible  for  managing  and  implementing  in-service  teacher  training, \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 1995.

Decentralized school management will be the responsibility of DOETs in the selected \nprovinces.  PPIUs  will  report  to  the  NPIU  on  progress  and  results  of  activities  under  their \nmanagement and implementation. Project management and implementation capacity of DOETs \nand  PPIUs  will  be  further  developed  by  an  ADB-financed  advisory  technical  assistance \n \nprogrammed in 2003. Project management and implementation structure are in Appendix 5. \n\n \n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n \n46. \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years,  from  early  2003  to  June  2009.  The \n\n47. \nAll  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  and  procurement  of  teachers\u2019  guides  will  follow \ngovernment procedures acceptable to ADB. The NPIU, in close coordination with the PPIUs, will \nbe responsible for all procurement. The indicative procurement package is in Appendix 7. \n \n\na. \n\nEquipment and Materials \n\n \n48. \nSupply contracts for goods estimated at $500,000 equivalent or more will be awarded on \nthe basis of international competitive bidding. Supply contracts for goods such as vehicles and \ncomputers (other than instructional materials) of less than $500,000 but more than $100,000 will \nfollow international shopping procedures. Supply contracts for instructional materials of less than \n$500,000 but more than $100,000 will follow local completive bidding (LCB) procedures. Minor \nitems  costing  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  may  be  procured  by  direct  purchase.  Supply \ncontracts for teachers\u2019 guides may be awarded to the Education Publishing House on the basis \nof  direct  selection.  Details  of  procurement  packages  and  technical  specifications  will  be \nsubmitted for ADB approval before procurement.  \n\n \nb. \n\nCivil Works \n\n \n49. \nProject civil works will consist of construction and replacement of school classrooms and \nfacilities.  The  estimated  unit  cost  is  $10,000  per  classroom/facility,  including  design  and \nconstruction  supervision.  The  civil  works  are  spread  over  upper  secondary  schools  in  20 \ndisadvantaged provinces. The civil works component will be financed by ADB and government \nand  community  beneficiaries  and  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  LCB,  following  government \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. The PPIU will ensure correct implementation of the civil works.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\n \n50. \nProvisions for consultants have been kept to a minimum. The Project will use consultants \nto  develop  quality  support  systems  nationally;  improve  access,  equity,  and  participation  in \ndisadvantaged  provinces;  and  strengthen  management  of  upper  secondary  education.  \nApproximately 56 person-months of international and 154 person-months of domestic consulting \nwill  be  needed.  International  consultants  will  be  needed  for  curriculum  and  textbook \ndevelopment,  teaching  methods,  learning  materials  and  equipment,  evaluation,  and  quality \nassessment  (component  1);  study  support  programs  (component  2);  and  EMIS  development \n(component  3).  Domestic  consultants  will  be  needed  in  curriculum  and  textbook  development, \nteaching  methods,  learning  materials  and  equipment,  evaluation,  and  quality  assessment \n(component 1); IEC, social development, and gender and ethnic minority education (component \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2);  and  EMIS  development  (component  3).  Project  implementation  will  require  the  services  of \ninternational and domestic NPIU advisers to help set up financial management system, manage \nprocurement,  train  staff,  and  coordinate  consultants\u2019  inputs.  Project  implementation  will  also \nrequire  consulting  services  in  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  and  midterm \nreview.  All  ADB-financed  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged \nby  the  Government  through  a  firm,  using  quality-  and  cost-based selection and in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines  on  the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nconcerning  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  award  of  subcontract  services  for \nADB-financed  learning  assessment,  studies,  evaluation,  pilot  initiatives,  or  any  activity  for  an \namount  greater  $75,000  equivalent  will  need  ADB\u2019s  prior  approval.  The  NPIU,  under  the \nguidance  of  the  IASC,  will  act  as  liaison  between  ADB  and  consultants.    Consulting  service \nrequirements and outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 8.   \n \n\n5. \n\nTraining  \n\n \n51. \nExtensive in-country and limited overseas training will be provided under the Project with \na  total  of  about  1  million  in-country  person-days  and  about  4,500  overseas  person-days.  In-\ncountry  and  overseas  fellowship  training  programs  will  be  provided  to  upgrade  the  skills, \nknowledge,  and  experience  of  qualified  individuals  who  will  be  implementing  the  project \ncomponents. Overseas short-term  training  will  focus  on  specialized  subjects  related  to  quality \nimprovement  programs  under  the  Project.  The  Government  will  establish  and  submit  criteria \nacceptable  to  ADB  on  the  award  of  overseas  fellowships.  ADB  will  be  provided  with  a  list  of \n(i) the  nominated  candidates,  (ii)  their  qualifications,  (iii) nominated  institutions  and  agencies, \nand (iv) detailed cost of the proposed courses.  ADB approval will be required before the award \nof  overseas  fellowships.  In-country  training  will  be  held  at  MOET/DOET  facilities  or  other \nrelevant training institutions selected from among reputable training institutions, on a contractual \nbasis.    Priority  will  be  given  to  women  participants  to  achieve  at  least  the  same  proportion  of \nwomen as in the overall pool of the targeted candidates. Staff development (training) program is \nin Appendix 9. \n \nPilot Initiatives \n\n6. \n\n \nComponent 3 will involve five action-oriented pilot initiatives to be implemented in three \n52. \nphases. Phase 1 (design) will begin with a review of regulations and conclude with a review and \napproval of the pilot initiative design by the IASC and NPIU. Phase 2 (implementation) will begin \nwith  preparation  of  programs  and  materials  for  orientation/training  of  provincial  staff  to  be \nincluded in pilot initiatives and conclude with monitoring and evaluation of implementation of pilot \ninitiatives.  Phase  3  (reporting)  will  begin  with  analysis  of  the  results  of  pilot  initiatives  and \nconclude  with  submission  of  the  final  report  with  recommendations.  Pilot  initiatives  are  in \nAppendix 10. \n \n \n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n53. \nThe  Government  will  provide  funds  to  MOET  through  budget  allocations.  To  expedite \nproject  implementation  through  the  timely  release  of  ADB\u2019s  funds  for  eligible  expenditures,  a \ndollar imprest account will be established by the Government, at a commercial bank designated \nby  the  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  and  acceptable  to  ADB,  within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness. \nThe  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  dated  January  2001.  The  imprest  account,  with  a \nceiling amount of $2.0 million, will be utilized for eligible project expenditures. In view of the large \nnumber  of  small  contracts  involved,  the  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  used  for \nexpenditures of $100,000 or less. \n\n \n\n\f14\n\n  \n\n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting and Auditing \n\n \n54.  MOET  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  to  identify  goods  and  services  financed  from \nthe loan proceeds. Project accounts, including financial statements, statement of expenditures, \nand  imprest  account  records  will  be  audited  annually  by  independent  external  auditors \nacceptable to ADB. The auditors\u2019 report and copies of the certified accounts and related financial \nstatements,  including  the  auditors\u2019  opinion  on  the  use  of  loan  proceeds,  compliance  with  loan \ncovenants,  and  use  of  the  imprest  account under ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure, \nwill be submitted to ADB in English not later than 9 months after the close of the Governments\u2019 \nfiscal year.  The independent external auditing services will be financed from the loan proceeds. \n\n \n\n9.  \n\nReporting   \n\n \nThe  NPIU  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  project  implementation  and  submit  them  to \n55. \nADB  within  30  days  after  each  quarter.  The  reports  will  be  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB  and \nwill  indicate,  among  other  things,  the  progress  made  against  established  targets,  problems \nencountered during the last quarter, steps taken and proposed to resolve problems, compliance \nwith loan covenants, and proposed program of activities for the succeeding quarter. The NPIU \nwill  compile  the  provincial  reports  into  a  quarterly  report  to  be  submitted  to  MOET  and  ADB.   \nWithin 3 months after physical completion of the Project, the NPIU will submit to ADB a project \ncompletion report on project implementation, accomplishments, benefits, and impact. \n \n\n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nthe  project  cycle.  Project  performance  monitoring  will \n\nThe monitoring and recording system and procedures will be reviewed and improved.  A \n56. \nnew  project  performance  management  system  will  be  developed  and  institutionalized  within \nMOET to monitor and evaluate implementation performance and development impact at various \nstages  of \nfocus  upon  project \nimplementation  plans  and  targets  and  their  execution  and  achievement.  Performance \nevaluations will examine the impact of project interventions (such as improved participation and \ncompletion rates due to civil works or provision of equipment and learning materials, transition to \nhigher  levels  of  education,  employment  after  graduation);  problems  and  constraints  faced;  and \ntheir reasons and solutions. The NPIU will monitor project activities, using data primarily from the \nprovincial reports and periodic studies. PPIUs will submit monthly, quarterly, and annual reports \non  indicators,  including  training  outputs,  construction  and  replacement  targets,  student \nenrollment  and  completion  targets,  and  provision  of  learning  materials  and  equipment.  PPIUs \nwill also make monthly visits to field sites supported by the Project, and submit field visit reports \nto the NPIU.  Project performance and monitoring indicators are in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n \n \n57. \nADB  and  the  Government  will  jointly  undertake  semiannual  project  reviews  to  assess \nprogress  in  each  component,  identify  difficulties  or  constraints,  and  help  determine  ways  to \novercome  them.  Before  each  review,  the  NPIU,  in  coordination  with  PPIUs,  will  prepare  a \nprogress report based on the quarterly report and submitted to ADB and the Government.  \n \n58. \nADB  and  the  Government  will  conduct  a  midterm  review  during  the  last  quarter  of  the \nthird  year  of  project  implementation  to  inform  planning  for  the  second  half  of  the  Project.  The \nmidterm  review  will  (i)  review  the  scope,  design,  and  project  implementation  arrangements; \n(ii) identify  changes  needed;  (iii)  assess  performance  against  targets  and  benchmarks; \n(iv) review lessons and experiences in upper secondary education development, focusing on the \ncurriculum,  textbooks,  and  teaching  and  learning  methods;  (v)  review  compliance  with  loan \n\nProject Review \n\n11. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nagreements;  and  (vi)  recommend  changes \nimplementation \narrangements.  The  findings  will  be  discussed  at  the  midterm  workshop  to  be  attended  by \nrepresentatives from concerned government agencies, including Ministry of Finance, Ministry of \nPlanning  and  Investment,  and  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam,  MOET,  DOETs,  the  consultants,  and \nADB. \n \n\nin  project  design  and/or \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n1. \n\nEducational Benefits  \n\n \n59. \nThe  educational  benefits  are  project  outputs  that  directly  or  indirectly  impact on upper \nsecondary education in particular and the education system in general. The Project will upgrade \nthe  upper  secondary  education  subsector  to  produce  educated  and  skilled  graduates  who  can \nmeet the requirements of the Vietnamese economy nationally and internationally. Enhancing the \nquality  and  efficiency  of  upper  secondary  education  by  providing  better  physical  facilities, \nequipment, and supply of adequate instructional materials will attain this objective. The Project \nwill  support  government-funded  try-out  and  revisions  of  new  curriculum,  textbooks,  and \ninstructional materials in 11 try-out provinces. Improved teacher training and effective classroom \nsupervision, and school management are envisaged to enhance student learning, using student-\ncentered, active learning approaches.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Benefits \n\n \nThe  social  benefits  are  outcomes  that  may  improve  the  social  conditions  in  the \n60. \ncommunity where the project schools are located.  Under component 2, the Project will support \nconstruction and rehabilitation of school facilities, including classrooms, toilets, laboratories, and \nlibraries.  This  support  will  make  access  and  participation  in  upper  secondary  education  more \nattractive to the poor, ethnic minorities and girls. Women make up 55% of all upper secondary \nschoolteachers.    Females  account  for  47%  of  all  upper  secondary  students.  On  the  basis  of \ngender  participation  in  upper  secondary  education  by  DOET  officials,  principals,  teachers,  and \nstudents,  approximately  45%  of  all  beneficiaries  will  be  female.  The  provision  of  special  study \nsupport  programs  and  tutorials  to  poor,  ethnic  minority,  and  female  students  will  improve  their \ncompetitive advantage over the other students.  \n \n\n3. \n\nEfficiency Benefits \n\n \n61. \nThe Project will ensure that upper secondary education is responsive to local needs. The \nProject will, for example, ensure that schools are at least the minimum size and located where \nthey are needed, and that communities are able to maintain and support them.  The Project will \nalso  ensure  that  the  schools  have  learning  materials,  and  educational  leadership  and \nmanagement support. The Project will train new and existing teachers in practical and student-\ncentered  teaching  methods.  The  diversified  upper  secondary  schools  will  focus  on  optional \nmodules  in  career  orientation;  information  technology;  and  health,  sex,  HIV/AIDS,  and  gender \neducation. The student-centered teaching methods and other improvements in the instructional \nprocess will raise student learning and add to the perception by students and their parents that \nthey are getting good value for time spent in school, and thus encourage students to remain in \nschool until graduation and continue in successive levels of education. Low internal and external \nefficiencies should be overcome through project interventions.   \n\n \n\n\f16\n\n  \n\n \n\n4. \n\nDirect Beneficiaries \n\n \n62. \nThe beneficiaries of component 1 will be all upper secondary education students in the \ncountry  (about  5  million  during  the  Project)  who  will  have  access  to  modern,  interesting,  and \nrelevant  curriculum  and  learning  materials.  The  Project  targets  approximately  66,000  students \nduring  the  pilot  try-out  and  revision  of  the  curriculum  and  textbooks  in  55  upper  secondary \nschools in the 11 selected provinces. Female students will benefit from gender-sensitive learning \nmaterials.  While  the  curriculum  is  being  developed,  100  master  teachers,  1,000  core  trainers, \nand  about  18,600  teachers  will  receive  training;  about  230,000  poor  students  will  benefit  from \naccess  to  improved  instructional  materials  in  the  11  selected  provinces.  Development  of  new \ntechnical schools will benefit employers, who will have a source of well-trained employees, and \nTUSS  students,  who  will  have  job  opportunities.  Under  component  2,  poor,  ethnic  minority, \nand/or female students in the 20 disadvantaged provinces will be direct beneficiaries. Provision \nof  about  1,500  classrooms  either  constructed  or  replaced  will  benefit  approximately  120,000 \nstudents; and 22,500 poor, ethnic minority, and/or female students needing learning assistance \nwill  attend  special  study  support  programs.  One  thousand  teachers  will  be  trained  to  provide \nthese  programs  and  will  benefit  from  financial  assistance.  Another  810  more  teachers  will \nreceive  in-service  training  to  update  their  teaching  skills  in  the  diversified  curriculum.  IEC \nprograms  will  benefit  ethnic  minority  girls,  who  will  be  encouraged  to  attend  upper  secondary \nschools. Component 3 will benefit communities by allowing them to form close relationships with \ntheir  schools  and  by  ensuring  that  public  and  nonpublic  schools  are  managed  well.  Pilot \ninitiatives  in  community-school  partnerships  and  school  management  in  difficult  situations  will \nlead  to  efficiency  gains  and  resource  mobilization  for  schools.  About  1,400  education \nadministrators, school principals, and members of community groups and parents associations \nwill receive management training. \n \nB. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  financial  sustainability  depends  on  ongoing  reforms  of  the  Government's \n63. \neducation finance policy and, to a lesser degree in the short term, on the continued growth of the \nVietnamese economy. Recurrent spending must be at regional standard levels to ensure that (i) \nteachers  have  incentives  to  remain  in  poor  provinces,  (ii)  new  teachers  are  hired  to  meet \ngrowing enrollment, and (iii) project investments in new and rehabilitated school facilities will be \nproperly  maintained.  The  Project  is  designed  to  minimize  recurrent  cost  implications  for  the \nGovernment  and  households.  The  Project  will  have  limited  impact  on  the  government  budget, \nunder the following assumptions: (i) education expenditure will stay at over 3% of GDP and 15% \nof government expenditure throughout the Project; and (ii) incremental recurrent costs after the \nProject will be maintained  at minimal levels ($800,000 per annum thereafter), and increases will \nbe  contained  through  allocation  of  existing  resources.    Of  the  project  cost  of  $80  million,  ADB \nwill  finance  $55  million,  and  the  Government,  $25  million.  The  Government\u2019s  annual  share  in \nproject cost will average around $4.2 million or D63,000 million equivalent or about 0.2% of the \nupper  secondary  education  average  annual  budget  of  about  $212  million  or  D3,200  billion. \nGiven  that  the  upper  secondary  education  annual  budget  averaged  10%  of  the  total  education \nbudget  over  the  last  5  years,  the  budgetary  impact  of  the  estimated  annual  recurrent  costs \nduring  and  after  project  implementation  is  considered  minimal.  A  summary  of  financial \nsustainability analysis is in Appendix 11. \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Sustainability Analysis \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n64. \nPublic and private investment has been substantial at all levels of education for the last \ntwo decades. Increased spending on education at all levels has directly increased access to and \nparticipation  in  it.  From  school  years  1996/97  to  2001/02,  primary  education  enrollment \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment and Resettlement \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures \n\nincreased by 16%, lower secondary by 37%, and upper secondary by 115%. The Government\u2019s \ngoal  is  to  gradually  expand  upper  secondary  education  by  2010  to  provide  the  level  of  human \nresources  required  for  industrialization  and  economic  modernization.  The  socioeconomic, \npolitical,  and  cultural  climate  calls  for  a  redesign  of  educational  objectives,  content,  and \nmethods.  To  achieve  a  sustainable  level  of  economic  growth  and  to  prosper  in  a  globally \ncompetitive environment, Viet Nam needs to increase its human capital base by raising the level \nof  general  education  together  with  problem-solving  skills  and  the  ability  to  adapt  to  a  rapidly \nchanging  labor  market.    The  Project  will  draw  the  curriculum  away  from  near-total  reliance on \nrote  memorization  to  student-centered,  inquiry-based,  and  problem-solving  instruction.  The \nquality  of  instructional  materials  will  be  improved  and  matched  to  the  curriculum  and  teaching \nmethods.  Access  will  be  expanded  to  previously  underserved  populations,  including  the  rural \npoor, ethnic minorities, and girls. School management will become more efficient and effective. \nThe Project is expected to yield substantial economic benefits. A summary of the economic and \nlabor market analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \nD. \n \n \n \n65. \nThe Project\u2019s environmental impacts were reviewed, and no significant adverse impacts \nidentified. However, any environmental consideration will be incorporated into all  project-funded \nschool construction and replacement during implementation. The designs of the new schools will \nrequire  minimum  maintenance.  Construction  of  buildings  and  replacement  of  old  ones  will  not \nnegatively  impact  the  environment.  Water  supply  (for  drinking  and  toilets)  to  promote  good \nhealth and environmental sanitation for students and teachers will also be emphasized.  \n \n66. \nConstruction  of  new  schools  will  be  carried  out  on  vacant  public  land  or  commune \nreserve land. In the event no vacant public land is available and community or household land \nmight  be  needed,  a  detailed  community  decision-making  process  for  site  selection  must  be \nstrictly followed to safeguard the communities\u2019 interests. First, the commune will identify possible \nland  through  a  process  of  household  level  consultation,  including  a  process  of  grievance \nredress.  Second,  the  district  people\u2019s  committee  will  confirm  that  (i)  the  land  selected  has  no \nhousing  or  enterprises,  no  encroachers  or  squatters;  (ii)  the  contribution  of  land  by  any  one \nhousehold is not more than 5% of the household\u2019s total landholding; (iii) the contributors are not \npoor;  (iv)  the  commune  will  guarantee  to  replace  any  lost  assets  at  replacement  cost  and \nreplace  any  lost  income/livelihoods,  and  compensation  to  be  paid  will  be  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement;13  and  (v) the  people  affected  will  provide  verbal  or \nwritten agreement to the arrangement. The PPIUs will check each case before the award of civil \nworks contracts that these procedures are followed and provide a written report to ADB together \nwith contract documentation for ADB\u2019s endorsement prior to the award of civil works contracts.  \nADB review missions will make spot checks to ensure that the community site selection process \nhas been followed. \n\n \n2. \n\nSocial Analysis \n\n \n67. \nThe  Project  does  not  have  any  adverse  social  impact.  A  detailed  social  analysis  was \nundertaken during project preparation. The Project is classified as a poverty intervention and is \nexpected to raise incomes of families in the 20 targeted provinces. Students who graduate from \nupper  secondary  schools  are  likely  to  be  more  productive  than  their  parents  with  lower \neducational  qualifications.  The  improvement  of  teaching  methods,  student-centered textbooks, \ndiversified  curriculum,  student  and  quality  assessment,  and  educational  leadership  will  benefit \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. In Handbook on Resettlement (Appendix 1). Manila. \n\n\f18\n\n  \n\n \n\nProject Risks \n\nstudents nationally. Updating teaching methods will improve (i) creativity, self reliance, problem-\nsolving ability, flexibility, and life-long learning ability of all students; and (ii) practical knowledge \nand  understanding,  skills,  attitudes,  and  values  to  prepare  students  for  further  studies  and/or \ntraining  or  jobs.  Nationwide,  47%  of  upper  secondary  students  are  females,  but  lower  in  the \ntargeted  provinces  under  component  2.  Improved  access  to  and  participation  in  education, \nespecially  for  ethnic  minority  females,  are  expected  to  have  significant  social  consequences \nsuch as widespread adoption of preventive primary health care measures; greater acceptance of \nfamily planning methods; and an understanding of HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, and \ndrugs.  A  summary  poverty  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  13,  and  a  gender  and  ethnic \nminorities action plan prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policies on Gender and Development \nand Indigenous Peoples is in Appendix 14.  \n \nE. \n \n68. \nThe Project covers a diversified curriculum and compatible textbooks, in-service teacher \ntraining, construction and replacement of school facilities, and management activities. With such \na  large  student  population  served  by  so  many  teachers,  not  all  classrooms  will  have  teachers \ntrained  to  teach  the  new  curriculum,  textbooks,  or  instructional  materials  at  the  beginning  of  a \nschool year.  MOET is aware of the risk and allows some flexibility in the schedule. The Project \nwill also build on and collaborate with existing systems at the DOET level for in-service teacher \ntraining and civil works. During the transition, teachers will continue to rely on familiar teaching \nmethods.  However,  most  teachers  are  willing  to  accept  new  teaching  methods  and  will  try  to \nadopt  them.  Risks  involved  in  improving  access,  equity,  and  participation  of  upper  secondary \nstudents  in  disadvantaged  areas  are  that  (i)  qualified  teachers  and  volunteers  to  conduct  the \nspecial study support programs are lacking, and (ii) school sites in provinces may not be in the \nneediest areas.  During project preparation, detailed discussions were held with DOETs, and the \nselection  criteria  carefully  developed.  To  minimize  the  risks  involved  in  civil  works,  PPIUs  will \nutilize  the  services  of  provincial  construction  engineers  to  supervise  civil  works  and  budgets, \nundertake fieldwork, and hold consultative meetings. \n \n\nV.

Further,  the \nGovernment,  through  MOET,  will  undertake  periodic  surveys,  in  the  third  and \nsixth year of project implementation, to monitor relevant indicators and to institute \nrevision or improvement in implementation schemes, where necessary. \n\n \n(iii)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government, through MOET, will have \ndesignated one model upper secondary school for each of the 61 provinces, and \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nsubmit to ADB a list containing the names and location of the designated model \nupper secondary schools. \n\n(iv)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government, through MOET, will have \nestablished  and  submitted  criteria  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the  selection  of \ncandidates for overseas training. \n\n(v)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government,  through  MOET,  will \nidentify the first year of school construction and replacement program as set out \nunder component 2 of the Project.  \n\n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n(x) \n\n \n(xi) \n\nThe Government, through MOET, will ensure that new schools to be constructed \nare  precisely  located  by  school  mapping  in  areas  requiring  access  for  lower \nsecondary  graduates  from  poor,  ethnic  minority  and  disadvantages  areas,  and \nthat the school mapping is completed at least 1  year prior to construction of new \nschools. Further, the Government, through MOET, will submit to ADB the details \nof  school  construction  and  replacement  program  at  least  1  year  prior  to  the \ncommencement of the program. \n\nThe Government and the MOET will ensure that construction of new schools will \nbe  carried  out  on  vacant  public  land  or  commune  reserve  land.  In  the  event  no \nvacant  public  land  is  available  and  community  or  household  land  might  be \nneeded,  a  detailed  community  decision-making  process  for  site  selection  as \nspecified  in  the  project  design  must  be  strictly  followed.  Further,  in  the  event \ncompensation  must  be  paid,  as  a  consequence  of  the  use  of  community  or \nhousehold  land,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  compensation  will  be  paid  in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. \n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  the  continuation  of  the  existing  textbook  lending \nscheme  to  ensure  that  improved  textbooks  for  the  new  curriculum  are  made \naccessible to poor and disadvantaged students in all priority provinces. \n\n \n(ix)  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government,  through  MOET,  will \nsubmit  to  ADB  the  names  of  the  participating  provinces  in  the  pilot  initiatives  as \nrequired under component 3 of the Project. \n\nThe  Government  will  establish,  by  the  end  of  2005,  a  student-based EMIS that \nwill  enable  the  tracking  of  upper  secondary  graduates  in  both  higher  education \nand \nthe \nimplementation of diversified curricula.  \n\nthe  work  environment  and  generate \n\nimproving \n\nfeedback \n\nfor \n\nThe Government, through MOET, will ensure priority be given to the gender and \nethnic minority development through the implementation of the gender and ethnic \nminorities  action  plan,  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policies on Gender \nand Development and Indigenous Peoples. The Government, through MOET, will \nfurther ensure that (a) in selecting the participants for all training activities, priority \nwill be given to women to achieve participation of women in each training activity \nat a level at least proportionate to their representation in the groups of candidates \nfrom among whom the selection is made; and (b) in order to increase the quality \nand  access  of  upper  secondary  education  received  by  ethnic  minorities,  ethnic \nminorities  will  have  equal  opportunities  to  participate  in  training  activities.

Education  administration  is  shared  among  the  central,  provincial,  and  district \ngovernments,  and  communes,  with  centralized  decision  making  and  decentralized \nimplementation.  The  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training  (MOET)  is  responsible  for  all  policy \nformulation,  guidance,  and  supervision.  Upper  secondary  education  is  administered  by  the \nprovincial  department  of  education  and  training  under  the  supervision  of  MOET  and  provincial \npeople\u2019s  committees.  The  Government  is  the  main  provider  of  upper  secondary  education  in \nrural  and  remote  areas,  while  upper  secondary-level  enrollment  is  increasingly  covered  by \nnonpublic schools, especially in urban areas.  \n \nThe  general  public  education  system  has  expanded  rapidly  over  the  last  decade. \n2. \nPrimary  education  is  nearly  universal,  with  the  net  enrollment  rate  at  95%  in  2000.  In  1994\u2013\n2000, lower secondary education enrollment increased by 61%, and upper secondary education \nenrollment, by 202%. In 2001/02, 2.3 million students were enrolled in upper secondary schools, \nand the gross enrollment rate (GER) was 38%. While enrollment in lower secondary schools will \npeak in 2006 and begin to decline due to the falling number of children in the lower secondary \nschool  age  bracket,  upper  secondary  education  enrollment  is  projected  to  increase  through \n2010.1 The Government targets a nationwide upper secondary education GER of 45% in 2005 \nand 50% in 2010. \n \n3. \nIn many of the 61 provinces, the 2005 target for upper secondary enrollment has already \nbeen or will be attained. However, the top-quartile and bottom-quartile provinces have different \nenrollment rates. The 15 provinces with the lowest enrollment rates have the greatest poverty, \ndifficult topography, and a larger proportion of ethnic minorities than the 15 provinces with the \nhighest enrollment rates. The average GER for upper secondary education was 47.5% in 2000, \nbut  only  21.4%  in  the  bottom-quartile  provinces.  Efforts  to  increase  participation  in  upper \nsecondary  education  should  clearly  focus  on  the  provinces  with  the  most  difficult  conditions. \nEquity  in  providing  upper  secondary  education  has  also  improved.  Female  gross  enrollment \nincreased  from  21%  in  1996/97  to  27%  in  1999/00.  However,  regional  disparities  in  gender \nequity  are  also  a  problem.  Female  GER  in  the  top  quartile  was  42.6%  but  only  20.0%  in  the \nbottom  quartile.  More  poor  children  are  in  upper  secondary  school,  but  their  participation \nremains low. In 1998, 64.1% of children from the richest quintile (20%) of the population were in \nupper secondary school but only 4.5% from the poorest.  \n \nRepetition  and  dropout  rates  have  improved  nationwide  in  the  past  decade.  The \n4. \ncompletion rate in upper secondary education rose from 61.7% in 1991/92 to 78.4% in 1999/00. \nHowever, in the lowest quartile, repetition and dropout rates increased from 1996/97 to 1999/00. \nFor  the  highest  and  lower  quintiles,  student-teacher  ratios  were  similar  at  around  30:1  in \n1999/00, as were student-class ratios. The ratio of teachers per class showed a wider disparity. \nThe  standard  is  two  teachers  per  class  for  upper  secondary  education.  The  top-quartile \nprovinces have 1.6, but the lowest-quartile provinces have only 1.0.  \n \nPublic expenditure for education has increased significantly from 1.8% of gross domestic \n5. \nproduct  (GDP)  in  1992  to  3.5%  in  1998,  but  the  picture  is  incomplete  without  reference  to \nanother  dramatic  increase:  in  private  contribution.  Household  expenditure  on  education \nincreased from 1.7% of GDP in 1992 to 3.4% in 1998. In 1998, the private share of expenditure \non upper secondary education was 69%, placing Viet Nam near the top of all countries in this \ncategory and illustrating how great demand is as well as the Government\u2019s inability to finance \n                                                 \n1   ADB and MOET. February 2002.  Secondary Education Sector Master Plan (Final Report), Volume I: Main Report. \n\nHanoi. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26\n\n  \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nexpansion  from  purely  public  resources.  Expenditure  per  student  or  unit  cost  of  primary  and \nlower secondary education is nearly the same\u2014a departure from the typical case, where each \nsuccessive level is much more costly than the previous one. Expenditure per student for upper \nsecondary education was lower than that for lower secondary education in 2000/01 (D260,000 \nvs. D264,000).  High household outlay to meet children\u2019s education needs does not denote the \npresence  of  either  private  schools  or  even  high  levels  of  household  involvement  in  school \naffairs, which are low.  \n \nFew  direct  indicators  are  available  to  assess  education  quality.  Enrollment  expansion \n6. \ndoes not mean student learning. Because Viet Nam has no tradition of periodic assessments of \nlearning achievement, how much of the curriculum is mastered by which students is unknown.  \nHowever, indirect indicators include (i) qualified teachers, who make up 95% of all teachers; and \n(ii)  study  hours  per  week  (31.59)  for  the  35-week  school  year,  or  about  800  hours  per  year, \nwhich is low by international standards (900\u20131,200 hours per year). Depending on the indicator \nused, therefore, Viet Nam ranks low or high. Physical facilities are inadequate and frequently in \npoor  repair.  Other  facilities  such  as  desks,  bookshelves,  and  so  forth  are  either  lacking  or  in \npoor condition. Less than 20% of schools had chemistry, biology, or language laboratories. Only \n25%  had  physics  laboratories.  Boarding  and  specialized  schools  had  the  most  facilities, \nfollowed  by  public  schools.  Semipublic  and  people-founded schools had  the  least  amount  of \nfacilities. Nearly all specialized, boarding, and public schools had computer laboratories.  \n \n7. \nMOET places high priority on improving education quality to prepare a creative, flexible, \nself-motivated,  and  skilled  labor  force.  A  diversified  curriculum  and  compatible  instructional \nmaterials  are  being  developed  for  upper  secondary  education  to  encourage  active  student \nlearning and student-centered instruction, but similar objectives for lower secondary education \nhave not had the same results. A much-improved system for in-service teacher training will be a \nkey  to  attaining  this  objective.  A  try-out  of  the  new  curriculum  and  materials,  as  well  as \nsupportive  systems  for  school  management  and  student  learning  assessment,  is  planned  for \n2003\u20132006.  \n \n8. \nAnother important objective is increased participation in upper secondary education. To \nreach the target of 45% GER in 2005 and 50% in 2010, the focus should be on provinces with \nthe most difficult conditions and serving the rural poor population, a large proportion of which is \nmade up of 54 minority groups. In 1998, ethnic minorities represented 14.2% of the population \nbut 28.5% of the poor. They are most numerous in the Northern and Central highlands and the \nMekong  River  Delta.  Bringing  ethnic  minorities  into  the  secondary  education  mainstream  will \nensure equitable social and economic development.  \n \nIn accordance with policy directions under public administration reform for 2001\u20132010,2 \n9. \ndecentralized education management will continue to be explored. New approaches to finance \nschools  and  improve  school  and  community  partnerships  should  result  in  better  student \noutcomes  and  lower  overall  costs.    More  community  participation  will  also  allow  students  and \ntheir families to match their education to their abilities and their long-term economic and social \naspirations.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n2   The Government of Viet Nam. 2001.

One  result  has  been  near-universal  primary-level \ncoverage  and  rapid  expansion  of  lower  and  upper  secondary  school  enrollment.  Government \npolicy  calls  for  increasing  the  net  enrollment  ratio  of  primary  school  students  to  99%  in  2010, \nand  gross  enrollment  of  lower  and  upper  secondary  school  students  to  90%  and  50% \nrespectively. However, as with most rapid expansion elsewhere, resources to sustain expansion \nat acceptable levels of quality are constrained. Additional spending for infrastructure expansion \nand  current  budget  increases  are  needed  for  curricular  development  and  diversification, \ntextbook  quality  and  availability,  teacher  education  and  pedagogical  methods,  and  vocational \nand  technical  education.  Provinces  are  to  be  financially  responsible  for  upper  secondary \neducation infrastructure with central budgetary aid to the poorest areas. Nongovernment school \nfinancing,  already  high,  is  to  be  further  increased.  Management  is  to  be  decentralized  to  the \nprovincial and district levels with assistance and training as required.  \n \n2. \nEducation and training sector spending by level are as follows: primary education, 38%; \nlower  secondary  education,  20%;  upper  secondary  education,  8%;  and  the  remainder  is  for \ntraining expenditures. Upper secondary school enrollment is expected to increase substantially, \nrequiring  changes  in  intersectoral  allocation  during  the  project  period.1  Capital  and  recurrent \ncosts comprise about 30% and 70%, respectively. Salaries consist of 60% of recurrent costs, \nwhich  go  primarily  to  teachers\u2019  salaries.  At  the  school  level,  funds  are  raised  through \nconstruction  fees  paid  by  parents  and  other  contributions  to  augment  the  construction  and \nmaintenance  of  facilities.  Teachers\u2019  salaries  are  low  by  international  comparison  and  teachers \nneed  at  least  two  jobs.  Although  the  budget  for  2000/2001  provides  for  increased  teachers\u2019 \nsalaries, these only make up for the losses that occurred during the financial crises. From the \nViet Nam Living Standards Survey, 1997-1998, the average expenditure per pupil at the upper \nsecondary level is D1.2 million ($97).2 Private costs to education are about 60% of the cost of \neducation to parents.  \n \n3. \nThe  Project  will  address  some  education  financing  issues.  It  has  been  designed  to \nminimize  recurrent  cost  implications  for  the  Government  and  community.  The  improvement  of \nthe  quality  support  systems  under  the  Project  is  intended  to  reduce  wastage,  improve  the \ninternal efficiency of upper secondary education, and reduce the cost of producing a graduate. \nThe incremental recurrent project costs arise largely from increased access to schools. The cost \nof textbooks has been minimized by improving their design, and quality for reuse. Cost recovery \nfrom  parental  purchases  of  textbooks  is  proposed  under  the  textbook  loan  scheme. Although \nnew construction and renovation of schools are being financed, sustainability is being ensured \nby the local community\u2019s commitment to operate and maintain the schools. \n \n4. \nThe  financial  sustainability  analysis  evaluates  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  the \ngovernment  budget.  The  total  financial  cost  of  the  Project,  inclusive  of  taxes,  duties, \ncontingencies, and interest charges, is $80 million for a approximately 6 years. The Project will \nbe  financed  69%  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  and  the  remainder  by  the  Government, \n                                                 \n1   During  the  last  5  years,  upper  secondary  education  budgets  increased  by  over  200%.

The fiscal impact of the Project shows that it will have \nvery  limited  impact  on  the  government  budget  under  the  following  assumptions:  (i)  education \nexpenditure is maintained at over 3% of GDP and 15% of government expenditure throughout \nthe  project  period;  and  (ii)  incremental  recurrent  costs  after  the  Project  are  maintained  at \nminimal levels ($800,000 per annum thereafter), and increases are contained through allocation \nof existing resources. \n \n5.  \nFrom the total project cost of $80 million, the Government will finance about $25 million \nof  the  total  project  cost  and  a  maximum  of  30%  of  the  development  expenditures.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  annual  share  in  project  costs  will  average  about  $4.2  million  or D63,000 million \nequivalent during the Project, or about 0.2% of the upper secondary education average annual \nbudget  of  about  $212.0  million  or  D3,200  billion  annually.  The  upper  secondary  education \nbudget  is  projected  based  on  increased  enrollment  in  upper  secondary  education  during  the \nProject,  consistent  with  historical  growth  in  the  subsector.  The  recurrent  costs  to  be  borne  by \nthe  Government  during  the  Project  are  estimated  to  be  about  $800,000  per  year  and  include \n(i) the  operating  expenses  of  the  project  implementation  unit,  and  (ii)  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  new  and  replaced  school  facilities  and  equipment.  Given  that  the  upper \nsecondary  education  annual  budget  averaged  10%  of  total  education  budget  over  the  last  5 \nyears, the budgetary impact of  the  estimated  annual  recurrent  costs  during  and  after  project \nimplementation is considered minimal (Table A11.1).   \n \n\n\fItem \n\n \n\nActual a \n\nBudget Planned  \n\nBudget Projected b \n\nAfter Project \n\n1998

From 1996/97 to 2001/02, enrollment \nin primary schools increased by 16%; in lower secondary, 37%; and in upper secondary, 115%. \nThe  Government\u2019s  goal  is  to  expand  upper  secondary  education  by  2010  to  promote \nindustrialization and economic modernization. Quality improvement is of the highest priority. The \nsocioeconomic, political, and cultural climate of the country calls for improvement of education, \nincluding  curriculum  and  teaching  methods.  To  achieve  a  sustainable  growth  path  and  to \nsurvive  in  a  globally  competitive  environment,  the  country  needs  to  build  a  dynamic  human \nresource  base  with  adaptable  skills.  Investment  in  education  under  the  Project  consists  of \nimproving  quality,  promoting  access  and  participation,  and \nincreasing  efficiency  and \neffectiveness  of  education  management  through  management  training,  decentralization,  and \nimproved  fiscal  transfers.  The  Project  is  expected  to  yield  substantial  economic,  social,  and \ninstitutional benefits.  \n \nB. \n \n2.   \nViet  Nam\u2019s  population  is  now  about  78  million,  having  doubled  in  the  last  30  years. \nGross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  during  the  last  decade  averaged  7.4%  annually. \nPopulation growth will result in further increase in the working-age population in Viet Nam. The \nlabor demand projections1 indicate that the 38.6 million labor force in 2000 will increase to 45.7 \nmillion in 2010, representing an average annual growth rate of 1.8%. By 2010, the working-age \npopulation will account for around 51.0% of the total population as compared to 46.7% in 2000. \nDespite  strong  economic  growth,  employment  growth  lagged  behind.  The  labor-intensive and \nexport-oriented  domestic  private  sector,  although  growing  quickly,  is  still  small.  This \nemployment  structure  remains  largely  dominated  by  agriculture,  with  labor  shifting  from  the \npublic  and  cooperative  sectors  toward  household  enterprises/farms  that  do  not  use  salaried \nworkers, and toward independent labor. \n \n3.   \nThe  labor  market  in  Viet  Nam  continues  to  be  predominantly  unskilled,  agricultural,  or \nhousehold  workers2.  In  2000,  the  educated  and  trained  labor  force  comprised  only  15.3%  of \nemployed  persons  (at  the  technical  professional  level).  The  labor  market  will  continue  to \nincrease  by  3%,  which  means  that  every  year  another  1.4  million  people  will  enter  the  labor \nmarket.  These  are  young,  often  unskilled  workers  with  minimal  experience,  who  live  in  rural \nareas  where  land  and  nonfarming  jobs  are  scarce.  Those  who  will  not  be  absorbed  by  the \nformal  sector  will  continue  to  work  in  household  enterprises.  If  the  private  sector  does  not \ndevelop  significantly,  unemployment  will  increase,  especially  as  state  enterprises  and  the \nagriculture  sector  employ  fewer  people,  and  because  the  absorptive  capacity  of  the  labor-\nintensive,  low-productivity  tertiary  sector  is  low.  The  Government,  while  dismantling  its \nmonopoly  in  employment,  has  not  invested  sufficiently  in  retraining,  which  has  been  left  to \nindividual initiative.  \n \n4. \nThe transition to a market economy, and rapid economic growth in the last decade have \nraised the demand for skilled labor. Growth promises to be more labor intensive. Given its rich \nnatural and human resources, Viet Nam can triple manufacturing exports and create around 1.6 \n                                                 \n1   Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs. 2001. Vocational Training Development Strategy 2010. Hanoi. \n2   In 2000, 84.6% of the labor force was unskilled and 63% in agriculture.  \n\n\f48\n\n  \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nEconomic Rates of Return and Project Benefits \n\nmillion manufacturing jobs in export sectors in the near future. To be competitive, however, Viet \nNam  must  develop  the  high-technology  sectors  and  upgrade  its  labor  force. Upper secondary \neducation is particularly important to foster the needed labor skills and the capacity to learn on \nthe job while adapting to new technologies. Measures must mitigate the poverty and inequality \nthat may worsen with increasing globalization. Viet Nam\u2019s comparative advantage is likely to be \nin sectors and enterprises that require relative shifts in the skill content of export manufactures; \nsteady  increase  in  labor-intensive  products;  and  dramatic  increase  in  science-based goods, \nincluding those that are technologically complex. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe  economic  benefits  will  potentially  include  high  social  returns  from  the  investment \nthrough  (i) improved  efficiency  of  infrastructure  and  personnel,  and  in  allocation of resources; \nand (ii) improved productivity of graduates. The major economic benefits of the Project lie in its \ncontributions  to  improving  the  internal  efficiency  of  upper  secondary  education.  The  new \ncurriculum  and  teaching  methodologies  based  on  active  student-centered  approaches  to  be \nintroduced by the Project will enable the newly trained teachers to interact more with students, \nthus  helping  improve  the  performance  of  their  students.  Teachers  will  be  upgraded  in  areas \nwhere they have had no preservice training, and principals will be trained in new approaches to \nschool  leadership  and  management  training.  The  Project  will  also  develop  comprehensive \nevaluation  and  assessment  procedures,  formative  and  summative.  The  Project  is  expected  to \nincrease  the  number  of  upper  secondary  school  graduates  to  over  500,000  annually.  The \nProject will directly improve the quality of outcomes and performance of graduates in the labor \nmarket. The Project will provide the means to raise academic standards and help improve the \nalignment  between  graduate  skills  and  the  labor  market.  Increased  earning  capacity  and \nspending ability of low-income groups will help reduce poverty. \n \n6. \nDemand  Analysis.  Lower and upper secondary education has rapidly expanded since \n1994.  From  1996  to  1999,  upper  secondary  education  enrollment  increased  from  about  1.2 \nmillion  to  2.0  million,  for  a  net  enrollment  rate  (NER)  of  32%.    In  the  15  provinces  with  the \nhighest NER, the number of secondary schools increased by 38.1%, and enrollment by 78.6%. \nIn  15  provinces  with  the  lowest  NER,  the  number  of  schools  increased  by  only  30.3%,  and \nenrollment  by  128.0%.  Enrollment  differs  significantly,  however,  among  income  groups.  Upper \nsecondary  education  NER  among  the  richest  20%  of  households  in  1998  was  64.1%, while \namong the 20% poorest households it was a mere 4.5%. The low enrollment rates among the \npoor are attributable to the high direct private costs to education and the indirect (opportunity) \ncosts of upper secondary education. In view of government plans to expand primary, and lower \nand  upper  secondary  enrollment  by  2010,  significant  public  (and  private)  resources  will  be \nrequired at all levels.  \n \nReverse  Cost-Benefit  Analysis.  Expected  benefits  from  productivity  differential  and \n7.   \nreduced  costs   are  based  on  the  expected  minimum.  Total  project  benefits  are  estimated  at \nabout $19 million per year based on reduced costs and productivity differentials (Tables A12.1 \nand  A12.2).  In  considering  the  benefits  of  education,  \u201cswitching  values\u201d  are  useful  in  the \nabsence  of  reliable  data  on  earnings  differentials.  The  analysis,  sometimes  referred  to  as \nreverse  cost-benefit  analysis,  consists  of  estimating  the  productivity  differential  required  for  an \neducation  investment  to  have  an  acceptable  rate  of  return.  The  Project  has  few,  if  any, \nquantifiable  objectives  for  which  future  monetary  benefits  can  be  estimated,  but  it  does  have \nmultiple  objectives  and  multiple  inputs  toward  reaching  them.  The  Project  is  an  investment  to \nredirect  and  improve  an  existing  upper  education  system.  The  Project  is  not  just  a  series  of \ndiscrete investments aimed at particular goals but a systemic approach using a combination of \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n49\n\npolicy  changes  and  new  investments  to  improve  upper  secondary  education.

With a minimum hurdle rate of 12% (real rate of return), the Project can \nbe  deemed  a  good  investment.  The  rate-of-return  approach  is  based  on  organizing  on  an \nannual  basis  the  different  project  activities  or  interventions.  Where  possible,  the  expected \neffects have been summarized in monetary terms either as cost reductions (such as producing \nthe  same  output  at  a  reduced  overall  cost)  or  increased  benefits  (such  as  producing  more \ngraduates who earn more because they are better educated and/or more equipped to contribute \nto the global economy). These benefits exclude externalities that accrue to the Project. \n \n8.  \nProductivity differentials are computed based on the number of projected graduates from \nthe  secondary  education  sector  master  plan  (SESMP)3  multiplied  by  the  differential  earnings \nfrom the mean and median average income. The Viet Nam Living Standards Survey, 1997-1998 \n(VLSS98)4  shows  that  the  median  average  for  the  seven  regions  with  educational  attainment \nless  than  primary  diploma  and  lower  secondary  diploma  comprises  70%  of  population.  The \ndifference  between  the  median  and  mean  income  is  the  productivity  differential  of  the  upper \nsecondary education graduates under the Project, assuming 78% completion rate. About 40% \nof graduates are expected to benefit from the productivity differential. \n \n9.   \nKey Benefit Assumptions. Reduced costs are the yearly savings expected as a result \nof  strengthening  management  of  upper  secondary  education.  The  Project  is  expected  to \nimprove  cost-effectiveness  by  increasing  capacity  utilization  of  upper  secondary  education \nschools,  reducing  the  unit  cost,  and  strengthening  the  management  of  upper  secondary \neducation at the provincial and school levels. The expected cumulative savings are assumed to \nbe about 1% of annual recurrent costs of upper secondary education. \n\n \n\nCost-Effectiveness and Internal Efficiency \n\n10. \nProductivity  differentials\u2014benefits  from  increased  earnings  or  inflows\u2014will result from \nimproved productivity of graduates. The quality improvement measures and teacher training are \nexpected  to  increase  earnings  of  new  graduates  based  on  the  better  education  that  they will \nreceive through the Project. Benefits will come from increased earnings because students have \nbeen directed into subjects for which demand is greater. Better-qualified teachers and student-\ncentered  approaches  will  improve  student  performance  and  thus  improve  the  quality  of \ngraduates  and  the  workforce.  VLSS98  data  on  education  and  income  was  used  to  calculate \nproductivity differentials. \n \nD. \n \n11. \nA  key  element  of  cost-effectiveness  of  education  spending  is  per student or unit cost. \nAccording  the  SESMP,5  the  public  cost  per  pupil  in  2000/01  was  D254,000  for  primary \neducation; D264,000 for lower secondary; and D260,000 for upper secondary. Upper secondary \neducation public expenditure is increasing, but is relatively modest compared to expenditure in \nprimary  and  lower  secondary  education.  Public  expenditure  per  student  is  only  slightly  above \nexpenditure per pupil at the primary level and less than the cost per pupil at the lower secondary \nlevel.  This  is  possible  due  to  the  relatively  large  share  of  total  costs  borne  by  individual \nhouseholds  as  described  below.  In  most  countries,  however,  public  expenditure  per  pupil \nincreases significantly at each successive education level.  \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB  and  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training  (MOET).  2002.

In 1998, the private share of upper \nsecondary education expenditure represented 69% of the total expenditure. In 1993, the private \nexpenditure share was 57%. According to VLSS98, the average per pupil expenditure per year \nwas D557,500 ($45) at the lower secondary level and D1.2 million ($97) at the upper secondary \nlevel. Public unit cost per student at all levels is almost equal, resulting in the provision of low-\nquality  higher-level  education.  This  indicates  that  improvements  in  teacher  quality,  and \ncurriculum,  textbook,  and  other  quality  reforms,  are  the  most  important  and  cost-effective \neducational  spending  to  prepare  students  for  higher  education  or  the  labor  market.  It  makes \ngood economic sense that various activities planned under the Project aim to improve quality. \n \nE. \n \n13. \nA  large  number  of  teachers  and  principals  will  benefit  from  the  new  and  improved  in-\nservice  training  programs:  18,600  teachers  trained  in  new  teaching  methods  (component  1); \n1,000  teachers  retrained  and  upgraded  (component  2);  and  about  1,400  school  principals \ntrained in school management and education leadership (component 3). The Project will directly \nbenefit about 25% of the teaching and administrative staff at the districts and schools through \ntraining,  leading  to  enhanced  capacity  and  improved  efficiency,  and  upgraded  school \nmanagement  skills.  About  5  million  upper  secondary  education  students  will  benefit  from \nimproved student assessment, testing, education evaluation, and quality assurance. Public and \nprivate  upper  secondary  education  institutions  will  benefit  from  improved  student-centered \ncurriculum,  teaching  methods,  textbooks,  and  instructional  materials  in  key  subject  areas. \nStudents  will  benefit  from  enhanced  quality  and  quantity  of  education  inputs,  leading  to \nimproved  education  achievements  and  higher  returns  to  private  investment  in  education. \nEducational  reforms  will  be  supported  through  participatory  policy  studies,  study  visits,  and \nexternal training of key staff. Under component 2, about 120,000 disadvantaged students in 20 \nselected  provinces  with  low  participation  rates  will  benefit  from  the  new  construction  and \nreplacement  of  classrooms,  and  equipment  provision.  The  teaching  and  learning  environment \n(i.e.,  conditions  of  facilities  and  availability  of  instructional  equipment,  teaching  aids,  and \nmaterials) will be improved. Study support programs will benefit about 22,500 poor and ethnic \nminority students.  \n\n                                                 \n6   Public  upper  secondary  education  is  supposedly  free  (but  in  actuality  there  are  costs).  Semi-public students pay \ntuition  and  a  construction  fee  among  others.  Students  in  nonpublic  schools  pay  a  higher  tuition  and  perhaps \nconstruction fee. Provincial peoples\u2019 committees set the fee levels within the range established by the Government.  \n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 13 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\n \nLinkage to the Country Poverty Analysis \nA.  \nSector Identified as a National Priority in Country \nPoverty Analysis?                                                 Yes \n\nSector Identified as a National Priority in Country \nPoverty Reduction Partnership Agreement?         Yes \nPartnership agreement signed. \n\nContribution of Sector/Subsector to Reduce Poverty: \n \nThe upper secondary education subsector is geared to reduce poverty in Viet Nam by promoting greater access to \nupper secondary education nationally and for females, especially those from poor and ethnic minority backgrounds. \nThe poor and ethnic minorities, for various cultural and economic reasons, are underrepresented in upper secondary \neducation.  The  provision  of  upper  secondary  education  includes  general  upper  secondary  education  curriculum \ntogether  with  career  orientation  and  technical  training  focusing  on  local  industry  requirements,  thus  providing \nstudents with skills to help them get jobs and overcome transgenerational poverty. \n \nViet  Nam's  lower  and  upper  secondary  education  has  expanded  rapidly  since  1994.  From  1991  to  1999,  upper \nsecondary  enrollment  increased  by  101.2%  from  700,000  to  2  million,  for  a  net  enrollment  rate  (NER)  of  32%  in \n1999. In the 15 provinces with the highest NER, secondary schools increased by 38.1%, and enrollment, by 78.6%. \nIn  the  15  provinces  with  the  lowest  NER,  schools  increased  by  only  30.3%,  and  enrollment,  by  128.0%.  However, \nsignificant differences in enrollment remain among income groups. NER in upper secondary education among the \nrichest  20%  of  households  in  1998  was  64.1%,  while  among  the  20%  poorest  households,  a  mere  4.5%.  The  low \nenrollment rates among the poor are due to the high direct private costs of education, and the indirect  (opportunity) \ncosts of upper secondary education.  \n \nThe Project will address issues concerning access to and participation in upper secondary education. The provinces \nrecommended  for  component  2  promote  access,  equity,  and  participation  in  upper  secondary  education  in  the \ndisadvantaged  provinces  in  the  North  East,  North  West,  North  Central  Coast,  South  Central  Coast,  Central \nHighlands, South East, and Mekong River Delta.  \n \nB.            Poverty and Social Analysis                                      Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \n \n                                           Human Development \n                                                                                                                                                Gender and Development \n \nViet Nam has an overwhelmingly rural population (59 million in 2000). The population grew from just over 66 million \nin  1990  to  slightly  over  77.6  million  in  2000,1 or an increase of 17.5%. The female population increased from 33.8 \nmillion to  49.5  million,  and  the  male  population  from  32.2  million  to  38.2  million.  The  annual  per  capita  income  in \n1994 was D2 million ($134) and D3.5 million ($236) in 1999. In the rural areas, the annual per capita income in 1994 \nwas D1.7 million ($113), and D2.7 million ($180) in 1999. However, stark differences exist between rural and urban \nareas,  and  between  the  lowest  and  highest  household  quintiles.  In  1999,  the  lowest  income  quintile  of  households \nhad  an  annual  per  capita  income  of  D1.2  million  ($78);  the  highest,  D10.4  million  ($691).  In  rural  areas,  the \ncorresponding figures for the lowest income quintile are D996,000 ($66), and for the highest, D6.3 million ($418). In \n1999, the figures for the lowest income quintile in urban areas was D2.4 million ($160),  and for the highest, D23.5 \nmillion ($1,569).2 \n \nPoverty incidence is highest the Northern Uplands, Central Highlands, and Mekong River Delta, and certain groups \nremain vulnerable. Most of the poor (i) are farmers, (ii) are poorly educated, (iii) have many children, (iv) have little \naccess  to  material  resources  such  as  land,  and  (v)  have  little  access  to  social  and  physical  infrastructure.  Two \ngroups are particularly vulnerable: ethnic minorities and unregistered migrants in urban areas. \n \nThe Government\u2019s achievements in reducing poverty are momentous. Urban poverty dropped from 25% in 1993 to \n9% in 1998, and rural poverty, from 66% to 45%. Poverty largely affects the rural population and ethnic minorities. \nApproximately 90% of poor live in rural areas, where  the incidence poverty is 45% compared with 10 \u201315% in urban \nareas. Although poverty incidence has declined significantly, one third of the country\u2019s population remains poor. The \nincreased  private  costs  (tuition  fees,  uniforms,  etc.)  of  education  have  reduced  enrollment,  particularly  among  the \npoor. Ethnic minorities make up 28.5% of the poor but only 14.2% of the population. Despite the Government\u2019s high \npriority  on  poverty  reduction  and  support  for  ethnic  minorities,  they  are  underrepresented  in  upper  secondary \neducation, especially the poor and females.  Low income and consumption, and poor health bar these groups from \nupper secondary education.  \n \nPoor households lack access to productive farming land and adequate infrastructure and education  services. Ethnic  \nminority  households, and  settlers who previously engaged in swidden agriculture then moved to urban areas are \noften  excluded \nin  a \ntransgenerational  poverty  cycle  of  poor  living  conditions,  low  productivity,  and  low  income,  limiting  access  to \neducation. \n\nfrom  mainstream  economic  activity.

Targeting  poor  beneficiaries,  especially  females  from  ethnic  minorities  and  others  from \ndisadvantaged  socioeconomic  backgrounds,  the  Project  will  reduce  poverty  in  the  20  disadvantaged  provinces \nthrough (i) provision of special study support programs, (ii) provision of institutional materials and teaching aids to \npoor  students,  and  (iii)  development  of  facilities  such  as  new  schools/classrooms  closer  to  the  homes  of  poor \nstudents.  These  measures  will  increase  access  and  participation,  and  retention  and  completion  rates  among \ndisadvantaged students. \n \nThe Project is national in scope but will focus its investment in 20 disadvantaged provinces with (i) the lowest NER, \n(ii) low gross enrollment rate (GER) and female GER, (iii) a large number of very poor communes and/or low human \ndevelopment  index  rating,  (iv)  a  high  number  of  ethnic  minority  people,  and  (v)  a  high  completion  rate  in  lower \nsecondary  education  but  low  transition  rate  to  upper  seco ndary.

During the TA, workshops and \nseminars  were  held  at  the  national  and  provincial  levels,  including  two  regional  workshops\u2014one encompassing \nMinistry  of  Education  and  Training  representatives  and  upper  secondary  principals  and  DOET  representatives  and \nfrom  30  North,  South,  and  Central  provinces.  Participation  strategy  also  included  consultation  with  students, \nteachers, principals, school managers, DOET directors, and DOET department heads during field visits to 12 public \nand nonpublic schools in six provinces. Further participation took place through macro planning workshops with 20 \nDOET directors from North, South, and Central provinces. Midterm and final seminars were held, enabling feedback \nand participation from representatives of national government departments, potential funding agencies, and DOETs.  \n \nThe Project is envisaged to use a participation strategy to solicit inputs by incorporating dialogue with stakeholders  \nsuch as the Committee for Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Areas, Women\u2019s Union, Committee for Protection and \nCare of Children, and Committee for the Advancement of Women. Local consultation is required at every step of the \nprocess\u2014school  site  selection,  design and construction, and operation and maintenance. The Project will ensure \ndirect  participation  of  relevant  stakeholders  through  civic  awareness  and  community  dialogue.  This  will  involve \ncommunity  participation  at  appropriate  levels  and  input  from  interest  groups,  which  will  be  utilized  in  community \ndialogue. During implementation of the pilot curriculum, and other activities associated with components 1, 2, and 3, \nrepresentative groups and stakeholders such as students, parents, communities, schools, and the groups mentioned \nabove will be consulted.   \n \nD.  \nIssue  \nResettlement \n\nIssue Level \nNot significant \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nPotential Issues \n\nClassrooms will be replaced in existing sites. \nNew schools will be built on vacant public l and \nor commune reserve land. If no vacant public \nland or commune reserve land is available and \ncommunity or household land might be needed, \na detailed community decision-making process \nfor site selection must be followed to safeguard \nthe communities\u2019 interests.   \nTo ensure adequate participation of women, \nIEC packages will be developed and \ndisseminated and gender-inclusive curriculum \ndeveloped. Special study support programs will \nimprove access to and participation in upper \nsecondary education. \nThe rural poor pay a substantial percentage of \ntheir income for education of their children. The \nProject will lower the cost of instructional \nmaterials and teaching aids, and provide them \nfree, and provide study support programs for \nthe poor, ethnic minorities, and girls. \nThe number of poor, ethnic minority, and \nfemale students in general and technical upper \nsecondary education should increase \nsignificantly.

However, wide \ndisparities  still  remain  in  and  between  provinces.  The  poor  have  much  more  limited  access  to \neducation  at  all  levels  than  do  higher-income  groups.  Many  more  ethnic  minority  children, \nespecially girls, continue to face obstacles to attending school. \n \nThe  Government  has  actively  supported  and  invested  in  services  for  the  poor  and \n2. \nvulnerable.  However,  certain  ethnic  minorities  face  many  specific  disadvantages,  which  are \nhighlighted by physical and cultural isolation. Gender inequality is also serious, especially among \npoor, rural, and ethnic minority households. Despite government initiatives, discriminatory practices \nand traditions undermine the rights and needs of ethnic minority girls and women. Curriculum and \nfacility  development  targeting  ethnic  minority  children  will  be  prioritized.  The  following  action  plan \nidentifies  the  approach  and  target  group  that  the  Project  will  focus  on  to  address  the  needs  of \nfemale and ethnic minority students. \n\n \nTable A14.1: Action Plan for Gender and Ethnic Minority Needs \n\n \n\nComponent/Activity \nComponent 1: Supporting Conditions for \nQuality Improvement in Upper Secondary \nEducation \n \nCurriculum development \n\nApproach and Target \n\n \n \n \n \nCurriculum development specialists will be trained in gender \nand ethnic minority issues and diversity.  The new diversified \ncurriculum will be sensitive to gender and ethnic minority issues \n(social, cultural, and economic diversity).  \n \nOptional topics relevant to gender and ethnic minority issues, \npreservation of indigenous knowledge, and economic \ndevelopment of ethnic minority areas will be included. \n \nTeaching methods for the diversified curriculum will be \nsensitive to gender, and ethnic and cultural diversity. \n \n \nIn-service teacher training will include topics on gender issues, \nethnic and cultural diversity, indigenous language instruction, \nand learning styles of girls and diverse ethnic minority groups.  \n \nMaster trainers will conduct in-service training for delivery of \nsummer school programs.  New teachers will be trained and \nassigned to teach in special programs.  Skills of teachers in \npoor areas will be upgraded. \n \nIn selecting participants for in-service teacher training, priority \nwill be given to women to achieve at least the same proportion \nof women's participation as in the overall pool of the in-service \ntrainees.  \n \nThrough student-centered learning approaches, the learning \nneeds of female and ethnic minority students will be included in \nin-service teacher training. \n \n \nImproved instructional materials will be provided to upper \nsecondary schools that serve the poor populations, including \nethnic minority groups under component 2. \n \n\n \nTeaching methods  \n\n \nIn-service teacher training \n\n \nInstructional materials  \n\n\f56 \n\n     Appendix 14 \n\nComponent 2: Improving Access, Equity, and \nParticipation in Upper Secondary Education in \nDisadvantaged Areas \n \nConstruction, replacement, or upgrading of upper \nsecondary school facilities, including classrooms \n \n \n\n \nSupport study programs \n\n \nInformation, education and communication (IEC) \ndevelopment \n\nComponent 3: Strengthening Management of \nUpper Secondary Education \n \nPilot initiatives \n\n \nStudent-based education management \ninformation system (EMIS) \n\n \nB. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nOrganization   \n\n \n \n \n \nThis subcomponent will cover the 20 disadvantaged provinces. \nEfforts will be made to locate schools as close to ethnic \nminority communities as possible and to include amenities to \nattract girls.  Decisions on school locations will be based on \nschool mapping and targeting. \n \n\n \nSupport study programs for targeting poor, ethnic minority, and \nfemale students will be initiated and implemented in the 20 \ndisadvantaged provinces.  The programs will be conducted at a \nschool or through qualified teachers who reside in remote \nareas.  Support study program delivery will be sensitive to local \nneeds such as remote location.  Materials designed to enhance \nacademic skills and knowledge of gender, and culture and \nethnic diversity will be used. \n \n \nAn IEC program will be developed and campaigns conducted in \ntarget communities, especially among ethnic minority groups to \nconvince parents of the benefits of educating children, \nparticularly girls. Information will be disseminated in \nethnographically focused and culturally sensitive ways and \nmeans. \n   \n \n \n \nPilot initiatives will be completed in eight provinces: \n(i) decentralized financing of schools, (ii) improving community-\nschool partnerships, (iii) administrative roles and \nresponsibilities in a decentralized environment, (iv) managing \neducation in difficult areas, and (v) socializing of upper \nsecondary education.  \n \nLessons learned will be fed back into the education system to \nincrease access and participation in upper secondary schools, \nespecially among the poor, ethnic minorities, and girls. Training \nof education managers at provincial, district, school, and \ncommune level, including members of parents\u2019 associations, \nwill raise awareness of gender and ethnic minority issues. \n \n \nStudent-based EMIS strategies will be strengthened so that \ndisaggregated data tracking and analyses can be carried out.  \nThis activity will be of special benefit to the underserved ethnic \nminority and female students on whom there is little available \ndata. \n \n\n \n3. \nThe  Project\u2019s  gender  and  ethnic  minorities  action  plan  is  infused  across  all  three \ncomponents.  Overall  implementation  responsibilities  will  lie  with  relevant  departments  of  the \nMinistry of Education and Training (MOET) and the National Project Implementation Unit (NPIU) at \nthe  central  level,  and  provincial  project  implementation  units  (PPIUs)  at  the  provincial  level.  \nSpecific  responsibilities  for  particular  aspects  and  activities  of  the  action  plan  are  included  in  the \nterms  of  reference  for  individual  consultants  to  ensure  that  intended  goals  are  achieved. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 14  \n\n57 \n\nNongovernment organizations will be consulted to develop innovative approaches to reach ethnic \nminority female students in remote areas.   \n \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Capacity \n\n \nMOET  has  one  research  center,  the  Research  Center  for  Ethnic  Minority  Education, \n4. \nresponsible for gathering information on education of ethnic minority groups, developing curriculum \nand  teaching  methods,  and  contributing  to  policy  studies.    The  Department  of  Continuing \nEducation also does similar work, but targets ethnic minorities and adult learners. The action plan \nwill  seek  to  involve  the  center  staff,  although  primary  responsibility  for  activities  will  be  spread \nthroughout MOET departments, NPIU, PPIUs, and consultants. The Project will build upon ongoing \nactivities  under  the  Lower  Secondary  Education  Development  Project  and  the  Teacher  Training \nProject,  targeting  ethnic  minorities,  especially  females,  in  school  construction  and  replacement \nprograms; curriculum renovation adopting more active, student-centered learning approaches; and \nrelated in-service teacher training.    \n \n\n3. \n\nBudget and Financing Plan   \n\n \n5. \nThe  action  plan  does  not  require  separate  budgets  since  it  is  integrated  into  the  overall \nproject cost. The benefits of component 1 will spread nationwide at different levels; estimating how \nmuch will accrue to ethnic minorities and female students is difficult.  Civil works under component \n2 in the 20 disadvantaged provinces will increase access in remote and ethnic minority areas. The \nProject  will  also  have  specialist  assistance  through  social  development,  ethnic  minority,  and \ngender specialist (6 person-months) who will help implement the action plan.   \n\n \n4. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n \n6. \nThe action plan\u2019s implementation schedule will be in line with the overall implementation of \nthe Project for 6 years, from early 2003 to mid-2009, and specific implementation schedule of each \nof three project components.  \n \n\n5. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation  \n\n \nThe  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  action  plan  will  be  incorporated  into  the  overall \n7. \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  plan  developed  for  all  three  project  components.    Monitoring  will  be \nongoing to ensure that activities are effectively carried out and targets reached. Monitoring will also \nallow for adjustments of the action plan during implementation.  The NPIU will be responsible for \nestablishing  and  coordinating  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities,  and  PPIUs  will  monitor  local \nschool-based and community activities.  The midterm review will also be accompanied by staff with \nexpertise in gender and ethnic minority issues. \n \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 November 2002) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "\u2013 \n", "dong (D) \n", "D1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "= \n= \n", "$0.00007 \nD15,369.5 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nBOET \nDOET \nEFA \nEMIS \nGDP \nGER \nIASC \nIEC \nJICA \nMOET \nNER \nNPIU \nPPIU \nSESMP \nTTU \nTUSS \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nbureau of education and training \nprovincial department of education and training \neducation for all \neducation management information system \ngross domestic product \ngross enrollment rate \nInteragency Steering Committee \ninformation, education, and communication \nJapan International Cooperation Agency \nMinistry of Education and Training \nnet enrollment rate \nNational Project Implementation Unit \nprovincial project implementation unit \nsecondary education sector master plan \nteacher training university \ntechnical upper secondary school \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n     This report was prepared by a team consisting of Y.
