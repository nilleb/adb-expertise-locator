Water availability is a critical concern \nfor the fragile ecology, which is predominantly a desert territory characterized by strong winds, \nlow rainfall, and high evaporation rates. Infrastructure improvement and provision of basic urban \nservices  are  needed  to  facilitate  environmentally  sustainable  economic  growth\u2014essential  to \nimproving urban living conditions. \n \n3. \nRecognizing  the  need  for  greater  national  support,  the  Government  of  the  PRC \ninaugurated  a  twinning  scheme  whereby  assistance  from  other  provinces  will  be  used  to \nstrengthen  the  capacity  in  XUAR  and  improve  local  living  standards.  Nineteen  nominated \nprovinces and/or municipalities are providing financial contributions since 2011 and will continue  \nto  2020.  The  domestic  support  complements  the  growing  strategic  urban  development \npartnership of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region \nGovernment  (XUARG),  along  with  efforts  of  other  international  development  partners.4 ADB  is \ncurrently  involved  in  three  ongoing  urban  development  projects  in  the  region.5\n The  proposed \nproject will be the fourth ADB-financed urban development project in XUAR. \n \nThe project will help XUAR address a common and major urban development constraint \n4. \nby  enhancing  water  availability  through  strengthening  wastewater  reuse  and  improving  water \nmanagement in two medium-sized cities\u2014Kelamayi and Kuitun.6\n Both cities, which are located \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

Kuitun is on a strategic transportation route (the Old Silk Road) linking the PRC \nwith  its  central  Asian  neighbors.  The  national  economic  policy  is  to  create  more  balanced  growth  as  a \ncountermeasure to potential large population shifts exacerbating the management of rural\u2013urban migration brought \nabout by economic modernization. \n\n\f2 \n\nis \n\nfor \n\nthe  ADB \n\njustification \n\nintervention \n\nThe  overarching \n\nimprovement.  Both  project  cities  have  prepared \n\nnorthwest of the region\u2019s capital (Urumqi)\u2014Kelamayi 350 kilometers (km) away and Kuitun 220 \nkm are severely water-stressed and have a very harsh climate, with sub-zero temperatures from \nNovember  to  March.  Annual  precipitation  in  Kelamayi  is  about  100  millimeters  (mm)  and  in \nKuitun  about  189  mm.  The  water  management  problems  created  by  lack  of  rainfall  are \ncompounded by high evaporation rates averaging over 2,000 mm per annum. The project aims \nto help promote balanced and environment-friendly urbanization, improve living conditions in the \ntwo  cities,  and  play  a  demonstration  role  for  cities  with  similar  geographic  and  climatic \nconditions in XUAR and elsewhere.  \n \nThe  project  aims  to  adopt  an  integrated  approach  to  infrastructure  development  and \n5. \nenvironmental \nintegrated  economic \ndevelopment  plans;  subprojects  were  selected  in  accordance  with  priorities  identified  in  the \nplans,  with  improved  water  management  as  a  common  objective  for  most  of  the  proposed \ninvestment.  Municipal  infrastructure  investment,  particularly  focused  on  improved  water \nresources  conservation  and  management  which  is  considered  critical  to  enable  sustainable \ndevelopment of the two cities. \n \n6. \nto  demonstrate  how \nimprovements  in  water  management  can  facilitate  sustainable  economic  urban  development, \neven  in  cities  with  an  adjacent  desert  location,  and  arid  and  unfavorable  climate  for  water \nresources  management.  The  project  will  address  two  priority  water-related  issues  that  feature \nprominently  in  the  local  city  development  plans.  In  Kelamayi,  the  major  project  theme  is  to \nimprove wastewater management to facilitate wastewater reuse as a substitute for freshwater in \nthe irrigation of urban green space. In Kuitun, the main theme is river rehabilitation to enhance \nflood  protection  standards,  while  creating  a  much-improved  urban  environment  to  promote \neconomic growth and improve the living conditions of local residents. During project preparation, \nthe  design  of  the  Kuitun  components  was  adjusted  to  include  environmental  sanitation \nimprovements  targeting  a  particularly  deprived  part  of  the  project  area  and  significantly \nimproving  the  inclusiveness  of  the  project  design. 7\n In  each  city,  water  management \nimprovements  will  demonstrate  the  benefits  to  be  obtained  from  active  nonrevenue  water \n(NRW)  management  and  optimized  water  distribution  networks.  In  addition  to  improved  water \nmanagement,  existing  arterial  and  smaller  roads  need  to  be  connected  to  ensure  optimal \ndevelopment  of  the  town  in  west  Kelamayi.  Inter-  and  intra-road  network  improvement  in \nKelamayi and Kuitun is important given their proximity to Tacheng, which has one of the largest \nland  ports  for  trade  with  the  Central  Asian  republics.  The  development  strategies  of  Kelamayi \nand  Kuitun  focus  on  their  potential  role  in  and  contribution  to  the  Central  Asia  Regional \nEconomic Cooperation Program (footnote 6).            \n \n7. \nFit  with  ADB  strategy. The project supports environmentally sustainable and inclusive \neconomic  growth,  which  is  a  key  priority  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020.8 By  helping  foster  inclusive \ngrowth  and  promote  environmental  sustainability,  the  project  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country \npartnership strategy, 2011\u20132015,9\n which supports the government\u2019s strategic goal of building an \neconomically  developed  society.  The  project  will  remove  infrastructure  constraints,  address \nenvironmental  concerns,  promote  sustainable  economic  growth,  and  support  policy  and \ninstitutional  reforms  in  Kelamayi  and  Kuitun.  It  also  conforms  to  (i)  ADB\u2019s  Water  Operational \n\n                                                \n7   Based on extensive consultations with the local community, the project design was adjusted to meet local priorities \n\nsuch as improved public toilets and solid waste storage and collection.   \n\n8  ADB.  2008.

Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2011\u20132015. Manila. \n\n\f3 \n\nPlan, 10  particularly  in  terms  of  the  green  and  competitive  cities  agenda,  as  the  project \nencourages water conservation, including wastewater reuse, and NRW reduction; and (ii) ADB\u2019s \nUrban Operational  Plan,  which  fosters competitive,  green,  and  inclusive  cities.11\n The  project  is \nconsistent  with  the  PRC\u2019s  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan  (2011\u20132015),  which  promotes  environment-\nfriendly and resource-efficient urban development, and supports the development of the western \nregion. It  is  consistent  with  the  national  economic  policy  to  create  more balanced  growth  as  a \ncountermeasure  to  potential  large  population  shifts  exacerbating  the  management  of  rural\u2013\nurban migration brought about by economic modernization. \n \n8. \nContinuity of development initiatives and incorporation of lessons. The project will \nfollow  the  3R12 principles  adopted  in  the  Xinjiang  Altay  Urban  Infrastructure  and  Environment \nImprovement  Project  to  support  development  of  livable  cities  with  a  specific  focus  on  water \nreuse  and  efficiency.  The  project  is  envisaged  to  play  a  demonstration  role  for  similar  cities \nfacing  water  constraints.  The  project  design  incorporates  lessons from  previous  ADB-financed \nurban development projects, particularly the three ongoing Xinjiang projects (footnote 5) in the \nPRC  and  the  ADB  Special  Evaluation  Study  on  Water  Policy  and  Related  Operations. 13\n In \nparticular, the project will strengthen support for capacity development starting at the early stage \nof  project  preparation,  with  special  focus  on  (i)  improving  awareness  of  ADB  policy  and \nprocedural  requirements  to  facilitate  smooth  implementation  and  timely  compliance,  and  \n(ii) strengthening long-term sustainability of the project-built facilities. \n \n9. \nInnovative  features.  Special  project  features  include  (i)  support  for  sustainable \neconomic  development  in  the  project  cities  with  particular  emphasis  on  improved  water \nmanagement; (ii) demonstration of best practices in the use of wetland storage for wastewater \nreuse and water management improvements; (iii) focus on reducing NRW and improving water \nconservation;  (iv)  an  extensive  institutional  capacity  building  program  for  the  implementing \nagencies  and  for  future  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  units  to  strengthen  operating \nefficiency  and  project  sustainability;  and  (v)  implementation  of  climate-friendly  development \npractices.14 In  particular,  the  reuse  of  treated  wastewater  in  Kelamayi  will  diversify  the  city\u2019s \nwater sources and allow the use of increasingly scarce potable water for only essential domestic \npurposes. The project will contribute to the cities\u2019 target of achieving the status of \u201cmodel water-\nsaving cities\u201d by 2018.15\n  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe  impact  will  be  improved  living  conditions  and  environmental  sustainability  in  the \ncities of Kelamayi and Kuitun. The outcome will be improved urban management and services, \nincluding upgraded water supply, roads, and flood control in the project cities. \n \n\n                                                \n10  ADB. 2012.

Output  1  will have  five \ncomponents: (i) upgrading of the Nanjiao wastewater treatment plant by adding new wastewater \nreclamation  facilities  with  treatment  capacity  of  100,000  cubic  meters  (m3)  per  day; \n(ii) construction of the Jiugongli wetland16\n with a surface area of 13.31 square kilometers (kms), \nan average depth of 2 meters, and adequate water volume to receive treated effluent from the \nNanjiao wastewater treatment plant; (iii) construction of 31.1 km of wastewater reuse pipelines \nto supply reuse water from the wetland for urban forestry and landscaping; (iv) construction of \n11.267  km  of  new  urban  roads;  and  (v)  improvement  of  water  management  including \nrehabilitation  of  7.9  km  of  water  supply  pipelines  and  establishment  of  an  effective  NRW \nmanagement capacity.  \n \nOutput  2:  Improvement  of  Kuitun\u2019s  urban  infrastructure.  Output  2  will  have  two \n13. \ncomponents:  (i) rehabilitation  of  flood  discharge  ditches  and  channels, 17\n with  total  length  of \n24.72 km together with the auxiliary facilities needed to meet a protection standard of a 1- in 50-\nyear flood; planting of 200,400 trees covering 83.2 hectares; and construction of related roads \nto  provide  access  and  ecological  protection,  and  improve  the  urban  visual  environment;  and \n(ii) improvement of water management including rehabilitation of 9.43 km of water supply pipes \nand significantly improved NRW management capacity.  \n \n14. \nOutput  3:  Project  management  and  capacity  building.  The  project  will  include \nintensive project management and implementation training for the Xinjiang project management \noffice  (XPMO)  and  city  project  management  offices  (PMOs),  capacity  development  assistance \nfor other concerned agencies,18\n and recruitment and management of the project implementation \nconsultants.     \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $372.70 million (Table 1). \n\n15. \n \n16. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $200  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 26-year term, including a grace period \nof  5  years,  straight  line  repayment  method,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.15%  per  year,  interests  and  other  charges  during  construction  to  be  capitalized  in  the  loan, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based \non  this,  the  average  loan  maturity  is  15.75  years  and  the  maturity  premium  payable  to  ADB  is \n0.10%  per  annum.  The  loan  will  cover  civil  works,  equipment,  project  management  consulting \nservices, and capacity building.  The government will finance the remaining amount of $172.70 \nmillion  of  project  cost  including  contingencies.  The  government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the \n\n                                                \n16  The wetland is being constructed in two phases. ADB will help fund phase 2, which covers 9.93 square kilometers.  \n17 This  includes  provision  of  seven  public  lavatories  and 95 communal household  garbage  containers  to  serve  four \ndeprived neighborhoods, and 400 garbage bins to be installed along the new flood control roads as a measure to \ndiscourage waste dumping in the flood channels.    \n\n18 Including  project  implementing  units;  O&M  agencies;  county  environmental  protection  bureaus;  and  agencies \n\ninvolved with the management of environmental, social, and resettlement safeguards. \n\n\f5 \n\nreasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms \nand conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and \nnot made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.

It  will \nimprove  the  cities\u2019  infrastructure  facilities  and  urban  environment  by  building  new  urban \ninfrastructure facilities and enhancing water resources management. Net environmental benefits \nwill be gained from broad improvements in the urban environments including the creation of new \necological  resources,  improved  wastewater  management  with  effluent  reuse,  and  increased \nresilience  to  flood  events.  The  reuse  of  wastewater  will  be  primarily  for  urban  forestry  and \nlandscaping  (greening)  to  avoid  the  use  of  freshwater  resources  (to  be  used  for  more \neconomically productive purposes).   \n \nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n20. \nAll  project  outputs  are  designed  taking  into  account  local  circumstances,  topography, \nand  climate  (arid  desert  conditions  with  long  harsh  winters),  and  in  accordance  with  relevant \nPRC  design  guidelines  and  local  regulations.  The  process  selected  for  the  enhanced \nwastewater  treatment  is  technically  proven  and  suitable  for  the  local  climate.  The  river \nrehabilitation work in Kuitun will greatly improve the resilience of the city to the potential effects \n\n\f7 \n\nof climate change, while making significant enhancements to the urban environment. Wherever \npossible, the project designs have incorporated 3R approaches and energy efficiency.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic  analysis, 20\n\n including \n\n21. \nleast-cost  analysis,  benefit\u2013cost  analysis,  and \nassessments  of  tariffs  and  affordability,  was  conducted  for  all  subcomponents.  The  least-cost \nanalysis confirms the selection of technologies for individual subcomponents. The benefit\u2013cost \nanalysis considered direct impacts on beneficiaries, as well as the social value of water savings \nand  changes  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  overall  project  and  its  components  are \neconomically  viable  with  the  economic  internal rate  of return for  each  component  in  excess of \n17.1%,  and  overall  project  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  25.5%,  which  exceed  the \neconomic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%.  The  sensitivity  analysis  considered  a  variety  of \nadverse  conditions  including  standard risks such  as  price shocks  or  project  delays,  as  well  as \nrisks  that  are  specific  to  local  conditions  such  as  a  failure  to  achieve  growth  forecasts.  The \nsensitivity  analysis  confirms  that  the  economic  performance  for  each  component  is  robust \nexcept the water management subcomponent in Kelamayi, which is sensitive to implementation \ndelays  and  the  resulting  achievement  of  project  benefits.  Measures  to  mitigate  this  risk  are \nincluded in the project design.  \n \nThe  financial  analysis  for  revenue-generating  components  was  based  on  key  financial \n22. \nratios  describing  risk  and  profitability.  It  evaluated  the  viability  of  the  proposed  investments  by \ncomparing their financial internal rates of return with the weighted average cost of capital. The \nfinancial  analysis 21\n and  related  sensitivity  analysis  found  the  project  components  financially \nviable provided that recommended tariff and capacity-building measures are implemented. The \nfinancial viability of the Kuitun NRW component is especially dependent on these measures. \n \n23. \nthe  Kelamayi  urban  road \nconstruction and the Kuitun river rehabilitation components. Counterpart funding requirements, \ndebt service costs, and recurrent project O&M costs were compared with forecast revenues and \nexpenditures  in  both  cities.  The  proposed  funds  flow  arrangement  for  the  project  is  consistent \nwith the ongoing ADB projects in Xinjiang and use proven domestic disbursement procedures. A \nfinancial  management  assessment  concludes  that  the  \u201cwith-mitigation\u201d  risk  is  low  to  medium. \nRequired  risk  mitigation  measures  are  incorporated  into  institutional  development  plans  within \nthe PAM.  \n\nFinancial  sustainability  analyses  were  completed \n\nfor \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n24. \nwith  the  XUARG  and  the  municipal  governments.  The  procurement  capacity  assessment22\n of \nthe XPMO and city PMOs concludes that the procedural arrangements in place are adequate to \nfacilitate full compliance with ADB procurement guidelines. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19).  \n \n\n                                                \n20  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

The  project  will  directly  benefit  an  estimated \n340,000 people, about 8%\u201310% are poor. Project construction will create 5,195 direct and 8,312 \nindirect  jobs,  while  the  operations  phase  will  create  104  direct  and  73  indirect  jobs.  The \nmunicipal  governments  have  committed  to  prioritize  the  employment  of  vulnerable  groups, \nincluding the poor, women, and ethnic minorities. The implementing agencies will ensure that all \nPRC labor laws and core labor standards are followed. Details on specific measures to ensure \nthe poverty and social benefits are in the social development action plan included in the PAM.23\n \nThe  social  development  action  plan  will  facilitate  continued  consultation  and  participation  of \ncommunities  in  the  project  area,  and  ensure  that  the  needs  of  the  poor  households  are \nconsidered. \n \n26. \nThe  project  has  several  design  features  to  reinforce  the  positive  benefits  of  improved \naccess and mobility, public health, and livability in the cities. The provision of public toilets and \nawareness programs on road safety, water conservation, and a public hearing process for water \ntariff reforms will help to ensure that the positive benefits of the infrastructure will be sustainable.  \n \n27. \nGender  benefits.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming. \nStakeholder consultations found that women in both cities strongly support the project, believing \nthat it will improve their quality of life, address public health risks, and create jobs and income \nopportunities. A gender action plan was prepared to ensure gender benefits accrue in key areas \nof employment, decision-making, participation, and access. Specific actions in the plan include \nemployment and training for women during construction and operation; consultation with women \non  design  and \ntoilets  and  community-based  waste  collection  and \nmanagement; and outreach, awareness-building, and targets for women's participation in water \ntariff  reform.  The  plan  will  (i)  enhance  women\u2019s  participation  in  project  activities;  (ii)  provide \ngender  sensitivity  training  to  PMO  and  implementing  agency  staff;  (iii) ensure  that  project \ndecision-making  bodies and  capacity-building  activities  are  balanced  in  terms  of the gender of \nparticipants;  and (iv)  include  appropriate gender targets,  indicators,  and gender-disaggregated \ndata for project monitoring and evaluation.24\n \n \nE. \n\nlocation  of  public \n\nSafeguards \n\nincluding \n\ninitial  environmental  examination \n\nEnvironment  (category  B).  An \n\n28. \nthe \nenvironmental  management  plan25\n was  prepared  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009),  and  posted  on  the  ADB  website  in  February  2013.  The  project  will  have  significant \nenvironmental  benefits,  mainly  by  contributing \nto  more  sustainable  water  resources \nmanagement.  Project  construction  does  have  potential  impacts  on  the  environment,  but  these \nare of a temporary nature and covered by stringent site management and procedural provisions \nin the plan, as well as by the loan assurances. The Kelamayi wetland site cleanup has particular \nrequirements in the plan for an independent environment site assessment prior to awarding of \ncivil  works  contracts.  Capacity  building  in  wetland  management,  integrated  pest management, \ncarbon  sequestration  silviculture,  water  conservation,  and  NRW  management  will  help  O&M \nunits ensure environmental sustainability of project operations.   \n \n\n                                                \n23 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25  Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f9 \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  A).  Based  on  the  impact  of  land  acquisition  and \n29. \nresettlement, the Kuitun municipal government has prepared a resettlement plan for the Kuitun \ncomponents.  Based  on  the  preliminary  impact  survey,  2,178  mu26 of  state-owned  land  will  be \nacquired. This includes 532 mu27 of cultivable land owned by a state-owned farm and will impact \n19  households  and  66 farm  employees.  In  Kuitun,  demolition  of 31,781 square meters (m2) of \nhousing  will  affect  157  households  with  600  residents.  Another  4,236  m2  of  structures  will  be \ndemolished affecting 56 shops and 127 people. About seven enterprises with 37 workers will be \naffected and 4,546 m2 of structures will be demolished. In total, 830 people will be affected by \nthe  project. The  Kelamayi  municipal  government  prepared  one  resettlement  plan  and  two  due \ndiligence  reports28 for  the  Kelamayi  urban  infrastructure  output,  for  which  15,815  mu  of  state-\nowned  land  will  be  acquired  affecting  one  state-owned  enterprise  and  two  private  enterprises \nwith  no  affected  population.  Land  acquisition  will  have  no  impacts  on  their  production  and \noperation. The resettlement  planning  and  implementation  approach  is  designed to  ensure  that \naffected persons will be better off or at least not worse off as a result of the project.29 Copies of \nthe resettlement plans in local language were sent to local offices to be easily accessible to the \naffected persons.30\n The resettlement plans were disclosed to affected persons in local language \nin February 2013 and the resettlement information booklets were distributed and posted on the \nADB website on February 2013. A grievance redress mechanism is in place.  \n \n30. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  B). Ethnic minorities constitute 7% of the population in \nKuitun  and  25%  in  Kelamayi.  Although  the  urban  communities  are  ethnically  mixed,  some \naspects such as cultural, religious, and linguistic differences are maintained. All households in \nurban  areas  will  benefit from  the  new  infrastructure.  Most  of the  ethnic minority  population  will \nnot be adversely affected by the project, except for 37 individuals of 12 households who will be \nimpacted  by  house  demolition,  and  6  households  with  11  residents  who  will  lose  their \ncommercial stores in Kuitun. Ethnic minority development plans were prepared and endorsed by \nthe  Kelamayi  and  Kuitun  municipal  governments.31\n The  plans  focus  on  measures  to  facilitate \nthe  inclusion  of  ethnic  minorities  in  all  project  activities,  and  ensure  that  their  customs  and \nbeliefs  will  be  respected  throughout  project  implementation.  Appropriate  livelihood  restoration \nmeasures  associated  with  resettlement  are  incorporated  in  the  resettlement  plans.  The  ethnic \nminority  development  plans  were  disclosed  in  March  2013  to  ethnic  minorities  in  the  areas \ntargeted  by  the  project.  Monitoring  and  reporting  arrangements  for  all  these  safeguards  are \nincluded in the PAM and the project agreement. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.32\n \n\n   \n\n                                                \n26  An  updated  census  and  detailed  measurement  survey  will  be  conducted  upon  finalization  of  the  detailed  project \n\ndesign. The resettlement plan will be updated prior to award of civil works, if there are any changes. \n\n27 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters).  \n28  The due diligence report is for (i) two demolished brickyards located within the construction area of the proposed \nwetland  construction  (phase  II);  and  (ii)  wetland  (phase  I)  being  constructed  by  the  government.  Resettlement \nplans are not required for these. \n\n29 In the PRC, resettlement plans maintain the original terminology of \"affected persons,\u201d which is equivalent to ADB's \n\ndefinition of \"displaced persons\u201d as defined in the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement. \n\n30  Resettlement Plans (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31  Indigenous Peoples Plans (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\n10 \n\nRisks \nLack of coordination and synchronization \nbetween agencies \n\nDelays in land acquisition approvals and \nimplementation \n\nDelays in counterpart funding \n\nLack of sustainable O&M of physical \ninfrastructure \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nXPMO project monitoring with support from the project \nimplementation consultant \n\nUpdating of results from the detailed measurement survey \nif the design is changed.
