An  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures,  initial \nenvironmental  examinations  for  core  subprojects,  and  a  summary  initial \nenvironmental  examinations  were  prepared  and  are  included  in  the \nsupplementary appendixes. \n \nNepal  has  made  significant  progress  in  combating  poverty  and  improving \nthe standard of living even in a conflict environment. This is evidenced by \nincreases  in  per  capita  income  and  consumption  for  all  quintiles  of  the \npopulation. However, progress has been uneven with districts far removed \nfrom  the  center  having  fewer  economic  opportunities  and  poorer  service \ndelivery.  As  a  result,  the  most  isolated  people,  disadvantaged  women, \nethnic  groups,  and  castes  have  benefited \nfrom  development \ninterventions.  Similarly,  political  and  administrative  reforms  have  been \ninadequate  to  improve  service  delivery,  transparency,  accountability,  and \ninclusiveness. Nepal, with a Gini coefficient of 47.3 in 2003, has the highest \nrate of inequality in Asia. \n \nIn  the  aftermath  of  armed  conflict,  Nepal  has  shown  commitment  and \npragmatism  in  its  efforts  to  tackle  both  the  political  and  development \nagenda,  as  evidenced  by  actions  taken  to  bring  about  electoral  and \nadministrative  reform  aimed  at  increasing  the  effectiveness  of  poverty \nreduction  policies,  service  delivery,  and  inclusive  growth.  Nonetheless, \ncontinuing  attention  to  policies  that  influence  economic  opportunities  and \npublic  service  delivery  to  improve  inclusion  and  governance  is  required. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Three-Year  Interim  Plan  forms  the  basis  for  the \neconomic and social transformation of Nepal. \n \nThe country has one of the lowest road densities for a landlocked country, \nwith some villages as far as 13 days walk from the nearest road. The lack \nof connectivity is a serious constraint for economic development and social \ninclusion.  The  assessment  made  under  the  Milennnium  Development \nGoals  indicates  the  need  for  additional  30,000  kilometers  (km)  of  rural \nroads by 2015. The country currently has about 22,000 km of rural roads. \nRoad standards vary significantly. Less than half are motorable and of this \nonly about 60% are categorized as all-weather. The need for development \nof rural transport, particularly of rural roads, is thus huge and will require a \nmajor investment in the medium term. \n\nless \n\nRecipient \n \nClassification \n \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nRationale  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact \n\n \nThe Program Grant \n\nOutcome \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\nfor \n\nto  which \n\nfor  poverty  reduction, \n\ninstitutionalizing  good  governance  and \n\n \nThe  country  operations  business  plan  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  for  Nepal  for  2008\u20132010  foresees  that  substantial  peace  and \ndevelopment  dividends  could  be  gained  by  the  economy  in  the  coming \nyears.  The  proposed  Rural  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation  Sector \nDevelopment  Program  (RRRSDP)  builds  on  ADB\u2019s  key  role  in  supporting \nthe  processes \ninclusive \ndevelopment \nthe  Government  has \ndemonstrated commitment. By extending support, ADB will provide much-\nneeded  resources  for  the  state  building  process  and  poverty  reduction  by \nsimultaneously  (i)  improving  the  policy  environment  for  inclusive  growth, \nand (ii) reconstructing and rehabilitating rural infrastructure. \n \nComprising a program grant and a project grant, RRRSDP will reduce rural \npoverty  in  hill,  mountain  and  terai  (lowlands)  districts  in  Nepal  where \nisolation and hardship are common. RRRSDP will focus on immediate post \nconflict  development  priorities  for  accelerating  poverty  reduction  and \ninclusive development, thereby enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency \nof the delivery of public services, and improving access of rural residents to \neconomic opportunities and social services. \n \n \nThe outcome of the Program will be greater economic and social inclusion, \ngood  governance,  and  accelerated  service  delivery  in  rural  infrastructure \nthrough improved polices, regulations, and institutions. \n \nThe  policy  matrix  is  structured  around  three  key  outputs  to  achieve \n(i)  enhanced  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive  development,  (ii)  improved \nand  inclusive  governance  and  decentralization,  and  (iii)  strengthened \nsupport  for  rural  infrastructure  development.  The  outputs  are  designed  to \ndirectly  address  the  core  of  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  by \nreducing  exclusion  and  poverty,  which  are  the  underlying  root  causes  of \nthe  conflict.  The  salient  features  of  the  policy  matrix  include  (i)  increasing \nthe  representation  of  women  and  excluded  groups  in  political  institutions, \nand  integrating  gender  issues  in  policy  instruments;  (ii)  improving  broad \nrepresentation  of  ethnic  groups,  castes,  and  regions  in  civil  service; \n(iii)  improving  inclusiveness  and  access  to  benefits  and  opportunities; \n(iv)  strengthening  participatory  and  transparent  budgeting;  (v)  improving \ngovernance  and  decentralization;  (vi)  enhancing \nimplementation \ncapacity of district technical offices; (vii) strengthening capacity for output, \noutcome, and impact monitoring; (viii) improving procurement and financial \nmanagement;  (ix)  supporting  policies  for  private  sector  participation  in \ninfrastructure  development;  (x)  improving  investment  opportunities;  and \n(xi) developing rural infrastructure for disadvantaged communities. \n \nA single tranche program grant of $50 million will be provided from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources upon grant effectiveness, subject to completion of \nall  of  the  policy  actions  included  in  the  policy  matrix.  In  determining  the \namount  of  the  program  grant,  the  following  factors  were  considered:  (i) \nscope and relevance of the policy reforms for improving governance, public \nservice  delivery,  and  inclusion;  (ii)  timeliness  of  assistance  to  support  the \ncountry\u2019s  return  to  economic,  political,  and  social  progress  and  stability; \n\nthe \n\n\fExecuting Agency  Ministry of Finance \n\n \nThe Project Grant \nOutcome \n\n \n\nProgram Period \n\nProcurement \n\nInvestment Plan \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\niii\n\n(iii)  immediate  cost  of  the  reforms  and  associated  financing  gap;  and \n(iv) government commitment to strengthen the decentralization process for \naccelerated poverty reduction. \n \n1 January 2008 \u2013 31 December 2011 \n \nThe  program  grant  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of \nitems  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  items \nincluded on a list of ineligible items, and imports financed by other bilateral \nand multilateral sources. The recipient will certify that the volume of eligible \nimports  exceeds  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s  projected  disbursements  under  the \nprogram component in a given period. ADB will have the right to audit the \nuse  of  the  grant  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  recipient\u2019s \ncertification. \n \n\ninfrastructure;  (iii)  enhanced  equity,  employment,  and \n\nThe  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  improved  connectivity,  enhanced \neconomic and employment opportunities, and increased access to market \nand social services of rural communities. The outputs include (i) improved \nrural  roads; (ii)  developed  and  improved  community-based  supplementary \nrural \nincome \nopportunities for the poor and disadvantaged; (iv) strengthened institutional \ncapacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Development,  Department  of  Local \nInfrastructure  Development  and  Agricultural  Roads  (DOLIDAR),  district \ndevelopment  committees,  and  communities;  and  (v)  improved  project \nmanagement. \n \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $78.4  million,  including  taxes \nand duties of $4.0 million. \n \nA  grant  not  exceeding  $50  million  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources to finance 63.8% of the total project cost.

A project coordination \nunit will be established in DOLIDAR. A project coordinator at class one will \nhead  the  unit  and  report  to  the  secretary  of  the  Ministry  of  Local \nDevelopment  through  the  director  general,  DOLIDAR.  Assisted  by  central \nimplementation  support  consultants,  the  project  coordination  unit  will \nprovide coordination and guidance for all facets of project implementation, \nincluding engineering, safeguards (environment, social, and resettlement), \nfinancial management, and procurement.  \n \nDistrict  development  committees  will  be  the  implementing  agencies  in  the \ndistricts with the district technical office as the technical wing. Each project \ndistrict  will  have  a  district  project  office  established  within  and  led  by  the \nhead  of \ntechnical  office,  and  assisted  by  a  district \nimplementation  support  team.  The  district  project  office  will  (i)  prepare \nannual work programs, (ii) finalize detailed subproject designs, (iii) ensure \nall  safeguard  measures  are  complied  with,  (iv)  supervise  all  construction \nactivities,  (v)  organize  training  in  the  communities,  and  (vi)  arrange \nprocurement. \n \nPoverty issues will be directly addressed through the positive impact of the \npolicy  actions  on  service  delivery  to  the  poor  and  excluded  groups.  The \npolicy  reform  process  will  contribute  to  overcoming  exclusionary  barriers, \npromote  inclusion,  and  bring  about  pro-poor  growth.  RRRSDP  will  help \nreform  the  political  institutions  and  bureaucracy  for  improved  service \ndelivery  and  public  accountability  with  positive \nimpacts  on  poverty \nreduction.  Affirmative  actions  will  increase  the  options  of  excluded  ethnic \ngroups/castes  and  women  to  participate  in  state  administration,  and \nactively  increase  their  control  and  command  over  resources.  Similarly,  for \nthe project grant, utilization of affirmative action will lead to more inclusive \ndevelopment outcomes. \n \nGrowth prospects will be improved because of the introduction of measures \nto  enhance  efficiency  and  transparency.  These  measures  have  the \npotential  to  stimulate  private  sector  productivity  and  investment.  The \nproject  grant  will  generate  employment  and  income  through  the  labor-\nintensive  infrastructure  work  and  development  of  livelihood  enhancement \nskills.  Linking  the  rural  population with  markets  and  technology,  RRRSDP \nwill benefit an estimated 2.6 million people. In terms of direct employment, \nit  will  generate  more  than  15.8  million  person-days  of  labor,  or  4  years  of \nfull-time work for 13,200 rural poor. \n \nRRRSDP  will  improve  and  strengthen  organizational  capabilities  for \ndeveloping and managing rural infrastructure, in particular for coordinating \npolicies  and  programs,  cooperating  with  local  bodies  in  service  delivery, \nand improving implementation capacity. It will build institutional capacity to \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nto \n\n(ii) \n\nthe \n\ninclusive, \n\n(i)  making \n\nfor  oversight,  and \n\nstreamline  existing  government  mechanisms \nmanagement of central and local financial information. \n \nRisks  include  (i)  political  instability,  including  frequent  changes  in  the \nGovernment;  and  (ii)  weak  commitment  to  implementing  new  legislation \nand regulations. Although the political transition could become stalled, the \nfirst risk will be minimized by engaging and supporting the Government in \nits  reconstruction,  rehabilitation,  and  social  and  economic \ninclusion \nendeavors.  The  second  risk  is  mitigated  as  policy  actions  taken  by  the \ninstitutions  more \nGovernment  show  commitment \nrepresentative  and \nimproving  service  delivery,  and \n(iii)  strengthening  institutions  for  accountability  and  transparency.  These \nactions demonstrate the political commitment and ownership shared by all \nparties and groups at large, and that resources will be available to continue \nthe reform process and expedite implementation of the investment Project. \nOne positive development is the emergence of strong pressure groups for \nreform  in  civil  society.  In  addition,  the  program  design  takes  into  account \nnational and local implementation capabilities. \n \nRisks  for  project  implementation  include  weak  capacity  in  the  districts  to \nmanage multilateral-funded projects, and localized tensions that could slow \nimplementation of the investment Project. These risks are mitigated as the \nproject design provides (i) capacity building programs designed to meet the \nneeds  of  the  participating  districts  and  DOLIDAR;  (ii)  project-procedure \nfinancial \ntraining \nmanagement,  environment,  and  resettlement;  (iii)  use  of  open  and \nparticipatory  consultative  discussions;  (iv)  institutionalization  of  public \naudits;  (v)  flexibility  in  design;  and  (vi)  building  on  ongoing  activities, \nespecially  the  Decentralized  Rural  Infrastructure  and  Livelihood  Project. \nExperience  during  the  conflict  period  shows  that  development  can  be \ndelivered with an appropriate design and participatory modality. \n \n\nlanguage  and  covering  procurement, \n\nlocal \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nprogram  grant,  (ii)  a  proposed  project  grant,  both  to  Nepal  for  Rural  Reconstruction  and \nRehabilitation  Sector  Development  Program  (RRRSDP),  and  (iii)  proposed  administration  by  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  of  a  loan  to  be  provided  by  the  OPEC1  Fund  for  International \nDevelopment (OFID)2 for RRRSDP.

In the  wake  of  mounting  confrontation  with  the  King \nand  his  Government  on  the  issue  of  restoring  democracy,  the  alliance  of  seven  political  parties \nsupported  by  the  Communist  Party  of  Nepal-Maoist  (CPN/M)  launched  nationwide  protests \ndemanding the reinstatement of the dissolved Parliament, and elections to a constituent assembly. \nFollowing the prolonged popular agitation, in April 2006 the King relinquished the state powers he \nhad assumed on 1 February 2005, and reinstated the dissolved Lower House of Parliament. A new \ninterim  coalition  Government  was  formed  on  2  May  2006,  headed  by  the  president  of  the  Nepali \nCongress Party. \n \n3. \nFollowing 6 months of peace dialogue the Seven Party Alliance and CPN/M signed a peace \naccord  in  November  2006.  This  marked  a  major  political  breakthrough,  and  a  prosperous, \npeaceful,  and  inclusive  Nepal  is  genuinely  believed  to  be  within  reach  after  the  11-year  armed \nconflict. The landmark Interim Constitution passed by the Interim Parliament on 15 January 2007, \nand amended in March and June 2007 with a view to meeting the demands of the wider public and \nending discrimination underscores the Government\u2019s heightened focus on inclusion as a strategy \nfor  enhancing  reconciliation,  strengthening  national  unity,  and  resolving  the  conflict.  The  Interim \nConstitution gives legal recognition to cultural diversity; provides for restructuring the state to make \nit  more  inclusive;  and  grants  special  provisions  for  underprivileged  and  vulnerable  ethnic  groups, \ncastes,  and  women  to  enable  them  to  influence  economic  policies,  institutions,  and  political \nprocesses.  The  challenge  will  be  to  develop  the  guidelines,  human  resources,  and  institutional \ncapacity to effectively implement the legislation in the districts. \n \n4. \nThe withdrawal of the CPN/M from the Interim Government on 18 September 2007 and the \npostponement  of  Constituent  Assembly  elections  originally  scheduled  for  22  November  2007 \nhighlight  the  complex  political  and  development  challenges  of  the  country.  While  some  political \ndifferences  between  the  Seven  Party  Alliance  and  CPN/M  that  led  to  the  postponement  of  the \nelections  remain  unresolved  (proclaiming  the  country  a  republic  state  before  the  Constituent \nAssembly  elections,  full  proportional  representation  in  lieu  of  the  mixed  electoral  system),  the \nCPN/M is still part of the eight-party alliance and remains firmly engaged in the political process. \nWith  the  continuation  of  the  ceasefire  and  agreement  on  the  management  of  arms,  the \nGovernment  remains  committed  to  take  forward  its  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  efforts \nthroughout the country. Moreover, the Government is aware that despite the fluid political situation, \nit must demonstrate that public services are improving if the political process is to run its course. \nOne of the immediate critical issues for the Government is the availability of financial resources for \ntimely and effective implementation of its policy reforms and inclusion agenda. \n \n                                                 \n1   OPEC is the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. \n2  A project preparatory technical assistance was provided.

Nepal, with an annual gross domestic product (GDP) per capita \nof about $300 (2005 data), is the poorest country in South Asia. With economic liberalization in the \n1990s,  the  country  achieved  an  annual  growth  rate  of  4.7%;  this  growth  rate  later  deteriorated, \nbecoming  negative  in  the  early  2000s,  largely  due  to  the  armed  conflict  that  engulfed  the  entire \ncountry  and  severely  affected  tourism  and  other  industries.  Export  growth  also  declined  sharply \nduring 2000\u20132006 resulting in an annual GDP growth rate of about 2%. \n \n6. \nThe  country  has  achieved  broad  macroeconomic  stability  despite  political  uncertainty  for \nthe  past  half  decade.  Average  annual  GDP  growth  during  2003\u20132007  was  2.7%  and  inflation \naveraged 5.5%. The current account balance was 2.2% of GDP, while the budget deficit averaged \n1.4%  of  GDP.  Nepal  is  classified  as  a  \u201cless  indebted  country;\u201d  but  its  debt  position  remains \nvulnerable  due  to  its  poor  export  performance,  low  revenue  to  GDP  ratio,  and  high  aid \ndependency. Nepal\u2019s outstanding external debt stock, which was 36.2% of GDP in fiscal year (FY) \n2006,  declined  to  29%  in  FY2007,  although  total  debt  stock  is  estimated  at  42.4%  of  GDP  in \nFY2007.  The  external  debt  service  ratio  (%  of  exports  of  goods  and  services)  rose  to  10.7%  in \nFY2007  compared  with  9.3%  in  FY2006.  The  highly  indebted  poor  country  debt  sustainability \nformula shows that Nepal\u2019s net present value of external debt to exports declined from 197.8% in \nFY2004 to 171.3% in FY 2006. Based on its past record of timely debt servicing, Nepal has shown \nit is capable of managing its external debt. \n \nThe  stable  economic  growth  in  the  1990s  brought  significant  improvements  in  access  to \n7. \nbasic social services, which reduced child mortality, increased primary school enrollment, and led \nto  more  gender  parity  in  education.  With  the  relatively  higher  growth  in  the  mid-1990s,  including \ngrowth  in  remittances,  the  incidence  of  poverty  nationwide  declined  from  42%  to  31%  between \n1996  and  2004,  a  reduction  of  about  1%  a  year.  This  annual  rate  of  decline  continued  through \n2006  when  the  incidence  of  poverty  was  estimated  to  have  fallen  below  30%.  While  per  capita \nincome  and  consumption  grew  for  all  quintiles  of  the  population,  the  livelihood  improvement  has \nbeen  uneven,  exacerbating  gender,  ethnic,  and  geographic  inequalities.  According  to  ADB's  Key \nIndicators  2007:  Inequality  in  Asia  (2007),  Nepal  has  the  highest  rate  of  inequality  in  Asia  with  a \nGini coefficient of 47.3 in 2003. \n \nADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  for  Nepal  for  2008\u20132010 3  foresees  that \n8. \nsubstantial  peace  and  development  dividends  could  be  gained  by  the  economy  in  the  coming \nyears.  The  economic  performance  of  FY2007  indicates  that  expectations  of  a  quick  economic \nturnaround  following  the  peace  accord  have  not  yet  materialized.4  However,  with  the  continuing \npeace  process,  sound  macroeconomic  management,  expansion  of  development  expenditures, \nstrong  focus  on  devolution,  and  continuance  of  policy  reforms,  GDP  growth  rates  could  reach \nabout 3% in FY2008, 5 and continue increasing over ensuing years. \n \n9. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Three-Year  Interim  Plan  (TYIP)  for  FY2008\u2013FY2010  places  special \nemphasis on social integration and inclusive development, and forms the basis for economic and \nsocial  transformation  of  the  country.  Its  primary  objectives  are  to  reduce  poverty,  create \nemployment, restructure and rehabilitate infrastructure damaged during the conflict, and establish \npeace.  It  envisages  quick  delivery  of  tangible  benefits  to  the  rural  poor  through  increases  in \ntargeted  programs  for  vulnerable  groups  and  women.  The  TYIP  projects  attaining  an  annual \naverage economic growth rate of 5.5% per annum and decreasing the percentage of people living \nbelow the poverty line to 24% by 2010. The total estimated development expenditure for the TYIP \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2007. Nepal: Country Operations Business Plan 2008\u20132010.

Since  November  2006,  the  Government  has  passed  a \nseries  of  legislative  enactments  and  regulatory  frameworks  for  ending  discrimination,  and \npromoting  inclusiveness  and  governance  for  accelerated  service  delivery  and  poverty  reduction. \nThese  include  the  Interim  Constitution;  Non-Resident  Nepali  Act;  and  amendments  to  the  Civil \nService  Act,  Citizenship  Act,  and  Procurement  Act.  In  addition,  the  Government  has  undertaken \nbroad  policy  reforms  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  public  expenditures,  strengthen  institutions, \nimprove  financial  regulations,  enhance  implementation  capacity,  and  improve  the  investment \nclimate for rural infrastructure development. By initiating improvements in policy regimes even in a \ndifficult  political  environment,  the  Government  has  clearly  demonstrated  its  commitment  to  the \nreform  process.  A  major  challenge  for  the  Government  is  to  sustain  the  momentum  and  protect \ngains  made,  while  monitoring  its  implementation  vis-\u00e0-vis  inclusion  and  balanced  regional \ndevelopment.  This  will  require  continued  attention  and  sustained  assistance  in  support  of  the \nreform process. \n \n11. \nThe Local Infrastructure Development Policy 2004, defines the rural infrastructure sector as \na  composite  of  seven  subsectors:  (i)  rural  transport,  including  rural  roads,  bridges,  and  trails;  (ii) \nrural water supply and sanitation (WSS); (iii) irrigation and river control; (iv) microhydropower; (v) \nhousing  and  urban  development;  (vi)  solid  waste  management;  and  (vii)  social  infrastructure. \nBased on the policy, an interim strategic action plan for local infrastructure development has been \napproved.  Of  the  various  rural  infrastructure  subsectors,  the  TYIP  places  the  highest  priority  on \nrural transport development allocating around 60% of investments, followed by rural WSS with 15% \nof investments. \n \n12. \nThe  Local  Infrastructure  Development  Policy,  which  operationalizes  the  Local  Self-\nGovernance  Act  1999,  provides  guidance  for  the  development  of  rural  infrastructure.  The  policy \nstipulates  devolving  planning,  design,  construction,  monitoring,  and  maintenance  of  local \ninfrastructure to local bodies such as district development committees (DDCs), municipalities, and \nvillage  development  committees  (VDCs)  with  the  involvement  of  beneficiaries  and  local \ncommunities  for  improvements  in  service  delivery,  cost-effective  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M), and sustainability of facilities. However, considerable investment in local capacity building \nis required, particularly in Nepal\u2019s remote and lagging districts. \n \n13. \nThe Nepal Living Standard Survey (2004) highlights the strong correlation between poverty \nand  access  to  economic  and  social  services.  To  achieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  an \nestimated  additional  30,000  kilometers  (km)  of  rural  roads  are  needed  by  2015  to  provide  the \nconnectivity required. At present, the country has an estimated 22,000 km of rural roads. However, \nstandards  vary  significantly.  Less  than  half  are  motorable  and  of  this  only  about  60%  are \ncategorized as all-weather (Appendix 2). The scope for developing rural transport, particularly rural \nroads, is immense and requires a major investment in the medium term. \n \n14. \nThe  Agricultural  Perspective  Plan  1996  identified  lack  of  access  as  one  of  the  principal \nreasons  for  low  agricultural  growth  and  high  incidence  of  rural  poverty.  Lack  of  connectivity  not \nonly constrains agricultural growth but also limits the effectiveness of government efforts to reduce \npoverty  by  increasing  access  to  gainful  employment  opportunities,  health  care,  education,  and \nother social services. Thus the Government\u2019s strategy for accelerated rural transport development \n0following  the  onset  of relative  peace  in  the  countryside  augurs  well  for  agricultural  development \nand economic and social services to quickly lead to overall poverty reduction. \n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\n15. \nDuring  the  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (FY2002\u2013FY2007),  public  expenditure  consistently  fell \nbelow  19%  of  GDP.  This  slump  in  public  expenditure  led  to  low  maintenance  and  rapid \ndeterioration  of  investments  in  rural  infrastructure,  as  evidenced  by  nonfunctioning  systems.  For \ninstance, water supply coverage is reported to be 77% for the total population, and of this 65% for \nrural  areas.  Many  completed  schemes  are  either  in  a  state  of  disrepair,  or  function  much  below \ntheir  design  capacity,  indicating  that  a  smaller  proportion  of  the  population  may  have  access  to \npotable water than is indicated by the official estimate. Access to reliable drinking water continues \nto be a major concern in towns, rural areas, and the hills and mountains.  \n \nDespite  increasing  demand,  only  about  70%  of  cultivated  land  is  irrigated,  of  which  40% \n16. \nhas year-round irrigation. In the absence of a functioning O&M system, almost all agency-managed \nirrigation  systems  deliver  irrigation  much  below  their  design  capacity.  Hence,  the  actual  irrigated \narea,  seasonal  and  year-round,  may  be  much  lower  than  official  estimates.  However,  farmer-\nmanaged  irrigation  systems  and  private  shallow  tubewells  function  reasonably  well  due  to \nbeneficiary participation in construction and O&M, evidencing the important role of beneficiaries for \nlong-term scheme sustainability and reliable service delivery.  \n \nADB  Country  Strategy.  The  2005\u20132009  country  strategy  and  program  for  Nepal6  \n17. \nemphasizes the need to address the root causes of the conflict by supporting broad-based growth, \ninclusive development, and good governance. It highlights the need for strong policy reforms and \ncontinued  assistance,  even  in  a  conflict  environment,  to  enable  the  country  to  keep  a  sustained \nfocus on the development agenda. It emphasizes the need for a substantial increase in investment \nin  rural  infrastructure,  and  the  need  to  adopt  a  decentralized  Labor-based,  Environment-friendly, \nand  Participatory  (LEP)  approach  for  rural  infrastructure  development  with  provision  for  careful \nsupervision  and  monitoring.  RRRSDP  objectives  and  approaches  are  consistent  with  the  thrust \nand emphasis of the country strategy and program. Continued and timely ADB assistance with a \nreasonable  degree  of  flexibility  is  critical  in  helping  Nepal  take  advantage  of  this  unique \nopportunity.  By  extending  support,  ADB  will  provide  much-needed  resources  for  continuing  the \nstate  building  process,  while  simultaneously  improving  the  policy  environment  to  accelerate \ninclusive growth. \n \nB. \n \n18. \nPoverty  and  Exclusion.  Nepal\u2019s  performance  during  the  last  decade  shows  significant \nprogress in combating poverty and improving the standard of living even in a conflict environment. \nHowever,  economic  and  social  outcomes  in  rural  areas  and  particularly  in  remote  areas  need \nsubstantial improvement. Pro-poor and inclusive development has been constrained by a legacy of \nethnic-, gender-, and caste-based exclusion, and extreme centralization in Kathmandu, which has \nhampered transparency and accountability. As a result, districts more distant from the center have \nfewer  economic  opportunities,  poorer  service  delivery,  and  higher  joblessness.  A  catalyst  is \nneeded to improve this environment and generate employment.  \n \n19. \nPersistent poverty in rural areas is linked to the unequal distribution of state resources, lack \nof connectivity, and commensurate high transport costs, which discourage the movement of goods \nand services, including ideas and technologies within and outside the region. These factors have \ncontributed  to  regional  disparities  in  economic  and  human  development  outcomes  as  well.  The \nlack of physical connectivity also correlates to the lack of social connectivity and social capital. In \nthe  absence  of  policy  reforms  addressing  the  structural  barriers  that  limit  access  to  productive \nassets  and  markets,  disadvantaged  women,  ethnic  groups,  and  castes  have  not  been  able  to \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\ncapitalize  on  the  benefits  of  development  interventions  as  evidenced  by  their  lower  human \ndevelopment indicators compared with other social groups. \n\nfor \n\nimproving  service  delivery, \n\ntransparency,  accountability,  and \n\n \n20. \nGovernance  and  Service  Delivery.  The  country\u2019s  experience  with  parliamentary \ndemocracy  since  1990  significantly  increased  political  awareness.  However,  subsequent  political \nand administrative reforms were inadequate to ensure the redistribution of economic and political \npower \ninclusiveness. \nCompounding  the  cycle  of  weak  service  delivery  and  lack  of  representation,  the  conflict  also \ndismantled  local  governments  and  stalled  decentralization,  which  was  initiated  in  1999  through \nenactment of the Local Self-Governance Act. The act provides the VDCs, DDCs, and municipalities \nwith  a  legal  framework  for  financial  and  development  responsibilities  in  their  own  localities. \nHowever, while local bodies were made responsible for service delivery, sector policies continued \nto assign these responsibilities to the central Government. In addition, all 75 districts in the country \nregardless of population size, socioeconomic status, and fiscal and human capacity were given the \nsame responsibilities in terms of the provision of services. Differences in endowments, the lack of \nclarity  in  the  assignment  of  functions  between  sector  line  ministries  and  local  bodies,  and  slow \nfiscal  transfers  from  the  center  to  local  bodies  have  constrained  service  delivery  and  good \ngovernance. \n \n21. \nInstitutional  Capacity.  Institutional  responsibility  for  rural  infrastructure  lies  with  the \nDepartment  of  Local  Infrastructure  Development  and  Agricultural  Roads  (DOLIDAR),  under  the \nMinistry  of  Local  Development  (MLD).  DOLIDAR  has  the  mandate  to  be  involved  in  all  seven \nsubsectors  of  rural  infrastructure,  and  has  accumulated  successful  experience  in  planning  and \nimplementing rural roads in coordination with the DDCs. MLD and DOLIDAR\u2019s involvement in WSS \nstarted in 1997 and expanded after approval of the Local Infrastructure Development Policy, which \nmandated  the  DDCs  to  implement  water  supply  projects  serving  up  to  1,000  people.  However, \nDOLIDAR\u2019s  capacity  needs  to  be  strengthened  for  it  to  be  involved  in  the  remaining  subsectors \nand  to  be  able  to  deliver  desired  results.  To  this  end,  the  Institutional  Strengthening  Action  Plan \nwas formulated to rationally map out capacity development. The World Bank and ADB have been \ncontributing to plan implementation to improve capacities at MLD, DOLIDAR, and the DDCs. \n \n22. \nSeveral  donor  agencies  support  DOLIDAR\u2019s  rural  infrastructure  development  programs, \nparticularly  rural  roads.  Though  donors  have  coordinated  well  in  the  sector,  projects  have  taken \nseparate  approaches  for  implementation,  putting  pressure  on  the  Government  and  the  DDCs\u2019 \nlimited  technical  and  administrative  capacity,  and  creating  confusion  among  government  staff. \nAlthough quality is maintained in donor-supported rural roads, these standards are not rigorously \napplied  to  Government-  and  DDC-financed  projects  and  programs.  Approaches  and  institutional \narrangements  thus  need  to  be  harmonized  for  implementing  rural  roads  regardless  of  financing \nsource  with  standards  and  best  practice  approaches  adopted  (including  LEP,  supplementary \ntraining and investment for communities, and community audit). \n \n23. \ninvestment \nrequirements  to  restore  and  rehabilitate  rural  infrastructure,  and  implement  appropriate  policy \nreforms to achieve the intended goal of social and economic transformation of Nepal. Support to \neffectively  implement  legislation  and  policies  to  ensure  inclusion  and  poverty  reduction  is \nimperative  to  keep  a  sustained  focus  on  development.  Similarly,  the  DDCs  need  institutional \nstrengthening  to  effectively  implement  activities  identified  for  all  the  subsectors.  Despite  DDC \ncapacity  constraints,  investment  in  the  rural  road  subsector  is  justified  due  to  the  Government\u2019s \npriority; DDC experience and confidence in planning, implementation, and management; and rural \nroads\u2019  direct  contribution  to  enhanced  connectivity,  productivity,  and  employment  opportunities. \nInvestment in WSS and other subsectors is also justified if the schemes are small-scale, are under \nthe jurisdiction of the DDCs, and serve poor households and disadvantaged communities. \n\nInterim  Development  Requirements.  The  TYIP  estimates  substantial \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nrural \n\ninfrastructure  development  and \n\nExternal  Assistance.  Numerous \n\n \nlivelihood \n24. \nimprovement projects in Nepal have focused on community-based infrastructure. Projects on rural \nroads,  WSS,  and  irrigation  have  been  supported  by,  among  others,  ADB,  Department  for \nInternational  Development  (DFID)  of  the  United  Kingdom,  Swiss  Agency  for  Development  and \nCooperation (SDC), and the World Bank. Major ongoing rural infrastructure projects in line with the \nGovernment\u2019s  decentralization  framework  include  the  ADB-supported  Community-Based  Water \nSupply and Sanitation Sector Project, ADB- and SDC-supported Decentralized Rural Infrastructure \nand  Livelihood  Project  (DRILP),  SDC-supported  District  Road  Support  Program,  DFID-supported \nRural  Access  Program,  and  World  Bank  and  SDC-supported  Rural  Access  Improvement  and \nDecentralization Project. Details on externally aided projects in the sector are provided in Appendix \n3. \n \nLessons.  The  design  of  RRRSDP  considers  lessons  from  completed  and  ongoing  rural \n25. \ninfrastructure projects, as well as reform programs in Nepal and other countries. Lessons include \nthe following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  fluid  political  environment  may  affect  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  implement \nreforms effectively and at the required pace. The policy conditions, including major \ninstitutional  reforms,  must  be  based  on  Government  capacity  and  willingness  to \nimplement, \nin  consensus  with  concerned  stakeholders  and  agencies.  An \nincremental  process-oriented  approach  that  allows  momentum  for  reforms  to  build \nand support the process itself will have a higher potential to deliver results. \nRural  roads  are  accorded  the  highest  priority  for  rural  infrastructure  development, \nincome generation, and poverty reduction. The full impacts of road investments will \nbe realized when complemented by community-based, demand-driven, small-scale \ninvestments.  \nIncreasing  community  ownership  and  commitment  for  O&M  requires  analysis  of \nuser  demands  and  needs,  while  securing  user  participation  in  all  stages  of  the \nproject cycle. \nThe LEP approach calls for a flexible design and requires adequate up-front support \nfor  community  and  labor  group  mobilization  and  training,  including  timely  technical \nbackstopping  and  supervision,  to  ensure  quality  standards  and  compliance  with \nsafeguard measures. \n\n(v)  While the DDCs are responsible for planning and implementing rural infrastructure, \nthe  central  Government  has  an  important  role  in  policy  formulation  for  regulating \nimplementation  procedures,  environmental  and  social \ndesign  standards, \nsafeguards,  eligibility  and  prioritization  criteria,  and \nfinancial  management \nprocedures including the provision of technical oversight. \nResources  for  preparation  and  implementation  of  required  social  safeguard \nmeasures  including  resettlement  plans  should  be  made  available  on  time  to  avoid \nproject  start-up  delays.  A  government  resettlement  policy  is  needed  so  that  each \nproject does not need to generate an additional framework. \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii)  O&M  needs  to  be  addressed  from  the  beginning  of  subproject  development  to \nrespond to such issues as skills shortage, weak capacity, and resource availability, \nand withstand political bias for new construction over maintenance. \n\n \n26. \nRural  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation.  Following  the  restoration  of  relative  peace  in \nthe  countryside,  the  Government  plans  to  launch  a  concerted  effort  to  rehabilitate  rural \ninfrastructure  that  was either  damaged  or  rendered  nonoperational  during  the conflict.  The  policy \nreforms  under  the  program  grant  will  (i)  create  a  conducive  environment  for  successful \nimplementation  of  the  investment  project  focusing  on  rural  infrastructure  reconstruction  and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nrehabilitation, and (ii) create an environment for ensuring more equal distribution of the direct and \nindirect benefits flowing from such investments. The policy reforms will address ways to enhance \nefficiency  in  implementing  the  investment  activities,  particularly  relating  to  inclusion,  poverty \nreduction,  governance,  financial  management,  procurement,  poverty  prioritization,  and  service \ndelivery.  The  Project  will  improve  local  infrastructure  such  as  rural  roads  to  provide  the  rural \npopulation  with  better  access  to  markets  and  public  services.  These  improvements  will  lay  the \nfoundation for better economic opportunities and assist in reducing poverty. \n \n27. \nRRRSDP will also support initiating a harmonized program-based approach (PBA) to rural \ninfrastructure development. Aiming to follow similar fund-flow mechanisms and financial reporting, \nand to adopt identical implementation procedures, a common framework will serve as a vehicle for \ndonors to pool resources and fund rural infrastructure investment more efficiently. \n \nRRRSDP  will  be  implemented  while  the  DRILP  is  still  under  implementation.  DRILP \n28. \nimplementation started slowly partly due to the conflict and to the late establishment of the district \nimplementation support team (DIST) and appointment of the district engineers. RRRSDP will seek \nto  rectify  the  latter  problem.  Sufficient  lead  time  needs  to  be  allowed  for  preparatory  work  for \nengineering  design,  social  mobilization,  and  resettlement  and  environmental  assessments,  along \nwith efforts to undertake these activities simultaneously as much as possible. \n \nThe project grant for RRRSDP will focus on Nepal's 20 districts7 not yet covered by major \n29. \ndonor-funded rural road infrastructure projects. The Project will additionally provide complementary \nsupport to the existing 18 DRILP districts8 for rural WSS \u2500 a cited priority of the Government. The \nremaining  37  districts  of  the  country  are  either  already  covered  or  soon  to  be  covered  by  similar \nprojects including the (i) Rural Access Improvement and Decentralization Project, which covers 20 \ndistricts;  the  World  Bank  has  committed  to  expand  it  to  an  additional  10  districts;  and  (ii)  Rural \nAccess Program, which covers 7 districts, for which DFID is planning to continue with a follow-on \nproject  (Rural  Access  Program  II).  With  such  a  coordinated  effort,  all  75  of  the  country's  districts \nwill be covered by donor-funded initiatives in this sector. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nImpact \n\nA. \n \n30. \nRRRSDP  will  reduce  rural  poverty  in  hill,  mountain,  and  terai  (lowlands)  districts  where \nisolation  and  hardship are  common.  It  will  focus  on immediate  postconflict  development  priorities \nfor accelerated poverty reduction and inclusive development, thereby enhancing the effectiveness \nand  efficiency  of  the  delivery  of  public  services,  and  improving  the  access  of  rural  residents  to \neconomic opportunities and social services. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n7   The  20  new  districts  are  (i)  Dhankuta,  Ilam,  Jhapa,  Morang,  Panchthar,  and  Sunsari  from  the  Eastern  Development \nRegion; (ii) Bhaktapur, Chitwan, Dolakha, Kabhrepalanchok, Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Sindhuli, and Sindhupalchowk from \nthe Central Development Region; (iii) Manang, Mustang, and Parbat from the Western Development Region; (iv) Rolpa \nand Rukum from the Midwestern Development Region; and (v) Dadeldhura from the Farwestern Development Region. \n8 The 18 DRILP districts are (i) Okhaldhunga, Solukhumbu, and Taplejung from the Eastern Development Region;  (ii) \nRamechhap  from  the  Central  Development  Region;  (iii)  Baglung,  Gorkha,  Lamjung,  and  Myagdi  from  the  Western \nDevelopment  Region;  (iv)  Dolpa,  Humla,  Kalikot,  Mugu,  Jajarkot,  and  Jumla  from  the  Midwestern  Development \nRegion; and (v) Baitadi, Bajhang, Bajura, and Darchula from the Farwestern Development Region. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nB. \n \n\nThe Program Grant \n\n1. \n\nOutcome \n\n31. \nThe proclamations by the Interim Parliament place inclusion at the center of key legislative \nenactments  and  address  the  root  causes  of  the  conflict,  thus  providing  the  starting  point  for  the \nprogram grant. The outcome of the program grant will be support for the Government in timely and \neffective  implementation  of  reforms  for  greater  economic  and  social  inclusion,  good  governance, \nand improved service delivery in rural infrastructure. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n32. \nBuilding  upon  the  country\u2019s  legislative  and  administrative  reforms  aimed  at  increasing  the \neffectiveness of poverty reduction policies, service delivery, and inclusive growth, the Program will \nassist the Government in achieving three key outputs: (i) enhanced poverty reduction and inclusive \ndevelopment,  (ii)  improved  and  inclusive  governance  and  decentralization,  and  (iii)  strengthened \nsupport for rural infrastructure development. The outputs are designed to address the core goals of \nreducing exclusion and poverty, which are the underlying causes of the conflict, and remain central \nto  achieving  a  lasting  peace.  The  policy  matrix  in  Appendix  4  presents  the  essential  actions \ngrouped under these three headings. \n \n\na. \n\nEnhanced Poverty Reduction and Inclusive Development \n\n \n33. \nThe  Government  has  taken  impressive  policy  initiatives  to  make  institutions  more \nrepresentative  and  inclusive,  and  to  strengthen  their  accountability  and  transparency.  This \ncomponent  supports  efforts  to  (i)  increase  representation  of  women  and  excluded  groups  in \npolitical institutions; (ii) improve broad representation of women, ethnic groups, castes, and regions \nin  the  civil  service;  (iii)  improve  inclusiveness  and  access  to  benefits  and  opportunities;  (iv) \nstrengthen  participatory  and  transparent  budgeting;  and  (v)  mainstream  gender  in  public \nadministration. \n \n34. \nRepresentation  of  Women  and  Excluded  Groups  in  Political  Institutions.  The \nrestoration  of  democracy  in  1990  saw  little  change  in  the  participation  of  women,  ethnic  groups, \nand disadvantaged castes in elected government. One major reason for their underrepresentation \nis their limited participation in political parties, as evidenced by a low 5%\u20136% for women, 15% for \nethnic groups and madhesi, and virtually zero for dalits.9 As a result these groups have had little \ninfluence in selecting candidates for elections who, once in power, appoint cabinet ministers, and \ninfluence  the  appointment  of  civil  servants  and  consequently  policy  decisions.  Lessons  from  the \n1997  local  elections  demonstrate  that  when  electoral  policies  mandate  quotas,  the  political \nrepresentation  of  the  mandated  groups  increases  substantially,  as  was  the  case  for  women.  The \nInterim  Constitution  (2007)  envisages  bringing  about  broad  electoral  reform,  and  provides  for \ninclusiveness in the selection of candidates for the Constituent Assembly by political parties for the \n\u201cfirst  past  the  post\u201d  and  proportional  electoral  systems.  The  Constituent  Assembly  Member \nElectoral Act allocates seats to women, dalits, ethnic groups, madheshis, and the differently-abled, \namong  others  for  the  240  electoral  seats  under  the  proportional  electoral  system.  Further,  the \nGovernment  has  demonstrated  its  commitment  to  inclusion  by  ratifying  the  International  Labor \nOrganization  Convention  on  Indigenous  and  Tribal  Peoples  (No.  169).  These  actions  will \nsubstantially  increase  the  representation  of  women  and  excluded  groups  in  political  institutions, \nand improve accountability and inclusion for economic recovery and growth. \n \n\n                                                 \n9 Madhesi are traditional residents of the terai, and dalits are socially excluded castes. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n35. \nGender and Socially Inclusive Civil Service. As in political institutions, the participation of \nwomen,  ethnic  groups,  and  disadvantaged  castes  in  state  bureaucracy  is  negligible.  No \nimprovement was made in the recruitment of gazetted officers from the dalits, ethnic groups, and \nterai castes during the decade post 1990. The share of ethnic groups in the judiciary is a low 2.4% \nand the civil service is only 2.3%. Women comprise 9% of the civil service, with only 2% among the \ndecision makers. The 2007 gazetted amendment of the Civil Service Act provides for new inclusive \nprovisions  by  reserving  45%  of  vacant  posts  for  women,  ethnic  groups,  madheshis,  dalits, \ndifferently-abled,  and  underdeveloped  regions.  This  has  ensured  broad  representation  of  ethnic \ngroups,  castes,  and  men  and  women  in  the  policy-making  bodies  and  state  institutions,  and  will \nincrease the effectiveness of the civil service, and improve public accountability. \n \n36. \nInclusiveness  and  Access  to  Benefits  and  Opportunities.  The  Government  is \ncommitted  to  remedying  exclusion  and  has  taken  policy  actions  and  measures  to  improve  the \nconditions of excluded groups. The TYIP Approach Paper highlights inclusion as one of its pillars \nand places special emphasis on social integration, inclusive development, employment generation, \nand  economic  and  social  transformation;  while  directing  attention  to  disadvantaged  women, \nexcluded  and  vulnerable  groups,  including  regions  that  have  been  historically  isolated  from \nmainstream  development.  The  TYIP  envisages  increases  in  targeted  programs  to  protect \nvulnerable groups and women as part of its social protection plan. The budget (FY2008) allocates \nNRs51 billion for community programs based on people\u2019s participation, and social security that will \ndirectly  contribute  to  poverty  reduction,  and  has  doubled  block  grants  to  the  VDCs  (NRs1  million \nfor  each  VDC).  The  National  Planning  Commission  (NPC)  will  submit  the  TYIP  to  Cabinet  for \napproval  by  30  November  2007.  Similarly,  the  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works  has \napproved the Interim Guidelines for Enhancing Poverty Reduction Impacts of Road Projects. The \nguidelines have developed procedures in line with the Public Works directive as well as familiarize \nDepartment  of  Road  officials  with  the  basic  concepts  of  poverty  and  linkages  between  road \ninvestments and poverty reduction. \n \nIn  addition,  MLD  has  prepared  an  action  plan  for  strengthening  the  registration  of  vital \n37. \nevents  such  as  birth,  death,  marriage,  divorce,  and  migration.  This  will  promote  more  inclusive \nplanning, while facilitating the acquisition of citizenship. A recent ADB study found that the highest \nrates of nonregistration of births were among women, ethnic minorities, and disadvantaged groups. \nSimilarly, the amended Citizenship Act includes provision for the acquisition of citizenship through \nthe mother\u2019s citizenship. This will significantly reduce exclusion, as the possession of legal identity \ninfluences an individual\u2019s access to services, benefits, and opportunities. \n \nPrioritized  and  Transparent  Budgeting.  All  activities  in  the  development  budget  are \n38. \nprioritized and ranked in terms of their contribution to poverty reduction (with P1 as the highest and \nP3 the lowest). Prioritization criteria include (i) contribution to poverty reduction, (ii) contribution to \nsector  goals,  (iii)  contribution  to  regional  development,  (iv)  rationale  for  government  involvement, \n(v) participation, (vi) project status, and (vii) fund commitment. While the criteria made a good start \nfor  targeted  investments,  implementation  experience  indicates  the  need  for  more  robust \nprioritization criteria to secure effective allocation of resources for reducing poverty and promoting \ninclusion.  NPC  has  established  a  task  force  with  terms  of  reference  to  refine  the  prioritization \ncriteria, which will be reflected in the medium-term expenditure framework of FY2009 and in new \nregional and social programs with secured budget allocations. This will support a more transparent \nand  participatory  budgeting  process  along  with  improved  prioritization  criteria  and  district \nallocations based on poverty and social exclusion.  \n \n39.  Mainstreaming  Gender.  Gender-based  exclusion  restricts  women\u2019s  access  to  education, \nemployment opportunities, and decision-making processes. To mainstream gender, the Ministry of \nAgriculture  and  Cooperatives,  Ministry  of  General  Administration,  and  Ministry  of  Education  and \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nSports  have  prepared  gender  strategies  focused  on  alleviating  constraints  and  creating  new \nopportunities  for  women.  These  strategies  will  facilitate  monitoring  of  gender  equity  and  access, \nand inform policy decisions in the respective sectors. \n \n\nb. \n\nImproved and Inclusive Governance and Decentralization \n\n \n40. \nThis  component  will  provide  support  for  (i)  support  decentralization  for  inclusiveness;  (ii) \nenhance  capacity  for  output,  outcome,  and  impact  monitoring;  and  (iii)  improve  procurement  and \nfinancial management. These policy reforms are envisaged to significantly improve fiscal discipline, \nespecially  in  times  of  political  instability,  and  prepare  the  foundations  for  good  and  inclusive \ngovernance. \n \n41. \nDecentralization for Inclusiveness. The Interim Constitution envisions (i) restructuring the \nstate  in  response  to  popular  demands,  (ii)  reforming  political  institutions  to  make  them  more \ninclusive, and (iii) providing greater autonomy to local bodies for decision making regarding public \nresources. It also provides for establishing the state restructuring commission to (i) bring about an \nend  to  discrimination  based  on  class,  caste,  language,  culture,  religion, and  region by  discarding \nthe  centralized  and  unitary  form  of  government,  and  (ii)  make  the  state  more  inclusive  and \ndemocratic  through  progressive  restructuring.  An  acceptable  restructuring  of  the  state  will \ncontribute to securing a lasting peace and end interethnic, caste, and regional tensions. \n\ntransparency \n\n \nStrengthened  Capacity  for  Output,  Outcome,  and  Impact  Monitoring.  Improving \n42. \ngovernance  and \ninclusive  development  requires \nfor  poverty  reduction  and \nunderstanding  the  extent  to  which public  resources  are  effectively  translated  into public services. \nMapping fiscal flows and incorporating concepts related to management for development results in \nthe public sector training curricula of Nepal Administrative Staff College will strengthen capacity for \noutput, outcome, and impact monitoring. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has agreed to expand its \npublic  expenditure  tracking  by  instructing  the  Financial  Comptroller  General  Office  to  conduct \nsurveys  in  two  sectors  per  year.  Monitoring  actual  allocations  versus  budgeted  ones  will  provide \ninsights into constraints and achievement of the intended objectives. \n \n43. \nImproved  Procurement  and  Financial  Management.  The  Government  revised  the \nprocurement  laws  to  increase  efficiency  and  transparency  resulting  in  its  new  Procurement  Act \napproved  in  December  2006  and  gazetted  in  January  2007.  The  act  provides  for  a  more \ntransparent and competitive procurement and bidding process for goods, civil works, and services; \nand is in line with acceptable international procedures such as the United Nations Commission for \nInternational  Trade  Law.  The  Procurement  Regulations  were  revised  vis-\u00e0-vis \nthe  new \nProcurement  Act  and  approved  in  August  2007.  Similarly,  the  Government  has  approved  the \nrevised Local Bodies Financial and Administrative Regulations (LBFAR) to align them with the new \nProcurement Act and its regulations. The revised LBFAR will (i) increase the financial authority of \nlocal  bodies  enabling  them  to  provide  services  swiftly,  (ii)  improve  transparency  by  providing \ncommunity procurement and public audit, and (iii) enhance accountability by requiring adherence \nto  a  procurement  code  of  conduct.  The  program  grant  will  support  implementation  of  the  new \nProcurement Act, Procurement Regulations, and LBFAR. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  decision  to  establish  the  Public  Procurement  Monitoring  Office  in  the \n44. \nOffice  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  Council  of  Ministers,  headed  by  a  secretary,  contributes  to \ninstitutionalizing  accountability  and  transparency  within  the  state  bureaucracy.  Furthermore,  all \nDDC  accounts  are  now  computerized,  which  will  assist  in  addressing  the  problem  of  weak \naccounting and reporting procedures in the districts. As data will be transferred electronically from \nthe  districts  to  the  center,  fund  releases  will  be  faster,  which  will  expedite  implementation  and \ndisbursement.  To  strengthen  the  procurement  capacity  of  implementing  agencies,  procurement \nstaff in the DDCs and DOLIDAR will need to be trained. MLD has prepared a training plan for its \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nstaff  in  DDCs  and  DOLIDAR.  Procurement  reform  and  capacity  improvement  are  expected  to \nimprove contract management and procurement procedures. \n \n45. \nTo  improve  budget  allocation,  MLD  has  approved  a  manual,  Minimum  Conditions  and \nPerformance Measures, for performance-based budget allocation, collected baseline data for all 75 \ndistricts, and conducted orientation programs in all 75 districts on use of the manual. \n \n\nc. \n\nStrengthened Support for Rural Infrastructure Development \n\nin \n\nincluding \n\nimproving \n\ninvestment  opportunities \n\nPolicies  for  Private  Sector  Participation \n\nThis  component  will  provide  support  for  (i)  policies  for  private  sector  participation  in \ninfrastructure \n\n \n46. \ninfrastructure  development,  (ii) \ndevelopment, and (iii) rural infrastructure development for disadvantaged communities. \n \nInfrastructure  Development.  The \n47. \nGovernment  is  promoting  private  sector  participation  for  broad-based  labor-intensive  growth. \nClosely related to improving connectivity and rural infrastructure is the need to improve the policy \nenvironment  to  attract  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  development.  To  improve  the \ninvestment  climate,  Nepal  Rastra  Bank  has  approved  a  monetary  policy  that  includes  a \ncommitment  to  issue  separate  regulations  relating  to  capital,  investment,  loan  loss  provisioning, \nand other regulatory norms for establishing an infrastructure development bank. NPC will establish \na  task  force  with  terms  of  reference  to  prepare  policies  for  public-private-partnerships.  Given  the \nscarcity  of  resources,  public-private  partnership  will  increase  the  effectiveness  of  public \nexpenditures. \n \nInvestment Opportunities. In response to the demands of nonresident Nepalis (NRNs) for \n48. \na more enabling and NRN-friendly policy environment for investment in the country\u2019s development \nprocess,  the  Government  promulgated  the  NRN  Act  in  August  2007.  The  act  has  simplified  the \nregulatory  environment  and  administrative  procedures  for  NRNs  investing  in  the  country.  The \nGovernment  presented  the  draft  NRN  regulations  for  implementing  the  NRN  Act  to  the  NRN \nConference on 15\u201317 October 2007. \n \n49. \nInfrastructure  Development  for  Disadvantaged  Communities.  The  Rural \nInfrastructure Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Investment Plan accords high priority and commits \nthe Government to rural transport development. Lack of connectivity is a serious constraint. Nepal \nhas one of lowest road densities for a landlocked country; some villages are as far as 13 days walk \nfrom  the  nearest  road.  The  interim  Strategic  Action  Plan  for  Local  Infrastructure  Development \nenvisages increasing the access of 95% of rural residents including disabled, marginalized groups, \nand  dalits  to  social  services,  economic  opportunities,  and  resources.  DOLIDAR  is  incorporating \npoverty  and  social  inclusion  concerns  into  its  Approach  for  the  Development  of  Rural  and \nAgriculture Roads with the objective of ensuring that all plans and programs prepared by the DDCs \nand DTOs use poverty and inclusion as prioritizing criteria. \n \n50. \nThe lack of a common set of guidelines for all infrastructure projects on social mobilization, \ninclusive  participation,  gender  sensitization,  prioritization,  planning,  safeguards  for  vulnerable \ngroups, and environment have been major factors that delay implementation schedules. MLD has \nidentified  a  common  set  of  guidelines  to  speed  implementation  and  deliver  tangible  results.  The \nguidelines will ensure inclusiveness and adequate safeguards of vulnerable communities. MLD has \nissued an instruction to all DDCs to ensure the use of these common guidelines. \n \n51. \nSimilarly, in the absence of a consistent approach to treating safeguard policy issues, NPC \nhas taken the lead in formulating a comprehensive national policy on resettlement, to help identify, \nplan, implement, and monitor involuntary resettlement to minimize displacement, safeguard people \n\nRural \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\naffected  by  development  projects,  and  enhance  development  impact.  NPC  has  prepared  and \nsubmitted the draft National Resettlement Policy to Cabinet for approval.  \n \n\n3. \n\nImportant Features \n\nThe extensive reforms taken by the Interim Parliament to directly address the root causes \n52. \nof  the  conflict  merit  ADB  support  for  implementation.  These  reforms  aim  to  end  discrimination, \npromote inclusion, and justify support for the continuation of peace and development efforts. The \nGovernment  has  placed  inclusion  at  the  center  of  key  legislative  enactments  and  regulatory \nframeworks for achieving inclusive development outcomes and accelerated poverty reduction. The \nsingle  tranche  will  deliver  a  peace  dividend  to  Nepal  during  this  critical  juncture  in  the  country's \nhistory.  The  Program  builds  on  Government  reforms  and  furthers  ADB\u2019s  role  as  a  partner  in \nsupporting  the  process  for  institutionalizing  good  governance  and  inclusive  development.  The \nProgram  is  designed  taking  into  account  national  and  local  commitment  and  implementation \ncapabilities.  \n \n53. \nThe  program  grant  will  be  released  in  a  single  tranche  upon  effectiveness,  subject  to \nfulfillment  of  all  of  the  policy  actions.  The  single  tranche  is  justified  by  (i)  compliance  with  29 \nactions,  which  constitute  fundamental  reforms  in  governance,  inclusion,  devolution,  procurement, \nand  infrastructure  development  for  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive  development;  and  (ii) \nimprovements in the political environment, and immediate postconflict development requirements. \n \n\n4. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nThe  Government  has  requested  a  grant  of  $50,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \n54. \nresources upon completion of all of the policy actions included in the policy matrix. In determining \nthe amount of the program grant, the following factors were considered: (i) scope and relevance of \nthe policy reforms for improving governance, public service delivery, and inclusion; (ii) timeliness of \nassistance  in  support  of  the  process  for  the  country\u2019s  return  to  economic,  political,  and  social \nprogress and stability; (iii) immediate cost of the reforms and associated financing gap (Appendix \n5);  and  (iv)  Government  commitment  to  strengthen  the  decentralization  process  for  accelerated \npoverty reduction. \n \n\n5. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n55. \nProgram  Management.  MOF  is  the  Executing  Agency,  and  will  coordinate  policy,  legal, \nand  regulatory  actions.  MOF  will  ensure  that  the  policy  reforms  as  agreed  to  by  ADB  and  the \nGovernment and as described in the development policy letter (Appendix 4) are duly carried out in \na timely manner. In particular, MOF will ensure that provisions for reporting, monitoring, auditing, \nand other administrative requirements will be strictly followed. The program grant will support part \nof  the  Government\u2019s  budgetary  requirements  to  undertake  postconflict  development  priorities  as \nspecified in its TYIP. \n \n56. \nDecember 2011. \n \n57. \nProcurement and Disbursement. The program grant will be released in a single tranche \nupon compliance with all the policy actions listed in the Policy Matrix. The grant will be disbursed \nusing the simplified procedures approved by ADB\u2019s Board on 16 April 1998.10 The proceeds will be \nused  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member \n\nImplementation  Period.  The  Program  will  be  implemented  from  1  January  2008  to  31 \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\ncountries, excluding items included in a list of ineligible items (Appendix 6), and imports financed \nby  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  MOF  will  certify  that  the  volume  of  eligible  imports \nexceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the program component in a given \nperiod. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the grant proceeds, and to verify the accuracy of \nthe MOF\u2019s certification. \n \n58. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to, \nand  discussed  with  the  Government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant \nregulations. Moreover, all relevant ADB guidelines, including the Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time), Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime), and Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time), were brought to \nthe attention of the Government. \n \nCounterpart  Funds.  The  counterpart  funds  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the  program \n59. \ngrant will (i) supplement the Government\u2019s budget in support of the reform package, and (ii) be part \nof the Government\u2019s contribution to ADB-assisted RRRSDP activities within the scope of the TYIP. \nThese  include  mostly  capital  investments  and  additional  investments  for  immediate  postconflict \nrural reconstruction and rehabilitation development works.  \n \n60. \nProgram  Performance  Monitoring  System.  MOF  will  monitor  and  report  to  ADB  the \nimplementation of policy actions and their impact on inclusive development, good governance, and \nimproved  service  delivery,  in  line  with  the  program  impact  and  outcome  indicators  agreed  upon \nwith the Government.  \n \n61. \nreviews.  \n \nC. \n \n\nProgram  Review.  Program  reviews  will  be  carried  out  in  conjunction  with  the  project \n\nThe Project Grant \n\n1. \n\nOutcome \n\nThe  Project  will  improve  connectivity,  enhance  economic  and  employment  opportunities, \n\n62. \nand increase access to market and social services by rural communities. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n63. \nThe  project  outputs  include  (i)  improved  rural  roads;  (ii)  developed  and  improved \ncommunity-based  supplementary  rural  infrastructure;  (iii)  enhanced  equity,  employment,  and \nincome  opportunities  for  the  poor  and  disadvantaged;11  (iv)  strengthened  institutional  capacity  of \nMLD, DOLIDAR, DDCs, and communities; and (v) improved project management. \n \n\na. \n\nRural Roads \n\nRural roads are the predominant demand according to district surveys conducted by MLD. \n\n64. \nThe roads to be included must be from the district transport master plans.12 \n\n                                                 \n11  For the purpose of the Project, disadvantaged groups are, as commonly understood, socially excluded castes (dalits), \nethnic groups,  madhesi middle caste group, minority Muslims, poor households  headed by  women, and the isolated \npopulation from remote areas. \n\n12  The DDC in each district develops a district transport master plan using an analytical, participatory, and consultative \n\nprocess to identify road priorities for the district. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nIn 20 non-DRILP districts, RRRSDP will improve or upgrade about 560 km of rural roads. \n65. \nThe  civil  works  will  be  for  continuous  roads  only  (not  partial  sections)  that  connect  the  rural \npopulation to market centers, towns, and the higher road network. Qualifying civil works include (i) \nreconstruction  of  rural  roads  damaged  due  to  conflict;  (ii)  rehabilitation  and  preservation  of  rural \nroads that fell into disrepair during conflict; and (iii) rural roads that were planned but could not be \ncompleted due to conflict. The road construction will include an estimated 1,100 meters of bridges \n(a  total  of  about  42  bridges).  The  roads  will  be  built  to  DOLIDAR  standards,  adopting  a  LEP \napproach.  Road-building  groups  (RBGs)  will  undertake  most  subproject  works.  Only  in  cases \nwhere  the  road  works  are  more  technical  and  complex  (i.e.,  bridge  construction  or  paving)  will \ncontractors be engaged. \n \n66.  Maintenance. Each participating district should have an O&M strategy, and the Project will \nsupport the DDCs to implement the O&M plan  as per the district\u2019s O&M strategy. Each DDC  will \nestablish a maintenance fund for maintaining district roads, main trails, and bridges. To support the \ndevelopment  of  local  resources  for  maintenance,  financing  for  district  roads  maintenance  will  be \nprovided  under  the  Project  on  a  matching  and  declining  basis.13  Financing  maintenance  after \nproject  completion  will  be  the  DDCs\u2019  continuing  responsibility.  Project  assistance  will  also \ncontribute to training for the organization, management, and physical aspects of maintenance. The \nDDCs will form and operate user committees representing transport operators to manage road use, \nmonitor  road  conditions  and  maintenance  performance,  and  mobilize  additional  resources  for \nmaintenance.  In  addition,  the  Road  Board  Nepal  is  required  to  allocate  30%  of  its  annual \nmaintenance allotment to local bodies for local road maintenance, and the DDCs can apply for and \naccess the Road Board funds. \n \n\nb. \n\nSupplementary Infrastructure \n\n \n67. \nThis  component  will  complement  the  rural  road  improvements  by  constructing  and \nrehabilitating  community,  demand-driven  supplementary  infrastructure  such  as  social  and  market \nfacilities,  school  infrastructure,  micro-irrigation,  link  trails,  trail  bridges,14  and  rural  WSS.15  The \ninvestments  will  typically  generate  additional  linkages  and  benefits  in  proximity  to  the  rural  road \nsubprojects. Supplementary infrastructure will be implemented using the LEP approach. \n \n68.  Maintenance. O&M of supplementary infrastructure varies with the capture of benefits. In a \ntypical WSS subproject, O&M costs will be borne fully by the users committee with an O&M fund \nestablished with up-front community contributions and a water tariff to meet regular O&M costs of \nthe  scheme.  For  more  public  or  technically  complex  supplementary  infrastructure  (for  example, \nschool infrastructure or trail bridges), the VDCs will be responsible for maintenance, with technical \nand financial support from the DDC if required. \n \n\nc. \n\nCommunity Empowerment \n\n \n69. \nIn line with government policies toward inclusion, the Project will strengthen the capacities \nof  communities,  beneficiary  participation,  and  social  cohesion  to  integrate  the  poor  and \ndisadvantaged  into  the  mainstream  of  development  activities.  This  goal  will  be  achieved  through \n\n                                                 \n13  The Project\u2019s share of road maintenance cost will be 100% in the first year, 75% in the second, 50% in the third, and \n\n25% in the fourth. The DDCs will provide the remaining required funds on an increasing basis accordingly. \n\n14  SDC,  through  an  existing  presence  and  capacity  in  the  trail  bridge  subsector,  will  provide  technical  assistance  and \n\nmetal cables to support this initiative under RRRSDP. \n\n15  Unlike the other supplementary infrastructure, WSS schemes are not tied to the proximity of the rural roads. A typical \nscheme  will  consist  of  an  intake  structure  at  an  existing  natural  water  source  (such  as  a  spring  or  a  stream),  a \ntransmission pipeline, and a distribution network, with each supply point serving a group of 5 to 10 rural households. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\ninfrastructure.  The  Project  will \n\nactivities  that  (i)  raise  awareness  of  the  Project  and  opportunities  (employment,  training,  and \naccess to subprojects) among all social groups; (ii) organize and train the RBGs for construction, \nusing  and  building  on  existing  socially  mobilized  groups;  (iii)  assist  communities  in  identifying \nsupplementary  infrastructure  and  preparing  proposals;  (iv)  facilitate  beneficiary  participation, \nparticularly  of  the  poorest  of  the  poor,  in  implementing  and  maintaining  subprojects  through  pro-\npoor delivery mechanisms including public hearings and social auditing; and (v) ensure capacity in \nmaintenance  of  supplementary \nthe \ndisadvantaged for proportional representation in the RBGs, and promote female membership of at \nleast 50% and women as RBG leaders. \n \n70. \nIn  addition  to  rural  infrastructure  activities,  the  Project  will  support  demand-driven  skills \ntraining  by  the  social  development  officer  and  social  mobilizers/facilitators  in  the  DIST  who  will \nidentify the group-specific training needs first. The training will cover areas such as agriculture and \nlivestock, forestry and soil conservation, microenterprise and skills development, and social (health \nand  literacy)  awareness  and  legal  rights.  The  Project  will  seek  to  link  communities  to  qualified \ngovernment  and  nongovernment  training  entities,  closely  coordinate  with  ongoing  social  and \ncommunity development initiatives, and facilitate the communities in linking with credit, extension, \nand  related  service  providers.16  These  skills  and  services  will  enhance  the  ability  of  the  rural \npopulation to promote their well-being after the termination of employment associated with the rural \ninfrastructure construction. \n \n\ntarget  minorities  and \n\nd. \n\nInstitutional Capacity Development  \n\nto  enhance  existing \n\n \n71. \nTo  support  the  urgent  need  for  infrastructure  investment  in  rural  communities,  the \nGovernment asked ADB to design a fast-disbursing project. However, assessment of central and \nDDC  capacity,  as  well  as  experience  with  other  rural  infrastructure  projects,  has  shown  that \ninstitutional  capacity  needs  strengthening.  Therefore, \ntechnical  and \nadministrative  capabilities  at  MLD,  DOLIDAR,  and  in  the  districts,  this  component  specifically \ntargets building institutional capacities. A close linkage would be made with ongoing projects such \nas  the  Decentralized  Local  Governance  Support  Program  financed  by  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme and Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation. \n \nStrengthening Implementation and O&M. The Project will support the implementation of \n72. \nthe  Institutional  Strengthening  Action  Plan,  which  is  a  long-term  road  map  (supported  by  the \ndonors  working  in  rural  infrastructure)  for  building  capacity  in  MLD,  DOLIDAR,  and  the  DDCs. \nDRILP  and  other  relevant  manuals  and  procedures  will  be  updated  where  necessary  and \ndisseminated to the 20 new districts. As quality control and O&M are keys to maximizing the life of \nrural  infrastructure  investments,  laboratory  testing  equipment  will  be  provided  to  districts,  and \ndistrict  staff  will  be  trained  on  the  use  and  application  of  laboratory  testing  for  rural  roads.  Local \nworkshops will be provided for the districts on strengthening O&M procedures and programs. \n \n73. \nEnhancing  Fiduciary  Management  and  Social  Safeguard  Compliance.  Requirements \nfor  procurement,  resettlement,  and  environment  have  a  major  impact  on  the  timing  of  project \nimplementation.  Lessons  from  other  rural  infrastructure  projects  indicate  that  up-front  capacity \nbuilding  in  these  specific  areas  significantly  improves  project  implementation  efficiency  and \neffectiveness.  This  training  is  particularly  needed  in  the  20  non-DRILP  districts.  Therefore,  this \ncomponent  will  (i)  update  DRILP  procedure  manuals  for  procurement,  resettlement,  and \nenvironment in both English and Nepali; (ii) develop and deliver a related training program through \n\n                                                 \n16  An example is linking with the ADB-assisted Skills for Employment Project in districts with a common project presence. \nADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loan to the Kingdom \nof Nepal for the Skills for Employment Project. Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\ncentral  and  regional  workshops;  and  (iii)  provide  individual  support  in  these  areas  to  districts  as \nnecessary. \n \nThe draft Review of Financial Management and Accountability at the Local Level17 shows \n74. \nthat public financial management in the sector is unreliable and requires substantial improvement. \nThe  most  critical  gap  is  a  lack  of  consistent  accounting  policies  and  procedures  across  districts. \nWhile  LBFAR  establishes  regulations,  a  manual  detailing  actual  accounting  procedures  including \neffective  internal  controls  does  not  exist.  To  address  this,  this  component  will  provide  financial \nmanagement support to develop an accounting manual, in both English and Nepali, and to develop \nand deliver a related training program in conjunction with procurement matters. \n \n75. \nDonor Harmonization. Given the high number of donors and projects in the sector and the \nlimited  resources  of  the  Government,  the  development  of  an  integrated  framework  to  harmonize \ndonor  aid  and  related  funding  procedures  and  to  move  the  sector  to  PBA  is  justified.  Under  the \nleadership  of  MLD,  significant  discussions  have  taken  place  on  PBA  with  key  donors  including \nADB,  DFID,  SDC,  and  World  Bank.  However,  the  development  and  implementation  of  PBA \nrequires several steps that can take a substantial amount of time (Appendix 7). To take advantage \nof  the  current  donor  momentum  behind  this  initiative,  this  component  will  provide  consulting \nservices  to  the  Government  to  develop  the  framework  and  interim  measures  to coordinate  donor \nprojects. \n \n\ne. \n\nProject Management Services \n\n \n76. \nA project coordination unit (PCU) has been established in DOLIDAR, but still needs to be \nfully  staffed.18  A  district  project  office  (DPO)19  will  be  established  in  each  of  the  20  core  project \ndistricts.  The  Project  will  work  with  the  existing  DPOs  in  the  18  DRILP  districts  and  supplement \neach DRILP DPO with one water supply engineer, a subengineer, and an assistant subengineer to \nimplement rural WSS initiatives. The PCU, assisted by central implementation support consultants \n(Appendix  8),  will  provide  coordination  and  guidance  for  all  facets  of  project  implementation, \nincluding engineering, safeguards (environment, social, and resettlement), financial management, \nand  procurement.  The  DPOs,  assisted  by  the  DISTs  (Appendix  9),20  will  (i)  prepare  annual  work \nprograms;  (ii)  finalize  detailed  subproject  designs;  (iii)  ensure  compliance  with  all  safeguard \nmeasures;  (iv)  supervise  all  construction  activities  and  ensure  quality;  (v)  organize  community \ntraining;  and  (vi)  arrange  procurement.  The  PCU  and  DPOs  will  be  supplied  with  computers, \nequipment,  and  vehicles  to  support  project  supervision,  management,  technology,  and  quality \ncontrol. \n \n\n3. \n\nImportant Features \n\nIn  an  effort  to  address  the  complexities  of  poverty  and  conflict,  the  Project  takes  a \n77. \ntraining,  and \nmultidimensional  approach, \ncapacity building. The main complement of project works on rural roads is to be accomplished by \nemploying  local  RBGs,  which  are  to  be  constituted  by  targeting  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  for \ninclusion.  The  supplementary  investments  are  identified  and  undertaken  in  a  demand-driven \nprocess approach. Again, the poor and disadvantaged are targeted for this activity. These groups \n\ninfrastructure,  community  development, \n\nincluding \n\n                                                 \n17  World Bank. September 2006. \n18  The  PCU  will  have  one  project  coordinator,  two  senior  divisional  engineers,  five  engineers,  one  sociologist,  one \nenvironmental  engineer,  one  senior  resettlement  officer,  one  senior  accountant,  two  accountants,  one  computer \noperator, one assistant, two administrative assistants, four drivers, and three messengers. \n\n19  Headed  by  the  DTO  chief,  the  DPO  will  have  one  rural  infrastructure  engineer,  one  subengineer,  two  assistant \n\nsubengineers, one accountant, one administrative staff, one computer operator, one driver, and two messengers. \n20  DIST includes engineering, safeguard, and social mobilization staff, of which a minimum of 33% should be women. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nwill  be  provided  training  to  extend  their  skills  and  knowledge  base  to  assist  employment  and \nincome generation after road construction is completed.  \n \n78. \nThe  Project  adopts  the  LEP  approach,  which  has  strengths  in  providing  income-  and \nemployment-generation  for  the  poor,  minimizing  environmental  impact  of  machine-intensive  road \nconstruction,  and  generating  skills  and  ownership  for  O&M  (by  employing  the  local  population). \nHowever, to be effective, the approach does not lend itself to shortcuts. Significant RBG training, \npreparation,  and  supervision  are  required.  To  reconcile  the  time  required  for  organizing,  training, \nand implementing under the LEP with the Government's articulated desire for rapid employment- \nand income-generating works, the project design seeks to speed preparatory activities by utilizing \nadvance  action  for  consultant  recruitment.  This  will  help  put  expertise  in  place  early  after  project \neffectiveness  to  assist  and  guide  local  bodies  in  critical  start-up  areas  such  as  (i)  DIST \nprocurement; (ii) financial management (in relation to managing a multilateral-funded project); and \n(iii)  guidance  in  the  requirements  and  standards  for  environment,  resettlement,  and  social \nsafeguards. Additionally, in an effort to expedite implementation, the Project will adopt and extend \nalready compiled and applied procedural guidelines and manuals developed under the DRILP. \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n79. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $78.4 million, including taxes and duties of $4.0 \nmillion.

The provision of grant assistance is justified by the \npro-poor  orientation  of  the  Project  and  the  country\u2019s  tight  fiscal  position.  The  Government  is  to \nprovide $15,700,000 equivalent to finance part of the civil works (17% of rural roads and 32% of \nsupplementary  infrastructure),  20%  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  compensation,  50%  of \nrural road O&M, and 100% of project staff salary and taxes and duties.

MLD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project;  DOLIDAR  will  be  the  central \nImplementing Agency. A project coordinator at class one will head the PCU and report to the MLD \nsecretary  through  the  DOLIDAR  director  general.  In  the  districts,  the  DDCs  will  be  implementing \nagencies  responsible  for  local  development  and  coordination,  with  the  respective  DTOs \nresponsible for technical and project management activities. \n \nA  project  monitoring  committee22  in  MLD  chaired  by  the  MLD  joint  secretary  will  \n83. \n(i)  monitor  overall  project  implementation,  (ii)  resolve  policy  issues,  (iii)  guide  the  PCU,  and  \n(iv) facilitate interministerial coordination.23 It will meet at least once every 6 months. DOLIDAR will \nestablish  a  project  implementation  coordination  committee24  to  (i)  supervise  day-to-day  project \nimplementation, (ii) review project progress, and (iii) coordinate between DOLIDAR and the DDCs. \nIt will meet at least every 4 months. The DDCs will coordinate all district project activities. A district \nproject coordination committee chaired by the DDC chairperson will be established to (i) coordinate \nwith  all  relevant  line  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  civil  society;  (ii)  issue  district \npolicy  guidelines;  (iii)  resolve  district  implementation  issues;  and  (iv)  hear  complaints  about  the \nProject. \n \n\n                                                 \n21 DFID has expressed interest to provide a grant of $20 million equivalent to jointly finance rural road civil works, subject \nto its final approval. SDC also expressed interest to provide the district technical services in four districts of Dolakha, \nKabhrepalanchok, Sindhuli, and Sindhupalchowk. The project scope will be extended and the project investment and \nfinancing plans will be adjusted when the proposed DFID and SDC cofinancing materializes. \n\n22  The project monitoring committee will also include the director general of DOLIDAR, project coordinator, heads of MLD \nFinancial  Administration  Section,  Planning  and  Foreign  Aid  Coordination  Section,  and  Monitoring  Section,  and \nrepresentatives from MOF and NPC. \n\n23  The  existing  joint  steering  committee  for  rural  infrastructure  chaired  by  the  MLD  secretary  will  provide  overall  policy \n\ndirection for the sector. \n\n24  The  project  implementation  coordination  committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  director  general  of  DOLIDAR,  and  include \nthree  representatives  of  MLD  (Financial  Administration  Section,  Monitoring  Section,  and  Planning  and  Foreign  Aid \nCoordination Section), and five representatives from project districts on a rotating basis. ADB and other cofinanciers \nmay participate as observers. The PCU will be the secretariat for the PICC; the project coordinator will be the member \nsecretary. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\n84. \nVillage infrastructure construction coordination committees (VICCCs)  will be constituted in \neach  VDC  area.25  In  liaison  with  the  DPOs,  the  VICCCs  will  facilitate  formation  of  the  RBGs  for \nrural  roads,  and  village  infrastructure  user  groups  (VIUGs)  for  supplementary  infrastructure.  The \nVICCCs will (i) coordinate supplementary infrastructure planning, (ii) ensure proper payment to the \nRBGs,  (iii)  supervise  beneficiary  contributions  to  supplementary  infrastructure,  (iv)  monitor \nimplementation of works, and (v) ensure public audits. \n \n\nb. \n\nSubproject Selection \n\nSubprojects  for  rural  roads  have  largely  been  short-listed  through  district  participatory \n85. \nprocesses  prior  to  the  start  of  the  Project  (Appendix  11  provides  the  selection  criteria). \nSupplementary  infrastructure  will  be  selected  through  a  process  approach  involving  communities \nand villages.  \n \n86. \nFor  final  selection  of  road  subprojects,  an  assessment  will  be  undertaken  for  short-listed \nsubprojects  to  cover  social,  technical,  economic,  environment,  and  resettlement  aspects;  and  to \nscore and qualify proposed subprojects. Feasibility studies and detailed design will be undertaken \nby  the  DIST  for  the  highest-ranked  subprojects.  Preparations  will  cover  the  detailed  technical \ndesign;  drawings;  quantity  and  cost  estimates;  and  environment,  resettlement,  and  social \nrequirements  and  plans.  Public  consultations  will  be  undertaken  to  provide  information  and \nincorporate  stakeholder  views.  During  the  process,  disputes  in  finalizing  the  subproject  will  be \nresolved  in  discussion  with  the  local  community  and  VICCC.  Civil  works  for  rural  roads  will \ncommence after completion of feasibility studies and detailed designs, receipt of environment and \nsocial  safeguard  clearances,  and  completion  of  resettlement  activities  and  compensation \npayments. \n \n87. \nSupplementary  infrastructure  preparations  will  proceed  along  with  the  commencement  of \nthe rural roads. The DPO, with VICCC support, will inform and guide communities and villages in (i) \nidentification, (ii) consultation and prioritization, and (iii) proposal preparation. Village proposals will \nbe forwarded to the DPOs for evaluation and assessment, and then on to the DDC for approval. \n \n\nc. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  4  years  starting  from  January  2008  to  December \n\n88. \n2011. A project implementation schedule is in Appendix 12. \n \n\nd. \n\nProcurement \n\n89. \nAll  goods,  related  services,  and  civil  works  financed  by  ADB  and  cofinanciers  will  be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nAll small and widely dispersed civil works of up to $30,000 will be undertaken by the community, \nfollowing  the  community  participation  guide.  Shopping  will  be  used  for  works  exceeding  $30,000 \nbut no more than $100,000. In cases involving more complex works such as bridge construction, \nhigh  retaining  walls,  and  hard  rock  cutting  valued  at  more  than  $100,000  but  no  more  than \n$1,000,000, civil work contracts will be required and procured by the DPOs on the basis of national \ncompetitive  bidding  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB.26 Supply \n\n                                                 \n25  A  VICCC  will  include  the  representatives  of  political  parties,  nongovernment  organizations  active  in  the  VDC  area, \nwomen, dalits, and disadvantaged groups; VICCC members will be selected from a beneficiary meeting. Participation \nof at least 33% women and due representation of various ethnic groups and castes will be ensured. \n\n26  Nepal\u2019s  Financial  Administration  Rules,  1999,  were  reviewed  and  agreements  reached  between  ADB  and  the \n\nGovernment on the modifications that need to be made to bring them in line with ADB requirements. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\ncontracts for equipment or materials exceeding $1.0 million will be procured following international \ncompetitive bidding, and those not exceeding $1.0 million but more than $100,000 will be awarded \non the basis of national competitive bidding. Shopping will be used for procuring readily available \noff-the-shelf goods valued at up to $100,000. A procurement plan is in Appendix 13. \n \n\ne. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n90. \nThe selection and engagement of all consulting services will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  national consultants.  At  the  outset of  the  Project, \nthe  PCU  will  recruit  five  individual  consultants  to  advance  central  and  district  project  preparatory \nactivities including (i) 114 person-months of national consulting services in procurement, financial \nmanagement, \n(ii)  9  person-months \ninternational  consulting  services  on  development  of  a  joint  donor  coordination  framework.  The \nother central implementation support consultants, comprising 42 person-months international and \n350  person-months  national  will  be  recruited  by  the  PCU  through  a  firm  using  quality-  and  cost-\nbased selection with quality-cost ratio of 80:20. The Government will undertake advance action for \nrecruiting  consultants  to  facilitate  the  Project\u2019s  start-up.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that \napproval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n\nresettlement,  and  environmental  management;  and \n\nf. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n91. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent, \ncollusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions \nof ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations and the bidding documents for \nthe  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include \nprovisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  MLD; \nDOLIDAR;  DDCs; and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they \nrelate to the Project. \n \nSpecific  measures  are  incorporated  to  enhance  governance  and  prevent  corruption.  The \n92. \nProject  will  use  participatory,  open,  and  consultative  processes  in  decision  making  and  resource \nallocation.  Procurement  and  community \nfinancial  management  manuals  and  step-by-step \nprocedures  will  be  compiled  in  the  local  language  and  delivered  to  DOLIDAR,  DDCs,  and  VDCs \nwith  training.  For  each  subproject,  public  hearings  will  be  held  and  public  auditing  conducted  to \nincrease  social  accountability  and  transparency,  and  deter  fund  misuse.  Established  procedures, \nstrengthened fiduciary arrangements, and close supervision of resources provided will help lower \nthe risk of fund loss and ensure better accountability.  \n \n\ng. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n93. \nTo  ensure  effective  project  implementation  and  timely  disbursement,  immediately  after \ngrant  effectiveness  the  Government  will  establish  two  separate  imprest  accounts  for  the  (i)  ADB \ngrant;  and  (ii)  OFID  loan,  each  at  Nepal  Rastra  Bank.  Project  funding  (other  than  beneficiary \ncontributions)  comprising  government  counterpart  funds  and  ADB  and  OFID  funds  will  be \nchanneled to the following accounts: (i) the central PCU project operating account, or (ii) the DPO \nproject operating accounts established in each district. \n \n94. \nThe  PCU  will  work  with  project  districts  to  prepare  budgetary  allocations,  and  the \nGovernment will advance funds to the PCU project operating account and DPO project operating \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\naccounts  accordingly.  The  PCU  will  also  work  with  the  project  districts  to  prepare  disbursement \nprojections, collect supporting documents, and prepare withdrawal applications; and send them to \nADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).  Based  on  the  withdrawal  applications,  ADB  and  cofinanciers  will  fund  the  project  imprest \naccounts on a reimbursement basis. \n \n95. \nThe statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure will be adopted to facilitate reimbursement \nand liquidation. The imprest accounts and the SOE procedure will be established, maintained, and \naudited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  The  ceiling  of  each  imprest \naccount  will  not  exceed  the  estimated  corresponding  donor-financed  expenditures  for  the  next  6 \nmonths,  or  10%  of  the  fund  amount  of  the  corresponding  donor,  whichever  is  lower.  The  SOE \nprocedure  is  applicable  for  reimbursing  eligible  expenditures  or  any  individual  payment  not \nexceeding $100,000 and liquidating advances provided in the imprest accounts. \n \n\nh. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n96. \nDOLIDAR will submit trimester and annual project progress reports to ADB. The PCU will \nprepare  the  reports,  particularly  addressing  progress  in  meeting  project  targets.  The  reports  will \ninclude information on the Project\u2019s physical progress and component status. Within 3 months of \nthe  Project\u2019s  substantial  physical  completion,  DOLIDAR  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion \nreport  covering  project  implementation,  cost,  project  performance  management  activities,  and \nother  information  requested  by  ADB.  DOLIDAR  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and \nrecords  to  facilitate  identification  of  project-related  income  and  expenditures.  The  PCU  will  be \nassigned  sufficient  and  qualified  accounting  staff,  including  a  senior  accountant.  An  independent \nauditor  acceptable  to  ADB  will  annually  audit  all  project-related  accounts,  SOEs,  and  revenues. \nThe  annual  audit  report  will  include  a  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  accounts \nand SOE procedure. Audited financial statements and project accounts, together with the report of \nthe auditor, will be submitted within 9 months of the close of the financial year. \n \n\ni. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring System \n\n97. \nIn  line  with  ADB\u2019s  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)  framework,  a \nparticipatory  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  program  will  be  carried  out,  and  be  specifically \ndesigned to support the data requirements (segregated by gender and ethnicity) of a results-based \nmanagement  system.  Specifically,  objective  indicators  and  targets  for  all  desired  project  outputs, \noutcomes, and impacts will be defined for annual and/or episodic points in the project cycle. These \nindicators will permit regular and timely assessments of the Project\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness. \nIn  this  context,  \u201cefficiency\u201d  means  the  production  of  planned  outputs  with  the  allocated  inputs \n(resources).  \u201cEffectiveness\u201d  means  the  achievement  of  project  outcomes  and  impacts  as  a \nconsequence  of  fully  implementing  all  planned  interventions.  PPMS  activities  will  be  conducted \nperiodically to assess whether project inputs have delivered the expected benefits to the intended \nbeneficiaries. The PPMS will also detect deviations between the plan and execution of the Project. \nThe  use  of  a  results-based  management  approach  will  ensure  that  deviations  between  the  plan \nand achieved results (outputs, outcomes, and impacts) will be recognized by project management \nin  a  timely  manner,  thereby  allowing  corrective  management  actions  and  decisions  to  be  taken. \nThe  PCU  will  conduct  a  benchmark  physical  and  socioeconomic  survey  at  selected  project \ndistricts,  and  submit  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and  concurrence  a  detailed  implementation  plan  for \nmonitoring  performance  and  preparing  benchmark  information  within  9  months  of  grant \neffectiveness.  These  baseline  surveys  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  design  and \nmonitoring  framework  and  provide  the  basis  for  preparing  the  benchmark  information  and  target \nvalues.  Baseline  data  will  include  income  and  expenditure  data,  livelihoods  data,  demographic \ntrends, gender issues, and data on ethnic and minority groups. After the initial survey, the PCU will \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n \n\nreports \n\nto  ADB  and  cofinanciers \n\nsubmit  annual  benefit  monitoring \nimplementation. \n \n98. \nIn  support  of  the  midterm  and  project  completion  review  missions,  independent  impact \nevaluation surveys and studies will be accomplished and the reports will be transmitted to ADB and \ncofinanciers  at  a  minimum  of  4  weeks  before  the  respective  missions.  The  surveys  should \ncomplement  the  benchmark  data  and  measure  the  degree  to  which  the  Project  has  attained \noutputs,  outcomes,  and  impacts;  closely  reflecting  the  indicators  of  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework. \n \n\nthroughout  project \n\nj. \n\nProject Review \n\n99. \nADB,  cofinanciers,  and  the  Government  will  review  the  Project  at  least  twice  a  year;  this \nincludes  the  performance  of  DOLIDAR,  PCU,  DPOs,  consultants,  and  contractors;  physical \nprogress  of  project  implementation;  inclusion  of  the  poor,  marginalized  groups,  and  women  in \nproject  implementation;  compliance  with  grant  assurances;  and  continued  feasibility  of  project \nimplementation  in  each  project  district,  taking  into  account  the  political  context  and  security \nsituation. ADB, cofinanciers, and the Government will undertake a comprehensive midterm review \nof the Project at the beginning of the third year to identify problems and constraints encountered \nand  suggest  measures  to  address  them.  Specific  items  to  be  reviewed  include  (i)  PCU \neffectiveness;  (ii)  compliance  with  safeguard  measures;  (iii)  implementation  of  the  gender  action \nplan;  (iv)  extent  to  which  district  road  maintenance  funds  have  been  established  and  their \neffectiveness; (v) effectiveness of capacity building; (vi) extent to which inclusiveness objectives of \nthe Project are being met; (vii) extent to which project agreements and RBG contracts have been \nimplemented  and  complied  with;  (viii)  lessons  learned,  good  practices  and  innovations,  and  their \nreplicability; and (ix) any other issue agreed upon by the PCU and ADB. Technical, budgetary, and \ndesign modifications could be considered based on the results of the review, including supporting \nthe 18 DRILP districts for rural roads based on the utilization of DRILP and RRRSDP funds. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n100.  Economic. The direct benefits of rural roads are increased access, time savings, and lower \nperson-trip  and  cargo-transport  costs.  In  overcoming  isolation,  the  rural  roads  will  gradually \nstimulate  the  agricultural  economy  by  (i)  improving  farm  management  practices  and  yields;  (ii) \nstimulating  cultivation  of  market-oriented,  high-value  crops;  and  (iii)  increasing  household  farm \nincome  and  employment.  The  WSS  subprojects  will  provide  rural  households  with  better  access \nand  less  drudgery  (time  savings  for  fetching  water),  and  better  quality  water  and  sanitation \n(reduction  in  household  health  costs  and  lost  work  days).  Supplementary  infrastructure  will \nincrease  access  to  services  and  improve  income  and  life  quality.  Training  will  enhance  rural \nlivelihood skills and community empowerment. The Project will generate employment and income \nthrough  the  labor-intensive  infrastructure  works  during  implementation;  and  afterward,  through \nincreased  agricultural  activity,  development  of  roadside-related  businesses,  and  O&M  of  the  new \ninfrastructure. The project justification and economic analysis are in Appendix 14. \n \n101.  Poverty Reduction. Poverty issues will be directly addressed by the policy actions through \nthe positive impact that they will have on service delivery to the poor and socially excluded groups, \nand  their  increased  participation.  The  use  of  more  robust  and  transparent  poverty  prioritization \ncriteria  will  minimize  the  use  of  fiscal  transfers  for  political  patronage.  Growth  prospects  will  be \nimproved because of the introduction of measures to enhance efficiency and transparency. These \nmeasures have the potential to stimulate private sector productivity and investment. Broad-based \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\ngrowth will be promoted; the increase is expected to reduce the incidence of poverty and exclusion \nthrough employment promotion.  \n \n102.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  15.  The  incidence  of \npoverty is high in rural areas where as much as 95% of Nepal's poor reside. Poverty rates in the \ncountry's  five  regions  range  from  as  high  as  47%  (Midwestern  region)  to  29%  (Western  region), \nwith  an  overall  average  of  34.6%.27  These  high  rates  are  strongly  related  to  poor  crop  yields, \nstagnant growth in agricultural income, and isolation. Linking the rural population with markets and \ntechnology, the investment Project will directly benefit an estimated 2.6 million people. In terms of \ndirect  employment,  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  will  generate  more  than  15.8  million  person-\ndays of labor, or 4 years of full-time work for 13,200 rural poor. Employment opportunities for the \npoor  will  be  enhanced  over  the  long  term  with  improved  agriculture,  nonfarm  labor  opportunities, \nand rural enterprise development. The targeted supplementary investments and livelihood training \nprograms  will  ensure  greater  income  opportunities  for  disadvantaged  segments  of  the  rural \npopulation, including women, dalits, and marginalized communities. \n \n103.  Social.  By  making  inclusion  a  key  part  of  the  overall  policy  reform  process,  RRRSDP \neffectively  links  economic  and  social  inclusion  awareness  in  policy  and  programs  to  equitable, \nefficient, and sustainable outcomes. The policy reforms will impact the targeting of fiscal resources. \nThey  will  contribute  to  political  and  economic  inclusion,  and  to  reform  of  political  institutions  and \nbureaucracy for improved service delivery and public accountability. This will have positive impacts \non poverty reduction and good governance. Affirmative action will increase the options of excluded \nethnic groups, castes, and women to participate in state administration, and actively increase their \ncontrol and command over resources. \n \n104.  The  investment  Project  will  promote  economic  and  social  inclusion  by  proportional \nrepresentation  of  historically  marginalized/disadvantaged  populations  in  all  aspects  of  project \nplanning,  implementation,  monitoring,  and  maintenance,  particularly  in  employment  and  income \ngeneration  activities.  The  VICCCs,  RBGs,  and  village  infrastructure  user  groups  will  have \nproportional  representation  of  local  caste  and  ethnic  groups  in  the  project  influence  zone  to  \n(i) ensure participation of the poor and vulnerable groups in decision making, (ii) raise their social \ncapital  and  access  to  other  development  opportunities,  and  (iii)  increase  the  use  of  health  and \neducation  facilities  in  local  areas  by  such  groups.  Communities\u2019  access  to  public  services  and \nlivelihood opportunities, including self-employment, will be greatly enhanced. \n \n105. \nInstitutional.  RRRSDP  will  contribute  to  greater  accountability  and  efficiency  through  a \nstrengthened  and  harmonized  policy  and  regulatory  framework.  A  more  transparent  system  of \nfiscal  transfers  will  lead  to  fewer  regional  disparities  and  improve  government  budgeting  and \nfinancial management practices. Decentralized decision making will bring local bodies closer to the \npeople, overcome information asymmetries, improve the quality and quantity of rural infrastructure \nservices  by  allowing  for  a  better  matching  of  local  needs  and  preferences,  and  enhance \ntransparency. \n \n106.  The financial management system to be adopted for RRRSDP will be based on the revised \nLBFAR,  which  addresses  the  expenditure  authorization  of  local  bodies.  This  includes  increasing \nthe  approving  authority  threshold  of  local  development  officers,  and  providing  the  DTOs  with  the \nauthority to approve contracts; this is expected to significantly speed implementation and improve \nservice  delivery.  RRRSDP  will  improve  and  strengthen  organizational  capabilities  for  developing \nand managing rural infrastructure; and contribute to building sustainable intergovernment relations, \n\n                                                 \n27  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics.  National  Planning  Commission  Secretariat.  2004.  Nepal  Living  Standards  Survey, \n\n2003/04. Kathmandu. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n \n\nin particular for coordination of policies and programs, and cooperation with local bodies in service \ndelivery.  It  will  build  institutional  capacity  to  streamline  the  existing  government  mechanism  for \noversight,  and  the  management  of  central  and  local  financial  information.  Improved  flows  of \nfinancial information from local bodies will assist in improving institutional capacity for determining \nresource transfers and accountability, leading to increased effectiveness of public institutions vis-\u00e0-\nvis improvements in inclusive service delivery. \n \n107. \nInvoluntary Resettlement. The Project focuses on rural infrastructure that provides direct \nbenefits to communities, including improved access to markets and services such as schools and \nhealth  posts.  Improved  roads  are  expected  to  lead  to  higher  land  values  and  productivity.  While \nsuch  benefits  are  cited  as  reasons  for  Nepal\u2019s  tradition  of  land  donation,  the  Project  will  actively \nseek to minimize land donation by incorporating adequate safeguards in the resettlement plan. As \na first principle, people affected by the Project will be informed of their right to compensation. No \none  will  be  forced  to  donate  their  land  and  those  affected  will  have  the  right  to  refuse  land \ndonation.  In  cases  where  the  people  affected  are  directly  linked  to  project  benefits  and  thus  are \nreally  willing  to  donate  part  of  their  land  after  they  are  fully  informed  about  their  entitlement,  the \nProject will assess their socioeconomic status and only those who do not fall below the poverty line \nafter  land  donation  will  be  eligible  for  such  donation.  Any  donation  will  be  confirmed  through  a \nwritten record, including a \"no coercion\" clause verified by a third party. District grievance redress \ncommittees will be set up to redress grievances of people affected by the Project. \n \n108.  Based on a typical cross-section, a 10 meter-wide right-of-way is envisaged for most project \nroads. Involuntary resettlement will be avoided or minimized through careful planning and design of \nthe  project  roads.  People  affected  will  be  offered  compensation  at  replacement  cost  and/or \nassistance  so  that  they  will  be  at  least  as  well-off  as  without  the  Project.  Affected  people  will  be \nfully informed and consulted during project design and implementation. Lack of land title will not be \na  bar  to  compensation,  and  particular  attention  will  be  paid  to  vulnerable  groups.  Land \ncompensation will be completed before commencement of civil works, while rehabilitation activities \nwill  continue  during  project  construction.  Supplementary  activities  are  not  expected  to  involve \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  as  their  selection  criteria  exclude  subprojects  that  require  additional \nprivate land. \n \n109.  ADB will finance 80% of land acquisition, involuntary resettlement, and compensation costs. \nThe  DPOs  will  maintain  and  update  a  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  record \nthroughout  project  implementation.  The  record  will \ninclude  details  on  the  payment  of \ncompensation for land, structures, and assistance; and other related payments for each affected \nperson (both titleholder and nontitled) including the date of payment and check number. \n \n110.  A  resettlement  framework  provides  policy  and  procedures  to  screen,  assess,  and  plan \ninvoluntary  resettlement  aspects  of  subprojects  in  full  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  (1995).  The  framework  was  publicly  disclosed  and  posted  on  the  ADB \nwebsite.  All  subprojects  will  be  screened  early  in  the  project  cycle.  If  a  subproject  involves  any \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts, an appropriate resettlement plan will be prepared based on the \ndetailed  design,  disclosed  to  those  affected,  and  submitted  for  ADB  approval  in  accordance  with \nthe resettlement framework. \n \n111.  Based  on  the  feasibility  study,  social  impact  assessments  were  conducted  for  three  core \nroad  subprojects  for  which  resettlement  plans  were  prepared.  The  plans  will  serve  as  sample \ndocuments  for  the  future  development  of  subprojects.  They  were  publicly  disclosed  to  those \naffected  and  local  stakeholders,  and  posted  on  the  ADB  website.  Upon  completion  of  detailed \ndesigns, the plans will be updated and approved by ADB prior to award of civil works contracts. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\n112.  DOLIDAR  will  assign  a  resettlement  officer  in  the  PCU,  and  recruit  one  resettlement \nspecialist and three resettlement assistants under the central implementation support consultants \nto help with overall coordination, planning, and monitoring of involuntary resettlement aspects. The \nPCU will provide necessary training and support to the DPOs on social assessment, resettlement \nplanning, implementation, and monitoring. The PCU will supervise and monitor DPOs\u2019 functions in \norder to maintain the quality and consistency of their work/outputs. MLD and DOLIDAR will ensure \ntimely availability of budget for land compensation and resettlement activities. DOLIDAR will submit \nsemiannual progress reports to ADB regarding implementation of the resettlement plans. \n \n113.  For subprojects in the districts, the DPOs will screen, categorize, assess, plan, and monitor \nfor any involuntary resettlement impacts in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \nand  the  Project\u2019s  resettlement  framework.  A  social  development  specialist,  a  resettlement \nspecialist, and social mobilizers/facilitators will be engaged in each district under the DIST to help \nthe DPOs with social and land surveys, social assessment, resettlement planning, and monitoring. \n \n114.  An external monitoring agency will be engaged to conduct annual monitoring of involuntary \nresettlement  implementation.  The  PCU  will  hire  the  monitoring  agency  with  ADB  concurrence \nwithin  12  months  after  grant  effectiveness.  The  appointed  agency  will  provide  annual  reports  to \nADB, MLD, and DOLIDAR. \n \n115.  Environment.  Initial  environmental  examinations  carried  out  for  the  core  subprojects \ndemonstrate that the investment Project is not likely to cause any significant environmental impacts \nsince several safeguards are incorporated in the project design. At the selection stage, subprojects \nto be excluded are those that (i) exceed thresholds warranting environmental impact assessments, \nor  (ii)  are  in  designated  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  RRRSDP  will  provide  technical  and \nfinancial  support  to  ensure  that  initial  environmental  examinations  are  conducted  and  mitigation \nmeasures  are  implemented  to  meet  the  Government  standards  and  ADB\u2019s  environment  policies. \nMost  subprojects  will  be  designed  and  implemented  using  the  LEP  approach,  which  minimizes \nconstruction  impact  on  the  environment.  Project  activities  will  be  independently  monitored  to \nensure  compliance  with  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures.  In  addition, \npostproject environmental monitoring will be carried out and funded under the Project as part of an \neffective environmental safeguard mechanism. \n \nB. \n\nRisks \n\n116.  Risks for the Program grant include (i) political instability, including frequent changes in the \nGovernment; and (ii) weak commitment to implementing new legislation and regulation. Although \nthe  political  transition  could  get  stalled,  engaging  and  supporting  the  Government  in  its \nreconstruction,  rehabilitation,  and  social  inclusion  endeavors  will  contribute  to  minimizing  the  first \nrisk.  Policy  actions  taken  since  November  2006  demonstrate  Government  commitment  to  (i) \nmaking institutions more representative and inclusive, (ii) strengthening the devolution process to \nimprove service delivery, and (iii) strengthening institutions for accountability and transparency.   \n \n117.  Risks for the project grant include (i) inability of the DDCs to raise sufficient funds for O&M, \n(ii) weak capacity in the districts to manage multilateral funded projects, and (iii) distrust and lack of \nsocial  cohesion  among  local  residents,  which  may  slow  implementation.  The  project  design \nprovides for matching funds to support establishment of district maintenance funds with targets at \ndifferent stages of implementation. Weak capacity in the districts will be mitigated through training \nprograms on maintenance designed for local bodies and user groups. The Project also provides for \nstrengthening  DOLIDAR\u2019s  ability  to  guide  and  monitor  maintenance  performance.  Many  districts \nare unfamiliar with the policies and procedures of multilateral donor-financed projects and this may \nslow implementation. To counter this, the Project provides for capacity-building training in project \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n \n\nprocedures  using  manuals  in  local  language  and  covering  procurement,  financial  management, \nenvironment,  and  resettlement.  The  PCU  and  central  implementation  support  consultants  will \nprovide  backstopping  to  districts  in  all  phases  of  implementation.  To  mitigate  the  risk  that  local \nresidents may not cooperate, the Project provides a strong community mobilization component and \nconflict mitigating measures by employing (i) a consultative and demand-driven approach, (ii) open \nand participatory monitoring mechanism (by using district and village committees and user groups), \nand (iii) institutionalizing public audits. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n118. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n\n1. \n\nThe Program Grant \n\n119.  Policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Grant Agreement, as described \nin the Development Policy Letter, will continue in effect for the duration of the program period and \nsubsequently. \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Project Grant \n\n120.  Assurances for the project grant include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nIf at any time during Project implementation, Nepal will undergo state restructuring \nresulting  in  changes  to  its  public  administration,  Nepal  will  immediately  inform  the \nADB thereof and the project management and implementation arrangements will be \nreviewed accordingly. \nThe approved annual budget allocations for the Project will be sufficient to cover all \nrequired  counterpart  funding,  including  for  resettlement-related  payments  and  for \nland surveys and cadastral mapping. \nMLD will strictly implement those provisions of the Civil Service Act, 2007, that deal \nwith the transfer of civil servants.  \n\n(iv)  Within  18  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  MLD  will  approve  a  national  strategy  for \nlocal  transport.  The  strategy  will  be  developed  after  close  consultation  with \nstakeholders  at  all  levels  and  will  include  a  plan  on  harmonization  of  technical, \nmanagerial, and administrative issues. \nDOLIDAR  will  ensure  that  there  will  be  no  geographical  overlap  between  ADB-\nfunded subprojects and projects funded by other development partners.  \nSelection  and  approval  of  all  subprojects,  whether  roads  or  supplementary \ninfrastructure,  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  agreed  criteria  and  in  close \nconsultation with the communities. \n\n(vi) \n\n(v) \n\nfunding \n\n(vii)  DOLIDAR and the DDCs in project districts will take all measures to increase rural \nthe \nroad  maintenance \nestablishment  of  district  road  maintenance  funds.  Before  30  April  of  each  year \nduring  project  implementation,  DOLIDAR  will  agree  with  ADB  on  the  annual \nmaintenance program for rural roads in the project area for the following year. By 31 \nMarch  of  every  year,  DOLIDAR  will  submit  to  ADB  the  proposed  maintenance \nbudget for its review. \n\nto  a  sustainable \n\nincluding \n\nthrough \n\nlevel, \n\n(viii)  DOLIDAR  will  ensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2003),  and \nrelevant  national  and  local  environmental  laws  and  regulations.  All  mitigation  and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n27\n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nmonitoring mechanisms set out in the initial environmental examinations as well as \nthe  entire  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  will  be  complied  with \nthroughout project implementation.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all  applicable \nlabor  laws.  Bidding  documents  will  include  a  clause  prohibiting  child  labor  for \nconstruction and maintenance activities, and a clause specifying equal pay for men \nand women for work of equal value.  \nLand donation will be done in strict compliance with the procedures set forth in the \nresettlement framework. \nNo  land  acquisition  will  be  required  for  subprojects  other  than  rural  roads.  Any \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  land  or  asset  acquisition  will  be  done  in  compliance \nwith the resettlement framework agreed to by MLD and ADB, and the resettlement \nplan  for  the  subproject.  The  DDCs  will  publicly  disclose  the  resettlement  plan  in \nplaces  and  using  language  accessible  to  all  affected  people.

The  Government\u2019s  Local  Infrastructure  Development  Policy  2004  defines  rural \ninfrastructure  as  infrastructure  that  can  be  planned,  implemented,  operated,  and  maintained  by  the  local \ngovernment  bodies  jointly  with  community  groups.  According  to  the  policy,  the  rural  infrastructure  sector \ncovers (i) rural transport (rural roads, bridges, and trails); (ii) rural water supply and sanitation; (iii) irrigation \nand river control; (iv) microhydropower; (v) housing and urban development; (vi) solid waste management; \nand (vii) social infrastructure. \n \nSector Performance. The findings of the second Nepal Living Standard Survey in 2004 showed that \n2. \npoverty  is concentrated  in  rural  areas due  to  inadequate  access,  illiteracy,  and  stagnant  agriculture.  Nepal \nneeds  30,000  kilometers  (km)  of  rural  roads  to  meet  the  relevant  Milennnium  Development  Goal  by  2015. \nThe country has about 22,000 km of rural roads at present. However, road standards vary significantly with \nless  than  half  motorable  and  of  these  only  about  60%  categorized  as  all-weather.  Investment  in  rural \ntransport needs to be substantially increased in the medium-term. \n \n3. \nRecent  statistics  show  that  77%  of  country\u2019s  total  population  has  access  to  reliable  water  supply. \nHowever, the proportion of the rural population currently accessing water supply is only about 65%. Access \nto reliable supplies of drinking water is a major concern in towns and rural areas in the hills and mountains. \nMany  completed  water  supply  schemes  are  in  disrepair  and  functioning  much  below  their design  capacity. \nThis indicates that the actual population served nationwide, and especially in rural areas, may be much lower \nthan official statistics indicate. \n \n4. \nOnly  about  70%  of  the  cultivated  land  is  irrigated,  of  which  only  40%  has  year-round  irrigation. \nAlmost all the agency-managed irrigation systems are delivering irrigation much below their design capacity \ndue to lack of proper operation and maintenance (O&M). The actual irrigated area, both seasonal and year-\nround, may be much lower than indicated by official statistics. The farmer-managed irrigation systems and \nprivate shallow tubewells function reasonably well due to beneficiary participation in construction and O&M. \nThis  suggests  the  need  for  strengthening  beneficiary  participation  in  identifying  and  implementing  water \nsupply and irrigation systems for sustainable O&M and secured service delivery.  \n \nSector Investment Plan. To revitalize the rural economy and reintegrate the conflict-affected rural \n5. \npopulation, the Government prepared the Rural Infrastructure Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Investment \nPlan  as  a  major  component  of  Three  Year  Interim  Plan.  The  interim  plan  places  highest  priority  on  rural \ntransport development estimating around 60% of investments to the subsector during its 3-year period. Rural \nwater supply and sanitation is the second priority with investments of around 15% followed by irrigation with \nabout 5%, while the other subsectors are alloted lower investment. The broad strategic elements envisaged \nfor  implementing  the  Rural  Infrastructure  Reconstruction  and  Rehabilitation  Investment  Plan  are  (i) \ncommunity-based undertakings, (ii) programs executed by the district development committees (DDCs), (iii) \nand  \nlinking \n(v) supplementary investment to promote income-generating opportunities. The investment plan will also be \na  component  of  the  strategic  action  plan  for  local  infrastructure  development  covering  FY2008  to  FY2015, \nwhich includes the TYIP and the next 5-year plan period. Both of these documents allocate 30% of resources \nfor construction of new rural infrastructure. \n \n6. \nInstitutional  Framework  for  Rural  Infrastructure  Development.  The  Department  of  Local \nInfrastructure Development and Agricultural Roads (DOLIDAR) is responsible for planning and implementing \nrural  infrastructure.  Due  to  the  prevailing  priority  given  to  rural  roads,  it  has  strengthened  its  comparative \nadvantage in rural roads followed by rural water supply. The establishment of DOLIDAR1 in September 1998 \nunder  the  Rural  Infrastructure  Development  National  Strategy  2054  (1998)  allowed  for  a  more  flexible \napproach  to  setting  standards  of  the  different  structures  under  consideration.  While  it  is  expected  to  cover \nother  infrastructure  as  well,  DOLIDAR  and  the  district  technical  offices2  mostly  centered  their  attention  on \nrural  road  construction,  and  rural  water  supply.  However,  DOLIDAR\u2018s  comparative  advantage  in \nmicroirrigation  and  microhydropower,  and  alternative  energy  schemes  have  yet  to  be  developed.  As  the \n                                                 \n1   The Rural Infrastructure Development National Strategy 2054 (1998) led to its establishment in September 1998. \n2   Formerly known as the district infrastructure development offices. \n\nproduction \n\nmarkets, \n\nbuilding, \n\ncapacity \n\nlocal \n\nwith \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n\f36 \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nsubsector policies are gradually identifying and giving away projects of a certain size to local bodies for their \nplanning,  implementation,  and  O&M,  DOLIDAR  needs  to  strengthen  its  capability  to  handle  these  aspects \nthrough the district technical offices.  \n \n7. \nAs  various  other  government  agencies  are  responsible  for  this  type  of  infrastructure,  a  clear \ndemarcation  of  local  and  nonlocal  dimensions  must  be  obtained  from  the  subsector-specific  policy \ndocuments.  For  example,  the  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sectoral  Strategic  Action  Plan  (2004) \ndefines  any  water  supply  schemes  serving  less  than  1,000  people  will  be  undertaken  by  local  bodies  and \nlarger projects will be taken up by the Department of Water Supply and Sanitation. This will be guided by the \ninstitutional capacity of DOLIDAR, which currently has a strong comparative advantage for rural roads and \nmotorable trail bridges. Similar such demarcation for irrigation (in terms of areas to be irrigated), hydropower \n(in terms of generation capacity), and roads (in terms of right of the way) are also defined in their respective \nsubsector  policy  documents.  In  areas  where  DDCs  and  their  line  offices  do  not  have  technical  capacity  to \nhandle the projects, they still need to be handled by district offices of the respective line ministries; for this \npurpose a memorandum of understanding has to be reached on a case-by-case basis. \n \n8. \nThe Local Self Governance Act 1999 and other subsector policy documents call for the preparation \nof periodic and subsector district development plans. They provide the list of projects in different subsectors \nidentified  after  extensive  consultations  with  all  stakeholders,  and  approved  by  the  DDCs.  Although  many \nneed  to  be  updated,  in  the  absence  of  elected  local  bodies  and  the  transitional  arrangement  to  form  them \ncomprising  representatives  from  the  major  political  parties  in  the  district  and  other  civil  societies,  these \ndistrict plan documents could be the starting point for selecting projects in different subsectors. They could \nbe  identified  following  a  certain  process  and  approved  by  the  DDCs.  Subprojects  to  be  eligible  for \nimplementation  must  be  from  one  of  these  district  plan  documents.  But  they  need  to  be  reranked  and \nreprioritized to include poverty and social inclusion as prioritization criteria. \n \n9. \nClassification  of  Rural  Roads.  Rural  roads  are  classified  under  two  government  systems.  The \nDepartment of Roads classifies feeder roads as rural roads that link district or zonal headquarters and major \ntourism,  industrial,  and  public  utility  centers  with  strategic  roads  (national  highways);  and  district  roads  as \nrural  roads  that  link  places  within  a  district  other  than  national  highways,  feeder  roads,  and  urban  roads. \nDOLIDAR classifies rural roads as district and village roads. All rural roads that connect one or more market, \ntourism  and  industrial  centers,  or  link  several  village  development  committees  (VDCs)  with  respective  or \nadjoining  district  headquarters  directly  or  through  a  strategic  road  network  are  classified  as  district  roads. \nRural  roads  that  connect  a  VDC  with  another  VDC,  district  road,  strategic  road,  or  major  growth  center  in \nrespective or neighboring districts are classified as village roads. Another classification of rural roads, mainly \npracticed  in  GTZ  and  SDC-supported  projects,  is  green  road.  This  classification  includes  primary  district \nroads  and  secondary  district  roads.  The  rural roads  linking  several  VDCs,  market  centers,  or  feeder roads \nare classified  as  primary district  roads, while  the  rural  roads  linking  two  or  more  VDCs, connecting  market \ncenters with the district, or linking with other roads are classified as secondary district roads. All these roads \nintend to improve access of rural populations to market and economic and social services. These roads are \nconstructed  following  different  design  and  implementation  standards.  The  Department  of  Roads  is \nresponsible for maintaining feeder roads, and the DDCs  are responsible for maintaining district roads. The \nDDCs with concerned VDCs and user groups are responsible for maintaining village roads. However, most \nrural roads lack maintenance due to shortage of funds and lack of a proper mechanism established during \nconstruction. \n \n10. \nDistrict  Transport  Master  Plan.  District  transport  master  plans  (DTMPs)  list  the  road  alignments \nproposed  by  the  VDCs.  They  make  demands  for  additional  road  linkages  with  justifications  based  on \npopulation  served  and  services  they  will  provide,  and  also  providing  their  own  contribution.  DTMPs  were \nprepared for 74 districts and preparation of a DTMP is under way for one district. However, the DTMPs are \nnot  uniform  in  quality  and  coverage  and  many  need  to  be  updated.  Nonetheless,  as  the  screening  and \nprioritizing process does not have explicit and objective  criteria to cover poor and social inclusion aspects, \nthese DTMPs need to be revisited. For this, the manuals providing guidelines for screening and prioritizing \nrural roads for new construction, upgrading, and rehabilitation need to be updated. \n \n11. \ninfrastructure projects, mainly focusing on improving rural access: \n\nOngoing  Rural  Road  Development  Projects.  DOLIDAR  is  currently  implementing  four  rural \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n37\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nDecentralized  Rural  Infrastructure  and  Livelihood  Project  (DRILP:  2005\u20132011)  assisted  by \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  Swiss  Agency  for  Development  and  Cooperation \n(SDC) in 18 districts, \nRural  Access  Program  (2001\u20132008)  assisted  by \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom in 7 districts, \nRural Access Improvement and Decentralization Project (2005\u20132010) assisted by the World \nBank in 20 districts, and \nDistrict Roads Support Program (phase III: 2006\u20132010) assisted by SDC in four districts. \n\nthe  Department \n\nInternational \n\nfor \n\nof \n\nThe \n\nrural \n\nother \n\nprograms \n\nDOLIDAR \n\ninfrastructure \n\n \nAside  from  these,  the Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  is  supporting  bridge construction  at \n12. \nseveral sites with SDC assistance in the construction of suspension bridges to improve connectivity to rural \nareas. \nare  \n(i) rural agriculture road and local development work program, (ii) repair and maintenance of large and local \nsuspension bridges (with support from SDC), (iii) rural drinking water and sanitation program (with support \nfrom the Government of Finland), (iv) local development fund for small-scale infrastructure development (with \nUnited Nations Capital Development Fund), and (v) remote and special area development program. \n \nThese rural road projects and programs follow labor intensive, environment friendly, and participatory \n13. \napproaches.  However,  DOLIDAR\u2019s  main  concern  has  been  inconsistent  approaches  adopted  by  donor-\nsupported  projects.  These  include  (i)  different  criteria  for  subproject  selection,  (ii)  separate  implementation \nmodalities, and (iii) varying reporting requirements. DOLIDAR intends to harmonize the operating procedures \nof  donor-  and  Government-supported  projects.  As  these  projects  have  different  time  frames  and  are  at \ndifferent  stages  of  implementation,  broad  agreement  must  be  reached  among  all  concerned  on  a  single \noperating  modality,  even  for  ongoing  projects,  and  a  joint  agreement  for  restructuring  the  ongoing  projects \nmay have to be initiated.  \n \nRural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation.  The  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  sectoral  policies  and \n14. \nSectoral  Action  Plan  (2004)  provide  major  policy  guidelines  on  water  supply  with  a  focus  on  community-\nowned  and  -managed  systems  and  classify  projects  for  the  DDCs  and  Department  of  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation to undertake based on number of population served by water supply schemes. Two major projects \non water supply and sanitation are ongoing: Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project Phase II supported \nby the World Bank, and Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project supported by ADB. \nBoth will provide water supply to 2,400 communities in different parts of the country, and both work through \nwater user groups. These projects are ending in 2009 and 2010, respectively. The Government of Finland is \nsupporting a separate program on water resource management. \n \n15. \nIrrigation.  The  Irrigation  Policy  (2003)  and  Irrigation  Regulations  (2004)  are  the  policy  documents \nguiding irrigation development in the country. Irrigation projects commanding more than 200 hectares (ha) in \nthe terai and 25 hectares in the hills and mountains are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Irrigation, \nwhile  the  DDCs  are  mandated  to  implement  irrigation  projects  servicing  below  these  thresholds.  However, \nirrespective of the size of the command area, irrigation projects have to be planned and implemented jointly \nwith  water  user  groups  and  associations.  Two  irrigation  projects  are  ongoing:  Community  Groundwater \nIrrigation  Sector  Project  and  Community-Managed  Irrigated  Agriculture  Sector  Project,  both  supported  by \nADB,  are  to  be  closed  in  2007  and  2012,  respectively.  The  Government  is  preparing  microirrigation  policy \nand implementation guidelines to promote microirrigation, i.e., treadle pumps and drip and sprinkler systems \ntargeted at marginal farmers. \n \n16. \nExperience  in  Land  Acquisition.  As  per  the  need  for  development  projects,  the  Government \nacquires private land, and landowners are compensated according to the law of the land. Landowners are \nalso  allowed  to  donate  their  land.  However,  whether  landowners  donate  land  voluntarily  or  through  social \npressure  is  not  always  clear,  as  the  process  adopted  during  donations  is  often  not  properly  recorded  and \nverified  by  a  third  party.  Whether  landowners  are  given  options  for  compensation  or  voluntary  donation  of \ntheir  lands  is  also  not  clear.  Such  practice  increases  the  risk  of  the  landowners  being  worse  off  from  a \ndevelopment  project.  Hence,  a  national  policy  is  needed  with  clear  guidelines  to  screen,  assess,  and  plan \nland acquisition for development projects. Although provisions could be made for voluntary land donation by \nthe  nonpoor,  greater  care  is  needed  in  handling  land  acquisition  from  poor  households  and  vulnerable \n\n \n\n\f38 \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ngroups.  This  requires  proper  planning  and  monitoring.  Land  acquisition  requiring  involuntary  resettlement \nshould be avoided where feasible by exploring viable options; resettlement may disrupt residents\u2019 economic \nand  social  future.  If  displacement  becomes  unavoidable,  they  should  be  adequately  compensated  for  the \nloss of and or means of livelihood or social support system. \n \nLessons.

 programs  covering  rural \ninfrastructure and poverty reduction across Nepal, not including the many local projects supported \nby international agencies, nongovernment organizations, and community-based organizations. Not \nall major programs are present in each of the 75 districts, ranging from 2\u20138 in any given one. The \nfoci of the major programs include \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\nroad  construction  and \n\nlabor-based  and  environmentally  sound \n\nstrengthening connectivity within rural areas;  \ndeveloping livelihoods and access; \npromoting \nmaintenance methods;  \nstrengthening capacity of decentralized local government for planning, quality, and \nsustainability of rural roads;  \nenabling families to gain and preserve assets that directly contribute to sustainable \nimprovements in food security; \nproviding easy access to markets, and to economic and basic service centers; \nstrengthening  local  capabilities  for  implementing  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation \nschemes; \nproviding  holistic  support  for  sustainable,  market-oriented  agriculture  and  livestock \ndevelopment; and \nimproving  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  schemes  through  a  demand-driven \napproach  and  empowering  communities  to  take  responsibility  for  operation  and \nmaintenance. \n\n \nGiven  the  number  of  programs  and  because  many  programs  include  more  than  just  rural \n2. \ninfrastructure  components,  the  Government  is  faced  with  a  major  challenge  to  manage  and \ncoordinate the initiatives centrally among different ministries and in the districts. Additionally, donor \nrequirements  related  to  procurement,  safeguards,  reporting,  etc.,  significantly  strain  the  limited \ncapacity  and  resources  of  the  Government.  These  factors  provide  justification  for  developing  an \nintegrated  framework  to  harmonize  donor  funding  and  to  move  the  sector  or  subsector  to  joint \nfunding arrangements. While the need is clear and urgent, development of such an arrangement \nrequires several steps that could take up to 3\u20134 years. In the meantime, the Government proposes \ndevelopment of an interim joint donor framework to help coordinate rural infrastructure programs. \n \n3. \nThe  Ministry  of  Local  Development  (MLD)  is  charged,  under  its  charter,  with  developing \nlocal  governance,  rural  infrastructure,  and  economic  and  social  inclusion.  It  is  seeking  to  lead  a \nresults,  and  mutual \ncoordinated  approach \naccountability, across the various ongoing programs as well as prepare for new initiatives, through \nthe framework of the Rural Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Sector Development Program. MLD \nhas already taken the first step by changing the current Joint Local Transport Steering Committee \ninto a joint steering committee for rural infrastructure (JSCRI). This new body will have a broader \nmandate,  and  comprise  joint  secretaries  from  seven  key  ministries  and  agencies  including  the \nNational  Planning  Commission,  and  be  chaired  by  MLD.  Where  areas  overlap  with  programs  in \nrelated  sectors  or  jurisdictional  conflicts  arise  with  other  infrastructure-related  lead  ministries,  the \npresence of the National Planning Commission will enhance rational and early resolution of such \nconflicts.  \n \n4. \nMLD has still to resolve how to encourage other key steering committees to come together \nand  work  together  at  the  center.  Even  though  the  boundaries  of  what  exactly  constitutes  rural \ninfrastructure remain somewhat unclear, donors supporting and working through district and village \ndevelopment committees are expected to join in the new JSCRI, either through direct participation \n\nto  alignment,  harmonization,  managing \n\nfor \n\n \n\n\f50 \n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nor through representation on behalf of a group of donors under other key steering committees. At \nthe same time, MLD recognizes that it will need to coordinate in the regions and districts as well. \n5. \n\nKey steps in the interim period, not necessarily in strict order or in series, are \n(i) \n\nsecuring  donors\u2019  agreement  on  adopting  the  donor  coordination  framework  and \ngovernance mechanism at a newly relaunched JSCRI; \nidentifying  any  technical  assistance  required  to  assist  MLD  in  moving  to  a  joint \nfunding  arrangement  and  looking  at  low-cost  options  including  assistance  from \nexisting donor-funded rural infrastructure programs; \njoint  assessment  of  and  agreement  on  the  gaps  in  current  policy  in  rural \ninfrastructure, including the steps needed to rectify these gaps; \nformal  launching  of  the  SDP,  and  mobilization  of  central  and  district  technical \nassistance; \nagreeing  on  central  reforms  needed  for  better  governance  of  rural  infrastructure \ninitiatives  for  poverty  reduction,  and  establishing  a  time  frame  with  milestones  and \nresources for implementation; and \nagreeing on a road map to develop a sector or subsector joint funding arrangement, \nincluding tentative targets, outputs, and working groups as necessary. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n6. \nWith  respect  to  a  joint  funding  arrangement,  experience  to  date  confirms  that  countries \nengaged  in  sectorwide  and  program-based  approaches  have  taken  different  paths.1  The  choice \nhas  been  related  to  contextual  factors  specific  to  the  country  and  sector.  Nevertheless,  common \nsteps provide MLD with a basis for discussing the Government\u2019s desire and readiness for a rural \ninfrastructure  sectorwide  or  program-based  approach,  and  to  determine  the  donor  community\u2019s \nwillingness to join. The major steps include \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\na clear and nationally owned sector policy and overall strategy;  \na statement of intent between government and donors; \nMedium-Term  Expenditure  Framework  programming  and/or  accounting  for  sector \nresources, and fund-flow mechanisms for both central and local levels; \njoint appraisal and monitoring; \nsector performance monitoring and accountability system; \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi)  mechanisms for sector dialogue and coordination; \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\ninclusive consultation mechanisms involving all stakeholders; and \ncapacity-building plan. \n\n \n7. \nTo  take  advantage  of  current  donor  momentum  behind  this  initiative,  the  SDP  includes \nassistance under the capacity building component to help the Government develop the framework \nand interim measures to coordinate donor projects. \n                                                 \n1   The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and Learning Network on Program Based Approaches \ndefine  the  program-based  approach  as  a  way  of  engaging  in  development  cooperation  based  on  the  principle  of \ncoordinated support for a locally owned program of development, such as a national poverty reduction strategy, sector \nprogram, thematic program, or program of a specific organization. PBAs share the following features: (i) leadership by \nthe host country or organization; (ii) a single comprehensive program and budget framework; (iii) a formalized process \nfor  aid  coordination  and  harmonization  of  donor  procedures  for  reporting,  budgeting,  financial  management  and \nprocurement;  and  (iv)  efforts  to  increase  the  use  of  local  systems  for  program  design  and  implementation,  financial \nmanagement, monitoring, and evaluation. A sectorwide approach is a PBA operating for an entire sector. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n51\n\nCENTRAL IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT CONSULTANTS \n\n \n1. \nThe objective of the central consulting services is to support the project coordination unit to \n(i)  deliver  the  planned  outputs  and  outcomes  on  schedule;  (ii)  backstop  the  district  implementing \nagencies;  (iii)  ensure  compliance  with  safeguard  policies  including  social,  environmental,  and \nresettlement  safeguards;  (iv)  meet  reporting  requirements  of  the  Government  and  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB);  and  (v)  develop  institutional  capacities  of central  and  local  institutions \ninvolved  in  rural  infrastructure.  Consultant  inputs  cover  expertise  related  to  engineering, \nconstruction  supervision,  social  development,  environmental  management,  resettlement  and \ncompensation  policy,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  quality  control  and  quality  assurance,  fiduciary \nand  financial  management,  training  and  capacity  building,  procurement,  sector  stakeholder \nintegration,  and  project  management  (work  program  and  budgeting,  administration,  monitoring, \nand reporting). \n \n2. \nA  core  team  of  consultants  will  comprise  a  rural  infrastructure  expert  (team  leader-\ninternational),  construction  engineer  (deputy  team  leader),  social  development  specialist,  rural \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  specialist,  bridge  specialist,  environmental  management  specialist, \nresettlement  specialist,  procurement  specialist,  financial  management  specialist,  and  policy/aide \neffectiveness  specialist.  In  addition,  two  full-time  rural  infrastructure  engineers  and  two  regional \nsocial coordinators will each be in charge of one of two regional groupings of project districts, as \nmembers of the central consulting team. Specialized services in areas like technical audit, quality \nassurance,  impact  evaluation,  bioengineering,  training,  and  capacity  building  will  be  procured  for \nshorter  durations  on  an  as  and  when  needed  basis.  This  arrangement  will  optimize  consultant \ninputs  and  provide  flexibility  during  project  implementation.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  in \ncollaboration with other projects and benefit from other initiatives and expertise. \n \n3. \nThe project coordination unit will recruit the central consulting services in two subsets. First, \nfive consultants will be recruited individually (the Government may seek permission and agree on \nprocedures  with  ADB  to  initiate  advance  action  for  their  recruitment)  so  that  they  can  be  fielded \nupon project effectiveness. The expertise recruited will be in procurement, financial management, \nenvironment, resettlement, and policy/aid effectiveness. The bulk of this consultant expertise (the \nfirst  four  experts)  is  critical  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Department  of  Local  Infrastructure \nDevelopment  and  Agricultural  Roads  and  district  development  committees,  and  establish \nprocedures so that gaps can be filled to ensure an orderly and effective start-up. These consultants \nwill  be  tasked  to  compile  local-language  manuals  and  step-by-step  procedures,  and  deliver  the \nmanuals and training in regional workshops for district project office staff soon after project start-\nup. The fifth expert in policy/aide effectiveness will be charged with developing the framework for \ndonor  and  government  integration  towards  a  common  approach  and  financing  scheme  for  rural \ninfrastructure development. This is an area where interest is currently strong and where support is \nseen as imperative to maintain the momentum of building such an initiative. \n \n4. \nThe second subset of central implementation support consultants will contain the balance of \nneeded  expertise  and  will  be  recruited  using  a  consultant  package  from  a  firm  using  the  quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  procedure  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  Government  may  also  seek  permission \nand agree on procedures with ADB to initiate advance action for the recruitment of this package of \nconsultants.  Again,  mobilize  consultants  upfront  is  important  to  help  establish  an  early  project \nimplementation  framework  and  management  structures,  and  institutionalize  procedures  and \nguidelines. \n \n5. \nOverall,  for  the  individual  and  firm-packaged  consultants,  a  total  of  51  person-months  of \nservices  from  international  and  about  464  person-months  from  national  consultants  will  be \n\n \n\n\f52 \n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nrequired.  An  indicative  list  of  the  types  of  specialization  and  person-months  of  inputs  are \nsummarized in Table A8. \n \n\nTable A8: Central Implementation Support Consultants \n \n\n \nConsultants/Associates \nA.

The \ncomposition  of  the  services  will  vary  by  district  and  typically  include  (i)  a  rural  infrastructure \nengineer  supported  by  two  junior  engineers/overseers  and  five  suboverseers,  (ii)  a  social \ndevelopment officer supported by three social mobilizers/community facilitators, (iii) a resettlement \nspecialist and an environmental specialist, and (iv) an accountant and two support staff. Provision \nis  made  for unallocated input  to  meet  special  needs  (such as  geotechnical,  hydrology,  etc.).  The \nservices will generally be full time for the project period except for the resettlement environmental \nspecialists who will be employed in the early phases of implementation, and subsequently only as \nneeded, and the unallocated specialists who will be deployed only as needed. \n \nThe  DISTs  will  set  out  works  at  sites  with  the  participation  of  building  groups  and/or \n2. \ncontractors to ensure that they understand the work to be undertaken. They provide coaching and \non-job-training to workers to maintain quality and standards, as well as to enhance building group \nskills.  They  also  monitor  working  conditions,  social  aspects,  and  compliance  with  environmental \nand resettlement recommendations. \n \n3. \nOf  the  38  project  districts,  18  are  districts  of  the  Decentralized  Rural  Infrastructure  and \nLivelihood Project  (DRILP) and have district support teams in place. Therefore, the DISTs will be \nrecruited  by  district  project  offices  in  the  20  new  districts,  for  the  Rural  Reconstruction  and \nRehabilitation  Sector  Development  Program,  through  a  single  firm  or  integrated  association  of \nfirms/nongovernment organizations. Provision is made for one water resource engineer, overseer, \nand suboverseer for each of the 18 DRILP districts to cover rural water supply and sanitation. The \nwater  resource  engineers  and  assistants  are  to  be  recruited  individually  by  the  DRILP  district \nproject offices. \n \n\nTable A9: Indicative District Implementation Support, per District \n\nDIST for 20 New RRRSDP Districts \n1. \na. \nb. \nc. \nd. \ne. \nf. \n \n2. \na. \nb. \nc. \nd. \n\nStaff \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB.

The  subprojects  will  be  funded  by  the  Project  if  they  rank  high  according  to  the  criteria. \nWillingness to share the costs of the water supply and sanitation subproject will be based on the \nGovernment\u2019s  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Policy  and  Strategy.  For  poor \ncommunities3 in remote inaccessible areas, the minimum contribution will be reduced to 10% and \n1%  upfront  cash  is  not  mandatory.  If  the  project  districts  overlap  with  community-based  water \nsupply  and  sanitation  districts,4  the  Project  should  select  the  subproject  based  on  the  existing \npriority list of the DDC.  \n \n6. \n \n\nRequired eligibility criteria include \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nwater supply and sanitation scheme is included in the district plan; \ndemand for a water scheme originated from the community; \n\n                                                 \n1   Construction  of  new  (as  opposed  to  rehabilitation  of  existing)  irrigation  schemes  has  been  excluded  because  of  the \n\ncomplexity of the process of surveying and designing a new scheme and organizing participatory management. \n\n2   This is consistent with the criteria that 19 hill and mountain districts of the far Midwestern district, and 2 western (1 terai \nand  1  hill)  districts  following  under  the  Community  Based  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project.  Ministry  of \nPhysical  Planning  and  Works  (lead  agency  for  water  supply  and  sanitation)  adopted  the  criteria  for  the  Community \nBased Water Supply and Sanitation.     \n\n3   According  to  the  Nepal  Poverty  Assessment  1999  indicators  poor  households  are  (i)  households  having  food \nsufficiency  for  less  than  6  months  in  a  year;  (ii)  households  whose  major  source  of  income  is  wage  from  labor;  \n(iii)  households  headed  by  women  with  disabled  persons;  and  (iv)  other  households  with  low  literacy  and \nunsatisfactory health indicators.  \n\n4   Accham, Baitadi, Bajhang, Bajura, Dadeldhura, Dailekha, Dang, Darchula, Dolpa, Doti, Gulmi, Humla, Jajarkot, Jumla, \n\nKalikot, Kapilvastu, Mugu, Pyuthan, Rolpa, Rukum,, and Salyan.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n58 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nthe community is willing to contribute as per the Government\u2019s Rural Water Supply \nand Sanitation Sector Policy and Strategies; community contribution is 20% (cash or \nin-kind) and 1% cash up-front;5 \nthe community accepts responsibility for operation and maintenance of the scheme \nafter its completion; \nthe  DDCs  and  VDCs  commit  to  maintain  the  scheme  in  case  of  natural  calamities \nand required major rehabilitation; and \n\n(vi)  maximum  1,000  people  per  scheme  (and  subject  to  available  and  equitably \ndistributed  supplementary  investment  budget  across  all  districts);  indicative  costs \nper  person,  new  construction  up  to  NRs5,000  per  person  and  rehabilitation  up  to \nNRs3,000  (maximum  NRs5  million);  water  supply  may  be  complemented  by \ninvestments  in  sanitary/health  infrastructure  such  as  private  and  public  toilets,  and \nimproved  cooking  stoves,  as  long  as  the  total  budgetary  outlays  remain  within  the \nindicated limits. \n\n \n7. \nProcess of Prioritization. Selected subproject must pass the screening criteria. After the \nscreening process, the schemes demand is ranked as per the criteria for screening. Poverty, water \nsupply  coverage,  and  incidence  of  diarrhea  and  other  waterborne  diseases  are  major  criteria  for \nscreening. \n \n8. \n\nVillage planning includes that the communities \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nsubmit the demand form to the DDCs through the VDCs, and \nare  willing  to  share  the  costs  of  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  subproject  as  per \nthe Government\u2019s Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Policy. \n\nDistrict planning involves the following: \n(i) \n(ii) \n\ncommunity demand must be included in the DDC plan, \nthe DDCs must prioritize all demands based on the social and poverty factors and \nhardship factors, and \ncriteria for subproject ranking will be defined and adopted for prioritizing the demand \nby community (though the VDCs) for implementation based on the priority. \n\n(iii) \n\n                                                 \n5   However,  in  the  case  of  poor  and  ultra-poor,  the  up-front  cash  requirement  can  be  foregone,  and  the  in-kind \n\ncontribution lowered to 10%. \n\n \n9. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n\nYear 0\n\nYear 1\n\nYear 2\n\nYear 3\n\nYear

For  rural  roads  with  limited  or  no \n10. \nmotorized traffic, the first benefit defined is for person-trip savings due to construction of the road \nand  more  efficient  modes  of  transport.  Pedestrian  trips  are  time  consuming  and  relatively  costly \ncompared  with  motorized  transport1  that  will  become  available  with  provision  of  the  road.  Due  to \nthe  savings  and  relative  ease  of  motorized  travel,  more  passenger  trips  will  be  generated.  The \nvalue of the generated trips is taken at half the rate for existing trips. \n \n11. \nPreproject  cargo  movement  is  estimated  to  comprise  (i)  the  surplus  of  agriculture \nimports  of  25  kilograms \nfeed,  seed,  and  wastage;  and  (ii) \nproduction  beyond \n(kg)/capita/annum  for  nonagricultural  goods  and  200  kg/hectare  (ha)  for  agricultural  goods \n(fertilizer, compost, manure, agrochemicals, tools, seed, etc.). Existing goods transport is provided \nby porters, which costs NRs354 per ton-km. This rate is high by comparison to light trucks that will \nply the road at NRs10.6 per ton-km.2 For simplicity, the with-project vehicle operating cost (VOC) \nper ton-km is based on 75% truck and 25% porter carriage. The large savings for cargo transport \ndominate  the  benefits  of  new  roads.  The  lowered  cargo  transport  prices  will  also  generate \nincreased  exports  and  imports.3  Per  capita  imports  of  nonagricultural  goods  are  assumed  to \n                                                 \n1   The vehicle operating cost per kilometer for a light bus ranges from NRs28 to NRs34 for fair-to-good condition, hilly-to-\nmountainous roads of earthen to gravel standard. The corresponding international roughness indexes are 10 to 13 for \ngravel surface and 13 to 16 for earthen surface. Bus carriage rate is 25 passengers. \n\n2   The  vehicle  operating  cost  per  km  for  a  light  truck  ranges  from  NRs23  to  NRs30  for  fair-to-good  condition,  hilly-to-\nmountainous roads of earthen to gravel standard. The corresponding international roughness indexes are 10 to 13 for \ngravel surface and 13 to 16 for earthen surface. Light truck load capacity is 4 tons. \n\n3   However, since increased agricultural production due to opening the road is valued separately as a benefit, to avoid \n\ndouble counting of benefits, only generated nonagricultural goods transport is accounted for here. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n \n\n63\n\nincrease from 25 to 50 kg/capita, including such items as building materials, food stuffs, and other \nhousehold items. Per convention, the generated cargo is valued at one half the savings for existing \ngoods.  \n \n12.  With  the  introduction  of  the  road  and  motorized  transport,  farmers  gain  better  access  to \nfarm  inputs,  technology,  and  markets.  This  will  result  in  (i)  increased  use  of  inputs,  (ii)  improved \nfarm  practices,  and  (iii)  a  move  to  more  market-oriented  production.  With  the  Project,  a  modest \nchange  in  mix  of  crops  is  assumed.  Higher-value  vegetables  are  assumed  to  take  on  an \nincremental  3%  of  the  annual  cropping  regime.  For  the  remaining  cropping  base  (dominated  by \ncereals),  increases  in  inputs  and  yields  are  expected,  with  production  expected  to  rise  by  5%. \nThese gains are assumed to be phased in equally over a 5-year period from road completion. \n \n13. \nRural Road with Traffic and Traffic Count. Benefits for the sample road upgrade in the \nplains are based on VOC savings and the value of generated trips. The basis for comparison of the \nwithout-  and  with-project  scenarios  is  (i)  the  traffic  count  for  the  existing  road/path,  and  (ii)  the \ntraffic count of an already upgraded road of similar setting and proximity. The traffic count for the \nexisting  road/path  amounts  to  about  40  motor  or  animal-powered  vehicles  per  day.  The \ncorresponding  traffic  count  for  the  matched  upgraded  road  is  391,  for  mostly  motorized  vehicles. \nFor  the  existing  situation,  the  setting  is  for  poor  earthen  roads  at  international  roughness  index \n(IRI) of 20; and for the with-project condition, the condition is assessed as good gravel road (at IRI \n10). \n \n14. \nAfter completion of the subproject, a shift will occur to more efficient and cheaper means of \ntransport (from nonmotorized to motorized transport). The existing alignment is subject to weather \ndisruptions and fragmented due to lack of key crossings. The proposed subproject will upgrade to \nan  all-weather  surface  and  supply  two  critical  bridges  to  allow  traffic  to  flow  unimpeded.  The \nsavings over existing travel is due to lower VOCs. Due to the savings, relative ease of motorized \ntravel, and greater access, additional trips will be generated. The value of the incremental trips is \ntaken at one half. \n \n15. \nRural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation.  For  the  representative  subproject,  currently  17 \nsettlements  secure  their  water  supply  from  aged  and  simple  systems,  or  natural  springs.  An \naverage family spends over 3 hours per day securing household water needs. This comprises five \ntrips per day per household, with 15 liters carried per trip. Villagers are also beset with a variety of \nwaterborne  illnesses  and  complications,  including  diarrhea,  worms,  and  skin  infections.  These \nafflictions,  besides  the  discomfort  and  threat  to  health,  manifest  in  two  quantifiable  outcomes: \nmedical expenditure and lost workdays. The reported water usage ranges from 60 to 150 liters per \nhousehold per day among the settlements, with an overall average of 75.3 liters per household per \nday. This equates to 15 liters per capita per day.  \n \n16.  With  the  subproject,  villagers  will  have  better  access  and  availability  to  water  access. \nHouseholds  are  expected  to  reduce  water-fetching  times  by  half.  Medical  expenses  for  treating \nwaterborne  illnesses  are  expected  to  drop,  as  will  adult  working  days  lost  to  illnesses.  Better \naccess,  higher  quality,  and  more  secure  supplies  will  result  in  increased  consumption;  the \nincrement  of  which  is  valued  as  generated  usage.  Table  A14.2  provides  the  range  and  type  of \nquantified benefits for the subprojects. \n \n17. \nNonquantified  Benefits.  Roads  will  bring  substantial  social  value  in  the  way  of  better \naccess to services and increased mobility. Upgraded transport facilitates (i) contact with health and \neducation service providers, (ii) social connectivity, and (iii) employment opportunities. Rural roads \nalso tend to attract settlement and small-business development, with land values adjacent to roads \nincreasing accordingly. Also with improved access, more buyers will ply the roads and increase the \n\n \n\n\f64 \n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nmarket  for  livestock  production  and  sales.  Along  with  the  primary  road  investment,  a  demand-\ndriven  community  training  and  infrastructure  program  will  be  implemented.  This  complementary \ninvestment  will  target  the  poor  and  enhance  livelihoods.  The  water  supply  approach  includes \nmeasures  to  (i)  bolster  community  sanitation, (ii)  increase  awareness  of  health  and  hygiene,  and \n(iii) provide a vulnerable group plan. \n \n\n12 \n\nTable A14.2: Subproject Benefits \n(NRs \u2019000) \n\nCore Subproject  \n\nSavings over \nExisting Usage \n \n40,345 \n1.

The benefits \nfor the fourth road, which is already traveled and has a traffic count, are taken as savings on vehicle operating \ncosts and the value of generated travel. For the fifth subproject (water supply), only savings over existing usage \nand generated consumption are valued. \nSource:Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nGenerated Usage \nValue \n1,303 \n2,287 \n491 \n15,214 \n4,182 \n\nProducer \nSurplus \n17,268 \n20,464 \n12,010 \n0 \n0 \n\nTotal \n58,915 \n63,406 \n24,288 \n21,255 \n6,897 \n\n2. \n\nCosts \n\n \n18. \nCosts for the subprojects are grouped into three main categories: (i) project preparation; (ii) \nconstruction; and (iii) safeguards for the roads, or community program in the case of drinking water \nsupply. For roads, the safeguard program includes resettlement administration and compensation, \nand  environmental  and  social  mitigation  and  monitoring.  The  water  supply  community  program \nincludes  environmental  sanitation,  health  and  hygiene,  and  a  vulnerable  group  plan.  Total \nsubproject  costs  include  physical  and  price  contingencies.  Both  for  roads  and  the  rural  drinking \nwater  supply  subprojects,  provision  has  been  made  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  For \ncomparison  on  a  unit  basis,  Table  A14.3  presents  the  physical  costs  (including  preparation, \nconstruction,  safeguard/community  measures,  and  physical  contingency,  excluding  price \ncontingencies). \n \n\nTable A14.3: Subproject Costs \n\nTotal Costs  \n(NRs million) \n\nPer Km \n(NRs \u2018000) \n\nPer Hh \n(NRs) \n\nPer Person \n(NRs) \n\n \n\nCore Subproject \nBhojpur-Manebhanjyang \nRoad \n\n1. \n2.

Increases in \n21. \nhousehold  income  are  expected  due  to  improved  farmer  access  to  inputs,  technology,  and \nmarkets.  For  the  hill  locations,  the  road  development  is  expected  to  induce  an  increase  of  \n8%\u201313%  in  household  farm  income,  and  for  the  plains  subproject,  increases  of  12%\u201317%.  The \nlarge plains increment relative to the hills is due partly to the larger average farm size and to the \ngrowing  conditions  and  yields  in  the  lowland  areas.  For  the  water  supply  scheme,  the  value  of \nsavings for a household derives from reduced time for water fetching, reduced medical expenditure \non  waterborne  disease,  and  reduction  in  lost  workdays  to  illness.  For  water  supply,  average \nhousehold  gains  are  estimated  as  (i)  NRs3,400  for  time  savings,  (ii)  NRs250  for  medical \n\n                                                 \n4   Along with this shortened life, benefits are assumed to decline proportionately, year-by-year. \n\n \n\n\f66 \n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nfrom  19 \n\nexpenditure saved, and (iii) NRs950 for reduction in lost workdays. For household income, wages \nduring  subproject  construction  will  provide  about  NRs3.2  thousand  to  NRs12.6  thousand  per \nhousehold  if  employment  is  spread  evenly  (i)  across  the  2-hour  distant  populations  of  the  road \nsubprojects,  and  (ii)  over  the  direct  beneficiary  population  in  the  case  of  water  supply.  A  labor-\nbased approach is taken for construction. For the subprojects, the gain in construction employment \nto  76  days  per  year  during \n(for  households  within  2-hours  distance)  ranges \nimplementation. Increases in agricultural employment are expected with the completion of the road \nsubprojects. Additional labor days per household are expected in the range of 12\u201352 per year for \n2-hour  distant  populations  of  the  different  subprojects.  Approximately  two  jobs  per  km  will  be \ncreated for O&M of the roads. With the opening of the road, some permanent roadside business \nand  employment  will  be  generated,  estimated  at  5\u201310  jobs  generated  per  km.  Lastly,  agriculture \nproduction will increase in the influence zones of the road subprojects. Food and income security \nwill  be  boosted,  as  production  per  family  is  expected  to  increase  by  0.7\u20131.0  tons  within  2  hours \ndistance of the completed roads. \n \nE.  \n \n22. \nTable  A14.6  provides  a  sample  summary  of  the  subproject  distribution  analyses.  The \nassumption  for  the  analysis  is  that  the  poor  make  up  90%  of  unskilled  laborers  and  60%  of  the \ngeneral population of farmers, villagers, passengers, and water-users. The poor are also assumed \nto represent 0.0% of the vehicle owners, and have a 10% stake in the Government/economy. The \nshare of benefits to the poor per net economic benefit is greater than the share of the poor in the \npopulation at large. This indicates that the poor benefit significantly from the Project and suggests \nthat poverty reduction is targeted. \n \n\nDistribution of Subproject Benefits \n\nTable A14.6: Summary of Distribution Analysis \n(NPV in NRs '000 at 12% discount rate) \n\nFarmers / \n\n \n\nUnskilled  Vehicle  Passengers  Government \n\n/Villagers \n\n/Economy \n\n \n \nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n \n  \n\nLabor \n\n  \n \nItem \n\n  \n \n  \n1.

For roads, the sources \nof  funding  are  from  the  government,  including  local  and  national  sources.  An  average  district's \nannual revenue is about NRs200 million.5 For rural water supply and sanitation, the approach is for \nusers  to  finance  O&M  through  user  fees.  These  are  typically  in  the  range  of  NRs20\u2013NRs30  per \nhousehold per month. While affordable to most, some poorer households are unable to meet the \n\n                                                 \n5  Road  Fund  Nepal  is  another  source  of  dedicated  funds  for  road  maintenance  on  a  matching  basis  with  district \n\ncontributions. Internally generated revenue in an average district is about NRs10 million\u2013NRs30 million. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n \n\n67\n\nexpense. However, usually scope is available to contribute in-kind through labor to cover fees. The \nsample  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  scheme  is  from  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance feasibility study. In terms of willingness to pay, the beneficiaries expressed in meetings \nand  surveys  (to  the  nongovernment  organization  executing  the  feasibility  study)  that  they  were \nwilling to pay NRs30 per household per month, an amount in excess of the financially calculated \nNRs25 per household per month requirement. However, the community confirmed commitment to \nthe higher rate so that benefits could be transferred to subsidize poorer families of the community. \nLastly, community buildings (such as for commons, health, or education) provide an example of a \npublic good for which direct benefits are not as tangible and distinct. In rural infrastructure such as \nthis, public financing for O&M via village funds is common. The village grant from national budget \nis NRs 1 million per annum. \n \n \n\nTable A14.7: O&M Requirement of Key Subprojects \n\nRural Infrastructure \nExample \nDistrict rural roads: 40 \nkm at NRs4 million per \nkm for NRs160 million \ninvestment \n\n \nO&M Requirement \n\nAt standard of \nNRs100,000/km -> \nNRs4 million per year \nper district \n\n \nSource of Funds \nNepal Road Fund, the \nGovernment block \ngrant to DDC, DDC-\ngenerated internal \nrevenue \n\nRural water supply \n(Chandane WSS): a \ngravity system of NRs18 \nmillion serving 591 \nhouseholds \n\nCalculated annual O&M \ncost for maintenance \nworkers and materials: \nNRs176,000, or \nNRs300/HH/year, or \nNRs25/HH/month \n\nRural water supply \nschemes are provided \nby the Government and \noperated by the users \n(financed by user \ncharges) \n\nCommunity Building: 75 \nm2 at NRs10,000 per m2, \nor about NRs750,000 for \na post serving 100 HHs \n\nat 1.5% of investment -\n> NRs11,250, or about \nNRs110 per HH \n\nAs a village facility \nserving the public \nwelfare, O&M may be \nfinanced from village \nrevenue, from \ncommunity \ncontributions, or a \ncombination of both \n\nComment on \nRelative Impact \n\nAverage district \nrevenues are about \nNRs200 million.

To  achieve  this  target  the  Government  has  assumed  a  5%  annual  growth  rate  in  gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP).  Remittances,  more  and  more  decentralized  practices  of  program  implementation,  and  improvement  in \naccess  to  socioeconomic  infrastructures  are  some  of  the  positive  factors  to  help  achieve  the  poverty  reduction  goals.  Rural \ninfrastructures  development  along  with  social  sector  development  is  one  of  the  Government\u2019s  core  development  strategies.  The \nLocal Infrastructure Development Policy 2004, covering various rural infrastructure, has the primary goal of poverty reduction by \npromoting  access  of  local  people  particularly  women,  disabled,  disadvantaged  communities,  and  dalits  to  different  economic \nopportunities and social service delivery. \n \nThe decade-long conflict has stalled rural infrastructure development in many rural areas. Rural infrastructure is damaged, stalled, \nor  dilapidated  due  to  disturbances  in  regular  maintenance.  Now,  with  the  peace  process  in  progress,  this  infrastructure  needs \nreconstruction  and  rehabilitation.  The  sector  development  program  (SDP)  includes  improved  infrastructure,  social  mobilization, \nand  livelihood  skill  development  programs  particularly  aiming  at  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  communities.  It  will  help  poverty \nreduction  through  (i)  directly  employing  poor  people  in  the  construction  works  (public  works  program),  (ii)  linking  market  and \nproduction centers and promoting commercialization of agriculture among subsistence farm households, (iii) reducing the prices of \nbasic necessities, (iv) enhancing access to education and health services, (v) making local products competitive through reduced \ntransportation  cost,  (vi)  opening  new  employment  opportunities  such  as  in  repair  and  maintenance  of  consumer  durables \n(watches,  transistor  etc.),  (vii)  improving  access  to  cheaper  agricultural  inputs  and  raw  materials  for  other  cottage  and  small \nindustries, and (viii) increasing opportunities for technology transfer (training on livelihood skills, demonstration, and exposure). \n \nThe investment Project will focus on 20 districts and provide additional support for rural water supply and sanitation (WSS) in 18 \ndistricts  of  the  Decentralized  Rural  Infrastructure  and  Livelihood  Project.  The  eligibility  and  prioritization  criteria  ensure  the \nplanning  and  implementation  of  subprojects  serving  a  maximum  of  target  groups,  and  policy  thrust  on  choice  of  technology  is \nlabor-based, environment friendly, and participative. With safeguard measures and various training programs planned for the poor \nfor  livelihood  skills  in  place,  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  are  directly  targeted,  and  the  Project  will  ensure  poverty  reduction. \nThe  Project  will  assess  social  impact  and  vulnerability  of  affected  households  through  socioeconomic  surveys  and  community \nmeetings, and disaggregate information by gender, caste, and ethnicity. It will develop appropriate measures to restore livelihoods \nand enhance living standards of these people. Vulnerable groups, including women and disadvantaged ethnic and caste members \nwill be supported by the use of proportional representation in project employment and construction work, and targeted programs \nthrough livelihood empowerment interventions. \n \nThe  Project  will  enhance  rural  livelihoods  through  (i)  direct  wage  payments  to  poorer  households,  amounting  to  about  70%  of \nconstruction costs; (ii) training by social mobilizers for building groups and communities to access other development opportunities \nin  the  district;  (iii)  direct  assistance  for  community-driven  infrastructure  investments  to  complement  development  of  rural  roads; \nand (iv) skills development to reduce vulnerability and social exclusion. A total of 15.8 million  person-days of jobs and seasonal \nwork will be created during construction and maintenance of rural roads and rural water supply facilities. The Project is expected to \nstimulate more productive agriculture through the cultivation of high-value crops, leading to at least an 8%\u201317% increase in family \nincome. \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nPoverty in Nepal is basically a rural phenomenon; 35% of the rural population falls below the poverty line compared with 10% for \nthe urban population. Nepal experienced a decline in poverty incidence by 11 percentage points between 1995/96 and 2003/04, \nfrom 42% in 1995/96 to 31% in 2003/04. The decline was less rapid in the rural areas, and much more prominent in urban areas. \nPoverty  intensity  and  severity  are  also  higher  for  rural  areas.  This  means  that  the  growth  in  urban  areas  did  not  have  much \ndistributive effect in rural areas due to weak physical and institutional links between the two areas. During the conflict, such linkage \nwas  even  weaker.  The  other  reasons  are  low  agriculture  growth  rates  that  could  have  led  to  small  spillover  effects  on \nnonagricultural growth in rural areas. \n \nThe  relative  position  of  the  development  regions  has  not  changed  much;  poverty  incidence  is  higher  in  the  Midwestern  and \nFarwestern development regions. The human development index (HDI) also shows broadly the same pattern as income poverty, \nNepal with the HDI value of 0.527 ranked 138th of 150 countries in 2004. \n \nMany Nepalese leave the country for work; their remittances haves helped reduce poverty incidence. Remittances constitute 12% \n\n \nB. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n69\n\nof GDP and 35% of household income; 32% of households receive them. Households receiving remittances exist in all regions of \nthe country, although somewhat more concentrated in the west mountains and hills. \n \nPeople\u2019s access to socioeconomic infrastructure like motorable roads, schools, and health centers has increased markedly. The \ndecline in poverty incidence and improvement in human development indicators are attributed to this improved access. Even then, \nthe young girls may not go to school because their parents happen to be from disadvantaged communities, and they do not have \neasy access to the road and hence to other points of social service delivery. \n \nThe extreme poverty associated with social exclusion of disadvantaged communities has been partly responsible for conflict. The \ndeath casualty due to conflict in all the districts showed that such casualty is higher for the districts with higher poverty incidence \nand illiteracy. The social discrimination and exclusion have also contributed to the conflict through poverty. Conflict is more in the \ndistricts where social caste groups are polarized, and not so much in the districts where more fragmentation is observed with no \nthe  dominant  caste  groups.  In  such  a  situation,  conflict  or  for  that  matter  poverty  could  be  reduced  by  increasing  employment \nopportunities,  and  in  the  process  increasing  the  opportunity  cost  of  getting  involved  in  the  conflict  significantly  higher.  In  this \ncontext, the conflict heightened where the road access is exceedingly poor. \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    \nIs there a participation strategy?   \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nYes  \nYes  \n\nThe  Project  will  promote  participatory  approaches  through  the  decentralized  government  process.  Subprojects  will  be  prioritized \nthrough  existing  village  development  committee  participation  in  finalizing  district  transport  master  plans  or  other  sectoral \ndevelopment plans. The Project aims to increase the participation of local stakeholders, particularly socially excluded and poor, in \nthe  decision  making  through  a  community/social  mobilization  program.  Workshops  run  by  social  mobilizers  will  help  local \nstakeholders  develop  the  confidence  to  speak  at  meetings  and  participate  in  collective  decision  making.  Communities  will  be \ntrained by the social mobilizers to acquire skills to run community consultations. Within building groups, the capacity of men and \nwomen  to  voice  their  concerns  will  be  strengthened  through  training  they  will  receive  from  the  social  mobilization  and  capacity-\nbuilding activities.          \n \nThe  Project  will  promote  economic  and  social \nrepresentation  of  historically \nmarginalized/disadvantaged  population  for  all  aspects  of  project  planning  and  implementation,  particularly  in  employment  and \nincome generation activities. Local social mobilizers will organize the poor and marginalized into groups. Village infrastructure user \ngroups  will  also  have  proportional  representation  of  local  caste/ethnic  groups  along  the  project  influence  zone  to  (i)  ensure \nparticipation of the poor and vulnerable groups in decision-making, (ii) raise their social capital and access to other development \nopportunities, and (iii) increase their use of health and education facilities in local areas. \n \nThe Project  will build local ownership and maintenance of infrastructure  work by employing local membership-based district and \nvillage user groups in planning, implementation, and monitoring of construction work. Community-based monitoring systems and \npublic audit will be introduced to prevent corruption and increase social accountability and transparency.  \n \n\ninclusion  by  ensuring  proportional \n\nD. \n\nGender and Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nGender  issues  will  be  mainstreamed  throughout  project  planning  and  implementation.  The  monitoring  system  will  have  gender \nsensitive indicators and output/impact data disaggregated by gender, caste, and ethnicity. Household socioeconomic surveys will \nbe disaggregated by gender, caste, and ethnicity; and focus group discussions will be held separately with women's groups in the \naffected communities to assess existing gender gaps, women's means and access to livelihood resources, and the likely impact \nand opportunities of the Project on women. Accordingly, equity measures will be developed to maximize project opportunities and \nbenefits to women. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  opportunities  for  poor  women  by  (i)  including  them  in  project  employment  and  construction  work,  (ii) \nfacilitating a gender responsive environment at the institutional level through awareness and training programs, and (iii) facilitating \ngroup-based  women's  empowerment  through  trainings  in  life-skills  development  and  income  generation.  Under  the  social \nmobilization  program,  particular  effort  will  be  made  to  promote  and  advocate  women's  involvement  in  project  planning  and \nimplementation.  Meetings  will  be  organized  for  women  at  times  that  are  convenient  for  them  given  their  many  household \nresponsibilities.  The  Project  will  address  access  needs  in  view  of  women's  priorities.  Supplementary  investments  will  have  a \nparticular  impact  on  women,  for  whom  access  to  local  facilities  is  very  importantly,  notably  drinking  water  supplies,  health \nsubposts, primary schools, and market buildings. Supplementary projects exclusively benefiting women and disadvantaged caste \nand ethnic groups will be given priority. \n \nThe Project will address existing gender gaps by mandating (i) 50% of the building group members be women; (ii) 50% of women \nbe  represented  in  district  and  village  infrastructure  coordination  committees  and  village  infrastructure  user  groups,  as  well  as  in \n\n \n\n\f70 \n \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nleadership positions within the building groups; (iii) at least 50% women be targeted in livelihood interventions and related training \nprograms.  Proportional  representation  of  women  from  all  caste,  ethnic,  and  minority  groups  will  be  ensured  in  building  groups, \nvillage infrastructure user groups, and district implementation support teams. The Project will ensure that the social planning and \nimplementation team will have gender and development experience and at least 33% of the project staff be women from diverse \ncaste and ethnic groups. \n \nGender  sensitivity  training  will  be  provided  at  both  project  management  and  institutions.  All  project-related  training  will  have  a \ngender  module.  Women  and  the  disadvantaged  population  will  be  given  extra  training  to  build  their  leadership  skills  and \nconfidence  to  penetrate  elite  capture  and  increase  their  bargaining  power.  For  contract  work,  an  appropriate  clause  will  be \nestablished  to  ensure  wage  equality  and  appropriate  facilities  (day-care  centers)  to  enable  women  to  participate  actively  in \nconstruction work and to avoid being allocated the hardest or dirtiest construction tasks. Equipment for construction work will be \nprioritized  for  women  so  they  can  be  employed  immediately.  Women-only  building  groups  will  be  formed  to  enhance  their \nparticipation. Women will not be confined to unskilled construction  work, they will be provided with necessary training to develop \ntheir  capacity  to  do  skilled  work.  On-site  gender  sensitive  training  will  include  awareness  programs  on  reproductive  health  and \nsexually transmitted diseases, and protective measures will be applied to ensure safety and security of women workers.  \n \nWomen-only  self-help  groups  will  be  formed  to  target  livelihood  enhancement  skills  training  specific  to  women's  needs  and \npriorities and to develop their capacity to manage the Project independently. Savings and credit training will be introduced in self-\nhelp groups to help women maintain control of their earnings from construction work and gain a degree of independence. A group-\nbased  approach  to  empowerment  activities  will  be  promoted  through  trainings  in  life-skills  development  and  income  generation. \nMicroenterprise development training will be provided for productive investment of individual and group savings. To avoid confining \nwomen  to  stereotyped  occupations,  the  Project  will  encourage  them  to  participate  in  life-skills  and  income  generation  programs \nthat have been traditionally dominated by men. To ensure women's regular income after project completion, they will be trained for \nmaintenance work (length workers). At least 50% of maintenance employment will be reserved for women.  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nA gender action plan was developed for the Project. The Project\u2019s executing and implementing agencies, assisted by consultants, \nwill implement and monitor the plan during project implementation.  \n\nYes. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nE.

If a subproject involves any land \nacquisition/resettlement, an appropriate \nresettlement plan will be prepared, publicly \ndisclosed to those affected, and submitted to the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) in accordance to \nthe resettlement framework and ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). All involuntary land \nacquisition will be compensated and those affected \nassisted. The required compensation will be \ncompleted before award of civil works contracts, \nwhile other rehabilitation activities will continue \nduring project construction. The Department of \nLocal Infrastructure Development and Agricultural \nRoads (DOLIDAR) will submit semiannual progress \nreports on resettlement plan implementation. \n \nWhile the Project will allow voluntary donation of \nland in building rural infrastructure that provides \ndirect benefits to the community, adequate \nsafeguards will be built in resettlement plans to \nensure that the donation is unforced and the poor \npeople are not asked for donations. The \nsafeguards include (i) full consultation with affected \npeople on site selection; (ii) voluntary donations do \nnot severely affect those affected (i.e., they do not \nfall below the poverty line and lose >20% \nlandholding);  \n(iii) voluntary donation will be confirmed through a \n\n \n\n\fItem \n\nSignificant/ Not \nSignificant/ None \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nPlan Required \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n71\n\nAffordability \n\nNone \n\nLabor  \n\nNot significant \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\nSignificant  \n\nIndigenous peoples framework for \nthe Project; and an indigenous \npeoples development plan for one \ncore subproject. \n\n \n \n \n \n\nwritten record, including a \"no coercion\" clause \nverified by an independent third party; and (iv) a \ngrievance redress mechanism is in place.  \n \nThere is no affordability issue. \n \n\nThe Project will increase income-earning \nopportunities for women and men, and reduce the \nneed for male migration.

The improved road network is \nexpected to augment access of indigenous \ncommunities to various services, including health, \neducation, and market opportunities. Inclusive \nmeasures are included in the project design to \nmaximize project benefits and opportunities to \nindigenous groups through mainstreaming and \ntargeted approaches.  \n\nAmong five core subprojects studied under the \nproject preparatory technical assistance, only one \nsubproject in Kabre district was noted to have f \nindigenous people who might experience \nsignificant positive impacts from project \nimplementation. An indigenous people \ndevelopment plan was prepared for this subproject \nto maximize benefits to the indigenous people, \nincluding (i) employment of at least one member \nfrom each affected indigenous household in project \nconstruction and maintenance work; and (ii) at \nleast one member from each indigenous household \nto participate in livelihood enhancement activities \n(skills training, income generation, awareness \nraising in health/sanitation, and other life-skills \nimprovement). It also includes supplementary \ninfrastructure facilities (e.g., drinking water) in the \nindigenous people settlements. Preference will be \ngiven to indigenous people in the recruitment of \ncommunity facilitators, who will maintain frontline \ncontact with indigenous communities when \nimplementing the indigenous people development \nplan as well as overall subproject activities.  \n\nAn indigenous peoples framework was prepared \nfor the Project to provide policy and procedures to \nscreen subproject impacts on indigenous people \nand prepare planning documents during project \nimplementation in full compliance with ADB\u2019s Policy \non Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \n\nPotential risks include political instability, weak \ncapacity of local nongovernment organizations and \nconsultants, delays in decentralization, and \ninadequate interagency coordination.  \n\n \n\nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n\nNot significant \n\n \n\n\f72 \n \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nGENDER ACTION PLAN \n \n\nResponsible \n\nIndicators and Targets \n\nUpdated data disaggregated by gender, caste, \nethnicity, and minority groups is obtained within \n9 months of the start of the Project.
