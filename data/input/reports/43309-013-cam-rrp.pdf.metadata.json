The  project  also \nsupports  road  design  and  planning  for  climate  resilience  and  disaster  management,  including \nemergency  preparedness,  mitigation,  and  response.  The  feasibility  study  for  the  project  was \nprepared through an Asian Development Bank (ADB) TA to the government.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  project  will  rehabilitate  the  pavement  of  about  157  kilometers  (km)  of  roads  in \nKampong  Chhnang,  Kampong  Speu,  Prey  Vang,  and  Svay  Rieng  provinces.  The  rehabilitation \nprogram  will  provide  a  safer,  climate-resilient,  and  cost-effective  provincial  road  network  with  all-\nyear  access  to  markets  and  other  social  services  for  provincial  centers  of  southeastern  and \nmidwestern  Cambodia.  A  new  cross-border  facility  (CBF)  will  be  constructed  at  Prey  Var,  Svay \nRieng to facilitate efficient cross-border transport and trade between Cambodia and Viet Nam. The \nproject  will  support  a  sustainable  road  maintenance  regime,  community-based  road  safety \nmeasures,  an  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  prevention  program  (HHTPP),  climate-resilient \nmeasures, and efficient project management in the MPWT. \n \n4. \nRoads  are  the  principal  mode  of  transportation  in  Cambodia.  The  road  network  of \napproximately  39,600  km  includes  (i)  about  2,100  km  of  national  roads  (primary  national \nhighways),  (ii)  about  9,500  km  of  provincial  roads  (secondary  national  highways),  and  (iii)  about \n28,000 km of rural roads. The MPWT manages the national and provincial roads, and the Ministry \nof Rural Development manages the rural roads. \n \n5. \nThe  remote  rural  economy  is  becoming  increasingly  dependent  on  an  improved  national \nroad  network.  However,  the  provincial  road  network  that  connects  remote  areas\u2014which  have  a \npaved road ratio of 11%\u2014is continuing to deteriorate because of the rapid growth in traffic, lack of \nmaintenance  financing,  and  poor  road  maintenance  standards  and  practices.  For  example,  the \nNational Road (NR) 13 that links NRs 1 and 8 in  a north\u2013south direction and NR 314D that links \nNR  1  with  the  CBF  at  Prey  Var,  Svay  Rieng  are  both  deteriorating.4 Although  vital  for  transport \nwithin  the  Prey  Vang  and  Svay  Rieng  provinces,  and  to  cross-border  transport  and  trade,  these \nroads are unpaved and do not provide all-year accessibility.  \n                                                \n1  Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Provincial Roads Improvement Project. Manila \n\n(TA 7665-CAM). \n\n4  As noted in para. 4, provincial roads (secondary national highways) in Cambodia are labeled as national roads with a \n\n2- and 3-digit numbering system; the primary national highways are labeled using a single digit system. \n\n \n\n\f6. \nTo  enhance  regional  transport  and  trade  activities  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion \ncorridors, Cambodia acceded to the Greater Mekong Subregion Cross-Border Transport Agreement \nin  November  2001.  One  of  the  initiatives  to  implement  the  agreement  in  Cambodia  was  the  pilot \nimplementation of a CBF at Bavet through a bilateral agreement between Cambodia and Viet Nam in \n2003.  On  17  March  2009,  the  two  governments  agreed  to  expand  the  quota  of  vehicles  for  cross-\nborder  transport  from  40  to  150.  Since  the  current  CBF  at  Prey  Var,  Svay  Rieng  has  insufficient \ncapacity,  the  planned  CBF  will  supplement  cross-border  transport  and  trade  with  Viet  Nam  in \nsoutheastern Cambodia. The project will also benefit from the ongoing transport and trade facilitation \nregional TA5 through workshops for improving CBF operations. \n \n7. \nBecause  of  relatively  rapid  economic  development,  overloading  of  cargo  vehicles  has \nbecome  a  severe  cause  of  road  damage  in  Cambodia  since  2005.  This  is  a  major  issue  for \nprovincial  roads  because  of  overloaded  trucks  that  haul  agricultural  products  and  carry  quarry \nmaterials. ADB is currently supporting an axle load control program for national roads; this project \nwill  expand  that  support  to  provincial  roads,  enhance  current  weigh  station  facilities,  and  provide \nnew facilities. \n \nCambodia has one of the highest incidences of road accidents in the world with 10 fatalities \n8. \nper  10,000  vehicles  in  2010.  This  is  a  44%  decrease  from  2007  but  still  represents  one  of  the \nhighest  accident  rates  in  Southeast  Asia.  Thus,  road  safety  continues  to  be  a  major  concern, \nespecially with the growth of traffic in provincial and rural areas. In line with the national programs \nfor  road  safety  and ADB's  ongoing road safety  support  through  the  MPWT, the  project  will  assist \nthe  MPWT  in  designing  and  managing  a  community-based  road  safety  program  for  the  project \nprovinces. \n \nGiven  the  natural  disasters  that  Cambodia  has  faced  since  2000  (particularly  frequent \n9. \nflooding during wet seasons), it is essential to address climate change. Recognizing this, the project \nwill rehabilitate, to paved condition, a provincial road section of 69.6 km in Kampong Chhnang and \nKampong Speu provinces to improve its climate resilience.6 The road section is a priority in terms of \nrural access, and flooding has been a persistent problem. The climate resilience measures include \nclimate-resilient  road  designs,  hazard  mapping,  tree  planting,  and  plans  for  water  capture  and \nstorage, disaster preparedness, mitigation, and response. \n \nThe government's  poverty  reduction  strategy for 2009\u20132013  (the  Rectangular  Strategy for \n10. \nGrowth,  Employment,  Equity  and  Efficiency,  Phase  II)  emphasizes  generating  economic  growth \nthrough  the  private  sector,  with  rehabilitation  and  development  of  the  country's  physical \ninfrastructure  as  a  necessary  precondition.7 The  project  supports  this  strategy,  particularly  as  it \nenhances  connectivity,  balanced  economic  development,  access  to  social  services  and  cross-\nborder transport, and trade in remote areas of southeastern and midwestern Cambodia. \n \nThe  overarching  objective  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS),  2011\u201320138 for \n11. \nCambodia is poverty reduction in line with the government\u2019s socioeconomic development priorities. \nProject  design  has  incorporated  lessons  learned  in  the  areas  of  procurement,  governance, \nresettlement,  policy  formulation,  loan  covenants,  and  axle  load  control.  In  procurement,  post-\nqualification of contractors will contribute to greater efficiency of civil works. Good governance will \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2010.

For resettlement, ADB will conduct frequent reviews and due \ndiligence, affected  people  will  be  consulted  at  all  stages  to  ensure timely  provision  of  information \non  the  process  and  entitlements. This  approach increases the  awareness  of  affected  people and \nreduces disagreements and disputes regarding compensation. Policy formulation and related loan \ncovenants  are  designed  to  be  realistic  and  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  executing  agency. \nRegarding  axle  load  control,  frequent  reviews,  detailed  due  diligence,  and  close  monitoring  are \nessential to support transparent, effective, and sustainable operations. ADB's operational priorities \non  climate  change  include  sustainable  transport  initiatives  and  promoting  climate  resilient \ndevelopment.  The  proposed  project  is  in  line  with  these  priorities  and  is  aligned  with  the  climate \nchange  implementation  plan  developed  for  Southeast  Asia.9 Also,  the  project\u2019s  climate  resilience \nmeasures will bring significant benefits to the rural communities.  \n \nThe CPS includes four road sector projects in the program, all of which are consistent with \n12. \nthe  sector  assistance  program  evaluation10 recommendation  to  shift  focus  towards  rehabilitating \nprovincial  and  rural  roads,  rather  than  national  roads.  ADB  approved  the  first  provincial  road \nproject in 2009.11 This project, which has incorporated lessons learned from past interventions in its \ndesign,  would  be  the  second. 12 ADB  approved  the  first  rural  road  project  in  2010,  which  will \nimprove the rural poor\u2019s access to services. A second rural road project is programmed for 2013.13 \n \n13. \nThe  geographic  focus  of  ADB\u2019s  rural  livelihood  efforts  has  been  the  Tonle  Sap  Basin\u2014\nhome to a large proportion of Cambodia's rural poor\u2014in the midwest. This project\u2019s geographical \nfocus  is  on  Kampong  Chhnang  and  Kampong  Speu  in  the  Tonle  Sap  Basin  and  Prey  Vang  and \nSvay Rieng in the southeast. Although outside ADB\u2019s traditional geographic focus, Prey Vang has \na  poverty  level  of  37%  and  Svay  Rieng  has  a  poverty  level  of  36%  (the  national  poverty  level  is \n35%).  The  southeastern  project  provinces  fit  well  geographically  with  the  southern  economic \ncorridor of the Greater Mekong Subregion as feeder routes. The roads and the CBF also align well \nwith the government\u2019s rice and rubber production and export strategy for this area. \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe  impact  of the  project  is  improved  access  to markets,  jobs,  and  social  services in four \nproject  provinces.  This  impact  is  consistent  with  the  sector  results  framework  of  the  Cambodia \nTransport  Sector  Assessment,  Strategy,  and  Roadmap.14 The  outcome  of  the  project  is  a  safe, \nclimate-resilient,  and  cost-effective  road  network  that  provides  all-year  access  in  the  agricultural \nareas of the project provinces. \n \nC. \n \n15. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project includes five outputs: \n(i) \n\nCivil  works.

This output includes detailed design \nand implementation supervision (DDIS) consulting services and land acquisition and \nresettlement required for the project roads and the CBF.  \nRoad  asset  management.  The  project  will  improve  road  asset  management  by \ncontrolling axle load at strategic locations on national and provincial roads, thereby \nexpanding  and  improving  the  MPWT\u2019s  ongoing  axle  load  control  program.  Recent \ninterventions  by  ADB  to  install  and  operate  permanent  weighbridges  at  seven  key \nlocations in the country, as well as the establishment of a permanent axle overload \ncontrol  committee  in  the  MPWT,  have  reduced  overloading.  The  continued \ninterventions, through the expansion of existing weigh stations and the provision of \nnew weigh stations, will contribute to further reduction in overloading. \nRoad safety and safeguards. Road safety will be increased and social safeguards \nwill be implemented through (a) a community-based road safety awareness program \nin  line  with  the  national  program,  (b)  an  HHTPP,  and  (c)  a  sex-disaggregated \nbaseline socioeconomic survey of beneficiaries.  \nClimate  resilient  roads. 15 The  project  will  result  in  a  more  climate  resilient  road \nnetwork by assessing the vulnerability of the MPWT road network to climate change \nimpacts  with  a  view  to  improving  adaptation  planning  and  introducing  ecosystem-\nbased adaptation strategies. The output will also develop emergency management \nplanning  for  project  roads  and  plan  water  capture  and  storage  systems.  Climate \nchange  impacts  will  be  reduced  by  a  mixture  of  (a)  design  adjustments  to  civil \nworks,  (b)  hazard  mapping,  (c)  bioengineering  and  other  ecosystem-based \nmeasures,  and  (d)  infrastructure  policy  and  planning  activities.  In  addition,  a \ncommunity-based emergency management intervention will be piloted in Kampong \nChhnang  province,  with  the  participation  of  Red  Cross  to  sustain  the  emergency \nmedical facilities. \nStrengthened  internal  capacity.

The  department  is  not  equipped  to  undertake  these \ntasks  effectively  and  needs  to  strengthen  its  human  resource  base  and  reform  its  organizational \nstructure  and  procedures.  An  associated  capacity  development  TA 18  is  proposed  to  assist \nstrengthening the department in the first of a three-stage process. The first stage is diagnostics of \nthe department\u2019s need to restructure, develop staff capabilities, and modernize internal processes \nto  increase  efficiency.  The  diagnostic  assessment  will  be  followed  by  a  separate  TA  for  detailed \nplanning of interventions that address issues of road safety, traffic regulation, vehicle registration, \nlegislation,  and  long-term  planning.  These  interventions  will  be  designed  to  enable  various \ndevelopment partners to provide assistance for implementation. The early reform stage will include \nassistance to restructure the department, develop in-house staff capacities, support recruitment of \nstaff with new skills, and implement priority interventions as identified in the second stage. \n \n                                                \n18 Technical Assistance: Supporting Strengthening and Institutional Reform for the Department of Land Transport of the \n\nMinistry of Public Works and Transport (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f21. \nThe TA, to be implemented over a 12-month period, is estimated at $550,000 equivalent. It \nwill  be  financed  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  resources  for  $500,000  (from  TA  Special  Funds-IV).  The \ngovernment  will  fund  $50,000  equivalent  to  cover  office  accommodation  and  communications, \ncounterpart staff support, and other administrative expenses. ADB will recruit an international firm \nin  cooperation  with  national  consultants  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  (80:20  ratio  and \nsimplified  technical  proposal)  to  provide  approximately  15  international  and  20  national  person-\nmonths of consulting inputs. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nGovernance \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n22. \nThe  improvement  of  provincial  roads  under  the  project  will  serve  about  700,000  project \nbeneficiaries, the vast majority of whom are the rural poor. The approach used to evaluate the project \nfollows  the  standard  practice  of  comparing  the  life-cycle  costs  of  the  road  agency  and  road  users, \nwith and without the project. The economic internal rate of return of the proposed project is 15.5%, \nand the economic internal rates of return for individual road sections are above 12%. \n \nB. \n \nADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained and discussed with \n23. \nthe  Government  of  Cambodia  and  the  MPWT.  This  policy  will  be  applied  throughout  project \nimplementation.  Apart  from  this,  a  good  governance  framework  (GGF)  was  developed  in \ncoordination with the government.19 The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nto ensure good governance are described in the PAM. The GGF will be posted on the MPWT and \nADB websites. The review missions will monitor compliance with their provisions and requirements \nclosely.  The  financial  management  assessment  that  was  carried  out  confirms  that  the  executing \nagency,  including  the  implementing  agency,  has  adequate  financial  management  capacity  to \nimplement the project. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nThe  project\u2014categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming\u2014will  significantly  benefit  the \nrural  poor,  including  women  and  children,  living  in  the  project  provinces.  Local  economic \ndevelopment  depends  on  improved  connectivity,  and  paved  provincial  roads  will  reduce  travel \ntimes,  increase  convenience,  and make  it  safer  for  women  and girls  to travel  farther  from  home. \nBetter  accessibility  will  improve  rural  health  and  educational  attainment.  Girls  will  have  a  better \nchance  of  attending  secondary  school,  markets  will  be  easier  to  reach,  and  \u2015buy  and  sell\u2016  job \nopportunities  for  women  will  increase.  Road  construction  and  maintenance  will  generate  jobs  for \nlocal  men  and  women,  and  provide  much-needed  cash  income.  The  project's  labor  and  gender \nmainstreaming  action  plan  will  ensure  that  contractors  give  priority  to  local  residents  for \nconstruction  and  road  maintenance  jobs,  and  ensure  that  men  and  women  benefit  equally,  with \nequal  pay  for  equal  work.  From  a  health  perspective,  rural  villages  will  benefit  from  a  significant \nreduction  in  dust,  which  is  linked  to  respiratory  disease\u2014a  major  cause  of  child  mortality  in \nCambodia.  Potentially  negative  social  impacts  of  increased  connectivity  will  be  monitored  and \nmitigated  through  HHTPP.  The  project  includes  a  community-based  road  safety  program  to \nincrease the safety of road users and local residents. \n \nD. \n \n25. \n                                                \n19 Good Governance Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nThe project has been classified as category B for involuntary resettlement. The project will \n\nSafeguards \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\frequire  approximately  24.4  hectares  of  land  within  the  existing  right-of-way  of  the  various  roads \nand 2.5 hectares of privately owned land for the Prey Var CBF. The land that will be used in the \nroad  right-of-way  will  affect  non-land  assets  of  an  estimated  936  households.  Of  the  566 \nhouseholds  that  experience  impacts  on  structures  (houses  and/or  shops),  all  will  be  partially \naffected or will otherwise be able to move back on remaining unaffected land beyond the corridor \nof  impact.  No  households  are  expected  to  require  relocation.  The  privately  owned  land  to  be \nacquired at the site of the CBF is farming land. A resettlement plan and a combined resettlement \nand  ethnic  minority  development  plan  have  been  prepared  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) to mitigate of all involuntary resettlement impacts. \n \n26. \nThe  project  has  been  classified  as  category  B  for  indigenous  peoples.  Potential  project \nactivity  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  in  the  project  areas  have  been  screened.  There  are \napproximately  3,000  ethnic  Cham  households  in  the  project  areas.  Consultations  during  project \npreparation  reveal  their  unanimous  support  for  the  project  with  the  typical  expected  benefits  to \ninclude  improved  access  to  services  as  well  as  livelihood  opportunities.  An  estimated  49  ethnic \nCham  and  5  ethnic  Vietnamese  households  will  be  affected  by  land  acquisition  within  the  road \nright-of-way. Most of the resettlement impacts will be temporary and require relocation to remaining \nunaffected  land  outside  the  corridor  of  impact.  Other  negative  impacts  are  the  generalized \nincreased  risks  of  HIV/AIDS  transmission,  human  trafficking,  and  road  accidents  associated  with \nthe  construction  and  operation  of  the  project.  The  specific  interests  of  the  indigenous  peoples \naffected  by  involuntary  resettlement  as  well  as  indigenous  peoples  communities  in  the  project \nareas  are  addressed  in  the  combined  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority  development  plan,  the \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  prevention  strategy,  and  the  LGAP  to  ensure  their  equitable \nparticipation  in  project  benefits  and  decision  making  and  that  adverse  impacts  are  effectively \nmitigated. \n \n27. \nThe  project  has  been  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  Results  of  the  initial \nenvironmental examination showed that only minor adverse environmental impacts are anticipated \nfor the improvement of project roads and implementation of small-scale climate change adaptation \nmeasures 20 for  surrounding  communities.  Such  impacts,  which  are  considered  short-term  and \ntemporary, will be experienced during construction mainly  because of elevated levels of dust and \nnoise, traffic disruption, and potential occupational and community health and safety risks, but they \ncan  be  mitigated.  None of  the  project  roads  are  located  near  culturally  protected  areas.  No  rare, \nthreatened,  or  endangered  species of flora and  fauna  have  been  found  in  or  close  to  the  project \narea. \n \n28. \nExcept for NR 53, none of the project roads are in close proximity to any protected areas of \necological  significance.  NR  53  runs  alongside  part  of  the  eastern  boundary  of  the  Phnom  Aural \nWildlife  Sanctuary  (PAWS)  for  approximately  6.5  km.  The  Provincial  Department  of  Environment \nconfirmed that NR 53 does not intrude into the PAWS. As with the other project roads, there are no \nforested areas in the vicinity of NR 53. The PAWS\u2019 zones close to NR 53 are the community and \nsustainable zones that are predominantly agricultural areas, while its conservation and core zones, \nat  the  nearest  points,  are  approximately  2  km  and  5  km,  respectively,  from  NR  53.  As  such,  no \nadverse environmental impacts are anticipated for all project roads on ecologically protected areas. \nTo avoid or mitigate negative impacts arising from the project, an environmental management plan \ndetailing  mitigation  measures,  monitoring  activities,  and  implementation  responsibilities  has  been \n                                                \n20 As part of the climate resilience of the project, the MPWT has been requested by commune officials and residents to \nfinance  improvements  to  the  following  community  resources  and  facilities:  (i)  water  capture  component  through \nextension  of  water  supply  distribution  pipes  to  houses  and  rehabilitation  of  water  storage  tanks;  (ii)  rehabilitation  of \nirrigation dams, spillways, and canals; and (iii) dredging certain shallow areas of Boeung Skeat Lake in Chao Maong \ncommune to enhance irrigation water supply source. Dredged materials, if suitable, will be used to widen the existing \nunpaved local road along the lake. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\frequirements, \n\nthe  MPWT  will  specify  details  of \n\nprepared  as  part  of  the  initial  environmental  examination.  Public  consultations  involving  affected \npeople and local officials were conducted during the initial environmental examination preparation \nin compliance with ADB information disclosure and consultation requirements through focus group \ndiscussions and individual interviews along all project roads. Environment was not seen as a major \nissue  by  those  interviewed.  To  ensure  that  the  project  is  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the \nthe \nenvironmental  management  plan \nimplementation  of  the  plan  in  the  bid  and  contract  documents  for  consulting  services  and  civil \nworks. The DDIS consultant will assist the MPWT in monitoring the environmental performance of \ncontractors. The DDIS consultant will also provide on-the-job training to the field personnel of the \nMPWT\u2019s Environment Safeguards Office to build their capacity in environmental management and \nmonitoring. \n \nE. \n \n29. \nGiven  the  procurement  management  problems  that  other  development  partners  have  had \nwith the MPWT in the past, there is a need to establish risk mitigation measures. The preliminary \nassessment  during  the  project  feasibility  TA  identified  the  three  major  risks  during  project \nimplementation  to  be  related  to  procurement,  corruption,  and  due  diligence.  ADB  will  conduct \nintensive project reviews to mitigate all three risks effectively. The GGF is also expected to reduce \nprocurement  and  corruption  risks  while  close  coordination  with  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and \nFinance is expected to reduce corruption and due diligence risks. Risks and mitigating measures \nare described in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nProcurement  \n \nCorruption \n \nDue diligence  For  due  diligence,  conduct  intensive  project  reviews  and  closely  coordinate  with  the \n\nMitigation Measures \nFor  procurement,  intensive  project  reviews,  closely  coordinate  with  the  MEF  and \nimplement actions required under the GGF \nFor corruption, implement the GGF to strengthen internal controls, conduct intensive \nproject reviews and coordinate closely with the MEF \n\nMEF \n\nGGF = good governance framework, MEF = Ministry of Economy and Finance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n30. \nImplementation  of  the  project  will  conform  to  ADB's  mandatory  policies  on  anticorruption, \nprocurement,  consulting  services,  due  diligence,  safeguards,  and  disbursement  as  described  in \ndetail in the PAM. The government and the MPWT have given the following assurances, in addition \nto the standard assurances that are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\nWithin 1 year of the loan effectiveness, the government will approve the updates of \nthe  National  Comprehensive  Axle  Load  Control  Program  in  a  form  acceptable  to \nADB.  The  program  will  provide  systematic  policy,  strategy,  and  planning  for  the \nMPWT\u2019s  nation-wide  axle  control  and  complaint  handling  for  axle  load  control \nactivities. \nUnless  otherwise  agreed  by  ADB,  within  2  years  of  the  loan  effectiveness,  the \ngovernment  will  have  reorganized  the  existing  National  Axle  Overload  Control \nCommittee  to  ensure  a  more  inclusive  environment  for  Cambodia's  axle  load \ncontrol,  provided,  however,  that  the  Road  Law  will  have  been  promulgated  in  a \ntimely manner. \n                                                \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n(ii) \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  government  ensures  that  within  1  year  of  the  loan  effectiveness,  appropriate \nprocedures  for  axle  load  control,  that  are  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  be  in  place  and \nthat all axle control activities within the country, including those using portable weigh \nscales,  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  these  procedures.  Such  procedures \nwill  comprise  (a)  the  existing  technical  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  (b)  a  good \ngovernance  system  applicable  to  axle  load  control  activities,  and  (c)  technical \nguidance of such activities by PMU3 within the MPWT. \nAgreement among ADB, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and the MPWT will \nbe  reached  on  the  final  GGF  prepared  during  project  processing.  The  MPWT  will \nimplement this effectively during the entire project period. \n\n \n31. \nIn addition  to  the standard  requirements  of  ADB's  public  disclosure policy,  the  MPWT will \npublicly  disclose  on  its  website  activities,  such  as  local  procurement  information,  in  order  to \nincrease public awareness on its good governance practices. \n \n32. \nThe  effectiveness  of  the  loan  is  conditional  upon  (i)  the  agreement  reached  between  the \nMinistry  of  Economy  and  Finance  and  the  MPWT  regarding  arrangements  to  finance  the \noperational  cost  of  axle  load  control  stations,  and  (ii)  the  redefined  and  expanded  functions  of \nPMU3 to provide technical guidance and internal audits that are acceptable to ADB. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n33. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  the \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR33,008,000  to  the  Kingdom  of \nCambodia for the Provincial Roads Improvement Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  for  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board; \nthe administration by ADB of a loan not exceeding the equivalent of $10,000,000 to \nthe  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Provincial  Roads  Improvement  Project  to  be \nprovided by the Strategic Climate Fund; and \nthe administration by ADB of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $7,000,000 to \nthe  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Provincial  Roads  Improvement  Project  to  be \nprovided by the Strategic Climate Fund. \n\n \n25 November 2011 \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n10 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nImproved \naccess to \nmarkets, jobs, \nand social \nservices in four \nproject \nprovinces  \n(Kampong \nChhnang, \nKampong \nSpeu, Prey \nVeng, and \nSvay Rieng) \n\n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance Targets and Indicators with \nBaselines \n\n \nVolume of motorcycle and passenger car \ntraffic on project roads increases by 50% \nfrom 2012 to 2019. \n \nBy 2019, in Kampong Chhnang, Kampong \nSpeu, Prey Vang, and Svay Rieng provinces: \n \n(i)  economic activity rate of 80% (ages15\u2013\n64, both sexes) increases to 83%; \n\n(ii)  enrolment in primary school increases \nfrom 90% to 95% in project districts of \nKampong Chhnang, from 94% to 98% in \nprojects districts of Svay Rieng, from \n89% to 94% in the Thpong district of \nKampong Speu, and from 91% to 96% in \nthe Kamchay Mear district of Prey Veng; \nand \n\n \n(iii)  maternal mortality rate (deaths within 1 \n\nmonth per 100,000 live births) decreases \nfrom 350 to 225 in project districts of \nSvay Rieng, from 500 to 375 in project \ndistricts of Kampong Chhnang, from 179 \nto 54 in the Thpong district of Kampong \nSpeu, and from 305 to 180 in the \nKamchay Mear district of Prey Veng. \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \nThe MPWT\u2019s annual \nreports baseline traffic \ndata \n \n \n \n\nCambodia\u2019s demographic \nand health survey \n \nThe MOE\u2019s education \nmanagement information \nsystems \n\nCambodia\u2019s \ndemographic and health \nsurvey  \n\n \nAverage travel times on project roads \ndecrease by 25% from 2012 to 2017 \n \nShare of the paved provincial road network \nincreases from 11% in 2010 to 12% in 2017 \n\n \nThe MPWT\u2019s field traffic \nsurveys \n \nThe MPWT\u2019s provincial \nand national trade \nstatistics and annual \nreports \n \n\nOutcome \nSafe, climate-\nresilient, and \ncost-effective \nroad network \nthat provides \nall-year access \nin the \nagricultural \nareas of the \nproject \nprovinces \n\n \n\nOutputs \n1.
