The project will assist Solomon Islands Electricity Authority (SIEA) in \ninstalling hydropower generation to replace diesel generation in the third-largest load center in \nSolomon Islands, and extend the distribution grid to peri-urban households. This will be the first \nutility-scale renewable energy project in Solomon Islands.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nIslands \n\nin  Solomon \n\ninfrastructure \n\nEconomic  development  and  provision  of \n\n3. \nis \nconcentrated in the national capital of Honiara, which has about 13% of the national population \nbut 89% of the country\u2019s power generation capacity. In contrast, the province of Malaita, with a \npopulation  of  137,596  (about  25%  of  the  national  population),  has  only  about  2%  of  total \ngeneration  capacity.  Generation  by  SIEA,  the  state-owned  utility,  provides  power  only  to  the \nmain  provincial  center  of  Auki,  entirely  through  diesel  plants  at  high  cost.  Power  tariffs  in \nSolomon  Islands  are  among  the  highest  in  the  Pacific. 3 Power  provision  is  unreliable  and \nmarked by frequent outages due to diesel fuel supply and maintenance issues. Auki is SIEA\u2019s \nthird-largest load center with 274 residential customers and 335 commercial customers.4 \n \n4.  \nOnly  about  3%  of the  population  of  Malaita has  access to grid-connected power.  More \nthan  three-quarters  of  households  in  Malaita  use  kerosene  lamps  as  their  main  source  of \nlighting and nearly all use wood for cooking. Other sources of energy include small home solar \nsystems, mini hydropower, portable generators, and gas.5 The main reasons for the low access \nrates are (i) the high cost of diesel power generation in the provincial centers, which gives the \ncorporatized  SIEA  little  incentive  to  expand  the  distribution  network  (where  generation  and \nsupply  costs  exceed  the  national  tariff);  (ii)  lack  of  government  community  service  obligation \nfunding for grid extensions; (iii) a difficult geography and small, dispersed pockets of population, \nand (iv) low capacity to pay in some areas. Significant unmet demand means that people resort \nto  self-generation  but  would  connect  to  the  grid  if  sufficient  capacity  were  available.  The  high \ncost  of  electricity  and  the limited  reach of the  distribution grid  are  slowing  economic growth in \nthe provincial centers, including Auki, and curb agriculture and tourism in particular. \n \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2012.  Technical \nAssistance  to  the  Solomon  Islands  for  Preparation  of  the  Outer  Island  Renewable  Energy  Project.  Manila;  ADB. \n2009. Technical Assistance for the Promotion of Renewable Energy in the Pacific. Manila.  The latter helped SIEA \nscreen the provincial centers for priority renewable energy projects. \n\n3  In June 2013, the national uniform tariff was $0.85 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for residential customers and $0.91/kWh \nfor  commercial  customers.  By  comparison,  the  average  domestic  tariff  across  21  Pacific  utilities  in  2011  was \n$0.46/kWh (Pacific Power Association. 2013. Performance Benchmarking Report for Pacific Power Utilities. Suva).  \n\n4  The Auki grid has an installed rated capacity of 720 kilowatts (kW) and a peak demand of 350 kW. \n5  Government of Solomon Islands, Solomon Islands National Statistics Office. 2011. Report on 2009 Population and \n\nHousing Census. Honiara. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe proposed project will assist SIEA in constructing the Fiu River hydropower plant and \n5.  \nextending the distribution grid to peri-urban households. Hydropower has been assessed to be \nthe  least-cost  baseload  generation  option  for  Auki.  More  hydropower  generation  from  the  Fiu \nRiver hydropower plant will benefit the economy by (i) reducing fossil fuel imports; (ii) lowering \nthe cost of power generation, which will ease the pressure on power tariffs and thereby reduce \ncommercial and household expenditure; (iii) improving energy security, and (iv) minimizing tariff \nvolatility  by  partially  converting  the  national  grid  to  renewable  energy.6 The  use  of  renewable \nenergy  also  reduces  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  which  contribute  to  global  warming. \nConstruction  of  hydropower  plants  to  replace  diesel  generation  will  significantly  lower  SIEA\u2019s \ncost  of  generating  power  for  the  Auki  grid,  and  create  a  direct  incentive  to  extend  the  grid. \nProvision  of  externally  tendered  operation  and  maintenance  contracts,  including  capacity \ndevelopment  of  SIEA  technical  staff,  will  improve  the  quality  of  power  supply  (by  reducing \noutages)  in  Auki,  which  will  encourage  economic  development.  Recent  attempts  by  SIEA  to \nextend  the  distribution  grid  to  peri-urban  areas  around  Auki  were  hampered  by  land  access \nissues.  SIEA  has  therefore  developed  a  focused  distribution  expansion  plan.  The  project \nsupports this expansion plan, which will almost double SIEA\u2019s residential customer base in Auki. \nThe  grid  extension  will  directly  benefit  new  peri-urban  customers  by  (i)  replacing  kerosene \nlighting  with  a  cheaper  form  of  energy,  thereby  freeing  household  expenditure;  (ii)  enabling \nhousehold  income  generation;  (iii)  improving  children\u2019s  education;  and  (iv)  reducing  indoor \nhealth  and  safety  issues  associated  with  burning  kerosene.  Project  benefits  will  be  extended \nthrough employment of landowners during the construction period. \n \n6. \nThe government manages sector policy through the energy unit of the Ministry of Mines, \nEnergy  and  Rural  Electrification,  and  power  tariffs  are  set  by  government  regulations.  SIEA  is \ncurrently  completing  a  utility  restructuring  program  supported  by  the  World  Bank.7 Historically, \nelectricity  tariffs  were  too  low  for  full  cost  recovery,  resulting  in  a  lack  of  maintenance  and \nunderinvestment  in  capital  infrastructure.  The  rates  have  recently  been  increased  to  allow  full \ncost recovery, and SIEA is carrying out a broad maintenance program to rehabilitate its assets. \nHistorically,  revenue  collection  has  also  been  an  issue,  but  since  2012  SIEA  has  made  an \nambitious effort to install prepayment meters for all consumers in parallel with an overhaul of the \nbilling, accounting, and data management systems. Revenue collection is currently high at 97%. \nSIEA  is  also  partially  compensated  for  community  service  obligation  activities  through  direct \nbudget transfer by the government.  \n \n7.  \nSolomon  Islands  has  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support  to  develop \npower supply to provincial centers based on renewable energy. The project is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 and the country operations business plan (2014\u22122016) \nas  a  2013  project. 8  The  country  partnership  strategy  supports  Solomon  Islands\u2019  National \nDevelopment  Strategy,  2011\u20132020,  which  prioritizes  development  of  reliable  and  affordable \npower  supply  to  urban  centers  from  renewable  energy  and  the  expansion  of  access  to \nelectricity. The project is included as a priority investment in the Solomon Islands Infrastructure \nInvestment Plan.9 It also supports Solomon Islands\u2019 National Energy Policy Framework, 200710 \n\n                                                \n6  Solomon Islands has national power tariffs that also apply to the Auki grid. A reduction in generation costs for the \n\nAuki grid from the project will put downward pressure on overall national tariffs.  \n\n7  The World Bank\u2019s Solomon Islands Sustainable Energy Project supported capacity building for utility management, \n\nfinancial management, and asset management as well as tariff analysis to ensure full cost recovery. \n\n8   ADB. 2012.

This  involves  constructing  a  750-kilowatt  (kW)13 \nrun-of-river  hydropower  plant,  including  (a)  a  3.5-kilometer  (km)  access  road, \n(b) a 9.7 km distribution line (11 kilovolts), (c) an intake structure, (d)  a 1.55 km \nheadrace canal, (e) a 250-meter steel penstock, and (f) a powerhouse. The Fiu \nRiver hydropower plant will almost entirely displace diesel generation in Auki.14 \nDistribution  grid  extension.  This  includes  extending  the  grid  to  an  estimated \nadditional 250 households, which will increase SIEA\u2019s customer base in Auki by \n91%.  The  project  will  finance  step-down  transformers,  distribution  lines,  house \nconnections, and provision of minimum supply kits, including prepayment meters. \nCapacity  building.  This  consists  of  (a)  training  SIEA  staff  in  the  operation  of \nhydropower  plants  through  a  3-year  outsourced  operation  and  maintenance \ncontract  and  (b)  training  newly  connected  households  on  options  for  electricity-\nbased income generation, electricity safety, and household budget management. \nEfficient  project  management  services.  This  involves  establishing  a  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) that will provide efficient technical design, management, \nand supervision services.  \n\n \nD. \n \n10. \n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $15.0 million (Table 1). \n\n                                                \n11 Government of Solomon Islands, Ministry of Mines, Energy and Rural Electrification. 2013.

Another 250 kW generator will be fit into \nthe spare generator bay once load growth increases. Installation of two 250 kW generators has been analyzed as \nthe most efficient extent to meet the current 350 kW peak as well as anticipated short-term demand growth.  \n\n14 The hydropower plant has a design flow of 1.2 m3/s which is available 85% of the time and yields a plant factor of \n94%.

The \nloan will have a 32-year fixed term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan,  grant,  and  project  agreements.  The  government  has \nrequested a grant not exceeding $6 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance \nthe project. The government and SIEA will finance the remainder of the total project cost in the \namount  of  $3  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  and  land  acquisition  costs.  The  foreign \nexchange risk will be borne by  the government. From the proceeds of the Asian Development \nFund loan and grant, the government will relend $10,500,000 equivalent to SIEA and will make \n$1,500,000  equivalent  available  as  a  grant  in  local  currency  under  a  subsidiary  financing \nagreement  acceptable  to  ADB.15 The  relending  terms  will  include  (i)  interest  at  the  rate  of  4% \nper  annum  over  $6,000,000  equivalent  and  interest  at  the  rate  of  1%  per  annum  over \n$4,500,000 equivalent; and (ii) a repayment period of 20 years, inclusive of a grace period of 7 \nyears or until the project is completed, whichever comes earlier.16 The financing plan is in Table \n2.  \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \n\nSpecial Funds resources (loan) \nSpecial Funds resources (grant)  \n\nGovernment or Solomon Islands Electricity Authority \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nAmount ($ million) \n \n6.0 \n6.0 \n3.0 \n15.0 \n\nShare of Total (%) \n \n40.0 \n40.0 \n20.0 \n100.0 \n\n12. \nThe Ministry of Mines, Energy and Rural Electrification will be the executing agency for \nthe  project.

SIEA  will  provide  the  services  of  (i)  two  project  engineers,  (ii)  finance \nofficer,  and  (iii)  administrative  assistant,  as  required.  The  project  will  finance  additional \nconsultants, equipment, and office furnishings to support the PMU in implementing the outputs. \nConsulting  firms  will  be  engaged  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  with  a \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 (considered justified due to the technical complexity of the power grid \nupgrades). All consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for \nprocurement  of  all  civil  works  and  goods  contracts.  Procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). Solomon Islands has requested that ADB select the design and supervision consultants \non its behalf. The contract will be signed between the government and the selected consultant. \nAdditional financing for additional sites may be considered if the project is performing well. If so, \nadditional  project  preparation  financing  required  (in  areas  such  as  design,  safeguards,  and \ncapacity) will be sourced from the additional financing. A project steering committee will oversee \nimplementation,  monitor  progress,  and  provide  guidance  to  the  executing  agency.  The  project \nsteering committee will  meet at least quarterly and will be chaired by the energy ministry. The \nPMU will host the project steering committee and will act as the secretariat. \n \n13. \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  over  7.25  years,  including  a  3-year  operation  and \nmaintenance  period,  with  completion  estimated  by  30  September  2022.  To  expedite \nimplementation,  the  government  has  requested  advance  consultant  recruitment.  ADB  has \ninformed the government that approval of advance consultant recruitment does not commit ADB \nto  finance  the  project.

Analysis  has  been  completed  to  determine  the  optimum  technical \nconfiguration  for  all  components,  including  analysis  of  the  hydrology  of  alternative  river \ncatchments,  hydropower  turbine  size  configurations,  penstock  arrangements,  and  distribution \nconfigurations to maximize system efficiencies. The design was based on analysis of Solomon \nIslands\u2019  conditions  to  ensure  that  the  proposed  systems  are suitable for  local  conditions.  A  3-\nyear operation and maintenance contract will be financed through the project to ensure that the \nhydropower  plant  is  operated  and  maintained  sustainably  during  the  initial  period  and  that \ncapacity is transferred to SIEA staff to enhance long-term sustainability.

The  financial  viability  of  the  project  has  been \nassessed  comparing  the  FIRR  with  the  (real)  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC).  The \nWACC  to  the  government  is  1.1%,  which  is  lower  than  the  FIRR.  Following  the  State-Owned \nEnterprises Act (2007), the government will relend the funds to SIEA at quasi-commercial rates. \nConsidering  the  proposed  relending  terms  and  conditions,  the  real  WACC  to  SIEA  is  1.7%. \nSIEA\u2019s WACC also compared favorably with the FIRR. The economic internal rate of return for \nthe consolidated project is 12.9%. This compares favorably with the economic opportunity cost \nof  capital  of  12% recommended in  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for  the  Economic Analysis  of  Projects. A \nsensitivity analysis was conducted to account for potential increases in economic and financial \ncosts, as well as a reduction of economic and financial benefits.18 The financial rate of return is \nrobust  to  cost  increase  and  benefit  reduction.  The  Fiu  River  hydropower  plant  has  been \nassessed as the least-cost generation alternative for the Auki grid.19 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n16. \nFinancial  management.

A  procurement  capacity  assessment  was  completed for  SIEA. \n17. \nThe  assessment  found  that  SIEA  has  an  established  procurement  unit  with  considerable \nprocurement  experience;  however,  the  experience  is  largely  related  to  procurement  of  small \nequipment  packages.  SIEA  has  limited  experience  in  managing  larger  packages  or  with  ADB \nprocurement  systems.  Additionally,  SIEA  staff  have  limited  experience  with  hydropower \nprocurement or construction management of larger projects. Based on this risk evaluation, the \n\n                                                \n18 Financial and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 The  levelized  cost  of  energy  for  the  Fiu  River  hydropower  plant  is  $0.63/kWh, lower  than  the  levelized  cost  of \n\n20 In accordance with ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila; and ADB. 2009. Financial \n\nenergy for diesel generation of $0.80/kWh.  \n\nDue Diligence \u2013 A Methodology Note. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fPMU  will  include  international  expertise  to  (i)  train  SIEA  staff  in  procurement  processes  for \npreparation  and  management  of  larger  contracts,  particularly  engineer\u2013procure\u2013construct \ncontracts;  (ii)  manage  preparation  of  ADB  standard  bidding  documents;  and  (iii) provide \ninternational expertise to support construction supervision. \n \n18. \nPrivate  sector.  The  project  considered  options  to  involve  the  private  sector  in  project \ndevelopment. Private expertise will be engaged by incorporating an initial 3-year operation and \nmaintenance contract into project design. This will include capacity building for SIEA operational \nstaff.  \n \n19. \nAnticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  the  energy  ministry,  and  SEIA.  The  specific \npolicy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project  administration \nmanual and the legal agreements.21 \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n20. \nThe project design includes pro-poor or poverty reduction measures to manage poverty \nissues.  The  project's  poverty  reduction  measures  entail  engaging  low-income  households \n(including  landowners)  for  construction  works,  extension  of  the  distribution  grid  (including  to \npoor  households),  and  training  on  income-generating  activities.  The  project  will  comply  with \napplicable national labor laws and core labor standards, including but not limited to equal work \nfor  equal  pay  regardless  of  gender,  race  or  ethnicity,  and  excluding  child  labor.  The  poverty \nreduction measures will be implemented by the PMU, which will include a social specialist. The \nsocial  specialist  will  establish  a  monitoring  system  to  track  employment  opportunities  and \ntechnical training for local people, the poor, and vulnerable groups.  \n \n21. \nThe project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan has \nbeen developed based on gender analysis and community consultations, and includes specific \nmeasures related to the construction of the hydropower plant. Measures included in the gender \naction  plan  cover  (i)  women\u2019s  engagement  in  consultation  activities,  (ii)  provision  of  gender \nawareness  training  to  target  groups,  (iii)  training  of  women  on  how  to  participate  in  income-\ngenerating  activities,  (iv)  actions  to  encourage  women\u2019s  participation  in  project-related \ncontracts, and (v) collection of gender-related data for monitoring purposes. The gender action \nplan  has  been  linked  with  national  targets  for  women\u2019s  development  as  set  out  in  the \ngovernment\u2019s policy on gender equality and women\u2019s development. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\n22. \nEnvironment. The  project  has  been  classified  as  category  B for  environment following \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  An  initial  environmental  examination  has  been \nprepared and disclosed on the ADB website. The main potential environmental impacts will be \ncreated  by  construction  of  the  access  road,  plant  installation  at  intake  and  powerhouse  sites, \nand vegetation trimming along the low-voltage distribution line corridor. After updates in line with \nthe  detailed  design,  the  results  of  the  environmental  examination  will  be  integrated  into  the \nbidding  documents.  If  there  are  changes  to  the  scope  of  the  works,  the  PMU  will  compile  an \nupdated initial environmental examination and environmental management plan to be approved \nby ADB. As part of the assessment a climate change adaptation risk evaluation was conducted \nand  considered  in  the  preliminary  design  of  the  schemes,  and  the  findings  of  the  assessment \n\n                                                \n21 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fwill  be  integrated  into  the  detailed  design.  The  PMU  will  be  supported  by  environmental \nspecialists  (3  person-months  international  and  14  person-months  national)  to  ensure  capacity \nbuilding for SIEA, and implementation and monitoring of the environmental management plan. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project has been classified as \n23. \ncategory B for resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples following ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. The project will have land acquisition impacts that are not deemed significant. \nNo physical relocation or loss of income is expected from the implementation of the project. The \nhydropower  scheme  will  require  land  acquisition  of  about  11  hectares  of  customary  land  and \ntree  clearance  for  construction.  The  land  is  owned  by  nine  separate  clans  totaling  about \n600 persons.  A  draft  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  based  on  impact  assessment  and \nconsultations  with  affected  persons  during  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  Affected \npersons  will  be  further  consulted  during  the  detailed  design  and  implementation.  Information \nsuch  as  a  brochure  in  local  language  has  been  disseminated  to  affected  persons  and  local \nstakeholders.  The  resettlement  plan  has  been  endorsed  by  SIEA  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB \nwebsite. \n \n24.   SIEA will finalize the resettlement plan after the detailed design and ensure that affected \npersons  receive  their  compensation  before  the  start  of  civil  works  that  affect  land  or  property. \nSIEA  will  (i)  appoint  a  focal  person  for  land  issues;  (ii)  establish  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard  capacity  within  the  PMU,  including  social  safeguard  specialists;  and  (iii)  coordinate \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Land,  Housing  and  Survey,  provincial  government,  and  other  relevant \nagencies  to  implement  resettlement  activities.  The  project  will  support  the  strengthening  of \nSIEA\u2019s  social  safeguard  capacity,  including  recruiting  social  development  and/or  resettlement \nspecialists  (3  person-months  international  and  14  person-months  national)  and  conducting \ntrainings.  The  due  diligence  concluded  that  while  there  are  clans  in  the  project  area,  their \ninstitutions are not separate from mainstream society, and these groups are not vulnerable. As \nsociocultural  groups  need  to  be  both  \u201cdistinct\u201d  and  \u201cvulnerable\u201d  to  trigger  the  ADB  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  requirements  on  indigenous  peoples,  the  project  has  been  categorized  as \ncategory C and an indigenous peoples plan is therefore not required. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n\n25.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 22  The  risks  of  the  project  have  been \nassessed and the benefits are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisk \nDelays in land acquisition result in delays \nto construction. \n\nMitigating Measures \nLand acquisition issues have proved to be the largest single \nrisk to economic infrastructure development in Solomon \nIslands. Thus, (i) design work will not begin until land \nacquisition has been completed, (ii) the Malaita Provincial \nGovernment will take the lead on arranging consensus \namong the landowners, (iii) the PMU (through Malaita \nProvincial Government) will implement the stakeholder \nconsultation and participation plan, and (iv) the PMU \n(supported by international and national consultants) will \nensure that land issues are managed by following the \n\n                                                \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fRisk \n\nMitigating Measures \napproved resettlement plan. To mitigate the risk of SIEA not \nbeing able to supply the Auki grid, the project design \nassumes that 100% backup diesel generation will be \nmaintained at the existing Auki diesel-fueled power plant.  \n \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  O&M  =  operation  and  maintenance,  PMU  =  project  management  unit,  SIEA  = \nSolomon Islands Electricity Authority. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n26. \nThe  government  and  SIEA  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  project  administration  manual  and  loan  documents.
