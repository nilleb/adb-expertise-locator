The CARES Program will \nprovide budget support to help finance countercyclical development expenditures. This support \nwill  deliver  (i)  social  protection  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  (ii)  an  expanded  health  sector \nresponse  to  the  pandemic,  and  (iii)  a  pro-poor  fiscal  stimulus  package  to  ensure  recovery  in \ngrowth and employment.  \n \n3. \nThe  government  meets  all  the  access  criteria  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nCPRO under the Countercyclical Support Facility (Table 1 and Appendix 4). The Pakistan CARES \nProgram  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,  including  operational  priorities  on  addressing \nremaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality, \nstrengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity,  and  fostering  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration. 2  The  CARES  Program  will  also  help  implement  CAREC  2030, 3  and  ADB\u2019s \nOperational Plan for Integrated Disaster Risk Management 2014\u20132020.4 \n\n \nTable 1: Compliance with CPRO Access Criteriaa \n\nADB Staff Assessment \n\nCPRO Access Criteria \n\n1. Adverse impact of \nexogenous shocks \n\n2. Countercyclical \ndevelopment \nexpenditures \n\n3. Pre-shock record of \ngenerally sound \nmacroeconomic \nmanagement \n\nA  sharp  decline  in  growth,  revenue  collection,  and  employment  has  occurred  in \nFY2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. GDP growth is expected to be -1.5%, \nagainst 2.4% projected before the pandemic. Revenue, exports, and remittances are \nexpected decline during FY2020. Total revenue is expected to decline by $6 billion in \nFY2020,  from  the  pre-COVID  target  (para.  12).  The  pandemic  has  also  had  a \nsignificant impact on employment and poverty (para 14).    \n\nThe  government  has  acted  quickly  to  approve  a  countercyclical  development \nexpenditure program. The countercyclical development expenditure package of $7.23 \nbillion, approved on 30 March 2020, consists of three broad areas of support: health \nmeasures,  social  safety  net  measures,  and  economic  stimulus  measures.  The \ngovernment also approved a comprehensive COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and \nResponse Plan, including $595 million in financing for priority activities, on 23 April \n2020 (paras. 16\u201321). \n\nThe government remained on track in the implementation of its IMF EFF before the \npandemic.  It  had  made  substantive  progress  toward  improved  macroeconomic \nmanagement  since  July  2019.  For  example,  the  transition  to  a  market-determined \nexchange rate was extremely orderly, the external position improved significantly, and \nthe  budget  execution  improved  considerably  with  a  primary  surplus  during  July\u2013\nFebruary  FY2020.  The  government  enacted  the  Public  Finance  Management  Act, \n2019 to improve fiscal transparency. It remains fully committed to adhering to its fiscal \nrules under the act.

Coordination with the \nIMF \n\nADB Staff Assessment \n\nOn 13 March 2020, the government launched the National Action Plan for COVID-19, \nwhich identifies short-, medium- and long-term actions to be taken for the outbreak \npreparedness,  containment  and  mitigation.  Under  the  National  Action  Plan,  the \ngovernment also approved a comprehensive COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and \nResponse Plan with specific actions and structural reforms grouped under eight pillars \n(Appendix 4). The government has taken several other steps to contain the outbreak \nof the COVID-19 pandemic. These include enforcing social distancing, repurposing \nand augmenting medical facilities and personnel, procuring additional testing kits and \nequipment, and suspending air travel (paras. 17\u201318). \n\nPakistan\u2019s public debt reached 84.8% of GDP by the end of fiscal year FY 2019 (June \n2019) from 72.1% of GDP in FY2018 (without guarantee). This can be attributed to \nhigh primary deficit. The debt\u2013GDP ratio, however, declined to 77.3% by December \n2019. ADB\u2019s analysis concludes that the debt\u2013GDP ratio is expected to reach 84.1% \nin FY2020 due to additional borrowings.5 Financial support from ADB, AIIB, and the \nWorld  Bank  for  the  COVID-19  pandemic  will  raise  the  debt\u2013GDP  ratio  by  0.8 \npercentage points in FY2020. Net additional lending from IMF due to the COVID-19 \npandemic will add 0.2% of GDP to the debt stock in FY2020. The debt\u2013GDP ratio can \ndecline to 73.4% by FY2024. However, this will require strong adjustments in primary \nbalance (para. 22 and Debt Sustainability Analysis accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\nCollaboration and coordination with the IMF have been strong, including sharing of \ninformation  and  data  and  cross-verification  of  analyses.  Similar  consultations  have \ntaken place with the World Bank and AIIB to finalize parallel financing arrangements. \nRegular  consultation has  taken  place  with bilateral  partners  and  UN organizations, \nespecially  in  the  context  of  finalizing  Pakistan\u2019s  COVID-19  Strategic  Preparedness \nand Response Plan (para. 23).   \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AIIB  =  Asian  Infrastructure  Investment  Bank,  COVID-19  =  coronavirus  disease, \nCPRO  =  COVID-19  Pandemic  Response  Option,  EFF = Extended  Fund  Facility,  FY  =  fiscal  year,  GDP  =  gross \ndomestic product, IMF = International Monetary Fund, UN = United Nations. \na  More detailed information is in Appendix 4. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nBackground and Development Constraints  \n\n4. \nPre-COVID-19  economic  outlook.  From  FY2017  to  FY2019,  Pakistan  faced  severe  \neconomic challenges because of a rapidly expanding fiscal deficit; a large balance-of-payments \ngap and critically low foreign exchange reserves caused by eroding competitiveness and lack of \nexport diversification; and growing losses from several major state-owned enterprises, including \nenergy  sector  debt  resulting  from  untargeted  and  unfunded  subsidies  and  operational \ninefficiencies. The new government, which took office in August 2018, prepared a comprehensive \nrecovery program and approached the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for assistance. On 3 \nJuly 2019, the executive board of the IMF approved a 39-month extended arrangement under the \nIMF\u2019s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Pakistan.6 ADB participated in developing the economic \nrecovery program and provided budget support to carry out trade and energy reforms.7 ADB also \n\n \n5  Low growth in nominal GDP is also contributing to the debt to GDP ratio. \n6  IMF. 2019.

The government \nhas taken a three-pronged approach. First, it reduced fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficits, supported \nby stronger revenue growth that exceeded targets under the IMF EFF, to create fiscal space to \nsupport social and development spending.9 The agreed strategy aims to broaden the tax base \nand  enhance  tax  compliance  to  achieve  a  4\u20135  percentage  point  increase  in  the  tax\u2013gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  ratio  over  4\u20135  years.  Second,  on  the  expenditure  side,  the  budget \nincorporates  implicit  subsidies  in  the  energy  sector  that  were  not  budgeted  in  the  past  and \ncontributed  to  the  buildup  of  circular  debt.  Third,  it  is  implementing  the  Public  Finance \nManagement (PFM) Act, 2019 to improve fiscal discipline by requiring parliamentary approval of \nsupplementary  budget  authorizations.  Recent  legal  amendments  will  limit  the  use  of  statutory \nregulatory orders to emergencies, preventing their use (as in the past) for creating frequent tax \nconcessions by waiving sales tax obligations (Appendix 5). To support these efforts, provinces \naim  to  increase  the  collection  of  property  and  sales  taxes  and  assume  more  spending \nresponsibility.  \n \n6.  \nRevenue mobilization and improving the allocative efficiency of scarce public resources \nwill thus remain one of the central themes of the improved macroeconomic management. The \ngovernment  has  initiated  critical  reforms  in  these  areas  (Appendix  5).  Given  the  challenges  of \nsharp fiscal adjustment, ADB is currently processing technical assistance (TA) support in three \ncritical areas to strengthen government\u2019s fiscal consolidation initiatives. These include supporting \nthe implementation of initiatives under the PFM Act, facilitating the setting up of a tax policy unit \nto  improve  capacity  on tax  policy  matters,  and  helping  the  government  design  a  law  on  state-\nowned  enterprises  to  minimize  unproductive  subsidies  to  the  state-owned  enterprises.  These \nreforms were included in the IMF EFF program. Government\u2019s formal agreement (memorandum \nof understanding signed in 2019) between the federal and provincial governments on fiscal targets \nto sustain comprehensive fiscal consolidation efforts was also an important reform in this direction. \n\n \n\n8  ADB. 2019.

IMF Country Report. No. 19/380. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\fThe  government  has  agreed  with  the  IMF  on  the  appropriateness  of  countercyclical \n7.  \nspending in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to embark on fiscal consolidation initiatives \nas early as possible. The government\u2019s commitment to reform is also evidenced in the ongoing \nimplementation of key reforms in the Trade and Competitiveness Program (subprogram 2), the \nEnergy Sector Reform and Financial Sustainability Program (subprogram 2), and the forthcoming \nCapital  Market  Development  Program  (subprogram  1)  supported  by  ADB;  and  the  Resilient \nInstitutions  for  Sustainable  Economy  (RISE)  program,  Securing  Human  Investments  to  Foster \nTransformation  (SHIFT)  program  supported  by  the  World  Bank. 10 The  IMF  has  provided  an \nadditional $1.4 billion to meet the government\u2019s financial requirements during FY2020.  \n \n8. \nHealth impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pakistan has seen a significant increase in \nconfirmed cases of COVID-19, from the initial two cases on 26 February 2020 to about 72,460 as \nof 2 June 2020, with 1,543 deaths. Sindh is currently the region with the highest number of cases \n(28,245), followed by Punjab (26,240), KPK (10,027), and Balochistan (4,393).  \n \n9. \nAs more data become available, the World Health Organization (WHO) has undertaken \nfresh predictive analysis, triangulating data from multiple countries. Based on this analysis, the \nMinistry  of  National  Health  Services,  Regulation  and  Coordination  (MNHSRC)  projects  a  total \nincidence  load  of  more  than  196,000  cases  of  COVID-19,  of  which  an  estimated  30,000  will \nrequire  hospitalization  and  about  10,000  will  need  critical  care.  Related  measures  include \ncontinuing  partial  lockdown  and  effective  social  distancing  measures,  which  started  in  March \n2020, for 9 months.    \n \n10. \nThe weak institutional health capacity is clearly discernible from the following data. The \ncoverage  of  the  essential  health  workforce  (physicians,  nurses,  female  health  workers,  and \ncommunity midwives) in Pakistan is low, at 1.45 per 1,000 population11\u2014below the threshold of \n4.45 per 1,000 population. The country has 0.6 hospital beds per 1,000 population, and more than \n50% of people seek health services from private providers. The limited availability of lifesaving \nemergency obstetric and neonatal care is evidenced by the high lifetime risk of maternal death, \nwhich  is  1  in  180  (the  third  highest  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  with  an  estimated  8,300  maternal \ndeaths) and a maternal mortality ratio of 140 per 100,000 live births, with wide variation between \nprovinces. \n \n11.   Pakistan\u2019s inadequate health infrastructure is also reflected in the low Healthcare Access \nand  Quality  Index,  which  was  37.6  for  Pakistan  in  2016  compared  with  41.2  in  India,  47.6 in \nBangladesh,  and  70.6  in  Sri  Lanka.  The  Healthcare  Access  and  Quality  Index  provides  a \nsummary measure of healthcare access and quality for a given location. This measure is based \non risk-standardized mortality rates or mortality\u2013incidence ratios from causes that, in the presence \nof quality health care, should not result in death\u2014also known as amenable mortality.12   \n \n12.   Macroeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic: growth, exports, remittances, \nand  revenue.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  hit  Pakistan\u2019s  growth  performance  at  a  critical \njuncture  in  its  macroeconomic  recovery  program  (Figure  1).  The  first  major  channel  is \nmanufacturing production, which is affected because of three main reasons:13 (i) demand from \nhigh-income countries for manufacturing goods and raw materials is decreasing; (ii) value chains \nare being disrupted by delays in the delivery of necessary components and supplies from more \n\n \n\n10 World Bank. 2019.

World Health Statistics 2017: Monitoring Health for the SDGs. \n12 https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/healthcare-access-and-quality-index. \n13 ADB\u2019s needs assessment suggests that manufacturing growth might drop to -5% during FY2020. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\ntechnologically advanced countries; and (iii) other factors, including policies (e.g., restrictions on \nthe  movement  of  goods  and  people),  the  inability  of  employees  to  reach  their  workplace,  or \nfinancial constraints, are affecting the normal production process. The current pandemic will affect \nPakistan\u2019s economy through other important channels such as lower tourism and business travel. \nLocal  tourism,  which  was  growing  rapidly  in  the  last  few  years,  will  also  be  badly  affected, \nespecially  in  northern  Pakistan  during  June\u2013August  2020.  High  employment  linkages  with  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the United States (US), the European Union, and the Middle \nEast  will  cause  Pakistan\u2019s  remittances  to  decline  significantly  (Figure  2).  Both  exports  and \nremittances will decline by $2 billion during FY2020 (Figure 2). A final critical effect of the COVID-\n19  pandemic  is  the  expected  revenue  loss  during  FY2020  (Figure  2),  primarily  attributed  to \ndomestic production disruptions because of the lockdown and the lack of supply of imported raw \nmaterials  and  intermediate  goods\u2014primarily  from  the  PRC\u2014which  resulted  in  much  lower \nrevenue from custom duties. Total revenue is expected to decline by almost $6 billion and will \ncontribute  maximum  to  Pakistan  higher  fiscal  deficit  by  two  percentage  points  of  GDP  during \nFY2020. As a result of these effects, Pakistan\u2019s economic growth rate is expected to be much \nlower  than  the forecast of  2.4%,  but the  depth  of  this  decline  will  depend  on  the  intensity  and \nlength of the pandemic.   \n \n\nFigure 1: Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic on \nGDP \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Economic Impact of COVID-19 \n42.01\n\n2\n\n.\n\n5\n\n5\n\n.\n\n5\n\nADB\n\nIMF\n\n8\n\n.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n.\n\n3\n\n6\n\n.\n\n2\n\n4\n\n.\n\n2\n\n2\n\n.\n\n3\n\n2\n\n35.66\n\n25.59\n\n23.73\n\n22.58\n\n20.79\n\n45\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n.\n\n1\n-\n\nExports ($\nbillion)\n\nRevenue ($\nbillion)\n\nRemittances ($\nbillion)\n\nPre-COVID-19\n\nPost-COVID-19\n\n \n\nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease. \nSource: International Monetary Fund. \n\n \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  COVID-19  = \ncoronavirus  disease,  FY  =  fiscal  year,  GDP  =  gross \ndomestic product, IMF= International Monetary Fund. \nSources:  Asian  Development  Bank  and  International \nMonetary Fund. \n\n \n13.   Capital flight, reserves, and exchange rate. Macroeconomic management challenges \nhave worsened because of heightened volatility in global and local equity markets. The flight to \nsafety  has  caused  capital  outflows,  especially  large  withdrawals  of  nonresident  holdings  in \ndomestic treasuries in March 2020 and a net outflow of more than $150 million in foreign equity \ninvestments from 1 March 2020 to 14 April 2020. These outflows have had an impact on foreign \nexchange  reserves  and  triggered  currency  depreciations  against  lead  currencies  (Figures  3 \nand 4).  Moreover,  Pakistan\u2019s  access  to  global  financial  markets  has  become  more  expensive \nbecause of an increase in the credit default spread (3.71% increase in the yield on Pakistan\u2019s 10-\nyear Eurobond, which matures in 2021) since mid-March 2020.   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nFigure 3: Foreign Reserves Trend \n\n \n\nFigure 4: Nominal Exchange Rate (PRs/$) \n\n170\n\n165\n\n160\n\n155\n\n150\n\n145\n\n0\n2\n \nr\na\nM\n2\n0\n\n \n\n0\n2\n \nr\na\nM\n4\n0\n\n \n\n0\n2\n \nr\na\nM\n6\n0\n\n \n\n0\n2\n \nr\na\nM\n0\n1\n\n \n\n0\n2\n \nr\na\nM\n2\n1\n\n \n\n0\n2\n \nr\na\nM\n6\n1\n\n \n\n0\n2\n \nr\na\nM\n8\n1\n\n \n\n0\n2\n \nr\na\nM\n0\n2\n\n \n\n0\n2\n \nr\na\nM\n5\n2\n\n \n\n0\n2\n \nr\na\nM\n7\n2\n\n \n\n0\n2\n \nr\na\nM\n1\n3\n\n \n\n0\n2\n \nr\np\nA\n2\n0\n\n \n\n0\n2\n \nr\np\nA\n6\n0\n\n \n\n0\n2\n \nr\np\nA\n8\n0\n\n \n\n \n\nSource: State Bank of Pakistan. \n\n \n\nSBP = State Bank of Pakistan. \nSource: State Bank of Pakistan. \n\n \n14. \nSocial and poverty impacts of the pandemic. These impacts are leading to large-scale \njob losses\u2014both in the formal and informal sectors. Consequently, the number of poor people is \nexpected to rise significantly. Of the country\u2019s 37.9 million nonagricultural workers, 27.3 million \n(72%) work in the informal economy, while only 10.6 million (28%) are employed in the formal \neconomy. The 27.3 million informal economy workers are likely to be the most vulnerable to losing \ntheir jobs and in need of income security because of the lockdown. They are mainly engaged in \nsegments that are adversely affected by the shutdown of economic activity. The distribution of \nPakistan\u2019s 27.30 million informal economy workers shows that 8.88 million work in wholesale and \nretail trade, 6.22 million in manufacturing, 4.43 million in construction, 4.37 million in community \nand social and personal services, and 3.14 million in transport and storage and communications. \nDepending on the intensity of containment (shorter or longer), total job losses could vary between \n2.7 million to 4.5 million.14 Similarly, if the pandemic and containment strategies lead per capita \nconsumption to fall to 10%\u201320%, the poverty ratio is projected to increase from 22.8% without \nCOVID-19  to  31.1%\u201340.9%  in  the  post-COVID-19  scenario.15 Therefore,  the  social  cost  of  the \nCOVID-19 pandemic is expected to be high for the poor and vulnerable over the next 2\u20133 years, \nwhile  extremely  weak  growth  prospects  indicate  economy-wide  impacts  including  higher \nunemployment.   \n \n15.   Disproportionately high impact on women. Women suffer disproportionately from the \nimpacts  of  COVID-19  for  three  major  reasons.16 First,  about  22.8%  of  women  are  involved  in \nincome-generating activities, primarily in the informal low wage market.17 This under-represents \nwomen\u2019s  employment  potential,  given  that  low  participation  of  women  in  economic  activities. \nGiven  the  concentration  of  women  in  the  informal  economy,  they  are  not  protected  by  social \nprotection  programs  available  for  formal  women employees. Many  women,  including  domestic \nworkers  and  those  working  for  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs),  may  be  laid  off \nbecause  of  the  inability  of  employers  to  continue  paying  wages  during  lockdown.  Similarly, \nanalysis of home-based workers shows that Pakistan has 12 million home-based workers who \nearn  about  PRs3,000\u2013PRs4,000  per  month  and  will  face  multidimensional  issues  such  as  low \n\n \n\n14 ADB staff estimates. \n15 ADB staff estimates based on the poverty line of $3.20 per day. \n16 See  UN  Women.

Second, as of 2017, women have taken out 26% of all microfinance loans. This is low \nbecause  of  the  low  participation  of  women  in  entrepreneurial  activities.  However,  as  women\u2019s \nbusinesses tend to have lower cash flow and savings, the ability to repay loans may be affected.18 \nThis could result in higher interest rates, repayment penalties, and reduced access to loans. Third, \nthe concentration of medical staff on COVID-19 patients may reduce attention to and resources \nfor  maternal  and  child  health. 19 Moreover,  in  these  periods  of  economic  stress,  the  rates  of \nintimate partner violence tend to increase.  \n \nB.  \n\nADB Support Through COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \n\n16.   Government\u2019s countercyclical development expenditure program. The government \nresponded  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  related  economic  downturn  by  announcing  a \ncountercyclical development expenditure program of about $7.23 billion (Table 3) to strengthen \nthe health infrastructure and social safety net and provide a countercyclical fiscal stimulus.20 The \nimportant measures are discussed in paras. 17\u201320.  \n \n17.   Health measures. The Economic Coordination Council (ECC) approved a supplementary \ngrant  of  $0.60  billion  and  another  for  $0.15  billion  from  the  National  Disaster  Management \nAuthority to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 on the spread of coronavirus by increasing the supply \nof testing kits, medicines, and personal protective equipment (PPE).  \n \n18. \nThe  government  approved  the  National  Action  Plan  for  COVID-19  Response  in  March \n2020, with short-, medium- and long-term measures. Several immediate actions were taken under \nthis  plan  (Appendix  6).  Under  the  National  Action  Plan,  the  government  approved  the \ncomprehensive COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, including $595 million in \nfinancing for priority activities, on 23 April 2020. The plan has eight pillars (Appendix 4). Some \nPRs50 billion ($301 million) was set aside for the initial purchase of equipment and the necessary \nfacilitation of medical workers who are at the forefront of the fight against the virus. Tax rebates \nand  full  exemption  have  been  approved  for  the  import  of  medical  instruments  (including \nventilators), testing kits, PPE, and pharmaceutical machinery. \n \nSocial  safety  net  measures.  The  ECC  also  approved  a special  package  for  providing \n19. \nrelief to the poor through cash assistance under the Ehsaas (empathy) Program. The package \nwill provide cash grants to 12 million families under the ongoing Kifalat (sponsorship) Program \nand  emergency  cash  assistance  on  the  recommendation  of  the  district  administration.  The \nassistance will be provided for an initial period of 4 months. Households will be identified using \nthe social registry established for the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) through surveys, \nusing a propensity score matching exercise. Disbursements will be made through Kifalat partner \nbanks  after  biometric  verification.  The  ECC  approved  PRs200  billion  ($1.2  billion)  of  cash \nassistance for daily wage workers in the formal industrial economy who have been laid off as a \nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic.21 Recipients will be paid a minimum wage of PRs17,500 ($105) \n\n \n\n18 Nearly 57% of microfinance institution clients are estimated to be experiencing a complete (40%) or partial (17%) \nloss of income. Clients have begun asking for loan modifications under the government-mandated moratorium on \nloan repayments. \n\n19 This can be attributed to inadequate capacity to deliver health services, especially during an emergency. \n20 The  presence  of  an  economic  shock  and  the  pre-COVID-19  pandemic  macroeconomic  management  record  and \nsound budgetary framework to ensure transparency in expenditure are also part of the eligibility criteria for the CPRO, \nwhich have been discussed in Section A. \n\n21 These workers will be selected based on data and information available through the Employees\u2019 Old-Age Benefits \nInstitution, social security departments, and the Workers Welfare Fund. The Ministry of Industries and Production \nand the Ministry of Labour will carry out detailed screening of beneficiaries to improve targeting. \n\n \n\n\fper month for 4 months. It also approved PRs50 billion ($0.3 billion) for Utility Stores Corporation \nto  provide  essential food  items to  vulnerable  sections  of society  at  subsidized  rates.  The  ECC \nalso  permitted  the  reduction  of  different taxes  and  duties  on the  import  and  supply  of  different \nfood items. The rate of advance tax on the import of different pulses was reduced to 0% from 2%. \n \n\nTable 3: Government Countercyclical Development Package \n\nAmount \n($ billion) \n\nPurpose \n\nDescription \n\nHealth measures \u2013 0.75 \nEmergency Relief Fund \n\nFund for National Disaster Management \nAuthority \nSocial safety net measures \u2013 3.73 \nEhsaas Cash Assistance Package \n\nMonthly cash assistance for daily wage \nworkers \nUtility Stores Corporation to provide \nessential food items \nTax break on health and food supplies \n\nMinistry of Industries and Production to \nprocure 8.2 million tons of wheat  \nEconomic stimulus measures \u2013 2.75 \nFBR for payment of income and sales \ntax refunds \nCommerce Division for payment of duty \ndrawback \nSupport to industries and exporters \n\n0.60 \n\n0.15 \n\n0.44 \n\n1.20 \n\n0.30 \n\n0.10 \n\n1.69 \n\n0.45 \n\n0.18 \n\nTo control COVID-19 spread (procurement of PPE, testing \nkits, other essential treatment equipment) \nFacilitate relief activities \n\nCash grant to 12.0 million families (4.5 million women-\nheaded): PRs3,000 per month for 4 months \nCash assistance to 3 million workers: PRs17,500 per \nmonth for 4 months \nProvision of essential food items at subsidized rates \n\nTemporary tax incentive to strengthen supply of health \nequipment and control food inflation \nModerate food inflation \n\nImprove liquidity of entrepreneurs to maintain inventory \nlevels \nImprove liquidity of exporters \n\n0.92 \n\n0.60 \n\n0.60 \n\n7.23 \n\n     Total \n\nAllocation for the energy sector \n\nSupport to agriculture and SMEs  \n\nKick-start economic and/or entrepreneurial activities and \ncreate jobs \nProvide subsidized inputs to agriculture and subsidized \nloans to SMEs to create jobs \nDelayed collection of arrears from consumers and support \nto power distribution companies for not revising prices \n  \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, FBR = Federal Board of Revenue, PPE = personal protective equipment, SMEs = \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises. \nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding.  \nSource: Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance. \n \nEconomic  stimulus  measures.  To  provide  economic  stimulus  for  restoring  economic \n20. \nactivities, the ECC approved (i) $0.45 billion for the Federal Board of Revenue to pay back the \nsales tax and income tax refunds owed over the last 10 years, to help about 676,055 beneficiaries \nby improving their liquidity position; (ii) $0.18 billion to the Ministry of Commerce to pay back duty \ndrawbacks to textile exporters in the current financial year to improve their liquidity position while \ntheir businesses are experiencing a slowdown because of the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19; \n(iii) support to industries, SMEs, agriculture, and exporters through input subsidies (including bank \nloans) to revive productive activities; and (iv) $0.92 billion to power distribution companies for not \nrevising energy tariffs until June 2020 and delaying the collection of arrears to a later date. The \ngovernment  also  decided  to  enhance  the  allocation  for  the  Kamyab  Jawan  (successful  youth) \nProgram to encourage self-employment.22 \n \n\n22 The Prime Minister launched the Kamyab Jawan Program in 2019 to provide soft loans to the country\u2019s youth to \ncreate  self-employment  opportunities.  An  amount  of  PRs100  billion  has  been  allocated  for  the  program  to  reach \n1 million youth across the country. \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nThe State Bank of Pakistan has also announced measures to stimulate industrial activities \n\n21. \n(Appendix 4).  \n \n22.   Debt  remains  sustainable  in  medium-term  despite  additional  borrowing. 23  ADB \nprepared an updated debt sustainability analysis on 30 April 2020. The ADB analysis presents \nthree scenarios: (i) pre-COVID-19, (ii) post-COVID-19 with only additional IMF assistance of $1.4 \nbillion,  and  (iii)  post-COVID-19  with  additional  financial  assistance  (as  well  as IMF  assistance) \nfrom ADB, the World Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The second and \nthird  scenarios  (post-COVID-19)  are  based  on  the  revised  growth  projections  from  the  World \nEconomic Outlook, showing a sharp decline in the growth rate to -1.5% in FY2020 because of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The ADB analysis incorporates an intense fiscal adjustment, which is in line \nwith the current government plans. Under the third scenarios, the primary fiscal balance should \nhave a surplus of 2.7% of GDP by FY2024. The analysis reaches a similar conclusion to the IMF \ndebt sustainability analysis, indicating that the total public debt stock to GDP is sustainable and \nwill reach 73.4% by FY2024 despite additional assistance from ADB, IMF, the World Bank and \nAIIB. This result, however, critically hinges on four prerequisites: (i) early control of the COVID-\n19 outbreak; (ii) global growth and employment recovery phase begins; (iii) tax buoyancies return \nto the pre-COVID levels; and (iv) a swift exit from temporary tax and fiscal incentives and transfer \npayments implemented as part of the government\u2019s COVID-19 Response Plan. \n \n23.   Coordination with the International Monetary Fund and other development partners. \nADB  has  consulted  closely  with  all  relevant  development  partners,  including  the  IMF,  on \nPakistan\u2019s  macroeconomic  performance  over  the  last  3  years  and  the  need  for  providing \nadditional  assistance  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  COVID-19  pandemic.  ADB  also  carried  out \nconsultations with the World Bank and AIIB for cofinancing of ADB\u2019s assistance for the COVID-\n19 pandemic in Pakistan (para 26). The IMF, on 16 April 2020, approved emergency financing of \n$1.386 billion for Pakistan under its Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to support the government\u2019s \nemergency economic and social program to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. On 2 April \n2020,  the  World  Bank  approved  a  $200  million  COVID-19  Emergency  Response  and \nEffectiveness  Project,  which  is  part  of  a  coordinated  effort  with  ADB\u2019s  emergency  assistance \nthrough parallel financing of the government\u2019s National Emergency Preparedness and Response \nPlan  for  COVID-19. 24 A  COVID-19  donor  coordinating  group\u2014including  ADB,  the  European \nUnion, United Nations (UN) agencies, the World Bank, and bilateral partners\u2014has met weekly \nsince  24 March  2020  to  discuss  regular  updates  on  new  developments  and  changes  in  the \nCOVID-19  response  plans.  ADB  also  coordinated  with  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund \n(UNICEF) to procure testing kits and medical equipment through UN registered suppliers. Grant \nassistance from other bilateral partners (the PRC, the US, Japan, the Department for International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom, and German development cooperation through KfW) and \nthe UN is being discussed.25  \n \nC.  \n\nProposed Program, Impacts, Lessons Learned, and Value Addition \n\n24.   ADB\u2019s proposed program. ADB financing under the CARES Program is provided as a \nbudget support to meet gaps in the government\u2019s development financing needs. The design and \nmonitoring  framework  (DMF)  in  Appendix  1  presents  relevant  indicators  reflecting  the \ngovernment\u2019s COVID-19 response plan. The selection of the indicators is based on elements of \n\n \n\n23 Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 ADB.  2020.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  and \nAdministration of Grant to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Emergency Assistance for Fighting the COVID-19 \nPandemic. Manila. \n\n25 $1 billion is expected from the bilateral donors during FY2020. \n\n \n\n\fImpact. The CARES Program is aligned with the following impact: adverse impacts of the          \n\nthe pandemic response plan that are a priority for ADB.  \n \n25.  \nCOVID-19  pandemic  on  achieving  sustained  and  inclusive  growth  mitigated.  The  effect  of  the \nreforms is COVID-19 outbreak more effectively managed and its immediate social and economic \ndamages reduced. The CARES Program is structured around three outputs: (i) measures to arrest \nCOVID-19  introduced,  (ii)  cash  assistance  and  financial  inclusion  programs  targeting  women \nimplemented, and (iii) measures to prevent job losses introduced.   \n \n26.  \nThe CARES Program will also facilitate parallel financing of $500 million from AIIB and \nanother  $500  million  from  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Securing  Human  Investments  to  Foster \nTransformation (SHIFT) budget support program. AIIB\u2019s parallel financing will support proposed \noutputs of the CARES Program, while SHIFT will focus on conditional cash transfers, institutional \nstrengthening of the BISP, strengthening rural and primary health care centers, and improving \nthe working conditions of home-based workers. ADB assisted Emergency Assistance Loan (EAL), \ntotaling $300 million and cofinanced by a $200 million loan from the World Bank, mainly targets \ninterventions  under  two  outputs:  (i)  public  health  emergency  preparedness,  and  (ii)  social \nprotection for the poor and vulnerable women covered by BISP. The EAL and the World Bank \nproject will, therefore, complement each other in providing support for COVID-19 preparedness \nand responses in the health sector. However, a significant funding gap will remain. The budget \nsupport from the CARES Program and parallel financing from AIIB and the SHIFT program will \nhelp the government to bridge the financing gap. The CARES Program will also complement the \nEAL by providing countercyclical fiscal support to mitigate the social and economic impacts of the \npandemic. \n \n27.  \nThe  proposed  cash  assistance  under  the  government\u2019s  countercyclical  development \nprogram  to  strengthen  the  social  safety  net  will  cover  both  women-headed  households  and \nwomen  beneficiaries  in  households  not  headed  by  women.  The  12  million  beneficiaries  of  the \nEhsaas Program will include (i) 4.5 million original BISP beneficiaries (women-headed families); \n(ii) 4.0 million additional families (outside the original BISP beneficiaries) selected by raising the \nthresholds (both men- and women-headed families); and (iii) an additional 3.5 million poor families \nselected  through  new  surveys.  The  original  4.5  million  beneficiaries  are  covered  under  ADB\u2019s \nEAL, additional financing for the Social Protection Development Project,26 and the World Bank\u2019s \nCOVID-19 Emergency Response and Effectiveness Project; and the 7.5 million additional families \nare  covered  under  the  CARES  Program27 and  parallel  financing  from  AIIB.  Thus,  these  two \nprograms  will  complement  each  other.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  SHIFT  budget  support  program  will \nsupport the government\u2019s overarching objective of providing effective social safety net systems \nand will complement ADB\u2019s budget support under the CARES Program. \n \n28.  \nLessons learned. In designing the proposed CARES Program, ADB draws on lessons \nlearned  from  previous  interventions  in  Pakistan,  including  support  to  the  BISP  and  the  SPBL \napproved in 2019. Strict monitoring and early identification of problem areas is critical to ensure \naid effectiveness. To mitigate these challenges, maintaining close ties with the executing agency \nand the overall coordination group, especially in a crisis, is critical. This is more relevant when \ntransfer payments are planned for a large group spread across the country, and quite often not \neasily identifiable. ADB\u2019s experience in designing support for the BISP was very useful. In a crisis \n\n \n\n26 ADB. 2019. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan for Additional \n\nFinancing to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Social Protection Development Project. Manila.  \n\n27 The 7.5 million beneficiaries financed under the CARES Program do not overlap with the 2.5 million eligible BISP \nbeneficiary women financed under the EAL or about 0.7 million eligible BISP beneficiary women financed under the \nadditional financing.   \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nsuch as this, budget support is needed for two important reasons. First, it ensures timely delivery \nof  financial  assistance  to  carry  out  critical  countercyclical  measures.  Second,  the  fund  flow \nmechanism through the government\u2019s usual budget systems is effective when TA is provided to \nstrengthen  PFM.28 ADB  support  for  trade  and  energy  reform  programs  reiterated  the  need  for \ntimely  and  sustained  support  for  capacity  development.  Many  initiatives  planned  under  the \nCOVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan will require strong capacity development \nsupport from development partners. ADB is engaged with other development partners to support \nsuch capacity development.  \n \n29.   ADB\u2019s  value  addition.  ADB  has  adopted  a  medium-term  development  engagement \nunderstanding  with  the  government  through  several  policy-based  loans  including  the  SPBL \napproved  in  2019.  Many  reforms  are  politically  sensitive  and  will  require  strong  constituency \nbuilding.  Thus,  supporting  the  government  in  implementing  the  countercyclical  development \npackage, including measures related to the social safety net and health sector initiatives, is the \nmost important value addition of the CARES Program. \n \n30.   ADB has been playing an important role in strengthening unconditional cash transfers to \npoor women-headed households under the BISP through improved targeting and monitoring.29 It \nhas also facilitated (i) women\u2019s financial inclusion in the 2019 SPBL, and (ii) improved access to \nfinance by women entrepreneurs in the Trade and Competitiveness Program.30 In addition, ADB \nis  carrying  out  intense  consultations  with  the  government  and  other  development  partners  in \ndesigning  the  COVID-19  Strategic  Preparedness  and  Response  Plan  (para.  26),  including \nthrough  joint  formulation  with  the  government  and  the  World  Bank  of  the  concept  paper  for \nemergency support. ADB will provide TA support to implement the EAL and the CARES Program \nwhich  will  help  augment  the  government\u2019s  capacities  in  monitoring  and  reporting,  including \nvarious  cash transfer  programs. It  will  also  provide  TA  support  to  validate  the  DMF  indicators, \nespecially  those  related  to  the  gender  initiatives. 31 Thus,  ADB  is  well  placed  to  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s implementation of structural measures to address the spread of COVID-19 and to \nmitigate its economic impacts on the population.  \n \n31.   CARES Program is also in line with ADB\u2019s regional approach and response to COVID-19 \nbeing articulated through a regional TA.32 Drawing on the lessons learned from implementation \nof the CARES program, the proposed regional TA will help to build capacity to jointly prepare, \nmitigate  and  respond  to  future  regional  pandemic  threats  that  can  impact  population  and  their \nlivelihood and vulnerabilities. This is being implemented in collaboration with all CAREC member \ncountries two of which also share borders with Pakistan (Afghanistan and the PRC). \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\n32.  \nThe macroeconomic target under the economic recovery program stipulated a fiscal deficit \n(including  grants)  to  GDP  ratio  of  7.3%  in  FY2020.  However,  the  countercyclical  development \n\n \n\n28 ADB is currently processing a TA to support implementation of the Public Finance Management Act, 2019. \n29 ADB. 2013.

Addressing Health Threats in Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Countries and the Caucasus. \n\nManila. (Forthcoming) \n\n \n\n\fexpenditure program announced in March 2020 and additional health expenditure, together with \nthe  revenue  loss,  will  push  the  fiscal  deficit  to  almost  9.3%  of  GDP  during  FY2020  (about \n$4.1 billion  of  additional  fiscal  deficit)  despite  reprioritization  of  expenditure  and  cuts  in \ndevelopment expenditure equal to 1 percentage point of GDP. The IMF has provided an additional \n$1.386 billion under RFI. However, additional assistance from IMF during FY2020 is expected to \nbe $482 million due to rescheduling of disbursements under EFF. The World Bank is also planning \nto provide $950 million of additional financial resources in FY2020, including $200 million for the \nPandemic Response Emergency Project, approved in April 2020. To help the government to meet \nits  remaining  development  financing  needs,  ADB  is  proposing  to  provide  $852  million  in \nassistance (excluding the planned policy-based loans and the TA) during FY2020, including $500 \nmillion of budget support under the CARES Program.33 With this additional budget support, ADB\u2019s \ntotal budget support during FY2020 will rise to $2.3 billion, of which $1.8 billion already disbursed \nduring December 2019.34 \n \nFinancing of the fiscal deficit is summarized in Table 4.35 The government has requested \n33.  \na  regular  loan  of  $500,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  the \nanticipated deficit from the pandemic response and countercyclical support expenditure needs.  \nThe loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement. The average loan maturity using the 30% annuity method is 12.1 years, \nand  there  is  no  maturity  premium.  The  loan  size  is  based  on  Pakistan\u2019s  financing  needs,  and \ndevelopment spending arising from the development expenditure program. \n \n\nTable 4: Additional Financing Requirement: FY2020 ($ million) \nBefore COVID-\n19 \n\nWith COVID-19 \n(ADB \nEstimates) \n23,235 \n\nAdditional \nFinancing \nNeeds \n4,139 \n\n19,096 \n\n9,614 \n\n9,482 \n\n13,398 \n\n9,837 \n\nI.

The \ngovernment,  through  the  MOF,  will  monitor  budget  execution  and  the  flow  of  funds  for \ncountercyclical  measures.  The  CARES  Program  will  be  disbursed  in  a  single  tranche  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nThe program implementation period is from March 2020 to June 2021. The loan closing date is \n30 June 2021. The MOF will appoint a project director to liaise with ADB. The MOF will monitor \nthe activities and expenditures under the CARES Program, submit quarterly reports to ADB, and \nengage in dialogue with ADB until 6 months after the loan closing date. The government, through \nthe  MOF,  will  submit  two  additional  reports  to  ADB.  These  are  (i)  a  status  report  on  the \ncountercyclical development package, covering the utilization of funds, impacts, and the future \nplan by 10 December 2020; and (ii) a report on the status of the DMF output indicators by May \n2021. ADB will provide TA support to strengthen PFM, and to conduct surveys of beneficiaries for \nindependent  validation  of  the  cash  transfer  programs,  including  appropriate  targeting  and \ndisbursement (footnote 31). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nGovernance36 \n\n35.   Pakistan has extensive centralized legislative and institutional PFM structures, but their \neffective and efficient implementation is challenged by a decentralized service delivery system. \nBudget credibility and execution remains a key area of weakness despite progress in reforming \nthe PFM systems, with the implementation of a financial accounting and budgeting system, the \nintroduction  of  a  medium-term  budgetary framework,  and  output-based budgeting.  The federal \nand  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  internal  audit  functions  will  require  improvements  and  are  not  yet \nestablished in the other provinces. External audits, performed by the constitutionally independent \noffice of the Auditor General of Pakistan, continue to face delays in the execution of audits and \nthe settlement of audit observations. With the support of development partners, including ADB \nand the World Bank, the government has embarked on a six pillar PFM Reform Strategy, 2018\u2013\n2027  to  improve  PFM  governance.  The  PFM  Act  is  expected  to  instill  the  requisite  risk \nmanagement,  transparency,  accountability,  and  system  efficiencies  in  the  PFM  cycle. \nGovernance  reforms  also  include  the  creation  of  positions  within  ministries  and  divisions  to \nstrengthen the accounting and internal audit functions. A treasury office and fiscal risk unit will be \nestablished within the MOF to strengthen commitment controls, cash management, and fiscal risk \nmanagement. \n \n\n36 Detailed PFM assessment in Pakistan can be accessed from the list of supplementary documents. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nB. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n36.  \nThe government, in collaboration with development partners including ADB, has followed \na  two-pronged  approach  to  address  the  social  cost  of  the  economic  crisis  and  subsequent \nstructural  adjustment  program  since  2019:  (i)  providing  financing  support  to  social  protection \nprograms  that  can  reduce  negative  economic  impacts  on  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  including \nwomen;  and  (ii)  strengthening  the  government\u2019s  capacity  to  identify  and  implement  important \npolicy actions to ensure equitable and inclusive access to social protection. To this end, it has \nembarked on major initiatives, e.g., it launched the Ehsaas Program to scale up social protection \nthrough the financial and digital inclusion of about 7 million households headed by women; and \nimplemented  a  housing,  health  insurance,  and  welfare  program  for  the  poor  and  people  with \ndisabilities.  \n \nC. \n\nGender \n\n37.  \nThe  government  introduced  targeted  gender-related  reforms  in  2019  to  strengthen  the \nimplementation of the Ehsaas Program. This included (i) targets to support women entrepreneurs\u2019 \naccess to finance; and (ii) a new banking contract for cash transfers under the BISP, which is \nexpected to make cash transfers to women swift, transparent, and safe. These programs have \nbecome even more relevant in the current context. For this reason, the government is extending \nthe scope of these programs with the help of ADB and other development partners to address the \nwidespread economic hardship of women, the poor, and vulnerable because of the COVID-19 \npandemic. ADB continues to provide support to the BISP through other programs (footnote 29). \nThe CARES Program\u2019s gender categorization is \u201ceffective gender mainstreaming\u201d, and it revolves \naround the following facilitation: (i) support for unconditional cash transfer to women beneficiaries \nto compensate for work losses and ensure adequate food consumption so that food consumption \nis restored to the pre-COVID-19 level; (ii) easing access to finance for women entrepreneurs with \nat  least  25%  of  beneficiaries  of  the  loan  under  the  Kamyab  Jawan  Program  are  women \nentrepreneurs;  (iii)  promoting  financial  inclusion  among  poor  women  with  6  million  women \nbeneficiaries received cash through bank accounts; (iv) unconditional cash transfers to at least \n690,000 female daily wage workers ; and (v) providing appropriate PPE to at least 6,000 female \nmedical frontline staff.  \n \n38.  \nThe  new  women  beneficiaries  for  the  cash  transfer  program  are  expected  to  comprise \n50%  of  the  new  households  (para.  27).  Funds  will  be  transferred  to  them  through  more  than \n18,000 branches of Habib Bank and Bank Al-Falah across Pakistan after biometric verification. \nTargeting and selection of the beneficiaries are carried out carefully using several criteria by the \nNational Database Registration Authority based on information embedded in the Computerized \nNational Identity Card. To the extent the families are women-headed, the funds will be transferred \nto their account. The benefit of the cash assistance has positive spillovers for the empowerment \nof women in poor households. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nFollowing  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  CARES  Program  is  classified \n39.  \ncategory  C  for  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  safeguards. \nProgram activities will be confined to policy and institutional reforms. The program is not expected \nto  have  any  environmental  or  social  safeguards  impacts  within  the  meaning  of  the  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. The loan proceeds will not be used to finance any activities resulting in physical \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\nor  economic  displacement,  as  defined  by the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.37 The  CARES \nProgram  will  confirm  such  exclusions  through  the  MOF\u2019s  quarterly  monitoring  reporting  on \nconsolidated expenditures. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n40.   Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.38 \n \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nCOVID-19  pandemic  is  not  contained  over  2\u20133 \nmonths, leading to a much larger economic impact, \nand causes inadequacy of the expenditure package. \n\nThe  government  lacks  the  technical  expertise  to \nimplement the countercyclical expenditure package, \nespecially  dealing  with  health  sector  initiatives  and \ntargeting social  sector protection  programs  (outside \nthe coverage of the BISP), causing subdued benefits. \n\nInadequate internal control systems within the federal \nand  provincial  governments  and  the  BISP  could \nreduce  the  effectiveness  of  cash  transfer  targeting \nunder  the  countercyclical  development  expenditure \npackage. \n\nMitigating Measures \nFinancial and technical support to help improve the capacity \nto diagnose and treat COVID-19 patients. \n\nContinuous  technical  and  policy  engagement  by  ADB  and \nother  development  partners,  including  the  IMF,  with  the \ngovernment. \n\nis  based  on \n\nTargeting \nthe  social  registry  and  other \ngovernment databases, and payments will require biometric \nidentification.

Islamabad. \nb  It is not yet possible to set more specific and realistic effects of the program targets than those presented in the table \nbecause  of  uncertainties  regarding  how  the  outbreak  will  unfold,  its  economic  effects,  the  need  for  government \nresponses to be flexible as the situation evolves, and since new data collection and reporting systems to monitor the \ncrisis are being developed and evolving. Additional indicators to measure the effects will be identified later and used \nto report on the program\u2019s effectiveness as comprehensively as possible in the project completion report (e.g., new \nbusiness units set up by the young entrepreneurs and the number of frontline medical staff affected per 1,000 COVID-\n19  patients  treated).  Many  other  important  indicators,  such  as  the  proportion  of  women  in  daily  wage  workers, \nwomen-headed households in the BISP category B database, the total number of women family members in the \nadditional 4.5 million beneficiary families, and women entrepreneurs in the credit guarantee scheme, will be obtained \nduring program implementation. \n\nc  The end-line survey to be conducted in 2021, will include questions to determine the pre-COVID-19 crisis level of \nhousehold food consumption. ADB will facilitate this survey. These new beneficiaries are expected to be 50% of the \n4 million new households added in the BISP category B database by raising the threshold. The database for the \nBISP  category B  households  already  exists  in  the  Socio-Economic  Registry.  This  will  facilitate  the  survey.  This \nassessment  will  be  complemented  by  BISP  beneficiary data  and  analysis  of  the  Household  Integrated  Economic \nSurvey to understand pre-COVID-19 consumption levels. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=54193-001-3 \n \n\nLoan Agreement \n\nDevelopment Coordination \n\nInternational Monetary Fund Assessment Letter \n\nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n\nRisk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nList of Ineligible Items \n\nGender Monitoring Matrix \n\nDebt Sustainability Analysis \n\n \n\nSupplementary Documents \n\n9. \n\nSafeguards Assessment Matrix \n\n10. \n\nPublic Financial Management Systems in Pakistan \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n19 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n21 \n\nCOMPLIANCE WITH COVID-19 PANDEMIC RESPONSE OPTION ACCESS CRITERIA \n\nAccess Criteria \n\n \n\nADB Staff Assessments \n\n1. Adverse Impact of \nExogenous Shocks. \n\nAs  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  economic  growth, \nrevenue  and  employment  experienced  sharp  declines  in \nFY2020. Current estimates forecast a contraction in GDP by \n1.5%  against  a  growth  of  2.4%  projected  before  the \npandemic.  \n \nLosses  in  revenue  are  largely  due  to  decline  in  domestic \nproduction,  both  on  account  of  lockdown  and  disruptions  in \nthe supply chain of imported raw materials and intermediate \ngoods, primarily from the PRC. Current estimates are that the \ntotal  revenues  will  decline  by  about  $6  billion,  which  will  in \nturn raise the fiscal deficit by about 2% of GDP (as against \nthe pre-COVID-19 target).  \n \nPakistan  borders  Afghanistan,  the  PRC,  India,  and  the \nIslamic  Republic  of  Iran.  Given  the  country\u2019s  strategic \nlocation,  regional  connectivity  is  vital  for  trade,  transit, \nemployment  in  the  region  and  remittances  to  Pakistan. \nPakistan\u2019s  trade,  tourism  and  other  related  sectors  are  hit \nhard due to disruptions in regional connectivity. In particular, \nexports and remittances are expected to sharply decline due \nto pandemic led slow-down in global economy, especially in \ncase  of  the  PRC,  USA,  EU  and  the  Middle  East.  Current \nestimates  indicate  that  exports  and  remittances  will  decline \nby $2 billion. \n \nWhile the full magnitude of the economic losses will depend \non how the outbreak evolves, it is clear that the pandemic has \nsignificantly  impacted  Pakistan\u2019s  progress  on  its  economic \nrecovery program initiative.    \n \n\nThe  government  has  taken  so  far  taken  two  key  policy \ndecisions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.  \n \nFirst, \nthe  government  has  approved  a  countercyclical \nresponse on 30 March 2020, which comprises initiatives for \nincluding  women; \nprotecting  the  poor  and  vulnerable, \naugmenting  the  health  sector  response;  and  protecting  the \nproductive  sectors  and  small  businesses  from  economic \ndownturn.  The  total  countercyclical  development  package \namounts to $7.23 billion.  \n \nSecond,  the  government  approved  a  National  Action  Plan \nFramework  on  13  March  2020,  which  comprises  short-, \nmedium- and long-term measures. Under the Framework, the \ngovernment  prepared  and  approved  the  comprehensive \nCOVID-19  Strategic  Preparedness  and  Response  Plan, \n\n\uf0fc \n\n\uf0fc \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.

The plan cover the eight distinct pillars: \n \n(i)  Country-level Coordination, Planning and Monitoring; \n(ii)  Risk Communication and Community Engagement; \n(iii)  Surveillance,  Rapid  Response  Teams  and  Case \n\nInvestigation; \n\nInfection Prevention and Control; \n\n(iv)  Points of Entry; \n(v)  Laboratory Network; \n(vi) \n(vii)  Case Management; and  \n(viii)  Operational Support and Logistics. \n \nIn parallel, SBP implemented monetary measures to facilitate \nrevival  of  economic  growth  and  creation  of  employment \nopportunities. Measures include (i) reduction in the policy rate \nby  525  basis  points  (from  13.25%  to  8%)  to  induce \nconsumption  and  investment  demand;  (ii)  reduction  in  the \ncapital  conservation  buffer  to  increase  the  size  of  loanable \nfunds; and (iii) raising the retail credit limit for the small and \nmedium  enterprises  (SMEs).  SBP  also  announced  a  credit \nwindow  for  the  hospitals  to  purchase  equipment  and  other \nnecessary  items  to  tackle  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  a \nrefinancing scheme for payment of wages and salaries to the \nworkers and employees of business concerns at lower mark \nup with the objective to prevent them laying off workers. \n\nrate \n\nSince  entering  the  IMF  EFF,  the  government  had  taken \nsignificant  progress  towards  improving  its  macroeconomic \nmanagement. Since July 2019, the country had transitioned \nto  a  market-determined  exchange \nregime,  and \nsignificantly improved its external position. Budget execution \nwas  also  improved,  which  was  evident  from  the  primary \nsurplus between July 2019 and February 2020.  \n \nImproved  performance  in  FY2020  (July  2019  to  February \n2020) was also evident from a range of other key economic \nparameters,  including  primary  balance,  current  account \ndeficit,  trade  deficit,  exchange  rate  fluctuations  etc.,  when \ncompared against FY2019 (July 2018 to February 2019).  \n \nGovernment  also  enacted  Public  Finance  Management  Act \nin 2019 to improve transparency in fiscal management. Some \nkey provisions of the Act include: \n \nBudget Planning: \n \n(i)  Requires drafting of Budget Strategy Paper; \n\n3.

These included, among \nothers,  enforcing  social  distancing, \nrepurposing  and \naugmenting medical facilities, reassigning health personnel, \nprocuring test kits and equipment, and suspending air travel \n(see the details in Appendix 6).  \n \nThe  government  is  in  the  middle  of  implementing  key \nstructural  reforms  designed  under  the  economic  recovery \nprogram (initiated in 2019). These reforms are necessary to \nconsolidate the government\u2019s finances and create the fiscal \nspace.  Without  adequate  fiscal  headroom,  the  government \nwill  not  be  in  a  position  to  adequately  spend  on  social  and \neconomic infrastructure. \n\nADB\u2019s  debt  sustainability  analysis  considered \nthree \nscenarios:  (i)  pre-COVID-19  scenario;  (ii)  with  COVID-19 \nscenario  considering  only  the  additional  IMF  assistance  of \n$1.4  billion;  and  (iii)  with-COVID-19  scenario  considering \nadditional financial assistance for COVID-19 (over and above \nthe IMF assistance) from ADB (COVID-19 Active Response \nand Expenditure Support Program and EAL), from the World \nBank and cofinancing from the AIIB.  \n \nAnalysis found that under scenarios (i) and (ii) debt to GDP \nratio at end June 2020 was expected to be about 80% and \n83.3%, respectively. Under scenario (iii), debt to GDP ratio is \nexpected to increase by 0.8 percentage points to 84.1% by \nend  June  2020. In the medium  term,  the  debt to  GDP  ratio \nwill decline to about 73.4% in FY2024 in scenario (iii).  \n \nHowever,  formidable  challenge  will  remain  in  ensuring  that \nthe  debt  stock  remains  sustainable.  These  challenges \ninclude: (i) early control of the COVID-19 outbreak; (ii) growth \nrecovery  phase  begins  everywhere \nand  employment \n\n5. Debt Sustainability \n\n\uf0fc \n\n \n\n\fAccess Criteria \n\n \n\nADB Staff Assessments \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n25 \n\nincluding  Pakistan;  (iii)  tax  buoyancies  return  to  the  pre-\nCOVID-19  levels;  and  (iv)  exit  from  temporary  tax/fiscal \nincentives and transfer payments. Weak adherence to fiscal \nconsolidated targets and a lower primary surplus will remain \nthe  most  fundamental  risk  for  debt  sustainability  (Debt \nSustainability  Analysis  accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n \nIMF\u2019s  2020  Debt  Sustainability  Analysis  undertaken  in  April \n2020  had  similar  findings,  though  it  did  not  consider  fully \nADB\u2019s COVID-19 related assistance and its cofinancing from \nAIIB. IMF Analysis noted that Pakistan\u2019s debt trajectory would \nremain sustainable provided that the government returns to \nits  fiscal  consolidation  program  as  early  as  possible.  IMF \nAnalysis also noted that the debt stock is expected to decline \nto 73% of GDP by FY2024 (excluding guarantees). \n\nADB  has  worked  closely  with  all  relevant  development \npartners including the IMF in last 3 years, particularly on the  \nmacroeconomic  challenges.  Together  with  the  IMF  it  has \ntaken a lead role in dialogue and support for the government\u2019s \nEFF program and has also provided complementary financial \nsupport.  The  World  Bank  and the  AIIB  agreed  to  cofinance \nthe  proposed  COVID-19  Active  Response  and  Expenditure \nSupport Program and EAL. A COVID-19 donor coordinating \ngroup\u2014including ADB, European Union, UN agencies, World \nBank, and bilateral partners\u2014has met weekly since 24 March \n2020.  Regular  updates  on  all  new  developments  and \nchanges  in  the  COVID-19  response  plans  are  discussed. \nADB participated, along with the World Bank, WHO, UNDP \nand  other  bilateral  donors,  in  preparation  of  the  COVID-19 \nStrategic  Preparedness  &  Response  Plan.
