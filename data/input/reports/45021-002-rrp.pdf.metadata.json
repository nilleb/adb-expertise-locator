About  56%  of  the  province\u2019s  59.7  million  people  lived  in  rural \nareas in 2011, but population density, at 430 inhabitants per square kilometer,  is much higher \nthan  the  national  average  (138)  and  land  availability  is  limited.  Despite  economic  growth,  the \nprovince\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  per  capita  remains  much  lower  than  those  of  the  adjacent \ncoastal  provinces  of  Jiangsu  and  Zhejiang. 3 Anhui  has  had  some  success  in  its  efforts  to \ncapitalize on the advantages of its physical proximity to these more affluent provinces owing to \nits  large,  skilled,  and  less  costly  labor  force.  It  is  gradually  attracting  new  investments  and \nmaintained  double-digit  annual  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  during  2011\u20132012. \nProduction  has  grown  faster  than  the  national  average,  and  Anhui\u2019s  consumption  per  capita \nreached 77% of the national average in 2011, up from 70% in 2005. \n\n4. \nTo harness Anhui\u2019s geographical advantage and cost competitiveness and promote new \ninvestment  in manufacturing  and  services,  the  PRC  State  Council  approved  a plan  in  January \n2010  to  create  the Wanjiang  Demonstration  Zone  (WDZ).  The  plan  aims  to  attract  equipment \nmanufacturing, textile, information technology, and agricultural industries to the urbanized areas \nalong the Wanjiang River, which is the name given to the stretch of the Yangtze River that flows \nthrough  Anhui. The WDZ  covers fifty  nine  counties  and nine cities,  including  Hefei  and Wuhu, \nand  is  expected  to  facilitate  the  expansion  of  existing  Anhui-based  companies  as  well  as \nencourage companies to relocate from elsewhere in the Yangtze River Delta, including Anhui\u2019s \nneighboring provinces. \n\n5. \nThe city of Xuancheng is the nearest point in the WDZ to the Yangtze River Delta, and \nborders Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Only 283 kilometers (km) west of the city of Shanghai, \nit  is  the  closest  major  center  in  the  WDZ,  making  it  a  favorable  destination  for  industries \nrelocating from the coast. \n\n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  provided  technical  assistance  to  help  prepare  the  project.  ADB.  2011.  Technical \n\nAssistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Anhui Intermodal Sustainable Transport Project. Manila. \n\n3  In 2011\u20132012, Anhui had a GDP per capita of $4,200, much lower than those of the adjacent provinces of Jiangsu \n\n($11,000) and Zhejiang ($10,200). \n\n\fXuancheng  is  developing  an  industrial  park  to  capitalize  on  Anhui\u2019s  comparative \n6. \nadvantages and to attract industries that are seeking to move from neighboring provinces.4 For \nthe city and the WDZ to succeed in these efforts, however, the Xuancheng industrial park and \nthe WDZ need to be served by a well-developed transport network. \n\n7. \nAnhui\u2019s inadequate transport network is currently a major obstacle to rapid industrial and \neconomic  development  and,  as  a  result,  to  poverty  reduction.  The  capacity  and  quality  of  the \nprovince\u2019s roads need significant improvement to meet growing requirements and to link Anhui \nto the Yangtze River corridor. Most roads have only two lanes and some should be upgraded to \nfour  or  six.  Of  the  149,535  km  of  roads  at  the  end  of  2011,  expressways  and  high-standard \nclass  I  and  II  highways  comprised  only  9.5%  (14,276  km),  which  is  lower  than  the  national \naverage of 11.5%. The percentage of paved roads provides an indication of the general quality \nof  the  road  infrastructure,  and  in  Anhui  this  is  lower  than  in  the  six  surrounding  provinces \n(44.2%). \n\n8. \nAny  expansion  of  the  province\u2019s  road  network  must  be  accompanied  by  carefully \ndesigned  measures  to  enhance  the  level  of  road  safety  and  prevent  traffic  accidents. \nParticularly  important  is  the  need  for  road  designs  to  contribute  to  the  safety  of  NMT  by \nproviding segregated pedestrian and cycling lanes. An estimated 210,000 crashes led to 62,000 \ntraffic  fatalities  in  the  PRC  in  2011,  making  road  safety  a  national  concern.  Accidents  and \ninjuries  have risen  rapidly  along  with the  expansion  of the  road  network and the growth in the \nnumber  of  motor  vehicles.  During  2000\u20132005,  more  than  600,000  people  were  killed  and \naround  3  million  injured  in  crashes\u2014equivalent  to  a  fatality  every  5  minutes.  These  accidents \nare  estimated  to  have  affected  the  lives  of  more  than  20  million  people  in  the  country,  either \ndirectly  or  as  family  members  of  the  victims  involved.  The  most  vulnerable  road  users\u2014\npedestrians, motorcyclists, and cyclists\u2014account for the majority of deaths. \n\n9. \nLike  the  PRC  in  general,  Anhui  has  great  potential  for  the  development  of  inland \nwaterway  transport  (IWT),  which  is  clean,  safe,  and  the  most  energy-efficient  of  all  the  major \nmodes  of  transport.  The  PRC  has  more  than  5,600  navigable  rivers  and  an  inland  waterway \nsystem of 119,000 km in total navigable length. IWT can provide a cost-effective alternative to \nroad  transport  for  moving  freight,  and  thereby  help  alleviate  the  traffic  congestion  on  the \ncountry\u2019s highways, reduce energy consumption, and avoid rapidly growing emissions that are \nexacerbating  local  air  pollution  and  contributing  to  global  climate  change.  Despite  recent  fast \ngrowth, IWT is still greatly underused. Its share in total transport in the PRC, measured in ton-\nkilometers, was only 4% in 2008. \n\n10.  Most  of  the  PRC\u2019s  navigable  waterway  network  is  located  within  the  courses  of  the \nHeilongjiang, Huaihe, Yangtze, and Zhujiang rivers. The Yangtze River and its tributaries alone \naccount  for  one-half  the  national  total,  or  58,000  km.  The  Yangtze  runs  through  Anhui,  and \nprovides  a  high-class  deep  river  channel  for  IWT.  Its  network  of  small  associated  river  and \ntributary  channels  also  offer  potential  for  IWT,  but  past  underinvestment  in  navigation  has  left \nmany of them navigable only by small vessels during the wet season. Investments to upgrade \nthe river channels to enable year-round IWT by larger vessels at lower unit operating costs can \nplay  an  important  role  in  achieving  the  WDZ\u2019s  aim  of  attracting  industries  from  coastal  and \nneighboring provinces to cities along the Yangtze in Anhui. \n\n                                                \n4  The  development  of  Xuancheng  industrial  park  is  supported  by  a  World  Bank  loan.  World  Bank.  2013.  China\u2013 \n\nAnhui Xuancheng Infrastructure for Industry Relocation Project. Washington, DC. \n\n2 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe  44  km  Shuiyang  River  channel  connects  the  Xuancheng  industrial  park  within  the \n11. \nWDZ  to  the  Wushen  Canal,5 which  in  turn  connects  to  Shanghai.  This  would  offer  potential \ninvestors in the industrial park the effective transport route they want and need, except that the \nShuiyang\u2019s  current  shallow  depth,  sharp  bends,  and flooding  during the  wet  season  prevent  it \nfrom accommodating vessels above a very low capacity of 300 deadweight ton (dwt). This not \nonly discourages more extensive use of the waterway, but also increases unit transport costs for \nshippers  that  have  no  better  option.  Rehabilitation  of  the  Shuiyang  River  channel  under  the \nproject will allow passage for vessels of up to 1,000 dwt, and provide a much shorter route for \ntransporting  goods  from  Anhui  to  the  Yangtze  River  Delta.6 The  river  port  to  be  built  by  the \nproject will facilitate a shift from road to inland waterway transport for cargo moving to and from \nthe Xuancheng industrial park. \n\nBy supporting IWT, the project will also help the PRC develop the low-carbon transport \n12. \nmodes  needed  to  stem  the  rapid  growth  in  the  country\u2019s  emissions  that  contribute  to  global \nclimate  change.  The  PRC  is  now  the  world\u2019s  largest  producer  of  greenhouse  gases.  These \nemissions,  including  those  related  to  constantly  expanding  use  of  motorized  transport,  will \ncontinue to increase for the foreseeable future. Given the priority accorded to the challenge of \nclimate  change  internationally,  providing  assistance  to  the  country  for  developing  low-carbon \ntransport  is  a matter  of urgency. The  project\u2019s  planned flood control measures,  including flood \nwalls  and  river  bank  protection,  integrate  protection  and  resilience  into  the  design  and \nconstruction of vulnerable infrastructure investments. This will meet the need to adapt to effects \nof  climate change  such  as  changing  precipitation  patterns,  more frequent  and  intense  storms, \nand flash floods. \n\nThe scope of the project\u2019s inland waterway component and the need for it to include an \n13. \nintermodal  port  at  Xuancheng  to  serve  the  industrial  park  emerged  from  policy  dialogue \nbetween  ADB  and  the  government  during  project  preparation.  The  project  preparation  also \nincluded a study on climate change resilience, which helped in identifying the need for project \nflood  protection  works  and  developing  preliminary  designs  of  embankments  on  the  Shuiyang \nRiver. Assessments of the project roads led to recognition of the road safety issues that are to \nbe  addressed  through  the  project\u2019s  design  features,  which  will  include  segregated  lanes  for \npedestrians and cyclists. \n\n14. \nThis will be the second ADB project to support IWT in the PRC, and follows approval in \n2012  of  the  Hunan  Xiangjiang  Inland Waterway  Transport  Project,  now  in  the  early  stages  of \nimplementation.7 The project design incorporates lessons from recent road projects in the PRC, \none  of  which  was  the  need  to  include  capacity  building  support  for  implementation  units, \nparticularly in procurement and safeguards.8 During project preparation, ADB provided guidance \nto the executing agency and the implementing agencies on ADB\u2019s safeguards and procurement \nprocedures.  Further  capacity  building  on  resettlement  is  planned  for  the  project  implementing \nagencies. \n\n15. \nThe project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC for 2011\u2013\n2015.9 The emphasis on traffic safety issues and the development of IWT are in line with ADB\u2019s \n\n                                                \n5  The Wushen  Canal  is  an  ancient  waterway  that  branches  off  from  the  Yangtze  River and  provides  a connection \n\nbetween the city of Wuhu in Anhui Province and Shanghai. \n\n6  The Yangtze River Delta comprises Shanghai, southern Jiangsu Province, and northern Zhejiang Province. \n7  ADB.  2012.

The existing foreign funds project management office of the APDOT will serve as the \nprovincial project management office, oversee overall project implementation, and represent the \nAPDOT.  Each  project  county  will  have  a  local  project  management  office  responsible  for  the \nday-to-day  implementation  of  individual  project  road  components.  The  county  governments  of \nDongzhi, Hanshan, Hexian, Nanling, and Wuwei will be the implementing agencies for the road \nsector  outputs.  Anhui  Provincial  Port  and  Shipping  Construction  Investment  Group  will  be  the \nimplementing agency for the IWT output. The project will be implemented over 5 years.  \n \n28. \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended from  time  to  time).  All  consultant  services \nwill  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as \namended from time to time).

Retroactive  financing  will  apply  to  all  the  road  network \nimprovement,  the  waterway  dredging  and  new  road  overbridge,  and  the \nroad safety audit consulting services. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2012,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and \ndetailed arrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \n\n$0.2 million \n$0.5 million \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  APG  =  Anhui  provincial  government,  APDOT  =  Anhui  provincial  department  of \ntransport,  APPSCIG  =  Anhui  Provincial  Port  and  Shipping  Construction  Investment  Group,  IWT  =  inland  waterway \ntransport. \nNote: The contract value estimates exclude contingency costs. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n29. \nThe  designs  for  project  roads  and  highways  will  be  based  on  the  PRC\u2019s  highway \nstandards,  with  some  adjustments,  particularly  for  safety  features.  Road  safety  audits  will  be \nconducted on the detailed designs and during and after construction to ensure compliance with \nrequired road safety standards. Based on performance on past projects, the technical capacity \nof the executing and implementing agencies is considered adequate to implement the project\u2019s \ntechnical aspects. The design of the project\u2019s IWT output was also found to be appropriate and \ntechnically sound. The PRC has considerable experience and proven performance in the design \nand installation of similar facilities. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n30. \nEconomic  evaluation. The project is economically viable, with an estimated economic \ninternal  rate of return of  16.7%  and  a  net  present  value  of  $194.7 million at  a  12.0%  discount \nrate. The estimate was based on the four transport-related outputs for which economic benefits \ncould be quantified. The estimated costs include investment in civil works and equipment, land \nacquisition  and  resettlement,  and  operation  and  maintenance.  The  estimated  benefits  include \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fsavings in the costs of operating vehicles, travel time, traffic accidents, and the carbon dioxide \nemissions to be avoided when freight shifts from road transport to IWT as a result of the project. \nSensitivity analysis employing scenarios of cost overruns and benefit reductions demonstrated \nthat the project\u2019s economic viability is robust. \n\n31. \nFinancial  evaluation.  The  project  has  both  revenue-generating  and  nonrevenue \ncomponents. The nonrevenue components include the road network upgrades. The government \nhas  confirmed  that  none  of  the  project  roads  will  be  subject  to  tolls.  The  financial  analysis \nassessed  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  road  components  and  found  that  the  executing \nagency  will  have  sufficient  revenues  to  repay  the  loan  and  finance  the  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  the  project  roads.  The  inland  waterway  and  port  components  will  generate \nrevenue.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  after  tax  was  estimated  to  be  2.49%.  As  the \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  is  higher  than  the  1.89%  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  the \ninland waterway and port components are considered financially viable. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n32. \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). The relevant sections of \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  procurement \ndocuments and contracts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment,  the  executing  agency,  and  the  implementing  agencies.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \nAn assessment of financial management capacity indicates that the executing and implementing \nfinancial \nagencies  carefully \nmanagement. The executing agency has strong accounting and financial management capacity, \nas well as experience in managing multiple large construction projects. \n\nfollow  PRC  policies  and  procedures \n\nfor  accounting  and \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n33. \nA  social  and  poverty  analysis  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.  Per \ncapita  GDP  in  Anhui  province  was  only  69%  of  the  national  average  in  2010.  One  of  the  19 \nstate-level poor counties in the province\u2014Wuwei County\u2014lies within the project area. Poverty \nincidence  in  the  project  area  is  13.29%,  based  on  the  current  national  rural  poverty  line  of \nCNY2,300.15 Inadequate road infrastructure  is  a major  obstacle  to  economic  development  and \npoverty  reduction  in  Anhui.  The  project  will  result  in  better  road  connectivity,  reduce  several \ntransport-related  costs,  cut  travel  times,  and  improve  access  to  economic  and  employment \nopportunities  and  social  services.  The  project  design  addresses  the  needs  of  all  social  and \nincome groups through specific features to improve public transport and NMT. Its measures to \nimprove  road  safety  further  strengthen  the  design\u2019s  social  inclusiveness.  The  project  will \nstimulate  investment  in  the  project  area,  promote  industrial  growth,  and  open  up  new \nopportunities  for  nonfarm  employment.  Local  people  will  directly  benefit  through  access  to \nskilled and unskilled employment created during project construction. \n \nE. \n \n34. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  category  A  for  environment.  An  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA) and an environmental management plan (EMP) have been prepared for the \nproject  roads  and  the  waterway.  These  documents  comply  with  the  PRC\u2019s  regulatory \n                                                \n15 Rural poverty line was raised to CNY 2,300 per capita in year 2011. \n \n\nSafeguards \n\n8 \n \n\n \n\n\frequirements  and  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  were  disclosed  on  the  ADB \nwebsite  on  31  July  2013.  Public  consultation  was  carried  out  to  inform  the  design  and  EIA \nprocesses,  and  will  continue  throughout  project  implementation.  The  EIA  showed  that  only \nmodest  environmental  impacts  and  risks  can  be  expected,  and  that  they  can  be  limited  to  an \nacceptable level  through  the  implementation  of the  EMP  and compliance with loan covenants. \nThe  EMP  addresses  potential  impacts  of  the  project  outputs  and  sets  out  mitigation  and \nmonitoring  measures,  institutional  arrangements,  training  requirements,  and  a  budget  for \nimplementing  the  EMP  that  represents  1.95%  of  the  overall  project  budget.  Capacity \ndevelopment  and  institutional  strengthening  are  planned  to  minimize  environmental  risks. \nEnvironmental complaints will be handled through a grievance redress mechanism established \nfor  the  project.  Key  environmental  impacts,  risks,  and  the  associated  mitigation measures  are \npresented in the EIA.16 \n \n35. \nResettlement.  The  project  is  category  A  for  involuntary  resettlement.  It  will  result  in \nacquisition  of  285.1  hectares  of  land,  including  251.7  hectares  of  collective  land  and  33.5 \nhectares  of  state-owned  land.  Land  acquisition  and  house  demolition  will  affect  4,408 \nhouseholds and  17,342 people  overall.  Of this  total,  877  households  and  3,605  people  will  be \naffected by house demolition. The project will also result in relocation of 33 enterprises, affecting \n111  persons.  A  total  of  2,496  households  with  9,584  people  will  be  affected  by  physical \ndisplacement or loss of more than 10% of their land and other productive assets. \n \n36. \nThe  executing  agency  will  oversee  resettlement  implementation.  It  has  considerable \nexperience  in  ADB  safeguards  procedures,  is  executing  an  ongoing  ADB-financed  transport \nproject, and has previously implemented three World Bank projects. The implementing agencies \nwill  assist  with  day-to-day  resettlement  implementation.  Five  resettlement  plans  have  been \nprepared that adequately address the potential impacts of land acquisition and resettlement and \nset out mitigation measures, including livelihood restoration. The resettlement plans have been \nprepared in consultation with the affected people. Public consultations were undertaken  during \nproject preparation and will continue throughout the project cycle, as per the public consultation \nschedule  under  the  resettlement  plans.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  established to \naddress the concerns of affected peoples. The resettlement plans have been endorsed by the \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies,  disclosed  to  the  affected  peoples,  and  posted  on  the \nADB website. Resettlement implementation will also be monitored through independent external \nmonitors. \n \n37. \nThe executing agency has assured ADB that adequate counterpart funding will be made \navailable  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  in  line  with  the  annual  funding  requirements \nstipulated in the resettlement plans. \n\nIndigenous people. The project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples. Han \n\n38. \nChinese, the PRC\u2019s majority ethnic group, make up 99% of Anhui Province\u2019s population. \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.17 \n\n                                                \n16 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\n10 \n \n\nRisks \nProcurement could be delayed. \n\nDelays may occur in the provision of \ncounterpart funding. \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe  PPMO  will  hire  an  external  procurement  agency  to \nhandle  all  bidding.  Training  in  ADB  procedures  will  be \nprovided  by  an  ADB  procurement  specialist  during  loan \npreparation,  and  further  training  will  be  conducted  during \nimplementation.  \nThe  fiscal  situation  of  the  executing  agency  has  been \nassessed  and  found  to  be  adequate  for  project  financing. \nThrough a loan assurance, the Anhui provincial government \nhas agreed to ensure timely provision of counterpart funding. \nIn  liaison  with  the  executing  agency  and  the  implementing \nagencies,  the  PPMO  will  closely  monitor \nthe  funding \nrequirements of the project components.  \nAn  inter-provincial  agreement  between  Anhui  and  Jiangsu \nprovinces  has  been  signed  according  to  which  Jiangsu \nprovince has  agreed  to carry out  the  work of upgrading the \nportion of the river within its boundaries. \n\nLack of interprovincial coordination may \ndelay the upgrading of the portion of the \nShuiyang River channel in Jiangsu \nprovince and reduce the overall project \nbenefits.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PPMO = provincial project management office. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n40. \nThe government and the APDOT have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n\nThe  government  and  the  APDOT  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \n\n41. \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n42. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$200,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Anhui Intermodal Sustainable Transport \nProject,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 23 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n\n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n \n \n\n 31 January 2014\n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n\nReporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \n\nAssumptions \nTraffic law enforcement is \neffective.  \n \nThe WDZ develops as \nplanned by the national \ngovernment. \n \n \n\nAssumption \nWork to improve sections \nof the Wushen Canal is \ncompleted. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\nData Sources and \n\n \nAnhui Provincial \nDepartment of Transport \nstatistics \n \n \n \n \nAnhui Provincial \nDepartment of Public \nSecurity \n \n\n \nData from Anhui Provincial \nPort and Shipping \nConstruction Investment \nGroup Co.
