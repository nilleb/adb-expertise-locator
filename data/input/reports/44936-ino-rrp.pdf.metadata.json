The  participating  banks  will  receive  long-term \nfunding from ADB in the form of fixed-rate, rupiah-denominated senior \nloans  for  up  to  10  years  for  the  purpose  of  mortgage  onlending.  The \nrupiah  funds  will  be  offered  on  a  fixed-rate  basis,  which  will  enable \nbanks  to  offer  a  new  mortgage  product  in  the  market,  the  fixed-rate \nmortgage.  Program  parameters  have  been  established  to  ensure  that \nparticipating  banks  provide  mortgage  loans  on  a  prudent  basis  to \nunderserved  segments.  ADB\u2019s  investment  committee  will  approve \nparticipating  banks  under  the  program  for  a  period  of  no  more  than  2 \nyears  from  Board  approval  of  the  program.  TA,  as  described  below, \nand  individual  loan  disbursements  could  occur  after  the  expiration  of \nthis period. \n \nEligible private commercial banks. \n\n \nFinancial \nIntermediaries \n \nDevelopment Impact  The  development  impact  of  the  proposed  project  is  expected  to  be \nhigh.  The  primary  development  impacts  are  noted  below.  Additional \ndevelopment impacts, such as contribution to Millennium Development \nGoals and gender promotion, are provided in the text. \n  \nImpact. The Housing Finance Program, aligned with Strategy 2020 and \nADB\u2019s objective to support the growth of finance sectors in developing \nmember countries, will (i) deepen and broaden the Indonesian financial \nsector through development of the housing finance subsector, which is \nneeded \nfinancial  products,  and \nstrengthen  it  through  the  ADB  TA  that  will  help  participating  banks \nimprove  mortgage  lending  skills,  thereby  enabling  them  to  lend  to \n\nimprove  access \n\nto  standard \n\nto \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nProposed ADB \nAssistance \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating \nMeasures \n\npeople of lower income classes; (ii) address Indonesia\u2019s urban housing \nshortage, which is estimated at a current backlog of 8.1 million homes \nwith  a  need  for  approximately  800,000  additional  homes  annually  for \nthe next 20 years; and (iii) contribute to gross domestic product growth \nand  job  generation  (particularly  for  unskilled  laborers  in  the  country\u2019s \nconstruction  industry  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  sector) \nand  catalyze  economic  activities  estimated  at  $290  million  in  forward- \nand backward-linking industries. \n \nOutcome.  ADB\u2019s  funding  will  result  in  an  increased  level  of  housing \nfinance availed of by households, which will generate economic activity. \n   \nOutputs.  Outputs  include  participating  banks  having  access  to  fixed \nrate,  long-term  funds  for  mortgage  onlending,  which  will  enable  these \nbanks  to  increase  their  mortgage  lending  activities  and  offer  new \nmortgages. An important output of this project will be completion of the \nTA  by  each  participating  bank  and  the  application  of  the  principles \nlearned.  \n \nThe  proposed  $300  million  rupiah-equivalent  program  will  be  sourced \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and then converted to rupiah by \nentering  into  cross-currency  swaps.  ADB  will  then  provide  10-year \nfixed-rate rupiah financing to participating banks. Loans to participating \nbanks  will  carry  interest  rates  based  on  the  cost  of  funds,  as  well  as \nmargins as determined by ADB\u2019s investment committee. The committee \nwill also determine up-front and commitment fees in respect of the loans \nto the participating banks.  \n \nThe  Housing  Finance  Program  will  also  consist  of  TA  for  each \nparticipating  bank.  The  TA  will  be  provided  under  the  existing  TA  for \nHousing Finance Capacity Development in South and Southeast Asia. \n(TA  7469).  The  objective  of  this  TA  is  to  help  banks  strengthen \nmortgage lending practices, thereby improving institutional capacity and \nenabling banks to reach lower-income customers. \n \nComprehensive due diligence conducted by ADB to gauge the viability \nof the proposed program determined the overall risks to be acceptable \nfor  a  transaction  of  this  kind.  The  key  risks  identified  are  (i)  market \nuptake,  (ii)  underdeveloped  mortgage  lending  practices,  (iii)  the \navailability  of  competitively  priced  local  currency  funding,  and  (iv)  the \ncredit risk of participating banks, including potential weakening of asset \nquality as banks move down market to lower-income borrowers.  \n \nThe aforementioned risks are mitigated by the following considerations: \n  \n\n(i) \n\nRegarding  market  uptake,  banks  have  increasingly  offered \nadjustable rate mortgages with fixed-rate components of 1\u2013\n3 years due to demand for the fixed-rate product. Consumer \nstudies and housing industry experts have also identified the \nneed  for  a  fixed-rate  mortgage  product.  Additionally,  ADB\u2019s \nTA  will  help  participating  banks  better  develop  other  new \nproducts and market this new fixed-rate product.  \n\n\fiii \n\n(ii) \n\nGiven that banks have restricted mortgage lending largely to \nthe  upper  and  upper-middle  classes,  ADB\u2019s  TA  will  help \nparticipating  banks  develop  more  robust  mortgage  lending \npractices,  including  risk  management,  to  better  serve  self-\nemployed and lower-income borrowers.  \n\n(iv) \n\n(iii)  With  respect  to  local  currency  funding,  ADB  currently  has \nthe  option  of  sourcing  local  currency  funding  through  the \ncross-currency swap market and may at a later date be able \nto  issue  a  local  currency  bond.  ADB  will  pursue  the  most \ncost-effective  financing  available  at  the  time  that  funds  are \nrequired to be disbursed.   \nPertaining  to  the  credit  risk  of  participating  banks,  and \nspecifically  the  risk  of  weakening  asset  quality  as  banks \nexpand  into  broader  and  lower-income  customer  segments \nwith  new  products,  program  parameters  have  been \nestablished  that  strike  a  balance  between  down  market \npenetration  and  maintenance  of  portfolio  quality.  Moreover, \nthe  banking  sector  and,  particularly  mortgage  loans,  has \nperformed  well  even  through  this  latest  financial  crisis.  \nAdditionally,  ADB\u2019s  TA  will  help  participating  banks \nstrengthen credit assessment and risk management skills.  \n\n \nJustification for the program is based on the following considerations: \n\n(i)   \n\n (ii) \n\nLack of access to long-term local currency funding. The \nprogram  will  provide  systemic  support  to  the  Indonesian \nfinance  sector  at  a  critical  point  in  its  development.  Access \nto  long-term  rupiah  funds,  particularly  at  fixed  rates,  is \nlimited and is needed to expand the housing finance market \nand to improve broader access to financial products.  \nInnovative  intervention  to  develop  the  housing  finance \nmarket. The program will play a pioneering role in enabling \nparticipating  banks  to  offer  a  new  type  of  mortgage  loan\u2014\nthe  fixed-rate  mortgage\u2014which  will  improve  access  to \nfinance \nthe \nfor  a  broader  segment  of  consumers \nIndonesian  market  and  help  the  banks  to  move  down \nmarket.  \n\nin \n\nbuilding \n\n (iii)  Capacity  building  technical  assistance.

The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  presented  in \nAppendix 1; the summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 2. \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Sector Background1 \n\nGeneral.  Compared  to  global  and  regional  standards,  Indonesia\u2019s  financial  sector  is \n2. \nunderdeveloped. The size of the finance sector is equivalent to only slightly more than 100% of \ngross domestic product (GDP), which is considerably less than the size of the financial sectors \nin large Asian economies such as India, where the equivalent figure is 300%, and the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, where the figure is 500%.2 With a limited number of pension funds, insurance \ncompanies,  and  nonbanking  institutions,  Indonesia\u2019s  financial  sector  is  characterized  by  the \ndominance of the banking industry, which controls about 80% of assets in the financial system \n(footnote  2).  Despite  a  high  number  of  commercial  banks  operating  in  this  sector,  10  banks \ncontrol about 64% of total assets in the system3, and four large state-owned commercial banks \nown about 36% of the assets in the banking industry.4  \n \n3. \nLimited services and reach. Although Indonesia is well served in terms of number of \nbanks (some of which have been operating for decades), the sector is still shallow, with limited \nreach  and  services.  For  instance,  mortgage  lending,  a  fundamental  activity  of  commercial \nbanking sector in many countries, is very underdeveloped. At the end of June 2010, mortgage \nloans  represented  only  about  8%  of  aggregate  commercial  bank  loan  portfolios  (footnote  3). \nCompared  with  developed  countries  such  as  Canada,  where  mortgage  loans  comprise  about \n40%  of  banks'  total  lending  portfolios,  this  is  quite  low.5  In  the  aftermath  of  the  1997  Asian \nfinancial  crisis, \nin  short-term,  higher-yielding  deposit \ncertificates  provided  by  Bank  Indonesia,  which  provides  them  with  a  steady  flow  of  low-risk \nincome. Today, the International Monetary Fund estimates that banks hold 23% of their assets \nin  Bank  Indonesia  or  government  bonds,  which  is  higher  than  international  norms.6  Bank \nIndonesia (the central bank and regulator), however, is seeking to address this issue and boost \nbank lending to the real sector and has recently announced a new regulation pertaining to bank \nloan-to-deposit ratios, setting it at between 78%\u2013100% effective from 1 March 2011.7 Coupled \nwith  a  lack  of  access  to  long-term  funding,  banks  have  restricted  the  aggregate  amount  of \nlending and have generally catered to large wealthy firms and individuals.8 As a result, financial \n\nIndonesian  banks  have \n\ninvested \n\n                                                 \n1   An economic overview of Indonesia has been provided in Appendix 4. \n2  World Bank. 2009.

Indonesian bank credit is also restricted in the private \nsector and is among the lowest of its regional comparators at approximately 26.5% of GDP in \n2008, as compared to 51.4% in India and 90.6% in Viet Nam.9  \n \n4. \nRecent  performance.  The  direct  impact  on  the  Indonesian  banking  sector  from  the \nglobal financial crisis was minimized due to limited exposure to global financial assets, stricter \nlending  rules  imposed  by  Bank  Indonesia,  and  efforts  by  the  banks  to  bolster  their  respective \ncapital positions. Key performance indicators in the Indonesian banking industry exhibit positive \nlevels of growth in 2009 and 2010 in aggregate loans and deposits, albeit at slower rates. Fitch \nRatings expects the financial performance of Indonesian banks to improve throughout 2010 due \nto the more favorable macroeconomic outlook and lower credit costs as loan quality continues \nto improve (Appendix 3 provides detailed information on the banking industry). \n \n5. \nHousing  finance  subsector  overview.  A  well-developed  housing  finance  market  is \ncritical  for  both  the  financial  (banks,  nonbank  financial  institutions,  and  bond  markets)  and \nhousing  sectors.10  In  the  case  of  Asia,  the  region's  housing  finance  markets  are  quite \nunderdeveloped. As such, the urgent housing needs of many of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s)  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  are  unmet.  The  mortgage  debt-to-GDP  ratio,  a \nmeasure of the depth of a country's housing finance market, is well below 15% in a number of \ncountries  (Figure  1).  This  statistic  is  particularly  striking  when  compared  to  other  emerging \nmarket  regions.  For  example,  the  average  mortgage  debt-to-GDP  ratio  in  South  Asia  is  2.9%, \nand  in  East  Asia  and  the  Pacific  it  is  only  1.5%.  This compares  with  a  mortgage  debt-to-GDP \nratio of 7% in Latin America and the Caribbean and 11% in sub-Saharan Africa.11 Indonesia's \nmortgage market, strikingly, is one of the least developed in Asia at approximately 2% of GDP. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, PRC = People's Republic of China. \nSources: Nenova, T.  2010. \u201cExpanding Housing Finance to the Underserved in South Asia. \nMarket Review and Forward\u201d.

Jakarta, 27\u201329 May. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n \n\napproximately 29%, is PT Bank Tabungan Negara (Persero) Tbk (BTN), which is a government-\nowned  housing  bank  that  provides  mortgages  largely  on  a  subsidized  basis  primarily  to  lower \nincome  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  lower-middle  income  borrowers.12  Before  the  Asian  financial \ncrisis,  BTN  dominated  the  mortgage  market,  holding  about  80%  of  outstanding  mortgage \naccounts and approximately 50% of the outstanding loan amounts. However, in the aftermath of \nthe  crisis  and  with  BTN\u2019s  subsequent  need  to  restructure,  its  control  of  the  market  diminished \nand private sector banks became more active in the mortgage market as they began to respond \nto  consumer  demand.13  Bank  Central  Asia  is  the  second-largest  mortgage  provider  with  an \napproximate market share of 12%, closely followed by PT Bank CIMB Niaga Tbk (CIMB Niaga) \nat about 10.5%, PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk (Bank Mandiri) at approximately 9.0%, and PT \nBank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk (BNI) with a market share of about 7.5%. Between BTN, \nBNI,  and  Bank  Mandiri,  the  government  has  a  mortgage  market  share  through  ownership  of \nthese banks of approximately 45.5%.  \n \n7. \nMortgage  lending  practices  are  generally  conservative.    As  a  result,  mortgage  loans  in \nthe nonsubsidized sector have performed relatively well, with low levels of nonperforming loans \n(NPLs). Mortgage loans are offered on an 8-, 10-, 15-, or 20-year basis; however, the average \nloan tenor is 7\u20138 years. The actual loan tenor indicates that, while banks may advertise longer \ntenor  loans,  the  practice  is  to  provide  shorter-term  loans.  Down  payments  range  from  20%  to \n30% of the property cost, but can vary significantly depending upon the type of borrower. With \nrespect to geographic concentration, about 50%\u201360% of banks\u2019 mortgage portfolios are located \nin the greater Jakarta area. This is due primarily to high demand and developer activity in this \narea. Additionally, NPLs, as noted by banks, tend to be lower in the greater Jakarta area.  \n \nWhile banks provide mortgages with a number of different features, the basic product in \n8. \nthe  nonsubsidized  market  is  the  adjustable-rate  mortgage  (ARM).  ARMs  are  not  capped  and \nrates  are  adjusted  at  the  discretion  of  the  lender  and  not  linked  to  a  cost  of  funds  index.  In \n2004/2005, banks offered mortgage loans with a fixed-rate period of 1 year, which then reset to \na  floating  rate  loan  for  the  remaining  tenor.  Today,  responding  to  the  demand  for  longer-term \nfixed-rate loans, banks offer mortgage loans with 1\u20133 year fixed-rate periods, which then reset \nto ARMs for the remainder of the life of the loan. In the Islamic banking market, banks do offer \nmortgage products that are similar to fixed-rate loans. However, Islamic banking in Indonesia is \nstill quite new and represents about 2%\u20133% of banking assets. Thus, volumes of these types of \nmortgages are very low (footnote 2).14 It is important to note that the fixed-rate ARM products \nare  generally  not  matched  by  fixed-rate  funding  for  the  banks,  which  creates  a  risk  for  the \nbanks.  With  respect  to  interest  rates,  there  has  been  a  decrease  from  a  high  of  16%\u201318%  in \n2005 to about 9%\u201312% currently. There is no risk-based pricing in the market, as interest rates \nare typically set according to product based on a margin and cost of funds.  \n \n9. \nAs  a  result  of  the  shallow  banking  sector  and  underdeveloped  housing  finance \nsubsector,  mortgage  lending  is  quite  restrictive  and  is  targeted  to  a  bifurcated  borrower  base.  \nHigher  income  clients  have  been  serviced  by  the  commercial  banks,  while  lower  income \nborrowers are assisted by BTN.  As a result, UN-HABITAT estimates that only the top 30% of \npeople  in  Indonesia  have  access  to  mortgages  (footnote  13).    Thus,  there  is  a  large  group  of \npeople who could afford mortgages, but who do not currently have access to them.   \n \n\n                                                 \n12 BTN\u2019s average mortgage loan is approximately Rp50 million.

There  are  many \n\nthe \n10. \nunderdevelopment  of  the  housing  finance  market  in  Indonesia.15  In  the  past,  these  have \nincluded macroeconomic volatility, the dominance of BTN and its subsidized lending practices, \nthe impact of the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis, and a weak regulatory framework surrounding \nproperty and foreclosure. Today, the key constraints to the expansion of the mortgage market \ninclude  a  number  of  factors.  Down  payments  for  home  purchases  can  be  high  for  average \nincome  borrowers.    In  emerging  markets  in  particular,  borrowers  have  difficulty  accumulating \nfunds for down payments on homes. Indonesia also has some of the highest transaction costs \nrelated to home purchases in the region.16 Consumer information is also not easily obtainable or \ndocumented.  While  Bank  Indonesia  does  maintain  a  bad-debt  repository,  there  is  no  credit \nbureau with robust consumer data (the International Finance Corporation is currently providing \ntechnical assistance to develop a credit bureau). The appraisal industry is also underdeveloped, \nwith  banks  typically  undertaking  in-house  appraisals,  and  there  is  no  single  data  source  for \nintegrated  housing  information.  Land  registration  in  Indonesia  is  complex  and  somewhat \nconfusing. Foreclosure, while possible, is costly and can be lengthy in certain instances.  \n \n11. \n \n\nThe following are three issues, in particular, that have constrained market growth: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nLack  of  bank  access  to  long-term  funding.  Mortgage  loans  have  typically \nbeen offered on a shorter-term basis to all but the wealthiest borrowers because \nbanks have had access largely to short-term deposit bases. The capital markets \nhave  not  yet  become  a  major  source  of  longer-term  funding  for  banks. \nIndonesia's secondary  mortgage  finance  facility,  PT  Sarana  Multigriya  Finansial \n(Persero)  (SMF),  which  was  established  by  the  Government  in  2005  to  help \naddress  this  issue,  has  started  to  provide  financing  to  banks  through  bond \nissuances; however, the maximum tenor of funding is 5 years and the amounts \nare  small.  The  overall  effect  of  the  absence  of  long-term  funding  is  (a)  the \nborrower  base  for  mortgage  loans  is  limited  because  the  monthly  payments  on \nshort-term  loans  are  too  high  for  average  borrowers  to  assume,  and  (b)  banks \nhave a systemic risk in that they have an asset\u2013liability mismatch. \nPrevalence  of  adjustable-rate  mortgages.  Because  banks  have  had  limited \naccess  to  long-term  financing,  particularly  on  a  fixed-rate  basis,  and  due  to \nvolatile  interest  rates  and  a  higher  inflationary  environment  in  the  past,  ARMs \nand  fixed-rate  ARMs  dominate  the  market.  ARMs  are  the  most  prevalent \nmortgage  loan  product  in  the  world  and  there  are  many  variations  on  the  ARM \nstructure. In Indonesia, because ARMs are not capped, the entire risk of interest \nrate fluctuation is placed on the borrower and, as noted, at the discretion of the \nlender. This risk is compounded because borrowers may not fully understand the \nnature of ARMs due to a lack of consumer education in the market. Thus, banks \nare  more  conservative  in  their  underwriting  and  the  volume  of  mortgage \noriginations  remains  low  due  to  concerns  regarding  higher  borrower  risk  and, \nconversely, because borrowers are hesitant to take such risk.  \n\n                                                 \n15 Hoek-Smit, M.C. 2007.

Since banks have limited access to \nmortgages \nIndonesia,  mortgage \nunderwriting and servicing skills could be strengthened and standardized. Banks \nhave  not  had \nto  develop  more  robust  borrower  analysis  and  portfolio \nadministration  techniques  and  systems  that  would  normally  be  used  for \nborrowers from a variety of income segments. To respond to consumer demand \nand broaden access to mortgages, banks need to create different products and \nintroduce  a  wider  range  of  pricing  and  more  flexible  tools  for  assessing \nborrowers. \n \n\nin \n\n12. \nImpact  on  Indonesia\u2019s  housing  supply.  In  Indonesia,  as  well  as  in  many  emerging \nmarket  countries,  housing  shortages  can  be  directly  linked  to  a  lack  of  housing  finance.17  A \nmajority  of  people  must  have  access  to  loans  to  purchase  homes,  given  the  sizeable \ninvestment.  Often,  developers  have  had  to  provide  consumer  financing  from  their  own  funds \nbecause  traditional  bank  mortgage  lending  has  been  absent  or  limited.  This  constricts  the \nfunding  available  for  contractors  to  initiate  new  housing  developments.  In  countries  such  as \nMexico and Malaysia,  where the supply of housing finance was addressed early and over the \npast 15\u201320 years, competitive and active developer industries have evolved with deeper down \nmarket  penetration  (footnote  17).  While  other factors  affect  housing  supply,  such  as  legal  and \nregulatory  frameworks  pertaining  to  property  and  the  size  of  a  country\u2019s  real  estate  developer \nmarket,  housing  finance  has  been  shown  to  drive  a  chain  of  supply  reactions  in  land  and \nconstruction  markets  that  lead  to  the  creation  of  housing  stock  in  the  medium  term.18  New \nconstruction  is  stimulated  and  more  entrepreneurial  capacity  in  finance  and  construction \nindustries is developed.  \n \n13. \nIndonesia  is  experiencing  an  acute  housing  shortage.  The  government  estimates  that \nthere  is  a  current  backlog  of  8.1  million  houses  with  a  requirement  for  approximately  800,000 \nadditional  units  annually  for  the  next  20  years.19  With  attendant  problems  of  traffic  congestion \ndue to a lack of extensive public transportation networks and limited road space which has led \nto  high  levels  of  pollution,  many  of  Indonesia's  urban  areas  are  under  significant  stress. \nBetween  1995  and  2005,  the  urban  population  in  Indonesia  grew  by  55%,  which  explains  the \nmassive  demand  for  housing.20  Housing  shortages  are  expected  to  continue  to  grow  due  to \nrapid  urbanization,  strong  household  formation,  and  population  growth.  Jakarta  alone  is \nexpected  to  become  one  of  the  world\u2019s  21  mega  cities  by  2025.21  The  government  has \nhighlighted the importance of addressing urban housing problems as part of Indonesia\u2019s broader \nurban infrastructure challenges and its strategy for reducing slum proliferation and poverty.

A study conducted in 2005 noted that about 58% of \nhomeowners  in  Indonesia  built  their  own  house,  while  11%  bought  their  house  in  the  resale  market,  and  8% \npurchased a home from a developer (UN-HABITAT. 2008. Footnote 13). Some of the problems include access to \nconstruction finance, artificial and real scarcities of land, multiple permitting procedures, and lack of infrastructure \ndevelopment around residential properties.   \n\n19 Government of Indonesia, Ministry of People\u2019s Housing. 2008.

Because of low volumes of housing stock, many homes that \nwere  built  through  government-subsidized  programs  for  lower-income  classes  are  actually \ninhabited by people of higher-income classes. ADB and others have observed this occurrence \nand stated that, despite the intent of some of the government\u2019s large subsidy programs targeted \nat  low-income  earners,  of  the  houses  constructed  by  the  private  sector  almost  all  were \npurchased  by  middle-  and  high-income  market  segments.23  This  compression  in  the  housing \nmarket  has  contributed  to  slum  proliferation  throughout  large  urban  areas  in  Indonesia.  In \nsummary,  lower-income  people  are  currently  living  in  substandard  and  often  informal  housing \nthat exposes their families to pollution, poor sanitation, and the ever present threat of flooding, \nwhen they could have access to better quality housing if such housing was not already occupied \nby families of higher income levels.   \n \nGovernment  initiatives.  The  government  is  taking  steps  to  bolster  housing  stocks \n15. \nthrough addressing the regulatory framework pertaining to property. This is being supported in \npart  by  ADB  technical assistance  (TA)  designed  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  titling  system \nand to ease the process for obtaining land for infrastructure use, and through programs targeted \nat increasing the physical supply of housing and subsidizing mortgage lending for lower-income \ngroups.24  The  ambitious  1,000  Residential  Towers  program  is  the  government\u2019s  hallmark \nconstruction program that entails the development of apartment buildings in major urban areas \nby 2012. Despite these initiatives, much more needs to be done from both the public and private \nsectors to address growing housing shortages and urban problems in Indonesia. \n\nB. \n\n \nInvestment Identification and Selection \n\nGiven  the  underdeveloped  banking  sector  with  low  levels  of  mortgage  debt  and  the \n16. \ngrowing need for urban housing, coupled with a clear cultural preference by Indonesians to own \na home, ADB designed a program that would begin to help Indonesia address this growing gap. \nADB  also  reviewed  recent  research  and  consulted  with  housing  industry  experts  who  have \nstudied the Indonesian housing market over a  number of  years. Throughout the course of the \nprogram\u2019s development, ADB met with all of the largest nongovernment commercial banks to (i) \nascertain the obstacles or issues that have prevented the banks from serving a wider customer \nbase, (ii) assess interest in expanding to broader customer segments, and (iii) provide input as \nto  new  products  that  banks  could  offer  to  increase  access  to  mortgages.  Based  on  the \nconstraints  in  the  market  and  bank  feedback,  the  proposed  Housing  Finance  Program  uses  a \ntwo-pronged  approach  to  expand  access  to  housing  finance  and  maximize  developmental \nimpact through (i) the provision of long-term financing that would facilitate the introduction of a \nnew mortgage product, the fixed-rate mortgage (FRM); and (ii) TA to improve mortgage lending \npractices to facilitate penetration into lower-income market segments on a prudent basis.   \n \n \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n \nConsistency with Strategy 2020 \n\n1. \n\n                                                 \n22 The Jakarta Globe. 2010.

Moreover,  without  access  to  formal  financial  services,  the  poor  will  be \nexcluded  from  the  growth  process  and  its  benefits.  Under  Strategy  2020,25  ADB  seeks  to \nstrengthen  its  support  to  the  financial  sector  at  the  regional  and  national  levels  by  helping  to \ndevelop  financial  infrastructure,  institutions,  and  products  and  services  and  by  promoting \ninclusive growth. Through such initiatives, ADB will continue to assist in channeling the region's \nsavings  into  the  most  productive  investments,  as  well  as  continue  to  build  the  capacity  of \nfinancial  institutions  by  introducing  international  best  practices.  The  proposed  program \ncontributes to financial sector development through the deepening and broadening of mortgage \nlending  in  the  banking  system  of  Indonesia.  Financial  development  will  also  be  supported \nthrough  the  capacity  development  TA,  which  will  strengthen  the  mortgage  lending  capacity  of \nbanks and reduce operational risk in the banking sector.  \n \n18. \nUnder  Strategy  2020,  cities  constitute  a  key  focus,  specifically  in  terms  of  promoting \nlivable  cities  that  are  competitive  and  environmentally  attractive.  Cities  are  at  the  forefront  of \nADB\u2019s core strategic directions\u2014addressing the issues of urbanization, climate change, and the \nhuge infrastructure deficit in Asia. As part of ADB\u2019s draft urban operations plan and to address \nthe core objective of creating more livable cities, investments for housing and housing finance \nare  a  critical  component  of  inclusive  urban  development.  By  supporting  the  expansion  of \nIndonesia\u2019s  housing  finance  market,  which  will  enable  more  people  to  own  homes  and  will \nstimulate  housing  supply,  ADB  will  be  contributing  to  the  creation  of  more  livable  cities  in \nIndonesia. \n \n \n \n19. \nThe  Housing  Finance  Program  is  aligned  with  the  country  strategy  for  Indonesia.  The \nlatest Indonesia country strategy and program (CSP) for 2006\u2013200926 was developed to support \nthe  government's  overarching  goal  of  reducing  poverty  through  economic  growth  with  job \ncreation  and  accelerated  attainment  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  ADB \nidentified  the  following  five  areas  of  engagement:  (i)  better  infrastructure  and  infrastructure \nservices, (ii) a deeper financial sector, (iii) more decentralized government functions, (iv) quicker \nachievement  of  MDGs,  and  (v)  more  robust  management  of  the  environment  and  natural \nresources.  Governance  and  capacity  development,  both  institutional  and  human,  were  also \nidentified as key areas that ADB should support. The CSP identifies interventions in the finance \nsector  in  support  of  housing  finance  through  the  public  sector  in  terms  of  developing  the \nsecondary  mortgage  market  and  through  the  private  sector,  specifically  stating  that  potential \noperations  could  include  development  and  enhancement  of  the  mortgage  market.  Thus,  the \nproposed  program  is  in  line  with  financial  sector  development  through  the  broadening  of  the \nhousing finance market. Additionally, the program can help the country more quickly achieve its \nMDGs, as well as contribute to job generation, particularly for the poor, which will be discussed \nbelow in further detail. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nConsistency with Country Strategy  \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n25  ADB.  2008.

As  part  of  financial  sector \ndevelopment,  ADB  support  for  housing  finance  projects  is  embedded  in  a  number  of  key \nstrategic  documents  and  business  plans.    ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Development  Strategy  refers \nspecifically  to  ADB's  role  in  strengthening  the  finance  sector,  including  housing  finance,  in \nDMCs. PSOD\u2019s Capital Markets and Financial Sectors Division\u2019s 2010\u20132012 Business Plan and \nPriorities29  also  states  that  ADB  will  support  housing  finance  projects  as  one  of  the  major \ncomponents  for  a  healthy  financial  sector.    Finally,  ADB\u2019s  draft  Financial  Sector  Action  Plan \nhighlights the need to support housing finance projects as part of financial sector development \nin ADB\u2019s DMCs.  The Housing Finance Program is thus consistent with ADB\u2019s overall financial \nsector strategy in that it will assist in the development of a critical component of the Indonesian \nbanking sector that has been to date highly underdeveloped.  \n \n3. \n\nConsistency with Other Relevant ADB Operations \n\n21. \nADB  has  supported  projects  in  the  housing  and  housing  finance  markets  for  over  20 \nyears,  providing  approximately  $600  million  in  financing  and  TA  from  both  private  and  public \nsector  operations.  The  proposed  Housing  Finance  Program  complements  other  projects  that \nADB has supported to encourage the development of the housing sector in Indonesia. ADB has \nprovided TA to streamline and improve the legal and regulatory framework pertaining to land in \nIndonesia.  Through  this  TA,  ADB  is  assisting  Indonesia\u2019s  National  Land  Agency  (BPN)  to \nformulate land-related laws, including a draft land law that will, among other things, examine the \nissue of land rights and how it can be in line with international best practices (footnote 24).30 The \nTA  also  provided  assistance  to  the  government  to  prepare  a  new  draft  land  acquisition  law, \nwhich is expected to be submitted by the last quarter of 2010 to parliament for deliberation. This \ndraft law will attempt to ease the process for land acquisition in Indonesia to facilitate the growth \nof infrastructure projects in the country. ADB has also provided TA funding to establish SMF. As \nnoted, SMF has been increasingly able to lengthen the tenor of its funding to banks, but is still \nconstrained to 5 years. The Housing Finance Program fills a gap for long-term financing that is \nneeded in the market now. Developing a strong primary mortgage market, as supported through \nthis program, is needed for the growth of the country\u2019s secondary mortgage and capital markets. \nThe ADB TA will help to standardize mortgage  loans and reporting across the industry, which \nwill help SMF to securitize these mortgage loans at a later date. \n\n                                                 \n27 ADB. 2000.

The  development  impact  of  housing  finance  projects  can  be  high  because  of \ntheir  support  for  financial  sector  development,  creation  of  housing  supply,  contribution  to \neconomic  growth,  and  pro-poor  job  creation.  Because  of  this  importance,  the  former  Under-\nSecretary-General  of  the  United  Nations  and  Executive  Director  of  UN-HABITAT  forcefully \nnoted  that  \"housing  provision  is  so  central  to  social  and  economic  development  that \npolicymakers  need  to  act  on  this  rather  than  continue  to  treat  the  activity  as  a  mere  social \ngood.\"31 Given the substantial development impact, development finance institutions have been \nactively supporting projects in this sector for a number of years, some of which have elevated \nprojects in this field to one of institutional priority. \n \n23. \n \n\nThe development impacts of the program are expected to include the following: \n\n(i) \n\n \n\nDeepening  and  broadening  of  the  Indonesian  finance  sector.  The  program \nwill support the development of the Indonesian banking sector, which is needed \nto improve access to standard financial products and to support broad economic \ngrowth.  Indonesia  has  been  a  late  starter  in  the  development  of  a  modern \nhousing  finance  system,  which  is  evidenced  by  the  low  mortgage  debt-to-GDP \nratio,  and  has  been  constrained  by  a  number  of  factors,  which  have  been \ndiscussed above. As such, there is a critical need for interventions, such as the \nFRM  product,  to  help  widen  access  for  a  lower  income  market  segment.  Credit \nrisk will be reduced, in some instances, as customers will have surety of monthly \ninterest payments (unlike the present system with the prevalence of ARMs). By \nproviding longer-term funding, ADB will also help to reduce funding and liquidity \nrisks in banks, as banks currently extend longer-term loans based on short-term \ndeposits. Finally, the program will also help to boost overall bank lending, which \nhad slowed during the recent financial crisis, and will help banks comply with the \nnew Bank Indonesia loan-to-deposit requirement. \n\nOne  of  the  challenges  for  Asia  in  the  coming  years  is  to  achieve  balanced \ngrowth.  This  can  be  facilitated,  in  part,  through  channeling  the  high  rates  of \nAsia\u2019s  savings  into  Asian  investments.  Indonesia,  for  instance,  had  a  gross \ndomestic savings rate of 28.9% at the end of 2008.32 One solution to unlocking \nsavings is through investments in homes.  A vibrant housing finance market can \nalso  encourage  savings,  as  consumers  save  for  down  payments  and  loan \nrepayments.  These  actions  increase  both  the  assets  available  to  the  financial \nservices  sector  and  the  demand  for  more  financial  services,  which  creates  a \ndeeper financial sector. \n \nTA in the form of capacity development will also serve to strengthen the banking \nsector  and  expand  access  to  housing  finance.  Lessons  learned  from  the  U.S. \nsubprime  mortgage  crisis  show  that  a  large  part  of  the  challenge  in  maximizing \nthe  development  impact  of  housing  finance  for  emerging  market  countries  and \nensuring  financial  stability  lies  in  encouraging  basic  credit  precepts  so  that \n\n                                                 \n31 Tibaijuka,  A.

As  banks  gain  experience  and  learn  techniques  to  assess  the \ncreditworthiness  of  a  variety  of  borrowers  and  price  risk  accordingly,  they  are \nlikely to move to lower-income segments. Standardization of practices, which will \nbe  promoted  by  the  TA,  will  also  serve  to  help  lower  transaction  costs,  making \nmortgage financing more accessible, and improve data collection and reporting.  \nThis,  in  turn,  will  facilitate  the  creation  of  a  stronger  primary  mortgage  market, \nwhich will contribute to the growth of the country\u2019s capital markets. \n\nSustainability and demonstration effect. While ADB\u2019s program in terms of size \nis limited as compared to the overall needs of the market, the impact is expected \nto extend beyond the initial years of the program. First, the provision of FRMs will \nenable  banks  to  reach  a  new  market  that  has  previously  been  neglected.  By \nbecoming more familiar with assessing the creditworthiness of this new borrower \nsegment,  it  is  anticipated  that  participating  banks  will  continue  to  service  this \nmarket  after  the  ADB  funds  have  been  exhausted.    In  addition,  it  is  anticipated \nthat  the  successful  penetration  of  this  new  market  segment  will  attract  other \ncommercial  banks  to  this  market.    Second,  while  ADB  is  filling  the  long-term \nfinancing  gap  that  currently  exists,  the  capital  markets,  which  typically  provide \nlonger-term  financing,  are  gradually  maturing  and  will  increasingly  be  able  to \nmeet  the  banks\u2019  needs.    For  instance,  a  few  select  banks  have  been  able  to \nissue  bonds  on  a  5-  and  7-year  basis,  the  latter  of  which  has  been  for \nsubordinated  debt.    ADB\u2019s  cross-currency  swap  for  the  10-year  rupiah  funds \nneeded  for  this  program,  as  well  as  a  possible  local  currency  bond  offering \nissued at a later date, also contributes to the development and deepening of the \nlocal  capital  markets.    Furthermore,  as  noted,  SMF  (the  secondary  mortgage \nfinance company) has been gradually able to extend the terms of its financing to \n5 years. It is anticipated that SMF will be able to provide longer-term, fixed-rate \nfinancing  as  the  market  becomes  more  familiar  with  SMF  and  as  the  capital \nmarkets  itself  deepens.  Finally,  the  ADB  TA  will  provide  long-term  sustainable \nimpact for the participating banks with respect to building more robust mortgage \nlending practices, which is expected to create downward movement in the market \nand help to develop the capital markets.  \n\nAlleviation of housing shortages and improvement of living conditions for \nlow-income  households.  As  noted,  Indonesia  has  an  urgent  need  for  urban \nhousing.    Support  for  the  housing  finance  market  will  help  to  increase  housing \nstock, particularly in urban areas. The current mortgage distribution model, which \nentails bank\u2013developer direct tie-ups for the provision of mortgage loans to home \npurchasers  for  specific  residential  developments,  is  expected  to  stimulate \nconstruction, particularly for more affordable homes. Importantly, the program will \nhelp  to  facilitate  housing  for  low-income  families  and  provide  better  living \nstandards.  Research  indicates  that  when  new  construction  occurs  at  the  higher \nends of the market, there is a series of upgrades and movements of households, \nwhich helps to vacate lower-quality stock for low-income households. Developing \nnations  with  deeper  housing  finance  systems  also  have  a  lower  proportion  of \ntheir  population  living  in  slums  (footnote  17).  Importantly,  the  program  is  also \naligned  with  government  initiatives  to  address  urban  problems  by  creating \nhousing stock and developing the country\u2019s housing finance system.  \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\nAchievement  of  Millennium  Development  Goals.  Housing  can  be  a  critical \nsector  in  achieving  MDGs  because  of  its  multiple  connections  to  other  sectors \nand  industries,  and  its  impact  on  social  welfare.  UN-HABITAT  has  noted  that \n\"since  housing  is  an  important  sector  of  any  national  economy,  it  will  be \nimpossible  to  achieve  these  goals  without  paying  adequate  attention  to  the \nprovision  of  housing  and  related  infrastructure.\u201d  (footnote  32).  All  eight  MDGs, \nincluding the reduction of diseases such as malaria and HIV/AIDS and improved \naccess  to  primary  education,  can  be  met  through  housing  sector  investments. \n(Refer to Appendix 5 for more details.) \n\nGender  promotion.  Three  of  the  MDGs  identified  as  being  achieved  through \nhousing investments are related to improvements in conditions for women, such \nas  improvement  in  maternal  health.  Additionally,  many  women  in  emerging \nmarkets use the home as a base for income-earning activities, such as sewing, \nbaking,  etc.  For  instance,  in  a  survey  conducted  in  Dar  es  Salaam,  Tanzania, \n64%  of  women  households  used  their  residences  as  a  source  of  income \ngeneration (footnote 31). In Indonesia, for every 100 homes built, 21 new home-\nbased  enterprises  (HBEs)  will  develop.33  Indonesia  also  has  a  higher  than \naverage  number  of  workers  per  HBE  at  2.6  workers  per  household.  Thus,  for \nevery 100 homes built, 54.6 HBE jobs are created.  \n\nContribution to gross domestic product growth and job generation for the \npoor.  Investments  in  the  housing  sector  are  catalytic  to  other  sectors  of  the \neconomy  and  can  contribute  from  2%  to  8%  or  more  of  a  country's  GDP.34  In \nIndonesia, Vice President Boediono recently stated that \u201cwe realize that housing \ndevelopment  is  one  important  aspect  for  us  in  tackling  the  poverty  problem, \nmainly  in  urban  areas\u201d  (footnote  20).  The  construction  industry  in  Indonesia \nprovides  a  solid  foundation  for  economic  growth,  directly  supporting  8.98%  of \nGDP in 2009.35 Housing construction, in particular, has strong backward linkages \nto  ancillary  industries,  such  as  cement  suppliers  and  bricklayers,  and  forward \nlinkages to other industries. Based on a model developed by ADB\u2019s Economics \nand Research Department (ERD), a single unit of investment in the construction \nsector in Indonesia can generate an additional 0.52 units of economic activity in \nits backward activities, and catalyze an additional 0.47 units in forward activities. \nFor  the  proposed  ADB  investment  of  $300  million,  about  $150  million  in \neconomic  activities \nto  backward-linking  sectors  would  be  added,  while \napproximately  $140  million  of  activities  would  be  catalyzed  in  forward-linking \nsectors. (Refer to Appendix 6 for more details).  \n\n \nin  housing  also  generate  growth \n\nInvestments \nin \nconstruction,  property  and  real  estate,  and  other  industries.  While  Indonesia \nweathered \nfairly  well,  unemployment  and \nunderemployment  worsened.36    In  Indonesia,  construction  is  a  large  source  of \n\nthrough  employment \n\nfinancial  crisis \n\nthe  global \n\n                                                 \n33 Tipple, G. 2005.

Moreover,  according  to  ERD,  these \nunskilled construction workers have higher incidences of poverty than the rest of \nthe  population,  with  mean  per  capita  household  expenditure  of  just  Rp261,748 \nper  month  (which  indicates  a  poverty  incidence  rate  of  18.3%)  as  compared  to \nthe  national  average  of  Rp353,421  (which  indicates  a  poverty  incidence  rate  of \n16.6%).39  \n \nERD  provided  a  quantitative  model  that  uses  data  from  Indonesia\u2019s  Bureau  of \nStatistics to generate figures related to employment creation from investments in \nvarious  sectors.  The  model  forecasts  that  an  investment  of  $300  million  in \nIndonesia\u2019s  construction  sector  can  generate  approximately  840,000  full-time \njobs across all sectors of the economy, of which 18,000 jobs (900 skilled, 17,100 \nunskilled)  will  be  created  in  the  construction  sector.  Indonesia\u2019s  construction \nsector,  reflective  of  the  overall  economy,  has  a  high  number  (approximately \n166,000)  of  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs),  while  the  share  of \nIndonesia\u2019s  employed  population  working  for  SMEs  is  about  86%.40  Thus,  it  is \nestimated  that  approximately  722,000  jobs  in  the  SME  sector  would  be  created \nby the additional $300 million investment. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nOutputs and Outcome \n\n \n24. \nOutcome.  ADB\u2019s funding will result in an increased level of housing finance availed of \nby  households,  which  will  generate  economic  activity.  Indicators  of  this  include  (i)  wider \ncustomer  segments  and  down  market  penetration,  (ii)  an  increase  in  overall  growth  of \nparticipating  banks\u2019  portfolios,  (iii)  job  creation,  and  (iv)  an  increase  in  the  country\u2019s  economic \nactivity through forward and backward linkages to ancillary industries. \n \n25. \nOutput.    Outputs  include  financial  institutions  having  access  to  long-term  fixed-rate \nfunds for mortgage onlending. Participating banks will increase their mortgage lending activities \nand offer a new type of mortgage product. An important output of this project will be completion \nof the TA by each participating bank and the application of the principles learned. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe ADB Assistance and Transaction Structure \n\n                                                 \n37 Euromonitor International. 2010.

Compared  to  the  International  Labour  Organization\u2019s  statistics  for  Indonesia\u2019s  overall \npopulation of employed workers (99,691,000) in 2007, it can be estimated that approximately 85.7% of Indonesia\u2019s \nemployed population works for a small or medium-sized enterprise. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\n \n\nBased  on  the  current  constraints  in  the  housing  finance  market  and  feedback  from \n\n26. \ncommercial banks, the Housing Finance Program will consist of the following two components: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\nLong-term  fixed-rate  rupiah  loans.  While  a  number  of  issues  need  to  be \naddressed to broaden mortgage lending in Indonesia, one of the most pressing \nissues is the lack of long-term funds, particularly on a fixed-rate basis. Under the \nprogram, ADB will offer $300 million equivalent in rupiah-denominated fixed-rate \nloans  of  up  to  10  years  to  participating  banks  for  the  purpose  of  residential \nmortgage  onlending.  The  Housing  Finance  Program  is  not  a  revolving  facility; \nloans that are extended and repaid or prepaid will not be available for relending. \nparticipating  banks  will  determine  the  interest  rates  that  will  be  offered  to \nmortgage borrowers. \n\nTechnical assistance. The Housing Finance Program will also consist of TA that \nwill be provided to each participating bank. The TA will be provided under the TA \nfor Housing Finance Capacity Development in South and Southeast Asia, which \nwas  approved  by  ADB  in  December  2009.41  Specifically,  the  TA  will  (a)  help \nbanks strengthen their mortgage underwriting, including appraisal and risk-based \npricing  techniques,  and  servicing  practices;  (b)  undertake  more  robust  data \nreporting;  and  (c)  enhance  product  development  skills,  including  for  Islamic-\ncompliant mortgage lending and self-employed borrowers. The TA will also entail \nworking with the participating banks to help them launch the FRM product. \n\nTraining  is  an  important  component  of  the  TA.  By  providing  training  to  the \nparticipating banks, ADB will better ensure that core mortgage lending principles \nare understood and that the mortgage lending manual becomes a real resource \nfor  staff.  The  training  program  envisaged  uses  a  two-pronged  approach:  (a) \nproviding  training  to  senior  management,  and  (b)  providing  training  to  middle \nmanagement and operational staff. ADB will also offer a refresher course after 6 \nmonths  following  the  original  training  program  to  help  reinforce  the  concepts \npreviously learned.  \n \n\nDemand  for  fixed-rate  mortgage  product.  With  respect  to  the  rationale  for  the \n27. \nintroduction  of  the  FRM  product,  it  has  been  noted  that  there  is  a  mismatch  between  the \nproducts  that  are  currently  offered  by  the  banks  and  the  needs  and  preferences  of  average \nconsumers  who  do  not  presently  have  access  to  mortgage  finance.  As  previously  discussed, \nbanks  have  been  increasing  the  fixed-rate  period  on  fixed-rate  ARMs  to  meet  consumer \ndemand;  however,  banks  are  not  able  to  offer  conventional  long-term  FRM  products  due  to  a \nlack of matched funding. There is also demand in the Shariah market for mortgages that would \nbe similar to a fixed-rate product.  \n \n28. \nTarget market. The expected target market for the program will be first time, moderate-\nincome home buyers. Such buyers could include salaried government or municipal workers, or \nself-employed borrowers with steady incomes. Developers have started to construct homes for \nmore  moderate-income  borrowers.  Additionally,  property  prices  have  remained  stable  in \nIndonesia for a number of years. Overall, house prices in Indonesia increased 2.54% over the \n\n                                                 \n41 ADB.  2009.  Technical  Assistance  for  Housing  Finance  Capacity  Development  in  South  and  Southeast  Asia. \nManila. The TA work proposed under the Housing Finance Program is within the scope of the Technical Assistance \nfor Housing Finance Capacity Development in South and Southeast Asia and no additional funds will be needed to \nundertake such activities. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nyear to the end of the first quarter of 2010. However, when adjusted for inflation, house prices \nhad actually declined 1.08% from a year earlier.42  \n \n29. \nTerms  of  ADB  loans  to  participating  banks.  As  noted,  senior  loans  denominated  in \nfixed-rate rupiah will be offered to eligible Indonesian private commercial banks. The loans will \nhave a tenor of up to 10 years and will be extended on a secured or unsecured basis; such a \ndecision will be undertaken on a case-by-case basis. If secured, the form of security is expected \nto  be  over  certain  receivables,  such  as  mortgages.  To  manage  the  growth  of  the  banks\u2019 \nmortgage  portfolios,  it  is  likely  that  the  loans  will  be  disbursed  in  tranches.  However,  this \ndepends on the available sources of local currency at the time that funding is needed.    \n \n30. \nProgram  availability.  ADB  will  approve  participating  banks  under  the  program  for  2 \nyears  from  Board  approval.  TA  and  individual  loan  disbursements  could  occur  after  the \nexpiration of this period. \n \n31. \nQualifying  criteria  for  participating  banks  and  program  parameters.  ADB  will  offer \nthe  program  to  all  of  the  top-tier  private  commercial  banks  in  Indonesia  to  ensure  that  the \nprogram does not create a competitive disadvantage in the mortgage market. Each participating \nbank will undergo standard due diligence and review, and will be presented to ADB\u2019s investment \ncommittee for approval. To maximize the impact and success of the program, ADB proposes to \nsupport participating banks that are already active in mortgage lending and that have a desire to \nexpand  their  customer  base.  Table  1  shows  the  proposed  qualifying  criteria  for  participating \nbanks. \n \n\nTable 1: Qualifying Participating Bank Criteria for the Housing Finance Program \nTechnical Assistance \nMortgage Lending Experience \nEach participating bank will be \nAt least 3 years of mortgage lending \nobligated to participate in the TA \nexperience with a well-performing \nprogram. \nmortgage portfolio with NPLs of less \nthan 3.5% \n\nCredit Standards \nCredit rating of BB or higher for \nsovereign risk local currency long-\nterm issuer default rating (or \nequivalent) from at least one \ninternational credit rating agency  \nPasses standard ADB due diligence \nand investment committee approval \n\nUnderwriting and servicing platforms \nin place. \n\nADB will require commitment of \nparticipating banks\u2019 senior \nmanagement to the TA and will issue \na letter outlining the TA components \nand have each participating bank \ncountersign.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, NPL = nonperforming loan, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n32. \nTo  ensure  that  the  program  encourages  down  market  penetration  on  a  prudent  basis, \nADB  has  established  program  parameters,  as  provided  in  Table  2,  which  will  be  set  forth  in \neach loan agreement. To maintain asset quality while allowing a broader segment of borrowers \nwho  may  not  be  able  to  accumulate  large  down  payments,  banks  will  be  allowed  to  provide \nloans  up  to  80%  of  the  value  of  the  home.  Additionally,  the  debt-to-income  ratio  of  each \nborrower will not be allowed to exceed 35%. Geographic concentrations in the greater Jakarta \narea will not be allowed in excess of 50% of the portfolio funded by ADB. As previously noted, \nbanks have experienced higher levels of NPLs outside of this geographic region. However, it is \nimportant to encourage banks to diversify their portfolios on a prudent basis. \n \n\n                                                 \n42 Global Property Guide,  2010. Indonesia\u2019s Housing Market Remains Weak. http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/ \n\nAsia/Indonesia. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\n \n\nDown  market  penetration  will  be  encouraged  through  portfolio  targets  that  set  an \n33. \naverage  mortgage  loan  size  for  the  portfolio  funded  by  ADB.  In  discussions  with  potential \nparticipating  banks,  it  was  noted  that  a  number  of  them  operate  in  different  market  segments \ndue to risk appetite, geographic considerations, and developer relationships. The target portfolio \ncomposition will be determined during due diligence and will be based upon each participating \nbank\u2019s  current  average  mortgage  loan  size.  At  a  minimum,  ADB  would  require  the  banks  to \ndecrease  their  average  mortgage  loan  size  by  approximately  15%  for  those  mortgage  loans \nfunded by ADB. This will ensure that banks move down market, and that home borrowers can \npurchase homes in a price range that is currently offered on the market.   \n \n\nTable 2: Housing Finance Program Parameters \n\nRequirement \n\nResidential mortgage loans \nTo be determined based upon the current average size of mortgage loan of \neach participating bank, which would be set at a minimum of about 15% lower \nNot to exceed 80% of the value of the home \nBorrowers household debt\u2013income ratio cannot exceed 35% \nLoans will have a minimum fixed-rate term of 10 years \nNo more than 50% of the loan portfolio can be in the greater Jakarta area \nNot permitted \nNot permitted \nNot permitted \n\nItem \nUsage \nPortfolio target \n\nLoan\u2013value ratio \nDebt\u2013income ratio \nFixed-rate component \nGeographic concentration \nSecond liens \nSecond homes  \nInvestor-owned properties \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n34. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \nJustification for the proposed ADB loan is based on the following considerations: \n\nLack of access to long-term funds. The program will provide systemic support \nto the Indonesian financial sector at a critical point in its development. Access to \nformal  banking  services  has  been  restricted.  Moreover,  the  availability  of  long-\nterm  local  currency  funds,  particularly  at  fixed  rates,  is  constrained.  Such \nabsence results in banks having maturity mismatch risk and a limited number of \nlonger-term mortgage products. ADB will thus be providing critically needed long-\nterm funding for the growth of this market. \n \nInnovative intervention to develop the housing finance market. The Housing \nFinance  Program  will  play  a  pioneering  role  in  encouraging  the  provision  of \nmortgage loans to lower-income consumers in the Indonesian market through the \nintroduction of long-term FRMs. To date, no such intervention has been designed \nfor  this  market,  and  local  banks  have  only  been  able  to  offer  shorter-term  fixed \nrate components.  \n\nCapacity  building  technical  assistance.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition  in  terms  of  TA \nfor  mortgage  lending  capacity  building  is  strong.  As  noted,  given  the  relative \nunderdevelopment  of  the  housing market,  mortgage  lending  skills  and servicing \npractices  could  be  strengthened.  Tailored  TA  for  each  participating  bank,  as  is \ncontemplated,  is  important  for  the  prudent  growth  of  the  mortgage  market  in \nIndonesia.  \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\n \nB. \n \nADB has conducted a comprehensive due diligence review to determine the viability of \n35. \nthe  proposed  financial  assistance.  The  main  risks  and  mitigation  measures  identified  are  the \nfollowing:  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n \n \n\nProduct  uptake.  The  success  of  the  program  is  dependent  upon  each \nparticipating bank\u2019s ability to launch the fixed-rate product and consumer interest. \nAs noted, banks have been offering fixed-rate ARM products with initial fixed-rate \nperiods; however, these have usually been shorter in term. It will be important for \nthe  banks  to  educate  potential  consumers  about  the  benefits  of  a  longer-term \nfixed-rate product and to strongly market it. Part of ADB\u2019s TA will help the banks \nbetter develop and market such new products. \n \nMortgage  lending  practices.  Mortgage  lending  practices  have  been  generally \nconservative in Indonesia. As the banks expand into broader customer segments \nwith new products, it is important that they do so prudently. ADB will examine the \ncurrent  mortgage  practices  and  target  markets  of  possible  participating  banks. \nProgram  parameters  based  upon  a  balance  between  down  market  penetration \nand maintenance of portfolio quality have been established.  \n \nLocal currency funding. ADB currently has the option of sourcing local currency \nfunding through the cross-currency swap market and may at a later date issue a \nlocal currency bond. ADB will pursue the most cost-effective financing available \nat the time that funds are to be disbursed. Interest in the program is dependent to \na large extent on the all-in pricing that ADB can offer to the participating banks. \n\nCredit  risk  of  participating  banks  and  mortgage  borrowers.    ADB  will  be \nexposed  to  the  credit  risk  of  participating  banks  and  their  ability  to  generate \nresidential mortgage loans in a prudent manner. There is a risk that asset quality \nmay deteriorate as banks expand into broader customer segments.  Deterioration \nin  the  debt  servicing  ability  of  end-mortgage  borrowers  could  negatively  impact \nparticipating banks\u2019 financial performance and repayment to ADB.  It is important \nto note, however, that repayment of ADB\u2019s loans will be from each participating \nbank\u2019s general operations, not exclusively from their mortgage operations.  The \nbanking  sector,  and  particularly  mortgage  loans,  has  performed  well  even \nthrough this latest financial crisis.  ADB\u2019s participating bank and program criteria, \nwhich  strike  a  balance  between  down  market  penetration  and  maintenance  of \nportfolio  quality,  will  also  help  to  mitigate  this  risk.    ADB  will  examine  portfolio \nmonitoring  measures  at  each  participating  bank.  Additionally,  the  ADB  TA  will \nhelp  the  banks  strengthen  their  loan  origination  and  monitoring  standards,  thus \nreducing the risk of asset quality deterioration. \n \nCompetition  with  state-owned  bank.  A  lesser  risk  that  has  been  identified  is \npossible competition with the state-owned commercial housing bank, BTN, which \nprovides  loans  largely  on  subsidized  basis,  which  would  be  detrimental  to \nparticipating  banks\u2019  long-run  profitability  and  capitalization  should  they  seek  to \ncompete  in  this  low-income  market.  However,  this  risk  is  perceived  to  be  low.  \nBTN  targets  lower  income  borrowers  and  the  average  mortgage  loan  size  is \nabout Rp50 million.  Moreover, given that the mortgage debt-to-GDP ratio in the \ncountry is at approximately 2%, there is ample space for banks offering mortgage \nloans to a wide variety of customer segments.    \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n \nEnvironmental and Social Safeguards \n\nA. \n \nUnder ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program will be categorized as FI, \n36. \ntreated  as  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  It  is \nexpected  that  the  loans  under  the  program  will  have  minimal  or  no  adverse  environmental \nimpact.  Participating  banks  will  not  finance  real  estate  development  or  mass  housing \nconstruction.  Banks  will  only  onlend  in  the  form  of  mortgage  loans  to  individuals,  primarily  in \nurban  areas.  Although  environmental  and  social  management  systems  are  not  required  for  FI \nprojects that are treated as category C, the prohibited investment activities list in Appendix 5 of \nthe  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  is  applied  to  all  FI  projects.  Indigenous  peoples  will  not  be \nimpacted by this program and no involuntary resettlement issues are foreseen. \n \nB. \n \n37.  Monitoring. The proposed terms of the loan agreements will require participating banks \nto  provide  the  following  information:  (i)  unaudited  quarterly  financial  statements;  (ii)  audited \nannual  financial  statements;  (iii)  quarterly  compliance  certificates  for  agreed-upon  financial \ncovenants; and (iv) reporting on mortgage portfolios on a semiannual basis, which will include \nloan-to-value, loan size, borrower income, and geographic location. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n38. \nEvaluation.  Monitoring  reports  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB\u2019s  Office  of  Risk \nManagement  on  a  regular  basis,  but  at  least  annually.  The  first  monitoring  report  will  be \nsubmitted no later than 12 months after legal documentation has been signed. \n \nC. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n39. \nThe  target  participating  banks  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date)  and  Policy  on  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism  (2003).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB will require participating banks to institute, maintain, and comply with internal \nprocedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of \npreventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism, and covenant \nwith  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The  investment  documentation  between \nADB and the participating banks will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential \nviolation of these undertakings.  \n \nD. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\n40. \nThe transaction, once approved and signed, will increase ADB's projected nonsovereign \nexposure  by  June  2011 to  $5.9  billion.  Additionally,  the  proposed  transaction  will  increase  the \nnonsovereign  exposure  to  Indonesia  to  $520.8  million,  or  8.8%  of  the  total  nonsovereign \nexposure;  increase  nonsovereign  exposure  in  the  domestic  commercial  bank  subsector  to \n$426.0  million,  or  7.2%  of  the  total  nonsovereign  exposure;  and  increase  nonsovereign \nexposure  to  Indonesia's  finance  sector  to  $461.1  million,  or  20.4%  of  the  total  nonsovereign \nexposure  in  the  finance  industry.  The  proposed  financing  is  within  ADB's  approved  medium-\nterm, country, and industry limits. ADB will assess and ensure compliance with group and single \nobligor limits once the participating banks avail themselves of the program. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nE. \n\nAssurances \n\nNo-objection \n\nletter.  Consistent  with \n\nthe  Agreement  Establishing \n\n41. \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank,  the  government  will  be  asked  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the \nproposed program. ADB will not make a loan disbursement under the program until it receives \nsuch confirmation \n \n42. \nDocumentation. ADB will enter into suitable loan agreements and other required legal \ndocuments with participating banks once the individual loan terms (including tenor, pricing, and \nfees)  are  approved  by  ADB\u2019s  investment  committee.  These  agreements  will  be  on  terms  and \nconditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n43. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  Housing  Finance  Program  would  comply  with  the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the \nPresident,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I \nrecommend that the Board approve the proposed program in an amount of up to $300,000,000 \nequivalent in Indonesian rupiah from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, to be offered to certain \neligible private commercial banks in the form of fixed-rate rupiah-denominated senior loans, with \ninterest  to  be  determined  based  on  the  procedures  applicable  to  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign \noperations  and  on  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with \nthose set forth in this report and as may be reported to the Board.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nC.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe program is expected to contribute to the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) core mission of reducing poverty in Asia. It is \naligned  with Strategy 2020,a consistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy program for Indonesia,b and supports the government\u2019s \nobjectives  of  (i)  addressing  urban  housing  problems,  (ii)  reducing  slum  proliferation,  and  (iii)  creating  sustainable  urban \nenvironments that continue to generate economic growth.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nKey issues. Indonesia has a need for over 8 million homes now, and approximately 800,000 additional homes are needed \nannually  for  the  next  20  years.  The  program  is  aligned  with  government  initiatives  to  address  urban  problems  by  creating \nhousing  stock  and  developing  the  country\u2019s  housing  finance  system.  The  program  will  help  improve  access  to  housing \nthrough  affordable  rates  and  provide  better  living  standards.  It  also  has  the  potential  to  create  a  housing  stock  for  lower-\nincome households. Investments in housing generate growth through employment in  construction, property  and real estate, \nand  other  industries.  Construction  business  typically  offers  employment  opportunities  for  unskilled  and  semi-skilled  workers \nwho  have  higher  incidences  of  poverty  than  the  rest  of  the  population.  The  program  is  also  expected  to  help  the  country \nachieve its Millennium Development Goals more quickly (Appendix 5). \n \n Design features. Under the program, ADB will offer $300 million equivalent in rupiah for fixed-rate loans of up to 10 years, \nwhich  will  be  used  by  participating  banks  for  mortgage  onlending.  Provision  of  long-term  fixed-rate  funds  will  enable \nparticipating banks to move down market and broaden mortgage lending to a wider customer segment because credit risk will \nbe  reduced,  in  some  instances,  as  customers  will  have  surety  of  monthly  interest  payments  and  lower  monthly  payments \noverall. The program also includes technical assistance, which will help participating banks to move down market. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey  issues.  This  program  is  classified  as  category  FI  (treated  as  C)  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009). \nParticipating  banks  will  only  onlend  to  individual  households  in  urban  areas  who  are  interested  and  qualified  to  avail \nthemselves  of  a  residential  mortgage  loan.  It  will  not  finance  any  large-scale  real  estate  properties  (subdivisions)  that  may \naffect indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities as a community. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. Consultations were held \nwith various Indonesian banks, the Ministry of Finance, and Bank Indonesia.   \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n\n Yes    \n\n No If a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to \n\n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nimplement the plan (including budget, consultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nThe  program  consists  of  senior  loans  and  technical  assistance  which  will  be  offered  to  a  number  of  participating  banks  in \nIndonesia. During due diligence, consultation meetings were held with various Indonesian banks, the Ministry of Finance, and \nBank Indonesia. During implementation, participating banks will design and implement appropriate information dissemination \nactivities in the local language as part of their marketing strategy for their mortgage lending services.   \n \n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\nKey  issues.  Three  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  identified  as  being  achieved  through  housing  investments  are \nrelated to improvements in conditions for women. First, housing promotes gender equality and can empower women through \n(i) secure tenure, which contributes to household stability and provides women with a good atmosphere to engage in income-\ngenerating  activities;  and  (ii)  the  reduction  of  stress  and  contribution  to  women\u2019s  productivity.  Many  women  in  emerging \nmarkets use the home as a base for income-earning activities, such as sewing, baking, etc. In Indonesia, for every 100 homes \nbuilt, 21 new home-based enterprises (HBEs) will develop. Indonesia also has a higher than average number of workers per \nHBE,  at  2.6  workers  per  household.  Thus,  for  every  100  homes  built,  54.6  HBE  jobs  are  created.  Second,  access  to  good \nhousing and related services reduces the risk of disease among children and overall child mortality rates. Finally, investments \nin adequate housing can lower the need for health services for women, thereby improving maternal health. \n \nKey actions.

Despite  the  number  of  commercial  banks \noperating in this sector, 10 banks currently control over 64% of total assets in the system.4 As \ncan  be  seen  by  the  information  provided  in  Figure  A3.1,  no  one  bank  has  a  market  share  of \ngreater than 15%. PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk, the large state-owned commercial bank, is \nthe market leader with a market share of over 14%. \n\nFigure A3.1: Top 10 Commercial Banks' Market Share in Terms of Banking \nAssets\n\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\nB T N\n\nBII\n\nB ank P erm ata\n\nB ank D an a m on \nP anin B ank\n\nCIM B Niaga\n\nB NI\n\nB C A\n\nCommercial Banks\n\nB RI\n\nB ank M andiri\n\nBTN= PT Bank Tabungan Negara (Persero) Tbk; BII=PT Bank International Indonesia Tbk; CIMB Niaga = PT \nBank  CIMB  Niaga  Tbk;  BNI=  PT  Bank  Negara  Indonesia  (Persero)  Tbk;  BCA=PT  Bank  Central  Asia  Tbk; \nBRI=PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. \nSource: PT Bank CIMB Niaga Tbk. 2010. 1H 2010 Results (Audited).

The  direct  impact  on  the  Indonesian  banking  industry  from  the \nglobal financial crisis was minimized due to limited exposure to global financial assets, stricter \nlending  rules  imposed  by  Bank  Indonesia  (the  central  bank  and  regulator),  and  efforts  by  the \nbanks  to  bolster  their  respective  capital  positions.  Capital  adequacy  ratios  were  on  average \n16.8% in 2008 and 17.4% in 2009. Key performance indicators in the Indonesian banking sector \n(Table  A3.1)  illustrate  positive  levels  of  growth,  albeit  at  slower  rates,  in  aggregate  loans  and \ndeposits. Deposits grew by over 16.0% in 2008 from the previous year, and by 12.5% in 2009. \nLoan  growth  averaged  about  30%  from  2007  to  2008,  and  then  contracted  to  approximately \n10% in 2009. Reflecting the overall economic trends, rupiah-denominated loan growth in 2009 \nwas  mainly  supported  by  consumer  loan  originations,  which  expanded  by  19%.5  This  was \nfollowed by investment credit at 16%, while working capital loans grew by only 2%.  \n \n\nTable A3. 1: Indonesia Commercial Banking Sector Aggregate Figures \n(Rp trillion) \n\nItem \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\nTotal assets \nTotal loans \nDeposits \nLoan growth (% yoy) \n\nDeposit growth (% yoy) \nLDR (%) \nRatios: \n\nCapital adequacy ratio (%) \n\nReturn on assets (%) \n\nReturn of equity (%) \n\n1,469.80 \n695.65 \n1,127.94 \n16.90 \n\n1,693.50 \n792.30 \n1,287.10 \n13.89 \n\n1,986.50 \n1,002.01 \n1,510.83 \n26.47 \n\n2,310.56 \n1,307.69 \n1,753.29 \n30.51 \n\n2,534.11 \n1,437.93 \n1,973.04 \n9.96 \n\n17.12 \n61.70 \n \n\n19.30 \n\n2.55 \n\n15.70 \n\n14.11 \n61.60 \n \n\n21.27 \n\n2.64 \n\n16.80 \n\n17.38 \n66.30 \n \n\n19.30 \n\n2.78 \n\n16.80 \n\n16.05 \n74.60 \n \n\n16.76 \n\n2.33 \n\n17.10 \n\n12.53 \n72.90 \n \n\n17.42 \n\n2.60 \n\n19.30 \n\nGross NPLs(%) \n\n3.31   \n(\u2026) = data not available, LDR = loan-to-deposit ratio, NPL = nonperforming loans, yoy = year-on-year.  \nSource:  Fitch Ratings and Bank Indonesia. \n\n6.07 \n\n7.56 \n\n3.20 \n\n4.07 \n\n2010 \n(July) \n\n2,683.46 \n1,597.98 \n2,082.60 \n11.13 \n\n5.55 \n76.70 \n \n\n18.29 \n\n2.97 \n\n(\u2026) \n\n3.02 \n\nProfitability  has  been  sound.

The  10  Indonesian  banks \nrated  by  Fitch  posted  higher  pre-provision  operating  profits  at  4.1%  of  average  assets  in  the \nthird quarter of 2009, as compared with 3.5% for end 2008, having benefited from superior net \ninterest  margins  as  high  lending  yields  were  maintained  and  deposit  rates  (with  shorter \nmaturities)  were  re-priced  more  quickly  in  a  declining  domestic  interest  rate  environment.6 \nAverage credit costs for the 10 rated Indonesian banks were below 3% of average gross loans \nfor the third quarter of 2009, which was absorbed by the banks\u2019 earnings. In aggregate, return \non equity for the banking sector was strong at 17.1% for 2008 and 19.3% for 2009.

However,  by  the  end  of  2009  the  gross  NPL  ratio  for  loans  to  the \nmanufacturing sector declined to about 5.0% (from 7.4% at the end of June 2009) as operating \nconditions  gradually  improved.  Overall,  Fitch  expects  the  financial  performance  of  Indonesian \nbanks  to  improve  further  throughout  2010  due  to  the  more  favorable  macroeconomic  outlook \nand lower credit costs as loan quality continues to improve.   \n\n \n\n\f \n26 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nECONOMIC OVERVIEW \n\n \n1. \nThe  Indonesian  economy  was  resilient  throughout  the  global  financial  crisis  in  2008\u2013\n2009. The country's economy grew 4.5% in 2009, in sharp contrast to the 2.8% contraction in \nworld gross domestic product (GDP). In 2010, GDP growth accelerated to 5.9% in the first half \nof the year, supported mostly by private consumption, which contributed to nearly half the total \nGDP  growth.  Fixed  capital  investment,  contributing  to  1.8%  of  GDP  growth  in  the  period,  was \nsupported  by  the  appreciation  of  the  rupiah  against  the  dollar,  which  lowered  the  cost  of \nimported capital equipment and provided a lift in credit to the private sector. On the supply side, \nservices contributed more than half (3.7%) of the total GDP growth in the first 6 months of the \nyear. Industry expanded by 4.4%, with a moderate recovery in manufacturing. Other economic \nindicators  have  also  been  positive.  After  remaining  below  4%  for  about  a  year,  inflation \naccelerated to slightly over 6% in July and August 2010 due to temporary pressure from volatile \nfood prices. The Jakarta Stock Exchange composite index of share prices climbed by 21.6% in \nthe first 8 months of 2010, supported by solid economic performance, an appreciating exchange \nrate, and increased purchases from foreign investors. Indonesia\u2019s economic outlook is expected \nto improve further and economic growth for 2010 is forecasted at 6%. \n \n2. \nThe country\u2019s fiscal performance in 2009 was also better than expected, with the budget \ndeficit  recorded  at  1.6%  of  GDP.  The  year-end  tax  revenue  was  on  target,  while  on  the \nexpenditure  side,  the  government  maintained  spending  within  budget.  The  2010  budget  was \nrevised in May 2010, which widened the budget deficit target from 1.6% of GDP to 2.1% of GDP \ndue  to  higher  international  oil  prices  than  originally  expected  and  additional  spending  for \nphysical  infrastructure,  poverty  reduction,  education,  and  for  reconstruction  of  earthquake-\ndamaged infrastructure. However, only about 35% of the 2010 budget spending was disbursed \nin  the  first  half  of  2010.  Revenue,  on  the  other  hand,  was  supported  from  the  economic \nrecovery,  higher  oil  prices  and  production,  and  policies  to  improve  the  performance  of  state-\nowned enterprises. Therefore, the budget deficit for the year is expected to be lower, at 1.5% of \nGDP. On the financing side, between January and the end of August 2010 about 78.4% of the \ngovernment\u2019s  total  market  financing  target  for  2010  had  been  met  through  issuance  of  debt \nsecurities.  The  yields  for  both  dollar  and  rupiah  bonds  have  declined  across  all  tenors.  The \ndebt-to-GDP  ratio  of  the  national  government  declined  to  26%  in  August  2010,  based  on \npreliminary data, maintaining a decline that has seen the ratio fall by more than half in 6 years.  \n \n\n3. \nIndonesia's balance of payments recorded a surplus of $12.5 billion in 2009, compared \nwith a deficit of about $2.0 billion in 2008. The rebound was broad-based and supported by an \nimprovement  in  both  current  and  capital  accounts.  In  the  first  half  of  2010,  the  surplus  in  the \noverall balance of payments more than doubled from a year earlier to $12 billion, largely as a \nresult  of  increasing  foreign  investment  in  Indonesian  bonds  and  short-term  debt  securities, \ncoupled with a boost in foreign direct investment. International reserves in the first 8 months of \n2010  increased  to  $81.3  billion,  equivalent  to  6.1  months  of  imports  and  government  foreign \ndebt payments. The strong external position contributed to the appreciation of the rupiah. \n\n4. \nIndonesia's sovereign ratings were upgraded by all three major credit rating agencies in \n2010. The ratings upgrades reflect the country\u2019s relative resilience during the financial crisis due \nprimarily  to  its  exchange  rate  flexibility,  improvement  in  external  finances  due  to  foreign \nreserves  accumulation, \nfinancing  requirements,  and  a  stronger \ninternational liquidity position. Fitch Ratings rates Indonesia as a BB+ (stable), while Standard & \nPoor\u2019s have given Indonesia a rating of BB and Moody\u2019s Investors Services have given it Ba2 \n(positive).1   \n\nlower  gross  external \n\n                                                 \n1  Fitch in January 2010, Standard & Poor's in March 2010, and Moody's in June 2010.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n27\n\n \n \n\n \n  \n\n \nTHE IMPORTANCE OF HOUSING FOR ACHIEVING MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT \nGOALS  \n\nMillennium \nDevelopment Goal  \nGoal 1: Eradicate \nextreme poverty and \nhunger \n\nGoal 2: Achieve \nuniversal primary \neducation \n \nGoal 3: Promote gender \nequality and empower \nwomen \n\nGoal 4: Reduce child \nmortality rate \nGoal 5: Improve \nmaternal health \n\nGoal 6: Combat \nHIV/AIDS, malaria, and \nother diseases \n\nGoal 7: Ensure \nenvironmental \nsustainability \n \n\n \n\nGoal 8: Develop a \nglobal partnership for \ndevelopment \n \n\nRole of Housing in Achieving Millennium Development Goals \n\nResidential  activities  can  provide  job  opportunities  and  income  and  thereby \nallow urban poor to invest in food and other basic needs. \n \nImproved housing conditions raise worker productivity. \n \nResidential  activities  improve  a  nation's  wealth  (e.g.,  taxes  and  savings)  and \nallow  governments  and  agencies  to  invest  in  social-oriented  programs  to \nreduce poverty. \nImproved, and access to, housing in appropriate locations lowers absenteeism \nfrom school and increases educational productivity. \nSecure  tenure  allows  parents  to  engage  in  income-generation  activities \nallowing them to cater for educational expenses. \nSecure  tenure  contributes  to  household  stability  and  provides  women  with  a \npeaceful atmosphere to engage in income-generating activities.  \n \nGood housing reduces stress and contributes to women's productivity. \nGood  housing  and  related  services  (e.g.,  water,  electricity,  and  sanitation) \nreduce the risk of diseases among children. \nImproved housing lowers the need for health services for women. \n \nSecure tenure reduces stress among slum dwellers, especially women. \n \nSafeguards procreation and nurturing of the young. \nAccess to housing reduces homelessness and risks of social vices associated \nwith street people. \n \nthe \nGood  housing  brings  comfort, \ntransmission  of  communicable  diseases  (e.g.,  tuberculosis);  it  facilitates  and \nenhances caregiving. \n \nHealth conditions depend largely on a good living environment. \nGood  housing  conditions  and  related  services  contribute \nenvironment. \n \nUse  of  environmentally  friendly  building  materials,  including  energy  efficient \nmaterials, contributes to environmental protection. \n \nGood  housing  and  urban  design  are  cornerstones  of  mitigating  ecological \nfootprints of settlements and reducing vulnerability to climate change. \nPartnership  between  national  government  and  international  development \nagencies creates synergy and reduces duplication of programs. \n \nPartnership  between  national  government  and  international  development \nagencies  for  housing  ensures  realistic  policies  and  programs  and  sharing  of \nbest practices. \n \nPrograms that involve partnerships among national governments, international \ndevelopment  agencies,  local  communities,  and  slum  dwellers  have  a  better \nchance of long-term sustenance. \n\nreduces  overcrowding,  and \n\nto  a  good \n\nlimits \n\nSource: Tibaijuka, A.

Therefore, \namong other things, an investment of $100 increases the manufacturing sector by $27.10 and \nstimulates the finance sector by $4.58.  \n\n \nTable A6.1: Input-Output Multipliers for Indonesia\u2019s Construction Industry  \n(%) \n\nBackward Linkages\n\nForward Linkages\n\nSector \nAgriculture and fisheries \nConstruction \nFinance \nManufacturing \nMining and quarrying \nRestaurant and hotels \nServices \nTrade \nTransport and communication \nUtilities \nOthers \nTotal \n\n \n\nItem \n\nHouseholds with HBE (%) \nMean (PPP, $) \nNon-HBE households \nMean (PPP, $) \n% Improvement with HBE \nAverage jobs supported \n\nSource: Economics and Research Department, Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n2. \nTable  A6.2  indicates  the  average  increase  in  household  monthly  income  from  the \npresence  of  home-based  enterprise  (HBE)  activity,  as  well  as  the  number  of  jobs  supported \nthrough  HBEs.  In  Indonesia,  21%  of  households  support  HBE  activity,  which  increases \nhousehold monthly income by an average of 36%, or $175. For every 100 homes built, 21 new \nHBEs  will  be  created,  resulting  in  a  total  of  $3,675  in  newly  created  disposable  income.  Of \ncountries studied, Indonesia also has the highest average number of workers per HBE, at 2.6 \nper  household.  Thus,  for  every  100  homes  built,  it  can  be  estimated  that  54.6  jobs  will  be \ncreated in this sector alone. \n\nTable A6.2: Home-Based Enterprise Monthly Income \nIndia \n\nIndonesia \n\nSouth Africa \n\n21.1 \n663 \n\n488 \n36 \n2.6 \n\n39.5 \n738 \n\n548 \n35 \n1.6 \n\nHBE=home-based enterprise, PPP=purchasing power parity. \nSource:  Tipple,  G.  2005.

The  conclusion  is  that  one  unit  of  investment  in  the  construction \nsector will create 0.113 units of employment salary in the agriculture and fisheries sector. Using \nan  average  annual  salary  of  Rp2,850,000,  the  model  forecasts  that  an  investment  of  $300 \nmillion  in  Indonesia\u2019s  construction  sector  is  estimated  to  generate  approximately  840,000  full-\ntime  jobs  across  all  sectors  of  the  economy,  of  which  18,000  jobs  will  be  created  in  the \nconstruction industry. Providing further insight into the type of workers that can be employed in \nthe  construction  industry,  research  from  the  University  of  Andalas  in  West  Sumatra  estimates \nthat 96% of Indonesia\u2019s workforce is comprised of unskilled workers.1 Applying this ratio to the \nemployment forecast for jobs created above using ERD\u2019s model, it can be estimated that, of the \n18,000 jobs created in the construction sector, 900 are for skilled workers while 17,100 are for \nunskilled workers. \n\n \nTable A6.3: Employment Generation Based on Input-Output Values \n\nSector \nAgriculture and fisheries \nConstruction \nFinance \nGovernment and security \nManufacturing \nMining and quarrying \nRestaurant and hotels \nServices \nTrade \nTransport and communication \nUtilities \nOthers \nSource: Economics and Research Department of the Asian  \nDevelopment Bank and the Bureau of Statistics, Indonesia. \n\nEmployment \nCoefficient \n0.113 \n0.019 \n0.010 \n0.139 \n0.018 \n0.005 \n0.035 \n0.095 \n0.097 \n0.049 \n0.009 \n0.301 \n\n                                                 \n1  Suraji, Dr. Ir.
