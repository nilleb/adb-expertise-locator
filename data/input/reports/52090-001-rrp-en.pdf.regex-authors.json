THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $200,000,000 equivalent in yuan to Shenzhen Water (Group) Co., Ltd. (SZWG) and \nShenzhen  Water  and Environment  Investment  Group  Co.,  Ltd.  (SZWEIC)  for the  Climate-\nResilient and Smart Urban Water Infrastructure Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n \n2.  The proposed project will support SZWG\u2019s investment in multiple water supply and \nwastewater treatment facilities with smart water technologies and climate- and disaster-resilient \nurban water infrastructure in Shenzhen and third- and fourth-tier cities in the PRC.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. The PRC is one of the world\u2019s most water-stressed countries. Per \ncapita water resources are about one-quarter of the global average,2 and 25% of its water bodies \ndo not meet minimum drinking water quality standards.3 By 2030, the country will need up to 20% \nmore in total water supply than it did in 2014, with a rapid increase in urban water demand.4 Water \nscarcity is exacerbated by climate change and surface water and groundwater pollution. Climatic \nchanges can alter the seasonality of rainfall and intensify extreme precipitation events, straining \ndrainage and sewerage infrastructure and heightening the risks of urban flooding.5 Enhancing \nresilience to extreme weather events associated with climate change is an emerging priority for \ncities in the PRC. \n \n4.  In response, the Government of the PRC launched a national \u201csponge city\u201d program in \n2015. The country\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016\u20132020) for the Development of Strategic \nEmerging Industries emphasized greater use of smart water systems.6 A \u201csponge city\u201d is a city \nwith a water infrastructure system that is capable of absorbing, harvesting, storing, filtering, \npurifying, and slowly releasing or reusing urban runoff\u2014in effect, acting like a sponge. A sponge \ncity is designed to soak up heavy rainfall and flooding and, when needed, release stored water to \nmake it available for beneficial use. In these ways, a sponge city helps to ensure safe urban \ndrainage, avoid flooding, reuse rainwater, and protect the environment. Smart water solutions \nutilize technological innovation to improve water quality and supply, reduce leakages, enhance \nwastewater treatment and reuse, support monitoring and evaluation, improve customer services, \nand reduce energy consumption. \n \n5.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has long supported capacity development in areas \nof water supply, wastewater management, integrated water resource management, flood risk \nmanagement, and enabling the environment for private sector participation. Recent examples \ninclude ADB assistance for preparing (i) an outline strategy to promote smart water approaches \nin a comprehensive integrated urban water system for Tianjin Municipality, (ii) a nationwide long-\n \n1  Third- and fourth-tier cities are generally cities smaller than and ranked below provincial capital cities. \n2  National Bureau of Statistics of China.

In 2018, SZWG participated in an ADB sponge city dissemination \nworkshop and requested ADB assistance to partially fund its 2020\u20132023 investment plan. SZWG \nis committed to making its investments more resilient to climate change and sharing knowledge \nit has gained in Shenzhen with third- and fourth-tier cities in the PRC. \n \n6.  Project design. The loan will finance multiple urban water subprojects that support \nsponge city development to enhance climate resilience, or apply smart water technology to \nimprove efficiency in the water value chain from the supply end to wastewater treatment. The \nproject is designed to be cost-effective in financing multiple subprojects. Subprojects will be \nidentified during the project implementation period between 2020 and 2023. ADB will extend \nfinancing on a subproject-by-subproject basis. \n \n7.  Eligibility criteria. The majority (60%) of the loan proceeds will be used in third- and \nfourth-tier cities, while the rest will be used in Shenzhen. All subprojects should meet climate-\nresilient  and  smart  water  technique  and  technology  requirements  and  pre-agreed  eligibility \ncriteria. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n8.  The sponsor and borrowers. SZWG is the project\u2019s sponsor and guarantor, and SZWG \nand SZWEIC are the co-borrowers. Established in 2001, SZWG is a water utility that provides \ncomprehensive water solutions and services that include urban water system management and \nwastewater treatment and network maintenance. The Shenzhen Municipal Government is the \nmajority  owner  of  SZWG  (55%),  with  the  remaining  shares  held  indirectly  by  Veolia \nEnvironnement S.A. (25%)7 and Beijing Capital Co., Ltd. (20%).8 SZWEIC is a SZWG investment \nplatform established in 2005 to develop, invest, and implement subprojects outside of Shenzhen. \nSZWEIC is owned by SZWG (70%) and the Shenzhen Municipal Government\u2019s investment arm, \nShenzhen Capital Co., Ltd. (30%). \n \n9.  SZWG plans to upgrade the technologies of water supply and wastewater treatment \nfacilities to reduce nonrevenue water, optimize energy efficiency, and enhance service quality. It \nwill also strengthen long-term monitoring and evaluation of urban water systems. The resulting \nimproved operational efficiency and reduced water losses will lower energy consumption and \ncarbon emissions. \n \n10.  SZWG\u2019s sponge city development will be guided by modeling of surface water, weather \npatterns, drainage systems, and groundwater. It will involve low-impact development techniques \nsuch as the use of wetlands, permeable pavements, rainwater gardens, green roofs, storage \nfacilities, wastewater reuse, and managed aquifer recharge. Sponge city development can also \nincorporate advanced early warning systems for floods, weather events, and pollution. The \nsponge city is expected to contribute to climate and disaster resilience, mainly by reducing the \nseverity of the urban flooding caused by excessive rainfall and droughts through storing and \nreleasing runoff in a more ecologically functional way. \n \n7  Veolia Environnement S.A. has been the sponsor in previous ADB-funded projects.

Manila (Loan 7455/3304-PRC). \n ", "3 \n \n \n11.  SZWG aims to disseminate and bring its operational know-how from Shenzhen to smaller \ncities in the country. As of 2019, SZWG was managing 88 water supply plants with an aggregate \ndaily design capacity of 9.8 million cubic meters and 41 wastewater treatment plants with total \ncapacity of 4.0 million cubic meters. These plants served more than 30 million people across 22 \ncities in seven provinces. SZWG is the first PRC water company to produce and distribute high-\nquality potable water to households using a water safety plan for streamlined water quality \nmanagement through automation. In addition, SZWG has invested in research and development \nin collaboration with PRC universities and owned 52 patents and 62 utility models as of 2019.  \n \n12.  SZWG has completed two sponge city projects and is keen to learn from industry best \npractices. Although SZWG has made significant progress on smart water solutions, most of them \nhave focused on e-payment and digitalized monitoring. SZWG has taken initial steps to apply \nsmart water technology for climate change mitigation to reduce energy consumption. SZWG is \nalso committed to improving its approaches to social and environmental management and gender \ninclusiveness, and has participated in knowledge-sharing events organized by ADB. \n \n13.  ADB conducted integrity due diligence.9 SZWG and SZWEIC and their shareholders, \nboards  of  directors,  and  managers  do  not  appear  to  constitute  a  significant  or  potentially \nsignificant integrity risk, since no significant unresolved or substantiated adverse media or other \nrelevant information is related to them. Tax integrity due diligence was not required. \n \n14.  Pandemic  impacts.  The  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  highlights  the \nimportance and preventive power of water, sanitation, and hygiene in sustaining human health \nand well-being. The pandemic has not had a material impact on SZWG\u2019s project costs or capacity. \nUsing digital solutions such as automation and remote monitoring, SZWG provided water supply \nand wastewater treatment services during the first quarter of 2020 without interruption. The \npandemic\u2019s potential impact on municipal governments involved was not fully assessed during \nproject processing. However, ADB\u2019s support for crucial infrastructure through a nonsovereign loan \nis expected to help local governments ensure climate consciousness in economic recovery \nefforts, and the subprojects will provide local jobs. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n15.  Impact.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  urban  environment  and \necosystems improved, and climate resilience enhanced in the PRC.10 \n \n16.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: climate-resilient and smart urban \nwater management in the PRC expanded. \n \n17.  Outputs. The project will have three outputs: (i) climate-resilient and smart urban water \nsystems in selected cities constructed or rehabilitated; (ii) knowledge of sponge city and smart \nwater technology application that promotes increased resilience of women to climate change and \ndisasters  increased;  and  (iii)  SZWG\u2019s  gender  inclusiveness  improved.

Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. By supporting greater gender \ninclusiveness at SZWG, the project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priority 2 \n(accelerating progress in gender equality). The project will include a gender action plan. It is \naligned with operational priority 3 (tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, \nand enhancing environmental sustainability) by supporting the establishment of sponge cities to \naddress flood risks and improving energy efficiency through the use of smart water technologies. \nBy supporting water quality improvements, reducing pollution, and enhancing water efficiency \nin PRC cities, the project is also aligned with operational priority 4 (livable cities). The project \nsupports the strategic priorities of ADB\u2019s water operational plan 2011\u20132020 and the objectives \nlaid out in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020 to manage climate \nchange and the environment and to develop green cities.11 \n \n19.  Lessons from previous operations. The ADB-supported Jiangxi\u2013Pingxiang Integrated \nRural\u2013Urban Infrastructure Development Project showed that rigorous demand analyses and \neffective policy dialogue on cost recovery benefited urban water planning and ensured investment \nsustainability. 12  ADB\u2019s  Jilin  Yanji  Low-Carbon  Climate-Resilient  Healthy  City  Project \ndemonstrated that sponge city infrastructure yielded multiple benefits, including effective defense \nagainst flooding; better water absorption filtering and purifying; increased biodiversity; and a more \nconducive environment for recreation, walking, and cycling.13 In light of progress achieved on \nsustainable green growth, ADB should support the transformation of traditional urban water \nutilities into comprehensive water environmental management providers and mobilize investment \nfrom the private sector to support sustainable development. \n \nD.

[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nF.  Unique Features \n \n24.  The project was originated and structured through a strong \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach and will \nbe the first joint nonsovereign operation undertaken by East Asia Department (EARD) and Private \nSector Operations Department (PSOD) in the PRC. EARD identified SZWG as a project sponsor \ncandidate  during  an  ADB  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  project  with  the \nGovernment of the PRC. EARD and PSOD subsequently worked together with the company to \nprocess this nonsovereign operation. ADB supported SZWG\u2019s efforts to obtain a shadow credit \nrating from Standard & Poor\u2019s, which, with the underscoring of support from the Shenzhen \nMunicipal Government, improved its credit rating in ADB\u2019s pricing tools.14 In addition, the Water \nSector Group of Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDCC) provided \nadvice on climate-resilient and smart water techniques and technologies. The combination of the \nsector knowledge of EARD and SDCC and PSOD\u2019s transaction expertise and skills has provided \n \n14  ADB. 2017.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance to SZWG and SZWEIC is a loan of up to the equivalent of \n$200 million in yuan from its ordinary capital resources. The loan has a maturity of up to 10 years \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]. The loan will be channeled through shareholder \nloans or equity investments to subprojects controlled by SZWG and SZWEIC. \n \n26.  During the life of the loan, SZWG, SZWEIC, and their subproject companies are bound by \nfinancial, operational, and safeguards covenants stipulated in the facility agreement, including the \nsubmission  to  ADB  of  regular  monitoring  reports  on  finance,  operations,  development \neffectiveness, and requirements to meet covenants typical for this type of transaction. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s assistance provides the following additionality: \n \n(i)  Financial additionality. ADB\u2019s assistance is designed to improve efficiency by \nbundling subprojects that are too small or costly to be financed on a stand-alone \nbasis. Without ADB support, SZWG would have to raise financing for each separate \nsubproject through the local branches of commercial banks where the subproject is \nlocated. ADB adds value by linking the cluster of projects with the wider financing \ncommunity, including international financial institutions. ADB\u2019s facility will have a \ncatalytic role in mobilizing private sector resources through various cofinancing \narrangements during project implementation. \n(ii)  Nonfinancial additionality. ADB\u2019s engagement will promote gender inclusiveness \nin SZWG\u2019s operations and support knowledge that increases the resilience of \nwomen to climate change and disasters through the gender action plan. This will \nmake SZWG\u2019s human resource management policy more supportive of gender \nmainstreaming, and the number of women managers at SZWG will increase. ADB \nwill also enhance SZWG\u2019s environmental and social management system (ESMS) \nas a condition precedent to the first loan disbursement. \n(iii)  Knowledge sharing. Based on ADB\u2019s continuous knowledge sharing and policy \ndialogue  with  the  Government  of  the  PRC  (para.  5),  the  project  will  have  a \ndemonstration impact and disseminate knowledge for the industry beyond SZWG. \nADB and SZWG will co-organize knowledge events to promote regional and global \nlearning on climate-resilient and smart water infrastructure. \n \n28.  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  A  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \n ", "7 \n \nindigenous peoples.15 Potential environmental and social impacts have been identified. Although \nADB does not anticipate category A involuntary displacement impacts from SZWG subprojects, \nthis classification will enable SZWG to utilize ADB loan proceeds to address any displacement of \nmore than 200 people by any sponge city subproject. Consolidated measures to avoid, minimize, \nmitigate, and compensate affected people for potential adverse impacts are in the safeguard \nreports and management plans. SZWG has sufficient institutional capacity and commitment to \nmanage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts.  \n \n30.  Environmental and social audit findings and recommendations. An external expert \nundertook due diligence in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements for \ngeneral corporate finance. Due diligence included a corporate audit of SZWG\u2019s ESMS and four \nsite  audits  at  water,  wastewater  treatment,  and  sponge  city  facilities.  The  corporate  audit \ndetermined that SZWG was in compliance with applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions \nin which it operates. However, in terms of the objectives, principles, and requirements of ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement, some gaps were identified. The company\u2019s environmental and social \nsystems, processes, and practices were assessed as commensurate with the risks and impacts \nassociated with its business and operations. The aspects reviewed during due diligence include \nodor  and  noise  nuisance,  waste  management,  hazardous  substance  management,  sludge \ndisposal, and occupational health and safety. SZWG did not have a land procurement procedure \nin place to identify and manage unresolved or potential future displacement impacts. This was \ndue largely to the fact that municipal governments carry out land procurement in the PRC and \naward land-use rights under concession agreements. As SZWG has not had and does not expect \nto have adverse or beneficial impacts on ethnic minority groups, its consideration of such groups \nin subproject planning was based on national law. \n \n31.   [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n32.  SZWG has agreed to all audit findings and recommendations, which were reflected in the \nproject\u2019s corrective action plan. As an initial action, SZWG, assisted by ADB, will develop an \nESMS that satisfies ADB requirements. ADB assistance has included drafting of specific ESMS \nprocedures, and ADB will also support staff training. The ESMS will include an environmental and \nsocial compliance audit procedure for SZWG to confirm that subprojects utilizing ADB loan \nproceeds comply with ADB requirements. SZWG will submit each subproject audit to ADB for \napproval before disbursement. Compliance audits will be disclosed on the ADB website. SZWG \nwill  submit  annual  reports  on  each  ADB-financed  subproject  to  ADB  to  confirm  ongoing \ncompliance with ADB requirements set out in the ESMS. \n \n33.  Effective gender mainstreaming. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development \n(1998), SZWG has incorporated measures to promote gender equality and/or the empowerment \nof women in its business activities. ADB conducted a gender analysis of SZWG during project \npreparation. The gender action plan calls for (i) increasing the number of women in mid-level or \nhigh-level management; (ii) developing SZWG\u2019s human resource policy to include measures that \nincrease the proportion of women staff recruited, retained, and promoted; (iii) increasing the \nproportion of female employees participating in professional training that can help advance their \ncareers;  and  (iv)  developing  a  knowledge  product  on  how  sponge  city  and  smart  water \ntechnologies can help women become more resilient to the effects of climate change and \ndisasters. SZWG will submit periodic reports on the implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \n \n15 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "8 \n \n34.  SZWG will (i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, (ii) ensure that investments \nusing ADB funds comply with the Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by national laws and \nregulations, and (iii) establish and maintain an ESMS that is satisfactory to ADB before loan \ndisbursement.  The  ESMS  requires  implementation  of  applicable  national  labor  laws  and \nregulations, in accordance with the labor elements of ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001). \nThe ESMS also contains requirements, as applicable, for information disclosure and consultation \nwith affected people following ADB requirements. SZWG will regularly report to ADB confirming \n(i) its and its subprojects\u2019 compliance with such laws and (ii) the measures taken. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n35.  SZWG was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n36.  The proposed direct loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n37.  Consistent with the \u2018Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank\u2019 (the Charter),16 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of the \nPRC has no objection to the proposed assistance to SZWG and SZWEIC. ADB will enter into \nsuitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of \nthe proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \n$200,000,000 equivalent in yuan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to Shenzhen Water \n(Group) Co., Ltd. and Shenzhen Water and Environment Investment Group Co., Ltd. for the \nClimate-Resilient and Smart Urban Water Infrastructure Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nwith such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this \nreport, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n \n3 August 2020 \n \n16 ADB. 1966.
