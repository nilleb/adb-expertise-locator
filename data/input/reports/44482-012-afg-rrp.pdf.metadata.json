The investments, physical and nonphysical in nature, \nwill  add  to  those  already  being  supported  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  other \ndevelopment  partners.  The  aim  is  to  further  improve  domestic  and  regional  connectivity  while \nwidening  access  to  social  and  economic  opportunities.  The  effort  will  facilitate  investment  into \nkey  strategic  industries,  including  mining  and  related  services.  The  result  will  be  growth,  jobs, \nwelfare  and  trade.  Providing  better  links  from  Central  Asia  to  markets  in  the  south,  east,  and \nwest  will  generate  transit  fees  but  also  new  business  opportunities  to  companies  across \nAfghanistan. The road network is incomplete, mostly in bad shape, and the railway network is in \nits  infancy.  Capital  outlays  in  both  networks  will  cut  transport  costs,  increase  competitiveness, \nand  raise  productivity.  A  modern  and  efficient  multimode  system  reduces  poverty,  and \ncontributes to inclusive economic growth and stability. \n\n3. \nRoads  serve  90%  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  travel  demand.  The  network  is  overstretched  while \nvehicles numbers are rising fast. Since 2009, there are 23% more cars, 15% more trucks, 48% \nmore motorcycles, and 2% more buses on the roads. Freight is carried mainly in private trucks \nsince rail transport is too new and limited and air transport is too expensive. More than 85% of \nroads are in poor condition, with large portions, particularly in rural areas, impassable. Only 15% \nof  planned  national  highways  have  been  built.  The  investment  program  will  invest  in  almost  \n600 km of roads, or 7% of the total national and regional highway network.  \n\nAfghanistan  needs  railways  for  development.  Its  strategic  location  and  recent  finds  of \n4. \nmineral and ore deposits add to railway relevance. Less than 100 kilometers (km) of track have \nbeen built so far. This includes the 75 km railway line constructed between Hairatan and Mazar-\ne-Sharif  (Railway  Project),  a  project  completed  in  2011  with  ADB  funding.2 This  is  the  first  rail \nproject  in  Afghanistan\u2019s  history.  To  be  viable,  the  network  must  grow.  Future  expansion  plans \ninclude a new section from Mazar-e-Sharif to Bamyan to the newly discovered mineral centers.3  \nOther  sections  will  link  Mazar-e-Sharif  to  Andkhoy  in  the  northwest,  and  eventually  run  from \nAndkhoy  to  Herat.  Sections  from  Iran  to  Herat  and  Kandahar  to  Spin  Boldak  are  also  under \nconsideration.  The  entire  network  will  be  based  on  the  Central  Asian  gauge  system.  This  will \nmake  the  railway  relevant  and  competitive,  and  facilitate  north-south  trade.  Central  Asia  is  a \nconduit for mineral exporters who will rely on Afghanistan\u2019s railway network. \n\nThe  road  subsector  faces  four  main  problems:  (i)  a  small  network  in  a  poor  state  of \n\n5. \nrepair,  (ii)  weak  institutional  capacity,  (iii) lack  of  quality  contractors  and  consultants,  and         \n(iv)  limited  construction  materials.  Together  with  insecurity,  these  bottlenecks  lead  to  higher \nthan average construction and maintenance costs. They also affect timelines for construction.4 \nDespite this, ADB projects are experiencing reasonable success in the subsector. Road projects \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework for the investment program is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Asian Development \n\n \n\nFund Grant to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Hairatan to Mazar-e-Sharif Railway Project. Manila. \n\n3  Funding is likely to be extended by the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n4  Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nfunded  by  ADB  are  subject  to  cost  overruns,  but  on  the  whole  they  have  been  built  to  high \nstandards  and  through  transparent  procurement  arrangements.  Getting  projects  built  on  time, \nwithin  budget,  and  to  high  standards  is  possible  but  requires  innovative  approaches.  \nThe Railway Project started in 2010 is one of the fastest ever implemented  by ADB. This was \nachieved  largely  on  account  of  four  actions:  (i)  outsourcing  of  the  supervision  function; \n(ii) reliable security arrangements during implementation; (iii) use of a fixed price, fixed delivery \ncontract  with premiums and  penalties;  and  (iv) regular monitoring  by  ADB  teams  in  Kabul  and \nheadquarters. A contract just awarded to complete the last 230 km of the Ring Road will follow a \nsimilar approach.  \n\n6. \nStrategic  context  and  roadmap.  The  Afghanistan  National  Development  Strategy \n(ANDS)  represents  the  strategic  framework  for  development  between  2008\u20132020.  The  ANDS \ninfrastructure pillar aims at establishing a safe and integrated network to ensure good domestic \nand international connectivity at a low cost. A roadmap for the sector identifies short, medium, \nand  long  term  investments  covering  roads,  rail,  and  airports.  5  This  roadmap  outlines  the \nsequencing  of  physical  investments,  actions,  and  reforms  required  to  stimulate  institutional \neffectiveness.  The  investment  requirement  up  to  2020  exceeds  $3  billion. 6  ADB's  Country \nPartnership Strategy (CPS) for 2009\u20132013 is aligned with ANDS. The regional agenda figures \nprominently in the CPS and transport sector roadmap. Afghanistan is a transit country or \u201ccenter \nof  gravity\u201d  and  is  one  of  the  most  active  members  of  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation  (CAREC)  program.  Of  the  six  identified  CAREC  corridors,  three  traverse \nAfghanistan.  Recent  ADB  projects  in  the  transport  sector  have  been  funded  under  a \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF),  now  fully  utilized.  7  Supporting  new  priority  projects \nrequires  a  new  MFF.  The  strategy  and  roadmap  underpinning  the  first  MFF  remains  valid  for \nthis new MFF. \n\n7. \nPolicy  framework.  The  transport  sector  benefits  from  a  clear  policy  framework  that \noutlines the vision and principles for investment, maintenance, institutional change and reform. \nIt also outlines the need for better planning and oversight, cost recovery, and adherence to best \npractices on procurement, safety, governance as a whole,  gender considerations, construction \nstandards,  and  traffic  management.  Institutional  effectiveness  also  includes  a  call  for  better \nbudgeting  and  financial  management,  information  systems  to  monitor  performance,  evaluation \nand reporting, and training of Afghans. The framework focuses on multimode systems.  \n\n8. \nNew  MFF.  The  government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  new  MFF  for  financing \npriority  road  and  rail  projects  over  the  next  few  years.  The  new  MFF  has  more  or  less  firm \ntranches (except for the first, each tranche is subject to final due diligence). These tranches are \nsplit  between  road  and  rail  interventions.  The  MFF  is  the  preferred  funding  modality  given  its \nflexibility  and  ability  to  sequence  investments.  All  the  preconditions  for  the  MFF  are  in  place, \nincluding the existence of a coherent strategy, sector roadmap, investment and financing plans, \nand  policy  framework.  The  new  MFF  amounts  to  $805  million.  This  will  consolidate  the \npartnership  started  under  the  existing  MFF.  Lessons  learned  from  past  operations  are \nincorporated  in  the  new  MFF  (footnote  4).  The  most  important  revolve  around  new \nimplementation  arrangements  including  the  use  of  larger  turnkey  contracts,  higher  contractor \nand consultant quality, new contract modalities, independent project management, and regular \nADB team involvement.  \n                                                \n5  The Transport and Civil Aviation Sector Strategy within ANDS is commonly referred to as the Transport Sector Strategy. \n6  Ministry of Mines. May 2011. National-Regional Integrated Resource Corridor Initiative (NRIRCI). Kabul. \n7  ADB.  2008.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Multitranche \nFinancing  Facility  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  the  Road  Network  Development  Investment  Program. \nManila. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\n9. \nThe impact of the investment program will be increased trade and jobs. The outcome will \nbe increased movement of goods and services and better connectivity for people and businesses.  \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nThe  outputs  include  (i)  about  578  km  of  reconstructed  or  rehabilitated  regional  and \nnational  roads,  (ii)  225  km  of  constructed  railway  and  stations  between  Mazar-e-Sharif  and \nAndkhoy, (iii) efficient operation and maintenance (O&M) of the Hairatan to Mazar railway line, \n(iv)  strengthened  capacity  at  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (MPW),  and  (v)  improved  transport \nsector governance.  \n\n11. \nThe  outputs  under  tranche  1  include  145  km  of  improved  road  sections:  (i)  50  km \nbetween Bagramy\u2013Sapary road, (ii) 51 km between Jabul Saraj\u2013Nijrab, and (iii) 44 km between \nFaizabad\u2013Beharak.  Tranche  1  will  also  support  the  Railway  Project  O&M  contract,  including \nadditional project facilities and equipment to ensure its efficiency. The capacity component will \ndeliver  a  new  governance  needs  assessment;  a  revised  national  road  and  rail  transport  plan; \nassistance  to  the  rail  authority  and  a  detailed  feasibility  study  and  design  work  for  the  new \nMazar-e-Sharif  to  Andkhoy  railway.  Other  outputs  include  special  assistance  to  improve \nplanning  at  MPW;  a  new  road  and  rail  asset  management  system;  procurement,  financial \nmanagement, safeguards plans; evaluation, monitoring and reporting and training.  \n\n12. \nFuture tranches under the MFF are fairly firm. Tranche 2 will reconstruct the remaining \n106  km  section  of  the  Kabul  to  Jalalabad  road,  the  remaining  112  km  of  the  Faizabad  to \nEshkashem road, and 33 km of the Lashkar Gah to Gereshk road. Tranche 3 will construct the \nMazar-e-Sharif  to  Andkhoy  railway,  and  most  likely  reconstruct  the  first  101 km  section  of  the \nDar-i-Suf to Yakawlang road. Tranche 4 will reconstruct the remaining 81 km section of the Dar-\ni-Suf  to  Yakawlang  road.  Each  future  tranche  will  also  cater  for  capacity  support,  feasibility \nstudies, and other \u201csoft\u201d investments.  \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Plan \n\nAfghanistan\u2019s  overall  road  and  rail  investment  plan  up  to  2020  exceeds  $3  billion.  \n13. \nThe rail network is the least complete and the most expensive ($2.5 billion). Remaining priority \nroad  investments  run  to  $1  billion.  The  more  medium  term  part  of  this  plan  (up  to  2017)  is \nestimated to cost $2.7 billion.  \n\nThe  investment  program  will  cost  $805  million  equivalent.  Subprojects  financed  under \n14. \nTranche 1, including taxes, duties, and physical contingencies will cost $232 million equivalent. \nTable  1  summarizes  the  costs  estimates  and  illustrates  how  the  investment  program  fills  a \nsignificant gap in Afghanistan\u2019s overall land transport network development plans. \n\nTable 1: Investment Program \n($ million) \n \n\nItem \nLong Term Investment Plan (2011\u20132020) \n\n1.

ADB  support  will  be  channeled  through  the  new  MFF  and  the  Afghanistan \nInfrastructure Trust  Fund  (AITF).    Although  still  evolving,  two  countries (Japan  and  the  United \nKingdom) have already contributed funding to the AITF. Others are considering doing the same. \nThe  MFF  is  being  structured  as  follows:  (i)  up  to  $754  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources  (the  Asian  Development  Fund  [ADF]),  and  (ii)  a  grant  of  $33  million  from  the  AITF \nadministered  by  ADB.8 Finance  extended  under  the  MFF  will  cover  the  business  receipts  tax \n(BRT).9 This is the practice also followed by the World Bank in Afghanistan.  \n\n16. \nApproval  of  finance  under  the  MFF  will  be  subject  to  the  government\u2019s  submission  of \nperiodic financing requests (PFRs), execution of related grant and/or loan agreements for each \ntranche,  and fulfillment of  the terms  and  conditions  and  undertakings set  out  in  the framework \nfinancing  agreement  (FFA).  The  government  has  been  informed  that  the  allocation  of  ADF \nresources is subject to (i) the availability of ADF resources from time to time, (ii) Afghanistan\u2019s \naccess  to  such  resources  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  then  applicable  Graduation  Policy 10  and  the \nrequirements of ADF donors, and (iii) availability of such resources to Afghanistan pursuant to \nADB\u2019s then applicable policy on the performance based allocation of ADF resources11 and other \n\n                                                \n8  ADB. 2010.

Afghanistan\u2019s position will be reviewed during the course of the investment \nprogram. It cannot be ruled out therefore that its eligibility for grant financing will not change.  \n\nGrant  financing  from  ADF  resources  will  be  made  available  under  the  Special \n17. \nOperations  Grant  Regulations  subject \nthe  grant  agreements.  \nLoan financing from ADF resources will be made available under the Special Operations Loan \nRegulations subject to any modifications in the loan agreements.

In \n2011,  the government  concluded  a  three  year  performance-based O&M  services  contract  with \nan  affiliate  of  the  Uzbekistan  State  Railway  Company,  SE  Sogdiana  Trans  (O&M  Contract).13 \nBased on the O&M Contract terms and expected revenue yields,14 railway O&M is expected to \nbecome  self-sustaining  when  the  freight  volume  reaches  3.8  million  tons  per  year.  Volumes \nbelow  this  benchmark  need a  subsidy. The government requested  ADB  to  provide  $17 million \nover  3  years  to  meet  part  of  the  O&M  financing  gap.15 The  scope  of  the  Railway  Project  was \nchanged  in  June  2011  to  incorporate  a  new  O&M  component.  It  also  applied  $4  million  in \nsavings  under  the  project  to  help  finance  the  gap  during  the  first  year  of  operation.  The \ngovernment requests that ADB provide additional financing of up to a further $13 million under \ntranche 1 of the MFF to help meet the expected financing gap. Separately, the government also \nrequests  a  further  $20  million  under  tranche  1  to  cover  some  civil  works,  equipment,  and \ninspection  services  needed  to  operate  the  railway.  The  request  complies  with  eligibility \nrequirements  for  additional  financing.16 Moreover,  activities  proposed  for  additional  financing \nunder  tranche  1  are  consistent  with  development  objectives  of  the  Railway  Project.  However, \nthe policy currently applicable to MFFs restricts the use of MFF funds for additional finance  to \nfunding  for  \u201cprice  or  financing  arrangement  changes\u201d.17 In  this  instance,  it  is  proposed  that \n\n                                                \n12 ADB. 2010.

ADB funds will be utilized for O&M support to the extent \nthat  revenues  fall  short  of  the  break  even  threshold.  Financial  sustainability  is  expected  by  the  third  year  of \noperations.  \n\n16 A February 2011 review mission confirmed that project progress is on schedule and that safeguard requirements \n\nhave been met, risks adequately mitigated, and implementation is highly satisfactory. \n\n17 ADB.  2010.

Moreover, it is not considered feasible to \ncreate  a  separate  stand-alone  project  for  these  ancillary  O&M  activities.  Other  aspects  of \ntranche 1 are described in the PFR. \n\nfor  additional \n\nADB  transport  sector  projects  in  Afghanistan  have  experienced  regular  cost  overruns \n20. \nand/or financing gaps. In view of this, it is proposed that investment program funds be used to \nprovide additional financing to other ongoing ADB transport sector projects whenever these are \nconsistent  with  eligibility  requirements,  existing  ADB  policies  and  procedures,  the  investment \nprogram and as agreed between the government and ADB.  \n\n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nMedium Term Investment Plan \n\nTransport Network Development Investment Program  \nAfghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund  \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China  \nGovernment of Afghanistan \nOthers  \n             Total       \nTransport Network Development Investment Program \n\n \n\nAsian Development Bank a \nAfghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund b \nGovernment of Afghanistan \n\n             Total       \nTranche 1 \n\nAsian Development Bank \nAfghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund \nGovernment of Afghanistan \n\n             Total       \n\nAmount  \n\n \n\n754.0 \n33.0 \n1,320.0 \n108.0 \n435.0 \n2,650.0 \n\n754.0 \n33.0 \n18.0 \n805.0 \n \n189.0 \n33.0 \n10.0 \n232.0 \n\nShare of Total (%) \n \n28.5 \n1.2 \n49.8 \n4.1 \n16.4 \n100.0 \n \n93.7 \n4.1 \n2.2 \n100.0 \n \n81.5 \n14.2 \n4.3 \n100.0 \n\na Opportunities for additional Afghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund (AITF) cofinancing will be explored.  \nb  Contributors: Governments of Japan and United Kingdom.

A  project \nmanagement office (PMO) set up under the existing MFF will administer the program. A project \nimplementation unit established within the PMO to implement the Railway Project will continue \nto oversee activities related to the railway. \n\nThe  government  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  procedures,  including  the  Procurement \n22. \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time), Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by ADB \nand its Borrowers (2010, as amended from time to time) and the Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  government  requested  approval  of  retroactive \nfinancing  under  tranche  1  not  exceeding  20%  of  the  aggregate  ADF  grant  and  AITF  grant \namounts  to  cover  eligible civil  works, O&M  equipment  and  consulting  services.  Two  of  the road \n\n                                                \n18 Arguably, proposed funding for the O&M Contract financing gap is a \u201cfinancing arrangement\u201d change. However, as \nthis element is inextricably linked with the other proposed O&M activities, the whole additional financing package is \nbeing treated for approval purposes as arising from a change in scope of the project.     \n\n \n\n\fsubprojects included under tranche 119 were originally intended for inclusion in the second tranche \nof the existing MFF. However, following a reallocation of funds to complete the priority Ring Road, \nthese investments were not funded under that tranche. The government proceeded with advance \nactions in the expectation that these subprojects would be covered later under the MFF. Since the \nMFF  does  not  have  any  unallocated  funding  left,  the  government  asked  ADB  to  approve \nretroactive  financing  under  the  new  MFF  to  reimburse  expenditures  incurred  up  to  18  months \nbefore  the  signing  date  of  the  grant  agreement.20 Given  these  circumstances,  and  as  advance \nactions  have  facilitated  project  readiness  and  been  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements, the request is considered justified, and thus proposed as part of the new MFF.  \n\n23. \nO&M  services  for  the  Railway  Project  financed  under  tranche  1  will  be  provided  under \nthe  existing  O&M  Contract.  Railway  O&M  equipment  will  be  procured  on  the  basis  of \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Given  the  role  of  Uzbekistan  State  Railway  Company-\nO\u2019zbekistan Temir  Yo\u2019llari (UTY)  as  the  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  contractor \nfor  the  Railway  Project,  UTY  is  proposed  to  be  appointed  on  a  direct  contracting  basis  to \nundertake the ancillary civil and track works for additional financing under tranche 1.21 This will \nsave considerable time and money. \n\n24. \nSpecific actions to ensure the efficient implementation of future projects under the MFF \ninclude (i) high state of readiness; (ii) large turnkey contract packages; (iii) fixed price and fixed \ndelivery  contracts  with  premiums  and  penalties  against  timelines  and  quality  standards;  and    \n(iv) independent supervision with emphasis on in-house qualified staff for core jobs, quality, and \ndual  reporting  to  ADB  and  MPW.  The  latter  is  fundamental.  It  aids  ADB\u2019s  monitoring  and \nreporting  and  facilitates  the  preparation  of  action  plans  to  correct  poor  performance.  \nThe consultants will be required to clear design proposals and payment requests against agreed \ncontract  schedules.  Project  management  is  to  be  effectively  outsourced.  The  underlying \npremise  is  that  the  quality  of  the  implementation  depends  largely  on  the  quality  of  the \ncontractors  and  consultants.    As  far  as  possible,  projects  will  follow  a  \u201cdesign  and  build\u201d \napproach.  Each  bid  will  be  subject  to  special  features  to  ensure  competition,  efficiency,  and \nquality. All contracts will be subject to audits by independent external consultants.  \n\nImplementation  arrangements  are  captured  in  the  facility  administration  manual \n\n25. \n(Appendix 2) and summarized below.  \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n \n\nArrangements \nSeptember 2011\u2013June 2017 \n30 December 2017 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nProject management \nMinistry of Finance  \n(i) Oversight body \n(ii) Executing agency \nMinistry of Public Works \n(iii)Key implementing agencies  Ministry of Public Works \n(iv)PIU \n\nPMO  \n\nStaff of 25 \n \n \n\n                                                \n19 The Bagramy\u2013Sapary (50 km) and Jabul Saraj\u2013Nijrab (51 km) sections. \n20 ADB\u2019s general rule permits reimbursement for expenditures incurred no earlier than 12 months before the signing \ndate of related grant agreement.

The economic analysis is conservative, \nfocusing on the direct benefits generated from savings in vehicle operating costs and user time. \nNet  economic  benefits  are  expected  to  exceed  the  sum  of  individual  project  cost  estimates. \nBased on the economic internal rate of return (EIRR), net present value (NPV), and sensitivity \nanalysis, the subprojects under tranche 1 are feasible.  \n\nB. \n\nGovernance  \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to, and discussed with, the government and \n27. \nMPW.  Specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  facility \nadministration  manual.  The  government\u2019s  policies  and  procedures  on  financial  management, \nprocurement,  anticorruption,  and  other  institutional  issues  and  mechanisms  were  found  to  be \nsatisfactory. 22  All  bidding  documents  for  contracts  under  the  MFF  will  include  provisions \nspecifying ADB\u2019s right to audit records and accounts related to the MFF, as well as those of all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the MFF. MPW \nand  the  Ministry  of  Finance  will  take  additional  measures  to  strengthen  governance, \naccountability, and transparency under the MFF, primarily with direct payment procedures. Key \nmeasures  are  (i) external  auditing  of  contracts,  project  accounts,  and  financial  statements; \n(ii) transparent  decisions  on  all  procurement  matters;  and  (iii)  verification  of  contractors\u2019 \npayment claims by supervision consultants following contract specifications. \n\n                                                \n22 ADB and World Bank conducted risk assessments of country level systems in 2007 and 2009, respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n28. \nA  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  was  prepared.  As  a  general \nintervention,  the  investment  program  is  expected  to  generate  both  direct  and  indirect  poverty \nreduction impacts. Expected benefits to road and rail users include lower travel times and cost, \nand in the case of roads, lower vehicle operating costs, which will result in higher product profit \nmargins. Expanded access to improved roads and rail will help shift subsistence agriculture into \na more market-based one, allowing farmers to grow commercial products that can be shipped to \nmarkets  more  quickly.  Farmers  may  also  diversify,  cultivate  high-value  crops,  and  grow  larger \nmarketable  surpluses  to  improve  their  income  earning  capacity.  Connectivity  will  create  more \nopportunities for people and businesses and widen access to social services. \n\n29. \nA  gender  action  framework  was  prepared  to  develop  target  activities  to  maximize  the \nbenefits for communities and women along the program roads and rail links. Increased access \nto  social  services,  economic  opportunity,  and  consumer  choice  is  expected  to  significantly \nincrease \nthe  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, and overall poverty reduction. \n\nthe  welfare  of  women,  household \n\nincomes,  achievement  of \n\nD. \n\nSafeguards  \n\n30. \nThe impacts of tranche 1 on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples  were  assessed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  MPW \nhas  prepared the  required  safeguards  documents  and  mitigation measures  in compliance  with \nADB  procedures  and \nthe  public.  \nThe  government  has  further  illustrated  its  collective  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  by \nincreasing  the  number  of  qualified  safeguards  staff  in  the  PMO  and  setting  aside  the  funds \nrequired for land acquisition. \n\nfor  consultation  and  disclosure \n\nrequirements \n\nto \n\n31.  MPW  prepared  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework,  which  sets  out  a \nframework  for  screening,  categorization,  impact  assessment,  management  and  monitoring  for \nthe  investment  program.  Tranche  1  subprojects  are  unlikely  to  result  in  significant  adverse \nenvironmental  impact  and  potential  impacts  can  be  adequately  monitored  and  mitigated. \nTherefore, they are classified as environment category B.  An initial environmental examination \nincorporating an environmental management and monitoring plan was prepared for each of the \nthree road sections included in tranche 1. The new Railway Project investments have minimal or \nno adverse environmental impacts and are classified as category C.  \n\n32.  MPW  prepared  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  for  the  investment \nprogram.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  were  prepared  for  each  of  the  three  road \nsections  in  tranche  1.  The  interventions  are  considered  to  be  significant  and  are  classified  as \ncategory  A  for  involuntary  resettlement.  Following  approval,  these  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  plans  were  disclosed  to  the  public  on  19  July  2011.  The  government  will  finance \nland  acquisition  and  ADB  the  associated  resettlement  costs. Changes  to  the  Railway  Project \nhave no involuntary resettlement impacts and therefore are classified as category C. No people \nwho  can  be  defined  as  indigenous  are  in  the  project  areas.  As  such,  the  indigenous  people\u2019s \nclassification is category C, and indigenous peoples safeguard measures are not required.  \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk management plan. \nThe  main  risks  include  (i)  implementation  delays,  and  (ii)  sustainability  and  reforms.  Security \nalso remains an underlying concern for all work performed in Afghanistan.  \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nRisks \nSecurity \n\nReadiness \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe  Ministry  of  Interior  will  provide  security  to  all  projects.  A  methodology  has  been \nestablished from past projects, with successful results.  \nProject  readiness  will  be  increased  through  advancing  design  work,  safeguards  plans, \nprocurement  of  goods,  works  and  services,  funding  for  land  acquisition  and  all  internal \napprovals prior to ADB approving new tranches. Readiness will eliminate or reduce delays.  \n\nSustainability  Funding will be set aside for operations and maintenance. Planning will be improved, as well \nas  budgeting,  financial  management,  monitoring,  evaluation  and  reporting.  Reforms  will  be \naccelerated, including those leading to greater institutional effectiveness.  New approaches for \nproject management will be put in place, including outsourcing of supervision and monitoring.   \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, MPW = Ministry of Public Works, PMO = program management office.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Ministry of Public Works of Afghanistan. \n \n\nIV. \n\nUNDERTAKINGS AND ASSURANCES  \n\n34. \nThe  government  and  MPW  have  assured  ADB  that  implementing  the  investment \nprogram  will  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as detailed \nin the facility administration manual and grant and/or loan documents. \n\n35. \nThe  government  has  given  ADB  certain  undertakings  for  the  MFF,  as  described  in the \nFFA.  Specific  covenants  agreed  to  by  the  government  and  MPW,  with  respect  to  individual \ntranches  under  the  MFF,  are  set  forth  in  the  grant  and/or  loan  agreements  for  the  respective \ntranches.  \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION  \n\n36. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  would  comply  with  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the provision of loans or grants and the administration of grants under the multitranche \nfinancing  facility  in  an  aggregate  principal  amount  not  exceeding  $787,000,000  equivalent \n(facility amount) to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Transport Network Development \nInvestment Program comprising:
