THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $103 million to Rajasthan Sun Technique Energy Private Limited (RSTEPL) for the \nRajasthan Concentrating Solar Power Project in India. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Launched in January 2010, the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (NSM) is an \ninitiative of the Government of India to promote solar power development in India. The NSM \nenvisages installed solar power generation capacity of 2 gigawatts (GW) by 2013, 10 GW by \n2017, and 20 GW by 2022. Through such projects, the NSM also envisages the development of \na diversified manufacturing base in India of solar power components for the region. Under \nphase 1 of the NSM (2010\u20132013), NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited (NVVN)\u2014the nodal \nagency under the NSM for the procurement of solar power\u2014invited bids for the development of \n470 megawatts (MW) of concentrating solar power (CSP) and 150 MW of solar photovoltaic \ncapacity. Of the 60 companies that participated in the bid process for the CSP projects, seven \nwere  selected  on  the  basis  of  the  discount  offered  to  the  Central  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission feed-in tariff for CSP projects. One of the successful bidders was RSTEPL, a 100% \nsubsidiary of Reliance Power Limited (RPL). \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) was approached by RPL in October 2011 in regard \nto financing for the project. From initial discussions between RPL and ADB, ADB viewed that \nthe project possessed sound fundamentals, including the financial strength of the sponsor, high-\nquality project preparatory work, potential benefits for local manufacturing of solar components, \nand  a  strong  technology  partner.  The  project  is  the  largest  among  the  37  projects  being \ndeveloped under phase 1 of the NSM. The assistance to the project will demonstrate strong \nsupport for the government\u2019s NSM as well as for the further development of solar energy in the \nunderdeveloped  state  of  Rajasthan.  The  project  will  strongly  complement  ADB\u2019s  ongoing \ninitiatives in solar energy in India, including technical assistance to the nodal ministry for the \nNSM, regular training programs on solar energy for financial institutions, and the $150 million \nsolar power generation guarantee facility supporting smaller solar power projects.1 This will be \nADB\u2019s first financing of a CSP project. \n \n2.  Project Design \n4.  The project entails the construction of a 100 MW CSP generation plant near the village \nof Dhursar in Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan state. The project site is 180 kilometers (km) west \nof the city of Jodhpur and 10 km from the Jodhpur\u2013Jaisalmer national highway (NH-114). The \nannual direct normal irradiance2 at the project site is estimated to be 2,071 kilowatt-hours per \nsquare meter, one of the highest in the country. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Guarantee Facility \nfor Solar Power Generation in India. Manila (April). \n2  Direct normal irradiance is the amount of solar radiation received per unit area by a surface that is always held \nperpendicular to the rays that come in a straight line from the direction of the sun at its current position in the sky, \nexcluding solar radiation that is scattered or reflected by atmospheric components in the sky. ", "2  \n5.  The project will use compact linear fresnel reflector (CLFR) technology to capture solar \nenergy  and  convert  water  to  superheated  steam  through  multiple  solar  steam  generators \n(SSGs). The steam produced will be used to drive a steam turbine which will produce electricity. \nSunlight is reflected onto the linear SSGs by a series of flat reflectors or mirrors arranged in \nparallel rows. Based on the sun\u2019s exact position at any given time of the day, the position of the \nmirrors is adjusted through drive motors to reflect the sunlight onto a series of tubes that run the \nlength of the SSGs. Water in the tubes is heated by the sun\u2019s rays up to 400\u00b0 Celsius and \nconverted into saturated and superheated steam. The project consists of approximately 39 \nSSGs each producing steam independently. Steam leaving the SSG tubes is collected in a \npiping system and transported to the steam turbine. \n \n6.  The electricity generated from the project will be evacuated from the project site to the \nexisting 220-kilovolt (kV) Dechu substation of Rajasthan Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited, the \nstate transmission company, through a 30-km 220-kV double circuit transmission line. The \ntransmission line is currently under construction by Dahanu Solar Power Private Limited for a 40 \nMW solar photovoltaic plant adjacent to the project site. \n \n3.  The Borrower and Sponsor \n7.  The borrower, RSTEPL, is a special purpose vehicle set up by RPL exclusively to \ndevelop the project. RPL is a listed group company of the Reliance ADA Group, established to \ndevelop, construct, and operate power projects in India and abroad. The Reliance ADA Group is \none  of  India\u2019s  largest  business  conglomerates  with  a  strong  presence  in  the  energy, \ninfrastructure, telecommunications, media and entertainment, and financial services sectors. \n \n8.  RPL has a portfolio of 33,440 MW of power generation capacity in various stages of \ndevelopment. The operational portfolio is 1,200 MW while 14,460 MW is under construction and \n17,780 MW is under development. Coal-fired power plants (including the three ultra-mega \npower projects\u2014Sasan, Tilaya, and Krishnapatnam) account for 61% of the total portfolio, gas-\nfired plants comprise 25%, and hydropower plants represent 14%. The project is its first solar \nthermal energy project. RPL\u2019s renewable energy pipeline for 2012\u20132017 is in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Renewable Energy Projects Being Developed by Reliance Power Limited  \nCapacity  Year of \nProject  Source  (megawatts) Location  Commissioning \nDahanu Solar Power Project (Phase 1)  Solar  40  Rajasthan  2012 \nRajasthan Concentrating Solar Power Project  Solar  100  Rajasthan  2013 \nVashpet Wind Power Project  Wind  200  Maharashtra  2013 \nDahanu Solar Power Project (Phase 2)  Solar  60  Rajasthan  2014 \nUrthing Sobla Hydroelectric Project  Hydro  400  Uttarakhand  2016 \nSources: Reliance Power Limited annual reports. \n \n9.  During financial year (FY) 2011, RPL generated revenues of Rs105.48 billion and a net \nprofit after tax of Rs7.6 billion on a consolidated basis. As of 31 March 2011, the company had a \nnet worth of Rs168.33 billion.3 RPL is 38.41% owned by Reliance Infrastructure Limited (R-Infra) \nand 42.01% by AAA Project Ventures and other Promoter companies\u2014all of which are part of \nthe Reliance ADA Group. The remaining 19.48% free float is two-thirds held by retail investors \nand one-third by institutional investors. RPL is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the \nNational Stock Exchange. \n \n                                                 \n3  RPL. 2011. Audited Financial Results for the Year Ended 31 March 2011. Mumbai. ", "  3\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n10.  The project is designed to promote sustainable economic growth by diversifying India\u2019s \nenergy mix through the addition of renewable energy capacity. In addition, as one of the first \nCSP initiatives, the building of the project will help demonstrate the feasibility of utility-scale \nCSP  projects  in  India  and  the  operational  performance  in  a  location  (Rajasthan)  where \nsubstantial solar power development is planned during 2012\u20132017. The project also promotes \nthe  efficient  use  of  indigenous  renewable  energy  resources  with  very  limited  emission  of \npollutants or greenhouse gases.  \n \n2.  Outcome \n11.  The project will demonstrate the viability of utility-scale private CSP generation in India \nby generating 242,756 megawatt-hours (MWh)4 of clean energy per annum while delivering \nadequate returns for the private sponsor. \n \n3.  Outputs \n12.  The  successful  implementation  of  the  project  will  result  in  the  construction  and \ncommissioning  of  one  of  India\u2019s  first  utility-scale  CSP  plants  and  increase  solar  power \ngeneration capacity in the country by 100 MW.5 \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n13.  The  project  supports  two  of  the  five  core  operational  areas  of  Strategy  2020\u2014\ninfrastructure  and  environment.6 The  project  is  aligned  with  the  India  country  partnership \nstrategy (CPS), 2009\u20132012. One of the four strategy pillars of the CPS is to support inclusive \nand environmentally sustainable growth through continued focus on infrastructure development \nand enhanced focus on renewable energy. The project is consistent with one key outcome \nindicator of the CPS, which targets addition of at least 70 MW of solar power generation through \nADB assistance by 2012.7  \n \n2.  Consistency with the Energy Policy and the Asia Solar Energy Initiative \n14.  Under  its  Energy  Policy,  ADB\u2019s  investments  will  focus  on  energy  efficiency  and \nrenewable energy projects, as well as expansion of energy access. The policy states that \nsupport for renewable energy projects will be prioritized and broadened, with an objective of \ncreating a framework that makes investing in renewable energy commercially viable. The policy \nenvisages that, in the process of facilitating private investments in renewable energy, ADB will \n                                                 \n4  Average energy production per annum over the operational life of the project. \n5  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n6  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n7  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009\u20132012. Manila. \n ", "4  \nassume greater (but thoroughly assessed) risks and act as a catalyst for investments that the \nprivate sector might not otherwise be willing to make.8 \n \n15.  The project is also directly aligned with ADB\u2019s Asia Solar Energy Initiative, which aims to \n(i) facilitate knowledge sharing and transfer for solar power; (ii) help develop, finance, and \ncommission 3,000 MW of solar power generation capacity in developing member countries \n(DMCs) by May 2013; and (iii) pilot test innovative financing mechanisms and risk mitigation \nmeasures specifically for solar power. The initiative seeks to stimulate solar power development \nin DMCs with the goals of (i) increasing economies of scale to reduce costs and improve solar \nenergy\u2019s competitiveness within the grid; (ii) exploiting solar radiation resources of selected \nDMCs to serve their fast-growing electricity demand and utilize their greater availability of land \ncompared with most developed countries; and (iii) promoting the potential of DMCs to become \nglobal and regional manufacturing hubs for solar technology goods and equipment. CLFR \ntechnology employs relatively simple equipment (e.g., structural steel lattices, steel tubes, flat \nmirrors, and drive motors), which can be manufactured locally. This development will generate \nthe  potential  for  local  manufacturing  of  such  components,  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s \nobjectives under the NSM. In turn, it will reduce the cost of future CSP projects in India. This \nstrategy is in line with ADB\u2019s Asia Solar Energy Initiative. \n \n3.  Consistency with ADB Operations \n16.  The project strongly complements ADB\u2019s current initiatives in solar energy in India. In \nApril 2011, ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved the Solar Power Generation Guarantee Facility, \nwhich will issue partial credit guarantees in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150 million \n(or its equivalent in Indian rupees) in favor of foreign and local commercial financial institutions \nlending  to  solar  power  generation  projects  in  India.  The  facility  will  support  multiple  solar \ngeneration projects up to a maximum individual capacity of 25 MW under a solar power program \nwith the central or state governments. This facility will catalyze commercial lending and private \ninvestment for smaller solar generation projects, while the proposed project along with the \nDahanu Solar Power Project9 (approved by ADB\u2019s Board in November 2011) aims to catalyze \nprivate investment in larger solar generation projects with a capacity greater than 25 MW. The \nlending and guarantee program is complemented by technical assistance provided to the nodal \nministry for the NSM, and a capacity building and training program for commercial financial \ninstitutions  to  better  understand  technical  risks  for  solar  power.  This  highlights  ADB\u2019s \nmultiproduct  approach  to  promoting  private  investment  in  solar  energy  and  its  ability  to \ncustomize based on market needs and associated risks. \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n17.  The project is estimated to cost $414.5 million. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy.

Table 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspect  Arrangements\nRegulatory framework  The CERC and various SERCs have specified RPOs for electric distribution \ncompanies. These RPOs require distribution companies to purchase 0.25%\u20131.00% of \ntheir total electricity requirements from solar energy sources. Distribution companies \ncan use the bundled electricity purchased from NVVN to offset their solar RPOs. \nPrices for solar power sold under the NSM have been competitively bid as a discount \nto the feed-in tariffs established by the CERC for CSP projects. The CERC tariffs are \nevaluated and revised from time to time to take into account capital cost reductions and \nthe bid prices for those projects commissioned in early rounds of tendering. \nOperations arrangements    \nRevenue structure  RSTEPL has entered into a power purchase agreement with NVVN to sell 100% of the \noutput of the project for a period of 25 years at a fixed tariff of Rs11.97 per kWh ($0.24 \nper kWh). NVVN, a 100% subsidiary of the NTPC (a majority state-owned entity), has \nbeen designated as a nodal agency under the NSM for the procurement of solar power. \nNVVN will bundle solar power purchased from the private solar power projects with \nunallocated power from NTPC\u2019s thermal power stations and sell this bundled power to \nthe state discoms. \nImplementation period  Construction of the project is expected to be completed in May 2013. The life of the \npower purchase agreement is 25 years from COD. \nConstruction arrangements   \nEngineering,  RSTEPL has entered into a fixed price turnkey EPC contract with R-Infra for design, \nprocurement, and  engineering, procurement and supply, and construction for development of the CSP \nconstruction   generation plant. The EPC contract includes standard provisions for liquidated \ndamages on schedule and performance and is an arm\u2019s-length contract. \nTechnology supplier  Under the EPC contract, R-Infra will source the proprietary CLFR technology from \nAreva Solar Inc. USA, a world leader in CLFR technology. Areva Solar Inc. USA is a \nsubsidiary of Areva SA France, which is a French public multinational industrial \nconglomerate with a dominant presence in nuclear energy and a growing presence in \nrenewable technologies such as CSP, offshore wind power, and biomass.  \nTransmission line  The project will share the 30-km 220 kV double circuit transmission line being \ndeveloped by Dahanu Solar Power Private Limited for the 40 MW Dahanu Solar Power \nProject, which is adjacent to the project site. \nOperation and  Areva Renewable Energies India Private Limited, a subsidiary of Areva Renouvelables \nmaintenance  SAS (France), will be responsible for O&M of the CSP plant for 5 years from COD.  \nPerformance monitoring  Key performance indicators will be reported by RSTEPL and monitored by ADB and \nother senior lenders. In addition, during the construction phase, ADB will appoint an \nindependent lenders' technical advisor to monitor progress, attend performance testing, \nand verify COD on behalf of the lenders. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; CERC = Central Electricity Regulatory Commission; CLFR = compact linear fresnel \nreflector; COD = commercial operations date; CSP = concentrating solar power; EPC = engineering, procurement, \nand construction; km = kilometer; kV = kilovolt; kWh = kilowatt-hour; MW = megawatt; NSM = Jawaharlal Nehru \nNational Solar Mission; NVVN = NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited; O&M = operation and maintenance; R-Infra = \nReliance Infrastructure Limited; RPO = renewable purchase obligation; RSTEPL = Rajasthan Sun Technique Energy \nPrivate Limited; SERC = state electricity regulatory commission. \nSource: Rajasthan Sun Technique Energy Private Limited. \n \n ", "6  \nF.  Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n19.   The  project  is  financially  viable  and  is  economically  sustainable,  as  the  economic \ninternal rate of return is higher than the social discount rate. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n20.  The ADB loan of up to $103 million to RSTEPL to finance the construction of the project \nwill be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources without government guarantee. The ADB \nloan will have a tenor of up to 18 years, including a grace period of up to 24 months, and will be \nrepaid semiannually. The ADB loan will carry an interest rate as well as other fees as approved \nby ADB\u2019s investment committee. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n21.  The proposed transaction merits ADB\u2019s assistance for the following reasons: \n(i)  The ADB assistance will provide long-term, limited recourse financing, which is \nnot readily available for large solar power generation projects in India. \n(ii)  The project will use CLFR technology, which has only been commercially proven \nat a smaller scale.  ADB has structured its loan in a manner that will help mitigate \nkey technology and operational risks, and thus help demonstrate the viability of \nthis technology in developing Asia. The successful operation of a large scale \nCSP project will promote further development of the technology. \n(iii)  The project will promote the efficient use of a relatively untapped, indigenous \nenergy resource for electricity generation. Once commissioned, the project will \nbe one of the first large-scale concentrating solar power projects in developing \nAsia. \n \n \nC.  Risks \n22.  Technology risk. CLFR is a relatively new CSP technology and has been in commercial \noperations since 2009 at a smaller scale. Over 450 MW of CLFR-based CSP projects are \ncurrently under development around the world, of which only 16 MW is currently operational. \nThe largest CLFR project currently in operation is AREVA Solar USA\u2019s 5 MW plant in California. \nA 30 MW CLFR project is scheduled to be commissioned in Spain in March 2012. Thus, the \nlong-term performance of CLFR technology is not yet proven and the project will be subject to \nperformance and scale-up risks. However CLFR technology is much less complex than other \nCSP technologies as it does not involve the use of heat transfer fluids, heat exchangers, curved \nmirrors, imported absorption tubes, or complex tracking systems. The performance warranties \nprovided by AREVA Solar USA will mitigate this risk. \n \n23.  Off-taker risk. RSTEPL will sell 100% of the output of the project to NVVN, a subsidiary \nof NTPC Limited (a majority state-owned enterprise) at a fixed tariff of Rs11.97 ($0.24) per \nkilowatt-hour for 25 years. NVVN will bundle solar power from this project with unallocated \nthermal power from NTPC and sell it to the state distribution companies through a separate \npower supply agreement. Multiple defaults or payment delays by  various state distribution ", "  7\ncompanies could make it difficult for NVVN to honor its obligations under the power purchase \nagreement with RSTEPL.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n24.  Supply and installation risk. The construction period is expected to be 17 months. All \nmajor contracts have been executed and construction preparatory works have commenced. \nHowever, a delay in the commercial operations date will result in loss of revenue to the project. \nThe schedule liquidated damages specified in the engineering, procurement, and construction \n(EPC) contract mitigate this risk.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n25.  Operation and maintenance risk. Areva Renewable Energies India Private Limited, a \n100% subsidiary of Areva Renouvelables SAS (France), will be responsible for operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) for the first 5 years. O&M for the plant will be primarily limited to ensuring \nadequate cleaning of the mirrors and receivers as well as routine and periodic maintenance of \nthe steam turbine. The comprehensive performance guarantees specified in the EPC contract \nand the availability guarantees specified in the O&M contract mean that the residual O&M risk \nbeyond 5 years is not considered significant after operations have been normalized. After 5 \nyears, the O&M activities will likely be undertaken directly by RSTEPL. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n26.  Foreign  exchange  risk. The ADB loan will be denominated in US dollars, but the \nproject revenues will be in Indian rupees without any pass through of the foreign exchange risk. \nThe loan documentation will specify hedging requirements and/or sponsor support for mitigating \ncurrency fluctuations.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n27.  Interconnection  risk.  The  project  will  be  connected  to  the  Dechu  substation  of \nRajasthan Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited through the 30 km 220 kV transmission line being \nbuilt by Dahanu Solar Power Private Limited. A delay in construction of the transmission line will \nresult in loss of revenue for the project. Construction of the transmission line has commenced \nand is scheduled to be completed by March 2012. The project is scheduled to be completed by \nMay 2013. Thus, there is sufficient margin to account for any delay in construction of the \ntransmission line. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE  \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n28.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been \nidentified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. The institutional capacity and \n ", "8  \ncommitment of RSTEPL to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed \nadequate. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n29.  RSTEPL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing international best practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe  loan  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n30.  The proposed loan is within the medium term country, industry, group, and single-project \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n31.
