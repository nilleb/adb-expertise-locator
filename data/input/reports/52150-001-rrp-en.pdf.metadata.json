following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $60,000,000 (or its yuan equivalent) to Zhujiang Financial Leasing Company Limited (ZFL) \nfor the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Finance in Underdeveloped Regions Project in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n \n2. \nThe project entails the Asian Development Bank (ADB) providing longer-tenor financing \nto  ZFL  for  lease  finance  to  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  located  in  the \nunderdeveloped central and western regions of the PRC. ADB\u2019s financing will meet ZFL\u2019s funding \nrequirements for medium-term funding, which is in short supply in the PRC. This will enable the \ncompany  to  provide  longer-tenor  lease  finance  to  underserved  segments,  improve  its  asset\u2013\nliability profile, and diversify its funding sources. Being the first development finance institution \nlender, ADB will also add value by helping ZFL enhance its safeguards capacity. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nAfter  more  than  three  decades  of  strong  economic  growth  in  the  PRC,  the  real  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth rate slowed to 6.7% in 2016 and 6.9% in 2017. ADB estimates \nthat GDP growth will be 6.4% in 2018.1 Despite rapid economic growth since the 1980s, regional \ndisparity  and  income  inequality  remain  a  major  issue.  Economic  development  in  central  and \nwestern regions lags significantly behind that in the coastal region in the east, where most foreign \ndirect  investment  and  export-oriented  industries  are  located.  Measured  by  GDP  per  capita,  all \nprovinces ranked in the lower half are located in the central and western regions. In 2016, the \nGDP  per  capita  in  the  western  province  of  Gansu  was  only  23%  of  that  in  Beijing,  and  the \ndisposable income per capita was only 28%. Strong economic growth has lifted more than 600 \nmillion people out of poverty between 1990 and 2010. However, over 65 million people were still \nliving  below  the  national  poverty  line  (average  annual  income  per  person below  CNY2,300)  in \n2016 most of whom lived in the central and western regions.2 There are currently 592 poverty-\nstricken counties designated by the central government, covering large rural areas in the central \nand western regions of the PRC. \n \n4. \nDevelopment of SMEs directly contributes to inclusive growth of the PRC economy, given \nthe important role of these enterprises in employment generation. Small businesses with 300 or \nfewer employees account for 98.6% of all firms in the PRC.3 SMEs contributed to over 60% of the \nPRC\u2019s GDP and approximately 50% of the country\u2019s tax income, and generated more than 80% \nof the urban employment as of YE2016.4 More job opportunities associated with faster growth of \nSMEs in central and western regions will help reduce regional disparity. According to data from \nthe National Bureau of Statistics, the number of SMEs in the central region grew by 5.8% in 2016 \nand  in  the  western  regions  by  6.6%,  which is  much  higher  than  in the  eastern  region  (0.8%).5 \nDespite the major contribution from SMEs to the country\u2019s economic growth and their role as a \n\n                                                \n1   ADB. 2017.

Beijing. \n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ngrowth driver in the underdeveloped regions, SMEs face significant barriers in accessing credit \nfrom financial institutions. Banks have shown a preference in lending to state-owned enterprises \nand larger enterprises operating in priority sectors identified in domestic industrial policy.  As of \nthe end of 2017 (YE2017), credit to micro and small enterprises represented only 24.7% of total \nbank loans.6 SMEs in central and western regions have more restricted access to finance, with \naverage borrowing costs 0.7% higher than those in the eastern regions.7  \n \n5. \nLeasing industry. The leasing industry can play an important role in a country\u2019s financial \nsystem  as  it  is  particularly  suited  for  financing  SMEs,  which  typically  lack  eligible  collateral \nrequired  for  bank  finance.  The  leasing  industry  has  been  growing  rapidly  in  the  PRC,  filling  a \nfinancing gap left by traditional bank financing. According to the World Leasing Yearbook, new \nleasing  sales  in  the  PRC  expanded  from  $21.88  billion  in  2008  to  $136.45  billion  in  2015, \nrepresenting  a  compound  annual  growth  rate  of  29.9%.  By  YE2016,  total  assets  reached \nCNY2.15  trillion,  a  32.4%  increase  compared  with  the  previous  year.  Total  industry  revenues \namounted to CNY1.54 trillion  with an industry aggregate net profit of CNY26.8 billion.8 Despite \nrapid  growth  since  2008,  the  PRC\u2019s  financial  leasing  industry  still  needs  further  development. \nLease market penetration measured as the ratio of lease finance over all fixed investment in plant \nand equipment in 2016 was only 6.0%, compared with 21.5% in the United States, 33.7% in the \nUnited Kingdom, and high single-digit rates in developed Asian countries such as Japan and the \nRepublic of Korea. The lease penetration rate measured as a percentage of lease finance to total \nGDP was 1.84% in the PRC in 2016, ranking it 17th among 50 countries.9 The leasing industry is \nalso much smaller than the banking industry, with assets totaling CNY232.3 trillion at YE2016. \n \n6. \nADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations  have  been  actively  supporting  leasing  in  the  PRC, \ntargeting a diverse range of development subsectors. ADB has provided $350 million in debt to \nfour  PRC  financial  leasing  companies  for  clean  buses  and  health  care  finance  since  2013.  In \n2017, the ADB Board of Directors approved another $200 million loan to one of the largest leasing \ncompanies in the PRC for green bus leasing.10 ADB identified ZFL as a good partner to support \naccess to finance for SMEs. Established by one of the PRC\u2019s leading rural commercial banks, the \nGuangzhou Rural Commercial Bank (GRCB), ZFL\u2019s operations have a strong development focus \nwith a majority of its leasing portfolio being to SMEs and to clients located in the underdeveloped \ncentral and western regions of the PRC. ZFL has sound corporate governance, an experienced \nmanagement team, developed risk management systems, and good financial performance. \n \nB. \n \nZFL was established in December 2014 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the GRCB and \n7. \nis  a  leasing  company  regulated  by  the  China  Banking  Regulatory  Commission  (CBRC).  The \ncompany has experienced rapid growth since its establishment.  As of YE2017, its total assets \nwere CNY12.50 billion and total equity was CNY1.38 billion.

Unlike \nGRCB  which  is  restricted  to  operations  in  select  cities  in  Guangdong  province,  ZFL  holds  a \nnational license. The company\u2019s leasing operations cover 28 out of the 31 provinces, with a strong \npresence  in  the  underdeveloped  central  and  western  regions.  Its  exposures  in  Guangdong \naccounted for 26% of outstanding lease portfolio by YE2017, followed by three underdeveloped \nprovinces  of  Henan (21%), Guizhou  (11%),  and  Sichuan (9%). Overall, 63%  of ZFL\u2019s  portfolio \nwas in the central and western regions of the PRC. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nC. \n \nOwnership.  Integrity  due  diligence  was  conducted. 11  No  significant  or  potentially \n8. \nsignificant risks were identified. Tax integrity due diligence was not required as the transaction \ndoes not involve intermediate jurisdictions or material related-party transactions.12 As noted, ZFL \nis a wholly owned subsidiary of the GRCB, one of the leading rural commercial banks in the PRC \nand was founded in 1951. As of YE2017, the GRCB ranked 216th among all commercial banks \nin the world and fourth among all rural commercial banks in the PRC in terms of core tier 1 capital. \nIt had total assets of CNY735.7 billion and a nonperforming loan ratio of 1.51% as of December \n2017, well below the industry average of 2.95%. The GRCB was listed on the Hong Kong Stock \nExchange  on  20  June  2017  and  is  rated  as  Baa2  by  Moody\u2019s.  The  GRCB  has  a  diversified \nshareholder structure. Its largest beneficial owner is the Guangzhou municipal government, which \nholds 18.32% of GRCB shares through 14 state-owned enterprises. The remaining shareholders \nare mainly private sector entities and individual investors. There are no other shareholders directly \nor indirectly holding more than a 5% stake in the GRCB. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \nADB will provide a senior secured loan of up to $60 million (or yuan equivalent) with tenor \n9. \nof up to 5 years. The ADB loan will fund lease finance to SMEs located in the underdeveloped \ncentral and western regions of the PRC. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nUse  of  proceeds.  ZFL  will  use  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  debt  financing  to  fund  lease \ncontracts with SMEs located in central and western regions of the PRC. The SMEs are defined \nper  current  policy  and  regulation  promulgated  by  the  government.13 Similarly,  the  central  and \nwestern regions are defined as per current government policy.14 \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n\nManila. \n\n13 In 2011, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and three other government ministries promulgated The \nNotice on Issuing the Provisions on Criteria for Classifying Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, which is used by \nthe CBRC for measuring and monitoring SME finance performance of financial institutions. \n\n14 Central  and  western  regions  are  defined  as  provinces  listed  in  the  latest  Central  and  Western  Regions  Priority \nIndustries for Foreign Investors, promulgated by the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry \nof Commerce. \n\n \n\n\fValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n \n11.  Monitoring. Monitoring of the project will be carried out by ADB over the life of the project. \nZFL will provide ADB with financial and other reports at predetermined regular intervals and as \nrequested. These reports will include (i)  semiannual unaudited financial statements, (ii) annual \naudited financial statements, (iii) annual reporting of the SME lease portfolio financed under the \nADB loan, (iv) annual reports on selected development indicators agreed upon between ADB and \nZFL, and (v) an annual social and environmental performance report on safeguards and social \nprotection compliance. \n \n12. \nEvaluation.  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  will  prepare  and  submit \nmonitoring reports  at  least  annually.  The first report  will  be  submitted no later than 12 months \nafter the first disbursement. \n  \nC. \n \n13. \nProvide  access  to  longer  tenor  debt  in  support  of  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises. The ADB 5-year loan will provide critically needed longer tenor funding to SMEs in \nunderdeveloped regions of the PRC, which face significant barriers in accessing finance. Leasing \nis  a  modality  particularly  suited  for  financing  SMEs,  which  typically  lack  collateral  required  by \ncommercial banks. The ADB loan will improve SMEs\u2019 access to longer term lease finance in the \ntarget regions, thus broadly contributing to economic development and poverty alleviation. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nEnhance  ZFL\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  capacity.  ADB  will  be  the  first \n14. \ninternational  finance  institution  to  provide  any  financing  to  ZFL.  As  a  condition  precedent  for \ndisbursement,  the  company  will  be  required  to  establish  an  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system (ESMS) that meets the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). ADB will continue to work with the company throughout the period of ADB investment to \nenhance the safeguard capacity of the company and support the company\u2019s adherence to high \nsafeguard standards and promote gender-inclusive measures in its operations. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n\nImpacts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nImproved  access  to  lease  finance  for  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized \nenterprises and agribusiness companies through financial leasing. Despite \nthe  importance  of  SMEs  in  job  creation  and  output  generation,  SMEs  still  face \nsignificant barriers to accessing credit from financial institutions. This project will \npromote  access  to  finance  for  SMEs,  thereby  contributing  to  economic \ndevelopment. By targeting SMEs located in underdeveloped central and western \nregions, the  project  will  contribute  to  inclusive growth of  the  PRC  economy  and \nhelp reduce regional disparity. \nDeveloped  financial  leasing  industry.  By  providing  longer  tenor  finance  to  a \nyoung leasing company and introducing international best practice in safeguards, \nthe  project  will  support  the  development  of  the  financial  lease  industry.  Despite \n\n4 \n\n \nA. \n \n15. \n \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nrapid  growth  since  2008, \nis  still \nunderdeveloped,  with  a  leasing  penetration  rate  that  is  below  that  in  other \ndeveloped  markets.  The  current  project  extends  ADB\u2019s  support  to  the  leasing \nindustry beyond the top tier leasing companies previously financed by ADB. \n \n\nthe  PRC\u2019s \n\nfinancial \n\nindustry \n\nleasing \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nOutput.  The  output  will  be  an  increase  in  ZFL\u2019s  lease  financing  capacity  to  SMEs, \n\nOutcome. The project will have the following outcome: enhanced sustainability of ZFL\u2019s \n\n16. \nlease financing capacity to SMEs. \n \n17. \nparticularly those located in underdeveloped regions. \n \nB. \n \n18. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports  four \npriorities identified by ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: (i) poverty reduction and inclusive \neconomic  growth,  (ii)  environment  and  climate  change,  (iii)  middle-income  countries,  and  (iv) \nprivate sector development and operations.15 ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 highlights \nADB\u2019s focus on reducing vulnerability and inequality and promoting inclusive growth in middle-\nincome  countries.  It  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2016\u20132020  for  the \nPRC,  which  prioritizes  supporting  inclusive  economic  growth,  reducing  poverty  and  inequality, \nand promoting private sector development through improving access to finance.16 \n \n19. \nConsistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is aligned \nwith  the  Review  of  ADB\u2019s  2011  Financial  Sector  Operational  Plan,  which  notes  that  ADB  will \nsupport  enhanced  financial  inclusion  of  the  traditionally  underserved,  such  as  SMEs. 17  The \nfinance  sector  operational  plan  review  also  called  for  increased  support  to  leasing  and  other \nfinance  subsectors  such  as  credit  guarantee  and  factoring,  which  supplement  the  commercial \nbanks and play an important role in improving SMEs\u2019 access to finance. ADB\u2019s enhanced poverty \nreduction strategy also states that ADB seeks to promote sound and efficient financial markets to \nimprove access to finance and achieve pro-poor growth.18 As noted, the project builds on previous \nADB support to the leasing industry in the PRC. \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \nThe loan is classified category FI for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, \n20. \nand indigenous peoples. ZFL's existing and likely future portfolios, which are mostly in the SME \nsubsector  with  a  strong  focus  on  agriculture,  health,  education,  tourism,  clean  energy,  and \nenvironmental  protection;  its  corresponding  environment  and  social  risks  and  impacts;  and  its \ncommitment and capacity for environmental and social management have been assessed. The \nmajority of ZFL\u2019s business activities have no or minimal adverse environmental impacts, and are \nunlikely to impact involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples. ZFL has committed to establish \nan appropriate ESMS satisfactory to ADB prior to first disbursement and appoint designated staff \n\n                                                \n15 ADB. 2014.
