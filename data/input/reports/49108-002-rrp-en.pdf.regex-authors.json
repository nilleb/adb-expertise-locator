THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia for the Himachal Pradesh Skills Development Project. \n \n2.  The project will assist the Government of Himachal Pradesh (GOHP) in reforming and \nmodernizing its technical and vocational education and training (TVET) institutions and programs \nto boost the employability of Himachal Pradesh\u2019s youth and improve their employment prospects.1 \nHimachal Pradesh, located in northern India along the lower Himalayas, has a population of 6.8 \nmillion. Despite constraints such as its hilly terrain, poor connectivity, and predominantly rural \npopulation (90%), the state\u2019s economic, poverty, education, and health indicators have improved \nsignificantly since 2000. GOHP has successfully increased school and college enrollments over \nthe past decade. This project will support it in addressing the \u201csecond-generation\u201d challenge of \nproviding relevant and good quality TVET opportunities to its youth to prepare them for the \n \nchanging labor market. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Between FY2005 and FY2014, Himachal Pradesh grew at an average annual rate of 7.8% \ncompared with 7.6% for the Indian economy. Overall poverty declined from 22.9% to 8.1% \nbetween FY2005 and FY2012.2 Rural poverty also declined sharply from 25.6% to 8.5% over this \nperiod. Nearly all villages of Himachal Pradesh have access to electricity. Two-thirds of the rural \nhouseholds have access to sanitation facilities, compared with the all-India average of 30.7%. \nLife expectancy at 70 years is higher than the national average of 66.1 years. Between 1991 and \n2011, Himachal Pradesh\u2019s literacy rate increased from 63.7% to 82.8%. Male literacy rose from \n75.3% to 89.5%, and female literacy from 52.1% to 75.9%. In FY2016, the net enrollment ratio in \nHimachal Pradesh was 67% at the secondary and 54% at the higher secondary level, compared \nwith 51% and 33% for India.3 The gross enrollment ratio in higher education for youth aged 18\u2013\n23 years in 2014\u20132015 was 28.4% for men and 32.5% for women.4  \n \n4.  Despite the increase in secondary school and college enrollment, Himachal Pradesh is \nconstrained by the low employability of its school and college graduates. Like in other states of \nIndia, general education at the secondary and college levels in Himachal Pradesh is weak and \nnot adequately aligned to the needs of the market. The challenge of \u201ceducated unemployment\u201d is \ngrowing.5 The state\u2019s TVET programs are constrained owing to outdated curricula and training \nequipment, limited reach of training facilities, and weak industry links. The TVET programs are \nfragmented across 12 state government departments. Consequently, there are no uniform norms \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided $725,000 in project preparatory technical assistance.

Government of \nIndia, Ministry of Labour and Employment. 2014. Report on Education, Skill Development, and Labor Force, 2013\u2013\n2014. New Delhi.   \n ", "2 \nfor training quality, certification, or placement outcomes. More than 90% of Himachal Pradesh\u2019s \nworkforce has not received any formal skills training. Consequently, dependence on government \njobs remains high. In 2014, 65% of organized sector employment in Himachal Pradesh was in the \npublic sector.6 This is fiscally unsustainable and economically unproductive.7 \n \n5.  There is a significant mismatch between Himachal Pradesh\u2019s economic and employment \nprofiles which should be addressed urgently to tap the state\u2019s human resource base more \neffectively. In FY2014, the primary sector in Himachal Pradesh accounted for only 19% of the \nstate\u2019s gross domestic product but 58.5% of the workforce reflecting its very low labor productivity. \nThe tertiary sector and the secondary sector accounted for 43.0% and 38.0% of the state\u2019s gross \ndomestic product but only 19.0% and 22.5% of the workforce respectively.8 Further, while the \nstate has broad gender parity in school and college enrollment rates, there is sharp disparity in \nthe workforce participation rates. In 2012, the average workforce participation rate was 87% for \nrural men and 73% for urban men, but 63% for rural women and only 28% for urban women.9 As \nHimachal Pradesh continues to urbanize and the share of the services sector grows, it is \nnecessary to expand market-linked TVET opportunities for women. \n \n6.  It is estimated that net demand for skilled workers in Himachal Pradesh will amount to \n515,557 between 2017 and 2022 across various trades such as retail, health care, tourism and \nhospitality, and information technology.10 The state has a narrow demographic window until 2022, \nafter which the share of the working-age population (15\u221259 years) will begin to decline.11 GOHP \nis  keen  to take  advantage  of this  demographic  window  by  providing market-linked  skilling \nopportunities to those aged 15\u201335 years. The Twelfth Five-Year Plan of Himachal Pradesh, \n2012\u22122017 emphasizes the need for \u201cfaster, inclusive, and sustainable development\u201d.12 As part \nof this goal, GOHP aims to enhance livelihood and employment opportunities for the state\u2019s youth. \nIt established the Himachal Pradesh Kaushal Vikas Nigam (HPKVN) as a specialized skills \ndevelopment  company  under  the  Department  of  Planning  (DOP)  in  September  2015,  to \nconsolidate the state\u2019s fragmented TVET programs, align all TVET programs with India\u2019s National \nSkills Qualification Framework (NSQF), and facilitate private sector participation in design and \ndelivery of TVET.13 This approach is aligned with India\u2019s National Policy on Skill Development \nand Entrepreneurship (2015), which encourages states to develop umbrella skills development \n                                                \n6  Government of Himachal Pradesh, Directorate of Employment. 2015.

These levels, graded from 1 to 10, \nare defined in terms of learning outcomes which the learner must possess regardless of whether they are obtained \nthrough formal, nonformal, or informal learning.

Value added by ADB assistance. In June 2016, GOHP approved the Himachal Pradesh \nSkills Development Policy (Him Kaushal), 2016 to guide the reform and scaling-up of skills \ndevelopment  efforts  in  the  state.15 The  project  will  build  HPKVN\u2019s  institutional  capacity  to \noperationalize this policy and deliver the challenging mandate of the state\u2019s skills development \nmission effectively. The project will add value by supporting GOHP in providing NSQF-aligned \nvocational training and livelihood development opportunities to around 65,000 needy youth over \n2017\u22122022,  introducing  3-year  bachelor  of  vocational  education  courses  and  employability \nenhancing skills courses in selected colleges, expanding Himachal Pradesh\u2019s annual TVET \ntraining capacity by 13,000, and extending the reach of quality training facilities and counseling \nservices to underserved parts of the state. The project will fund a menu of short-term and long-\nterm training programs in growth areas including automobiles, electronics, pharmaceuticals, \nretail, tourism and hospitality, banking and financial services, health care, apparel, beauty and \nwellness, construction, and food processing to help the youth of Himachal Pradesh in making the \ntransition from the primary sector to the secondary and tertiary sectors, where job prospects are \nbetter and remuneration levels are higher. These training programs will also expand career \nchoices for women and raise their workforce participation rates. Engagement with industry \nassociations, and monitoring and evaluation of the training programs will be strengthened to \nensure the long-term relevance and sustainability of the reforms being supported by this project. \n \n8.  The  project  reflects  the  priorities  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country \npartnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022, which aims to support India\u2019s efforts in facilitating \ninclusive growth. Skills development is a major priority of the Government of India, and a key \ninstrument for empowering people.16 It is aligned with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, \nwhich emphasizes the need for ADB to focus on post-basic education and TVET to promote \nhuman capital development.17 The experience gained from ADB\u2019s two ongoing loans in the \neducation sector in India reiterates the importance of good quality counseling and placement \nservices for matching trainees to the right types of training programs and job openings, ongoing \ncoordination with industry associations and sector skills councils to ensure market-relevance, and \nclose monitoring and tracking of training programs.18  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The project is aligned with the following impact: a more productive workforce created in \nHimachal Pradesh equipped with market-relevant technical and vocational skills (footnote 15). \n                                                \n14  Government  of  India.  2015.

The project will support the following outputs: \n \n11.  Output 1: TVET in Himachal Pradesh improved and aligned to national standards. \nThe project will support (i) HPKVN in designing and running a flagship training program for \napproximately 55,700 youth focusing mainly on short-term, demand-driven vocational courses \naligned to NSQF levels 3 and 4;20 and (ii) the Department of Higher Education (DOHE) in offering \n3-year bachelor of vocational education courses and employability enhancing skills courses to \napproximately 8,400 students studying in selected colleges. Depending on the background and \naspirations of the trainees and market demand, HPKVN will provide training opportunities for \nformal wage employment or for livelihood and small business development. The latter type of \nsupport will be provided at the city livelihood centers (CLCs) and rural livelihood centers (RLCs) \nto be established under the project. Introduction of bachelor of vocational education (NSQF level \n7) courses in colleges will help to integrate vocational education with higher education and \nestablish a career path. Vocational training will also be provided to third-year college students in \ntrades such as banking, electronics, and retail to make them more employable after graduation. \nOverall, improved TVET opportunities will be provided to around 65,000 needy youth over the \nperiod 2017\u20132022. \n \n12.  Output 2: Market-aligned skills ecosystem created. The project will (i) upgrade 11 \nemployment exchanges into model career centers (MCCs) to build awareness among youth about \nTVET opportunities; (ii) design and operationalize a management information system (MIS) to link \nHPKVN, the Department of Technical Education, Vocational and Industrial Training (DOTE), \nDOHE, and the MCCs to India\u2019s National Career Services portal; and (iii) support HPKVN in \nforging  partnerships  with  industry  associations  and  sector  skills  councils  to  get  demand \ninformation, and identify internship and placement opportunities. The MCCs will have career \ncounselors  for  guiding  the  youth  in  selecting  relevant  TVET  programs,  aligned  with  their \naspirations and market demand. By linking the MCCs to the National Career Services portal, the \nMIS will enable the trained and certified youth of Himachal Pradesh to access job opportunities \nacross India.  \n \n13.  Output 3: Access to quality training institutes improved. The project will (i) establish \nsix CLCs and seven RLCs to provide vocational training and business development support to \nurban and rural poor to improve their livelihood; (ii) assist DOTE in establishing a new polytechnic \nfor women in Rehan, Kangra, as well as a center of excellence for industry-led skilling; and \n(iii) assist DOTE in upgrading the training equipment for 22 trades in 50 industrial training \ninstitutes (ITIs) in line with the 2014 guidelines of the National Council for Vocational Training. \nThe CLCs and RLCs will provide gender-separated hostels to enable trainees from small towns \nand remote villages to access the livelihood and small business development opportunities. The \nwomen\u2019s polytechnic in Rehan will offer diplomas in civil engineering, architectural assistantship, \nelectrical engineering, and computer engineering. It will have an annual training capacity of \naround 720 and hostel facilities for 120 women. By providing new training equipment to 50 ITIs \n                                                \n19  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n20  From 27 December 2016, no central government funding will be provided for TVET programs that are not aligned \nto the NSQF. All announcements for jobs in the central government, state governments, and public enterprises must \ndefine eligibility criteria in NSQF terms. Hence, this project will support the government in aligning all TVET \nprograms to the NSQF so that Himachal Pradesh\u2019s youth receive nationally recognized certificates. \n   ", "5 \nacross 22 trades aligned with the latest guidelines of the National Council for Vocational Training, \nthe project will ensure that around 19,000 students will obtain nationally recognized certificates \nfrom the council. This will make them eligible for jobs in public enterprises and private companies \nwithin and outside Himachal Pradesh. Results-oriented institutional development plans will be \nprepared for these ITIs to ensure that their performance on key indicators such as placement, \nenrollment of women, and industry engagement improves. \n \n14.  Output 4: TVET institutional structure improved. The project will (i) build the project \nmanagement, fiduciary, safeguard, and training capacity of HPKVN and other implementing \nagencies; (ii) prepare business processes and standard operating protocols for HPKVN staff \ncovering different facets of skilling, including mobilization, counseling, training, assessment and \ncertification, skills-gap analysis, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E); (iii) operationalize an MIS \nthat will draw information from all the implementing agencies to monitor progress with respect to \nkey results indicators in the design and monitoring framework; (iv) provide consulting inputs for \nproject management, quality monitoring of civil works, and M&E of all training; and (v) support \ntraining of 50 master trainers in key trades. This support will gradually break silos across \nimplementing agencies, and establish the foundation for a unified skills development mission in \nHimachal Pradesh. \n \nD.

GOHP, acting through DOP, will be the executing agency. HPKVN, DOHE, DOTE, and \nthe Public Works Department (PWD) will be the four implementing agencies. HPKVN will act as \nthe  project  management  unit.  DOHE,  DOTE,  and  PWD  have  already  established  project \nimplementation units. The funds will be routed by the executing agency through HPKVN to DOHE, \nDOTE, and PWD for all activities. HPKVN will procure all services of training service providers for \nvocational training, PWD will be responsible for procurement of civil works and furniture, and \nDOTE  will  procure  the  upgraded  training  equipment  for  the  selected  ITIs.  To  facilitate \ncoordination,  all  the  consulting  firms  will  report  to  HPKVN.  As  support  departments,  the \nDepartment of Rural Development and Department of Urban Development will oversee the \nlivelihood  development  programs  for  rural  and  urban  youth  in  the  RLCs  and  CLCs,  the \nDepartment of Labour and Employment will support counseling and vocational guidance in the \nupgraded MCCs, the Department of Economics and Statistics will coordinate with the M&E firm \nfor the tracer studies and surveys, and the Department of Social Justice and Empowerment will \nassist in undertaking training for people with disabilities. The support departments will coordinate \nclosely with HPKVN and other implementing agencies as required.  \n \n19.  All consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Procurement of civil works, goods and \nequipment will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as \namended from time to time). The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and \ndescribed in detail in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \n \n \n                                                \n22  This is based on the above loan terms and the government\u2019s choice of repayment options and dates. \n   ", "7 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  December 2017\u2013December 2022 \nEstimated completion date   31 December 2022 \nEstimated loan closing  30 June 2023 \ndate \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body Project steering committee chaired by the chief secretary of the \n \nGovernment of Himachal Pradesh, and comprising the ACS of the \nDepartment of Planning and Finance; the ACS, principal secretaries, and \nsecretaries of DOHE, DOLE, DOTE, DOUD, DORD, and PWD; advisor, \nDOP; engineer-in-chief, PWD; and managing director of HPKVN \n(ii)  Executing agency  DOP \n(iii) Key implementing  DOHE, DOTE, HPKVN, PWD \nagencies \n(iv) Implementation unit  HPKVN, Shimla, Himachal Pradesh staff (30 staff)  \nProcurement  National competitive  9 contract packages (works);   $24.13 million \nbidding  15 contract packages (goods)   $11.74 million \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost- 800 person-months; 3  $6.58 million \nbased selection  contracts \n(80:20) \nNonconsulting services   Fixed budget selection  17 packages; training service  $25.94 million \nproviders  \nRetroactive financing  ADB may, subject to its policies and procedures, allow upon request \nand/or advance  advance contracting and retroactive financing of civil works, equipment \ncontracting  and materials, and consulting services.

DUE DILIGENCE \n20.  The project has undertaken detailed due diligence and field surveys to improve the design. \nIt has also taken significant advance action to improve implementation readiness. \n \nA.  Technical \n21.  GOHP\u2019s strong ownership for the project is borne out by the fact that HPKVN\u2019s board of \ndirectors is headed by the chief minister of Himachal Pradesh, and comprises relevant ministers \nand senior civil servants. HPKVN already has 27 full-time staff who have been coordinating well \nwith the other implementing agencies. Around 49% of the project\u2019s civil works and goods, 100% \nof the consulting packages, and 28% of the packages for training service providers will be \ntendered out by mid-October 2017 as part of advance contracting. Further, since November 2016, \nHPKVN has been piloting an NSQF-aligned training program for 1,000 trainees with the help of \nADB consultants. The experience gained through this pilot program and the advance contracting \nactions will help expedite project implementation. \n ", "8 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  Economic viability. The economic viability of the project was assessed on the basis of \nthe benefits and costs associated with the investment project.23 Quantified economic benefits \ninclude direct benefits for trainees due to increased employability and higher wages. The major \nstreams of economic costs are direct project costs associated with the four outputs, the private \ncosts of trainees for nominal fees where relevant, and the indirect opportunity cost of their forgone \nearnings during training. The project is estimated to yield a net present value of $47.82 million \nunder the base-case scenario, with an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) at 17.37%. The \nEIRR was tested for sensitivity to various adverse scenarios: (i) capital cost overrun by 20% (EIRR \n13.67%), (ii) recurrent cost overrun by 20% (EIRR 15.09%), (iii) starting wages lower by 20% \n(EIRR 13.15%), and (iv) capital cost overrun by 20% and post-training wages lower by 20% \n(10.11%). In all cases, the EIRR exceeds the required rate of 9%, suggesting that the investment \nprogram is economically robust. \n \n23.  Sustainability of reforms. TVET will continue to be of high priority for GOHP. The outlay \nfor the project represents around 47% of the state\u2019s TVET spending and only 0.3% of total GOHP \nexpenditure over the project period. The GOHP\u2019s counterpart commitment for the project as a \nshare of the total education budget (or TVET budget) is projected to increase slightly from 0.32% \n(6%) in FY2018 to 0.46% (9%) by FY2022, which is reasonable. Himachal Pradesh is expected \nto  receive  an  additional  amount  of  around  $4 billion  during  2016\u20132020  as  a  result  of  the \nFourteenth Finance Commission award. GOHP thus, has ample fiscal space to fund the project. \nSuccessful project implementation will reduce the high dependence on government jobs among \nthe youth of the state and, eventually, the pressure on the wage bill. Strengthening of the state\u2019s \nTVET  institutional  framework,  convergence  across  programs  run  by  different  departments, \nreduction of duplication, and better quality of training will yield additional fiscal savings over time. \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  A detailed financial management assessment was conducted for DOP, HPKVN, DOTE, \nDOHE, and PWD. The overall project risk is moderate primarily because HPKVN is a relatively \nnew  organization,  which  is  still  in  the  process  of  setting  up  comprehensive  systems  and \nprocesses.24 Several measures have already been taken since its establishment in September \n2015, including the preparation of standard operating protocols for core functions; the recruitment \nof  experienced staff to handle training, procurement, finance, and accounts functions; the \nappointment of internal and external auditors; the approval of its first set of audited financial \nstatements; and the establishment of an audit committee. However, some additional measures \nproposed in the financial management action plan will be required to manage potential risks as \nthe training programs and related project activities are scaled up. These include (i) preparation of \na comprehensive financial and accounting manual; (ii) capacity building of implementing agency \nstaff  in  project  accounting,  reporting,  and  ADB\u2019s  financial  management  and  disbursement \nprocedures; and (iii) refinement of the MIS. The detailed financial management action plan is \ngiven  in the  PAM,  based  on  which  the  expected financial  management  arrangements  are \nexpected to be satisfactory. \n \n                                                \n23  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24  Financial  Management  Assessment,  and  Governance  and  Institutional  Structure:  Himachal  Pradesh  Skills \nDevelopment Project (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n   ", "9 \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  of  India  and  the  state\u2019s  DOP.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n26.  The project is pro-poor and gender-focused. The target trainees are the needy urban and \nrural  youth  of  Himachal  Pradesh,  and  those  enrolled  in  government  colleges,  ITIs,  and \npolytechnics. Training will focus on trades for which demand is growing, such as pharmaceuticals, \nfood processing, and light manufacturing in the secondary sector, and on retail, tourism and \nhospitality, banking and financial services, and health care in the tertiary sector. Support will be \nprovided to boost the livelihoods of the urban and rural poor through a package of training and \nbusiness development support at the CLCs and RLCs. By locating the new polytechnic in Rehan, \nKangra, the project will improve access for girls who reside in the hilly northern districts of \nHimachal Pradesh. Provision of hostel facilities in the CLCs will enable girls of small towns and \nrural areas to access good-quality training. Production centers in some of the RLCs will support \nlocal small businesses. Gender-sensitive counseling and outreach material will be prepared. \nThese measures will ensure that the women workforce participation rate does not decline with \nthe urbanization of Himachal Pradesh\u2019s economy.25 All relevant output and outcome indicators \nhave separate targets for women and for people with disabilities. Given these significant gender \ntargets and features, the project is categorized as gender equity theme (GEN). \n \nE.  Safeguards \n27.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows:26  \n \n28.  Environment (category B). GOHP has assured ADB that the proposed new training \nfacilities will be built within premises owned by it. The potential environmental impacts identified \nare generally site-specific, reversible, and will mostly occur during construction when mitigation \nmeasures can be readily implemented. \n \n29.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). No new land will be acquired, nor will anyone be \ndisplaced  in  anticipation  of  ADB  funding.  It  will  be  ensured  that  the  subproject  sites  are \nencumbrance free and have no squatters or livelihood issues. \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Lahaul Spiti and Kinnaur are two districts in the \nnorthern part of Himachal Pradesh where tribal members are the majority. Given their high \naltitude, inhospitable terrain, harsh winters, sparse population, and poor connectivity, no civil \nworks are planned in these districts. Hence, the project will have no adverse effect on tribals. \n \n31.  Sixteen sites identified by the GOHP were screened and cleared by environmental and \nsocial safeguard consultants. An environmental and social management framework has been \nprepared to guide the civil works. Initial environmental examination reports and corresponding \nenvironmental management plans have already been prepared for several subproject sites. The \nimplementing  agencies\u2019  staff  were  sensitized  about  the  policies  and  procedures  of  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. They will participate in the periodic capacity-building workshops \norganized by ADB\u2019s India Resident Mission on environmental and social safeguards. \n                                                \n25  In 2011\u22122012, Himachal Pradesh\u2019s labor force participation rate was 63% for rural women but only 28% for urban \nwomen. It was 87% for rural men and 73% for urban men. \n26   ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "10 \nF.
