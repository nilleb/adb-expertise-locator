A  summary  of  the  environmental  impact  assessment  was \nAssessment circulated to the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nalong  with  the  environmental  management  plan  on  17  May  2007,  and \nuploaded to the ADB website on 18 May 2007.  \nProject The Project is a key urban infrastructure initiative of the Jilin provincial \nDescription government (JPG). It is classified as a targeted intervention because it \ncontributes to achieving Millennium Development Goal 7, Target 10, which \ncalls for the halving of the proportion of people without access to safe \ndrinking water and improved sanitation by 2015. The Project will help to (i) \nreduce  water  pollution,  (ii)  protect  water  resources,  (iii)  address  water \nshortage (through recycling effluent) and meet the demand for high quality \ntreated water through 2012, (iv) control nonpoint source of pollution through \neffective solid-waste management (SWM), (v) reduce air pollution through \nreduction  in  coal  consumption  and  more  efficient  central  heating,  (vi) \npromote  sustainable  economic  development,  and  (vii)  improve  the \nenvironment and living conditions in Changchun and Yanji cities in Jilin \nprovince. The Project has three components, seven subcomponents, and \n35 activities. The components are (i) an improved and expanded water \nsupply, wastewater services, and SWM in Changchun; (ii) an improved and \nexpanded water supply and wastewater facilities in Yanji; and (iii) improved \nair quality in Yanji through a more efficient central heating system. The \nProject  will  also  involve  capacity  development  and  training  on  project \nmanagement, institutional and wastewater management, and tariff analysis \nfor all the project implementing agencies (IAs). The Project supports the \nGovernment\u2019s 11th Five Year Program which includes goals of improving \nliving conditions and health in cities and promoting sustainable economic \ndevelopment.  \nRationale The project cities of Changchun (with an urban population of 3.2 million) \nand Yanji (420,400) are located along the Songhua River Basin (SRB). The \nSRB is the third largest river basin in the PRC, and it covers sections of Jilin \nand Heilongjiang provinces and the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia. \nThe  Songhua  River  is  severely  polluted  with  organic  chemicals,  heavy \nmetals,  and  conventional  pollutants,  and  this  constrains  sustainable \neconomic development in the region. The Yitong and Yongchun rivers in \nChangchun flow into the SRB and are highly polluted due to inadequate \nwastewater treatment in Changchun. The Yanji section of the Buerhatong \nRiver is also heavily polluted as it goes from east to west and empties into \nthe Tumen River. Given that the present landfill site in Changchun will be ", "ii\nfully utilized within 2 years, there is urgent need for construction of a new \ndomestic solid-waste treatment facility to effectively control nonpoint source \nof pollution in the SRB. Jilin province, therefore, has a critical role to play in \nintegrated water and wastewater management and SWM in the SRB. The \nProject will contribute significantly towards control of water pollution in the \nYitong and Yongchun rivers, the upstream section of the SRB, and the \nBuerhatong River. The Project will also help to solve the current water \nshortage problems in the project cities and meet the future demand for high \nquality treated water. \nIn 2002, during the processing of the Harbin Water Supply Project ($100 \nmillion),  extensive  dialogue  was  conducted  with  the  Government  on \naddressing pollution control in the SRB. Consequently, ADB provided a \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  project  for  the  Songhua  River  Basin  Water \nQuality  and  Pollution  Control  Management.  The  TA  project,  which was \nconsidered highly successful, provided strategic policy inputs to the SRB \nWater Pollution Prevention and Control Plan (SRBPCP). The SRBPCP is a \nGovernment-approved action program to set pollution control targets from \n2006 to 2010, requiring that urban environmental pollution and ecological \ndamage  be  controlled  by  2010.  The  ongoing  Jilin  Water  Supply  and \nSewerage  Development  (JWSSD)  project,  with  an  ADB  loan  of  $100 \nmillion,  is  the  first  major  ADB  investment  directly  addressing  pollution \ncontrol in the SRB. It will help Changchun achieve a 70% wastewater \ntreatment rate by 2010. The proposed Project, which is the second project \nand follows the priority list of the SRBPCP, will help Changchun achieve an \n80% wastewater treatment rate by 2012. The Project will also help Yanji \ncity achieve a wastewater treatment rate of 95% by 2012. \nADB will implement a TA for an ensuing project in 2008, the Songhua River \nBasin  Water  Pollution  Control  and  Management  Project,  which  has  an \nindicative  ADB  loan  of  $200  million.  This  would  be  the  third  major \ninvestment in the context of the SRBPCP, and the ADB\u2019s fourth in the SRB. \nThis comprehensive strategic approach to addressing pollution control in \nthe SRB is a good model for replication elsewhere in the PRC. \nYanji will shortly start constructing a new cogeneration (heat and power) \nplant  which  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  2010,  allowing  complete \ncoverage  of  the  city  with  a  central  heating  service.  The  closure  and \nreplacement of the 318 polluting coal-based boilers by the proposed Project \nwould result in a major improvement in the air quality of Yanji, which would \ncontribute significantly to public health in Yanji city. However, to fully realize \nthe benefits of this facility, the heating distribution system needs to be \nupgraded and treated wastewater effluent is required for plant cooling.  \nImpact and  The impact of the Project is to enhance the urban environment and improve \nOutcome public  health  and  quality  of  life  for  urban  residents  in  the  cities  of \nChangchun and Yanji by (i) increasing wastewater coverage, (ii) enhancing \nSWM, (iii) improving the supply of potable water, and (iv) reducing air \npollution.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  improved  water  supply, \nwastewater management, SWM, and efficient central heating in Changchun \nand Yanji. ", "iii\nCost Estimates  The  investment  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $352.68  million \nequivalent, including taxes and duties. \nFinancing Plan  Amount \nSource ($ million equivalent) % of Total \nAsian Development Bank  100.0  28 \nChangchun municipal government  81.7  23 \nYanji municipal government  33.4  10 \nCofinancing: Domestic Commercial  137.6  39 \nBanks\n  Total  352.7  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nADB will provide a loan of $100 million to finance 28% of the project cost \nincluding  financing  charges  during  construction.  The  Government  will \nfinance 72% through a combination of water and wastewater tariffs ($35 \nmillion),  Changchun  municipal  government  (CMG)  and  Yanji  municipal \ngovernment (YMG) budget sources, and domestic loans from PRC banks. \nLoan Amount and  ADB\u2019s loan of $100 million will come from its ordinary capital resources and \nTerms will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility  for  US  dollar  loans.

The scope and extent of consulting services take account of the \nloan  consulting  and  capacity-development  support  provided  under  the \nongoing JWSSD project. The consultants will be recruited in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time).\nProject Benefits  The Project will benefit about 3.6 million urban residents in the cities of \nand Beneficiaries  Changchun and Yanji, whose living conditions and public health standards \nwill be improved by (i) improved quality of water supply and wastewater \nservices, (ii) a reduction in nonpoint source pollution through increased \nSWM capacity, (iii) a reduction in the incidence of waterborne diseases \nsuch as diarrhea and hepatitis A to below 2006 levels (to be monitored \nthrough the PPMS), (iv) a reduction in the risk of respiratory diseases by \nimproving the central heating system and cutting utilization of coal by 40% \nor 298,000 tons per heating season, and (v) water savings of 700,000 cubic \nmeters (m3) per heating season through water reuse and a reduction in \nunaccounted-for water. The Project will result in improved management and \nutilization of water resources in the upper SRB and the Buerhatong River, \nbringing positive downstream and transjurisdictional benefits in the province \nof  Heilongjiang.  The  water  quality  improvements  in  the  SRB  and \nBuerhatong  River  will  also  contribute  to  (i)  integrated  water  resource \nmanagement  and  pollution  control,  (ii)  the  basin-wide  management \nprogram, and (iii) transboundary pollution prevention and control. \nThe  Project  will  secure  the  provision  of  reliable  drinking  water  to \nChangchun  and  Yanji.  The  recycling  of  wastewater  will  reduce  water \npollution and address the water shortage problem. This will also have a \ncatalytic effect on encouraging the replication of similar optimal and cost-\neffective approaches to addressing water pollution and water shortage.  ", "v\nOf the total beneficiary population, about 240,000 persons (or 5.54%) are \nclassified as poor measured by the weighted average local urban poverty \nline  of  CNY1,925  per  year.  Major  social  measures  to  protect  urban \nresidents from falling into poverty include (i) a living allowance for laid-off \nemployees, (ii) unemployment insurance, and (iii) a social support program \nunder the minimum living-standard scheme. Further, CMG and YMG have \nagreed to implement poverty reduction measures, including (i) lifeline tariffs, \n(ii) providing water bill discounts or cash rebates amounting to 50% of \nmonthly water bills for households living below the poverty line, and (iii) \nconnecting the poorest households to tap water in Changchun and Yanji. \nThe Project will create a minimum of 810 permanent jobs for the operation \nof  the  facilities,  and  3,880  jobs  during  the  5-year  construction  period. \nFollow-on multiplier effects are expected to create an additional 5,000 full-\ntime jobs. About half of the construction jobs are unskilled jobs that are \nmost  likely  to  be  filled  by  currently  unemployed  persons.  Public  health \nbenefits  will  accrue  through  (i)  a  reduction  in  waterborne  and  airborne \ndiseases,  (ii)  savings  on  medical  treatment  costs,  and  (iii)  improved \nworkforce productivity.\nThe Project is technically sound, affordable to beneficiaries, and financially \nand economically viable with a financial internal rate of return of 9.0% \n(higher than the real weighted average cost of capital of 3.52%) and a \nbase-case economic internal rate of return of 23.8%, which is well above \nthe economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. \nRisks and The  following  risks  could  affect  timely  implementation  and  economic \nAssumptions viability, and reduce the available benefits of the Project: (i) amendments \nand changes to the Changchun and Yanji master plans; (ii) a lack of proper \noperation and maintenance of project facilities; (iii) ineffective organizational \nstructures  and  inadequate  capacity  of  the  IAs,  which  could  result  in \ninefficient project development and delayed implementation; (iv) delays in \nthe  provision  of  counterpart  funding;  (v)  failure  of  CMG  and  YMG  to \nincrease water, wastewater, solid-waste, and heating tariffs to meet cost \nrecovery  targets;  and  (vi)  unforeseen  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nissues, which could constrain the efficient implementation of the project \nworks and the restoration of livelihoods of the affected persons. The Project \ndoes not have any unusual technical risks.  \nThe  project  components  will  use  standard  technology  that  conforms  to \ninternational standards. Specific construction risks will be mitigated by the \nuse of experienced consultants to prepare designs and monitor project \nimplementation.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Jilin Urban Environmental Improvement Project. \n2.  In line with its long-term goals for the urban sector of improving living conditions, expanding \nthe supply of clean water, and enhancing wastewater treatment coverage, the Government of the \nPRC requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help increase the water supply, wastewater \ntreatment, and solid-waste management (SWM) capacity in Changchun, and water supply and \nwastewater treatment capacity and energy efficient central heating in Yanji in Jilin province in the \nnortheast of the PRC. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy1 and will help the PRC \nachieve Millennium Development Goal 7, target 10 which calls for a halving of the proportion of \npeople without access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation by 2015. This report is based \non  the  findings  of  the  Loan  Appraisal  Mission  and  discussions  with  the  central  and  local \ngovernments,  relevant  agencies,  and  community  organizations.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Since the PRC initiated economic reforms in 1978, rapid urbanization has accompanied \nsignificant economic progress. The urban population has grown from 160 million in 1975 to about \n562 million in 2005, and the urbanization rate increased from 17% to 43%. The rate is expected to \nreach 47% in 2010, 50% in 2015, and 55% (or about 700 million) in 2030. The Government\u2019s \nAgenda for Economic Reform and Social Development in the New Century2 aims to accelerate \nurbanization and the development of towns and cities, particularly in metropolitan areas. The \nincreasing  urban  population,  industrialization,  and  economic  development  are  straining  the \noverloaded infrastructure and contributing to widespread pollution and environmental threats in the \nPRC\u2019s cities. In particular, cities in the north and west experience widespread pollution due to the \ndischarge of untreated wastewater, improper management of solid wastes, and inefficient burning \nof coal for heating. Without significant investment there will be a deterioration in the quality of life \nfor urban residents, degradation of the urban environment, and inefficient economic development.  \n4.  Municipal water supply in the PRC has increased steadily in the past decade. In 2005, total \nwater production was 29.8 billion cubic meters per day (m3/day) and sales were 25.8 billion m3/day,\nwith unaccounted-for water at 15% of total water production. Industrial water sales account for \n35.4% of water sold and domestic sales account for 56.4%, while other sales are 8.2%. The \nnational average water use was 365 liters per person per day; domestic consumption was 220 \nliters per person per day. In most large cities in the PRC more than 90% of all urban households \nhave access to piped water. However, this coverage indicator obscures shortages in many cities of \ngood  quality  raw  water  supply,  water  supply  delivery  capacities,  and  wastewater  treatment \nfacilities. The Government has classified more than 300 cities as water-short, with 108 having \nserious water problems and more than 60 being critically short of water. The situation has been \nexacerbated  by  the  pollution  of  raw  water  sources  by  the  discharge  of  inadequately  treated \nagricultural, municipal, and industrial wastewater. \n5.  The PRC\u2019s urban areas face environmental threats from pollution of rivers, lakes, and \nunderground  aquifers  by  untreated  water.  In  2004,  about  48.2  billion  cubic  meters  (m3)  of \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2001. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n2  The Government\u2019s long-term vision for development was set out during the 16th Party Congress held in November \n2000 and reiterated during the 10th National People\u2019s Congress held in March 2003.  ", "2\nwastewater  were  generated;  about  54%  of  this  was  from  municipal  sources  and  46%  from \nindustrial sources. Currently, about 90% of industrial wastewater is treated before discharge to a \nmunicipal sewer. Municipal wastewater is a major contributor to pollution of the PRC\u2019s rivers and \nlakes. As of 2005, only about 52% of urban wastewater was treated (compared with 34% in 2000); \nthe rest was discharged untreated to rivers and lakes. About 41.8% of the water in the seven major \nriver basins3 does not meet the class III national water quality standard.4 Surface water sources \nserving municipal water supply systems are polluted to levels unacceptable under water quality \nstandards.\n6.  In 2005, the PRC generated 156 million tons of solid waste, representing an increase of \n32.2% from the 2001 volume of 118 million tons. However, the increase in the treatment capacity \nhas not kept pace with the increased solid-waste volume. In addition to direct adverse impacts on \npublic  health,  the  growing  and  uncontrolled  disposal  of  solid  waste  contributes  to  increasing \ncontamination of groundwater supplies through inadequate leachate collection systems.5\n7.  In the PRC\u2019s 11th Five Year Program (FYP) covering 2006\u20132010, the Government has \nprioritized  addressing  environmental  issues,  including  water  and  air  pollution,  through  policy \nreform, increased investment, and improved urban infrastructure management. Recognizing that \nadequate environmental protection and pollution controls are essential for sustainable economic \ngrowth, the Government has made environmental protection a national priority in its development \nstrategy. In addition to enacting environmental protection laws and implementing regulations that \nemphasize  preventive  measures  (the  polluter-pays  principle)  and  decentralized  environmental \nmanagement,  the  Government  has  also  undertaken  numerous  programs  for  wastewater \nmanagement.6 These programs included (i) the requirement of industries to treat wastewater to \nnational wastewater discharge standards by the end of 2000, (ii) 5-year plans for municipalities to \naddress  wastewater  collection,  treatment,  and  disposal,  and  (iii)  the  development  and  partial \nimplementation of pollution control plans for the key river basins. The Government has decreed7\nthat by 2010 the wastewater treatment rate in all the cities in the PRC should not be lower than \n60%, and not lower than 70% for major cities with secondary treatment facilities.8 The treatment \nlevel required is dependent on the water quality class of the receiving water. To achieve water \nquality class I, II, or III, secondary wastewater treatment would normally be required.  \n8.  The Government has accorded priority in the 11th FYP to addressing water supply and \nwastewater treatment issues through policy reform, increased investment, and improved urban \ninfrastructure management. The Government\u2019s strategy focuses on (i) developing water sources; \n(ii) protecting existing sources by controlling industrial and residential pollution; (iii) controlling over-\nextraction of groundwater resources; (iv) introducing water-efficient technologies and operations; \nand (v) using appropriate pricing mechanisms to encourage conservation and generate necessary \nfunds  for  operation,  maintenance,  and  investment.  The  Government\u2019s  ongoing  economic  and \nenterprise reform programs require that all water supply and wastewater projects be financially \nsustainable and capable of cost recovery.  \n                                                \n3  Changjiang (Yangtze River), Haihe, Huaihe, Huanghe Liaohe, Songhuajiang, and Zhujiang.  \n4  The PRC water quality standards have five classes of quality covering about 40 pollution parameters. Class I is \npristine, while class V is suitable only for industrial use. Class III is the minimum water quality required for municipal \nwater supply. \n5  Leachate is liquid percolated from solid-waste landfills or dumps; it can contain undesirable or toxic chemicals.    \n6  The Law of the PRC on Prevention and Control of Water Pollution was first adopted in 1984 and amended in 1996. \nThe law was enacted for the purpose of (i) preventing and controlling water pollution, (ii) protecting and improving the \nenvironment, (iii) safeguarding human health, and (iv) ensuring effective utilization of water resources. The law also \nestablishes the standards for water environment quality and for discharge of water pollutants, and also defines the \nplanning, supervision, and management of the prevention and control of water pollution. \n7   Ministry of Construction. 2000.

In the PRC, central heating in terms of square meters (m2) recorded an annual growth rate \nof 16% between 1992 and 2004. Nationwide residential buildings account for about 70% of the \ntotal heating space, with commercial and public buildings accounting for the remaining 30%. \nHeating demand in Jilin province has also grown rapidly during the past decade. In the PRC, over \n60 million tons of coal are burned by 500,000 small, inefficient, coal-fired heating boilers every \nyear, resulting in the emission of substantial amounts of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen \noxide, and total suspended particulates. The majority of urban heating supply comes from these \nsmall boilers, creating severe air pollution problems in urban areas. An urban sector analysis is \nprovided in Appendix 2. \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n10.  Key problems and opportunities include (i) a shortage of good quality drinking water, (ii) \ninadequate wastewater treatment capacity, (iii) inadequate SWM facilities and services, (iv) land \nsubsidence arising from the overuse of groundwater, (v) making water supply and wastewater \ntreatment self-financing through tariff reforms, and (vi) severe air pollution in urban areas through \nuse of small, inefficient, coal-fired boilers for heating.  \n11.  The  Project  cities  are  Changchun  (with  an  urban  population  of  3.2  million)  and  Yanji \n(420,400).  Changchun,  the  capital  of  Jilin  province,  is  an  industrial,  communication,  and \ntransportation  center  in  the  northeast  of  the  PRC.  Major  industries  include  automobile  and \nautomobile  parts  manufacturing,  agricultural  products  and  by-products  refining,  and  high-tech \nmanufacturing. Yanji is the capital of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture bordering Russia \nand the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It is the economic center of east Jilin province and \nis  one  of  the  most  developed  cities  in  the  province.  Key  industrial  sectors  include  food, \npharmaceuticals, textiles, farm machinery, and bus manufacture.  \n12. Songhua River Basin (SRB). The SRB is the third largest river basin in the PRC after the \nYangtze and Yellow rivers. It has an area of 557,000 square kilometers (km2) and a population of \n62 million. Major cities such as Changchun and Harbin, as well as the PRC\u2019s largest oil fields, are \nlocated  in  the  basin.  Agriculture  is  well  developed  and  there  is  a  large  industrial  base.  The \nSonghua  River  catchment  area  covers  portions  of  three  provinces\u2014Jilin  and  Heilongjiang \nprovinces and the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia. Changchun is located in the upstream \npart of the Songhua River which flows through Harbin. After Harbin, the river joins the Heilongjiang \nRiver, enters Russia, and eventually discharges into the sea.  \n13.  Like other river basins in the PRC, the SRB is seriously polluted and is now acknowledged \nby the State Environmental Protection Administration as being one of the four most polluted river \nbasins in the PRC. Pollution is recognized as impairing both natural resources and economic \ndevelopment within the region. Water pollution issues within the SRB, especially in relation to the \nprotection of drinking water resources for the municipality of Harbin, have received increased \nnational and international attention due to the recent widely publicized pollution incident in the \nSRB. The pollution is mainly due to the discharge of untreated or partially treated wastewater in \nJilin and Heilongjiang provinces. The Songhua River, which is contaminated with a number of \nknown and suspected trace organic chemicals, metals, and conventional pollutants, is classified by \nthe Government as class IV (falling below class V during the 6\u2013month, low-flow winter season), \nand is considered unsuitable for municipal domestic use. The river water consistently fails to meet \nPRC class III standards\u2014the minimum quality required for the water to be used as the source for \nwater supply. In March 2003, ADB approved the Harbin Water Supply Project9 to address the \nneeds of Harbin city, with a population of 3 million, for clean and reliable drinking water from an \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2003.

Several districts are already receiving the new \nhigh quality project water.", "4\nalternative water source (the Lalin River), since the existing source from the Songhua River was \nhighly  polluted.  Because  of  the  deteriorating  water  quality  in  the  Songhua  River,  the  Harbin \nmunicipal government expedited construction of the Project, which was completed 1 year ahead of \nschedule.\n14. Project Rationale. The major rivers in Changchun (the Yitong and Yongchun) flow into the \nSRB. In Yanji, the Buerhatong River crosses the urban area from west to east and eventually \nempties  into  the  Tumen  River.  Underdevelopment  of  wastewater  collection  and  wastewater \ntreatment in Changchun and Yanji leads to the discharge of untreated wastewater into local rivers, \nand eventually to the pollution of the Songhua and Tumen rivers. Water quality in the Yitong and \nYongchun rivers in Changchun does not meet class V of the PRC Surface Water Quality Standard. \nDue to the discharge of untreated wastewater into the Buerhatong River, water quality in the Yanji \nsection of the river has deteriorated from class III to class IV. The lack of adequate wastewater \nmanagement degrades local rivers, poses a threat to public health, and adversely affects the \nquality of life in Changchun and Yanji. There is an urgent need to expand the sewer network and \nwastewater treatment capacity in Changchun and Yanji to improve water quality in the Yitong and \nBuerhatong rivers. The Yanji municipal government (YMG) has just completed the construction of a \n100,000 m3/day wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), which will help to achieve 95% treatment of \nmunicipal wastewater discharge in Yanji. In order for this capacity to be fully utilized, improvements \nin the sewer network are urgently required. \n15.  Changchun and Yanji rely primarily on surface water for their water supply. Their per capita \nproduction levels are well within the normal range for the PRC.10 Under normal conditions, water \ndemand is expected to exhaust developed capacity in both Changchun and Yanji by 2010. Both \ncities experienced water supply problems during a severe episode of drought in 2004, leading to \ndangerously low water levels in reservoirs and a resulting loss of effective treatment plant capacity. \nChangchun and Yanji experienced low water pressure and supply interruptions.  \n16.  Changchun has a domestic SWM system featuring domestic waste11 pick-up, extensive \ninformal recovery of recyclable material, and disposal in a managed landfill. Given that the present \nlandfill site will be fully utilized within 2 years, timely construction of a new domestic solid-waste \ntreatment facility is urgently needed.  \n17.  Jilin province has a critical role to play in integrated water and wastewater management, \nand  SWM  in  the  SRB.  In  2002,  during  the  processing  of  the  Harbin  Water  Supply  Project, \nextensive dialogue was conducted with the Government on addressing pollution control in the \nSRB. Consequently, ADB provided a technical assistance (TA) project for the Songhua River Basin \nWater Quality and Pollution Control Management.12 The TA project, which was considered highly \nsuccessful, (i) strengthened the capacity of the Songhua Water Resources Protection Bureau, (ii) \nassisted the Government in developing a long-term water pollution control plan for the SRB beyond \n2010, and (iii) provided strategic policy inputs to the 11th FYP and the SRB Water Pollution \nPrevention  and  Control  Plan  (SRBPCP).13  The  SRBPCP  is  a  Government-approved  action \nprogram to set pollution control targets from 2006 to 2010, requiring that urban environmental \npollution and ecological damage be controlled by 2010. The ongoing Jilin Water Supply and \nSewerage Development Project (JWSSD),14 with an ADB loan of $100 million, is the first major \nADB investment directly addressing pollution control in the SRB. It will help Changchun achieve a \n                                                \n10 211 liters per person per day for Yanji and 327 liters per person per day for Changchun. \n11 Domestic waste in the PRC includes residential and institutional waste. \n12ADB. 2002.

The Project will also help Yanji achieve a \nwastewater treatment rate of 95% by 2012. \n18.  ADB will implement a project preparatory TA16 for an ensuing project in 2008, for the \nSonghua River Basin Water Pollution Control and Management Project with an indicative ADB loan \nof $200 million. This would be the third major investment in the context of the SRBPCP, and ADB\u2019s \nfourth in the SRB. This comprehensive strategic approach to addressing pollution control in the \nSRB will serve as a good model for replication elsewhere in the PRC. At the Stockholm World \nWater Forum (12\u201318 August 2007), ADB and the Global Water Partnership convened a session to \nreview and share experience on integrated water resource management (IWRM) in river basins, \nspecifically focusing on ADB IWRM projects in the PRC and in Central Asia, including among \nothers, the SRB.17\n19.  The existing central heating plant in Yanji is supplying heat to the city\u2019s downtown area. It \nonly covers an area of 2 million m2 (or 15% of the city) due to its limited capacity and incomplete \nheating distribution network coverage. It is inefficient because (i) the retrofitted distribution system \nthat it uses does not allow efficient hot water delivery, and (ii) the plant is an older single purpose \ndesign that fails to achieve the efficiencies possible with newer cogeneration (heat and power) \nplants. The remaining area is heated by approximately 318 small inefficient boilers, resulting in \ntotal suspended particulates in the urban area averaging 0.38 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3), \nmore than  twice the state environmental standard of 0.15 mg/m3.  Yanji will construct a new \ncogeneration plant18 which is expected to be completed by 2010, allowing complete coverage of \nthe city with a central heating service. In this regard, new heating distribution networks that connect \nthe existing central heating plant and the new cogeneration plant with the rest of the city need to be \ncompleted to effectively utilize the city\u2019s central heating supply capacity. The proposed Project19\nwill (i) complete the urgently needed central heating distribution networks for Yanji, (ii) lead to the \nclosure  and  replacement  of  the  318  polluting  coal-based  boilers,20  and  (iii)  result  in  a  major \nimprovement in the air quality of Yanji, which will contribute significantly to public health in Yanji. \n20. Policy Dialogue. The Project builds on ADB policy dialogue with the Government in \nseveral key areas including (i) cost recovery and tariff reform, (ii) wastewater management, (iii) \nupstream and basin-wide pollution prevention and control, (iv) water conservation, (v) corporate \ngovernance and enterprise reform, and (vi) private sector participation.  \n21.  ADB has supported the water tariff reform process through two water tariff TA projects21\nwith the Ministry of Construction under which the market-oriented National Guidelines on Water \nTariffs  were  developed,  promulgated,  and  implemented.  The  water  tariff  TA  projects  (i) \n                                                \n15 State government policies require that urban environmental pollution and ecological damage be controlled by 2010. \nMajor cities, including provincial capitals, should attain a wastewater treatment rate of 70% by 2010. \n16 ADB. 2007.

In 2003, the NDRC confirmed that the 1995 approval was still valid. The Feasibility Study Report has \nbeen submitted to the NDRC for approval which is expected by December 2007. Construction works will start in 2008 \nand be completed by 2010. This cogeneration plant is outside the scope of the proposed Project and is being financed \ndomestically. The detailed engineering design work is underway. \n19 The central heating component accounts for 13% of the total investment cost of the Project. \n20 Originally there were 700 coal-based boilers. YMG has so far closed 382 boilers and the remaining 318 boilers will be \nclosed during implementation of the proposed Project.  \n21 ADB. 1997.

The guidelines are being implemented nationwide. Further, \nan ADB wastewater tariff TA22 developed and recommended national guidelines for wastewater \ntariffs,  including  tariff  calculation  methodologies  that  allow  for  full  cost  recovery,  taking  into \nconsideration affordability and social constraints. By 2008 the Changchun municipal government \n(CMG) plans to increase water tariffs from CNY2.1/m3 to CNY2.7/m3 and wastewater tariffs from \nCNY0.4/m3 to CNY0.8/m3. CMG has scheduled public hearing meetings in 2007 to discuss the \nproposed water and wastewater tariff increases. YMG has already held a public hearing meeting to \ndiscuss increasing the water tariffs from CNY1.6/m3 to CNY3.4/m3, and wastewater tariffs from \nCNY0.4/m3 to CNY0.8/m3 by 2008. After the second public hearing meeting scheduled for October \n2007, the new water and wastewater tariffs in Yanji will become effective in 2008. This indicates \nChangchun\u2019s and Yanji\u2019s progressiveness in adopting tariff reforms.23 The policy dialogue is in \nSupplementary Appendix A.\n22.  The water and wastewater tariff increases under the Project are important steps towards \nachieving  full  cost  recovery,  which  is  needed  to  attract  private  sector  participation  (PSP)  in \nChangchun and Yanji. An assurance is included requiring CMG and YMG to ensure that water and \nwastewater tariffs are set at levels that ensures full cost recovery of operation and maintenance \n(O&M), depreciation, and financial costs including debt service obligations and a reasonable profit \nmargin for water and wastewater treatment. This would ensure full cost recovery at the start of \nproject operations, and financial sustainability of the Project. ADB has also provided technical \nassistance support to the Government on the use of market-based instruments to enhance private \nsector partnerships in public utilities, mainly for water supply, wastewater, and SWM.24 This TA \nprovided an analysis of the issues in the context of international best practices and how these \ncould be adopted in the PRC. During project processing, the main features of the ADB-supported \nChengdu build-operate-transfer project were discussed with CMG, YMG, and the implementing \nagencies (IAs); and those involved indicated interest in this modality of private sector involvement \nfor future investments. Completed in February 2002, the build-operate-transfer plant is delivering \nits contracted capacity to Chengdu municipality, providing an additional source of clean water to its \nresidents. The Nanjing experience of public\u2013private partnership, with public investments supporting \nan enabling environment for a utility bond issue, was also discussed and disseminated. The Jilin \nprovincial government (JPG) has expressed its interest in exploring a similar approach for Jilin \nprovince and requested more detailed information. Further, the PRC Resident Mission and Private \nSector  Operations  Department  conducted  a  seminar  in  Beijing  on  25  July  2007  on  ADB\u2019s \nnonsovereign lending modality for the provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin. The proposed Project will \ncreate the environment necessary for eventual PSP by pursuing tariff reform, full cost recovery, \nenterprise reform, and improved governance; all are prerequisites for private sector involvement. \nOther forms of PSP, including leasing contracts and joint ventures, were also reviewed. As a result \nof tariff reforms and increases, the IAs would become financially sustainable, and be able to \ngenerate  funds  for  future  water  and  wastewater  expansion  projects.  Consequently,  the  tariff \nreforms and capacity building under the Project would contribute to improved governance. \n23. External Assistance. External assistance to JPG has principally been provided by ADB \nand the World Bank. Since 1992, ADB has provided 22 loans totaling $2.5 billion to the PRC for \nurban development and environment projects (Appendix 3). ADB also has provided about $46.3 \nmillion for about 70 TA studies to prepare these projects, and to review and study key issues in \nwater resources, urban water supply, wastewater treatment, pollution control, and heating.  \n                                                \n22 ADB. 2001.

ADB\u2019s water supply loan projects in the PRC have generally been well \nimplemented.25 The lessons identified from post-evaluation of water supply and sanitation projects \nhighlight the importance of integrating both supply and demand concerns into the project design. \nEncouraging broad reforms, such as commercial management, and introducing competition will \npromote efficient and responsive delivery of water supply and wastewater services. Appropriate \npricing policies for water and sanitation services are also required. Lessons from the ongoing \nJWSSD project was also considered. Other lessons include the need to (i) review technical designs \nthoroughly; (ii) consider local conditions and constraints; (iii) support financial reform, particularly in \nestablishing autonomous wastewater entities and tariff increases, to ensure sustainability; (iv) \nstrengthen institutions, particularly by giving them managerial autonomy; (v) educate the public in \nenvironmental  improvement;  (vi)  consult  the  public  and  involve  the  community;  (vii)  address \nresettlement  issues  early;  and  (viii)  support  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  water  supply  and \nwastewater treatment.\n25.  A recently completed performance portfolio review of the water supply, sanitation, and \nwaste  management  sector26  identified  successes  and  deficiencies,  and  lessons  from  portfolio \nperformance.  These  along  with  the  recently  completed  PRC  Country  Assistance  Program \nEvaluation were considered.27 Among the major issues identified were (i) delays in the start-up of \nprojects and in procurement, (ii) weak institutional arrangements for project implementation and \nsustainable operations, and (iii) a low proportion of civil works financing resulting in loan savings \nand cancellation of surplus loan amounts. To ensure that there is no duplication of effort, during \nproject processing, lessons learned were taken into consideration by (i) thoroughly evaluating the \ntechnical designs and technologies, (ii) ensuring an adequate debt-equity ratio for the project IAs, \n(iii) undertaking rigorous sensitivity analysis of cash flows and financial and economic analysis, and \n(iv) incorporating institutional strengthening measures to improve the level of corporate governance \ntaking into account the capacity-development components included in the JWSSD project. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n26.  The impact of the Project is to enhance the urban environment and improve public health \nand quality of life for urban residents in the cities of Changchun and Yanji by (i) increasing \nwastewater coverage, (ii) enhancing SWM, (iii) improving the supply of potable water, and (iv) \nreducing air pollution. The outcome of the Project will be improved water supply, wastewater \nmanagement, SWM, and efficient central heating services in Changchun and Yanji.   \nB.  Outputs \n27.  The Project has three components and related capacity development, broken down into \nseven  subcomponents  (outputs)  and  35  activities  as  indicated  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework. These will contribute to, and support, Changchun\u2019s and Yanji\u2019s 11th FYP and the \nSRBPCP. The components include (i) improved and expanded water supply, wastewater services, \nand SWM in Changchun; (ii) improved and expanded water supply and wastewater facilities in \nYanji; and (iii) improved air quality in Yanji through a more efficient central heating system.

The  proposed  Project  is  not  a  stand-alone \ninvestment,  but  is  an  integral  part  of  the  basin-wide  Songhua  water  resources  management \ninitiative,  the  SRBPCP,  and  the  Changchun  city  master  plan.  The  proposed  Project  will \ncomplement  the  ongoing  JWSSD  project  and  provide  the  critical  10%  capacity  required  for \nChangchun city to achieve its treatment target of 80% of the wastewater generated by 2012. In \nYanji, the Project is an integral part of the Yanji city master plan targeting a 95% wastewater \ntreatment rate by 2011 and related pollution control in the Buerhatong River. The water quality \nimprovements in the SRB and Buerhatong River will also contribute to (i) integrated water resource \nmanagement  and  pollution  control,  (ii)  the  basin-wide  management  program,  and  (iii) \n                                                \n28 Two additional pumping stations will be upgraded.

The Project also includes (i) training in the O&M of \nwater  supply  and  wastewater  facilities  to  ensure  effective  operation,  (ii)  monitoring  of  future \nperformance of O&M of the water and wastewater facilities using a number of indicators outlined in \nthe design and monitoring framework, and (iii) demonstration of the potential economic benefits of \nan integrated and strategic long-term approach to planning of water supply wastewater and SWM \nfacilities.  The  proposed  Project  reflects  a  continuation  of  ADB\u2019s  effort  for  the  environmental \nimprovement of the SRB following the JWSSD project. Lessons learned from the JWSSD project \nregarding the integration of wastewater treatment, water reuse, and water resource protection are \ncontinued and improved under the proposed Project. Further, the proposed Project focuses on \nstrengthening the environmental management institution and mechanism for seeking continuously \nimproved environmental performance, and initiating a policy dialogue on integrated, water resource \nand river basin management.\n34. Tariff Reform. CMG and YMG have committed to generate funds to finance the water and \nwastewater subcomponents of the Project from water and wastewater tariff increases estimated at \n$35 million. This is a major reform in line with ADB\u2019s water policy (see footnote 1). The planned \nwater and wastewater tariff increases (see para. 20) will contribute to (i) water conservation and \nrecycling of industrial water, (ii) financial sustainability of the Project, and (iii) PSP in the water and \nwastewater sectors in Changchun and Yanji.  \n35. Optimum Design. Through rigorous least-cost analysis and engineering consulting, the \ntechnical design of the Project was optimized. Consequently, the resettlement impact of the Project \nwas reduced by 16%, resulting in a reduction of the resettlement cost. The design optimization \nanalysis is in Supplementary Appendix C. \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n36.  The project investment is estimated at $352.68 million equivalent, including taxes and \nduties.

In all cases in Changchun and Yanji, the IAs will bear the risks of foreign exchange and \ninterest  rate  variation  for  their  portion  of  the  loan  proceeds,  and  undertake  to  perform  the \nobligations as provided in the Project Agreement applicable to the IAs. The flow of funds and \nonlending arrangements are shown in Appendix 5. \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n40.  The executing agency will be JPG. A project leading group (PLG) was established, headed \nby  the  vice-governor  of  JPG  and  comprising  the  heads  of  the  Jilin  Development  Reform \nCommission, the Jilin Construction Bureau, and the Jilin Finance Bureau, and the mayors of CMG \nand YMG. The PLG will provide overall policy guidance, facilitate interagency coordination, and \nresolve any institutional problems affecting project implementation. A project management office \n(PMO) was established at the JPG level led by the Jilin Construction Bureau. The PMO will also be \nthe secretariat of the PLG. Project implementing units (PIUs) were established in CMG and YMG, \nand they will report to the PMO and also coordinate and monitor activities of the project IAs. The \nPMO already has experience in implementing ADB projects since it is also the PMO for the \nongoing JWSSD project. The IAs are limited liability companies incorporated under PRC company \nlaw.30 A board of directors will oversee financial and operational matters of each IA including (i) the \nhiring  and  firing  of  senior  management,  (ii)  reviewing  staffing  and  remuneration  plans,  (iii) \nreviewing the progress of construction and approving annual construction plans, (iv) reviewing and \napproving annual financial budgets, (v) reviewing the investment plans and accounts of the IAs, \nand (vi) approving the procurement of major equipment and civil works contracts. The IAs will \nincrease their staff strength significantly for the construction period and when operations begin.  \n41.  The six IAs are (i) Changchun Water Supply Company for the Changchun water supply \nsubcomponent, (ii) Yanji Water Supply Company for the Yanji water supply subcomponent, (iii) \nChangchun  Jingyuetan  Tourism  Construction  Group  Limited  Company  for  the  Changchun \nwastewater management subcomponent, (iv) Yanji Sewage Treatment Company for the Yanji \nwastewater management component, (v) Changchun Municipal Liya Environmental Sanitation and \nInfrastructure Construction Limited Company for the Changchun SWM subcomponent, and (vi) \nYanji Investment and Development Company for the central heating subcomponent. The internal \ncontrols and accounting and auditing procedures of the IAs were reviewed through a financial \nmanagement assessment and these are generally in order and will be fully functional and available \nfor use under the Project for the construction and operational phase of the Project. An assessment \nwas undertaken of the IAs technical and institutional capacities, and these are adequate for project \nimplementation.  The  IAs  will  retain  the  services  of  design  institutes,  specialist  procurement \nagencies and construction supervision companies to assist in the implementation activities. The \nPMO  and  IAs  will  have  a  number  of  staff  trained  in  project  management  and  relevant  ADB \nprocedures during implementation of the Project. The financial management assessment is in \nSupplementary Appendix E. \n2.  Implementation Period \n42.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 5 years from the end of 2007 to 2012 \n(Appendix 6). The implementation period is estimated based on the project scope and construction \ntechnology requirements. The schedule is considered realistic and achievable because the project \nimplementation structure is already in place and preparatory works are underway. \n                                                \n30 PRC Company Law. 1993. ", "12\n3.  Procurement \n43. All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Contracts for goods estimated to \nexceed $1.0 million and contracts for works estimated to exceed $10.0 million will be procured \nusing international competitive bidding procedures. Contracts for goods and contracts for works \nestimated to be equal to or less than the above international competitive bidding values but more \nthan  $100,000  shall  be  procured  on  the  basis  of  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  in \naccordance with the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law (1999), subject to modifications agreed with \nADB. Contracts for goods and works estimated to cost $100,000 or less will be procured using \nshopping procedures. More details are provided in Appendix 7. \n4.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n44.      ADB  approved  the  Government\u2019s  request  for  advance  contracting,  which  includes \nrecruitment  of  consultants  and  procurement  of  goods  and  civil  works,  and  the  request  for \nretroactive financing of eligible expenditures up to $20 million (equivalent to 20% of the ADB loan) \nincurred before loan effectiveness, but not earlier than 12 months before the signing of the Loan \nAgreement.31 Advance contracting will include (i) tendering and bid evaluation for civil works \ncontract packages; (ii) preparation of tender documents and bid evaluation for the procurement of \nmaterials, plant, equipment, and vehicles; and (iii) recruitment of consultants. The issuance of \ninvitations to bid under advance procurement action will be subject to ADB approval. All advance \nprocurement actions will be undertaken in accordance with the Procurement Guidelines or ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) as appropriate. YMG \nhas requested retroactive financing for civil works and equipment for part of the water supply and \ncentral  heating  subcomponents  of  Yanji.  Contracts  proposed  for  retroactive  financing  will  be \nundertaken in accordance with the Procurement Guidelines. The Government, JPG, CMG, YMG, \nand the IAs have also been advised that approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing \ndoes not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n5.  Consulting Services \n45.  The Project provides funding for 18 person-months of international consulting services and \n108 person-months of national consulting services to support the Jilin PMO, Changchun and Yanji \nPIUs, and IAs in project implementation management and capacity development. A consulting firm \nwill be recruited in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using the quality- and \ncost-based selection method (80:20) and requesting full technical proposals. Consulting services \nare  required  for  (i)  project  management  and  construction  supervision;  (ii)  establishing  the \nmanagement  information  system  and  project  performance  management  systems  (PPMS);  (iii) \npreparing a strategy for reduction of non-revenue water in Changchun and Yanji along with a time-\nbound  action  plan;  (iv)  social,  environmental,  and  resettlement  monitoring;  (v)  financial \nmanagement; (vi) assisting with private sector participation initiatives; and (vii) improving O&M. \nCapacity development for the IAs will be achieved through consultant inputs, hands-on training, \nand domestic and international training financed from the loan. The outline terms of reference for \nthe consulting services is in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n6.  Governance and Anticorruption Policy \n46.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  CMG,  JPG,  YMG,  and  the  IAs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \n                                                \n31 The advance action on the procurement and recruitment of consultants, and the uploading of the general procurement \nnotice to the ADB website, will facilitate the start of the advance action process. ADB management approved advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing on 27 June 2007. ", "13\naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \ncovenants and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  CMG,  JPG,  YMG,  IAs,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. For the Project, CMG, JPG, \nand YMG will undertake the following anticorruption actions: (i) involve full-time officials from the \nprovincial and municipal discipline investigation bureaus in bidding and construction to enhance \nconstruction quality control and supervise effective work; (ii) introduce a dual signing system in \nwhich the civil works contract winner also signs an anticorruption contract with the employer; (iii) \nperiodically inspect the contractor\u2019s activities related to funds withdrawals and settlements; (iv) \nengage the project management consultant to support the PMO and the IAs to ensure good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency in project operations; (v) in consultation with relevant \nGovernment  ministries,  update  rules  and  regulations  on  local  and  corporate  governance  and \nanticorruption, and enhance transparency of the IAs\u2019 operations; and (vi) disclose audited financial \nstatements and project accounts and contract awards on the project websites of CMG, JPG, YMG, \nand the IAs. \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n47.  The loan proceeds for the proposed Project will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007, as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  facilitate  project \nimplementation and funds flow, the imprest account will be set up upon loan effectiveness and will \nbe exclusively used to finance the ADB share of eligible expenditures. The imprest account will be \nmanaged by the Jilin Provincial Financial Bureau. The initial advance to be deposited to an imprest \naccount will not exceed either 6 months of estimated expenditures or 10% of the loan amount, \nwhichever is lower. For the large works contracts under the Project, direct payment procedures will \napply.  If  the  Government  initially  funds  eligible  expenditures  from  its  own  resources,  the \nreimbursement  procedures  will  be  used.  To  expedite  funds  flow  and  simplify  documentation \nprocess,  the  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  procedure  will  be  used  for  liquidation  and \nreplenishment  of  imprest  accounts  and  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures not  exceeding \n$200,00032 per individual payment. The payments in excess of the SOE ceiling will be reimbursed, \nliquidated, or replenished based on full supporting documentation.  \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n48.  The PMO  will prepare and submit semiannual progress reports indicating (i) progress \nmade, (ii) problems encountered during the period under review, (iii) steps taken or proposed to \nremedy the problems, (iv) the proposed program of activities, and (v) progress expected in the next \nhalf year. The IAs will keep records to allow the identification of goods and services financed out of \nthe loan proceeds, following accounting principles and practices prescribed by the Accounting \nLaw33 of the PRC, which requires enterprises to prepare financial statements and generally follow \ninternationally accepted accounting standards. The IAs will maintain separate project accounts and \nrecords.  The  financial  statements  of  the  project  accounts  and  the  annual  corporate  financial \nstatements for IAs will be subject to external audit by the CMG and YMG audit bureaus, the Jilin \nProvincial Audit Bureau, and the State Audit Administration. The audits will be carried out in \naccordance  with  regulations  for  auditing  approved  by  the  State  Council  and  will  meet  ADB \nrequirements. A separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the imprest account and SOE will be part \n                                                \n32  In line with adequate financial capability of the executing agency or IA based on the financial management \nassessment, the ceiling of the statement of expenditure is identified at a higher level to facilitate disbursement. \n33 Accounting Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China was adopted by the Ninth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the \nSixth National People\u2019s Congress on 21 January 1985. ", "14\nof the audit reports. The IAs\u2019 annual audited financial statements and audited project accounts will \nbe  submitted  to  ADB  no  later  than  6  months  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  for  the  entire \nimplementation period. The Government, CMG, JPG, YMG, and the IAs have been informed about \nthe ADB policy requiring the submission of audited financial statements on time. JPG and the IAs \nwill submit reports and information to ADB concerning the use of the loan proceeds, project \nimplementation, and IA performance. These reports will include (i) semiannual progress reports on \nproject implementation, (ii) annual reports, and (iii) a project completion report not later than 3 \nmonths after the completion of the project facilities. \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n49.  The PPMS indicators, their relevance, and monitoring practicalities were confirmed and \nagreed with the PMO and IAs during project preparation. These include (i) service levels; (ii) \nnonrevenue water, water conservation, and treated water quality; (iii) treated wastewater quality \nand other operational performance measures; (iv) percentage of wastewater collected and treated; \n(v)  solid-waste  collection,  transportation,  and  treatment  efficiency  measures;  (vi)  air  pollution \nreduction indicators; (vii) public satisfaction with the urban environment; (viii) relevant economic \ndata to monitor project impacts on improved living conditions and economic opportunities; (ix) \nhealth and gender data; (x) the incidence of waterborne, vector-borne, and airborne diseases; and \n(xi) an increase in public awareness of environmental protection.  \n50.  At the beginning of the Project, the PMO and IAs, with the assistance of consultants, will \ndevelop comprehensive PPMS procedures to generate systematic data on the inputs and outputs \nof the subprojects, as well as the agreed abovementioned indicators to be used to measure project \nimpact. The PMO and IAs will (i) refine the PPMS framework, (ii) confirm achievable goals, (iii) \nconfirm monitoring and recording arrangements, and (iv) establish systems and procedures no \nlater than 6 months after loan effectiveness. Under the PPMS framework, baseline and progress \ndata will be reported at regular intervals by the PMO and the IAs, including semiannual reporting of \nthe environmental management plan (EMP). The PMO and IAs will be responsible for analyzing \nand consolidating the data through their management information systems, established at the time \nof loan implementation. The PPMS will be designed to permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial \naction regarding project design, schedules, activities, and development impacts. The PMO and \nIAs, with the assistance of the consultants, will monitor and assess activities, and report to ADB \nsemiannually  on  the  physical  implementation  and  financial  aspects  of  the  Project  from \ncommencement until 2 years after project completion, to ensure that impacts are monitored and \nreported in line with ADB requirements.\n10.  Project Review \n51.  ADB and the Government will jointly review project implementation at least once a year. In \naddition, ADB and the Government will undertake a comprehensive midterm review 2 years after \nthe start of project implementation. This will include a detailed review of the scope, implementation \narrangements, resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and progress on the agenda for \npolicy reform and capacity-building measures. Feedback from the PPMS activities will be analyzed. \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Impacts and Benefits \n52.  The Project will benefit about 3.6 million urban residents in the cities of Changchun and \nYanji, whose living conditions and public health standards will be improved through (i) improved \nquality of water supply and wastewater services and a reduction in nonpoint source pollution \nthrough increased SWM capacity, (ii) a reduction in the incidence of waterborne diseases such as \ndiarrhea and hepatitis A to below 2006 levels (to be monitored through the PPMS), (iii) a reduction ", "15\nin the risk of respiratory diseases by improving the central heating system and cutting utilization of \ncoal by 40% (or 298,000 tons) per heating season, and (iv) water savings of 700,000 m3 per \nheating season through water reuse and reduction of unaccounted-for water. \n53.  The Project will result in improved management and utilization of water resources in the \nupper SRB and the Buerhatong River, bringing positive downstream and transjurisdictional benefits \nin the province of Heilongjiang. The water quality improvements in the SRB and the Buerhatong \nRiver will also contribute to (i) integrated water resource management and pollution control, (ii) the \nbasin-wide management program, and (iii) transboundary pollution prevention and control. By \ndeveloping drinking water sources from rivers and existing reservoirs instead of relying solely on \noverexploited groundwater (use of which has reached unsustainable levels), the Project will secure \nthe  provision  of  a  clean  and  reliable  water  supply  for  Changchun  and  Yanji.  The  proposed \nextension, replacement, and rehabilitation of water distribution systems will increase the proportion \nof the population with access to piped water supplies. These improvements in the distribution \nsystem will reduce water losses and reduce the risk of contamination of treated water within the \ndistribution  system.  Recycling  wastewater  will  reduce  water  pollution  and  address  the  water \nshortage problem. The reliable water supply will reduce the burden on women responsible for \ndomestic duties and caring for the sick.  \nB.  Social Dimensions \n1.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n54.  Resettlement  impacts  have  been  identified  and  resettlement  plans  (RPs)  have  been \nprepared in accordance with PRC laws and regulations of land acquisition and resettlement and \nthe ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The land acquisition and resettlement program \nis designed to ensure that affected persons (APs) will be better off (or at least no worse off) as a \nresult of the Project. Overall, the land acquisition and resettlement impact for the Project will be \nsignificant. A total of one full RP and three short RPs with due-diligence reports have been \nprepared by the IAs with assistance of the local design institute or university. Based on the scope \nof impacts identified, the Project will affect 102 households (367 persons) permanently by land \nacquisition,  377  households  (1,388  persons)  by  temporary  land  occupation,  relocate  232 \nhouseholds (719 persons) due to the demolition of residential structures, and nine nonresidential \nstructures  with  49  employees.  Of  the  total  APs,  22  households  (51  persons)  are  of  Korean \nethnicity. A total of 127.49 hectares (ha) of land will be affected permanently (of which 67.03% is \nfarmland), 3,146.25 mu (209.75 ha) of rural collective and state-owned land will be occupied \ntemporarily, and 32,392.3 m2 of residential houses and 4,296.88 m2 of nonresidential structures will \nbe  demolished.  In  addition,  associated  productive  assets,  ground  attachments,  and  basic \ninfrastructure and facilities will also be affected. \n55.  The APs will be compensated and resettled in a timely and adequate manner in accordance \nwith the RPs so that they will be made better off (or at least be no worse off) than they would have \nbeen without the Project. To compensate for the economic and income losses, the following \nmeasures will be implemented during the resettlement process: (i) the Project owners will give the \nAPs priority to be employed in the activities during the project construction and operation, (ii) land \ncompensation will be used as basic social insurance for the farmers whose land is acquired, and \n(iii) secondary and tertiary industries (such as auto accessory manufacturing, community services, \ncommunity  medical  center,  transportation,  restaurant,  and  entertainment  services)  will  be \nexpanded to generate employment opportunities and increase incomes of the APs. Vocational \ntraining will be provided to the APs to increase their skills. The total costs of land acquisition and \nresettlement, including contingencies, is estimated at CNY355.59 million or $45.60 million.34 The \nsummary RP is in Appendix 8. JPG, CMG, YMG, and the IAs have implemented ADB\u2019s Public\n                                                \n34 The base resettlement costs excluding contingencies is estimated at CNY240.03 million or $31.75 million. ", "16\nCommunication Policy, which requires full disclosure for the resettlement activities by (i) distributing \ncopies of the resettlement information booklet to affected households and village offices on 12 \nJune 2007, (ii) posting the draft RPs in village offices or resident committees on 12 June 2007, and \n(iii) posting English versions of the draft RPs on the ADB website following their endorsement by \nJPG and Environment  and Social Safeguard Division on 21 June 2007. The final RPs were \nuploaded on the ADB website on 8 October 2007. \n56.  ADB requires both internal and external resettlement monitoring and evaluation of the APs \nduring  implementation.  The  IAs  will  report  progress  regularly  to  the  PMO,  which  in  turn  will \nsummarize the land acquisition and resettlement progress in the semi-annual progress reports to \nADB. The PMO will retain the services of a domestic external monitor for this purpose. The monitor \nwill visit the subprojects every 6 months to (i) review resettlement progress and the general welfare \nof those affected, (ii) make recommendations to resolve any issues or problems, and (iii) provide \nadvice to IAs and local officials. The monitor will pay special attention to vulnerable groups, \nincluding women and the poor, to assess whether they have fully regained their standard of living. \nMonitoring and evaluation reports will be prepared every 6 months during implementation, and \nannually  for  2  years  after  the  completion  of  resettlement.  These  reports  will  be  submitted \nsimultaneously to ADB, PMO, and the IAs, and will be uploaded to the ADB website. \n2.  Poverty Reduction and Social Benefits \n57.  Poverty and social analysis was undertaken in line with ADB guidelines to collect detailed \nsocial information to inform project design and identify poverty reduction and social development \nobjectives, outcomes, and indicators. In addition to the socioeconomic survey, public consultations \nwere  conducted  with  different  groups  of  stakeholders  including  consumer  groups,  business \ncommunities, government agencies, people affected by the Project, and civil society organizations. \nA  participatory  approach  was  adopted  for  project  design  and  will  continue  during  project \nimplementation. The poverty and social analysis identified vulnerable groups and opportunities for \npro-poor interventions, and recommended social action measures and participation and mitigation \nplans to achieve positive social benefits. The summary poverty reduction and social development \nstrategy is in Appendix 9. \n58.  The  Project  will  directly  benefit  an  urban  population  of  3.2  million  in  Changchun  and \n420,400  in  Yanji.  Of  the  total  direct  beneficiary  population,  about  240,000  or  5.54%  (7%  in \nChangchun and 3.85% in Yanji) are classified as poor based on the weighted average local urban \npoverty line of CNY1,925 per year. The Project will support poverty reduction by (i) providing a \nsafer  and  more  reliable  urban  water  supply;  (ii)  improving  the  natural  environment  through \nincreased  wastewater  treatment  and  better  SWM;  (iii)  reducing  morbidity  due  to  decreased \nexposure to waterborne diseases; (iv) reducing the risk of respiratory diseases by improving the \ncentral heating system; and (v) providing employment opportunities for the poor. The Project will \nimprove public health by reducing waterborne and respiratory diseases through improved water \nsupply, expanded wastewater and SWM capacity, and a more energy efficient central heating \nsystem. The health impact analysis is in Supplementary Appendix G. Provision of clean water will \nimprove the quality of life of the poor and vulnerable by reducing the proportion of household \nincome spent on medical treatment for waterborne diseases. The number of school days and \nworkdays lost due to sickness will also be reduced. Further, the Project will reduce the proportion \nof household income spent on buying water from private sources and buying storage containers, \nfilters, and other water purifying equipment. Water pressure improvements will greatly enhance the \nquality of life of households living in apartments and reduce their water pumping costs. The better \ncentral heating system will reduce the use of coal by 40%, and this will have positive health \nimpacts, particularly on the poor.    \n59.  The Project will create 3,880 full time jobs during construction, generating about CNY48 \nmillion in wages per year. About 30% of the employment opportunities during the construction and ", "17\noperation phases of the Project are expected to be filled by women. Project operations will create \n810  full-time  permanent  jobs.  Project-related  services,  such  as  procurement  of  construction \nmaterials and equipment, and follow-on multiplier effects will create an additional 5,000 jobs. In the \nproject area, the major social measures to protect urban residents from falling into poverty include \n(i) a living allowance for laid-off employees, (ii) unemployment insurance, and (iii) a social support \nprogram under the minimum living standard scheme. Further, CMG and YMG have agreed to \nimplement poverty reduction35 measures including (i) lifeline tariffs, (ii) water bill discounts or cash \nrebates amounting to 50% of the monthly water bill for households living below the poverty line, \nand (iii) connections to tap water for the poorest households in Changchun and Yanji. The Project \nwill promote public awareness through education programs about project benefits, public hygiene, \nand consumer behavior on water saving and wastewater disposal. \nC.  Financial Aspects \n60.  The financial evaluation of the Project was undertaken in real terms using constant 2007 \nprices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to real \nterms  by  adjusting  for  the  projected  effects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation  and  currency \nfluctuation. Incremental benefits and costs were derived by evaluating the financial position of the \nIAs under with-project and without-project scenarios. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for \nthe Project was computed on an after-tax basis of 9.0%, which compares favorably with the \nweighted average cost of capital in real terms of 3.52%. The financial analysis is in Appendix 10. \nThe detailed financial analysis is in Supplementary Appendix I. The sensitivity analysis includes \nexamination of the risk that (i) project costs will increase by 10% (resulting in an FIRR of 7.93%), \n(ii) O&M costs will increase by 10% (resulting in an FIRR of 7.04%), and (iii) revenues will be \nreduced due to delays in tariff adjustments (resulting in an FIRR of 5.74%). Detailed verification of \nthe local financing plan indicates that the equity contributions are about 1% of annual revenues \nfrom CMG and 1.5% from YMG, indicating minimal risk. CMG and YMG have sufficient financial \nresources to take on responsibility for guaranteeing the loan repayments, and have provided \nassurances that they accept this risk. An affordability analysis has been undertaken based on \nproposed tariffs and household income data from the social survey. Tariffs under the Project are \nconsidered affordable if the combined average water and wastewater charges are less than 5% of \nmonthly household income. The estimated tariffs on this basis are affordable to the average \nhousehold (2.0% of monthly income), and also affordable to the poorest 10% of households (less \nthan 3.4% of monthly income before accounting for poverty reduction measures that exist now or \nthat have been committed to).\n61.  The IAs agreed to minimum levels of financial performance, and these will be included as \nloan covenants covering capital structure (debt-equity), debt service cover, and liquidity. Financial \nprojections estimate the tariffs required for an appropriate level of financial performance. Periodic \ntariff reviews will be required to overcome the risk of poor financial performance or of unexpected \nchanges in tariff income. The financial sustainability of the Project was verified through the financial \nanalysis of the IAs. The project sustainability assessment is in Supplementary Appendix H. The \nfinancial  projections  for  the  IAs indicate  that  the  minimum  debt-service  coverage  ratios  and \nacceptable rates of return on equity will generally be achieved by the Project. To ensure that the \nProject does not have an adverse fiscal impact on any level of government, retail tariffs were \nstructured on the basis of achieving full cost recovery.  \n                                                \n35 The technical assistance study (i) defined poverty levels used in the analysis, (ii) assessed and provided an income \nand expenditure profile of poor households based on a household survey of 500 households, (iii) evaluated and \nrecommended measures to alleviate the impacts of increased water and wastewater tariffs on the poor, and (iv) \nassessed the positive impacts of the Project on the poor and low-income beneficiaries.  ", "18\nD.  Economic Aspects \n62.  The  Project  is  an  integral  part  of  the  ongoing  provincial,  municipal,  and  river  basin \nenvironmental  programs,  contributing  significantly  to  pollution  control  in  the  SRB  and  the \nBuerhatong River. Public perceptions and preferences were also evaluated using household and \nbusiness surveys. The analysis demonstrates that water supply, wastewater management, SWM, \nand efficient central heating rank highest in priority when compared with a range of other public \nservices.  A  quantitative  economic  analysis  also  demonstrates  the  value  of  the  Project.  The \neconomic analysis was conducted for 25 years including project construction, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Project benefits and costs were estimated \non a with-project and without-project basis. Costs were divided into tradable and nontradable \ncosts,  and  benefits  were  adjusted  to  account  for  non-incremental  and  incremental  benefits. \nIncremental economic benefits were valued on the basis of willingness to pay. The economic \ninternal rate of return for the components ranges from 15.8% to 28.0%, and is 23.8% for the whole \nProject, which exceeds the economic opportunity cost of capital, assumed at 12%. The economic \nanalysis is in Appendix 11. The detailed economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix J. \nE.  Environmental Aspects \n63.  The Government has met the requirements of ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). Extensive \npublic consultations involving meetings with stakeholders, focus-group discussions, and surveys \nwere undertaken twice during preparation of the domestic environmental impact assessments \n(EIAs). The EIAs summarize the environmental impacts, mitigation measures, and monitoring \nplans. The EMP, prepared as part of the EIA, will guide environmental mitigation and monitoring \nunder the Project. All the EIAs have been approved by the Jilin Provincial Environmental Protection \nBureau.  The  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  (SEIA)  and  the  EMP  have  been \nconfirmed by the Government. The SEIA concludes that the Project will have substantial positive \nenvironmental and socioeconomic benefits. The SEIA was circulated to the ADB Board and posted \non the ADB website on 18 May 2007. The overall findings of the SEIA and EIAs are that negative \nimpacts on air, water, and the acoustic environment are expected, especially during construction. \nIn general these impacts will be temporary and localized. The proposed mitigation measures are \ndescribed in the SEIA. These measures will be developed into a detailed EMP in the design and \nconstruction  phases.  The  EMPs  will  be  implemented  by  IAs,  monitored  and  supervised  by \nprofessional  environmental  management  specialists  or  companies  and  local  environmental \nmonitoring  centers,  and  reported  to  the  Jilin  PMO,  Jilin  Provincial  Environmental  Protection \nBureau, and ADB. \n64.  By  intercepting  direct  discharges  of  raw  sewage  into  the  Yitong  River  and  Xinlicheng \nReservoir and having them treated in the Dongnan WWTP, the subcomponent will improve (i) the \ndrinking water quality in the Xinlicheng Reservoir from class III to class II, and (ii) the water quality \nof the SRB by reducing pollution loads of 12,411 tons of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 547 \ntons of ammonia nitrogen annually. The Yanji water reuse subcomponent will (i) allow the Yanji \nWWTP to optimally utilize its capacity, (ii) reduce annual pollutant loads of 1,825 tons COD into the \nBuerhatong River (which represents a 50% reduction of COD discharge), (iii) conserve 50,000 \nm3/day  (or  18.25  million  m3  annually)  of  fresh  water  through  water  reuse.  The  heating \nsubcomponent will include the replacement of 318 polluting coal-based boilers, resulting in (i) a \nmajor air quality improvement in Yanji from class III to class II in the winter season, (ii) a 40% \nenergy saving due to replacement of small energy-inefficient boilers, (iii) a 3\u20135 times reduction of \nhot water leakage by upgrading the retrofitted existing heating network, which is estimated to save \nCNY20 million a year. ", "19\nF.  Project Risks and Mitigation Measures \n65.  The Project does not have any unusual technical risks. Conventional engineering designs \nwith  proven  records  of  reliable  performance  are  adopted  for  water  supply,  wastewater \nmanagement, SWM, and central heating supply. During project implementation, the consultants \nwill support the PMO and IAs to ensure delivered equipment and works comply with the design \nrequirements  and  quality  standards.  The  following  risks  could  affect  timely  implementation, \neconomic viability, and reduce the available benefits of the Project: (i) amendments and changes \nto the Changchun and Yanji master plans; (ii) lack of proper O&M of project facilities; (iii) ineffective \norganizational  structures  and  inadequate  capacity  of  the  IAs,  which  could  result  in  inefficient \nproject development and delays in implementation; (iv) delays in the provision of counterpart \nfunding; (v) the failure of CMG and YMG to increase water, wastewater, solid-waste, and heating \ntariffs to meet cost recovery targets; and (vi) unforeseen land acquisition and resettlement issues, \nwhich  could  constrain  the  efficient  implementation  of  the  Project  works  and  restoration  of \nlivelihoods of the affected persons. \n66.  Risk (i) will be mitigated by synchronizing the Project design and implementation schedules \nwith other projects planned in Jilin province, which have also provided specific assurances that are \ncovenanted in the Loan Agreement. Risks (ii) and (iii) will be mitigated through the provision of \ninstitutional capacity development for the IAs with the support of consultants. Risks (iv) and (v) will \nbe mitigated through covenanted assurances from CMG and YMG on the provision of counterpart \nfunding and regular tariff review and increases. Risk (vi) will be mitigated by strengthening the \ninternal monitoring and supervision by the PMO, municipal PMOs, and the IAs, and by engaging a \nqualified external agency to monitor and evaluate resettlement. Several other measures will also \nhelp  mitigate  the  project  risks:  (i)  the  appointment  of  project  implementation  and  monitoring \nconsultants, including environmental monitoring consultants, (ii) EMP monitoring and mitigation \narrangements, (iii) EMP environmental management training, and (iv) specific assurances from \nCMG  and  YMG  that  the  project  leading  group  and  PMO  are  retained  for  the  entire  loan \nimplementation period and beyond. \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n67.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, CMG, JPG, YMG and the IAs \nhave provided the following assurances, which will be incorporated into the Loan and Project \nAgreements. The full list of assurances is in the Loan and Project Agreement, and Supplementary \nAppendix K.  \n(i)  JPG, CMG, and YMG will also undertake the following anticorruption actions: (a) \ninvolve respective concerned agencies with oversight responsibility for each project \nimplementing agency (PIA) in bidding and construction to enhance construction \nquality control and supervise effective work; (b) introduce a dual-signing system, in \nwhich  the  civil  works  contract  winner  signs  an  anticorruption  contract  with  the \nemployer when they execute the civil works contract; (c) periodically inspect the \ncontractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements; (d) engage the \nproject management consultant to support the Jilin PMO and the PIAs to ensure \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency  in  project  operations;  (e)  in \nconsultation  with  relevant  central  government  ministries  update  rules  and \nregulations on local and corporate governance and anticorruption and enhance \ntransparency of the PIA\u2019s operations; and (f) disclose a summary of the financial \nstatements  and  Project  accounts,  schedules  of  proposed  tariff  increases  and ", "20\nassociated public hearings; and tracking of procurement contract awards on the \nexisting Project website of CMG, and YMG.  \n(ii)  The JPG, CMG, and YMG will ensure that: (a) all land and rights-of-way required by \nthe Project are made available in a timely manner; (b) the resettlement plan will be \nimplemented  promptly  and  efficiently  in  accordance  with  their  terms;  and  the \nprovisions of the RP will be implemented in accordance with all applicable PRC laws \nand regulations, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995); (c) all APs are \ngiven  adequate  opportunity  to  participate  in  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation; and ensure that they will be at least as well off as they would have \nbeen in the absence of the Project; (d) timely provision of counterpart funds will be \npaid  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities;  and  (e)  any  obligations  in \nexcess of the resettlement plan budget estimates are met.  \n(iii)  JPG shall, and shall cause CMG and YMG to, ensure that the tariffs for treated \nwater and wastewater services, and heating charged by the concerned IAs are set \nat  a  level  that  ensures  full  cost  recovery  of  operation  and  maintenance, \ndepreciation,  and  financial  costs,  including  debt  service  obligations,  and  a \nreasonable profit margin for the IAs. \nB.  Condition for Disbursement \n68.  As  a  condition  for  disbursement  of  the  loan  proceeds  for  any  subcomponent,  the \nGovernment will submit to ADB the certification that (i) onlending agreement had been entered into \nbetween CMG, YMG and each concerned IA; and (ii) such onlending terms contain the same \nfinancial terms and conditions as required in the Loan Agreement and project implementation \nrequirements applicable to the IAs as provided in the Project Agreement. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n69.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of \nArticle 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board approve the loan of \n$100,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Jilin Urban Environmental Improvement \nProject from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of 25 years, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board. \nLiqun Jin \nVice President \n5 October 2007", "Appendix 1  21\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanism  and Risks \nImpact  Assumptions \nEnhanced urban  Water quality of the Yitong  Monitoring reports of the  (cid:120)  Timely implementation \nenvironment and improved  and Yongchun rivers in  Changchun and Yanji  of Changchun and \npublic health and quality of  Changchun that flow into  Environmental Protection  Yanji 11th Five Year \nlife for the urban residents  the SRB will be improved  Bureaus and Water  Programs and other \nin the cities of Changchun  from the current class V to  Resources Conservancy  medium- and long-term \nand Yanji in Jilin province.  class III, and water quality  Bureaus, and the State  development plans \nof the Buerhatong River in  Environmental Protection  (cid:120)  Changchun and Yanji \nYanji will be improved from  Bureau urban city plans are \nthe current class III to class  successfully \nII by 2015.

", "26 Appendix 2 \nURBAN SECTOR ANALYSIS \nA.  Water Supply \n1. Current Status of Water Supply. Jilin province faces the same water shortage issue \nthat  is  common  among  all  northern  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  provinces.  As  the \nprovincial  capital,  Changchun  Municipality  relies  on  four  municipal  water  treatment  plants \n(WTPs) with a total capacity of 930,000 cubic meters per day (m3/day) to provide the urban area \nwith adequate water for domestic and industrial use. The daily water demand has averaged \naround 980,000 m3/day and has been increasing for the past 4 years. Newly developed urban \nareas in Changchun frequently experience low water pressure due to the increased water \ndemand and insufficient local water supply capacity. In the central urban area, many residential \nareas still do not have 24-hour water supply. Yanji relies on the Baishi WTP to serve its urban \narea. Other self-supply facilities also exist in the city to extract groundwater for use by the urban \nresidents. The total water supply capacity is approximately 110,000 m3/day. The average water \ndemand in the city increased from 99,000 m3/day in 2001 to 109,800 m3/day in 2006. This sharp \nincrease  is  challenging  the  city\u2019s  limited  water  supply  capacity.  Many  households  are  not \ncovered by the existing distribution system or do not receive 24-hour water supply service due \nto  inadequate  water  supply  capacity.  Moreover,  aged  distribution  pipelines  in  Yanji  have \nresulted in large water losses through leakage.  \n2. Government Response. The activities required to be completed in the 11th Five Year \nProgram (FYP) to strengthen Changchun\u2019s water supply system include (i) the construction of \nthe No. 5 WTP and the development of the proposal for the No. 6 WTP, (ii) renovation of the \nwater supply facilities within the urban area to ensure a 24-hour water supply, (iii) upgrading of \n455 kilometers (km) of water supply pipelines, and (iv) water supply capacity to reach 1,456,000 \nm3/day by 2018. The activities to be completed to strengthen Yanji\u2019s water supply system \ninclude (i) completion of the Yanji Reservoir project, (ii) upgrading of 37 km of water distribution \npipelines, and (iii) preservation of natural forests in the upstream regions of the Wudao and \nYanji reservoirs to safeguard drinking water sources.  \n3. Project Response. The Changchun No.5 WTP and distribution mains subcomponents \nwill increase the city\u2019s water supply capacity by 300,000 m3/day after its completion by the end \nof 2011. The Changchun Dongnan wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) subcomponent includes \nthe construction of 36 km of wastewater interception mains, which will collect wastewater that \ncurrently flows into the drainage area impacting the Xinlicheng Reservoir. The Yanji WTP and \nnetwork upgrading subcomponent will increase the water supply capacity in Yanji by 60,000 \nm3/day, and improve 36.5 km of the current water distribution system. \nB.  Wastewater Management \n4.  Current Status of Wastewater Management. The volume of wastewater discharged in \nChangchun in 2005 was 218.324 million m3, and the wastewater treatment rate was 49%. There \nare currently four WWTPs in Changchun: (i) the Beijiao WWTP (primary treatment facility, \n390,000 m3/day); (ii) the Xijiao WWTP (150,000 m3/day); (iii) the No. 1 Automobile Manufactory \nWWTP (25,000 m3/day); and (iv) the Shuangyang WWTP (25,000 m3/day). As of 2005, the \nlength of the sewer network in Changchun was 2,169.2 km. The volume of domestic wastewater \ndischarged in Yanji was 67,000 m3/day in 2004 and 66,000 m3/day in 2005. The wastewater in \nYanji  was  discharged  directly  into  the  Buerhatong  River  before  the  Yanji  WWTP  started \noperations at the end of 2006. The Yanji WWTP (100,000 m3/day) is currently the only municipal \nWWTP in Yanji. The length of sewer network in Yanji was 166 km in 2004 and 177 km in 2005. ", "Appendix 2  27\nUnderdevelopment  of  wastewater  facilities  in  both  Changchun  and  Yanji  leads  to  the \ndeterioration of water quality in local rivers, poses a threat to public health, and adversely \naffects the quality of life in Changchun and Yanji. Water quality in the Yitong and Yongchun \nrivers in Changchun does not meet class V of the National Water Quality Standard. Water \nquality in the Yanji section of the Buerhatong River has deteriorated from class III to class IV. \n5. Government  Response.  The  Changchun  11th  FYP  aims  to  achieve  a  wastewater \ntreatment rate of 70% by 2010. The subsequent target is to achieve a wastewater treatment rate \nof 80% by 2012. The volume of wastewater discharged from the downtown area of Changchun \nis projected to reach 1.407 million m3/day by 2010, and the wastewater treatment rate will be \nincreased to 80%. Two WWTPs are planned\u2014the Dongnan WWTP and the South WWTP\u2014\nwith an aggregate capacity of 250,000 m3/day (Phase I). The existing Beijiao WWTP will be \nupgraded to a secondary treatment plant and the capacity will be expanded to 390,000 m3/day.\nAbout 350 km of drainage network will be established or replaced. The capacity of the Yanji \nWWTP will be expanded and this will improve the wastewater treatment rate to 95% set in the \n11th FYP, and this includes installation of 30 km of wastewater collection mains along the \nBuerhatong River bank and 82 km of wastewater collection network in the urban area. \n6. Project Response. The proposed WWTPs and effluent reuse subcomponents under the \nProject will contribute to (i) a significant reduction of discharge loads into the Yitong River in \nChangchun and the Buerhatong River in Yanji by intercepting direct discharges of raw sewage, \n(ii) improvement of the water quality of the Yitong River and Xinlicheng Reservoir in Changchun \nand the Buerhatong River in Yanji, and (iii) improvement of sanitation and hygiene conditions in \nboth cities. \nC.  Domestic Solid-Waste Management \n7. Current Status. The only existing sanitary landfill in Changchun has a design capacity \nof 2,500 tons per day. A medical waste disposal center was put into operation in 2006 to treat \nthe medical waste from the city. In addition, a night-soil treatment center with a capacity of 100 \ntons per day is under construction and will be put into operation in 2007 to treat the night-soils \ncollected from the urban area. During the past 5 years, the Jilin provincial government (JPG) \nhas accorded high priority to improving its solid-waste management facilities.   \n8. Government  and  Project  Response.  The  construction  of  the  Changchun  sanitary \nlandfill is a major undertaking by the Government and is designed to deal with the growing \nproblems associated with domestic solid-waste disposal. The design capacity of 2,600 tons per \nday accounts for about 18% of the total domestic solid-waste generated in Jilin province, and \nthis contributes significantly to the Government\u2019s domestic solid-waste sanitary disposal goals. \nThe project subcomponent includes (i) a 2,600 tons per day sanitary landfill with 10-year service \nlife (a total of 22 years after expansion in the future) with related retention walls, a 300 m3/day \nleachate treatment plant, a landfill gas collection and emission control system, 1.6 km of roads \ninside the landfill, and associated machinery and equipment; (ii) one transfer station with 2,000 \ntons  per  day  capacity  and  associated  machinery  and  equipment;  and  (iii)  30  solid-waste \ntransport trucks.  \nD.  Central Heating \n9.  Status of Central Heating in Yanji. Jilin province has a relatively long winter and \naccordingly needs heating for 170 days per year. The existing central heating plant in Yanji is \nsupplying heat to the city\u2019s downtown area. The plant services an area of only 2 million square ", "28 Appendix 2 \nmeters (m2) (15% of the city) due to its limited capacity and incomplete heating distribution \nnetwork coverage. It is inefficient because (i) the retrofitted distribution system that it uses does \nnot allow efficient hot water delivery, and (ii) the plant is an older single purpose design that fails \nto achieve the efficiencies possible with newer cogeneration (heat and power) plants. The \nremaining city area is heated by approximately 318 small inefficient boilers, resulting in total \nsuspended particulates in the urban area averaging 0.38 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3),\nmore than twice the state environmental standard of 0.15 mg/m3. Yanji will construct a new \ncogeneration plant1 which is expected to be completed by 2010, allowing complete coverage of \nthe city with a central heating service. In this regard, new heating distribution networks that \nconnect the existing central heating plant and the new cogeneration plant with the rest of the \ncity need to be completed to effectively utilize the city\u2019s central heating supply capacity. The \nproposed Project will (i) complete the urgently needed central heating distribution networks for \nYanji, (ii) lead to the closure and replacement of the 318 polluting coal-based boilers,2 and (iii) \nresult in a major improvement in the air quality of Yanji, which will contribute significantly to \npublic health in Yanji city. Coal is the predominant energy source in Yanji and it accounts for \n98% of all consumed fuel (coal consumption is 1.1 million tons per year). Recent air quality \nmonitoring indicates that the air quality in Yanji could be characterized as class III in winter. \nDuring winter air quality deteriorates significantly due to pollution from the inefficient coal-based \nboilers. The total suspended particulates in winter exceed the environmental standard, posing a \nthreat to public health. Incidents of acute carbon monoxide poisoning due to inefficient coal \ncombustion at local sources have occasionally been registered.  \n10. Project Response. The Yanji central heating component has two subcomponents. The \nfirst subcomponent will provide central heating to an area of 6.97 million m2 south of the \nBuerhatong River, and includes 42.52 km of heating pipelines, 6.2 km of steam pipelines, 35 \nheat-exchange stations, and one booster pumping station. The second subcomponent will \nprovide central heating to an area of 9.3 million m2 north of the Buerhatong River, and includes \n77.6 km of heating pipelines and 64 heat-exchange stations.  \n                                                \n1  The  project  proposal  for  the  cogeneration  plant  was  approved  by  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission in 1995. In 2003, the National Development and Reform Commission confirmed that the 1995 \napproval was still valid. This cogeneration plant is outside the scope of the proposed Project and is being financed \ndomestically.  \n2  Originally there were 700 coal-based boilers. To date, the Yanji municipal government has closed 382 boilers and \nthe remaining 318 boilers will be closed during the implementation of the proposed Project.

The Project is composed of seven subprojects in Changchun and Yanji cities, all of which \nwill require some land acquisition and population resettlement. The resettlement planning and \nimplementation is designed to ensure that the affected persons (APs) will be better off (or at \nleast no worse off) as a result of the Project. Overall, the land acquisition and resettlement \nimpacts of the Project will be significant. A total of two full resettlement plans (RPs), three short \nRPs, and two short RPs with due-diligence reports have been prepared. \n2.  The impacts of the Project are summarized in Table A8.1. In total, about 128 hectares \n(ha) of land will be permanently acquired by the Project, of which 67% is classified as farmland. \nPermanent land acquisition will affect 102 households (367 persons). The Project will also \nrequire the temporary acquisition of 210 ha of land, of which 41% is farmland, and affect 377 \nhouseholds (1,388 persons). A total of 232 households (719 persons) will be relocated and \nabout 32,392 square meters (m2) of residential houses will be demolished. Nine enterprises and \nshops with a total of 49 employees will be affected and 4,297 m2 of nonresidential structures will \nbe  dismantled.  In  addition,  some  productive  assets,  ground  attachments,  and  public \ninfrastructure and facilities will be affected, including electric poles, toilets, fences, hand-pumped \nwells, doors, pig pens, platform, toilets, barns, greenhouses, cement and asphalt roads, and \ntrees.  Of  the  total  affected  population,  711  households  (2,491  persons)  affected  are  rural \nresidents, and 32 persons urban residents, owners of structures with or without certificates, and \nprivate business owners. Of the total APs, 22 households (51 persons) are Korean living in Yanji \ncity.\n3.  In  order  to  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  there  was  close \nconsultation with the local officials and village and street committees during the preliminary and \nfinal feasibility study stages.\n4.  Compensation for the permanent land loss is based on the Land Administration Law of \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) (1998) and the State Council Decision to Deepen Reform and \nStrictly  Enforce  Land  Administration  (Document  28,  dated  November  2004).  The  house \ndemolition  is  based  on  the  Provincial  and  Municipal  Urban  Housing  Demolishment \nAdministration  Regulations.  The  RPs  prepared  comply  with  PRC  laws  and  regulation  of \nresettlement and the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995).\nBased on consultations with local governments and those affected, and general practice in \nChangchun and Yanji cities, a set of compensation standards was adopted by the respective city \nproject  management  offices  (PMOs)  and  implementing  agencies  (IAs).  The  resettlement \nprinciples established for the Project are that (i) land acquisition and involuntary resettlement \nshould be avoided or minimized where feasible by developing and comparing a series of design \nalternatives;  (ii)  compensation  and  entitlements  provided  are  based  on  market  value  or \nreplacement value and must be adequate to allow those affected to at least maintain their \npreproject standard of living, with the prospect of improvement; (iii) land temporarily occupied \nand the period for disruption are to be kept to a minimum; (iv) all the people affected (legal and \nillegal) are to be taken into consideration and accounted for; (v) the per capita landholding after \nland acquisition will be sufficient to maintain the previous livelihood standard; (vi) where land \nallocation per capita is not sufficient to maintain the previous livelihood standards, other income-\ngenerating activities will be provided for; (vii) a preferential policy will be provided to vulnerable \ngroups in such things as compensation, payment of special fund, minimum living guarantee, and \nemployment; (viii) all those affected will be adequately informed about eligibility, compensation \nrates and standards, livelihood and income restoration plans, and project timing; and (ix) close \nmonitoring and timely actions will be carried out to identify and resolve any problems.  ", "44 Appendix 8 \n5.  In accordance with the PRC national, provincial, and municipal policies and regulations \nfor  land  acquisition,  house  demolition,  and  resettlement,  together  with  ADB  policies  and \nguidelines, the PMO and IAs have conducted public consultations, negotiation, and information \ndisclosure  sessions  with  the  APs,  villages,  and  county  governments  during  the  project \npreparation stage. During meetings, interviews, focus-group discussions, public consultation \nworkshops, and community consultation meetings, local representatives have participated in the \nplanning and concerns have been integrated into the RPs. The draft RPs were distributed or \ndisclosed to the affected counties, townships, villages, and affected persons on 12 June 2007, \nand resettlement information booklets have been disseminated to all the APs. This booklet has \nconfirmed (i) the project-affected areas, (ii) the implementation schedule and framework, (iii) the \ncompensation standards for land acquisition and other assets, (iv) relocation assistance, (v) the \nlivelihood rehabilitation strategy, and (vi) dispute resolution procedures. JPG, CMG, YMG, and \nthe IAs have implemented ADB\u2019s Public Communication Policy, which requires full disclosure for \nthe resettlement activities by (i) distributing copies of the resettlement information booklet to \naffected households and village offices on 12 June 2007, (ii) posting the draft RPs in village \noffices or resident committees on 12 June 2007, and (iii) posting English versions of the draft \nRPs on the ADB website following their endorsement by JPG and Environment and Social \nSafeguard Division on 21 June 2007. The final RPs were uploaded on the ADB website on 8 \nOctober 2007. The respective project IAs will establish project resettlement units for supervising \nimplementation,  continuing  public  consultation,  monitoring  progress,  and  responding  to \ngrievances. The grievance redress procedures are well established and explanations will be \nincluded in the resettlement information booklets.  \n6.  For land acquisition, land compensation will be paid in cash to the affected villages to be \nused as basic social insurance for the farmers whose land is newly acquired; resettlement \nsubsidies and standing crops will be paid to the APs. For residential houses and nonresidential \n(enterprises and shops) structures to be demolished, compensation will be paid to owners, \nincluding  those  without  certificates.  The  payment  will  be  made  in  cash  according  to  the \nappraised  value  of  the  property.  The  households  that  have  to  relocate  will  also  receive  a \nrelocation allowance. Compensation for standing crops, auxiliaries, and other assets will also be \npaid directly to the APs. Income losses resulting from reduced production or sales and wages \ncaused by the Project will be compensated for in cash. \n7.  The resettlement strategy encompasses (i) the replacement of housing, and (ii) the \nrestoration of livelihoods and income. For people losing housing in rural areas, there are two \nresettlement options: (i) to receive cash compensation, or (ii) to receive cash compensation plus \nprovision of a house plot for house construction by the APs themselves. Assistance will be \nprovided to construct new houses or find available housing close to their original homes, if that is \ntheir  preference.  The  respective  municipal  PMOs,  IAs,  and  local  governments  will  provide \nnecessary assistance for house construction and relocation during resettlement implementation. \n8.  The  measures  for  economic  rehabilitation  include  (i)  provision  of  employment \nopportunities during the project construction and operational phases, (ii) provision of basic social \ninsurance to the APs whose land is acquired, (iii) development of crops with higher economic \nvalue, (iv) promotion and development of new enterprises and self-employed secondary and \ntertiary businesses (such as auto accessory manufacturing, community services, transportation, \nentertainment, and catering services), and (v) provision  of technical training to the APs to \nincrease  their  skills.  Relocated  enterprises  and  shops  will  be  provided  with  the  options  of \ncompensation and resettlement. The same shops will reemploy the affected employees. ", "Appendix 8  45 \n9.  Based on the survey results, seven vulnerable people (including four disabled, one elder \nand two poor persons) are affected due to the construction of Changchun Domestic Solid Waste \nManagement. For the vulnerable people, the respective municipal PMOs and IAs will establish a \nspecial fund at CNY2,000 per person for them to improve their living standards. The fund will be \npaid as a one-time cash payment. In addition, the vulnerable households will receive CNY140 \nper month as a municipal living guarantee from the municipal civil affairs bureau. The PMO and \nIA  will  supervise  implementation  to  ensure  these  vulnerable  persons  receive  adequate \ncompensation,  housing  arrangements,  special  funds,  and  municipal  living  guarantee,  and \nassistance to restore their living conditions and incomes. \n10.  Each PMO will have at least two full-time staff responsible for land acquisition, and each \nIA  will  have  at  least  two  full-time  staff  responsible  for  resettlement.  The  staff  from  each \nsubproject resettlement unit will be responsible for coordinating the planning, implementation, \nfinancing,  and  monitoring  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  They  will  work  closely  with \nrelevant village officials, land administration bureaus, and house demolishment offices, and will \nbe  responsible  for  supervision  and  monitoring  of  resettlement  (including  the  delivery  of \nentitlements, selection of new housing sites, restoration of incomes, provision of replacement \nland, and other economic measures). A training program will be organized for the resettlement \nofficers.\n11.  The cost estimate for land acquisition and resettlement is $45.6 million, equivalent to \nCNY355.59 million in 2007 prices, including contingencies. Resettlement implementation will be \nscheduled to precede the subproject construction schedules. Most resettlement activities will \noccur  between  February  2008  and  December  2009.  Resettlement  implementation  will  be \ncompleted prior to subproject construction. Detailed measurement surveys will be conducted in \neach village, neighborhood, and enterprise and shop, and the compensation contracts will be \nnegotiated and signed with village committees, households, and enterprises. Based on these \nsurveys, the resettlement plans will be updated and submitted to ADB for review and approval. \n12.  Internal and external monitoring of RP implementation will be conducted. Monitoring \nmethodologies are specified in the RPs. Internal supervision and monitoring will be done by each \nIA to ensure compliance with the provisions of the RP. The PMO and IAs have agreed to a set of \nsupervision milestones with ADB to ensure timely and effective implementation of resettlement \nactivities  (see  Table  A8.2).  External  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  carried  out  by  an \nindependent agency under contract to the PMO and IAs. External monitoring reports will be \nforwarded directly to both the PMO and ADB. \nTable A8.1: Resettlement Supervision Milestone \nNo.  Resettlement Tasks  Target  Responsible Agency  Deadline  Status \nA.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national priority    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national priority   Yes \nin country poverty analysis?    in country poverty partnership agreement?   \n   No    No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \nThe Project will directly benefit an urban population of 3.2 million in Changchun and 420,400 in Yanji. Of the total direct \nbeneficiary population, about 240,000 or 5.54% (7% in Changchun and 3.85% in Yanji) are classified as poor, based on the \nweighted average local urban poverty line of CNY1,925 per year. The Project will benefit the urban residents through (i) \nimprovements to water supply infrastructure, (ii) the disposal of wastewater, (iii) better solid-waste management facilities, and\n(iv) an improved energy efficient central heating system. The Project will contribute to poverty reduction through increased \nquality of life by reducing the incidence of waterborne and airborne diseases, and providing employment opportunities \nduring construction and operation of the project facilities, with anticipated effects on economic development. \nThe Project will assist with the country\u2019s progress in meeting Millennium Development Goal 7, target 10 to halve the \nproportion of people without access to basic sanitation by increasing coverage of the Changchun and Yanji wastewater \nsystem by 2015. It will contribute to reductions in medical costs incurred as a result of contracting waterborne and airborne \ndiseases in Changchun and Yanji. Health benefits are expected to be disproportionately realized by women as they are \nmore vulnerable to waterborne diseases due to greater contact with water from household responsibilities (especially \ncooking and washing), and are most responsible for care of the young and old. The annual health benefit to be gained \ndirectly from the urban environmental improvement in both Changchun and Yanji is estimated at CNY189 million.  \nB.   Poverty Analysis                                                Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention\nA poverty and social analysis was undertaken in line with Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines to collect detailed \nsocial information necessary to inform project design, and identify poverty reduction and social development objectives, \noutcomes, and indicators. The analysis identifies vulnerable groups and opportunities for pro-poor interventions, and \nrecommends  social  action  measures,  participation,  and  mitigation  plans  to  achieve  positive  social  benefits.  The \ncharacteristics of low-income or vulnerable households in the project area are (i) where the head of the household is a long-\nterm, laid-off former state-owned-enterprise worker, often with children of school age; (ii) households headed by women; (iii) \nhouseholds containing one or more disabled or chronically sick person; and (iv) members are part of the floating population, \nusually from rural areas and living in poor conditions. \nThe major social measures to protect urban residents from falling into poverty include (i) a living allowance for laid-off \nemployees, (ii) unemployment insurance, and (iii) a social support program under the minimum living standard scheme. \nFurther, the Changchun municipal government (CMG) and Yanji municipal government (YMG) have agreed to implement \npoverty reduction1 measures including (i) lifeline tariffs, (ii) water bill discounts or cash rebates amounting to 50% of the \nmonthly water bill for households living below the poverty line, and (iii) connections for the poorest households to tap water in \nChangchun and Yanji. The Project will promote public awareness and education programs about project benefits, public \nhygiene, and consumer behavior on water saving and managing wastewater disposal. \nThe Project will support poverty reduction by (i) providing safer and more reliable urban water supply, (ii) improving the \nnatural environment by increased wastewater treatment and improved solid-waste management, (iii) reducing morbidity due \nto decreased exposure to waterborne diseases, (iv) reducing the risk of contracting respiratory diseases by improving the \ncentral heating system, and (v) providing employment opportunities for the poor. The Project will create 3,880 full time jobs \nduring construction, generating about CNY48 million in wages per year. The poor and women will fill half of these jobs. \nProject operations will create 810 full-time permanent jobs directly, generating about CNY11.56 million in wages per year. \nProject-related services, such as procurement of construction materials and equipment, and follow-on multiplier effects will \ncreate an additional 5,000 jobs. \nC.  Participation Process\nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes                 No\nStakeholder analysis has been conducted during the poverty and social assessment. The primary stakeholders of the Project \narea are urban residents, the floating population, affected persons, industries and businesses, the executing agency (EA) \n                                                \n1 The technical assistance study (i) defined poverty levels used in the analysis, (ii) assessed and provided an income and \nexpenditure profile of poor households based on a household survey of 500 households, (iii) evaluated and recommended \nmeasures to alleviate the impacts of increased water and wastewater tariffs on the poor, and (iv) assessed the positive \nimpacts of the Project on the poor and low-income beneficiaries.  ", "Appendix 9  51 \nand implementing agencies (IAs); secondary stakeholders of the Project include relevant government agencies, such as the \nCivil Affairs Bureau, Poverty Reduction Office, Health Bureau, and All Women\u2019s Federations. During the Project design, a \nhousehold survey of 1,500 households was conducted. The participatory approaches for the poverty and social impact \nassessment included stakeholder consultation workshops, focus-group discussions, and key informant interviews, and these \nwere used to gain a better understanding of the demands, needs, and interests of the stakeholders.  \nThree rounds of public consultations in the project areas were carried out to prepare the environmental impact assessment \n(EIA) and the resettlement plans. The public consultations and information disclosure included (i) introducing the Project \ncomponents to the stakeholders; (ii) soliciting ideas, suggestions, comments, concerns, and critiques on the potential \nenvironmental implications of the Project; and (iii) presenting the findings of the EIA and resettlement plans, summarizing \npotential environmental impacts and mitigation measures, and providing answers raised by workshop participants. Public \nconsultations and information disclosure of resettlement plans were conducted during surveys, community meetings, \ninterviews, and workshops. The results of these meetings and the concerns of the affected persons, particularly the poor and \nwomen, were integrated into the resettlement plans, which also describe the public consultation plan and grievance process. \nIs there a participation strategy?    Yes                  No \nPublic consultation and participation have been the core element of the project design and will continue during the project \nimplementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Ongoing consultations will also be carried out by the IAs to understand and \nmeet the evolving needs and expectations of the users as well as increase the awareness of the public, especially the \nbeneficiaries, about the benefits of the Project, and encourage the active involvement of local communities to maximize their \nsupport to the Project, promote environmental protection, and raise the social acceptance of tariff increases. Public \nconsultations will be held during the project implementation to discuss and obtain feedback on tariff adjustments and \naffordability for consumers and other key stakeholders, particularly the poor. Existing participatory policies that rely on public\nhearings to gain approval for tariff adjustments will provide the mechanism for these consultations. The public consultation \nand participation will be carried out throughout the whole process of the EIA and environmental management plan \nimplementation. The consultations, including a grievance mechanism, will continue during land acquisition and resettlement \nso that the problems and needs of affected persons are properly addressed in a timely manner before the project \nimplementation. \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nResults from the household surveys and focus-group discussions indicate that women are primarily responsible for collection \nof  household  water,  wastewater  disposal  and  management,  household  garbage  disposal  and  management,  heating \nprovision, and care for the sick and elders. Time and efforts spent on these activities will reduce the time available for \nwomen to engage in income-generating activities, family entertainment, or leisure. The poverty and social assessment \nindicated that women strongly support the Project. Women have perceived that the Project will improve the urban living \nenvironment, create employment opportunities, and reduce the incidence of waterborne and airborne diseases. To maximize \nthe project benefits, women will be given priority in the employment and training opportunities generated from the project \nconstruction and operation phases. A proactive employment program for women will be adopted by the IAs. Over 20% of the \nemployment opportunities will be filled by women during the project construction phase and 20% during the operation phase. \nHas an output been prepared?  Yes No\nE.

The affected \nworkers will not be financially worse off than they would \nhave  been  in  the  absence  of  the  Project.  The  Jilin \nprovincial government (JPG) will ensure that no job and \nincome losses occur. \nIndigenous  Significant  There is a large Korean ethnic group (60% of the Yanji \nPeoples population) in Yanji. Koreans are the dominant cultural   Yes \n Not significant  and economic group in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous \nPrefecture.

The Korean language is common \nin  the  workplace,  including  local  government  offices. \nKorean is taught in schools and Korean newspapers are \nwidely available. The Korean community maintains close \neconomic ties with the Republic of Korea, and officials \nwith  the  Civil  Affairs  Bureau  consider  the  Korean \ncommunity to be somewhat better off economically than \nother  groups.  In  Changchun,  96.5%  of  the  targeted \npopulation belongs to the Han ethnic group while other \nethnic  groups  have  similar  customs  and  economic \nactivities.  The  minority  people  will  benefit  from  the \nincreased  and  improved  urban  infrastructure  facilities \nand services. \nProject land acquisition and resettlement has affected, or \nwill affect, 22 Korean households (51 persons). However, \nthey are much better off than their income could have \nseveral times increase as they have used or will use the \ncompensation payment from land acquisition to make \narrangements to get employment in Korea or invest in \nsmall  businesses. As a result, there are no negative \nimpacts  on  them  due  to  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement.  If  any  negative  impact  on  minority \npopulations  is  identified  during  the  Project \nimplementation, special policies and considerations will \nbe provided to them in line with the Chinese policies on \nminority people and the ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies. \nOther Risks and/or   Significant  Health  and  safety  training  will  be  provided  to  the   Yes \nVulnerabilities construction workers.

", "Appendix 10  53 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \nA.    Introduction \n1.  The financial analysis was prepared in accordance with the Financial Management and \nAnalysis  of  Projects  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).1  An  assessment  of  financial \nperformance was completed for the implementing agencies (IAs) that operate as enterprises. \nThe financial analysis of the Project is completed for those IAs that will operate revenue-\ngenerating project components. The analysis determines the level of cost recovery that is \nrequired to service the ADB loan and achieve financial health. \n2.  The financial evaluations of project components were carried out in real terms using \n2007 prices. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was determined using incremental \nannual  cash  flows  over  25  years  of  operations.  The  residual  value  of  physical  assets  is \nassumed to equal its remaining book or depreciated value at the end of the evaluation period. \nThe evaluation was carried out for the project components and the combination of project \ncomponents that feature cost recovery through tariffs. All cost and revenue projections were \nprepared using a pro forma financial modeling approach. \nB.    Historical Tariffs In Changchun and Yanji \n3.  An  effective  tariff  mechanism  is  needed  to  ensure  sufficient  contributions  from \nbeneficiaries to support operation and maintenance (O&M) and to  finance overhead costs \nincluding debt servicing. In addition, it is necessary to ensure adequate and timely provision of \ncounterpart funds during project implementation. In accordance with the central government\u2019s \npolicies, all local governments are expected to charge reasonable fees for sewage treatment. In \nprinciple, water and wastewater tariffs should be established based on the cost of operating \nfacilities and the affordability by consumers. In cities where profitability is not possible, local \ngovernments are encouraged to set a minimum wastewater tariff that can cover O&M costs.  \n4. Water and Wastewater Tariff in Changchun.

", "54 Appendix 10 \nChangchun municipal government (CMG) introduced a new tariff system on urban solid-waste \ncollection on 26 September 2005. According to the new system, each urban household is \ncharged CNY7 per month and public establishments is charged CNY44 per ton for solid-waste \ndisposal. The new tariff system was effective on 1 October 2005. \n6. Water  and  Wastewater  Tariff  in  Yanji.  A  wastewater  tariff,  approved  by  the  Jilin \nprovincial government (JPG), was introduced in Yanji in 2000. The Yanji municipal government \n(YMG) increased the wastewater tariff in 2003 and 2006 after holding public meetings and \nreceiving required approvals. The current wastewater tariff is CNY0.40 per cubic meter (m3) for \ndomestic users, CNY 0.80 per m3 for public institutions and industries, and CNY1.60 per m3 for \nspecial industries (Table A10.2). The wastewater tariff is levied and collected based on the \nwater sold.  \nTable A10.2.

Heating Tariff in Yanji. The heating tariff in Yanji increased from CNY22 per square \nmeter (m2) to CNY26 per m2for residential apartments, CNY30 per m2 for schools, and CNY35 \nper m2 for commercial premises, industries, and public institutions on 1 October 2005.  \nC.    Major Assumptions   \n8.  A  value-added  tax  rate  of  6%  is  applied  to  the  sales  revenue;  sales  taxes  and \nsurcharges of a total of 10% on top of the value-added tax are also levied. An income tax rate of \n25% is used in the financial analysis for all the subprojects, except the ones with solid-waste \nand wastewater management components, for which an income tax rate of 15% is used. \n9.  Annual average depreciation costs have been computed at 4.17% of the book value of \nfixed assets at the end of the implementation period for each subproject until the net book value \nof fixed assets becomes zero after 24 years of operation. An amortization rate of 8% is applied \nto the original book value of the total intangible assets and deferred assts. The depreciation and ", "Appendix 10  55 \namortization costs are calculated based on the items\u2019 book values in nominal terms at the end \nof  the  implementation  period  in  accordance  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China\u2019s  (PRC) \naccounting  standards.  Costs  of  consumables,  electricity,  and  other  expenses  are  adjusted \nannually according to the proposed capacity-utilization rate. All O&M costs are calculated in \nnominal terms in financial statement projections, adjusted by the local inflation rates projected \nby ADB. The O&M costs are calculated in real terms in the discounted cash flow analyses.  \n10.  In  the  financial  statement  projections,  loans  to  be  obtained  from  ADB  and  local \ncommercial banks are included as debt. The balance of the total investment to be financed by \nthe government is included as equity injection. The proposed ADB loan has a 25-year term, \nincluding a 5-year grace period. The interest rate will be based on the London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR) plus a spread. As of 17 May 2007, the 6-month LIBOR was 5.36%, and the 5-year \nfixed swap rate was 5.11%. By adding 60 base points to the 5-year fixed swap rate, the \nexpected interest rate of the ADB loan will be 5.71%. The commitment fee is assumed to be \n0.35% and the front end fee is assumed to be waived.2 The cost of local bank loans is 7.20% \nand the opportunity cost of equity is assumed to be 8.00% in accordance with the government\u2019s \nguidelines and the equity cost used in similar ADB projects in the PRC. ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nFinancial Governance and Management of Investment Projects specify that the appropriate \ndiscount rate for discounted cash flow analyses is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), \nwhich represents the cost incurred by the project entity in raising the capital to implement a \nproject. The WACC for the Project as a whole was calculated as 3.52% (Table A10.3). \nTable A10.3.

Financial Internal Rate of Return \n11.  The  after-tax  FIRR  for  the  overall  Project  is  estimated  at  9.0%  for  the  base-case \nscenario and varies between 6.61% and 11.51% for the project subcomponents. These returns \ncompare favorably to the WACC of 3.52%. The sensitivity analysis tests the following three \nscenarios: (i) project costs increase by 10%, (ii) O&M costs increase by 10%, and (iii) revenue \nreduces by 10% due to delay of tariff adjustments. The resulting financial internal rates of return \nfor the three scenarios are 7.93% for scenario (i), 7.04% for scenario (ii), and 5.74% for \nscenario  (iii).  The  sensitivity  analysis  suggests  that  tariff  reform  and  improved  financial \nmanagement, particularly cost control, are the most important factors to assure a successful \nproject  outcome.  JPG,  CMG,  and  YMG  have  confirmed  that  the  government  plans  to \nprogressively  increase  water  and  wastewater  tariffs,  introduce  a  solid-waste  tariff,  and \nstrengthen tariff collections in both project cities. Suitable assurances from the government are \nincluded in the loan document to ensure tariff reforms in the project cities. \n                                                \n2  Based on 1% waiver of the entire front-end fee on all new sovereign loans approved by the ADB Board of Directors \nfrom 1 July 2007 up to and including 30 June 2008.

The economic analysis covers project justification, general parameters for economic \nanalysis,  project  costs  and  benefits,  least-cost  analysis,  and  calculations  of  the  economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR).  The  EIRR  is  calculated  for  each  of  the  Project\u2019s  seven \nsubcomponents (Table A11.1) and for the Project as a whole. \nTable A11.1: Served Districts and Primary Benefits of Project Subcomponents \nSubcomponent  Districts Served  Nature of Benefits \nA.

Project Justification \n2.  Many  cities  in  Jilin  province  experience  widespread  pollution  because  of  (i)  the \ndischarge  of  untreated  wastewater,  (ii)  improper  management  of  solid  waste,  and  (iii)  the \ninefficient burning of coal for heating. Meanwhile, shortages of safe drinking water are common. \nThe central government has classified more than 300 cities as \u201cwater short,\u201d 108 as having \nserious water problems, and more than 60 as being critically short of water. Changchun city is \nincluded in the list of cities that are critically short of water. Sustainable development requires \nthat  Jilin  province  strengthens  its  capacity  to  manage  its  utility  services  to  (i)  formulate \nintegrated urban plans, and (ii) monitor and enforce environmental regulations.  \n3.  The Project comprises water supply and wastewater management in Changchun and \nYanji,  domestic  solid-waste  management  in  Changchun,  and  central  heating  in  Yanji.  The \nProject  will  help  improve  the  urban  environment  and  achieve  long-term  sustainable \ndevelopment  in  Changchun  and Yanji  by  (i)  enhancing  the  quality  of  water  resources;  (ii) \nstrengthening  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  domestic  solid-waste  management;  and  (iii) \nimproving urban air quality. In the project design, alternative locations and specifications for the ", "Appendix 11  57 \nwastewater treatment plants, sewer networks, water treatment plants, pumping stations, solid-\nwaste landfills, and central heating networks were considered. \nC.   General Parameters \n4.   The economic analysis was conducted by comparing situations with-project and without-\nproject. The study period covers 25 years including 5 years of construction from 2007 to 2011. \nEconomic benefits and costs are denominated in domestic price numeraire and expressed in \nconstant 2007 prices. Tradable components are converted to economic prices using a shadow \nexchange rate of 1.013, and nontradable components are valued at domestic market prices. A \nshadow  wage  rate  of  0.8  was  applied  to  the  wage  of  unskilled  labor  to  account  for \nunemployment and underemployment. \nD.   Costs \n5.   Project costs include capital investment costs and operation and maintenance (O&M) \ncosts. Costs were allocated to tradable and nontradable goods and services, and skilled and \nunskilled labor. Appropriate conversion factors (shadow exchange rate and shadow wage rate) \nwere applied accordingly. Transfer payments, including taxes and interests, are excluded from \nthe economic costs, while physical contingencies are included.\nE.  Project Benefits \n6.  The Project is expected to benefit 3.6 million urban residents (3.2 million in Changchun \nand 0.40 million in Yanji). The Project\u2019s primary benefits will include (i) improved wastewater \ncollection and treatment services for about 300,000 people in Changchun and 26,300 people in \nYanji, (ii) provision of an alternative low-cost supply of water to industrial users in Yanji through \nthe reuse of treated wastewater effluent, (iii) reduced coal consumption and environmental costs \ndue to reduced air pollutant emissions in Yanji, (iv) improved water supply treatment and \ndistribution services for about 1.2 million people in Changchun and 118,800 people in Yanji, (v) \nimproved solid-waste collection and treatment in Changchun, and (vi) human health benefits \nsuch as reductions in morbidity and mortality due to airborne and waterborne diseases.  \n7.   Benefits associated with the improved water supply treatment and distribution services in \nChangchun  and  Yanji  include  (i)  the  provision  of  24-hour  service  in  the  areas  currently \nexperiencing interrupted service, (ii) increased water pressure in the distribution systems, (iii) \nimproved drinking water quality, (iv) reduced risk of exposure to waterborne pathogens in the \ntap water, and (v) reduced water leakage. Indirect benefits for domestic beneficiaries include the \nelimination of financial costs incurred to cope with the interrupted water supply service and a \ngeneral enhancement of the life quality.  \n8.  The impacts associated with the improvements in wastewater collection and treatment \ninclude  (i)  reduced  discharge  of  untreated  wastewater  into  the  river  streams,  (ii)  reduced \nfrequency of acute surface water contaminations, and (iii) reduced hydraulic loading of treated \nwastewater effluent to the receiving streams. Benefits that are derived from these impacts \ninclude (i) improved aquatic environment in local river systems, (ii) reduced risk of human and \nlivestock exposure to waterborne pathogens, (iii) reduced transboundary aquatic pollution, and \n(iv) improved drinking water supplies in Changchun and Yanji.  \n9.  Benefits of the central heating component will result primarily from (i) more efficient heat \nproduction than using the existing small boilers and (ii) the reduction in environmental costs due ", "58 Appendix 11\nto reduced air pollution from the boilers. The proposed central heating systems will significantly \nimprove  the  air  quality  in  Yanji  during  winter  by  reducing  emissions  of  air  pollutants  and \ndispersing the remaining waste gas through tall chimneys. \n10.  For  solid-waste  management,  the  existing  landfill  of  Changchun  will  be  filled  in  18 \nmonths, although the period can be extended somewhat if necessary. Construction of a new \ndomestic solid-waste treatment facility is urgently needed. The benefits associated with the \nsolid-waste management component are primarily derived from the improved local environment \nand reduced pollution. \n11.   Benefits  of  all  the  project  components  are  calculated  using  a  willingness  to  pay \napproach. Estimation of the willingness to pay uses the contingent valuation method, which has \nbeen widely used in environmental and natural-resource valuations. The contingent valuation \nmethod uses survey techniques to elicit individuals\u2019 willingness to pay for the hypothetical \nprovision of a public good or willingness to accept compensation for a hypothetical loss. These \nmonetary values are then aggregated and used in cost-benefit analyses of public interventions \nthat potentially increase social welfare. A two-stage regression with a special treatment of zero \nresponses in the survey is conducted. The regression results for this Project indicate that the \nwillingness to pay for wastewater treatment is CNY0.85 per ton, for water supply CNY3.50 per \nton (CNY2.50 per ton for Yanji), and for central heating CNY30 per square meter (m2) of \nbuilding area per heating season. \nF.  Least-Cost Analysis \n12.  The least-cost analysis uses two methods: (i) the lowest average incremental economic \ncost approach is used for the components where there is a measurable output, such as the \nYanji Water Treatment Plant and Yanji Effluent Reuse Plant subcomponents; and (ii) the lowest \npresent value of economic cost approach is used for the subcomponents of water supply and \nsewer networks construction and upgrade, where a measurable output is unavailable. All costs \nand outputs are derived from a with-project and without-project comparison, and discounted at \nthe economic discount rate of 12%. The least cost conclusions are indicated below. \n(i)  For  the  landfill  location,  the  Mogugou  option  is  found  to  be  cost  effective \ncompared to the Fufengshan option. \n(ii)  For the solid-waste treatment process, the landfill process is found to be better \nthan the fired mixed landfill process. \n(iii)  For the tertiary wastewater treatment, the filtration pitcher process is found to be \ncost effective compared to the filtration tank process. \n(iv)  For pipe materials, the least-cost analysis confirms the reinforced concrete pipe \nas a recommended option against the HDPE pipe. \n(v)  For the water transmission pipeline layout routine, the preferred option is the \npipeline from the Yanji River, compared to the pipeline from the Chaoyang River. \n(vi)  For the water transmission pipe material, the cast-iron pipe is marginally better \nthan the PCCP pipe. \nG.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n13.  The EIRR is calculated for each Project subcomponent (Tables A11.2 to A11.5) and for \nthe whole Project (Table A11.6). The EIRR ranges from 15.8% to 28.0% for subcomponents \nand 23.7% for the whole Project. Sensitivity analysis shows that the EIRR for the whole Project \nwill decrease to (i) 21.4% if the Project experiences a capital cost overrun of 10%, (ii) 20.5% if ", "Appendix 11  59 \nthe Project experiences an O&M cost overrun of 20%, (iii) 19.1% if the Project benefits are \nreduced by 10%, (iv) 21% if the Project experiences a commissioning delay of 1 year, and \n(v) 13.6% if (i), (ii), and (iii) all happen together. A risk analysis based on 1000 Monte Carlo \nsimulations shows that the probability of the EIRR being below 12% is less than 5%. The \nfinancial  analysis  (Appendix  10)  of  the  Project\u2019s  six  revenue-generating  subcomponents \nindicates that all of them will be financially viable and sustainable. The Government, through its \ngeneral  budget,  will  provide  subsidies  to  the  implementation  agencies  of  the  nonrevenue-\ngenerating subcomponents to cover their O&M costs.  \nTable A11.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return of Wastewater  \nTreatment Subcomponents \nNPV EIRR\nSubcomponent\n(CNY million)  (%) \nChangchun Dongnan WWTP and Sewage Networks  240  22.0 \nYanji Effluent Reuse and Sewage Networks Upgrade and \n90  21.3 \nExpansion \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, WWTP = wastewater treatment plant. \nSource: Asian Development Bank project preparatory technical assistance staff estimates. \nTable A11.3: Economic Internal Rate of Return of Water Supply Subcomponents \nNPV EIRR\nSubcomponent\n(CNY million)  (%)\nYanji WTP and Networks Upgrade and Expansion  169  27.0 \nChangchun WTP No. 5 and Networks 658  23.7 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, WWTP = wastewater treatment plant. \nSource: Asian Development Bank project preparatory technical assistance staff estimates. \nTable A11.4: Economic Internal Rate of Return of Central Heating Subcomponents \nNPV EIRR\nSubcomponent\n(CNY million)  (%)\nYanji Heating Plant Secondary Heating Networks 105  24.4 \nYanji Thermal Power Plant Heating Networks 473  28.0 \nNPV = net present value, EIRR = economic internal rate of return.   \nSource: Asian Development Bank project preparatory technical assistance staff estimates. \nTable A11.5: Economic Internal Rate of Return of Solid-Waste \nManagement Subcomponent \nNPV EIRR\nSubcomponent \n(CNY million)  (%)\nChangchun Solid-Waste Management 41  15.8 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank project preparatory technical assistance staff estimates.

Distribution Analysis andPoverty Impact Indicator \n14.  As a result of the Project, some stakeholders lose and others gain. At a discount rate of \n12%, the economy will gain CNY139.7 million, which is mainly from income taxes (Table A11.7). \nLaborers will gain CNY10.3 million because the Project pays wages in excess of the economic \nopportunity cost of labor. Consumers will gain CNY3,233.5 million because they can avail \nthemselves of increased quantities of water, wastewater treated, and heating at a lower cost \nthan without the Project.
