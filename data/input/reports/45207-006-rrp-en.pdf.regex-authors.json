THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the additional financing of the Irrigation Management \nImprovement Project. \n \n2.  The proposed additional financing will cover cost overruns of the ongoing project.1 The \nongoing project is modernizing the Muhuri Irrigation Project in Feni district in Chattogram division \nand strengthening the capacity of Bangladesh to improve national practices on sustainable \nmanagement, operation, and maintenance (MOM) of its large-scale irrigation schemes. The \nproject is critical from a climate change adaptation perspective as it significantly increases flood \nrisk protection for productive land and assures irrigation water supply during lean periods. While \nintroducing  innovative  infrastructure  modernization,  it  also  aims  to  foster  private  sector \nparticipation in water sector by transferring MOM responsibilities from government departments \nto private operators.   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The primary sources of water in Bangladesh are local rainfall and transboundary inflows, \nderived mainly from the Brahmaputra, Ganges, and Meghna rivers. Bangladesh occupies only \n8% of the total catchment area of these rivers and is located at their downstream end. The result \nis an abundant excess of surface water during the summer monsoon months and water shortfalls \nduring the winter dry months. Despite being scarce, water is not well-managed. Minimal attention \nis given to water use efficiency and equitable allocation. Many farmers rely on groundwater to \nsupplement the limited and irregular surface water supplies. However, in many areas, the use of \ngroundwater  is  significantly  constrained  by  arsenic  contamination  and  aquifer  limitations. \nConsequently, the minimum flows required to meet total dry season demands are less than what \nis available from surface and groundwater.  The performance of irrigation schemes will be further \naggravated by the impact of climate change for which changes in temperature and rainfall patterns \nwill modify crop irrigation requirements and river hydrologic regimes. \n \n4.  Although agriculture\u2019s share of gross domestic product has declined, it is still the primary \neconomic sector in rural areas and provides more than 60% of rural employment in Bangladesh. \nWomen constitute 50% of the labor force in the agriculture sector but, because of the informal \nnature of work and cultural barriers, paid employment opportunities in the sector are still low for \nwomen. Irrigated agriculture productivity remains low, which is the result of unreliable irrigation \nsupply; inadequate agriculture extension services; and poor access to farm inputs, markets, and \nagricultural credit services. The lack of efficient and sustainable MOM continues to impact the \nproductivity of large irrigation schemes.2 Other factors include inadequate government financing \nfor maintenance, lack of beneficiary empowerment and engagement in MOM, and limited capacity \nof public agencies resulting in weak service delivery. \n \n5.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the ongoing project on 30 June 2014 to \nincrease the productivity and sustainability of the Muhuri Irrigation Project. The ongoing project \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2014. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Irrigation Management Improvement Project. Manila. \nADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for preparing the Irrigation Management Improvement \nInvestment Program (TA 8154-BAN). \n2  Large irrigation schemes have command areas of 2,000 hectares (ha) or more. \n \n ", "2 \nsupports the government efforts to address the recurrent lack of MOM and increase water \nproductivity.3 It aims to achieve these objectives by transferring the MOM of the Muhuri Irrigation \nProject to private operators and introducing innovative infrastructure modernization, such as \nreplacing diesel motor pumps with electric pumps, developing highly efficient buried-pipe tertiary \ndistribution systems, and installing prepaid card meter systems.4 It also finances the feasibility \nstudies and detailed designs for modernizing the Ganges\u2013Kobadak Irrigation Project in Khulna \ndivision and the Teesta Barrage Irrigation Project in Rangpur division. In all cases, the ongoing \nproject improves Bangladesh\u2019s resilience to climate change by demonstrating improved flood \nprotection,  reservoir  management,  and  water  use  efficiency  within  irrigation  schemes.  The \napproved loan totaled SDR29.6 million, equivalent to $46.0 million at the time of approval. The \nrevised loan closing date of the ongoing project is 30 June 2022.5 \n \n6.  Performance of the ongoing project. The ongoing project is performing well. It is rated \non track and, as of 30 June 2021, had achieved $38.67 million in contract awards against a target \nof $39.98 million (97%) and $32.17 million in disbursements against a target of $29.76 million \n(108%). The ongoing project is also on track to achieving the project outputs and outcome. \nCompliance with safeguard policy requirements for the ongoing project is proceeding satisfactorily. \nHowever, a social safeguards compliance issue was identified because of the failure to negotiate a \nsettlement resulting in land being acquired in 2020. The Bangladesh Water Development Board \n(BWDB) undertook necessary due diligence and prepared a resettlement plan that was accepted by \nADB and has been implemented. All risks detailed in the risk assessment and risk management plan \nare being managed successfully.6 \n \n(i)  Output 1: Irrigation management and agriculture support services improved. \nIn  terms  of  physical  achievements,  output  1  activities  are  underway.  The \nconstruction-phase  irrigation  management  operator  (C-IMO)  for  the  Muhuri \nIrrigation Project was recruited under a performance-based management contract. \nThe C-IMO has completed the designs and bid documents for the Muhuri Irrigation \nProject works and is now supervising construction activities. The C-IMO has also \nestablished sustainable MOM practices for the completed modernized sections of \nthe Muhuri Irrigation Project, and is providing agriculture support to beneficiary \nfarmers. The project completed 35 training sessions on more productive irrigated \nagriculture  that  benefited  1,391  farmers,  including  286  female  farmers. \nRecruitment  of  the  long-term  post-project  management-phase  irrigation \nmanagement  operator  (M-IMO)  will  begin  after  the  C-IMO\u2019s  performance \nassessment has been completed. The BWDB is targeting mobilizing the M-IMO by \nthe end of 2022. \n(ii)  Output  2:  Irrigation  system  infrastructure  rehabilitated  and  modernized. \nActivities to modernize irrigation infrastructure have experienced some delays \nbecause of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, and will be completed \nby June 2023. About 17 kilometers of coastal embankments have been repaired \nor  resectioned  and  373  kilometers  of  canal  drains  re-excavated.  The \nmodernization of the tertiary-level water distribution system is ongoing. Out of the \n850 low-lift electrical pump schemes with prepaid card meters planned in the \n \n3  Water productivity is defined as crop yield or dollars per cubic meter of water consumed or, more popularly, \u201ccrop \nper drop.\u201d \n4  Modernization is the process of upgrading infrastructure, operation, and management of irrigation systems to sustain \nthe water delivery service requirements of farmers, and optimize production and water productivity. \n5  The original closing date of the ongoing project is 31 December 2021. A 1.5-year extension was approved on 2 \nNovember 2018. \n6  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "3 \nproject, 81 schemes have been commissioned. Works are ongoing in about 590 \nschemes  which  are  expected  to  be  commissioned  by  June  2022,  and  the \nremaining schemes by June 2023. The project generated construction jobs for men \nand women as unskilled workers. Female labor-days account for 3% of total labor-\ndays so far. To date, no women have been recruited as pump operators or water \nunit vendors of the schemes. \n(iii)  Output 3: Project efficiently managed with effective institutional development.7 \nProject  management  and  institutional  development  activities  are  ongoing.  The \ninstitutional  support  to  the  BWDB  and  water  management  organizations  to \nsuccessfully administer and support public\u2013private partnership (PPP) contracts will be \ncompleted by the end of 2022 when the M-IMO is contracted. A project performance \nmonitoring  system,  including  a  sex-disaggregated  database  and  management \ninformation system, has been developed and is currently being used by the project \nmanagement unit and its implementing units. \n \n7.  Reason for additional financing. The additional financing will finance cost overruns \nexperienced across outputs 1 and 2 of the ongoing project that have been caused by the following: \n(i)  Higher bid price than cost estimate at project preparation. The bid prices of \nthe tertiary system modernization works packages under output 2 were about $6.8 \nmillion (40%) higher than the engineer\u2019s estimate. The reasons were (a) the limited \ncompetition within the project area and complexity of the works, and (b) the long \ndelays in tendering and awarding these works contracts. The procurement time for \nthese packages was on average 300 days, with a maximum of 530 days. The \ndelays were compounded by high inflation rates, varying between 5.5% and 7.5% \nper annum, which led the government to revise its official schedule of rates for civil \nworks with forecast annual increases of 8.0%\u201312.0%, which is higher than the \n7.5%\u20138.5% estimated at project approval. \n(ii)  Increase in contract quantities. The quantities and cost for the electrification \nworks associated with the low-lift pumps have increased to include an 11/33 \nkilovolt secondary substation. As agreed during project preparation, this substation \nwas to be installed and financed by the Rural Electrification Board. However, \nbecause of lack of funds, the board has not been able to fulfill its commitment. In \naddition, after completion of the topographic survey and detailed reconnaissance, \nit was realized that the modernization of the Muhuri Irrigation Project command \narea could be extended. Modernization of the tertiary system has increased to \n18,000 hectares (ha) from the 17,000 ha estimated during project preparation. \nThese increases in contract quantities resulted in an overall cost increase of $3.8 \nmillion. \n(iii)  Additional  provisions. The additional financing will also  provide about $5.3 \nmillion to cover price adjustments on civil works contracts and the extension of the \nC-IMO contract by 2.5 years up to the extended loan completion date. \n(iv)  Special drawing right depreciation against the dollar. The special drawing right \nhas depreciated significantly  against the dollar. When the ongoing loan was \napproved, the loan amount of SDR29.55 million was equivalent to $46.00 million, \nbut as of 6 April 2021 it was only equivalent to $41.53 million. \n \n \n7  Output 3 of the ongoing loan\u2019s original design and monitoring framework  has been reclassified as \u201cproject \nmanagement activities,\u201d in line with ADB. 2020. Guidelines for Preparing and Using a Design and Monitoring \nFramework: Sovereign Operations and Technical Assistance. Manila. \n \n ", "4 \n8.  Eligibility criteria for additional financing. The additional financing meets the eligibility \ncriteria for additional financing because the overall project (i) remains technically feasible and \neconomically viable with an updated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 15.4%; (ii) \nagricultural growth is accorded high priority in the government\u2019s Eighth Five-Year Plan (FY2020\u2013\nFY2025);8 (iii) is consistent with the project\u2019s development objectives; and (iv) is consistent with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Bangladesh, 2021\u20132025, which prioritizes acceleration of \nrural transformation and modernization of agriculture by creating conditions for (i) integrated and \nstrategic water resource management, (ii) increased productivity of agriculture, (iii) sustainable \nO&M, (iv) private sector participation, and (v) climate- and disaster-resilient infrastructure and \nservices.9 \n \n9.  Suitability of using additional financing. Additional financing is the most appropriate \nmodality to fund the cost overruns to complete the project in the most efficient way. The overall \nproject will be completed within the ongoing project\u2019s extended completion date. The ongoing \nproject\u2019s implementing arrangements will be maintained to ensure a high degree of readiness for \nthe additional financing. \n \n10.  Relevance to post-pandemic recovery. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe and \npersistent impact on Bangladesh\u2019s population and economy. The project will provide much-\nneeded support for the long-term growth prospects of the economy, particularly in providing \nemployment and income opportunities in rural communities. Infrastructure spending on irrigation \nsystems modernization will increase farmers\u2019 incomes and provide job opportunities for the most \nvulnerable. Improved irrigation services will help farmers increase crop production, contributing \nto enhanced food and nutritional security, which are important for post-COVID-19 pandemic \nrecovery. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n11.  The overall project\u2019s impact and outcome remain unchanged. The project is aligned with \nthe following impact: high growth of agriculture in Bangladesh sustained.10 The overall project will \nhave  the  following  outcome:  productivity  and  sustainability  of  the  Muhuri  Irrigation  Project \nincreased. However, the following outcome and output indicators were adjusted: (i) command \narea  increased from  17,000  ha  to  18,000  ha, and  the  number  of  low-lift  electrical  pumps \ninstallation increased accordingly; (ii) scope of embankment and canal rehabilitation was reduced \nbased on actual need; and (iii) gender targets were reduced to reflect the realities in the project \narea.11 \n \n12.  The project is aligned with ADB Strategy 2030 operational priorities on (i) addressing \nremaining poverty and reducing inequalities, by improving irrigation infrastructure to benefit \nsmallholder farmers; (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality, through the involvement of \nwomen as part of the construction and MOM workforce; (iii) tackling climate change, building \nclimate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability, by switching to more \nefficient electric pumps from diesel pumps; (iv) promoting rural development and food security, \nthrough modernizing the irrigation systems on 18,000 ha of farmlands; and (v) strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity, by promoting a PPP model for the sustainable MOM of \n \n8  Government of Bangladesh. 2020.

Manila. \n10 The impact statement of the ongoing project remains aligned with the government\u2019s Eighth Five-Year Plan (footnote 8). \n11 The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "5 \nlarge irrigation schemes.12 The additional financing is included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan for Bangladesh, 2021\u20132023.13 \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n13.  In  2009,  ADB  provided  technical  assistance  to  the  BWDB  to  examine  alternative \napproaches  to  service  delivery  agreements  and  management  arrangements,  and  it \nrecommended the use of PPPs for sustainable MOM in large irrigation schemes.14 The project \npreparatory technical assistance proposed a conceptual framework for engaging a third-party \noperator to address the shortcomings in MOM in the Muhuri Irrigation Project. \n \n14.  During preparation of the ongoing project, ADB supported the BWDB and the water users\u2019 \nassociations in building a consensus on a suitable PPP model for the Muhuri Irrigation Project \nand appropriate MOM financing modalities, including irrigation service delivery tariff structures \nand approval principles. ADB assessed the social and economic feasibility of the approach and \nconfirmed farmers\u2019 willingness to pay for improved irrigation service delivery. ADB also supported \nthe BWDB in developing a performance-based management contract and recruiting a private firm \nas the C-IMO. Before the end of the project implementation period, ADB will support the BWDB \nwith an assessment of the C-IMO's performance and recruitment of the longer-term M-IMO. \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s value addition also includes assuring replication and upscaling of the ongoing \nproject  by  financing  the  preparation  of  modernization  strategies  for  the  Ganges\u2013Kobadak \nIrrigation Project and the Teesta Barrage Irrigation Project, including preparing their feasibility \nstudies and detailed designs. These two major irrigation schemes have a combined command \narea of 875,000 ha and the modernization strategies  include (i) guaranteed and equitable \nirrigation supply to all parts of the scheme throughout the year; (ii) environmentally sound and \nsustainable use of water; (iii) establishment of a strong and effective irrigation management \norganization with private sector participation; (iv) support for new technologies (supervisory \ncontrol and data acquisition, canal automation, and smart meters) and initiatives to reduce costs \nand increase agricultural returns including addressing issues of inequity, poverty, and gender \nissues; and (v) establishment of effective and sustainable systems of cost recovery to meet \noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n16.  The overall project is estimated to cost $68.13 million, with $14.63 million provided through \nthis additional financing (Table 1).

These are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the updated PAM. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  November 2021\u2013June 2023 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2023 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 December 2023 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project steering committee  \nMinistry of Water Resources secretary (chair) \nMinistry of Agriculture; Ministry of Local Government Rural Development \nand Cooperatives; Ministry of Environment and Forests, Economic \nRelations Division, Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division; \nPlanning Commission; Bangladesh Water Development Board; \nDepartment of Agriculture Extension; Ministry of Fisheries and \nLivestock; and a representative of ADB  \n(ii)  Executing agency  Bangladesh Water Development Board \n(iii) Key implementing  Project management unit in Dhaka \nagencies \n(iv) Implementation unit  Project implementation unit in the Muhuri Irrigation Project \nProcurement  None for the additional financing \nConsulting services  None for the additional financing \nRetroactive financing  Not applicable \nand/or advance contracting \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: ADB. \n \n20.  Project readiness and impact of COVID-19. Readiness of the additional financing is \nhigh  as  all  contracts  have  been  awarded  under  the  ongoing  project  and  implementation \narrangements  are  in  place.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  had  a  moderate  impact  on \nimplementation performance of the ongoing project. Hence, an extension of the overall project\u2019s \n \n17 The overall project's climate mitigation financing amount was updated during the preparation of this additional \nfinancing project to reflect the mitigation benefits derived from switching to electric pumps, which was not captured \nin the original project loan. This is aligned with: ADB (Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department). \n2016. Guidance Note on Counting Climate Finance at ADB. 13 October (internal). \n18 Upon the approval of the ADB Board of Directors of the proposed additional financing loan, the director general of \nthe South Asia Department, acting under the authority set forth in ADB. 2018.

Manila (para. 12), approves a 1.5-year extension of the ongoing loan's closing \ndate from 30 June 2022 to 31 December 2023. \n \n ", "8 \nimplementation period up to 31 December 2023 (including the ongoing loan) is necessary \nbecause of the continuing risk that the COVID-19 pandemic may impact on the timely completion \nof remaining works. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n21.  The additional financing is to cover cost overruns within the existing project scope. Due \ndiligence was carried out on the overall project\u2019s economic viability and the financial sustainability. \n \nA.  Technical \n \n22.  The ongoing project and additional financing remain technically feasible and comply with \nBangladesh and international engineering standards, regulations, and conditions. Since the same \nclimate baseline and projections are still applicable and the expected impacts are the same as for \nthe  ongoing  project,  the  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment  prepared  during  project \nappraisal remains applicable. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n23.  Economic analysis. With the additional financing, the project remains economically \nviable.19 The project provides benefits by increasing the irrigated area from 11,300 ha to about \n18,000 ha, increasing the crop intensity from 131% to 184%, increasing yields by up to 50% for \npaddy rice, and increasing cash crop production. With the additional financing included, the \nproject\u2019s EIRR was reduced from 20.9% at project appraisal to 15.4%. The increase in investment \ncost is offset by changes in farm product prices and farm input prices during 2013\u20132020. The \nsensitivity analysis indicates that the EIRR will drop to below the economic viability threshold of \n9% if either the project costs further increase by more than 75% or the project benefits reduce by \nmore than 33%. The direct beneficiaries of the project are the Muhuri Irrigation Project farmers, \nand the benefit distribution analysis confirms that small farmers and sharecroppers will share a \nsubstantial proportion of the total project benefits. \n \n24.  Financial analysis.20 The assets created under the project comprise the level 1 water \ncontrol infrastructure (a coastal barrage), level 2 irrigation canals, and level 3 tertiary water \ndistribution systems. The BWDB will be responsible for the O&M of the level 1 infrastructure, and \na new M-IMO, which is expected to be a private organization recruited through a PPP agreement, \nwill be responsible for the O&M of the level 2 and level 3 assets. The M-IMO will be financed from \ncollection of irrigation service fees (ISFs) from the farmers. The farmers are already incurring high \ncosts for diesel pumping, which the project will replace with electric pumps that are cheaper to \noperate. The ISFs will cover the M-IMO costs, O&M of the level 2 and level 3 assets, and electricity \ncharges. The BWDB and Muhuri Irrigation Project water users' associations have agreed to \nclosely monitor the M-IMO and promptly resolve any performance issues. A financial analysis was \nundertaken to assess the BWDB\u2019s capacity to operate and maintain all level 1 project assets and \nfarmers\u2019 capacity to pay an ISF that will be used to maintain the level 2 and level 3 assets. The \nannual O&M costs of the primary irrigation assets are estimated to be Tk6.8 million. However, the \nBWDB\u2019s financial capacity to fund these costs will depend on the government\u2019s budgetary \nappropriations to the BWDB for its O&M operations. Unfortunately, the BWDB has received only \nan average of 12% of its annual O&M budget requests during FY2014\u2013FY2019. Hence, there is \na risk that the BWDB may not be able to sustainably fund its Muhuri Irrigation Project operations. \n \n19 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "9 \nFor the secondary and tertiary irrigation assets, financial modeling indicates that, during FY2024\u2013\nFY2028, the total ISF collection will be about Tk274.0 million, which is substantially more than the \ncombined O&M cost of about Tk158.6 million. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n25.  The project\u2019s sustainability depends on the quality of the MOM of the Muhuri Irrigation \nProject system. The better the MOM, the longer the infrastructure will last and support quality \nirrigation services for the farmers. On the other hand, quality irrigation services are a necessary \ncondition for farmers' willingness to pay for a service fee. Lessons from past irrigation projects in \nBangladesh have demonstrated the recurrent inability of the public sector to ensure suitable \nMOM. Consequently, many irrigation investments have fallen into disrepair and failed to deliver \nthe intended benefits. The ongoing project has introduced technical and institutional innovations \nto  break  this  prevailing  build\u2013neglect\u2013rebuild  cycle.  The  project  is  installing  innovative \ninfrastructure to substantially increase the Muhuri Irrigation Project water use efficiency, reduce \npumping costs, and facilitate irrigation tariff collection by (i) replacing diesel motor pumps with \nelectric pumps, with positive climate change impact; (ii) developing highly efficient buried-pipe \ntertiary distribution systems; and (iii) installing prepaid card meters to allow transparent irrigation \ntariff payment and accounting. On the institutional side, the transfer of MOM to the private sector \nthrough a PPP model aims to establish performance-based management of the irrigation system \nand guarantee quality service delivery to farmers. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n26.  Financial management. A financial management assessment has been conducted for \nthe BWDB, in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines.21 The assessment found that, during the \nongoing project, all audited project financial statements have been unqualified and submitted to \nADB in a timely manner. However, the assessed financial management risk is substantial, mainly \nbecause (i) the BWDB\u2019s internal audit function may not have the capacity to audit the project \nregularly, (ii) there is scope for improving project financial reporting, and (iii) the receipts and \npayments under the ADB financing are captured using manual accounting systems. These risks \nwill be mitigated by (i) providing continuous training in ADB\u2019s financial reporting and auditing \nrequirements, (ii) requiring more comprehensive financial information to be submitted as part of \nquarterly progress reports, (iii) including detailed instructions and reporting templates in the \nupdated PAM, and (iv) adopting an accounting software system at the project management unit \nlevel to record receipts and payments under ADB financing. \n \n27.  Procurement. All procurement of goods, works, and consultants financed by the ADB \nloan have been carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended \nfrom time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). All works and consulting services packages under the project have been awarded. Some \ncontract amendments are under preparation and will be included in the ongoing works and \nconsulting contracts. \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  BWDB.  The specific  policy  requirements  and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the updated PAM (footnote 15). \n \n \n21 ADB. 2015. Technical Guidance Note on Financial Management Assessment. Manila. \n \n ", "10 \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n29.  Poverty. A poverty and social assessment was completed when preparing the ongoing \nproject. It is anticipated that modernizing the irrigation scheme will reduce poverty in the project \narea by about 7%.The beneficiaries are marginal, small, medium-sized, and large landholders; \n \nsharecroppers;  landless  people;  destitute  women;  households  headed  by  women;  minority \ngroups; as well as the general population in the project\u2019s area of influence. The total number of \nbeneficiaries is about 1.4 million people, more than 60% of whom live below the poverty line. The \nproject creates direct employment opportunities for the poor during the construction of water-\nrelated infrastructure. The ongoing project summary poverty reduction and social strategy has \nbeen updated for the additional financing.22 \n \n30.  Gender. The overall project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The project \narea of greater Noakhali, including Feni district, is a culturally conservative area with strict \nobservance of purdah (seclusion of women from public observation). While both the BWDB and \nADB are committed to adopting aspirational gender targets at the ongoing project design stage, \nproject implementation has faced unexpected challenges because of (i) the overt discouragement \nby family and community members of the active participation of women in project activities; and \n(ii) strict observance of purdah, which affected women\u2019s ability to take up the opportunities \nprovided by the project.23 These circumstances led to the revision of selected gender-related \ntargets in the overall project\u2019s design and monitoring framework and related gender action plan.24 \nThe project commits to ensure that at least 5% of the employment generated from the project \nworks accrue to women, 2% of employment as pump operators and 5% of employment as mobile \nwater unit vendors is reserved for women, and there is 20% female participation in training in \nirrigated farming methods. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n31.  The  environmental  and  social  safeguard  requirements  for  the  ongoing  project  are \nunchanged. The environmental and social safeguards plan implementation, monitoring, and \nreporting, and the grievance redress mechanism established for the ongoing project, will remain \nunchanged and are applicable to the additional financing. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard categories are as follows.25 \n \n32.  Environment (category C). The ongoing project will remain category B for environment. \nThe additional financing will be category C for environment since funds will be used for covering \ncost overruns, which have no adverse environmental impacts. \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The ongoing project was recategorized from C \nto B on 13 July 2020 for involuntary resettlement, as land acquisition became necessary for one \nelectrical substation. Also, 34 non-titled structures were temporarily relocated during construction \nof the embankments, so a corrective action plan was implemented, and all affected squatters \nhave received compensation. All involuntary resettlement impacts have been mitigated by the \nproject. The additional financing is classified C for involuntary resettlement, as no additional land \nacquisition is envisaged. \n \n \n22 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 The challenges faced during project implementation have been formally recorded in the aide-m\u00e9moire finalized after \ntwo project review missions, in May 2017 and January 2018. \n24 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 ADB.
