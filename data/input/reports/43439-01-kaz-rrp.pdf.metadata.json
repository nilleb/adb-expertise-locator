The design and monitoring framework for the investment program is \nin Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nCAREC\u2019s  Transport  and  Trade  Facilitation  Strategy  (TTFS)  and  Action  Plan1 develops \n2. \nsix  key  corridors  to  increase  the  region\u2019s  connectivity  and  competitiveness.  The  strategy\u2019s \nsuccess largely depends on Kazakhstan\u2019s investments in the corridors as Kazakhstan serves as \nthe  main  conduit  for  regional  trade  owing  to  its  strategic  location  and  abundant  resources. \nKazakhstan consumes $12 billion of the Action Plan\u2019s $25 billion investments for 2008\u20132017, to \nimprove 3,600 kilometers (km) of roads, 1,700 km of railways, airport, and port in its territory.2 \n\n3. \nCAREC Corridor 2 connects the Caucasus and Mediterranean to East Asia via Central \nAsian  countries.3 The  investment  program  targets  Kazakhstan's  Mangystau  Oblast  (province) \nsections of the corridor. The adjoining road in Uzbekistan, which the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) is helping improve,4 will add impetus to regional connectivity and strengthen the viability \nof the investment program roads. \n\nLocated  at  the  center  of  transport  flows  between  Europe  and  Asia,  and  thus  providing \n4. \nstrategic  arteries  of  emerging  transcontinental  routes,  Kazakhstan  has  great  transit  potential.  \nFew  land  transport  routes  can  avoid  Kazakhstan  when  linking  north  to  south  or  east  to  west. \nTrade  between  Asia  and  Europe,  amounting  to  $700  billion  in  2009,  is  expected  to  reach  $1 \ntrillion by 2015, of which 20% will pass through Kazakhstan. This transit traffic is forecasted to \ngenerate $1.1 billion in revenues for Kazakhstan.   \n\n5. \nMangystau  Oblast  is  Kazakhstan's  major  oil-  and  mineral-producing  region  on  the \neastern shore of the Caspian Sea. Aktau, Mangystau\u2019s capital, is a regional hub for transporting \nthe  Caspian's  bulky  cargoes  of  oil  and  oil  products  to  European  and  Asian  countries,  and  for \ntransit  traffic  connecting  the  surrounding  oilfield  developers  to  other  countries.  Aktau  is  an \nintegral  part  of  three  international  transport  corridors\u2014Transport  Corridor  Europe\u2013Caucasus\u2013\nAsia,  North\u2013South,  and  Inogate.  Cargo  transported  across  the  Caspian  Sea  amounts  to  30 \nmillion  tons,  of  which  38%  is  via  Aktau  port.  Consequently,  investments  have  been  poured  in \npipelines,  shipping  services,  and  Aktau  port.  As  spillover  traffic  from  the  pipeline  and  the \ntransport of goods increase, roads become indispensable.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy and Action Plan. Manila. \n2  The action plan comprises 65 priority projects to construct or reconstruct 8,000 km of roads, 6,000 km of railways, \n\n7 airports, 3 ports, and 7 logistics centers. \n\n3  The corridor covers 3,800 km of roads, 3,900 km of railways, 3 airports, and 2 ports. It runs from Istanbul through \nPoti and Batumi in Georgia to Tianjin and Shanghai in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), through Azerbaijan, \nKazakhstan,  Tajikistan,  Uzbekistan,  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The  corridor  includes  rail  and  automotive  ferry \nservices across the Caspian Sea to Aktau and continues through Beineu, crossing into Uzbekistan at Karakalpakya. \nThe route continues on to Bekabad, crosses into Tajikistan, and traverses back to Uzbekistan. It connects to the \nKyrgyz Republic and then enters the PRC at Yierkeshitan, before proceeding to the PRC\u2019s eastern port. \n\n4  ADB.  2010.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Multitranche \n\nFinancing Facility to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the CAREC Corridor 2 Road Investment Program. Manila. \n\n\fKazakhstan's 93,000 km road network has 23,495 km of republican (national) roads, and \n6. \nthe  rest  are  rural  and  urban  roads.  Increased  motorization,  a  greater  number  of  private  road \nhauling companies, shorter transport hauls of goods, and a changing industrial and distribution \npattern  have  increased  road  freight  traffic.  In  2009,  roads  accounted  for  25%  of  Kazakhstan's \nfreight  traffic  by  ton-km  and  85%  of  its  passenger  traffic  by  passenger-km.  These  shares  are \nlikely to continue to grow in the foreseeable future.  \n\n7. \nKazakhstan\u2019s  road  sector  has  chronic  operational  and  institutional  bottlenecks  caused \nmainly  by  (i)  insufficient  and  deteriorating  infrastructure,  (ii)  weak  cost  recovery,  (iii) inefficient \ncross-border  procedures,  (iv)  poor  planning,  and  (v)  limited  project  development  and \nmanagement  capacity.  These  bottlenecks  raise \ntransport  costs  and  hamper  regional \ncooperation and integration opportunities, undercutting the country\u2019s competitiveness.5  \n\n8. \nMuch of the road network is in poor condition, as 40% of republican roads require major \nrehabilitation and proper maintenance. The feeder road network serving the rural population is \nnot fully developed. Roads on the six main international corridors are mostly paved with asphalt, \nbut  their  technical  and  operational  characteristics  (e.g.,  evenness  and  strength)  are  below \ninternational standards, with traffic exceeding allowable loads.6 As a result, the average driving \nspeed along the Transport Corridor Europe\u2013Caucasus\u2013Asia, one of the six international transit \ncorridors, is less than 20 km per hour. Combined with cross-border impediments, deteriorated \nroad infrastructure has led the country\u2019s transit traffic to fall far short.  \n\n9. \nMore than half of the road surface in Mangystau Oblast is gravel or earth, and most of \nthe paved sections are severely deteriorated and impassable. Traffic on the Akau\u2013Beineu road \nhas grown by 7% annually. Despite its strategic role as an arterial route, most of the road is in \nbad shape, as steep slopes and sharp turns limit the allowable speed. Congestion occurs daily, \nand the actual axle load of vehicles exceeds the road's design capacity. The road's inadequate \nserviceability and the consequent 12-hour travel time between Aktau and Beineu bloat transport \ncosts and restrict trade. \n\n10. \nThe  investment  program  will  reconstruct  the  790  km  of  CAREC  Corridor  2  roads  in \nMangystau  Oblast.  The  investment  program  roads  connect  Kazakhstan  to  Azerbaijan,  and \nEurope  through  the  Caspian  Sea  to  the  west;  to  the  Russian  Federation  to  the  north;  to \nUzbekistan  to  the  southeast;  and  to  Turkmenistan  to  the  south.  The  investment  program \neffectively responds to bottlenecks and risks, which were assessed in the road map.  \n\nThe government has adopted the 2020 Strategy for Economic Development (approved \n11. \nin  February  2010)  and  the  State  Program  on  Accelerated  Industrial-Innovative  Development \n(SPAID) (approved in March 2010) to diversify the economy and promote all sectors\u2019 balanced \ndevelopments.7 To effectively support the 2020 Strategy and SPAID, the government\u2019s previous \nroad  development  plan  for  2006\u20132012  (RDP)  has  been  reshaped  and  expanded  into  the \nTransport Sector Program for 2010\u20132014 (TSP), approved by the government in July 2010. The \nTSP will develop an efficient transport system, which is integrated into the international transport \n\n                                                 \n5  Sector Assessment (Summary): Road Map (Appendix 2). \n6  The six main international routes are (i) Tashkent\u2013Shymkent\u2013Taraz\u2013Almaty\u2013Khorgos, (ii) Shymkent\u2013Kyzyl-Orda\u2013\nAktobe\u2013Uralsk\u2013Samara,  (iii)  Almaty\u2013Karagandy\u2013Astana\u2013Petropavlovsk,  (iv)  Astrakhan\u2013Atyrau\u2013Aktau\u2013border  of \nTurkmenistan,  (v)  Omsk\u2013Pavlodar\u2013Semei\u2013Maikapshagai,  and  (vi)  Astana\u2013Kostanai\u2013Chelyabinsk\u2013Ekaterinburg. \nRoutes (i) and (ii) are part of CAREC Corridor 1 and route (iv) is part of CAREC Corridor 2. \n\n7  Kazakhstan\u2019s previous Transport Strategy for 2006\u20132015, which supported ADB\u2019s 1st MFF for CAREC Corridor 1, \n\nhas been integrated into the 2020 Strategy, SPAID, and TSP.   \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fsystem.8  \n\n12. \nAn MFF is proposed to finance the investment program. The MFF comprises physical \ninvestments for upgrading roads and border infrastructure and facilities, as well as nonphysical \ninvestments  for  institutional  capacity  development,  which  includes  project  preparation,  project \nmanagement, asset management, and border-crossing procedures. \n\nThe  investment  program  aligns  with  ADB's  Strategy  20209 and  its  country  operations \n13. \nbusiness plan for 2010\u20132011, as well as CAREC\u2019s TTFS and Action Plan. It also aligns with the \nKazakhstan's 2020 Strategy, SPAID, and TSP. \n\n14. \nThe  MFF  is  the  modality  of  choice  for  the  investment  program  as  it  strengthens  the \npartnership  between  ADB  and  Kazakhstan  that  has  begun  with  the  CAREC  Corridor  1 \ninvestment program.10 All the conditions for its use are in place: a coherent strategy and sector \nroad  map,  policy  framework,  investment  plan,  and  financing  plan.  Other  modalities  were \nconsidered and discarded. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n15. \nThe  investment  program  will  contribute  to  sustainable  economic  development  and \nregional  cooperation  under  CAREC.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  transport  connectivity  and \nefficiency and institutional effectiveness. \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  outputs  of  the  investment  program  will  be  (i)  the  reconstructed  790  km  roads  of \n16. \nCAREC Corridor 2 in Mangystau; (ii) strengthened capacity for planning, project management, \nand asset management; and (iii) improved cross-border infrastructure and facilities. The 790 km \nroads will include the 430 km Aktau\u2013Manasha section, the 84 km Beineu\u2013Akzhigit (Uzbekistan \nborder)  section,  and  the  237  km  Zhetybai\u2013Fetisovo  section.  These  outputs  will  be  achieved \nthrough two components: road development and capacity development. \n\n17. \nOutputs  for  project  1,  financed  under  trance  1,  will  be  (i)  the  200  km  reconstructed \nsections  (km  372.6\u2013km  514.3  and  km  574\u2013km  632.3)  of  the  Aktau\u2013Manasha  road,  including \nculverts and bridges, overpasses, road signs, and signal posts along dangerous spots; and (ii) \nstrengthened  project  management  and  institutional  capacity.  The  capacity-development \ncomponent under project 1 will support program management and institutional strengthening for \nthe  investment  program.  It  will  include  (i)  construction  supervision  and  program  management; \n(ii)  feasibility  studies  of  subsequent  tranche  projects;  and  (iii)  capacity  development  for  road \nconstruction and maintenance, procurement design, contract management, the enforcement of \nenvironmental and resettlement safeguards, and border crossing activities. \n\n                                                 \n8  The contents of RDP (e.g., vision, strategic focus, investment projects) remain unchanged in TSP. TSP, integrating \ndevelopment  plans  for  all  subsectors  (roads,  railways,  waterways,  aviation,  ports),  has  the  additional  focuses:  (i) \ntransport  with  high-technology,  competitive  and  international  standards;  and  (ii)  closely  driven  by  economic \ninterests, national security, geopolitics and businesses. \n\n9  ADB.  2008.

The \nMFF  is  anticipated  to  include  three  tranches,  subject  to  the  government's  submission  of  the \nrelated  periodic  financing  requests  (PFRs),  execution  of  the  related  loan  agreements  for  each \ntranche,  and  fulfillment  of  terms  and  conditions  and  undertakings  set  forth  in  the  framework \nfinancing  agreement  (FFA)  to  be  entered  into  between  the  Borrower  and  ADB.  The  FFA  has \nbeen negotiated and its signing by the government is being delayed due to the need on the part \nof the government to conduct interagency review of the negotiated FFA11 and loan agreement \nprior  to  their  signing  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  prescribed  by  the  legislation  of  the \nRepublic of Kazakhstan. Thus, the FFA signing is expected after the Board approval date. The \nOCR  financing  will  follow  the  ordinary  operations  loan  regulations  applicable  to  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  loans,  subject  to  possible  modifications  under  individual \nloan  agreements.  The  government  will  provide  $412  million  equivalent  as  a  counterpart \ncontribution.  \n\n20. \nThe PFR for tranche 1 under the MFF will be for a loan of $283 million from ADB\u2019s OCR \nto  help  finance  project  1  (footnote  11).  The  first  PFR  is  being  presented  to  ADB  Board  of \nDirectors  with  this  report  and  the  FFA.  Interest  during  construction  will  be  paid  from  the \ngovernment\u2019s own sources.

An economic internal rate of return for the 430 km \nroad was estimated at 16.1%, with four subsections\u2019 economic internal rates of return ranging \nfrom  14.9%  to  21.8%.  The  viability  of  the  project  rests  on  vehicle  operating  cost  and  time \nsavings  resulting  from  improved  road  conditions  after  the  project. 13  Sensitivity  analysis \nconfirmed its economic viability.14 \n\n23.  With  international  financial  institutions\u2019  efforts  toward  good  governance,  MOTC\u2019s \nfinancial  management  is  improving.  MOTC  plans  to  establish  a  financial  management  system \nthat will include a manual of finance procedures, automatic project accounting, and training. The \nautomatic  accounting  system  will  be  used  to  implement  the  investment  program,  allowing \nproject  transactions  to  be  efficiently  recorded  and  reported  and  interim  financial  reports  to  be \npromptly generated. The auditing of project financial statements will be timely. \n\nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOTC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare  described  in  the  FAM.  The  government\u2019s  policies  and  procedures  regarding  financial \nmanagement,  procurement,  anticorruption,  policy  and  legal,  capacity,  and  other  institutional \nissues and mechanisms have been assessed and found satisfactory. \n\n25. \nAll  bidding  documents  for  contracts  under  the  MFF  will  include  provisions  specifying \nADB\u2019s right to audit the Committee\u2019s records and accounts related to the MFF, as well as those \nof all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the MFF. \nThe  government,  MOTC,  and  the  Committee  will  take  additional  measures  to  strengthen \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency  under  the  MFF,  primarily  by  utilizing  direct \npayment procedures. Key measures are (i) external auditing of contracts, project accounts, and \nfinancial statements; (ii) transparent decisions on all procurement matters; and (iii) verification of \ncontractors\u2019 payment claims by supervising consultants following contract specifications. \n\nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe investment program is not a targeted intervention.15 Mangystau Oblast is developing \n26. \nrapidly.  The  oblast  is  ranked  third  in  the  country  by  per  capita  income,  following  Atyrau  and \nAstana. About 25% of the oblast\u2019s population is poor. While residents in Aktau receive earnings \n40% higher than the oblast average, rural areas\u2019 incomes are much lower, at 30%\u201340% of the \naverage.  Rural  areas  generally  have  inadequate  social  services  (teachers,  doctors,  and  civil \nservants), water supply, and electricity.  \n\n                                                 \n13 Deteriorated  road  conditions  under  the  without-project  scenario  would  have  required  mounting  maintenance \nexpenditures  to  keep  the  roads  open  for  traffic.  Without  the  project,  routine  annual  maintenance  expenditures \nwould  have  to  be  higher  to  arrest  further  road  deterioration  and  prevent  the  closure  of  the  road.  While  gradual \npavement  deterioration  is  also  assumed  under  the  with-project  scenario,  it  occurs  more  slowly,  giving  rise  to \nsavings in vehicle operating costs in relation to the without-project case. \n\n14  Economic Analysis (Appendix 2). \n15  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 2). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fIn  2007,  20  cases  of  HIV  infection  were  reported  in  Mangystau  Oblast.  Road \n27. \nconstruction  may  increase  sexually  transmitted  infections.  The  government  has  prepared  a \nmitigation plan. Contractors will incorporate mitigation measures in their contracts for civil works. \nThe  government  also  prepared  a  well-defined  program  maximizing  awareness  and  preventive \nactions. \n\n28.  Women  in  Mangystau  Oblast  have  few  employment  opportunities  in  the  oil  industry. \nWomen  are  mostly  engaged  in  housework  and  caring  for  children  and  the  elderly.  Women\u2019s \nsalaries are usually half those of men. The ratio of wages paid to women and men ranges from \n25% in Karakiyanskiy Rayon (district) to 69% in Mangystau Rayon. In family budgets, however, \nthere is no gender inequality; incomes are equally managed by and expended on both genders. \nMost  rural  women  are  vulnerable  but  receive  state  social  allowances.  Factors  causing  their \npoverty include limited economic opportunity, low income from farming, and high engagement in \nunpaid housework. \n\n29. \nThe  investment  program  will  benefit  women  in  the  project  area  through  increased \neconomic  activity  such  as  small  roadside  businesses,  improved  living  conditions,  training  in \nfarming  skills,  and  increased  access  to  new  products  and  services.  MOTC  ensured  that \ncontractors will not discriminate against women in employment during implementation.  \n\nConsidering the communities may be easily neglected during program execution, MOTC \n30. \nhas prepared a community and gender action plan as part of a land acquisition and resettlement \nplan (LARP) for project 1. The action plan intends to maximize direct benefits to women such as \nimproved  mobility,  job  opportunities,  and  access  to  social  services.  This  plan  will  be  executed \nalong with the LARP. \n\nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  MOTC  has  prepared  an \n31. \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework16 for  the  investment  program  and  an  initial \nenvironmental examination17 for project 1. Project 1 will not have major environmental impacts \nand  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  MOTC  has  prepared  a  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement framework18 for the investment program and the LARP19 for project 1. Project 1 is \nclassified as involuntary resettlement category B since it does not involve major land acquisition \nor involuntary resettlement or affect ethnic minority groups. The environmental assessment and \nreview  framework,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework,  and  LARP  were  disclosed  in \nAugust 2010. Project 1 does not trigger indigenous peoples safeguards.  \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n32. \nTable 4 summarizes the major risks of the investment program and mitigating measures. \nThis  risk  profile  focuses  mainly  on  delays  in  implementation  and  road  sustainability.  Broader \nrisks  include  cross-border  performance  and  changed  macroeconomic  conditions.  Without \nefficient border crossing, trade costs increase and trade flows suffer. This ultimately affects the \nviability of the road corridor. The government has agreed to take action to mitigate such risks.20 \nInvestments  in  border  crossing  points  are  part  of  the  investment  program.  This  also  requires \n                                                 \n16  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (Appendix 2). \n17  Initial Environmental Examination for Project 1 (Appendix 2). \n18  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (Appendix 2). \n19  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan for Project 1 (Appendix 2). \n20  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\finvestment  in  neighboring  countries  and  agreements  to  speed  document  clearance  and  cut \ncosts and travel time. \n\nRisks \nEffective implementation \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nQualified individual consultants teaming up with the Ministry of \nTransport and Communications \n\nProfessional and competent project management \n\nFirm strategy, road map, and policy framework \n\nRoad sector sustainability \n\nContinued institutional reform \nAnnual road maintenance budget \n\nAdvisory services to review revenues and expenditures, \nmaintenance, and external quality-control system  \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank and Ministry of Transport and Communications of Kazakhstan. \n \n\nIV. \n\nUNDERTAKINGS AND ASSURANCES \n\n33. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the investment program shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the facility administration manual and loan documents. \n\nThe government has given ADB certain undertakings for the investment program, which \n34. \nare set forth in the FFA.
