The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n2. \nThe  project  will  produce  a  more  competitive  and  highly  skilled  workforce  in  priority \nindustries  by  developing  higher  level  training  programs  at  a  new  college  level,  while  also \nestablishing  and  strengthening  system  governance  and  quality  assurance  frameworks  for \nvocational training. Studies will also strengthen the policy foundation for future development.  \n \n3. \nThe  project  will  improve  the  quality  and  management  of  vocational  education  and \ntraining (VET) programs in 15 public and 5 private vocational colleges (VCs) in economic zones \noffering  programs  for  occupations  in  high  demand  in  priority  industries.  The  programs  cover \nautomotive  technology,  electrical  manufacturing,  hospitality  and  tourism,  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT), mechanical manufacturing, and navigation and shipping. The \nproject will consist of two loans, the first to strengthen the public vocational training system and \nVCs,  and  the  second  to  provide  private  VCs  with  additional  resources  through  an  onlending \nfacility.  The  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  project  will  be  students  in  certificate  and  diploma \nvocational training courses, most of whom come from the rural lower middle class.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n4. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  poverty  reduction  and  economic  growth  achievements  in  the  last  20  years \nare a great success story. Real gross domestic product grew by an average of 8% per year from \n2003  to  2007  and  per  capita  income  increased  from  $441  in  2002  to  $818  in  2007.1 Exports \nhave  been  the  main  driver  of  growth,  and  foreign  investments  have  been  buoyant.  This  high \nlevel of growth has changed the economic structure; the share of industry and services in the \ngross domestic product has steadily increased, while the share of agriculture has declined.  \n \nJob  growth  has  been  strong  over  the  decade, with  changing  employment  patterns  that \n5. \nreflect the changes in the economic structure. Agriculture's share of employment has declined \nfrom  66%  to  50%,  industry  and  construction  has  increased  from  10%  to  20%,  while  service \nsector employment has increased from 24% to 30%.  Employment growth is highest in industry \nand services, but is also strong in tourism. ICT and science and technically based industries are \nsmall  but  growing.  If  Viet  Nam  is  to  expand  as  an  industrialized  country,  it  must  develop  highly \nskilled  industrial  workers  who  can  increase  enterprise  productivity,  product  quality  and  service \nstandards. Viet Nam\u2019s long-term prosperity and economic development depends on increasing \nits  competitiveness  in  regional  and  global  markets.  For  the  first  time,  a  shortage  of  labor  has \nbecome an obstacle to expanding business.2 A major challenge for the VET sector, therefore, is to \nproduce  more  and  better  qualified  skilled  workers.  At  present,  only  13%  of  the  employable \nworkforce has vocational qualifications. \n \n6. \nThe VET system is being transformed by a new focus on higher level skills, through the \nrecent establishment of a college level. There are currently 90 public VCs and 20 private VCs.  \nIn response to the demand for a more highly skilled workforce, the government has developed \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB, Country Operations Business Plan. Viet Nam 2009-2011. Manila. 2008.  \n2   United  Nations  Industrial  Development  Organization.  2009.  Skill  Development  for  Vietnam\u2019s  Industrialization. \n\nHa Noi. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nan excellent set of policies to strengthen the VET system, through the new Law on Vocational \nTraining, 2006, effective in 2008. The major provisions of this law are (i) expansion of a more \nadvanced level of training; (ii) improved VET quality and relevance; (iii) greater involvement of a \nrange  of  partners,  particularly  from  the  private  sector;  and  (iv)  strengthened  VET  sector \nmanagement  under  one  central  agency,  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  Invalids  and  Social  Affairs \n(MOLISA).  Most  of  the  groundwork  for  this  law  was  laid  under  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)-supported  Vocational  and  Technical  Education  Project  (VTEP).3 Implementation  of  the \nmajor provisions of the law forms the foundation of the proposed project.  \n \n7. \nMany VET graduates lack appropriate technical and general work skills. The immediate \ncauses  are  poor  training  quality  and  management  capacity,  weak  sector  management,  and \nlimited  private  sector  collaboration  and  partnerships.  This  is  underpinned  by  inadequate \nfinancing  of  the  VET  sector  and  vocational  training  institutions.  In  addition,  the  VET  system  is \nlargely supply-driven, reinforced by input-focused financing and the absence of skills standards \nthat  link  specific  competencies  to  labor  market  needs.  Limited  collaboration  with  industry  has \nreinforced this tendency. However, this is now changing and there is a strong desire within the \ngovernment to build a better training system that is more relevant to industry.   \n \n8. \nThe VTEP initiated significant reform in VET quality assurance systems, and modernized \nvocational  training  curricula  in  line  with  new  production  techniques  and  technologies,  while \nsubstantially  upgrading  vocational  secondary  schools.  Other  donor  initiatives  include  system \nreforms  and  strengthening  of  vocational  training  institutions  by  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement, the European Union, German development cooperation through GTZ and KfW, \nthe Government of the Republic of Korea, and the Government of Luxembourg. These projects \nhave all been successful in strengthening the lower levels of the vocational training system and \nhave expanded training opportunities for primary school and junior secondary school leavers.  \n \n9. \nThe  VTEP  illustrated  the  value  of  experimenting  with  new  approaches  within  a \ncircumscribed  context  before  system-wide  implementation.  It  focused  upon  improving  the \ntechnical skills of students and teachers, but weak management at the school and central levels \nundermined  these  efforts.4 Similarly,  the  absence  of  a  training  system  to  periodically  update \nteachers' skills in response to new technologies and changing job markets hampered efforts to \nimprove teacher quality. The proposed project will address both of these weaknesses.  \n \n10. \nProject approach. The project will address skills shortages in highly skilled occupational \nareas.  Fifteen  skilled  occupations  that  are  in  high  demand  in  high-growth  industries,  and \nrelevant  to  government  development  plans  for  five  economic  zones  were  identified  through  a \nlabor  market  survey  in  the  following  sectors:  (i)  automotive  technology,  (ii)  electrical \nmanufacturing,  (iii)  hospitality  and  tourism,  (iv)  ICT,  (v)  mechanical  manufacturing,  and \n(vi) transport (navigation and shipping). ICT and hospitality and tourism were chosen as many \nwomen work in these sectors. It is expected that the number of sectors with large numbers of \nwomen workers will increase as new jobs are created where gender is not an obstacle.5   \n \n11. \nSkills  shortages  will  be  addressed  through  targeted  occupational  training  programs  in \npublic and private VCs. Training programs linked to skills shortages will be delivered in 15 public \nVCs  by  providing  the  management  and  teacher  development  programs  needed  for  high-skill \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB.  2008.

The  five  private  VCs  will  benefit  from  the  same \nprograms  but  new  equipment  will  be  financed  through  the  onlending  facility.  All  of  the  VCs \nselected have programs in the industry sectors selected, are located near economic zones, and \nhave good facilities and training quality. The five private VCs are financially sound.6 \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe impact of the project will be a reduction in skills shortages in key occupations. The \noutcome  of  the  project  will  be  the  establishment  of  higher  level  skills  training  in  15  key \noccupations.  The  project  aims  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  VET  system  to  train  highly \nskilled  workers  and  technicians  who  can  master  the  modern  technologies  required  by \nenterprises in the industrial and service sectors. Two of the six industry sectors selected have \nhigh female representation to ensure that women benefit equally from the project. \n \nC. \n \nThe project adopts a demand-driven approach with effective participation by the private \n13. \nsector  through  (i)  improving  the  quality  and  management  of  training;  (ii)  upgrading  at  least \n20 public  and  private  VCs  so \nthey  can  deliver  priority  occupational  programs;  and  \n(iii) strengthening partnerships with the private sector. Together these three outputs will facilitate \nthe  successful  establishment  of  advanced  skills  training  by  ensuring  more  effective  sector \nmanagement  through  uniform  standards  and  stronger  quality  assurance  to  overcome  the \ncurrent diversity and uneven quality resulting from multiple training providers. The private sector \nwill  be  supported  to  promote  tighter  links  between  the  demands  of  the  labor  market  and  the \nvocational training system. The project will provide credit directly to private training providers to \nexpand  the  private  training  colleges,  and  will  promote  closer  links  between  industry  and  the \ndevelopment and delivery of training programs across the VET system.  \n \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nQuality and Management of Training Improved \n\n \n14. \nThe  project  will  support  improvements  in  the  quality  and  management  of  training  by \nstrengthening  leadership,  planning  and  management  capacities  in  MOLISA  and  the  VCs, \nimproving  the  quality  assurance  system  to  ensure  uniform  quality  across  all  VCs,  developing \nskills standards and certification so trainees meet industry standards, and expanding access to \nand enrollment in VET. \n \nSector leadership enhanced. The project will promote more effective sector leadership \n15. \nand  management  by  providing  training  to  General  Department  of  Vocational  Training  (GDVT) \nstaff  to  build  capacity  in  (i)  policy  coordination  and  formulation;  (ii)  GDVT  management;  and \n(iii) management  of  national  VET  quality  assurance  programs, \ntraining \ninformation system (VTIS), and strategic planning and resource allocation. A study to formulate \nrealistic cost norms for different occupational training programs will also be carried out to help \nGDVT prepare more accurate budget proposals that accurately reflect the true costs of training. \nGDVT will prepare a national VET training plan as well as annual operational plans. The project \nwill  improve  the  capacity  of  provincial  staff  from  GDVT,  Department  of  Labor,  Invalids  and \nSocial  Affairs,  and  other  concerned  ministries  to  manage,  develop,  and  adapt  VET  training \nprograms to fit the requirements of local enterprises.  \n \nThe  project  will  also  design  a  management  information  system  to  cover  central, \n16. \nprovincial,  and  VC  levels  to  improve  planning,  monitoring,  and  resource  allocation.  This  will \n                                                 \n6   Selection Criteria and Profiles of Project Colleges (Appendix 2). \n\nthe  vocational \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\faddress one of the most serious shortcomings of the current VET system. The new information \nsystem will be piloted in project VCs before a national rollout. \n \n17. \nProfessional  standards  for  vocational  instructors  will  be  developed  to  reinforce  uniform \nteacher quality and allow better targeted training programs. The new professional standards will \nbe  aligned  with  the  vocational  qualifications  framework  and  will  incorporate  both  teaching  and \ntechnical skills relevant to the selected occupational programs. A study to address the long-term \nproblem of how to attract and retain vocational instructors in the VET system will be carried out.  \n \n18. \nQuality  assurance  strengthened.  The  project  will  implement  the  skills  standards \ncurrently  being  developed  by  MOLISA,  and  will  strengthen  skills  testing  and  certification  by \nsupporting  the  development  of  procedures  for  assessment  and  certification,  including  assessor \nstandards  and  a  training  program  to  train  assessors.  Assessment  tools  for  each  of  the  training \nprograms will be developed, for use by assessors and national skills testing centers. The current \nquality  accreditation  program  for  institutions  will  be  strengthened  to  ensure  uniform  quality  of \ntraining, and a new system for accrediting individual training programs will be introduced.   \n \n19. \nOn the basis of the new skills standards, curricula and training materials will be developed \nwith industry involvement. A materials development team (including representatives from industry) \nwill be formed for each occupational program to develop modular curriculum and training materials. \n \n20. \nAccess  and  enrollments  expanded.  The  project  will  support  a  national  social \nmarketing  campaign  to  enhance  the  poor  social  image  of  VET  and  thereby  increase  VET \nenrollments\u2014targeting rural areas, women, and disadvantaged groups. The campaign will also \ntarget employers to inform them about the new programs to raise the quality of VET graduates \nand  prepare  them  for  employment.  The  social  marketing  program  will  train  VC  managers  in \nstrategies for marketing their training programs to local industries.  \n \n2. \n \n \n \n21. \nThe project will support the upgrading of 20 VCs to strengthen the capacity of the VET \nsystem  to  produce  highly  skilled  technicians  and  workers  for  key  industries.  Each  of  the \n15 public VCs will be upgraded to deliver good, market-relevant training in up to three of the 15 \noccupational  training  programs.  Eight  of  these  VCs  will  include  training  programs  with  the \npotential to attract larger numbers of female trainees. The management and training quality of at \nleast five private VCs will also be strengthened, but their physical facilities and equipment will be \nupgraded using funds from the onlending facility. \n \n22. \nQuality  of  instructors  strengthened.  The  teaching  skills  of  instructors  will  be \nstrengthened  through  in-service  training.  This  training  will  use  industry  employees  as  trainers  \nand provide both students and teachers with workplace training to expose them to current work \npatterns  and  technologies.  This  will  lay  the  foundation  for  a  system  for  periodic  upgrading  of \ntechnical skills and for remodelling the VC's 6-month pre-service training program. \n \n23.  Management capacity of vocational colleges strengthened. The project will support \nthe  development  of  a  modern  competency-based  management  training  program  to  train \nprincipals  and  VC  management  staff  in  strategic  planning,  leadership,  financial  management, \nmonitoring of performance and cost effectiveness, and entrepreneurship and marketing.  \n \n24.  Market-oriented program planning introduced. The project will train and support VCs to \nassess the quality and relevance of their training programs by measuring graduate employment \n\nVocational Colleges Upgraded to Deliver Priority Occupational Programs \n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f \n3. \n\nand employability, primarily through regular tracer studies. To improve program planning, staff will \nbe  trained  to  conduct  surveys  on  local  skill  needs  and  to  use  information  from  the  vocational \ntraining and labor market information systems. The project will support a pilot program to improve \ncareer counseling and work placements, to improve student employment outcomes.  \n \n\nPartnerships with the Private Sector Strengthened \n\n \n25. \nDevelopment of private vocational colleges. Greater private sector involvement in the \nprovision  of  training,  encouraged  by  incentives,  is  a  government  priority.  The  government \nsupports a significant expansion of the VET system, accompanied by a gradual shifting of state \nfunding  from  the  public  to  the  private  sector.  The  project  will  support  this  objective  by \nestablishing  a  credit  line  for  private  VCs.  Private  VCs  will  be  able  to access credit  to  upgrade \ntheir equipment and facilities. Five private colleges have been identified by GDVT as potential \nborrowers,  based  on  a  survey  of  the  11  institutions  that  expressed  interest  in  borrowing.7 The \ninstitutions were selected on the basis of their program's relevance to the project objectives as \nwell  as  their  financial  soundness.  The  training  programs  proposed  for  funding  are  all  in  high-\ntechnology areas: mechatronics, industrial electricity, welding, automotive technology, maritime, \nand ICT. The government is encouraging the private sector to provide  more  training  places in \nhigh-technology  areas  such  as  these.  The  selected  private  VCs  will  be  treated  as  part  of  the \noverall  project,  so  that  all  human  resource  development,  systems  improvement,  and  other \nnonphysical inputs will be provided to the approved private VCs on a grant basis, as for the 15 \npublic  VCs.  It  is  expected  that  each  institution  will  borrow  $3  million\u2013$4  million.  More  private \nVCs will be identified by GDVT if the funds are not fully absorbed. The fund will be administered \nby the Vietnam Development Bank (VDB), which will approve individual applications.8 \n \n26. \nGreater  involvement  of  industry.  VCs  need  strong  managers  who  can  forge  new \npartnerships  with  local  enterprises  to  facilitate  work  placements,  more  market-relevant  training \nprograms, and better employment opportunities for graduates. Managers will be trained on how \nto communicate and partner successfully with local companies. At the same time, the concept of \ncorporate  social  responsibility  will  be  promoted  among  corporations  and  companies,  to \nencourage  companies  to  support  VET  training  programs  and  institutions  consistent  with  their \ncorporate priorities. Finally, as Viet Nam lags significantly behind its neighbors in the provision \nof  direct  training  by  companies,  a  study  will  be  carried  out  to  investigate  ways  in  which  such \ntraining can be stimulated.   \n \n27. \nSustainability of vocational colleges improved. The project will support MOLISA's plan \nto improve the sustainability of VCs through business and service activities, including short-term \ncourses for workers. Revenue from these activities can be retained by VCs and can be used to \nenhance teacher salaries and other quality improvement activities. \n \nD. \n \n28. \nTable 1. \n \n \n \n \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $78.0  million.

Both \nloans will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years. The first loan, on ADF \nregular  terms,  is  an  investment  loan  and  will  have  an  interest  rate  charge  of  1%  per  annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The second loan, on ADF hard terms, \nis a line of credit facility (LCF) and will have an interest rate charge of 2.22% per annum for the \nlife of the loan. The government will sign a subsidiary loan agreement with VDB, and will relend \nthe second loan amount to VDB for LCF using the ADF hard-term rate plus a service fee.

The majority come from \nrural areas and less wealthy families. From the last year of project implementation, the project \ncolleges will produce 7,335 graduates annually, of whom 35% will be women.  \n \nA. \n \nEconomic viability. The economic benefits from the project will be derived mainly from \n33. \nthe  incremental  productivity  gains  resulting  from  improved  quality  and  efficiency  of  training, \nexpressed in terms of the incremental income of the graduates. While it is reasonable to expect \nthat  system-wide  improvements  in  quality  and  efficiency  will  benefit  all  students  in  the  VET \nsystem,  only  the  incomes  of  graduates  from  programs  supported  by  the  project  in  public  VCs \nare quantified as incremental benefits. These are the 4,000 graduates from the full-time 3-year \ncourses.  Altogether,  the  project  VCs  will  benefit  24,000  students  and  will  produce  7,335 \ngraduates each year at a 90% completion rate from year 5. In addition, the project VCs will offer \nshort courses for continuing skills upgrading. Total short course enrollment is assumed to be 1.5 \n\n                                                 \n9   Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nGovernance \n\ntimes  the  annual  intake  of  the  diploma  programs  (11,500  workers  per  year),  of  whom  it  is \nassumed  10,328  will  complete  the  course.  An  estimated  35%  of  the  total  enrollment  will  be \nwomen  and  members  of  ethnic  minorities.  The  project's  economic  internal  rate  of  return  was \nestimated over a 20-year period (2010\u20132030) to be 15%.   \n \n34. \nFinancial sustainability. The project requires a total government contribution of $8 million \nover its 5-year life. The government\u2019s annual commitment to the project will reach a high of 0.8% \nof the central education budget, decreasing to 0.02% by the end of the project. The government\u2019s \nannual commitment is therefore affordable, ranging from 0.04% to 0.15% of the VET budget. Its \nshare in the project is estimated to increase from $0.65 million in year 1 to $3.9 million in year 2, \nand  $2.2  million  in  year  3,  decreasing  gradually  to  $0.14  million  by  the  end  of  the  project.  The \npost-project incremental personnel expenditure, estimated at about 2% of the 2010 annual budget \nof $384 million, can be absorbed. However, some of the 5% incremental increase for operations \nwill be met by individual VCs. The introduction of an entrepreneurial approach will help increase \nfiscal self-sufficiency. The project is financially feasible and sustainable.  \n \nB. \n \n35. \nADB  carried  out  financial  management  and  procurement  capacity  assessments  of \nMOLISA  and  GDVT.  The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  concluded  that  both \nagencies  have  the  capacity  to  carry  out  the  project.  Their  performance  under  the  VTEP  was \nsatisfactory.  Nevertheless,  the  financial  assessment  did  identify  inefficient  and  outdated \nfinancial  management  and  monitoring  systems  in  MOLISA,  GDVT,  and  VCs.  The  project  will \ntrain  staff  in  financial  planning,  accounting,  auditing  and  control  and  will  implement  a \nperformance-based planning and budgeting system using the cost norms to be developed under \nthe  project.  The  FMA  is  in  the  PAM.10 The  procurement  capacity  assessment  concluded  that \nGDVT is experienced in procuring goods, works, and service. Although timeliness was initially \nan issue under the VTEP, this improved as the project management unit gained experience.  \n \nThe governance assessment for the education sector in Viet Nam found that most major \n36. \ncorruption  risks  are  associated  with  procurement,  particularly  that  conducted  at  the  provincial \nlevel.  Another  source  of  risk  comes  from  poor  international  competitive  bidding  specifications \nleading  to  bids  from  underqualified  contractors.  Efforts  will  be  made  to  ensure  that  equipment \nspecifications under the project are correct. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the State Bank of Vietnam and MOLISA. The PAM \ndescribes the specific policy requirements and supplementary measures.  \n \nC. \n \n37. \nAlthough  Viet  Nam  has  made  impressive  progress  in  reducing  poverty,  15.5%  of \nhouseholds were still impoverished in 2006. Poverty is more pronounced in rural areas (where  \npoverty incidence ranges from 17% to 39%) than in urban areas and major industrial regions. A \nsocial  marketing  campaign  will  target  rural  students  and  young  workers,  women,  and \ndisadvantaged groups to attract more students into high-level skills training.  \n \nThe  project  will  benefit  rural  lower  and  upper  secondary  school  graduates,  the  group \n38. \nmost likely to enroll in VET courses. Although the project will operate at the college level, it will \nalso support overall institutional development and teacher training, which will raise the quality of \ntraining at the vocational secondary school level as well. Most students, particularly those from \nrural areas, will enter VCs through vocational secondary schools, whose entrance requirements \nrequire  only  completion  of  junior  secondary  school.  Most  students  who  complete  regular  high \n                                                 \n10 Appendix 7 of the Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2).  \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n\fschool  choose  university  for  further  studies.  Two  VCs  are  in  areas  with  significant  ethnic \nminority populations, most of whom are poor.  \n \n39. \nThe  Project  will  help  address  the  gender  inequities.  Women  make  up  nearly  half  of  the \nlabor force, but are underrepresented in skilled occupations with higher incomes. The labor force \nis  characterized  by  sex-segregation  by  occupation,  type  of  employment,  and  position.  Most \nwomen work in areas where they have traditionally been strongly represented, such as business \nand  accounting,  agriculture,  and  tourism  and  hospitality.  Men  dominate  the  industrial  trades. \nFemale  enrollment  in  the  VET  stream  reflects  these  patterns  as  vocational  training  institutions \nwere  established  mainly  to  train  for  traditional  male  occupations  in  industry.  However,  this  will \nchange as many of the new jobs being created in services and industry are equally acceptable to \nmen and women. VTEP institutions have had great success in increasing female enrollment and \nobtaining postgraduation salaries for women at virtually the same levels (94%) as for males.  \n \n40. \nThe project supports effective gender mainstreaming.  To ensure that girls benefit from \nthe  project,  a  dual  approach  will  be  adopted.  The  training  programs  selected  for  upgrading \nunder the project include two industry sectors where girls are well represented.  Simultaneously, \npilot programs developed through school gender action plans will be supported to attract more \ngirls into male-dominated sectors such as electronics and electrical installation.  \n \nD. \n \n41. \nThe involuntary resettlement categorization is C, as civil works include only upgrading of \nVC  facilities  within  existing  boundaries,  and  no  new  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  is \nenvisioned. The environmental categorization is also C. The indigenous peoples' categorization \nis  B,  as  two  VCs  have  been  selected  in  areas  with  significant  ethnic  minority  populations  to \nensure  social  equity.  The  social  marketing  strategy  for  increasing  awareness  of  VET  will \naddress social and gender inequality issues. Further, the project will emphasize the importance \nof industry partners becoming more engaged in social corporate responsibility initiatives.  \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe  key  risks  and  mitigating  measures  associated  with  the  expected  outcome  and \n\n \n\n42. \noutputs of the project are summarized in Table 4.  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nOutcome \nPoor image of VET will inhibit enrollment growth \n\nIndustry is not willing to participate fully in \ndeveloping and delivering effective programs \nInadequate supply of new technical instructors due \nto low salaries \nOutputs \nSerious lack of information on VET sector inhibits \nproper planning and resource allocation  \n\nTeachers will not be able to deliver the new \noccupational training programs  \nToo few private VCs will qualify for, or be \ninterested in, the onlending facility  \n\nMitigating Measures \n\n \nSocial marketing campaign will target rural youth and girls; actions \nin colleges will encourage girls to enroll. \nFinancial support will be provided for work placements; social \nmarketing campaign will target industry. \nA study will be carried out on the fundamental changes needed to \nteacher incentive structures.   \n \nNational VTIS to be developed and trialed under the project. \nInternational Labour Organization to develop national labor market \ninformation system. \nProfessional standards and new inservice training programs will be \ndeveloped; industry workers will teach in VCs.  \nA survey was conducted to identify qualified and interested private \nVCs. \n\nVC = vocational college, VET = vocational education and training, VTIS = vocational training information system. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff. \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nThe major risks at the impact level are that economic growth will be slow and that highly \n43. \nskilled labor will continue to be undervalued, resulting in low salaries and few incentives to take \nup  vocational  training.  At  the  outcome  level,  there  is  a  risk  that  (i)  the  poor  image  of  VET  will \ninhibit enrollment growth, (ii) industry will not be willing to participate fully in developing effective \nVET  programs,  and  (iii) expansion  of  the  vocational  teaching  force  will  be  constrained  by  low \nsalaries and the low status of the profession. These risks are all addressed under the project. \nThe  major  risks  associated  with  the  outputs  all  have  reasonable  mitigation  measures  and  are \nmanageable under the project. In summary, the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh the risks. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \nThe  government  and  MOLISA  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \n44. \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n\n \n45. \nIn addition to the standard assurances, the government and MOLISA have agreed with \nADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project \nagreement.
