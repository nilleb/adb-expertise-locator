THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Microenterprise Development Project. The report \nalso  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Capacity  Development  for \nMicroenterprise Development Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The project aims to promote microenterprise development for inclusive economic growth \nand poverty reduction. It will support improving microenterprise access to finance through the Palli \nKarma  Sahayak  Foundation  (PKSF),  an  apex  development  finance  and  capacity  building \norganization; and its partner organizations (POs), which are selected microfinance institutions \n(MFIs). The overall project comprises (i) a financial intermediary loan of $50 million for a credit \nline to the PKSF and (ii) a TA grant of $500,000 for building capacity for microenterprise \ndevelopment. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Bangladesh\u2019s economy has been growing at an average 6% during 2000-2017. However, \npoverty is still prevalent\u2014especially in rural areas\u2014and about 24% of the population still lives \nbelow the national poverty line. Promoting the rural nonfarm segment became an important policy \nagenda to generate rural job opportunities and reduce poverty.1 Bangladesh has a mature \nmicrofinance  industry,  which  has  been  financing  the  rural  nonfarm  segment,  including \nmicroenterprises.2 Microfinance is now a major funding source for microenterprises and has great \npotential to contribute to rural nonfarm segment-led growth in Bangladesh. \n \n4.  Microfinance industry in Bangladesh. Microfinance is defined as financial services, \nincluding savings and credit, to poor or low-income people who have no access to formal financial \nservices. Bangladesh\u2019s microfinance industry started in the 1970s to reduce poverty by providing \nmicrocredit, mainly for rural nonfarm activities. Early pioneer MFIs, including Grameen Bank and \nBRAC, provided loans based on a group guarantee using funding provided by the Government of \nBangladesh, development partners, and donors. \n \n5.  Today,  Bangladesh\u2019s microfinance  industry  has  an  extensive  outreach  of  758  MFIs \nservicing 30 million clients.3 The industry is regulated by the Microcredit Regulatory Authority \n(MRA) under the Microcredit Regulatory Authority Act, 2006. In 2017, MFIs disbursed with total \nloans outstanding of Tk770 billion. The industry maintains a good portfolio and had a 98% \nrecovery rate in 2017.4 \n \n6.  Traditionally, MFIs provide group-based microcredit to their members to finance cottage-\nsize rural income-generating activities. However, as Bangladesh\u2019s economy grows, MFI client \n                                                \n1  The rural nonfarm segment is defined as economic activities in villages, rural towns, and peri-urban areas, excluding \nthe primary production of crops, fish, trees, and livestock. Developing the rural nonfarm segment contributes to \npoverty reduction by fostering backward and forward linkages and creating jobs. \n2  Bangladesh has no unified definition of microenterprises. For this project, a microenterprise is defined as a business \nentity with investment of Tk40,000\u2013Tk1.5 million, excluding land and buildings used by the enterprise. \n3  The share of female entrepreneurs is estimated to comprise about 29% and 56% of the manufacturing and \nagribusiness sectors, respectively. \n4  Credit and Development Forum. 2017. Bangladesh Microfinance Statistics, 2016-17. Dhaka. \n ", "2 \ndemand is gradually shifting from traditional microcredit to larger loans for nonfarm enterprises \n(microenterprise loans). In 2010, the MRA developed rules for MFIs on providing microenterprise \nloans: loans below Tk50,000 are defined as microcredit, while loans above Tk50,000 but below \nTk1 million are considered microenterprise loans. In 2017, MFIs provided microenterprise loans \nto 3.6 million members with total loans outstanding of Tk239 billion. Microenterprise loans \ncomprise more than 31% of the total microfinance industry portfolio. \n \n7.  Microenterprises and their challenges. Microenterprises in Bangladesh are smaller \nthan small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and the size of their investments is too large \nfor traditional microcredit but too small for bank financing.5 Microenterprises can promote private \nsector-led rural economic growth by developing forward linkages and creating self- and wage-\nemployment opportunities, but they face nonfinancial and financial constraints. Nonfinancial \nconstraints include lack of infrastructure facilities and utilities, and inflexible regulations.6 The \nfinancial constraint of limited access to finance is by far the greatest constraint in developing \nmicroenterprises in Bangladesh.7 In addition, women microentrepreneurs face a different set of \nfinancial and nonfinancial constraints, including lack of (i) business management skills, (ii) \nentrepreneurial and technical skills, (iii) start-up finance, (iv) information and access to networking \nsupport, and (v) self-confidence. \n \n8.  Microenterprises are financed largely by informal sources such as individual savings and \ninformal loans from friends and relatives. Institutional credit can play a role, but it has until recently \nbeen marginal. The share of own funds in total microenterprise investments is about 85%, the \nshare of banks is 4%, and MFI financing is 11% in 2015. The overall microenterprise loan \ndemand\u2013supply gap was about Tk437 billion in 2015.8 \n \n9.  Banks and MFIs can be microenterprise financing sources. However, banks are unlikely \nto be a major source, because of (i) banks\u2019 limited knowledge and risk assessment capacity on \nmicroenterprises, (ii) banks\u2019 limited rural branch network and outreach, (iii) banks\u2019 preference for \nlarge  industrial  loans  and  the  high  cost  of  servicing  microenterprise  loans,  and \n(iv) microenterprises\u2019 difficulty in securing valid loan collateral. \n \n10.  While MFIs can be a major source of financing for microenterprises, MFIs\u2019 microenterprise \nloans are not keeping pace with demand because of (i) MFIs\u2019 limited funding sources, (ii) the \nlimited enabling environment for MFIs\u2019 microenterprise operations, and (iii) MFIs\u2019 insufficient \nknowledge and capacity on microenterprise lending. \n \n11.  MFIs depend on donor grants or loans, member savings, and retained earnings as funding \nsources; and do not have sufficient access to other long-term funding. Most MFIs, especially small \nand medium-sized MFIs, have difficulty mobilizing commercial funding sources because of (i) high \n                                                \n5  Bangladesh Bank defines SME loans as loans from Tk50,000 to Tk5 million. For this project, a loan below Tk1 million \nis considered a microenterprise loan and a loan from Tk1 million to Tk5 million is an SME loan. \n6  For nonfinancial constraints, the government\u2019s strategies include, among others, creating an enabling environment \nfocusing on infrastructure, rural electrification, gas connection, better physical and electronic communication \nservices,  education,  training  and  skills  formation,  technological  upgrading,  access  to  market  and  business \ndevelopment services.

Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation. To meet MFIs\u2019 funding needs, the government set up \nthe PKSF in 1990 as a microfinance wholesaler that provides loans to POs. The PKSF is \nregistered as a not-for-profit company under the Companies Act, 1994 (Act No. 18) for poverty \nalleviation through sustainable employment generation. It has 277 POs with loans outstanding of \nTk44 billion in 2017, while loan disbursement totaled Tk31 billion and net income totaled Tk1.9 \nbillion in 2017. The PKSF has been an important funding source for small and medium-sized \nMFIs. Its cumulative loan recovery rate was 99.34% at the end of FY2017.9 \n \n13.  In 2017, client savings, retained earnings, and other funds comprised 77% of total MFI \nfunding, followed by loans from commercial banks (16%) and the PKSF (5%). Funding from other \nsources, including donor funds and other grants, has been declining substantially and made up \nonly 2% of total MFI funding (footnote 4). MFIs are allowed by the MRA to mobilize only member \nsavings  and  not  public  deposits.  The  MRA  Rules  (2010)  also  impose  caps  on  MFIs\u2019 \nmicroenterprise loan volume and the mobilization of member savings. MFI operational guidelines \nare not fully adequate for microenterprise loans, and many MFIs have limited capacity to provide \nsuch loans. \n \n14.  In 2001, the PKSF started a microenterprise program to enable its POs to lend to members \nwho  have  graduated  from  microcredit  and  need  higher  capital  for  investments.  Under  the \nprogram, any business with an investment up to Tk1.5 million, excluding land and buildings, is \nconsidered a microenterprise.10 The PKSF reported that demand for microenterprise loans has \nbeen steadily growing. The number of microenterprise loan end-borrowers from PKSF POs \nincreased from 189,528 in 2010 to 1.15 million at the end of 2017, of whom 70% are women. As \nof July 2017, the PKSF had cumulatively disbursed more than Tk405 billion in microenterprise \nloans to POs, with current loans outstanding of Tk13 billion. PKSF disbursements to POs under \nthe microenterprise program totaled Tk7.5 billion in FY2017. \n \n15.  With current funding levels, however, the PKSF and its POs can meet only part of their \nexisting members\u2019 demand. The PKSF estimates that 2.4 million members of existing POs are \neligible for microenterprise loans. The current average microenterprise loan size to end-borrowers \nis Tk95,000 and is likely to increase as borrowers\u2019 investment size grows. The PKSF projects that \nPOs\u2019 microenterprise loan demand for 2018\u20132022 would total Tk107 billion, but its internal \nonlending resources would be limited to Tk74 billion. This means the PKSF needs at least Tk33 \nbillion for 2018\u20132022 just to meet existing POs\u2019 microenterprise loan demand.11 Thereby, this \nproject would contribute approximately 13% of PKSF\u2019s funding gap. \n \n16.  Proposed solution. The government considers the PKSF\u2019s access to affordable long-\nterm funding as indispensable to solving microenterprise financing constraints. ADB will provide \na loan to ease mostly short-term microenterprise financing. The loan will be provided to the PKSF \nfor lending to POs based on eligibility criteria for further sub-lending to microenterprises. \n \n17.  The project design takes into account lessons from related ADB operations which highlight \nthe need to strengthen subproject performance monitoring and risk management measures, and \n                                                \n9  Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation. http://www.pksf-bd.org.  \n10 The PKSF has its own definition for microenterprises, but MFIs normally identify microenterprises by loan size. \n11 For 2010\u20132017, the PKSF\u2019s microenterprise loan disbursement grew 20% per year on average. With external \nsources of funding, the PKSF estimates microenterprise loan demand to grow 33% per year during 2018\u20132022. \n ", "4 \nemphasizes support for female entrepreneurs (footnote 16). For medium- to long-term solutions, \nthe project will assist the PKSF and its POs in enhancing their capacity in microenterprise lending \nand promoting sustainable operations (para. 23). Through the attached TA, the project will support \nthe PKSF and its POs in expanding MFIs\u2019 microenterprise development services (para. 35). The \nproject will also espouse gender equity and target a loan portfolio with at least 70% women \nborrowers (paras. 21, 43). \n \n18.  Value added by ADB assistance. The project\u2019s key value addition is to transform PKSF \nand POs towards a more market oriented financing institutions. MFIs are rapidly expanding their \nmicroenterprise  portfolios  but  lack  essential  skills  to  make  enterprise  loans.  The  size  of \nmicroenterprise loans is considerably larger than traditional microcredit; and MFIs need to be \nequipped with appropriate risk assessment, credit appraisal, and financial management skills for \nmicroenterprise  finance.  The  project  will  also  strengthen  MFIs\u2019  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard monitoring by installing an environmental and social screening system at the PKSF \nand its POs. Furthermore, the project will bring a technology innovation in POs by introducing a \npilot mobile-based microenterprise financing application (para. 24).  \n \n19.  Alignment of the Government and ADB Strategies. The project is aligned with the \ngovernment\u2019s National Sustainable Development Strategy, 2010-2021, which promotes micro, \nsmall, and medium-sized enterprise to generate job opportunities.12 ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy  for  Bangladesh,  2016\u20132020  identifies  improving  rural  livelihoods  and  expanding \nemployment opportunities as key priority areas.13 The project is based on ADB\u2019s successful \nexperience in microfinance and SMEs, including projects with the PKSF.14  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n20.  The project is aligned with the following impact: growth of microenterprises expanded to \nprovide forward linkages to agriculture and generate job opportunities.15 The project will have the \nfollowing outcome: microenterprises\u2019 access to MFI financing increased.16 \n \nC.  Outputs  \n \n21.  Output 1: Funding to microfinance institutions for microenterprise loans expanded. \nThis output will provide a credit line to the PKSF for onlending to POs to ease short-term \nmicroenterprise financing constraints. It aims to provide loans to 40,000 microentrepreneurs, of \nwhom 70% are female.17 The typical onlending rate is 5.0%\u20137.5% per year from the PKSF to POs \n                                                \n12 Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2013.

The project will make sure that the POs have onlending rates that \nare adequate to cover all costs and risks associated with onlending, have an adequate margin, \nand comply with MRA regulations.  \n \n22.  To address medium-term financing constraints, the output will support the development of \na medium-term institutional strengthening and financing strategy for the PKSF. The strategy will \ninclude enhancing the PKSF\u2019s policies, risk assessment, due diligence, and financial and portfolio \nmanagement and monitoring; and assessing the feasibility of diversifying funding sources. \n \n23.  Output 2: Microfinance institutions\u2019 capacity in microenterprise lending enhanced. \nThe output will enhance MFI capacity in microenterprise lending by improving microenterprise \nfinance  operational  guidelines  for  MFIs.  The  guidelines  will  have  methodologies  for  credit \nappraisal, pricing, terms and conditions, and financial and portfolio management and monitoring \nof MFIs\u2019 microenterprise finance operations, including risk management. Improvement of the \nguidelines will be followed by training for the PKSF\u2019s POs. \n \n24.  For selected POs, a pilot mobile-based microenterprise financing application will be \nimplemented for activities such as loan application, appraisal, disbursement, and collection. For \nthe pilot project, support will include legal and regulatory consultation, application development \nor adoption, guidelines and manual development, and PO and client training. \n \n25.  Output  3:  Microfinance  institutions\u2019  microenterprise  development  support \nextended. The output will support microenterprises\u2019 access to wider and upscale markets. It will \nidentify promising microenterprise products for potential expansion and support microenterprise \ncluster development by assisting in quality control, branding, packaging, and marketing.19 Priority \nwill be given to female microenterprise borrowers. The output will also support e-commerce \nplatform development for microenterprises. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n26.  The project is estimated to cost $62.5 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM). \nThe summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the credit line. Additional financing \ncould be considered upon timely liquidation of the full loan amount. \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates ($ million) \nItems  Amount   \n   Credit line  50.0   \n  Microenterprise contributiona  12.5   \nTotal       62.5   \na  Microenterprise borrowers must contribute at least 20% of total investments from their own sources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n                                                \n18 Because of the high operational cost in serving many small borrowers, microfinance interest rates are high. In South \nAsia, microfinance interest rates are 20%\u201330% per year. The global average microfinance interest rate is about 35% \n(C. Kneiding and R. Rosenberg. 2008. Variations in Microcredit Interest Rates. CGAP Brief. Washington, DC: \nConsultative Group to Assist the Poor). \n19 Under cluster development, microenterprises that produce similar products will be formed into groups and provided \nassistance in quality improvement, branding, and marketing for better quality and higher quantity production. \n ", "6 \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan)  50.0  80.0 \nMicroenterprise contributiona  12.5  20.0 \nTotal  62.5  100.0 \na  Microenterprise borrowers must contribute at least 20% of total investments from their own sources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n27.  The government has requested a regular loan of $50 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based on the straight-line \nmethod, the average maturity is 12.75 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \n28.  ADB will disburse the loan proceeds following its Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as \namended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed between the government and \nADB. The advance fund procedure will be used based on the estimate of the eligible expenditures \nfor the forthcoming 6 months. To make sure that the ADB loan is used for its intended purpose, \nthe PKSF will maintain all POs\u2019 sub-borrower records. In addition, the PKSF and all POs funded \nunder the project will submit an audited statement of utilization of funds. \n \n29.  Relending. The government will relend the ADB loan proceeds to the PKSF in local \ncurrency at ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based interest rate plus 0.75% per year and a maturity of 20 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, under a subsidiary loan agreement. The government will bear \nthe foreign exchange risks. \n \n30.  Onlending. The PKSF will onlend to selective POs for financing eligible microenterprise \nborrowers. Onlending rates from the PKSF to POs are 7.5% per year for POs with total loans \noutstanding above Tk1.0 billion; 6.0% for POs with total loans outstanding of Tk0.5 billion\u2013Tk1.0 \nbillion; and 5.0% for POs with total loans outstanding below Tk0.5 billion. PKSF loans to POs will \nhave a 3-year maturity, including a 6-month grace period. \n \n31.  Sub-lending.  POs  will  finance  their  member  microenterprise  borrowers.  Loans  to \nmicroenterprise borrowers range from Tk50,000 to Tk1 million; the maturity will mostly be less \nthan 1 year but can be up to 2 years. The repayment schedule will depend on the cash flow \npattern of microenterprises. The maximum interest rate for the sub-loan is 25% per year based \non a declining balance.20 The loans repaid by POs will be maintained at the microenterprise fund \naccount established at PKSF. PKSF will onlend to POs with the same onlending terms and \nconditions by PKSF. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n32.  The Financial Institutions Division (FID) of the Ministry of Finance will be the executing \nagency and the PKSF will be the implementing agency. A project steering committee will be \nformed by the government comprising the Economic Relations Division and Finance Division of \nthe Ministry of Finance, the FID, the PKSF, and other relevant stakeholders. The steering \ncommittee will monitor and supervise overall project implementation and provide guidance on \n                                                \n20 A declining balance interest rate is calculated based on the outstanding principal loan amount. \n ", "7 \nmajor  project  implementation  issues.  The  FID  will  provide  guidance  on  day-to-day  project \nimplementation matters to the project implementation unit (PIU). \n \n33.  The PIU will be established at the PKSF. It will be led by a project coordinator and will \nhave at least one full-time staff whose qualifications are satisfactory to ADB. The PIU will \nimplement and monitor project implementation, coordinate with TA consultants, and report project \nprogress to the Economic Relations Division, Finance Division, FID and ADB. \n \n34.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM.21 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2019\u2013December 2020 \nEstimated completion date  December 2020 \nEstimated loan closing date  March 2021a \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  FID secretary in the Ministry of Finance (Chair) \nERD representative in the Ministry of Finance (member)  \nFD representative in the Ministry of Finance (member) \nFID representative (member)  \nPKSF representative (member) \nOther relevant stakeholders (member) \n(ii)  Executing agency  FID \n(iii)  Implementing agency  PKSF \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Project implementation unit, three staff under the supervision of the PKSF deputy \nmanaging director \nConsulting services  Individual consultant  9 person-months  $484,000 \nselection \n  Firm: quality- and cost-  16 person-months \nbased selection (90:10) \nDisbursement  ADB will disburse the loan proceeds following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n35.  The transaction TA will assist the PKSF and its POs in enhancing their capacity in \nmicroenterprise lending and promoting their sustainable operations. Its outcome and outputs align \nwith  the  loan.  The  TA  will  support  (i)  developing  the  PKSF\u2019s  medium-term  institutional \nstrengthening  and  financing  strategy  and  building  capacity  at  the  PKSF,  (ii)  improving \nmicroenterprise finance operational guidelines for MFIs and providing MFI training, (iii) initiating \na pilot mobile-based microenterprise financing application for selected POs, (iv) supporting \nmicroenterprise cluster development, and (v) developing a microenterprise e-commerce platform. \n \n36.  The TA will require inputs from the following international experts: technical advisor for  \nMicroenterprise Development Project (3 person-months), microenterprise finance specialist (3 \nperson-months), and e-commerce specialist (3 person-months); and from the following national \nexperts:  mobile  microfinance  specialist  (6  person-months),  microenterprise  development \n                                                \n21 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nspecialist (4 person-months), and financial analysis specialist (6 person-months). Procurement \nwill follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated \nstaff  instructions.  ADB  will  procure  consulting  services  using  open  competitive  bidding \nprocedures. \n \n37.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Partnership  Special  Fund.22  The  PKSF  will  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. Disbursement \nwill follow ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). The TA will be implemented over 2 years. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n38.  ADB assessed the selected POs\u2019 technical capacity to make microenterprise loans. POs \nhave dedicated staff and established procedures for loan appraisal, loan sanction, and portfolio \nmonitoring and reporting for microenterprise loans. Further support to improve MFI capacity for \nmicroenterprise financing is needed, however, particularly for client due diligence, credit risk \nassessment, portfolio monitoring, and the management information system. For this, the project \nwill support the PKSF and its POs through the attached TA. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n39.  The project will directly benefit at least 40,000 microenterprises in Bangladesh, of which \n70% are female borrowers, by providing a reliable and affordable institutional source of finance. \nIn doing so, the project greatly economizes the beneficiaries\u2019 fund costs and promotes the efficient \nallocation of finance, thus yielding a higher rate of return from the beneficiaries\u2019 microenterprise \ninvestments.23 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n40.  ADB requirements and policies on financial management and procurement measures, and \nenvironmental and social safeguards, were discussed and agreed with the government and the \nPKSF and incorporated in the project design. The specific requirements are described in the PAM. \nProcurement of goods, works, and non-consultancy services will follow the ADB Procurement \nPolicy and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to \ntime). Procurement will be undertaken by the individual beneficiary; fitness for purpose can be \nachieved by using established private sector and commercial practices. \n \n41.  The financial management risk is moderate. Based on financial due diligence, the PKSF \nneeds to strengthen its capacity particularly its management information system. The financial \nmanagement assessment, which includes a financial analysis of POs, indicated that the PKSF \nhas  sufficient  experience  in  managing  similar  projects  for  ADB  and  other  international \ndevelopment partners and has the necessary financial management arrangements. The PKSF\u2019s \nPOs, however, potentially have key financial management risks, such as (i) insufficient quality of \n                                                \n22 Established by ADB.

The project provides cost-efficient and reliable access \nto finance for the beneficiaries. \n ", "9 \nPOs\u2019 audit and financial statements, and (ii) inadequate POs\u2019 portfolio management practices. \nThe attached TA will address these issues. \n \n42.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  PKSF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n43.  The project is expected to have a tangible employment generation impact on the poor and \nlow-income population by establishing and expanding microenterprises. The estimated monthly \nincome of microenterprise workers in manufacturing, processing, or services ranges from Tk4,000 \nfor part-time workers to Tk15,000 for full-time workers.24 Considering Bangladesh\u2019s per capita \ngross national income in FY2017 was Tk127,401, the project is expected to contribute to poverty \nreduction by increasing rural household incomes.25 The project has a strong focus on developing \nwomen-led  microenterprises  and  will  develop  MFI  capacity  in  conducting  women-focused \nmicroenterprise financing. The project is classified gender equity as a theme.26 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n44.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows: 27 \n \n45.  Environment (category FI treated as C). The project is expected to have minimal \nenvironmental impact since sub-loans to microenterprises will be mainly for light manufacturing, \ntrade, and service activities. \n \n46.  Involuntary resettlement (category FI treated as C). Only sub-loans not requiring any \ninvoluntary resettlement will be financed.  \n \n47.  Tribes, minor races, ethnic sects and communities (category FI treated as C). Sub-\nloans are for activities that will not have any impact on tribes, minor races, ethnic sects and \ncommunities.28 \n \n48.  The PKSF has developed environmental and social screening guidelines for POs, which \nwere agreed by ADB. Subproject screening will be mandatory for implementation by all POs to \nbe financed under the project, and POs will report on the status of the screening checklist to ADB \nthrough the PKSF. The POs will \n(i)  screen all subprojects to be financed under the project to ensure compliance with \ngovernment regulations, project legal agreements, the PAM, and environmental \nand social screening guidelines; and \n                                                \n24 International Fund for Agricultural Development. 2016.

ASSURANCES \n \n50.  The government and the PKSF have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n51.  The government and the PKSF have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the draft loan agreement and project agreement. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n52.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $50,000,000 \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Microenterprise Development Project, from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 20 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n31 October 2018\n                                                \n29 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nGrowth of microenterprises expanded to provide forward linkages to agriculture and generate job \nopportunities (National Sustainable Development Strategy, 2010\u20132021)a \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselinesb  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By December 2020     \nMicroenterprises\u2019  Microenterprise borrowers of the  PKSF annual reports,  Restrictive \naccess to MFI  PKSF\u2019s POs increased by 40,000, of  executing and/or  government \nfinancing  whom at least 70% are female (end- implementing agency\u2019s  policy change \nincreased  2017 baseline: 1.15 million, of whom  project completion report  on microfinance \n70% are women)  may hinder the \ngrowth of \nmicroenterprise \nlending. \nOutputs  By December 2020     \n1.
