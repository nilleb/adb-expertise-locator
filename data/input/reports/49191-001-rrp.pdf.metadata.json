It will restore critical \nphysical  infrastructure  to  sustain  livelihoods  and  access  to  markets,  as  well  as  build  post-\ndisaster traffic management capacity in the National Highway Authority (NHA). The project will \ncontribute  to  the  economic  recovery  of  2010  flood  affected  areas  in  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa, \nPunjab, and Sindh provinces. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nPakistan\u2019s  transport  sector  contributes  about  10%  to  the  country\u2019s  gross  domestic \n3. \nproduct, accounts for about 35% of total energy consumption annually, and receives 20%\u201325% \nof  the  annual  federal  public  sector  development  program.  It  provides  an  estimated  2.3  million \njobs  (5.9%  of  the  employed  labor  force).  Although  comprising  less  than  5%  of  the  total  road \nnetwork (about 263,000 km), the national highway network (about 12,500 km) caters to 80% of \ncommercial  traffic. 2  Despite  the  high  reliance  on  road  transport\u2014accounting  for  92%  of \npassenger  traffic  and  96%  of  freight  traffic  in  Pakistan\u2014the  quality  of  the  road  infrastructure \ncauses severe capacity constraints. \n \n4. \nBefore  1995,  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  to  Pakistan  had  focused  on \nimprovement  of  rural  access  roads  to  complement  ADB\u2019s  then  focus  on  agriculture  sector \ndevelopment. From 1995, the perspective was expanded to national connectivity for economic \ngrowth in general, covered provincial and national highways. Since 2005, ADB assistance has \nfocused on the trade corridor and regional connectivity, and two multitranche financing facilities \nprovided in 2005 and 2007 were designed for key trade corridors connecting seaports, industrial \ncenters, and border crossing points.3 \n \n5. \nIn  parallel,  ADB  has  supported  the  government  in  addressing  institutional  constraints. \nADB\u2019s program loan provided in 2001 for the national sector policy reform program assisted the \nNHA  in  implementing  reform  programs  covering  (i)  transport  policy,  (ii)  road  sector  resource \nmanagement, (iii) road sector preservation, (iv) institutional efficiency improvement, and (v) road \nsafety.4 Through  such  reforms,  the  NHA  has  managed  to  (i)  establish  the  road  maintenance \nfund for stable road maintenance expenditure; (ii) establish the road asset management system, \nto  prioritize  scarce  resources;  (iii)  establish the  National  Highway  and  Motorway  Police,  which \ncontributes  to  controlling  overloading,  and  thus  reduce  premature  deterioration  of  highways; \n(iv) promote awareness on road safety; and (v) explore public\u2013private partnerships. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nHowever, sector reforms should continue, particularly to address (i) the shortfall in road \n6. \nmaintenance  resources  (by  expanding  the  toll  base  and  rationalizing  the  toll  rates); \n(ii) overloading (through modernizing the aging truck fleet with emphasis on high-capacity, multi-\naxle trucks); (iii) road safety (through concerted national and provincial efforts); and (iv) public\u2013\nprivate  partnership  (by  reducing  the  country  risk  for  private  investors  to  price  it  properly). \nIn November  2015,  ADB  approved  capacity  development technical  assistance of  $15.4 million \nto Pakistan as part of the Government of the United Kingdom\u2019s assistance through the Pakistan \nEconomic Corridors Program5 to help strengthen transport facilitation for cross-border transport, \nadvance the national road safety program, develop a national transport policy and master plan, \nand scale up road asset management. \n \n7. \nThe challenges faced by the transport sector have been exacerbated by the increasing \nfrequency  and  severity  of  natural  hazard  events,  and  the  potential  impact  of  climate  change. \nSince the 2000s, Pakistan has repeatedly been hit by a series of heavy monsoon rains, which \ncaused  severe  flooding  in  nearly  all  parts  of  the  country.  Lowlands  around  the  Indus  River \nbasin, the  Chenab  and Jhelum rivers,  and  along the  coastline  were  the  most  heavily  affected. \nSevere flooding not only caused death and displacement of people but also destroyed property, \nlivelihoods,  and  infrastructure\u2014particularly  transport  infrastructure.  These  natural  disasters \npose new challenges to the NHA, which is already challenged by insufficient resources for road \nnetwork  development  and  maintenance.  As  a  result,  it  has  become  difficult  to  pursue  the \nnationwide road network development strategy and sector reforms consistently since planning is \nfrequently  disrupted  by  the  need  to  provide  scarce  financial  and  human  resources  for \nemergency  recovery  of  damaged  road  networks  in  fragile  flood-hit  areas.  ADB\u2019s  timely \nemergency  assistance  to  the  government  was,  in  most  cases,  instrumental  in  rehabilitating \ndestroyed property, and enabling communities to restore livelihoods. \n \n8. \nThe  2010  floods  were  the  worst  in  Pakistan\u2019s  history,  affecting  100,000  square \nkilometers and 20 million people (more than a tenth of the country\u2019s population). They resulted \nin  1,800  deaths  and  caused  an  estimated  $10  billion  in  total  damage.  Immediately  after  the \nfloods  subsided,  the  government  started  the  early  recovery  and  restoration  of  basic  services, \nhousing,  and  livelihoods.  Basic  transport  infrastructure  and  irrigation  facilities  were  also  badly \ndamaged in 80 of the country\u2019s 110 districts across Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, \nand  Sindh.  According to  the  damage and  needs  assessment report  prepared by  ADB  and  the \nWorld Bank in conjunction with federal and provincial government agencies, 793 km of national \nhighways  (7%  of  the  national  highway  network)  were  identified  as  requiring  immediate \nrehabilitation to ensure their stability and public safety.6 \n \n9. \nIn  2011,  ADB  approved  the  Flood  Emergency  Reconstruction  Project  in the  amount  of \n$650  million  to  assist  the  government  in  the  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  national \nhighways,  provincial  roads,  irrigation  and  drainage,  and  flood  protection  infrastructure. 7 \nThe  emergency  reconstruction  project  became  effective  on  26  May  2011  and  was  closed  on \n25  May  2015.  The  project  was originally  intended to  rehabilitate  793 km of  national  highways, \nas identified by the damage and needs assessment report (which classified 383 km as partially \ndamaged  and 410 km  as fully  damaged).  Upon completion of  the  detailed survey  and design, \nhowever,  the  affected  length  of national  highways was expanded  to  1,044 km  and  46 bridges. \n\n                                                \n5  ADB.  2015.

The  reduced  scope  of  the  project  (i.e.,  344  km)  was \ncompleted  when the  loan was closed on  25  May  2015.8 The  NHA, through its  own  resources, \nis financing the reconstruction and/or repair of an additional 97 km. \n \nThe  government  has  not  been  able  to  secure  funding  for  the  remaining  212  km  of \n10. \ndamaged highway sections and 33 bridges, which should be rehabilitated immediately to avoid \nfurther damage and safety hazard. These roads and bridges are the only transport links for the \nlocal  population,  which  is  being  temporarily  served  through  makeshift  arrangements,  such  as \nBailey bridges. ADB\u2019s post-flood assistance for the remaining 212 km of the damaged sections \nof the highways and 33 bridges will (i) expedite the economic and social recovery of the affected \npopulation from the floods and provide greater resilience to future floods, and (ii) ensure that the \nfull  development  impact  of  the  emergency  reconstruction  project  is  achieved  and  that  ADB\u2019s \nintervention  is  effective.  Apart  from  the  recovery  of  damaged  road  infrastructure,  the  NHA\u2019s \ncapacity  to  cope  with  such  natural  disasters  and  manage  a  quicker  response  for  the  early \nrestoration  of  traffic  and  subsequent  reconstruction  and/or  rehabilitation  activities  needs \nstrengthening.  Currently,  NHA  personnel  perform  this  role  on  an  ad  hoc  basis,  without \nmonitoring tools and specialized training in the management of road infrastructure in emergency \nsituations.  The  NHA\u2019s  disaster  management  capacity  needs  upgrading  to  be  systematic, \nprogrammatic, and responsive. \n \nApart  from  its  interventions  in  road  infrastructure  development  in  Pakistan,  ADB  has \n11. \nbeen active in post-natural-disaster emergency recovery initiatives in the country. In 2005, ADB \nsupported  the  government\u2019s  reconstruction  efforts  after  the  October  2005  earthquake  through \nan emergency loan, grant, and technical assistance grant.9 In 2011 and 2015, ADB assisted the \ngovernment\u2019s  reconstruction  efforts  after  the  2010  and  2014  floods.10 ADB  gained  valuable \nexperience  in  implementing  loans  in  response  to  natural  disasters  through  these  projects, \nincluding  (i)  designing  projects  with  a  manageable  number  of  components  and  implementing \nagencies,  (ii)  ensuring  counterpart  funding  capacity  and  soundness  of  project  costing,  and \n(iii) adopting realistic time frames for land acquisition and resettlement activities. \n \n12. \nThe rehabilitation project will restore critical physical infrastructure to sustain livelihoods \nand access to markets, as well as build capacity in the NHA by (i) providing specialized training \nto its operations staff for the efficient management of traffic restoration and post-natural-disaster \nreconstruction activities, and (ii) operationalizing DMUs. As a highway infrastructure project, it is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  202011 and  country  partnership  strategy, \n\n                                                \n8  Less 2 km under subproject ICB-N-03: Rehabilitation of Kohala\u2013Muzaffarabad Road Package-1, for which work is \n\nongoing, as a result of subsequent damage during the 2014 floods. \n\n9  ADB.  2005.

The outcome will be efficient and safe movement of traffic on \nthe national highways and efficient management of traffic restoration in emergencies. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n14. \nThe outputs will include (i) 212 km of national highway network (and 33 bridges) repaired \nand rehabilitated, and (ii) DMUs established (in head office and 10 regional offices) and 15 DMU \nstaff  trained  on  post-disaster  traffic  management.  These  outputs  will  restore  critical  physical \ninfrastructure to sustain livelihoods and access to markets, as well as build post-disaster traffic \nmanagement capacity in the NHA. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n15. \nThe project is estimated to cost $218.8 million (Table 1).

The design speed is 80\u2013110 km per hour in plain terrain with a maximum grade of \n3%,  and  40\u201360  km  per  hour  in  hilly  terrain  with  a  maximum  grade  of  8%.  The  scope  of \nconstruction  work  includes  earthwork  and  pavement  works,  and  roadside  improvements  and \nsafety engineering features, such as traffic signs, road markings, traffic barriers, and guard rails. \nIn addition, slope protection works, as and where required, will be carried out. For the proposed \nhighway sections, the detailed design of road pavement, road geometrics, and bridge structures \nhas  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  acceptable  international  practices,  while  incorporating \nthe  build  back  better  concept.  The  pavement  design  is  based  on  the  Transport  Research \nLaboratory\u2019s  Overseas  Road  Note  31. 16  The  geometric  design  is  based  on  the  American \nAssociation  of  State  Highway  and  Transportation  Officials  policy  on  geometric  design  of \nhighways  and  streets.17 Bridges  are  designed  in  accordance  with  the  West  Pakistan  Code  of \nPractice  for  highway  bridges  1967,18 and  conform  to  the  American  Concrete  Institute  Code  of \nPractice.19 \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe  economic  and  financial  analysis  concluded  that  the  rehabilitation  project  is \n23. \neconomically viable, with an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 20%. Economic analysis \nwas  undertaken  at  subproject  level,  with  the  EIRR  estimated  separately  for  the  N-95,  N-55, \nN-15, and N-50 sections. The analysis showed the N-55, N-15, and N-50 sections had EIRRs in \nexcess  of  the  12%  threshold.  The  N-95  is  justified  by  significant  non-monetized  benefits  from \nreduced flood risk and improved resilience to climate change. Sensitivity testing showed that the \nproject is not very sensitive to reasonable changes in demand or investment cost. \n \nThe  rehabilitation  project  is  nonrevenue  earning,  and  an  adequacy  assessment  notes \n24. \nthat  the  NHA  has  the  resources  to  sustain  its  operation  and  management.  The  allocation  for \nroad  maintenance  from  the  federal  budget  has  been  insufficient,  and  while  the  road \nmaintenance  fund  has  provided  stable  contributions,  funding  remains  inadequate.  The  project \nwill help reduce the maintenance expenditure through rehabilitation and capacity enhancement, \ncreating  savings for  the NHA  budget.  At  the same time,  the  NHA\u2019s  planned optimization of  its \ntoll collection would increase the existing road maintenance fund, making the national highway \nand motorway network more sustainable in the long term. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n25. \nA  financial  management  assessment  of  the  NHA,  carried  out  in  May  2015,  confirmed \nthat it has sufficient capacity to manage and maintain the accounting systems, financial controls, \nand audit arrangements required for the project. The NHA\u2019s financial accounting, auditing rules, \nand  internal  control  systems  follow  generally  accepted  international  accounting  and  auditing \npractices.  The  NHA  maintains  separate  project  records  and  accounts  to  identify  the  works, \nloan  proceeds,  financing  resources  received, \ngoods,  and  services  financed  from  the \nexpenditures incurred for the project, and use of counterpart funds, including adequate internal \ncontrols  and  financial  reporting  arrangements.  The  project  accounts  and  related  financial \nstatements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  national  and  international  auditing \nstandards by the Auditor General of Pakistan and by an independent chartered accountant firm. \n\n                                                \n16 Overseas Centre, Transport Research Laboratory. 1993.

To mitigate these risks, advance procurement has been sought and a loan-financed \nprocurement  consultant  will  be  recruited  to  assist  the  NHA  in  overcoming  any  delays. \nThe procurement consultant will assist in the timely preparation of procurement documents and \navoid  delays \nthrough  strong  coordination  between  various  departments.  The  project \nprocurement risk is classified category B. \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  NHA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nPakistan  has  a  33%  national  poverty  rate,  with  21%  of  the  population  living  below  the \n28. \nextreme poverty line.21 Social and gender dimensions of the proposed project are classified as \ngeneral  intervention.  The  project  has  indirect  social  and  poverty  impacts,  so  dedicated  action \nplans will not be required. Based on the review of secondary information and data shared by the \nNHA,  the  proposed  project  will  offer  significant  benefits  for  the  affected  population,  including \nsafety in mobility, lowered transportation costs, reduced travel time, reduced transportation time \nfor edible and perishable agriculture products, and increased returns from the tourism industry. \nThe  project  will  offer  significant  employment  opportunities  in  construction  and  other  related \nservices. The project will improve the quality of post-disaster response and provide immediate \nrelief to local commuters and the public in case of future flooding. \n \n29. \nThe  project  does  not  offer  direct  gender  benefits.  Given  better  connectivity  and \nincreased  access  to  social  services,  such  as  health,  education,  and  other  economic \nopportunities,  the  proposed  project  will  indirectly  benefit  women  and  girls.  According to  ADB\u2019s \ngender mainstreaming guidelines, the project is classified as no gender elements and does not \nrequire  a  gender  action  plan.  However,  the  project  will  undertake  certain  measures  during \nproject  implementation  to  ensure  that  women\u2019s  issues  and  concerns  are  addressed  and  that \nwomen are not adversely impacted.22 \n \n30. \nThe  HIV  prevalence  rate  in  the  country  is  0.10%.  However,  the  potential  risks  of \nincreased  transmission  of  HIV  and  other  sexually  transmitted  infections  and/or  communicable \ndiseases  are  always  a  concern.  The  main  modes  of  HIV  transmission  include  sexual \ntransmission, unsafe blood transfusion, and intravenous drug use. Information about the risks of \nspreading  HIV  has  not  been  widely  disseminated,  and  practices  related  to  blood  transfusion \nscreening  and  intravenous  drug  use  are  also  not  well  regulated,  particularly  in  rural  areas. \nWhile there is no evidence suggesting that the project will increase HIV incidence during or after \nimplementation, any associated risks will be minimized through awareness campaigns targeting \nconstruction  workers  and  local  populations.  The  contractor  will  conduct  the  campaigns,  with \n\n                                                \n20 ADB.  2015.

An \n\n31. \nThe  project  is  classified  category  C  for  both  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous \npeoples. Due diligence performed during the fact-finding mission confirmed that (i) the proposed \nsections  of  the  national  highways  and  33  bridges  fall  within  the  existing  right-of-way  (ROW) \nowned by the NHA; and (ii) detailed designs have been completed and reviewed by the NHA\u2019s \ndesign review consultants, based on which new land acquisition is not expected for bridges (to \nbe constructed within the existing ROW) or for the carriageway of the highway sections. \n \nA  follow-up  due  diligence  review  conducted  by  ADB  and  the  NHA  in  December  2015 \n32. \nconfirmed that while there are some encroachments to the ROW in a few sections of the roads \nand  bridges  to  be  rehabilitated,  impacts  on  these  structures  can  be  avoided  with  minor \nadjustments  to  the  rehabilitation  works  similar  to  the  approach  taken  under  the  emergency \nreconstruction  project.  Such  flexibility  will  be  indicated  in  the  civil  works  contracts  and  will  be \nclosely  monitored  during  implementation  by  a  resettlement  specialist  to  be  engaged  by  the \nPMU.  The  NHA  has  prepared  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  as  an  additional \nsafeguard measure in case of unforeseen impacts during project implementation. \n \n33. \ninitial  environmental \nexamination  study  has  been  performed  to  meet  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) and new national legal requirements, which was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website \non  26  October  2015.  Climate  change  risks  and mitigation  measures  and  community  concerns \nhave been considered in the project design. The environment of the candidate highway sections \nand bridges is affected. Rehabilitation of these highway sections and bridges will require limited \ncivil works across various sections of the highway alignments. The environmental impacts of the \nrehabilitation  activity,  such  as  soil  erosion,  dust,  and  noise  impacts  will  be  limited  to  the \nconstruction  phase.  The  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  will  include  measures  to \nminimize  anticipated  impacts  during  the  construction  phase.  Prior  to  the  construction  of  each \nroad  section  or  bridge,  contractors  will  update  the  EMP  and  incorporate  it  into  a  site-specific \nenvironmental management plan, which will be based on a risk assessment approach to select \nmitigation  measures  appropriate  for  the  impact  and  site.  The  construction  supervision \nconsultant, the ESU of the NHA, and ADB will closely monitor implementation of the site-specific \nenvironmental  management  plan.  The  NHA  will  submit  semiannual  environmental  monitoring \nreports to ADB for disclosure on the ADB website. \n \n34. \nThe  NHA\u2019s  PMU  and  ESUs  that  worked  on  the  emergency  reconstruction  project  will \nalso be responsible for managing this  project. The units  have full-time  environment  and  social \nsafeguards staff with sufficient experience of and familiarity with the ADB Safeguard Policy, and \nwill  be  assisted  by  a  safeguards  team  from  the  project  supervision  consultants  and  a  loan-\nfinanced individual safeguards consultant. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n35. \nOn  completion,  the  efficient  and  safe  movement  of  traffic  on  the  rehabilitated  project \nsections  will  contribute  to  the  economic  and  social  recovery  of the  affected  population. This  is \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nexpected  to  outweigh  the  cost  of  the  project.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are \nsummarized in Table 4 and detailed in the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \nNHA  has  requested  the  government  to  equitize  the  debt  and  clean  its \nbalance  sheet.
