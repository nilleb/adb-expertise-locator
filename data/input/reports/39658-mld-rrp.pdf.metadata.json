The \nGovernment's  emergency  program  seeks  to  correct  deep-rooted \neconomic  imbalances  and  restore  the  economy  to  a  sustainable \ngrowth  trajectory  over  the  medium  term.  To  achieve  these \nobjectives,  the  Program  will  support  specific  reform  initiatives, \nincluding (i) rationalizing, prioritizing, and aligning public spending \nwith available resources; (ii) broadening the tax base; (iii) reducing \neconomic  subsidies;  (iv)  supporting  privatization  of  state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs); (v) strengthening internal audit functions; and \n(vi)  changing  the  role  of  the  Government  in  the  economy  from  a \nprovider of all services to an enabler of sustainable and equitable \ngrowth. \n \nThe  tsunami  of  late  2004  brought  to  the  fore  some  underlying \nstructural problems in the economy of the Maldives. These include \na  narrow  and  concentrated  economic  base,  an  inelastic  taxation \nsystem,  continued  subsidization  of  social  services,  a  rapidly \ngrowing  civil  service,  and  the  lack  of  a  clear  strategy  for  the \ndivestment and privatization of SOEs. In addition, human resource \ncapacity  constraints,  especially  at  mid  to  low  level,  including \ngovernment functionaries, have made effective implementation of \ndevelopment assistance projects difficult. \n \nThese  structural  constraints  have  weakened  macroeconomic \nfundamentals and made the economy more vulnerable to external \nshocks, including increases in prices of imported food and refined \noil  products.  They  also  have  an  impact  on  the main  driver  of  the \neconomy\u2014tourism.  The  increasing  reliance  on  public  spending, \n\nBorrower \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProgram Description  \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\nissues,  realizes \n\ntogether  with  the  Government's  inability  to  reduce  its  role  in  the \neconomy, has led to a large fiscal deficit (13% of gross domestic \nproduct  [GDP]  in  2008).  To  finance  this  large  deficit,  the \nauthorities have had to resort to monetization of the deficit through \nthe  ways  and  means  advances.  This  has  led  to  additional \npressure  on  inflation,  increases  in  the  real  effective  exchange \nrate,  and  pressure  on  the  currency  peg.  This  process  of \nmonetization  is  also  placing  further  strain  on  Maldives  Monetary \nAuthority's (MMA's) balance sheet. Large current public spending \nhas  led  to  increasing  demand  for  imports\u2014by  virtue  of  the \nopenness  of  the  economy\u2014and  rapid  growth  of  the  current \naccount  deficit  (52%  of  GDP  in  2008),  a  rapid  increase  in  public \ndebt  (54%  of  GDP)  and  increasing  pressure  on  the  international \nreserves position.  \n \nThe Government recognizes the magnitude of the economic crisis \nand has begun reforms to arrest its deteriorating fiscal position. At \nthe  same  time,  it  has  agreed  to  take  further  economic  reform \nmeasures  under  this  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Program \nand under the IMF Stand-By Arrangement \n \nThe  Government,  which  inherited  a  legacy  of  unaddressed \nstructural \nthe  costs  of  delaying  corrective \nmeasures.  It  has  seen  its  net  foreign  exchange  reserves  drop  to \n$53 million at the end of August 2009, a significant increase in the \nfiscal  deficit,  and  a  contraction  of  economic  growth.  Tourism, \nfisheries,  and  construction\u2014the  three  main  drivers  of  economic \ngrowth\u2014have  been  adversely  affected  by  the  global  economic \nslowdown  and  weaknesses  in  domestic  economic  management. \nAccordingly, the country is now in recession, with GDP expected \nto contract by nearly 4% in 2009. \n \nThe  proposed  Program  will  support  recovery  and  sustainable \ngrowth  of  the  economy  over  the  medium  term  by  removing  the \ndistortions  that  have  led  to  the  large  economic  imbalances.  By \nsupporting long overdue structural reforms, the Program will move \ntoward  a  more  broad-based  and  sustainable  development \nframework  that  reduces  the  country's  vulnerability  to  external \nshocks  and  prepares  it  for  scheduled  graduation  by  the  United \nNations to middle-income country status on 1 January 2011.  \n \nThe  key  end-of-program  outcomes  of  the  Program  will  be  the \ncreation  of  greater  fiscal  space  in  the  Government  budget  by \ndiversifying the tax base and rationalizing expenditures, improving \ndebt management, and enhancing the privatization of SOEs. The \nissuance  of  Treasury  bills  and  bonds  will  deepen  the  financial \nmarket  (given  that  the  Government  and  the  MMA  have  reached \nan agreement that the deficit will no longer be monetized, but will \nbe financed by open-market operations of the MMA). \n \nSpecific  outcomes  of  the  Program  include  (i)  improved  fiscal \n\n\frationalization; \n\nin  support  of  various \n\ndiscipline and predictability; (ii) enhanced value of the budget as a \npolicy tool; (iii) synchronization of the budget preparation process \nwith  available  resources;  (iv)  diversification  of  the  tax  base; \n(v) expenditure \n(vi)  better  monitoring  and \nmanagement of internal and external debt; (vii) a sounder footing \nfor  Government  finance,  avoiding  inflationary  domestic  finance; \n(viii)  deeper  financial  markets  through  the  issuance  of  Treasury \nbills  and  bonds,  and  provision  of  a  market-based  instrument  for \nliquidity management to MMA; (ix) better project management and \ndevelopment effectiveness; (x) a transparent privatization process \nfor SOEs; and (xi) a stronger internal audit mechanism.   \n \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR21,912,000  ($35  million  equivalent)  from  ADB's  Special \nFunds resources. The loan will have a term of 24 years, including \na  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  an  interest  charge  of  1.0%  per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n \nADB  will  also  provide  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  package  of \n$4.5 million  in  support  of  the  Program.  This  will  consist  of  (i)  TA \ninstitutional \ngrant  of  $3.0  million \nstrengthening initiatives, from ADB's Technical Assistance Special \nFund  (TASF-IV),  and  (ii)  a  TA  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent to SDR939,000 ($1.5 million equivalent), for supporting \ncapacity  development  and  privatization  initiatives,  from  ADB's \nSpecial  Funds  resources,  which  will  have  a  term  of  32 years, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  an  interest  charge  of \n1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter.  \n \nThe Program will be completed by December 2012. The loan will \nbe  released \ntranches\u2014SDR11,269,028  ($18  million \nequivalent)  upon  effectiveness  of  the  loan  and  fulfillment  of \nagreed  conditions  for  the  first  tranche,  and  SDR10,642,972  ($17 \nmillion equivalent), which is expected to be disbursed 18 months \nafter  loan  effectiveness  upon  satisfactory  fulfillment  of  agreed \nconditions for the second tranche (or earlier than 18 months if the \nconditions  have  been  met).  ADB  will  monitor  the  progress  of  the \nProgram at regular intervals.  \n \nMinistry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT)  \n \nA  steering  committee  will  be  responsible  for  overall  coordination, \nimplementation,  monitoring,  and  policy  approvals.  It  will  be \ninclude \nchaired  by \nrepresentatives \nthe  President's  Office,  Privatization \nCommittee,  MMA,  and  senior  officials  from  MOFT  (including  the \nheads  of  Public  Enterprise  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Board, \nInternal Audit Unit, Budget Division, Debt Division, Department of \nInland Revenue, and Department of National Planning). ADB will \nparticipate in the committee as an observer.  \n\nthe  state  minister  of  MOFT  and  will \n\nfrom \n\ntwo \n\nin \n\niii \n\n \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nProgram Period and \nTranching \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n\fiv \n\n \nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\n \nProgram Benefits \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nincluding  portfolio  performance \n\n \nConsultants  to  be  financed  from  the  TA  loan  and  grant  will  be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Consultancy \ncontract  packages  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod  and  consultants  qualification  selection  will  be  utilized  for \nselection of consultants, based on technical proposals, for specific \nsubcomponents.  Procurement  of  any  goods  or  services  shall  be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nThe  Program  is  expected  to  result  in  higher  tax  collection  and \nbetter expenditure management systems that, combined with the \ndivestment  and  privatization  of  SOEs,  should  lead  to  a  reduction \nin  economic  imbalances,  including  fiscal  and  current  account \ndeficits,  and  improvements  in  macroeconomic  management.  The \nProgram is also expected to lead to better resource management \nfrom  domestic  and  external  sources.  In  particular,  over  the \nmedium  term,  it  is  expected  that  the  apex  project  management \nunit  (PMU)  at  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury  and  two \nthematic  project  management  units  (TPMUs)  at  the  Ministry  of \nHousing,  Transport  and  Environment,  and  Ministry  of  Economic \nDevelopment,  respectively,  will  improve  the  project  performance \nratios, \nthereby \nimproving aid effectiveness.  \n \nStrengthening  the  macroeconomic  profile,  improving  alignment \nbetween  development  spending  and  sector  priorities  and \nprograms,  introducing  new  taxes,  rationalizing  expenditures,  and \nprogressing  toward  divestment  and  privatization  of  SOEs  will \nexpand  the  economic  base  and  support  more  broad-based \neconomic  growth.  The  Program  will  equip  government  agencies \nwith modern analytical tools to manage the development process, \nfacilitate  an  inflow  of  foreign  direct  investment,  and  smooth \nMaldives' transition to middle-income country status.  \n \nThere  are  many  risks  to  the  effective  implementation  of  the \nProgram.  On  the  political  front,  there  have  been  difficulties  in \nobtaining  agreement  on  policy  reforms,  particularly  on  fiscal \nmanagement and, specifically, expenditure cutbacks. These risks \nare mitigated to a significant degree by the strong upfront actions. \nIn contrast to previous reform efforts, the Government has strong \nownership of the Program and the reform agenda at all levels. The \nPresident  himself  has  been  a  leading  champion  of  the  reform \nthe \nprocess.  The  Government  has  been  candid  about \ncomprehensive  nature  of  the  economic  reforms  it  needs  to \nundertake.  This  will  serve  to  mitigate  the  political  risks  and  also \nexpedite legislative approval.  \n \n \n \n\nindicators, \n\n\f \nRisks to privatization will be mitigated by the provision of a TA to \nthe Government. A Government and IMF program will set forth the \nmacroeconomic and fiscal framework and support complementary \npolicy measures over the medium term.  \n \nA TA package of $4.5 million will be provided under the Program. \nThis will comprise (i) TA grant of $3.0 million in support of various \ninstitutional  strengthening  initiatives,  and  (ii)  a  TA  loan  of \n$1.5 million in support of capacity development initiatives and the \neventually  income-generating  privatization  initiatives.  The  TA \ngrant  will  be  primarily  used  for  (i)  strengthening  the  MOFT \ncapacity  in  budget,  expenditure,  tax,  cash  management,  internal \naudit,  and  (ii)  supporting  apex  PMU,  and  the  TPMUs  in  two  key \nministries  and  related  capacity  development.  The  TA  loan  will  (i) \nenhance  training  and  capacity  building  for  government  officials \nand  related  stakeholders;  and    (ii)  enhance  capacity  to  support \nprivatization policies and procedures, the privatization process for \ntargeted  SOEs,  and  develop  the  capacity  of  the  Privatization \nCommittee, \nInvest  Maldives,  and  develop  a  public\u2013private \npartnership framework. \n \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\nv \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nprogram  loan  for  the  Economic  Recovery  Program  (the  Program);  (ii)  a  proposed  technical \nassistance  (TA)    loan  for  Capacity  Development  for  Economic  Recovery  Project  (the  Project), \nboth  to  Republic  of  the  Maldives.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  TA  for  Institutional \nStrengthening for Economic Management. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\n2. \nSocioeconomic  development.  Generally,  sound  macroeconomic  management \ncombined  with  favorable  external  conditions  and  strong  donor  support  have  led  to  average \nannual  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  of  6.6%  during  1994\u20132004  in  the  Maldives. \nTourism has been the engine of growth and it has driven economic expansion in other sectors, \nincluding  construction,  transport  and  communications,  and  wholesale  and  retail  trade.  Strong \nand sustained economic growth has led to a rapid increase in income per capita. The Maldives \nhas gone from being one of the poorest countries in South Asia in the 1970s\u2014with a per capita \nincome  of  less  than  $100\u2014to  the  country  with  highest  per  capita  income  in  the  region  (per \ncapita  income  of  almost  $3,000  by  the  end  of  2008).  The  Maldives  will  be  graduated  by  the \nUnited  Nations  to  a  middle-income  country  on  1  January  2011.  Social  indicators  have  also \nimproved. Primary education is nearly universal. Illiteracy declined from about 18% in the 1970s \nto about 1% in 2001. Infant mortality decreased from more than 100 per thousand in the 1970s \nto 14 per thousand in 2003. Average life expectancy rose from 47 years in 1977 to 71 years in \n2002. While income inequality remains an issue, partly reflecting the characteristics of a small \npopulation  scattered  across  vast  distances,  this  is  expected  to  decline  slowly  as  distant  atolls \nare integrated with the formal economy in Mal\u00e9 and its surroundings.   \n \nSmall,  open  economy.  The  Maldives  is  a  small,  open  economy  and  is  therefore \n3. \nvulnerable to potential shocks, including changes in tourism flows, fluctuations in the prices of \nkey commodities such as food and fuel (both of which are mainly imported), and capital inflows. \nThe  country\u2019s  revenues  and  foreign  exchange  reserves  are  directly  or  indirectly  tied  to  the \nperformance of tourism and any changes to tourism arrivals\u2014as in the aftermath of the tsunami \nand after the start of the global economic crisis\u2014can undermine macroeconomic stability. The \neconomy needs to be properly managed so these vulnerabilities can be addressed. In view of \nthe limited role of monetary policy\u2014reflecting a dollarized economy with a fixed exchange rate \nto the dollar and a money market in its infancy\u2014fiscal policy has the potential to play a greater \nrole in driving demand management and economic stabilization measures. \n \n4. \nRising budget imbalance. The December 2004 tsunami wreaked havoc on the lives of \npeople  in  the  Maldives  and  created  a  disaster  of  national  proportions.  There  was  widespread \ninfrastructure damage, including shelter, in most of the inhabited atolls, but the capital, Mal\u00e9\u2014\nhome  to  about  half  of  the  country\u2019s  population\u2014escaped  relatively  unscathed.  Total  damage \nwas estimated at about $470 million, close to 60% of GDP. With generous external assistance, \nalmost  all  of  the  tsunami-related  damage  has  been  repaired  to  a  higher  design  standard. \nBeginning  with  the  2005  and  2006  budgets,  the  incumbent  Government  started  increasing \nrecurrent  expenditures  with  an  eye  toward  the  next  elections.  These  mainly  consisted  of  (i)  a \nlarge  increase  in  the  size  of  the  civil  service,  (ii)  an  increase  in  public  sector  wages,  and \n(iii) maintenance  of  power  and  water  subsidies,  especially  in  the  politically  important  capital, \nwhere  power  tariffs  have  remained  unchanged  since  2002.  Cumulatively,  these  recurrent \nexpenditures meant that fiscal expenditure reached 62% of GDP by the end of 2008 (compared \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nwith  36%  in  2004).  At  the  same  time,  unrealistic  revenue  projections,  reflected  in  successive \nbudget proposals, failed to materialize and, as a result, the fiscal deficit increased from 1.6% of \nGDP  in  2004  to  12.6%  by  the  end  of  2008.  Total  public  debt  increased  from  43%  of  GDP  in \n2004  to  54%  by  the  end  of  2008.  Domestic  borrowing  to  finance  the  deficit  drove  debt \naccumulation. External debt to GDP rose from 42.7% in 2004 to 76.9% in 2008. \n \n5. \nDeteriorating  balance  of  payments.  Given  the  Maldives' high  import dependency,  its \nexpansionary  fiscal  policy  has  resulted  in  a  deterioration  of  the  balance  of  payments  current \naccount.  The  deficit  increased  partly  because  of  an  increase  in  imports  to  pay  for  tsunami \nreconstruction but mostly because of (i) strong domestic demand led by new resort construction, \n(ii) large government expenditures, and (iii) soaring food and oil prices from 2007.  \n \nReliance  on  external  capital  inflows.  Capital inflows have financed the large balance \n6. \nof payments current account deficit. The main items have been the external investment inflow \nfor  resort  development,  greater  lending  by  Mal\u00e9-based  branches  of  two  foreign  commercial \nbanks  (by  obtaining  funds  from  their  overseas  headquarters),  and  domestic  borrowing  by  the \nGovernment  to  finance  rising  expenditures.  As  the  foreign  bank  liabilities  are  in  the  form  of \nshort-term borrowing, the short-term external debt had increased to $498 million (40% of GDP) \nby the end of 2008. \n \nImpact of the global crisis. Since the onset of the global economic crisis in September \n7. \n2008, foreign banks in Mal\u00e9 have sharply curtailed their lending, which has led to a shortage of \ndollars  in  the  domestic  market.  Withdrawals  from  dollar-denominated  accounts  are  paid  out  in \neither rufiyaa or in a combination of dollars and rufiyaa. The recession in the developed world \nhas  also  affected  tourism.  Bed-nights  dropped  by  almost  9%  year-on-year  during  January\u2013\nSeptember  2009.  The  international  liquidity  crunch  will  make  it  harder  for  the  Maldives  to  roll \nover its short-term borrowing. This represents a risk for the Maldives\u2019 balance of payments and \nthe currency peg with the US dollar. The Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) has continued to \nintervene in the foreign exchange market to maintain the peg, which has led to a steady decline \nin \nincluding  \n$50 million of budgetary support, was agreed to in early 2009, it provided only temporary relief \nfrom the pressure on international reserves. Due to the nascent nature of the financial system in \nthe Maldives, the volume of financial inflows on capital account or portfolio investment has been \nlow.  Gross  international  reserves  have  shown  a  steady  depletion  and,  on  a  net  basis,  were \nsome $53 million at the end of August 2009.   \n  \nPolitical  change. The Maldives now has a new constitution, and a new President who \n8. \nwas elected through universal adult suffrage in a free and fair election in October 2008, bringing \nto an end the 30-year-long rule of the previous administration. The new Government is strongly \ncommitted  to  political  and  economic  reforms  and  its  election  manifesto  included  reducing  the \nsize  of  the  Government  to  a  lean  and  efficient  administrative  machinery,  reducing  the  state\u2019s \nrole  in  economic  activity  by  privatizing  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  and  improving  public \ngovernance.  \n \nInherited  economic  legacy.  By  the  time  the  new  administration  assumed  office  in \n9. \nNovember 2008, the economy had deteriorated significantly; from an estimated GDP growth of \n5.8% in 2008, the most recent official projection for 2009 is \u20133.9%. The economy continues to \nbe  adversely  affected  by  progressively  higher  budget  and  balance  of  payment  deficits,  which \nhas  forced  the  authorities  to  resort  to  monetize  the  deficit  through  the  ways  and  means \nadvances  (W&MA),  i.e.,  an  overdraft  facility  with  the  central  bank.  However,  in  May  2009,  the \nGovernment  obtained  parliamentary  approval  for  a  revised  2009  budget.  The  overriding \n\nline  of  $100  million \n\nreserves.  Although  a \n\nIndia, \n\ncredit \n\nfrom \n\n\fobjective  is  to  adjust  the  budget  so  it  is  in  line  with  the  policies  of  new  government  sworn  in \nNovember 2008, and to align expenditure\u201471% of GDP in the original budget\u2014with available \nresources.  Under  the  revised  budget,  total  expenditures  are  projected  to  decrease  to  67%  of \nGDP,  and  the  budget  deficit  was  projected  to  decline  significantly,  largely  because  of  the \nproposed privatization of Mal\u00e9 International Airport (MIA).  \n \n10. \nThe way forward. As noted in the Government's development policy letter (Appendix 4), \nthe neglect of long-standing structural issues by the previous administration and the impact of \nthe expansionary fiscal policy over the past 3 years have resulted in a marked deterioration in \nthe  economy.  In  order  to  restore  macroeconomic  stability  and  return  the  Maldives  to  its  high-\ngrowth  trajectory,  the  Government  has  decided  to  implement  a  far-reaching  economic  reform \nprogram. For this purpose, it has sought assistance from Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nother development partners, including International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (see \nPara 57).  \n  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR  \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Analysis  \n\n1. \n\nThe Challenge \n\n11. \nSince  the  tsunami  in  late  2004,  the  Maldives\u2019  economic  performance  has  rapidly \ndeteriorated.  While  the  tsunami-related  damage  is  being  restored,  the  deterioration  in \nmacroeconomic  indicators  continues.  This  reflects  the  then  Government's  failure  to  undertake \nmuch-needed reforms to address longstanding structural issues, including a rapidly expanding \ncivil  service  and  public  sector  wage  increases,  unsustainable  subsidies  on  economic  services \n(including  that  of  power  in  Mal\u00e9,  the  country's  most  affluent  region),  and  a  system  of  revenue \ngeneration that relies on advance payments of public assets, such as advance lease payments \nfor  tourism  resorts,  and  for  financing  recurrent  expenditures  at  the  detriment  of  future \ngenerations. The Maldives' expenditure to GDP ratio is one of the highest in the region and one \nof the highest of island economies.  \n \nThe economic base remains narrow and relies disproportionately on the performance of \n12. \ntourism,  and  to  a  lesser  degree  on  that  of  fisheries  and  construction.  There  are  39  SOEs,  of \nwhich  a  minority  transfer  any  meaningful  dividend  income  to  the  treasury.  The  remainder \nrepresents  a  net  drain  on  the  budget.  As  the  Maldives  is  an  open  economy  and  highly \nthese  structural  constraints  have  weakened  macroeconomic \ndependent  on \nfundamentals and rendered the economy much more vulnerable to external shocks, including a \nrise  in  international  food  and  fuel  prices  as  well  as  the  impact  from  the  global  economic \ndownturn.  The  increasing  reliance  on  large  public  spending  has  led  to  a  large  fiscal  deficit, \nwhich  is  at  the  source  of  the  economic  ills  facing  the  country  and  has  resulted  in  rapid \naccumulation  of  public  debt.  The  share  of  current  expenditure  to  total  expenditure  increased \nfrom  70%  to  80%.  The  authorities  have  had  to  monetize  the  deficit  through  W&MA.  This  has \nfueled  inflation,  increased  the  real  effective  exchange  rate,  and  exerted  pressure  on  the \ncurrency peg. Debt monetization is also placing increasing pressure on MMA's balance sheet. \nLarge  public  spending  has  increased  demand  for  imports\u2014by  virtue  of  the  openness  of  the \neconomy\u2014and resulted in rapid growth of the current account deficit. For a more detailed sector \nanalysis, see Appendix 2. \n \n \n\nimports, \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Measures Taken to Address the Problem \n\n13. \nThe Government is aware of these increasing fiscal constraints and associated external \nimbalances, and has started reforms to address them. However, it does not have the resources \nto implement many of these measures and has approached its development partners to support \nits economic reform program. \n \n14. \nThe  Government  has  initiated  measures  to  (i)  curtail  expenditures;  (ii)  broaden  the \nrevenue base, (iii) streamline Government functions; (iv) address the issue of SOE circular debt; \n(v) reduce its borrowings from the Central Bank to finance the budget deficit, and (vi) strengthen \nthe  institutional  framework  for  privatization  and  national  planning.  It  has  also  announced  its \nintention  of  rationalizing  the  civil  service  by  reducing  it  by  a  third,  increasing  power  tariffs  in \nMal\u00e9,  and  also  instituting  a  power  tariff  formula  linking  power  tariffs  to cost  of  inputs  including \ninternational petroleum prices. Details of these measures are in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n\n \n\nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities  \n\n1. \n\nIssues \n\na. \n\nRevised 2009 Budget and the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework \nRemain Ambitious \n\n15. \nBudget deficit. Although the revised 2009 budget aims to compress the fiscal deficit to \n7.4%  of  GDP,  revenues  are  uncertain\u2014most  are  projected  to  come  from  the  privatization  of \nMIA,  which  is  not  likely  in  2009,  and  from  the  introduction  of  an  increase  in  the  airport \npassenger service charge (airport tax), business profits tax, and tourism goods and services tax. \nAs  of  the  end  of  June  2009,  the  budget  deficit  was  16%  of  GDP,  and,  with  the  measures \ndescribed in the Program, the year-end budget deficit is projected to be 28%,1 and to decline to \n14% by the end of 2010.  \n \n16. \nThe  credibility  and  predictability  of  the  budget  formulation  and  implementation  process \nneeds to be significantly enhanced. \"Expenditure brakes\" need to be introduced if revenue and \nexpenditure deviate from the projected adjustment path. Given the increasing uncertainty over \nrevenues\u2014aggravated  by  volatility  in  the  global  economy\u2014monthly  statements  of  expenditure \nand  receipts  and  significant  deviations  (outside  seasonal  factors)  should  be  closely  monitored \nand expenditure brakes quickly triggered across the board.  \n \n\nb. \n\nLack of Capacity Could Hinder Revenue and Expenditure Measures  \n\n17. \nRevenue  generation.  The  medium-term  tax  and  expenditure  containment  measures \nunderpinning  the  revised  2009  budget  may  not  achieve  the  fiscal  targets  within  the  stipulated \ntimeframe.  For  proposed  revenues  to  reach  their  target,  significant  preparatory  work  needs  to \nbe undertaken and capacities developed to introduce two major taxation initiatives (a business \nprofits  tax  and  a  tourism  goods  and  services  tax)  within  a  relatively  short  period.  On  the \nspending side, fiscal policy remains expansionary, and there needs to be a clear articulation of a \nmechanism to synchronize power tariffs with input costs and reduce the wage bill for the public \nsector.  Smaller  capital  inflows  to  finance  new  resort  construction  and  declining  tourist  arrivals \nbecause of the global economic crisis would affect projected government revenue in 2009. To \n\n                                                 \n1  Without the Program, the 2009 year-end budget deficit is projected to be 33% of GDP. \n\n\fstrengthen the Government\u2019s revenue base, the introduction of broad-based taxes is essential. \nHowever, if these are to be successful, the associated capacities need to be developed.  \n \n18. \nExpenditure management. Expenditures have risen rapidly in recent years. The growth \nhas been in recurrent expenditures, mostly because of increases in the civil service wage bill, \nand continued subsidization of economic services, including power tariffs in Mal\u00e9.  \n \n19. \nDebt  management. Debt management is an integral part of sound fiscal management. \nAlthough an External Resource Management Division was set up in the Ministry of Finance and \nTreasury (MOFT) to act as the focal point for debt management, the Government currently does \nnot have an overall strategy to reduce debt to prudent levels over the short to medium term.  \n \nCircular  debt. The State Electric Company Limited (STELCO) owes the State Trading \n20. \nOrganization  (STO)  accumulated  debt  of  Rf400  million  (some  $31  million)  as  of  August  2009 \n(the circular debt). Currently, MOFT is accruing liabilities on behalf of STELCO, and this liability \nis  planned  to  be  transferred  to  MOFT  in  2009.  As  the  Government  plans  the  privatization  of \nSOEs,  MOFT  will  need  to  recognize  their  liabilities  and  account  for  them  as  a  part  of  the \nGovernment's contingent liability.  \n \n\nc. \n\nNeed to Improve Deficit-Financing Mechanisms by Treasury Bills \n\n \n21.  MOFT does not have a framework for analyzing monthly Treasury cash flow to support \nMMA's liquidity forecasting. As MMA purchases of Treasury bills on its own account have been \ndiscontinued (to decrease the cost of Treasury bill financing) a system of Treasury bill auctions, \nincluding  primary  dealers  and  brokers  to  support  trading  in  the  secondary  market  is \ncontemplated.  \n \n\nd. \n\nInternal Audit Function Faces Capacity Constraints \n\n22. \nAlthough  the  Public  Finance  Act  2007  and  its  regulations  have  been  enacted,  the \nregulations do not cover accounting standards. Consolidated financial statements are currently \nnot  prepared  and  are  therefore  not  audited. 2 A  task  force  has  been  set  up  to  analyse  the \nInternational Public Sector Accounting Standards to see how draft financial regulations can be \nmade  consistent  with  international  standards.   The  intention  is  to  begin  by  implementing  cash \naccounting  standards  (which  is  historically  how  governments  have  accounted)  and  then \nprogressively  implement  accrual  accounting  standards.3 However,  the  internal  audit  team  is \nunderstaffed  and  will  need  training  in  and  exposure  to  technology  and  project  management. \nNone of the current staff is capable of assuming the role of an information technology auditor.  \n \n\ne. \n\nPrivatization Lacks Clear Policy and Procedure \n\n23. \nThe Maldives lacks a formal privatization policy. A clear policy is critical\u2014particularly in \nthe absence of a privatization act\u2014to explain the Government's objectives and to establish clear \nprinciples for the privatization process, including checks and balances. The policy is particularly \nneeded in view of the difficulties that have been encountered in the privatization of MIA (the first \nflagship privatization attempt by the new Government). \n \n\n                                                 \n2   IMF. 2009. Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment for the Maldives. Washington, DC. \n3   The  accrual  method  of  accounting  is  the  internationally  agreed  best  practice  and  the  method  most  governments \n\nare progressively implementing. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nFor  efficient  and  effective  privatization,  the  Government  needs  to  issue  regulations  to \n24. \nimplement  the  comprehensive  SOE  privatization  reform  initiative.  Areas  that  need  to  be \naddressed  include  (i)  the  basis  for  determining  which  SOEs  identified  for  reforms  should  be \nretained, restructured, privatized, or closed; (ii) guidelines for financial restructuring detailing the \nprocedure  for  implementing  the  financial  restructuring  plan;  and  (iii)  a  redundancy  program, \ncovering eligibility criteria and severance compensation.  \n \n\nf. \n\nDeficiencies in Utilizing External Assistance \n\nthe \n\nintended  beneficiaries.  Project \n\n25. \nCapacity  constraints  affect  all  stages  of  the  economic  management  process,  including \ntimely utilization of external assistance. As a result, all development partners are experiencing \nsignificant  delays  in  the  completion  of  their  projects  and  programs.  These  increase  costs  and \nimplementation  units  are  usually  severely \ndeprive \nunderstaffed  and  staff  are  often  underqualified.  There  is  no  systematic  review  of  project \nperformance,  and  no  mechanism  in  place  to  reward  good  performers  and  penalize  poor \nperformers. Coordination within Government is weak and it takes an inordinate amount of time \nto resolve normal development problems. As a result, projects are usually 3\u20134 years late. These \ndelays impose a high opportunity cost and undermine the projects' development effectiveness.   \n \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\n \n26. \nThere is an urgent need to realign public spending within a realistic revenue envelope. \nThis  is  a  prerequisite  to  reducing  economic  imbalances  and  restoring  a  sustainable  growth \ntrajectory over the medium term. The Government has initiated reforms to strengthen its fiscal \nposition  and,  as  the  country  nears  middle-income  status,  the  Government  plans  to  reduce  its \ndirect  role  in  the  economy,  and  to  facilitate  a  greater  role  for  private  sector.  To  promote  the \nreform  initiatives,  the  Government  has  requested  ADB  assistance.  With  net  international \nreserves down to $53 million in early August 2009, a significant contraction in the 2009 growth \nrate and a large financing gap, this is the time to undertake sustainable remedial actions. The \nProgram  is  consistent  with  the  strategic  thrust  of  the  country  partnership  strategy4 and  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2020, 5 represents  ADB\u2019s  responsiveness  to  an  economic  emergency,  and  reflects \nclose coordination with development partners.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM  \n\n27. \nThe  Program  has  five  major  components:  (i)  strengthening  fiscal  policy  and  bolstering \nbudget  formulation  and  implementation;  (ii)  implementing  revenue,  expenditure,  and  debt \nmanagement measures to strengthen fiscal policy; (iii) strengthening mechanisms for financing \nthe budget; (iv) facilitating privatization of SOEs; and (v) strengthening internal audit operations. \n \nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n28. \nThe impact of the Program will be an enhanced recovery and sustainable growth of the \neconomy  over  the  medium  term  by  removing  the  distortions  that  have  led  to  the  current  large \neconomic  imbalances.  By  supporting  long  overdue  structural  reforms,  the  Program  will  move \ntoward  a  more  broad-based  sustainable  development  framework  that  reduces  the  country's \nvulnerability  to  external  shocks  and  prepares  it  for  scheduled  graduation  to  middle-income \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB. 2007.

The Program takes into account the remedial actions either \nalready  taken  by  the  Government  or  planned  for  the  coming  months.  It  outlines  subsequent \nactions that will need to be undertaken to deepen the reform process and return the economy to \na sustainable growth trajectory. \n \n29. \nThe medium-term outcomes of the Program include (i) enhancing the realism and value \nof  the  budget  as  a  policy  tool;  (ii)  improving  fiscal  discipline  and  predictability;  (iii)  moving  the \nbudget  preparation  process  from  a  needs  to  an  availability  basis;  (iv)  ensuring  that  a  results \nframework  is  used  to  track  overall  development  performance  and  measure  progress  toward \nachievement  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals;  (iv)  facilitating  timely  implementation  of \ndevelopment  assistance  from  ADB  and  other  development  partners  to  enhance  development \neffectiveness;  (v)  improving  monitoring  and  management  of  internal  and  external  debt  and \nretain  them  at  sustainable  levels;  (vi)  putting  Government  finances  on  a  sounder  footing  and \navoiding  inflationary  domestic  finance;  (vii)  deepening  financial  markets  by  issuing  Treasury \nbills,  and  providing  the  MMA  with  a  market-based  instrument  for  liquidity  management.  The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n1. \n\nComponent  1:  Strengthening  Fiscal  Policy  and  Bolstering  Budget \nFormulation and Implementation \n\n30. \nStrengthening  policy  framework.  The  Program  seeks  to  improve  the  fiscal  policy \nframework  and  budget  preparation  process  to  ensure  a  commitment  to  fiscal  discipline  and \nmacroeconomic stability. Sound fiscal discipline is critical to small, open economies such as the \nMaldives,  where  fiscal  prudence  and  stabilization  of  inflation  are  essential  to  ensure  effective \nmacroeconomic management and smooth adjustment to potential external shocks. To establish \nan overall framework for fiscal consolidation, a fiscal responsibility act will be drafted during the \nProgram period. This will stipulate budget deficit targets that cannot be exceeded, and make it a \nlegal requirement for future budgets to be linked to the medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF). \nThe  draft  act  should  be  submitted  for  parliamentary  approval  by  June  2011.  The  MTFF  in  the \nrevised 2009 budget will be strengthened and will continue to describe a realistic path to fiscal \nconsolidation. The MTFF will develop rolling revenue and expenditure projections over a 3-year \nperiod,  based  on  underlying  assumptions  such  as  GDP  growth,  inflation,  exchange  rates, \ninterest rates, tourism inflows, and external trade. The MTFF will anchor the preparation of the \nbudget  and  will  be  updated  regularly.  Its  assumptions  and  projections  will  generate  a  fiscal \nposition and borrowing requirement that are consistent with the Government's overarching fiscal \nand debt strategy.  \n  \n \n31. \nThe  adoption  of  MTFF  will  move  away  from  the  current  project-based  approach  to \ndevelopment  assistance.  While  the  assistance  may  be  for  specific  sectors  or  projects,  the \nresources made available will become part of well defined sector strategies supporting overall \ngovernment development policies. Furthermore, there will be an increasing integration between \ndevelopment  and  recurrent  budget  taking  into  account  recurring  costs  (i.e.,  operations  and \nmaintenance) resulting from fixed capital formation. The Government will soon approve a new \nNational  Development  Strategy  (NDS),  based  on  the  Government's  election  manifesto  and \nclose  stakeholder  consultation.  It  includes  a  preliminary  costing  of  programs  and  a  results-\nbased  monitoring  framework.  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  is  assisting  the \nGovernment with the NDS.  \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nThe  Program  will  support  various  MOFT  actions  related  to  the  MTFF.  First,  MOFT  will \n32. \ndevelop medium-term sector road maps based on NDS goals. These will have clear objectives \nand  policies  and  a  results-based  monitoring  framework  to  measure  how  programs  can \neffectively  meet  sector  objectives.  Second,  MOFT  will  develop  a  budget  programming \nframework  to  ensure  that  expenditure  on  the  development  budget  follows  sector  objectives, \npolicies, and programs. Third, MOFT will issue budget circulars requiring line ministries to align \nproposed  development  expenditures  closely  with  sector  goals  and  policies.  Fourth,  MOFT  will \ndevelop project selection criteria for the PSIP budget and ensure recurrent costs are reflected in \nannual  budgets.  Fifth,  MOFT  will  introduce,  on  a  pilot  basis,  principles  of  results-  or \nperformance-based  budgeting  in  three  key  sectors  (transport,  health,  and  education).  Sixth, \nMOFT  will  develop  a  monitoring \nfor  \n(i) alignment with the MTFF, (ii) ex-post evaluation of how closely actual development spending \nwas  aligned  with  the  budget,  and  (iii)  an  assessment  of  the  contribution  to  sector  outcomes. \nFinally,  MOFT  will  migrate  and  reconcile  2009  revenue  and  expenditure  accounts  into  public \naccounting system-compatible format, and prepare the 2011 budget based on public accounting \nsystem reporting requirements.  \n \n\nimplementation \n\nfor  budget \n\nframework \n\nto  allow \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Implementing Revenue, Expenditure, and Debt Management \nMeasures to Strengthen the Fiscal Policy \n\nRevenue measures. In parallel with the Government's efforts to strengthen fiscal policy \n33. \nand  budget  preparation,  it  will  continue  to  strengthen  the  revenue  base  and  to  rationalize \nexpenditures, leading to a progressively lower budget deficit. On the revenue side, the Program \nwill  facilitate  the  diversification  of  the  tax  base  and  increase  revenues  through  higher  tax \ncollection. In addition to the business profit tax (BPT) and tax administration bills, the Program \nrequires the MOFT to submit the tourism goods and services tax bill to Parliament by the end of \n2009.  Subsequent  to  Parliamentary  approval  for  enhancing  the  airport  passenger  service \ncharge  (airport  tax)  from  the  current  $12  to  $18.5  per  ticket,  MOFT  will  issue  a  circular  to \ntransfer the proceeds of the airport tax from Maldives Airport Company Limited to the Treasury. \nWhile these actions are to be completed in 2009, the Program envisages extension of the goods \nand services tax to non-tourism sectors by submission of a bill to Parliament by June 2011.   \n \nThe  BPT  will  be  more  complex  than  other  taxes  administered  by  the  Department  of \n34. \nInland  Revenue  (DIR)  and  will  require  intensive  preparatory  work,  including  registering \ntaxpayers,  undertaking  tax  survey  work,  and  reviewing  audited  statements,  compliance \nassessment, and post-tax audits. As part of the measures to strengthen DIR, the TA grant will \nhelp to build tax administration capacity, including developing a large taxpayer unit focusing on \nthe  collection  of  BPT  for  the  largest  50  companies;  approving  operations  manuals,  auditing \nmanuals,  and  taxpayer  guides;  and  collecting  other  information  to  prepare  for  the  actual \ncollection  of  BPT.  As  part  of  the  upgrading  of  the  DIR,  the  Government  will  strengthen  the \nstaffing  of  the  revenue  administration.  Automation  of  the  DIR  will  also  enable  effective \nmanagement  of  the  tax  base.  A  computerized  database  will  help  in  effective  risk  assessment \nand in planning an appropriate audit strategy. It will also provide the department with a tool to \ninstitutionalize performance management within the department. ADB  has already initiated the \ntransformation of DIR through the preparation of a Roadmap on the modernization of revenue \nadministration (Supplementary Appendix H). \n \n35. \nExpenditure measures. In order to align expenditure with revenues, the Government is \nfinalizing  a  human  resource  management  plan,  setting  out  the  principles  and  criteria  for \ndownsizing  the  civil  service  and  constituting  the  framework  for  implementation  of  the \nredundancy program. The first phase of a redundancy program will be implemented by the end \n\n\fof 2009, resulting in a reduction of at least 2,000 staff in Government and SOEs. The second \nphase  will  be  completed  in  2010  with  a  further  reduction  of  a  minimum  of  3,000  civil  servants \nand followed by another 3,000 by June 2011. Along with the reduction in the civil service, the \nGovernment  plans  to  reduce  and  then  eliminate  power  subsidies  and  linking  power  tariff \nadjustments, on a biannual basis, to cost of inputs. \n  \n36. \nDebt  management  measures.  Previous  ADB  support  to  strengthen  the  Government's \ndebt  management  capacity6 needs  to  be  built  upon.  The  need  to  develop  an  effective  and \ncomprehensive debt monitoring and management system is underscored by the recent build-up \nof  debt.  As  the  Maldives  moves  toward  middle-income  country  status,  its  debt  will  be \nincreasingly  priced  on  commercial  terms  and  strong  debt  management  practices  will  result  in \nsignificant  savings  for  the  Treasury.  Various  measures  under  the  Program  will  support  debt \nmanagement. The Government will develop and approve a debt strategy, which will allow better \nplanning  of  its  borrowing  strategy  and  introduce  regular  debt  sustainability  analysis  to  monitor \ndebt  and  manage  the  associated  risks.  The  debt  strategy's  objectives  will  include  achieving \nconsistency with the objectives of the MTFF, improving debt management, undertaking the first \ndebt sustainability assessment, and finalizing a framework to monitor external private debt.  \n \n37. \nRegarding  the  contingent  liabilities  originating  from  SOE  debt,  MOFT  will  prepare  a \nstudy that identifies the stock of outstanding liabilities on SOE balance sheets (with a focus on \nSTELCO and STO) by the end of 2009. Further, by end 2009, the Government will issue bonds \nor make other arrangements to retire the outstanding circular debt owed by STELCO to STO. \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Strengthening the Mechanisms for Financing the Budget \n\n38. \nTo reform the mechanisms for efficient financing of fiscal deficit, liquidity forecasting will \nbe  strengthened  at  MOFT.  A  framework  will  analyze  monthly  Treasury  cash  flow  and  will  be \nused  to  support  liquidity  forecasting  by  the  MMA.  A  progressive  reduction  of  the  outstanding \nbalance  on  W&MA  will  be  achieved  and  greater  reliance  will  be  placed  on  open  market \noperations using Treasury bills, including the eventual conversion of outstanding W&MA. MMA \nwill  prepare  a  study  on  a  system  of  primary  dealers  and  brokers  for  auctioning  Treasury  bills \nand  subsequent  trading  in  the  secondary  market.  It  will  also  establish  a  framework  to  replace \nthe fixed rate tap system with a variable rate Treasury bill auction system to develop competitive \nbidding  and  trading  in  Government  securities.  The  W&MA  ceiling  will  not  be  breached  and \npublic  sector  borrowing  will  be  mobilized  in  the  domestic  market,  thereby  reducing  liquidity \ninjections and containing inflationary pressures. By June 2011, MOFT and MMA will revisit the \nmemorandum of understanding dated 30 August 2006 with the objective of further reducing the \nceiling  on  W&MA.  In  the  medium  term,  the  Program  anticipates  that  Treasury  bill  and  bond \nissuances,  and  their  eventual  trading  will  contribute  to  deepening  of  financial  markets  and \nproviding MMA with a  market-based instrument for liquidity management. The development of \ntradable  securities  at  the  short  end  of  the  market  will  also  serve  to  enhance  the  conduct  of \nmonetary  policy.  For  this  purpose,  MMA  will  arrange  the  trading  of  Treasury  bills  in  the \nsecondary  market,  including  open  market  operations.  To  enhance  demand,  MMA  will  include \nTreasury  bills  as  eligible  items  under  its  minimum  reserve  requirements  for  commercial  banks \nand will allow non-institutional investors to participate in the Treasury bills market.  \n \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Maldives for Strengthening of Debt Management. Manila \n\n(TA 4196-MLD, approved on 14 October). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n4. \n\nComponent 4: Facilitating Privatization of State-Owned Enterprises \n\nto  oversee \n\nIt  has  established  an \n\nindependent  Privatization  Committee \n\nThe  privatization  of  SOEs  forms  a  core  plank  of  the  Government's  economic  reform \n39. \nagenda. \nthe \nimplementation  of  the  privatization  policy.  Invest  Maldives  under  the  Ministry  of  Economic \nDevelopment is the implementation agency for privatization, in close consultation with the Public \nEnterprise Monitoring and Evaluation Board (PEMEB) under MOFT. Invest Maldives has posted \nfollowing SOEs for privatization on the Government website: Maldives National Shipping; Mal\u00e9 \nWater  and  Sewerage;  Maldives  Industrial  Fisheries  (for  joint  venture  partnerships  in  fish \nfreezing,  fish  canning,  and  aquaculture);  Waste  Management;  STELCO;  Maldives  National \nBroadcasting;  MIA;  Thilafalhu  Development  in  the  Greater  Mal\u00e9  Region;  and  Regional  Utility \nServices. As a part of the Government's efforts to privatize selected SOEs, a formal privatization \npolicy is being prepared that will establish clear principles underlying the privatization process, \nincluding the necessary checks and balances. \n \n40. \nDevelopment  partners  have  been  supporting  the  privatization  program.  ADB  has  been \nworking  with  PEMEB  to  develop  a  monitoring  framework  to  assess  the  performance  of  SOEs \nand  has  supported  possible  reforms  to  STELCO,  building  on  a  new  business  model.  Further \nwork is needed to develop (i) a framework that will categorize SOEs into those to be retained \nand restructured under Government ownership, those to be privatized, and those to be closed; \n(ii) guidelines  for  financial  restructuring,  detailing  the  procedure  for  implementing  a  financial \nrestructuring  plan  for  loss-making  entities;  (iii)  a  redundancy  scheme  for  employees  of  SOEs; \n(iv) enforcement of the institutional structure for SOE reforms under the Privatization Committee \n(to address issues that arise from individual SOEs being sponsored by different ministries); and \n(v) guidelines on the privatization process to ensure that the Government shares in those SOEs \nidentified  for  privatization  are  divested  through  a  fair,  transparent,  and  objective  bidding \nprocess.  The  International  Finance  Corporation  has  been  hired  as  a  lead  manager  in  the \nprivatization of MIA. \n\n1. \n\n \n\n5. \n\nComponent 5: Strengthening Internal Audit Operations \n\nfinancial  accountability  assessment.  The \n\n41. \nADB  has  assisted  the  Government's  efforts  to  put  in  place  appropriate  institutional \narrangements,  systems,  and  procedures  to  discharge  internal  audit  functions,  including  the \ndevelopment  of  a  strategic  management  plan.  Human  resource  development  and  model \noperating procedures were developed during this first phase. ADB's follow-up assistance will be \ntaking  account  of  the  recommendations  made  by  the  IMF  under  its  recent  public  expenditure \nIMF's  work  on  strengthening  budgetary \nand \nmechanisms  and  debt  management  will  be  synchronized  with  ADB's  support  for  debt \nsustainability assessments. \n \nThe approval of the strategic management plan will usher in the start of the Program's \n42. \nsecond phase, during which auditing standards and registration requirements will be developed, \ntogether with model reporting requirements. Comprehensive internal audit manuals will also be \ncompleted.  Capacity  development  will  be  an  integral  part  of  this  phase.  The  third  phase  will \ncomprise the carrying out of risk-based audits in a diligent, consistent, and effective manner and \nin full compliance with the Public Accounting Act of 2007. The internal audit function will roll out \ninto budgetary agencies on a pilot basis.  \n \n \n\n\fC. \n\nCreation of Apex Program Management Unit \n\n43. \nAs  noted  in  ADB's  2007  country  partnership  strategy  (footnote  4),  capacity  constraints \nseverely affect the optimization of all externally-assisted projects and programs. The practice of \nestablishing  project-specific  PIUs  has  not  worked  well,  as  they  have  never  been  properly \nstaffed.  As  a  result,  projects  are  completed  3\u20134  years  late,  undermining  their  development \neffectiveness. Under the Program, ADB and the Government have agreed that an apex project \nmanagement unit (PMU) will be established at the MOFT and two thematic project management \nunits  (TPMU)  will  also  be  established  in  the  Ministry  of  Housing,  Transport,  and  Environment; \nand the Ministry of Economic Development. These will not only monitor the implementation of \nADB-assisted projects, but also those of other development partners. The apex PMU will meet \nevery quarter, identify timely remedial measures, and publish the minutes of its meetings on the \nMOFT website. The creation of these PMUs will result in cost efficiencies and allow them to be \nstaffed  appropriately.  ADB  will  support  the  creation  of  the  PMUs  as  well  as  their  functioning \nduring the program period. The performance assessment of the PMUs will be an integral part of \nthe overall implementation assessment of the Program. It is envisaged that other development \npartners may also contribute to the funding of such PMUs.  \n \nD. \n\nImportant Features and Lessons  \n\nThe lessons in processing the Program are twofold: (i) the authorities' failure to address \n44. \nstructural issues in a timely manner adds to costs and makes the adjustment path steeper; and \n(ii) institutional weaknesses, manifesting itself in poor macroeconomic management, highlights \nthe  need  to  build  the  capacity  to  manage  an  open,  import-dependent  economy,  and  to  have \nsystems  in  place  that  provide  timely  signals  for  the  Government.  Complacency  and  undue \nreliance  on  tourism  need  to  be  avoided  through  long  overdue  structural  reforms  (although \nadmittedly  these  will  have  to  be  addressed  in  an  adverse  global  economic  environment).  The \nprocess of privatizing selected SOEs needs to be carefully managed to ensure that the process \nis conducted transparently according to well-defined rules.  \n  \n45. \nThe  Program  has  a  high  degree  of  political  ownership  from  the  Government,  and  the \nlegislative assembly (the Majlis). The scale of reform measures approved by the Majlis in 2009 \nsuggests  that  the  economic  reform  program  enjoys  bipartisan  support.  Unlike  in  the  past,  the \nGovernment  has  been  very  transparent  about  the  objectives  it  wants  to  achieve  with  the \nProgram and forthcoming about its likely costs. It has listed a menu of reform measures that it \nwill  pursue.  The  Program  is  being  developed  in  close  consultation  with  the  Government  and \nother development partners such as IMF and World Bank. In the run-up to the Program, many \njoint missions were fielded, and, given the nature of the support, a holistic approach has been \npursued.  ADB  has  shared  the  policy  matrix  with  the  IMF  and  the  World  Bank  and  has \ncoordinated closely with them in the final design.  \n \nE. \n\nCost and Financing Plan \n\n \n\n1. \n\nCost \n\n46. \nPolicy reform adjustment costs are estimated at $231 million (Table 1). The bulk of the \ncosts  are  associated  with  the  implementation  of  the  redundancy  program,  payment  of  the \nGovernment's  share  of  the  accrued  pension  liability  (after  passage  of  the  2009  Pension  Act), \nretirement  of  existing  circular  debt  owed  by  SOEs  like  STELCO,  and  services  related  to  the \nintroduction of taxes and capacity development.  \n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nTable 1: Indicative Program Adjustment Costs for the Economic Recovery Program \n($ million) \n\nOutputs and Areas for Support \n1.  \n2.  \n3.  \n4.  \n5.  \n6.  \n7.  \n\n \nCivil service redundancy package \nSME loans (for redundant civil servants) \nHigher education loans (for redundant civil servants) \nTVET (for redundant civil servants) \nTVET capital costs (related to redundancy program) \nAccrued government pension liability \nThree-year interest cost of converting $40 million circular debt into Government \nof Maldives bonds \nInterest cost of conversion of Rf1.6 billion W&MA to a 3-year bond issue at \n\n8.  \n\nCosts \n40.0 \n40.0 \n80.0 \n  8.0 \n10.0 \n25.0 \n8.5 \n\n16.0 \n\n13% \nSubtotal \n\nTotal \n\nTA loan \n\n \n9.  \n10.

The  program  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  ADB  will  also  provide  a  technical  assistance  (TA) \npackage of $4.5 million in support of the Program, comprising (i) a TA grant of $3.0 million, from \nADB's  TA  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV),  in  support  of  various  institutional  strengthening  initiatives; \nand (ii) a TA loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR939,000 ($1.5 million equivalent) from \nADB's Special Funds resources in support of capacity development and privatization initiatives. \nThe TA loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest \ncharge  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  ADB \nsupport  will  cover  15%  of  the  adjustment  cost  while  the  Government  will  cover  36%.  The \nremainder  will  be  funded  by  other  development  partners  (although  the  nature  of  the  IMF\u2019s \nStand-By  Arrangement  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Development  Support  Facility  is  accounted \ndifferently from budget support).   \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan for the Economic Recovery Program \nShare \n(%) \n15.0 \n36.0 \n49.0 \n100.0 \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernmenta \nOther Development Partnersb \nTotal \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n35.0 \n84.0 \n112.0 \n231.0 \n\na  Includes in-kind contribution of office space, counterpart staff, and administrative support. \nb   The  IMF  is  providing  $92.5  million  under  a  Stand-By  Arrangement  and  the  World  Bank \n\n$24 million possibly under a Development Support Facility. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n\fF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n \nThe MOFT will be the Executing Agency (EA) of the Program. A steering committee will \n48. \nbe  established  to  ensure  effective  and  timely  implementation  of  the  Program  by  monitoring \nperformance  and  coordinating  efforts  across  various  implementing  agencies.  It  will  be  chaired \nby the minister of state for finance and will include representatives from the President's Office, \nMOFT, the Privatization Committee, Department of National Planning, PEMEB, and MMA. ADB \nwill  participate  as  an  observer.  In  consultation  with  ADB,  the  Government  will  appoint  a \nsecretary  of  the  committee.  The  committee  will  meet  at  least  once  every  quarter  to  discuss \nimplementation progress and address any outstanding issues. The secretary will officiate as the \nprogram  director  and  will  be  responsible  for  coordination  efforts  across  the  five  program \ncomponents. Quarterly progress reports will be sent to ADB highlighting the achievements and \npotential problem areas to be addressed by the committee. In addition, the apex PMU at MOFT \nwill  be  responsible  for  overseeing  Program  implementation  as  part  of  its  broader  agenda  to \nenhance development effectiveness.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProgram Period and Tranching \n\n \nThe  Program  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  36  months,  from  January  2010  to \n49. \nDecember  2012.  The  loan  will  be  released  in  two  tranches:  (i)  SDR11,269,028  ($18  million \nequivalent) upon fulfillment of agreed conditions for the first tranche and following effectiveness \nof  the  loan,  and  (ii)  SDR10,642,972  ($17  million  equivalent)  upon  confirmation  of  compliance \nwith all agreed conditions for the second tranche release. It is estimated that the second tranche \nwill be disbursed within 18 months of loan effectiveness.  \n \n\nProcurement and Disbursement  \n\n3. \n \n50. \nThe Program proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding \nlocal duties and taxes) of imports produced, and procured, in ADB member countries, excluding \nineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources  (Appendix  7). \nThe  Government  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request. \nOtherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required.  The  Program \nproceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Government  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB's \ndisbursement procedures.   \n \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n4. \n \nThe local currency generated from the proceeds of the Program will be used to finance \n\n51. \nadjustment costs under the Program.  \n \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Governance Risks \n\n5. \n \nGovernance  and  corruption  risks  in  the  Program  can  be  categorized  broadly  as  those \n52. \nevident  in  the  broader  political  economic  context,  and  those  that  are  program-specific.  The \nbroader  risks  include  weakening  Government  commitment  to  necessary  reforms;  impending \npolitical  changes,  creating  an  environment  of  policy  uncertainty;  lack  of  consensus  among \nstakeholders  on  needed  policy  reforms  and  on  how  far  to  push  the  reform  envelope;  and \nnegative  exogenous  shocks  (both  economic  and  otherwise).  Program-specific  risks  include  \n(i) continued capacity constraints in key economic and financial agencies; (ii) continued inability \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nof the Government to formulate and commit to a suitable fiscal consolidation policy and strategy; \nand (iii) an inability to deepen civil service reforms. For further risk analysis, see Appendix 8 and \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date),  as  well  as  the  Second \n53. \nGovernance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan,  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \nGovernment  and  the  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability, \nand  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any \nallegedly  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program  and  the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  Loan  Agreement  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n6. \n \n54. \nThe Government will maintain records and accounts for the Program and the Project, in \naccordance with sound accounting principles, and will have such accounts and records audited \nannually by auditors acceptable to ADB. To ensure proper fund management, ADB retains the \nright  to  audit  the  use  of  program  and  project  loan  proceeds.  The  accounts  will  be  managed, \noperated,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  terms  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  Government  will \nensure that submission of reports, audited accounts, and financial statements are in compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s guidelines. Audited annual accounts by independent auditors acceptable to ADB will \nbe submitted to ADB within 6 months of the reporting period (i.e., within 6 months of the end of \nthe  fiscal  year).  The  annual  audit  for  the  Project  will  provide  a  separate  audit  opinion  on  the \nsoundness  of  (i) the  statement  of  expenditure  operations,  and  (ii)  the  imprest  account \noperations. The Government was advised of ADB\u2019s requirement of timely submission of audited \naccounts  and  financial  statements,  and  was  advised  about  suspension  and  acceleration \nsections. \n \n\nProgram Monitoring  \n\n7. \n \n55. \nProgram  monitoring,  in  the  first  instance,  will  be  done  by  the  steering  committee, \nsupplemented  by  the  apex  PMU  of  MOFT  and  will  be  complemented  by  periodic  ADB  review \nmissions. These will (i) confirm the fulfillment of policy actions for tranche releases; (ii) confirm \nthe  release  of  adequate  funds  from  the  Government  for  program  activities;  (iii) monitor  the \ncontinued applicability of the assumptions underlying the Program, as well as specific risks and \ntheir mitigating measures; and (iv) advise on actions to maintain effective implementation within \nthe  program  period.  Relevant  baseline  indicators  and  targets  have  been  incorporated  into  the \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).  \n \n\nProgram Review \n\n8. \n \nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  review  program  implementation  at  least  three  times  a \n56. \nyear. The reviews will evaluate the program scope, implementation arrangements, consultations \nwith the MOFT and the program director, progress with the policy reform agenda, and capacity \ndevelopment measures. ADB will also field regular review missions, including a midterm review \nmission  and  a  program  completion  review  mission  3  months  after  completion.  The  review \nmissions  will  assess  progress  and  identify  any  necessary  changes  in  program  and  project \n\n\fdesign, the implementation schedule and/or implementation arrangements, and compliance with \nthe terms of conditions of the loan agreements.  \n \nG. \n\nADB\u2019s Coordination with Other Development Partners \n\n57. \nADB\u2019s close coordination with IMF, the World Bank, and other development partners is \ndescribed in Appendix 3, Table A3.2. The Program is being parallel financed by IMF and World \nBank.  ADB  and  IMF  staff  have  been  cooperating  closely  to  develop  an  economic  recovery \npackage,  and  IMF  has  endorsed  the  policy  matrix  of  the  Program.  IMF  reached  a  staff-level \nagreement with the Government in August 2009 for a Stand-By Arrangement of SDR67 million \n(about  $88  million).  IMF  board  approval  is  envisaged  in  early  December  2009.  The  Stand-By \nArrangement supports stabilization measures based on a macroeconomic and fiscal framework \nand is in line with resources to ensure overall debt sustainability. It will include policy actions to \nimprove  the  fiscal  and  balance  of  payments  position  and  to  strengthen  the  financial  sector. \nApart from balance of payments support, IMF is providing assistance for better management of \nTreasury bills system and open market operations, as well as for drafting the fiscal responsibility \nlegislation.  World  Bank  support  is  expected  to  cover  pension  and  civil  service  reforms.  In \naddition, the International Finance Corporation is providing advisory support for the privatization \nof  SOEs,  and  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  is  providing  assistance  to  the \nGovernment to transform its political manifesto into a national development plan. \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n58. \nThe  country  partnership  strategy  recognized  that  human  resource  deficiencies  are  a \nsignificant  binding  constraints  on  the  Government's  economic  management.  Given  that  a \nnumber  of  new  economic  measures  are  to  be  pursued  under  the  Program,  technical  support \nneeds to be provided to ensure the Government can implement these initiatives successfully. A \nTA package of $4.5 million is therefore proposed. This will comprise (i) a TA loan of $1.5 million \nfor supporting capacity development and privatization initiatives, and (ii) TA grant of $3.0 million \nfrom  ADB's  TA  Special Fund-IV  for institutional strengthening  initiatives.  Details  of  the  various \npackages under both the TA loan and TA grant are in Appendix 6.  \n \nThe  primary  outcome  of  the  TA  package  will  be  significant  capacity  development  in \n59. \ngovernment  institutions  responsible  for  economic  management  in  general  and  implementation \nof the Program in particular. A key objective of the TA package is to enable the Government to \ncomply with all policy actions under the Program in a timely manner.  \n \nA. \n\nTechnical  Assistance  Loan  (Project  Loan  for  Capacity  Development  for  the \nProgram) \n\n1. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n60. \nThe impact of the TA loan will be to enhance the Government's capacity to accomplish \nthe  policy  and  institutional  reforms  supported  by  the  Program.  The  outcomes  will  be  \n(i) capacity development of the EA and the implementing agencies by training large numbers of \nofficials  by  consultants  in  conjunction  with  local  training  institutions;  and  (ii)  capacity \ndevelopment  of  the  Privatization  Committee  and  Invest  Maldives  to  expedite  ongoing \nprivatization of SOEs. Advance action on this TA will support targeted tranche reform measures \nunder the Program within the implementation period.7 \n\n                                                 \n7  The Government has been advised that such advance action does not commit ADB to finance the TA.  \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n2. \n\nOutputs \n\n \n61. \nDeepening overall capacity. One component of the TA loan will be the strengthening of \ncapacity and professional skills of the EA. This will include support for implementing agencies to \nenable them to carry out the policy reforms and actions specified in the Program\u2019s policy matrix. \nTA  support  will  be  provided  for  institutional  and  human  resource  capacity  building  to  develop \nskills  in  management,  leadership,  facilitation,  negotiation,  and  conflict  resolution,  as  well  as \ntraining to implement policy and procedural actions under the Program. To ensure the efficient \ntraining  of  large  numbers  of  officials,  trained  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  conjunction  with \nlocal training institutions. \n \n62. \nStrengthening  privatization  framework.  Another component of the TA loan will focus \non capacity building of the Privatization Committee and its secretariat, Invest Maldives. This will \ninclude the following activities: (i) preparation of the framework on the basis of which the SOEs \nidentified  for  reforms  will  be  categorized  into  those  to  be  retained  and  restructured  under \nGovernment  ownership,  those  to  be  privatized,  and  those  to  be  closed;  (ii)  preparation  of \nguidelines  for  financial  restructuring  detailing  the  procedure  for  implementing  a  financial \nrestructuring  plan  for  loss-making  entities;  (iii)  preparation  of  a  redundancy  package  for \nemployees of SOEs, (iv) assisting the Government to enforce the institutional structure for SOE \nreforms under Privatization Committee to address issues that arise from individual SOEs being \nsponsored by different ministries; and (v) preparation of guidelines on the privatization process \nfor  ensuring  that  the  Government  ownership  shares  in  SOEs  identified  for  privatization  are \ndivested through a fair, transparent, and objective bidding process. \n \nThe  privatization  component  will  assist  the  Government  in  conceptualizing,  preparing, \n63. \nand  developing  projects  that  involve  private  companies  on  a  public\u2013private  partnership  basis. \nThe  TA  Project  will  recommend  the  optimum  project  structure  to  attract  competitive  bids  from \nthe private sector, form the basis of a contract between the private sector and the Government, \nand bring the projects to financial closure. \n \n\n3. \n\nCost and Financing \n\n \nThe  TA  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR939,000  ($1.5 million  equivalent) \n64. \nfrom ADB's Special Funds resources will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, and an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter.

The  TA  grant  will  therefore  help  to  build  DIR's  capacity  to  introduce  the  new  taxes \nsmoothly.  Other  taxation-related  activities  will  include  (i)  reviewing  the  reform  strategy  and \nmanuals previously prepared by ADB,8 (ii) assessing capacity constraints to ensure effective tax \nadministration  within  DIR,  and  (iii)  recommending  organizational  restructuring.  In  addition,  the \nTA  grant  will  assist  in  developing  and  conducting  surveys,  workshops,  and  public  awareness \ncampaigns for the taxpayers, and preparing a road map and a list of large taxpayers. Further, \nthe  TA  grant  will  assist  in  developing  staff  instructions,  and  providing  training  on  tax  audit \ntechniques,  reviewing  and  assessing  automation  at  DIR,  and  recommending  suggestions  on \nhardware and software.  \n \n67. \nThe TA grant includes capacity building of MOFT through (i) a study on SOE outstanding \nliabilities,  i.e.,  circular  debt;  (ii)  a  framework  for  cash  flow  projections  on  both  revenue  and \nexpenditure,  (iii)  support  for  the  debt  management  component  of  the  Program,  and \n(iv) continued  capacity  building  of  the  Internal  Audit  Unit  of  MOFT  (which  has  already  begun \nunder ongoing ADB TA9 funded by the Australian Agency for International Development, and (v) \ndeveloping budget programming frameworks, including performance-based budgeting, monthly \nand ex-post evaluation of budget implementation.  \n \n68. \nTimely implementation of the portfolios of ADB and other development partners is critical \nto avoid cost overruns, strengthen results orientation, and enhance development effectiveness. \nThe  TA  grant  will  support  fully  staffed  apex  PMU  and  functional  TPMUs  at  two  ministries, \nincluding  institutionalizing  mechanisms  for  quarterly  portfolio  performance.

Monitoring  and  evaluation.  Institutional  strengthening  through  results-based  capacity \ndevelopment  is  a  necessary  condition  for  policy  ownership  and  effective  management  of  the \neconomy.

By  undertaking  long  overdue  structural  reforms,  the  Program  will  move  the \nMaldives  toward  a  more  broad-based  sustainable  development  framework  that  reduces  its   \nvulnerability  to  external  shocks  and  prepares  it  for  scheduled  graduation  to  middle-income \ncountry  status  on  1  January  2011.  The  key  end-of-program  outcomes  will  be  greater  financial \nflexibility and improved management of the Government budget through a more diversified tax \nbase,  more  rational  expenditure,  and  better  debt  management.  The  Program  will  support  the \nprivatization  of  SOEs  and  deepen  the  financial  market  through  the  issuance  of  Treasury  bills \nand bonds. \n \n82. \nThe  Program  is  expected  to  increase  tax  collection,  improve  expenditure  management \nsystems, and support the Government to divest itself of SOEs. These measures should lead to \na reduction in macroeconomic imbalances, and improvements in macroeconomic management. \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nOver  the  medium  term,  it  is  expected  that  project  performance  ratios,  including  portfolio \nperformance indicators, will strengthen significantly thereby improving aid effectiveness.  \n \n83. \nStrengthening  the  Maldives'  macroeconomic  profile,  improving  the  alignment  between \ndevelopment spending and sector priorities and programs, introducing new taxes, rationalizing \nexpenditures, and making progress toward the divestment and privatization of SOEs will expand \nthe  economic  base  to  support  more  broad-based  economic  growth,  and  equip  government \nagencies with modern analytical tools to manage the development process, facilitate the inflow \nof foreign direct investment, and smooth the transition to a middle-income country status.   \n \nB. \n\nRisk Analysis \n\nBy  their  nature,  economic  reform  programs  carry  risks,  including  political  risks.  In  this \n84. \ncase, the political risks are mitigated to a significant degree by the strong prior actions that have \nbeen  taken.  In  contrast  to  previous  practice,  the  Government  has  strong  ownership  of  the \nProgram  and  the  reform  agenda  at  all  levels.  The  President  himself  has  been  a  leading \nchampion  of  the  reform  process.  The  Government  has  been  candid  about  the  comprehensive \nnature of the economic reforms it needs to undertake. This will help to mitigate the political risks \nand expedite the legislative approval process.  \n \nThe budget financing gap remains large and there is a risk that it may deteriorate further, \n85. \ngiven the uncertainty of realizing privatization proceeds. However, a Government IMF program \nwill set out the medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal framework and support policy measures \nthat will contribute to the timely implementation of the reforms.   \n  \n86. \nThere is limited capacity across government, including in the area of procurement. The \nProgram  includes  the  implementation  of  new  taxes,  strengthening  of  internal  audit,  and \ncommencement  of  the  privatization  process,  all  of  which  require  specialized  expertise.  The \nProgram  addresses  these  constraints  by  providing  capacity  building  TA  as  a  part  of  package \nthat will mitigate the risks that arise during the procurement and administrative procedures.  \n \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n87. \nassurances, which will be incorporated into the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\nThe  Government  will  promptly  adopt  the  policies  and  take  the  actions  as \nspecified in the development policy letter and the policy matrix, and ensure that \nsuch  policies  and  actions  continue  in  effect  during  and  after  the  period  of  the \nProgram; \n\nThe Government will ensure that the policies adopted and actions taken prior to \nthe Program as described in the development policy letter will continue in effect \nfor the duration of the program period and subsequently;  \n\nThe  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  that  may  have  implications  for  the \nimplementation  of  the  Program,  and  will  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to \ncomment on any resulting policy proposals;  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n\f \n(iv) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\n \n\nThe Government will use local currency funds generated by the program loan to \nmeet the program expenditures and associated costs of reforms; and ensure that \nnecessary budgetary allocations are provided to meet the recurrent costs under \nthe technical assistance; \n\n \n(v)  Within  1  month  of  the  effective  date  of  the  program  loan,  the  Government  will \ncause MOFT to set up a steering committee, designate the minister of state for \nfinance  as  a  chairperson,  and  appoint  a  secretary  of  the  steering  committee  in \nconsultation with ADB as the program director;  \n\n(vi)  Within 2 months of the effective date of the program loan, MOFT will ensure that \n\nthe first meeting of the steering committee is convened;  \n\nThe  Government  will  use  its  best  efforts  to  reduce  staff  turnover  in  MOFT \n(Budget,  Economic  Affairs  and  Policy,  External  Resources  Management, \nTreasury  and  Public  Accounts,  Finance  and  Treasury  Management,  and  Public \nEnterprise Monitoring and Evaluation), DIR, MMA, and Invest Maldives;  \n\n \n(viii)  Within  4  months  of  the  effective  date  of  the  program  loan,  the  Government  will \ncause MOFT to establish a program performance monitoring system acceptable \nto ADB;  \n\nThe Government will cause the apex PMU to monitor program progress as part \nof  its  broader  development  management  process  related  to  implementation  of \nexternally assisted projects; and \n\nThe Government will undertake mitigation measures to ensure good governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency  consistent  with  the  findings  of  governance \nassessment carried out by ADB under its Second Governance and Anticorruption \nAction Plan.  \n\n \nB. \n \n88. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe following are the conditions for program loan effectiveness: \n\nCompliance with all the first tranche policy actions as set out in the policy matrix; \nand  \n\nEstablishment  of  a  fully  staffed  apex  PMU  under  MOFT  for  monitoring  of \nexternally assisted development projects. \n\nVIII.

The \n1. \nGovernment  included  large  reconstruction  outlays  in  the  budget,  but  also  pushed  up  current \nspending,  both  to  raise  public  sector  wages  and  to  maintain  subsidies  in  Mal\u00e9\u2014especially  for \npower generated by oil-fired generating plants. Total expenditure jumped to about 60% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in 2008 from 40% in 2004. Revenue increased with the help of tsunami \nreconstruction  grants  and  import  growth,  but  not  enough  to  cover  the  expenditure.  The  fiscal \ndeficit escalated to 13% of GDP in 2008 from below 5% in 2004. \n  \nStructural  constraints  have  weakened  macroeconomic  fundamentals,  resulting  in  both \n2. \ndomestic  and  external  imbalances.  The  large  fiscal  deficit  exerted  significant  pressure  on  the \nbalance of payments. The economy is particularly vulnerable to the global slowdown as tourism \naccounts  for  more  than  a  quarter  of  GDP  and  has  significant  knock-on  effects  on  aggregate \ndemand in the economy.  \n \n3. \nIn 2008, the Maldives faced revenue and foreign exchange shortfalls and as a result two \nplanned major infrastructure projects totaling $190 million were not awarded. The Government \nwanted to fill the revenue gap by tendering leases for new resorts on 30 islands, as well as by a \n20%  reduction  in  budgeted  expenditure  for  the  last  few  months  of  2008.  However,  it  did  not \nproceed with the tenders and instead found alternative revenue from bilateral and commercial \nexternal sources.  \n \n4. \nThe new government elected in November 2008 revised the 2009 budget in May 2009 to \nreflect  its  political  manifesto.  The  revised  budget  is  a  first  attempt  to  rationalize  expenditure \nwithin  the  constrained  resources  available  and  to  decrease  expenditure.  However,  it  is  not \ncertain  whether  the  measures  in  the  revised  budget  will  take  effect  in  2009.  Faced  with  a \nrevenue  shortfall,  the  Government  may  need  to  decrease  expenditure  further  to  avoid  a  large \nfiscal deficit. Export-Import Bank of India will provide a loan facility of $300 million, of which $50 \nmillion will be included to the government budget. This will give temporary financial relief. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Summary of Government Finance \n\n(% of GDP) \n\nItem \nTotal Revenue and Grants \n Current Revenue \n Capital Revenue \n Grants \nExpenditure and Net Lending \n Current Expenditure \n Capital Expenditure \n Net Lending \nOverall Balance \n Foreign Financing \n Domestic Financing \nTotal Debt (end of period) \n Foreign \n Domestic \n\n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Maldives Monetary Authority. \n\n2001 \n33.0 \n30.0 \n0.2 \n2.8 \n37.7 \n25.8 \n12.3 \n(0.3) \n(4.7) \n1.9 \n2.8 \n43.5 \n23.9 \n19.5 \n\n2002 \n33.1 \n31.4 \n0.1 \n1.6 \n38.0 \n25.7 \n12.5 \n(0.2) \n(4.9) \n4.5 \n0.4 \n47.0 \n26.9 \n20.2 \n\n \n\n2003 \n34.8 \n33.1 \n0.3 \n1.4 \n38.2 \n26.5 \n13.6 \n(1.8) \n(3.4) \n4.7 \n(1.3) \n46.1 \n29.6 \n16.5 \n\n2004 \n34.5 \n33.5 \n0.2 \n0.7 \n36.0 \n28.1 \n10.0 \n(2.0) \n(1.6) \n4.1 \n(2.5) \n43.1 \n30.5 \n12.6 \n\n2005 \n48.1 \n39.1 \n0.4 \n8.6 \n59.0 \n48.4 \n11.8 \n(1.2) \n(10.9) \n2.4 \n8.4 \n52.6 \n34.0 \n18.7 \n\n2006 \n52.5 \n44.7 \n0.4 \n7.4 \n59.3 \n47.9 \n12.4 \n(1.0) \n(6.8) \n4.5 \n2.3 \n50.9 \n32.4 \n18.5 \n\n2007 \n56.1 \n48.1 \n0.3 \n7.7 \n60.8 \n48.6 \n13.1 \n(0.9) \n(4.7) \n4.6 \n0.1 \n51.7 \n32.7 \n19.0 \n\n2008 \n48.1 \n44.4 \n0.3 \n3.5 \n60.7 \n49.2 \n12.5 \n(1.1) \n(12.6) \n3.8 \n8.8 \n53.9 \n31.2 \n22.7 \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nB. \n\nStructure of Revenue and Expenditure \n\n5. \nThe  Maldives'  public  finances  depend  on  a  narrow  revenue  base.  Tax  revenue,  which \naccounts for about half of domestic revenue, is concentrated on import duties and tourism tax. \nTourists  are  subject  to  an  $8  per-person  per-night  tourism  tax.  This  is  collected  by  the  tourist \nresorts  and  has  given  resorts  an  incentive  to  focus  on  high-end  market.  Rent  from  leasing \nresorts and dividends from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are the principal sources of nontax \nrevenue.  SOEs  are  engaged  in  a  wide  range  of  economic  activities,  including  utility  services \nsuch as water and power, transport, communications, trading, construction, and finance.  \n\n \nTable A2.2: Current Revenue \n\nItem \nTax Revenue \n Import Duty \n Tourism Tax \n Bank Profit Tax \n Others \nNontax Revenue \n Net Sales of SOEs \n Resort Lease Rent \n Others \nCurrent Revenue \n\n2007 \n\nRf million \n2,905.1\n2,086.5\n547.3\n169.0\n102.3\n3,585.6\n788.5\n1,668.7\n\n6,490.7\n\n(%) \n44.8\n32.1\n8.4\n2.6\n1.6\n55.2\n12.1\n25.7\n17.4\n100.0\n\n2008 \n\n \n  Rf million \n(%) \n3,392.9 \n47.4 \n2,459.9 \n34.4 \n588.7 \n8.2 \n240.8 \n3.4 \n103.5 \n1.4 \n3,766.3 \n52.6 \n1,135.4 \n15.9 \n1,513.6 \n21.1 \n15.6 \n \n7,159.2  100.0 \n\nSOE = state-owned enterprise. \nNote: 2008 data are based on the revised estimate.

Mal\u00e9. \n\n \n6. \nSince  2005,  higher  public  sector  wages  and  power  subsidies  in  Mal\u00e9  and  tsunami \nreconstruction outlays pushed up fiscal expenditures. In fact, the increase in current expenditure \noutstripped that of capital, raising the current expenditure share by 10% of total expenditure.   \n\n \n\nFigure A2.1: Breakdown of Total Expenditure \n\n90%\n80%\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008\n\n   Current Expenditure\n\n  Capital Expenditure \n\n \n\nSource: MOFT. 2009.

The  recent  increase  was  driven  mainly  by  domestic  debt:  about  60%  of \noutstanding public debt is denominated in foreign currency.  \n \n8. \nAn  assessment  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  concluded  that  the \nsustainability of the public debt depends largely on the strength of adjustment efforts, including \na  significant  fiscal  retrenchment  and  possible  arrangements  with  international  financial \ninstitutions.  Without  such  adjustments,  the  public  debt  ratio  will  increase  substantially  to  an \nunsustainable level over the medium term.   \n \n \n\nFigure A2.2: Public Debt Outstanding \n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n0%\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n   Source: Maldives Monetary Authority. \n\nForeign\n\nDomestic\n\nTotal Debt\n\n \n\n \n \nD. \n\nImpact on External Sector Imbalances  \n\n9. \nAs  the  economy  is  driven  by  the  public  sector  (fiscal  expenditure  accounts  for  67%  of \nGDP  in  2009),  fiscal  expansion  has  a  substantial  impact  on  aggregate  demand  and  widens \nexternal imbalances. Imports for reconstruction and new resort development, a general demand \nincrease,  and  higher  international  commodity  prices  in  2008  have  increased  the  trade  deficit \nsubstantially. With only moderate growth in tourism receipts, the current account deficit widened \nsharply to 51.7% of GDP in 2008 from 15.8% in 2004. Although there were still large net inflows \ndriven by resources for resort development (other investment), the overall balance of payments \nmoved into deficit (a negative 5.4% of GDP) in 2008. As the global financial crisis deepens and \nthe capital inflow dries up, there will continue to be balance-of-payments risks. \n \n\nItem \nCurrent Account \n Balance on Goods (net) \n Balance on Services (net) \n Balance on Income (net) \n\nTable A2.3: Summary of Balance of Payments \n(% of GDP) \n2002 \n(5.6)\n(33.1)\n(39.3)\n(5.5)\n\n2001 \n(9.8)\n(39.5)\n40.9 \n(6.2)\n\n2003 \n(4.5)\n(37.9)\n45.0 \n(5.5)\n\n2005 \n(36.4)\n(65.9)\n14.6 \n(4.1)\n\n2004 \n(15.8)\n(49.4)\n(45.1)\n(4.5)\n\n2006 \n(33.0) \n(64.5) \n35.0 \n(4.5) \n\n2007 \n(41.5)\n(69.9)\n36.0 \n(6.4)\n\n2008 \n(51.7)\n(70.7)\n28.2 \n(5.1)\n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nItem \n Current Transfers (net) \nCapital Account \nFinancial Account \n FDI (net) \n Portfolio Investment (net) \n Other Investment (net) \nNet Errors and Omissions \nOverall Balance \n\n2001 \n(5.0)\n0.0 \n5.6 \n2.0 \n0.0 \n3.7 \n(0.8)\n(5.0)\n\n2002 \n(6.2)\n0.0 \n11.5 \n1.9 \n0.0 \n9.6 \n0.3 \n6.3 \n\n2003 \n(6.1)\n0.0 \n7.3 \n1.9 \n0.0 \n5.4 \n1.0 \n3.8 \n\n2004 \n(6.9)\n0.0 \n19.7 \n1.9 \n0.0 \n17.8 \n1.7 \n5.7 \n\n2005 \n18.9 \n0.0 \n35.2 \n1.3 \n0.0 \n33.9 \n(1.1)\n(2.3)\n\n2006 \n0.9 \n0.0 \n31.7 \n1.5 \n0.0 \n30.2 \n6.2 \n4.9 \n\n2007 \n(1.3)\n0.0 \n40.0 \n1.4 \n0.0 \n40.5 \n6.9 \n7.3 \n\n2008 \n(4.1)\n0.0 \n39.6 \n1.2 \n0.0 \n38.4 \n6.7 \n(5.4)\n\n( ) = negative, FDI = foreign direct investment, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Maldives Monetary Authority. \n \nE. \n\nRevised 2009 Budget and Medium Term Fiscal Framework \n\n10. \n The medium-term tax and expenditure containment measures underpinning the revised \n2009 budget may not achieve the fiscal targets by the stipulated target date. The revised budget \nincluded  a  projected  revenue  increase  from  the  privatization  of  the  Mal\u00e9  International  Airport \n(capital  revenue),  which  is  not  likely  to  occur  in  2009.  The  Government  is  committed  to \ndiversifying revenue away from import duties and has introduced legislation in the parliament for \n(i) levying a tourism goods and services tax (TGST) in lieu of existing fixed bed tax, (ii) business \nprofits  tax,  and  (iii)  increasing  passenger  services  charge  (airport  tax)  from  $12  to  $18.5  per \nticket. Further, in 2011, the Government plans to extend the TGST to non-tourism sectors of the \neconomy.  Significant  preparatory  work  needs  to  be  undertaken  at  an  early  stage  to  introduce \nthe  new  taxes,  especially  the  BPT.  There  is  a  concern  that  the  country  may  not  have  the \ncapacity to introduce these within a relatively short period of time. \n \n11. \nOn the spending side, fiscal policy remains expansionary in 2009. It is unclear how fiscal \nconsolidation  will  be  achieved  against  a  backdrop  of  the  rather  ambitious  and  costly \ndevelopment agenda announced by the President. The MTFF needs to show a clear articulation \nof  a  power  tariff  adjustment  mechanism,  synchronized  with  international  oil  prices  and  the \ncomposition of the wage bill for the public sector.  \n \n\nTable A2.4: Medium-Term Fiscal Framework  \n(% of GDP) \n\nItem \nTotal Revenue and Grants \n Current Revenue \n Capital Revenue \n Grants \nExpenditure and Net Lending \n Current Expenditure \n Capital Expenditure \n Net Lending \nOverall Balance \n Foreign Financing \n Domestic Financing \n\n 2008 \n48.1 \n44.4 \n0.3 \n3.5 \n60.7 \n49.2 \n12.5 \n(1.1) \n(12.6) \n3.8 \n8.8 \n\n2009 \n59.6 \n33.5 \n22.7 \n3.3 \n67.0 \n50.9 \n16.2 \n0.0 \n(7.4) \n8.9 \n(1.5) \n\n2010 \n51.5 \n42.6 \n7.3 \n1.6 \n54.6 \n43.8 \n10.8 \n(0.1) \n(3.1) \n0.9 \n2.2 \n\n2011 \n48.5 \n44.4 \n3.3 \n0.8 \n45.9 \n38.7 \n7.4 \n(0.2) \n2.6 \n(0.5) \n(2.2) \n\n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: MOFT. 2009.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \n1.  As  noted  in  the  country  partnership  strategy,  while  absolute  poverty  has  significantly  declined  for  the  Maldives  as  a \nwhole, there are significant variations within the country. A significant percentage of the people living above the international \npoverty  threshold  may  move  in  and  out  of  poverty.  Inequitable  economic  policies  tend  to  hurt  the  poor  disproportionately. \nFor  example,  excessive  budget  deficits  that  are  monetized  increase  the  inflation  rate,  which  hurts  the  poor.  By  helping  to \nstrengthen  economic  imbalances,  expand  the  resource  base,  and  return  the  country  to  its  previous  growth  trajectory,  the \nProgram will reduce the incidence of poverty and the vulnerabilities of a section of society.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                 Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1. Key Issues  \nIn the Maldives, the main issue relates less to income poverty than to poverty of access and opportunity. With the potential \nfor public sector employment being limited and growth prospects focused on resorts\u2014typically shunned by the Maldivians \non cultural and religious grounds\u2014the key remains to manage the economy in an efficient and equitable manner to ensure \nequal  treatment  for  all  private  sector  participants.  Doing  so  would  open  up  more  income  opportunities,  especially  for  the \nresidents of the atolls.  \n \nThe  Program  would  enable  the  Government  to  restore  equitable  economic  growth,  expand  the  revenue  base,  align \nexpenditures with available resources, and thus reduce the current large fiscal imbalances. These measures, together with \nprudent management of the country's debt and the divestment of loss-making enterprises, would allow the Government to \neven  out  opportunities  of  access  and  undertake  greater  investments  on  health  and  education  that  would  have  a  direct \nimpact on the lives of the poor. \n \n2. Design Features. The Program will contribute to poverty reduction. First, at the macro level, revenue enhancement, debt \nmanagement, expenditure rationalization initiatives, and better financial management will address the fiscal imbalance and \nreduce  the  economy\u2019s  vulnerability  to  external  shocks.  Reducing  the  risk  of  macroeconomic  instability  will  mitigate  the \nlikelihood  of  disorderly  adjustment  and  even  financial  crisis,  which  would  affect  the  poor  in  particular.  Second,  greater \ntransparency  and  efficiency  in  resource  allocation,  achieved  through  reform  of  the  budget  process  and  adoption  of  a \nmedium-term  approach  to  fiscal  policy  planning,  will  reduce  leaks  and  free  up  resources  that  can  be  devoted  to  poverty-\nreducing  investments  in  social  infrastructure,  including  schools,  clinics,  water  treatment  plants,  and  to  their  operation  and \nmaintenance. Third, better integration of the current and capital budget will increase the Government\u2019s capacity to use the \nnational budget more effectively as the principal instrument for translating its development priorities, including the pursuit of \nits national poverty alleviation strategy into concrete expenditure programs. Fourth, the Program will strengthen the project \nimplementation and monitoring capacity within key line ministries, leading to higher disbursement ratios, timely completion \nof projects, better service delivery and enhanced development effectiveness. Fifth, specific revenue augmenting initiatives \nsuch as the introduction of a tourism goods and services tax and business profit tax will increase the resource envelope of \nthe public sector, allowing for more resources to be used to finance poverty relief programs.  \n \nCapacity development initiatives under the TA loan will support the introduction of these reform initiatives, which will extend \nthe benefits of the Program beyond its completion date.   \n\nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nThe Program lays the ground for a sustainable and equitable economic growth trajectory. Currently, one sector\u2014tourism\u2014\ndrives the economy and the owners of these resources have a disproportionate share of national wealth and political power. \nBy  correcting  the  policy  framework,  expanding  the  resource  base,  facilitating  the  divestment  of  loss-making  state-owned \nenterprises,  and  aligning  expenditures  with  revenues  the  Program  would  lift  a  heavy  indirect  burden  of  economic \nmismanagement and benign neglect of structural issues affecting the country. \n \nThe Program will protect vulnerable groups from any adverse effects. For example, under the Program, power tariffs in Mal\u00e9 \nwill  increase progressively to reflect the generation and distribution costs. However, this will be \"means-tested\" to minimize \nthe economic burden on the poor since their power consumption will be below the minimum defined consumption. Similarly, \nthe  business  profits  tax  will  not  be  applicable  to  people  earning  small  incomes.  It  will  be  a  progressive  tax  which  will \nincrease  with income. The Government  will use some of the revenues to provide a stipend  of Rf2,000 a month to people \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n49 \n\nwho are 58 years of age or more. \n \nThese  policy  reforms  will  enable  the  Government  to  increase  expenditures  on  health,  education,  sanitation,  water  supply, \nand immunization. There is a strong correlation between expenditure on social sectors and the achievement of nonincome \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  As  the  reforms  will  help  to  alleviate  structural  constraints,  and  create  more \nopportunities  in  the  private  sector,  the  reforms  will  also  help  in  the  achievement  of  the  income  MDGs.  In  summary,  the \nopportunity cost of not undertaking the economic reforms far outweighs any transitional costs.  \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nDespite the tsunami and the subsequent economic downturn, there is practically no abject poverty or severe malnutrition in \nthe Maldives. Over 1997\u20132004 in Mal\u00e9, the lower-income classes managed to roughly double their incomes while the upper \nincome classes saw their incomes rise more slowly. A similar pattern can be observed in the atolls, where the lower-income \nclasses  increased  their  incomes  by  about  half  while  the  upper-income  classes  did  so  by  only  about  one-third.  However, \ndespite  progress  in  poverty  reduction,  the  population  continues  to  exhibit  a  high  degree  of  vulnerability.  There  is  a  great \ndegree  of  transient  income  poverty,  with  individuals  moving  in  and  out  of  poverty.  Over  the  period  of  three  poverty  and \nvulnerability surveys, only 7% of the original 44% poor remained so throughout and only two out of three nonpoor in 1997 \nremained so throughout the period to 2004. Taken together, this means that during the period 1997\u20132005 more than half of \nthe  island  population  moved  between  poverty  classes  at  least  once.  The  poorest  households  tend  to  be  those  in  which \nfewer household members are employed and which do not receive remittances from family members working in resorts or in \nMal\u00e9. \n \nThe  Program  aims  to  strengthen  macroeconomic  management  by  reducing  fiscal  imbalances,  curtailing  frivolous \nexpenditures, and diversifying the revenue base. Sustained and equitable growth will strengthen the income and opportunity \nprofile  of  the  group  that  experiences  transient  poverty.  A  stable  macroeconomic  structure  will  enable  the  Government  to \nincrease its social sector expenditures, including those on tertiary education.  \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \n2.

Was a C&P plan prepared? \nThe analysis and dialogue to date are based on the results of the consultations that took place  with the Government, the \nChamber of Commerce and various trade bodies such as the Maldives Association of Construction Industry. ADB will work \nwith  the  Government  during  program  implementation  to  ensure  a  wider  consultative  process.  The  Government  has \nannounced  its  plans  publicly  (demonstrating  its  commitment  to  transparency),  and  they  have  been  commented  on  in  the \nmedia and in Parliament; hence. \n\n Yes  \n\n No  \n\nC. Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key  Issues.  Maldivian  women  are  the  most  emancipated  in  South  Asia  and  there  is  no  discrepancy  in  public  and \nprivate  employment  on  account  of  gender.  As  noted  in  the  country  gender  assessment,  Maldivian  women,  because  of \nculture  and  religion,  do  not  opt  to  work  in  the  resorts,  which  limits  their  employment  opportunities.  However,  the  Program \naims  to  strengthen  macroeconomic  management,  which,  among  other  benefits,  will  improve  access  to  incomes  and \nopportunities for women. For a background assessment, see Supplementary Appendix B.a \n \n2.  Key Actions.

\n1. \nconformity  with  the  recommendations  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Second \nGovernance and Anticorruption Action Plan (GACAP II),1  which specifies that program and or \nproject  designs  should  incorporate  the  findings  of  governance,  institutional  and  corruption  risk \nassessments, and that project documentation \u201cclearly identifies risk and risk management and \nmitigation measures.\u201d  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nIn  2008,  the  first  democratic  elections  in  the  Maldives  led  to  a  change  in  government \nafter  30  years.  This  had  been  preceded  by  the  finalization  of  a  new  constitution,  and  in  late \n2008,  there  was  unanimous  passage  of  the  Maldives  Media  Council  Act  to  create  an \nindependent institution to aid press freedom. \n \n \n\nGeneral Background \n\nPublic Management \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional  changes  following  the  promulgation  of  the  new  Constitution  have  included \n3. \nthe  establishment  of  an  Anticorruption  Commission, 2 replacing \nineffectual \nAnticorruption  Board,  and  the  establishment  of  a  number  of  commissions,  including  those  on \nelections,  judicial  service,  civil  service,  and  human  rights.  A  Supreme  Court  has  also  been \nestablished.  There  have  been  some  initial  difficulties  in  these  new  institutions  but  reforms  in \npublic management appear to be on track. Politicization of the bureaucracy remains a risk (e.g., \nin the transfers and appointments of atoll chiefs) and there is a general need to build capacity in \nthe institutions of public management. There has recently been a focus on decentralization, with \nthe country to be divided into regions. According to government plans, a state minister will be \nallocated to the regions. The costs of decentralization have not yet been completely calculated.  \n \n \n\nPrivatization and Private Sector \n\nlargely \n\nthe \n\n2. \n\n4. \nWhile  the  government  has  talked  a  lot  about  privatization,  state-owned  enterprises \n(SOEs)  continue  to  play  a  large  part  in  the  economy,  primarily  in  banking,  transport, \ninternational shipping, communications, electricity, fisheries, and water. This has narrowed the \nscope for the private sector. SOEs have been shielding them from private competition and the \nGovernment  has  provided  them  with  special  benefits  (such  as  below-market  land  rental  rates \nand  additional  financial  benefits).  However,  the  new  government  plans  to  make  substantial \nprogress in privatizing or closing of some SOEs. \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan. Manila. \n2  In October 2008, the Government set up the country\u2019s first independent Anticorruption Commission to replace the \nAnticorruption Board, although four of five members are former members of the previous Anticorruption Board. In \nthat  process,  the  Anticorruption  Commission  also  became  the  first  independent  institution  established  under  the \nnew  Constitution,  ratified  in  August  2008.  The  Anticorruption  Commission  was  established  according  to  the \nAnticorruption Act, 2008. More than 150 cases previously being investigated by the Anticorruption Board have now \nbeen transferred to the Anticorruption Commission. The Anticorruption Board was set up in 1991 but was not very \neffective  as  it  had  little  independence  and  there  was  very  little  transparency  in  its  work.  The  Anticorruption \nCommission\u2019s  work  is  now  being  complemented  by  independent  reports  from  the  auditor  general.  For  example, \nless than 2 days before the first round of polls in September 2008, the auditor general released an audit report on \nthe President's Office revealing Rf47.7 million ($3.7 million) in outstanding loans, which was vehemently opposed \nby the then President. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n55 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nCorruption \n\n5. \nThe  Maldives\u2019  performance  in  the  Transparency  International  index  has  been  slipping. \nThe Maldives dropped 31 places to 115th in 2008 from 84th in 2007, with a score of 2.8. This is \nin  large  part  due  to  weak  accountability  institutions,  including  the  ineffectual  Anticorruption \nBoard,  which  reported  to  the  President  directly  and  whose  reports  were  not  made  publicly \navailable.  Government  accounts  had  not  been  audited  for  27  years  until  2008,  when  the  new \nauditor general took an aggressive stand.  \n \n \n\nPublic Procurement \n\n4. \n\n6. \nGovernment  procurement  is  very  prone  to  corruption.  The  Maldives  has  a  centralized \nprocurement  system  for  all  goods  and  services.  The  public  contracting  regime  applies  to  all \nagencies  across  all  sectors.  The  Tender  Board  procures  all  goods  and  services  and  runs  all \ntenders on behalf of implementing agencies. These guidelines are specified in tender rules and \nregulations  and  financial  manuals.  They  cover  provisions  relating  to  procurement  procedures, \nqualification  of  bidders,  organization  of  procurement,  criteria  for  awarding  contracts,  and \ncontract  formalities.  The  Government\u2019s  procurement  policy  is  aimed  at  promoting  an  open \npurchasing policy and getting value for money for the Government.  \n \nThe  Tender  Board,  which  is  serviced  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury,  has  a \n7. \nhigh-powered  membership  including  the  auditor  general  and  attorney  general.  Implementing \nministries  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Atolls  Development  (MOAD)  and  Ministry  of  Transportation \nand Communication (MTC) play a tightly defined and constrained role and must regularly report \nprogress on projects to the Tender Board. The system appears to be respected by companies \ntendering  for  projects  but  procedural  weaknesses  have  been  identified  that  may  lead  to \ncorruption.  There  is  no  evidence  of  an  evaluation  of  completed  projects  and  greater \ntransparency on tender progress and results is needed.  \n \nC. \n \n8. \nThis  section  discusses  risks  within  the  context  of  the  Government\u2019s  own  strategy  for \neconomic  and  financial  management.  Since  the  identification,  specification,  and  determination \nof severity of the risks are subject to different interpretations, the assessment has been shared \nwith the Government, and the analysis presented here reflects its views as well. \n \n\nRisks, Risk Severity, and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nUnderlying Assumptions \n\n \n9. \nThe main underlying assumptions that are made here are that (i) there is considerable \nconsensus  on  the  need  for  reforms  to  address  structural  problems  that  have  been  left \nunattended for some time, and that Government will stay the course in political and economic \nreforms; (ii) there is a dire need to set public finances on a sustainable path; and (iii) effective \ninstitution building in key institutions needs to proceed as currently planned.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSummary Risk Matrix \n\n10.

The  assessment  also  recommends  acquiring  information  during  program \nimplementation  on  (i)  activities  undertaken  and  proposed  to  manage  the  governance  risks; \n(ii) risks  that  are  seriously  undermining  the  development  and  implementation  of  Program \nreforms;  (iii)  the  status  of  engagement  of  all  related  stakeholders  in  the  Program,  and  the \nsharing of program information; and (iv) program output indicators that validate improvements in \npolicies, legislation, capacity development, and accountability.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9    \n\n59\n\nCOST OF ADJUSTMENT \n \n\n1. \nReducing  recurrent  expenditures  is  the  key  to  reducing  the  macroeconomic  imbalance \nand  to  aligning  expenditures  with  revenues.  The  Government  plans  to  enhance  the  revenue \nbase  by  introducing  a  number  of  new  taxes.  However,  it  will  take  time  for  these  to  generate \naccumulated revenues, so in the short to medium term, expenditure restraint is the only viable \nway to reduce fiscal imbalance. \n \nSome  70%\u201375%  of  recurrent  expenditure  is  currently  consumed  by  the  public  sector \n2. \nwage  bill.  The  Government  intends  to  reduce  the  size  of  the  civil  service  during  2009\u20132011. \nWhile  the  benefits  of  an  efficient  and  leaner  civil  service  will  be  felt  in  time,  in  the  short  to \nmedium  term,  the  Government  needs  to  have  access  to  resources  to  finance  the  redundancy \npackage, retraining the workforce, and helping the redundant workforce to either start their own \nbusinesses,  or  to  seek  higher  qualifications.

Further, new revenues will start to generate yields only after \n1\u20132  years.  Therefore,  the  analysis  assumes  that,  during  the  program  period,  the  Government \nconverts  the  circular  debt  into  a  3-year  bond  issue,  which  is  held  by  STO  and  that  STELCO \nreceives  interest  on  this  holding.  The  interest  cost  is  included  in  the  cost  of  adjustment.  It  is \nassumed that after 3 years, with economic recovery on a firm footing and additional revenues \ncoming in, the Government would be able to pay off the loan\u2014as a bullet loan. \n \n4. \nWith  regard  to  reducing  the  dependence  on  ways  and  means  advances  to  finance  the \ndeficit,  it  is  assumed  that  the  outstanding  balance  of  Rf1.6  billion  will  first  be  converted  into  a \nbond  issue  with  commercial  interest  paid  on  it.  During  the  program  period,  there  is  no  net \naddition, and subsequently a new agreement is reached reducing the threshold, and paying off \nthe  reduced  amount.  The  Government  would  continue  to  pay  the  commercial  rate  even  if  a \nreduced threshold is agreed. \n \n\nTable A9.4: Indicative Program Adjustment Costs for the Economic Recovery Program \n($ million) \n\nOutputs and Areas for Support \n1.  \n2.  \n3.  \n4.  \n5.  \n6.  \n7.  \n\n \nCivil service redundancy package \nSME loans (for redundant civil servants) \nHigher education loans (for redundant civil servants) \nTraining (TVET) (for redundant civil servants) \nTVET capital costs (related to redundancy program) \nAccrued government pension liability \nThree-year interest cost of converting $40 million circular debt into Government \nbondsa \nInterest cost of conversion of Rf1.6 billion W&MA to a 3-year bond issue at 13% \n\nSubtotal \n\n8.  \n \n9.  \n10.

It would \nbe unrealistic to ask the Government of the Maldives to pay-off the entire $40 million up-front in one go, when \nthe Program money is to be received in tranches. The assumption is that by the end of year 3, with revenues \nfrom new sources coming in, the Government can retire the bond issue. But at the very inception of the bond \nissue, STELCO gets cleared of its liability and can be privatized. \nSource: Asian Development Bank and Government of the Maldives estimates. \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\nItem\n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES (TA LOAN AND TA GRANT) \n\nADB Loan\n\nComponent 1\nGov't.\nADB\n\nComponent 2\nADB\n\nGov't.\n\nComponent 3\nADB\n\nGov't.\n\nADB Grant\nComponent 4\nADB\n\nGov't.\n\nComponent 5\nADB \n\nGov't.\n\nTotal\n\nADB \n\nGov't.\n\nA.
