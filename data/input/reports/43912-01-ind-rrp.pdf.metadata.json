With increased urbanization, this can be a \nbarrier  to  equitable  and  widespread  economic  growth  and  is \nleading  to  increased  private  vehicle  use.  This  stimulates  traffic \ndelays,  environmental  degradation,  inefficient  fuel  consumption, \nand economic losses through time wastage. \n \nThe  project  directly  addresses  these  challenges  to  Bangalore\u2019s \ngrowth and environment by creating a modern mass transit system \nthat  supports  economic  growth,  employment  generation,  and \nequitable  connectivity.  It  also  mitigates  environmental  pollution  by \nproviding  an  alternative  to  private  vehicles.  The  project  will \nestablish  an  ultimately  sustainable  urban  transport  company  with \nsound  institutional  and  governance  structures,  based  on  an \ninnovative urban transport financing model. This is a first for India \nand could become a model for infrastructure development in other \nstates and cities.  \n \nThe  focus  is  on  creating  a  commercially  viable  and  bankable \nproject  that  can  successfully  attract  commercial  debt,  and  which \nholds the potential for future wider private sector participation. The \nproject  structure,  which  uses  sovereign  loans  and  support  to \nleverage  commercial  lending,  creates  a  self-sustaining  model  for \nfinancing  urban  transport  projects.  These  projects  are  typically \namongst  the  most  difficult  infrastructure  projects  to  finance,  and \nare the ones which least lend themselves to up front private sector \n\n\f \nProject Sponsors \n \nProposed ADB \nAssistance \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nJustification / ADB \nValue-Added \n\nii \n\n \n \n\nloan  (without  sovereign \n\nparticipation.

It  is  also  one  which  should  help \ncatalyze  commercial  debt  and  private  sector  participation  on  a \nmuch wider basis across the country in future. \n \nImplementation  of  the  project  will  result  in  a  modal  shift  toward \npublic  transportation  and  lower  levels  of  congestion  with  a \nsubstantial  reduction  in  the  number  of  buses  and  use  of  private \nvehicles. This will lead to fuel savings, improvements in air quality \nand public health, time savings, and less accidents and fatalities.  \n \nThe Government of India and the Government of Karnataka. \n \nADB  will  provide  a  direct  secured \nguarantee) to BMRC of up to $250,000,000.  \n \nBMRC has been constituted as a special-purpose vehicle with both \nsponsors  having  an  equal  shareholding.  Given  the  importance  of \nthe  project  and  the  impossibility  of  financing  it  on  a  stand-alone \nbasis,  the  sponsors  have  committed  significant  support  to  the \nproject in the form of equity and subordinated debt. The sponsors \nhave  drawn  together  experts  from  various  agencies  and  have \nengaged an external technical consultant to carry out the design of \nthe  metro  rail  transit  system  and  assist  BMRC  with  procurement, \nconstruction,  and  commissioning  of  the  project,  as  well  as  the \ntraining  of  operation  and  management  personnel.  Procurement  of \ngoods  and  services  is  being  undertaken  by  BMRC  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Around  80%  of  construction \ncontracts  have  been  awarded  and  about  33%  of  physical \nconstruction has been completed as of end December 2010. \n \nADB  support  provides  crucial  credibility  to  the  project  which  has \nseveral  pioneering  features,  including  lending  and  institutional \nstructures.  Successful  implementation  will  set  the  precedent  for \nsimilar  financing  models  for  urban  transport  as  well  as  provide \ncost-effective  connectivity  solutions  for  middle-sized  and  large \nIndian  cities,  which  are  suffering  from  public  transport  gaps  and \nexponential  private  vehicle  growth  leading  to  increased  pollution, \naccidents, and travel delays.  \n \nThe  project\u2019s  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements  will  help \npromote  strong  governance, \nrobust \ninstitutional  accountability,  and  overall  efficiency  in  operations. \nADB\u2019s participation, capital structuring, and due diligence will help \nmobilize  long-term  debt  funding  and  catalyze  domestic  financial \ninstitutions  to  consider  long-term  loans  for  the  project  and  other \nsimilar projects. \n \n\nfinancial  sustainability, \n\n\f     \n\n \n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  Bangalore  Metro  Rail  Corporation  (BMRC)  for  the  Bangalore  Metro  Rail  Transit  System \nProject.  \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\n \nA. \n \n\nProject Identification and Selection \n\n1. \n\nProject Development \n\n \nGiven  the  need  for  effective  public  transport  solutions  to  meet  the  increasing \n2. \nurbanization-driven  challenges  in  the  city,  the  Government  of  India  and  the  state  government \n(sponsor(s))  examined  a  number  of  possible  urban  transport  solutions  for  the  city,  including \ndifferent  modalities.  The  rail-based  mass  transit  system  was  viewed  by  the  sponsors  as  most \nappropriate for the city.  \n \n\nGovernment Financing Approach and Asian Development Bank Involvement \n\n2. \n  \nUnlike  the  Delhi  metro  that  is  fully  funded  by  government  equity  and  sovereign-\n3. \nguaranteed  debt,  the  national  and  state  governments  decided  to  create  a  new  financing  model \nfor the project which would only partly rely on government funds (through a mix of government \nequity, government subordinated debt, and onlending from the national government of the Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  official  development  assistance  (ODA)  loan,  and \nleverage these so as to also raise commercial debt from banks and/or private financing sources. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB), through a number of technical assistance programs,T\nT has \nbeen assisting the national government since 2007 in developing bankable infrastructure project \nmodels  able  to  access  new  financing  sources  without  recourse  to  sovereign  government \nguarantees,  whether  through  commercial  nonrecourse  debt  or  public\u2013private  partnerships \n(PPPs).  The  possible  use  of  ADB\u2019s  new  lending  modalities,  i.e.,  nonsovereign  public  sector \nloans, was a factor in this structuring decision.  \n \n4. \nInitial discussions were held with the national and state governments and BMRC in early \n2009 with a view to including the project under this proposed assistance modality. Due diligence \nand structuring assistance to BMRC to help develop a bankable and leveraged financing model \nfor  the  project  was  provided  by  the  ADB  team  and  consultant  financial  modeling  specialists. \nDiscussions  were  also  held  with  the  national  government\u2019s  Ministry  of  Urban  Development  on \npossible  financing  models.  After  preliminary  national  government  approval  of  the  initial \nstructuring model for BMRC and the acceptance of nonsovereign public sector lending modalities \nfor  the  project,  a  final  phase  of  technical,  social,  and  environmental  impact  assessments  was \nundertaken.  \n \nB. \n \n\nSector Background \n\n1\n\nFP\n\nPF\n\n1. \n\nMetro Rail Systems \n\n \n5. \nUrban transport is a critical component of urban services. Apart from allowing direct and \nefficient travel, it also creates a better urban environment by reducing congestion and pollution. \n                                                 \n1\nT  ADB.  2007.  Pilot  Projects  Initiative:  Mainstreaming  PPPs  in  India.  Manila;  and  ADB.  2009.  Developing  Urban \n\nBankable Projects. Manila.  \n\n \n\nT\nP\nP\n\f2  \n \n\n \n\nEconomic  benefits  of  rail  systems  are  significant  and  include  savings  in  travel  time,  reduced \noperating  costs,  safer  transportation  with  lower  levels  of  accidents  and  related  fatalities,  and \nlower  levels  of  local  pollution.  The  higher  level  of  connectivity  and  efficiency  makes  the  rail \nsystem  more  attractive  to  businesses  and  tourists,  thereby  attracting  investments  and \ncontributing to economic growth. Rail-based urban transit systems have an advantage over road-\nbased  systems  in  terms  of  efficiency  and  carrying  capacity,  especially  when  catering  to  heavy \npassenger traffic in densely populated areas. In developed countries, most large cities have rail-\nbased  mass  transit  railways  as  the  core  of  their  transport  systems.  However,  in  developing \ncountries there has not been enough emphasis on mass transit or integrated city planning, with \nthe result that many metropolitan cities depend predominantly on private transport modes. With \nincreasing road congestion and pollution, cities are being forced to examine and develop better \nmeans  of  transportation.  Therefore,  rail-based  metro  systems,  with  their  substantial  carrying \ncapacity, are a mode of choice for large cities with high passenger traffic densities. \n \n6. \nIn  India,  Mumbai  and  Chennai  had the  legacy of  a  suburban  rail  system,  but  the  city  of \nKolkata developed India\u2019s first new metro rail system implemented by Indian Railways. The Delhi \nMetro  Rail  Corporation  (DMRC)  developed  its  large  metro  system  for  Delhi  as  a  stand-alone \nproject. Subsequent to this, Bangalore proposed a metro system through a joint-venture initiative \nbetween  the  national  and  state  governments.  Chennai  is  following  a  similar  model  in \ncollaboration  with  the  national  government.  Mumbai  and  Hyderabad  have  awarded  metro \nsystems  through  a  PPP  approach  as  build\u2013operate\u2013transfer  projects.  Jaipur,  Kochi,  and  other \ncities are examining development of metro rail systems. \n \n7. \nThe development of urban rail systems, previously under the ambit of the Indian Railways \nAct  1989,  has  seen  city  administrations  taking  increasing  responsibility  for  urban  transport \ndevelopment  under  the  Indian  Tramways  Act  of  1909  and  other  subsequent  acts.  The  Delhi \nMetro  Railway  (Operation  and  Maintenance)  Act  2002  was  specifically  enacted  to  address  the \nneeds of a metro system in Delhi, and a subsequent amendment to this act in 2009 extended its \nto  other  metropolitan  cities  such  as  Bangalore,  Mumbai,  and  Chennai.  The \nreach \nimplementation, operation, maintenance, and safety aspects of metro systems are covered under \n2\nthis act.PF\nFP  \n \n\nPerformance Gaps \n\n2. \n \n8. \nThe lack of a public transport system that efficiently and economically services all parts of \nthe city seriously impacts the poor. While those using personal vehicles (such as cars and two-\nwheelers) are also affected, the proportionate impact on urban poor people is possibly far higher \ndue to their not having access to personal vehicles. While public buses are generally available, \ntravel by buses through congested urban areas takes more time and is also not comfortable over \nlonger distances, given the fact that most of the buses are not air-conditioned. \n \n9. \nRoad  vehicles  are  a  significant  source  of  air  pollution  and  their  proliferation  leads  to  a \ndegraded urban environment and attendant diseases. A white paper on pollution in Delhi, prior to \nthe  changeover  to  compressed  natural  gas  for  buses,  showed  that  pollution  by  road  vehicles \naccounted  for  more  than  60%  of  total  air  pollution.T\nT  The  proliferation  of  personal  modes  of \ntransport (such as cars and two-wheelers) is therefore an immediate concern, since most cities in \nIndia have a modal share of public transport of only about 50%.  \n\n3\n\nFP\n\nPF\n\n                                                 \n2\nT  The act deals with the implementation, operation, tariff fixing, and safety regulations for metro systems.  \nT  Government of India, Ministry of Environment and Forests.

While a metro system cannot by itself address all of these severe problems, it will provide \na  high-capacity  transport  corridor  along  specific  arteries  of  the  city,  which  will  draw  a  large \nproportion  of  users  from  the  roads.  A  well-planned  intermodal  transit  system  combining  buses \nand rail-based systems will also need to be built across the city; generally the rail-based systems \ncater to the higher traffic density corridors, while the buses act in the proximate areas as feeders \nto the rail system. Without such a system, the effectiveness of the metro would be much lower. In \nthe case of Bangalore, at the planning stage, the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation \nwas closely involved with the BMRC for planning the bus schedules and routes, taking the metro \nas  the  high-density  traffic  corridor.  Key  stations  such  as  Majestic  and  Byappanahalli  are  being \ndeveloped  as  intermodal  centers  where  the  public  transport  for  rail  and  road  are  closely \nintegrated. \n \n11. \nOne  reason  why  many  cities  in  developing  countries  have  not  built  metro  systems  has \nbeen the high initial cost. Since most funding has to come from governments and resources are \nconstrained, the focus has traditionally been on small-scale urban transport improvements such \nas  widening  roads,  constructing  grade  separators,  or  adding  buses  to  the  fleet.  Such \nimprovements  have  not  been  able  to  address  or  catch  up  with  the  escalating  scale  of  the \nproblems.  While  most  large  cities  and  governments  have  realized  the  importance  of  having  a \nmetro  system  as  a  key element  of any  urban  transport  system,  the  funding  constraints  remain. \nThere is, therefore, a clear opportunity and growing desire for commercial finance to step in and \nbridge some of the gap. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancing Constraints for Metro Rail Systems \n\nloans.  However, \n\nthrough  sovereign-guaranteed \n\n \nThe few metro systems developed in India have been funded by the government, either \n12. \ndirectly  or \ninvestment  requirements  are \naccelerating beyond government financing capacity and the Ministry of Urban Development has \nestimated  a  Rs2,070  billion  ($45  billion  equivalent)  need  for  urban  transport  infrastructure \ninvestment  in  cities  with  populations  of  100,000  or  more  in  the  period  2008\u22122028.  With  these \nrising  needs,  governments  are  no  longer  in  a  position  to  finance  all  such  projects.  The  need \ntherefore for other solutions such as commercial debt, private funds, and PPPs is critical to build \nand  operate  metro  systems.  However,  given  the  very  substantial  up  front  capital  investment \nrequirements for metro projects and the social and economic limitations on fares and passenger \ntrips,  especially  in  the  initial  years  of  operations,  short-term  financial  viability  of  metro  systems \nworldwide  is  rarely  achievable.  Leveraging  of  government  grants,  revenue  support  schemes, \nland  development  rights  on  additional  land  given  to  the  project,  and/or  other  revenues  from \ncommercial development of land in the station areas are seen as essential to ensure viability and \nbankability. \n \n13.  While a number of cities have developed plans for metro projects, the significant funding \nconstraints  have  yet  to  be  addressed.  The  gradual  shift  from  government  direct  funding  to \nsovereign-guaranteed loans and then commercial finance is illustrated by the cases of Kolkata, \nDelhi, and other cities such as Bangalore and Mumbai. The Kolkata metro was taken up by the \nMinistry  of  Railways  as  a  national  government  project,  while  in  Delhi,  the  national  and  state \ngovernments set up a joint venture and the national government provided sovereign-guaranteed \ndebt. The most recent projects are seeking commercial finance through debt (Bangalore) or debt \nand  equity  (Mumbai  and  Hyderabad),  with  viability  support  coming  from  the  national  and  state \ngovernments. In the case of Bangalore, the national government has agreed to participate in a \njoint venture with the state government (owned equally), and also to support the project by way \nof equity, subordinated debt, and the onlending of the JICA ODA loan.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n4  \n \n\nC. \n \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 \n\nPF\n\nFP\n\n4\n\nAs stated in Strategy 2020,T\n\n \n14. \nT ADB investment in infrastructure is fundamental to achieving \npoverty  reduction  and  inclusive  growth  and  also  contributes  to  environmentally  sustainable \ngrowth and regional integration. ADB\u2019s infrastructure operations are not to be limited to building \nphysical assets, but will also include improving the delivery of infrastructure services through, for \nexample, building the capacity of developing member countries (DMCs) for better infrastructure \nmanagement,  and  promoting  institutional  and  policy  reforms  that  enhance  the  operational \nefficiency and sustainability of infrastructure projects. Under Strategy 2020, ADB\u2019s infrastructure \noperations  will  promote  private  sector  engagement  in  financing  infrastructure  to  augment  the \nsupply of capital for infrastructure. Development of urban transport is one of the focus areas of \nurban infrastructure under Strategy 2020. The strategy also envisages ADB helping DMCs move \ntheir  economies  onto  low-carbon  growth  paths  by  modernizing  public  transport  systems.  ADB \ncan  assist  DMCs  and  their  municipalities  address  a  range  of  environmental  problems  resulting \nfrom rapid urbanization. This includes supporting cleaner modes of transport. \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with the Country Partnership Strategy \n\nPF\n\nFP\n\n5\n\n \nThe  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  2009\u22122012  is  in  line  with  the  national \n15. \ngovernment's  aims  for  infrastructure  development,  requiring  over  $500  billion  over  a  5-year \nperiod  (2007\u20132012).T\nT  The  project  strongly  supports  the  CPS,  which  emphasizes  infrastructure \ndevelopment  (e.g.,  transport,  energy,  urban,  agriculture,  and  water  resources  management); \ncatalyzes  investment;  and  facilitates  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  development, \nincluding  support  for  inclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  growth.  The  project  enables \nbetter  leveraging  of  scarce  sovereign  resources,  and  spurs  private  sector  and  commercial \nfunding for infrastructure projects. \n \n16. \nCrosscutting themes\u2014such as private sector development, gender and development, and \nenvironmental sustainability\u2014have been mainstreamed within the sector road maps in the CPS. \nGiven  the  challenges  facing  India  and  the  world  due  to  climate  change  and  degradation  of  the \nenvironment,  the  environmental  focus  of  the  CPS  includes  a  program  to  lower  pollution  and \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  by  strengthening  rail  and  urban  transport  infrastructure.  The  project \nis,  therefore,  consistent  with  meeting  the  objectives  of  infrastructure  development  in  an \nenvironmentally sustainable manner through nonsovereign participation. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n \n\nProject Description \n\n1. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsors \n\n \n17. \nThe  proposal  for  a  metro  system  in  Bangalore  was  cleared  by  the  state  government  in \nMarch  2005  and  the  national  government  in  April  2006.  The  national  and  state  governments \nproposed  that  the  project  should  be  implemented  through  a  special-purpose  company.  BMRC, \nan  entity  incorporated  in  India  under  the  Companies  Act  1956,  will  be  the  borrower  for  the \nproject. BMRC is a public sector entity wholly and jointly owned (50:50) by the national and state \n                                                 \n4\nT  ADB.  2008.

BMRC\u2019s  board  is  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  urban  development  of  the  national \ngovernment,  and  the  managing  director  is  a  senior  civil  servant  from  the  Indian  Administrative \nService.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n \n18. \nThe  DMRC  has  been  actively  involved  in  assisting  BMRC  in  planning,  design,  and \nprocurement.  The  planning,  design,  and  supervision  of  the  works  are  the  responsibility  of  a \ntechnical  consultant  engaged  by  BMRC  (general  consultant).  The  general  consultant  is  a \nconsortium  of  RITES  (India),  Oriental  Consulting  Company  (Japan),  TParsons  Brinckerhoff \nInternationalT (United States), and SYSTRA (France), procured under the JICA guidelines through \na transparent process.  \n \n19. \nThe metro rail transit system has been designed to meet a capacity of 40,000 peak-hour \npeak  direction  traffic.  The  operations  plan  envisages  a  3.0-minute  gapT  Tbetween  trains  with  31 \ntrains on the north\u2013south line, and a 3.3 minute gap with 25 trains on the east\u2013west line. End-to-\nend travel time is 33 minutes on the north\u2013south line and 44 minutes on the east\u2013west line. The \nscheduled speed is 32 km per hour, with a maximum of 80 km per hour. \n \n20. \nProcurement  in  relation  to  all  the  construction  contracts  has  been  conducted  through \nopen  tenders  on  a  transparent  basis.  BMRC\u2019s  procurement  processes  are  dictated  by  the \nKarnataka Transparency in Public Procurement Act (1999). Karnataka is one of the few states in \nIndia  to  have  specific  legislation  for  transparent  procurement  processes  and  penalties  for \nviolation thereof. In addition, the JICA ODA loan also has procurement covenants and therefore \nall  procurement,  including  that  of  the  general  consultants,  has  been  carried  out  transparently \nthrough  open  tenders.  BMRC\u2019s  audit  is  carried  out  by  the  comptroller  and  auditor  general  of \nIndia, and is a rigorous third-party examination. \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Outputs and Outcome \n\n \n21. \nThe project will develop the physical infrastructure for a metro rail system for Bangalore \nand will operate the system as per the design parameters. The major components of the project \nare as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nAn east\u2013west corridor of 18.1 km, including a 4.8 km underground portion. \nA  north\u2013south  corridor  of  24.2  km,  including  a  4.0  km  underground  portion  and \ninterconnection between corridors at Majestic. \nOne at-grade station, 32 elevated stations, and 7 underground stations. \nElectrical works consisting of 750 volts direct current third rail traction and power \nsupply. \nA  signaling  and  telecommunications  system  consisting  of  continuous  automatic \ntrain  control  with  cab  signaling,  a  centralized  train  control  system  comprising \nautomatic train protection, and automatic train supervision. \nAn automatic fare collection system with 6\u22129 ticketing gates per station. \nInitially 168 rolling stock units (cars) for initial operations, comprising 56 trains of 3 \ncoaches each. Subsequently, in line with projected demand, this will be increased \nto 56 trains of 6 coaches each with a total of 336 cars.  \n\n(viii)  Depots at Byappanahalli and Peenya. \n\n \n22. \nThe  project  outcome  will  be  an  efficient,  well-used,  environmentally  friendly,  and \nfinancially stable urban transport system for Bangalore. Better connectivity and efficiency in the \n\n \n\n\f6  \n \n\n \n\ntransport  systems  will  make  the  city  more  attractive  for  business  investments  and  contribute  to \neconomic  growth.  The  project  will  increase  the  share  of  public  transport  in  total  intracity \npassenger movements and improve the environmental quality of the city. It is estimated that by \n2021 usage will be around 2 million passenger trips per day, and the underlying modal shift from \nprivate to public modes is expected to be 10%\u221215% for BMRC alone (not factoring in any new \nline developments). \n \nB. \n \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n1. \n\nContribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n\n6\n\n \n23. \nIndia's economic growth over 2001\u22122008 has spurred rapid urbanization, with 28% of the \ntotal  population  living  in  urban  agglomerations;  this  is  expected  to  reach  40%  of  the  total \npopulation,  or  around  590  million  people,  living  in  urban  areas  by  2030.PF\nFP  Forty  metropolitan \n7\ncitiesPF\nFP  with  a  population  of  more  than  1  million  account  for  35%  of  the  urban  population.  It  is \nexpected  that  by  2030,  60  metropolitan  cities  will  have  populations  exceeding  1  million.  Urban \nIndia contributes 58% of gross domestic product, and this is expected to reach 70% by 2030 and \ngenerate  70%  of  new  employment.  The  number  of  urban  households  is  expected  to  increase \nfrom 22 million in 2010 to 91 million in 2030, with a fourfold increase in average national income. \nGrowth  of  the  urban  areas  is  therefore  vital  for  India's  economic  growth  and  for  an  equitable \ndistribution of growth, but it brings enormous challenges, not least to effective transportation. \n \n24. \nTo  contribute  to  growth,  urban  areas  require  adequate  and  suitable  infrastructure,  of \nwhich public transportation is an essential component. Public transportation networks (i) enable \naccess to more productive urban space usage and improved densification patterns; (ii) mitigate \nenvironmental pollution in areas where vehicular emissions are significant; (iii) save fuel; and (iv) \nprovide  connectivity  solutions  for  all,  especially  the  poor  and  middle-income  groups.  Efficient \ntransport systems save travel time, making city workforces more productive, improving the image \nof  a  city,  and  making  a  city  a  more  attractive  place  for  investment  and  business.  Evidence \nindicates  a  direct  cost  of  congestion  of  around  2%  of  gross  domestic  product  per  year,P\nPwhich \npublic transportation systems can help alleviate. The project\u2019s direct development impact is that it \ncreates  a  mass  transit  system  that  supports  economic  growth,  employment  generation,  and \nequitable  connectivity.  It  also  mitigates  environmental  pollution  by  providing  an  alternative  to \nprivate  vehicles.  The  project  will  demonstrate  the  functioning  of  a  sustainable  urban  transport \ncompany  with  adequate  institutional  and  governance  structures  and  an  innovative  urban \ntransport financing model. It will provide a successful modality for public transport which can be \nreplicated in other cities. \n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nWidening Access to Markets and Economic Opportunities \n\n \nThe focus of the project is to create a commercially viable and bankable project vehicle \n25. \nthat can successfully attract commercial debt. The project structure, leveraging sovereign equity \nand loans with commercial lending, creates a self-sustaining model for financing urban transport \nprojects. The successful implementation of the project should lead to its replication and catalyze \ncommercial debt and private sector participation in the sector in other places.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n6\nT  McKinsey  Global  Institute.  2010.

Many of these benefits are difficult to quantify, but BMRC has proposed the \ncreation  of  an  environmental  and  social  management  division  that  will  ensure  not  only  project \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguards  but  also  the  development  of \nemissions monitoring for the city over the long term. \n \nC. \n \n\nEnvironment and Social Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n \n27. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  contribute  to  significant  environmental  improvements  for \nBangalore  city.  A  decrease  in  noise  and  air  pollution  along  with  reduced  average  fuel \nconsumption is expected because of reductions in projected traffic growth volumes on the transit \ncorridors (in a without-project scenario).  \n \n28. \nTemporary  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  expected  largely  during  the  construction \nphase  of  the  project  involving  elements  such  as  the  elevated  and  underground  sections  of  the \nmetro rail alignment, stations, maintenance depots, and casting yards. The project management \nhas ensured that adequate mitigation measures have been taken to reduce these impacts. \n \nAccording  to  initial  environmental  impact  assessments,  BMRC  has  already  incorporated \n29. \nseveral  measures  to  mitigate  any  environmental  impacts,  including  noise  reduction  measures \nthrough  installing  soundproof  walls  and  soundproofing  pads,  and  air  quality  monitoring \nequipment  placed  all  along  the  alignments.  The  Indian  Institute  of  Science  in  Bangalore  was \nappointed to monitor the groundwater level and quality during construction.  \n \n30. \nThe  project  has  been  classified  as  category  B  for  environment  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  an  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) was carried out. \n \n31. \nare as follows: \n \n\nSome of the significant impacts and mitigation measures related to the project alignment \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nProximity (about 40 meters) of one of the underground sections to the Tipu Sultan \nPalace,  which  is  a  heritage  structure  as  per  the  Archaeological  Survey  of  India \n(ASI),  has  been  addressed  on  the  basis  of  mitigation  measures  to  minimize \nvibration impacts as recommended by the National Physical Laboratories and the \nASI  clearance  conditions.  The  ASI  has  already  accorded  a  formal  clearance  to \nBMRC  to  go  ahead  with  the  construction  based  on  the  National  Physical \nLaboratories study findings. \nTree  cutting  along  the  alignment  has  been  addressed  through  better  route \nplanning to avoid or bypass areas with thick vegetation and the implementation of \ncompensatory  forestation  programs  (on  a  1:10  basis)  in  pre-identified  public \nareas.  The  plantation  program  was  verified  and  found  satisfactory  in  terms  of \nnative species, density, and survival rates. \nDebris, spoil generation and disposal from tunneling of underground sections will \nbe mitigated by sound disposal in low-lying areas in the south of the city approved \n\n \n\n\f8  \n \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\nby  the  Bruhat  Bengaluru  Mahanagara  Palike  (civic  administration).  Other \nmitigation measures on transportation of soil have been factored into the IEE. \nBMRC has mainstreamed environmental mitigation into its contractual agreements \nsuch  that  all  contractors  involved  in  construction  of  the  metro  will  be  obliged  to \nthe  environmental  management  plan  and  ambient  monitoring \nimplement \nprograms,  conduct  environmental,  health  and  safety  audits,  and  provide  periodic \nreports to BMRC. Noncompliance and defaults will be followed up with necessary \naction.  BMRC  has  its  own  environmental  and  social  institutional  capacity  to \ncoordinate and supervise the implementation of environmental management plan \nmeasures. \n\n \n32. \nPublic consultation has been carried out by BMRC and suggestions and comments from \nthe community have been incorporated in the project design and execution. The IEE prepared for \nthe project captures all the above and will be disclosed on the ADB website in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n \n33. \nLand  acquisition  for  the  project  was  initiated  in  2006  and  has  been  completed  in \naccordance  with  the  Karnataka  Industrial  Area  Development  Board  Act.  The  total  length  of  the \nproject corridor (metro line) is about 42.3 km connecting the north\u2013south and east\u2013west ends of \nBangalore city. The total land requirement for the project was 124 hectares (ha). Of this, 30 ha of \nland  was  private  land  and  the  remaining  94  ha  of  land  was  government  land.  There  were  875 \nland  parcels  affected,  of  which  811  were  private  and  the  remaining  64  were  government  land. \nThe  total  number  of  affected  households  is  1,838.  A  detailed  break  up  of  land  requirement  for \neach corridor is available. \n \n34. \nBMRC  adopted  a  transparent  approach  for  the  acquisition  of  land  and  properties,  cash \nassistance  for  rehabilitation,  and  appropriate  compensation  packages.  The  rehabilitation \npackages were developed and have been implemented and cash compensation has been paid \nto  the  affected  households  by  BMRC.  The  cash  assistance  included  a  shifting  allowance, \ninconvenience  allowance,  right  to  salvage  material,  transitional  allowance,  rental  income  loss \nallowance,  business  premises  reestablishment  allowance  and  a  business  loss  allowance.  In \naddition, BMRC is meeting the cost of restoring the affected portions of public property, including \na school, hospital, park and religious structure. Rehabilitation packages, designed for the benefit \nof  persons  who  suffered  loss  of  land,  properties  and  income  and  livelihoods,  have  been  paid \nsimultaneously with the compensation.  Additionally, affected slums were rehabilitated through a \nnew housing scheme developed in the Peenya area where the slum dwellers have been allotted \nhousing.  BMRC  has  allotted  and  registered  new  houses  for  the  slum  dwellers  in  the  name  of \nwomen of the household which is in compliance with international best practices.  \n \n35. \nA social due diligence audit has been carried out to assess whether land acquisition and \nresettlement  processes  and  their  implementation  complied  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement and government guidelines. The social due diligence audit included consultations with \naffected  local  people  to  assess  views  on  property  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  compensation \npackages  and  processes.  These  have  been  found  to  be  largely  favorable  towards  the  BMRC \nprocesses,  which  have  also  been  positively  highlighted  in  the  local  media.  The  compensation \nwas  paid  at  replacement  value.  BMRC  has  developed  a  rehabilitation  package  dealing  with \nassistance  to  affected  local  people  with  eligibility  and  entitlements  for  various  losses  being,  in \nprinciple,  at  par  with  the  ADB\u2019s  requirement  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  This  is \nconsistent with international best practices.  \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nDue diligence also identified eight pending cases of litigation related to compensation and \n36. \nresettlement. However, BMRC has already taken all necessary advance action steps, including \ndepositing  compensation  amounts  with  the  court  which  will  determine  the  grievance  claims. \nSimilar  cases  have  in  the  past  been  resolved  quickly  and  amicably  and  generally  in  BMRC\u2019s \nfavor, since BMRC has remained committed to providing strong compensation and rehabilitation \npackages.  \n \n37. \nThe  project,  initially  categorized  A  for  involuntary  resettlement  based  on  preliminary \npublicly  available  information,  has  been  recategorized  as  category  C  following  ADB\u2019s  detailed \nsafeguards  assessment  and  detailed  due  diligence.  This  established  that  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  and  rehabilitation  processes  have  been  completed  (in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement)  and  affected  persons  have  all  received  compensation  (excluding \nthe eight cases noted in para. 36). \n \n38. \nThe  social  due  diligence  report  assessed  the  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples;  there  are \nno  indigenous  peoples  affected  by  the  project.  The  project  is  categorized  C  for  indigenous \npeoples.  \n\nD. \n \n\n \nImplementation Arrangements  \n\n1. \n\nManagement \n\n \n39. \nThe project is being implemented by BMRC, the special-purpose company established by \nthe national and state governments for the project in 1994. BMRC will also carry out the project \noperations  and  management  once  the  metro  is  functioning.  BMRC's  board  comprises  13 \ndirectors,  which  includes  five  from  the  national  government  (urban  development,  railways,  and \nthe  DMRC).  The  chair  of  BMRC  is  the  secretary  of  urban  development  of  the  national \ngovernment. There are five board members from the state government, including the managing \ndirector and principal secretary finance, and three functional directors who are experts in railway \ndevelopment  and  operations  or  transport  engineering.  The  company  has  been  operating  as  an \nindependent  entity  for  several  years  and  will  agree  in  the  ADB  loan  agreement  to  comply  with \nsound corporate governance requirements.  \n \n\n2. \n\nConstruction Arrangements \n\n \n40. \nBMRC has made good progress and the project is in an advanced stage of construction \nas reflected by the following milestones: (i) land acquisition is completed; (ii) \u201creach\u201d 1T\nT is nearing \ncompletion  and  proposed  for  opening  by  early  2011;  (iii)  80%  of  the  contracts  have  been \nawarded,  and  the  balance  are  under  bid;  (vi)  train  manufacture  has  commenced,  with  the  first \ntrain having rolled out in the Republic of Korea in September 2010.T\n \n\nT \n\n9\n\n8\n\nFP\n\nPF\n\nPF\n\nFP\n\n3. \n\nOperations Arrangements \n\n \n41. \nBMRC  will  be  the  project  operator  responsible for  recruiting  operation  and  maintenance \nstaff. The operations manual, safety manual and requirements, procedures, and staff training will \nbe provided by the general consultants. This is in line with the practice followed by the DMRC for \n\n                                                 \n8\nT  The  project  is  divided  into  four  \u201creaches\u201d  and  underground  portions.  Reach  1  of  6.5  km  with  six  stations  extends \n\nfrom Cricket Stadium to Byappanahalli station. \n\nT  The procurement followed a global tender, in which four international consortia  were short listed prior to obtaining \ncompetitive price quotations. The tender also had a technology transfer element to an Indian domestic company. \n\n9\n\n \n\nT\nP\nP\nT\nP\nP\n\f10  \n \n\n \n\nDelhi.  Indian  Railways  has  a  large  pool  of  trained  traffic  controllers  and  these  may  also  be \nseconded to BMRC for train operations. BMRC has proposed that noncritical functions should be \noutsourced through suitable contracts.  \n \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n \n42. \nBMRC was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and policy \nrelating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire BMRC to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging  in  such  activities.  The  loan  documentation  between  ADB  and  the  BMRC  will  further \nallow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n\n5. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring, Reporting, and Evaluation \n\n \n43. \nBMRC  will  report  to  ADB  on  the  progress  of  the  project  procurement,  construction,  and \ninitial  operation,  as  well  as  the  financial  statements,  business  plan,  and  indebtedness  plan. \nConstruction  and  procurement  progress  and  initial  operations  will  be  reviewed  by  the  lenders\u2019 \ntechnical  consultant  and  assessed  against  the  project\u2019s  schedule,  specifications,  and  budget. \nDisbursements of ADB\u2019s loan will be conditional upon receipt by ADB of reports from the lenders\u2019 \ntechnical  consultant  satisfactory  to  ADB.  BMRC  will  provide,  among  other  things,  semiannual \nunaudited  financial  statements,  audited  financial  statements,  and  annual  business  plans  which \ninclude  projected  financial  statements,  a  capital  expenditure  plan,  and  confirmation  of \ncompliance  with  financial  covenants  for  the  next  financial  year.  BMRC  will  submit  the  annual \nindebtedness  plan  for  ADB\u2019s  approval,  and  BMRC  is  obliged  to  comply  with  the  annual \nindebtedness  plan  for  the  next  financial  year.  BMRC  also  will  provide  an  annual  review  of \ncompliance  with  environmental  and  social  safeguards  pursuant  to  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\n \nA. \n  \n\nThe Assistance \n\n1. \n\nInstrument and Amount \n\n \n44. \nThe  proposed  ADB  loan  is  of  up  to  $250  million  to  BMRC,  a  special-purpose  company \nestablished to develop, operate, and maintain the project. The loan will be provided from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources without government guarantee.  \n \nB. \n \n45. \n \n\nADB\u2019s support for the project is justified based on the following: \n\nJustification for ADB Assistance  \n\n(i) \n\nUrban  infrastructure  development  is  often  financed  mainly  by  grants  from  the \ngovernment, contributions from municipal government finances, or by multilateral \nfinance  institutions  backed  by  sovereign  government  guarantees.  The  capital \ninvestment  for  financing  urban  infrastructure  in  India  is  estimated  at  $1.2  trillion \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n10\n\nfrom  2011  to  2030  and  $2.2  trillionPF\nFP  if  operating  expenditures  are  included.  To \nmeet  such  volumes  of  investment,  a  paradigm  shift  is  required  in  sourcing \nfinancing, including exploring new sources, the efficient application of these funds, \nand efficient management of assets created so as to minimize operating costs (or \noverall  life  cycle  costs)  to  ensure  sustainability.  To  effect  this  shift  in  financing, \ninstitutional  accountability,  good  corporate  governance,  planned  urban \ndevelopment,  and  effective  leveraging  of  government  grants  are  a  prerequisite. \nADB\u2019s  participation,  and  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements,  will  help  promote \nstrong  governance,  robust  institutional  accountability,  and  overall  efficiency  in \noperations.   \nFew financial institutions have the ability to structure appropriate financial models \nand  the  appetite  to  lend  long-term  funds  to  capital-intensive  public  service \nprojects.  The  creation  of  a  dedicated  institutional  vehicle  for  managing  life  cycle \ncosts  of  public  infrastructure  with  due  accountability,  good  governance,  and \nleveraging  government  grant  funds  or  viability  gap  funding  support  will  help  to \ncatalyze additional finance for the project. ADB\u2019s participation, capital structuring, \nand due diligence will help mobilize long-term debt funding and catalyze domestic \nfinancial  institutions  such  as  banks  and  insurance  funds  to  consider  long-term \nloans for this project. Similar structuring for other projects with viability gap funding \ncan effectively replicate this model. \nCompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguards  will  ensure  proper \nresolution of social issues and mitigation of adverse environmental impacts, if any. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nAssurances  \n\nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),T\n\n \nC. \n \n46. \nT \nthe  Government  of  India  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed \nassistance to BMRC.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nP  and \nConsistent  with  the  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  India's  3-year  assistance  program  (2009\u20132012)P\nspecifically with the CPS emphasis on environmental improvement and Climate Change Implementation Plan (2009\u2013\n2011)  and  recommended  financing  of  \"MRT  [mass  rapid  transit]  projects  in  medium  sized  Indian  cities,\"  the  project \nhas a positive impact on economic growth for poverty reduction. The project aims at (i) environmental improvement \nthrough  clean  transport,  (ii)  effective  urban  transportation  for  economic  growth,  and  (iii)  the  development  of  a \nbankable project structure as a model for catalyzing private sector funding, all of which are regarded as central goals \nb\nof  Strategy  2020  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).P\nP  The  project  supports  ADB's  private  sector  development \nstrategy  by  establishing  a  bankable  financial  model  for  a  large  infrastructure  project  without  sovereign  guarantee, \nwhich  will  catalyze  private  sector  participation  and  attract  financing  from  commercial  financiers  into  other  such \nprojects in India. The project strongly supports the CPS for India by supporting the transport sector (a priority area), \nas  well  as  other  thematic  priority  areas  noted  in  the  CPS  such  as  environmental  sustainability,  private  sector \ndevelopment,  and  private  sector  operations.  Consistent  with  ADB's  urban  sector,  financial  sustainability,  and  social \nsafeguards  focus,  the  project  supports  self-sustainability  of  urban  sector  projects,  which  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  urban \ntransport strategy for local governments to self-finance and sustain urban development projects without dependence \non central government finances. ADB support provides crucial credibility for the project, which has several pioneering \naspects:  (i)  new  public  transport  modality,  (ii)  institutional  development,  and  (iii)  project  financing  structures.  The \nproject  supports  implementation  of  metro  rail-based  public  transport  systems.  These  are  crucial  for  providing  cost-\neffective  connectivity,  especially  in  middle-sized  Indian  cities  currently  suffering  from  public  transport  gaps  and \nexponential  private vehicular  growth  leading to growth  in  pollution, accidents, and travel delays. Overall, successful \nproject  implementation  will  catalyze  similar  projects  in  other  local  municipal  governments,  leading  to  better  public \ntransport  development  in  Indian  cities  and,  crucially,  spurring  commercial  finance  into  the  sector,  thus  effecting  a \nbetter use of limited government funds. \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General intervention \n \n1.    Key  issues.  The  prime  impact  of  the  project  is  on  developing  effective  mass  connectivity  solutions  for  urban \ncenters  and  thus  aiding  overall  economic  growth.  By  providing  a  sustainable  public  urban  transport  modality  in \nBangalore city, the Metro Rail Transit System Project has an indirect impact on poverty reduction through both cost \nand time savings which can be factored in at various levels, including (i) reduced average travel costs per km versus \nprivate  vehicular  transport,  (ii)  reduced  time  delays  in  travel  due  to  a  dedicated  travel  corridor,  and  (iii)  improved \nhealth  costs  over  a  longer  period  due  to  anticipated  lower  vehicular  emissions  in  the  city.  In  addition,  through  the \ndevelopment of a citywide transport grid, the project covers a large catchment area of the city providing accessibility \nto both low- and middle-income workers to attractive labor markets in the developing industrial and commercial parts \nof  the  city.  The  project's  key  outcomes  will  be  the  implementation  of  a  metro  rail  system  in  the  city  and  the  limited \nrecourse  finance  model.  Benefits  include  (i)  the  provision  of  sustainable  public  transport  for  the  city's  8.5  million \npopulation by 2012, providing an alternative to private vehicles; (ii) traffic decongestion and faster travel times versus \nthe status quo of growing private vehicle traffic, aiding in improving traffic accident rates, time saving for commuters, \nincreased  productivity  and  hence  economic  growth;  (iii)  environmental  improvement  by  providing  a  more  energy \nefficient mass urban transport system (energy requirements estimated to be a fraction of the comparable road-based \nsystems) as well as through reducing fuel consumption and pollution impacts from private vehicles, considered to be \na key factor in urban pollution growth in recent years; (iv) the demonstration of sustainable financial and operations \nmanagement through a dedicated urban transport company; (v) demonstration of \u201cbankability\u201d structuring through the \nlimited recourse financing model and credit enhancement mechanisms able to catalyze further commercial financing; \nand  (vi)  demonstration  of  the  use  of  property  realizations  to  provide  an  innovative  revenue  source  for  financing \ninfrastructure, linked to land use planning and efficient spatial development. The project benefits the urban poor and \nmiddle class by providing a cheaper, safer, and more efficient public transport system. \n  \n\n\fAppendix 2           15 \n\n \n\n2.  Design  features.  No  direct  impact  on  poverty  is  envisaged  as  a  result  of  the  implementation  of  this  project. \nNonetheless, the project will have indirect impacts on Bangalore, Karnataka, and India as a whole. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\n2 \n\n2 \n\nPin 1991, and 531 kmP\n\nA. Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nA  social impact assessment was conducted as part of the preparation of environmental impact assessment reports. \nBangalore city has a population of 5.70 million according to the census statistics for 2001, as against the city\u2019s earlier \npopulation of 2.92 million in 1981 and 4.13 million in 1991. This shows that the population has nearly doubled in the \nlast 20 years, and the growth rate is currently around 3.8% annually. The geographical boundaries of the city are also \n2\nP)  in \nexpanding  rapidly,  as  evident  from  the  census  data,  which  showed  the  city  area  as  386  square  kilometers  (kmP\nPin 2001. With increasing population and reduced available land area, the city\u2019s \n1981, 446 kmP\n2\n2\npopulation density was 7,983 persons per kmP\nP \nP in 1991, and 10,710 persons per kmP\nP in 1981, 9,260 persons per kmP\nin 2001. It is further projected that the population size of the Bangalore urban agglomeration will be around 7.8 million \nin 2011 and 11.0 million in 2021. A city of this size with a rapidly rising population of the above magnitude demands a \nwhole  range  of  civic  services,  including  the  vital  transportation  sector.  The  per  capita  income  at  current  prices  in \nurban  areas  only  is  Rs28,305;  83.91%  of  the  people  are  literate.  There  are  77  hospitals,  31  dispensaries,  2,772 \nprimary  schools,  1,177  high  schools,  209  pre-university  schools,  24  engineering  colleges,  and  4  universities.  One-\nquarter of the people sampled in the east\u2013west corridor and 41% in the north\u2013south corridor are from lower economic \nbackgrounds.  The  higher-income  group  is  the  smallest  group,  and  the  middle-  and  lower-income  groups  are  the \nbiggest; 75% of the people sampled in both the east\u2013west and north\u2013south corridors are business people. In terms of \neducational  background,  6.25%  of  the  people  sampled  in  the  east\u2013west  corridor  are  illiterate;  in  the  north\u2013south \ncorridor there were no illiterate people in the sample; 29% of the people sampled in the east\u2013west corridor and almost \n45% in the north\u2013south corridor are graduates. \n\n2\n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\nConsultations  were carried out  with all the  stakeholders during the  preparation of the  project. As an  integral part of \nland  acquisition,  affected  communities  and  affected  people  were  directly  and  fully  involved  in  the  project.  All \nstakeholders  were  informed  and  the  stream  of  information  will  continue  during  the  implementation  of  the  project. \nConsultations  were  held  to  ensure  participation  and  minimization  of  the  negative  impacts.  Different  techniques  of \nconsultation  with  stakeholders  were  used  during  project  preparation\u2014public  opinion,  public  meetings,  group \ndiscussions,  and  interactive  sessions,  etc.  Given  the  chaotic  urban  road  traffic,  public  opinion  makers  were  asked \nwhether a metro rail system would be a viable alternative to the existing modes of transport;  91% of the sample felt \nthat  it  could  be  a  viable,  quick,  comfortable  and  safe  means  of  transport,  and  thus  should  be  welcomed.  To \nunderstand  the  socioeconomic  profile  of  the  affected  persons,  questionnaires  were  designed  and  information  was \ncollected  from  the  788  households.  An  interactive  meeting  was  held  with  members  of  the  public,  media,  and \nconcerned  environmental  groups  at  Bangalore  University  Senate  Hall,  when  the  salient  features  of  the  metro  rail \nproject  for  Bangalore  along  with  its  projected  benefits  to  the  community  and  environmental  and  socioeconomic \nimpacts  were  explained  by  the  project  proponents.  This  was  followed  by  intense  discussions  and  a  question  and \nanswer  session.  On  the  basis  of  deliberations,  a  consensus  emerged  from  the  meeting  that  the  metro  rail  project \nimplementation would result in a better mode of transport with a wide range of benefits to the community. Additionally, \nconsultations were held during the due diligence study after the land acquisition period, and these showed people\u2019s \nsupport  for  the  project  and  the  smooth  process  of  land  acquisition.  Consultation  will  be  continued  during  project \nimplementation.  \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why.  \n \nC&P was considered as a part of the more extensive resettlement planning exercise. Local communities and affected \npeople  were  consulted  throughout  the  preparation  process  to  minimize  impacts,  ensure  social  acceptance,  and \nincrease  equitability.  The  process  will  continue  during  the  implementation  of  the  project.  Views  and  concerns  of  all \nstakeholders  will  be  taken  into  consideration  and  addressed  whenever  feasible.  Finally,  local  customs,  religious \npractices, and traditional activities have been considered as a fully integrated part of the preparation process to avoid \ndiscrimination  and/or  disruption  of  activities.  The  executing  and  implementing  agency  (Bangalore  Metro  Rail \nCorporation  [BMRC])  will  ensure  that  essential  participation  process  will  be  continued  throughout  the  project \nimplementation. \n \n\n \n\n\f16          Appendix 2           \n\n \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key issues. No particular issue is expected to arise from the implementation of the project. The project will have \na positive impact on women. Gender impacts of transport projects are generally favorable. It is evident that availability \nof a better metro rail system and safe connectivity with better transport services will benefit the women of the area. \nTheir  mobility  will  be  improved  in  terms  of  access  to  social  services,  higher  levels  of  schooling,  and  better  health \nfacilities, etc. Additionally, during the project implementation, efforts will be made by the project authority for women to \nreceive preferential treatment for employment in the civil works, with proper health safeguards. The executing agency \nwill  ensure that affected  women are consulted and invited to participate in group-based activities to enable them to \ngain access to and control over resources. \n2.
