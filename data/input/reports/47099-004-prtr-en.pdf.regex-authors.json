RECOMMENDATION  8 ", "", " \nI.  BACKGROUND \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board of Directors approved a policy-based loan and \na policy-based grant to Tajikistan for subprogram 2 of the Investment Climate Reforms Program \non 22 December 2016.1 Subprogram 1 was approved on 4 December 2015.2 \n \n \n2.  Subprogram  2  provides  budget  support  to  facilitate  the  expansion  of  economic \nopportunities and the development of the private sector. The impact of subprogram 2 is aligned \nwith increased private investment, economic diversification, and competitiveness. The outcome \nwill be increased capabilities and opportunities of businesses to set up and expand higher value-\nadded production. Subprogram 2 includes 13 policy actions to deliver three outputs approved \nunder the program: (i) reduced cost of doing business, (ii) strengthened protection for businesses, \nand  (iii)  increased  business  innovation  and  productivity.  Subprogram  2  also  includes  two \nimportant loan effectiveness conditions. \n \n3.  Subprogram 2 was declared effective on 22 September 2017. \n \nII.  MACROECONOMIC SITUATION \n4.  Economic growth in Tajikistan slowed to 6.0% in the first half of 2017 from 6.5% in the \nsame period of 2016. Industry expanded by 21.3%, up from 12.1% a year earlier on gains of \n26.3% in mining, 20.9% in manufacturing, and 16.2% in electricity generation. Retail trade and \nservices grew by 3.6% despite low remittances. Average annual inflation accelerated to 7.7%, \nmainly because the recapitalization of troubled banks led to a 17.8% increase in the broad money \nsupply. Consumer prices rose cumulatively by 5.9% in the first half of 2017, up from 3.1% a year \nearlier, reflecting price increases of 8.3% for food, 1.3% for other goods, and 4.9% for services. \nTo curb inflation, the National Bank of Tajikistan raised the refinancing rate by 5 percentage points \nin two steps\u2014from 11.0% to 12.5% in February 2017 and to 16.0% in March. It also more than \ndoubled open market sales of securities and treasury bills to rein in liquidity. Despite these \nmeasures, the somoni depreciated by 11.9% against the United States dollar in the first half of \n2017, mainly because the official exchange rate became realigned with the market rate.  \n \n5.   Tajikistan\u2019s  fiscal  situation  is  presented  in  Table  1.  General  revenue  and  grants \nconstituted about 24% of gross domestic product (GDP) excluding special funds and grants for \npublic investment projects from development partners. If those funds were included, general \nrevenue and grants was about 29% of GDP in the same year. Deficit will remain at around 4% of \nGDP without further fiscal initiatives. There will be one percentage point decline in deficit between \n2017 and 2019. Public debt to GDP ratio will decline from 47% in 2017 to 43% in 2020. \n \n6.  Uncertain remittances contributed to a 15.0% decline in imports in the first half of 2017, \nwhile higher industrial production contributed to a 73.4% rise in exports. The current account \ndeficit is forecast at about 5.5% of GDP in both 2017 and 2018 because of further anticipated \ncurrency depreciation and uncertainty about remittances. \n \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016.

LOAN EFFECTIVENESS \n7.  To mitigate the fiscal and banking system risks, subprogram 2 includes two conditions for \neffectiveness: (i) the government must have completed, to the satisfaction of ADB, asset quality \nreviews (AQRs) of the five largest banks (Agroinvestbank, Amonatbank, Eskhatabank, Orienbank, \nand Tojiksodirotbank); and (ii) the government must have adopted, to the satisfaction of ADB, a \nfiscal strategy that will credibly reduce the budget deficit, including the public investment program, \nto 2.5% of GDP in 2017 and assure that the budget deficit in 2018 and 2019 is consistent with \ndebt sustainability.  \n \n8.  The purpose of the AQRs is to obtain a better understanding of the systemic risks to \nTajikistan\u2019s banking system, which has been severely affected by the economic decline that \nbegan in late 2014. Significant deficiencies in corporate governance, credit underwriting, risk \nmanagement, and prudential supervision of the banks also pose challenges to the solvency of \nthe banking system. This has constrained the ability of banks to provide funding for private \ninvestments. The high liquidity and solvency risks require substantial sovereign liquidity and \ncapital support that are likely to be challenging in the context of Tajikistan\u2019s fiscal consolidation \ninitiatives. \n ", "3 \n9.  ADB takes the view that the AQRs provided valuable information on the solvency of the \nbanking  system  that  was  hitherto  not  available.  More  importantly  the  AQRs  constitute  an \nimportant milestone to understand the scope of banking system risks as a basis for a more \nintensive policy dialogue of ADB with government and in coordination with the IMF and other \ninternational financial institutions. In this respect, the AQRs are viewed satisfactory as required \nby ADB\u2019s loan effectiveness conditions.3  \n \n10.  ADB helped the government prepare a comprehensive fiscal strategy document, which \nwas approved and adopted by the government on 21 September 2017. The medium-term fiscal \nstrategy is a combination of (i) revenue-led fiscal consolidation, and (ii) moderation in expenditure \ngrowth and shifting away from recurrent to growth promoting capital expenditure. The strategy \nrequires an increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio in the medium term. If the deficit is kept at 2.5% of \nGDP, the debt path would be sustainable in the medium term.

CONCLUSION \n12.  The  government  has  made  significant  progress  in  implementing  reforms  under \nsubprogram 2. It has fully complied with 11 policy actions and incurred adjustment costs as \nenvisaged under subprogram 2.5 There are two policy actions which are not fully complied with. \nThe government has completed all the actions related to the web portal (substantially complied \npolicy action 6). Selection of the software vendor for the web portal is not a difficult reform, and \nwill be completed soon with ADB\u2019s financial and procurement support. The other substantially \ncomplied policy action deals with budget allocation of TJS80 million for subsidies to low income \nconsumers to mitigate the impact of tariff increases in 2017 (policy action 9). The government has \nallocated TJS69.4 million (Table 3), representing a sharp rise of 61.4% over 2016 amount (TJS43 \nmillion). The government has shown a strong commitment to carrying out the reforms to their \nlogical conclusion in these two areas. \n \n13.  Subprogram 2 was developed as a follow up on subprogram 1. Many of the structural \nshortcomings in Tajikistan\u2019s economy\u2014low competitiveness of products in particular\u2014reflect the \nlimited progress in expanding its productive capabilities and in tapping economic opportunities \nthat  create  more  wealth.  Binding  constraints  to  private  investment  include  an  unfavorable \nbusiness  environment,  unreliable  access  to  electricity  (particularly  during  the  winter),  poor \ntransport  connectivity  with  external  markets,  and  limited  integration  with  global  sources  of \nknowledge. Since 2016, access to finance has also emerged as a binding constraint, given the \ncredit crunch associated with the deteriorating solvency and liquidity in the banks. A programmatic \napproach with three separate subprograms was launched to address these binding constraints. \n \n14.  Subprogram 2 seeks to consolidate the gains made during subprogram 1. It is targeted at \nimproving the ease of doing business by addressing the constraints in three areas: (i) poor \ninfrastructure, (ii) limited integration with global sources of knowledge, and (iii) weak institutional \nstructure.  \n \n15.  Significant achievements have been seen in several key areas, such as a reduction in \ninspection bodies, a reduction in taxes, transparency in government acts and incentives, and \nstrengthened microcredit. These steps forward were possible because the government took \nownership to ensure that the reforms were implemented successfully. Implementation of some \npolicy actions and two loan effectiveness conditions were challenging and required support and \ncoordination across several line ministries and development partners, which caused delays. ADB \nprovided strong support to (i) set up the web portal (policy action 6), (ii) select the management \npersonnel for the microcredit refinance fund (policy action 12),6 and (iii) design the fiscal strategy \n                                                \n5  Some of these adjustment costs include higher budget allocations for (i) the refinancing credit fund for financing rural \nbusinesses and farmers; (ii) government institutions, to pay for higher electricity tariffs arising from the reduction of \nimplicit subsidies in the tariffs; (iii) the low-income population to compensate for higher electricity costs; and (iv) the \nEntrepreneurship Support Fund for financing of businesses. \n6  A recruitment agency was hired for this purpose. \n ", "8   \npaper.  These  were  extremely  time-intensive  initiatives.  The  government  accomplished  the \nenormous task of completing the AQRs of five banks. Despite these delays, the achievements \nwere the result of proactive steps taken by the executing agency staff and strong support from \nthe senior staff of the government\u2019s Finance Department.   \n \nVI.
