The report also describes the \nproposed  administration  of  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  be  provided  by  the  Japan  Fund  for \nPoverty Reduction for Improving Energy Efficiency and Capacity, and if the Board approves the \nproposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  approve  the \nadministration of the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n2. \nThe project will (i) build about 1,100 kilometers (km) of new 110-kilovolt (kV), 220 kV, and \n500  kV  transmission  lines;  (ii)  construct  four  new  substations;  and  (iii)  expand  three  existing \nsubstations. The project will cover four of the five regions of Turkmenistan, and will help establish \nan  interconnected  national  transmission  grid  to  improve  reliability  and  energy  efficiency  of  the \nnetwork. Hydrocarbon-rich Turkmenistan has been an exporter of baseload power to its neighbors, \nnotably  Afghanistan.  The  reinforced  transmission  network  is  an  essential  prerequisite  for \nimproving  power  supply  reliability  for  domestic  consumers  and  current  and  expanded  future \nelectricity exports. \n \nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nTurkmenistan is a sparsely populated country with a total population of about 5.7 million, \nthe  lowest  among  Central  Asian  countries.1 Its  economy  is  built  around  its  vast  hydrocarbon \nresources:  Turkmenistan  is  the  12th  largest  natural  gas  producer  in  the  world,  and  the  10th \nbiggest oil producer in Asia and the Pacific.2 The country\u2019s economy expanded at an annual rate \nof 12.3% during 1998\u20132016.3 Hydrocarbon-related products consistently averaged close to 90% \nof annual exports from 2001 to 2015. As the Turkmen economy is highly vulnerable to global oil \nand gas  prices,  economic growth slowed from  over  10%  in 2013\u20132014 to  about  6.5%  in  2017 \nbecause of a sharp contraction in oil and gas export revenues. \n \n4. \nTurkmenistan has the world\u2019s fourth largest share of natural gas reserves, at 9.4% of the \nglobal total or 17.5 trillion cubic meters, after the Russian Federation, Iran, and Qatar.4 Annual \nproduction of natural gas averaged about 60 billion cubic meters (bcm) during 2005\u20132016. The \ncountry is an exporter of gas, primarily to the People\u2019s Republic of China, totaling about 45 bcm \nper year, half of what it used to export in the early 1990s, to its neighbor countries.5 Turkmenistan \nhas more than 5.4 gigawatts of installed power generation capacity, nearly all of which comes \nfrom natural gas-fired power plants. The country clearly has sufficient gas resources to be a major \nexporter of gas and electricity. \n \nTurkmenistan was a key part of the Central Asia Power System (CAPS) created under the \n5. \nauspices of the Soviet Union in the 1970s.6 Turkmenistan\u2019s power system was developed at that \ntime with a strong export orientation because of its rich hydrocarbon resources and its proximity \nto large populations in surrounding countries and regions, such as Afghanistan, Iran, Uzbekistan, \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018. Basic Statistics 2018. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: Turkmenistan, 2017\u20132021. Manila. \n3  International Monetary Fund. World Economic Outlook Database, October 2016. (accessed 20 April 2018). \n4  BP.  2017.  BP  Energy  Outlook:  2017  edition.  https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/pdf/energy-economics/energy-\n\noutlook-2017/bp-energy-outlook-2017.pdf. \n\n5  It stalled gas exports to Iran in 2017 and the Russian Federation in 2016. \n6  The CAPS covered southern Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fand southern Kazakhstan. During the early 1990s, electricity exports from Turkmenistan peaked \nat 13 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year. The collapse of the Soviet Union resulted in a progressive \ndecline in power trade in the CAPS. Turkmenistan was first to disconnect from the CAPS in 2003. \nSubsequently, it maintained seasonal export of electricity, especially during the winter months, to \nTajikistan through Uzbekistan until 2009, but that also stopped once Tajikistan was disconnected \nfrom the CAPS in December 2009. Turkmenistan\u2019s electricity exports declined to 1.5 TWh in 2010. \nBy 2017, its electricity exports had increased to 3.4 TWh thanks to a new export market.  \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  under  its  Central  Asian  Regional  Economic \n6. \nCooperation (CAREC) Program, has been working closely with all regional countries to achieve \nenergy  security  through  power  interconnection  and  power  trade. 7  Within  CAREC,  there  are \nenergy resource complementarities and uneven distribution of energy among countries. Central \nAsian countries are energy rich and can export it, including to large markets in energy-deficient \nAfghanistan and Pakistan. While Central Asian countries are 100% electrified with stable demand \ngrowth,  Afghanistan  and  Pakistan  have  large  populations  without  access  to  energy;  demand \ngrowth is therefore high. Thus, CAREC\u2019s Central Asia\u2013South Asia Regional Energy Market is one \nof the key pillars of CAREC\u2019s work plan for the energy sector. \n \n7. \nADB\u2019s regional energy trade initiatives in CAREC have supported linking Turkmenistan\u2019s \nlarge  energy  resources  to  large  new  markets.  The  proposed  1,800  km  Turkmenistan\u2013\nAfghanistan\u2013Pakistan\u2013India gas pipeline aims to export an annual 33 bcm, equivalent to a supply \nof about 50,000 megawatts (MW) of power generation capacity to South Asia. Within the Central \nAsia\u2013South  Asia  Regional  Energy  Market  framework,  through  the  Turkmenistan\u2013Uzbekistan\u2013\nTajikistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan  (TUTAP)  and  Turkmenistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan  power \ninterconnection initiatives, ADB is financing multiple electricity transmission lines to enable power \nexport  initially  to  Afghanistan.  This  has  enabled  Afghanistan  to  access  more  than  3  TWh  of \nelectricity from its neighbors. Collectively, these imports will supply electricity to about 8 million \nAfghan  households,  businesses,  and  industries.  But  numerous  households  in  Pakistan  and \nAfghanistan still do not have access to modern electricity, especially in cities close to the border \nwith Turkmenistan. The proposed project will enable future power trade with Pakistan. \n \n8. \nWith ADB\u2019s support within the CAREC umbrella, Turkmenistan became the third country \nto  export  power  to  Afghanistan,  after  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan.  Under  the  TUTAP  power \ninterconnection  framework,  Turkmenistan  signed  a  power  purchase  and sales  agreement  with \nAfghanistan extending to 2028, for an estimated export volume of about 1.5 TWh per year valued \nat about $75 million per year, assuming an average price of $0.05 per kilowatt hours (kWh). \n\n9. \nSince 2012, ADB has financed multiple projects in Afghanistan to strengthen Turkmen-\nAfghan  power  interconnection.  This  includes  construction  of  500-kV  transmission  line  from \nAfghan-Turkmen  border  to  Kabul,  associated  sub-stations  and  distribution  networks  in  several \nprovinces  to  utilize  imported  power  from  Turkmenistan. 8 These  projects  are  under  advanced \nstages of construction and will be completed and put into operation during 2019\u20132020. ADB is \nalso financing a high voltage direct current back-to-back convertor station inside Afghanistan that \nwill enable synchronized power transfer from Turkmenistan to the Afghan national grid.9 \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n7  Turkmenistan joined CAREC in 2010. \n8   ADB.

Turkmenistan  and  Uzbekistan \nsigned a memorandum of understanding that aims to reconnect Turkmenistan with Uzbekistan \ninitially on an island mode\u2014supply with a dedicated generator without connecting the two power \ngrids\u2014for Turkmenistan to export electricity to part of Uzbekistan. It may open new opportunities \nfor  power  export  to  Kazakhstan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Tajikistan.  In  the  backdrop  of  this \npromising  power  export  outlook  for  Turkmenistan,  some  part  of  its  power  grid  needs  urgent \nrehabilitation and expansion as described below.  \n \n11. \nTurkmenistan  has  a  100%  electrification rate  and a transmission  network  of more than \n6,100 km. Primarily built in 1970s during the Soviet era, Turkmenistan\u2019s transmission network is \nin urgent need of rehabilitation and expansion. Transmission losses on 500 kV and 220 kV are \nhigh,  at  about  5%,  which  could  be  halved  with  a  modern  transmission  system.  Power  supply \nreliability is low, with a large number of faults in the network, and weak redundancy makes large \nsections of the network vulnerable to outages. The absence of strong interconnections between \ndifferent regions of the country further amplifies the problem for remote regions. \n \n12. \nTurkmenenergo, the State Energy Corporation is the vertically integrated power utility in \nthe  country.  In  2017,  it  produced  more  than  23  TWh  of  electricity,  exporting  15%  of  that  to \nneighboring  countries.    Demand  for  electricity  has  grown  modestly  during  2012\u20132017,  at  an \nannual  average  of  1.5%\u20132.0%.  The  domestic  demand  growth  is  expected  to  be  steady  and \nmoderate in the medium term, with peak electricity demand increasing from about 3,813 MW in \nsummer  2018  to  4,300  MW  by  2024.  The  government  is  in  the  process  of  reinforcing  new \ngeneration capacity to come online. It plans to add 2.5 gigawatts of additional capacity by 2020, \nwhich will provide adequate headroom to export electricity if the grid is strengthened.  \n \n13. \nThe National Programme for Socio-Economic Development of Turkmenistan, 2011\u20132030, \nadopted in May 2010, aims to achieve strong and sustainable economic growth on the basis of \nefficient  integration  of  the  country  into  the  world  economy,  with  maximum  diversification  of  its \nexport  potential.  The  National  Program  for  Socio-Economic  Development  has  identified \ndeveloping the fuel and energy industry as a key component. To meet its strategic objectives to \nexpand  electricity  exports  to  neighboring  countries  and  beyond,  it  is  essential  that  a  robust, \nreliable, and efficient power transmission network is in place. \n \n14. \nFor  the  power  transmission  system  to  be  in  step  with  the  addition  of  new  generation \ncapacity for power export, areas with high loss and low reliability needs immediate attention. A \nwell-integrated  transmission  system  with  multiple  redundancies  removes  overall  reserve \ngeneration capacity, cuts losses, and removes transmission network congestions. System Load-\nflow modeling and studies by independent experts have identified these vulnerable spots.  \n \n15. \n800 MW\u20131,000 MW of additional electricity capacity will be available by implementing the project \nbecause of loss reduction, reduced need for reserve, and optimized power flow. Accordingly, it \nidentified  strengthening  transmission  links  between  the  five  regions  of  Turkmenistan\u2014Ahal, \nBalkan, Dashoguz, Lebap, and Mary\u2014as a high priority. The associated new transmission lines, \nrehabilitation  of  some  key  transmission  line  segments,  constructing  new  substations  and \nexpanding existing substation as envisaged under the project and described in para. 20 below \n\nDetailed  load-flow  modeling\u2014with  and  without  the  investment\u2014indicated  that  about         \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nwill create a ring system to help achieve an N-1 redundancy standard.10 This will provide a highly \nreliable and efficient system due to contingency and interconnections as per international norms. \nIn  addition,  the  system  loss  reduction  will  bring  in  climate  mitigation  financing  valued  at  $3.4 \nmillion based on ADB\u2019s Guidance Note on Counting Climate Finance in Energy.11   \n \nADB\u2019s  recently  approved  Strategy  2030  highlights  infrastructure  development  and \n16. \nregional  cooperation  and \nintegration  as  major  ADB  value  additions  and  comparative \nadvantages.12 Fostering  regional  cooperation  and  integration  is  one  of  the  seven  operational \npriorities  under  the  new  strategy.  The  CAREC  2030  strategic  framework 13  supports  energy \nefficiency improvements, regional cooperation, and power trade. The project is also consistent \nwith the  objectives of  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy14 to support (i)  energy  efficiency  improvements;  (ii) \neffective regional cooperation in the energy sector; and (iii) energy sector investments complying \nwith ADB safeguards policies regarding environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples. \n \n17. \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Turkmenistan,  2017\u20132021  will  help  the  country \nbecome  a key  catalyst for  regional  cooperation and integration  by  diversifying  its markets  and \npositioning it as a trade and transit hub.15 The strategy identifies the export of excess power via \nthe TUTAP power interconnection initiative as an excellent way to achieve these goals.  \n \nThe project is the first such project by any international financial institution in the power \n18. \nsector in Turkmenistan. It will  enable the Government of Turkmenistan to get familiar with and \nintroduce  good  practices  of  robust  techno-economic  evaluation  in  project  investment  decision \nmaking,  higher  safeguard  requirements  consistent  with  international  standards,  an  open \ncompetitive  bidding  process  in  procurement,  advanced  project  management  practices,  and \ninternational  financial  management  reporting.  Together,  these  are  expected  to  deliver  higher \nvalue  addition  with  trickle-down  effects  throughout  the  national  power  system.  A  modern  and \nstrengthened  network,  in  view  of  possibly  reconnecting  to  the  CAPS,  will  provide  significant \nbenefits  to  Turkmenistan  and  Central  Asia.  The  government  alone  would  not  be  able  to \nincorporate these interventions. \n \nB. \n\nImpacts and Outcome \n\n19. \nThe project is aligned with the following impacts: energy exports diversified and capacity \nimproved.

The  analysis  confirmed  sufficient  project  benefits:  increased \nexport capacity, reduced losses, and improved reliability. Site visits by ADB staff confirmed the \ntechnical merits of components, and dilapidated state of some substations component confirmed \nthat  they  need  to  be  urgently  replaced.  The  technical  design  of  recently  installed  facilities \nconforms  to  the  International  Electrotechnical  Commission  standard.  This  should  enable \nparticipation of all major power equipment manufacturers to supply equipment to the country's \npower  transmission  system.  A  site  visit  to  the  Central  Dispatch  Center  confirmed  that \nTurkmenenergo  has  the  necessary  technical  capacity  and  experienced  staff  to  operate  and \nmaintain the transmission infrastructure. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe  economic  and  financial  analyses  were  based  on  system  loss  reductions,  reduced \n35. \noutages, and increased electricity exports. The benefits stream also assumed that Turkmenistan \nwill increase electricity exports as a result of the project beginning in 2022 to southern neighbors, \nand to the CAPS through a connection in Uzbekistan. \n \n \n36. \nThe  economic  analysis  was  completed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects.19 The economic internal rate of return for the project is calculated \nat  11.3%  in  real  terms,  which  is  above  the  economic  viability  threshold  level  of  9%.  The \ncorresponding economic net present value is calculated to be $150 million. Therefore, the project \n                                                \n19  ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila (Appendix 7). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\n \n\nis viable from an economic perspective. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the impact of \nan increase in the project\u2019s capital cost, a decrease in electricity export revenue, a decrease in \nloss reduction, and a 1-year delay in project implementation. The project\u2019s economic internal rate \nof return is most sensitive to export revenues. \n \n37. \nA  financial  evaluation  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \nFinancial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.20 The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the \nproject  is  6.3%,  which  is  greater  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  at  2.3%.  The  net \npresent value was $575 million over a 40-year period. The project is financially viable. Sensitivity \nanalysis was carried out to test the impact of an increase in the project\u2019s capital cost, a decrease \nin  electricity  export  revenue,  a  decrease  in  loss  reduction,  and  a  1-year  delay  in  project \nimplementation. The project\u2019s financial internal rate of return is most sensitive to the electricity \nexport revenues. \n \n38. \nThe  project  is  financially  sustainable  as  Turkmenenergo  generates  stable  operational \nrevenue, which sufficiently covers its operational costs. Turkmenenergo generated positive profit \nfrom  2013  to  2017  and  has  access  to  revenue  denominated  in  United  States  dollars  through \nelectricity  exports.  Turkmenenergo\u2019s  financial  operations  are  expected  to  grow  because  of \nelectricity  exports  to  Afghanistan  and  Iran,  and  electricity  exports  through  Uzbekistan  to \nKazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan after the project is completed. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n39. \nFinancial management. The financial management assessment was conducted in April \n2018. Turkmenenergo\u2019s pre-mitigation risks are substantial because Turkmenenergo\u2019s staff is not \nfamiliar  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  reporting  requirements  and  the  external  auditor\u2019s  procedure  and \nrequirements  for  audited  project  financial  statements.  The  attached  TA  (para.  31)  will  assist \nTurkmenenergo  in  strengthening  its  financial  management  and  staff  capacity,  and  support \nTurkmenenergo  to  transition  from  national  accounting  standards  to  IFRS.  This  will  allow \nTurkmenenergo  to  comply  with  a  recent  government  policy  that  requires  all  state-owned \nenterprises to apply IFRS starting on 1 January 2019. \n \nProcurement.  The  MOE  has  procured  and  Turkmenenergo  has  implemented  large \n40. \ncontracts for  transmission  lines  and  substations, which  were  all  turnkey  contracts  executed  by \ncontractors. The limited experience of Turkmenenergo to execute supply contracts is a major risk. \nA  team  of  individual  international  experts  will  assist  in  the  bidding  process  and  contract \nmanagement.  The  overall  risk  rating  is  categorized  substantial.  Although  the  risks  of  limited \nexperience could cause adverse impacts on project implementation, they are unlikely to occur (or \nif they occur the impact would be low) as Turkmenenergo will use individual technical experts to \nsupplement their own expertise. \n \n41. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOE.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 17). \nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n42. \nThe  increased  efficiency  and  reliability  brought  by  the rehabilitation will  have a positive \nimpact on economic growth and social services such as schools and health care facilities, leading \nto increased community welfare in Turkmenistan and even more so in neighboring Afghanistan. \n\n                                                \n20  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila (Appendix 8). \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nImproved energy supply will boost business development activities and new job growth. Electricity \ndelivery will equally benefit households and businesses run by women and men. \n  \nE. \n \n43. \nEnvironment (category B). The sites selected for new substations and transmission lines \nare barren land away from habitation and devoid of any vegetation or faunal movement, with most \nof  the  transmission  line  alignment  passing  through  desert  areas  with  minimal  impacts  on  the \nenvironment.  The  initial  environmental  examination  found  that  the  project  impacts  during  the \nconstruction stage are expected to be limited, insignificant, and site-specific because of civil works \nand inappropriate disposal of waste. These impacts will be minimized by the use of effective waste \nmanagement  and  good  site  management  practices.  Impacts  during  the  operation  stage  are \nrelated  to  electrocution  or  collision  of  birds  and  will  be  minimized  with  design  measures. \nOccupational  health  and  safety  risks  are  also  anticipated  during  the  construction  stage,  and \nmaintenance  activities  are  addressed  in  the  EMP.  A  full-time  environment  staff  position  in  the \nPMU will be recruited. The TA will provide training to PMU and PIU staff for capacity building in \nenvironmental  management  to ensure full  compliance with ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009) requirements. \n \n44. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). A due diligence report was conducted to support \nthe  C  categorization.  All  civil  works  in  substations  will  be  implemented  within  the  confines  of \nexisting substations, or on unencumbered land where no involuntary land acquisition or livelihood \nimpacts  will  occur.  The  transmission  lines  will  be  parallel  to  existing  lines  and  located  in  the \nKarakum Desert, which dominates central Turkmenistan. The scarcity of settlements and arable \nland  is  such  that  the  project  will  not  require  any  land  acquisition  or  impact  any  assets.  The \ntransmission  line  route  design  had  sufficient  flexibility  to  avoid  any  land  acquisition  along  the \ntransmission routes. Should monitoring during project implementation reveal any unanticipated \nand unavoidable impacts, a land acquisition and resettlement plan will be prepared. \n \n45. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  project  will  not  have  any  negative  impact  on \nindigenous people. Consultations with key stakeholders in Dashoguz and Serdar, and with some \nlocal community members, confirmed that no indigenous people live in the project area. \n \nF. \n \n46. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nRisks \n\nTable 4:  Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigation Measures \n\nDelays in power export agreements \nresults in lower volume of power \ntrade  \n\nADB supported long-term power purchase agreements between \nAFG and TKM (para. 8) reduces the risk substantially.  \n \nThe high-level announcements (para. 10) and ongoing efforts on \nCAPS resurrection have reduced associated risks.   \n\n                                                \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\n \n\nRisks \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nQuality of construction not in \naccordance with internationally \naccepted standards because of lack \nof dedicated project implementation \nconsultants \nInadequate procurement capacity \n(workforce, machinery) to \nimplement project on schedule \n\nDelayed and incomplete \nsubmission of financial information \n\nDelays due to limited experience \nwith the ADB\u2019s requirements and \ndisbursement procedures  \n\nRequirement in the bidding document for suppliers to supervise \nthe installation of critical equipment \n \nOn-the-job or practical training to Turkmenenergo on contract \nmanagement and construction supervision ahead of procurement \nTurkmenenergo may subcontract part of the works to qualified \nsubcontractors \n \nProject implementation units will have individual consultants to \nclosely monitor construction work at each site, and the project will \nfinance new construction equipment \nCapacity building support will improve timely financial reporting \nfor the project and assist Turkmenenergo to convert its financial \nstatement prepared under national accounting standards to \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards  \nDisbursement and financial management training \n \nFinancial management consultant will support Turkmenenergo to \nprepare withdrawal application and financial reporting \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, AFG = Afghanistan, CAPS = Central Asian Power System, TKM = Turkmenistan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe  government  and  Turkmenenergo  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the \n47. \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and loan documents.  \n \n48. \nThe government and Turkmenenergo have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject including the execution of the subsidiary loan agreement, which are set forth in the draft \nloan agreement and project agreement. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n49. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$500,000,000 to Turkmenistan for  the  National  Power  Grid  Strengthening  Project, from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources,  in  regular  terms  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of  25  years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n17 October 2018 \n\n \n\n\f \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nEnergy exports diversified and capacity improved (National Programme for Socio- Economic Development \nof Turkmenistan, 2011\u20132030) \n\n \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\nRisks \n\na\u2012c.
