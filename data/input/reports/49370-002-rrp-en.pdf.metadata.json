THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nTurkmenistan for the National Power Grid Strengthening Project. The report also describes the \nproposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction for Improving Energy Efficiency and Capacity, and if the Board approves the \nproposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  approve  the \nadministration of the TA. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n2.  The project will (i) build about 1,100 kilometers (km) of new 110-kilovolt (kV), 220 kV, and \n500 kV transmission lines; (ii) construct four new substations; and (iii) expand three existing \nsubstations. The project will cover four of the five regions of Turkmenistan, and will help establish \nan interconnected national transmission grid to improve reliability and energy efficiency of the \nnetwork. Hydrocarbon-rich Turkmenistan has been an exporter of baseload power to its neighbors, \nnotably  Afghanistan.  The  reinforced  transmission  network  is  an  essential  prerequisite  for \nimproving power supply reliability for domestic consumers and current and expanded future \nelectricity exports. \n \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Turkmenistan is a sparsely populated country with a total population of about 5.7 million, \nthe lowest among Central Asian countries.1 Its economy is built around its vast hydrocarbon \nresources: Turkmenistan is the 12th largest natural gas producer in the world, and the 10th \nbiggest oil producer in Asia and the Pacific.2 The country\u2019s economy expanded at an annual rate \nof 12.3% during 1998\u20132016.3 Hydrocarbon-related products consistently averaged close to 90% \nof annual exports from 2001 to 2015. As the Turkmen economy is highly vulnerable to global oil \nand gas prices, economic growth slowed from over 10% in 2013\u20132014 to about 6.5% in 2017 \nbecause of a sharp contraction in oil and gas export revenues. \n \n4.  Turkmenistan has the world\u2019s fourth largest share of natural gas reserves, at 9.4% of the \nglobal total or 17.5 trillion cubic meters, after the Russian Federation, Iran, and Qatar.4 Annual \nproduction of natural gas averaged about 60 billion cubic meters (bcm) during 2005\u20132016. The \ncountry is an exporter of gas, primarily to the People\u2019s Republic of China, totaling about 45 bcm \nper year, half of what it used to export in the early 1990s, to its neighbor countries.5 Turkmenistan \nhas more than 5.4 gigawatts of installed power generation capacity, nearly all of which comes \nfrom natural gas-fired power plants. The country clearly has sufficient gas resources to be a major \nexporter of gas and electricity. \n \n5.  Turkmenistan was a key part of the Central Asia Power System (CAPS) created under the \nauspices of the Soviet Union in the 1970s.6 Turkmenistan\u2019s power system was developed at that \ntime with a strong export orientation because of its rich hydrocarbon resources and its proximity \nto large populations in surrounding countries and regions, such as Afghanistan, Iran, Uzbekistan, \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018. Basic Statistics 2018. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: Turkmenistan, 2017\u20132021. Manila. \n3  International Monetary Fund. World Economic Outlook Database, October 2016. (accessed 20 April 2018). \n4  BP. 2017. BP Energy Outlook: 2017 edition. https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/pdf/energy-economics/energy-\noutlook-2017/bp-energy-outlook-2017.pdf. \n5  It stalled gas exports to Iran in 2017 and the Russian Federation in 2016. \n6  The CAPS covered southern Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \n ", "2 \nand southern Kazakhstan. During the early 1990s, electricity exports from Turkmenistan peaked \nat 13 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year. The collapse of the Soviet Union resulted in a progressive \ndecline in power trade in the CAPS. Turkmenistan was first to disconnect from the CAPS in 2003. \nSubsequently, it maintained seasonal export of electricity, especially during the winter months, to \nTajikistan through Uzbekistan until 2009, but that also stopped once Tajikistan was disconnected \nfrom the CAPS in December 2009. Turkmenistan\u2019s electricity exports declined to 1.5 TWh in 2010. \nBy 2017, its electricity exports had increased to 3.4 TWh thanks to a new export market.  \n \n6.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  under  its  Central  Asian  Regional  Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) Program, has been working closely with all regional countries to achieve \nenergy security through power interconnection and power trade.7 Within CAREC, there are \nenergy resource complementarities and uneven distribution of energy among countries. Central \nAsian countries are energy rich and can export it, including to large markets in energy-deficient \nAfghanistan and Pakistan. While Central Asian countries are 100% electrified with stable demand \ngrowth, Afghanistan and Pakistan have large populations without access to energy; demand \ngrowth is therefore high. Thus, CAREC\u2019s Central Asia\u2013South Asia Regional Energy Market is one \nof the key pillars of CAREC\u2019s work plan for the energy sector. \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s regional energy trade initiatives in CAREC have supported linking Turkmenistan\u2019s \nlarge  energy  resources  to  large  new  markets.  The  proposed  1,800  km  Turkmenistan\u2013\nAfghanistan\u2013Pakistan\u2013India gas pipeline aims to export an annual 33 bcm, equivalent to a supply \nof about 50,000 megawatts (MW) of power generation capacity to South Asia. Within the Central \nAsia\u2013South Asia Regional Energy Market framework, through the Turkmenistan\u2013Uzbekistan\u2013\nTajikistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan  (TUTAP)  and  Turkmenistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan  power \ninterconnection initiatives, ADB is financing multiple electricity transmission lines to enable power \nexport initially to Afghanistan. This has enabled Afghanistan to access more than 3 TWh of \nelectricity from its neighbors. Collectively, these imports will supply electricity to about 8 million \nAfghan households, businesses, and industries. But numerous households in Pakistan and \nAfghanistan still do not have access to modern electricity, especially in cities close to the border \nwith Turkmenistan. The proposed project will enable future power trade with Pakistan. \n \n8.  With ADB\u2019s support within the CAREC umbrella, Turkmenistan became the third country \nto  export  power to  Afghanistan,  after Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan.  Under the TUTAP  power \ninterconnection framework, Turkmenistan signed a power purchase and sales agreement with \nAfghanistan extending to 2028, for an estimated export volume of about 1.5 TWh per year valued \nat about $75 million per year, assuming an average price of $0.05 per kilowatt hours (kWh). \n \n9.  Since 2012, ADB has financed multiple projects in Afghanistan to strengthen Turkmen-\nAfghan  power  interconnection. This  includes  construction  of 500-kV transmission  line from \nAfghan-Turkmen border to Kabul, associated sub-stations and distribution networks in several \nprovinces to utilize imported power from Turkmenistan.8 These projects are under advanced \nstages of construction and will be completed and put into operation during 2019\u20132020. ADB is \nalso financing a high voltage direct current back-to-back convertor station inside Afghanistan that \nwill enable synchronized power transfer from Turkmenistan to the Afghan national grid.9 \n \n                                                \n7  Turkmenistan joined CAREC in 2010. \n8   ADB.

In parallel, the recent opening of Uzbekistan for power trade in the CAPS\u2014as illustrated \nby each of its bilateral declarations with the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan\u2014has \ncreated new dynamism and hope in reinvigorating the CAPS. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan \nsigned a memorandum of understanding that aims to reconnect Turkmenistan with Uzbekistan \ninitially on an island mode\u2014supply with a dedicated generator without connecting the two power \ngrids\u2014for Turkmenistan to export electricity to part of Uzbekistan. It may open new opportunities \nfor power export to Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan. In the backdrop of this \npromising power export outlook for Turkmenistan, some part of its power grid needs urgent \nrehabilitation and expansion as described below.  \n \n11.  Turkmenistan has a 100% electrification rate and a transmission network of more than \n6,100 km. Primarily built in 1970s during the Soviet era, Turkmenistan\u2019s transmission network is \nin urgent need of rehabilitation and expansion. Transmission losses on 500 kV and 220 kV are \nhigh, at about 5%, which could be halved with a modern transmission system. Power supply \nreliability is low, with a large number of faults in the network, and weak redundancy makes large \nsections of the network vulnerable to outages. The absence of strong interconnections between \ndifferent regions of the country further amplifies the problem for remote regions. \n \n12.  Turkmenenergo, the State Energy Corporation is the vertically integrated power utility in \nthe country. In 2017, it produced more than 23 TWh of electricity, exporting 15% of that to \nneighboring countries.  Demand for electricity has grown modestly during 2012\u20132017, at an \nannual average of 1.5%\u20132.0%. The domestic demand growth is expected to be steady and \nmoderate in the medium term, with peak electricity demand increasing from about 3,813 MW in \nsummer 2018 to 4,300 MW by 2024. The government is in the process of reinforcing new \ngeneration capacity to come online. It plans to add 2.5 gigawatts of additional capacity by 2020, \nwhich will provide adequate headroom to export electricity if the grid is strengthened.  \n \n13.  The National Programme for Socio-Economic Development of Turkmenistan, 2011\u20132030, \nadopted in May 2010, aims to achieve strong and sustainable economic growth on the basis of \nefficient integration of the country into the world economy, with maximum diversification of its \nexport  potential.  The  National  Program  for  Socio-Economic  Development  has  identified \ndeveloping the fuel and energy industry as a key component. To meet its strategic objectives to \nexpand electricity exports to neighboring countries and beyond, it is essential that a robust, \nreliable, and efficient power transmission network is in place. \n \n14.  For the power transmission system to be in step with the addition of new generation \ncapacity for power export, areas with high loss and low reliability needs immediate attention. A \nwell-integrated  transmission  system  with  multiple  redundancies  removes  overall  reserve \ngeneration capacity, cuts losses, and removes transmission network congestions. System Load-\nflow modeling and studies by independent experts have identified these vulnerable spots.  \n \n15.  Detailed  load-flow  modeling\u2014with  and  without  the  investment\u2014indicated  that  about         \n800 MW\u20131,000 MW of additional electricity capacity will be available by implementing the project \nbecause of loss reduction, reduced need for reserve, and optimized power flow. Accordingly, it \nidentified strengthening transmission links between the five regions of Turkmenistan\u2014Ahal, \nBalkan, Dashoguz, Lebap, and Mary\u2014as a high priority. The associated new transmission lines, \nrehabilitation  of  some  key  transmission  line  segments,  constructing  new  substations  and \nexpanding existing substation as envisaged under the project and described in para. 20 below \n ", "4 \nwill create a ring system to help achieve an N-1 redundancy standard.10 This will provide a highly \nreliable and efficient system due to contingency and interconnections as per international norms. \nIn addition, the system loss reduction will bring in climate mitigation financing valued at $3.4 \nmillion based on ADB\u2019s Guidance Note on Counting Climate Finance in Energy.11   \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s  recently  approved  Strategy  2030  highlights  infrastructure  development  and \nregional  cooperation  and  integration  as  major  ADB  value  additions  and  comparative \nadvantages.12 Fostering regional cooperation and integration is one of the seven operational \npriorities under the new strategy. The CAREC 2030 strategic framework13 supports energy \nefficiency improvements, regional cooperation, and power trade. The project is also consistent \nwith the objectives of ADB\u2019s Energy Policy14 to support (i) energy efficiency improvements; (ii) \neffective regional cooperation in the energy sector; and (iii) energy sector investments complying \nwith ADB safeguards policies regarding environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples. \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Turkmenistan, 2017\u20132021 will help the country \nbecome a key catalyst for regional cooperation and integration by diversifying its markets and \npositioning it as a trade and transit hub.15 The strategy identifies the export of excess power via \nthe TUTAP power interconnection initiative as an excellent way to achieve these goals.  \n \n18.  The project is the first such project by any international financial institution in the power \nsector in Turkmenistan. It will enable the Government of Turkmenistan to get familiar with and \nintroduce good practices of robust techno-economic evaluation in project investment decision \nmaking,  higher  safeguard  requirements  consistent  with  international  standards,  an  open \ncompetitive  bidding  process  in  procurement,  advanced  project management  practices,  and \ninternational financial management reporting. Together, these are expected to deliver higher \nvalue addition with trickle-down effects throughout the national power system. A modern and \nstrengthened network, in view of possibly reconnecting to the CAPS, will provide significant \nbenefits  to  Turkmenistan  and  Central  Asia.  The  government  alone  would  not  be  able  to \nincorporate these interventions. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n19.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: energy exports diversified and capacity \nimproved. The project will have the following outcomes: reliability of power supply improved and \nvolume of power export increased.16 \n \nC.  Outputs \n20.  Output 1: Power transmission infrastructure strengthened.

The attached Transaction Technical Assistance (TRTA) for Improving Energy Efficiency \nand Capacity will contribute to a sustainable and efficient energy sector in Turkmenistan through \n(i) assistance with the development of a road map on energy efficiency; (ii) capacity development \non financial management, especially assisting Turkmenenergo\u2019s transition toward International \nFinancial Reporting Standards; and (iii) capacity enhancement of the MOE and Turkmenenergo \non  project  development  and  implementation,  including  procurement,  engineering,  and \nenvironment. The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB.  \n \n32.  ADB will recruit consultants financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction to support \nthe capacities of the PMU and PIU. \n \n33.  The  MOE  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office  accommodation, \ncounterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. The MOE will be the executing agency. The TA \nwill be implemented over 30 months from November 2018 to May 2021. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n34.  Due  diligence,  including  supply\u2013demand  and  power  system  analysis,  confirmed  the \ntechnical viability of the project and the suitability of the specific components of the project within \nthe power transmission system. The analysis confirmed sufficient project benefits: increased \nexport capacity, reduced losses, and improved reliability. Site visits by ADB staff confirmed the \ntechnical merits of components, and dilapidated state of some substations component confirmed \nthat they need to be urgently replaced. The technical design of recently installed facilities \nconforms  to  the  International  Electrotechnical  Commission  standard.  This  should  enable \nparticipation of all major power equipment manufacturers to supply equipment to the country's \npower  transmission  system.  A  site  visit  to  the  Central  Dispatch  Center  confirmed  that \nTurkmenenergo has the necessary technical capacity and experienced staff to operate and \nmaintain the transmission infrastructure. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n35.  The economic and financial analyses were based on system loss reductions, reduced \noutages, and increased electricity exports. The benefits stream also assumed that Turkmenistan \nwill increase electricity exports as a result of the project beginning in 2022 to southern neighbors, \nand to the CAPS through a connection in Uzbekistan. \n \n \n36.  The economic analysis was completed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects.19 The economic internal rate of return for the project is calculated \nat  11.3%  in  real  terms,  which  is  above  the  economic  viability  threshold  level  of  9%. The \ncorresponding economic net present value is calculated to be $150 million. Therefore, the project \n                                                \n19  ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila (Appendix 7). \n ", "9 \n \nis viable from an economic perspective. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the impact of \nan increase in the project\u2019s capital cost, a decrease in electricity export revenue, a decrease in \nloss reduction, and a 1-year delay in project implementation. The project\u2019s economic internal rate \nof return is most sensitive to export revenues. \n \n37.  A financial evaluation was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects.20 The financial internal rate of return for the \nproject is 6.3%, which is greater than the weighted average cost of capital at 2.3%. The net \npresent value was $575 million over a 40-year period. The project is financially viable. Sensitivity \nanalysis was carried out to test the impact of an increase in the project\u2019s capital cost, a decrease \nin  electricity  export  revenue,  a  decrease  in  loss  reduction,  and  a  1-year  delay  in  project \nimplementation. The project\u2019s financial internal rate of return is most sensitive to the electricity \nexport revenues. \n \n38.  The project is financially sustainable as Turkmenenergo generates stable operational \nrevenue, which sufficiently covers its operational costs. Turkmenenergo generated positive profit \nfrom 2013 to 2017 and has access to revenue denominated in United States dollars through \nelectricity  exports.  Turkmenenergo\u2019s  financial  operations  are  expected  to  grow  because  of \nelectricity  exports  to  Afghanistan  and  Iran,  and  electricity  exports  through  Uzbekistan  to \nKazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan after the project is completed. \n \nC.  Governance \n39.  Financial management. The financial management assessment was conducted in April \n2018. Turkmenenergo\u2019s pre-mitigation risks are substantial because Turkmenenergo\u2019s staff is not \nfamiliar with ADB\u2019s financial reporting requirements and the external auditor\u2019s procedure and \nrequirements for audited project financial statements. The attached TA (para. 31) will assist \nTurkmenenergo  in  strengthening  its  financial  management  and  staff capacity,  and  support \nTurkmenenergo  to  transition  from  national  accounting  standards  to  IFRS.  This  will  allow \nTurkmenenergo  to  comply  with  a  recent  government  policy  that  requires  all  state-owned \nenterprises to apply IFRS starting on 1 January 2019. \n \n40.  Procurement. The  MOE  has  procured  and Turkmenenergo  has  implemented  large \ncontracts for transmission lines and substations, which were all turnkey contracts executed by \ncontractors. The limited experience of Turkmenenergo to execute supply contracts is a major risk. \nA  team  of  individual  international  experts  will  assist  in  the  bidding  process  and  contract \nmanagement. The overall risk rating is categorized substantial. Although the risks of limited \nexperience could cause adverse impacts on project implementation, they are unlikely to occur (or \nif they occur the impact would be low) as Turkmenenergo will use individual technical experts to \nsupplement their own expertise. \n \n41.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOE.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 17). \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n42.  The increased efficiency and reliability brought by the rehabilitation will have a positive \nimpact on economic growth and social services such as schools and health care facilities, leading \nto increased community welfare in Turkmenistan and even more so in neighboring Afghanistan. \n                                                \n20  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila (Appendix 8). \n ", "10 \nImproved energy supply will boost business development activities and new job growth. Electricity \ndelivery will equally benefit households and businesses run by women and men. \n  \nE.  Safeguards \n \n43.  Environment (category B). The sites selected for new substations and transmission lines \nare barren land away from habitation and devoid of any vegetation or faunal movement, with most \nof the transmission line alignment passing through desert areas with minimal impacts on the \nenvironment. The initial environmental examination found that the project impacts during the \nconstruction stage are expected to be limited, insignificant, and site-specific because of civil works \nand inappropriate disposal of waste. These impacts will be minimized by the use of effective waste \nmanagement and good site management practices. Impacts during the operation stage are \nrelated  to  electrocution  or  collision  of  birds  and  will  be  minimized  with  design  measures. \nOccupational health and safety risks are also anticipated during the construction stage, and \nmaintenance activities are addressed in the EMP. A full-time environment staff position in the \nPMU will be recruited. The TA will provide training to PMU and PIU staff for capacity building in \nenvironmental management to ensure full compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) requirements. \n \n44.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). A due diligence report was conducted to support \nthe C categorization. All civil works in substations will be implemented within the confines of \nexisting substations, or on unencumbered land where no involuntary land acquisition or livelihood \nimpacts will occur. The transmission lines will be parallel to existing lines and located in the \nKarakum Desert, which dominates central Turkmenistan. The scarcity of settlements and arable \nland is such that the project will not require any land acquisition or impact any assets. The \ntransmission line route design had sufficient flexibility to avoid any land acquisition along the \ntransmission routes. Should monitoring during project implementation reveal any unanticipated \nand unavoidable impacts, a land acquisition and resettlement plan will be prepared. \n \n45.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project will not have any negative impact on \nindigenous people. Consultations with key stakeholders in Dashoguz and Serdar, and with some \nlocal community members, confirmed that no indigenous people live in the project area. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n46.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n \nTable 4:  Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nDelays in power export agreements  ADB supported long-term power purchase agreements between \nresults in lower volume of power  AFG and TKM (para. 8) reduces the risk substantially.  \ntrade    \nThe high-level announcements (para. 10) and ongoing efforts on \nCAPS resurrection have reduced associated risks.   \n                                                \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "11 \n \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nQuality of construction not in  Requirement in the bidding document for suppliers to supervise \naccordance with internationally  the installation of critical equipment \naccepted standards because of lack   \nof dedicated project implementation  On-the-job or practical training to Turkmenenergo on contract \nconsultants  management and construction supervision ahead of procurement \nInadequate procurement capacity  Turkmenenergo may subcontract part of the works to qualified \n(workforce, machinery) to  subcontractors \nimplement project on schedule   \nProject implementation units will have individual consultants to \nclosely monitor construction work at each site, and the project will \nfinance new construction equipment \nDelayed and incomplete  Capacity building support will improve timely financial reporting \nsubmission of financial information  for the project and assist Turkmenenergo to convert its financial \nstatement prepared under national accounting standards to \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards  \nDelays due to limited experience  Disbursement and financial management training \nwith the ADB\u2019s requirements and   \ndisbursement procedures   Financial management consultant will support Turkmenenergo to \nprepare withdrawal application and financial reporting \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AFG = Afghanistan, CAPS = Central Asian Power System, TKM = Turkmenistan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nV.
