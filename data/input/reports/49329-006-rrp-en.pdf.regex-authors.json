THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Second City Region Development Project. \n \n2.  The project will support development in the city regions of Dhaka and Khulna by building \non  infrastructure  and  capacity  building  initiatives  implemented  during  the  first  City  Region \nDevelopment Project funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 The project will finance \ncrucial infrastructure in urban and peri-urban areas to stimulate growth and improve livability in \nDhaka and Khulna, two densely populated and rapidly growing city regions in Bangladesh. The \nproject  will  also  continue  strengthening  project  development  capacity,  sustainable  service \ndelivery, and community awareness.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Urbanization.  Bangladesh  is  urbanizing  rapidly,  particularly  in  large  cities  such  as \nDhaka and Khulna, exacerbating challenges in a country that has one of the highest population \ndensities in the world. In 2018, about 61 million people, or 37% of the total population of 164 \nmillion, lived in urban areas. Since 2015 the average annual urban population growth is 3.17%, \nfaster  than  the  annual  national  population  growth  average  of  1.37%.  The  country\u2019s  urban \npopulation is expected to reach 74 million by 2025, or 42% of the total population, with Dhaka \nbecoming  the  world\u2019s  fourth-largest  urban  agglomeration.3  Urbanization  raises  economic \nproductivity through agglomeration advantages, but places severe strains on the environment \nand urban infrastructure and services. More needs to be done urgently, especially in the large \ncity regions, for sustaining growth while safeguarding environmental standards and making \ncities more livable in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.4 \n \n4.  City  region  development.  A  \u201ccity  region\u201d  is an  agglomeration  of  a large  city  (city \ncorporation) surrounding pourashavas (secondary towns) and adjacent peri-urban areas (urban \ncenters in upazilas [subdistricts]) with close economic and social links.5 City region development \ncan improve livability by decongesting a core city and promoting economic growth through \nplanning, institutional development, and infrastructure investments that transcend restrictive \nadministrative jurisdictions. Therefore, closer coordination among fragmented institutions in city \nregions and increased mobility within urban agglomerations are critical. Investments to improve \ncity regions\u2019 resilience to climate and disaster risks triggered by earthquakes, floods, droughts, \n                                                \n1  ADB. Bangladesh: City Region Development Project. \n2  Project preparation was supported by (i) project preparatory technical assistance financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V) and the Netherlands Trust Fund under the ADB-administered \nWater Financing Partnership Facility; and (ii) a project design advance loan of $5 million for preparation, design, \nand supervision consultancy services. Both were approved on 15 December 2016. The Cities Development \nInitiative for Asia (CDIA) provided pre-feasibility support for Khulna (CDIA. 2017. Khulna: Project Overview) and \nGazipur (CDIA. 2017. Gazipur: Project Overview). \n3  United Nations. 2018. World Statistics Pocketbook. New York; and United Nations.

Past  support  and  lessons. The first  project improved  the  Dhaka  and  Khulna  city \nregions by (i) upgrading roads, bridges, and bus terminals to reduce travel time and enhance \nroad safety; (ii) improving storm drains to reduce flooding; (iii) upgrading the water supply; \n(iv) improving  sanitation  access  through  public  toilets;  and  (v)  improving  solid  waste \nmanagement.8 The first project also financed the preparation of the Dhaka Structure Plan, \n2016\u20132035,9 a framework for infrastructure development and interagency coordination, and \nsupported project municipalities in improving governance and service delivery.10 Overall, the \nfirst project facilitated logistics, easier access to employment opportunities and social service \nfacilities,  and  the  reduction  of  water  logging  and  incidences  of  waterborne  diseases.11 \nNotwithstanding  progress  made  under  earlier  support  from  ADB  and  other  development \npartners,12  key  implementation  issues  under  the  first  project  that  need  attention  include \ninteragency coordination for decision-making, a significant infrastructure gap, start-up delays in \ndetailed design preparation, and timely implementation of project activities of diverse nature. \nThe project builds on lessons and past gains in community awareness, institutional capacity, \nand  coordination  among  municipalities,13  while  continuing  to  develop  much-needed \ninfrastructure in the Dhaka and Khulna city regions.14 \n \n6.  Value addition. Investments will be in multiple municipalities based on priorities defined \nin the regional development plans of the two city regions. For the Dhaka city region, investments \nare for the first time being selected based on the Dhaka Structure Plan to improve connectivity \nand linkage of peri-urban areas within the city region. For the Khulna city region, the preparation \nof comprehensive drainage master plans and related critical infrastructure investments, as well \nas a detailed solid waste management concept for Khulna city corporation (KCC), will improve \nclimate and disaster resilience and overall livability.15 To reduce start-up delays in additional \nfuture projects, support for the preparation of detailed engineering designs for investments \ninvolving the latest technologies and smart applications, including integrated real-time data \n                                                \n6  Climate Change Assessment and Abridged Climate Risk and Vulnerability Analysis Report (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  ADB-supported urban projects include (i) ADB.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n17.  The  executing  agency  together  with  project  preparation  consultants  examined  the \ntechnical options and considered climate- and disaster-resilient design measures based on a \nclimate risk assessment and flood mapping. Dhaka city region roads were selected based on \nconnectivity to key roads, population served, present condition, traffic count, and travel time \nsavings, among other criteria. Public information campaigns and traffic management assistance \nwere  recommended  for  subprojects  in  built-up  areas,  and  road  design  guidelines  were \ndeveloped  to  address  climate  change  adaptation  measures.  Drainage  subprojects  were \nselected considering the type and location of drains with respect to the drainage network, \nconnectivity to the outfall, and the improvements required. Community awareness programs and \nimproved solid waste management will improve the overall environment and reduce drainage \ncongestion. Development and update of drainage master plans and preparation of O&M plans \nwill  improve  overall  planning  capacity,  infrastructure  quality,  and  sustainability  of  service \ndelivery. Design options were compared before selecting the best possible technologies in \nterms  of  cost,  construction  materials,  and  environmental  and  social  impacts.  Sample \nsubprojects  developed  during  project  preparation  confirmed  technical  viability  with  due \nconsideration  of  local  capacity  for  implementation  and  O&M.  The  same  approach  will  be \nfollowed for subprojects to be prepared during project implementation. All subprojects will be \ntechnically and operationally appropriate; least-cost; and designed based on a whole-of-life \nanalysis, including appropriate climate and disaster resilience measures based on current risk \nscenarios. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n18.  Economic analysis. The economic rationale for the government\u2019s intervention is sound, \nas the project aims to provide stronger and more sustainable urban basic services focusing on \ndrainage systems, urban roads, and solid waste management in the Dhaka and Khulna city \nregions. The economic internal rates of return of the three sample subprojects were (i) 11.7% \n ", "7 \nfor  drainage  (Sonargaon);  (ii)  16.3%  for  roads  (Savar);  and  (iii)  15.3%  for  solid  waste \nmanagement (Khulna), higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital estimated at 9.0%, \nindicating  significant  economic  returns.  Most  of  the  sample  subprojects  have  also  yielded \nsatisfactory results when subjected to sensitivity analysis using the following downside risks: (i) \n20% capital cost overrun, (ii) 20% O&M cost overrun, (iii) 20% decline in estimated benefits, (iv) \n1-year implementation delay, and (v) all four downside risks. Economic viability could be higher \nif unquantifiable benefits such as environmental improvements are included in the analysis.24 \n \n19.  Financial analysis. The financial analysis was conducted for three sample subprojects \nto make sure that the project municipalities can cover the incremental costs; all subprojects are \nexpected  to  be  maintained  through  their  general  revenue,  as  they  are  all  nonrevenue \ngenerating. The projected overall financial position of the sample project municipalities reflects \nincremental revenues and expenditures, the growth trend of revenue streams, and expected \npopulation  growth.  Financial  projections  demonstrate  that  by  (i)  improving  the  collection \nefficiency of taxes and other charges and (ii) providing continued and additional government \nsupport, the  revenue  account  will  remain  in  surplus. Increased  budget  allocation  to  urban \ndevelopment  during  the  past  5  years  underlines  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  urban \ninfrastructure O&M. The project will also assist the project municipalities in enhancing financial \nsustainability parameters through extensive capacity building support. ADB will closely monitor \nprogress toward the necessary revenue realizations through continuous government dialogue.25 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n20.  The overall procurement and financial management risk for the project is moderate.26  \nThe  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the  executing  and  implementing \nagencies can conduct adequate project financial management. A significant strength of the \nexecuting and implementing agencies is their considerable experience in handling externally \nfunded  projects  with  substantial  values.  The  executing  agency  and  most  of  the  proposed \nimplementing agencies implemented the first project satisfactorily in terms of (i) timely receipt of \nproject funds, including counterpart funds; (ii) efficient project management with adequate staff; \nand  (iii)  prompt  funds  disbursement  to  contractors  and  consultants.  The  executing  and \nimplementing agencies have an established legal, institutional, and monitoring framework for \nbudgeting, accounting, and auditing. Risk mitigation measures include (i) securing government \ncommitment to ensure timely establishment of project implementation units (PIUs) with qualified \nstaff, (ii) extending training and skill development support for financial management capacity of \nnewly assigned PMCU and PIUs staff, and (iii) strengthening the accounts section of project \nmunicipalities by engaging qualified staff for timely preparation of budget and financial reports. \nClose monitoring and resolution of capacity gaps will be implemented with the support of the \nloan consultants. \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \n                                                \n24 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Project Procurement Risk Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n22.  Poverty. The country\u2019s population living below the poverty line is estimated to have \ndropped 7% from 2010 to 2016, but the proportion of poor people continues to be high at almost \n25%  in  2016.27  The  number  of  urban  poor  people  is  growing  as  job  opportunities  attract \nmigrants from rural areas, resulting in the growth of slums with inadequate urban infrastructure \nand poor quality of life. The improved roads will provide safer and more pedestrian-friendly \nconditions and enable better access to basic services, such as health care and education, and \nto workplaces. The improved roads, drains, and solid waste management will improve quality of \nlife for all, including the poor communities in the project area. The project recognizes the \nimportance of stakeholder participation, including civil society, women, and poor groups, and will \ninclude community consultation as well as community awareness activities.28 \n \n23.  Gender.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Budget  for \nimplementation  and  monitoring  of the  gender action  plan (GAP)  is  included  in  the  project \ncosts.29 Experience with the first project has resulted in specific activities that will directly benefit \npoor women through job generation and skills development. For example, the project will use \nconstruction techniques that will enable women to comprise at least 20% of unskilled workers. \nThrough  community-based  organizations,  women  will  be  encouraged  to  become  actively \ninvolved in decision-making under the project outputs. Female staff and community facilitators \nwill be trained to collect sex-disaggregated data from construction sites as input to a sex-\ndisaggregated geospatial database to manage and track the GAP. The PMCU will have a full-\ntime social development expert to monitor timely and effective GAP implementation and prepare \nquarterly progress reports to be submitted to ADB. GAP implementation will be evaluated as \npart of benefit monitoring at project completion. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n24.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.30 \n \n25.  Environment  (category  B).  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework \n(EARF) was prepared and disclosed on the ADB website following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) and government\u2019s environmental regulations. The EARF provides guidance \non subproject selection, screening and categorization, information disclosure and consultation, \nassessment,  planning,  institutional  arrangement,  and  processes  to  be  followed  in  the \nformulation  and  implementation  of  subprojects.  The  project  will  not  include  subprojects \ntriggering  category  A  per  the  EARF. Three  sample  subprojects  were appraised  and  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) reports were prepared in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) and the EARF.31 The IEEs and information on the subprojects indicate that \nthe subprojects are located on existing rights-of-way and government-owned lands, and there \n                                                \n27 Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Planning, Statistics and Informatics Division, Bangladesh Bureau  of \nStatistics. 2017.

The potential impacts, such as \nconstruction vibration affecting the structural integrity of properties, road safety issues, and safe \ndisposal of excavated materials, are site-specific; few are irreversible and most can be readily \nmitigated  and  minimized  using  proven  mitigation  measures  and  environmentally  sound \nengineering  and  construction  practices  consistent  with  international  good  practice.32 \nStakeholders were involved through meaningful consultations and their views were fed into the \nIEEs  and  subproject  designs.  The  consultation  process  will  continue  during  project \nimplementation to maintain full engagement with stakeholders. The IEEs and environmental \nmanagement plans will form part of the bid and contract documents. All draft IEEs will be \nupdated based on the detailed design, and works cannot start until ADB reviews and approves \nthe final IEEs, which will be disclosed on the ADB, PMCU, and PIU websites; and to the \naffected people. The PAM includes a grievance redress mechanism (footnote 18). The PMCU is \ncommitted and has the capacity to carry out the requirements of the EARF and IEEs, and the \nproject includes sufficient PMCU and PIU safeguards staff and consultant support to ensure \nsatisfactory environmental compliance to meet Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. \n \n26.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). To guide subproject preparation, the PMCU \nprepared a resettlement framework in line with the Safeguard Policy Statement and government \npolicies, a resettlement plan, and three due diligence reports for the sample subprojects.33 The \nresettlement plan addresses the impacts identified through appropriate mitigation measures and \nPMCU  and  PIUs  conducted  meaningful  stakeholder  consultations  for  its  preparation.  The \ngrievance redress mechanism will address issues and grievances timely and effectively. The \nPMCU is committed to and can carry out the requirements of the resettlement framework and \nthe resettlement plan, as demonstrated in the first project, and will submit semiannual social \nsafeguard  monitoring  reports  to  ADB.  PMCU  safeguards  staff  will  be  supported  by  loan \nconsultants in monitoring safeguard compliance. The project will not include any subproject with \ncategory A for involuntary resettlement. \n \n27.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The subproject sites and alignments in the highly \nurbanized Dhaka and Khulna city regions are not located in the Madhupur area of Dhaka \ndivision and Sundarbans area of Khulna division, areas where small ethnic communities are \nconcentrated.  Transect  walks  through  subproject  sites  and  alignments  do  not  reveal  the \npresence  of  small  ethnic  communities,  such  as  adibashi  (tribal)  communities,  pahari  (hill) \ncommunities,  and  forest  communities,  at  these  locations.  The  project  will  not  include  any \nsubproject with any impact on small ethnic communities. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n28.
