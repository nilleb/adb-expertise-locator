An initial environmental examination was undertaken. \n\n \nThe Project follows a sector lending approach and supports sector \npolicies on urban development, including the Government\u2019s Action \nPlan  for  2004\u20132008  and  program  to  provide  40,000  households \nwith  opportunities  to live  in  housing with  improved  basic services. \nThe Project will consist of four components: (i) A: improvement of \nbasic urban services, (ii) B: urban road improvement, (iii) C: small \nloans for water connections and on-plot facility improvements, and \n(iv) D: institutional development and training. \n \nProject  implementation  will  start  with  two  core  subprojects: \n(i) improvement  of  the  Hailaast  road  section  in  Ulaanbaatar;  and \n(ii)  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  management  in \nErdenet.  The  remaining  subprojects  will  be \nidentified  and \nformulated  during  project  implementation  in  accordance  with \nrigorous  procedures  for  screening,  identification,  selection,  and \nappraisal of the subprojects. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nreviewed  the  two  core  subprojects  and  found  that  they  are  viable \nfrom  a  technical,  institutional,  social,  financial,  economic,  and \nenvironmental perspective. For each of the remaining subprojects, \nthe  Ulaanbaatar  municipal  government  and  concerned  aimag \n(province)  governments  and  public  urban  services  organizations \n(PUSOs)  will  prepare  a  feasibility  study,  including  a  resettlement \nplan  and  environmental  impact  assessment.  For  the  water  supply \nsubcomponent,  concerned  aimag  governments  will  be  required  to \nindicate strong political commitment to implement the tariff reforms \nto ensure repayment to the Government.  \n \nMongolia experienced rapid urbanization during the second half of \nthe  20th  century,  mainly  because  of  rural-to-urban  migration.  The \nurban  population  is  now  60%  of  the  national  population  of \n2.56 million.  Urban  areas  in  Mongolia  present  two  very  different \nand  distinct  patterns  of  residential  accommodation:  apartment \nareas and ger (traditional tent) areas. Apartment areas are formally \nlaid out to include permanent housing based on socialist planning \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fthe \n\nlives \n\nin  ger  areas. \n\ntotal  population \n\nfeaturing  multi-family  housing  surrounded  by \npractices  and \n(vaguely defined) open space. These areas have the benefit of full \nutility  services,  including  heating  and  hot  water.  By  contrast,  ger \nareas  are  typically  long strips  of  large,  unserviced  plots  with  wide \nunpaved roads on one or two sides. Both types of layout are found \nin  virtually  all  of  the  country\u2019s  urban  settlements.  Following  the \nwithdrawal  of  Soviet  support  at  the  start  of  the  1990s,  there  has \nbeen  relatively  little  extension  of  apartment  areas  but  ger  areas \nhave  experienced  continued  growth  in  most  cities  as  most  in-\nmigrants live in ger areas. \n \nUrban  areas  in  Ulaanbaatar  are  growing  rapidly  because  of \nsubstantial  population  migration  from  rural  areas.  The  total \npopulation in Ulaanbaatar is estimated at over  1 million, including \nabout 80,000 students and 60,000 non-registered residents. Some \n60%  of \nIn  2004, \nUlaanbaatar\u2019s  road  network  totaled  about  376  kilometers  (km), \ncomprising  77  km  (20.5%)  of  national  roads,  190  km  (50.5%)  of \ncity roads, and 109 km (29.0%) of district or municipal roads. Road \nconstruction has been increasing slowly by 1.2% per annum for the \npast  5  years.  Most  roads  in  Ulaanbaatar  are  poorly  maintained \nasphalt or gravel roads. About 288 km of roads in the city need to \nbe reconstructed or rehabilitated. Only 10% of the city roads have \ndrainage systems, which often are clogged with trash. \n \nThe major issues in the urban development sector in Mongolia are \n(i)  deficiency  in  the  quality  of  urban  infrastructure  and  services, \nespecially  in  ger  areas;  (ii)  lack  of  community  participation  in  the \nmanagement  and  operation  of  urban  services;  (iii)  lack  of  cost \nrecovery and inadequate financial management in public services; \n(iv)  lack  of  financial  and  organizational  autonomy  of  the  PUSOs; \n(v)  lack  of  capacity  of  local  governments,  through  the  PUSOs,  to \nfacilities; \nprovide  and  operate  urban \n(vi) reluctance  of  the  Government  to  acknowledge  the  permanent \nstatus of gers or hashaas (residential plots); (vii) inadequate urban \nroads in Ulaanbaatar; (viii) poor management and maintenance of \nurban  roads  in  Ulaanbaatar;  and  (ix)  health  problems  and \nassociated economic loss. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  living  conditions  and \nquality of life of the urban population, especially in ger areas. The \noutcome  of  the  Project  will  be  upgraded  basic  urban  services, \nurban roads, and on-plot facilities. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $37.6  million \nequivalent, including taxes and duties of $2.6 million. \n \n\ninfrastructure  and \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\n($ million) \n \n\nSource \n\nTotal  \n\nPercent \n\nvii \n\n75.0 \n13.0 \n0.8 \n5.6 \n3.2 \n0.5 \n1.9 \n100.0 \n\nA.

The  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. \n \nThe  major  portion  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  relent  by  the \nBorrower,  through  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  to  the  participating \naimag governments and Ulaanbaatar municipal government under \nsubsidiary  loan  agreements  (SLAs)  based  on  the  size  of  the \nsubprojects  under  components  A  and  B.  Aimag  governments  will \nenter  into  onlending  agreements  (OLAs)  with  the  respective \nPUSOs. SLAs and OLAs will carry an interest rate of ADB rate not \nexceeding  3.25  (1.50%  plus  1.75%)  per  annum,  a  repayment \nperiod of 22 years including a 6-year grace period. For component \nC, the Borrower, through the Ministry of Finance, will relend funds \nto participating financial institutions (PFIs) under a series of SLAs. \nThe SLAs to the PFIs will carry an interest rate determined on cost \nof  the  loan,  foreign  exchange  and  interest  variation  risks  and  the \nProject  pro-poor  objective  and  affordability  of \nthe  poor \nsubborrowers.  The  PFIs  will  onlend  the  loan  proceeds  to  the \nsubborrowers on the terms of an interest rate not exceeding 10% \nper  annum  a  repayment  period  of  two  to  ten  years  including  a \ngrace period of one year. \n \nUntil 30 June 2013 \n \n31 December 2012 \n\n \nA project steering committee chaired by the state secretary of the \nMinistry  of  Construction  and  Urban  Development  will  be \nresponsible for project coordination and providing policy guidance \nduring  implementation.  A  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will \nserve as the secretariat of the project steering committee and will \nbe  responsible  for  coordinating  the  implementation  of  project \nactivities.  A  working  group  will  be  established  to  stimulate \nparticipation  of  the  principal  stakeholders  for  each  subproject.

Major  contracts  for \nequipment  and  materials  will  be  tendered  through  international \ncompetitive  bidding,  national  competitive  bidding,  or  shopping \nprocedures,  depending  on  the  contract  amount.  Civil  works \ncontracts  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding  or \ninternational  competitive  bidding. \nIn  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines,  foreign  contractors  may  participate  in \nbidding for local competitive bidding contracts. \n \nThe  Project  will  require  about  195  person-months  of  international \nand  82  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  to  support \nthe PMU and PIUs in project implementation and management, the \nfeasibility  study  for  the  urban  road  improvement  component, \ndetailed  design  and  survey, \ninstitutional  development,  and \neducation  and  training.  The  ADB  loan  will  finance  31  person-\ninternational  and  82  person-months  of  national \nmonths  of \nconsultants.  The  international  consultants  will  have  expertise  in \nfinance  and \n(i) project  management  and  procurement, \nmicrofinance, \nfinancial \nmanagement,  and  (iv)  sanitation.  The  national  consultants  will \nhave  expertise  in  (i)  resettlement;  (ii)  environment;  (iii)  legal \naspects;  (iv)  database  development;  (v)  financial  management; \nand  (vi)  construction  supervision, \nthe \nremaining subprojects under component B, and detailed designs of \ncomponents  A  and  B.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (April  2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All \ninternational  consultants  and  the  national  consultants  for  project \nmanagement will be selected and contracted individually. National \nconsultants  for  feasibility  studies  and  detailed  designs  will  be \nselected  and  contracted  as  firms  using  ADB\u2019s  quality  and  cost-\nbased  selection  procedure  among  short-listed  national  consulting \nfirms.  German  development  cooperation  through  the  German \nDevelopment  Service  (DED)  will  provide  144 person-months  of \nlong-term \nin  community  engineering  (2 \npositions)  and  community  development  and  training.  German \ndevelopment  cooperation \nfor \nthrough \nTechnical  Cooperation \n(GTZ)  will  provide  a  maximum  of \n20 person-months  of  short-term  experts.  These  experts  will  be \nassigned  at  the  PMU  and  PIUs,  and  guided  by  and  report  to  the \nrespective PMU and PIU directors.

The  Project  will  provide  or  upgrade \ninfrastructure,  but  will  simultaneously  (i)  increase  access  to  small \nloans  for  households  and  neighborhood  improvements,  (ii)  create \ndirect  short-term  employment  for  construction  and  indirect  long-\nterm  income  opportunities,  and  (iii)  empower  poor  residents  in \ndecision-making  processes \nthe  establishment  of \ncommunity-based organizations to plan and implement community \ninfrastructure  improvements.  The  Project  will  have  positive  health \nbenefits. Residents are expected to experience a reduction in the \nincidence  of  water-  and  vector-borne  diseases\u2014related  to  unsafe \ndrinking  water  and  poor  sanitation\u2014as  well  as  medical  costs  and \nlost  earnings  incurred  as  a  result  of  these  diseases.  Community \nparticipation  is  at  the  core  of  the  project  design.  During  project \npreparation,  local  communities  were  extensively  involved  in  the \ndesign of the Project through a series of public consultation, focus \ngroup discussion, and surveys. The formation and participation of \ncommunity-based  organizations  in  the  Project  will  be  essential  in \nachieving the outputs of the Project. Nongovernment organizations \nwill  play  a  facilitating  role  in  the  mobilization  of  communities  and \nformation  of  community-based  organizations.  Capacity  building \nand  training  needs  will  also  be  identified  and  where  appropriate, \ntraining will be conducted by nongovernment organizations. \n \nThe  Project  will  greatly  improve  community  health  and  living \nconditions  and  reduce  environmental  pollution.  On  a  per  capita \nbasis, the Project will decrease the demands on energy resources \nby replacing truck water tankers with a piped system. The adoption \nof  composting  toilets  will  reduce  groundwater  pollution  and,  with \ncorrect  management,  will  produce  organic  compost  for  small \nfarmers. \n \nTwo potential risks have been identified. The first is the possibility \nof  delays  in  the  formulation  of  the  remaining  subprojects  and \nproject implementation caused by weak institutional capacity of the \nPIUs. Considerable preparatory work has been undertaken for the \nsubprojects,  and  institutional  development  for  the  PIUs  will  be \nprovided  during  project  implementation  to  mitigate  this  risk.  The \nsecond  risk  is  the  possibility  of  delays  in  undertaking  operational \nimprovements  along  with  revision  of  the  tariff  structure  for  water \nsupply  and  wastewater  collection.  To  facilitate  tariff  collection \nbased  on  the  proposed  tariff  structure,  a  substantial  number  of \nwater  meters  will  be  installed  under  the  Project  for  apartment \ndwellers,  public  and  private  organizations,  ger  area  water  kiosks, \nand ger area households when they are connected. In addition, the \nproject management consultants will assist the aimag governments \nin institutionalizing the tariff review process and conducting regular \ntariff reviews. \n \nAssumptions  include  (i)  the  Government  will  remain  committed  to \nimplement  the  Project,  (ii)  ger  area  communities  and  local  banks \n\n \n\nix \n\n \n\n\fand  non-banking  financial  institutions  are  willing  to  participate  in \nthe Project, (iii) ger area households are able and willing to save in \norder  to  establish  creditworthiness  and/or  develop  collateral  for \nsmall  loans,  and  (iv)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be \nimplemented in a timely matter. \n\nx \n\n \n\n\f96  00'Eo\n\no\n111  00'E\n\nR  U  S  S  I  A  N        F  E  D  E  R  A  T  I  O  N\n\nMONGOLIA\nURBAN DEVELOPMENT SECTOR PROJECT\n\n50  00'No\n\nUlaangom\n\nUVS\n\nTsengel\n\nNogoonnuur\n\nNaranbulag\n\nTes\n\nDayan\n\nBAYAN-\nOLGIY\n\nOlgiy\n\nOlgiy\n\nTudevtey\n\nHovd\n\nZAVHAN\n\nTsagaan-Uul\n\nMoron\n\nBULGAN\n\nSuhbaatar\n\nHutag-Ondor\n\nSelenge\n\nErdenet\n\nBulgan\n\nORHON\n\nSumber\n\nAltanbulag\n\nSELENGE\nDarhan\n\nDARHAN-UUL\n\nHanh\n\nHatgal\n\nHOVSGOL\n\nEreentsav\n\nBayan-Uul\n\nDORNOD\n\nHavirga\n\nManhan\n\nDariv\n\nHOVD\n\nUyench\n\nYarantay\n\nTayshir\n\nTsahir\n\nUliastay\n\nARHANGAY\n\nHishig Ondor\n\nBattsengel\n\nTsetserleg\n\nHarhorin\n\nAltay\n\nBayanhongor\n\nTogrog\n\nBuutsagaan\n\nArvayheer\n\nGOVI-ALTAY\n\nNariynteel\nOVORHANGAY\n\nBurgastay\n\nBAYANHONGOR\n\nULAANBAATAR\n\nHENTIY\n\nChoybalsan\n\nLun\n\nULAANBAATAR\n\nBatnorov\n\nTOV\nZuunmod\n\nBaganuur\n\nNalayh\n\nMaanit\n\nOndorhaan\n\nMonhhaan\n\nMatad\n\nTamsagbulag\n\nGOVISUMBER\n\nBaruun-Urt\n\nChoyr\n\nErdenetsagaan\n\nBichigt\n\nSUHBAATAR\n\nMandalgovi\n\nDUNDGOVI\n\nTsogt-Ovoo\n\nDORNOGOVI\n\nSaynshand\n\nZamyn-Uud\n\nDalanzadgad\n\nOMNOGOVI\n\nBayan-Ovoo\n\nGashuun Suhayt\n\n50  00'No\n\n42  00'No\n\nMONGOLIA\n\n42  00'No\n\nN\n\n0\n\n50 100\n\n150\n\n200 250\n\nKilometers\n\n0\n6\n-\n2\n5\n0\n7\n \nH\nR\n\n96  00'Eo\n\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA \n\nProject Town\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nMain Road\n\nProvincial Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\no\n111  00'E\n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nMongolia  for  the  Urban  Development  Sector  Project  (the  Project).  The  Project  will  help  Mongolia \nachieve the Millennium  Development Goals of environmental sustainability and increased access \nto  safe  drinking  water  and  basic  sanitation.  This  report  is  based  on  the  findings  of  the  loan \nAppraisal Mission and discussions with the central and local governments, relevant agencies, and \ncommunity organizations. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nMongolia  experienced  rapid  urbanization  during  the  second  half  of  the  20th  century.  This \n2. \ntrend  accelerated  during  the  transition  from  central  planning  to  a  market-based  economy.  The \nurban population is about 1.54 million, equivalent to 60% of the national population of 2.56 million. \nThe  urban  population  is  growing  by  about  2.4%  annually  while  total  annual  population  growth  is \nabout 1.4%. Urbanization is mainly due to rural-to-urban migration.  \n \n3. \nUrban  areas  in  Mongolia  present  two  very  different  and  distinct  patterns  of  residential \naccommodation:  apartment  areas  and  ger  (traditional  tent)  areas.  Apartment  areas  are  formally \nlaid out to include permanent housing based on socialist planning practices, featuring multi-family \nhousing  surrounded  by  (vaguely  defined)  open  space.  These  areas  have  the  benefit  of  full  utility \nservices, including heating and hot water. By contrast, ger areas are typically long strips of large, \nunserviced plots with wide unpaved roads on one or two sides. Both types of layout are found in \nvirtually  all  of  the  country\u2019s  urban  settlements.  Following  the  withdrawal  of  Soviet  support  at  the \nstart of the 1990s, there has been relatively little extension of apartment areas, but growth of ger \nareas has continued in most cities since most in-migrants live in ger areas. \n \nThe result is a growing disparity in the proportion of population benefiting from basic urban \n4. \ninfrastructure. Water is mostly trucked into ger areas and supplied through sales kiosks located up \nto 1 kilometer (km) or more from the farthest households. Water use is limited by having to carry \nwater over long distances and difficult terrain, often in adverse weather conditions. Consequently, \nthe average quantity of water used by ger area residents is typically 4\u201310 liters per capita per day. \nMoreover,  the  cost  of  water  obtained  from  sales  kiosks  is  up  to  20  times  more  than  that  paid  by \napartment  dwellers  for  piped  central  supply.  For  sanitation,  virtually  all  ger  area  households  use \nbasic pit latrines that are inconvenient and a growing hazard to human and environmental health. \nOver 70% of ger area households lack access to solid waste removal points.  \n \n5. \nUrban areas in Ulaanbaatar are growing rapidly because of substantial population migration \nfrom rural areas. The total population in Ulaanbaatar is estimated at over 1 million, including about \n80,000 students and 60,000 non-registered residents. Some 60% of the total population lives in ger \nareas.  In  2004,  Ulaanbaatar\u2019s  road  network  totaled  about  380  km,  comprising  77  km  (22.4%)  of \nnational  roads,  190  km  (50.5%)  of  city  roads,  and  109  km  (29.1%)  of  district  or  municipal  roads. \nRoad construction has been increasing slowly by 1.2% per annum for the past 5 years. Most of the \nroads in Ulaanbaatar are poorly maintained asphalt or gravel roads. About 288 km of roads in the \ncity need to be reconstructed or rehabilitated. Only 10% of the city roads have drainage systems, \nwhich often are clogged with trash.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n6. \nThe  major  issues  in  the  urban  development  sector  in  Mongolia  are  (i)  deficiency  in  the \nquality  of  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  especially  in  ger  areas;  (ii)  lack  of  community \nparticipation  in  the  management  and  operation  of  urban  services;  (iii)  lack  of  cost  recovery  and \ninadequate  financial  management  of  public  services;  (iv)  lack  of  financial  and  organizational \nautonomy  of  the  public  urban  services  organizations  (PUSOs);  (v)  lack  of  capacity  of  local \ngovernments,  through  the  PUSOs,  to  provide  and  operate  urban  infrastructure  and  facilities; \n(vi) reluctance  of  the  Government  to  acknowledge  the  permanent  status  of  gers  or  hashaas \n(residential plots); (vii) inadequate urban road infrastructure facilities and services in Ulaanbaatar; \n(viii) poor management and maintenance of urban roads in Ulaanbaatar; and (ix) health problems \nand  associated  economic  loss.  The  Government  has  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  to  provide  assistance  to  achieve  Goal  71 and  Target  102 of  the  Millennium  Development \nGoals. \n \n \n\nKey Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\n7. \nThe  Project  addresses  the  growing  concern  for  the  effects  of  population  and  economic \ngrowth  on  the  inadequacy  of  public  services  in  the  aimag  (provincial)  centers,  particularly  ger \nareas.  Continuing  urbanization  has  resulted  in  increasing  water  shortage  as  well  as  major \ndeficiencies  in  other  urban  services.  The  1995  medium-term  strategy  was  the  first  important \nstatement  on  urban  development  in  Mongolia  which  recognized  that  the  Government  does  not \nhave the necessary resources to replace the growing number of ger area houses with subsidized \napartments.  The  Government\u2019s  2003  Strategy  for  Economic  Growth  Support  and  Poverty \nReduction called for reducing disparities in living conditions, and creating an enabling environment \nto support small and medium-sized enterprise development for both urban and rural settlements. \n \n8. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Action  Plan  for  2004\u20132008  has  prescribed  upgrading  the  quality  of \npublic services by (i) strengthening the capacity and accountability of public service institutions and \ncivil  servants;  (ii)  expanding  civil  participation  at  all  levels  of  decision  making;  (iii)  ensuring \ntransparency;  (iv)  conducting  social  policy  to  improve  living  standards;  (v)  providing  a  favorable \nlegal environment, adequate infrastructure, and financial environment to accumulate savings, and \nto  own,  possess,  and  dispose  of  immovable  property  such  as  land  and  houses;  (vi)  intensifying \nresidential  construction  based  on  standards;  and  (vii)  reducing  harmful  waste  and  providing \necological  education  to  residents.  Within  the  framework  of  this  action  plan,  the  Government  has \ndeveloped a program to provide 40,000 families with opportunities to live in housing with improved \nbasic services (the 40,000 Houses Program). The Government has developed a series of plans to \nachieve  its  urban  development  objectives,  estimated  at  a  total  of  about  MNT50  billion  for  2006\u2013\n2009. The Government\u2019s urban development sector policy and investment plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nThe Executing Agency for the Project, the Ministry of Construction and Urban Development \n9. \n(MCUD),  has  significant  experience  gained  from  the  implementation  of  ADB-funded  projects \n(Provincial Towns  Basic  Urban  Services  and  Integrated  Development  of  Basic  Urban  Services  in \nProvincial Towns Project)3 and has the technical, financial, and managerial capability to implement \nthe  Project (para.  20). Management  of  the  project  facilities  will  be  delegated  to  the  implementing \n\n                                                 \n1   Ensure environmental sustainability. \n2   Halve,  by  2015,  the  proportion  of  people  without  sustainable  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and  basic  sanitation. \n\nMongolia\u2019s total water supply and sanitation coverage was 62% and 59% in 2002. \n\n3   ADB.  1997.

MCUD  is  equipped  to  provide  the  necessary \ncapacity  building  programs  for  the  aimag  governments  and  PUSOs.  UMG  has  the  technical, \nfinancial,  and  managerial  capacity  to  implement  the  urban  road  improvement  component  of  the \nProject. MCUD currently satisfies ADB\u2019s financial management requirements and has the financial \nmanagement  capability  to  satisfactorily  record  all  transactions  and  balances,  support  the \npreparation  of  regular  and  reliable  financial  statements  and  financial  monitoring  reports,  and \narrange for annual audits to be carried out in a manner acceptable to ADB. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Rationale \n\n10. \nThe  Project  will  initially  focus  on  Ulaanbaatar  and  Erdenet,  the  country\u2019s  two  large  and \nrapidly growing urban centers. Subsequently, consideration will be given to relatively small towns \nor  aimag  centers.  The  Project  will  focus  on  providing  improved  urban  services  for  growing \npopulation  in  the  large  urban  centers.  At  the  same  time,  it  will  selectively  provide  support  for \nimproving  living  conditions  in  the  smaller  towns,  which  would  attract  rural  people  and  thus \ncontribute to reduce further migration to the large urban centers. \n \n11. \nThe  1999  Ulaanbaatar  Road  Master  Plan  Study  financed  by  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency (JICA)4 set out a road development master plan up to 2020. The master plan \nrecommends  major  improvements  to  the  capital  city\u2019s  road  network,  road  maintenance  system, \ntraffic circulation system, public transport services, and institutional strengthening. The master plan \nused a population figure of 925,000 for 2020 and motor vehicle population levels significantly lower \nthan  current  levels.  The  urban  road  improvement  component  under  the  Project  is  expected  to \ncontribute to improving access within the city, in particular for ger areas. Selection and design of \nthe  road  sections  will  be  determined  in  close  coordination  with  UMG,  considering  future  city \ndevelopment, to ensure compatibility with the updated master plan. \n \nADB has assisted the Government in developing a sustainable housing finance system in \n12. \nMongolia.5 However, access to such loans by low-income households is still limited. According to \nthe  demand  survey  conducted  as  part  of  the  poverty  and  social  analysis,  the  majority  of \nhouseholds  expressed  interest  in  taking  a  small  loan.  About  half  of  households  surveyed \nexpressed interest in using the loan for on-plot facility improvements. Those households that have \ntaken  loans  in  the  past  indicated  that  the  loans  were  primarily  used  for  income  generation  or \ngeneral  consumption.  Thus,  the  Project  is  expected  to  fill  a  gap  in  loan  demand  by  providing \naccess to small loans for low-income households in ger areas for on-plot facility improvements. \n \n \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n3. \n\n13. \nTariff  Policy  and  Reform.  The  Government  and  ADB  agree  that  tariff  reforms  for  water \nsupply are necessary to enable the PUSOs to be financially sustainable. The tariff reforms aim to: \n(i) reduce differences in tariffs between beneficiaries, (ii) achieve full cost recovery of operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) and depreciation, and (iii) establish a structured scheme to allow for minimum \nwater consumption to guarantee basic living standards for the poor. The Government supports the \ndecentralization  of  responsibility  for  tariff  setting  to  aimag  governments.  MCUD  will  request \nparticipating  aimag  governments  to  provide  MCUD  with  letters  that  indicate  their  commitment  to \nimplement  the  proposed  tariff  reforms  in  a  timely  manner,  and  enable  the  PUSOs  to  undertake \nmanagement and operational improvements. Further, the aimag governments will request Ministry \nof  Finance  (MOF)  to  allocate  the  required  tariff  increases  for  the  public  organizations.

Manila (Loan 1847-MON). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nparticipating aimag government will institutionalize a tariff review process and conduct regular tariff \nreviews.  The  Project  will  provide  education  and  training  for  local  communities  to  increase \nawareness and understanding on the need for tariff reforms. It is important that (i) water tariff for \nboth  ger  areas  and  apartment  areas,  including  institutions,  will  be  revised  to  a  parity  level  to \nrecover full cost; (ii) water meters will be installed in all apartment households, public and private \norganizations, water kiosks in ger areas, and ger area households when they are connected; and \n(iii)  the  aimag  government\u2019s  commitment  to  tariff  reform  will  be  included  in  the  subsidiary  loan \nagreement  (SLA)  between  the  Government  and  the  aimag  government.  In  particular,  the  Project \nwill  closely  monitor  implementation  of  the  tariff  reform  in  the  smaller  project  towns,  and  provide \nguidance to ensure timely implementation of the tariff reforms. \n \n14. \nCity  Master  Plans  and  Ger  Area  Development  Planning.  Preparation  and  updating  of \ncity  master  plans  is  under  the  responsibility  of  aimag  governments,  but  budget  limitations  often \nconstrain their timely production. The Government considers that planning for cities, including ger \nareas,  is  necessary.  To  ensure  that  ger  areas  do  not  continue  to  be  considered  temporary  in \nnature,  the  Government  has  adopted  a  structured  planning  approach  based  on  projected \npopulation, economic activities and employment forecast, land zoning and land use, and demand \nfor  infrastructure  support.  This  will  allow  infrastructure  investments  to  play  a  proactive  and \nfacilitating role rather than being delayed reactive measures. \n \nCommunity and Private Sector Participation. Government policy concerning community \n15. \nparticipation in urban development is still being formed. Community participation has been initiated \nunder  the  Project  through  the  social  survey  and  public  consultations  conducted  during  project \npreparation.  This  process  will  continue  and  a  feedback  mechanism  will  be  established  during \nproject  implementation.  Opportunities  for  private  sector  participation  exist  in  recycling  of  rejected \nmaterials such as fuel ash, metals, plastics, and glass. Community and private sector participation \nwill be supported by the proposed Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) project6 which will be \nimplemented in parallel with the Project. \n \n \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n4. \n\n16. \nADB  has  provided  support  for  the  urban  development  sector  since  1998  through  loan, \ntechnical  assistance  (TA),  and  grant  projects  for  improvements  to  basic  urban  services  in  the \nprovincial  capitals,  housing  finance,  living  environment  improvements  in  ger  areas,  cadastral \nsurvey and land registration, and regional development planning (footnotes 3 and 5).7 ADB is one \nof the main sources of external assistance for the sector. The World Bank is also a major source of \nassistance  in  this  sector.  It  has  worked  primarily  in  Ulaanbaatar  and  has  provided  two  loans  to \nupgrade basic urban services in ger areas there. The United Nations Development Programme is \nimplementing  a  grant  program  for  superinsulated,  energy  efficient  houses.  Among  bilateral \nagencies,  Germany \nin \nUlaanbaatar. Japan is developing a master plan for solid waste management in Ulaanbaatar and \nrehabilitating  the  water  source  of  Ulaanbaatar.  Australia,  France,  and  Sweden  are  also \nimplementing projects with urban implications. Donor coordination in the urban development sector \nhas  been  undertaken  during  project  preparation  through  seminars  and  workshops.  External \nassistance for urban development is described in Appendix 3. \n \n\nintegrated  urban  development  program,  mainly \n\nis  conducting  an \n\n                                                 \n6   Proposed  Grant  Assistance  to  Mongolia  for  Community-Driven  Development  for  Urban  Poor  in  Ger  Areas.

They  will  also  be  reflected  in  the \nengineering design of the project facilities and in institutional development programs.  \n \n18. \nThe Project will be the first sector loan project for urban development  in Mongolia. ADB\u2019s \nexperience in other countries indicates that sector loans tend to be implemented more slowly than \nproject  loans.  Lessons  learned  include  the  following:  (i)  subproject  formulation  needs  to  be \nundertaken  during  the  project  preparatory  stage  as  much  as  possible,  (ii)  simple  and  affordable \ntechnologies should be applied for construction and improvement of facilities, and (iii) institutional \ndevelopment and training need to be provided during project implementation. \n \n19. \nSmall  loans  operations  in  ger  areas  are  emerging  initiatives  in  Mongolia.  ADB  has  been \nsupporting  housing  finance  through  the  Housing  Finance  (Sector)  Project  (footnote  5)  and  the \nproject for Improving the Living Environment of the Poor in Ger Areas of Mongolia\u2019s Cities (footnote \n7).  Lessons  from  these  ongoing  projects  include  the  following:  (i)  a  sound  legal  and  regulatory \nenvironment  is  needed;  (ii) individual  savings  before  receiving  loans  help  facilitate  repayments;8 \nand (iii) careful vetting and selection of participating financial institutions, based on comprehensive \nselection criteria, is important. \n \n\n6. \n\nSector Loan Approach \n\n20. \nThe  Project  has  been  formulated  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  sector  policies  on  urban \ndevelopment,  including  the  Government\u2019s  Action  Plan  for  2004\u20132008  and  the  40,000  Houses \nProgram. MCUD has demonstrated its capacity to implement externally funded projects supported \nby  ADB  (footnotes  3,  5,  and  7).  ADB  has  also  provided  advisory  TA  to  help  MCUD  develop  a \nstrategy  for  the  urban  development  and  housing  sector, 9 which  helped  to  establish  the  policy \nfoundation  for  this  Project.  Based  on  its  experience  in  implementing  sector  activities,  including \nexternally  funded  projects,  MCUD  has  the  capacity  to  implement  the  sector  investment  plan. \nBuilding  on  MCUD\u2019s  established  implementation  capacity,  the  Project  will  provide  training  for \nrelevant  government  agencies  to  further  strengthen  their  capacities  to  plan  and  implement  the \nsector  policies  and  plans.  The  Government  meets  the  three  requirements  for  sector  lending: \n(i) appropriate  sector  policies,  (ii)  a  sector  investment  plan,  and  (iii)  the  institutional  capacity  to \nimplement the plan.  \n \nProject implementation will start with two core subprojects: (i) improvement of the Hailaast \n21. \nroad  section  in  Ulaanbaatar;  and  (ii)  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  management  in \nErdenet.  The  Erdenet  subproject  will  provide  (i)  improved  water  supply  for  about  6,600  ger  area \nhouseholds, (ii) piped water supply and sewerage for public institutions, (iii) improved solid waste \ncollection  and  disposal,  and  (iv)  small  loans  for  on-plot  facility  improvement  for  about  1,800  ger \narea  households.  The  Hailaast  subproject  will  upgrade  4.1  km  of  the  existing  road  in  ger  areas, \nincluding drainage to improve (i) public transportation from Hailaast ger areas to the city center in \nUlaanbaatar, and (ii) access to public services in Hailaast ger areas. The remaining subprojects will \nbe identified and formulated during project implementation in accordance with rigorous procedures \nfor  screening,  identification,  selection,  and  appraisal  of  the  subprojects  described  in  Appendix  4. \nADB  reviewed  the  two  core  subprojects  and  found  that  they  are  viable  from  a  technical, \ninstitutional, social, financial, economic, and environmental perspective. For each of the remaining \nsubprojects,  UMG  and  the  concerned  aimag  governments  and  PUSOs  will  prepare  a  feasibility \n                                                 \n8   Land privatization is being implemented, but not all households can use their land as collateral for a loan. \n9   ADB.  2005.

The  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  upgraded  basic  urban \nservices, urban roads, and on-plot facilities.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  Project  comprises  four  components:  (i)  A:  improvement  of  basic  urban  services, \n23. \n(ii) B: improvement  of  urban  roads,  (iii)  C:  small  loans  for  water  connections  and  on-plot  facility \nimprovements, and (iv) D: institutional development and training. \n \nComponent  A  will  rehabilitate  and/or  construct  basic  urban  infrastructure  in  the  project \n24. \ntowns  and  includes  subcomponents  for  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  management. \nThe water supply subcomponent will improve the centralized water supply systems. It will include \ninstallation  of  new  and  repair  of  existing  pumps  and  pipes,  development  of  new  boreholes  and \nreservoirs,  improved  control  of  bulk  water  supply,  and  expansion  of  distribution  networks  in  ger \nareas to connect existing and new water kiosks within 200 meters from the plots, and to provide \nconnection  boxes  for  future  individual  and  kiosk  connections.  The  sanitation  subcomponent  will \nrehabilitate  existing  pumps  and  pipelines,  improve  existing  wastewater  treatment  plants  and \ntreatment lagoons, and connect public institutions such as schools and hospitals in ger areas to the \ncentralized sewerage system. The solid waste management subcomponent will improve collection, \ntransportation, and disposal of domestic solid waste through the provision of solid waste collection \nand transport trucks and basic landfill management equipment.  \n \n25. \nComponent B will upgrade (i) existing unpaved roads that serve as the main access routes \nto ger areas and connect to the trunk roads to the city center, and (ii) street sections that hinder \nsmooth traffic flow because of poor pavement conditions caused by lack of proper maintenance. It \nwill  include  improvement  of  pavements;  construction  and  rehabilitation  of  drainage;  provision  of \nsurfaced sidewalks; and installation of streetlights, traffic signs, and road markings. Creation of a \nbetter  environment  for  pedestrians to  improve  road  safety and  smooth  movement  of  vehicles will \nbe considered during detailed design. \n \n26. \nComponent  C  will  make  loans  available  to  participating  financial  institutions  (PFIs) \n(nonbanking  financial  institutions  and  commercial  banks)  so  that  they  can  establish  small  loans \nfacilities to individuals and communities in ger areas. The individuals and communities will be the \nultimate beneficiaries of small loans. The loans will be made available for three types of individual \nand community investments. First, loans will be offered to enable individual households to connect \nto  the  piped  water  supply  system.  Second,  loans  will  be  made  available  to  purchase  and  install \nwater  meters  in  all  apartments  and  ger  area  households  when  they  are  connected.  Third,  small \nloans  will  be  offered  to  allow  individual  households  to  install  on-plot  or  decentralized  sanitation \nfacilities,  energy  efficient  stoves,  and  housing  improvements  (such  as  better  insulation)  and \nadditions  (such  as  bathrooms  and  extra  rooms).  Sanitation  facilities  will  include  septic  tanks, \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\ncompost  toilets,  and  other  innovative  solutions.  Interested  ger  area  households  can  select  from \namong  all  available  options  for  on-plot  sanitation.  Initial  eligibility  criteria  of  the  PFIs  and  lending \nmechanisms and conditions were established to ensure that poor households will not be excluded. \n \nComponent D will comprise three subcomponents. The project management subcomponent \n27. \nwill  support  increasing  the  efficiency  and  strengthening  the  capacity  of  implementing  agencies  in \nimplementing  the  Project.  The  institutional  reform  subcomponent  will  assist  the  PUSOs  to  (i)  be \nautonomous  and  financially  sustainable  operating  entities,  (ii)  implement  the  proposed  tariff \nreforms  and  operational  improvements,  and  (iii)  develop  sound  O&M  plans  for  future  service \nprovision.  This  subcomponent  will  also  assist  the  RD  of  UMG  to  (i)  develop  a  road  maintenance \nmaster  plan;  (ii)  develop  a  road  safety  strategy,  including  a  safety  audit  program;  (iii)  develop  a \ncomprehensive  traffic  management  and  control  strategy;  and  (iv)  update  the  1999  Ulaanbaatar \nroad  master  plan.  The  education  and  training  subcomponent  will  help  government  agencies  and \nlocal communities increase awareness of public health, environmental management, traffic safety, \nthe need for tariff reforms, and alternative technologies for urban infrastructure and services. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n28. \nThe Project will be the first ADB project to focus on comprehensive ger area development. \nPast and ongoing ADB support, including the Provincial Towns Basic Urban Services Project and \nIntegrated  Development  of  Basic  Urban  Services  in  Provincial  Towns  Project  (footnote  3), \nrenovated infrastructure that serves mainly apartment areas. This Project will focus on expanding \ninfrastructure networks into the surrounding ger areas. Further, the Project will improve access to \nfunds  for  ger  area  residents  to  construct  individual  water  connections  and  on-plot  facilities. \nOngoing  land  privatization  by  the  Government  and  infrastructure  upgrading  by  the  Project  is \nexpected  to  give  greater  incentives  to  ger  area  residents  to  further  invest  in  the  improvement  of \ntheir  individual  houses  and  neighborhood  environment.  In  urban  areas,  30%  of  the  population  is \npoor and 80\u201390% of the urban poor live in ger areas. Considering the high incidence of poverty in \nger areas, the Project is expected to contribute substantially to poverty reduction. \n \n29. \nThe  reduction  of  urban  waste  and  its  conversion  into  a  useful  and  potentially  marketable \nresource through ecologically sound, on-plot sanitation will be an important feature of the Project. It \nwill  potentially  contribute  to  improved  sanitation  techniques  through  eliminating  pit  latrines  and \npollution  of  groundwater,  reducing  the  infrastructure  burden  on  public  authorities,  and  turning \nhuman waste into a marketable commodity.10 This approach will be piloted first and expanded later \nwhen the approach is confirmed to be feasible. \n \n30. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  cooperation  and  coordination  with  other  external \nassistance agencies. German development cooperation through the German Development Service \n(DED) will provide grant parallel cofinancing for long-term experts to support the project activities. \nThe  experts  will  have  expertise  in  training  of  trainers  for  community  participation  and  in  practical \napplications  of \nimprovements.  German \ndevelopment  cooperation  through  the  German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation  (GTZ)  has \nagreed to work closely with ADB to coordinate and harmonize the approaches of the ADB project \nand the GTZ integrated urban development program. GTZ will also provide grant parallel cofinance \nfor short-term experts in community participation.  \n \n\nfor  service  and  housing \n\ntechnologies \n\nimproved \n\n                                                 \n10  This  issue  is  also  included  in  the  model  terms  of  reference  prepared  by  ADB  on  planning  urban  sanitation  and \n\nwastewater management. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n31. \nThe total project cost is estimated at $37.6 million equivalent. A summary of cost estimates \nis  in  Table  1.  The  cost  estimates  are  based  on  the  two  core  subprojects  in  Erdenet  and \nUlaanbaatar, and the other candidate subprojects at mid-2006 prices.  \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmountsa \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\nSubtotal (A1) \n\nComponent A: Improvement of basic urban services \nComponent B: Urban road improvement \nComponent C: Small loans for water connections and on-plot facilities \n \n\nItem \nA.

Aimag governments will enter into onlending agreements (OLAs) with \nthe respective PUSOs in the project towns to implement the subprojects under component A. The \nSLAs and subsequent OLAs will carry an interest rate not exceeding 3.25 (1.50% plus 1.75%) per \nannum. The term of the subsidiary loans to the aimag governments, PUSOs, and UMG will be 22 \nyears,  including  a  6-year  grace  period,  during  which  only  interest  payments  will  be  required.  For \ncomponent  C,  the  Borrower,  through  MOF,  will  relend  funds  to  the  PFIs  under  a  series  of  SLAs. \nThe SLAs to the PFIs will carry an interest rate determined on cost of the loan, foreign exchange \nand  interest  variation  risks  and  the  Project  pro-poor  objective  and  affordability  of  the  poor \nsubborrowers.  The  PFIs  will  onlend  the  loan  proceeds  to  the  subborrowers  on  the  terms  of  an \ninterest  rate  not  exceeding  10%  per  annum  a  repayment  period  of  two  to  ten  years  including  a \ngrace period of one year..11 The cost estimates do not include any additional investments made by \nindividual households and communities receiving loans through component C. It is expected that, \nin addition to the loans, both households and communities will invest significant amounts in cash, \nkind, and labor. Appendix 6 illustrates the flow of funds and onlending arrangements. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n34.  MCUD will be the Executing Agency for the Project. A PSC chaired by the state secretary of \nMCUD  will  be  responsible  for  project  coordination  and  will  provide  policy  guidance  during \nimplementation. The PSC will comprise representatives from MOF; MCUD; Ministry of Nature and \nEnvironment;  Ministry  of  Road,  Transport  and  Tourism;  National  Center  for  Construction,  Urban \nDevelopment,  and  Public  Utilities;  participating  aimag  governments;  and  UMG.  A  PMU  will  be \nestablished  under  MCUD  to  serve  as  the  secretariat  of  the  PSC  and  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating  the  implementation  of  project  activities.  The  PMU  will  (i)  ensure  adequate \ninterdepartmental cooperation and interagency coordination, (ii) monitor and report on the progress \nof project implementation, and (iii) coordinate communication with ADB and agencies concerned. \n \n35. \nThe participating aimag governments will be the Implementing Agency (IA) for component A \nand C, and UMG for component B. A working group will be established to stimulate participation of \nthe  principal  stakeholders  for  each  subproject.  The  working  group  will  be  led  by  the  aimag \ngovernor or the mayor of Ulaanbaatar. The working group for components A and C will comprise \n                                                 \n11  The Government is considering the same level of the relending rate to PFIs as the Improving the Living Environment of \n\nthe Poor in Ger Areas of Mongolia\u2019s Cities and the Housing Finance Sector Project (footnotes 5 and 7). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nrepresentatives from the aimag government, project implementation unit (PIU), PUSO, participating \ncommunity-based  organizations  (CBOs),  saving  groups,  and  PFIs.  Working  groups  for  the \nremaining  subprojects  will  be  established  as  part  of  each  subproject  preparation.  The  working \ngroup for component B will comprise representatives from the RD of UMG, PIU, and participating \ndistrict governments. A PIU will be established in each project town and Ulaanbaatar to coordinate \nthe preparation and development of subprojects under the general direction of the PMU. The PIUs \nwill  be  responsible  for  assisting  and  monitoring  the  PUSOs  and  the  RD  of  UMG  regarding  all \naspects  of  subproject  implementation  including  working  with  project  stakeholders,  maintaining \nsubproject  accounts,  clearing  environmental  examination,  implementing  resettlement,  monitoring \nsubproject  performance,  and  submitting  progress  reports.  All  staff  of  the  PMU  and  PIUs  will  be \nselected  and  contracted  individually  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. Detailed implementation arrangements are in Appendix 7. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years  from  2007  to  2012.  The  implementation \n\n36. \nschedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nThe  procurement  of  goods  and  works  financed  under  the  loan  will  be  undertaken  in \n37. \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (April  2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nInternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  will  be  applied  to  supply  contracts  estimated  to  cost \n$500,000 or more. Supply contracts with a value less than $500,000 will follow national competitive \nbidding  (NCB),  and  those  less  than  $100,000  will  follow  shopping  procedures  as  reflected  by \nparticular circumstances of the contract packages. ICB will be used for civil works contracts valued \nat $1 million or more. Civil works contracts valued less than $1 million will be procured using NCB \nprocedures. The selection and engagement of contractors will be subject to ADB approval. Before \ncommencement  of  NCB  procurement,  ADB  and  the  Borrower  will  review  the  Borrower\u2019s \nprocurement  procedures \nto  ensure  consistency  with  ADB  requirements.  Any  necessary \nmodifications or clarifications to the Borrower\u2019s procedures will be documented in the procurement \nplan. The internationally tendered equipment packages will include the necessary technical support \nfor ensuring proper installation, testing, commissioning, and training of operational staff as part of \nthe related contracts. In accordance with ADB requirements, foreign contractors may participate in \nbidding for NCB contracts. The procurement plan is in Appendix 9. \n \nBecause  of  the  severe  and  long  winters,  the  construction  season  in  Mongolia  is  short \n38. \n(April\u2013October).  ADB  approved  MCUD\u2019s  request  for  advance  contracting  for  procurement  and \nconsultants to expedite project implementation. Advance contracting for procurement will include: \n(i)  prequalification  of  contractors,  tendering,  and  bid  evaluation  for  civil  works  packages;  and \n(ii) preparation of tender documents to procure materials and equipment. Advance contracting for \nconsulting services will include short-listing of qualified consultants. MCUD also requested ADB for \nretroactive financing up to $500,000 equivalent for expenditures incurred in establishing the PMU. \nAll eligible expenditures should have been incurred no earlier than 12 months before the signing of \nthe loan agreement. The issuance of invitations to bid or to prequalify under advance contracting \nand retroactive financing will be subject to ADB approval. All advance contracting and retroactive \nfinancing will be undertaken in conformity with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). The Government was advised \nthat approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the \nProject. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n39. \nThe Project will require a total of about 195 person-months of international and 82 person-\nmonths of national consulting services to support the PMU and PIUs in project implementation and \nmanagement,  feasibility  study  for  the  urban  road  improvement  component,  detailed  design  and \nsurvey,  institutional  development,  and  education  and  training.  The  ADB  loan  will  finance \n31 person-months of international and 82 person-months of national consultants. The international \nconsultants  will  have  expertise  in  (i)  project  management  and  procurement,  (ii)  finance  and \nmicrofinance,  (iii)  institutional  development  and  financial  management,  and  (iv)  sanitation.  The \nnational  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  (i)  resettlement;  (ii)  environment;  (iii)  legal  aspects; \n(iv) database development; (v) financial management; and (vi) construction supervision, feasibility \nstudies for the remaining subprojects under component B, and detailed designs of components A \nand B. The consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (April  2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  international  consultants  and \nthe  national  consultants  for  project  management  will  be  selected  and  contracted  individually. \nNational consultants for feasibility studies and detailed designs will be selected and contracted as \nfirms  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedure  among  short-listed  national \nconsulting  firms.  German  development  cooperation  through  DED  will  provide  144 person-months \nof  long-term  international  experts  in  community  engineering  (2  positions)  and  community \ndevelopment and training. German development cooperation through GTZ will provide a maximum \nof  20  person-months  of  short-term  experts.  These  experts  will  be  assigned  at  the  PMU  and  the \nPIUs, and will be guided by and report to the respective PMU and PIU directors. DED and GTZ will \nselect these experts in accordance with their own guidelines. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n40. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government  and \nMCUD.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions \nof ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for \nthe Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include \nprovisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  MCUD; \nIAs;  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the \nProject.  Good  governance  in  selecting  subprojects  will  also  be  ensured  by  well-defined  and \ncarefully  monitored  selection  criteria  and  process.  For  the  Project,  MCUD  will  undertake  the \nfollowing anticorruption actions: (i) introduce a dual-signing system in which the civil works contract \nwinner  also  signs  an  anticorruption  contract  with  the  employer,  and  (ii)  periodically  inspect  the \ncontractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n41. \nThe loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2001). \nTo expedite project implementation through timely release of loan proceeds, the PMU will establish \ntwo  imprest  accounts  for  components  A,  C,  and  D,  and  for  component  B  promptly  after  loan \neffectiveness at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. Disbursements from the imprest account \nwill  be  supported  by  an  appropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related  documentation.  Such \ndocumentation  will  demonstrate,  among  other  things,  that  the  goods  and/or  services  are \n(i) procured from ADB\u2019s member countries, and (ii) eligible for ADB financing. The initial amount to \nbe  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  the  estimated  expenditures  for  the  next \n6 months,  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures \nprocedure may be used to reimburse, liquidate, or replenish eligible expenditures. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n42. \nThe Government, through the PMU and PIUs, will: (i) maintain separate financial accounts \nfor  the  Project,  and  (ii)  have  such  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited  annually  by \nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement \nand  as  specified  in  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Reporting  and  Auditing  of  Projects  Financed  by  the  Bank.12 \nThe  auditors  should  have  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference  acceptable  to  ADB. \nThe use of the imprest accounts and statement of expenditures will also be part of the annual audit \nand a separate audit opinion will be submitted. The Government will submit to ADB certified copies \n(in English) of such audited accounts and financial statements, and the related reports and auditors, \nwithin 6 months after the close of each fiscal year. \n \n43. \nFor  the  purpose  of  complying  with  the  requirements  for  the  annual  audited  financial \nstatements,  the  proceeds  of  this  loan  may  be  used  to  finance  expenditures  for  private  financial \nstatements, sector auditors, and translations of auditor\u2019s reports into English. The PMU will submit \nconsolidated quarterly progress reports to ADB (in English) and to the Government on all aspects \nof  project  implementation.  The  reports  will  include  details  on  overall  implementation  progress, \nproblems  encountered  during  the  reporting  period,  measures  taken  or  proposed  to  be  taken  to \nremedy  these  problems,  and  the  proposed  program  of  activities  for  the  following  quarter.  Within \n3 months of project completion, the PMU will prepare and submit to ADB, in a format acceptable to \nADB, a project completion report on (i) the utilization and impact of the loan; (ii) performance of the \nProject; (iii) economic and social benefits generated; and (iv) details about implementation, costs, \nresettlement, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n44. \nThe  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  will  focus  on  targets  and  indicators \nidentified  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  including  (i)  public  satisfaction  with  the \nneighborhood  environment;  (ii)  relevant  economic  and  health  data  to  monitor  project  impacts; \n(iii) number of households served by the improved water supply; (iv) number of public institutions \nserved by the improved water supply and sewerage; (v) improvements in solid waste collection and \nlandfill  site  management;  (vi)  improvement  in  PUSO  performance;  (vii)  reduction  of  traffic \ncongestion;  (viii)  reduction  of  vehicle  emissions;  (ix)  activities  of  CBOs;  (x)  number  of  ger  area \nhouseholds  and  CBOs  utilizing  small  loans;  (xi)  increase  in  public  awareness  of  public  health, \nenvironmental  management,  and  road  safety;  and  (xii)  environmental  compliance  and  monitoring \nreporting and National Inspection Agency reporting.  \n \n45. \nAt  the  beginning  of  the Project,  the PMU  and  PIUs,  with  assistance  from  the  consultants, \nwill  develop  PPMS  procedures  to  generate  data  systematically  on  the  inputs  and  outputs  of  the \nsubprojects, as well as the agreed socioeconomic, environmental, and health indicators to be used \nto  measure  the  project  impacts;  and  obtain  ADB\u2019s  approval  within  the  first  3  months  after  loan \neffectiveness. The PMU will (i) refine the PPMS framework, (ii) confirm achievable targets, (iii) firm \nup  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and  (iv)  establish  systems  and  procedures  no  later \nthan 6 months after loan effectiveness. \n \n46. \nThe  PPMS\u2014including  the  establishment  of  benchmarks,  collection  of  baseline  and \nprogress data, monitoring of benefits, and evaluation of social impact\u2014will be implemented by the \nPIUs  in  collaboration  with  the  aimag  governments,  PUSOs,  and  RD  of  UMG.  Data  will  be \npresented in simple formats that allow local inputs and respond to reporting formats. The PMU will \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB. 1989.

The  PPMS  will  be  designed  to  permit  adequate  flexibility  to  adopt  remedial \naction regarding project design, schedules, and activities. The PMU will report to ADB quarterly on \nboth the physical implementation and financial aspects of the Project, to ensure that impacts are \nmonitored and reported in line with ADB requirements. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\nThe Government and ADB will jointly review implementation progress at least once a year. \n47. \nIn addition, the Government and ADB will undertake a comprehensive midterm review after 2 years \nof  project  implementation.  The  midterm  review  will  include  a  detailed  assessment  of  (i)  scope, \n(ii) implementation  arrangements,  (iii)  achievement  of  scheduled  targets,  (iv)  progress  made  in \npolicy and tariff reform, and (v) capacity building measures. A detailed assessment of component A \nwill  be  undertaken,  including  the  implementation  status  of  the  tariff  reforms,  institutional \nstrengthening  of  the  PUSOs,  and  unaccounted  for  water  reduction  programs.  The  relative \nproportion of the loan used for components A and B will also be reassessed at midterm review. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n \n\n1. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement  \n\nfor \n\n(iii)  procedures \n\nformulating  RPs, \n\nIt is anticipated that land acquisition and resettlement will not be very significant13 and can \n48. \nbe  avoided  for  many  subprojects.  Some  houses,  gers,  and  fences  will  need  to  be  relocated  to \nnearby plots of land. To ensure that ADB policies on involuntary resettlement will be applied and \naffected people compensated, a resettlement framework has been prepared which sets out (i) the \nresettlement  policy  and  Mongolian  legal  framework  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement, \n(ii) compensation  standards  and  entitlements, \n(iv) \nimplementation  arrangements,  (v)  consultation  and  participation,  (vi)  eligibility  provision,  (vii)  a \ngrievance  redress  mechanism,  (viii)  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  (ix)  provision  of  the \nresettlement  budget.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  overall  resettlement  management  and \ncoordination,  internal  monitoring,  and  quarterly  reporting  to  ADB.  The  PIUs  will  take  primary \nresponsibility  for  any  resettlement  consultation,  notices,  implementation,  and  timely  delivery  of \nentitlements.  Because  of  limited  experience  with  involuntary  resettlement,  some  training  and \ncapacity building will be conducted under component D, and it was endorsed by the Government \nand disclosed to the affected people. \n \nThe draft RP was prepared for one of two core subprojects for the Hailaast road section.14 \n49. \nMCUD  and  UMG  implemented  The  Public  Communications  Policy  of  the  Asian  Development \nBank.15 During  implementation,  the  PMU  will  prepare  the  RPs  for  the  remaining  subprojects  that \nhave  resettlement  impacts,  based  on  the  RF  and  detailed  design.  The  PMU  will  review  the \nremaining  subprojects  before  the  award  of  the  civil  works  contracts  to  ensure  there  are  no \ninvoluntary  resettlement  effects  that  would  require  compensation  and  other  assistance  under \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (1995).  If  impacts  are  identified  and  cannot  be  avoided,  an  RP  will  be \nrequired. The summary RF is in Appendix 10. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n13 \u201cSignificant\u201d  means  200  or  more  people  will  experience  major  impacts,  which  are  defined  as  (i)  being  physically \n\ndisplaced from housing, or (ii) losing 10% or more of their productive assets (income generating). \n\n14  The Erdenet subproject does not require land acquisition or resettlement. \n15  ADB. 2005.

The Project \nwill provide or upgrade infrastructure, but will simultaneously (i) increase access to small loans for \nwater  connections  and  on-plot  facility  improvements,  (ii)  create  direct  short-term  employment  for \nconstruction  and  indirect  long-term  income  generating  opportunities,  and  (iii)  empower  poor \nresidents in decision-making processes through the establishment of CBOs to plan and implement \ncommunity  infrastructure  improvements.  The  Project  will  have  positive  health  benefits.  Residents \nare  expected  to  experience  a  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  water-  and  vector-borne  diseases\u2014\nrelated  to  unsafe  drinking  water  and  poor  sanitation\u2014as  well  as  medical  costs  and  lost  earning \nincurred as a result of these diseases. The Project will not increase the income gap between poor \nand  affluent  sectors,  and  is  expected  to  reduce  it.  Community  participation  is  at  the  core  of  the \nproject  design.  During  project  preparation,  local  communities  were  extensively  involved  in  the \ndesign of the Project through a series of public consultation, focus group discussion, and surveys. \nThe formation and participation of CBOs in the Project will be essential in achieving the outputs of \nthe  Project.  Nongovernment  organizations  will  play  a  facilitating  role  in  the  mobilization  of \ncommunities  and  formation  of  CBOs.  The  proposed  JFPR  project  (footnote  6)  will  assist  the \nGovernment to determine the legal aspects of the CBOs. Capacity building and training needs will \nalso  be  identified,  and  where  appropriate  training  will  be  conducted  by  nongovernment \norganizations. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy and the gender action plan are \nin Appendix 11 and 12. \n \nB. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Benefits  \n\nInitial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were  carried  out  for  the  core  subprojects  in \n51. \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines.16 It \nwas  determined  that  the  Project  will  not  have  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.  The \nProject  will not  adversely  affect  natural  resources  and  will greatly  improve  community  health and \nliving  conditions.  The  Project  will  reduce  environmental  pollution.  No  detrimental  effects  will  be \ncaused  on  the  flora  and  fauna.  On  a  per  capita  basis,  the Project  will decrease  the  demands  on \nenergy  resources  by  replacing  truck  water  tankers  with  a  piped  system.  Negative  environmental \nimpact  will  occur  during  construction,  but  its  extent  will  be  minimized  by  careful  design  and \nspecification of project construction through mitigation measures identified in the IEE. The adoption \nof composting toilets will reduce groundwater pollution and, with correct management, will produce \norganic  compost  for  small  farmers.  Improvement  of  the  urban  roads  will  reduce  dust  and  noise. \nHighlights of the summary IEE are in Appendix 13. The summary IEE includes the environmental \nassessment and review procedures. \n \nC. \n\nInstitutional Aspects \n\nThere  is  a  need  for  institutional  strengthening,  especially  at  the  local  government  level, \n52. \nfocusing  on:  (i)  planning  and  financial  management,  (ii)  O&M  of  basic  urban  infrastructure  and \nfacilities,  (iii)  maintenance  planning  for  urban  roads,  (iv)  community  participatory  structures  and \nprocess,  (v)  environmental  monitoring,  and  (vi)  handling  of  resettlement  issues.  Institutional \nstrengthening  incorporated  in  the  Project  through  component  D  includes  training  and  awareness \nprograms,  consulting  services  for  project  management  support,  and  institutional  and  financial \nstrengthening of the PUSOs and RD of UMG. \n \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nD. \n\nFinancial Evaluation \n\n53. \nThe financial evaluation of the Project was undertaken for the water supply and sanitation \nsubcomponents  in  Erdenet  in  real  terms  using  constant  2006  prices.  The  project  cost  estimates \nand  financial  projections  in  nominal  terms  were  converted  to  real  terms  by  adjusting  for  the \nprojected  effects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation  and  currency  fluctuation.  Incremental  revenue \nand  cost  were  derived  by  evaluating  the  financial  position  of  the  PUSO  under  with-  and  without-\nproject scenarios.17 The financial projections take into account impact on receivables and costs of \noperational improvements, reduction in unaccounted-for water, and charging and receiving full cost \nrecovery tariffs. The financial internal rate of return was computed on an after-tax basis of 8.10%, \nwhich  compares  favorably  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  in  real  terms  of  0.25%.  The \nfinancial analysis is in Appendix 14.  \n \n54. \nThe sensitivity analysis for the subproject includes examination of the risk that project cost \nwill increase by 10%, or that revenue will decrease by 10% without implementation of required tariff \nreform; the resulting financial internal rate of returns are 6.5% and 6.3%. An affordability analysis \nof  the  subproject  showed  that  the  proposed  water  supply  tariffs  should  be  set  at  the  level \naffordable to average and poor households. These tariffs are 3.25% of the average poor household \nincome of MNT82,923.18  \n \nFinancial  projections  were  prepared  for  the  Erdenet  PUSO  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n55. \nGuidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by \nADB19 to assess the financial viability and sustainability of the subproject. The projected financial \nstatements  indicate  that  financial  revenue  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  the  O&M  costs  and \ndepreciation and debt service, whichever is greater, and provide a reasonable rate of return. Based \non  the  financial  projections,  the  PUSO  will  be  in  a  position  to  maintain  a  minimum  debt-service \ncoverage  ratio  of  1.2:1.0,  a  maximum  debt-equity  ratio  of  70:30,  and  a  minimum  current  ratio  of \n2:1. The PUSO has agreed to minimum levels of financial performance, and these will be included \nas  loan  covenants  covering  capital  structure  (debt  to  equity),  debt  service  cover,  and  liquidity. \nFinancial projections estimate the tariff required for an appropriate level of financial performance. \nPeriodic tariff reviews and approval of appropriate tariff reforms by the aimag government will be \nrequired to reduce the risk of poor financial performance. The Project is considered both financially \nviable and sustainable. \n \nE. \n\nFinancial Management Assessment  \n\nThe  financial  management  assessment  of  MCUD,  the  PUSO  in  Erdenet,  and  the  RD  of \n56. \nUMG has been undertaken using the financial management assessment questionnaire provided by \nADB. It determined the accounting and financial capacity needs of MCUD, the Erdenet PUSO, and \nthe  RD  of  UMG  during  project  implementation  and  operations  after  project  completion.  The \nquestionnaire was administered to MCUD, the finance departments of the Erdenet PUSO, and the \nfinance division of the RD of UMG. \n \n57. \nThe assessment of MCUD\u2019s previous experience managing ADB-funded projects confirms \nthat  their  financial  management  practices  are  fully  adequate  for  implementation  of  the  Project.  In \nthe case of the Erdenet PUSO and the RD of UMG, staff will need training in project management \n\n                                                 \n17  The  without-project  scenario  assumes  that  phased  tariff  restructuring,  full  metering,  and  unaccounted-for  water \nreduction  targets  have  not  been  implemented  successfully.  The  with-project  scenario  assumes  that  they  have  been \nimplemented successfully. \n\n18  Based on the socioeconomic survey conducted during project preparation. \n19 ADB. 2001.

With the help of international \nand national consultants, capacity of the Erdenet PUSO and the RD of UMG will be strengthened \nin:  (i)  efficient  operations  of  the  physical  facilities;  (ii)  functional  areas  covering  administration, \nfinance,  accounting,  and  business  planning;  and  (iii)  management  information  system,  and  cost \nmanagement and control.  \n \nF. \n\nEconomic Aspects  \n\nThe  economic  analysis  covers  both  the  Project  as  a  whole,  and  the  individual  core \n58. \nsubprojects in Erdenet and Hailaast in Ulaanbaatar. For the Project as a whole, the analysis covers \nthe  economic  rationale  for  public  intervention,  and  goals  and  general  design  of  the  public \ninvestment plan. The economic rationale is sound, based on managing natural monopolies (water \nsupply, wastewater management, and urban roads). The goals of the investment plan are to meet \ntargets  for  water  supply,  sewerage,  and  sanitation  coverage  in  the  ger  areas,  and  urban  road \nimprovement in Ulaanbaatar. Centralized water supply and sewerage facilities are part of a least-\ncost  plan  to  achieve  water  service  coverage  targets  under  three  basic  conditions:  (i)  water \nconnections and metering are to be provided in the ger and apartment areas, including budget and \nprivate  organizations;  (ii)  water  tariffs  are  to  provide  appropriate  economic  incentives  for  water \nconservation; and (iii) water supply and sanitation facilities are designed as least cost. The Project \naddresses  the  first  two  conditions  through  its  assurances  as  well  as  policy  dialogue.  The  third \ncondition is part of the appraisal criteria for representative water supply and sanitation subprojects. \nUrban  road  improvement  is  a  priority  investment  to  ease  traffic  flow  and  reduce  accidents,  and \ndesigned as least cost in terms of physical improvements. \n \nA quantitative economic analysis also demonstrated the value of the Project. The economic \n59. \nanalysis  was  conducted  for  the  core  subprojects  over  a  25-year  period  inclusive  of  the  project \nconstruction period, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.20 \nThe economic benefits and costs for the water supply subcomponent in Erdenet were estimated on \na without- and with-project basis appropriately apportioned on the basis of being tradable or non-\ntradable,  and  with  adjustments  to  the  non-incremental  and  incremental  project  benefits. \nIncremental benefits were valued on the basis of willingness to pay and non-incremental benefits \nwere valued on the basis of cost savings. The economic costs of urban road improvement reflect \nthe  incremental  costs  for  investment  and  O&M  under  the  with-project  situation,  and  the  costs \ninvolved  in  operating  the  existing  facility  under  the  without-project  situation.  The  major  economic \nbenefits are savings in vehicle operating cost, including reduced maintenance costs and savings in \ntravel time for passengers and goods. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Erdenet \nwater  supply  subcomponent  is  29.4%,  higher  than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital \nassumed at 12.0%. The overall EIRR of all subcomponents, including sanitation and on-plot facility \nimprovements for Erdenet, is estimated at 40.9%, which includes water supply benefits as well as \nhealth and employment benefits. The EIRR for the Hailaast subproject for urban road improvement \nin Ulaanbaatar is 18.0%. The economic analysis is in Appendix 15.   \n \nG. \n\nProject Risks and Mitigation Measures \n\nThe Project does not have any unusual technical risks. Conventional engineering designs \n60. \nwith  proven  records  of  reliable  performance  are  adopted  for  water  supply,  wastewater \nmanagement,  solid  waste  management,  and  roads.  The  ICB  equipment  procurement  will  include \ntechnical  support \nthe \nmanufacturer.  During  project  implementation,  the  PMU  will  support  the  PIUs  to  ensure  that \nequipment and civil works comply with design requirements and quality standards. \n\ntesting,  and  commissioning  as  recommended  by \n\ninstallation, \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n20 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nTwo  potential  risks  have  been  identified.  The  first  is  the  possibility  of  delays  in  the \n61. \nformulation of the remaining subprojects and project implementation caused by weak institutional \ncapacity of the PIUs. Considerable preparatory work has been undertaken for the subprojects and \ninstitutional  development  for  the  PIUs  will  be  provided  during  project  implementation  to  mitigate \nthis risk. The second risk is the possibility of delays in undertaking operational improvements along \nwith  revision  of  the  tariff  structure  for  water  supply  and  wastewater  collection.  To  facilitate  tariff \ncollection  based  on  the  proposed  tariff  structure,  a  substantial  number  of  water  meters  will  be \ninstalled under the Project for apartment dwellers, public and private organizations, ger area water \nkiosks,  and  ger  area  households  when  they  are  connected.  In  addition,  the  project  management \nconsultants  will  assist  the  aimag  governments  in  institutionalizing  the  tariff  review  process  and \nconducting regular tariff reviews.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \n\n62. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n63.  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, MCUD will cause the relevant aimag governments, \nin consultation with ADB to commence a review and provide recommendations on the revision of \nlocal regulations relating to management of the water supply and sanitation systems, effective tariff \ncollection, and water loss reduction and metering. \n \nPrior to entering into an OLA with a PUSO, the Government will cause, through the SLAs, \n64. \neach  aimag  government  to  improve  each  PUSO\u2019s  overall  effectiveness  by  developing  a  priority \nreform  and  efficiency  policy,  including  such  matters  agreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB. \nDuring  project  implementation,  MCUD  will  review  each  current  management  contract  between  a \nPUSO  and  the  relevant  aimag  government,  and  its  surrounding  policy  and  legal  framework,  and \nbased upon such review make recommendations for reform. \n \n65.  MCUD will cause each aimag government to ensure that (i) water supply and wastewater \ntariffs  for  all  users  are  restructured  to  cover  all  costs  associated  with  the  services  provided; \n(ii) each PUSO undertakes annual reviews of tariffs and fees; (iii) no entity receiving water supply \nand  wastewater  collection  services  is  exempt  from  payment  of  the  tariff  or  excused  for  delays  in \npayments  without  penalty;  and  (iv)  a  review  is  conducted  of  the  impact  of  increased  water  and \nwastewater tariffs on the poor, taking into account the ability of consumers, particularly vulnerable \npeople, to pay for such increases. After the review, MCUD will make recommendations on lifeline \nwater tariffs to the poor.  \n \nFor the Erdenet subproject, the Government will cause the aimag government to cause the \n66. \nCity Maintenance Local State-owned Entity to (i) prepare an action plan and budget for improving \nsolid  waste  collection  and  disposal  in  compliance  with  all  environmental  laws,  and  (ii)  apply  the \nsolid waste collection trucks to be supplied under the Project to the action plan. \n \n67.  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, UMG  will commence preparation of the UMG road \nsafety  guidelines  and  action  plan.  UMG  will  implement  such  guidelines  and  action  plan  during \nproject  implementation.  UMG  will  also  ensure  that  vehicle  axle  weight  limits  are  established  and \nenforced  to  prevent  overloaded  vehicles  from  entering  the  project  roads.  Before  opening  the \nproject roads, UMG will ensure that road safety measures identified in the action plan are applied \nto the improved sections. \n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\nEach PUSO and the RD of UMG will (i) be responsible for O&M of its project facilities and \n68. \nensure that facilities are operated and maintained in accordance with sound practices; (ii) allocate \nand  make  available  sufficient  funds  from  its  budget,  in  a  timely  manner  for  each  fiscal  year,  for \nO&M  of  the  project  facilities;  and  (iii)  ensure  that  such  facilities  are  operated  and  maintained  in \naccordance with sound practices. \n \n69. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  (i)  all  land  and  rights-of-way  required  by  the  Project  are \nmade  available  in  a  timely  manner;  and  (ii)  to  the  extent  possible,  the  subprojects  will  minimize \nland acquisition or involuntary resettlement. If land acquisition and/or involuntary resettlement are \nrequired for any subproject, the Government will prepare or will cause to prepare, an RP for such \nsubproject  in  accordance  with  (i)  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  (ii) ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement, and (iii) the resettlement framework. Such RP will be submitted to ADB for approval, \nprior to any land acquisition being initiated. Any such RP will be based on the final detailed design \nfor  such  subproject,  and  disclosed  to  affected  people  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  information \ndisclosure  requirements.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  any  relocation,  resettlement  and \ncompensation  of  any  persons  who  are  adversely  affected,  or  who  will  be  relocated  as  a \nconsequence of the Project, will be promptly and efficiently carried out in accordance with (i) the \nRP, and (ii) ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement, such that the affected persons will at least maintain \ntheir standard of living at the same level as before implementation of the Project.  \n \nThe  Government  will  contract,  operate,  maintain,  and  monitor  the  project  facilities  in \n70. \ncompliance  with  (i)  applicable  laws  and  regulations;  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy;  and  (iii)  the \nenvironmental  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures,  environmental  management  program  (EMP), \nand  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  in  the  approved  IEEs.

INVESTMENT PLAN \n \n\nA. \n\nUrban Development Sector Policy \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  urban  development  policies  are  expressed  in  a  number  of  documents \n1. \nthat  relate  to  human  settlement  issues.  The  1995  medium  term  strategy  was  the  first  important \npost-socialist  statement  on  urban  development  in  Mongolia.  It  recognized  that  the  Government \ndoes not have the necessary resources to replace the growing number of ger (traditional tent) area \nhouses  with  subsidized  apartments,  and  concluded  that  greater  encouragement  of  individual \ninitiative  in  the  urban  development  sector  is  needed  if  Mongolia\u2019s  urban  problems  are  to  be \naddressed.  The  Government\u2019s  2003  strategy  for  economic  growth  support  and  poverty  reduction \ncalled  for  narrowing  income  gaps,  reducing  disparities  in  living  conditions,  and  creating  enabling \nenvironments to support small and medium-sized enterprise development for both urban and rural \nsettlements.   \n \n2. \nThe  urban  policy  implications  from  the  Government\u2019s  action  plan  for  2004\u20132008  call  for: \n(i) upgrading the quality of public service by strengthening the capacity and accountability of public \nservice institutions and civil servants, expanding civil participation at all levels of decision making, \nand  ensuring  transparency;  (ii)  deepening  legal  reforms  in  all  spheres  of  political,  economic,  and \nsocial  life;  and  substantially  improving  the  standards  to  ensure  human  rights  and  create  a  safe \nliving  environment;  (iii)  sustaining  private  sector  led,  stable,  and  higher  economic  growth; \n(iv) conducting social policy targeted at improving the living standards of families and households, \nand  providing  them  with  a  favorable  legal  environment,  adequate  infrastructure,  and  financial \nenvironment  to  accumulate  savings;  and  to  own,  possess,  and  dispose  of  immovable  property \n(such as land and houses); (v) carrying out human development policy aimed at educating citizens \nwho  respect  education,  culture,  and  national  traditional  heritage,  and  are  highly  conscious  about \nprotection  of  the  environment;  and  (vi)  intensifying  residential  construction  based  on  standards, \nreducing harmful waste, and providing ecological education to residents.  \n \n3. \nWithin  the  framework  of  the  action  plan,  the  Government  has  developed  a  program  to \nprovide  40,000  families  with  opportunities  to  live  in  houses  with  proper  facilities  (40,000  Houses \nProgram).  The  program  has  three  main  components:  (i)  new  apartments  (10,000  units), \n(ii) moderately  priced  housing  (15,000  units),  and  (iii)  improvement  in  ger  area  housing  and \ninfrastructure  (15,000  units).  The  Ministry  of  Construction  and  Urban  Development  has  accorded \nhigh priority to the 40,000 Houses Program and plans to implement it through domestic resources \nand  external  assistance.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  achieving  the  target  of  improving \ninfrastructure  for  15,000  ger  area  households,  but  will  also  help  achieve  the  15,000  target  of \nmoderately priced housing through small loans for on-plot facility improvements. \n \n4. \nThe  urban  development  and  housing  strategy,  developed  under  technical  assistance \nfinanced  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),1 provides  direct  support  to  the  Government\u2019s \nAction  Program  for  2004\u20132008  and  its  achievement  of  the  40,000  Houses  Program.  Both  the \nstrategy and the Government\u2019s program provide the basis for the Project, with particular focus on \nger  area  upgrading.  Ger  area  upgrading  proposed  under  the  strategy  is  expected  to  initiate  a \nmethodology that can be replicated across urban centers throughout Mongolia. The methodology \naims  to  encourage  local  initiative,  support  public  and  private  collaboration,  share  costs  in  an \naffordable  and  equitable  manner,  and  enable  the  greatest  physical  improvement  to  be \naccomplished at the lowest possible cost. It links infrastructure and on-plot facility improvement in a \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2004.

The law took over 4 years to design under the public administration reform program, \nand  marks  a  watershed  in  the  national  finance  and  budgeting  process.  It  replaces  the  former \nbottom-up budgeting process from the soum (district) to aimag (province) to central Government, \nwith  a  combined  bottom-up  and  top-down  approach.  There  are  two  main  parts  to  the  law: \n(i) improvement  of  the  national  finance  and  budgeting  process,  and  (ii)  overall  improvement  of \npublic administration. \n \n6. \nUnder the law, the budgeting process is essentially a two-stage iterative process. The first \nstage is based on a national fiscal framework statement containing preliminary budget proposals. \nThe second stage is comprised of final budget estimates and based on strategic business plans, \nthe  investment  components  of  which  are  the  budget  organizations\u2019  Public  Investment  Programs \n(PIPs) and portfolio ministries\u2019 budgets approved by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The first phase \nbegins before 1 March of each year preceding the budget year, after MOF has developed a fiscal \nframework statement containing draft budget limitations based on macroeconomic indicators (e.g., \nconsumer  price  inflation,  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  growth,  etc.).  The  draft  budget \nlimitations are submitted to the portfolio ministries, aimag governments, the Prime Minister\u2019s office, \nand the governor of the Bank of Mongolia. Draft strategic business plans are also developed by all \nbudget  organizations  and  submitted  to  their  respective  portfolio  ministries.  After  checking  and \nrefining the various strategic business plans, the portfolio ministries submit them to MOF along with \ntheir  own  budget  proposals.  MOF  negotiates  with  each  portfolio  ministry  on  their  draft  strategic \nbusiness  plans  and  proposed  budget,  including  their  PIPs;  finalizes  the  draft  medium-term  draft \ndocument  of  the  fiscal  framework  statement  and  appreciation  requests;  and  submits  them  to  the \nCabinet. After approval by the Cabinet, the medium-term fiscal framework statement is submitted \nto parliament no later than 1 May, parliament spring session. Once the fiscal framework statement \nand financial indicators are approved by parliament, they are sent back to the portfolio ministries. \n \n7. \nThe second phase begins when general managers of all budget organizations submit next \nyear\u2019s appropriation estimates and draft strategic business plans to the portfolio ministries no later \nthan 1 July. After negotiating with their budget organizations, portfolio ministries submit next year\u2019s \nfinal  appropriation  estimates  and  draft  strategic  business  plans  to  MOF  no  later  than  15  August. \nRelevant departments of MOF review the appropriation estimates and negotiate with each portfolio \nministry.  MOF  subsequently  compiles  the  portfolio  appropriation  estimates  and  medium-term \neconomic and financial objectives, and submits them to Cabinet no later than 15 September. After \nit approves, Cabinet submits the draft general guidelines for socioeconomic development, and the \nstate budget proposal and appropriation estimates for each portfolio ministry to Parliament no later \nthan  1  October  of  the  preceding  fiscal  year.  Parliament  must  pass  the  budget  no  later  than \n1 December. Article 33.2.4 of the law also states that each component of the approved budget by \nParliament must be approved. \n \nC. \n\nUrban Development Sector Strategy for 2004\u20132008 \n\nThe  primary  objective  of  the  urban  development  sector  strategy  is  to  support  the \n8. \ngovernment action plan for 2004\u20132008 and its goal of the 40,000 Houses Program. A major effort \nof  the  strategy  is  aimed  at  making  visible,  tangible,  and  affordable  improvements  in  the  living \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2       25  \n \n\n \n\nconditions  of  urban  households,  especially  ger  area  households.  A  multifaceted  approach  will  be \nintroduced, tested, and expanded by the application of the strategy. It will provide affordable and \nquality  improvements  to  ger  areas  that  meet  legal  requirements,  and  provide  households  with  a \nrecognized  financial  asset  that  can  be  used  as  collateral  for  obtaining  a  small  loan.  It  will  also \nsupport  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  privatize  urban  land  and  improve  the  quality  of  urban \ndevelopment  through  understandable  and  affordable  regulations.  Simple,  illustrated  codes  and \nzoning regulations will be applied, and local builders will be trained in their use. Finally, the strategy \nwill target housing finance to moderate income households that are eager to improve their housing. \n \n9. \nThe  five  goals  were  established  under  the  strategy:  (i)  implementation  of  the  40,000 \nHouses Program, (ii) restructuring ger area neighborhoods and their urban services, (iii) low cost \nalternative \nincome  housing  areas,  and \n(v) establishment of an independent housing finance institution. \n \nD. \n\nPIP in Urban Development: 2006\u20132009 \n\ninfrastructure  and  services,  (iv) \n\ninfill  and  mixed \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Construction  and  Urban  Development  prepared  and  submitted  to  the \n10. \nGovernment the following allotments under the PIP for specific urban investments from 2006\u20132009 \nas shown in Table A2.1.  \n\n \nTable A2.1: PIP for Urban Development Sector (as of March 2006) \n\nProjects \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\nPeriod of \nimplementation\n\nBudget \n(MNT \nmillion) \n5,100 \n\n2005\u20132008 \n\n1,500 \n\n1,500 \n\n2,100 \n\n2004\u20132008 \n\n1,110.0 \n\n200.0 \n\n300.0 \n\n610.5 \n\n1.

In issuing this invitation, MCUD will refer to the following basic selection \ncriteria:  \n \n\n(i) \n\nComponent A: Improvement of Basic Urban Services \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\n(h) \n\n(i) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\nis  not  categorized  as  category  A  or  category  B \n\nThere is a prospect for rapid population growth or significant population lives \nin ger areas in the proposed subproject town. \nThe subproject\u2019s components are included in city of sector master plans for \nthe relevant aimag. \nThe  subproject \nenvironmentally sensitive under ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy (2002). \nThe subproject avoids or minimizes resettlement temporary or permanent. \nPlots  in  ger  areas  have  been  privatized  or  the  legal  right  for  residents  to \nacquire legal title to such plots exists. \nRaw water sources are or will be available from an aquifer with a reliable and \nadequate  yield  and  acceptable  quality  of  supply,  except  to  the  extent  it \nrequires disinfection. \nThe  relevant  PUSO  delivers  a  certificate  of  incorporation,  or  equivalent \nestablishment document (including an explanation of its ownership). \nThe  relevant  aimag  government  provides  a  demonstrated  ability  and \nwillingness  to  implement  tariff  reforms  that  ensure  cost  recovery  and \naffordability for poor households. \nThe  relevant  aimag  government  provides  a  demonstrated  ability  and \nwillingness  to  finance  and  provide  adequate  funds  for  operation  and \nmaintenance of the project facilities. \n\nis  not  categorized  as  category  A  or  category  B \n\nThe subproject\u2019s components are included in city or sector master plans for \nUlaanbaatar city. \nThe  subproject \nenvironmentally sensitive under ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy (2002). \nThe subproject avoids or minimizes resettlement temporary or permanent. \nThe proposed subproject connects a ger area in the outskirts of the city with \nthe city center or is located in the city center. \nThe proposed road section has sufficient road users to justify the economic \nviability  of  the  proposed  subproject  and  is  expected  to  have  a  significant \ntraffic volume upon completion, sufficient for its economic viability. \nUMG  is  committed  to  finance  to  provide  adequate  funds  to  operate  and \nmaintain the project roads. \n\n(ii) \n\nComponent B: Urban Road Improvement \n\nFor those subprojects meeting all of the above selection criteria, MCUD will ask the relevant \n\n \n2. \nlocal aimag governments and UMG to undertake detailed subproject preparation as follows: \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nB. \n\nStep 2: Subproject Preparation \n\n3. \nSelected  aimag  governments  and  UMG  will  prepare  a  detailed  subproject  proposal, \nfeasibility  study,  initial  environmental  examination,  and  resettlement  plan,  where  applicable,  to \nstandards necessary to meet both domestic and ADB requirements. Aimag governments and UMG \nwill  also  determine  suitable  institutional  arrangements  for  subproject  implementation  and  prepare \ncost estimates and a detailed financing plan. To facilitate an orderly and consistent appraisal of the \nsubprojects,  MCUD  will  require  an  integrated  feasibility  study  in  a  common  format  for  each \nproposed  subproject.  Such  format  has  been  used  for  preparation  of  the  core  subprojects  and \nincludes  (i)  a  deficiency  analysis  and  options  study  for  sustainable  solutions;  (ii)  preliminary \nengineering designs and cost estimates; (iii) an assessment of financial and economic viability and \nsustainability;  (iv)  the  identification  of  necessary  reforms;  (v)  environmental  screening,  and  the \npreparation  of  an  initial  environmental  examination  where  necessary;  and  (vi)  a  social  impact \nassessment and resettlement plans where necessary. \n \nC. \n\nStep 3: Appraisal and Approval \n\n4. \nSeparate evaluation criteria were developed for water supply, wastewater, and solid waste \nmanagement  subprojects,  and  urban  road  improvement  subprojects,  to  ensure  that  individual \nsubproject  appraisal  is  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB  standards.

\nImplementation  arrangements  will  follow  procedures  that  have  been  successfully  used  by \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank for previous urban development projects \nin Mongolia.  \n \nA.  \n\nProject Management \n\n1. \n\nExecuting Agency \n\n2. \nThe Ministry of Construction and Urban Development (MCUD) will be the Executing Agency \nand will have overall responsibility for project coordination, implementation, and liaison with ADB, \nother  government  ministries  and  departments,  and  external  assistance  agencies. MCUD  has five \nmain departments, including a newly formed Department for Finance, Investment and Cooperation. \nMCUD  currently  manages  four  loan  projects  and  seven  grant  projects  supported  by  external \nassistance.  \n \n\n2.  \n\nProject Steering Committee \n\n3. \nA project steering committee (PSC), under the leadership of MCUD, will be established to \nprovide  policy  guidance  during  project  implementation,  and  to  ensure  close  coordination  of  the \nProject  with  ongoing  urban \ninfrastructure  projects  in  Mongolia.  The  PSC  will  comprise \nrepresentatives  from  MCUD;  Ministry  of  Finance;  Ministry  of  Nature  and  Environment;  National \nCenter  for  Construction,  Urban  Development,  and  Public  Utilities;  Ulaanbaatar  municipal \ngovernment (UMG); and participating aimag (province) governments. In particular, the PSC will be \nresponsible for (i) setting policy guidelines for improving project implementation, (ii) coordinating at \nthe  policy  level  with  other  government  departments,  (iii)  reviewing  and  approving  annual \nimplementation  plans,  (iv)  monitoring  project  implementation  progress,  and  (v)  overseeing \nprocurement activities and awarding of contacts.    \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Management Unit \n\n4. \nA project management unit (PMU) will be established in MCUD to manage the Project as a \nwhole  and  to  coordinate  the  work  of  the  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  for  each  subproject. \nThe  PMU  will  comprise  a  staff  of  six  full-time  professionals  and  three  support  staff,  based  in \nUlaanbaatar.  Professional  staff  will  include  (i)  a  project  manager  and  urban  planner,  (ii)  a \nmicrofinance  specialist,  (iii)  a  construction  and  supervising  engineer,  (iv)  a  community  organizer \nand trainer, (v) a procurement specialist, and (vi) an accountant. Primary functions of the PMU will \nbe to provide the focal point for reporting to the Government and ADB on project implementation; \nto  guide  and  monitor  the  performance  and  outputs  of  the  PIUs;  and  to  arrange  procurement \nprocessing  for  civil  works  and  equipment,  particularly  in  respect  of  goods  required  under  the \nProject. \n \n\n4.  \n\nProject Implementation Units \n\nfor  all  aspects  of  subproject \n\nPIUs will be established in each project town and UMG to coordinate the preparation and \n5. \ndevelopment  of  the  subprojects  under  the  general  direction  of  the  PMU.  The  PIUs  will  be \nresponsible \nincluding  working  with  project \nstakeholders,  maintaining  subproject  accounts,  clearing  environmental  examinations,  monitoring \nsubproject performance, and submitting timely progress reports. The PIU in Erdenet will be staffed \nby  (i)  a  director  and  construction  manager,  (ii)  a  finance  and  accounting  specialist,  (iii)  a \nconstruction supervisor and inspector, (iv) a community development specialist, and (v) a secretary \n\nimplementation, \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nand translator. The PIU for the urban road improvement component in Ulaanbaatar will comprise \n(i) a  director  and  roads  engineer,  (ii)  a  construction  engineer,  (iii)  an  accountant,  and  (iv)  a \nsecretary and translator. \n \nThe PIUs will be supported by international and national consultants to (i) carry out public \n6. \nawareness and education campaigns, (ii) provide technical and practical training, (iii) establish and \nsupport \nthe  development  and  operation  of  community  groups,  (iv)  promote  community \nparticipation,  (v)  encourage  financial  planning,  and  (vi)  conduct  participatory  monitoring  and \nevaluation.  \n \n\n5.  \n\nSubproject Working Groups \n\nEach  subproject  will  involve  continuous  participation  by  the  principal  stakeholders.  A \n7. \nworking  group  will  be  formed  to  facilitate  communication  among  subproject  participants  and \ninterface with the local government on a regular basis. The working group for components A and C \nwill  be  chaired  by  the  aimag  governor  and  includes  representatives  from  the  aimag  government, \nPIU, public urban services organization (PUSO), local governments, nongovernment organizations, \ncommunity-based  organizations,  and  local  banks  and  nonbanking  financial  institutions  (NBFIs). \nThe  working  group  for  component  B  will  be  chaired  by  the  mayor  of  Ulaanbaatar  and  includes \nrepresentatives  from  the  Road  Department  of  UMG,  PIU,  and  participating  district  governments. \nThe working groups will report on subproject progress and resolve any minor difficulties that might \noccur during implementation. The working groups will also serve as the first arbiter to address and \nresolve  any  problems  or  grievances  with  residents,  including  issues  related  to  temporary \nresettlement.   \n \n\n6.  \n\nLocal Governments \n\n8. \nThe  Road  Department  of  UMG  and  aimag  governments  in  the  subproject  towns  will  be \nresponsible  for  timely  disbursements  from  the  ADB  loan  to  implement  their  subprojects  and  for \nproviding local government support and counterpart staff to work with the PIUs. Local governments \nwill  also  be  responsible  for  maintaining  an  open  dialogue  with  the  community  and  for  increasing \npublic awareness about the subproject.  \n \n\n7.  \n\nPublic Urban Service Organizations \n\n9. \nThe  local  PUSOs  will  be  responsible  for  all  water  resource,  supply  and  distribution,  and \nsewerage  and  wastewater  treatment  subcomponents  of  the  subprojects,  and,  in  some  cases, \nmanagement of solid waste. They will be the ultimate borrowers of funds for the facilities improved \nunder component A of the Project. The capacity of these local institutions to implement their parts \nof the subprojects will be strengthened under component D of the Project.  \n \n\n8.  \n\nCommunity-Based Organizations \n\n10. \nImplementation  of  community  and  household  initiatives  under  component  C  will  require  a \nlead  time  of  1\u20132  years  to  allow  time  for  the  mobilization  and  strengthening  of  the  participating \ninstitutions  (community-based  organizations,  NBFIs,  nongovernment  organizations,  savings \ngroups, etc.). Time will also be required to instill community awareness and responsibility for small-\nscale  improvements  to  be  financed  by  the  community  and  individual  loans  (individual  water \nimprovements, \nconnections,  minor  housing \ngreenhouses, etc.).  \n \n \n\nimprovements,  on-plot  sanitation  and  heating \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7       35 \n\n9. \n\nSavings Groups \n\n11. \nSavings  groups  are  a  recent  and  growing  phenomenon  in  ger  (traditional  tent)  area \ncommunities.  They  provide  an  important  new  vehicle  through  which  to  empower  women  and \nfinance  very  small  scale  housing  improvements.  They  will  be  instrumental  in  making  the  small \nloans for energy efficient stoves and compost toilets.  \n\n \n\n10. \n\nCommercial Banks and Nonbanking Financial Institutions \n\n12. \nUnder  component  C,  loans  will  be  made  available  to  commercial  banks  and  NBFIs  to \nestablish small loan facilities to individuals and communities in ger areas. The PMU will determine \nand finalize initial eligibility criteria for the participating banks and NBFIs, and terms and conditions \nof small loans for end users during project implementation. They will be reviewed and endorsed by \nthe Ministry of Finance and MCUD, and submitted to ADB for approval. \n\n \n\n \n\nB.  \n\nStakeholder Organization Chart \n\nThe  following  (Figure  A7.1)  indicates  the  basic  relationships  among  stakeholders  at  both \n13. \nthe  national  and  local  levels.  The  PIUs  will  help  form  the  bridge  between  the  national  and  local \nlevels  through  regular  communication  with  the  PMU.  They  will  be  responsible  for  much  of  the \nsubproject level monitoring. Both the PMU and PIUs will have designated staff responsible for the \nProject.  The  working groups  will  ensure  that  subproject  issues and progress are addressed on a \nregular basis, communicated to local government authorities, and any disputes are resolved. They \nwill also help ensure the coordination of activities among all stakeholders.   \n \n \n\n \nFigure A7.1:   Stakeholder Organization Chart \n \n \n \n \n \n\nMCUD\n\nMOF\n\nADB \n\nProject

\n\nThe  resettlement  framework  (RF)  sets  out  compensation  and  other  entitlements  for  all \n1. \naffected  persons.  It  also  outlines  the  necessary  steps  to  prepare  satisfactory  subproject \nresettlement plans (RPs). Core subprojects have been conceived and planned to avoid or minimize \nresettlement.  All  resettlement  impacts  for  the  core  subprojects  will  be  updated  based  on  the \ndetailed  engineering  design.  RPs  for  noncore  subprojects  will  be  prepared  based  on  detailed \ndesign. \n \nB. \n\nResettlement Impacts \n\n2. \nIt  is  anticipated  that  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  not  be  very  significant.  Some \nhouses,  gers  (traditional  tents),  and  fences  will  need  to  be  relocated  for  the  core  subproject  in \nHailaast for the urban road improvement component in Ulaanbaatar. The Hailaast core subproject \nwill affect 38 households in total. There will be no resettlement in the core subproject in Erdenet for \nthe  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  management  subcomponents.  For  the  noncore \nsubprojects, some will require RPs to address minor resettlement impacts.  \n \nC. \n\nPolicy and Legal Framework \n\n3. \nThe  RF  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s) \nInvoluntary Resettlement (1995) and the Government\u2019s two recent laws related to land: (i) the Law \nof Mongolia on Land, effective 7 June 2002; and (ii) the Law on the Allocation of Land to Mongolian \nCitizens for Ownership, effective 27 June 2002. Neither existing legislation in Mongolia nor ADB\u2019s \npolicy  require  formal  legal  title  to  land  for  affected  persons  to  be  eligible  for  entitlements  or \nassistance.  Market  values  will  be  used  to  compensate  for  acquiring  plots  and  buildings.  A \nparticipatory approach will be adopted to grievance resolution through information disclosure and \ndiscussions with affected communities. \n \nD. \n\nEntitlements \n\nThe  household  occupying  the  plot  will  be  entitled  to  full  compensation  from  resettlement. \n4. \nThe  households  will  be  compensated  for  their  relocation  costs,  given  assistance  to  find  suitable \nhousing,  or  allocated  a  plot  without  charge.  Local  governments  will  identify,  consult  with,  and \nformulate special measures for vulnerable residents; and include these in the RPs. \n \nE. \n\nProcedures for Formulating Resettlement Plans \n\n5. \nThe  key  procedures  and  steps  for  preparation  of  the  RPs  for  the  noncore  subprojects \ninclude  the  following:  (i)  identify  scope  (check  categorization);  (ii)  conduct  investigation  and \ninventory  survey;  (iii)  prepare  draft  RP;  (iv)  disclose  the  draft  RP  and  consult  with  the  affected \npersons; (v) finalize the RP, obtain local government endorsement, and submit to ADB for review \nand  approval;  (vi)  disclose  the  approved  RP  (locally  and  on  ADB\u2019s  website);  and  (vii)  pay \ncompensation and relocate people to new plots prior to award of civil works. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  ensure  that  participating  local  governments  and \n6. \nUlaanbaatar  municipal  government  (UMG)  formulate  satisfactory  RPs,  and  are  responsible  for \noverall resettlement management and coordination, internal monitoring, and quarterly reporting to \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nADB. The project implementation units (PIUs) will take primary responsibility for any resettlement \nconsultation, notices, implementation, and timely delivery of entitlements. \n \nG. \n\nConsultation and Participation \n\n7. \nLocal  governments  and  UMG  will  meet  and  consult  with  the  affected  households  to \nincorporate their concerns and suggestions into the RPs. Decisions reached by these consultations \nwill be recorded with responsibility and timelines for their implementation. Each RP will include a \nlist of the public consultations conducted and planned. Resettlement information will be disclosed \nto all affected households during RP preparation, and their views and opinions will be incorporated \nin finalizing the RPs. Affected persons will be closely consulted and will participate in the selection \nof new plots and restoration of livelihoods. \n \nH. \n\nEligibility Provisions \n\n8. \nAll  affected  persons  will  be  entitled  to  compensation  and  rehabilitation.  Nevertheless, \neligibility to receive compensation and other assistance will be limited by a cutoff date. This date \nwill  correspond  to  the  approval  date  by  the  Citizen\u2019s  Representative  Khural  (assembly)  for  each \nsubproject. Notification of the cutoff date, which defines \u201celigibility\u201d and \u201caffected persons\u201d, will be \nposted in the affected neighborhoods. \n \nI. \n\nGrievance Redress Mechanism \n\n9. \nRelated  Mongolian  laws  provide  a  mechanism  for  affected  persons  to  present  their \ngrievances. The working group to be established in each project town and Ulaanbaatar will serve \nas the initial committee for grievance redress, and will provide an open forum for raising objections \nand  holding  discussions  to  resolve  conflicts.  The  working  group  will  record  its  deliberations  and \ninform  the  concerned  parties  within  1  week  of  its  findings  and  recommendations.  These  findings \nwill  be  presented  for  action  to  the  aimag  (province)  and  soum  (district)  governors  for  the  water \nsupply,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  management  subcomponents;  and  the  city  mayor  and  district \ngovernors for the urban road improvement component in Ulaanbaatar. \n \nJ. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n10. \nThe  PIUs  will  monitor  implementation  of  the  RPs.  Each  RP  will  include  indicators  for \ninternal  and  external  monitoring.  The  PIUs  will  conduct  their  own  internal  monitoring  of \nresettlement  implementation  and  submit  monthly  reports  to  the  PMU.  The  PMU  will  include  the \nresults of the internal monitoring in its quarterly reports to ADB. The PMU will engage a private firm \nor  nongovernment  organization  as  an  external  monitor.  External  monitoring  reports  will  be \nsubmitted  to  ADB  semiannually.  Investigation  should  be  carried  out  during  resettlement \nimplementation  and  evaluations  should  be  conducted  1  year  after  the  affected  households  have \nbeen resettled.  \n \nK. \n\nResettlement Budget \n\nLocal  governments  and  UMG  will  be  responsible  for  providing  adequate  funds  for  land \n11. \nacquisition  and  resettlement  related  to  the  Project.  Detailed  estimates  will  be  prepared  during \ndetailed subproject design, verified by the PMU, and included in the budget of local governments \nand  UMG  as  part  of  their  contributions  to  the  Project.  The  resettlement  budget  will  include  the \ncosts  for  land  acquisition,  compensation,  relocation,  and  livelihood  and  income  restoration  and \nimprovement.  The  estimate  of  resettlement  costs  for  the  Hailaast  core  subproject  at  the  time  of \nappraisal is about $89,000. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 11       41  \n \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nA. \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n \n\n    No \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the urban development sector to reduce poverty in Mongolia: \n \nGiven  that  the  majority  of  poor  urban  households  live  in  ger  (traditional  tent)  areas,  the  Project  will  have  a  significant \nimpact on poverty reduction. To reduce poverty, the primary objective of the Project is to improve the living conditions \nand quality of life for the poor living in ger areas. The Project will do so through the (i) expansion and provision of basic \nurban services to ger areas where well over half of Mongolia\u2019s urban poor residents live; (ii) tariff reform to lower service \ncharges  to  affordable  levels  for  ger  area  residents;  and  (iii)  promotion  of  low-cost,  alternative  infrastructure  solutions, \nincluding  compost  toilet  systems  and  energy  efficient  stoves,  which  are  affordable  to  poor  ger  area  residents.  The \nProject is designed to have multidimensional impacts on poverty reduction. While infrastructure is provided, the Project \nwill simultaneously (i) increase access to micro-credit for on-plot improvements, (ii) create direct short-term employment \nfor  construction  and  indirect  long-term  income  generating  opportunities,  and  (iii)  empower  poor  residents  in  decision-\nmaking  processes  through  the  establishment  of  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  to  plan  and  implement \ncommunity infrastructure projects. \n \nThe  expected  outcomes  of  the  Project  satisfy  several  of  the  goals  for  poverty  reduction  of  the  Government  and  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for  Mongolia  (2006\u20132008)a  adopts  the  Government\u2019s \ntwo key objectives of higher private sector led growth and inclusive social development, the latter of which encompasses \nthe  Government\u2019s  priority  goals  of  improving  the  quality  of  public  services  and  their  accessibility  for  the  poor.  These \ngoals derive from the Economic Growth Support and Poverty Reduction Strategy, finalized in 2003. Improved access to \nurban services is among the immediate targets that the Project will help to realize. Specifically, the Project will (i) reduce \nthe  numbers  of  urban  poor  in  substandard  housing  by  2008;  and  (ii)  increase  coverage  of  water,  improved  sanitation, \nheating, and improved transportation.  \n \nThe  proposed  Project  will  also  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals,  to  which  the \nGovernment and ADB are committed. In particular, the Project will move Mongolia closer towards achieving Millennium \nDevelopment Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability. The Project will help achieve the three main targets of Goal 7: \n(i) Target 9: Provide information, education, and communication in the proper use of water and sanitation; (ii) Target 10: \nExtend  safe  water  supply  networks  to  underserved  urban  areas,  benefiting  ger  area  households  without  proper  water \nsupply; and (iii) Target 11: Achieve a significant improvement in the lives of the ger area population by implementing a \ncomprehensive  and  coordinated  public  and  private  investment  approach,  and  subproject  towns  will  undergo  a  major \ntransformation of their ger areas. \n \nThe  use  of  small  loans  to  buy  or  improve  existing  stoves,  following  on  the  experience  of  the  World  Bank  project  for \nsmokeless  stoves,  will  reduce  fuel  consumption  and  have  a  direct  impact  on  reducing  poverty  by  increasing  the \ndisposable  income  of  poor  households.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Improved  Stove  Project  demonstrated  that  low-cost  stove \nimprovements  can  reduce  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions  by  54%  and  coal  consumption  by  35\u201340%.  Households \ncurrently consume 5\u201310 tons of coal per year for an average cost of $22 per ton. With an improved stove, annual coal \nconsumption will be reduced to 3\u20136 tons, which will result in a savings of $44\u2013$88 per year per family, or overall annual \nsavings of $1.82 million. \n \nLabor  Savings:  Improvement in water supply under component A will ensure the availability of water on a daily basis \nand  eliminate  the  need  for  an  additional  two  hours  to  fetch  water  per  family  per  week.  On  an  annual  basis,  the  time \nsavings would amount to approximately 0.43 person-months for each household, which translates to an economic value \nof $40 per family. These labor savings would be felt most acutely by children and women, who are primarily responsible \nfor  gathering  water.  Households  will  also  experience  labor  savings  with  improved  stoves.  They  currently  spend  on \naverage  6.9  hours  per  week  collecting  and  preparing  fuel  for  heating.  Assuming  that  reduction  in  fuel  consumption  by \n40% equates to a comparable reduction in the time spent collecting and preparing fuel, the improved stoves would result \nin an estimated labor saving of 0.59 person-months per family per year. Assuming that the amount of time saved is used \nfor productive purposes, the resulting 0.59 person-months of saved labor could generate an average earning of $54 per \nfamily. \n \nDirect  Employment:    Under components A and B of the Project, an estimated 30% of $20 million (about $6.0 million) \nwill  be  used  for  construction-related  labor.  Given  the  average  annual  salary  of  $1,100  for  an  unskilled  laborer,  an \nexpected 5,455 person-years will be created for components A and B. For component C of the Project, about 30% of the \n$3.8 million investment (about $1.1 million) will be used for labor; this amounts to 993 person-years of employment, of \nwhich  about  20%  will  be  unpaid  labor  of  homeowners  to  construct  individual  water  connections.  The  direct  economic \nvalue of the 3,631 person-years of wage employment is thus equivalent to approximately $4.0 million, or roughly $145 \nper household.   \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\n                                  Proposed Classification: General Intervention \n\nHealth Benefits: Assuming that the project improvements could result in a 40% reduction in morbidity starting in 2012,b \nthe net present value of savings in the medical costs and foregone income associated with the absence from work for \nthe  beneficiary  population  as  a  whole  is  an  estimated  $3.35  million,  or  roughly  $122  per  household  (Supplementary \nAppendix  K:  Health  Benefits  and  Monitoring  Plan).  Women  and,  in  particular,  children,  who  are  more  susceptible  to \ninfectious diseases, will benefit greatly from the improved water supply and sanitation.c \n \nIndirect Employment: Improved basic infrastructure and services, and provision of small loans through the Project can \nhave a direct impact on reducing poverty by helping to increase household income and productivity through home-based \nwork. About 62% of surveyed households expressed the desire for on-plot income generating activities. The estimated \nmultiplier  for  income  generation  is  $8  for  every  $1  of  investment.d  Given  total  ADB  investment  of  $28.2 million,  an \nestimated  $226  million  in  income  generation  will  result,  or  $581  per  household.  It  is  expected  that  these  benefits  will \naccrue equally to working age men and women, which means that each working age woman can realize an estimated \n$2,892 in income generation.   \n \nQuality  of  Life:  In addition to the quantifiable benefits, many  intangible  improvements in the overall quality of life can \nalso  result  from  the  Project.  These  benefits  will  include  but  not  be  limited  to  reduced  overcrowding,  better  health, \nincreased productive capacity, better prospects for education and employment for children, enhanced sense of personal \nand community safety, and enhanced sense of social and economic participation.  \n \nB. \nMore than 36% of the total population of Mongolia lives below the poverty line, which varies from $18.58 to $25.00 per \ncapita  per  month.e  While  Ulaanbaatar  has  the  lowest  percentage  of  poor\u201427.3%\u2014of  the  urban  centers,  it  has  the \ngreatest number of poor people in the capital city. The average incidence of poverty in all aimag (province) centers  is \n33.9%. In Mongolia, housing is highly correlated with poverty in urban areas. Almost 90% of the poor live in ger areas in \nUlaanbaatar and the figure is just over 80% in aimag centers. An average of 78.3% of the cities\u2019 poor residents lives in \nger areas.  \n \nIn urban areas, only a quarter of the poor have access to  piped  water from central sources compared  with half of the \nnonpoor.  Among  project  beneficiaries,  88%  rely  on  trucked  water  (either  to  kiosks  or  delivered  to  houses)  as  their \nprimary source of water, which is lower quality and less reliable than the central piped water supply. Ger area residents \npay  disproportionately  high  tariffs  for  water\u2014anywhere  from  MNT0.5  to  MNT2.0  per  liter  of  water,  compared  with \nMNT0.10  to  MNT0.20  per  liter  among  apartment  dwellers.  Meanwhile,  per  capita  water  consumption  in  ger  areas  is \nsignificantly  lower\u2014about  4.7  liters  per  day  (lpd)  compared  with  the  normative  240  lpd  among  apartment  dwellers.f \nMoreover, ger area residents spend from 12\u201334 minutes on average gathering water from kiosks located an average of \n284 meters away. \n \nHeating is another differentiating factor for the rich and poor. Ger area residents primarily use highly-polluting stoves for \nheating and cooking, burning 5\u201310 tons of coal per year at an average cost of $21.67 per ton and 4\u201316 cubic meter (m3) \nof  wood  at  an  average  cost  of  $12.14  per  m3.  Average  household  monthly  expenditure  on  heating  is  about  6%  of \nexpenditure or $10.36 in Erdenet.g By contrast, nonpoor families, which are predominantly apartment dwellers, spend 3\u2013\n4% of their expenditure on heating.h In addition, ger area residents also spend about 7 hours per  week on average to \ncollect and prepare their fuel.   \n \nOther basic infrastructure lacking in ger areas includes sanitation, paved roads, street lighting, and drainage. Virtually all \nhouseholds use unimproved, and in many cases, dilapidated pit latrines. Ger area households suffer the negative health \nconsequences  associated  with  unsafe  drinking  water,  poor  sanitation,  little  to  no  solid  waste  management,  and  air \npollution created by the stoves.   \n \nThe  average  income  of  poor  households  in  aimag  centers  is  an  estimated  $84.25,  compared  to  nonpoor  households, \nwhose incomes are about $221.77 on average. A breakdown of monthly income shows that households rely extensively \non  informal  sector  income\u2014sale  of  agricultural  and  nonagricultural  products  together  comprise  almost  half  (48%)  of \naverage  income.  Formal  sector  wages  comprise  just  12%  of  income,  followed  by  noncash  income  (9%)  and  pension \n(8%). The unemployment rate is about 23% among the working age beneficiary population.   \n \nAlmost  all  interviewed  households  agreed  that  infrastructure  improvements  are  required  in  the  community.  The  top \npriority  for  neighborhood  improvement  among  all  subproject  areas  is  water  supply,  which  is  the  primary  intervention \nproposed  under  component  A.  Other  main  priorities  include  roads,  street  lighting,  solid  waste,  and  sanitation.  Focus \ngroup  discussions  reaffirmed  the  results  of  the  survey.  An  overwhelming  majority  (93%)  of  households  expressed \nwillingness to join a CBO to help plan and manage neighborhood improvements. \n \nParticipation Process \nC. \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy?                \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 11       43  \n \n\n \n\nAn  analysis  of  the  key  stakeholders  informed  both  the  project  preparation  and  design.  These  include:  (i)  ger  area \nresidents,  (ii)  CBOs,  (iii)  savings  groups,  (iv)  local  governments,  (v)  public  urban  service  organizations  (PUSOs), \n(vi) Ministry of Construction and Urban Development, and (vii) Ministry of Finance. The stakeholder analysis defined the \nroles  of  each  of  the  stakeholders  and  established  the  framework  for  participation  at  the  local  level  of  authorities  and \ncommunities from the subproject selection stage through implementation.   \n \nThe Project adopted a bottom-up approach in which local governments and communities were requested to confirm their \nwillingness  to  participate  in  the  Project  by  fulfilling  a  series  of  pre-project  conditions.  The  submission  of  a  project \nproposal  that  included  ger  area  improvement  and  community  participation  was  essential  to  be  selected  as  one  of  the \ncore  subprojects.  Once  core  subprojects  were  selected,  communities  were  engaged  in  project  preparation  through  a \nhousehold survey and focus group discussions, which revealed community needs, priorities, and willingness to pay for \nimproved infrastructure and services. Other stakeholders\u2014including local government officials, community leaders, and \nthe local PUSOs\u2014were consulted extensively during field visits to develop subproject proposals that reflect the priorities \nand capacities of all key stakeholders.  \n \nThe  project  design  is  based  on  a  community-driven  approach,  at  the  core  of  which  is  the  establishment  and \nstrengthening  of  CBOs  under  component  C  of  the  Project.  The  primary  role  of  the  CBOs  will  be  to  serve  as  the \ncommunity representative to the local government, the PUSO, and the project implementation unit. The CBOs will be the \nessential facilitator for the block loans available under component C. They will serve as the intermediary between blocks \nof households that  wish to take a loan from the Project for the installation of individual water connections (and on-plot \nsanitation  facilities  and  energy  efficient  stoves  for  the  individual  households  if  desired)  and  the  local  PUSO,  which  will \ninstall the tertiary pipelines.   \n \nThe Project will strengthen the CBOs\u2019 capacity to plan and implement community infrastructure and income generation \nprojects.  The  CBOs  will  empower  community  members  to  make  decisions  about  the  type,  location,  and  design  of \ncommunity  amenities\u2014including,  initially,  water  kiosks,  and  later,  income  generation  activities,  such  as  community \ncenters, greenhouses, and compost facilities. As the capacity of the CBOs grows, each will evolve over time and adopt \nfurther  roles  based  on  the  demands  of  its  members.  Public  awareness  activities  and  community  trainings  under \ncomponent  D  of  the  Project  related  to  micro-finance,  alternative  sanitation  and  heating  solutions,  and  improved  health \nand  hygiene  will  further  engage  community  members  and  enhance  the  sustainability  of  the  Project.  Community \nmobilizers  in  each  project  implementation  unit  will  assist  in  implementing  the  community  participation  and  public \nawareness subcomponents of the Project.   \n \nD.  \nThe provision of potable water and other basic infrastructure will have a direct positive impact on women and children, \nand will reduce women\u2019s labor inputs and promote more effective time budgeting. Women and children, who are more \nsusceptible to infectious diseases, will experience significant health benefits with improved water supply and sanitation. \nWomen will become empowered decision makers at the household and community levels with access to credit to make \nhousing and other on-plot improvements and representation through CBOs to improve neighborhood amenities. Specific \nsteps in the Project to ensure that the intended benefits will accrue to women and that they participate fully in the Project \ninclude: (i) ensuring equal representation of women on the CBO Council to ensure that women are empowered decision \nmakers  in  the  community,  (ii)  promoting  health  and  hygiene  awareness  equally  among  men  and  women,  (iii)  ensuring \nthat  qualified  women  have  the  same  opportunity  for  construction-related  labor,  (iv)  providing  training  to  women  in \nentrepreneurial activities on a demand-driven basis, and (v) engaging a community and gender specialist to help monitor \nand evaluate implementation of the gender action plan. \n                                                                                              \n\nGender and Development \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes         \n\n   No  \n\nSocial Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\nStrategy to address issues \n\nPlan Required \n\nProject design minimizes land acquisition and \nresettlement.

Based on the socioeconomic \nsurvey,  there  is  no  significant  evidence  that  female-headed  households  are  poorer  than  male-\nheaded  households.  However,  there  is  evidence  that  women  share  a  disproportionate  load  of \nhousehold  responsibilities.  In  addition  to  financial  contributions,  women  are  also  responsible  for \nmost  of  the  household  work,  including  cooking,  cleaning,  washing,  shopping,  and  looking  after \nchildren and the elderly. Men have taken a lesser role in household activities, usually fetching fuel \nand doing some minor repairs in ger areas.1 This demonstrated that women are the main users of \ninfrastructure  services.  In  ger  areas,  the  burden  on  women  is  compounded  by  a  lack  of  basic \ninfrastructure that would normally make household work easier and more efficient. A gender action \nplan (GAP) is prepared to maximize the project impact on women. \n  \nB. \n\nPreparation \n\n2. \nThe primary users of infrastructure will maintain it more effectively and should therefore be \ninvolved  in  design,  operation,  and  management  of  upgrading  activities.  Women  were  actively \nengaged  in  the  planning  processes  of  the  Project.  Based  on  the  issues  identified  by  the  gender \nassessment of project preparation, gender concerns were woven into two main components of the \npoverty and social analysis: (i) household survey; and (ii) focus group discussions, to establish a \nbaseline on gender disaggregated data that is related to informal settlement (ger area) upgrading \nand  to  help  determine  how  gender  concerns  should  be  incorporated  into  the  project  design.  The \nhousehold questionnaire included several questions intended to elicit specific information related to \ngender  roles,  perceptions,  and  expectations.  Focus  group  discussions  among  women  in  the \ncommunity  allowed  the  study  team  to  disaggregate  responses  by  gender  and  ensure  that  the \nvoices of women in target beneficiary communities were heard.   \n \nC. \n\nProject Benefit to Women \n\nWomen are expected derive particular benefit from the Project\u2019s proposed improvements in \n3. \ncommunity infrastructure and services as they and their children spend most of their time at home \nand  in  the  neighborhood.  The  proposed  Project  will  provide  opportunities  to  (i)  relieve  time  and \nlabor  burdens  on  women  created  by  the  lack  of  access  to  basic  infrastructure  and  services;  (ii) \nimprove  women\u2019s  living  conditions,  health,  and  hygiene;  (iii)  create  employment  and  income \ngeneration opportunities for women; and (iv) empower women as decision makers through access \nto finance and active involvement in community-based organizations (CBOs).  \n \nThe  improved  daily  living  environment,  as  a  result  of  the  Project,  will  reduce  the  risk  of \n4. \ninfectious  diseases  for  women  and  children,  while  time  and  labor  savings  will  result  in  reduced \nhousehold  workloads  for  women  and  children.  In  turn,  they  will  have  more  time  to  engage  in \nproductive income-generating activities, home-based work, and caring for family members. Female \nheads of household will derive particular benefit from the Project. \n \n5. \nSanitation  in  ger  area  is  a  big  challenge  for  women,  who  are  primarily  responsible  for \nmaintaining  hygiene  in  the  home.  New  sanitation  solutions  proposed  by  the  Project  will  ease  the \nburdens  faced  by  women  in  undertaking  their  household  duties.

Erdenet  has  been  selected  as  a  representative  core  subproject \nlocation where the subcomponents of water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management will be \ndeveloped. The primary road to Hailaast ger district of Ulaanbaatar has been chosen as the core \nsubproject  for  improvement  of  urban  roads.  Initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  have  been \ncarried out to assess the potential environmental impacts and risks that may arise through project \npreparation, implementation, and operation.  \n \nB. \n\nSector Assessment \n\n2. \nThe  Government\u2019s  medium  term  strategy  adopted  in  1995  recognized  that  the  necessary \nresources  are  not  available  to  replace  the  growing  number  of  ger  area  houses  with  subsidized \napartments.  It  concluded  that  greater  encouragement  of  individual  initiative  in  the  urban \ndevelopment  sector  is  needed  if  Mongolia\u2019s  urban  problems  are  to  be  addressed.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  action  plan  2004\u20132008  has  developed  a  program  to  provide  40,000  families  with \nopportunities to live in houses with proper facilities. The Project will focus on urban development in \nurban areas scattered across Mongolia, characterized by open landscapes with minimal vegetation \nin  steppe  or  desert  locations.  Different  climatic  zones  result  in  annual  precipitation  varying  from \n400  millimeter  to  120\u2013200  millimeter.  The  dominant  physical  environment  is  summarized  as \nmoderate to harsh.  \n \n3. \nTowns  typically  comprise  a  formal  urban  centre  with  institutional  buildings,  residential \napartment blocks, roads, and service infrastructure. They also include extensive and sprawling ger \nareas  of  informal  hashaas  (residential  plots)  which  are  provided  with  only  rudimentary \ninfrastructure. Up to 90% of the total population of a town is, or in the medium term will be, resident \nin  such  ger  areas,  and  approximately  70%  of  total  households  are  considered  poor.2 The  urban \nenvironment is degrading as a result of low density of dwellings\u2014leaving much open space which \nis  not  maintained,  lack  of  sufficient  infrastructural  amenities  and  facilities,  unconfined  animal \nhusbandry,  unemployment,  and  poor  socioeconomic  conditions.  The  primary  source  of  potable \nwater  is  tanker-supplied  kiosks.  The  average  distance  to  collect  water  is  275  meter  and  queuing \ntimes  of  up  to  1  hour  are  experienced.

This screening was assessed under stages of project development: (i) project \npreparation and design phase; (ii) project construction phase, and (iii) operation and management \nof  the  completed  works.  The  environmental  assessment  included  consideration  of  alternative \ntechnologies and options for solution, including water resources, the means of water distribution in \nger  areas,  domestic  sanitation  and  grey  water  disposal,  sanitation  and  sewerage  to  institutional \nestablishments,  and  the  disposal  of  domestic  solid  wastes.  Least-cost  solutions  compatible  with \neffective and sustainable service provision were selected. The IEEs also assessed the impacts that \nwere  most  likely  to  cause  construction  problems.  These  considered  the  creation  of  dust;  noise; \nconflicts  of  traffic  movements;  restricted  access;  and  the  impact  on  the  town  of  numerous \nconstruction workers, including health and safety requirements.  Mitigating measures are required \nmainly during the construction period and these have been identified and costed in the IEEs. The \ntotal cost allocated for these measures under the construction budgets is $342,000. \n\nE. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Review Procedures \n\n \n\nThe environmental assessment and review procedures of potential subprojects will, among \n\n9. \nother things, ascertain if the subproject:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\ninvolves either water supply, wastewater, or solid waste management for the aimag \n(province)  capitals,  and  urban  roads  connecting  ger  area  with  the  city  center  or \nlocated in the city center in Ulaanbaatar; \nconforms to an adopted relevant city or sector master plans; \ndoes not have potential for significant adverse environmental impact; \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nis  not  environmentally  sensitive  and  will  not  result  in  increased  generation  of \nwastewater or solid waste; and \ndoes not require any significant resettlement, either temporary or permanent, and in \nany case not greater than 200 affected persons. \n\n10. \nThe Ministry of Nature and Environment is responsible for screening and approvals during \nthe  subproject  preparation  and  implementation  stage  while  that  for  subsequent  inspection  and \nenforcement  lies  with  the  State  Inspection  Agency.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  will  review  the \nIEEs and summary initial environmental examination.  \n \nF. \n\nEnvironmental Management Program \n\nThe  environmental  management  program  (EMP)  covers  all  phases  of  the  Project  from \n11. \npreparation  and  construction  to  commissioning  and  operation,  and  aims  to  ensure  control  of \npotential environmental impacts through monitoring and mitigation implementation. Separate EMPs \nwill  be  prepared  for  each  subproject  and  will  be  incorporated  into  the  construction  and  operation \nmanagement plans of the subproject as appropriate. The project management unit will ensure that \nthe  Project\u2019s  progress  and  impacts  are  monitored.  Costs  related  to  mitigation  measures  for  the \nconstruction phase will be borne by contractors while costs for the operation phase will be borne by \nthe implementing agencies. \n\n12. \nDirect public and stakeholder participation was conducted as an ongoing element of project \npreparation.  Three  workshops  were  held  in  Ulaanbaatar  and  one  in  Erdenet.  Plans  for  public \ninvolvement  during  the  design,  construction,  and  operation  phases  have  been  developed  during \nthe  project  preparation  stage.  These  plans  include  public  participation  in:  (i)  monitoring  impacts \nand  mitigation  measures  during \nthe  construction  and  operation  stages;  (ii)  evaluating \nenvironmental and economic benefits and social impacts; and (iii) interviewing the public after the \nProject is completed.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nG. \n\nConclusions \n\n13. \nOn a per capita basis, the Project will decrease the demands upon energy resources by the \nreplacement  of  a  truck  tanker  by  a  piped  system.  The  Project  will  specifically  not  increase  the \nincome  gap  between  poor  and  affluent  sectors.  It  is  concluded  that  the  sector  Project  comprises \nsubprojects  that  may  be  classified  as  category  B  for  the  purpose  of  environmental  impact. \nHowever,  because  of  the  environmentally  sensitive  components  such  as  potential  for  raw  water \nquality,  wastewater  treatment,  and  solid  waste  management  aspects,  the  EMP  will  be  fully \nimplemented. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\n Introduction \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nAppendix 14       51  \n \n\n \n\nThe  financial  analysis  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n1. \n(ADB) Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed \nby  ADB. 1  Details  of  the  financial  analysis  and  financial  projections  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix P. An assessment of financial performance was completed for the public urban services \norganizations  (PUSOs)  which  currently  operate  as  enterprises  providing  water  supply  and \nsanitation  services  in  the  urban  areas.  The  analysis  was  undertaken  for  the  core  subproject  in \nErdenet.  For  the  urban  roads  which  are  non-revenue  generating,  financial  sustainability  was \nassessed  based  on  the  financial  capacity  of  the  Road  Department,  Ulaanbaatar  municipal \ngovernment  (UMG)  to  provide  sufficient  funds  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the \nproject roads in the future. \n   \nB.  \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis \n\n1.  \n\nObjective and Approach \n\n2. \nThe  financial  evaluation  assessed  the  financial  performance  of  the  PUSO  following \nimplementation of the water supply and sanitation subcomponents. The evaluation determines the \nlevel  of  cost  recovery  from  water  users  that  is  required  to  service  the  ADB  loan  and  achieve \nfinancial  sustainability.  The  financial  evaluations  of  the  subproject  were  carried  out  in  real  terms \nusing  2006  prices  over  27  years  of  operations,  including  a  6-year  implementation  period.  The \nresidual value of physical assets is assumed to equal the remaining book or depreciated value at \nthe end of the evaluation period.   \n \n\n2.   Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n\nThe weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was calculated in real terms for the Project. \n3. \nFunding  sources  for  the  water  infrastructure  subcomponent  are  the  ADB  loan  (72%)  and \ncounterpart funds from the Government (28%).2 The Ministry of Finance will relend the ADB loan to \nPUSOs at 3.25% (ADB rate of 1.5% plus 1.75%).3 The local inflation rate is 6.0% per annum and \nthe international inflation rate is 2.4%. The WACC was determined to be 0.25% for the base case \nanalysis. \n \n\n3.  \n\nTariffs and Affordability \n\n4. \nThe Government has a decree that provides guidelines to PUSOs on water tariff calculation \nand setting.4 However, there are no established tariff setting bodies that will review and undertake \nconsultations with users on the appropriateness of any proposed tariff increase. Hence, whenever \nPUSOs  request  aimag  (province)  approval  for  tariff  changes,  in  most  cases  the  required  tariff \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2002.

Ministry of Finance. 26 July  2006. The onlending is the ADB rate + 1.75% minimum to \n3.00% maximum. \n\n4   Based  on  Decree  on  Methodology  for  Tariff  Calculation  and  Setting  by  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  in  2004,  the \nGovernment  has  provided  guidance  on  tariff  calculations  that  PUSOs  have  to  follow.  However,  their  proposed  tariff \nincreases have not been fully implemented by aimags, mainly for political reasons.  \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nincreases  have  not  been  fully  implemented.  Thus,  aimags  have  to  subsidize  any  shortfall  in \nPUSOs\u2019 tariff revenues to sustain operations or pay debt obligations. \n \n5. \nIn  Erdenet,  the  Erdenet  PUSO  currently  obtains  water  from  Erdenet  Mining  Corporation\u2019s \nwell field and transmission lines to supply apartments and public and private organizations, which \nconsume  approximately  1,193,896  cubic  meters  (m3) (2005).5 The  ger  (traditional  tent)  areas  are \nsupplied from small deep wells, with annual supply of about 78,191 m3. Private organizations (39% \nof  total  consumption)  and  apartments  (35%)  are  the  largest  consumers,  followed  by  budget \norganizations  (20%)  and  ger  areas  (6%).  Based  on  the  tariff  schedule,  people  in  ger  areas  pay \nabout MNT2,000/m3 or about 10 times more than those in apartments who pay MNT210/m3.6 While \nthe high tariff is due in part to the high cost of transporting water to ger areas by tanker trucks, the \npattern  of  ger  area  households  paying  on  average  14  times  more  for  water  than  apartment \ndwellers is common in all provincial towns. \n \n6. \nAs shown in Table A14.1, according to existing tariffs and consumption data, the PUSO\u2019s \ngross  tariff  revenues  are  highest  for  private  organizations  with  MNT235  million  (with  highest \nconsumption)  and  ger  areas  of  MNT156.38  million  (with  highest  tariff  but  lowest  consumption). \nApartment users consume 5.7 times more than people in ger areas but pay only MNT93.5 million. \nSince  the  PUSO  pays  MNT196.6  million  to  Erdenet  Mining  Corporation  for  apartment  water \nconsumption, about MNT103 million is subsidized by the aimag, or some MNT230/m3.   \n \n\nTable A14.1: Existing Tariffs and Projected Tariffs for the FIRR Analysis (MNT/m3) \n\nItem \nActual Tariff \nApartments \nPublic Organizations \nPrivate Organizations \nGer (traditional tent) Areas \nPayment to Mining Company \nApartments \nPublic Organizations \nPrivate Organizations \nGer Areas                                              \nApartments \nApartments \nPublic Organizations \nPrivate Organizations                           \nGer Areas                                             \nTariff Based on Full Cost Recovery  \nApartments \nPublic Organizations \nPrivate Organizations \nGer Areas                                               \n\nErdenet \n \n     210.0 \n449.3 \n479.3 \n2,000.0 \n \n440.3  \n383.0 \n408.6 \n   \u2014 \n484.3     \n500.0 \n500.0 \n500.0 \n500.0   \n\n2,012.0 \n500.0 \n600.0 \n700.0 \n500.0 \n\n(230 lpcd) \n\n \n \n \n \nAimag (province) subsidizes about MNT230/m3 \n \n \n \n\n(100 lpcd) \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n     lpcd = liter per capita per day, m3 = cubic meter. \n     Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n7. \nExisting  PUSO  tariff  revenues  are  not  adequate  to  support  services  considering  that \n(i) apartment  users  are  subsidized  at  rate  of  about  MNT230/m3;  (ii)  institutions  and  apartment \ndwellers  do  not  fully  pay  the  water  bills  to  PUSOs,  resulting  in  high  accounts  receivables;  and \n                                                 \n5   Data  used  is  2005  consumption  levels  in  Erdenet.  Budget  organizations  are  schools,  hospitals,  and  government \n\noffices. They obtain their budget (including payment for water bills) directly from the state budget.  \n\n6   Water  billing  is  based  on  normative  consumption  for  apartments  of  230  liters  per  capita  per  day  (MNT1,453 \nperson/month).  Budget  and  private  organizations  are  billed  based  on  individual  contracts  (e.g.,  schools  based  on \nschool population, etc.). Estimated consumption per person is 6.9 m3/month. Budget organizations and apartments are \ncharged lower water rates than private organizations. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 14       53  \n \n\n \n\n(iii) the unaccounted for water is estimated at 60% since water is not metered and billing is based \non normative consumption rates for apartment users. \n \n8. \nUnder  the  Project,  a  new  water  supply  source  will  be  developed,  and  water  mains  and \ndistribution  lines  will  connect  the  major  apartment  areas  and  water  kiosks  in  ger  areas.7 Project \ncompletion  will  be  2012,  and  it  is  anticipated  that  it  will  lower  the  cost  of  supplying  water  to  ger \nareas  and  other  water  users.  Considering  the  current  distortions  in  tariff  setting,  with  apartments \nheavily  subsidized,  apartment  tariffs  will  be  gradually  increased  during  project  implementation  to \neliminate subsidies and adjust tariffs to full cost recovery levels for O&M and depreciation during \nconstruction. By 2009, when loan repayment begins, tariffs must cover interest repayments. After \n2012, tariffs should cover principal repayments (or depreciation, whichever is higher) to ensure that \nthe  PUSO  can  finance  operations  and  debt  repayment  and  become  commercially  viable \nenterprises.  This  is  reasonable  since  the  Project  will  improve  (i)  service  delivery,  (ii)  efficiency \ngains, (iii) tariff restructuring and reforms, and (vi) education and awareness of tariff increases. The \naffordability of households in ger areas and apartments are analyzed based on the socioeconomic \nsurvey  results  of  household  income  and  estimated  water  consumption  in  ger  areas.  Table  A14.2 \nshows  that  poor  households  in  ger  areas  with  an  average  income  of  MNT82,923/month  ($71.5) \npay  about  2.7%  of  their  income  for  water  while  nonpoor  households  with  MNT270,300/month \n($232.8) pay less than 1% of their income based on actual low water consumption. Willingness to \npay is up to MNT3,000/m3 if better service, in terms of water quantity and quality, is provided. \n \n\nTable A14.2: Tariffs and Affordability \n\nItem \nExisting: Ger area \nHH monthly consumption                                               \nHH monthly water expense   \nNonpoor HH income \nPoor HH Income \nNonpoor affordability (5% of income)                 \nPoor affordability (5% of income)                             \nWillingness to pay \nAffordability based on current water expense/ month \nNonpoor HH \nPoor HH \nGer Area Proposed Minimum, Monthly Consumption \nHH proposed minimum monthly consumption                                     \nHH monthly water expense (MNT) \n% to poor HH Income \nApartments \nExisting monthly expense on water@MNT210/m3 and 230 lpcd \n% of water expense to average HH income \nHH proposed average water consumption   \nHH monthly water expense  \n% of water expense to average HH Income \n\nErdenet \n \n1 m3 at 4.7 lpcd \nMNT2,000 \nMNT270,030 \nMNT82,923 \nMNT13,500 \nMNT4,150 \nUp to MNT3/m3 \n \n<1% \n2.4% \n \n4.5 m3 at 30 lpcd \nMNT2,250 \n2.7% \n \nMNT7,245 \n2.7% \n15m3 at 100 lpcd \nMNT7,500 \n2.8% \n\n  HH = household, lpcd = liters per capita per day, m3 = cubic meter. \n  Source:  Asian Development Bank project preparatory technical assistance Socioeconomic Survey, 2006. \n \n\n9. \nPeople  in  apartments  who  have  higher  affordability  and  can  pay  up  to  MNT13,500/month \n(5% of household income) are paying MNT7,245/month or 2.7% of their affordability but consuming \nmore than three times the liters per capita per day (lpcd) as people in ger areas.8 \n \n                                                 \n7   For  sanitation,  PUSO  will  connect  schools,  hospitals,  and  private  organizations  to  main  sewerage  and  PUSO  will \n\ncontinue to pay to the mining company which owns the sewerage treatment plant.  \n\n8   With  the  water  supply  improvements,  people  in  ger  areas  are  assumed  to  consume  a  minimum  of  30  lpcd  at \n\nMNT500/m3 or MNT2,250/month) which is 2.7% of their monthly income. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \n\n4. \n\nFinancial Rate of Return \n\n10. \nEstimates  of  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  were  made  for  base  case  and \nsensitivity  scenarios  which  assume  the  required  gradual  tariff  increases  at  the  outset  of  project \nimplementation (Table A14.1). The recommended tariff increases are required to ensure that they \ncover  the  full  cost  of  O&M  and  depreciation,  interest,  and  principal  during  loan  repayment.  The \naimag\u2019s  tariff  review  committee  will  institute  public  consultations  to  meet  the  required  tariff \nincreases of the PUSO. The financial analysis assumes that the PUSO will be able to charge the \nfull  cost  recovery  tariffs  and  undertake  the  operational  improvements,  such  as  reducing  system \nlosses  and  unaccounted  for  water  to  increase  water  revenue,  reduce  accounts  receivable,  and \nundertake  individual  connections  and  metering  during  project  implementation.  These  measures \nmust be initiated prior to project implementation to ensure the financial sustainability of the PUSO\u2019s \noperations.  Base case FIRR and financial performance indicators for the subproject are provided \nin  Table  A14.3.  The  after-tax  FIRR  results  for  Erdenet  water  supply  compare  favorably  to  the \nWACC of 0.25%. The subprojects are therefore financially viable based on returns to net assets, \nand the debt-service coverage ratios are adequate. \n \n\nTable A14.3: Summary of Financial Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis (%) \nItem \nBase Case \nProject Costs, and Operation and Maintenance Costs +10% \nRevenues -10% \nCost +10% and Revenue -10% \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nErdenet \n8.1 \n6.5 \n6.3 \n4.7 \n\n \nC. \n\nFinancial Projections of PUSO \n\n11. \nThe  financial  ratios  are  those  for  which  specific  assurances  are  being  covenanted: \n(i) minimum  debt-service  coverage  ratio  of  1.2,  (ii)  maximum  debt  over  debt  plus  equity  ratio  of \n70/30,  (iii)  and  minimum  current  ratio  of  2.

The \nroad fund increased from MNT2.59 billion in 2000 to MNT2.82 billion in 2005; the allocation from \nthe state budget accounted for about 3% and road users\u2019 taxes accounted for about 97%. The road \nfund revenues are mainly used for road construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance of city roads; \nand  partly  to  form  part  of  counterpart  funds  for  foreign-assisted  road  projects.  In  2006,  MNT3.03 \nbillion  (about  $2.6  million)  has  been  requested  by  Road  Department  of  UMG,  of  which  MNT2.12 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 14       55  \n \n\n \n\nbillion is earmarked for road construction and rehabilitation while MNT909 million is earmarked for \nroad maintenance. UMG will ensure that road maintenance funding from the road fund is increased \nby at least 5% per annum from MNT909 million in 2006 to MNT1.22 billion in 2012 to be able to \nmeet  the  projected  increase  in  O&M  costs  of  the  project  roads,  which  is  estimated  at  about \nMNT40.70 million per year (about $41,000). \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n\nThe  economic  analysis  covers  both  the  Project  as  a  whole  and  the  individual  key \n1. \nsubprojects. It was undertaken in accordance with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Guidelines \nfor the Economic Analysis of Projects, the Handbook for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply \nProjects,  and  Framework  for  Economic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of  Urban  Development  Sector \nProjects.1 For  the  Project  as  a  whole,  the  analysis  covers  (i)  the  rationale  for  public  intervention; \n(ii) the  goals  of  the  investment  plan;  and  (iii)  the  general  design  of  the  plan,  including  selection \ncriteria for subprojects. The economic analysis then evaluates the typical key subprojects relative \nto  the  selection  criteria,  focusing  on  the  least-cost  analysis.  During  the  design  of  the  Project, \nalternative  locations  and  specifications  for  the  water  supply  and  urban  roads  components  were \nconsidered within the project area. The detailed economic analysis and least-cost analysis are in \nSupplementary Appendix L. \n \nB. \n\nRationale for Public Intervention \n\n2. \nThe  primary  motivation  for  the  Project  results  from  increasing  concern  over  the  effects  of \npopulation  and  economic  growth  on  the  inadequacy  of  public  services  in  provincial  towns, \nparticularly the ger (traditional tent) areas. Continuing urbanization has resulted in increasing water \nshortages  as  well  as  major  deficiencies  in  urban  road  network  and  services.  The  1995  medium-\nterm  strategy  was  the  first  important  statement  on  urban  development  in  Mongolia  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  2003  Strategy  for  Economic  Growth  Support  and  Poverty  Reduction  called  for \nreducing disparities in living conditions, and creating enabling environments to support small and \nmedium-sized enterprise development for both urban and rural settlements.   \n \n3. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Action  Plan  for  2004\u20132008  has  prescribed  upgrading  the  quality  of \npublic  services  by  strengthening  the  capacity  and  accountability  of  public  service  institutions  and \ncivil  servants,  expanding  civil  participation  at  all  levels  of  decision  making  and  ensuring \ntransparency  and  conducting  social  policy  targeted  at  improving  living  standards  of  families  and \nhouseholds,  providing  adequate  infrastructure,  reducing  harmful  waste,  and  providing  ecological \neducation  to  residents.2 In  support  of  this  plan,  ADB  and  the  Ministry  of  Construction  and  Urban \nDevelopment (MCUD) developed the Urban Development and Housing Strategy which focused on \nger upgrading that can be replicated across urban centers throughout Mongolia. The strategy links \ninfrastructure  and  on-plot  facility  improvement  in  a  more  cost-effective  manner,  encourages  local \ninitiatives,  and  supports  public  and  private  collaboration  in  sharing  improvement  costs  in  a  more \nequitable and affordable manner.3 \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB.  1997.

Manila.  \n\n2   A  consultative  approach  to  urban  development  has  been  introduced  in  Ulaanbaatar  and  five  secondary  cities  and \nsponsored  by  Cities  Alliance  and  the  World  Bank.  Cities  Alliance  and  the  United  Nations  Human  Settlements \nProgramme  (UN  HABITAT)  are  currently  undertaking  a  second  project  for  Ulaanbaatar  that  will  focus  on  developing \nthe guidelines for upgrading ger areas based on a collaborative, community driven approach. \n\n3   Targets  10,  11,  and  12  of  Mongolia\u2019s  Millennium  Development  Goal  Number  7,  to  \u201cEnsure  Environmental \nSustainability\u201d  impact  on  housing  and  urban  development,  e.g.,  the  use  of  smokeless  stoves  to  reduce  air  pollution, \npromotion  of  energy  efficient  housing,  provision  of  safe  and  dependable  piped  water  supply,  and  environmentally \nsound means of sanitation. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 15       57  \n \n\n \n\nC. \n\nSector Policies, Sector Investment Plan, and Institutional Capacity \n\n \n\n3. \n\nSector Policies \n\nWithin  the  framework  of  the  2004\u20132008  Action  Plan,  the  Government  has  developed  a \n4. \nprogram  to  provide  40,000  families  with  opportunities  to  live  in  houses  with  proper  facilities.  The \nprogram  has  three  main  components:  (i)  new  apartments  (10,000  units),  (ii)  moderately  priced \nhousing (15,000 units), and (iii) improvement of ger area housing and infrastructure (15,000 units). \nMCUD  has  accorded  high  priority  to  the  program  and  plans  to  implement  it  through  domestic \nresources  and  external  assistance.  On  27  June  2005,  parliament  passed  the  \u201c40,000  Houses\u201d \nProgram Law approving the 40,000 Houses Program and making it official sector policy. The law \nsets  out  in  detail  the  rationale  for  the  Program  and  how  it  will  be  implemented.  While  previous \ngovernment  strategies  voiced  support  for  investment  in  urban  development,  including  the  1999 \nHousing  Policy  Law,  the  40,000  Houses  Law  provides  a  detailed  program  for  provision  and \nimprovement  of  on-plot  facilities  and  urban  infrastructure  with  particular  focus  on  ger  areas.  By \nproviding  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities  to  27,000  plots,  the  Project  will  overachieve  the \ntarget  of  improving  the  infrastructure  and  housing  for  15,000  ger  area  units  and,  through  small \nloans  for  on-plot  facility  improvement,  go  a  long  way  towards  achieving  the  15,000  target  of \nmoderately priced housing. \n \n \n\nSector Investment Plan \n\n2. \n\n5. \nFrom  2006  to  2009,  the  Government  laid  out  the  required  budget  requirements  for  urban \ndevelopment  sector,  which  include  key  improvements  in  urban  infrastructure  and  services  in  the \nprovincial  towns.  The  goals  most  directly  relevant  to  the  investment  plan  were  formulated  by  the \nGovernment  and  approved  by  provincial  governments  in  2004.  As  called  for  in  the  Public  Sector \nManagement and Finance Law, 2003, all provincial governments have developed three-year action \nplans under the public investment program, which have become the basis for urban infrastructure \ninvestments. MCUD has proposed allotments for MCUD under the Public Investment Program for \nspecific urban investments from 2006\u20132009 are shown in Appendix 2. Within the Plan, the Project \nis  an  integrated  urban  improvement  project  for  the  ger  areas  and  will  bring  about  affordable  and \nquality  improvements  to  ger  households  that  can:  (i)  provide  households  with  a  sustainable  and \nrecognized financial asset, (ii) support government efforts to privatize land, (iii) improve the quality \nof urban services in water supply, sanitation and road networks, and (iv) stimulate increased local \nprivate investment. \n \nThe  Project  involves  government  intervention  at  several  different  levels.  The  Government \n6. \nthrough MCUD is promoting urban development in the provincial towns in a more coordinated and \ncost-effective  manner,  and  integrating  local  government  and  beneficiary  efforts  for  more \nsustainable  investments  in  public  infrastructure.  Involvement  of  the  Government  is  justified  since \nthe urban development program spans several provinces. The local aimag (province) governments \nare  coordinating  and  implementing  the  elements  of  the  urban  master  plans.  The  public  urban \nservices  organizations  (PUSOs)  are  making  individual  investments  in  the  water  supply  and \nsanitation  works,  and  will  be  involved  in  owning  and  managing  the  completed  facilities.4 Further, \nthe  Project  promotes  a  multifaceted  effort  that  combines  city  level  improvement  in  urban \ninfrastructure  with  community  and  household  initiatives  that  are  largely  financed  through  small \nloans. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  The  Company  Law  (1999)  provided  for  the  corporatization  of  PUSOs  to  become  financially  and  managerially \n\nautonomous enterprises. \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nInstitutional Capacity \n\n7. \nSince  MCUD  is  a  central  government  ministry,  the  investment  plan  will  be  implemented \nmainly  through  Ulaanbaatar  municipal  government  (UMG)  and  aimag  governments  through  local \nPUSOs. Since construction capacity is limited in outlying aimags, project implementation is usually \ncarried  out  by  Ulaanbaatar-based  construction  firms.  Through  the  system  of  aimag  government \nand PUSOs, private contractors, and engineering consultants, MCUD has adequate capacity and \nexperience  to  implement  the  investment  plan.  However,  for  the  investment  plan  as  well  as  the \nProject, there is a need for institutional strengthening at the local government level, especially in: (i) \noperation  and  maintenance  of  urban  infrastructure  and  facilities;  (ii)  community  participatory \nstructures  and  process;  (iii)  environmental  monitoring  issues;  (iv)  functional  areas  covering \nadministration,  finance,  accounting,  and  business  planning;  and  (v)  management  information \nsystem, and cost management and control. Institutional strengthening incorporated in the Project \nthrough component D (institutional development and training) will include training and awareness \nprograms,  consulting  services  for  project  management  support,  and  institutional  and  financial \nstrengthening of the PUSOs and UMG Road Department. \n \nD. \n\nAnalysis of Individual Subprojects \n\n1. \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis of Individual Subprojects \n\n8. \nThe  least-cost  analysis  ensures  that  each  subproject  is  optimally  designed  to  meet  the \ngoals  of  the  subproject  and  does  not  involve  unnecessary  extra  costs.  Since  there  is  no  unique, \nleast-cost  plan  to  achieve  the  urban  development  targets,  any  plan  that  minimizes  cost  is \nacceptable,  in  principle.  The  water  improvements  will  be  achieved  at  least  cost  through  a \ncentralized  water  supply  for  ger  area  communities,  which  will  be  connected  to  the  main  water \nsystem. To vastly reduce unaccounted for water and eliminate subsidies over time, all customers in \neach of the subprojects will have metered connections. The least-cost analysis covers all feasible \nalternatives for a given subproject, including variations in location and technology, and covers the \nplanning  horizon  or  capacity  of  the  system.5 For  each  subproject,  about  four  alternatives  were \nassessed based on the options presented in the feasibility study reports, with various additions and \nvariations by the project preparatory technical assistance study team. \n \n \n9. \nIn  addition  to  being  least-cost,  each  individual  subproject  must  be  economically  justified \nthrough  applying  standard  benefit-cost  analysis.  Therefore,  economic  internal  rates  of  return \n(EIRRs)  were  derived  for  the  representative  subprojects  in  water  supply  and  urban  roads \ncomponents.  The  main  benefits  for  water  supply  were  quantified  under  the  following  categories: \n(i) water supply: (a) non-incremental benefits, (b) beneficiaries\u2019 willingness to pay for improved and \nexpanded (incremental) water services, (c) user cost savings, (d) user time savings;6 and (ii) urban \nroads: (a) vehicle operating costs (VOC), (b) time savings, and (c) maintenance cost savings. \n\n \nEconomic Parameters and Assumptions \n\nE. \n\n10. \nEconomic  analysis  of  the  Project  was  conducted  over  25  years  inclusive  of  project \nconstruction.  Project  construction  will  commence  in  2007  and  be  completed  in  2012.  Economic \nbenefits and costs were denominated in terms of the domestic price numeraire and expressed in \n                                                 \n5   Based  on  the  least-cost  analysis,  major  decisions  were  made  to  revise  the  overall  design  of  the  Bayankhongor \nsubproject to account for lower cost electricity rates at night and drop a proposed booster pumping station. The high \ncost of buying water from the Erdenet Mining Corporation in Erdenet also led to a lower cost solution to develop a new \nwell field closer to the subproject. \n\n6   Other  indirect  benefits  include  (i)  beneficiaries\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  improved  and  expanded  (incremental)  water \n\nservices, (ii) employment generation, and (iii) health benefits. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 15       59  \n \n\n \n\nconstant  2006  prices.  International  costs  were  converted  to  local  currency  costs  using  an \nexchange rate that started at MNT1,200 per $1. Tradable components were adjusted to economic \nprices using a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.017, and nontraded components were valued at \ndomestic  market  prices.7 A  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of  1.2  and  0.8  was  applied  to  the  wages  of \nskilled and unskilled labor, respectively, at the domestic price level. \n \n11. \nBase  costs  plus  physical  contingencies  of  the  representative  subprojects  were  estimated \nand  apportioned  on  the  basis  of  tradable,  non-tradable,  and  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  costs. \nSimilarly,  operation  and  maintenance  costs  for  each  subproject  were  estimated  on  the  basis  of \nskilled and unskilled labor valued in economic prices, i.e., shadow wage rate factors. \n \n12.  Water  Supply.  Major  benefits  associated  with  improved  water  sources  and  distribution \nservices include reduced water costs for ger area households, the provision of more water kiosks \nto ger areas as well as the opportunity to obtain individual connections in the future. Water system \nimprovements  also  include  significant  reductions  in  unaccounted  for  water,  enhanced  system \npressure,  increased  security  of  supply,  improved  drinking  water  quality,  and  reduced  risk  of \nexposure to waterborne pathogens. Indirect benefits of the overall Project for ger area beneficiaries \ninclude increased employment and productivity because of subproject construction and operation. \nTime  savings  from  improved  water  accessibility  are  also  substantial.  Direct  and  indirect  health \nbenefits of the Project are significant because less days are lost at work and school, and there is a \ngeneral increase in the overall quality of living. \n\n \n13. \nUrban  Roads.  Economic  benefits  comprise  savings  in  VOCs,  including  reduced  road \nmaintenance  costs  and  travel  time  savings  for  both  passengers  and  cargoes  for  existing  and \npotential road users. VOC savings used are from the Road Department under UMG: MNT42,000 \nfor cars, MNT15,000 for minibuses, MNT39,000 for buses, MNT65,000 for trucks, and MNT13,000 \nfor  other  vehicle  types.  The  VOCs  include  fuel,  lubricants,  tires,  maintenance  labor  cost, \ndepreciation,  wages  of  driver,  and  other  costs  (overhead,  administration,  and  interest).  VOC \nsavings accruing from generated traffic have been evaluated at half of the existing traffic benefits. \nVarious  road  users  and  businesses  will  benefit  from  better  mobility  and  access  to  work,  and \nmarkets;  and  better  social \ninstitutions  such  as  schools,  hospitals,  and \ncommunication  centers.  There  will  be  employment  creation  during  project  implementation.  The \ngenerated time savings are estimated based on the passengers\u2019 annual average wage and interest \ncost of the average cargo value; half converted to $0.5 per hour and applied to the actual driving \ntime saved by using the project road. Travel time from Hailaast to Ulaanbaatar City will be reduced \nby about 15 minutes for light vehicles. Maintenance cost savings are also considered as benefits \nonce the proposed roads are improved. Unquantifiable benefits include health and environmental \nbenefits to commuters and residents. \n\nintegration  with \n\n \n14. \nSanitation. The Project is pioneering an on-plot, inside sewage disposal technique through \nsimple compost toilets, which can be built and sold in the community. The indoor compost toilet will \nbe a vast improvement over the present, unimproved pit latrines, which are not only unsanitary but \nalso  barely  accessible  in  the  winter  months.  Ger  residents  will  be  able  to  purchase  those  toilets \nwith the proposed loans under component C of the Project. It is evident that the improvement over \nthe existing pit latrines will have significant health benefits for the project population. \n \n\n                                                 \n7   Since the shadow exchange rate factor is so close to unity, it does not appear that project costing, which is presently at \na preliminary engineering stage, is very sensitive to shadow exchange rates. This assessment is supported by the fact \nthat the difference between the official exchange rate and the \u201dstreet rate\u201d over the past year has been an average of \nonly 3%. \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nHeating. Individual heating stoves will also be improved under the subproject. Small loans \n15. \nprovided  under  component  C  will  finance  the  purchase  or  improvement  of  existing  stoves  to \n\u201csmokeless\u201d stoves either through retrofitting existing stoves or purchasing new ones in the project \nareas. Such stoves will not only improve heating in the winter time, but will reduce overall smoke \npollution  in  the  core  towns,  providing  significant  health  benefits,  improving  fuel  efficiency,  and \nreducing the cost of heating for poor households. \n\n \n16. \nSolid Waste. The provision of more convenient collection points by the local governments \nand  a  people  managed  solid  waste  collection  system  will  substantially  improve  the  quality  of \npeople\u2019s lives in the subproject area. Through the efforts of community-based organizations under \nthe Project, a decline in casually discarded waste will lead to a cleaner and higher standard urban \nenvironment. In addition, fencing and separation of toxic waste at the solid waste landfill will vastly \nreduce environmental pollution in and around existing landfills. \n\n \nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\nF. \n\nThe basic rates of return for the representative water supply subproject is 29.4% in Erdenet. \n17. \nIn the case of Hailaast Road subproject, the EIRR is estimated to be 18.0% and is economically \nviable  under  various  sensitivity  scenarios  (Table  A15.1).  Sensitivity  analyses  of  the  subprojects \nindicate  that  simultaneous  increases  in  costs  and  reduction  in  benefits  as  well  as  substantial \nincreases in project costs (20%) have the greatest impact on the EIRR. Delaying implementation \nby 1 year does not have a significant impact. In general, these factors are not enough to overturn \nthe judgment that the Project is socially beneficial. \n \nTable A15.1: Estimated EIRR for Water Supply and Road Components  \n\nEIRRs and Sensitivity Analysis \nBase Case EIRR \n10% increase in capital costs (1) \n10% decrease in benefits (2) \nCombination of 1 and 2 \nImplementation delay \u2013 1 year \n20% increase in capital costs \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nErdenet Water Supply \n29.4 \n26.0 \n25.6 \n22.7 \n29.3 \n23.2 \n\nHailaast Road \n18.0 \n16.3 \n16.1 \n14.6 \n15.3 \n14.9 \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 November 2006) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "togrog (MNT) \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "MNT1.00 \n      $1.00 \n", "$0.000859 \nMNT1,164 \n", " \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "ADB \nCBO \nDED \nEIRR \nEMP \nFIRR \nGAP \nGTZ \n", "IA \nICB \nIEE \nJFPR \nJICA \nLIBOR \nMCUD \nMOF \nNBFI \nNCB \nO&M \nOLA \nPFI \nPIP \nPIU \nPMU \nPPMS \nPSC \nPUSO \nRD \nRF \nRP \nSLA \nTA \nUMG \nVOC \nWACC \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \ncommunity-based organization \nDeutscher Entwicklungsdienst (German Development Service) \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management program \nfinancial internal rate of return \ngender action plan \nDeutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit \n(German Agency for Technical Cooperation) \nimplementing agency \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction \nJapan International Cooperation Agency \nLondon interbank offered rate \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Ministry of Construction and Urban Development \n\u2013  Ministry of Finance \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "nonbanking financial institution \nnational competitive bidding \noperation and maintenance \nonlending agreement \nparticipating financial institution \nPublic Investment Program \nproject implementation unit \nproject management unit \nproject performance monitoring system \nproject steering committee \npublic urban services organization \nRoad Department \nresettlement framework \nresettlement plan \nsubsidiary loan agreement \ntechnical assistance \nUlaanbaatar municipal government \nvehicle operating cost \nweighted average cost of capital \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "lpcd \nlpd \nm3 \n", "aimag \nger \nhashaa \nsoum \n", " \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "liters per capita per day \nliters per day \ncubic meter \n \n", "GLOSSARY \n", "province/provincial \ntraditional tent \nresidential plot \ndistrict \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", " \n \nNOTES \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "C.
