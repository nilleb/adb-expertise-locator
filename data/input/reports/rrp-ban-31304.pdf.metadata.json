An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nundertaken, and the summary is a core appendix. \n \nThe  Project  will  reduce  rural  poverty  in  16  districts  of  southwest \nBangladesh.  To  achieve  this  objective,  the  Project  will  increase \neconomic  opportunities  for  the  rural  poor  through  participatory \nimprovement of sustainable rural infrastructure, social and gender \ndevelopment, and improved local governance in the project area. \nThe  impact  on  poverty  reduction  will  be  achieved  by  (i) targeting \npoor  areas;  (ii)  closely  involving  the  poor  and  other  stakeholders \nin prioritizing and planning subprojects for project assistance, and \nin maintaining rural infrastructure, while at the same time building \ntheir capacity; and (iii) indirect assistance in developing economic \nopportunities through partnership arrangements. \n \nEfficient rural transport and supporting infrastructure, in particular \nimproved  access,  are  essential \nfor  poverty  reduction  and \neconomic  development  in  Bangladesh.  Past  efforts  in  this  area \nwere undertaken with external assistance, including that from the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  Project  will  build  on  the \nexperience  and  lessons  learned  from  the  previous  projects  to \nprovide needed rural infrastructure improvement. The project area \ncovers the 16 districts of Khulna and Barisal divisions, which were \nselected  because  of  the  poverty  level  and  the  poor  state  of \ndevelopment  of  the  road  infrastructure.  Improving  the  rural  roads \nand supporting infrastructure will provide the rural population with \neffective communication and transport to markets and distribution \ncenters.  These  improvements  will  lay  the  foundation  for  better \neconomic  opportunities  and  assist  in  reducing  poverty.  Another \npriority  is  continued  reform  and  strengthening  of  the  Local \nGovernment  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  and  capacity \nbuilding  for  agencies  in  the  districts  and  the  union  councils  to \nenable  them  to  plan,  manage,  operate,  and  maintain  their  local \ninfrastructure. Private sector stakeholders such as bus operators, \ntraders,  and  rickshaw  drivers  will  be  consulted  on  rural  transport \nneeds.  The  Project  will  use \nfor  planning, \nmanaging,  and  constructing  infrastructure.  Local  participation  will \nimprove the effectiveness of the Project,  sense of ownership, and \nattention to infrastructure maintenance. \n \n\ninformation \n\nthe \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nObjectives \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nThe  Project  will  assist  the  Government  to  reduce  rural  poverty \nthrough  sustainable  economic  growth,  rural  development,  and \nimproved infrastructure.

About  50,000  person-years  of  employment  will  be \ngenerated  during  the  Project  for  local  laborers  to  assist  in  road \nimprovement and maintenance, thereby increasing the incomes of \nthe  rural  poor.  The  project  infrastructure  will  create  about  84,000 \nperson-years of permanent employment, of which 30% will be for \nwomen.  The  Project  will  also  improve  access  to  basic  education \nand  social  services  leading  to  long-term  economic  and  social \nbenefits to the poor. \n \nThe  Project's  overall  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  22.8%. \nThe Project will contribute to poverty reduction by (i) enabling poor \npeople  to  participate  in  economic  opportunities  and  to  access \nsocial services, and (ii) creating additional economic opportunities \nfor  poor  people  by  stimulating  economic  growth.  Project \nbeneficiaries will comprise (i) poor people who will have increased \naccess  to  economic  opportunities  and  human  development \nservices because of improved rural infrastructure; (ii) people living \nin  the  16  districts  who  were  previously  unable  to  pursue \nemployment  and  other  economic  opportunities  due  to  the  long \njourney  times;  and  (iii)  companies,  employees,  consumers,  and \ntransport  operators  in  the  region  that  directly  and  indirectly  use \ngoods  and  services  transported  on  the  roads.  About  2,100 \nperson-years  of  road  maintenance  employment  for  rural  poor \nwomen will be created annually by the Project. \n \nThe Project has been carefully formulated to manage and mitigate \nrisks.  Advance  action  will  help  expedite  recruiting  consultants  to \nsupervise implementation. Risks from the use of local contractors \nto  carry  out  most  of  the  civil  works  despite  their  limited  capacity \nhave  been  successfully  addressed  in  previous  ADB-financed \nprojects.  Participatory  processes  involving  stakeholders  at  all \nlevels will give a sense of ownership and minimize delays caused \nby  lack  of  local  involvement  in  decision  making.  Environmental \nincluding  participatory  mechanisms \nand  social  processes \nintroduced  for  the  Project  will  address  issues  of  local  sensitivity \nand minimize adverse effects. \n \n\n\f \n\nvii \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project.1  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nBangladesh has an extensive road transport system comprising about 227,000 kilometers \n(km). The 4,890 km long primary road network of national and regional roads connects the main \ncities to the 64 districts and is administered by the Roads and Highways Department (RHD). The \nsecondary  network  includes  feeder  roads  type  A  (FRAs)  (connecting  subdistricts2) comprising \n15,962  km.  The  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  of  the  Ministry  of  Local \nGovernment,  Rural  Development,  and  Cooperatives  (MLGRDC)  administers  the  22,991  km \nnetwork  of  feeder  roads  type  B  (FRBs)  and  rural  roads  type  1  (RR-1), with a total network of \n67,067 km.3 Responsibility for the 116,000 km local rural road network of types 2 (RR-2) and 3 \n(RR-3), is currently delegated to the union councils.4 5 \n \n3. \nRoad  transport  demand  during  the  1990s  increased  at  8.2%  nationally,  compared  with \nthe  average  annual  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  of  only  4.8%.  Between  1975  and \n1997, the proportions of freight and passenger traffic using road transport increased from 35% \nand 54% to 63% and 73%, respectively.  In the project area (Barisal and Khulna divisions), the \nannual  growth  in  road  transport  was  4.5%.  Passenger  transport  has  shifted substantially from \nwater  and  rail  to  road.  Better  quality  rural  roads  provide  improved  service  levels  in  public \ntransport, improved comfort, less costly private trips, and vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings \nof 30-50% for all vehicles. With road network improvements, it is expected that the demand for \nroad transport will continue to increase. \n \n4. \nSince  1993  the  Government  has  provided  maintenance  funds  to  LGED  from  the \nrecurrent  budget.  From  FY1998-FY2002,  the  Government\u2019s  allocation  for  LGED  road \nmaintenance  has  increased  by  12%  per  year,  from  $21  million  to  $31  million.  However,  \nmaintaining the existing and new road assets will require a 15% annual increase in funding. The \ngap in funding for maintenance requirements for LGED roads has expanded from 4% in FY1998 \nto 28% in FY2002, to maintain 20,693 km of improved roads. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nIn  1984  the  Government  adopted  a  strategy  for  rural  development.  The  new  strategy \nemphasized  the  critical  aspects  of  the  rural  development  process\u2013agricultural development, \nimproved  physical  infrastructure,  and  income  generation  for  the  poor  including  one  or  more  of \n                                                 \n1   Project preparatory technical assistance (TA) was provided under ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nRepublic of Bangladesh for preparing the Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project. Manila  \n\n2  Subdistricts (upazila) are local governments at the third level of administration after divisions and districts (zila). \n3  Of the total length of 22,991 km of FRBs, only 10,583 km, or 46% has been improved; only 10,110 km of a total \n\nlength of 67,067 km of RR-1, or 15%, has been improved. \n\n4  Rural roads comprise (i) FRBs, which connect growth center markets with the national road network or subdistrict \nheadquarters; (ii) RR-1s, which connect local markets and union headquarters with subdistrict headquarters or the \nnational road network; (iii) RR-2s,  which  connect  villages  and  farms  with  local  markets  and  union  headquarters; \nand (iv) RR-3s, which are within villages. \n\n5   Union councils (parishad), are the next level of local government below subdistricts, and are the level where local \n\nelections are held every 5 years. \n\n\f2 \n\nthe following elements: (i) develop physical infrastructure (all-weather FRBs to connect growth \ncenter  markets),  improve  rural  roads  and  span  the  gaps  in  roads  to  give  rural  people  better \naccess to markets and services, and improve facilities at growth center markets to make trading \nmore efficient; (ii) develop irrigated agriculture, and minor drainage and flood control works; (iii) \nreduce  poverty  through  rural  infrastructure  maintenance  programs;  and  (iv)  implement \nproduction  and  employment  programs  for  the  rural  poor.  Developments  in  these  four  critical \nareas  are  introduced  in  rural  districts  to  complement  each  other  and  provide  synergistic \ndevelopment impacts to reduce poverty. \n \n6. \nThe  strategy  has  been  implemented  through  a  series  of  projects  that  focused  on \ndevelopment  of  road  and  market  infrastructure  implemented  by  LGED  with  external  financing \nsupport  (Appendix  1).  Among  them  are  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-financed  rural \ninfrastructure  development  projects  (RIDP)-I,  RIDP-II,  and  RIDP-III. 6  The  project  completion \nreports  for  RIDP-I  and  II  and  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA) concluded that \nthe projects contributed successfully to the strategy, including employment for the poor through \nlabor-intensive  construction  methods.  The  Bangladesh  Rural  Infrastructure  Strategy  Study \ncommissioned  in  1996,  and  lessons  learned  and  impact  evaluations  from  previous  ADB  and \nother  externally-financed  projects  concluded  that  the  1984  strategy\u2019s  market  growth  center \napproach  (focusing  on  public  investments  in  selected  market  growth  centers)  remained  valid. \nWhile the design of past projects was assessed to be fundamentally sound, new projects have \nincorporated  the  lessons  learned  from  previous  projects.  Using  lessons  learned  from  RIDP-II \nand  III,  the  proposed  Project  seeks  to  build  the  capacity  of  the  executing  agency  to  use  more \nparticipatory  approaches,  continue  the  successful  use  of  local  labor  contracting  societies  for \nroutine  maintenance  to  provide  employment  opportunities  for  destitute  rural  women,  increase \nthe  training  and  use  of  private  sector  contractors  for  road  construction  and  maintenance, and \nsupport  the  Government\u2019s  decentralization  policy  by  increasing  the  roles  and  responsibility  of \nlocal  governments  in  development  planning  and  implementation.  The  plan  for  the  future \ndevelopment of the rural infrastructure subsector is in Appendix 2. \n \n7. \nRHD,  LGED,  and  subdistricts  and  union  councils  have  responsibility  for  rural \ninfrastructure development. FRAs and FRBs are essentially the same, and the Government has \nbeen  considering  the  redefinition  of  classifications  and  management  responsibilities between \nRHD  and  LGED.  RHD  continues  to  manage  some  FRBs  and  even  RR-1s,  while  LGED  has \nundertaken work on some FRAs. This system is not conducive to effective management of the \nsecondary  and  tertiary  road  networks.  ADB  and  other  aid  agencies  have  consistently \nrecommended  that  (i)  RHD  should  manage  the  primary  road  network  of  national  and  regional \nroads, (ii) LGED should manage the secondary road network of feeder roads and RR-1s, and \n(iii) subdistricts and union councils should manage the tertiary network of RR-2 and RR-3 roads. \nImplementation of this management system will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of road \noperations in the country. \n \n8. \nADB  and  other  major  aid  agencies  have  invested  heavily  in  the  rural  infrastructure \nsector. LGED\u2019s annual average level of external project support through the 1990s was in the \norder of $140 million. As a result LGED now has a large improved road network to maintain, one \nwhich  will  soon  double  with  the  FRAs  coming  under  its  jurisdiction.

LGED  recently  recognized  the  critical  importance  of  involving  local  stakeholders  in \nplanning, \nthe  TA \ninstitutional  analysis  identified  a  need  for  extensive  training  of  LGED  staff  in  participatory \napproaches. If LGED is to be effective in this respect, it needs to develop an internal capacity to \ninvolve  and  facilitate  community  participation  in  project  planning  and  management, undertake \nenvironmental  and  social  assessments,  and  plan  resettlement.  LGED  is  in  the  process  of \nadopting  a  new  organizational  structure  that  is  more  relevant  to  maintenance  and  facilitation \nroles, and will assist the union councils to develop into effective units of local government. The \nProject  will  assist  this  transition  through  training  to  facilitate  the  organizational  change \nnecessary for LGED\u2019s new role. \n \n10. \nGovernment  policy  has  attached  importance  to  creating  efficient  and  effective  local \ngovernment  institutions  for  decentralized  decision  making  within  a  participatory  framework. \nUnion  councils,  being  the  administrative  unit  closest  to  communities,  are  targeted  as  the  focal \npoint for promoting socioeconomic changes and infrastructure development in rural Bangladesh. \nThey  are  empowered  to  undertake  revenue  collection  and  local  administration,  and  promote \nlocal  development.  Union  councils  receive  allocations  for  projects  through  the  central \nGovernment\u2019s annual development program, but are also vested with powers to raise revenues \nto  carry  out  their  functions.  In  reality,  however,  there  has  not  been  much  progress  in \ndecentralized  governance  at  this  level.  The  TA  and  other  studies  have  concluded  that  most \nunion councils in the rural regions have very limited capacity to carry out their functions, and are \npoorly  equipped  to  provide  meaningful  development  planning  and  administration  for  their \nconstituencies.  There  is  a  need  to  strengthen  the  union  councils  and  empower  them  to  take \nmore responsibility for local service delivery. \n \n11. \nThe  Government  has  identified  2,100  of  the  estimated  8,600  rural  markets  in \nBangladesh  as  growth  center  markets  to  serve  as  focal  points  and  catalysts  for  poverty \nreduction  and  economic  and  social  development,  and  around  which  investment  in  rural \ninfrastructure would be concentrated. They are key locations for trade and commercial activities. \nImprovement  of  growth  center  markets  is  seen  as  a  crucial  element  of  the  rural  development \nstrategy.  The  operation  and  maintenance of growth center markets is not entirely transparent, \nparticularly the award of market leases. Because lease values have declined over the years, a \nGovernment regulation forces the lease values to be increased each year. While the concept of \ngrowth  center  markets  appears  sound  as  a  strategy,  new  regulations  to  introduce  greater \ntransparency and local control of market management are required. \n \nThe  project  area,  totaling  35,000  square  kilometers  (km2),  comprises  16  districts  of \n12. \nKhulna  and  Barisal  divisions,  which  cover  24.1%  of  the  total  area  of  Bangladesh.  Their \npopulation  of  22.6  million  represents  18.4%  of  the  country's  population.  The  project  area  was \nchosen because of the extensive poverty and low level of development in the region.  In the two \ndivisions,  over  11  million  people  are  poor.  In  2000,  47%  of  the  people  were  below  the  upper \npoverty line\u201340% in Barisal and 51% in Khulna. In the decade ending in 2000, mean per capita \nexpenditure  increased  by  2.1%  annually  in  these  divisions  while  the  national  average  annual \nincrease was 2.4%. Only 39% of the FRBs and 30% of the growth center markets in the project \narea have been improved to all-weather standard, so there is considerable potential for further \ninvestment in rural infrastructure to reduce poverty. \n \n\n\f4 \n\nImproving  physical  infrastructure  like  roads,  markets,  and  ferry  crossings  has  a  direct \n13. \npositive  impact  on  the  income  of  all  categories  of  households  living  in  the  affected  areas. \nEvaluation  of  the  ADB-financed  RIDPs  and  other  projects  has  shown  that  these  interventions \nwere  highly  effective  in  reducing  poverty.  Improved  roads  and  markets  helped  to  lower \nmarketing costs and VOCs, and improved overall access to public services (health, education, \nand agricultural extension) and economic opportunities. The poor specifically benefited because \nof the increased availability of goods and services at lower prices. The 2002 Bangladesh Public \nExpenditure Review confirms the positive impact of rural infrastructure improvement on poverty \nreduction. A project preparatory TA study7 also found that 75% of the poor had easier access to \nemployment and their incomes increased by 20% on average. \n \n14. \nTo identify the most suitable project interventions within the project area, 27 participatory \nmeetings at the local level were conducted during the TA. From these meetings, stakeholders \nalso identified issues associated with governance (particularly at the local level), risk mitigation \nand  stakeholder  participation  during  project  implementation.  The  issues  included  the  need  to \nstrengthen  the  coordination  and  participation  mechanisms  of  union  councils  and  LGED,  the \nneed for sustainable and independent local level funding, and the need for these interventions \nto  be  sustainable  beyond  the  project  implementation  period.  These  contributions  and  lessons \nlearned have been incorporated into the Project\u2019s design. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nObjective \n\n \nA. \n \nThe goal of the Project is to reduce rural poverty in 16 districts of southwest Bangladesh. \n15. \nTo  achieve  the  objective,  the  Project  will  increase  economic  opportunities  for  the  rural  poor \nthrough  participatory  improvement  of  sustainable  rural  infrastructure,  social  and  gender \ndevelopment,  and  improved  local  governance  in  the  project  area.  The  impact  on  poverty \nreduction  will  be  achieved  by  (i)  targeting  poor  areas;  (ii)  closely  involving  the  poor  and  other \nstakeholders,  including  women,  in  prioritizing  and  planning  subprojects  for  project  assistance, \nand  maintaining  rural  infrastructure,  while  at  the  same  time  building  their  capacity;  and  (iii) \nindirect  assistance  in  developing  economic  opportunities  through  partnership  arrangements. \nThe project framework is in Appendix 3. \n \nB. \n \nThe  Project  will  (i)  improve  rural  roads;  (ii) improve rural infrastructure such as growth \n16. \ncenter  markets,  boat  landings,  ferries,  and  union  council  office  complexes;  (iii)  improve \ninfrastructure maintenance; (iv) strengthen LGED capacity and improve local governance; and \n(v) support LGED in project management. \n \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nRural Roads \n\n \n17. \nThe  Project  will  upgrade  about  1,030  km  of  FRBs  to  bitumen-surfaced standard and \nconstruct bridges and culverts along them to provide all-weather access to rural growth center \nmarkets.8  Local  stakeholders  selected  the  FRBs  from  lists  compiled  by  LGED,  through  27 \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2000.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  Road Network Improvement and \n\nMaintenance. Manila. \n\n8  If  the  Government  decides  to  revise  road  classifications  and  reallocate  the  responsibility  of  FRAs and FRBs to \n\nLGED, the total length of feeder roads to be upgraded by the Project may be reviewed during implementation. \n\n\f5 \n\nparticipatory meetings held under the TA. Further participation will be required at the local level \nif  changes  are  needed  at  the  detailed  project  design  and  implementation  stages.  Bridges and \nculverts  with  a  total  length  of  3,000  meters  (m)  will  be  constructed  on  project  FRBs.  After \nmeeting the requirements on these roads, bridges and culverts totaling a further 2,000 m will be \nbuilt  on  other  FRBs  and  RR-1s.9  Women  labor  contracting  societies10  will  be  used  to improve \nroad shoulders, plant trees on roadsides, and maintain the roads. The women will be supported \nby nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to promote savings from their income, and to identify \nincome-generating  opportunities  using  the  savings  through  partnership  arrangements  with \nmicrofinance institutions and NGOs. The use of performance-based maintenance contracts with \nprivate sector contractors will also be encouraged with consultant support. \n \n\n2. \n\nRural Infrastructure \n\n \n18. \nDuring  the  project  detailed  design  and  implementation  stages,  through  participatory \nmeetings, local stakeholders will select from lists compiled by LGED 60 growth center markets \nand  50  boat  landings  to  be  improved  under  the  Project.  The  growth  center  markets  will  also \ninclude sections for women. Growth center market management committees will be elected at \npublic  meetings  and  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  growth  centers  are  properly \nmanaged  financially  and  physically.  A  limited  number  of  small  ferries  will  be  built  to  improve \naccess  in  riverine  areas.  Management  committees  for  the  boat  landings  and  ferries  will  be \nformed.  New  union  council  office  complexes  will  be  built  in  99  unions  to  support  efforts  to \nimprove local governance. \n \n\n3. \n\nInfrastructure Maintenance  \n\n19. \nRoad  maintenance  will  be  improved  under  the  Project  through  central  level  reform, \nimproved district operations, and assignment of increased responsibilities to the union councils \nfor  maintenance  of  rural  roads  (RR-2  and  RR-3). The Project will require the  Government to \nclose the gap in funding for maintenance by providing sufficient funds to maintain all roads for \nwhich LGED is responsible. The Project will also support policy dialogue with the Government \non  ongoing  and  proposed  ADB  projects11  and  other  externally  aided  projects,  to  establish  a \nmechanism to fund road maintenance adequately, and on a permanent basis. \n \n20. \nLGED  maintenance  cells  at  the  central  and  district  levels  will  be  supported  to  improve \ntheir maintenance management systems and procedures. The project consultant will review and \nintroduce  improvements  to  LGED\u2019s  maintenance  operations  and  management  systems \ncurrently  in  place.12  Engineers  have  already  been  dedicated  to  maintenance  duties  at  district \nand  subdistrict  levels  and  LGED\u2019s  central and regional training units and consultants will train \nthem in maintenance operations. LGED presently undertakes routine and periodic maintenance \nusing  a  combination  of  in-house  (mobile  maintenance)  units,  labor  contracting  groups,  and \ncontracts. There are no performance-based specifications for maintenance. With the support of \n                                                 \n9  An  ongoing  bridge  replacement  program,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan,  covers  44  bridges  that  increase \n\naccess in the project area and is complementary to the project investments. \n\n10 Labor  contracting  societies  comprise  poor  rural  women  with  limited  earning  possibilities  who  carry  out  routine \n\nmaintenance on rural roads using basic hand tools and material supplied by LGED. \n\n11 ADB.  2000.

Manila; ADB. 2002.  Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of  Directors on a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of \nBangladesh for the Road Network Improvement and Maintenance Project. \n\n12  Pavement  surface  trials  will  be  conducted  in  project  areas  to  determine  the  optimum  timing  for  periodic  reseals. \nThe highway des ign and maintenance standards model will also be recalibrated to model conditions on rural roads \nin Bangladesh and used as a tool for LGED to plan and manage maintenance.  \n\n\f6 \n\nthe project consultant, the Project will continue previous and current efforts in LGED and RHD \nto promote the coordinated development of performance-based maintenance using contractors. \nThe  subdistricts  and  union  councils  will  be  responsible  for  maintaining  rural  roads  (RR-2 and \nRR-3), and for operation and maintenance of growth center markets and, where appropriate, the \nthe  union  council's \nferries.  To \nadjoining  boat \nresponsibilities, the project consultants will train union council members and staff. \n \n\nincrease  awareness  of \n\nlandings  and \n\n4. \n\nLGED Capacity Building and Local Governance  \n\na. \n\nLGED Capacity Building \n\n21. \nLGED\u2019s staff will be strengthened by training them in topics such as decentralized and \nprivatized  maintenance,  procurement,  financial  management,  and  particularly  the  use  of \nparticipatory approaches to infrastructure planning, development, and maintenance. The LGED \nunits  for  road  maintenance  planning,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  strengthened  with \nassistance  from  the  project  consultant.  LGED  will  be  supported  in  introducing  organizational \nreforms  to  strengthen  its  capacity  to  undertake  environmental  and  social  assessments,  and \nproject  performance  management  and  impact  monitoring.  The  need  for  further  institutional \nreform will also be assessed. Under this component, the clear demarcation of responsibilities for \nroad  construction  and  maintenance  between  RHD  (national  and  regional  roads),  LGED  (all \nfeeder roads and  RR-1s),  and  union  councils  (RR-2  and  RR-3s) will be approved, and LGED \nand union councils will be supported to undertake their new responsibilities. A uniform financial \nmanagement  system  and  uniform  procurement  procedures  will  be  introduced  in  LGED. \nConsultant support will be provided in implementing LGED\u2019s new gender strategy. \n \n22. \nLGED  staff  require  nontechnical  training  to  meet  the  growing  demand  for  them  to \nperform  the  function  of  facilitators  and  social  mobilizers.  LGED  community  organizers  will \nfacilitate the training of LGED staff and of communities participating in the Project. NGOs with \nsuitable  capability  will  be  engaged  to  provide  social  mobilization  training  and  training  for  labor \ncontracting societies and women shop owners. Staff of LGED's training division will give labor \ncontracting society groups including women, technical training to maintain RR-2 and RR-3 roads \nin the project area. LGED staff will also be trained to prepare social and environmental impact \nassessments, screen subprojects for resettlement impacts, and prepare resettlement plans. \n \n\nb. \n\nLocal Governance  \n\nissues,  planning, \n\nThe Project will support the improvement of local governance by giving training  in local \n23. \ngovernment \nfinancial  management,  administration,  and  participatory \nmethodologies to all members (at least 25% of whom will be women) of the 899 union councils \nin  the  project  area  to  a  level  where  they  can  confidently  provide  efficient  and  effective  local \ngovernance  to  their  constituents.  The  members  of  32  pilot  union  councils  will  receive  more \nintensive  training.  Similarly  the  members  and  staff  of  the  management  committees  of  growth \ncenters,  boat  landings  and  ferries,  and  market  trader  associations  will  be  trained  to  a  level \nwhere they can confidently operate and maintain the infrastructure. \n \n24. \nUnion  development  coordination  committees  will  be  formed  in  32  pilot  union  councils. \nThe  members  will  be  various  stakeholders  such  as  line  agency  staff,  NGOs,  and  primary \nstakeholder  beneficiary  groups.  The  committees  will  introduce  a  coordinated  approach  to \nplanning and implementing subprojects to improve flows of microfinance, line agency services, \nand training to beneficiaries. The committees will be chaired by the union council chairpersons \nand  will  seek  to  align  the  programs  of  different  stakeholders  toward  improving  economic \n\n\f7 \n\nopportunities for project beneficiaries in the 32 unions. New women union council members will \nreceive orientation training on their role as public representatives to make them more effective. \n \n25. \nThe subdistricts and union councils are responsible for managing and maintaining RR-2 \nand RR-3 roads, boat landings, and ferries, but the level of their expertise is low. ADB\u2019s RIDP-III \nhas provided a useful program to build the capacity of the union councils using national training \nspecialists.  The  Project  will  continue  this  program,  using  existing  materials  and  experience \ngained  to  train  members  of  the  Project\u2019s  899  union  councils  and  other  stakeholders  such  as \ncommunity  organizers,  union  market  management  committee  members,  and  boat  landing \ncommittee members. Citizens\u2019 forums will be established in each of the 32 pilot unions to enable \nthe citizens to participate in planning and decision making for the development of the union. \n \nA sense of ownership and sustainability of union councils would be enhanced if locally \n26. \ngenerated  funds  from  market  leases  could  be  retained  for  local  union  operations  and \nmaintenance rather than be redistributed by the Government, as is presently the case. Such a \nsystem will be tested in the 32 pilot union councils.  The Project will support the implementation \nof  the  newly  approved  market  management  regulation,  including  revised  market  management \ncommittee  membership  with  members  from  the  union  (including  women).  The  Project  will \nimplement  new  guidelines  for  the  award  and  management  of  market  leases.  The potential for \ngenerating  incremental  funds  for  local  development  by  granting  union  councils  increased \nrevenue  mobilization  powers  will  also  be  piloted.  Pilot  projects  of  clusters  of  the  32  union \ncouncils will test the concept of pooling revenues from the growth center markets and making \nthe  concerned  union  councils  responsible  for  the  use  of  the  funds.  The  pilot  projects  will \nestablish  a  methodology  for  LGED  to  provide  matching  funds  as  an  incentive  to  unions  that \nperform  well  in  increasing  their  resource  mobilization.  Reforms  will  be  introduced  to  devolve \nadditional authority to union councils to increase revenue mobilization.13  \n \n\n5. \n\nProject Management Support \n\n27. \nThe  Project  will  provide  LGED  with  the  resources  necessary  to  support  efficient \nimplementation  and  management  of  all  project  activities.  The  Project  will  provide  incremental \nstaff  for  project  management,  including  implementation  supervision  at  the  field  level.  A \ncombination of international and domestic consulting services will be provided to support project \nimplementation management, and capacity building. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n28. \nThe  Project  will  improve  local  governance  by  training  union  council  members  in  their \nroles  and  responsibilities,  and  support  a  pilot  program  to  facilitate  the  introduction  of \nparticipatory mechanisms for union-level governance. The Project will undertake pilot projects of \nclusters  of  32  union  councils  that  will  test  the  feasibility  of  adjoining  union  councils  sharing \nrevenues from the growth center markets, and using such revenues for maintaining RR-2 and \nRR-3  and  other  infrastructure,  and  for  local  development.  The  pilot  unions  will  be  given \nadditional  responsibilities  and  incentives  to  increase  revenue  mobilization  and  retain  the \nrevenue  for  local  development.  This  process  will  improve  local  governance.  The  Project  will \nfocus  on  developing  the  capacity  of  union  councils  and  market  management  committees, and \nintroducing  other  mechanisms  for  improved  interaction  with  a  range  of  stakeholders  and \n\n                                                 \n13 The  proposed  Urban  Governance  and  Infrastructure  Improvement  Sector  Project  seeks  to  improve  urban \ngovernance  in  selected  secondary  towns  of  Bangladesh,  focusing  on  urban  councils,  however,  unlike  in  the \nProject, the urban councils will receive substantial funds to implement infrastructure investments. \n\n\f8 \n\nbeneficiary  groups  involved  in  the  rural  development  process.  Promoting  greater  stakeholder \nparticipation  in  and  planning  of  developments  in  their  area  will  lead  to  better  coordinated  line \nagency  activities  at  the  union  level  and  improved  economic  opportunities  for  the  rural  poor. \nChanging the organizational culture of LGED to include consideration of community participation \nin planning and implementing rural infrastructure is another feature of the proposed Project. The \nProject will support LGED to move from an implementation role to a role that facilitates greater \ninvolvement by the local level and the private sector. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n29. \nThe  estimated  project  cost  is  $112.4  million  equivalent,  inclusive  of  physical  and  price \ncontingencies,  taxes  and  duties,  and  interest  and  service  charges  during  construction.  The \nforeign exchange cost is estimated at $30.1 million, or about 26.8% of the total cost. The local \ncurrency cost is estimated at $82.3 million equivalent, or about 73.2% of the total cost. The local \ncurrency  costs  include  an  estimated  $6.8  million  equivalent  for  taxes  and  duties.  The  project \ncost estimate summarized in Table 1 should be regarded as indicative only.

The  loan  will  finance  $23.5  million  of  the \nforeign exchange cost (78.1% of the total foreign exchange cost), and $36.5 million equivalent \nof the local currency cost (44.4% of the total local currency cost). The German Government has \nbeen  requested  to  provide  a  grant  through  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW)  for  financial \n\n\f9 \n\nto  provide  a  grant \n\nthrough  Gesellschaft \n\ncooperation of $11.9 million equivalent,14 or 10.5% of the project cost to finance project activities \nin four districts15 and implementation consultants in Khulna division. The German Government \nhas  also  been  requested \nf\u00fcr  Technische \nZusammenarbeit  (GTZ)  for  technical  cooperation  of  $5.0  million  equivalent,  or  4.5%  of  the \nproject cost. The Government will provide $34.0 million equivalent, or 30.3% of the project cost. \nUnion councils will contribute $1.5 million equivalent, or 1.3% of the project cost by contributing \n10%  of  the  cash  cost  for  the  civil  works  for  bridges  and  culverts,  growth  center  markets, boat \nlandings,  and  union  office  complexes.  ADB  and  the  Government  will  continue  to  seek \ncofinancing  sources.  If  additional  funds  become  available  during  implementation,  the  project \nscope  will  be  correspondingly  increased.  Also,  if  funding  from  the German Government is not \nforthcoming, the scope will be adjusted to fit the available funds. Local cost financing is justified \ngiven the poverty-oriented nature of the Project and the tight fiscal situation in the country.  \n \n31. \nThe  Borrower  will  be  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh.  The  ADB  loan  will  have  a \nmaturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years. The loan will carry an interest charge \nof  1.0%  during  the  grace  period  and  an  interest  charge  of  1.5%  per  annum  during  the \namortization period.

The Government will require LGED to appoint the key project PMO staff\u2013\nincluding the project director, two deputy project directors, district engineers, accounts officers, \n\n                                                 \n14 The  German  Government  has  indicated  that  it  is  considering  increasing  the  grant  through  KfW  to  $16  million \n\nequivalent. \n\n15 Chaudanga, Jhenaidah, Kushtia, and Meherpur districts.  \n16 The secretary of the Local Government Division (LGD) will chair the committee, with members from LGD, LGED, \nRHD,  the  Planning  Commission  of  the  Ministry  of  Planning,  the  Economics  Relations  Division  of  the  Ministry  of \nFinance, the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division of the Ministry of Planning, the National Institute of \nLocal Government, the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs, local government bodies, NGOs, and the private \nsector. \n\n\f10 \n\nan environment specialist, and the senior resettlement officer\u2013by the date of loan approval. The \nproject  director  will  report  to  the  chief  engineer  of  LGED,  and,  supported  by  the  PMO,  will \ncoordinate  all  project  activities,  and  will  be  directly  responsible \nfor  overall  project \nimplementation,  monitoring,  and  supervision.  The  PMO  will  establish  two  zonal  offices\u2013in \nLGED\u2019s Jessore and Barisal district offices \u2013each headed by a deputy project director. \n \n33. \nThe PMO will (i) prepare the project implementation plan and consolidated annual work \nplan,  (ii)  closely  monitor  project  progress  in  each  subdistrict,  (iii)  prepare  detailed  subproject \ndesigns and appraisal reports, (iv) monitor and supervise all project management activities, (v) \norganize  project  performance  management  activities, \nthe  satisfactory \nimplementation  of  the  gender  action  plan  and  other  activities  under  the  summary  poverty \nreduction  and  social  strategy,  and  (vii)  prepare  necessary  progress  reports  and  the  project \ncompletion  report.  The  PMO  will  be  adequately  staffed  and  assisted  by  consultants  with \nexpertise in engineering, finance and accounting, social and gender development, and capacity \nbuilding and local governance.  \n \nThe  staff  of  the  LGED  district  and  subdistrict  offices  will  work  closely  with  the  union \n34. \ncouncils  and  market  and  boat  landing  management  committees to implement relevant project \nactivities.  Union  development  coordination  committees  will  be  formed  to  provide  a  mechanism \nfor  stakeholders  and  beneficiaries  to  participate  in  subproject  planning  and  implementation. \nLGED will also facilitate effective operation of citizens' forums. \n \n\n(vi)  ensure \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Implementation \n\nThe TA examined 20 sample FRBs that are considered a representative sample of the \n35. \n99 candidate FRBs in the shortlist to be considered for final detailed design and improvement. \nThe  eligibility  criteria  for  subproject  roads  and  other  infrastructure  give  the  guidelines  for  the \nfinal  approval  of  the  subprojects.  The  criteria  target  poorer  unions,  taking  into  account  social \nand economic indicators, roads, poverty, gender disparity, and environmental conditions in the \nsubproject area. A participatory approach will be used to apply the criteria and to identify other \nissues during implementation. To be eligible for financing under the loan, the subprojects must \n(i)  be  technically  justified  and  economically  viable,17\n  (ii)  be  environmentally  responsible  and \nminimize land acquisition and resettlement, and (iii) comply with all applicable ADB guidelines. \nThe  PMO  and  the  implementation consultant  will  finalize  the  subproject  detailed  design  and \nappraisal reports for LGED and ADB approval, using procedures approved by the ADB. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n36. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  6-year period.  Implementation  is  expected  to \nbegin  in  the  second  quarter  of  2003.  Initial  activities  will  include  filling  any  vacant  PMO \npositions,  recruiting  consultants,  preparing  the  detailed  design  of  the  subprojects  to  be \nimplemented  in  2003,  completing  a  benchmark  survey,  and  procuring  essential  equipment. \nPhysical works may not start before the fourth  quarter of 2003 to allow time for completing the \nsurveys  and  preparing  detailed  engineering  designs  and  contract  documents.  The  loan \nutilization  period  will  terminate  on  30  June  2009.  The  Government  will  not  award  any  ADB-\nfinanced civil works construction  contracts until after the implementation consultants have been \nappointed, the land and rights to land, free of encumbrances, are available for execution of such \ncontracts,  and  resettlement  activities  and  compensation  payments  have  been  completed.  A \nsummary project implementation schedule is in Appendix 5. \n\n                                                 \n17 The economic internal rate of return will exceed 12% for eligible subprojects. \n\n\f11 \n\n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n37. \nGoods,  related  services,  and  civil  works  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  following \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Since  the  civil  works  will  be  small  and  widely  dispersed, \nforeign  contractors  are  unlikely  to  be  interested  in  bidding.  Consequently,  all  the  civil  works \ncontracts  will  be  procured  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding  among  prequalified \ncontractors in accordance with the Government\u2019s procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. \nPrequalification,  selection,  and  engagement  of  contractors  will  be  subject  to  the  approval  of \nADB. Contracts for FRBs, growth center markets, boat landings, and union office complexes will \ngenerally  be  awarded  by  the  concerned  LGED  district  executive engineer, while contracts for \nstructures on rural roads will be awarded by the LGED subdistrict engineer, under the guidance \nof  the  PMO.  To  ensure  economy  and  efficiency  in  contract  administration,  small  contracts  for \nroads and drainage improvement works at various construction sites will be grouped together to \nobtain a higher contract value. Attempts will be made to award one contract for construction of \neach  subproject  FRB.  Efforts  will  also  be  made  to  limit  the  number  of  contracts  and  engage \nlarger professional contractors. This approach will shorten the construction period and ensure \nsingle accountability for the quality of work. Civil works contracts below the expenditure limit of \n$50,000 will be permitted on a case-by-case basis. LGED will award contracts for infrastructure \nconstruction that prioritize the involvement of poor people. \n \n38. \nEach supply contract for equipment or materials estimated to cost $500,000 or more will \nbe  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding, and those costing less than the \nequivalent  of  $500,000  (other  than  minor  items)  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international \nshopping. Direct purchase procedures will be used for small or off-the-shelf items valued at less \nthan $100,000. The PMO will procure the equipment and vehicles. ADB has approved advance \naction and retroactive financing for recruiting implementation consultants\u2013from 2002 to the date \nof  effectiveness  of  the  ADB  loan\u2013to  facilitate  the  start-up  of  project  implementation.  The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of advance action and retroactive financing does \nnot commit ADB to finance the project. Indicative procurement packages are in Appendix 6. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n39. \nTwo  consulting  services  groups  are  required  to  facilitate project implementation and to \nstrengthen  LGED  and  improve  local  governance.  An  infrastructure  implementation  consultant \nwill provide 134 person-months of international and 1,238 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices  for  engineering  design,  planning,  tender  evaluation,  supervision,  and  monitoring  of \nproject works. An international firm in association with a domestic firm will provide the services. \nA further 48 person-months of international and 606 person-months of domestic consultants will \nprovide capacity building and local governance support through a separate organization or firm. \nLGED  will  engage  consulting  services  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging consultants. Quality and \ncost-based selection procedures will be used in recruiting the consultants. The outline terms of \nreference and a personnel schedule for the implementation consultants are in Appendix 7. \n \n\n6. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n40. \nLand  acquisition  problems  can  be  a  major  source  of  delays  in  implementing \ndevelopment  projects  in  Bangladesh.  Consequently,  land  acquisition  requirements  under  the \nProject  will  be  minimized,  as  they  have  been  under  the  ongoing  RIDP-III.  All  land  required  for \nroad and other infrastructure improvement is generally either within the existing right-of-way or \n\n\f12 \n\nis owned by the Government. However, minimal parcels on government land only may have to \nbe  acquired  for  road  realignment,  growth  center  market  improvement,  and  union  complex \nconstruction. To minimize implementation delays due to land acquisition, the location of project \ninfrastructure will be carefully determined. In addition, committees in the participating unions will \nbe formed at the start of the Project to undertake rapid selection and evaluation of potential land \nsites, and a subproject agreement will be signed with the union council. LGED, in cooperation \nwith  the  union  committees,  will  complete  the  preparatory  work  for  land  acquisition  before  it \nsubmits subproject appraisal reports. Actual land acquisition will be completed within 365 days \nfrom  the  signing  of  the  subproject  agreement;  otherwise,  the  subproject  will  be  removed  from \nthe Project. Should a subproject require any involuntary resettlement, the subproject appraisal \nreport  will  include  a  short  resettlement  plan,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and \nresettlement  policy.  All  compensation  and  resettlement  activities  will  be  completed  before \npossession of land and other assets. LGED will publicly disclose the short resettlement plans in \neach subproject area after subproject appraisal. \n \n\n7. \n\nMaintenance \n\n41. \nThe  union  councils  will  be  responsible  for  maintaining  infrastructure  investments. \nConsultants  will  prepare  maintenance  manuals  that  describe  the maintenance procedures for \nunion  infrastructure  for  the  use  of  the  subdistrict  engineering  staff  and  union  councils.  The \nconsultants  will  provide  subdistrict  and  union  staff  with  specific  training  in  maintaining \ninfrastructure  facilities.  One  of  the  tasks  of  the  capacity  building  consultants  will  be  to  define \neach union\u2019s maintenance requirements and obtain a realistic assessment of the costs involved. \nThe consultants will use the manuals and on-the-job training to ensure that subdistrict and union \nstaff are familiar with their maintenance responsibilities and requirements. The Project requires \nthat  the  Government  set  aside  adequate  funds  to  cover  maintenance  expenditures  for  rural \ninfrastructure constructed in the participating unions each year. The Project will provide training \nto help the union councils generate additional revenue for this purpose. \n \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nimplementation  and \n\n42. \nThe  civil  works  contracts  to  be  awarded  will  generally  be  small  in  value  and  involve  a \ntimely \nlarge  number  of  contractors.  To  ensure  effective  project \ndisbursement,  the  Government  will  establish  an  imprest  account  in  the  name  of  the  Project  at \nthe  Bangladesh  Central  Bank  immediately  after  the  effectiveness  of  the  loan  agreement. \nPayments for eligible  items  will  be  made  through  this  account.  The  statement  of  expenditure \n(SOE) procedure will be adopted to facilitate reimbursement and liquidation of small contracts. \nThe  imprest  account  and  the  SOE  procedure  will  be  established,  maintained,  and  audited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook. The ceiling of the imprest account will \nnot  exceed  the  estimated  ADB-financed  expenditures  for  the  next  6  months,  or  $6  million, \nwhichever  is  lower.  The  SOE  procedure  is  applicable  for  reimbursing  eligible  expenditures \nbelow $50,000 equivalent and liquidating advances provided for in the imprest account. \n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe  Government  will  submit \n\n43. \nto  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation. The PMO will prepare the reports. The PMO will particularly address progress \nin  meeting  the  project  targets.  The  progress  reports  will  include  information  on  the  physical \nprogress  of  works  and  the  status  of  the  training  and  local  governance  improvement  program. \nWithin 3 months of substantial physical completion of the Project, LGED will submit to ADB a \n\n\f13 \n\nproject  completion  report  that  will  cover  the  details  of  project  implementation,  cost,  benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation activities, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n44. \nLGED  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records  so  as  to  facilitate \nidentification  of  income  and  expenditures  related  to  the  Project.  The  PMO  will  be  assigned \nsufficient  and  qualified  accounting  staff,  including  a  financial  manager.  Auditors acceptable to \nADB  will  audit  all  the  accounts  and  statements  of  expenditures  and  revenues  related  to  the \nProject annually. The Foreign Aided Project Audit Directorate is considered acceptable for this \npurpose. The annual audit will include the audit of the imprest account and SOE procedure. The \nannual audit report will include a separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account and \nSOE procedure. Audited financial statements and project accounts, together with the report of \nthe auditor, will be submitted within 9 months of the close of the financial year. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n45. \nTo  ensure  that  project  activities  and  facilities  are  managed  efficiently  and  that  target \ngroups receive the intended benefits, a participatory benefit monitoring and evaluation program \nis  included  in  ADB\u2019s  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)  framework.  PPMS \nactivities will be conducted periodically to gather information through multiple sources to assess \nwhether the project inputs and activities have delivered the expected outputs and benefits to the \nintended  beneficiaries.  The  PPMS  also  seeks  to  detect  at  an  early  stage  any  discrepancy \nbetween  the  plan  and  the  execution  of  the  Project.  The  PMO  will  conduct  initial  district-level \nbaseline  physical  and  socioeconomic  surveys  and  submit  a  detailed  implementation  plan  for \nmonitoring  performance  and  for  preparing  benchmark  information  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and \nconcurrence  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  Thereafter,  the  PMO  will  submit  annual \nbenefit monitoring reports to ADB throughout the implementation period. \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\n46.  Many unions and components are covered by the Project; therefore, the regular reviews \nto be conducted by ADB at least twice a year will be supplemented by a formal midterm review, \nto be carried out jointly by the Government and ADB. The regular project reviews will include a \nreview  of  the  union  council\u2019s  financial  performance  and  staffing,  implementation  of  the  loan \ncovenants  and  reforms  at  the  union  level,  implementation  of  the  gender  action  plan,  physical \nprogress  of  project  implementation,  and  capacity-building  activities.  The  proposed  midterm \nreview  will  allow  the  Government  and  ADB  to  monitor  the  project  closely  and  to  make \nappropriate adjustments to the project design and implementation arrangements, if necessary. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Impacts \n\n47. \nEvaluation  of  the  quantifiable  economic  benefits  and  costs  shows  that  the  Project  is \neconomically  feasible,  with  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  22.8%.  The  basic \nassumptions on benefits and costs for the EIRR calculations were subjected to sensitivity tests \nunder various adverse scenarios. The results indicate that the project EIRR is robust in relation \nto changes in the basic assumptions. The summary economic analysis is in Appendix 8. \n \nThe  economic  impacts  of  the  Project  include  increased  economic  growth  and \n48. \nemployment  opportunities,  reduced  VOCs,  time  savings  for  road  users,  better  access  to \nmarkets  and  essential  services,  lower  prices  for  farm  inputs  and  consumption  goods,  better \n\n\f14 \n\nmarketing  opportunities,  and  increased  employment  opportunities  in  the  road  and  market \nconstruction and maintenance programs. These benefits will lead to a higher GDP growth rate. \nAt  present,  many  people  do  not  have  reliable  access  to  health,  markets,  and  educational \nservices  because  of  the  poor  condition  of  existing  roads.  The  quantified  economic  benefits \ninclude only reduced transport costs. The beneficiaries include (i) those benefiting directly from \nthe  investment,  that  is,  those  who  will  be  directly  employed  for  infrastructure  construction  and \nmaintenance, and the various categories of road users such as owners and operators of buses \nand  trucks,  the  passengers  of  the  various  vehicle  categories,  and  the  freight  owners;  and  (ii) \nthose benefiting indirectly because they live and work in the roads' area of influence. \n \nB. \n\nPoverty Reduction Impacts \n\nRural  infrastructure  investments  have  a  direct  impact  on  the  income  and  nonincome \n49. \ndimensions of poverty of all income groups. For the poor, the lack of affordable access deprives \nthem of job opportunities and even of very basic social services. Reliable and regular access to \neducation and health services contributes directly to the poor's accumulation of human capital, \nwhich is a key factor in sustainable poverty reduction. Improved access will help reduce poverty \nby  (i)  increasing  labor  mobility,  particularly  to  distant  markets;  (ii)  increasing  employment \nopportunities; (iii) reducing loss of perishables, thereby allowing for increased farmgate prices; \n(iv)  improving  access  to  rural  areas  by  health,  school,  veterinary,  and  rural  development \nworkers;  and  (v)  stimulating  the  creation  of  transport-associated  small  businesses  such  as \nservice  stations,  wayside  food  stalls,  and  guest  houses.  The  Project  will  hire  disadvantaged \ngroups and give first priority for employment to the poor and disadvantaged in the construction \nof  subprojects.  Appendix  9  gives  the  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy. \nDistribution analysis assessed the direct and quantifiable project benefits that will accrue to the \npoor in three core subprojects considered to be representative of the distributed impacts for the \nproject  area  as  a  whole.  The  benefits  included  the  savings  in  VOCs  for  motorized  and \nnonmotorized traffic on the FRBs. The benefits were allocated among the road users, unskilled \nconstruction  workers,  the  Government,  and  moneylenders.  When  the  gains  and  losses  of  all \nparties were netted, the three core subprojects had poverty impact ratios in the range of 0.34-\n6.45, indicating that the Project would have a strong impact on poverty. \n \nC. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n50. \nImproved  access  to  infrastructure  and  services  will  yield  significant  positive  social \nimpacts (paras. 48 and 49). The social benefits will be maximized by targeting construction work \nopportunities  for  local  people,  particularly  women.  When  formulating  subprojects,  the  existing \nand proposed education and health facilities will be considered so that benefits from improved \naccess  to  these  facilities  can  be  maximized.  The  multipurpose  use  of  union  complexes  as  a \nfocal  point  for  community  consultation  and  as  cyclone  shelters  in  the  southeastern  part  of  the \nproject area will also enhance positive impacts. The inclusion of poverty criteria in selecting and \nprioritizing subprojects will ensure that rural infrastructure investments are directed to the poorer \nareas.  No  indigenous  people  live  on  the  selected  roadsides.  However,  a  good  number  of \nminority/indigenous  people  will  potentially  benefit.  The  Project  will  ensure  their  participation  in \nplanning and implementing the Project and in obtaining benefits from the infrastructure. \n \nD. \n\nResettlement \n\nThe  main  socially  negative  impacts  of  infrastructure  projects  are  those  resulting  from \n51. \npermanent  land  acquisition.  In  this  Project  the  requirement  for  land  acquisition  will  be  minor \nbecause  roads  normally  follow  the  existing  alignments.  A  project  resettlement  framework  was \n\n\f15 \n\nprepared (Appendix 10) to ensure compliance with ADB's resettlement policy, and sample short \nresettlement plans for 3 core subprojects were prepared as supplementary appendixes. \n \nE. \n\nGender and Development Issues \n\n52. \nIn the project area, 50% of the population is women and most of them are engaged in \nfarm household activities. The Project has sought opportunities to address gender concerns by \n(i)  creating  scope  for  women\u2019s  participation  at  the  level  of  30%  of  total  membership,  from \nparticipatory  project  planning  to  implementation,  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (ii)  generating \nemployment opportunities for women by involving them in construction, maintenance, and tree \nplanting  activities  through  labor  contracting  societies;  (iii)  facilitating  linkages  of  rural  women \nbeneficiaries  to  different  support  resources  for  sustainability  of  their  livelihood;  and  (iv) \nfacilitating  social  and  economic  development  aimed  at  user  groups  as  a  follow-up measure to \nincreased  access  to  infrastructure  development  activities.  Women  will  also  be  supported  in \ndeveloping  entrepreneurship  by  reserving  market  stalls  for  women  and  creating  linkages  with \nmicrofinance  institutions.  The  component  on  LGED  capacity  building  and  improved  local \ngovernance  also  incorporates  the  gender  perspective  by  involving  and  training  women  in \nmanaging rural infrastructure. \n \n53. \nThe Project will employ specific measures to address gender issues in the project area \n(Appendix  11),  including  allocating  at  least  15%  of  the  growth  center  market  space  as  a \nwomen\u2019s market  section,  and  5-10  shops  for  the  use  of  women  shopkeepers;  gender-based \nemployment  targets  on  all  project  contracts;  encouraging  women  shop  owners  to  form \nassociations and to be represented in the market management committees and citizen forums; \nand  facilitating  linkages  with  microfinance  agencies  and  institutional  linkages  with  government \ndepartments  and  NGOs  handling  development  programs  for  women  such  as  extension, \ntechnology, market promotion, microfinance, and legal aid. \n \nF. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n54. \nDirect construction impacts are likely on soil (due to excavation for road fill material) and \nthere is a risk of pollution to surface water and groundwater. There will also be social disruption \nincluding  noise  and  dust,  along  with  possible  increased  accident  and  health  risks.  These \nimpacts  will  be  minimized  with  appropriate  environmental  management  measures  during  the \ndesign and construction phases. \n \nThe  main  impacts  of  the  proposed  Project  on  the  natural  environment  will  be  those \n55. \nassociated with possible changes in surface water flooding patterns as a result of constructing \nnew  embankments.  There  would  be  indirect  impacts  on  the  fish  resource  system  and  aquatic \nhabitats.  No  new  embankments  will  be  constructed  under  the  Project.  However,  adequate \ncross-drainage  structures  will  be  built  to  ensure  passage  of  floodwaters  without  causing \ndamage.  In  the  estuarine  areas  of  Khulna  and  Barisal  divisions,  structures  will  accommodate \nlocal  needs  for  flow  in  both  directions  or  gated  flow  in  one  direction  only.  The  main \nenvironmentally  sensitive  area  near  the  Project  is  the  Sundarbans,  which  is  internationally \nimportant. No interventions will be considered in the designated Sundarbans area, or in the four \nother  designated  ecologically  sensitive  sites  outside  it.  The  criteria  for  subproject  selection \nexplicitly exclude subprojects proposed in or near these environmentally sensitive areas. While \nthere is likely to be some need to cut roadside trees so as to widen the roads, sensitive planning \nand  a  roadside  tree-planting  program  will  more  than  compensate  for  those  lost.  A  summary \ninitial  environmental  examination  is  in  Appendix  12.  Initial  environmental  examinations  were \nundertaken  for  the  three  core  subprojects,  and  the  environmental  mitigation  measures  and \n\n\f16 \n\nenvironmental  monitoring  requirements  specified  in  the  examinations  will  be  adhered  to  in \nfinalizing all subprojects during implementation. \n \n56. \nLGED  recently  established  an  environmental  unit.  With  the  assistance  of  consultants, \nthe  unit's  capacity  to  undertake  environmental  and  social  impact  assessments  will  be \nstrengthened.  A  full-time  environmental  specialist  will  be  assigned  to  the  unit.  LGED  has  also \nrecognized the need to update the 1994 LGED environmental guidelines to conform with current \nlegal requirements for environmental assessment in Bangladesh. \n \nG. \n\nRisks \n\n57. \nThe Project has been carefully formulated to manage and mitigate risks. Advance action \nwill expedite recruitment of consultants to supervise detailed design and implementation. Risks \nfrom the use of inexperienced local contractors to carry out the civil works have been mitigated \nwith  their  participation  in  training  in  several  ADB  and  externally  financed  projects.  Measures \nsuch  as  advance  procurement  action,  use  of  ADB\u2019s  standard  tender  documentation,  and \nstrengthened  project  management  arrangements  will  minimize  potential  delays  in  project \nimplementation.  Civil  works  contracts  will  only  be  awarded  after  the  resettlement  plan  is \nimplemented, and when the rights to the land and  clearance of utilities and trees are obtained. \nThe  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  provide  counterpart  funding  through  budgetary  allocations \nwill also be required before ADB approves contract award. The Government has assured ADB \nof adequate annual budget allocations to maintain the project facilities after completion. \n \n58. \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  implementing  its  decentralization  policy  that  will  in \neffect  empower  the  union  councils.  However,  should  this  commitment  diminish,  the  Project's \nparticipatory  capacity  building  and  resource  mobilization  activities  at  the  union  level  will \nnonetheless  have  empowered  local  communities  to  provide  and  demand  delivery  of  better \nservices.  However,  this  risk  is  relatively  low  given  the  current  government  emphasis  on \ndecentralization, and commitment to introduce reforms. Stakeholder awareness raising courses \nare  also  included  in  the  Project\u2019s  training  program  to  inform  them  of  local  governance  issues \nand encourage them to demand better service delivery from government agencies. \n \nThere is currently a gap in funding for operation and maintenance of rural infrastructure, \n59. \nincluding roads. The Government has agreed to increase funding to meet future annual LGED \nmaintenance  requirements  and  is  exploring  options  for  increasing  maintenance  funding  for  all \nroads in the country. Introduction of a guaranteed mechanism for funding road maintenance\u2013the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to aid agencies\u2013will reduce this risk significantly. \n \n60. \nThe Project will (i) select contractors on the basis of their resources and experience with \nroad  construction;  (ii)  provide  assistance  to  contractors  by  having  the  project  consultant  offer \npractical  day-to-day  management  and  technical  advice;  and  (iii)  ensure  the  Government's \ncommitment  to  promote  a  viable  and  efficient  private  sector  contracting  industry  for  road \nconstruction, improvement, and maintenance works. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n61. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n\n\f17 \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nIf  cofinancing  by  the  German  Government  through  either  or  both  KfW  and  GTZ \nhas  not  been  obtained  by  30  September  2003,  the  scope  of  the  improved  rural \nroad infrastructure and improved rural infrastructure components will be reduced \naccordingly. \n\nSubprojects  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  criteria  agreed  upon  by  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  Each  subproject  will  be  implemented  with  the  prior \napproval of both LGED and ADB. Before obtaining such approval, the PMO will \nsubmit a subproject appraisal report for each subproject for review by the project \nimplementation  consultant.  The  subproject  appraisal  report  will  establish  the \ntechnical, financial, and economic viability of the subproject and its components \nas well as its social and environmental sustainability. The report will also include \na summary initial environmental examination, an initial social assessment, and a \nresettlement plan if necessary. \n\nFollowing ADB's approval of the subproject appraisal report, the concerned union \ncouncil  will  enter  into  a  subproject  agreement  with  LGED.  The  agreement  will \ncover  the  delegation  of  responsibility  for  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  of \nnon-FRB  rural  roads,  market  facilities,  boat  landings,  and  union  council \ncomplexes to local government bodies. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  approved  annual  development  program \nallocations  for  the  Project  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  all  counterpart  funding \nrequired for the Project in accordance with the financing plan, including the cost \nof  land  acquisition  and  other  resettlement  compensation,  implementation  and \nmonitoring  activities  under  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans,  utility \nrelocation, and general project management expenses. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  local  government  bodies  contribute  at  least \n10% in cash toward the construction cost of bridges and culverts on lower level \nrural roads (RR-2s and RR-3s), improvements to growth center markets and boat \nlandings, and construction of union council complexes. \n\nIn consultation with the concerned aid agencies, the Government will finalize the \nnational land transport policy before the midterm review. By the beginning of the \nyear 4 of the project, the Government will implement the recommendations of the \npolicy. \n\n(vii)  By  31  December  2003,  the  Government  will  issue  an  order  realigning \nmanagement and responsibility for the roads network as follows: (a) the national \nand regional roads (the primary road network) and those alone will be under the \nauthority  of  RHD;  (b)  all  feeder  roads  (FRAs  and  FRBs)  and  RR-1s (secondary \nroad network) will be under the authority of LGED; and (c) RR-2 and RR-3 rural \nroads (the tertiary road network) will be under the authority of the subdistricts and \nunion councils. \n\n(viii)  Before  the  midterm  review,  the  Government  will  examine  the  need  for  a  road \n\ntransport and traffic bill. \n\n(ix)  Within  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  approved  the \nrecommendations of the LGED study on local resource mobilization and will have \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nbegun  to  implement  the  strategies  for  increasing  funds  allocation  to  union \ncouncils, and union council resource mobilization authority. \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nLGED  will  continue  to  implement  fully  the  recommendations  of  the  LGED \nmanagement  capability  strengthening  report,  and  will  prepare  an  update  to  the \nreport  by  30  September  2003,  with  a  particular  focus  on  strengthening  LGED\u2019s \nmanagement and impact evaluation capacity. \n\nBy  31  March  2003,  the  Government  will  have  finalized  the  revised  policy  on \nleasing  of  marketplaces  and  market  management committee membership, and \nwill  have  adopted  all  measures  needed  to  implement  the  policy.  To  increase \nresources  available  to  the  union  councils  for  infrastructure  development  and \nthe \nmaintenance, \nregulations for sharing the market lease revenue, and introduce more transparent \nprocedures and greater competition in market leasing in the project area. \n\nthe  Government  will  review  and  subsequently  amend \n\n(xii) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \napplicable  labor  laws.  Bidding  documents  will  include  a  clause  prohibiting  child \nlabor  for  construction  and  maintenance  activities,  and  a  clause  regarding  equal \npay  for  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value.  Compliance  with  these \nprovisions will be strictly monitored during project implementation. \n\n(xiii)  Within  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  issue  a  directive \nsetting  employment  targets  for  poor  and  vulnerable  people,  particularly  women, \nfor  road  improvement  and  maintenance  and  other  infrastructure  construction \nactivities. The Government will also adopt all necessary measures to reach these \ntargets,  including  ensuring  the  provision  of  appropriate  facilities  for  women  and \nchildren in construction campsites. \n\n(xiv)   Before 30 June of each year during project implementation, LGED will agree with \nADB on the annual maintenance program for feeder and rural roads in the project \narea for the following year. By 31 May of every year, LGED will submit to ADB for \nreview, the proposed maintenance budget. \n\n(xv) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  for  the  entire  project  implementation  period, \nsufficient  budget  will  be  allocated  to  fund  fully  all  routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance  activities  for  roads  that  fall  under  LGED\u2019s  responsibility.  This \namount  will  include  budget  allocations  from  all  sources,  including  aid-financed \nproject funds and food aid allocated for maintenance works. \n\n(xvi)  The Government will adopt all necessary measures to ensure that construction \nand maintenance equipment is well maintained and replaced when needed. Such \nmeasures will include, but will not be limited to, the following: (a) RHD and LGED \nwill set the charges for renting their equipment at a sufficiently high level to cover \nthe  maintenance  and  replacement  costs  of  such  equipment;  and  (b)  the \nGovernment will annually make available to LGED funds at a level not less than \nthe estimated rent collected for the equipment in the following financial year. This \nwill  be  done  through  budget  allocations  into  a  separate  identifiable  item  in  the \nbudget  of  RHD  and  LGED.  RHD  and  LGED  will  ensure  that  the  budget \nallocations  of  these  accounts  will  be  used  exclusively  to  fund  the  maintenance \nand replacement of the equipment. \n\n\f19 \n\n(xvii)  The union development coordination committees to be established in each of the \n32  pilot  unions  under  the  LGED  capacity  building  and  local  governance \nimprovement  component  will  be  chaired  by  the  union  council  chairpersons  and \nwill have representatives from line agencies\u2019 staff, NGOs and representatives of \nunion  market  management  committees,  local  village  leaders,  the  private  sector, \nand community members. \n\n(xviii)  LGED  will  assign  at  least  16  community  organizers  to  coordinate  with  the  pilot \nunions to expedite the implementation of project activities and local governance \nimprovement. The organizers will submit monthly progress reports to the PMO. \n\n(xix)   LGD  and  LGED  will  take  all  necessary  steps  to  thoroughly  test  the  concept  of \npooling  revenues  from  the  growth  center  markets  in  each  of  the  pilot  unions.  It \nwill  delegate  responsibility  for  the  use  of  the  funds  to  the  concerned  union \ncouncils  and  provide  matching  funds  for  those  unions  that  demonstrate  good \nperformance in increasing resource mobilization. \n\n(xx)  By 31 December 2003, the Government will have approved a time-bound action \nplan  to  increase  private  sector  participation  in  road  construction  and  periodic \nmaintenance.  The  action  plan  should  reflect  the  recommendations  of  the \nfeasibility  study  on  such  participation,  which  will  be  prepared  by  the  Project\u2019s \nimplementation consultant. \n\n(xxi)  By  30  June  2003,  the  Government  will  have  established  a  committee  with \nrepresentatives from the private sector road construction companies, equipment \nleasing  companies,  and  RHD  and  LGED  to  advise  on  the  preparation  and \nimplementation of the action plan mentioned in (xx). \n\n(xxii)  LGED will ensure that all necessary steps are taken to implement the summary \ninitial  environmental  examination,  the  initial  social  assessment,  and  the project \nresettlement framework. Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, LGED will update \nits  1994  environmental  guidelines \nlegal \nin  conformity  with \nrequirements for environmental assessment in Bangladesh. \n\nthe  current \n\n(xxiii)  On  completion  of  the  detailed  design  of  the  three  core  subprojects  prepared \nduring  the  TA,  the  Government  will  update  the  resettlement  plans  and  ensure \nthat  census  information  and  a  full  inventory  of  losses  are  included.  The \nentitlement matrix will be revised if additional categories of affected persons are \ndetermined.  A  condition  for  award  of  civil  works  contracts  for  those  core \nsubprojects  will  be  the  submission  of  an  updated  resettlement  plan  for  each \nsubproject,  consistent  with  the  provisions  of  the  resettlement  framework  and  in \nform and substance acceptable to ADB. \n\n(xxiv)   The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  people  affected  by  land  acquisition  will  be \ncompensated  prior  to  possession  of  land  and  assets.  Compensation based on \nreplacement cost will be done in a manner satisfactory to ADB. \n\n(xxv)   The  Government  will  ensure  that  LGED  will  complete  all  preparatory  works  for \nland  acquisition  before  submitting  the  subproject  appraisal  reports.  Actual  land \nacquisition must be completed within 365 days from the signing of the subproject \nagreement; if not, the subproject will be removed from the Project. If involuntary \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \nB. \n\n62. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nresettlement  and  land  or  asset  acquisition  are  required,  a  resettlement  plan  will \nbe  included  in  the  subproject  appraisal  report.  LGED  will  publicly  disclose  the \nresettlement plan for each subproject. The resettlement plan will be prepared in \naccordance  with  the  project  resettlement  framework  included  in  the  loan \ndocuments and ADB\u2019s Handbook  on  Resettlement, and will  include a complete \ncensus and inventory of losses. The PMO will not award any civil works contract \nfor  any  subproject  unless  a  resettlement  plan  for  such  subproject,  in  form  and \nsubstance  acceptable  to  ADB,  has  been  submitted  to  and  approved  by  LGED \nand  ADB.  Land  acquisition  work  including  compensation  payments  will  be \ncompleted  prior  to  possession  of  land  and  other  assets,  in  accordance  with  the \nagreed upon resettlement plan. \n\n(xxvi)  The Government will take all necessary steps to ensure full implementation of the \n\nProject\u2019s gender action plan. \n\n(xxvii)  The  Government  will  cause  LGED  to  implement  in  full  all  the  provisions  of \nLGED\u2019s  gender  action  plan  for  the  Project's  duration.  To  this  end,  the  PMO  will \nprepare  field  manuals  for  the  gender  action  plan  and  conduct  training for PMO \nstaff.  \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe following are the

The  economic  evaluation  examines  a  set  of  20  sample  roads \nrepresentative of all FRBs in the project area. These sample roads were selected in a feasibility \nstudy  undertaken  by  the  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED).  Quantifiable \nbenefits of the FRB investment include savings in vehicle operating costs (VOCs), time savings \nfor  motorized  traffic,  and  savings  in  operational  and  time  costs  for  nonmotorized  traffic.  To  be \nconservative, the economic analysis estimated costs and benefits with and without the project, \nbut excluded time savings. \n \n\n1. \n\nRoad Condition and Existing Traffic \n\n \nRoad condition in terms of roughness is measured by the international roughness index \n2. \nin  meters  per  kilometer  (m/km).  In  the  without-project  situation,  earth  roads  have  an  average \nroughness index of 15 m/km; herringbone brick roads, 12 m/km; and bituminous carpet roads, 8 \nm/km.  With  the  Project,  road  roughness  is  estimated to reduce to 4.0 m/km. It was assumed \nthat  there  are  five  classes  of  motorized  vehicles  and  four  classes  of  nonmotorized  vehicles, \nprimarily with light load factors. Traffic counts were undertaken to identify existing traffic on each \nof the 20 subproject roads. In calculating the annual average daily traffic for the base year, the \ncounts were adjusted to reflect market days and seasonal differences in traffic. \n \n\n2. \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n3. \nA  review  of  historical  information  and  recent  studies  indicates  that  transport  of  both \nfreight  and  passengers  has  grown  at  an  average  rate  of  approximately  8%  per  year  over  the \npast  decade.  This  relatively  high  rate  of  growth  is  primarily  due  to  improvements  in  the  road \ntransport  subsector  and  the  growth  of  the  Bangladesh  economy.  The  economy  is  expected  to \ncontinue  growing  rapidly  over  the  next  decade.  The  rate  of  traffic  growth  in  Bangladesh  is \nderived  from  the  rate  of  growth  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and  the  income  elasticity  of \ndemand for transport with respect to the GDP. The gross domestic income elasticity of demand \nfor  transport  in  Bangladesh  is  about  1.5  for  both  passengers  and  freight.  The  average  annual \ngrowth rate of real GDP over the last decade is 5.5%, but there has been a slowdown in the last \nfew  years  because  of  crop  failures.  The  current  projection  for  annual  growth  in  GDP  is  5%, \nsuggesting annual traffic growth rates of 7-8% for Bangladesh. A standard set of traffic growth \nrates was adopted for the project evaluation. These rates reflect historical and forecast growth \nrates for the population and the economy, historical average traffic growth rates, and proposed \nimprovements for rural roads and associated infrastructure under the Project. \n \n4. \nNormal traffic forecasts for each subproject road were calculated using base year traffic \nlevels and the rates of traffic growth. Generated traffic was not included in the traffic forecasts. \nFor subproject roads in poor condition and with no existing  bus traffic, the with-Project scenario \nassumed that at least 2% of the motorized traffic will be light bus traffic. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\n5. \nThe  economic  analysis  compared  estimated  benefits  and  costs  of  the  Project  for  20 \nyears\u2019  operation  after  completion  of  civil  works.  Valued  in  2002  constant  prices,  the  project \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nbenefits and costs in financial prices were adjusted to economic prices by deducting taxes and \nduties, and by applying a conversion factor of 0.8 to nontraded local currency costs, used as the \nstandard conversion factor for the Bangladesh road sector. \n \n\n1. \n\nCosts \n\n6. \nThe  economic  evaluation  of  the  subproject  roads  included  the  costs  associated  with \nupgrading FRBs, improving other rural infrastructure, strengthening LGED and local government \ncapacity,  improving  maintenance  procedures,  and  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Including \nphysical  contingencies,  but  excluding  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction, \nfinancial costs were converted to economic costs using a conversion factor of 0.8. Incremental \nmaintenance  costs  were  calculated  as  the  difference  in  maintenance  requirements  with  and \nwithout the Project. It was assumed that in the without-Project scenario, the roads would receive \nminimal  routine  maintenance  and  spot  improvements.  The  with-Project  scenario  includes  full \nroutine  maintenance  and  a  periodic  maintenance  reseal  every  5  years.  No  residual  value  was \nconsidered at the end of the project life. \n \n\n2. \n\nBenefits \n\n7. \nImproved road pavements and surfaces with the Project would reduce travel costs for all \nroad  users.  This  would  include  a  reduction  in  VOC  and  time  costs  for  motorized  and \nnonmotorized vehicles. Factors influencing VOCs include vehicle speed, horizontal and vertical \nalignments  of  the  road,  and  the  physical  condition  of  the  road  surface,  in  addition  to  vehicle \ntype, price, age and load. For each year in the analysis period for all vehicle classes, highway \ndesign  and  maintenance  model  version  4  (HDM-4)  was  used  to  calculate  pavement \ndeterioration in the with- and without-project scenarios based on traffic levels and road design, \nand  to  calculate  the  annual  economic  VOC  and  time  savings  using  forecast  future  road \nroughness. No changes were made to the technical data in HDM-4. The input is in 2002 prices \nand  is  net  of  taxes,  duties,  and  other  charges.  The  output  of  the  model  includes  physical \nquantities of road consumption and speed, and the associated VOC per predefined unit of 1,000 \nvehicle-kilometers.  \n \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  generate  additional  benefits  that  have  not  been  quantified. \n8. \nThese  benefits  include  improved  access  to  education  and  health  facilities,  reductions  in  rural \npoverty by employing the poor to improve the roads and other rural infrastructure, and maintain \nthe  roads.  Lower  rural  transport  costs  and  travel  times  also  encourage  increased  agricultural \nproduction  of  higher  yielding  rice  and  other  crops  because  of  lower  prices  for  fertilizers  and \nhigher  farm  and  market  prices.  Lower  transport  costs,  improved  access,  and  mobility  also \nencourage nonagricultural job creation in the service sector. \n \n\n3. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) \n\n9. \nThe economic evaluation of the subproject roads compared costs and benefits with and \nwithout  the  Project.  It  assumed  that  the  project  capital  costs  would  be  incurred  in  2003-2004, \nand that the project benefits would start in 2005 and would continue for 20 years until 2024. The \nbasic  quantified  benefits  are  savings  in  road  user  VOCs  and  savings  in  operational  costs  for \nnonmotorized  traffic.  These  benefits  were  compared  with  the  economic  costs  of  road \nimprovement and maintenance. The net benefits were then used to calculate the EIRR. All costs \nand benefits were estimated net of duties and taxes, and are expressed in constant 2002 prices. \nThe  EIRR  was  calculated  for  each  subproject  road  and  for  each  section  of  each  road  of  a \ndifferent  pavement  construction  type.  The  EIRR  for  the  individual  project  roads  ranged  from \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n39 \n\n6.5% to 64.3%, while the EIRR of pavement sections ranged from 1.6% for a bituminous carpet \nsection  in  fair  condition  to  99.0%  for  an  earth  section  in  poor  condition.  The  results  of  the \neconomic evaluation of individual subproject roads are summarized in Table A8.1. \n \n\nTable A8.1: Economic Internal Rates of Return of Subproject Roads \n\nName of FRB \n \nMirpur \u2013 Bheramara \nMeherpur \u2013  Dariapur \nDaulatgonj \u2013 Sabadalpur \nKotchandpur \u2013 Gunna \nKharaguda \u2013 Katlamari \nSingra \u2013 Shimankhali \nTularampur \u2013 Sheilkhati \n\nChowgacha  \u2013 Arpara \nHaibatpur \u2013 Hasimpur \nDigholia \u2013 Arua \nBarakpur \u2013 Polathat \nCharkhulia \u2013 Kachuria \nKaligonj \u2013 Assasuni \nMuladihat \u2013 Mridrahat \nPirojpur \u2013 Sreeramkati \nRajapur \u2013 Balorjore \nSubitkhali \u2013 Kakrabunia \nJhaudia \u2013 Halsha \nChandkhali \u2013 Paikgacha \nJhalokati \u2013 Manpasha \n\nBituminous \n \n6.9 \n10.3 \n\n \n\nEIRR by Section (%) \n\nEIRR \n(%) of \nEarth  Brick  Macadam  Road \n64.3 \n64.3 \n16.6 \n36.4 \n35.7 \n41.4 \n17.8 \n45.7 \n26.1 \n39.0 \n19.8 \n24.7 \n24.3 \n27.8 \n\n \n \n43.0 \n \n11.1 \n \n \n\n \n \n15.1 \n9.3 \n12.6 \n5.4 \n \n\n81.9 \n20.7 \n99.0 \n41.2 \n22.9 \n42.8 \n23.5 \n85.3 \n13.4 \n \n25.3 \n85.3 \n37.8 \n\n \n23.5 \n28.4 \n13.0 \n \n15.6 \n2.8 \n23.2 \n2.5 \n14.0 \n5.7 \n23.2 \n14.6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n71.6 \n57.7 \n37.6 \n36.2 \n21.6 \n20.3 \n8.3 \n13.8 \n6.5 \n14.0 \n13.1 \n40.6 \n27.0 \n\n10.2 \n3.4 \n4.8 \n\n20.2 \n19.7 \n23.2 \n10.4 \n1.6 \n12.9 \n \n17.7 \n \n \n3.5 \n17.7 \n9.9 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n22.8% \n\nEIRR All Subproject Roads \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; FRB = feeder road type B. \n\n \n \n10. \nAs  indicated  in  Table  A8.1,  benefits  from  upgrading  the  existing  earth  road  sections  to \nan  all-weather  sealed  surface  are  high.  The  upgrading  of  all  earth  sections  is  economically \njustified.  However,  upgrading  a  brick  or  bituminous  section  of  a  road  is  likely  to  generate \nrelatively  lower  economic  benefits,  suggesting  that  priority  should  be  given  to  upgrading  the \nearth  sections  to  provide  an  all-weather  road.  The  overall  cost  and  benefit  streams  for \nupgrading the 20 sample subproject roads resulted in an EIRR of 22.8%. The result reflects the \nhigh level of benefits associated with providing all-weather access in a rural environment. The \neconomic evaluation demonstrates that upgrading the project roads is economically justified. \n \n11. \nThe  results  in  Table  A8.1  represent  the  most  conservative  estimates  of  the  EIRR, \nexcluding time savings for motorized and nonmotorized traffic. However, studies on the impact \nof improving rural roads and markets have found that travel time costs are reduced considerably \nwhen an all-weather FRB road is provided. Other factors that may affect the economic benefits \nand feasibility of the proposed road improvements include (i) delayed periodic maintenance of \nimproved roads and subsequent deterioration of the upgraded roads, (ii) reduced traffic growth \nrates, (iii) increased construction costs, and (iv) reduced nonmotorized traffic benefits. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nFull  evaluation  of  the  20  subproject  roads  including  benefits  from  passenger  time \n12. \nsavings was carried out by rerunning HDM-4 for all sections of each subproject road. Including \nbenefits  in  passenger  time  savings  significantly  increased  the  quantified  benefits  of  upgrading \nthose subproject roads. The overall package of 20 subproject roads had an EIRR of 66.5%, with \npassenger  time  savings  included.  The  significant  increase  in  EIRR  reflects  the  scale  of \npassenger time savings compared with other benefits. The major part of existing traffic on the \nproject  roads  is  nonmotorized  vehicles  that  have  very  low  financial  operating  costs.  The  main \neconomic  costs  for  these  vehicles  are  the  time  of  the  operator  and  the  opportunity  time  of \npassengers. When FRB earth roads in poor condition are upgraded to good sealed roads, the \nspeed  of  rickshaws  and  rickshaw  vans  on  those  roads  will  increase  by  more  than  400%.  The \nincrease  will  significantly  improve  the  productivity  of  the  rickshaw  operators, so that they can \nlower their charges. Lower charges and potential time savings encourage additional customers \nand additional economic activity, especially by those who participate in the cash economy. \n \n13. \nHDM-4 was also rerun to test the sensitivity of subproject road improvements to a 5-year \ndelay  in  periodic  maintenance.  The  present  LGED  practice  is  to  reseal  roads  every  4-5 years \nand  it  is  likely  that  this  timing  would  apply  to  the  project  roads.  The  analysis  indicated that if \nperiodic resealing were delayed 5 years and normal routine patching and potholing continued, \nthe EIRR for the improved subproject roads would increase from 22.8% to 23.8%. This suggests \nthat it may be appropriate to conduct pavement surface trials in the project areas to determine \nthe  optimum  timing  for  periodic  reseals  for  FRB  roads.  If  the  4-5  year  reseal  program  is \nsupported  by  the  research  results,  then  there  is  a  need  to  recalibrate  HDM-4 to better model \nBangladesh rural road conditions. The Project will provide assistance in refining the model. \n \nThe annual traffic growth rates used indicate a 343% increase in traffic over the 22-year \n14. \nproject life. However, if economic growth in Bangladesh were to fall to only 3% per annum, it is \npossible that traffic growth rates in the project area would fall to approximately 4.5% per annum. \nThis is equivalent to a 23% reduction in traffic volumes over the project life. When traffic growth \nrates were reduced to 4.5% per annum for all vehicle classes, the EIRR for all subproject roads \nfell  from  22.8%  to  17.6%.  Similarly  a  15%  increase  in  capital  costs  reduces  the  EIRR  from \n22.8% to 20.3%. A corresponding 15% decrease in motorized and nonmotorized traffic benefits \nwould reduce the EIRR to 19.5%. Generally, the results of the sensitivity tests indicate that the \nProject\u2019s viability is robust to adverse changes in key variables. \n \nThe  sensitivity  indicator1  was  calculated.  The  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  are  in \n15. \nTable  A8.2.  Switching  values2  were  also  calculated.

Investments  in  social  infrastructure  (education,  health, \nand nutrition) and physical infrastructure (roads, electricity, and flood control) are seen as important \ninputs  for  sustainable  poverty  reduction.  The  impact  of  rural  infrastructure  on  poverty  reduction  is \nwell  documented  in  the  development  literature  of  Bangladesh.  Roads  and  growth  centers  can \ninfluence  poverty  reduction  by  creating  new  employment  opportunities,  especially  in  the  nonfarm \nsectors, changing input and output prices, and through higher wages. \n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  creating  sustainable  seasonal  and  long-term \nemployment  opportunities  targeted  to  the  poor.  Increased  levels  of  transport  services  will  create \nemployment for the poor on bus, truck, and other traditional modes of transport plying rural roads. \nSimilarly,  the  improved  growth  centers  are  expected  to  serve  landless  and  marginal  farmers,  and \nsmall  traders.  The  Project  is  expected  to  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  socioeconomic \ndevelopment  of  the  region  by  providing  immediate  economic  benefits  to  farmers,  merchants,  and \nother  occupational  groups  including  poor  men  and  women,  through  better  access  to  goods  and \nservices. The improvement of feeder roads type B (about 1,030 kilometers), 60 growth centers, 50 \nboat  landings,  and  5  ferries  will  improve  access  to  markets,  social  facilities,  and  employment \nopportunities.  \n \nThe  infrastructure  improvement  undertaken  by  the  Project  will  directly  generate  income-earning \nopportunities of about 50,000 person-years for the poor. \n \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\nProposed Classification: Poverty intervention \n\nThe  people  below  the  poverty  line  in  the  country  declined  by  about  1  percentage  point  annually \nover the last decade. The household income and expenditure survey of the Bangladesh Bureau of \nStatistics 2000 shows that about 50% of the population of the country lived below the upper poverty \nline  in  2000.  Over  the  last  decade,  rural  poverty  remained  more  extensive  than  urban  poverty.  In \nBarisal  (40%)  and  Khulna  (51%)  divisions  together,  47%  of  the  people  were  below  the  upper \npoverty  line  in  2000.  In  the  decade  ending  in  2000,  poverty  incidence  in  these  two  divisions \ndeclined by about 1.4 percentage points per year. Although poverty incidence in the two divisions is \nslightly  below  the  national  average,  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  in  FY2000  was  lower  in \nBarisal  ($306)  and  Khulna  ($355)  than  the  national  average  ($363).  In  some  of  the  districts  of \nKhulna and Barisal, poverty incidence is greater than the divisional and national averages. Over 11 \nmillion  people  in  Khulna  and  Barisal  are  poor.  The  mean  per  capita  expenditure  during  the  last \ndecade increased by 2.1% annually in these divisions, compared with the annual increase of 2.4% \nin the national average. \n \nAccording to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics 2000, household income and expenditure survey, \nthe  cost-of-basic-need  poverty  lines  expressed  as  Tk/person/month  in  Barisal  (covering  rural \nBarisal,  Patuakali)  were  Tk616  (upper  poverty  line)  and  Tk546  (lower  poverty  line).  In  Khulna \n(covering  rural  Khulna,  Jessore,  Kushtia),  the  cost-of-basic-need  poverty  lines  in  Tk/person/month \nare Tk624 (upper) and Tk527 (lower). \n \n \n\n \n\nB. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n43 \n\nThe  direct  benefit  to  the  poor  from  the  Project  will  be  employment  opportunities  in  infrastructure \nconstruction  and  maintenance  activities.  An  estimated  135,000  person-years  of  employment \nopportunities will be creat ed for unskilled laborers and an estimated 30% of the employment will be \ngenerated for women (Appendix 11, Summary Gender Action Plan). \n \nRoad networks will create employment for large numbers of poor as transport workers or operators, \nancillary support and service providers, and traders. Transport operation costs will be reduced and \npeople  including  men,  women,  and  children  will  have  better  access  to  service  facilities  and \ninstitutions  including  education,  health,  microfinance  and  small  enterprises  due  to  improved  year-\nround  communication.  Travel  time  will  be  short.  The  market  infrastructure  will  lead  to  better  prices \nof  locally  produced  goods  and  services,  including  increased  volume  of  trading  and  improved \nstorage.  Environmental  conditions  in  market  areas  will  be  significantly  improved.  An  important \nelement  of  the  market  infrastructure  is  to  increase  the  self-reliance of poor women through their \naccess  to  market  infrastructure.  In  addition,  microfinance  agencies  including  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs)  will  be  encouraged  to  expand  their  credit  support  programs  in  the  project \narea,  especially  to  the  women  shop  owners  to  increase  their  access  to  financial  resources. \nImproved  rural  infrastructure  will  also  have  a  favorable  impact  on  agricultural  and  nonagricultural \nwages, and agricultural output prices. \n \n\n \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nThe  infrastructure  and  other  project  components  were  discussed  with  the  union  councils  and  all \nmajor  stakeholders  in  25  field  workshops.  The  outputs  were  (i)  formulation  of  criteria  for selecting \nroads,  growth  centers,  and  boat  landings  for  improvement;  and  (ii)  identification  of  roads,  growth \ncenters,  and  boat  landings  of  each  subdistrict.  The  selection  was  confirmed  during  two  regional \nworkshops.  There  were  recommendations  on  mechanisms  to  enhance  the  capacity  of  union \ncouncils,  ways  to  ensure  participation  of  women,  and  means  to  build  the  Local  Government \nEngineering Department\u2019s (LGED's) capacity. \n \nTo  strengthen  the  union  councils  and  for  greater  sustainability  of  the  infrastructure,  a  participatory \napproach will be followed in implementation. The Project will emphasize stakeholders\u2019 participation \nin  implementation,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  improved  rural  infrastructure;  and  union-level \ngovernance and revenue generation. \n \nIn the  pilot  unions,  union  development  coordination  committees  consisting  of  union  council  and \nservice-providing  agencies  will  be  established.  Citizens\u2019  (including  women\u2019s)  participation  in \nplanning  of  union  council  activities  will  be  ensured  through  citizens'-  forums.  Regular  interaction \nbetween  the  union  councils  and  citizens  will  be  promoted  through  joint  meetings,  rallies,  and \nconsultations  at  the  union  and  ward  levels.  Women\u2019s  participation  in  market  management \ncommittees,  infrastructure  maintenance,  and  markets  will  be  promoted.  NGOs  will  support \nestablishment of the participatory process in union council governance. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nD. \n\nPotential Issues \n\nSignificant/ \nNon-\nSignificant/ \nUncertain/ \nNone \n\nResettlement/\nCompensation \n\nUncertain \n \n \n \n\nGender \n\nSignificant \n\nIssues \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nIn most feeder roads, there will be some minor \nland acquisition. Existing unimproved roads have \nbeen selected for improvement. Land acquisition \nand compensation requirements will be identified \nand addressed during implementation and before \nstarting improvement of any road or growth center \nmarket. \n\nA resettlement \nframework and \nresettlement \nplans for three \nsubprojects have \nbeen prepared. \n\nPlan \nRequired \n \n\nA detailed gender \naction plan has \nbeen prepared. \n\nInfrastructure is considered a domain of men. The \ninfrastructure components of the Project will \naddress women\u2019s needs in the design of the \ninfrastructure, such as union council complexes \nand women\u2019s market corners. The Project will \nincrease women\u2019s access to infrastructure as \nusers of markets, union council complexes, and \nroads. Short-term and seasonal employment in \nimproving and maintaining infrastructure will be \ncreated. Employment and income-earning \nopportunities in women market corners will be \ngenerated. \n \nThe Project will promote the effective participation \nof women in governance and will facilitate (i) \nstrengthening of the role of female union council \nmembers through capacity building to plan, \ncoordinate activities, be involved in development \nactivities and union development coordination \ncommittees and clarification of their roles and \nresponsibilities; (ii) introducing gender issues \nwithin LGED and union councils; and (iii) \nincreasing the participation of women through \nrecruitment and provisions of a quota in \nmanagement committees. \n\nThe rural people lack access to improved \ninfrastructure. The Project will therefore create \naccess to infrastructure. Union councils will make \ncash contributions of 10% to the costs of growth \ncenters, union council complexes, boat landings \nand rural road drainage structures, to be met from \ntheir budgets. \n\nAffordability \n\nNonsignificant \n\nNone \n\nLabor \n\nSignificant \n\n \n\nNo adverse impact is anticipated. The Project will \nhave a significantly positive impact by creating \njobs for both skilled and unskilled laborers during \nand after infrastructure improvement. Poor women \nwill obtain employment during construction and \nmaintenance.

The Project will attempt to reduce the gap \nin wages paid to women and men in construction \nwork. \n\nNo indigenous people live on the selected \nroadsides. However, a substantial number of \nminority/indigenous people will potentially benefit \nfrom the Project. About 2,000 to 2,500 Hindu \nweavers live within the catchment area of \nJhaudia-Halsha road in Kushtia Sadar subdistrict. \nThey will benefit from the improved road and \ngrowth center in marketing their products. \nSimilarly the Rakhain community (Buddhists) in \nKalarpara subdistrict, Paluakhali who are mostly \nengaged in nonagricultural activities (weaving, \nsmall trade, and cottage industries) will also \nderive benefits from marketing their products. The \nProject will ensure their participation in planning \nand implementing the Project and in obtaining \nbenefits from the infrastructure. \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n45 \n\nPlan \nRequired \n \n\nThe Project will \nensure that \nduring the \nselection of shop \nowners, women \nmaintenance \ncrews and users \nof infrastructure \nfacilities, \nmembers of \nthese minority \ngroups will also \nbe targeted.

No new infrastructure will be built in \nerosion-prone places.  \n\nNGOs will be \nencouraged to \nstrengthen their \nactivities.  \n\nThe border districts in Khulna division, especially \nSatkhira, Jessore and Kushtia, are both source \nand routes for human trafficking, especially \nwomen and children. Some other areas in both \nKhulna and Barisal divisions are routes for \ntrafficking. The employment opportunities created \nwill significantly contribute to reducing \nvulnerability, migration, and trafficking.

About  22.6  million  people  will  benefit \ndirectly  or  indirectly  from  implementation  of  the  Project  in  16  districts:  10  in  Khulna  and  6  in \nBarisal divisions. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  improve  small-scale  rural  infrastructure\u2013improvement of rural roads for \nbetter access to markets, development of ferry landing sites in this riverine region, improvement \nof market growth centers to a certain standard according to the criteria established by the Local \nGovernment Engineering Department (LGED), the Project\u2019s Executing Agency. \n \n3. \nThree core subprojects have been planned by evaluating various design factors, with full \nconsultation  with  and  participation  of  the  stakeholders.  An  overall  development  plan  and \nprioritization  of  the  project  investment  plan  will  be  prepared  for  the  whole  project  area  using \nlessons learned from the planning of these core projects. \n \nThe  three  subprojects  were  selected  from  three  districts:  Kushtia,  Khulna,  and \n4. \nJhalokathi.  About  31  kilometers  (km)  of  road  will  be  widened  and  improved,  and  two  market \ngrowth  centers  and  three  union  council  offices  will  be  improved.  Resettlement  plans  were \nprepared for these three core subprojects that will also serve as models for addressing potential \nresettlement issues in other subprojects. About 1.5 hectares of land, mostly along the existing \nroad, will be acquired. This will entail partial relocation and shifting of about 120 existing housing \nor business entities, and loss of agricultural land, fishing ponds, and livelihood. \n \nThe actual amount of land to be acquired and the number of people to be affected will be \n5. \nfinalized  after  conducting  detailed  socioeconomic  surveys  in  conjunction  with  the  subproject \ndesign. This resettlement framework will be used in preparing plans to resettle and rehabilitate \nthe  project-affected  persons,  and  guide \nimplementation  stages. \nImplementation of the subprojects is expected to start in the third quarter of 2003. \n \nB. \n \nThe  current  legislation  governing  land  acquisition  for  public  purposes  is  the  Acquisition \n6. \nand  Requisition  of  Immovable  Property  Ordinance  (Ordinance  II  of  1982)  and  its  subsequent \namendments  in  1993  and  1994.  The  1982  ordinance  is  the  only  law  that  governs  all  cases  of \nacquisition  and  requisition  by  the  Government  of  immovable  property  (land,  crops,  and  built \nstructures)  for  any  public  purpose  or  in  the  public  interest.  The  ordinance  does  not  cover \nproject-affected persons without title or ownership records such as informal settlers or squatters. \nFurther,  in  most  cases,  the  compensation  does  not  constitute  market  or  replacement value of \nthe property acquired. \n \n7. \nIn  the  absence  of  a  government  policy  consistent  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) policy on involuntary resettlement, poverty reduction, and social development, a project-\nspecific  resettlement  policy  framework  and  resettlement  procedure  guidelines  will  be  adopted. \nThe framework and guidelines in this appendix will apply to all subprojects to be prepared and \napproved under the Project. It will ensure that persons affected by land acquisition permanently \nor temporarily losing livelihood will be eligible for appropriate compensation in the Project. \n\nResettlement Policy Framework \n\nthe  preparation  and \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nResettlement Procedural Guidelines \n\nThe resettlement policy framework reflects the Government\u2019s land acquisition laws and \n8. \nregulations  and  ADB  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  guidelines.  It  stipulates  eligibility \nand provisions for all types of losses (land, crop, trees, fish, structures, business, employment, \nworkdays,  wages,  and  social  infrastructure).  Land  for  land  will  not  be  feasible  because \nreplacement land is not available. As land acquisition will be minimal, project-affected persons\u2019 \nlivelihoods  will  be  most  affected.  Lost  livelihood  will  be  compensated  at  full  replacement  cost, \nwhich will help the affected persons to rehabilitate themselves to a great extent. \n \nAffected  households  compensated  by  the  district  deputy  commissioner  for  lost  assets \n9. \nwill  receive  (i)  an  additional  cash  grant  to  match  replacement  market  value,  and  (ii)  other \nresettlement  assistance  such  as  shifting  allowance  and  compensation  for  loss  of  business, \nworkdays,  and  income  because  of  dislocation.  Households  headed  by  females  and  other \nvulnerable households will be eligible for further cash assistance to relocate and to reconstruct \nhouse or structure. Table A10 presents the measures adopted in the resettlement plan on land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  issues  to  bridge  the  gap  between  the  ADB  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement and the Government policy on land acquisition, and assessment and valuation of \nacquired property. \n \nC. \n \nThe summary resettlement plans for the three core subprojects are in the supplementary \n10. \nappendixes.  Specific  resettlement  procedure  guidelines  have  been  established  to  guide  the \npreparation  of  appropriate  resettlement  plans  that  will  be  adequate  for  the  magnitude  of  land \nacquisition for the subsequent subprojects. \n \n11. \nThe  resettlement  procedure  guidelines  require  that  (i)  LGED  carry  out  an  initial  social \nassessment  survey  once  the  scope  of  each  subproject  is  identified,  based  on  preliminary \ntechnical  designs;  (ii)  if  impacts  are  found  to  be  \u201csignificant,\u201d  LGED  will  prepare  a  full \nresettlement plan for each subproject; and (iii) if subproject impacts are less than significant, a \nshort resettlement plan will be sufficient for subproject preparation. The short resettlement plan \nmust, however, comply with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement and other social safeguard \nguidelines. \n \nD. \n \n12. \nThe  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural  Development  and  Cooperatives,  through \nLGED, has overall coordination, planning, implementation, and financing responsibilities. LGED \nfully  recognizes  the  importance  and  complexity  of  the  resettlement  programs  in  the  Project. \nTherefore,  an  experienced  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  or  resettlement  specialist  with \nclearly defined tasks will be engaged to implement the plans. A senior LGED staff (preferably a \nsocial  scientist),  with  the  rank  of  executive  engineer,  will  be  appointed  as  chief  resettlement \nofficer  to  supervise  the  implementation  work  with  the  help  of  existing  LGED  community \norganizers at the subdistrict level. \n \nIf  required,  the  appointed  NGO/consultant  will  open  field  offices  in  16  districts  and  will \n13. \ninvolve  affected  persons,  including  women,  in  implementation.  The  NGO/consultant  will  also \nliaise  with  LGED  and  the  contractor  to  assist  the  project-affected persons, especially women \nand  other  vulnerable  persons  to  obtain  employment  during  the  construction  period.  In  the \ncontractor  contracts,  LGED  will  include  a  provision  for  preferential  employment  of  qualified \nproject-affected persons, including affected women, in road slope turfing. \n \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities and Resettlement Cost \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n49 \n\nLGED  will  ensure  that  the  resettlement  plans  adhere  to  the  resettlement  policy \n14. \nframework  and  resettlement  procedure  guidelines  so  that  appropriate  entitlements  and \nmitigation measures are established. LGED will further ensure that the resettlement budgets are \ndelivered on time to the deputy commissioner\u2019s office and the implementing NGO/consultant, for \ntimely implementation of the resettlement plan. \n \n15. \nThe cost of land acquisition and resettlement for the Project is estimated at $1.4 million, \nincluding physical contingencies. The Government will provide the funds for land acquisition and \nresettlement. The funds will be released through the deputy commissioners' offices for acquired \nproperties,  whereas  all  other  additional  benefits  will  be  paid  directly  by  the  Executing  Agency \nthrough the implementing NGO/consultant. \n \nE. \n\nDisclosure, Consultation, and Grievances \n\n16. \nEach resettlement plan will be prepared and implemented in close consultation with the \nstakeholders  and  will  involve  focus  group  discussions  and  meetings,  particularly  with  the \nproject-affected people. The resettlement policy framework will be made available in the Bangla \nlanguage during focus group meetings at the village level. Copies of draft resettlement plans will \nbe  distributed  among  community  groups  to  obtain  local  inputs  before  finalizing  the  detailed \ndesign, after the socioeconomic survey so as to avoid fraudulent claims. \n \n17. \nComplaints  and  grievance  procedures  will  be  outlined  in  each  resettlement  plan  and \ngrievance redress committees will be established for each subproject, with representatives from \nLGED,  affected  persons,  women  and  vulnerable  groups,  local  government,  and  NGOs.  The \nchief resettlement officer, or authorized  person nominated by the chief resettlement officer, will \nchair  the  grievance  redress  committee.  Other  than  disputes  relating  to  ownership  rights,  the \ncommittee  will  review  grievances  involving  all  resettlement  benefits,  relocation,  and  relevant \nassistance.  Grievances  will  be  redressed  within  2-4  weeks  from  the  date  of  lodging  the \ncomplaint. \n \nF. \n \nLGED  will  establish  a  monitoring  system  involving  LGED  and  implementing  staff,  and \n18. \nprepare  progress  reports  on  all  aspects  of  land  acquisition,  compensation,  and  resettlement \nactivities. LGED will report to ADB on land acquisition and resettlement in the quarterly progress \nreport. \n \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable A10: Measures Proposed in the Resettlement Framework to Comply with ADB Policy \n\n \n\nLand Acquisition and \nResettlement Issue \n\nCovered by Government Policy \n\nMeasures Proposed in the Resettlement Framework to Comply \nwith ADB Policy \n\n5\n0\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n0\n \n\ni\n\nA.

The purpose was \nto understand their needs and identify possible activities to incorporate gender and development \nin the project design. \n \nFrom the consultations at the field level and the lessons from previous rural development \n2. \nprojects  of  the  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  and  other  agencies,  a \nproject  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  was  prepared.  The  GAP  covers  capacity  building  for  staff  of \nthe project and government local bodies on gender and development; developing the capacity \nof  women  as  change  agents  and  beneficiaries;  gender-focused  infrastructure  and  other \nservices;  and  increasing  women\u2019s  participation  in  development  institutions,  infrastructure \nconstruction  and  maintenance,  governance,  and  benefit  monitoring.  The  GAP  contained  in  a \nsupplementary appendix provides the details of the plan. The main elements of the GAP are (i) \nincreasing  understanding\u2013on  the  part  of  stakeholders,  including  the  project  staff,  the  union \ncouncil  officials,  and  the  citizens\u2013of  the  role  of  women  in  rural  development  and  local \ngovernance;  (ii)  increasing  participation  of  women  in  decision  making,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring of community-based activities through union development coordination committees, \ncitizens'  forums,  and  subdistrict  development  coordination  committees;  (iii)  preparing  women \nward members of union councils for their roles and responsibilities as public representatives; (iv) \nincreasing  participation  of  women  in  implementing  infrastructure  investments  and  maintaining \nand  managing  completed  works;  (v)  increasing  access  to  infrastructure  services and markets \noffered  by  the  Project;  (vi)  reducing  the  wage  differentials  between  women  and  men  in \nconstruction activities; (vii) mobilizing women groups assisted by nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs)  to  promote  their  participation  in    local  governance;  (viii) developing skills of women in \nmanaging  business,  managing  and  maintaining  infrastructure,  and  undertaking  income-\ngenerating activities; and (ix) linking women shop owners with microfinance sources. \n \n3. \nThirty-two  pilot  union  councils  will  undertake  specific  activities  to  promote  the \nparticipation  of  stakeholders  in  managing  the  union  council,  preparing  the  budget,  and \ncoordinating  development  programs.  The  capacity  of  women  citizens  and  women  ward \nmembers will be built through their participation in training and regular meetings. \n \n4. \nThe  project  consultants  will  assist  the  union  councils  to  set  targets  and  implement \nactivities. The consultants will support the development of training materials and field manuals \nfor the staff and for partner NGOs. The Project will arrange orientation and training for staff at \nvarious  levels  and  NGO  partners  for  orientation  on  the  GAP.  Specific  training  manuals  will  be \ndeveloped  for  the  union  council  officials  and  the  women  ward  members  on  their  roles  and \nresponsibilities  in  union  council  management  and  in  promoting  women\u2019s  participation.  Special \nmanuals and guidelines will be developed for the pilot project areas. \n \n5. \nTo support  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  GAP  in  mainstreaming  gender  in  the \nProject, a gender and development specialist will be hired, in addition to the training coordinator \nand community development specialist at the project level who will also support implementation \nof the GAP. The terms of reference of the staff and consultants will include their responsibilities \nin implementing and monitoring the GAP at their respective levels. At the subdistrict level, LGED \ncommunity  organizers  will  be  trained  and  be  responsible  for  implementing  and  monitoring \nactivities related to gender mainstreaming. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n53 \n\nThe  implementation  of  the  GAP  will  be  ensured  and  monitored.  The  project  monitoring \n6. \nsystem will be developed with gender-sensitive tools, formats, and reporting system for various \nlevels.  Project  staff  will  receive  training  to  monitor  gender-disaggregated  data,  and  gender-\nspecific information will be included in the project reporting system. The monitoring system will \ninclude the union councils and women in monitoring and assessing benefits and impacts. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\nThe  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  of  the  Project,  which  seeks  to  upgrade  the \n1. \nlocal road transport network and physical infrastructure in 16 specified districts in the southwest \nof  Bangladesh,  aims  to  determine  the  degree  of  the  likely  impacts  and  identify  possible \nmitigation measures for the proposed Project. The primary output is a statement on whether the \nProject is fundamentally sound in environmental terms. The IEE will indicate if a further detailed \nfull  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  is  required,  or  if  the  IEE  itself  with  specified \nmitigation  and  enhancement  measures  suffices  to  address  the  management  of  the predicted \nenvironmental  impacts.  The  EIA  includes  both  the  natural  and  human/social  environments.  Of \nspecific  concern  is  the  human  use  of  resources  and  how  this  changes  as  a  result  of  the \nproposed  project  interventions.  The  key  environmental  concerns  were  identified  using  a \nchecklist  screening  procedure  and  analyzed  for  each  of  the  four  elements  of  the  proposed \nProject.  Appropriate  mitigation  and  enhancement  measures  have  been  suggested  for  the \nidentified impacts. \n \nB. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nThe Project does not follow the conventional feasibility study and detailed design phases \n2. \ncompleted prior to project implementation. The summary IEE (SIEE) thus forms an overall initial \nscoping  of  the  broad  framework  of  the  Project  and  allows  key  environmental  issues  to  be \nidentified  so  that  detailed  subproject  formulation  can  take  them  into  account.  The  project  area \nincludes  the  Sundarbans  mangrove  forest  area.  While  the  project  area  is  large,  the  proposed \ninterventions  are  spread  widely  across  it.  As  a  result,  the  likelihood  of  significant  localized \ncumulative  impacts  is  reduced.  There  are  unlikely  to  be  significant  impacts  that  will  affect \nlocations outside the project area. Three core subprojects were identified as case examples with \nSIEE conclusions. \n \nC. \n \nThe environmental baseline situation in the project area is extremely well documented in \n3. \nthe  regional  environmental  profiles  produced  for  the  whole  country  by  the  Water Resources \nPlanning Organization as part of the National Water Management Plan. A semidetailed baseline \ndescription,  written  in  the  context  of  the  Project  and  following  the  sequence  prescribed  in  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  environmental  assessment  guidelines,  was  given  in  the  IEE. \nThe  work  concludes  that  the  following  environmental  issues\u2013listed  in  order  of  importance\u2013are \nthe most important in the project area: \n \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n(i) \n\nChanges in the water resources regime . The recent reductions in dry season \nsurface  water  flows  in  the  area  have  consequences  for  surface  water  quality. \nLack of dilution appears to result in the saline water interface moving northward. \nReduction  in  flows  and  increased  sedimentation  are  reducing  natural  fish \nresources  and  boat  navigation,  including  the  accessibility  of  Mongla  port. \nLocalized  flooding  occurs  in  the  monsoon  season,  particularly  in  the  Khulna-\nJessore area where congested drainage is a problem. Bank erosion in north and \neast Bhola is severe and causes serious household destitution. \n\n(ii) \n\nManagement  of  environmentally  sensitive  areas. The Sundarbans area is of \ninternational importance and requires careful sustainable management. The four \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n55 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nother major sensitive areas are the perennial wetlands of Chanda, Dakatia, and \nMarjiat, which present complex management issues. The fourth is the designated \nwildlife sanctuary of Kukuri Mukri. \n\nRelatively  poor  communication  and  access. The area has poor road links to \nthe rest of the country. Within the area, the road network is less developed than \nthat in most other parts of the country. As a result, waterborne navigation is still \nimportant, especially in the southeast of the project area; however, reduced dry \nseason flows and increased sedimentation are serious problems. \n\nPotable water supply and sanitation problems . Potable water supplies in the \ncoastal areas are expensive to exploit because the salinity of the shallow aquifer \nrequires deep tubewells. The incidence of natural arsenic in the shallow aquifer is \na  serious  problem  for  the  central  part  of  the  project  area.  Lack  of  adequate \nsanitation facilities causes serious fecal pollution in surface water. \n\nLand  use  conflicts.  Land  use  conflicts  are  serious  between  shrimp \naquaculturists  and  agriculturists.  Brackish  water  shrimp  aquaculture is causing \nserious  environmental  damage  and  needs  to  be  managed  in  a  sustainable \nmanner. \n\nCyclone  risk.  The  cyclone  risk  is  very  high  in  the  coastal  areas.  The  social \nimplications are very serious in the southeastern part of the study area where the \nSundarbans  do  not  provide  natural  protection  from  cyclone-induced  storm \nsurges. \n\nD. \n\nForecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nidentified  significant \n\nUse  of  a  master  screening  checklist  drawn  up  for  rural  infrastructure  development in \n4. \nBangladesh \nimpacts  (both  positive  and  negative)  and  eliminated \ninsignificant  ones.  An  impact  matrix  was  constructed  using  the  checklist  and  is  included  in  a \nsupplementary  appendix.  The  potential  impacts  were  rated  separately  for  each  of  the  four \nelements  of  the  Project.  A  checklist  identifying  significant  potential  project  impacts  was \nproduced.  The  impacts  are  outlined  below,  with  the  appropriate  mitigation  and  enhancement \nmeasures. \n \n\n1. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n \n5. \nThe main social negative impacts of the Project are likely to be the result of permanent \nland acquisition. While the requirement for acquisition is likely to be minor, the localized impacts \nat household level can be significant. A resettlement framework has been prepared. The Project \narea has 42 listed nationally important monuments and damage to them should be avoided in \npreparing the subprojects. \n \nDue  to  improved  access  it  is  likely  that  there  will  be  significant  positive social impacts \n6. \nacross many sectors, including agriculture, industry, marketing, education, and health. It will be \npossible  to  maximize  the  direct  social  benefits  by  targeting  construction  work  opportunities  to \nlocal  people,  particularly  women.  In  addition,  there  are  significant  enhancement  possibilities  if \nthe  provision  of  deep  tubewells  in  growth  centers,  boat  landings,  and  union  council  centers  is \ntargeted  in  the  worst  arsenic-affected  areas.  When  formulating  subprojects,  the  existing  and \nplanned  education  and  health  facilities  should  be  considered  so  that  the  potential  benefits  of \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nimproved  access  to  these  facilities  can  be  maximized.  The  multipurpose  use  of  facilities  as \ncyclone shelters in the southeast part of the project area will also enhance the positive impacts. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n7. \nThe main environmental impacts are those associated with possible changes in surface \nwater flooding patterns. These include indirect impacts on the fish resource system and aquatic \nhabitats. The main mitigation measure for these impacts is to provide adequate cross-drainage \nfacilities  to  ensure  that  there  are  no  changes  in  flooding  patterns.  The  main  environmentally \nsensitive  area  is  the  Sundarbans.  No  interventions  should  be  considered  in  the  designated \nSundarban  area,  nor  in  the  four  other  designated  ecologically  sensitive  sites  outside  it.  Six \nspecies  on  the  internationally  threatened  red  list  are  found  in  the  project  area.  While  there  is \nlikely  to  be  some  need  to  cut  roadside  trees to widen the roads, cutting can be minimized by \nsensitive  planning.  The  roadside  tree  planting  program  will  more  than  compensate  for  those \nlost. There is a serious erosion risk in the north and east of Bhola island and construction of any \nnew infrastructure should be avoided in those areas. \n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Criteria for Selection and Appraisal of Subprojects \n\n8. \nBased on the SIEEs for the three core subprojects, the following environmental criteria \nshould  guide  the  selection  and  prioritization  of  subprojects:  (i)  no  subproject  should  be \nimplemented  in  the  Sundarbans  or  other  designated  protected  areas;  (ii)  the  extent  of  a \nperennial  water  body  is  not  to  be  reduced  to  below  that  of  February  1995  as  a  result  of  the \nProject;  (iii)  no  registered  historic  building  or  cultural  site  should  be  affected;  and  (iv)  land \nacquisition should be minimal. \n \nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\nNational  procedures  for  environmental  assessment  in  Bangladesh  are  outlined  in  the \n9. \nEnvironmental  Conservation  Act  of  1995  and  the  Environmental  Conservation  Rules  of  1997. \nThe Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) has a set of environmental guidelines \nproduced in 1994; however, these need updating to incorporate the procedures that have to be \nfollowed  under  the  national  legal  requirements.  Under  the  classification  system  of  the \nenvironmental rules, the Project is likely to be in the orange B group. This is the second most \nsevere category,  which  includes  roads  below  the  level  of  national  or  regional  highways  and \nbridges that are less than 100 meters long. However, the final categorization of the project by \nthe  Department  of  Environment  (DOE)  is  likely  to  depend  on  the  degree  of  the  resettlement \nrequirement. For an orange B classified project, an IEE with appropriate no-objection certificates \nneeds to be produced. \n \nAssuming that the Project is categorized as orange B, then the key stages to be followed \n10. \nand  the  decisions  that  need  to  be  made  for  the  national  environmental  assessment  process \nbefore subproject construction contracts are awarded are as follows: (i) ADB to approve the IEE \nand  SIEE;  (ii)  agreement  given  to  fund  the  subproject;  (iii)  discussion  with  DOE  as  to  its \nenvironmental  classification;  (iv)  if  DOE  declares  the  project  to  be  in  the  orange  B  category, \nthen  preparation  of  an  IEE  for  submission  to  DOE,  with  a  proposed  general  methodology  for \nenvironmental  assessment  of  each  subproject  at  implementation  stage;  (v)  if  there  is  land \nacquisition,  then  prepare  an  outline  resettlement  action  plan  for  submission  to  DOE  with  the \nIEE; (vi) obtain no-objection certificates from the local administration for submission to DOE with \nthe IEE; (vii) liaise with the Forest Department and the Inland Water Transport Authority to see if \nthey  require  special  approvals;  (viii)  submit  the  IEE,  the  no-objection  certificate,  and \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n57 \n\nresettlement  action  plan  to  DOE  at  least  90  working  days  before  any  construction  contract  is \nawarded; and (ix) obtain site clearance and an environmental clearance certificate from DOE. \n \n11. \nEnvironmental  management  capability  for  subproject  formulation  and  design  will  be \nneeded.  The  environmental  assessment  methodology  devised  during  the  preparation  of  the \nDOE  IEE  document  will  need  to  be  followed.  Appropriate  environmental  management  clauses \nalso need to be included in the construction contracts, with monitoring during construction. It will \nbe  necessary  to  monitor  the  Project  after  completion  to  see  if  the  predicted  impacts  (both \npositive and negative) actually occurred. \n \nF. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nThe most significant potential impacts of the Project are those related to permanent land \n12. \nacquisition. These impacts are likely to be the most problematic, but because nearly all of the \nroad alignments are existing, the permanent land acquisition required is only for widening and \nwill  not  be  large  in  area.  It  is  predicted  that  all  impacts  can be mitigated, provided permanent \nland acquisition is minimized. Environmentally sensitive design during subproject formulation is \ncritical to minimize any negative impacts. \n \n13. \nThe overall detailed intervention program cannot be fixed at this stage, as it depends on \nsubproject  formulation,  which  is  based  on  assessment  of  local  needs.  The  subproject \nformulation  process  will  be  carried  out  during  the  implementation  stage  of  the  Project.  Three \nsubprojects  have  been  assessed  as   case  examples  and  the  main  conclusion  is  that  the \nenvironmental  issues  are  highly  site  specific  and  greatly  differ.  The  main  requirement  is  to \nestablish  an  environmental  management  system  following  general  principles  and  that  can  be \nused  during  subproject  finalization  and  implementation.  The  methodology  that  has  been  used \nfor  the  three  sample  subprojects  will  be  refined  during  the  next  phase  of  the  Project  when  a \nformal IEE is carried out for submission to DOE. \n \n14. \nIt  will  be  necessary  to  strengthen  LGED\u2019s  capability  to  implement  the  environmental \nmanagement  measures  for  the  Project.  This  is  particularly  so  because  of  the  nature  of  the \nproject implementation program. LGED should appoint a full-time project environmental officer \nto check the work of the consultants and ensure compliance with the environmental assessment \nmethodology that will be developed for the formulation and design of the subprojects. It is urgent \nthat the 1994 LGED environmental guidelines be updated to conform to the legal requirements \nfor environmental assessment. \n \n15. \nThe  Project  is  judged  to  be  in  ADB\u2019s  environmental  impact  category  B.  However,  the \ndegree  of  permanent  land  acquisition  required  can  be  accurately  assessed  only  during \nsubproject finalization at the implementation stage. The participatory planning process as part of \nsubproject detailed design ensures that land acquisition requirements will be minimized. \n \n16. \nOnce ADB approves the IEE and outline resettlement plan, then the national procedures \nfor environmental assessment will need to be followed. The nature of the national environmental \nassessment requirements will depend on DOE's classification of the Project (likely to be orange \nB),  which  will,  in  turn,  probably  depend  on  the  amount  of  land  acquisition  required.  The \nmethodology  for  environmental  assessment  of  the  subprojects  during  implementation  also \nneeds  to  be  refined  in  consultation  with  DOE.  The  environmental  assessment  work  should be \nan  intrinsic  part  of  subproject  planning  and  final  design.  LGED  will  require  a  full-time \nenvironmental specialist specifically designated for the Project over its duration. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nG. \n\nConclusions \n\n17. \nThe  conceptual  framework  of  the  Project  allows  the  establishment  of  a  planning  and \nimplementation  process  that  can  ensure  interventions  are  environmentally  sound  and \nsustainable.  The  process  can  be  set  up  so  that  negative  impacts,  particularly  land  acquisition \nrequirements,  can  be  minimized  and  positive  impacts  enhanced.  Avoiding  or  adequately \nmitigating  all  predicted  negative  impacts  will  require  detailed  plans  to  be  drawn  up  to  address \nadequately the land acquisition, resettlement, and compensation issues for all subprojects. Land \nacquisition will need to be carried out in a fair, equitable, and timely manner for all subprojects. \n \n18. \nThe IEE has determined that the Project is in ADB's category B. If an acceptable outline \nresettlement  strategy  is  produced,  there  is  no  need  to  carry  out  a  detailed  EIA.  However, \nbecause  of  the  nature  of  the  implementation  of  the  Project,  it  will  be  necessary  to  use  an \nenvironmental assessment methodology for subproject formulation and management. The three \ncase  study  subprojects  have  demonstrated  that  the  broad  methodology  used  for  the  overall \nassessment will work at the subproject level, even though the environmental conditions, issues, \nand mix of interventions are very different for each subproject. \n \n19. \nUnder Bangladesh environmental assessment procedures, it is likely that all the project \ninterventions will be classified in the orange B group, as they are for upgrading of existing local \nroads  and  no  bridges  are  likely  to  be  longer  than  100 meters. However, as the resettlement \nrequirements  for  each  subproject  cannot  be  finally  quantified  until  the  implementation  stage,  it \nwill probably be necessary to prepare a resettlement action plan to submit with an IEE and no-\nobjection certificates to DOE to obtain the necessary clearances. \n \n20. \nThe  required  LGED  capability  to  handle  adequately  the  environmental  assessment \nneeds of the Project has been reviewed and discussed with the environmental section of LGED. \nSince  there  are  likely  to  be  approximately  100  subprojects  phased  over  6  years,  a  full-time \nLGED environmental specialist will be needed to monitor the Project. \n \n\n1. \n\nSummary of Conclusions of Jhaudia-Halsha Road Subproject IEE \n\nThe SIEE revealed that the subproject has no major significant negative environmental \n21. \nimpacts.  Potential  social  and  economic  benefits  including  poverty  reduction,  employment \ncreation,  and  income  generation  are  anticipated.  Some  potential  negative  environmental \nimpacts will likely arise from dust generation; soil, air, and noise pollution; disruption of fish and \nwildlife  habitats;  and  tree  removal.  In  addition,  some  socioeconomic  impacts  (acquisition  of \nabout 0.2 hectares and relocation of about 4 houses, 30 commercial structures, and 1 rice mill) \nare  also  likely  to  occur.  These  impacts  can  be  offset  or  reduced  by  implementing  mitigation \nmeasures  appropriate  to  the  conditions.  The  subproject  will  not  require  a  follow-up EIA other \nthan the resettlement plan. \n \n\n2. \n\nSummary of Conclusions of Paikgacha-Mazidpur Road Subproject IEE \n\nThe SIEE revealed that the subproject has no major significant negative environmental \n22. \nimpacts.  Potential  social  and  economic  benefits  including  poverty  reduction,  employment \ncreation,  and  income  generation  are  anticipated.  Some  potential  negative  environmental \nimpacts will likely arise from dust generation; soil, air, and noise pollution; disruption of shrimp \nhabitats;  and  tree  removal.  In  addition,  some  socioeconomic impacts (acquisition of about 0.1 \nhectares  and  relocation  of  about  2  houses  and  30  commercial  structures)  are  also  likely  to \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n59 \n\noccur.  These  impacts  can  be  offset  or  reduced  by  implementing  mitigation  appropriate  to  the \nconditions. The subproject will not require a follow-up EIA other than the resettlement plan. \n \n\n3. \n\nSummary of Conclusions of Jhalokati-Balokdia Road Subproject IEE \n\n23. \nThe  SIEE  revealed  that  the  subproject  will  have  no  major  significant  negative \nenvironmental  impacts.  Potential  social  and  economic  benefits  including  poverty  reduction, \nemployment  creation,  and  income  generation  are  anticipated.  Some  potential  negative \nenvironmental  impacts  will  likely  arise  from  dust  generation;  soil,  air,  and  noise  pollution; \ndisruption  of  fish  and  wildlife  habitats;  and  tree  removal.  In  addition,  socioeconomic  impacts \n(acquisition of about 1.5 hectares, partial or full relocation of about 59 commercial structures, 1 \nmosque, and 1 religious school) will also likely occur.
