THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nMongolia for the Sustaining Access to and Quality of Education During Economic Difficulties \nProject.  \n \n2.  Mongolia is facing severe economic difficulties. Significant cuts in the education budget \nfor 2017 and beyond greatly constrain the government\u2019s capacity to mitigate further deterioration \nof education services. This will result in lost opportunities for pre-primary, primary, and secondary \neducation, especially for children who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Support from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) is urgently needed to minimize the negative effects during this \ndifficult economic period by (i) narrowing the gap in the enrollment capacity of schools and \nkindergartens  in  Ulaanbaatar  and  some  aimag1 centers,  (ii)  supporting  the  completion  of \nunfinished curriculum reform and associated assessment system reforms, (iii)  ensuring the \nprovision  of  teaching  and  learning  materials  (TLM)  that  accompany  the  new  curriculum, \n(iv) upgrading the skills and knowledge of teachers and managers for the new curriculum and \nassessments, and (v) strengthening systems for planning and managing education services. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The growth of Mongolia\u2019s economy has rapidly decelerated  since 2011 because of \ndeclining foreign direct investment and falling commodity prices. This slowed growth has caused \nserious  economic  difficulties,  including  large  revenue  shortfalls  and  cuts  in  government \ninvestment, which are expected to continue beyond 2017 and require the government to reduce \npublic spending further. The government has cut education spending to a minimum, only enough \nto keep schools and kindergartens operating. Access to and the quality of pre-primary, primary, \nand  secondary  education  are  likely  to  deteriorate  with  the  growth  of  the  population  of \nkindergartner and school-age children and unfinished curriculum and assessment system reforms, \nunless some mitigating measures are implemented. \n \n4.  Seats in schools and kindergartens have increasingly become unavailable due to the \ngrowth in the population of kindergartner and school-age children which has been outpacing the \nconstruction and expansion of schools and kindergartens. While enrollments in pre-primary \neducation doubled (105.9%) from SY2009 to SY2015, the number of kindergartens increased by \nonly 58.2%.2 Similarly, enrollments in primary and secondary education rose by 7.8% during \nSY2012\u2013SY2015,  but  only  13  schools  were  built  during  the  period,  an  increase  of  1.7%. \nConsequently, the enrollment capacity of schools and kindergartens has been overstretched, with \nthe class size enlarged and 33 schools operating in three shifts in SY2016 (of which 30 are in \nUlaanbaatar).3 The gap in enrollment capacity has been widening particularly in Ulaanbaatar \nbecause of disproportionate population growth caused by internal migration. The average class \nsize at Ulaanbaatar schools is 37 at the primary level, the largest in the country, as enrollments \nexpanded  by  18.1%  during  SY2012\u2013SY2015.  With  an  increase  of  41.5%  in  pre-primary \nenrollments, the class size at free public kindergartens in Ulaanbaatar is even larger, at 40\u201350 \n                                                \n1  An aimag is an administrative subdivision in Mongolia. \n2  Students enrolled in pre-primary education totaled 109,479 in SY2009 and jumped to 225,388 in SY2015. There \nwere 814 kindergartens in SY2009, of which 102 were private. The number rose to 1,288 in SY2015, of which \n462 were private. \n3  Although the class size became larger, the student\u2013teacher ratio remained constant at 18:3\u201318:8 during SY2012\u2013\nSY2015. \n ", "2 \nstudents, and students are selected for admission by lottery. Although net enrollment rates at pre-\nprimary, primary, and junior secondary levels have been improving steadily, these may be \nreversed  unless  schools  and  kindergartens  are  built  or  expanded.  The  population  of \nkindergartners is projected to grow further until 2019, while the population of primary and \nsecondary school-age children is expected to rise until 2025. \n \n5.  The curriculum reform, which started in SY2013 with the pilot test of a new curriculum for \nprimary education, remains incomplete without the pilot test and implementation of  a new \ncurriculum for senior secondary education.4 Moreover, the current curriculum still lacks learning \noutcome standards for students at every grade level, which leaves students and teachers \nunguided and confused. The current student learning assessment system is not reliable and fails \nto provide feedback on student learning or education policy. Furthermore, the standards for school \nperformance  evaluation  have  become  too  outdated  to  encourage  school-based  continuing \nprofessional development (CPD) of teachers and school leaders, and effective management of \nschool resources to support the implementation of the current curriculum. Likewise, the current \nstandards for teacher evaluation are too general to help teachers develop knowledge and skills. \n \n6.  The new curriculum was introduced with little accompanying TLM\u2014including textbooks, \nteachers\u2019 guides, student workbooks, tools, and equipment\u2014provided to implement it, which \nnegatively affected the quality of student learning. There are huge disparities in the distribution of \nTLM among schools and kindergartens. Schools and kindergartens in rural areas are more \ndisadvantaged than those in urban areas, as the transportation cost is higher. Since a standard \nset of TLM accompanying the curriculum for each grade does not exist, TLM have been provided \non an ad hoc basis, further intensifying disparities. \n \n7.  Existing in-service professional development programs do not assist teachers in adopting \na child-centered methodology and the formative and summative assessment and evaluation \nmethods required by the new curriculum. The budget allocated for teacher training is generally \ntoo limited to cover even the mandatory training for teachers in the first, fifth, and 10th year of \nservice, causing the quality of education to suffer. In addition, little CPD opportunities are provided \nfor school and kindergarten managers who are expected to provide instructional leadership for \nthe implementation of the curriculum. \n \n8.  The low population density and harsh winters in Mongolia have caused inefficiency in \neducation expenditures. The cost of providing education services is high because (i) education \nservices need to be provided in sparsely populated rural areas; (ii) school dormitory services are \nneeded for one-quarter of the population engaged in seminomadic herding; (iii) constant heating \nis required in schools, dormitories, and kindergartens during extremely cold winter months; and \n(iv) many nonteaching staff are employed to operate and maintain schools, dormitories, and \nkindergartens. The government lacks effective information gathering, planning, and management \nsystems for schools, dormitories, and kindergartens; and resource-sharing mechanisms between \nschools and kindergartens. \n \n9.  Strategic fit. The project will support key priorities set out in the Mongolia Sustainable \nDevelopment Vision 2030 and Action Program for 2016\u20132020 for the education sector, including \n                                                \n4 The curriculum reform was undertaken in phases. In SY2014, the new curriculum for primary education was \nimplemented nationwide, while a new curriculum for junior secondary education and pre-primary education was pilot \ntested. In SY2015, the new curriculum for junior secondary and pre-primary education was implemented nationwide. \nHowever, the development and pilot test of a new curriculum for senior secondary education were delayed and has \nnot been completed, as of August 2017.  \n \n ", "3 \n(i) providing equal, inclusive, and practical educational services; (ii) allowing every child in urban \nareas to enroll in a kindergarten; (iii) alleviating over-enrollment and eliminating three shifts in \nschools; (iv) introducing a system of evaluation of education quality and results at all levels of \neducation; and (v) building an education system based on standards.5 It is in line with ADB\u2019s \neducation sector operations plan, which emphasizes the importance of improving student learning \noutcomes.6 The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u2013\n2020 which promotes economic and social stability in a period of economic difficulties.7 \n \n10.  Lessons. A review of the curriculum implementation conducted under ADB\u2019s technical \nassistance showed that most teachers accept the curriculum but struggle with implementation \nbecause  of  lack  of  (i)  learning  outcome  statements  in  the  curriculum;  (ii)  understanding, \nknowledge,  and  skills  regarding  child-centered  methodology  and  formative  and  summative \nstudent assessment and evaluation methods; and (iii) quality TLM.8 These findings have been \nincorporated  into  the  project  design.  The  project  also  draws  on  lessons  learned  from  the \nexperience of ADB and other development partners in supporting school and kindergarten \nconstruction and expansion, particularly the importance of (i) reliable enrollment and population \ngrowth projections in planning capital investments, and (ii) daily construction supervision to \nensure the quality of school and kindergarten buildings. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The project is aligned with the following impact: more accessible, more equitable, and \nbetter quality education system developed (footnote 5). The project will have the following \noutcome: access to and quality of pre-primary, primary, and secondary education sustained \nduring economic difficulties.9 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  The project will have five outputs. \n \n13.  Output 1: Gap in enrollment capacity of schools and kindergartens narrowed. The \nproject will support the construction and expansion of schools and kindergartens in Ulaanbaatar \nand aimag centers (Altai, Darkhan, Sainshand, and Sumber) to make more seats available and \nreduce three-shift schools and class size. Inclusive (age, gender, and special needs), energy-\nefficient (improved insulation and heating systems), and disaster-resilient features10 will be built \ninto new and expanded schools and kindergartens using innovative designs introduced by the \ngovernment and other development partners. \n \n14.  Output  2:  Unfinished  curriculum  reform  and  associated  assessment  system \nreforms completed. The project will support the completion of unfinished curriculum reform and \nassociated assessment system  reforms by updating curriculum standards; student learning \nassessment criteria, methods and system for primary, junior, and senior secondary education; \n                                                \n5  State Great Khural. 2016.

The curriculum for all grades and subjects will \nincorporate clearly defined learning outcome standards, while the Mongolian language and \nliterature curriculum for grades 1\u201312 will be reviewed comprehensively to improve the writing, \nreading, and communication skills of students. Based on the updated outcome standards, student \nlearning assessment criteria and methods will also be reviewed, and the system for student \nlearning assessment in primary, junior, and senior secondary education will be upgraded by \nstrengthening the capacity of the Education Evaluation Center. Moreover, school evaluation \nstandards will be updated to strengthen school-based management and assist with schools\u2019 self-\nevaluation, performance improvements, and reporting. The existing teacher evaluation standards \nwill be revised to include differentiated competency levels and encourage self-appraisal and CPD. \nFurther, the curriculum for pre-service teacher education programs will be reviewed in line with \nthe updated school curriculum standards, student learning assessment criteria and methods, and \ncompetency-based standards for teachers. \n \n15.  Output 3: Teaching and learning materials that accompany the new curriculum \nprovided. The project will update TLM standards, including those for developing, evaluating, and \nselecting TLM, to improve the quality of and enhance systems for distributing TLM. A profile of \nTLM  accompanying  the  curriculum  for  each  grade,  including  pre-primary  education  and \nequivalency program, and their layout and physical standards will be developed. The project will \nalso support the provision of quality TLM for poorly resourced kindergartens.  \n \n16.  Output 4: Teachers\u2019 and managers\u2019 knowledge and skills upgraded for the new \ncurriculum and assessments. The project will upgrade the knowledge and skills of teachers \nand managers (principals and head teachers) of schools and kindergartens to implement the \nupdated curriculum standards, assessment, and evaluation. Given budget constraints, the project \nwill strengthen the capacity of the Institute of Teachers Professional Development (ITPD) to \ndevelop and deliver CPD programs for pre-primary, primary, and secondary teachers through \nexisting online platforms and workshops.11 Model science, math, and information technology (IT) \nlaboratories will be established at the ITPD to train secondary teachers in using laboratory \nequipment and in facilitating student experiments emphasized in the curriculum. Moreover, CPD \nprograms  for  school  and  kindergarten  managers,  and  Ulaanbaatar  and  aimag  education \ndepartment staff, will be developed and delivered to improve leadership during the implementation \nof the updated curriculum standards, assessment, and evaluation. \n \n17.  Output 5: Systems for planning and managing education services strengthened. \nThe  project  will  strengthen  systems  for  planning  and  managing  pre-primary,  primary,  and \nsecondary education services in the medium term. A geographic information system (GIS)-based \nreal-time information system integrated into existing systems will be developed to collect and \nanalyze information on school and kindergarten construction, expansion, and rehabilitation needs, \ntaking into account population and enrollment growth projections, and trends in internal migration. \nThe introduction of cluster systems for schools with senior secondary grades and kindergartens \nwill be explored and pilot tested to facilitate resource sharing between schools and kindergartens. \nThe policy and system for school and kindergarten catchment areas will be reviewed and \nmeasures  to  strengthen  their  enforcement  will  be  identified  to  improve  the  planning  and \nmanagement of school and kindergarten enrollments, as well as construction, expansion, and \nrehabilitation. \n \n                                                \n11 In 2017, about 30% of primary and secondary teachers participate in CPD programs through online platforms \n(Appendix 1, baseline for indicator 4d). \n ", "5 \nD.

Teaching and school staff will be provided with appropriate training. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  Economic analysis. The project economic rationale was assessed as sound, because \nthe  project  will  support  the  construction  and  expansion  of  schools  and  kindergartens  in \nUlaanbaatar where the demand for additional seats is particularly high. A cost-effectiveness \nanalysis was conducted to compare the project case with two alternatives in terms of (i) the target \narea for school and kindergarten construction and expansion; (ii) the presence or absence of \ninterventions related to curriculum and student learning assessment system reforms, and CPD; \nand (iii) anticipated impacts on access to quality education, student learning outcomes, and \ncurriculum and education policy. The project case was assessed as the most cost-effective option \nas it would enable the largest number of students to enroll in the supported facilities, and \ncontribute to improvements in student learning and education policy. The project is considered as \neconomically viable and sustainable. \n \n24.  Financial sustainability. The financial sustainability of the project was assessed at the \nfiscal and project levels, since there are no revenue-generating components. An analysis of recent \nexpenditures, incremental recurrent costs, and projected budgets was undertaken to evaluate the \nfiscal impact of the project on the budget of the government and MECSS. Given economic \ndifficulties, counterpart funding will be limited to $0.69 million or 1.4% of the total project cost in \nthe form of tax exemptions. Hence, negative impacts on the budget are considered minimal. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  The financial management risk is substantial mainly because of the lack of staff with \nexperience in managing donor-funded projects, and weaknesses in internal controls and asset \nmanagement  procedures  at  MECSS.  Key  mitigation  measures  for  these  risks  include  the \n(i) establishment of a PIU staffed by an experienced financial management professional to \nmanage the project funds, (ii) installation of accounting software at the PIU to generate financial \nreports and track the project assets, and (iii) training of MECSS and PIU staff on ADB\u2019s guidelines \nand procedures. Annual project audits will be arranged by the National Audit Office. \n \n26.  The project is classified category B for procurement risk. The project procurement risk is \nmoderate because of (i) lack of full-time procurement staff and technical capacity to prepare, \nprocure, and supervise civil works for school and kindergarten construction and expansion, and \n ", "8 \nconsulting services; and (ii) weaknesses in goods receipt procedures and controls at MECSS. \nThese risks will be mitigated by the recruitment of an experienced procurement specialist for the \nPIU and the training of MECSS and PIU staff on ADB\u2019s guidelines and procedures. The engineers \nwith experience in school and kindergarten construction and expansion at the Ulaanbaatar \nMetropolitan Education Department will be part of the civil works bid evaluation committees. All \nprocurement under the project will be carried out by MECSS with the support of the PIU. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the MECSS. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 12). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n28.  The  project  will  directly  benefit  about  11,000  primary  and  secondary  students  and \n4,500 pre-primary students enrolled in newly constructed or expanded schools and kindergartens \nwith inclusive features (disabled access and age- and gender-inclusive sanitation) in Ulaanbaatar \nand some aimag centers. Five schools and 12 kindergartens supported under the project will be \nin low-income, poorly serviced districts of Ulaanbaatar (Bayanzurkh and Songinokhairkhan), \nwhich are the main destinations of rural migrants. The other schools and kindergartens will be in \nthe districts (Bayangol, Chingeltei, Khan-Uul, Nalaikh, and Sukhbaatar) and aimag centers (Altai, \nDarkhan, Sainshand, and Sumber), which have large classes with 35\u201350 students and three shifts \n(Altai).  The  project  will  also  support  the  provision  of  quality  TLM  for  poorly  resourced \nkindergartens in rural areas.  \n \n29.  Gender benefits. The project is designed to mainstream gender effectively. Eliminating \nthree-shift schools will reduce the risk of accidents and assaults on the way home for students in \nthe third shift, especially females, as the third shift class finishes at 8 or 9 p.m. The poverty and \nsocial analysis conducted for the project revealed that women are concerned with the lack of \nseats in kindergartens and schools close to home, and they often have to look for kindergartens \nand schools elsewhere and spend more time dropping off and picking up children at kindergartens \nand schools. In addition, since children need to walk long distances to kindergartens and schools, \nwomen worry about potential accidents. Boys remain less likely to enroll in schools than girls, \nespecially in rural areas where they need to look after animals.13 A social and gender action plan \n(SGAP) has been developed to ensure social inclusion and gender mainstreaming in all the \nproject outputs. The SGAP includes actions and targets related to (i) gender-sensitive and \ninclusive features in school and kindergarten designs; (ii) gender-sensitive criteria and standards \nfor TLM; (iii) women\u2019s participation in training for school and kindergarten managers and teachers; \nand (iv) the collection of sex-disaggregated data for planning, monitoring, and evaluation, to be \nincluded in the GIS-based real-time information system. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n30.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.14 \n \n31.  Environment (category B). Initial environmental examination and public consultations \nwere conducted on 49 potential school and kindergarten construction and expansion sites. All \n                                                \n13 The gender parity index at the primary and secondary levels improved in favor of boys from 1.00 in 2008 to 0.94 in \n2014, but this was largely because school-age boys outnumbered school-age girls. \n14 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories \n ", "9 \npotential impacts have been identified, including dust, noise, vibration from machinery and casting, \ntemporary traffic disturbance, associated risks to the community, and occupational health and \nsafety on-site. Related mitigation measures, construction supervision, monitoring, grievance \nredress, and reporting have been defined in an environmental management plan. The initial \nenvironmental examination has been disclosed on the ADB website. The climate change impact \nof the project was assessed and classified low climate risk as increases in precipitation and \ntemperatures are unlikely to affect the project outputs.15 However, the facilities will be designed \nto minimize risks from increased precipitation, temperature, snowfall, and storm. The project will \nalso introduce increased energy-efficiency measures to reduce heat loss and indirectly reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. \n \n32.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project will not require any permanent \nand/or temporary land acquisition or resettlement. Due diligence had been conducted on potential \nschool and kindergarten sites, which confirmed that no physical or economic displacement will \nensue because of the project. The construction, expansion, and rehabilitation of schools and \nkindergartens will be accommodated within the existing premises and compounds. With no \nplanned  land  acquisition,  the  project  is  unlikely  to  trigger  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nrequirements for involuntary resettlement. \n \n33.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project seeks to sustain access to and quality of \neducation for all kindergartner and school-age children, regardless of ethnicity. The poverty and \nsocial analysis confirmed that ethnic groups will not be impacted negatively. Measures to enhance \ninclusiveness and sensitivity, and maximize project benefits for all vulnerable groups, including \nethnic groups,  have  been  incorporated  into  the  SGAP. These  include  the  improvement  of \ntextbooks and other TLM in the Kazakh language, as well as the introduction of culturally \nresponsive teaching approaches. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n34.  The overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks involved. \nSignificant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.16 The overall risk was rated substantial. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nMECSS lacks sufficient number of  The PIU procurement specialist and civil engineer will support the civil works \nqualified staff to develop detailed  bid evaluation committees.
