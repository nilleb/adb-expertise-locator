Significant cuts in the education budget \nfor 2017 and beyond greatly constrain the government\u2019s capacity to mitigate further deterioration \nof education services. This will result in lost opportunities for pre-primary, primary, and secondary \neducation, especially for children who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Support from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) is urgently needed to minimize the negative effects during this \ndifficult  economic  period  by  (i)  narrowing  the  gap  in  the  enrollment  capacity  of  schools  and \nkindergartens  in  Ulaanbaatar  and  some  aimag 1  centers,  (ii)  supporting  the  completion  of \nunfinished  curriculum  reform  and  associated  assessment  system  reforms,  (iii)   ensuring  the \nprovision  of  teaching  and  learning  materials  (TLM)  that  accompany  the  new  curriculum, \n(iv) upgrading  the  skills  and  knowledge  of  teachers  and  managers  for  the  new  curriculum  and \nassessments, and (v) strengthening systems for planning and managing education services. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  growth  of  Mongolia\u2019s  economy  has  rapidly  decelerated  since  2011  because  of \ndeclining foreign direct investment and falling commodity prices. This slowed growth has caused \nserious  economic  difficulties,  including  large  revenue  shortfalls  and  cuts  in  government \ninvestment, which are expected to continue beyond 2017 and require the government to reduce \npublic spending further. The government has cut education spending to a minimum, only enough \nto keep schools and kindergartens operating. Access to and the quality of pre-primary, primary, \nand  secondary  education  are  likely  to  deteriorate  with  the  growth  of  the  population  of \nkindergartner and school-age children and unfinished curriculum and assessment system reforms, \nunless some mitigating measures are implemented. \n \nSeats  in  schools  and  kindergartens  have  increasingly  become  unavailable  due  to  the \n4. \ngrowth in the population of kindergartner and school-age children which has been outpacing the \nconstruction  and  expansion  of  schools  and  kindergartens.  While  enrollments  in  pre-primary \neducation doubled (105.9%) from SY2009 to SY2015, the number of kindergartens increased by \nonly  58.2%.2 Similarly,  enrollments  in  primary  and  secondary  education  rose  by  7.8%  during \nSY2012\u2013SY2015,  but  only  13  schools  were  built  during  the  period,  an  increase  of  1.7%. \nConsequently, the enrollment capacity of schools and kindergartens has been overstretched, with \nthe class size enlarged and 33 schools operating in three shifts in SY2016 (of which 30 are in \nUlaanbaatar).3 The  gap  in  enrollment  capacity  has  been  widening  particularly  in  Ulaanbaatar \nbecause of disproportionate population growth caused by internal migration. The average class \nsize at Ulaanbaatar schools is 37 at the primary level, the largest in the country, as enrollments \nexpanded  by  18.1%  during  SY2012\u2013SY2015.  With  an  increase  of  41.5%  in  pre-primary \nenrollments, the class size at free public kindergartens in Ulaanbaatar is even larger, at 40\u201350 \n\n                                                \n1  An aimag is an administrative subdivision in Mongolia. \n2  Students enrolled in pre-primary education totaled 109,479 in SY2009 and jumped to 225,388 in SY2015. There \nwere  814  kindergartens  in  SY2009,  of  which  102  were  private.  The  number  rose  to  1,288  in  SY2015,  of  which \n462 were private. \n\n3  Although the class size became larger, the student\u2013teacher ratio remained constant at 18:3\u201318:8 during SY2012\u2013\n\nSY2015. \n\n \n\n\fstudents, and students are selected for admission by lottery. Although net enrollment rates at pre-\nprimary,  primary,  and  junior  secondary  levels  have  been  improving  steadily,  these  may  be \nreversed  unless  schools  and  kindergartens  are  built  or  expanded.  The  population  of \nkindergartners  is  projected  to  grow  further  until  2019,  while  the  population  of  primary  and \nsecondary school-age children is expected to rise until 2025. \n \n5. \nThe curriculum reform, which started in SY2013 with the pilot test of a new curriculum for \nprimary  education,  remains  incomplete  without  the  pilot  test  and  implementation  of  a  new \ncurriculum for senior secondary education.4 Moreover, the current curriculum still lacks learning \noutcome  standards  for  students  at  every  grade  level,  which  leaves  students  and  teachers \nunguided and confused. The current student learning assessment system is not reliable and fails \nto provide feedback on student learning or education policy. Furthermore, the standards for school \nperformance  evaluation  have  become  too  outdated  to  encourage  school-based  continuing \nprofessional development (CPD) of teachers and school leaders, and effective management of \nschool resources to support the implementation of the current curriculum. Likewise, the current \nstandards for teacher evaluation are too general to help teachers develop knowledge and skills. \n \n6. \nThe new curriculum was introduced with little accompanying TLM\u2014including textbooks, \nteachers\u2019  guides,  student  workbooks,  tools,  and  equipment\u2014provided  to  implement  it,  which \nnegatively affected the quality of student learning. There are huge disparities in the distribution of \nTLM  among  schools  and  kindergartens.  Schools  and  kindergartens  in  rural  areas  are  more \ndisadvantaged than those in urban areas, as the transportation cost is higher. Since a standard \nset of TLM accompanying the curriculum for each grade does not exist, TLM have been provided \non an ad hoc basis, further intensifying disparities. \n \n7. \nExisting in-service professional development programs do not assist teachers in adopting \na  child-centered  methodology  and  the  formative  and  summative  assessment  and  evaluation \nmethods required by the new curriculum. The budget allocated for teacher training is generally \ntoo limited to cover even the mandatory training for teachers in the first, fifth, and 10th year of \nservice, causing the quality of education to suffer. In addition, little CPD opportunities are provided \nfor school and kindergarten managers who are expected to provide instructional leadership for \nthe implementation of the curriculum. \n \n8. \nThe  low  population  density  and  harsh  winters  in  Mongolia  have  caused  inefficiency  in \neducation expenditures. The cost of providing education services is high because (i) education \nservices need to be provided in sparsely populated rural areas; (ii) school dormitory services are \nneeded for one-quarter of the population engaged in seminomadic herding; (iii) constant heating \nis required in schools, dormitories, and kindergartens during extremely cold winter months; and \n(iv) many  nonteaching  staff  are  employed  to  operate  and  maintain  schools,  dormitories,  and \nkindergartens. The government lacks effective information gathering, planning, and management \nsystems for schools, dormitories, and kindergartens; and resource-sharing mechanisms between \nschools and kindergartens. \n \n9. \nStrategic fit. The project will support key priorities set out in  the Mongolia Sustainable \nDevelopment Vision 2030 and Action Program for 2016\u20132020 for the education sector, including \n                                                \n4  The  curriculum  reform  was  undertaken  in  phases.  In  SY2014,  the  new  curriculum  for  primary  education  was \nimplemented nationwide, while a new curriculum for junior secondary education and pre-primary education was pilot \ntested. In SY2015, the new curriculum for junior secondary and pre-primary education was implemented nationwide. \nHowever, the development and pilot test of a new curriculum for senior secondary education were delayed and has \nnot been completed, as of August 2017.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n(i) providing equal, inclusive, and practical educational services; (ii) allowing every child in urban \nareas to  enroll  in  a  kindergarten;  (iii)  alleviating  over-enrollment  and  eliminating  three  shifts  in \nschools;  (iv)  introducing a  system  of evaluation  of  education quality  and  results  at  all  levels  of \neducation;  and  (v)  building  an  education  system  based  on  standards.5 It  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \neducation sector operations plan, which emphasizes the importance of improving student learning \noutcomes.6 The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u2013\n2020 which promotes economic and social stability in a period of economic difficulties.7 \n \nLessons.  A  review  of  the  curriculum  implementation  conducted  under  ADB\u2019s  technical \n10. \nassistance showed  that  most  teachers  accept  the  curriculum  but  struggle  with  implementation \nbecause  of  lack  of  (i)  learning  outcome  statements  in  the  curriculum;  (ii)  understanding, \nknowledge,  and  skills  regarding  child-centered  methodology  and  formative  and  summative \nstudent  assessment  and  evaluation  methods;  and  (iii)  quality TLM.8 These findings  have been \nincorporated  into  the  project  design.  The  project  also  draws  on  lessons  learned  from  the \nexperience  of  ADB  and  other  development  partners  in  supporting  school  and  kindergarten \nconstruction and expansion, particularly the importance of (i) reliable enrollment and population \ngrowth  projections  in  planning  capital  investments,  and  (ii)  daily  construction  supervision  to \nensure the quality of school and kindergarten buildings. \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  more  accessible,  more  equitable,  and \nbetter  quality  education  system  developed  (footnote  5).  The  project  will  have  the  following \noutcome:  access  to  and  quality  of  pre-primary,  primary,  and  secondary  education  sustained \nduring economic difficulties.9 \n \nC. \n \n12. \n \n13. \nOutput 1: Gap in enrollment capacity of schools and kindergartens narrowed. The \nproject will support the construction and expansion of schools and kindergartens in Ulaanbaatar \nand aimag centers (Altai, Darkhan, Sainshand, and Sumber) to make more seats available and \nreduce  three-shift  schools  and  class  size.  Inclusive  (age,  gender,  and  special  needs),  energy-\nefficient (improved insulation and heating systems), and disaster-resilient features10 will be built \ninto  new  and  expanded schools  and kindergartens  using  innovative designs  introduced  by the \ngovernment and other development partners. \n \n14. \nOutput  2:  Unfinished  curriculum  reform  and  associated  assessment  system \nreforms completed. The project will support the completion of unfinished curriculum reform and \nassociated  assessment  system  reforms  by  updating  curriculum  standards;  student  learning \nassessment criteria, methods  and system for  primary, junior,  and  senior secondary  education; \n\nThe project will have five outputs. \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n5  State Great Khural. 2016.

The curriculum for all grades and subjects will \nincorporate  clearly  defined  learning  outcome  standards,  while  the  Mongolian  language  and \nliterature  curriculum  for  grades  1\u201312  will  be  reviewed  comprehensively  to  improve  the  writing, \nreading, and communication skills of students. Based on the updated outcome standards, student \nlearning  assessment  criteria  and  methods  will  also  be  reviewed,  and  the  system  for  student \nlearning  assessment  in  primary,  junior,  and  senior  secondary  education  will  be  upgraded  by \nstrengthening  the  capacity  of  the  Education  Evaluation  Center.  Moreover,  school  evaluation \nstandards will be updated to strengthen school-based management and assist with schools\u2019 self-\nevaluation, performance improvements, and reporting. The existing teacher evaluation standards \nwill be revised to include differentiated competency levels and encourage self-appraisal and CPD. \nFurther, the curriculum for pre-service teacher education programs will be reviewed in line with \nthe updated school curriculum standards, student learning assessment criteria and methods, and \ncompetency-based standards for teachers. \n \n15. \nOutput  3:  Teaching  and  learning  materials  that  accompany  the  new  curriculum \nprovided. The project will update TLM standards, including those for developing, evaluating, and \nselecting TLM, to improve the quality of and enhance systems for distributing TLM. A profile of \nTLM  accompanying  the  curriculum  for  each  grade,  including  pre-primary  education  and \nequivalency program, and their layout and physical standards will be developed. The project will \nalso support the provision of quality TLM for poorly resourced kindergartens.  \n \n16. \nOutput  4:  Teachers\u2019  and  managers\u2019  knowledge  and  skills  upgraded  for  the  new \ncurriculum  and  assessments.  The  project  will  upgrade  the  knowledge  and  skills  of  teachers \nand  managers  (principals  and  head  teachers)  of  schools  and  kindergartens  to  implement  the \nupdated curriculum standards, assessment, and evaluation. Given budget constraints, the project \nwill  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Institute  of  Teachers  Professional  Development  (ITPD)  to \ndevelop  and  deliver  CPD  programs  for  pre-primary,  primary,  and  secondary  teachers  through \nexisting online platforms and workshops.11 Model science, math, and information technology (IT) \nlaboratories  will  be  established  at  the  ITPD  to  train  secondary  teachers  in  using  laboratory \nequipment and in facilitating student experiments emphasized in the curriculum. Moreover, CPD \nprograms  for  school  and  kindergarten  managers,  and  Ulaanbaatar  and  aimag  education \ndepartment staff, will be developed and delivered to improve leadership during the implementation \nof the updated curriculum standards, assessment, and evaluation. \n \n17. \nOutput  5:  Systems  for  planning  and  managing  education  services  strengthened. \nThe  project  will  strengthen  systems  for  planning  and  managing  pre-primary,  primary,  and \nsecondary education services in the medium term. A geographic information system (GIS)-based \nreal-time  information  system  integrated  into  existing  systems  will  be  developed  to  collect  and \nanalyze information on school and kindergarten construction, expansion, and rehabilitation needs, \ntaking into account population and enrollment growth projections, and trends in internal migration. \nThe introduction of cluster systems for schools with senior secondary grades and kindergartens \nwill be explored and pilot tested to facilitate resource sharing between schools and kindergartens. \nThe  policy  and  system  for  school  and  kindergarten  catchment  areas  will  be  reviewed  and \nmeasures  to  strengthen  their  enforcement  will  be  identified  to  improve  the  planning  and \nmanagement  of  school  and  kindergarten  enrollments,  as  well  as  construction,  expansion,  and \nrehabilitation. \n \n\n                                                \n11 In  2017,  about  30%  of  primary  and  secondary  teachers  participate  in  CPD  programs  through  online  platforms \n\n(Appendix 1, baseline for indicator 4d). \n\n\f5 \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nD. \n \n18. \nThe project is estimated to cost $50.69 million (Table 1).

Heating,  water,  and  wastewater \nfacilities linked to the constructed and expanded schools and kindergartens will be (i) compatible \nwith available infrastructure for basic services on-site, and (ii) easy and inexpensive to operate \nand maintain. School and kindergarten furniture to be supplied will be of better quality and safer, \nwith  sharp  corners  eliminated.  The  facilities  will  have  sound  seismic  design  to  withstand \nearthquakes and winter snowstorms, improved flood control, and precipitation-resistant features \nfor  all  the  schools  and  kindergartens  supported  under  the  project.  Additionally,  the  project  will \nsupport  the  establishment  of  model  science,  math,  and  IT  laboratories  at  the  ITPD  building. \nAdequate  water,  wastewater,  and  ventilation  facilities  will  be  built  into  the  laboratory  design. \nDatabase, data analytics, test item validation, GIS, and other software, information systems, and \nequipment to be procured for the Education Evaluation Center, ITPD, and MECSS will be user-\nfriendly  and  compatible  with  existing  systems,  and  users  will  be  trained.  In  developing  an  e-\nlearning,  e-textbook,  and  e-library  policy  and  implementation  plan,  e-learning  technical \npreparedness,  including internet  and  power  connectivity,  security,  IT  equipment, furniture,  and \noperation  and  maintenance  costs  will  be  reviewed  and  suitable  e-learning  modalities  will  be \nidentified. Teaching and school staff will be provided with appropriate training. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nEconomic analysis. The project economic rationale was assessed as sound, because \nthe  project  will  support  the  construction  and  expansion  of  schools  and  kindergartens  in \nUlaanbaatar  where  the  demand  for  additional  seats  is  particularly  high.  A  cost-effectiveness \nanalysis was conducted to compare the project case with two alternatives in terms of (i) the target \narea  for  school  and  kindergarten  construction  and  expansion;  (ii)  the  presence  or  absence  of \ninterventions related to curriculum and student learning assessment system reforms, and CPD; \nand  (iii)  anticipated  impacts  on  access  to  quality  education,  student  learning  outcomes,  and \ncurriculum and education policy. The project case was assessed as the most cost-effective option \nas  it  would  enable  the  largest  number  of  students  to  enroll  in  the  supported  facilities,  and \ncontribute to improvements in student learning and education policy. The project is considered as \neconomically viable and sustainable. \n \n24. \nFinancial sustainability. The financial sustainability of the project was assessed at the \nfiscal and project levels, since there are no revenue-generating components. An analysis of recent \nexpenditures, incremental recurrent costs, and projected budgets was undertaken to evaluate the \nfiscal  impact  of  the  project  on  the  budget  of  the  government  and  MECSS.  Given  economic \ndifficulties, counterpart funding will be limited to $0.69 million or 1.4% of the total project cost in \nthe form of tax exemptions. Hence, negative impacts on the budget are considered minimal. \n \nC. \n \nThe  financial  management  risk  is  substantial  mainly  because  of  the  lack  of  staff  with \n25. \nexperience in managing donor-funded projects, and weaknesses in internal controls and asset \nmanagement  procedures  at  MECSS.  Key  mitigation  measures  for  these  risks  include  the \n(i) establishment  of  a  PIU  staffed  by  an  experienced  financial  management  professional  to \nmanage the project funds, (ii) installation of accounting software at the PIU to generate financial \nreports and track the project assets, and (iii) training of MECSS and PIU staff on ADB\u2019s guidelines \nand procedures. Annual project audits will be arranged by the National Audit Office. \n \nThe project is classified category B for procurement risk. The project procurement risk is \n26. \nmoderate  because  of  (i)  lack  of  full-time  procurement  staff  and  technical  capacity  to  prepare, \nprocure, and supervise civil works for school and kindergarten construction and expansion, and \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nconsulting  services;  and  (ii)  weaknesses  in goods  receipt  procedures  and  controls  at  MECSS. \nThese risks will be mitigated by the recruitment of an experienced procurement specialist for the \nPIU and the training of MECSS and PIU staff on ADB\u2019s guidelines and procedures. The engineers \nwith  experience  in  school  and  kindergarten  construction  and  expansion  at  the  Ulaanbaatar \nMetropolitan Education Department will be part of the civil works bid evaluation committees. All \nprocurement under the project will be carried out by MECSS with the support of the PIU. \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MECSS.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 12). \n \nD. \n \n28. \nThe  project  will  directly  benefit  about  11,000  primary  and  secondary  students  and \n4,500 pre-primary students enrolled in newly constructed or expanded schools and kindergartens \nwith inclusive features (disabled access and age- and gender-inclusive sanitation) in Ulaanbaatar \nand some aimag centers. Five schools and 12 kindergartens supported under the project will be \nin  low-income,  poorly  serviced  districts  of  Ulaanbaatar  (Bayanzurkh  and  Songinokhairkhan), \nwhich are the main destinations of rural migrants. The other schools and kindergartens will be in \nthe districts (Bayangol, Chingeltei, Khan-Uul, Nalaikh, and Sukhbaatar) and aimag centers (Altai, \nDarkhan, Sainshand, and Sumber), which have large classes with 35\u201350 students and three shifts \n(Altai).  The  project  will  also  support  the  provision  of  quality  TLM  for  poorly  resourced \nkindergartens in rural areas.  \n \nGender benefits. The project is designed to mainstream gender effectively. Eliminating \n29. \nthree-shift schools will reduce the risk of accidents and assaults on the way home for students in \nthe third shift, especially females, as the third shift class finishes at 8 or 9 p.m. The poverty and \nsocial  analysis  conducted  for  the  project  revealed  that  women  are  concerned  with  the  lack  of \nseats in kindergartens and schools close to home, and they often have to look for kindergartens \nand schools elsewhere and spend more time dropping off and picking up children at kindergartens \nand schools. In addition, since children need to walk long distances to kindergartens and schools, \nwomen  worry  about  potential  accidents.  Boys  remain less  likely  to enroll  in schools  than girls, \nespecially in rural areas where they need to look after animals.13 A social and gender action plan \n(SGAP)  has  been  developed  to  ensure  social  inclusion  and  gender  mainstreaming  in  all  the \nproject  outputs.  The  SGAP  includes  actions  and  targets  related  to  (i)  gender-sensitive  and \ninclusive features in school and kindergarten designs; (ii) gender-sensitive criteria and standards \nfor TLM; (iii) women\u2019s participation in training for school and kindergarten managers and teachers; \nand (iv) the collection of sex-disaggregated data for planning, monitoring, and evaluation, to be \nincluded in the GIS-based real-time information system. \n \nE. \n \n30. \ncategories are as follows.14 \n \n31. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  Initial  environmental  examination  and  public  consultations \nwere  conducted  on  49  potential  school  and kindergarten  construction  and expansion  sites.  All \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n13 The gender parity index at the primary and secondary levels improved in favor of boys from 1.00 in 2008 to 0.94 in \n\n2014, but this was largely because school-age boys outnumbered school-age girls. \n14 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories \n\n\f9 \n\npotential impacts have been identified, including dust, noise, vibration from machinery and casting, \ntemporary  traffic  disturbance,  associated  risks  to  the  community,  and  occupational  health  and \nsafety  on-site.  Related  mitigation  measures,  construction  supervision,  monitoring,  grievance \nredress,  and  reporting  have  been  defined  in  an  environmental  management  plan.  The  initial \nenvironmental examination has been disclosed on the ADB website. The climate change impact \nof  the  project  was  assessed  and  classified  low  climate  risk  as  increases  in  precipitation  and \ntemperatures are unlikely to affect the project outputs.15 However, the facilities will be designed \nto minimize risks from increased precipitation, temperature, snowfall, and storm. The project will \nalso introduce increased energy-efficiency measures to reduce heat loss and indirectly reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. \n \n32. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  will  not  require  any  permanent \nand/or temporary land acquisition or resettlement. Due diligence had been conducted on potential \nschool and kindergarten sites, which confirmed that no physical or economic displacement will \nensue  because  of  the  project.  The  construction,  expansion,  and  rehabilitation  of  schools  and \nkindergartens  will  be  accommodated  within  the  existing  premises  and  compounds.  With  no \nplanned  land  acquisition,  the  project  is  unlikely  to  trigger  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nrequirements for involuntary resettlement. \n \n33. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The project seeks to sustain access to and quality of \neducation for all kindergartner and school-age children, regardless of ethnicity. The poverty and \nsocial analysis confirmed that ethnic groups will not be impacted negatively. Measures to enhance \ninclusiveness and sensitivity, and maximize project benefits for  all vulnerable groups, including \nethnic  groups,  have  been  incorporated  into  the  SGAP.  These  include  the  improvement  of \ntextbooks  and  other  TLM  in  the  Kazakh  language,  as  well  as  the  introduction  of  culturally \nresponsive teaching approaches. \n \nF. \n \n34. \nThe overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks involved. \nSignificant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.16 The overall risk was rated substantial. \n \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nMECSS lacks sufficient number of \nqualified staff to develop detailed \nspecifications and evaluate bids; \nand to monitor all phases of \nschool and kindergarten \nconstruction, expansion, and \nrehabilitation. \n\nDelays in procurement and late \napplication for construction \npermits reduce construction time. \n\nMECSS has no accounting staff \nwith experience in managing \ndonor-funded projects and no full-\ntime procurement staff. \n\nMitigation Measures \nThe PIU procurement specialist and civil engineer will support the civil works \nbid evaluation committees. Engineers with experience in school and \nkindergarten construction from UMED will be part of the civil works bid \nevaluation committees. MECSS, UMED, and the PIU will be supported by \nnational construction supervision specialists and an international construction \nsupervision training specialist, as well as by engineering firms that will prepare \ndesigns, drawings, specifications, and bill of quantities to oversee civil works on \na daily basis. \nThe PIU will develop a detailed plan for school and kindergarten construction \nand expansion to be reviewed and approved by the project steering committee, \nwhich will coordinate procurement processes, as well as application and \nawarding of permits between different government agencies. \nA PIU will be established and staffed by a financial management specialist \nand/or accountant and a procurement specialist with skills and experience to \nmanage donor funds and procurement. The PIU will develop detailed \naccounting procedures to ensure effective management and control of the \n\n                                                \n15 Rapid Environmental Assessment checklist. \n16 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \n\nAsset management procedures, \ncontract compliance procedures, \nand internal controls have some \nweaknesses. \n\nMitigation Measures \nproject funds and assets. MECSS and PIU staff will be trained in ADB \ndisbursement and procurement. \nThe PIU will develop procedures to control receipt of assets and manage them. \nProject assets will be tracked in the accounting software. It will also develop \nprocedures to administer, monitor, and control contracts. The PIU will be \nsupported by international and national consultants to ensure that civil works \ncontractors comply with contractual terms and specifications. The Internal Audit \nCommittee of MECSS will be trained and an internal audit charter will be \ndeveloped. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  MECSS  =  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture,  Science  and  Sports;  PIU  =  project \nimplementation unit; UMED = Ulaanbaatar Metropolitan Education Department. \nSource: ADB. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n35. \nThe government and MECSS have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n36. \nwhich are set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \n\nThe government and MECSS have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n37. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $50,000,000 \nto Mongolia for the Sustaining Access to and Quality of Education During Economic Difficulties \nProject, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof  26  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n30 October 2017 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nMore accessible, more equitable, and better quality education system developed (Mongolia Sustainable \nDevelopment Vision 2030 and Action Program for 2016\u20132020)a  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nAccess to and quality \nof pre-primary, primary, \nand secondary \neducation sustained \nduring economic \ndifficulties \n\nPerformance Indicators with Targets and \nBaselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n\nBy 2022: \na.
