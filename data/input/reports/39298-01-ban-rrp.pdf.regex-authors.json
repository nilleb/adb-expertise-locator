I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the City Region Development Project. The report \nalso  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  grants  for  (i)  Strengthening  Regional \nPlanning and Governance, and (ii) Energy Efficiency Improvement, and if the Board approves \nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the \nTAs. \n \n2.  The project1 aims to increase growth potential and environmental sustainability of two \ncity regions based on coherent regional urban planning. A city region is defined as an organic \nagglomeration of a large city, surrounding secondary towns, and adjacent peri-urban areas. The \nproject will target the city regions of Dhaka and Khulna.2 It will support the development of key \nurban infrastructure, focusing on urban environment and local economic development. The \nproject  also  supports  government  efforts  to  improve  regional  and  urban  planning,  and  to \nstrengthen  municipal  management  and  capacity  for  effective  and  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Urbanization  in  Bangladesh.  Bangladesh  has  urbanized  very  rapidly  and  its \nframeworks of urban planning and development are not capable to meet the evolving demands. \nGrowing at current rates, the country\u2019s urban population is estimated to double by 2035 and \nreach  74  million.3  In  the  course  of  this  rapid  urbanization,  a  large  city  (city  corporation), \nsurrounding secondary towns (pourashavas), and adjacent peri-urban areas (urban centers) \nhave been agglomerating into a city region with close economic and social links.4 However, while \neffectively one sprawling city, it is still administered by multiple municipal governments. Because a \ncomprehensive  framework  for  integrated  planning  and  coordination  among  municipalities  is \nlacking,  the  city  regions  have  been  unable  to  realize  their  full  development  potential. \nImplementation of the Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan (DMDP) (1995\u20132015) has been \nvery slow, and the plan is fast becoming outdated. Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK)5 led \nthe preparation of the DMDP, and there are criticisms that it did not sufficiently consult with the \npublic and the municipalities. Private and public development projects are not always coordinated \nenough to focus limited resources on priority areas.  \n \n4.  The project will support improvement of urban planning through a review and update of \nthe  urban  development  plans,  notably  the  DMDP,  and  strengthen  coordination  between \nmunicipalities and planning agencies. The DMDP and municipal development plans will be \nupdated in a consistent manner to establish a coherent regional development framework. The \nproject will support the implementation of the DMDP through feasibility studies and investment \nin key infrastructure. An associated TA, Strengthening Regional Planning and Governance, will \n                                                 \n1  The project was prepared through ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for \nPreparing the City Region Development Project. Manila. \n2  Dhaka is the largest city in Bangladesh and Khulna is the third largest, and both have good growth potential. The \nsecond largest city, Chittagong, is excluded since other development partners have major programs supporting \nChittagong. ADB has ongoing and planned projects in Dhaka and Khulna that will underpin this project.    \n3  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2005. Dhaka. \n4  The project will build on the foundation and frameworks developed under the flagship publication Asian Development \nBank (ADB). 2008. City Cluster Development \u2013 Toward an Urban-Led Development Strategy for Asia. Manila. \n5  Rajdhani  Unnayan  Kartripakkha  means  capital  development  authority.  RAJUK  is  the  government  agency \nresponsible for urban planning in the Dhaka city region. \n ", "2 \nreview the institutional framework for regional planning and governance to rationalize urban \nplanning and development control.  \n \n5.  Municipal infrastructure and services. The development of urban infrastructure has \nnot kept pace with the rapid urbanization. Combined with ineffective planning and control, \ninadequate infrastructure causes environmental degradation, and restricts economic and social \nactivities.  In  Dhaka,  pollution  of  water  bodies  caused  by  limited  sewerage  and  poor \nmaintenance of sanitation facilities such as septic tanks has become a serious concern. In \nKhulna, floods and water logging severely restrict local economic activities in monsoon season. \nClimate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of flooding. Piped water is \navailable only in the city center, and water service is poor in most pourashavas. Lack of access \nto water and sanitation facilities imposes a particular burden on women, who are primary \ncaretakers of household health. Available transport infrastructure cannot cope with growing \ntraffic  volumes,  and  traffic  flows  are  further  limited  by  poor  traffic  management,  such  as \nuncontrolled roadside parking. Poor roadside conditions adversely affect pedestrians, most of \nwhich are women and the poor.   \n \n6.  Municipalities  have  not  been  able  to  address  these  issues  for  lack  of  human  and \nfinancial resources. The few interventions are reactive, responding only to the immediate needs, \nwithout a coordinated strategy for effective investments. The project will enhance the capacity of \nthe infrastructure that is best suited to improve the urban environment and stimulate the local \neconomy. The project takes a sector approach, and subprojects will be prioritized to ensure \ncoherent  regional  development.  Although  municipalities  tend  to  be  constrained  by  limited \ncapacity, some have achieved remarkable improvements through recent projects such as the \nUrban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project (UGIIP).6 The key lesson \nlearned from the UGIIP is that performance-based allocation of investment funds creates strong \nincentives, and substantial improvement can be achieved if it is combined with appropriate \ncapacity building programs.7 Based on these achievements and lessons learned, the project will \nadopt performance-based allocation of investment funds. The flexibility of a sector loan will \nallow municipalities to compete with each other to secure the investment funds, creating strong \nincentive to meet the performance targets. The capacity-building programs will follow the UGIIP \nprograms  and  particularly  help  new  municipalities  achieve  performance  targets.  Project \nimplementation will be more expeditious than previously possible since many implementing \nagencies have strengthened their capacity under the UGIIP.8 \n \n7.  Climate change. Municipalities are not well prepared to adapt to the expected impacts \nof climate change, and unaware of the potential benefits of energy efficiency. Since Bangladesh \nis one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change impacts, policy and advisory TA for \nStrengthening  Resilience  of  the  Water  Sector  in  Khulna  to  Climate  Change9  has  been \nconducted to assess the potential impacts and explore adaptation measures. Urban planning \nand key infrastructure in Khulna, notably drainage, will reflect these findings. The project will \nsupport the municipalities in improving the energy efficiency of streetlights and water pumps, \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Urban Governance and infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project. \nManila. For example, property tax collection improved from 34% to 83% in pourashavas that carried out programs \nunder the UGIIP. Public participation in municipal management has been strengthened through various citizens\u2019 \ncommittees. The Pourashava Act (2009) has made it mandatory to form citizens\u2019 committees. \n7  ADB. 2009. Evaluation Study: Urban Sector and Water Supply and Sanitation in Bangladesh.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nwhich account for most of their energy consumption. Municipalities operate water pumps of very \nlow  efficiency,  and  streetlights  are  fitted  with  inefficient  fluorescent  tubes,  implying  large \npotential to save energy and cut carbon dioxide (CO ) emission. Since energy costs account for \n2\na large share of municipalities' recurrent expenditures, higher energy efficiency can substantially \nimprove municipal finances.  \n \n8.  Context in country programming. The project is designed in line with ADB\u2019s country \nstrategy and program (2006\u20132010).10 Urban development is a focus area of the country strategy \nand program, and the project will directly contribute to the key outcomes of social development \nand sustainable economic growth. Since the long-term investment requirements of the project\u2019s \ncity  regions  are  very  large,  the  project  will  (i)  directly  fund  crucial  infrastructure  and  (ii) \ncomplement ongoing and planned future projects.11 Its design also reflects lessons learned from \nprevious  interventions  and  takes  into  account  recommendations  of  the  sector  program \nassistance evaluation.12 The project will invest in multiple municipalities within the two city \nregions, engaging them constructively in the establishment of a coherent regional development \nplan. The DMDP update and the preparation of feasibility studies will result in a clear road map \nto support a long-term engagement and pinpoint the need for future projects.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  impact  of  the  project  will  be  enhanced  growth  potential  and  environmental \nsustainability of the two city regions. The outcome will be improved urban environment and \ninfrastructure services based on effective regional and urban planning.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n1.  Output 1: Enhanced Capacity of Urban Infrastructure \n \n10.  The project will enhance the capacity of crucial urban infrastructure. This output will be \nachieved through implementation of subprojects selected according to pre-established criteria.13 \nThe subprojects will be developed and prioritized within the framework of the updated regional \nurban plans (output 2) to ensure coherent regional development. Municipalities are required to \nmeet certain performance criteria for funding of subprojects, which will create strong incentive to \nimprove municipal management and governance (output 3). \n \n11.  Water supply and sanitation. Subprojects relating to water supply and sanitation will \nexpand access to such services. Water-supply subprojects will initially focus on rehabilitating \nexisting facilities to reduce leaks, before expanding the system. They will adopt energy-efficient \npumps which will be piloted under TA for energy efficiency improvement. Sanitation subprojects \nwill emphasize better design and maintenance of septic tanks, as introduction of a sewer \nnetwork  is  premature.  Design  and  management  of  the  subprojects  will  take  into  account \nwomen\u2019s requirements since they tend to fetch water and manage sanitation facilities for the \nwhole family.  \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2005.

Solidwaste  management.  Subprojects  for  solid-waste  management  will  improve \ncollection and disposal of solid waste. They will be accompanied by awareness campaigns for \nthe 3Rs (reduce-reuse-recycle). Primary collection will be mostly outsourced to community-\nbased organizations (CBOs) or nongovernment organizations.14 Women will be encouraged to \nparticipate in awareness campaign and CBOs. Opportunities for private sector participation and \nregistration with the Clean Development Mechanism will be explored, particularly if disposal \ninvolves composting. To exploit economies of scale and nurture inter-municipality cooperation, \nthe project will promote the sharing of treatment and disposal facilities among municipalities. \n \n13.  Energy efficiency program. Subprojects in the energy efficiency program will reduce \nenergy consumption to mitigate CO  emission, and cut energy costs to improve municipal \n2\nfinances.  The  program  will  focus  on  introducing  energy-efficient  water  pumps  and  solar-\npowered streetlights. It will start with detailed energy audits and a pilot program, followed by \ncapacity and awareness building among municipalities for an expansion of the pilot program. \nOpportunities  to  register  the  subprojects  with  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  will  be \nexplored. \n \n14.  Urban transport. Subprojects relating to urban transport will focus on infrastructure that \ncan directly stimulate local economic activities. In addition to improving key roads, bus and truck \nterminals, and other facilities, a pilot program will be carried out to introduce modern traffic \nmanagement,  such  as  control  of  roadside  parking,  improvement  of  sidewalks,  and  use  of \nsignals to boost traffic flow and provide a safer environment for pedestrians. \n \n15.  Drainage.  Subprojects  relating  to  drainage  will  rehabilitate  or  extend  drainage  and \nassociated facilities to reduce floods and water logging. This will be accompanied by an initiative \nto  improve  collection  and  disposal  of  solid  waste,  and/or  an  awareness  campaign  on  the \nhazards of dumping solid waste into drains. \n \n16.  Urban revitalization. The project will support a small-scale pilot program to revitalize an \ninner-city area of historic importance and to stimulate local economic activities. This will include \nupgrading  and  relocating  public  infrastructure,  and  restoring  public  buildings  of  historic \nimportance. The pilot program will assess detailed implementation and financial requirements \nfor an eventual expansion via private sector participation. \n \n2.  Output 2: Improved Urban Planning \n \n17.  The  project  will  support  the  review  and  update  of  urban  development  plans  and \nformulate a framework for coherent regional development. The current DMDP (1995\u20132015) will \nbe  updated  for  the  period  of  2016\u20132035  in  order  to  reflect  the  continued  socioeconomic \ndevelopment of the Dhaka city region. Development plans for pourashavas will be prepared \nand/or updated to ensure consistency with the DMDP. The review will put particular emphasis \non  protecting  the  urban  environment,  taking  into  account  the  impacts  of  urbanization  and \nindustrial activities on water bodies. The subprojects to be supported under the project will be \nprioritized  and  designed  along  the  framework  of  the  DMDP  to  ensure  coherent  regional \ndevelopment. To help realize the DMDP, the project will support feasibility studies for future \nprojects, including one for a satellite town. Extensive public consultations will ensure public \nparticipation in developing the DMDP and feasibility studies. RAJUK will be responsible for \nupdating  the  DMDP  in  collaboration  with  urban  planners  from  the  Dhaka  city  region\u2019s \nmunicipalities.  The  joint  exercise  will  nurture  a  culture  of  collaboration  between  planning \nagencies and municipalities. \n                                                 \n14 Typically, nongovernment organizations and CBOs recover the costs through collection fees and do not need \nmunicipal subsidies. The project will support introduction of better contractual agreements and selection processes. \n ", "5 \n \n3.  Output 3: Strengthened Municipal Management and Capacity \n \n18.  The  project  will  support  municipal  capacity  building  in  the  areas  of  property  tax \ncollection, public participation, and urban planning. Public participation will be ensured through \ncitizens\u2019 committees with broad representation, including women and the poor. The program will \nbuild on lessons learned from the UGIIP\u2014that effective improvement of municipal management \nis best achieved when capacity development programs are combined with rigorous performance \nmonitoring and performance-based fund allocation. The capacity development programs will be \naligned with activities to meet the performance criteria.  \n \n19.  Pourashavas that were covered by the UGIIP have developed sufficient capacity in core \nareas, and the capacity development program will focus on sustaining these achievements. It \nwill boost capacity in other areas such as tax assessment, human resource management, \npublic\u2013private partnerships, and energy efficiency. Pourashavas that were not covered by the \nUGIIP will start with core training programs established under the UGIIP, such as tax collection, \ncitizen participation, and urban planning. City corporations and urban centers will start with a \npilot program in selected areas. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n20.  The project is estimated to cost $170.00 million.

It will (i) review the current legal and institutional frameworks of \nregional  planning  and  governance,  particularly  the  Town  Improvement  Act  (1953);  and \n(ii) propose measures to streamline and strengthen the framework by revisiting mandate and \nfunctions  of  RAJUK,  and  rationalize  the  system  by  allocating  planning  and  control \nresponsibilities to the proper levels. ADB will administer the TA. The total cost of the TA is \nestimated  at  $750,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide  a  $675,000  grant  from  its  Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-IV) and the government will make in-kind contribution to cover \nthe balance. RAJUK will be the executing agency for the TA and provide counterpart staff and \noffice space. A consulting firm will be engaged to implement the TA, through the quality- and \ncost-based  selection  method  with  a  standard  80:20  scoring  weight.  The  outline  terms  of \nreference is described in the PAM. \n \nB.  Energy Efficiency Improvement \n25.  The  TA  will  (i)  promote  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  programs  among \nmunicipalities, and (ii) carry out detailed energy audits and implement demonstration programs \nto introduce energy-efficient water pumps and solar-powered streetlights. The results will be \nsummarized in a best practice manual, including technical specifications, saved energy and \nCO , better street safety, impact of lower energy costs on municipal finances, and increased \n2\nproperty tax as a result of additional streetlights. The best practice manual will be used in \nawareness campaigns and capacity development, so that the program can be expanded under \nthe project or through other fund sources. ADB will administer the TA. The total cost of the TA is \nestimated at $1,700,000 equivalent, of which $1,500,000 will be financed by the Asian Clean \nEnergy Fund15 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, and administered by \nADB. The government will make in-kind contributions to cover the balance. LGED will be the \nexecuting agency and provide counterpart staff and office space to the consultant team. The \nDepartment of Public Health Engineering will provide technical support for the introduction of \nenergy-efficient water pumps. A consulting firm will be engaged for the implementation of the \nTA, through the quality- and cost-based selection method with a standard 80:20 scoring weight. \nThe outline terms of reference is described in the PAM. \n \n \n                                                 \n15 Established by the Government of Japan. \n ", "8 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n26.  Economic analysis. The economic analysis is conducted for sample subprojects. The \nestimates  of  the  economic  internal  rates  of  return  range  from  20.0%  to  52.9%,  indicating \nsufficiently high economic return. The result is robust against downside risks, including higher \ncapital cost, increased operation and maintenance (O&M) cost, decreased benefits, and delays \nin project completion. The result most likely underestimates the benefits, since the projects have \nother benefits that are not easily quantifiable and are not accounted for in the analysis.   \n \n27.  Financial analysis. For revenue-generating subprojects, financial analysis is conducted \nby estimating the incremental costs and the revenues over the project\u2019s life. The estimated \nfinancial internal rates of return range from 2.5% to 7.9% and compare favorably with the \nweighted average cost of capital estimated at 0.9%. Sensitivity analysis with respect to changes \nin cost and revenue assumptions confirms the financial viability and the robustness against \nthese downside risks. The assessment of water-supply subprojects shows that an affordable \ntariff can recover O&M costs and debt service.16 For nonrevenue-generating subprojects, the \nanalysis focuses on the municipalities' financial capacity to meet the recurrent costs of operating \nand maintaining the developed physical assets in a sustainable manner. The overall financial \nposition of each pourashava is projected, reflecting the incremental capital, O&M expenditures, \nrevenue through user charges, and debt service. The projected financial position confirms their \nfinancial capacity to meet O&M costs and other requirements to sustain facilities developed \nunder the project.   \n \nB.  Governance \n28.  The  LGED  and  most  implementing  agencies  have  experience  in  managing  ADB \nprojects, and staff were trained under those projects. The project will provide further training to \nstrengthen  their  capacity,  including  financial  management,  procurement,  and  safeguard \nmeasures. Financial management assessments concluded that the LGED\u2019s and implementing \nagencies\u2019  financial  management  systems  are  satisfactory,  with  adequate  procedures  and \nstandard  of  fund  flow,  accounting,  reporting,  and  audit.  The  capacity  of  the  LGED  and \nimplementing agencies to carry out proper procurement has been assessed as satisfactory. The \nLGED  and  most  implementing  agencies  have  procurement  experience  in  accordance  with \nADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time), and their performance so \nfar  has  been  satisfactory.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n29.  Citizen participation. Major social issues in pourashavas include weak participation \nand representation of citizens\u2014particularly the poor and women\u2014in pourashava management. \nThe UGIIP strengthened citizen participation through the formation of citizens\u2019 committees with \nbroad representation. The project will build on the UGIIP, and holding regular meetings of \ncitizens\u2019 committees will be one of the performance criteria for funding. Municipal management, \nincluding selection and design of subprojects as well as urban planning, will be discussed at the \ncitizens\u2019 committees to ensure broad public participation. \n                                                 \n16 Revenue-generating subprojects, including water-supply subprojects, will be funded by 50% grant and 50% loan. \nThe loan will have a 4% interest rate with a 20-year repayment period and a 5-year grace period. \n ", "9 \n \n30.  Gender. A gender action plan has been developed for the project. The project will help \nreduce gender inequality by ensuring that women\u2019s participation in pourashava management \nthrough  citizens\u2019  committees  and  consultations  on  urban  planning  reaches  at  least  30%. \nWomen will have equal opportunity to participate in project-supported training programs. Efforts \nto reduce wage inequality between men and women, and ensure core labor standards will be in \nplace. Awareness-raising campaigns will include women, and they will also be involved in water \nuser groups and CBOs for solid-waste management. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n31.  Environmental safeguards. The project is classified as category B in accordance with \nADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  LGED  prepared  initial  environmental \nexaminations of sample subprojects, including environmental management plans (EMPs). The \ninitial environmental examinations, which will be updated during detailed design, conclude that \nno significant adverse environmental impacts are anticipated and that the subprojects would \nhave only small, localized impacts to be mitigated through measures outlined in the EMPs. The \nEMPs  will  be  implemented  by  the  PIUs  and  monitored  by  the  PMCU.  Implementation \narrangements  ensure  that  the  PMCU  and  PIUs  have  adequate  capacity  to  manage \nenvironmental impacts through consultants\u2019 support and capacity building. An environmental \nassessment and review framework was also prepared to guide environmental assessment in \nsubsequent  subprojects.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  outlines \nrequirements  for  project  screening,  classification,  environmental  criteria  for  selection  of \nsubprojects, information disclosure, consultation, environmental assessment, development and \nimplementation of an EMP, and monitoring and reporting. Improvements to sanitation, solid-\nwaste management, drainage, and roads will have significant positive environmental impacts in \nthese municipalities.  \n \n32.  Social safeguards. The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement \nand category C for indigenous peoples in accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement. \nInvoluntary resettlement impacts are not considered significant. Most land parcels are owned by \nlocal governments; however, some subprojects require minor land acquisition and involuntary \nresettlement involving either physical or economic displacement, or temporary restrictions to \nland  use.  Draft  resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  for  sample  subprojects  to  ensure \ncompliance with the government's and ADB's policy requirements, and to provide entitlements \nfor  affected  persons,  including  special  assistance  measures  for  vulnerable  groups.  A \nresettlement framework has been prepared for future subprojects that details screening and \ncategorization, assessment, planning, institutional arrangements and processes to be followed. \nThe PMCU will ensure that the PIUs will update the resettlement plans during the detailed \ndesign stage, if required, and implement the final resettlement plans. Considering the urban \nlocations of these subprojects, no impacts on indigenous peoples are expected. Implementation \narrangements ensure that the PMCU and PIUs have adequate capacity to manage social \nimpacts through consultants\u2019 support and capacity building. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. Risks are relatively low \nand mitigated to a manageable level. The benefits and impacts of the project are expected to \noutweigh the costs and risks. \n \n \n \n \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nIneffective coordination  A  steering  committee  will  be  established  with  stakeholders  in  central \nbetween the LGED  government and municipalities. Consultation will continue during project \n(executing agency) and  implementation.  Review  and  update  of  the  DMDP  will  strengthen \nimplementing agencies  coordination in selecting subprojects for coherent regional development.  \nInadequate capacity of  Need for additional staff is identified and the government assured early \nimplementing agencies  assignment. Adequate staffing of the implementing agency is one of the \nperformance criteria before subprojects can start. Some staff were trained \nunder the previous project, and those who do not have adequate capacity \nwill be trained under the project. \nRapid urban growth  The subprojects in the initial phase will address immediate needs, and the \nbeyond expectation  updated DMDP will facilitate identification and prioritization of subsequent \nsubprojects. \nSustainability of  Many  municipalities  have  improved  local  tax  collection  through  the \nsubprojects undermined  previous project, and the proposed project will expand the program to new \nby constrained financial  municipalities. The proposed user charges were found affordable, and \nresources  further consultations will be held before introducing new charges.  \nLack of interest in  Small-scale demonstration programs will be implemented and documented \nwidening innovative  to  clarify  benefits  for  municipalities,  followed  by  public  awareness \nsubprojects  programs. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DMDP = Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan, LGED = Local Government \nEngineering Department. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n34.  The government and the LGED have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in the \nPAM and loan documents. The government and the LGED have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement. As conditions to the \ndisbursement, the government will (i) establish the interministerial steering committee and the \nPMCU, and (ii) appoint the project director and the deputy project directors for the PMCU. \n \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR76,894,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the City \nRegion Development Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n20 October 2010\n ", "  Appendix 1         11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n    Data Sources and/or  Assumptions and \nDesign  Performance Targets with Baseline  Reporting  Risks \nSummary  Indicators  Mechanisms \n      Assumption \nImpact    (Targets are average of the target areas by \nInvestment climate  Realization of other \n  2015, unless otherwise noted.) \nsurvey  development projects \nEnhanced growth  Improved investment climate and expansion \nDirectorate General of  in line with DMDP   \npotential and  of local business (10% of annual growth of \nHealth Services  \nenvironmental  employment)  Risk \nsustainability  Reduction of water-related diseases (20%  Project completion  Stability of local \nreduction  of  malaria  incidence  from  0.63  report by LGED  environment  \nincidence /1000 population by 2020) \nOutcome  (Targets are total or average of the target  Quarterly progress  Assumptions \n  areas by 2015, unless otherwise noted.)  reports by PMCU  Subprojects are \nImproved urban  Water supply   Quarterly progress  designed and \nenvironment and  Share of population with access to improved  reports by PIUs  implemented. \ninfrastructure  water supply (from 35% to 60%)  Results of citizen   \nservices based  Sanitation  perception survey  Municipalities \non effective  Share of wastewater treated properly (from  reports  generate sufficient \nregional and  5% to 40%)     and sustained \nurban planning  Share of population with access to improved  revenue for O&M. \nsanitation facilities (from 5% to 40%)    \nSolid waste management  Speed and direction \nShare of solid waste disposed properly  of urban growth is \n(from 20% to 70%)   not too different from \nShare of population with access to improved  the projection in the \nsolid-waste management (from 20% to  design stage. \n70%)    \nUrban transport  Risks \nIncidence of traffic accidents (30%  Skilled staff is not \nreduction, including those involving women  recruited or retained \nand children)  in municipalities. \nDrainage  Tariff and charges \nIncidence of serious water logging and  required for O&M are \nfloods (30% reduction)  not affordable or \nEnergy efficiency  socially acceptable. \nSaved energy (2,000 MW per year)   \nSaved energy costs (30% reduction)  \nAdditional property tax revenues due to \nadditional streetlights (25% increase) \nUrban planning \nUpdated Dhaka Metropolitan Development \nPlan implemented from 2013 \nMunicipal management \nNumber of pourashavas in compliance with \nkey UGIAP activities (all pourashavas) \nOutputs   (Targets are total or average of the target  Quarterly progress  Assumption \n  areas by 2015, unless otherwise noted.)  reports by PMCU  Capacity of PIUs is \n1.
