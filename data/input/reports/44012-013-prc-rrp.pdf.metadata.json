By  the  end  of  2010,  the  primary  energy \ndemand  in  the  PRC  increased  to  more  than  3,050  million  tons  of  standard  coal  equivalent \n(mtce),  compared  with  1,390  mtce  in  2000.  The  PRC  relies  heavily  on  carbon-intensive  coal, \nwhich  provided  about  70%  of  its  primary  energy  in  2010.4 The  Government  of  the  PRC  has \nrecognized  the  challenges  posed  by  the  rapid  rise  in  energy  consumption  and  associated \nemissions. It has committed to achieve 40%\u201345% carbon intensity reduction by 2020 compared \nwith  2005,  primarily  by  targeting  energy  intensity  reductions.5 During  the  Eleventh  Five-Year \nPlan, 2006\u20132010, the energy intensity was reduced by 19.06% compared with a target of 20%. \nThe  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  has  set  a  target  of  a  further  16%  energy  intensity \nreduction.    \n \nMore than three fourths of the PRC\u2019s electricity and about half of its primary energy are \n4. \nconsumed by the industrial sector. The \u201c1,000 Key Enterprises Program\u201d was launched during \nthe Eleventh plan to target the 1,000 most energy-intensive enterprises, which consumed about \ntwo-thirds  of  the  total  industrial  energy  consumption.  During  the  Twelfth  plan,  the  ongoing \nprogram will be extended to cover all industrial enterprises with annual energy consumption of \n10,000  tons  of  coal  equivalent  (tce)  and  higher.  It  will  involve  some  16,000  enterprises  in  the \ncountry,  primarily  among  nine  energy-intensive  industries,  including  iron  and  steel,  nonferrous \nmetal,  coal,  power  generation,  petrochemicals,  chemicals,  building  materials,  textile,  and  pulp \nand paper. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2011.  Technical \nAssistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Hebei Energy Efficiency Improvement and Emission \nReduction Project. Manila (TA 7788-PRC, approved on 15 March for $700,000). \n\n2  The provincial capacity development will be achieved through a proposed technical assistance grant to be financed \nby  the  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF).  The  GEF  project  identification  form  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments  in  Appendix  2)  has  been  endorsed  by  the  GEF  chief  executive  officer  for  submission  in  November \n2011. \n\n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n4  China Statistics Press. 2010. China Energy Statistical Year Book. Beijing. \n5  Carbon  intensity  is  the  amount  of  carbon  by  weight  emitted  per  unit  of  energy  consumed.  It  is  also  commonly \nreferred as greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP). Energy intensity is a measure of \nthe  energy  efficiency  of  a  nation\u2019s  economy.  It  is  calculated  as  units  of  energy  per  unit  of  GDP.  In  the  PRC,  the \nenergy intensity is generally measured as the amount of energy consumed in tce per CNY10,000 GDP.  \n\n\f2 \n \n\nHebei  Province  ranks  second  in  energy  consumption  among  all  the  provinces,  with  a \n5. \ntotal energy consumption of 267 mtce in 2010, or 8.7% of the national consumption. During the \nEleventh plan,  Hebei\u2019s  energy  intensity  reduced  by  20.11%  to  1.58  tce,  which  is  still  much \nhigher  than  the  national  average  of  1.034  tce.  This  is  mainly  due  to  the  presence  of  many \nenergy-intensive industries, such as iron and steel, electricity and heat production, cement, and \npetroleum  and  petrochemical.6 Most  of  these  industrial  plants  operate  at  much  lower  energy \nefficiency  levels  than  international  best  practice  as  a  result  of  underinvestment  in  energy \nefficiency.7 Hebei has set a target of a further 17% energy intensity reduction during the Twelfth \nplan, which will be challenging unless targeted investments are significantly scaled up in these \nenergy-intensive industrial plants.  \n \n6. \nThe key barriers for energy efficiency investments are (i) lack of familiarity with the latest \nenergy  efficient  technologies,  combined  with  the  enterprises\u2019  perception  of  production \ninterruptions and/or loss of revenues; (ii) difficulties for commercial banks to assess cash flow \nbenefits  and  forgo  collateral  for  such  investment  projects,  which  do  not  generate  additional \nrevenues; and (iii) lack of capacity for evaluation and risk assignments for energy conservation \ninvestments  by  commercial  banks,  thereby  limiting  debt  financing.  Limited  market-based \nincentive mechanisms to reward investors for reducing emissions through energy efficiency also \ndiscourage investors. These market imperfections warrant targeted public interventions.  \n \nSeveral measures have been adopted in designing this project to address these barriers. \n7. \nAccordingly,  the  FIL  modality  was  chosen  to  (i)  allow  multiple  turnover  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) loan, thus providing larger investments for energy efficiency over the \nloan  tenor;  (ii)  build  the  knowledge  and  capacity  of  the  provincial  government  and  selected \nfinancial  intermediary  in  evaluation  and  risk  assignments  for  energy  efficiency  transactions; \n(iii) reduce transaction complexities and costs owing to familiarity and experience gained by the \nproject management office (PMO) and the financial intermediary from the initial subprojects; and \n(iv) enhance governance and improve safeguard compliance for energy efficiency investments \nbeyond the first batch of subprojects.   \n \nThe  ESCOs8 have  been  developing  slowly  since  2000  in  Hebei  Province.  Most  of  the \n8. \nexisting ESCOs in Hebei Province have limited registered capital, assets, and employees. The \nESCOs  are  unable  to  obtain  commercial  debt  financing  because  of  the  banks\u2019  perception  of \nrisks  and  the  lack  of  meaningful  collateral,  which  limits  their  involvement  to  only  small-scale \nenergy  efficiency  projects  with  limited  investment  and  short  paybacks.  The  proposed  project \naddresses this barrier by including an ESCO in the project design.  \n \n9. \nThe  project  design  also  includes  the  participation  of  a  joint  stock  commercial  bank \n(Huaxia Bank) as a financial intermediary to address key capacity and related issues (para. 6), \nwhich  will  catalyze  more  commercial  bank  financing  in  next  batches  of  energy  efficiency \ninvestments in the  industrial  sector. This FIL  approach  is  similar  to  previous  ADB  loans  for  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n6  A total of 112 enterprises from Hebei were included in the national \u201c1,000 Key Enterprises Program,\u201d\u2013 a program to \ntarget top 1,000 enterprises that consume about two-thirds of the industrial energy consumption.  An additional 109 \nenterprises from Hebei have annual energy consumption higher than 100,000 tce.   \n\n7  The  underinvestment  arises  because  of  limited  commercial  debt  financing  available  to  these  energy  efficiency \n\ninvestments.  \n\n8  The  ESCO  makes  energy  efficiency  investments  in  host  facilities  owned  by  third  parties  (host  companies).  The \nESCO  enters  into  an  energy  savings  performance  contract  with  the  host  company  and  will  be  paid  by  the  host \ncompany according to the verified energy savings achieved.    \n\n\f \nenergy-intensive  provinces  of  Guangdong 9  and  Shandong. 10  The  financial  intermediary  has \nbeen selected pursuant to a transparent and competitive process, and the onlending terms have \nbeen proposed in a manner consistent with the prevailing commercial banking practices to avoid \nmarket  distortions.  Prior  experience  in  financing  energy  efficiency  projects  and  participation  in \nother international financial institution funded projects was one of the key criteria in selecting the \nfinancial intermediary. \n \nThe lessons learned from previous ADB\u2019s energy efficiency projects in PRC have been \n10. \ntaken  into  account,  especially  with  respect  to  the  selection  of  a  commercial  bank  as  financial \nintermediary  through  a  competitive  process  and  its  capacity  development  which  can  support \nadditional  efforts  to  mobilize  commercial  bank  financing  to  the  energy  efficiency  sector.  The \npossibility of establishing a credit guarantee facility using the cash accumulated caused by the \ninterest  difference  between  the  ADB  lending  rate  and  subloan  interest  rates  will  also  be \nexplored  during  project  implementation.  A  complementary  grant  to  be  financed  by  the  Global \nEnvironment  Facility  is  under  preparation  to  address  the  broader  capacity  issues  in  the \ncommercial banking sector for energy efficiency financing (footnote 2). The scope of the grant-\nfinanced activities include (i) energy efficiency and emission reduction technology identification, \ndissemination, and design of market-based policy incentives; (ii) capacity building of commercial \nbanks  in  Hebei  Province  on  energy  efficiency  project  appraisal,  including  pilot  testing  of  the \ncredit  guarantee  facility  for  ESCO  implemented  projects;  and  (iii)  capacity  building  of  ESCO \nindustry, and monitoring and verification agents in Hebei Province.  \n \nThe  project  is  closely  aligned  with  Strategy  2020,11 which  identifies  moving  developing \n11. \nmember countries onto a low-carbon growth path by improving energy efficiency as one of the \nkey means of achieving environmentally sustainable growth.12 The country partnership strategy, \n2008\u20132010 13  and  country  operations  business  plan,  2011\u20132013, 14  identifies  environmental \nsustainability  as  one  of  the  three  pillars  of  ADB  assistance  to  the  PRC.  Consistent  with  the \nStrategy 2020 goals, the project encourages private sector investments. In the first batch, seven \nof the eight selected subprojects are private enterprises. The emphasis on selecting innovative \ntechnologies, in the selection of the first batch of subprojects, is expected to be maintained and \nintensified for future subprojects. The project design includes measures (para. 20) for leveraging \nadditional private investments.  \n \nB. \n \nThe impact of the project is improved energy efficiency and emission reduction in Hebei \n12. \nProvince.  The  outcome  of  the  project  is  increased  investments  in  energy  efficiency  in  Hebei \nProvince. \n \n\n  \nImpact and Outcome \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB.  2008.

The ADB loan proceeds \nwill be provided to eligible energy efficiency projects through Hebei Provincial Finance Bureau \n(HFB)  and  the  selected  financial  intermediary.  The  subprojects  are  expected  to  have  a  loan \nrepayment period of 5 years including the grace period. The repayment of subloans, from these \nsubprojects, will be revolved by relending to future batches of energy efficiency subprojects. The \nfirst batch of subprojects, consisting of industrial energy efficiency projects (component 1) and \nESCO projects (component 2), are described in paras. 14 and 15. Subsequent batches will be \nselected in accordance with the selection criteria mentioned in the project administration manual \n(PAM). 15 All subprojects approved before the loan closing are subject to receiving no objection \nfrom ADB.  \n \n \n14. \nComponent  1:  Implement  industrial  energy  efficiency  Projects.  This  component \nincludes eight demonstration industrial energy efficiency subprojects that have high potential for \nenergy  and  carbon  emission  savings.  These  subprojects  include  innovative  technologies  and \napproaches  with  very  good  replication  possibilities  in  energy-intensive  industrial  sectors  in \nHebei  Province,  such  as  (i)  coke  dry  quenching,  which  substantially  reduces  the  emission  of \nharmful industrial gases and enables the recovery of waste heat in producing coke;16 (ii) waste \nheat  recovery  from  industrial  plants  to  generate  electricity;  (iii)  improving  furnace  control \nsystems and energy management systems in the steel industry; and (iv) replacing boilers and \nmotors with more efficient units. All except one of the subborrowers are privately owned. These \nsubprojects  combined  are  estimated  to  result  in  annual  energy  savings  of  236,463  tce  and \nannual carbon dioxide savings of more than 603,329 tons (t).  \n \n15. \nComponent  2:  Implement  energy  service  company  projects.  This  component  will \ndemonstrate the commercial debt financing of energy efficiency projects developed by ESCOs. \nThe  first  batch  includes  an  ESCO  engaged  in  installing  solar  thermal  water  heaters  on \ncommercial  and  office  buildings  based  on  energy  savings  performance  contracts  (footnote  8). \nBased on the experiences gained in financing this ESCO subproject, the possibility of setting up \na risk sharing (guarantee) mechanism to scale up the ESCO industry in Hebei Province will be \nundertaken  during  the  project\u2019s  implementation.  The  ESCO  project  will  result  in  estimated \nannual energy savings of 29,700 tce and carbon dioxide savings of 65,340 t. \n \nD. \n \n16. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  help  finance  the  project.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  12  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The \ngovernment  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that \nthese  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication  or  advice  from  ADB.  The  longer  grace  period  is  essential  to  ensure  the  loan \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n                                                 \n15 Details  are  in  Appendix  2  of  the  Project  Administration  Manual  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n16 Coke is one of the key inputs for steel making. \n\n\fproceeds are available for relending several times to a greater number of industries, resulting in \nincreased energy savings and emissions reduction.  \n \n17. \nestimates for subsequent batches is provisional at this stage.  \n \n\nThe cost estimates for the first batch of energy efficiency projects is in Table 1.

The Asian Development Bank will finance $13 million of taxes and \nduties. This is not considered to be excessive and is in compliance with the country cost-sharing ceiling and \nfinancing parameters for the People\u2019s Republic of China, approved on 17 March 2011.  \n\n    Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n18. \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  using  the  FIL  modality.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will \nrelend  the  ADB  loan  proceeds  to  Hebei  provincial  government  (HPG)  on  the  same  terms  and \nconditions  as  the  loan  between  ADB  and  the  PRC.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  onlent  to  the \nsubborrowers by HPG through the selected financial intermediary (Huaxia Bank). HFB will issue \nfund  management  regulations,  clearly  laying  out  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  HFB,  PMO, \nand Huaxia Bank with respect to the management of the ADB loan proceeds.  \n \nHFB,  the  financial  intermediary,  subborrowers,  and  the  guarantors  of  subloans,  if  any, \n19. \nwill enter into subloan agreements with respect to the subprojects. The onlending interest rate \non subproject loans will be the higher of (i) the interest rate payable by HPG to the Ministry of \nFinance, and (ii) 90% of the prime rate set by the People\u2019s Bank of China for commercial bank \nloans having the same terms as the subloans. The proposed onlending rate does not provide a \nsignificant subsidy over the market rates but will provide an incentive for subborrowers to invest \nin energy efficiency investments. HFB will bear the risks of currency exchange and interest rate \nfluctuations. \n \n20. \nFor the first batch, the subloan amounts will be up to 75% of the investment cost of each \nsubproject.  For  subsequent  batches,  financing  from  revolved  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be \nreduced to 50% of the  investment  cost to encourage an increased share of cofinancing either \nthrough  increased  equity  financing  or  commercial  bank  financing.  It  is  expected  that  the  ADB \nloan proceeds will be fully revolved  at least two times during the loan tenor, which will enable \nadditional  lending  of  $200  million  and  total  investments  of  $400  million  for  future  subprojects. \nThe financing plan of the project is in Table 2. \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\n \nSource \nA.

HPG has established the project \nsteering committee (PSC), which will provide direction to the overall project implementation. The \nPSC  secretariat,  set  up  under  the  PSC,  has  specific  responsibilities  related  to  the  project \nimplementation. The PMO is established under the PSC secretariat to act as the implementing \nagency  and  it  is  managed  administratively  by  Hebei  Power  Demand  Side  Management  and \nInstruction  Center,  an  agency  under  Hebei  Development  and  Reform  Commission.  The  PMO \nwill  enter  into  subproject  agreements  with  each  of  the  subborrowers  with  respect  to  the \nsubproject implementation.  The  implementation arrangements  are  summarized  in Table  3  and \ndescribed in detail in the PAM.17  \n\n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\n \nAspects  \nLoan implementation period \nEstimated completion date \nProject implementation perioda \nManagement \n(i) \n\nOversight body \n\nArrangements\n\nJanuary 2012\u2013December 2016 \n30 June 2017 \nJanuary 2012\u2013December 2027 \n \nThe  project  steering  committee  is  headed  by  the  vice  governor  of  Hebei \nProvince,  together  with  the  vice  secretary  general  of  the  government  of \nHebei  Province  and  deputy  director  general  of  HDRC,  and  consists  of \n13 senior  officials  (mostly  deputy  director  general  level)  of  relevant \nprovincial departments and authorities. \n\n                                                 \n17 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fAspects  \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nExecuting agency \nKey implementing agencies \n\n \n\n(iv)  \n\nImplementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\n \nRetroactive financing and/or advance \ncontracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nArrangements\n\n(iii) \n\nHebei provincial government \nThe  PMO  is  responsible  for  project  implementation.

It is proposed \nto have five full-time staff. \n \nInternational \n2 contracts \ncompetitive bidding \n \nNational competitive \n26 contracts \nbidding \nShopping \n2 contract packages \nAll  subborrowers,  under  component  1,  intend  to  use  advance  contracting. \nOne  of  the  subborrowers  (Hebei  Fengmei)  is  likely  to  utilize  retroactive \nfinancing  for  several  contract  packages  for  equipment  supply  and  civil \nworks.  Retroactive  financing  will  be  considered  subject  to  the  following \nconditions:  (i)  the  expenses  are  incurred  within  6  months  of  the  signing  of \nADB  loan  agreement,  and  (ii)  the  amount  of  retroactive  financing  does  not \nexceed  20%  of  the  total  ADB  loan  amount.  The  government  has  been \ninformed  that  provision  of  advance  contracting  and  procurement  and \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the subprojects. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements  agreed  upon  between  the  government  and  ADB.

The  due  diligence  on \nfinancial  management  of \nsubborrowers, 22  financial  intermediary, 23  and  procurement  capacity  assessment 24  has  been \nseparately undertaken and is provided in supplementary documents. The due diligence on the \nsubsequent batches of subprojects, to be financed by the REF, will be undertaken by the PMO \nto ensure compliance with the subproject selection criteria (footnote 15).  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n18 Appendix 1 of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Initial Environmental Examination for the First Batch of Subprojects (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\n20 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Financial Performance and Financial Management Assessment of Subproject Companies (accessible from the list \n\nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n23 Financial Management Assessment of Huaxia Bank (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Procurement  Capacity  Assessment  and  Procurement  Plan  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nA. \n \n23. \nThe  technical  due  diligence  of  identified  subprojects,  under  components  1  and  2, \nconfirmed that they are using innovative but proven technologies. The subborrowers\u2019 capacity to \nimplement  the  subproject  has  been  assessed  during  project  preparation  and  found  to  be \nadequate and the associated implementation risks are minimal. These subprojects will result in \nestimated energy savings of 266,163 tce/year [y]) and greenhouse gas savings of 668,669 tons \nper year.  \n \nB. \n \n24. \nFinancial analysis. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and financial net present \nvalue were computed for each of the identified eight subprojects under component 1. The FIRR \nfor  each  of  the  subprojects  exceeds  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  and  ranges  from \n16.7% to 33.8%. The combined FIRR for component 1 is 22.7% and for component 2 is 19.9%, \ncompared with the combined weighted average cost of capital of 6.0%.  \n \nEconomic  analysis. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR), from eight individual \n25. \nsubprojects  under  component  1,  varies  from  18.7%  to  46.5%  without  the  environmental \nbenefits.  The  combined  EIRR  of  component  1  is  28.1%  without  environmental  benefits;  it \nincreases to 32.6% with the environmental benefits. The EIRR of component 2 is 28.5% without \nthe environmental benefits and 32.5% with environmental benefits.   \n \nC. \n \nThe  financial  management  capacity  of  the  subborrowers  and  the  financial  intermediary \n26. \nhas been assessed and found to be adequate to ensure the loan funds are utilized for intended \npurposes.  The  subborrowers  are  responsible  for  undertaking  the  procurement  of  goods  and \nservices  and  the  PMO  is  responsible  for  reviewing  and  approving  procurement  activities \nundertaken by subborrowers subject to the thresholds mentioned in the procurement plan25 and \nin accordance with the procurement manual.26 The PMO\u2019s capacity to oversee the procurement \nprocedures adopted by subborrowers will be strengthened during loan implementation. The loan \ndisbursement procedures have been prepared to ensure that subloan disbursements are linked \nto the payments of eligible expenses.  \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  HPG,  the  financial  intermediary,  and  subborrowers.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n\nGovernance \n\n \nPoverty and Social  \n\nD. \n \n28. \nThe  PMO  will  ensure  the  relevant  labor  laws  and  occupational  health  and  safety \nstandards  are  complied  with  by  all  the  subborrowers.  The  occupational  health  and  safety \nprocedures  adopted  by  identified  subborrowers  and  their  compliance  with  relevant  domestic \nlaws  and  regulations  have  been  assessed  and  found  to  be  adequate.  Any  subproject  that \nresults  in  labor  retrenchment  and  redundancies  as  a  result  of  the  introduction  of  new \ntechnologies will not be included in the project. The subproject selection criteria ensure that the \nPMO  will  comply  with  this  requirement  for  future  subprojects.  The  due  diligence  on  possible \n\n                                                 \n25 Details  are  in  Appendix  5  of  the  Project  Administration  Manual  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\n26 Details  are  in  Appendix  4  of  the  Project  Administration  Manual  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nlabor retrenchment, in component 1 subprojects, found that affected workers will be redeployed \nwithin the same factory.  \n \nE. \n \n29. \nThe selection criteria explicitly exclude subprojects that have (i) environmental safeguard \ncategory  A,  (ii)  any  land  acquisition  or  demolition  of  dwellings,  and  (iii)  adverse  impacts  on \nindigenous peoples. The selected subprojects do not have any negative social impacts related \nto  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  categorized  as  financial \nintermediary  category  \u201cB\u201d  for  the  environment,  and  as  financial  intermediary  category  \u201cC\u201d  for \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009). Due diligence on subproject host facilities has been undertaken and found no \noutstanding  compliance  issues.  Individual  initial  environmental  examination  reports  were \nprepared  for  the  first  batch  of  subprojects  categorized  as  environment  category  B  and \nsummarized  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  (footnote  19).  The  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  will  be  monitored  by  the  PMO  and  annual  reports  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB.  \n \n30. \nAn  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS)  will  be  established  prior  to \nfirst  disbursement  to  meet  national  laws  and  ADB  environmental  and  social  safeguard \nrequirements for the FIL in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy  Statement.  The ESMS 27 \nhas  been  discussed  and  prepared  to  guide  the  PMO  in  the  implementation  of  the  ESMS, \nincluding the grievance redress mechanism. The ESMS clearly outlines the responsibility of the \nPMO and ADB, where applicable, with respect to safeguard screening, reviewing and approving \nthe \nenvironment  documents  of \nimplementation  of  safeguard  requirements  during  the  loan  implementation  period.  The \nsafeguard procedure to be followed by the PMO after the loan closure is also clearly described \nin the ESMS. The capacity building requirements of the PMO have been identified in the ESMS \nand will be strengthened during the loan implementation.    \n \nF. \n \nThere  are  no  major  outstanding  risks.  The  identified  risks  have  been  mitigated \n31. \nsubstantially  through  the  measures  incorporated  in  the  project  design.  The  major  risks  and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nfuture  subprojects,  and  monitoring  and  reporting  of \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nDiscontinuation of policies \nencouraging industrial \nenergy efficiency \ninvestments \n\nThe cofinancing from \ncommercial banks for \nsubborrowers may not be \nforthcoming \nThe lack of capacity at \nPMO to implement the \nESMS during subproject \n\nMitigating Measures\nThe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China is fully aware of the importance \nof energy efficiency improvement from a point of view of energy security, resource \nconservation, and adverse environmental impacts associated with high levels of \ncoal-based energy usage. The provincial government is committed to increase the \ncapacity and budget available for implementing incentive programs for promoting \nenergy efficiency. \nThe commercial banks, including the designated financial intermediary, will be more \ncomfortable in lending to energy efficiency projects after the successful \nimplementation of subprojects under component 1. The PMO will also undertake \ncapacity building for commercial banks on financing energy efficiency projects. \nThe PMO will be required to recruit a qualified environment and social safeguards \nmanager with responsibility for implementing the ESMS. The safeguards manager \nwill be provided with the required training and will be supported by the project \n\n                                                 \n27 Financial  Intermediary:  Environmental  and  Social  Management  System  Arrangement  (accessible  from  the  list  of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\nRisks \nselection and subproject \nimplementation \nESMS = environmental and social management system, PMO = project management office. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\npreparatory technical assistance consultants during the initial phase of project \nimplementation. \n\nMitigating Measures\n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n32. \nThe  government  and  the  HPG  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents.
