The project will also improve institutional capacity \nto provide sustainable WSS services. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nMacroeconomic context. Cambodia\u2019s population was estimated at 15.2 million in 2016, \nspread across  24 provinces,  26  cities,  and  numerous  district towns.2 While Cambodia remains \nalmost 80% rural, urbanization is accelerating and the urban population is expected to reach 30% \nof  the  national  total  by  2030.  This  urban  growth  has  been  centered  mostly  in  and  around  the \ncapital,  Phnom  Penh.  Since  2000,  provincial  cities  and  towns  have  been  impacted  by  the \nincreasing urbanization and have played an increasingly important role in the country\u2019s economy. \nThis  is  the  case  in the  cities  of  Battambang,  Kampong  Cham,  Siem  Reap,  and  Sihanoukville, \nwhich have grown to become important secondary cities, commercial and connectivity hubs, and \ntourism centers.3  Rapid economic development and urban migration in the cities highlighted the \nimportance of basic urban services, especially WSS, and the necessity to upgrade and expand \nthe infrastructure and improve service quality.  \n \n4. \nAccess to services. Countrywide, population access to improved water supply in urban \nareas (excluding Phnom Penh) is 69.7%, while access to piped water supply is low at only 42.2%. \nRapid expansion of the infrastructure is required to meet the government\u2019s 2025 target of 100% \naccess to potable water for the entire population. Access to improved sanitation in urban areas is \n80.2%,  while  access  to  sewerage  and  wastewater  treatment  is  only  10.7%;  a  large  proportion \n(69.3%)  have  individual  systems  (septic  tanks).  Open  defecation  in  urban  areas  remains \nunacceptably  high  at  17.3%. 4  The  low  sanitation  coverage  across  the  country  has  led  to \nwidespread pollution, affecting rivers, coastal areas, and tourist areas. Except for Phnom Penh, \nthe  government  has  not  been  able  to  invest  adequately  in  urban  WSS  since  the  mid-1990s \nresulting in significant service delivery gaps due to (i) inadequate funds for capital investment and \noperation, (ii) weak regulatory framework and sector planning, and (iii) weak institutional capacity \nto implement and provide sustainable services.5  \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Government of Cambodia. 2014. Cambodia Inter-Censal Survey (CHDS) 2014. Phnom Penh. \n3   Estimated  populations  in  2015:  Battambang  (257,600),  Kampong  Cham  (86,100),  Siem  Reap  (200,000),  and \n\nSihanoukville (78,250).  \n\n4   Improved urban water supply includes piped water to households, public tap and/or standpipe, bore holes, protected \nwells, and improved rainwater collection. Improved sanitation includes flush and/or pour flush to piped sewers, septic \ntanks, and pit latrines with slab. Government of Cambodia, Ministry of Planning. 2014.  Cambodia Socio-Economic \nSurvey. Phnom Penh (Tables 9 and 11). \n\n5   Urban water supply investments were mostly centered on Phnom Penh. The Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority is \n\nrecognized as one of the most efficient water utilities in Asia. Nationwide sanitation is lagging significantly. \n\n\f2  \n\n \n\nPolicy  framework.  Cambodia\u2019s  National  Water  and  Sanitation  Policy 6  laid  basic \n5. \nprinciples  for  urban  and  rural  WSS  service  delivery  in  the  country,  including  duties  and \nresponsibilities for planning and implementation, standards, oversight, and evaluation. For urban \nareas,  the  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  (NSDP),  2014\u20132018  provides  key  actions  for \nwater  supply,  but  actions  for  sanitation  are  not  well-defined.7 Consequently,  the  project  team \nprepared  a  draft  sanitation  roadmap 8  under  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  the \nsubsector\u2019s development.9  \n \nInstitutional arrangements. Responsibility for the WSS sector is fragmented, requiring \n6. \ncooperation among ministries and overcoming structural and organizational weaknesses. Urban \nwater supply falls under the responsibility of the Ministry of Industry and Handicraft (MIH), and \nservice delivery is entrusted to the provincial waterworks (PWWs) under provincial administation. \nThe Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) is responsible for urban sanitation, while the \nprovincial wastewater units (PWUs) under provincial administration are in charge of operation and \nmaintenance.  However,  the  PWWs  and  PWUs  have  limited  autonomy\u2014provincial  waterworks \noperate using their revenues from water tariffs while PWUs operate with limited revenues as the \nrecovery of sanitation tariffs is mixed with the provincial revenues. In late 2016, the government \nupgraded  the  Department  of  Potable  Water  Supply  of  MIH  to  a  general  department  to  better \nsupport  the  sector  with  increased  staffing  and  improved  organization  of  activities.  While  this \nchange  is  significant  for  sector  development,  capacity  development  and  training  is  required  to \nsupport  these  expanded  activities,  which  the  project  will  support.  The  government  created  a \ndedicated Department for Urban Sanitation at MPWT with similar needs. Recent and continuing \ngovernment reforms (para. 8) are transforming the sector and improving coordination between \nagencies, but additional support is needed to accelerate this work.  \n \n7. \nService  delivery  through  the  private  sector.  In  many  cities  and  towns,  small-scale \nprivate water operators have filled the gap, but these services generally only provide water to the \nmore profitable core areas of the town and many households remain unconnected, particularly \nthe  poor.10 However,  the  infrastructure,  water  quality,  and  service  standards  of  private  water \noperators remain poor and they lack the technical expertise and financial capacity to support any \nform of private sector development. Given the low participation levels by the private sector, MIH \ncontinues  to  expand  service  delivery  by  the  provincial  waterworks  where  there  is  significant \ndemand. \n \n8. \nSector reforms and improved financial performance. In 2014, MIH launched a sector \nreform  program  to  improve  urban  water  supply  services  and  the  financial  performance  of \n\n                                                \n6   Government of Cambodia. 2003. National Water and Sanitation Policy. Phnom Penh. \n7   Government of Cambodia. 2014. National Strategic Development Plan, 2014\u20132018. Phnom Penh. Key  actions for \nwater  supply  in  the  NSDP  are  (i)  development  of  a  legal  framework  for  urban  water  supply;  (ii)  promotion  of \ndecentralization  and  deconcentration;  (iii)  transfer  of  full autonomy  for  service  delivery  to  all  provincial public \nwaterworks;  (iv)  mobilization of urban  water  sector  financing;  (v) improvement of sector performance and public \naccess to safe, affordable, and sustainable water supplies; and (vi) improvement in the protection of water sources \nand enforcement of regulations.  \n\n8 The draft 20-year sanitation roadmap (expected to be adopted by 2020) provides directions on (i) tariff setting and \ncost recovery, (ii) subsidies to encourage increased uptake of sanitation, and (iii) city-wide sanitation planning and \nimplementation. It also presents common aims and standards for all departments of public works and transport to (i) \nreduce  the  differences  in  capacity,  (ii)  improve  planning  for  increased  sanitation  coverage,  and  (iii)  improve \ncoordination between the WSS subsectors. \n\n9 Technical assistance supported the development of prefeasibility studies and preliminary engineering designs for the \nproject  and  a  draft  sanitation  roadmap.  ADB.  2013.  Technical  Assistance  for  Supporting  the  Cities  Development \nInitiative for Asia. Manila.  \n\n10  Investment by the private sector has been hindered by the use of 3-year water licenses, limited access to finance, \nand poor capacity. In 2014, MIH issued a ministerial decree that provides more clarity about the licensing process \nand grants a 20-year license term for operators in a defined service area. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nprovincial waterworks, focusing on operational improvements and efficiency gains. The program \nis based on the reforms that made the Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority (PPWSA) one of the \nmost  efficient  water  utilities  in  Asia.11 The  government  introduced  minor  tariff  increases  where \nneeded,  as  the  law  only  permits  tariffs  adjustments  every  5  years.  Based  on  MIH\u2019s  reform \nprogram,  in  2017  (i)  all  provincial  waterworks  are  recording  positive  incomes,  (ii)  nonrevenue \nwater is mostly below 20%, and (iii) service quality has improved. Tariffs are now at sustainable \nlevels for financing operation and maintenance (O&M) but are insufficient to finance the capital \ncosts  required  for  system  expansion.  Support  for  capital  investments  to  expand  infrastructure \ncoverage  and  increase  the  customer  base  is  an  urgent  priority  for  the  MIH  and  is  crucial  for \nprovincial waterworks to achieve financial autonomy by 2019 in line with the NSDP, 2014\u20132018.  \n \n9. \nSupport  to  the  sanitation  subsector.  Although  the  sanitation  subsector  has  made \npositive steps in terms of coverage, overall, the wastewater (including collection and treatment) \nremains in the early stages of development. A new focus on sanitation has evolved through recent \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) urban development projects and good government support now \nexists  to  increase  sanitation  coverage,  enhance  sustainability  through  improving  revenues  for \nO&M, and reduce pollution of watercourses draining to the Tonle Sap lake and the sea.12 Piped \nsewer systems and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are present in only three provincial \ncities,13 and expansion is needed for the environmental and health benefits to be realized. For \nother cities and towns, like Kampong Cham, formal sanitation services are absent, and septage \nmanagement needs to be introduced as a first step in mainstreaming sanitation countrywide.  \n \n10. \nProject-specific  constraints.  Given  that  the  government\u2019s  ongoing  sector  reform  is \nshowing good results, the immediate demand is for capital investment to support the expansion \nof services. The project will support ongoing water supply and sanitation service improvement in \nkey economic growth centers that experience the following constraints:14 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nIn Battambang, the population with access to piped water supply is about 31% and \nto sewerage is about 5%. WWTP capacity is inadequate to treat the sewage. \nIn Kampong Cham, the population with access to piped water supply is about 37% \nand there is no access to a formal sanitation system.  \nIn Sihanoukville,  while other projects are expanding access to water supply, the \npopulation  with  access  to  sewerage  is  about  22%  but  WWTP  capacity  is \ninadequate and needs expansion together with the sewerage system.  \nIn Siem Reap, while other ongoing projects will  expand access to water supply, \nthe population with access to sewerage is about 50%. However, the trunk sewer \nis  structurally  and  hydraulically  inadequate,  resulting  in  pollution  of  local \nwatercourses. \n\n \n11. \nADB\u2019s  assistance  and  lessons  learned.  ADB  has  supported  the  urban  WSS  sector \nsince  1995,  starting  with  support  for  water  supply  improvements  in  Phnom  Penh.  The  project \nincorporates  lessons  learned  in  implementation:  (i)  improving  specifications  for  materials  and \nequipment  to  enhance  project  quality  and  sustainability;  (ii)  introducing  energy  efficiency \nmeasures to reduce O&M and capture carbon emissions; (iii) providing higher levels of project \nsupervision  to  improve  project  deliverable  quality;  (iv)  continuing provision  of  capacity  building \n                                                \n11 The success of PPWSA is characterized by strong and long-lasting leadership, autonomy to allow the freedom to \noperate  on  corporate  principles,  continuous  staff  development,  performance-based  bonus  system,  customer- \noriented  service,  high-quality  infrastructure  and  equipment,  and  a  strong  focus  on  nonrevenue  water  reduction, \nenergy efficiency, and expansion of coverage. \n\n12 Battambang, Kampong Cham, and Siem Reap are cities in the Tonle Sap basin whose drainage systems flow to the \n\nTonle Sap lake. Sihanoukville is the main coastal city where drainage systems discharge to the sea. \n13  Battambang, Siem Reap, and Sihanoukville\u2014all with support from previous ADB-financed projects. \n14  The  existing  situation  and  proposed  options  in  each  town  are  included  in  the  Pre-engineering  Design  Reports \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f4  \n\n \n\nsupport to improve sector sustainability; and (v) considering the use of design\u2013build contracts to \npromote design flexibility and expedite project delivery through private sector efficiency. \n \n12. \nDevelopment  coordination.  The  project  has  been  closely  designed  with  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency and the AFD, which are active in this sector. While the World \nBank  has  been  less  active,  coordination  continues  as  it  has  plans  to  re-enter  the  sector.  The \nJapan  International  Cooperation  Agency  is  working  in  numerous  provinces  to  increase  urban \nwater supply coverage in core areas, and is providing extensive capacity development support \nfor provincial waterworks. AFD is financing a new water treatment plant in Phnom Penh, and has \na parallel cofinanced project in Siem Reap for a water treatment plant to provide water for the \ndistribution zone financed by ADB.  \n \nStrategic context. The project is aligned with (i) phase 3 of the government\u2019s rectangular \n13. \nstrategy for growth, employment, equity, and efficiency;15 (ii) Cambodia\u2019s NSDP, 2014\u20132018; (iii) \nthe  action  plans  of  the  MIH  to  strengthen  the  management  of  publicly  owned  waterworks  and \nintegrate  urban  water  supply  with  urban  environmental  management;  and  (iv)  MPWT \nrequirements for improved and effective urban sanitation. The project is consistent with the three \npillars  of  the  ADB  country  partnership  strategy,  2014\u20132018  for  Cambodia  and  supports  ADB\u2019s \nWater Operational Plan and ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan.16  \n \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  ADB\u2019s  continued  assistance  to  the  government\u2019s \n14. \nsector  development  strategy  is  important  to  ensure  access  to  equitable  WSS  services  in \nCambodia\u2019s  towns  and cities.  It  will  provide  the  finance  and  capacity  development  required  to \nimplement the project as well as (i) incorporate high-level technologies addressing cost-effective \nwastewater  treatment,  energy  efficiency,  and  advanced  construction  techniques  (trenchless \nmethods  for  pipe  laying);  (ii)  use  design\u2013build  procurement  modalities  to  expedite  design  and \nconstruction  and  benefit  from  private  sector  experience  and  capacity;  (iii)  support  provincial \nwaterworks\u2019 progress toward financial autonomy by 2019 by expanding the customer base; and \n(iv) promote sustainability of the PWUs, through ring-fencing of revenues dedicated for O&M and \ndevelopment of a financially sustainable tariff policy. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n15. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: improved urban environments and quality \nof life for the urban residents. The project will have the following outcome: sustainable piped WSS \nservices provided in selected provincial cities. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n16. \nOutput  1:  Improved  piped  water  supply.  The  project  will  finance  two  water  supply \nsubprojects (in Battambang and Kampong Cham), including two new water treatment plants with \na combined capacity of 61,600 cubic meters per day (m3/day) and new distribution networks with \na combined length of 161 kilometers (km), which will also assist in reducing nonrevenue water. \nThe expanded systems will serve an additional 209,000 people (about 40,000 connections) by \n2022  (achieving  a  population  coverage  of  about  90%),  increasing  revenues  and  reducing  unit \ncosts through increased economies of scale. The project will assist the government to develop a \n\n                                                \n15 Government  of  Cambodia.  2013.

The project will finance four sanitation subprojects: (i) a \n17. \nnew 10,625 m3/day capacity WWTP at Battambang and 15.4 km of new sewers; (ii) a septage \nmanagement system (collection, treatment, and disposal) in Kampong Cham; (iii) expansion of \nthe Sihanoukville WWTP from 6,900 m3/day to 20,500 m3/day and 32.1 km of new sewers; and \n(iv)  a  new  3.7  km  trunk  sewer  in  Siem  Reap,  constructed  using  trenchless  technology  to  limit \ndisturbance to business and tourism activities.  \n \n18. \nOutput 3: Improved institutional effectiveness. The project will strengthen institutional \neffectiveness through improved coordination between MIH and MPWT, provide continued support \nto  help  provincial  waterworks  and  PWUs  achieve  financial  autonomy,  and  support  the  MIH  to \ndevelop its regulatory role. It will improve staff capacity in project implementation of urban WSS \nprojects  and  O&M  through  on-the-job  training.

To expedite project implementation \nand  promote  the  use  of  high-level  technologies,  design\u2013build  contracts  will  be  used for  the  (i) \nwater supply subprojects at Battambang and Kampong Cham, including water source, treatment, \nand  distribution  system;  (ii)  WWTP  at  Sihanoukville,  where  solar-powered  aerators  will  be \nemployed  to  increase  capacity  and  reduce  energy  and  carbon  emissions; 22  (iii)  WWTP  at \nBattambang,  where  a more  advanced  process  (based  on  modified  trickling  filters,  but  open  to \nother processes) will be used to avoid land acquisition and reduce energy and carbon emissions;23 \nand (iv) trunk sewer at Siem Reap, where trenchless construction will minimize resettlement and \ncompensation  costs,  and  reduce  pollution  of  the  local  watercourses.  The  project  is  classified \nmedium risk for future climate change impacts. The climate adaptation measures are small and \nare included in the normal engineering design process. The most critical item is water abstraction \nfrom the river at Battambang. MIH will facilitate this process in close cooperation with the Ministry \nof Water Resources and Meteorology to secure sufficient water during the dry season. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic analysis. The project is economically viable.24 The benefits of the water supply \n25. \ncomponents  were  quantified  based  on  (i)  resource  cost  savings  on  non-incremental  water \nconsumed, (ii) value of incremental water consumed and billed, and (iii) value of incremental water \nconsumed  but  not  billed  (nontechnical  losses).  The sanitation  components\u2019  benefits  were \nquantified in terms of health and environmental benefits and were measured using the disability-\n\n                                                \n22 EU\u2013AIF grant will finance energy-efficient improvements to the WWTP. \n23 JFJCM grant will finance the incremental cost of introducing a more advanced and energy-efficient WWTP. \n24 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8  \n\n \n\nadjusted-life-year approach.25 The base case economic internal rates of return for (i) water supply \nare 18.9% (Battambang) and 15.1% (Kampong Cham); and (ii) sanitation are 27.9% (Battambang), \n19.1% (Kampong Cham) and 20.5% (Sihanoukville), higher than the social discount rate of 9%. \n \nFinancial analysis. The government will use the proceeds of the loans and grant for the \n26. \nWSS subprojects in all four provincial cities. The implementing agencies will be expected to fully \ncover  O&M  costs  from  fees  collected  to  ensure  sustainability,  requiring  tariff  increases  to  be \ncontinued during and after the project, currently every 5 years. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nWater supply. Water tariffs are considered affordable as they remain within the \naffordability limit of 5% of average monthly household income. MIH reviews and \nadjusts water tariffs every 5 years, and they are required to be increased to ensure \nsustainability.  Cash  flows  of  provincial  waterworks  are  positive  in  2015  and  for \nprojected periods. \nSanitation. The financial assessment of the sanitation components confirmed that \nthe  proposed  tariffs  and/or  fees  fully  recover  O&M  costs  and  partially  recover \ndepreciation.  Cash  flows  of  the  Department  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  are \npositive in 2015 and for projected periods, and income will more than cover O&M \nexpenses.  The  sanitation  subprojects  are  considered  financially  sustainable  as \nthey too generate positive cash balances annually. Net cash inflows accumulated \nare  adequate  to  finance  the  replacement  of  equipment.  As  part  of  the  project, \nrevenues from proposed sewerage tariffs will be ring-fenced for PWU operations \nand collected through the water billing.  \n\n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n27. \nThe financial management risk is moderate. The financial management capacity of staff \nat the  provincial  level  requires  strengthening. The  external  audit  oversight functions  also  need \nimprovement. The appointment of experienced and qualified staff at MIH and MPWT is ongoing \nto  strengthen  their  project  management  units.  To  mitigate  the  capacity  risks,  project \nimplementation  assistance  consultants  will  conduct  training  on  ADB  procurement  and \ndisbursement guidelines, project accounting, and reporting.  \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n28. \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n29. \nThe  project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction,  improve  health  and  hygiene,  and  the \nextended water supply systems should benefit some 107,400 women (51% of the population). \nThe sanitation improvements should directly benefit some 47,400 women (51% of the population). \nThe replacement of the Siem Reap interceptor sewer will provide an immediate benefit to some \n25,400 people either connected to the system or within the vicinity of the trunk sewer route (by \nstopping  sewage  overflow  along  damaged  sections).  The  key  poverty  reduction  and  social \ninclusive design features of the project include (i) subsidized water supply connections, and (ii) \nfree sewer connections.  \n \n30. \nBased  on  the  gender  analysis  and  proposed  actions,  the  project  is  effective  gender \nmainstreaming.  The  gender  assessment  identified  women\u2019s  low  participation  in  the  sector, \n                                                \n25Harvard  University  developed  the  approach  for  the World  Bank  in  1990  for  a  study  that  provided  a  comprehensive \nassessment of mortality and disability from diseases, injuries, and risk factors. The World Health Organization adopted \nthe method in 1996. \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nreflected  in  few  women  in  decision-making  positions  within  the  executing  agency  and \nimplementing agencies; low employment opportunities for women (arising from capacity and skill \nconstraints)  and opportunities for  institutional  advancement;  lack  of  bathrooms  and latrines for \npoor  women  affecting  privacy  and  safety;  and  low  affordability  of  connections  and  tariffs.  The \nproject will support increased women\u2019s representation in the urban WSS sector by setting female \ntargets for staffing in project management units and project implementation units and providing \ncapacity-development activities and employment opportunities during construction. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard categories \n\n31. \nare as follows.26 \n \n32. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  project  team  prepared  two  initial  environmental \nexamination reports based on the preliminary engineering designs, one each for water supply and \nsanitation.27 Each initial environmental examination includes an environmental management plan \nfor each group of subprojects with specific mitigation and monitoring measures for each. Public \nconsultations  were  conducted  to  inform  the  project  design  and  environmental  assessment \nprocess  and  will  continue  during  project  detailed  engineering  design  and  implementation.  The \nproject team prepared the reports in compliance with government regulations and these reports \nwere disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 10 October 2017. The environmental management plans \nidentify  institutional  arrangements  and  budget  for  implementation  and  are  supported  by  loan \ncovenants, capacity development, and consulting services. A grievance redress mechanism will \nfacilitate resolution of complaints during implementation. \n \n33. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  project  has  limited  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  impacts.  A  land  acquisition  screening  indicated  no  severely  affected  households. \nImpacts can be largely mitigated by applying defined design and construction approaches that \nconfine construction works to public land and road right-of-way, avoiding any informal or formal \noccupation.  Temporary  impacts  during  pipeline  construction,  including  other  unanticipated \nimpacts,  will  be  addressed  during  implementation  based  on  actual  impacts  and  in accordance \nwith the resettlement framework as disclosed on 10 October 2017. The project team prepared \ntwo  resettlement  plans  for  Battambang  (one  for  water  supply  and  one  for  wastewater).  Land \nacquisition is required for 2.4 hectares (ha) of government land for water supply (four affected \nhouseholds), while the JFJCM grant avoids any land acquisition for the WWTP. The project team \nprepared four due diligence reports for subprojects with no land acquisition\u2014one for the Kampong \nCham water supply subproject and three for the wastewater subprojects at Kampong Cham, Siem \nReap,  and  Sihanoukville. 28  The  government  will  acquire  land  for  the  project  facilities  in \naccordance with government and ADB policies and procedures.  \n \nIndigenous peoples (category C). Very few ethnic minorities were identified during the \n34. \nsocioeconomic survey undertaken for project preparation\u2014the survey identified ethnic minorities \nonly in Trakuan village in the Kampong Siem district of Kampong Cham province. 12 households \n(4.5%) are Cham, and two households (0.5%) are Vietnamese. Given the full integration of ethnic \nCham into mainstream Khmer, the very small number of Vietnamese  households encountered \n(who have also been integrated), and the identical impacts and benefits that will be realized by all \nhouseholds in the target areas, the project team did not prepare an indigenous peoples\u2019 plan. \n \n                                                \n26 ADB.
