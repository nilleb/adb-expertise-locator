THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Kingdom of Cambodia for the Provincial Water Supply and Sanitation Project.1 The report also \ndescribes (i) the proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de \nD\u00e9veloppement (AFD), and (ii) the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Japan \nFund for the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JFJCM) for the Provincial Water Supply and Sanitation \nProject, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the administration of the loan and grant.  \n \n2.  The project will expand and improve urban water supply and sanitation (WSS) services in \nfour of Cambodia\u2019s largest provincial cities, which are important commercial, industrial, and tourist \ncenters but lack access to piped WSS services. The project will also improve institutional capacity \nto provide sustainable WSS services. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Macroeconomic context. Cambodia\u2019s population was estimated at 15.2 million in 2016, \nspread across 24 provinces, 26 cities, and numerous district towns.2 While Cambodia remains \nalmost 80% rural, urbanization is accelerating and the urban population is expected to reach 30% \nof the national total by 2030. This urban growth has been centered mostly in and around the \ncapital, Phnom Penh. Since 2000, provincial cities and towns have been impacted by the \nincreasing urbanization and have played an increasingly important role in the country\u2019s economy. \nThis is the case in the cities of Battambang, Kampong Cham, Siem Reap, and Sihanoukville, \nwhich have grown to become important secondary cities, commercial and connectivity hubs, and \ntourism centers.3  Rapid economic development and urban migration in the cities highlighted the \nimportance of basic urban services, especially WSS, and the necessity to upgrade and expand \nthe infrastructure and improve service quality.  \n \n4.  Access to services. Countrywide, population access to improved water supply in urban \nareas (excluding Phnom Penh) is 69.7%, while access to piped water supply is low at only 42.2%. \nRapid expansion of the infrastructure is required to meet the government\u2019s 2025 target of 100% \naccess to potable water for the entire population. Access to improved sanitation in urban areas is \n80.2%, while access to sewerage and wastewater treatment is only 10.7%; a large proportion \n(69.3%)  have  individual  systems  (septic  tanks).  Open  defecation  in  urban  areas  remains \nunacceptably  high  at  17.3%.4 The  low  sanitation  coverage  across  the  country  has  led  to \nwidespread pollution, affecting rivers, coastal areas, and tourist areas. Except for Phnom Penh, \nthe government has not been able to invest adequately in urban WSS since the mid-1990s \nresulting in significant service delivery gaps due to (i) inadequate funds for capital investment and \noperation, (ii) weak regulatory framework and sector planning, and (iii) weak institutional capacity \nto implement and provide sustainable services.5  \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Cambodia. 2014. Cambodia Inter-Censal Survey (CHDS) 2014. Phnom Penh. \n3  Estimated populations in 2015: Battambang (257,600), Kampong Cham (86,100), Siem Reap (200,000), and \nSihanoukville (78,250).  \n4  Improved urban water supply includes piped water to households, public tap and/or standpipe, bore holes, protected \nwells, and improved rainwater collection. Improved sanitation includes flush and/or pour flush to piped sewers, septic \ntanks, and pit latrines with slab. Government of Cambodia, Ministry of Planning. 2014. Cambodia Socio-Economic \nSurvey. Phnom Penh (Tables 9 and 11). \n5  Urban water supply investments were mostly centered on Phnom Penh. The Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority is \nrecognized as one of the most efficient water utilities in Asia. Nationwide sanitation is lagging significantly. ", "2    \n5.  Policy  framework.  Cambodia\u2019s  National  Water  and  Sanitation  Policy 6  laid  basic \nprinciples  for  urban  and  rural  WSS  service  delivery  in  the  country,  including  duties  and \nresponsibilities for planning and implementation, standards, oversight, and evaluation. For urban \nareas, the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP), 2014\u20132018 provides key actions for \nwater supply, but actions for sanitation are not well-defined.7 Consequently, the project team \nprepared  a  draft  sanitation  roadmap8 under  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  the \nsubsector\u2019s development.9  \n \n6.  Institutional arrangements. Responsibility for the WSS sector is fragmented, requiring \ncooperation among ministries and overcoming structural and organizational weaknesses. Urban \nwater supply falls under the responsibility of the Ministry of Industry and Handicraft (MIH), and \nservice delivery is entrusted to the provincial waterworks (PWWs) under provincial administation. \nThe Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) is responsible for urban sanitation, while the \nprovincial wastewater units (PWUs) under provincial administration are in charge of operation and \nmaintenance. However, the PWWs and PWUs have limited autonomy\u2014provincial waterworks \noperate using their revenues from water tariffs while PWUs operate with limited revenues as the \nrecovery of sanitation tariffs is mixed with the provincial revenues. In late 2016, the government \nupgraded the Department of Potable Water Supply of MIH to a general department to better \nsupport the sector with increased staffing and improved organization of activities. While this \nchange is significant for sector development, capacity development and training is required to \nsupport these expanded activities, which the project will support. The government created a \ndedicated Department for Urban Sanitation at MPWT with similar needs. Recent and continuing \ngovernment reforms (para. 8) are transforming the sector and improving coordination between \nagencies, but additional support is needed to accelerate this work.  \n \n7.  Service delivery through the private sector. In many cities and towns, small-scale \nprivate water operators have filled the gap, but these services generally only provide water to the \nmore profitable core areas of the town and many households remain unconnected, particularly \nthe poor.10 However, the infrastructure, water quality, and service standards of private water \noperators remain poor and they lack the technical expertise and financial capacity to support any \nform of private sector development. Given the low participation levels by the private sector, MIH \ncontinues to expand service delivery by the provincial waterworks where there is significant \ndemand. \n \n8.  Sector reforms and improved financial performance. In 2014, MIH launched a sector \nreform  program  to  improve  urban  water  supply  services  and  the  financial  performance  of \n                                                \n6  Government of Cambodia. 2003. National Water and Sanitation Policy. Phnom Penh. \n7  Government of Cambodia. 2014. National Strategic Development Plan, 2014\u20132018. Phnom Penh. Key  actions for \nwater supply  in the NSDP are (i) development of a legal framework for urban water supply; (ii) promotion of \ndecentralization and deconcentration; (iii) transfer of full autonomy for service delivery to all provincial public \nwaterworks; (iv) mobilization of urban water sector financing; (v) improvement of sector performance and public \naccess to safe, affordable, and sustainable water supplies; and (vi) improvement in the protection of water sources \nand enforcement of regulations.  \n8 The draft 20-year sanitation roadmap (expected to be adopted by 2020) provides directions on (i) tariff setting and \ncost recovery, (ii) subsidies to encourage increased uptake of sanitation, and (iii) city-wide sanitation planning and \nimplementation. It also presents common aims and standards for all departments of public works and transport to (i) \nreduce the differences in capacity, (ii) improve planning for increased sanitation coverage, and (iii) improve \ncoordination between the WSS subsectors. \n9 Technical assistance supported the development of prefeasibility studies and preliminary engineering designs for the \nproject and a draft sanitation roadmap. ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for Supporting the Cities Development \nInitiative for Asia. Manila.  \n10  Investment by the private sector has been hindered by the use of 3-year water licenses, limited access to finance, \nand poor capacity. In 2014, MIH issued a ministerial decree that provides more clarity about the licensing process \nand grants a 20-year license term for operators in a defined service area. \n ", "3 \nprovincial waterworks, focusing on operational improvements and efficiency gains. The program \nis based on the reforms that made the Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority (PPWSA) one of the \nmost efficient water utilities in Asia.11 The government introduced minor tariff increases where \nneeded, as the law only permits tariffs adjustments every 5 years. Based on MIH\u2019s reform \nprogram, in 2017 (i) all provincial waterworks are recording positive incomes, (ii) nonrevenue \nwater is mostly below 20%, and (iii) service quality has improved. Tariffs are now at sustainable \nlevels for financing operation and maintenance (O&M) but are insufficient to finance the capital \ncosts required for system expansion. Support for capital investments to expand infrastructure \ncoverage and increase the customer base is an urgent priority for the MIH and is crucial for \nprovincial waterworks to achieve financial autonomy by 2019 in line with the NSDP, 2014\u20132018.  \n \n9.  Support to the sanitation subsector. Although the sanitation subsector has made \npositive steps in terms of coverage, overall, the wastewater (including collection and treatment) \nremains in the early stages of development. A new focus on sanitation has evolved through recent \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) urban development projects and good government support now \nexists to increase sanitation coverage, enhance sustainability through improving revenues for \nO&M, and reduce pollution of watercourses draining to the Tonle Sap lake and the sea.12 Piped \nsewer systems and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are present in only three provincial \ncities,13 and expansion is needed for the environmental and health benefits to be realized. For \nother cities and towns, like Kampong Cham, formal sanitation services are absent, and septage \nmanagement needs to be introduced as a first step in mainstreaming sanitation countrywide.  \n \n10.  Project-specific constraints. Given that the government\u2019s ongoing sector reform is \nshowing good results, the immediate demand is for capital investment to support the expansion \nof services. The project will support ongoing water supply and sanitation service improvement in \nkey economic growth centers that experience the following constraints:14 \n(i)  In Battambang, the population with access to piped water supply is about 31% and \nto sewerage is about 5%. WWTP capacity is inadequate to treat the sewage. \n(ii)  In Kampong Cham, the population with access to piped water supply is about 37% \nand there is no access to a formal sanitation system.  \n(iii)  In Sihanoukville, while other projects are expanding access to water supply, the \npopulation  with  access  to  sewerage  is  about  22%  but  WWTP  capacity  is \ninadequate and needs expansion together with the sewerage system.  \n(iv)  In Siem Reap, while other ongoing projects will expand access to water supply, \nthe population with access to sewerage is about 50%. However, the trunk sewer \nis  structurally  and  hydraulically  inadequate,  resulting  in  pollution  of  local \nwatercourses. \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s assistance and lessons learned. ADB has supported the urban WSS sector \nsince 1995, starting with support for water supply improvements in Phnom Penh. The project \nincorporates lessons learned in implementation: (i) improving specifications for materials and \nequipment  to  enhance  project  quality  and  sustainability;  (ii)  introducing  energy  efficiency \nmeasures to reduce O&M and capture carbon emissions; (iii) providing higher levels of project \nsupervision to improve project deliverable quality; (iv) continuing provision of capacity building \n                                                \n11 The success of PPWSA is characterized by strong and long-lasting leadership, autonomy to allow the freedom to \noperate on corporate principles, continuous staff development, performance-based bonus system, customer- \noriented service, high-quality infrastructure and equipment, and a strong focus on nonrevenue water reduction, \nenergy efficiency, and expansion of coverage. \n12 Battambang, Kampong Cham, and Siem Reap are cities in the Tonle Sap basin whose drainage systems flow to the \nTonle Sap lake. Sihanoukville is the main coastal city where drainage systems discharge to the sea. \n13  Battambang, Siem Reap, and Sihanoukville\u2014all with support from previous ADB-financed projects. \n14  The existing situation and proposed options in each town are included in the Pre-engineering Design Reports \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4    \nsupport to improve sector sustainability; and (v) considering the use of design\u2013build contracts to \npromote design flexibility and expedite project delivery through private sector efficiency. \n \n12.  Development coordination. The project has been closely designed with the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency and the AFD, which are active in this sector. While the World \nBank has been less active, coordination continues as it has plans to re-enter the sector. The \nJapan International Cooperation Agency is working in numerous provinces to increase urban \nwater supply coverage in core areas, and is providing extensive capacity development support \nfor provincial waterworks. AFD is financing a new water treatment plant in Phnom Penh, and has \na parallel cofinanced project in Siem Reap for a water treatment plant to provide water for the \ndistribution zone financed by ADB.  \n \n13.  Strategic context. The project is aligned with (i) phase 3 of the government\u2019s rectangular \nstrategy for growth, employment, equity, and efficiency;15 (ii) Cambodia\u2019s NSDP, 2014\u20132018; (iii) \nthe action plans of the MIH to strengthen the management of publicly owned waterworks and \nintegrate  urban  water  supply  with  urban  environmental  management;  and  (iv)  MPWT \nrequirements for improved and effective urban sanitation. The project is consistent with the three \npillars of the ADB country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for Cambodia and supports ADB\u2019s \nWater Operational Plan and ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan.16  \n \n14.  Value added by ADB assistance. ADB\u2019s continued assistance to the government\u2019s \nsector  development  strategy  is  important  to  ensure  access  to  equitable  WSS  services  in \nCambodia\u2019s towns and cities. It will provide the finance and capacity development required to \nimplement the project as well as (i) incorporate high-level technologies addressing cost-effective \nwastewater treatment, energy efficiency, and advanced construction techniques (trenchless \nmethods for pipe laying); (ii) use design\u2013build procurement modalities to expedite design and \nconstruction and benefit from private sector experience and capacity; (iii) support provincial \nwaterworks\u2019 progress toward financial autonomy by 2019 by expanding the customer base; and \n(iv) promote sustainability of the PWUs, through ring-fencing of revenues dedicated for O&M and \ndevelopment of a financially sustainable tariff policy. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact: improved urban environments and quality \n \nof life for the urban residents.The project will have the following outcome: sustainable piped WSS \nservices provided in selected provincial cities. \n \nC.  Outputs \n16.  Output 1: Improved piped water supply. The project will finance two water supply \nsubprojects (in Battambang and Kampong Cham), including two new water treatment plants with \na combined capacity of 61,600 cubic meters per day (m3/day) and new distribution networks with \na combined length of 161 kilometers (km), which will also assist in reducing nonrevenue water. \nThe expanded systems will serve an additional 209,000 people (about 40,000 connections) by \n2022 (achieving a population coverage of about 90%), increasing revenues and reducing unit \ncosts through increased economies of scale. The project will assist the government to develop a \n                                                \n15 Government of Cambodia. 2013.

New laboratory equipment \nwill improve monitoring and water quality testing.  \n \n17.  Output 2: Improved sanitation. The project will finance four sanitation subprojects: (i) a \nnew 10,625 m3/day capacity WWTP at Battambang and 15.4 km of new sewers; (ii) a septage \nmanagement system (collection, treatment, and disposal) in Kampong Cham; (iii) expansion of \nthe Sihanoukville WWTP from 6,900 m3/day to 20,500 m3/day and 32.1 km of new sewers; and \n(iv) a new 3.7 km trunk sewer in Siem Reap, constructed using trenchless technology to limit \ndisturbance to business and tourism activities.  \n \n18.  Output 3: Improved institutional effectiveness. The project will strengthen institutional \neffectiveness through improved coordination between MIH and MPWT, provide continued support \nto help provincial waterworks and PWUs achieve financial autonomy, and support the MIH to \ndevelop its regulatory role. It will improve staff capacity in project implementation of urban WSS \nprojects and O&M through on-the-job training. The project will help develop a new master\u2019s \nprogram in water and wastewater engineering with the Institute of Technology of Cambodia to \nsupport future graduates in the sector.18 \n \nD.

Mitigation measures include installation of energy-efficient equipment in the WWTPs. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and presented in detail in \nthe project administration manual (PAM).20 The project is subject to universal procurement.21 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2018\u2013December 2022 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2022 (loan and grant closing: 30 June 2023) \nManagement \n(i) Oversight body  Coordinating committee - representatives from MIH, MPWT, and MEF \n(ii) Executing agency  MIH \n(iii) Implementing agency  MPWT for sanitation \n(iv) Implementation units  PWWs for water supply subprojects.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n24.  The subprojects will adopt a lowest life-cycle cost solution that considers operational \nissues for WSS services and where each component operates efficiently when completed. \nImproved specifications for products and construction techniques for pipelines will ensure the \nlong-term integrity of the water supply and sewer networks. To expedite project implementation \nand promote the use of high-level technologies, design\u2013build contracts will be used for the (i) \nwater supply subprojects at Battambang and Kampong Cham, including water source, treatment, \nand  distribution  system;  (ii) WWTP  at  Sihanoukville,  where  solar-powered  aerators  will  be \nemployed  to  increase  capacity  and  reduce  energy  and  carbon  emissions;22 (iii) WWTP  at \nBattambang, where a more advanced process (based on modified trickling filters, but open to \nother processes) will be used to avoid land acquisition and reduce energy and carbon emissions;23 \nand (iv) trunk sewer at Siem Reap, where trenchless construction will minimize resettlement and \ncompensation costs, and reduce pollution of the local watercourses. The project is classified \nmedium risk for future climate change impacts. The climate adaptation measures are small and \nare included in the normal engineering design process. The most critical item is water abstraction \nfrom the river at Battambang. MIH will facilitate this process in close cooperation with the Ministry \nof Water Resources and Meteorology to secure sufficient water during the dry season. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n25.  Economic analysis. The project is economically viable.24 The benefits of the water supply \ncomponents  were quantified  based  on  (i) resource cost  savings  on  non-incremental  water \nconsumed, (ii) value of incremental water consumed and billed, and (iii) value of incremental water \nconsumed  but  not  billed  (nontechnical  losses).  The sanitation  components\u2019  benefits  were \nquantified in terms of health and environmental benefits and were measured using the disability-\n                                                \n22 EU\u2013AIF grant will finance energy-efficient improvements to the WWTP. \n23 JFJCM grant will finance the incremental cost of introducing a more advanced and energy-efficient WWTP. \n24 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8    \nadjusted-life-year approach.25 The base case economic internal rates of return for (i) water supply \nare 18.9% (Battambang) and 15.1% (Kampong Cham); and (ii) sanitation are 27.9% (Battambang), \n19.1% (Kampong Cham) and 20.5% (Sihanoukville), higher than the social discount rate of 9%. \n \n26.  Financial analysis. The government will use the proceeds of the loans and grant for the \nWSS subprojects in all four provincial cities. The implementing agencies will be expected to fully \ncover O&M costs from fees collected to ensure sustainability, requiring tariff increases to be \ncontinued during and after the project, currently every 5 years. \n(i)  Water supply. Water tariffs are considered affordable as they remain within the \naffordability limit of 5% of average monthly household income. MIH reviews and \nadjusts water tariffs every 5 years, and they are required to be increased to ensure \nsustainability. Cash flows of provincial waterworks are positive in 2015 and for \nprojected periods. \n(ii)  Sanitation. The financial assessment of the sanitation components confirmed that \nthe proposed tariffs and/or fees fully recover O&M costs and partially recover \ndepreciation. Cash flows of the Department of Public Works and Transport are \npositive in 2015 and for projected periods, and income will more than cover O&M \nexpenses. The sanitation subprojects are considered financially sustainable as \nthey too generate positive cash balances annually. Net cash inflows accumulated \nare adequate to finance the replacement of equipment. As part of the project, \nrevenues from proposed sewerage tariffs will be ring-fenced for PWU operations \nand collected through the water billing.  \n \nC.  Governance \n27.  The financial management risk is moderate. The financial management capacity of staff \nat the provincial level requires strengthening. The external audit oversight functions also need \nimprovement. The appointment of experienced and qualified staff at MIH and MPWT is ongoing \nto  strengthen  their  project  management  units.  To  mitigate  the  capacity  risks,  project \nimplementation  assistance  consultants  will  conduct  training  on  ADB  procurement  and \ndisbursement guidelines, project accounting, and reporting.  \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n29.  The project will contribute to poverty reduction, improve health and hygiene, and the \nextended water supply systems should benefit some 107,400 women (51% of the population). \nThe sanitation improvements should directly benefit some 47,400 women (51% of the population). \nThe replacement of the Siem Reap interceptor sewer will provide an immediate benefit to some \n25,400 people either connected to the system or within the vicinity of the trunk sewer route (by \nstopping sewage overflow along damaged sections). The key poverty reduction and social \ninclusive design features of the project include (i) subsidized water supply connections, and (ii) \nfree sewer connections.  \n \n30.  Based on the gender analysis and proposed actions, the project is effective gender \nmainstreaming. The gender  assessment  identified  women\u2019s  low  participation  in  the sector, \n                                                \n25Harvard University developed the approach for the World Bank in 1990 for a study that provided a comprehensive \nassessment of mortality and disability from diseases, injuries, and risk factors. The World Health Organization adopted \nthe method in 1996. \n ", "9 \nreflected  in  few  women  in  decision-making  positions  within  the  executing  agency  and \nimplementing agencies; low employment opportunities for women (arising from capacity and skill \nconstraints) and opportunities for institutional advancement; lack of bathrooms and latrines for \npoor women affecting privacy and safety; and low affordability of connections and tariffs. The \nproject will support increased women\u2019s representation in the urban WSS sector by setting female \ntargets for staffing in project management units and project implementation units and providing \ncapacity-development activities and employment opportunities during construction. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n31.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard categories \nare as follows.26 \n \n32.  Environment  (category  B).  The  project  team  prepared  two  initial  environmental \nexamination reports based on the preliminary engineering designs, one each for water supply and \nsanitation.27 Each initial environmental examination includes an environmental management plan \nfor each group of subprojects with specific mitigation and monitoring measures for each. Public \nconsultations  were  conducted  to  inform  the  project  design  and  environmental  assessment \nprocess and will continue during project detailed engineering design and implementation. The \nproject team prepared the reports in compliance with government regulations and these reports \nwere disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 10 October 2017. The environmental management plans \nidentify institutional arrangements and budget for implementation and are supported by loan \ncovenants, capacity development, and consulting services. A grievance redress mechanism will \nfacilitate resolution of complaints during implementation. \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project has limited land acquisition and \nresettlement impacts. A land acquisition screening indicated no severely affected households. \nImpacts can be largely mitigated by applying defined design and construction approaches that \nconfine construction works to public land and road right-of-way, avoiding any informal or formal \noccupation.  Temporary  impacts  during  pipeline  construction,  including  other  unanticipated \nimpacts, will be addressed during implementation based on actual impacts and in accordance \nwith the resettlement framework as disclosed on 10 October 2017. The project team prepared \ntwo resettlement plans for Battambang (one for water supply and one for wastewater). Land \nacquisition is required for 2.4 hectares (ha) of government land for water supply (four affected \nhouseholds), while the JFJCM grant avoids any land acquisition for the WWTP. The project team \nprepared four due diligence reports for subprojects with no land acquisition\u2014one for the Kampong \nCham water supply subproject and three for the wastewater subprojects at Kampong Cham, Siem \nReap,  and  Sihanoukville.28 The  government  will  acquire  land  for  the  project  facilities  in \naccordance with government and ADB policies and procedures.  \n \n34.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Very few ethnic minorities were identified during the \nsocioeconomic survey undertaken for project preparation\u2014the survey identified ethnic minorities \nonly in Trakuan village in the Kampong Siem district of Kampong Cham province. 12 households \n(4.5%) are Cham, and two households (0.5%) are Vietnamese. Given the full integration of ethnic \nCham into mainstream Khmer, the very small number of Vietnamese households encountered \n(who have also been integrated), and the identical impacts and benefits that will be realized by all \nhouseholds in the target areas, the project team did not prepare an indigenous peoples\u2019 plan. \n \n                                                \n26 ADB.
