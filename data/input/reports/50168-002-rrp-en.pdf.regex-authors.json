THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based loan (PBL) to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 2 of the Fiscal and Public \nExpenditure Management Program (FPEMP)1 and (ii) the inclusion of an additional subprogram \nin the programmatic approach. \n \n2.  FPEMP is part of coordinated assistance provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto support the government\u2019s focus on reducing poverty and inequality through sustainable and \ninclusive growth. The program (i) aligns the government\u2019s medium-term expenditure with the \nRPJMN and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); (ii) enhances the national public \nexpenditure system; and (iii) improves fiscal transfers and spending for better service delivery at \nthe subnational government level. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nSubprogram 2 is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan (2018\u20132020) for Indonesia \nas a deliverable in 2018.2 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Programmatic approach and budget support. FPEMP uses a programmatic approach \nwhich aligns ADB\u2019s support with the government\u2019s reform program through a PBL over a medium \nto  long-term  time  horizon.  The  design  of  FPEMP  provided  for  targeted  support  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN) 2015\u20132019 to reduce income \nand regional inequality.3 This objective is part of the second pillar of ADB\u2019s Country Partnership \nStrategy  2016\u20132019  which  seeks  to  enhance  economic  governance.4 The  programmatic \napproach and subprogram 1 amounting to $500 million single tranche loan were approved by the \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors on 10 November 2016. Subprogram 1 which consisted of 12 policy \nactions mapped the government\u2019s medium-term expenditure with the RPJMN and SDGs and \nimproved public expenditure management (PEM) at the national and subnational levels. This \nprovided a basis for more targeted and efficient expenditure management and a foundation for \nthe reforms in subprogram 2. Subprogram 2 with 13 policy actions links spending with targets \nunder the RPJMN and SDGs and strengthens PEM reforms by synchronizing planning with the \nentire budget cycle. The program also complements the government\u2019s medium-term revenue \nstrategy, which is supported by the World Bank.  \n \n4.  The program was designed to comprise two subprograms with the possibility of including \ntwo additional subprograms. This approach allows ADB to pace its support to the government\u2019s \nreform efforts. Based on the government\u2019s request, FPEMP will include a third subprogram to \ncontinue the reform momentum and strengthen the links between the RPJMN and SDGs. \nSubprogram 2 improves budget preparation, transparency, execution, and monitoring, including \nimplementation of gender-responsive tagging and budgeting. Subprogram 3 will include 13 policy \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016.

The development problem. The government faces interrelated challenges of increasing \neconomic growth, alleviating poverty, and reducing income inequality. Indonesia\u2019s economic \ngrowth rate declined from 6.4% in 2010 to an average of 5.0% from 2014 to 2017. Growth is \nexpected to pick up to around 5.3% in 2018, suggesting a gradual recovery toward its medium-\nterm growth rate of 5.6% (2010\u20132017).5 Reforms and the resulting growth have led to a reduction \nin the poverty rate from 24.0% in 1999 to 10.6% in 2017. However, this may still not be sufficient \nto provide employment for the 3 million additional people who attain working age each year. In \naddition, close to 40.0% of the population remains clustered around the national poverty line. \nThey are vulnerable to shocks such as food price increases, environmental hazards, and ill health. \n \n6.  Indonesia has seen inequality widen. The Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality, has \nincreased at a faster pace (from 0.30 in 2000 to 0.40 in 2015 before declining to 0.39 in 2017) \nthan in neighboring Southeast Asian countries. The uneven nature of infrastructure investment \nand  economic  growth  across  provinces  has  also  widened  regional  income  disparities  and \ninequality. Further, Indonesia\u2019s social assistance programs have not adequately tackled poverty \nand income inequality. Social spending and social protection have long been used predominantly \nas a shock-coping mechanism rather than a long-term targeted program to reduce poverty and \ninequality. As a result, Indonesia has been less successful in reducing income inequality through \nsocial assistance programs compared with its regional comparators. Analysis in subprogram 1 \n(footnote 1) showed that in 2013, Indonesia\u2019s income redistribution and social assistance policies \nreduced the Gini index from 44.8 to 42.0, or by 2.8 points, compared with reductions of 4.5 points \nin Philippines and 4.0 points in Malaysia. Further accentuating the problem, one in four youth are \nnot in employment, education, or training (NEET). Young women are even more at risk, with 32% \naged from 15 to 24 classified as NEET. Those categorized as NEET come from low-income \nfamilies, and the job entry barriers they face often perpetuate cycles of poverty and inequality. \n \nFigure 1: Reallocation of Energy Subsidies to Social Sectors and Infrastructure \n \n500.00\nh 400.00\na\npi\nRu 300.00\nf \no\nns  200.00\no\nTrilli 100.00\n0.00\nNP NP NP NP NP NP NP BN\nAPB APB APB APB APB APB APB RAP\n2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016  2017  2018 \nEducation Health Energy subsidies Non energy subsidies Infrastructure\n \nAPBNP = Anggaran Pendapatan dan Belanja Negara tahun anggaran (State Budget Revenue and Expenditure \nBudget Year). \nSource: Government of Indonesia, Ministry of Finance. \n                                                \n5  The government forecasted growth of 5.4% for 2018, while ADB, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the \nWorld Bank projected growth of 5.3%. \n ", "3 \n7.  In recognition of these challenges, the government in 2014 made reducing income \ninequality a priority in its national strategy. This strategy emphasizes the multidimensional and \nlong-term nature of poverty alleviation and differs from past practices by reducing universal \nsubsidies including regressive fuel subsidies in favor of more targeted social assistance programs. \nThis coupled with reforms in tax administration created significant fiscal space for increased \nexpenditure in education, health, infrastructure, and social assistance (Figure 1). After exceeding \ninfrastructure spending by 35% and aggregating 3 times the level of targeted social assistance \nspending in 2014, the energy subsidies declined significantly and represented only a fraction of \nthese expenditures in 2015.6 This shift from universal subsidies to pro-poor targeted social \nassistance has been effective. Beginning 2015, the trend of increasing inequality reversed, and \nthe Gini coefficient dropped from 0.40 in 2015 to 0.39 in 2016, marking its first time below 0.40 \nsince 2011. However, reaching the government\u2019s Gini coefficient target of 0.36 by 2019 and \nreducing the poverty rate to below 10.0% from 10.6% in 2017 will require stronger economic and \nfiscal performance, coupled with targeted spending on education, health, infrastructure, and social \nassistance programs. In addition, the public expenditure framework should be enhanced, the \nquality of service delivery improved, and access to finance increased. Programs also need to be \ndeveloped to help young Indonesians find quality jobs. \n \n8.  Binding constraints. The government has identified the challenges it needs to address \nto meet its Gini target. A more effective fiscal and PEM framework will be required, including  \n(i) alignment of medium-term expenditures with the RPJMN and SDGs targets, (ii) enhancements \nto the national public expenditure system, and (iii) improvements in fiscal transfers and the related \nspending by subnational governments for service delivery (paras. 9\u201312). \n \n9.  Misalignment  of  medium-term  expenditures  and  programs.  The  government\u2019s \nmedium-term expenditure framework is anchored on both the RPJMN and SDGs. Achieving this \nalignment requires (i) increased pro-poor budget allocations, particularly for education, health, \ninfrastructure, and targeted social assistance programs; and (ii) improved quality of spending \nthrough better governance and PEM. For example, Indonesia\u2019s index for allocations to higher \neducation was 20.4 points in 2016 compared with 29.6 in Thailand and 86.3 in Malaysia. Overall, \nIndonesia\u2019s higher education system scored 33.3 points compared with 39.7 in Thailand and 56.7 \nin Malaysia.7 Given the legal requirement to keep the deficit below 3% of gross domestic product \n(GDP), improvements in the quality of public expenditure will be required. \n \n10.  Several constraints have been identified. First, until recently the government did not have \na high-level national coordination body for implementing the SDGs. Targets for the RPJMN and \nSDGs  are  multidimensional  and  require  implementation  of  several  programs  across  line \nministries. Without a national coordination body, the risk of contradictory implementation across \nministries  is  high.  For  example,  the  noncash  social  assistance  program,  started  during \nsubprogram 1, needs to be expanded and monitored more closely. During the first quarter of \n2017, only 10% of the smart card beneficiaries received their benefits. Second, the necessary \nend-to-end coordination from planning, budget preparation, execution, monitoring, and reporting \nhas not been established. Without this coordination, priority programs will not receive sufficient \nbudget allocations. Moreover, implementation will be ad hoc and monitoring weak. Third, the \nexisting labor market programs are underfunded and not integrated and, therefore, have not been \neffective in tackling the high rate of youth NEET. \n                                                \n6  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Public  Sector  Management  (Public  Expenditure  and  Fiscal  Management), \n(accessible from list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  R. Williams, A. Leahy, and P. Jensen. 2017. U21 Ranking of National Higher Education Systems 2017. Birmingham, \nUnited Kingdom: Universitas 21 (University of Birmingham). \n ", "4 \n11.  Weaknesses in national public expenditure management. Indonesia introduced the \nmedium-term expenditure framework in 2011. However, weaknesses remain in budget planning, \nexecution, monitoring, and reporting, which impede pro-poor spending. Constraints include a lack \nof budget transparency; inefficient budget planning and approval; and slow budget execution, \nespecially for capital expenditure. The 2015 International Budget Partnership Report scored \nIndonesia\u2019s budget transparency at 59 out of 100, due to limited disclosure of budget information \nto the public.8 In addition, the use of multi-year contracts is still low because provisions allowing \nits use are narrow and spending units of line ministries are concern if the use of multi-year \ncontracts may lead to allegations of corruption. This results in multiple procurements for single \nprojects, which is inefficient and increases project cost. Advance procurement in its current form \nis also not effective. Line ministries can only begin the tender process when budget allocations \nare approved in November, delaying contract signing and the entire procurement process. As \nrecently as 2016, 50%\u201360% of capital spending was disbursed in the last quarter. \n \n12.  Ineffective  fiscal  transfers  lead  to  poor  quality  of  public  service  delivery  by \nsubnational governments. International empirical studies show that the quality of service \ndelivery at the subnational government level is enhanced by efficient and effective fiscal transfers \nwith adequate monitoring.9 In Indonesia as of 2017, 53% of total government spending was at the \nsubnational government level, with 38% at the district level and 15% at the provincial level.10 This \ncompares favorably with 2000, when only 16% spending was at the subnational government \nlevel.11 Despite this progress, the following weaknesses remain in the design, coordination, and \nmonitoring of the different channels of fiscal transfers (from national to subnational): (i) the \nconditions for subsequent disbursement of the Specific Allocation Fund (DAK) are not linked to \nabsorption and performance; (ii) the performance indicators of the Regional Incentive Fund (DID) \nare not clearly linked to the quality of public service delivery, particularly in education, health, and \ninfrastructure; and (iii) the transfers of the General Allocation Fund (DAU) and Revenue-Sharing \nFund are not linked to reporting requirements, and have in the past resulted in subnational \ngovernments having idle funds. Overall, improvements in all channels of fiscal transfers are \nrequired and more targeted expenditure is necessary to reduce regional disparities and inequality. \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n13.  The government\u2019s reform agenda. The government\u2019s medium-term strategy is to create \nsustainable and equitable economic growth through optimizing revenue, improving spending \nquality, improving subsidy schemes, and decentralizing fiscal authority. The reallocation of the \nenergy subsidy has provided an opportunity for the government to increase public spending on \neducation, health, social assistance programs, and infrastructure since the 2015 budget. This has \nhelped reduce regional disparities and strengthen basic service delivery. On the revenue side, \nIndonesia seeks to increase its tax-to-GDP ratio from about 10.0% in 2016 to 11.5% in 2018, and \nto 12.7%\u201313.3% by 2021. To support this increase, the government launched the tax amnesty \nprogram in 2016 to widen the tax base. This along with other tax administrative reforms brought \nin $10.2 billion in additional revenues and the tax compliance rate went up from about 63% in \n2016 to about 73% in 2017. \n                                                \n8  International  Budget  Partnership.

Fiscal Decentralization and the Efficiency of Public Service Delivery. Washington, DC. \n10 Broadly, there are four types of fiscal transfers in Indonesia: from the: (i) General Allocation Fund (DAU) to support \nrecurring spending; (ii) Specific Allocation Fund (DAK) for specific investment expenditures aligned with national \npriorities; (iii) Revenue-Sharing Fund, which covers natural resources; and (iv) Regional Incentive Fund (DID), which \nprovides an incentive to subnational governments to improve their performance. \n11 World Bank. 2017.

The program aligns medium-term expenditure with the RPJMN and \nSDGs targets, enhances national public expenditure system, and improves fiscal transfers and \nsubnational governments\u2019 spending for service delivery. The effect of these reforms is to increase \nand improve the quality of targeted spending through a better public financial management (PFM) \nframework. At the inception of the programmatic approach, the government agreed to accomplish \nsix expected prior actions (or triggers) and six policy milestones as a basis for subprogram 2.12 \nDuring processing of subprogram 2, a new prior action on synchronizing planning and the budget \nprocess was added, as it is a necessary reform to align spending with the SDGs. Subprogram 2 \nnow contains 13 reform actions (seven expected prior actions representing high-impact reforms, \nand six policy milestones), all of which have been accomplished. \n \n15.  Medium-term expenditure aligned with National Medium-Term Development Plan \nand Sustainable Development Goal targets. This reform area supports SDG 3 (good health), \nSDG 4 (quality education), and SDG 5 (gender equality) by increasing government funding of \ncore services and mainstreaming gender. Reforms completed in subprogram 1 included mapping \nof the SDGs targets against targets in RPJMN 2015\u20132019 and piloting the non-cash social \nassistance program. Subprogram 2 builds upon these reforms with three key accomplishments.  \nFirst, the government established the national coordination team for SDGs implementation \nchaired by the President of Indonesia. The team monitors and provides annual reporting on \nprogress  in  achieving  SDGs  targets,  including  those  related  to  gender. 13  This  up-front \ncommitment by the President was based on lessons learned during the implementation of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), where the President\u2019s involvement was limited to the \nlast few years of its implementation. Second, the government synchronized national development \npriorities with budget preparation, execution, monitoring, and reporting under a unified results \nframework. This coordination requirement reflects the government\u2019s commitment to meet the \nSDGs and to have a national budget with a focus on pro-poor expenditure to reverse inequality. \nFrom 2016 to 2018, budget allocations have increased as follows: (i) education, from $30.2 billion \nto $32.0 billion; (ii) health, from $7.6 billion to $8.1 billion; (iii) social assistance, from $10.4 billion \nto $11.8 billion; and (iv) infrastructure, from $23.0 billion to $29.8 billion.14 \n \n16.  Third, supplementing the increase in budget allocations, coverage of noncash social \nassistance programs (smart cards) to purchase food essentials was increased to 1.4 million \nhouseholds, higher than the original target of 1.2 million households. The conditional cash transfer \n(CCT) program, that provides allowances based on the condition that beneficiary families access \nbasic health and education services, increased from 6 million to 10 million beneficiary families \nincluding approximately 125,000 pregnant women. A World Bank report estimated that the bottom \n30% of the population receive over two-thirds of the benefits from this program, on par with other \ninternationally recognized CCT programs such as in Brazil and in the Philippines.15 The same \nreport estimated that expanding the CCT program to 6 million households could reduce the \npoverty rate by about 0.8 percentage points. Third, to address the problem of delayed delivery of \nthe noncash social assistance program (para 10), the government set up a monitoring team \nheaded by the minister of the Coordinating Ministry for Human Development and Cultural Affairs. \n                                                \n12 Prior actions are considered loan disbursement conditions, and policy milestones strengthen the program. A \ncomparison of the original and the revised subprogram 2 is in Summary Assessment of Policy Actions (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 The National Development Planning Agency leads the national coordination secretariat for SDG implementation, and \nis also responsible for mainstreaming gender in national development plans. \n14 During the period of subprogram 2 (from September 2016 to March 2018), on an aggregate basis, there was a real \nincrease of 7% in the budget allocation for education, health, social assistance, and infrastructure. \n15 World Bank. 2017. Indonesia Social Assistance Public Expenditure Review Update: Towards a Comprehensive, \nIntegrated, and Effective Social Assistance System in Indonesia. Jakarta. \n ", "6 \nBy the end of August 2017, more than 95% of targeted families had received assistance. The \nimpact of these reforms (2015\u20132018) is demonstrated across key SDGs indicators. Maternal \nmortality rate has dropped by 14% from 2012 to 2017 and the percentage of deliveries in health \ncare facilities increased from 77% in 2016 to 86% by 2017. In addition, better targeting and \ngradual expansion of social assistance programs helped reduce the Gini coefficient from 0.40 in \n2015 to 0.39 in 2016 (footnote 6). \n \n17.  For subprogram 3, the government will develop regional SDGs action plan and adopt the \nNational Strategy for Accelerating Gender Mainstreaming. The government will also pilot labor \nmarket activation programs for young women and men categorized as NEET. \n \n18.  National  public  expenditure  system  enhanced.  This  reform  area  contributes  to \nimplementation of SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure). Specifically, the government \nimproved the speed of disbursement of capital expenditure by providing greater control and \nflexibility over budgeting and procurement to line ministries. Reforms completed in subprogram 1 \nincluded implementation of online monitoring system for revenue and expenditure. There were \ntwo key accomplishments under subprogram 2. First, to improve budget transparency, the \ngovernment published a detailed medium-term fiscal framework in the Macroeconomic and Fiscal \nPolicy Framework. In addition, budget data was published in a dedicated portal, including a pre-\nbudget statement, and disaggregated budget data was based on thematic areas, including climate \nchange and gender-responsive budgeting. As a result, the International Budget Partnership \nconcluded that the government made all key budget documents publicly available in a time frame \nthat is consistent with international standards.16 \n \n19.  Second, efforts continue to simplify budget execution to expedite budgeted expenditures, \nincluding advance procurement and usage of multi-year contracts. The Presidential Regulations \non Procurement issued in March 2018 expanded the use of multi-year contracts. Line ministries \nwill be able to use them for services that overlap fiscal years and for recurring services or \ninfrastructure projects that can be shown to benefit from such an approach (even if the work is for \nless than 12 months). In addition, line ministries can better plan for advance procurement. The \nregulations allow line ministries to begin the tender process when the estimated budget is \napproved in June. This is a significant reform, as previously the tender process could only begin \nwhen the budget allocation was approved in November. This will expedite budgeted expenditures, \nwhich have traditionally been lopsided toward the last quarter of the year. \n \n20.  For subprogram 3, the government will improve budget efficiency by implementing an \nelectronic budget request system. MOF will also issue implementing regulations to support the \nPresidential Regulations on Procurement to support use of multi-year contract. \n \n21.  Fiscal  transfers  and  subnational  governments\u2019  spending  for  service  delivery \nimproved. This reform area strengthened PEM systems at the subnational government level for \npublic service delivery. The impact of these reforms cut across several SDGs at the subnational \nlevel, including SDGs 3, 4, 9, and 16 (accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels). Reforms \ncompleted  in  subprogram  1  included  increased  and  better  targeted  fiscal  transfers  and \nimplementation of government bond transfers to address idle funds at subnational government \nlevel.17 Subprogram 2 builds upon these reforms with three key accomplishments. First, the \ngovernment provided direct allocations through local transfers in 2016 for community health care \n                                                \n16 International Budget Partnership. Open Budget Survey. Indonesia. https://www.internationalbudget.org/budget-work-\nby-country/findgroup/group-data/?country=id (accessed 30 March 2018). \n17 Subnational governments with low levels of budget execution are given bonds in lieu of cash disbursements. \n ", "7 \nand family planning, and more than doubled the allocations from Rp4.6 trillion in 2016 to Rp10.4 \ntrillion in 2018. Second, the government introduced a new compliance mechanism to strengthen \nmonitoring and evaluation of fiscal transfers. Disbursements will only be made after subnational \ngovernments provide full accounting of previous expenditures. As of 2017, all 2,500 spending \nunits of local governments reported expenditure and accounting of the DAK and the Village Fund \nthrough the National Financial Management Information System (SPAN). Third, the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) refined the governance performance indicators to improve the selection criteria \nfor the DID by linking it to (i) fiscal management, (ii) the quality of public service delivery, and  \n(iii)  the  human  development  index.  The  impact  of  these  reforms  is  an  improvement  in \naccountability of subnational governments. This together with other structural reforms has the \npotential to reduce the cost for the government to raise capital necessary to meet SDGs targets. \n \n22.  For subprogram 3, the government will implement a prior action to improve the fiscal \ntransfers to make them more predictable and to link the DID with SDGs-related indicators, \nincluding stunting and maternal mortality. \n \nFigure 2: Asian Development Bank\u2019s Engagement in Public Expenditure \nManagement and Structural Reform Agenda \n2014\u20132019:\nSector reform programs \n2008\u20132012: and loan for financial \ninclusion, energy sector, \nLocal \nand investment climate \ngovernment \nfinancing, governance \nreform program\nloan, and TA \n2001: Large-scale \nTA to set up basic  2016\u20132020: \nPFM and PEM  FPEMP and TA \nsystems, including at  2012\u20132017: to support SDGs \nsubnational level\nTax revenue  and employment \nadministration and  programs \n2005\u20132010: policy improvement in \nlocal governments TA \nDevelopment \nPolicy Support \nProgram \n \nFPEMP = Fiscal and Public Expenditure Management Program, PEM = public expenditure management,  \nPFM = public financial management, SDGs = Sustainable Development Goals, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n23.  ADB experience. ADB has supported reforms in PEM and social protection through a \nsequential approach (Figure 2). In 2001, ADB provided TA to set up the PFM and PEM framework \nat the national and subnational levels. This was followed by support for the government to build \na modern national PFM system, including a public debt management office in 2005. In the second \nphase (2008), ADB provided support to introduce financial management information systems \nwithin 147 local governments and to decentralize the tax framework.18 Since 2012, ADB has \nprovided  TA  to  improve  the  fiscal  sustainability  of  social  security,  strengthen  the  fiscal \ndecentralization framework, and improve fiscal risk management of contingent liabilities arising \nfrom accelerated infrastructure investment.19 ADB also provided support to the government for \nimplementation of the MDGs, generating lessons that have been incorporated into output 1 of the \n                                                \n18 ADB. 2016.

Complementing the program, \nADB also supports the government\u2019s efforts to improve its investment climate and improve access \nto finance. The reforms to expand use of advance procurement and multi-year contracts are \ncomplimentary  to  the  reforms  to  improve  the  framework  for  private  sector  participation  in \ninfrastructure including to operationalize the joint Public-Private Partnership Office.20 \n \n24.  Lessons  learned.  ADB\u2019s  experience  provided  three  key  lessons  that  have  been \nincorporated into the design of the program. First, through ADB\u2019s program supporting MDGs, ADB \nlearned that meeting SDGs targets requires well-defined indicators, monitoring, and evaluation at \nthe subnational government level, all supported by reliable data collection.21 Second, responding \nto the challenges the government faced in meeting MDGs related to gender equality and maternal \nmortality, the implementation of the SDGs has been bolstered by the National Strategy for \nAccelerating Gender Mainstreaming, which incorporates gender targets into the implementation \nof SDGs. Third, social assistance programs have different impacts on inequality (footnote 6). \nThese programs require close monitoring and refinement to fully benefit the intended recipients. \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition  to  program  design  and  implementation.  ADB\u2019s  long-term \nengagement and structured policy dialogue with the government helped the government to \nprioritize and sequence reforms to develop the SDGs framework and design policy actions to \nimplement SDGs. ADB supported the design and evaluation of the CCT program during the pilot \nphase.22 ADB also provided TA to support the introduction of SDGs by assisting the government \nundertake a fiscal gap analysis for social assistance programs.23 In addition, ADB provided \nsupport through sector-specific TA to implement programs linked with SDGs targets covering the \neducation, energy, and finance sectors. In the health sector, ADB\u2019s regional TA supported \ndiagnostics on national health insurance to support the government achieve universal health \ncare.24 At the subnational level, ADB provided governance capacity development to 4 districts in \nEast Java to deliver good-quality education and health services.25 ADB\u2019s dialogue and assistance \nhave  strengthened  the  national  PEM  framework,  fiscal  transfers,  and  service  delivery  of \nsubnational governments. By 2017, the proportion of targeted national and subnational spending \nincreased by 10% to approximately Rp1,094 trillion from the 2015 baseline of Rp995 trillion, \nincluding a significant 26% increase for infrastructure. To achieve SDGs targets, ADB also \nintroduced innovative labor market activation programs based on international practice and the \nexperience gained from ADB\u2019s successful implementation of similar programs in the Philippines.26 \n \n26.  Development  partner  coordination.  The  government  leads  development  partner \ncoordination in the areas of PFM and PEM. ADB consulted the International Monetary Fund (IMF) \non fiscal projections. IMF\u2019s research and macroeconomic analysis informed the design of the \nprogram. The program also complements IMF\u2019s recommendations to link the national strategy to \nSDGs targets. The policy matrix was jointly developed with the German development cooperation \nthrough KfW. KfW and GIZ also provide TA, to support the government\u2019s diagnostic on SDGs \n                                                \n20 ADB. 2016.

The World Bank supports the government\u2019s \nfiscal and revenue mobilization reform. ADB also coordinates with bilateral agencies of the \ngovernments of Australia, France, Japan, and the United States on PFM reforms.27 \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n27.  Economic impacts of the program. This program addresses Indonesia's needs for fiscal \nreform. It supports improvements in government planning and public investment, and it aligns \nnational  development  with  implementation  of  the  SDGs.  The  program  impact  assessment \nestimates the net gains from these initiatives at $4.1 billion. A large proportion of the gross benefits \narise through returns from investment in education ($3.8 billion) and via the mobilization of \nunutilized government assets in the form of land and buildings ($2.0 billion).28 The total costs of \nreform for subprogram 2 is $1.9 billion, and they are generated by additional spending on \neducation and social assistance, as well as by the costs of improved service delivery to the poor.29 \n \nD.   Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n28.  The government has requested a single tranche loan of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 2.30 The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The average loan \nmaturity  is  9.25  years,  and  there  is  no  maturity  premium  payable  to  ADB.  The  German \ndevelopment cooperation through KfW is providing collaborative financing for subprogram 2. The \nloan size is based on Indonesia\u2019s financing needs, the development impact of the policy reform, \nand development spending from the reform (footnote 29). In 2018, the government\u2019s gross \nfinancing need is $58.4 billion, with a projected budget deficit of 2.2% of GDP. To finance the \ndeficit, the government plans to raise $43.8 billion from the issuance of securities and $3.8 billion \nfrom official foreign loans. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n29.  The MOF\u2019s Fiscal Policy Agency as the executing agency is responsible for coordinating \nprogram-related reforms. Implementing agencies include the directorates general of budget, \ntreasury, and fiscal balance. The national SDGs committee monitors SDGs implementation and \nprogress  reports.  The  implementation  period  is  from  September  2016  to  March  2018  for \nsubprogram 2 and from April 2018 to December 2019 for subprogram 3. The proceeds of the PBL \nwill be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n30.  Safeguards. Following evaluation of the policy actions, the subprogram will not have any \nlikely environmental, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples\u2019 impacts. The subprogram \nis classified category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n                                                \n27 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Formal analysis of the Indonesian education system broadly suggests that a 20% increase in income, or uplift factor, \napplied to the minimum wage of $3,110 for the 550,000 students who are assumed to enroll delivers a present value \nof $3.8 billion. \n29 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 The loan may be disbursed in one or more installments. \n ", "10 \n31.  Poverty and social. Subprogram 2 is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. \nIncreased expenditure in education, health, and infrastructure, as well as better-targeted social \nassistance, will reduce poverty and help the bottom 40% of the population, including pregnant \nwomen,  the  elderly,  and  people  with  disabilities,  to  have  access  to  basic  services.  The \ngovernment  developed  the  National  Strategy  for  Accelerating  Gender  Mainstreaming.  The \ngovernment also provided direct allocations for community health care and family planning \nthrough local transfers, with allocations more than doubling in 2018 compared to 2017. \n \n32.  Governance. The government has made considerable progress in improving the legal \nand regulatory framework for PFM. Since the enactment of laws on state finance, state treasury, \nand state audit in 2003\u20132004, regulations underpinning these laws have been promulgated. \nGovernance has also improved, with 70% of subnational governments receiving an unqualified \nopinion for their financial reports. ADB has reinforced this momentum with continuing support to \nimprove state audit capacity. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and the MOF\u2019s Fiscal Policy Agency. \n \n33.  Risks and mitigating measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are described in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.31 The expected net benefits and impacts of the \nprogram are expected to outweigh the risks. Inadequate capacity, especially at the subnational \ngovernment level, is a high risk that may slow the implementation of the SDGs. ADB is providing \nTA to improve capacity for SDGs implementation in health and education (footnotes 24\u201325). \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n34.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \nagreement. No disbursement shall be made unless ADB is satisfied that the government has \ncompleted the policy actions specified in the policy matrix relating to the program. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the loan of $500,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 2 of the \nFiscal and Public Expenditure Management Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of \n15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the inclusion of an additional subprogram 3 in the programmatic approach for the \nFiscal and Public Expenditure Management Program, as described in para. 4. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n18 May 2018\n                                                \n31 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible form the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nHousehold income inequality reduced (National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2015\u20132019)a \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and  Reporting  Risks \nBaselines  Mechanisms \nEffect of the Reform  By 2021:     \nSocial sector and       \ninfrastructure spending  a.
