The PBL will help \nthe Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) to undertake reforms to progressively align post-\nprimary education (PPE)\u2014including secondary education, technical and vocational education and \ntraining (TVET), and higher education\u2014with evolving labor demand and skill needs. The project \ncomponent  will  support  MOES  in  delivering  these  reforms  effectively,  widening  access  to \nsecondary  education,  and  improving  its  quality.  The  SDP  builds  on  the  Secondary  Education \nSector  Development  Program  (SESDP)  and  will  tap  synergies  with  ongoing  ADB  support  for \nTVET and higher education.1  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM  \n\n \n\nRationale \n\nEconomic  performance.  The  Lao  PDR  is  among  the  fast-growing  economies  in \n3. \nSoutheast Asia. Owing to a boom in minerals, hydropower, and forest products, and strong foreign \ndirect investment in these areas, its gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average rate of \n7.5% per year during 2010\u20132018. Gross national income per capita grew from $1,000 in 2010 to \n$2,270 in 2017. The Lao PDR met the criteria for graduation from least-developed country status \nfor  the  first  time  in  2018.2  Despite  this  growth,  the  pace  of  structural  transformation  from  an \neconomy based on the primary sector to one driven by industry and services remains sluggish, \nwith little change in the sectoral composition of employment. In 2018, services accounted for 48% \nof value added and 30% of employment, while industry accounted for 34% of value added and \n10% of employment. Nearly 60% of the workforce remains employed in agriculture, even though \nit accounts for only 18% of value added.3 The shift in the employment structure remains limited \nbecause of the capital-intensive nature of natural resource exploitation, weak infrastructure, and \nlow employability of the labor force. The country\u2019s performance in reducing poverty and improving \nsocial development has been below expectation.4 The Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey \nshows that poverty declined from 27.6% in 2007 to 23.2% in 2013. Income inequality widened \nbetween 1993 and 2013, with the Gini coefficient increasing from 0.31 to 0.36.5 \n \n\n                                                \n1  ADB.

Manila. \n\nDC. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe  development  problem.  Low  human  capital,  poor  infrastructure,  and  weak \n4. \ngovernance  and  inefficient  public  management  are  the  three  main  cross-cutting  challenges \nimpeding the Lao PDR\u2019s structural transformation, and its efforts toward poverty reduction and \ninclusive  growth.6  The  country\u2019s  human  capital  base  is  weak  mainly  because  of  the  very  low \nenrollment and completion rates in lower secondary (grades 6 to 9) and upper secondary (grades \n10  to 12)  education.  As the  Lao PDR  nears  universal  primary  schooling with completion rates \nabove 83%, access to good-quality secondary education has become a binding constraint. Only \n54% of the country\u2019s youth (54% males and 53% females) aged 22\u201324 years surveyed in 2012-\n2013  had  completed  lower  secondary,  and  only  31%  (32%  males  and  31%  females)  had \ncompleted  upper  secondary  education.7  Inequalities  across  wealth,  gender,  ethnicity,  and \ngeographic dimensions are interlinked: e.g., among 17\u221219-year-olds in households in the lowest \nwealth  quintile,  only  13%  of  females  and  16%  of  males  complete  lower  secondary  education, \ncompared  with  91%  of  female  and  89%  of  male  counterparts  in  the  richest  quintile.  A  high \nproportion of young people drop out of secondary schools and take up low-skill, temporary jobs \nin  the  informal  sector.8  The  high  dropout  rate  is  a  result  of  various  factors\u2014acute  shortage  of \nsecondary  schools;  poor  quality  of  school  facilities  and  dormitories;  lack  of  properly  trained \nteachers;  social  norms  surrounding  girls\u2019  education,  and  early  marriage  in  some  communities; \nand the expenses for school supplies and transportation, which make it difficult for poor families \nto keep their children in school up to grade 12.9 \n \nLow employability of  youth. Secondary education graduates in the Lao PDR account \n5. \nfor 47% of 18\u201327-year-olds in industry and services, while higher education and TVET graduates \ntogether account for only 29%. Employers in the Lao PDR face a shortage of vocation-specific \nhard  skills  (e.g.,  welding,  electrical,  and  automotive);  foundational  skills  (e.g.,  reading,  writing, \nbasic  mathematics  and  science,  critical  thinking,  analytical  ability,  transfer  of  learning,  and \nproblem solving); and soft skills (e.g., communication, punctuality, hygiene, ability to work within \nteams,  gender,  and  cultural  sensitivity).  Unless  the  country\u2019s  youth  complete  secondary \neducation, their basic foundational and soft skills, which are critical for higher studies and/or work, \nwill remain inadequate. This will trap them in a vicious cycle of low-skill, informal sector jobs, with \nbleak prospects for decent employment or a meaningful career. Among those aged 18\u221227 years, \n67.3% of women and 61.6% of men are in vulnerable employment (unpaid family or own-account \nwork).10  The  gap  between  the  demand  and  supply  of  skills  will  continue  to  widen  unless  the \ncoverage and quality of secondary education are improved. The economy will find it difficult to \nreduce  its  dependence  on  natural  resource  exploitation  and  low-cost  labor,  and  make  the \ntransition  to  higher  value-added  sectors.  The  Lao  PDR  will  not  be  able  to  tap  its  potential \ndemographic dividend or reduce its dependence on foreign-skilled workers.  \n \n6. \nWeak  alignment  between  post-primary  education  and  skill  needs.  While  raising \nsecondary education enrollment, completion, and quality is a necessary condition for the Lao PDR \nto tap the full potential of its human resources, this will not be sufficient. Progressively, the quality \nand relevance of the entire PPE\u2014secondary education, TVET, and higher education\u2014must be \n\n                                                \n6  ADB. 2017.

Manila.  \n7  By  comparison,  estimated  female  lower  secondary  education  completion  rates  are:  Cambodia  (57%),  Thailand \n\n(82%), and Viet Nam (90%). \n\n8  Unless otherwise noted, quantitative figures are based on an ADB analysis of data from the 2015 Population and \n\nHousing Census and 2017 Lao PDR Social Indicator Survey datasets. \n\n9  Enrollment in secondary education is estimated to grow from 671,000 in 2018 to 819,900 by 2025.  \n10 According to the 2018 Household and Youth Survey, (i) the youth unemployment rate at 13% in the Lao PDR is more \nthan  six  times  higher  than  the  adult  rate  (2%);  and  (ii)  an  estimated  473,000  youth  aged  15\u201329  years  were  not \nenrolled in education, employment, or training.

Owing to fiscal challenges, the Lao PDR\u2019s education \nbudget grew by only 9% during 2013\u20132018. PPE is severely under-resourced. Per-student block \ngrant financing for  secondary  schools  is  lower  than that for  primary  schools,  even  though  per-\nstudent  costs  are  higher  at the secondary  level.  Moreover,  PPE continues  to  be  supply-driven \nand  fragmented  across  separate  MOES  departments  (i.e.,  General  Education,  TVET,  Higher \nEducation,  Teacher  Education,  Nonformal  Education,  and  Planning;  Education  and  Sports \nStatistics Center; and Research Institute for Education and Sciences), with no unifying strategic \nframework to ensure that they collectively prepare the youth for the labor market.  \n \n7. \nRequired reforms. Crosscutting policy reform is required to break the silos and improve \ncoordination  across  MOES  departments.  This  will  enable  comprehensive,  evidence-based \nplanning  to  strengthen  the  links  between  PPE  and  employment  and  raise  budget  allocations. \nMOES should strengthen its engagement with the private sector to understand its needs better. \nIt should involve industry associations in the design of training curricula, competency standards, \nand  apprenticeship  programs.11  Reforms  are  also  required  to  (i)  improve  the  quality  of  the \nsecondary  education  curricula,  textbooks,  learning  material,  pedagogy,  and  assessment \nstandards; and (ii) ensure that MOES targets its budget to underserved areas and disadvantaged \ngroups to improve their access to schools with dormitories, laboratories, libraries, and toilets.12 \nIntegrated policy reforms will provide the platform and enabling environment for the investment \nsupport needed to raise the coverage and quality of secondary education, including building more \nschools, investing in teacher training based on the improved teaching and learning materials, and \nstrengthening the alignment of PPE with labor demand. \n \nAlignment with government\u2019s priorities. The Lao PDR\u2019s 8th National Socio-economic \n8. \nDevelopment Plan, 2016\u20132020 prioritizes education as a prerequisite for poverty reduction and \ninclusive growth.13 Secondary education reform is central to its goal of graduating from a least-\ndeveloped country status by 2020. The Education and Sports Sector Development Plan, 2016\u2013\n2020  calls  for  increased  funding  for  PPE  to  raise  youth  employability.14  Its  midterm  review, \ncompleted  in  late  2018,  emphasized  the  need  to  (i)  increase  transition  from  primary  to  lower \nsecondary  to  upper  secondary  levels;  (ii)  move  toward  universal  enrollment  at  the  lower \nsecondary  level,  and  eventually  at  the  upper  secondary  level;  (iii)  raise  secondary  completion \nrates; (iv) improve teaching and student learning outcomes; and (v) strengthen the evidence basis \nfor  policies and  investments to  link education more  effectively  to employment.15  The  proposed \nSDP has been designed accordingly to reinforce the government\u2019s efforts to fulfill these priorities. \nFurther,  by  improving  the  resilience  of  school  facilities  against  floods,  droughts,  higher \ntemperatures, erratic precipitation, and other extreme events, the SDP will support the adaptation \n\n                                                \n11 These policy reforms and the investment support needed for operationalization are included under output 1. \n12 These policy reforms and the investment support needed for operationalization are included under outputs 2 and 3. \n13 Government of the Lao PDR.

ADB\u2019s Lao PDR country partnership strategy, 2017\u2013\n2020 reinforces ADB\u2019s continuing role of supporting PPE and complementing the work of other \ndevelopment partners that focus on pre-primary and primary education.18 Strategic priority 2 of \nthe  country  partnership  strategy  emphasizes  the  need  for  human  resource  development  by \nstrengthening  PPE  to  ensure  that  graduates  are  more  employable  and  able  to  diversify  into \nindustry and services. The proposed SDP is aligned with this priority. It will build on lessons from \nthe  SESDP  (footnote  1)  and  its  reforms,  which  include  revision  of  the  secondary  education \ncurriculum; extension of secondary education to grade 12; and introduction of a new bachelor-\nlevel, preservice teacher education program for secondary school teachers. Under the proposed \nSDP, all teacher training programs and capacity-building workshops will be made more results-\noriented. The aim is to build capacity within MOES departments and teacher training colleges, so \nthat they can gradually reduce dependence on consultants and sustain the reforms on their own. \nTeacher training colleges will make greater use of education technology and digital modules to \npromote  learner-centered  pedagogy  and  improve  the  quality  of  teacher  training.  Advance \ncontracting will raise project readiness and ensure that the proposed schools and related facilities \nare  constructed  within  2\u22123  years.  This  will  enable  an  early  increase  in  secondary  school \nenrollments. The SDP will tap synergies with the ongoing TVET and  higher education projects \n(footnote 1) and strengthen coordination with other development partners.19 \n \n10. \n \n\nThe SDP supports ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 as indicated below.20 \n\nTable 1: Program Link to Strategy 2030 Operational Priorities \n\nStrategy 2030 Priorities \nAddressing remaining poverty \nand reducing inequalities \n\nAccelerating progress in gender \nequality \n\nProgram \n\nImproving secondary education and training, building or upgrading \nsecondary schools, and creating industry links, all of which will \nincrease the number of secondary education graduates and their \nemployability. \nIncreasing enrollment and completion rates of girls in secondary \neducation, so that they can pursue higher education and compete \nfor employment opportunities.  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n11. \nChoice  of  modality.  As  elaborated  in  para.  7,  complementary  policy  and  investment \nsupport is required to reform PPE with a focus on secondary education. The PBL finances eight \npolicy actions under MOES\u2019 reform agenda, which will align PPE with evolving skill needs and \nhelp equip secondary school youth with the foundational and soft skills needed in the labor force \nand/or for pursuing TVET and higher education. These policy actions provide a platform for project \n                                                \n16 Some of the priority actions under the Lao PDR\u2019s National Adaptation Program of Action for Climate Change to be \nsupported  under  the  proposed  SDP  include  improving  systems  for  the  sustainable  supply  of  drinking  water  and \nsanitation, with community participation in flood- and drought-prone areas; building capacity and skills of engineers \nwho design and build water and sanitation systems; and raising public awareness on sanitation. \n\n17 Climate-proofing measures such as enhancing the resilience of public buildings (in this case, schools and related \nfacilities) against floods, integrated under the proposed  SDP, are aligned with the Lao PDR\u2019s  intended nationally \ndetermined contributions. \n\n18 ADB.  2017.

The project will combine nationwide \nsupport  for  strengthening  secondary  education  curricula  and  teacher  training  with  targeted \nsupport for building new facilities at 60 schools in disadvantaged districts (footnote 24). The SDP \nwill facilitate partnerships between secondary schools and local TVET institutes and centers for \nnonformal education, to allow secondary school students to undertake short internships during \nvacations (para. 14). The project will pilot innovations such as secondary school clusters (para. \n16),  wherein  groups  of  six  schools  across  20  selected  districts  (i.e.  120  schools  in  all)  will  be \norganized into hubs and spokes, so that they can tap into each other\u2019s resources (i.e., pedagogical \nadvisers, information technology facilities, and laboratories) and use them more efficiently. The \nproject component will help MOES undertake follow-on reform actions by 2022 as part of the post-\nprogram partnership framework (P3F).21 In view of these considerations, the sector development \nprogram modality is the most appropriate. \n \n\n \n\nSector Development Program Description \n\n12. \nImpact.  The  SDP  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  inclusive,  balanced,  and  skills-\ndriven economic growth achieved (footnote 13). It will have the following outcome: employability \nof secondary school youth enhanced.22 \n \n13. \nOutput  1:  Alignment  of  post-primary  education  with  labor  market  demand \nstrengthened. The SDP will provide policy and investment support to align PPE with the evolving \nskill needs of the Lao PDR\u2019s economy. Under the PBL component, two policy actions have been \nachieved.  First, to strengthen  PPE  planning  and  budgeting,  MOES  departments  are preparing \naction plans for secondary education, TVET, and higher education, with an emphasis on gender \nequity  as  instructed  by  MOES.  These  action  plans  will  provide  a  unifying  strategic  framework, \nimprove  coordination  and  information  exchange  across  departments,  facilitate  comprehensive \nplanning  and  data  analysis,  and  progressively  align  all  three  with  the  changing  labor  demand. \nSecond,  MOES  has  increased  the  block  grant  per  student  for  secondary  education  from  kip \n(KN)50,000 to KN70,000; and for TVET, from KN270,000 to KN300,000 per student.23 This will \nenable secondary  schools  and TVET  institutions  to  increase  spending  on  non-salary recurrent \ncosts,  including  quality-related  inputs  such  as  consumables  for  teaching  and  learning,  extra-\ncurricular  activities  to  promote  all-round  learning,  and  operations  and  maintenance  of  school \nfacilities. \n \n14. \nUnder  output  1,  the  project  component  will  (i)  strengthen  the  capacity  and  systems  of \nMOES  departments  for  monitoring  the  skills  supply  from  PPE,  improve  cross-departmental \ncollaboration,  and  deepen  industry  engagement;  (ii)  pilot  partnering  models  linking  secondary \nschools with nearby TVET and nonformal education centers in 20 selected districts (including the \n12 disadvantaged districts); and (iii) improve student counseling on academic and career options. \nSupport  will  be  provided  to  the  National  Commission  on  Human  Resource  Development  to \nconsolidate fragmented data and conduct sex-disaggregated analysis on education\u2212employment \nlinks  and  evolving  skill  needs.  MOES  will  pilot  partnerships  between  secondary  schools  and \nnearby  TVET  schools,  nonformal  education  centers,  and  local  industries  to  allow  secondary \nschool students to undertake brief internships during vacations. This will expose students to the \nworld of work and prepare them better for employment. Counseling material will be developed \n\n                                                \n21 The policy matrix is in Appendix 4. ADB may consider subsequent support for P3F reform actions. \n22 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n23 Block grants are nondiscretionary budget allocations determined through formulae based on objective parameters \nsuch as the number of students and teachers in a school, location, socioeconomic and poverty indicators, and quality \nof facilities. As they are based on objective parameters, the block grants increase the transparency in fund allocation \nand enable schools and TVET institutions to raise spending to improve facilities and the overall learning environment.   \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\funder  the  SDP  to  address  gender  stereotypes  and  raise  the  awareness  of  secondary  school \nstudents about career and job opportunities. Output 1 will thus support MOES in undertaking the \ndownstream reforms included in the P3F to continue with comprehensive planning and budgeting \nto target PPE investments in underserved regions. \n \n15. \nOutput 2: Quality and relevance of secondary education to emerging skills demands \nstrengthened. To enhance the employability of youth, it is essential to improve the quality and \nrelevance of secondary education in the priority subjects\u2014sciences, mathematics, English, and \nLao language\u2014that are critical for higher education and/or for jobs. Under the PBL component, \nMOES  accomplished  five  policy  actions  to  support  comprehensive  reforms.  Textbooks  for  the \npriority  subjects  are  being  aligned  to  the  updated  curricula.  MOES  accredited  eight  provincial \nteacher  training  institutions  to  ensure  that  they  offer  quality  teacher  training  at  the  bachelor's \ndegree level in these subjects. To encourage active participation by students during classes and \nto enhance their confidence and creative thinking (as opposed to rote learning), MOES introduced \nlearner-centered  pedagogy.  It  has  increased  support  for  continuing  professional  development \n(CPD) to complement in-service teacher training. This will ensure that teachers regularly refresh \ntheir  knowledge  in  these  priority  subjects  and  use  improved  delivery  methods.  The  policy  on \nnational student assessment is being aligned with international standards.  \n \n16. \nUnder output 2, the project component will further operationalize these policy reforms by \n(i) strengthening secondary education curriculum, pedagogy, and student assessment, focusing \non the priority subjects; (ii) supporting nationwide in-service training in the priority subjects and \nupgrading the qualifications of secondary teachers (prioritizing women) who teach these subjects, \npiloting CPD in 20 districts (including the 12 disadvantaged districts), and expanding the use of \neducation technology to improve the delivery of learner-centered teaching; and (iii) providing print-\nbased and digital learning resources for science laboratories and libraries to the secondary school \nclusters (para.11), so that they can deliver the improved curriculum effectively. Support will be \nprovided to update lower and upper secondary curricula in the priority subjects and to revise the \nteachers\u2019 guides and learning materials, ensuring sensitivity to gender, ethnicity, and disabilities. \nThe approach towards classroom and sample-based assessments of student learning outcomes \nwill be reviewed and aligned with international standards. Output 2 will help MOES deliver the \npolicy reforms and support progress toward the downstream reforms included in the P3F on (i) \nupdating of the curricula in the priority subjects, (ii) reforming CPD further; and (iii) undertaking \nrigorous assessments of learning outcomes.  \n \n17. \nOutput  3:  Equitable  secondary  education  access  and  completion  increased.  The \nSDP will support reforms and investments to address supply and demand-side constraints that \nare keeping secondary school enrollment and completion low. Under the PBL component, MOES \napproved  a  list  of  47  districts  that  suffer  from  an  acute  shortage  of  secondary  schools, \novercrowded schools, and high dropout rates after the primary level. This will enable MOES to \ntarget more funding for school facilities, teacher training, and deployment to these underserved \nareas. The project component will (i) alleviate supply-side constraints in 12 of these 47 districts \nby constructing additional classroom blocks, sex-segregated dormitories, sanitation facilities, and \ntoilets  at  60  primary  and  secondary  school  sites  (owned  by  the  government);  and  (ii)  reduce \ndemand-side constraints to access and completion by providing stipends based on a combination \nof need and merit, and prioritizing female and ethnic group students.24 At primary schools, new \n\n                                                \n24 MOES has designated 47 districts of the Lao PDR as \u201cpriority districts\u201d for secondary education investments under \npolicy action 8 of the PBL. From these 47 districts, it selected 20 districts for the activities proposed under outputs 1 \nand 2. These 20 districts include 12 \u201cdisadvantaged districts,\u201d where 60 secondary schools and related facilities will \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\flower secondary facilities will be built. At lower secondary schools, facilities will be provided for \nupper secondary classes. Additional classrooms will be built in overcrowded schools. All these \nmeasures will ensure that more girls and boys, including those belonging to ethnic groups, will be \nable to enroll in secondary schools and complete their education.  \n \n\n \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n18. \nValue addition. The SDP will build the capacity of MOES for undertaking comprehensive \nplanning and data analysis of PPE, which collectively supplies four-fifths of the entrants to industry \nand  services.  It  will  build  on  the  reforms  supported  under  the  SESDP  (para.  9).  The  SDP  will \ncomplement  the  European  Union\u2019s  budget  support  and  linked  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund \ntechnical assistance, which focus on pre-primary and primary education.25 The SDP will support \ninnovations  and  add  value  by  (i)  piloting  partnership  arrangements  linking  secondary  schools, \nTVET, nonformal education centers, and local industries, and improving counseling for students, \nto  better  prepare  them  for  jobs;  (ii)  making  greater  use  of  education  technology  solutions  to \nimprove teacher training; (iii) improving secondary school assessments to shift the focus from rote \nlearning to critical thinking and soft skills; and (iv) introducing a secondary school cluster model \nto  improve  education  quality  and  management.  Crosscutting  public  finance  reforms  planned \nunder  ADB\u2019s  proposed  Strengthening  Public  Finance  Management  Program26  will  support  the \nSDP  by  strengthening  the  medium-term  planning  framework  in  the  education  sector  and \nimproving the management of limited resources.  \n \n\n \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Investment and Financing Plan   \n\nOverall  program  financing.  The  overall  program  is  estimated  to  cost  $55  million \n19. \n(Table 2). ADB will provide a PBL of $10 million and a project loan of $40 million. The government \nwill provide counterpart funding of $5 million, principally in the form of in-kind contributions such \nas land, office space, and project management unit (PMU) staff.  \n \n\nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \n\nOrdinary capital resources (program) (concessional loan) \nOrdinary capital resources (project) (concessional loan) \n\nGovernment \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n \n10.0 \n40.0 \n  5.0 \n55.0 \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n\n \n18.2 \n72.7 \n9.1 \n100.0 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n20. \nProgram  financing  plan.  The  government  has  requested  a  concessional  PBL  of  $10 \nmillion from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance national education reforms. The loan \nwill have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1% per year during \n\n                                                \n\nbe built and upgraded under output 3. MOES selected the 12 districts based on (i) the high dropout rates between \nprimary  and  lower  secondary,  and  lower  secondary  and  upper  secondary  levels;  (ii)  overcrowding  in  secondary \nschools; and (iii) a large share of ethnic groups where overall school enrollment, especially for girls, is very low. \n25 Details on the European Union\u2019s policy matrix are in Summary of Linkages between the Education for Employment \nSector Development Program and European Union Budget Support (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2).  \n\n26 ADB\u2019s proposed Strengthening Public Finance Management Program will assist the Lao PDR in (i) strengthening \ndebt management and tax reforms, (ii) improving medium-term fiscal planning and budgeting, and (iii) enhancing \ncredibility of the budget. \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fthe grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement.

The  government  has  requested  a  concessional  loan  of  $40 \nmillion  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  the  project,  including  taxes  and \nduties, which will be financed by ADB. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period \nof 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  ADB  will  finance \nexpenditures  for  civil  works,  goods,  consulting  services,  capacity  development,  and  selected \nrecurrent costs. The government\u2019s counterpart contribution is estimated at $5 million equivalent, \nprincipally in-kind contributions in the form of (i) provision and basic site preparation of land at \nschool sites; (ii) secondment of selected PMU staff, and central and local services by MOES staff; \nand (iii) office accommodation and utilities for the PMU and the project implementation consultant. \nTable 2 lists the summary cost estimates.

A  background  analysis  confirms  that  increasing  secondary  school \nenrollment  and  completion  rates  will  yield  a  high  return  to  the  economy.29  For  individuals, \ncompletion  of  secondary  education  is  estimated  to  yield  a  wage  return  of  about  18%  (roughly \ndouble  that  of  primary  education  or  TVET,  though  significantly  less  than  that  of  university \ndegrees),  with  higher  wage  returns  for  women.30  This  is  consistent  with  global  evidence  that \nemployers often find it hard to get youth with the required soft skills, and that education yields the \nhighest returns for females and disadvantaged groups.31 In addition to opening access to higher-\npaying formal sector jobs, educating females breaks long-term poverty traps by lowering fertility \nrates and increasing investments in the human capital of the next generation. The overall benefits \nare  expected  to  significantly  exceed  the  SDP\u2019s  incremental  costs  (investment  and  recurrent). \nThese will peak at 2.7% of the total education budget mid-project and average 0.5% post-project, \nwhich  is  deemed  modest  and  sustainable.  The  net  present  value  of  the  project  (using  a  6% \neconomic  discount  rate)  is  conservatively  assessed  at  $333.1  million,  with  a  13.7%  economic \ninternal rate of return.32 \n \n\n \n\nSustainability \n\n24.  MOES remains committed to education reform. However, owing to the Lao PDR\u2019s high \nfiscal debt, the government\u2019s capacity to provide adequate funds for secondary education, TVET \nand higher  education  may  be  constrained.  Despite the recent  increase  in the  amount  of  block \ngrants for secondary schools, the sustainability of the project assets may be at risk due to the lack \nof  adequate  funding  for  operations  and  maintenance.  ADB\u2019s  Strengthening  Public  Finance \nManagement  Program  (footnote  26)  will  strengthen  debt  management  and  tax  reforms,  and \nmedium-term fiscal and expenditure frameworks to ensure that limited resources are aligned with \ngovernment priorities, while meeting fiscal deficit targets to promote macroeconomic stability. If \nsustained,  these  measures,  together  with  the  assistance  being  provided  by  the  International \nMonetary Fund to strengthen the revenue base, will create additional fiscal space and enable the \nLao PDR to raise (nonrecurrent) education sector spending to the required level. \n \n\n \n\nGovernance \n\n25. \nDue  diligence  reviews  confirmed  the  strong  track  record  of  MOES  in  managing  ADB \nprograms  and  projects,  including  in  the  areas  of  financial  management,  procurement,  and \nanticorruption efforts. The unmitigated financial management risk is substantial mainly because \nof inefficiencies in multi-tiered internal processes, delayed reporting and liquidation of completed \nactivities, use of multiple project finance-related data systems, and capacity gaps at schools and \nin districts. To mitigate financial management and procurement risks, MOES will recruit qualified \nfinancial management and procurement specialists to be based in the PMU. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and \nMOES. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM \n(footnote 28). \n \n\n                                                \n29 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n30 World Bank. 2013.

About  35%  of  non-Lao-Tai  females  complete  lower  secondary  education, \ncompared with 44% of non-Lao-Tai males; among the Lao-Tai, 66% of females and 63% of males \ndo so. While the country as a whole now has near gender parity in access to primary and lower \nsecondary education, a gender gap exists at the upper secondary level.34 The SDP will focus on \nareas  with  high  female  and  male  dropout  rates  and  prevalence  of  ethnic  groups.  The  gender \naction  plan  will  mainstream  gender  concerns  in  program  implementation.  The  construction  of \n60 schools (with dormitories and wash facilities) in 12 disadvantaged districts (footnote 24) will \nimprove access for girls, youth from ethnic groups, and the differently abled. MOES will prioritize \nstipend  support  for  females  and  disadvantaged  students.  The  school  facilities  will  incorporate \nresilience measures to mitigate the impacts of floods, droughts, high temperatures, and extreme \nstorm events. The design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) provides gender-disaggregated \nindicators for the outcome and outputs. The SDP is categorized gender equity theme. \n \n\n \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the safeguard categories \n\n27. \nare as follows.35 \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination  has  been  prepared \n28. \ncovering all 60 selected schools and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website.36 Project civil works are minor \nin  scope  and  limited  to  existing  school  sites.  Impacts  during  construction  will  be  localized  and \nshort-term, and can be addressed with good construction site management and practice, as set \nout  in  the  environment  management  plans.  Overall,  impacts  are  expected  to  be  beneficial, \nimproving  hygiene,  sanitation,  and  waste  management.   The  project  will  finance  a  national \nenvironmental  safeguard  consultant  to  support  the  government  in  meeting  the  safeguard \nrequirements. The  PMU  will  establish a  site-specific grievance  redress mechanism  to  manage \ncomplaints and issues during implementation. The PBL component is not anticipated to have any \nenvironmental impacts.  \n \n29. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  will  not  involve  any  involuntary \nresettlement.  ADB\u2019s  due  diligence  confirmed  that  there  will  be  no  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement impacts since all works will take place within the boundaries of existing facilities on \nstate-owned land, are free of encumbrances, and will not restrict access to lands or impinge on \npeople\u2019s livelihoods. \n \n30. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  B).  The  indigenous  peoples  plan  (ethnic  group \ndevelopment plan) ensures that (i) analysis of education\u2212employment links will be disaggregated \nby  ethnic  groups;  (ii)  new  secondary  teacher  education  curriculum  and teaching  materials  are \nsensitive  to  ethnic  group  concerns;  (iii)  dormitory  conditions  are  sensitive  to  ethnic  group \ndimensions; (iv) capacity development programs prioritize participation by ethnic group staff and \nteachers; and (v) youth from disadvantaged ethnic groups are prioritized for stipend support.  \n                                                \n33 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 ADB.

As part of \nits 2019 Article IV Consultation assessment and recommendations for the \nLao PDR, the IMF has provided guidance under which, the government is \nexpected to initiate fiscal reforms and expenditure rationalization, which \nmay impact social sector spending in the medium term.a ADB\u2019s proposed \nSPFMb will strengthen debt management and tax reforms, medium-term \nfiscal and expenditure frameworks, and budget credibility to ensure that \nlimited resources are aligned with government priorities. This will help meet \noverall fiscal deficit targets and promote macroeconomic stability. If \nsustained, these measures will create additional fiscal space to enable the \nLao PDR to raise (nonrecurrent) education sector spending to the required \nlevel, and to allocate adequate resources to operation and maintenance. \n(i)  Substantial capacity building support will be provided in the form of a PIC \n\nfirm plus individual consultants for the PMU. \n\n(ii)  MOES will requested to nominate focal points for all components to ensure \n\naccountability and timely results of capacity building and training \nworkshops.  \n\n(i) \n\nIt is expected that in the 60 secondary schools to be built and/or upgraded, \nand the 120 secondary schools to be covered under the cluster approach, \nthe teachers who undergo in-service training will be more motivated and \nable to try out improved teaching methods. \n\n(ii)  Improvements to the upper secondary curricula in priority subjects \n\n(sciences, mathematics, English, and Lao language), revised teacher \nguides, and greater use of ICT-based teaching and learning materials are \nexpected to raise the quality of training in the teacher training colleges, and \nof in-class teaching. \n\n(iii)  Reform of student assessments, and use of these results to guide design \n\nand implementation of teacher training programs, will also help. \n\n(i)  Measures taken to support advance contracting and build procurement \n\ncapacity during the design phase will help. \n\n(ii)  Substantial consulting support has been included under the program to \n\nbuild procurement capacity of MOES staff. \n\n(iii)  Relevant MOES staff will be invited to ADB workshops on procurement. \n(iv)  The PMU staff who worked under the SESDP and will continue under the \nproposed program, are familiar with ADB\u2019s procurement policies and \nprocesses. \n\n(i)  Substantial consulting support has been included under the program to \n\nbuild financial management capacity of MOES staff. \n\n(ii)  Relevant MOES staff will be invited to ADB workshops on financial \n\nmanagement. \n\n(iii)  The PMU staff, who worked under the SESDP and will continue under the \nproposed program, are familiar with ADB\u2019s financial management policies \nand processes. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  ICT  =  information  and  communication  technology,  Lao  PDR  =  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic,  MOES  =  Ministry  of  Education  and  Sports,  PIC  =  project  implementation  consultant,  PMU  = \nproject monitoring unit, SESDP = Secondary Education Sector Development Program, SPFM = Strengthening Public \nFinance Management Program, TVET = technical and vocational education and training. \n\n                                                \n37 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fa  IMF  is  also  providing  technical  assistance  support,  which  focuses  on  medium-term  revenue  strategy,  customs \n\nreforms, and development of a unified chart of accounts for improved expenditure tracking. \n\nb  ADB.
