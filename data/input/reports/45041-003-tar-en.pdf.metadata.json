THE ONGOING PROJECT \n \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) aims to support the Vientiane Sustainable Urban Transport \nProject1 through strengthening  the  capacity of  the government  to implement the high-level \ntechnology features of the ongoing project to ensure successful implementation and sustainable \noperation. Vientiane is the capital and largest city in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR). The city is experiencing ever increasing land transport congestion and related problems of \nincreased number of accidents, deteriorating air quality, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. \nThe ongoing project is designed to increase the quality of life for people in Vientiane by improving \naccess to and mobility within the city.  \n \n2.  Impact,  outcome,  and  outputs.  The  impact  of  the  ongoing  project  will  be  an \nenvironmentally sustainable and pedestrian-friendly transport system developed in Vientiane. The \noutcome will be improved urban transport operations and capacity in Vientiane. The project will \nhave five outputs:  \n \n(i)  A sustainable transport management entity for Vientiane established. The entity \nwill manage operations of systems and facilities to be developed under the project as \nwell as future sustainable transport operations.  \n(ii) High-quality bus services and bus rapid transit established and operating in \nVientiane. The project will develop 11.5 kilometers (km) of bus rapid transit (BRT) \ncorridors in the center of Vientiane, dedicated to BRT services. The new BRT buses \nwill serve a network of 84.0 kilometers of routes covering much of the city. Operation \nof the BRT buses will be tendered out to private operators.  \n(iii) Traffic management in the core area of Vientiane improved. The project will \nintroduce  measures to  improve  traffic  management so  that  traffic  moves  more \nefficiently in Vientiane.  These measures will include installing or upgrading traffic \nsignals, providing new road markings and signage, and establishing a central traffic \ncontrol center using the latest technology.  \n(iv) Paid parking system and national vehicle registration system established. A new \non-street  paid  parking  system  will  be  established  that  uses  electronic  meter \ntechnology. Also, a national electronic vehicle registration system will be established \nthat facilitates enforcement of parking regulations. Both systems will be implemented \nby private firms.  \n(v) Accessibility  for pedestrians and non-motorized transport in the core area of \nVientiane improved. The project will improve pedestrian facilities near BRT stations. \nIn addition, the project will finance the demonstration of modern electric-assist vehicles \nas a possible replacement for existing highly polluting vehicles.  \n \n3.  Financing amounts. The ongoing project costs $99.70 million, of which $35.00 million \nequivalent was approved on 10 March 2015 as a concessional loan from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to finance the project. The government also acquired (i) a loan of $15.00 million from \nthe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Fund for International Development (OFID), \n                                                 \n1 ADB.  2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to  the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and \nAdministration of Loan and Grant to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Vientiane Sustainable Urban \nTransport Project. Manila. \n \n ", "2 \n(ii) a grant of $1.84 million from the Global Environment Facility, (iii) a loan of $20.00 million from \nthe European Investment Bank, and (iv) a grant of $6.90 million equivalent from the European \nUnion\u2019s Asian Investment Facility. Private sector investment estimated at $6.41 million will finance \nthe parking system and the electronic vehicle registration system. The government will contribute \n$14.55 million, of which taxes comprise $7.13 million.  \n \n4.  Project performance. The project became effective  on 29 August  2016.2 As of 26 \nJanuary 2018, the cumulative number of contracts awarded for ADB financing is $572,400 but \nonly $261,000 has been disbursed. The urban transport advisor commenced services on 7 \nOctober 2016. As of 15 January 2018, the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) is \nrecruiting a consulting firm as project implementation consultant to undertake institutional design \nfor the new entity, detailed engineering design, project management, and implementation services. \nThe contract is expected to be awarded in Q1 2018.3 ADB and EIB fielded a joint review mission \nin January 2018 focusing on expediting project implementation. The Mission met with the Minister \nof MPWT, Vice Mayor of Vientiane, and other senior officials, and agreed with the government on \nactions to improve project implementation.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n5.  The ongoing project is complex and utilizes high-level technologies and systems that are \nnew to the Lao PDR: (i) a BRT system with centralized control center, (ii) a smart parking fee \ncollection system, (iii) an electronic vehicle registration system, an intelligent transport system for \ntraffic  management,  and  (iv)  non-motorized  transport  vehicles.  The  ongoing  project  has \nexperienced  the  following  issues: (i)  delays  in  declaring  effectiveness and  recruitment of \nconsultants, and (ii) the difficulty in decision making due to lack of knowledge among decision \nmakers.  The  TRTA  will  address  these  issues  by  financing  capacity  development  and \nimplementation support for the decision makers.  \n \n6.  The ongoing project includes implementation support and capacity building for the project \ncoordination unit through the assistance of project consultants and mobilization of a quality control \nconsultant to support the operation  of the new transport management entity  (para.  2[i]) in \nmonitoring operators of the bus and parking companies.  However, it has become apparent that \nmore capacity building will be needed than was anticipated during project processing to ensure \nfor the project\u2019s timely and efficient implementation. The decision makers in the government need \nup-to-date  knowledge of technical  and operational  aspects of  urban transport  management \nentities to be able to manage the implementation of the project and continue managing the system \nafter  project  completion.  While  the  project  envisions  contracting  out  key  tasks to  private \ncompanies on an ongoing basis, getting good performance out of the private companies requires \nthat the government understands what they need out of these companies and how to get it. \nCapacity building  need  for the  government is thus paramount in  ensuring  efficient project \nimplementation and sustainable operation after physical completion.  Given these needs, this \nTRTA will focus on strengthening (i) institutional  capacity for the establishment of the new \n                                                 \n2  The delay in declaring ADB loan and Global Environment Facility grant effectiveness was due to the delay in meeting \nthe financing agreements\u2019 cross-effectiveness condition, which required that all the cofinancing loans and grants \nmust have met their own effectiveness conditions before the ADB loan and Global Environment Facility could be \ndeclared effective. \n3  The award of the contract has been delayed due to the time required to address representations were made by two \nof the bidders. \n ", "3 \ntransport entity, (ii) knowledge of new technologies and systems among decision makers, and (iii) \ncapacity of the new transport entity.     \n \n7.  First, institutional capacity for the establishment of the new urban transport entity should \nbe strengthened. The establishment of this new entity is essential to the success of the project \nsince it is expected to (i) manage private sector firms providing services, (ii) ensure that services \nprovided are of high quality, (iii) manage daily operation of the system, (iv) plan and implement \nfuture development of the system, and (v) communicate with the public and key stakeholders. \nAlthough project consultants will support implementation, the executing agency needs to take \nlegal, fiscal, and political actions and coordination among related authorities will be required to \nestablish the new entity. The TA will help facilitate the discussion among the related authorities \nso that they  understand  and  comply with  the legal,  fiscal, and political  processes for the \nestablishment of the new transport management entity.   \n \n8.  Second, knowledge of new technologies and systems among the decision makers should \nbe augmented. The project coordination unit will prepare proposed plans and designs for each \noutput component of the project with help from the project consultants. Since these proposals \ninclude technologies and systems new to the Lao PDR, the decision-makers in the executing \nagency and the related government authorities who will review and evaluate them need to be \nknowledgeable of current technology and operation models. Therefore, the knowledge of new \ntechnologies and systems, e.g., merits and demerits, potential risks, and alternative options, \nshould be developed  among the decision makers in the executing  agency and the related \ngovernment authorities to create the foundation for timely and appropriate decision making. The \nsupport provided by TA consultants to reviewing and evaluating the proposals will also help to \ndevelop the capacity of the decision makers.   \n \n9.  Third, it is crucial for the  new entity to strengthen  its knowledge on urban transport \nmanagement. The new entity will manage the daily operation of the public transport systems, \nmanage the private firms operating the BRT, parking, and vehicle registration systems, and plan \nfor the future development of the system. The knowledge of the staff in the new entity should \nmatch that of the private firms and be sufficient for daily operation and future development. Since \nthe project will install technologies and systems that are new to the Lao PDR, staff in the new \nentity will not have experience with them. Therefore, intensive capacity building is needed for the \nstaff of the new entity.  \n \n10.  The government has requested ADB\u2019s help to address capacity building.4 This TA is \nincluded in the country operations business plan for Lao PDR, 2018\u20132020.5    \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n11.  The TA  will  ensure the  effective  implementation of  the project and  the sustainable \noperation of the facilities developed through the capacity building of government staff. The TA will \nsupplement  the  capacity  building  services  contracted  under  the  ongoing  project  and  TA \nconsultants will regularly coordinate with project consultants to avoid duplication of efforts. While \nthe project consultants will be focused on providing organizational management and project \nadministration support to the day-to-day  operations of the project coordination unit,  the TA \nconsultants will focus mainly on capacity building of the key government officials involved in the \ndecision-making process, the stakeholders critical to the project\u2019s success, and the staff of the \n                                                 \n4 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 October 2017. \n5 ADB. 2017.

ADB\u2019s project team and the project coordination unit will organize periodic meetings \nbetween TA consultants and the project consultants and/or contractors to achieve effective \ncoordination.    \n  \n12.  Output 1: Up-to-date knowledge on tasks and legal structure of traffic management \nentity shared among relevant government agencies.  The component will provide up-to-date \nknowledge of tasks and legal structures of the urban transport management entity to related \nauthorities, including the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of \nHome Affairs, Traffic Police,  and Vientiane  Authority.  First, the latest and advanced  urban \ntransport entities in other countries will be studied, and the TA will organize study tours for the \ngovernment officials to the relevant countries (though the travel cost for the government officials \nwill not be financed by the TA).  Based on the study, the TA will propose options for legal form \nand tasks of the new entity under the current legal and public administrative environment in the \nLao PDR. The TA will also facilitate discussion among the relevant authorities to help them build \na common understanding. The components will be implemented during 2018.   \n \n13.  Output 2:  Knowledge of advanced technologies and  systems  among  decision \nmakers developed. Knowledge will be developed through workshops, seminars, and individual \ncommunications held in 2018. In addition, supplemental workshops and/or seminars will be held \nin 2019 and 2020 to strengthen the knowledge. The knowledge building will include (i) the new \nbus system: design and operation of BRT, and coordination of BRT and existing bus service; (ii)  \ntraffic management: the latest methods and equipment for traffic management, and the role of the \ntraffic management center;  (iii) on-street parking management: the latest fee collection system \nand enforcement of fee levying; (iv) electronic vehicle registration system: the latest electronic \nvehicle registration system and the function of the vehicle registration system;  (v) public\u2013private \npartnership (PPP): the structure and potential risks of the project\u2019s PPP; (vi) gender: why gender \nmatters in  urban  transport  and  how  to  address  gender  in  urban  transport  planning  and \nmanagement; and (vii) communication, marketing, branding, and advertising and their role. The \nlearning materials for each field will be prepared both in English and Lao for future decision \nmakers. The TA will also provide support in reviewing and evaluating the proposals prepared by \nthe project consultants.  \n \n14.  Output 3: Capacity of the newly established entity on urban transport management \ndeveloped. The new entity will (i) manage the private sector firms operating BRT and the parking \nand vehicle registration system; (ii) ensure the high quality of service; (iii) manage the daily \noperations of the public transport system; and (iv) plan for future development of the system. The \nTA will develop the capacity of the new entity through workshops, seminars, and training. The \ncapacity building will include, but not limited to (i) the operation and maintenance of BRT; (ii) \noperation and fee collection of on-street parking; (iii) structure and risks of vehicle registration \nsystem; (iv) operation of traffic management system; (v) latest non-motorized transport (NMT) \nvehicles  and  pedestrian  friendly  design;  (vi)  gender  issues  in  urban  transport  planning, \nmanagement, and employment; (vii) options for the concession arrangement for the PPP and \npotential risks of the PPP concessions; (viii) the roles and measures of communication, marketing, \nbranding, and advertising; and (ix) the organizational operation and management of the new entity. \nCapacity building will be implemented after the entity is established and staff are hired in 2020.  \nAlso, the learning materials for future staff will be prepared both in English and Lao.     \n \n ", "5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.
