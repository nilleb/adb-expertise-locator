THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) for the Chuuk Water Supply and Sanitation Project. \n \n2.  The project will improve the water supply and sanitation service on Weno Island, the \nadministrative center of Chuuk State. It will also contribute to reducing the transmission of the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) and other hygiene-related and waterborne diseases through \nincreased access to safe water and an improved sanitation service. A project readiness financing \ngrant was approved in 2019 to prepare the project and facilitate a smooth transition to project \nimplementation.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development context. The latest official population estimate for the FSM is 103,000, of \nwhom 49,000 people live in Chuuk.2 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) classified the FSM a \nfragile and conflict-affected situation in 2019. Since the country gained independence from the \nUnited States (US) administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands in 1986, the FSM has \noperated under a Compact of Free Association with the US. Under the Compact, the FSM citizens \nhave the right to reside and work in the US without visas. This has resulted in the depletion of \nskilled labor and a declining population, as people move to the US. The 2010 US census reported \nthat 8,185 people identified their country of origin as the FSM, half of whom identified their origin \nas Chuuk.3 ADB estimated the FSM\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) at $3,427 per person in \nFY2019, with GDP growth from FY2015\u2013FY2019 averaging 1.9% per annum. The primary \nsources of income in the FSM are the sale of fishing rights (about $73.3 million in 2019) and taxes. \nSubsistence economic activities account for about 15% of the FSM\u2019s GDP. In urban centers, the \neconomy  is  centered  on  government  employment  and  a  small  commercial  segment.  ADB \nestimates the FSM\u2019s economy to have contracted by 5.4% in FY2020 and forecasts a further \ncontraction of 1.8% in FY2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2013\u20132014 FSM \nHousehold Expenditure and Income Survey noted that poverty levels in Chuuk were the highest \nin the FSM, with 45.5% of the population falling below the total poverty line of $1,217 per adult \nper year annually and 16.2% of adults receiving less than the food poverty line of $1.72 per day.4 \n \n4.  Vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change. The FSM is highly vulnerable to \nnatural hazards, particularly tropical storms and droughts, and is susceptible to climate change \nimpacts. In 2002, Tropical Storm Chata\u2019an caused severe flooding and landslides that killed \n47 people on Weno Island. In 2015, Typhoon Maysak struck the states of Chuuk and Yap, causing \nfour deaths and damaging houses, crops, and public infrastructure (estimated at 4% of the \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2019. Project Readiness Financing Report: Preparing the Chuuk Water Supply and \nSanitation Project in the Federated States of Micronesia. Manila. The project readiness financing grant financed \nfeasibility studies and due diligence, and supported the establishment of the project management unit (PMU). The \ngrant will also finance the preparation of bidding documents. \n2  FSM Office of Statistics, Budget, Overseas Development Assistance and Compact Management. 2011. FSM 2010 \nCensus of Population and Housing. Palikir. \n3  More recent data are unavailable. The 2010 FSM Census (footnote 2) also noted that about 30% of Chuuk \nhouseholds had family members residing in Guam and Hawaii. \n4  Government of the FSM, Office of Statistics, Budget, Overseas Development Assistance and Compact Management. \n2014. Household Income and Expenditure Survey, 2013\u20132014. Palikir.  \n ", "2 \ncountry\u2019s GDP).5 Chuuk State experienced three major droughts from 2016 to 2020, which \nresulted in Weno\u2019s surface water sources drying up and stress on groundwater resources. \nClimate change projections show that temperatures will continue to rise in the FSM, as will the \nsea level and ocean acidification.6 The intensity and frequency of days of extreme rainfall and \ndrought are also projected to rise, increasing the need for infrastructure that is resilient to climate \nchange and disasters. \n \n5.  Access to water supply and sanitation services. Weno is the largest urban center in \nthe state, with a population of about 14,000 residing in 2,100 households (footnote 2). The \naverage annual population growth rate of Chuuk State is estimated at 0.1% and its population is \nprojected to increase to 50,000 by 2025, with most of the growth in Weno. Access to public water \nsupplies and sanitation services is limited. A household socioeconomic survey conducted for the \nproject in June 2020 reported the sources of household water as rainwater tanks (55%), wells \n(18%), the public water supply system (12%), streams (9%), and bottled water and other sources \n(6%). Rainwater harvesting is not secure because of seasonal rainfall patterns and more frequent \nand severe dry periods caused by climate change. The survey also reported that 23% of Weno \nhouseholds had an indoor flush toilet connected to the sewer system, 42% of Weno households \nhad an indoor flush toilet connected to a septic tank or cesspit, 20% used pit toilets, and 15% had \nno access to sanitation facilities and resorted to open defecation.  \n \n6.  Utility performance. Chuuk Public Utility Corporation (CPUC) is mandated under the \nChuuk Public Utility Corporation Act, 1996 to deliver electricity, water supply, and sewerage \nservices; and to collect water, sewer, and electricity tariffs based on meter readings. The CPUC\u2019s \nperformance  has  improved  significantly  since  institutional  reforms  were  initiated  under  the \nADB-financed Omnibus Infrastructure Development Project in 2010.7 The CPUC fully recovered \nits  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  depreciation,  and  debt  servicing  costs  in  FY2019, \ngenerating a profit from utility service tariff collection for the first time in its history. The CPUC \ndoes not receive any subsidies from the Chuuk State or national governments. Most of its revenue \ncomes from electricity sales, while water and sewerage operation income totaled only 6% of gross \nCPUC revenue in 2019. The CPUC relies on internal cross-subsidies from electricity sales to \ncover the water supply and sewerage O&M costs.8 It plans to make water supply and sewerage \noperations financially more independent from the cross-subsidies. The CPUC has prepared a \nnew  water  and  sewage  tariff  framework  to  increase  revenue  collection  which  will  be  fully \nimplemented by 31 December 2023. The laws and associated regulations under which the CPUC \noperates are also outdated and require amendment to reflect utility governance best practices. \n \n7.  The CPUC water supply system on Weno serves 378 residential customers (about \n2,300 people) and 101 commercial and government customers. The CPUC produces 2,500 cubic \nmeters of water per day (m3/day), of which 95% is groundwater extracted from 14 deep wells. The \nbalance is surface water taken from Pou River and treated at the Pou water treatment plant. The \nCPUC plans to increase its water supply service coverage by expanding its service from more \nsurface water resources, which will reduce the reliance on groundwater and rainwater harvesting, \nand lower pumping costs. Since the Pou River has reached its sustainable yield, the CPUC has \nidentified the Wichen River as a new source with sufficient surface water for future water supply \nexpansion. \n \n5  International  Monetary  Fund.  2017.

Manila. \n8  In 2019, the CPUC recovered 66% of its combined water supply and sewerage O&M costs from revenue. \n ", "3 \n8.  Nonrevenue water (NRW) is high in Weno. In 2019, water sales averaged 1,020 m3/day \nout  of  2,500 m3/day  production; the  balance  (60%)  was  NRW,  partially  because  of  illegal \nconnections. The CPUC conducted a survey of water connections in Weno in March 2019 and \nfound that the unrecorded (or illegal) connections outnumbered legal connections. The CPUC is \nimplementing a program to reduce NRW and increase revenue by (i) optimizing its water supply \noperations and recording all connections, and (ii) strengthening its water leak detection capacity \nto minimize physical water losses. \n \n9.  Weno\u2019s sewerage network has 384 recorded connections of residential households and \n106 commercial and government customers. Collected sewage is treated at the tertiary Weno \nwastewater treatment plant, which has a capacity of 2,700 m3/day, and then discharged into \nChuuk Lagoon through an ocean outfall. Some sewage pumping stations are in poor condition, \nbecause of limited preventative maintenance, and require rehabilitation. The CPUC has made \ncontinuous improvements to Weno\u2019s sewer system since 2011. However, further investment is \nrequired  to  (i)  expand the  sewer  system  and connections,  (ii)  reduce  the  stormwater  and \ngroundwater infiltration to optimize the sewer system operation, and (iii) upgrade the pump \nstations. Beyond the sewer system service area, septic tanks and pit toilets are widely used, \nparticularly among poor communities. These discharge sewage randomly into shallow aquifers \nand  contaminate  Weno\u2019s  groundwater  sources.  Consequently,  diarrhea,  particularly  among \ninfants, is endemic for households using shallow wells for drinking water. An average of 847 cases \nof diarrhea were reported annually in Weno from 2014 to 2018. 9 \n \n10.  The CPUC plans to support community-wide hygiene awareness and education activities \nto  foster  improved  hygiene  behavior\u2014to  prevent  contact  transmissible  diseases  such  as                \nCOVID-19. The hygiene awareness and education activities will be delivered under ADB\u2019s \nregional technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Practices \nand Hygiene Behavioral Change in the Pacific.10 The TA will enhance the project\u2019s outcome. \nAccess to sanitation facilities will ease constraints on women related to access to sanitation, \nhealth, and hygiene; and will reduce medical costs related to waterborne and other infectious \ndiseases. \n \n11.  Alignment with Strategy 2030. The project will contribute to goal 6 of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals to ensure  access to  water  and  sanitation  for  all. It  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 operational priorities: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; \n(ii) accelerating progress in gender equality; (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; (iv) making cities more livable; \nand (v) strengthening governance and institutional capacity.11 The project is included in the \ncountry operations business plan for 11 small Pacific island countries, 2020\u20132022.12 It is also \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020 strategic priority to strengthen institutional \ncapacities, promote sound public sector management, and improve health and social protection \nservices.13 \n \n \n9  Chuuk Department of Health statistics indicate that Weno Hospital and Weno medical clinics report on average one \ncase of diarrhea annually for every 16 people living in Weno. \n10 ADB. 2020.

The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) sustainable development of social and \neconomic infrastructure promoted through the provision and utilization of cost-effective, safe, \nreliable,  and  sustainable  infrastructure;14  and  (ii)  Chuuk  State  infrastructure  needs  toward \nsustainable development are met and maintained.15 The project will have the following outcome: \nefficiency, climate change and disaster resiliency, and sustainability of safe water and sanitation \nimproved in Chuuk State.16 The project will have the following three outputs: \n \n13.  Output 1: Continuous and safe water supplies provided. Output 1 will (i) install new \nwater supply connections to increase the number of households with legal access to the CPUC \nwater supply network to 1,000 households (48% of Weno households) or more; 17 (ii) construct 10 \nkilometers of new water mains to replace dilapidated water mains and expand the water supply \nnetworks to cover more households; (iii) develop a new surface water intake on the Wichen River, \nwith an associated 1,000 m3/day water treatment plant; (iv) recommission deep wells and develop \nnew deep wells in the Wichap\u2013Epinup area to supply the southern area of Weno; (v) improve the \nwater supply network efficiency, including the connection of deep wells to centralized water \nreservoirs and the construction of a booster station (at Sapuk); and (vi) reduce NRW to 30% or \nless by installing and replacing customer meters with prepaid water meters, installing real-time \nnetwork monitoring equipment, and repairing or replacing leaking water mains. \n \n14.  Output 2: Effective, efficient, and safe sanitation provided. Output 2 will (i) install new \nsewer connections, free of charge, to increase the number of households connected to the CPUC \nsewer system to at least 750 households (36% of Weno households, footnote 17); (ii) develop \nand implement a wastewater inflow and infiltration management program; (iii) construct 2.8 \nkilometers of sewage pipes to expand and rehabilitate the pipe system; and (iv) rehabilitate 2 \nsewage pumping stations and 11 sewage grinder stations. Output 2 will also facilitate regular \nsludge removal from onsite sanitation facilities by (i) mandating septic tank construction and \noperations standards, (ii) developing a cost recovery framework for desludging of onsite sanitation \nfacilities, and (iii) facilitating private sector participation in desludging operations. The CPUC will \nstrengthen its septic tank desludging operations and treat the septic tank sludge at the Weno \nwastewater treatment plant. \n \n15.  Output  3:  Chuuk  Public  Utility  Corporation  made  financially  and  technically \nsustainable. Output 3 will assist the CPUC to strengthen its technical and financial sustainability \nthrough water supply and sewerage system operator training programs and asset management \ntraining programs. Output 3 will also assist the CPUC to fully implement its new tariff framework \nby 31 December 2023 to enable it to recover water supply and sewer O&M costs. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s value added includes (i) bringing project readiness financing to accelerate project \nreadiness and enable the CPUC\u2019s institutional capacity, (ii) strengthening gender mainstreaming, \nand (iii) providing CPUC capacity building.

The FSM Department of Finance and Administration will be the executing agency for the \nproject. The CPUC will be the implementing agency. A project management unit (PMU) is \nestablished in the CPUC, with CPUC personnel, and is responsible for project implementation, \nincluding all procurement. A planning and procurement risk assessment has been undertaken \nand has guided the procurement planning. The procurement of project components through open \ncompetitive bidding procedures will be done through e-procurement. A consulting firm has been \nrecruited under the ongoing project readiness financing grant (footnote 1) to prepare bidding \ndocuments  for  works  and  goods.  Bidding  for  the  project\u2019s  major  contracts  is  expected  to \ncommence in August 2021. \n \n20.  COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the closure of the FSM borders since \nMarch 2020. It is uncertain when the FSM borders will reopen, but the reopening is envisaged to \nbe in stages. The government has prioritized the water and sanitation project to prevent the virus \nfrom spreading and help the economic recovery. The 7-year implementation period will provide \nsome  flexibility  for  delays.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  The project design uses a technically viable approach to improve access to water supply \nand sanitation services on Weno Island. Engineering designs are built on comprehensive studies, \nincluding water supply and sanitation feasibility studies.  Additional water demand from the \nexpansion of the CPUC\u2019s water customer base will be met by (i) reducing NRW; (ii) enhancing \nwater conservation management, including installing prepaid water meters; and (iii) expanding \nthe water production capacity. The existing wastewater treatment plant on Weno Island has \nsufficient capacity to cater for additional connections. The infiltration management program will \nreduce the rainwater and groundwater infiltration into the sewer system, lower the hydraulic loads \nto the wastewater treatment, and save the pumping costs. \n \nB.

Economic  analyses  were  undertaken  for  the  water  and  sewerage  components  by \ncomparing the discounted costs and benefits under the with- and without-project scenarios for \nFY2021\u2013FY2052 in constant 2020 prices. Both components were found to be viable compared \nwith an economic opportunity cost of capital of 6.0%, deemed appropriate for fragile and conflict-\naffected situations including the FSM. The water supply component have an economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) of 6.3% and an economic net present value (ENPV) of $0.31 million, while \nthe sewerage component have an EIRR of 6.2% and an ENPV of $0.07 million. The overall project \nhas an EIRR of 6.3% and an ENPV of $0.4 million.20 \n \n23.  Financial analysis was also undertaken using with- and without-project scenarios for \nFY2021\u2013FY2052, with no residual value assumed at the end of this period. Costs included \nconsultancy services as well as  the recurrent replacement costs of capital equipment, but \nexcluded price contingencies. The proposed investments are found to be financially viable against \na weighted average cost of capital estimated at 1.1%. The water supply components have a \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 2.0% and a financial net present value (FNPV) of \n$1.33 million,  while  the  sanitation  components  have  an  FIRR  of  1.2%  and  an  FNPV  of \n$0.04 million. The overall project has an FIRR of 1.7% and an FNPV of $1.4 million, and will \ndeliver a positive cash flow for the project\u2019s water supply and sewerage components beginning in \nFY2025.21 The sensitivity analysis indicates that the CPUC\u2019s future price path would be a major \nfactor in financial performance. Implementing planned tariff increases will help ensure viability. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n24.  To ensure the technical sustainability of the project, the infrastructure will be designed and \nbuilt using climate-proofed approaches and durable materials. Projected climate change impacts \nare considered, including longer and more severe droughts; sea level rise; and increased rainfall \nvariability, both seasonally and annually, which is likely to cause flash floods and landslides. \nThe reduction of NRW will increase water availability for households, conserve water resources, \nand reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. The installation of prepaid water meters \nand  real-time  network monitoring  equipment  will  also  lead  to  potential  water  conservation. \nThe upgrading of water sources will further balance the use of groundwater and surface water \nresources in the CPUC\u2019s portfolio and reduce the climate-related risks. In parallel, to ensure \n \n20 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nsustainability from the customer or user perspective, ADB regional TA (footnote 10) will deliver a \nprogram to promote good hygiene practices, water conservation, and the importance of paying \ntariffs in the communities. Overall, the project\u2019s financial sustainability will be ensured through \n(i) improving the CPUC\u2019s operational efficiency to minimize operating costs, (ii) expanding the \nCPUC\u2019s customer base to increase revenues, and (iii) promoting a regulated water and sewage \ntariff and ensuring the service affordability. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n25.  The financial management capacity of the CPUC has improved substantially since 2009, \nand the external entity audits for FY2017 and FY2018 did not identify any material weaknesses \nor deficiencies in the internal financial controls. A financial management assessment of the \nCPUC, conducted in October 2019, concluded that (i) the utility\u2019s financial management practices \nare sound, (ii) staff levels are appropriate for an organization of its size, and (iii) processes and \nprocedures are well documented. Weaknesses found relate to (i) the CPUC\u2019s lack of experience \nin directly implementing investment projects financed by multilateral development banks, and \n(ii) insufficient  capacity  to  absorb  the  significant  increase  in  the  workload  during  the \nimplementation  of  the  investment  project.  To  address  these  weaknesses,  consultants  with \nexperience in ADB disbursement and procurement procedures will be engaged under the project. \nThe CPUC will also engage additional staff and consultants to address the increasing workload. \nThe financial management assessment concluded that the CPUC\u2019s financial management risk is \nmoderate and its procurement risk is moderate. \n \n26.  The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is moderate mainly because of \nthe absence of (i) negative news articles, (ii) CPUC executives who are sanctioned by the United \nNations or ADB, and (iii) CPUC executives who are sanctioned by the US Office of Foreign Assets \nControl. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  CPUC.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n27.  The project will indirectly reduce poverty by extending potable water and sanitation \nservices, particularly to informal settlements. Poor quality drinking water has increased the \ndisease burden, with negative economic consequences that disproportionately affect women, the \npoor, and vulnerable sections of society. Households without proper toilet facilities are more \nexposed to the risk of waterborne diseases. This significantly affects productivity and family health \nexpenditures. Other social and poverty issues in the country include (i) unemployment, with 45% \nof youth unemployed; (ii) lack of skills and expertise resulting from poor quality education and \ninadequate training; (iii) poor transport infrastructure, leading to isolation and poor access to \nmarkets;  and  (iv)  gender  inequality,  resulting  in  high  rates  of  violence  against  women. \nThe government\u2019s  National  Development  Strategy  addresses  many  of  these  issues;  and \ndevelopment partners are supporting health, education, and transport reforms.  \n \n28.  Gender equality. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. The gender \naction  plan  for  the  project  has  clear  targets,  responsibilities,  and  resource  allocations.22 \nThe project will increase the number of households with access to continuous potable piped water \nthrough metered connections to about 1,000 , including 200 households headed by women.. This \nwill reduce the drudgery of women and girls\u2019 time poverty and free up time for other activities, \n \n22 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nincluding attending school. The project will increase the number of households with legal access \nto the Weno sewerage system to 750, including 150 households headed by women, thereby \nproviding gender-sensitive sanitation to women and their households. Specific gender design \nfeatures  include  (i)  supporting  women\u2019s  employment;  (ii) hygiene  awareness  and  behavior \ncampaigns and training for households on willingness to pay for services, including household \ndiscussions on women\u2019s role in water collection and preparation; (iii) providing gender-specific \ntoilet facilities at markets, the domestic port, and state events; (iv) appointing women to decision-\nmaking positions and providing support for leadership training aimed at women; (v) adopting and \nimplementing a gender strategy in the CPUC; and (vi) implementing a CPUC gender-sensitive \nwater tariff framework and reviewing it annually. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows:23 \n \n30.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination was prepared for the \nproject  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.24  The  project  provides  positive \nenvironmental benefits by ensuring an adequate supply of safe water and improved sanitation for \nthe residents of Weno. Adverse environmental impacts of the project will be site-specific and \nlargely related to construction activities, which are expected to be minimal for land-based works \nand for which mitigation measures can be readily implemented. The environmental management \nplan outlines the risks and mitigating actions to be undertaken during project implementation. \nThe CPUC\u2019s environmental management capacity is limited, and an international specialist will \nbe engaged through the project to support the CPUC\u2019s implementation and monitoring of the \nenvironmental management plan, and to strengthen the CPUC\u2019s environmental management \ncapacity. \n \n31.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B)  and  indigenous  peoples  (category  C). \nA resettlement plan was prepared for the project. The project affects about 23,300 square meters \n(m2) and requires the acquisition of about 7,500 m2 of land reservoirs and pump stations. \nThe balance of the impacted land (about 15,800 m2) is within existing reserves and easements \nand state-owned land. Non-land impacts are associated with some gardens and crops, and \ntemporary impacts on nonresidential structures that could be reestablished once the works are \ncompleted. About 18 persons will be affected. This will be confirmed following the detailed design \nand during the update of the resettlement plan. CPUC has consulted with the affected persons \nand the consultations will continue during project implementation. The CPUC has disclosed the \ndraft safeguard documents. The CPUC will finance, implement, and monitor the resettlement plan. \nThe PMU, which includes a social safeguards specialist, will support the CPUC and the CPUC \nland management officer in implementing the resettlement plan, and provide safeguard capacity \nbuilding to CPUC staff. The project is not expected to have a negative impact on any distinct or \nvulnerable group of indigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nG.
