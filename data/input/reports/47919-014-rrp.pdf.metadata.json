Until 2006, the country\u2019s electricity demand surpassed total supply, so the balance \nneeded  to  be  imported.  However,  in  2007,  supply  exceeded  total  demand  as  a  result  of  the \nGovernment  of  Georgia\u2019s  effort  to  increase  the  generation  capacity  of  hydropower  plants,  and \nGeorgia has since become an electricity exporter.2 While Georgia imports electricity in winter when \nsupply  is  low,  it  has  significant  excess  generation  in  summer,  and  the  volume  of  exports  is \nincreasing  each  year.  In  view  of  its  rich  but  underdeveloped  hydro  resources,  Georgia  has  set  a \nstrategic  goal  to  become  a  regional  energy  hub  by  trading  energy  with  neighboring  countries. \nAmong others, Turkey is the most attractive given its peak demand in summer  (when  demand  in \nGeorgia is lower), projected capacity shortfall, and higher electricity market prices. The government \nis  hence  promoting  development  of  new  hydropower  plants.  The  proposed  project  is  the  second \nprivate  hydropower  plant  designed  for  energy  export  and  the  first  to  be  financed  on  a  limited \nrecourse basis. \n \nIn March 2013, Tata Power Company Limited (Tata Power) and Clean Energy Invest (CEI \n3. \nand, collectively with Tata Power, the sponsors), approached the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto request a loan for the project. Such request was made based on ADB\u2019s long partnership history \nwith  Tata  Power  and  the  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC),  and  ADB\u2019s  experience  in \nfinancing private hydropower projects. The project team also had a preliminary discussion with the \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which was also approached by the \nsponsors.  Through  these  initial  discussions,  the  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  believed \nthat  the  project  possesses  sound  fundamentals,  ADB\u2019s  participation  will  bring  significant \ndevelopmental benefits and demonstration impact, financing from ADB is absolutely necessary to \nmake the project happen, and the success of the project will send an important signal to the market \nand help build confidence for private sector participation in Georgia\u2019s hydropower development and \ncross-border energy trade. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n4. \nThe  project  involves  the  construction,  operation,  and maintenance  of two separate  run-of-\nriver hydropower plants operating in a cascade with a total capacity of 185 megawatts (MW). The \nproject  facilities  include  one  weir  on  the  Chirukhistsqali  River,  two  dams  with  reservoirs  on  the \nAdjaristsqali River and Skhalta River, three tunnels with a total length of 32.7 kilometers, and two \nhydropower plants. The main hydropower plant will be constructed on the Adjaristsqali River near \nShuakhevi village utilizing water collected from the Chirukhistsqali, Skhalta, and Adjaristsqali rivers; \n\n                                                      \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources of Georgia. 2010. Energy Sector of Georgia. Tbilisi. \n\n \n\n\fand a small hydropower plant will be constructed at Skhalta village utilizing water diverted from the \nChirukhistsqali River. \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsors \n\nThe borrower is Adjaristsqali Georgia LLC (AGL), a special purpose vehicle to be owned by \n\n5. \nCEI, Tata Power, and IFC.  \n \nCEI was established in 2010 as a single purpose company to develop the project.  \n6. \nTata Power is India\u2019s largest integrated power corporation in the private sector. While most \n7. \nof its operations are in India, it is planning to expand overseas business. It is also increasing clean \nenergy investments, with a target of 20%\u201325% of its portfolio by 2020. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\nin \n\ntrading \n\n8. \nSuccessful  implementation  of  the  project  will  provide  further  impetus  to  hydropower \ndevelopment in Georgia by catalyzing more private sector investment and increasing cross-border \nenergy \nthe  region.  Georgia  has  rich  hydropower  resources,  and  successful \nimplementation  of  the  project  will  not  only  act  as  a  template  for  further  hydropower  development \nbut  also  foster  confidence  among  potential  investors  and  lenders  and  promote  further  private \nsector investment in the country\u2019s hydropower sector overall. This will help alleviate the country\u2019s \ndependence  on  imported  fossil  fuel  through  the  utilization  of  clean  and  sustainable  indigenous \nwater  resources.  Low-cost  surplus  energy  can  be  exported  to  neighboring  countries\u2014increasing \nenergy trade in the region, and fostering regional cooperation and integration. The project will also \ngenerate  additional  revenues  for  Georgia  through  energy  trade  with  Turkey.  The  government\u2019s \nearnings  from  royalties  and  taxes  related  to  energy  export  can  be  used  for  other  priority \nexpenditures of Georgia to promote economic growth and improve social services. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome  \n\n9. \nThe  project\u2019s  outcome  is  increased  production  and  export  of  hydropower.  The  project  will \nproduce the additional electricity of 450 gigawatt-hours per annum from 2017 onward. The project \nwill  avoid  greenhouse  gas  emissions  equal  to  200,000  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  per  year  of \noperation. Furthermore, revenue of $67.9 million is expected for the government through royalties \nand  indirect  taxes,  which  can  be  used  for  other  priority  expenditures  of  Georgia  to  promote \neconomic growth and improve social services. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nThe  output  is  the  construction  and  successful  commissioning  of  a  185  MW  hydropower \nproject by 2017. The plant is expected to create local employment opportunities in excess of 600 \njobs  during  construction  and  over  50  jobs  after  commissioning  in  southern  Georgia,  an  area  of \nparticular development concern to ADB. \n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\nThe project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.3 The project addresses two of the three \n11. \nstrategic agendas of Strategy 2020\u2014environmentally sustainable growth and regional cooperation \nand integration. \n \n12. \nThe  first  country  partnership  strategy  for  Georgia  is  being  prepared.  Meanwhile,  ADB \noperations  in  the  country  continue  to  be  guided  by  the  interim  operational  strategy,  2008\u20132009, \nwhich  has  identified  ADB\u2019s  operational  priorities  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  development \nagenda.4 Development  and  utilization  of  the  considerable  domestic  hydropower  potential  is  a  top \npriority.  Georgia  has  significant  renewable  energy  resources,  especially  hydropower  and \ngeothermal.  The  project  will  strengthen  Georgia\u2019s  energy  security  by  adding  more  generating \ncapacity using its indigenous hydro resource, particularly during the winter months when there are \ndomestic energy supply shortfalls. \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n13. \nThe project is fully consistent with the ADB Energy Policy (2009), which promotes effective \nregional cooperation and integration in the energy sector to strengthen energy security. The policy \nstresses  the  importance  of  harnessing  energy  efficiency,  which  is  essential  to  improve  energy \nsecurity and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.5 \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n14. \n \n\nTable 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements.  \n\nTable 3: Summary Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nArrangements \nThe build\u2013own\u2013operate (BOO) agreement is between the Ministry of Energy and Natural \nResources of Georgia,  Adjaristsqali Georgia LLC (AGL), and its shareholders. Under the \nBOO agreement, the government allows AGL to develop the  project on a BOO basis for \nthe duration of plant life (20 years) plus a 4-year construction period. The BOO agreement \nprovides such terms as priority access to the transmission lines, usage of water, and other \nrights and obligations of AGL and the government during the construction and operations \nphases that are typical for a project of this type. \n \nSupervised  by  Clean  Energy  Invest  (CEI)  and  Tata  Power;  Tata  Power  has  over \n8,500 megawatts  (MW)  of  power  development  and  operational  experience,  including \nrenewables and cross-border hydropower. CEI has extensive knowledge and skill sets in \nthe engineering and operation of hydropower plants. \n \n\nThe  project  will  be  executed  under  two  separate  contracts  of  civil  works  and \nelectromechanical  works,  both  of  which  have  been  awarded  following  international \ncompetitive  bidding.  The  detailed  design  and  supervision  will  be  provided  by \nMott MacDonald from the United Kingdom, the owner\u2019s engineer. New transmission lines \nto evacuate electricity from the project will be the responsibility of the government. \n \n\nThe  project  is  designed  as  a  day-peak  plant.  Its  power  will  be  evacuated  using  a  60 \nkilometer 220 kilovolt transmission line to Batumi, after which it will be sold to the Turkish \n\nManagement \n\nConstruction Arrangements \nType of arrangement \n\nOperations Arrangements \nRevenue structure \n\n                                                      \n3   ADB. 2008.

For  the  remaining  3  months,  the  electricity  will  be  sold  in \nGeorgia  to  either  private  distribution  companies  or  to  the  Electricity  System  Commercial \nOperator  at  the  best  available  price.  However,  after  the  first  10  years  of  operation,  AGL \nwill be free to sell all its power in the Turkish market. \n \n\n \nKey  performance  indicators,  including  output  and  outcome  indicators,  compliance  with \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) safeguard requirements, construction progress, updates, \nand  financial  performance  during  operation,  will  be  reported  by  AGL  and  monitored  by \nADB and other lenders.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nADB\u2019s proposed assistance will have two components: (i) a loan of up to $75 million from \n15. \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  and  (ii)  administration  of  a  loan  of  up  to  $15  million  to  be \nprovided  by  the  Canadian  Climate  Fund  for  the  Private  Sector  in  Asia  under  the  Clean  Energy \nFinancing  Partnership  Facility.6 The  loans  will  have  a  tenor  of  up  to  18  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod of up to 4 years, and will be repaid semiannually. They will carry respective interest rates as \nwell  as  commitment  and  front-end  fees  to  be  determined  and/or  endorsed  by  ADB\u2019s  investment \ncommittee. \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n16. \n\nThe proposed transaction merits ADB\u2019s assistance for the following reasons: \n(i) \n\nThe  project  will  promote  regional  cooperation  and  integration,  and  will  generate \nadditional revenues for Georgia through energy trade with Turkey. \nThe  project  will  strengthen  Georgia\u2019s  energy  security  by  adding  more  generating \ncapacity using its domestic clean energy resource. \nADB will provide critical gap financing for successful implementation of the  project, \nwhich  is  not  readily  available  in  the  market.  The  nature  of  the  project  (e.g.,  long \nconstruction period, high up-front capital expenditure, competitive tariffs assuming a \nlong asset  life)  is  appropriately financed  by  long-tenor  debt to  match  the  cash-flow \nprofile. \nOnce  approved,  this  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  private  sector  loan  for  development  of \nGeorgia\u2019s  energy  sector  as  well  as  the  first  nonsovereign  cofinancing  by  ADB, \nEBRD, and IFC in Georgia\u2019s energy sector. \nADB  will  support  and  promote  private  sector \ndeveloping member countries. \n\ninvestments  between  ADB\u2019s \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n                                                      \n6  As  the  implementing entity,  ADB  disburses  the  funds  which  it has  received  from  the  Canadian  Climate  Fund for  the \nPrivate Sector in Asia under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. The  fund will assume all credit risks on \nthe  principal  and  interest  repayments  related  to  the  loan.  As  such,  this  loan  will  not  count  as  ADB  exposure  to  the \nproject.  (ADB.  2010.  Exposure  and  Investment  Limitations  on  Nonsovereign  Operations.  Operations  Manual.  OM \nD13/BP. Manila). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n17. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified  as \ncategory A for environment, category A for involuntary resettlement, and category C for indigenous \npeoples.  The  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  and  risks  of  the  project  have  been \nidentified  and  effective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse \nimpacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. AGL will implement extra measure to \nallay  concerns  of  villagers  around the  project sites  regarding  the  potential  effect  of tunneling  and \nconstruction related activities triggering new landslides, potential loss of water supply (groundwater \nor  springs),  and  impacts  of  construction  on  traffic.  The  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of \nAGL to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental risks are deemed adequate, and measures \nare  being  continually  improved  such  as  better  coordination  of  activities  with  its  contractors. \nInformation  disclosure  and  consultations  with  affected  people  are  conducted  in  accordance  with \nADB requirements.7 A national environmental and social impact assessment was approved under \nGeorgian national regulations. Another  assessment was prepared to meet the lenders\u2019 safeguard \nrequirements,  and  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  27  June  2013.  An  environmental  and \nsocial  management  plan  was  prepared,  including  a  series  of  management  plans  as  part  of  the \nconstruction  environmental  management  plan.  Contractors  will  also  develop  environment,  health \nand safety plans in accordance with the construction environmental management plan. To ensure \nproper  risk  mitigation,  AGL  and  its  contractors  will  implement  these  and  incorporate  specific \nmeasures  to  address  stakeholders\u2019  concerns.  The  environmental  and  social  compliance  audit  on \nadvance  works  showed  satisfactory \nthe  management  measures.  The \nenvironmental and social impact assessment for the transmission line is expected to be conducted \naccording to Georgian and World Bank requirements since the government approached the World \nBank to finance the facility. \n \n18.  While  no  protected  areas  will  be  impacted  by  the  project,  a  biodiversity  action  plan  was \ndeveloped in consultation with multiple stakeholders. Spoils during construction of tunnels, dams, \nadits, and other civil works will be used in concrete production, as road aggregate, or disposed of \nin spoil dumps. Some 10% of annual mean flow was initially set as part of a two-stage approach to \nenvironmental flow assessment. A second stage will be  implemented to identify sensitive riverine \nmesohabitats,  determine  reach-specific  flow  requirements,  and  establish  measures  as  part  of  an \nadaptive  management  approach.  Physical  cultural  resources  have  been  avoided  and  AGL  has \ndeveloped  chance  find  procedures.8 Public  consultations  and  stakeholder  workshops  have  been \nconducted.  Concerns  regarding  road  damage  caused  by  vehicles  and  equipment  transport,  and \npotential reduction in supply from water resources, were identified in the community meetings and \nsafeguard  planning  as  well  as  through  the  grievance  redress  mechanism.  Measures  to  address \nthese  concerns  are  in  place  and  will  be  implemented  as  needed.  AGL  has  established  an \nenvironmental,  health,  safety,  and  social  unit  responsible  for  managing  safeguard  issues.  An \nemergency  preparedness  and  response  plan  with  emphasis  on  road  safety,  landslide  risks,  and \nfluctuating river flow will also be prepared. \n \n19. \nAn  independent  expert  assessment  was  conducted  to  address  the  concerns  villagers \nraised.  It  showed  that  geological  studies  were  done  in  a  professional  manner  and  construction \nactivities  are  not  expected  to  induce  landslides  of  the  same  magnitude  as  those  occurred  in  the \narea  in  the  past.  The  same  is  expected  with  tunneling  works  if  safe  blasting  methodology  is \n\nimplementation  of \n\n                                                      \n7   Summary Poverty Reduction and Social  Strategy; Safeguards and Social Dimensions Summary (accessible from the \n\n8 The  chance  find  procedures  are  a  pre-approved  management  and  conservation  approach  for  materials  that  may  be \n\nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\ndiscovered during project implementation. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fissues  and  mitigation  measures  before  contractors \n\nimplemented. However, to monitor  the impacts of construction activities, AGL will install landslide \nmonitoring stations in the villages. It will also record vibrations caused by blasting and survey, and \nmonitor  impacts  to  houses  within  200  meters  of  the  blast  center.  AGL  has  inventoried  the  water \nsources  in  the  villages,  and  plans  to  provide  temporary  or  permanent  community  water  supply  if \nthese  are  affected  by  the  tunnels.  To  manage  construction  traffic,  AGL  will  engage  traffic  safety \nwardens  stationed  in  the  affected  villages  to  assist  with  traffic  management  and  provide  school \nbuses to ferry schoolchildren. \n \n20. \nTo  ensure  that  AGL  and  its  contractors  can  effectively  implement  the  management \nmeasures, a communication strategy, including entry protocol to construction sites and briefing on \nenvironmental  and  social \nimplement \nconstruction activities, were recommended to be established by the lenders. AGL will also need to \nenhance  the  technical  knowledge  of  its  community  liaison  officers,  and  intensify  its  information \ncampaign  by  providing  visual  information  materials,  fact  sheets,  and  technical  briefings  to  local \npeople  on  geological  risks  and  overall  project  risk  management  measures.  AGL  has  the \ncommitment and sufficient capability to implement the proposed measures. \n \nThe  land  acquisition  and  livelihood  restoration  plan  is  being  implemented  and  an  audit \n21. \nreport  has  been  prepared.  The  impact  of  acquisition  of  about  44  hectares  (ha),  including  9 ha \nbelonging  to 369  households,  entailed  economic  displacement mainly  because of  loss  of grazing \nland. No physical displacement of affected people is required. The remaining 35 ha is managed by \nthe state. An external review of the land acquisition and livelihood restoration plan implementation \nis  being  undertaken,  and  an  ADB  mission  will  be  fielded  to  verify  and  ensure  compliance.  A \nlivelihood  restoration  program  has  commenced  with  the  training  of  about  600 persons  from \naffected  families,  of  which  166  persons  have  been  engaged  either  by  AGL  or  contractors.  A \ndetailed livelihood restoration program will be prepared and submitted to ADB within 3 months after \nloan signing. Indigenous peoples are not present in the project area. \n \n22. \nIn 2013, key  stakeholder concerns  were raised  related to  the geological risks  of  tunneling \nworks,  which  people  fear  may  activate  unstable  slopes  and  cause  landslides  and  affect  water \nsupply  availability.  Tsablana  (a  project-affected  village)  and  Ghurta  (located  outside  the  project \narea) have intermittently blocked contractor access to the project sites. AGL has demonstrated its \ncommitment  to  resolve  the  problem  through  intensive  engagement  with  the  government, \ntechnical  experts  and \nnegotiations,  and  ongoing  dialogue  with \nnongovernment organizations.  \n \n23. \nThe project is categorized as having no gender elements. Opportunities for creating jobs for \nwomen may be limited, as the tunnel digging and other construction activities may not be suitable \nfor  women.  The  project  is  expected  to  provide  job  opportunities  for  600  local  people  during  the \nconstruction  phase.  ADB  will  ensure  that  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate \nprovisions  requiring  AGL  to  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  in  addition,  to  take  specific \nmeasures  (including  in  relation  to  contractors)  in  relation  to  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards for the  ADB-financed portion  of the  project  in  compliance with ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \nStrategy.9  \n \nBased  on  the  assessment  of  potential  climate  change  risks,  the  project  can  be  classified \n24. \ninto  the medium risk  category.  Adaptation measures  were  included  to  address the  residual  risks. \nGiven  the  uncertainty  of  changes  in  climate,  the  ongoing  monitoring,  adaptive  management,  and \nmaintenance regime will provide sufficient resilience to the scheme once in operation.10 \n \n                                                      \n9   ADB. 2001.
