By introducing advanced metering infrastructure (AMI)2 to power distribution \ncompanies  (DISCOs)  throughout  Pakistan,  the  investment  program  would  (i)  reduce  power \ndistribution losses and improve revenue collection, (ii) reduce power outages by enhancing load \ncontrol and load management, (iii) provide automated power consumption data, (iv) modernize \nthe  electricity  metering  and  billing  system,  and (v)  improve customer services by  installing  the \ncustomer  information  system  (CIS).  AMI  will  be  implemented  in  several  phases  to  cover \nPakistan\u2019s major cities, and industrial and commercial hubs.3  An MFF instead of a stand-alone \nproject  is  proposed  for  investment  because  the  introduction  of  AMI  requires  a  long-term \npartnership between the Government of Pakistan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and \nbeing a large-scale and complex investment, the government intends to implement it in phases \nand MFF has been accordingly designed in multiple tranches to cover different regions.4 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nEnergy  crisis.  Reliable  and  sufficient  electricity  supply  is  the  backbone  for  Pakistan\u2019s \neconomic  growth.  In the  last  10  years,  Pakistan  has  been  suffering  from  electricity  shortages, \nleaving 33% of the population without access to electricity, and load shedding of around 25% of \nsystem  demand.5 While  standby  electricity  amounted  to  about 30%  in 2003\u20132004,  the  country \nnow  suffers from  a severe  power  crisis resulting in routine  load shedding  of  up  to  12  hours  in \nurban  areas,  and  18\u201320  hours  in rural  areas.6 This  is  considered  to  be  the  worst  of  four  such \nelectricity  crises  in  Pakistan  since  1974.  It  has  hurt  the  country\u2019s  economy,  as  reflected  in  an \nestimated  annual  loss  of  4%\u20137%  in  the  country\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  and  a  2% \nreduction  in real  GDP  growth.  The  power  shortfall  is  also  deemed  to  be  the  major  cause  of  a \ndecline  in  large-scale  manufacturing,  which  grew  by  just  1.2%  in  2012  and  2.8%  in  2013. \nDomestic private investment dropped from 14% of GDP in 2007\u20132008 to an estimated 10.9% of \nGDP in 2012\u20132013. Pakistan\u2019s economic growth slowed in 2013, resulting in a 5-year average \nof  3%,  which  is  well  below  the  7%  annual  growth  rate  necessary  for  sufficient  employment \ncreation  to  absorb  the  new  entrants  into  the  labor  force.  The  power  shortage  is  dampening \nbusiness confidence, which is already affected by the country\u2019s security situation. \n \n4. \nPower distribution sector. The supply\u2013demand gap (5,000 megawatts) is attributed to \nincreased  demand,  insufficient  generation,  and  system  inefficiencies.  DISCOs  are contributing \nthe most to the inefficiency in delivering generated power. Their system efficiency and financial \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  AMI  comprises  systems  that  measure,  collect,  and  analyze  energy  usage,  and  communicate  with  the  metering \ndevices  either  on  request  or  under  a  schedule.  These  systems  include  hardware,  software,  communication \nsystems, customer energy displays, customer associated systems, meter data management software. \n\n3  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  to  develop  the  proposed \n\nSecond Power Distribution Enhancement Investment Program (TA 8410).  \n\n4  A matrix showing a comparison between different financing modalities is in  Comparison of Multitranche Financing \n\nFacility and Project Loan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5  Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Planning, Development and Reforms. 2014. Pakistan Vision 2025. Islamabad. \n6  Government  of  Pakistan,  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory  Authority.  2012.  State  of  Industry  Report  2012. \n\nIslamabad. \n\n \n\n\fviability  are  critical  to  efficient  operations  and  the  sector\u2019s  sustainability  and  growth.  DISCOs\u2019 \ncustomer  tariff  does  not  cover  the  full  cost  of  power  distribution,  transmission,  and  generation \nbecause  the  system  losses  are  higher  than  those  allowed  by  the  regulator  and  revenue \ncollection  is  low.  The  cash  shortfall  hampers  DISCOs\u2019  performance,  and  payments  to  power-\ngenerating entities are delayed or subsidized by the government. This is not sustainable given \nthe fiscal impact. \n \n5. \nRoad map and strategic context. The government approved the National Power Policy \n2013  to  alleviate  the  chronic  energy  crisis  through  short,  medium-,  and  long-term  measures. \nThe government has taken some measures to reduce electricity shortages by adding generation \ncapacity  and  removing  some  of  the  bottlenecks  in  transmission  and  distribution  systems.  The \ngovernment  acknowledges  the  need  to  develop  a  long-term  investment  plan  to  resolve  the \npower crisis, and to bring financial sustainability to the sector. While the policy focuses on the \nmost crippling effect of the crisis by reducing the supply\u2013demand gap, it also envisages reforms \nto make the power sector sustainable and financially viable. For the distribution subsector, the \ngoal of the policy is to improve the operational and financial efficiency of the distribution system. \nA key strategy is to deploy smart meters and real-time monitoring. Other key strategies are the \nexecution of performance contracts that compel the heads of DISCOs to focus on the reduction \nof distribution losses and, in the longer term, the privatization of DISCOs. \n \nInvestment  plans  for  generation  and  transmission,  and  business  plans  for  distribution \n6. \nsystem  improvements  have  been  prepared.  The  investment  requirements  are  significant  and \nbeyond  the  capacity  of  the  country\u2019s  development  budget,  requiring  financing  from  outside. \nWhile ADB, the World Bank, and other bilateral development partners have been requested to \nfund  some  of  these  investments,  the  government  itself  is  also  utilizing  its  development  funds \nand encouraging private sector investment to resolve the energy crisis. \n \n7. \nPolicy  framework.  The  government\u2019s  policy  framework,  Pakistan  Vision  2025, \ndeveloped by the Ministry of Planning, Development and Reforms, is aligned with the strategic \ncontext  and  recognizes  that  sufficient,  reliable,  clean,  and  cost-effective  energy\u2014for  now  and \nthe future\u2014is indispensable to ensure sustainable economic growth and development. It aims to \n(i)  increase  new  power  generation  with  a  more  balanced  generation  mix,  (ii)  provide \nuninterrupted electricity to all, (iii) increase electricity access to 90% of the population by 2025, \nand (iv) improve demand management. \n \n8. \nPakistan Vision 2025\u2014backed by the National Power Policy, investment plans for power \ngeneration  and  transmission,  and  business  plans  for  the  distribution  sector\u2014will  be  leading \nPakistan into resolving the power crises. The investment program is one of the key drivers for \nthe  government  to  realize  this.  ADB,  in  close  coordination  with  other  international  financial \ninstitutions  and  donors,  is  in  continuous  dialogue  with  the  government  on  reforms  required  to \ncreate  the  right  environment  for  sector  stability,  and  has  agreed  on  a  policy  matrix  with  the \ngovernment, which is being implemented in phases.7 The MFF will support the policy dialogue \nby  providing  effective  tools  and  inputs  to  the  following  three  objectives  in  the  policy  matrix \nagreed  with  the  government:  (i)  loss  reduction  and  collection  improvement  in  DISCOs,  (ii) \nimproved  demand-side  efficiency  and  strengthened  energy  conservation,  and  (iii)  improved \nperformance of public sector companies in the power sector. Similarly,  the reform program will \ncreate  the  basis  for    the  benefits  envisaged  under  the  MFF  through  implementation  of  tariff \nregulation and subsidy reforms. \n \n\n                                                \n7 ADB. 2014. Sustainable Energy Sector Reform Program. Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fADB  assistance  and  country  partnership  strategy.  ADB is the leading donor in the \n9. \nPakistan  energy  sector  and  provides  funds  for  energy  efficiency,  power  transmission  and \ndistribution,  cross-border  natural  gas  pipelines,  power  generation,  and  renewable  energy \nprojects.  ADB  has  been  engaged  in  program  lending  and  assisting  the  government  in \ndeveloping  sector  policies  and  strategies  since  2000.8 ADB  has  supported  the  government\u2019s \nfocus  on  enhancing  the  power  distribution  and  transmission  system  by  upgrading,  extending, \nand  constructing  new  grid  stations  and  transmission  lines.  The  existing  MFF9 for  DISCOs  has \nshown  satisfactory  results  with  no  major  implementation  issues.  ADB  has  approved  all  four \ntranches  under  that  MFF,  with  one  financially  closed  and  three  under  implementation.  About \n3,956 megavolt-amperes of transformer capacity and 115 kilometers of transmission lines have \nalready been added to the system through the existing MFF. While the existing MFF focuses on \nenhancements in the grid stations and transmission lines of DISCOs, the second MFF would be \na targeted intervention to secure the metering and billing systems of DISCOs. Support through \nsuch and other ADB interventions is being provided to make DISCOs financially self-sustaining \nwith a true cost-of-service tariff and a transparent multi-buyer\u2013multi-seller model. \n  \nThe investment program is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2015\u20132019 \n10. \nfor Pakistan, which names the energy sector as one of the key priority areas.10 The program is \nalso included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017, and is consistent with the \ndevelopment coordination framework.11 \n \n11. \nInvestment  program.  The  government\u2019s  sector  investment  strategy  is  to  resolve  the \nfollowing  main  issues:  (i)  low  revenue  collection  from  public  and  private  customers,  and  high \nlosses in the distribution system (averaging 18.9% countrywide, and between 9.8% and 39.6% \namong  different  DISCOs);  (ii)  recurring  circular  debt  largely  stemming  from  low  revenue \ncollection;  (iii)  increasing  demand  stress  on  the  transmission  and  distribution  networks; \n(iv) overreliance  on  fuel  imports  and  failure  to  exploit  additional  indigenous  resources;  (v)  low \navailability  and  efficiency  of  existing  power  plants;  and  (vi)  declining  power  generation  from \ncheaper sources (hydro and natural gas). While some of the above issues are being dealt with \nthrough  existing  ADB  interventions, 12  issues  (i)\u2013(iii)  will  be  tackled  through  the  investment \nprogram,  which  follows  the  government\u2019s  strategy  for  the  next  10  years  and  builds  upon  the \nexisting ADB MFF for power distribution. \n \n12. \nThe investment program, through installation of AMI and billing systems, would enhance \nthe operational efficiency of DISCOs, including loss reduction to a level that the regulator deems \nacceptable to be passed on in the tariff, an increase in revenue collection, and efficient use of \navailable power through demand-side management. With its theft-control technology, revenue-\ncollection  enforcement  options  (remote  disconnection  against  nonpayment)  and \nload-\nmanagement  capabilities,  DISCOs  would  strategically  resolve  issues  relating  to  high  network \n\n                                                \n8  (i)  Power  Sector  Restructuring  Program  and  technical  assistance  loans,  approved  in  2000;  (ii)  Friends  of \nDemocratic Pakistan Energy Task Force Report, approved in 2010; and (iii) Sustainable Energy Reform Program \nand subprogram 1, approved in 2014. \n\n9  ADB. 2008.

Overall, \nthese would improve system stability and security, and the financial viability of DISCOs. \n \n13. \nThe Ministry of Water and Power (MOWP) intends to install AMI throughout the country \nin  all  major  cities,  and  industrial  and  commercial  hubs,  and  requested  ADB  in  May  2013  to \nsupport  its  initiative.  Investments  worth  $4.9  billion\u2014both  physical  and  nonphysical  (capacity \nbuilding)\u2014are required, and ADB has been requested to finance a portion of the government\u2019s \ninvestment plan. As part of the feasibility study for adopting AMI, an investment plan for the AMI \nrollout was developed and approved for the Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO) and \nLahore  Electric  Supply  Company  (LESCO)  under  tranche  1  of  the  investment  program.  Both \nDISCOs  will  seek  regulatory  approval  of  the  revised  integrated  distribution  business  plan, \nincluding AMI-related investments, within 1 year of project approval. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n14. \nThe  investment  program\u2019s  impact  will  be  improved  financial  viability  of  the  power \ndistribution  sector  in  Pakistan.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  electricity  revenues  in  the \ntargeted  regions.  The  investment  program  will  be  implemented  throughout  Pakistan,  covering \nmajor cities, and industrial and commercial hubs. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n15. \nThe  investment  program  will  have  four  outputs:  (i)  smart  meters  and  communication \nequipment  installed  and  functional,  (ii)  meter  data  management  system  (MDMS)  implemented \nimplemented  and  operational,  and \nand  operational,  (iii)  new  billing  system  and  CIS \n(iv) operations  manual  updated  and  monitoring  procedure  improved.  The  investment  program \nwill  improve  (i)  metering  accuracy  and  reliability,  anti-tampering,  and  fault  detection;  (ii)  tariff \ncollection and billing efficiency; and (iii) load monitoring and management. Tranche 1 will have \nthe same outputs as the investment program, but only with regard to IESCO and LESCO. \n \n16. \nthe investment program, with the following components: \n\nAMI  will  be  established  in  various  DISCOs  throughout  Pakistan  in  four  tranches  under \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nAdvance  metering  infrastructure  and  billing  system.  (a)  Procurement  and \ninstallation  of  smart  meters  and  associated  equipment  at  common  delivery \npoints,  11-kilovolt  feeders,  and  distribution  transformers  for  all  customers;  (b) \ndevelopment  of  communication  infrastructure;  and  (c)  installation  of  MDMS, \nupgrade of billing system, and CIS. \nCapacity  development  of  DISCO  personnel.

The \nMFF will finance a portion of this investment program  worth $1.25 billion. Eligible expenditures \nwill include goods, works, and consulting services as more particularly described in the detailed \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fcost estimates in the FAM.  The MFF will have four tranches13 from 2015 to 2024. Proceeds of \nthe  loan  under  each  tranche  will  be  relent  by  the  government  to  the  respective  DISCOs. \nTranche  1  is  expected  to  be  executed  in  2015.

Project  management  units \n(PMUs)  set  up  under  ADB\u2019s  earlier  MFF  for  power  distribution  (para.  9),  which  are  fully \noperational  and  well  familiar  with  ADB  policies  and  guidelines,  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing  and monitoring the  investment  program.  A  dedicated  technical  team  within  each \nPMU  will  be  established  with  AMI-specific  staff  resources.  The  PMUs  will  be  provided  with \nconsulting  support  on  project  implementation  covered  by  the  ADF  loan.

In the first phase under \n24. \ntranche  1  of  the  MFF,  about  2  million  customers  in  two  circles  of  LESCO\u2019s  and  IESCO\u2019s \nRawalpindi  region  have  been  selected,  which  is  about  one-third  of  each  company\u2019s  clientele. \nOnce developed, the phase will be replicated and implemented in the remaining technically and \ncommercially feasible regions or circles of the various DISCOs. The AMI and billing system will \ninclude  state-of-the-art  equipment  and  software  that  will  put  Pakistan  to  the  forefront  of  smart \ngrid technologies in the region. A few pilot advanced metering projects have been successfully \nimplemented  in  IESCO  and  LESCO.  A  small-scale  automatic  meter  reading  project  is  being \npiloted by the United States Agency for International Development in some DISCOs. \n \n25. \nDISCO staff will install the meters and communication infrastructure, while the contractor \nwill  implement  the  MDMS,  billing  system,  and  CIS.  DISCO  staff  will  work  under  the  close \ndirection of the contractor and project implementation consultant, who will also provide training \non  AMI  operation  and  maintenance.  All  parties  will  be  jointly  responsible  for  the  successful \ncommissioning of AMI. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f \n26. \nSmart  meters  and  communication  systems.  The  technology  selected  for  smart \nmeters  will  follow  international  standards,  including  some  specific  local  requirements  and \nfunctionalities  needed  to  achieve  the  investment  program\u2019s  targets,  such  as  remote  data \ncollection  for  billing,  remote  disconnection  and  connection  of  the  meters,  alarms  for  theft \ndetection, and demand control. The recommended meters are proven technologies operated all \nover the world. The communication infrastructure proposed in IESCO and LESCO for domestic \nand small and medium-sized commercial customers will be power line carrier (PLC)-based, and \ngeneral packet radio service-based for industrial and high-consumption commercial customers. \n \n27. \nBefore  recommending  the  PLC-based  communication  infrastructure,  the  feasibility \nconsultants  had  analyzed  all  other  options.  Because  the  radio  frequency  bands  normally \nrequired  for  this  kind  of  application  are  not  regulatory  available,  and  since  massive  general \npacket  radio  service  rollout  entails  high  initial  investment  and  operational  costs,  the  feasibility \nstudy  recommended  PLC  as  the  technically,  economically,  and  financially  most  viable  among \nthe three available options. \n \n28.  Meter data management systems. AMI comprises the head-end system and MDMS to \nremotely  exchange information with the  meters, process  information,  and  provide  the  required \nalarms  or  inputs  to  manage  the  meters.  The  modular  design  solution  recommended  in  the \nfeasibility study follows international standards, and will allow other meter manufacturers  to be \nintegrated  in  future  AMI  development  in  DISCOs.  Interoperability  and  the  possibility  of  using \nseveral brands were carefully considered. The project also incorporates the supporting software \nto manage the information technology networks and the meters\u2019 rollout. The AMI control centers \nwill be duplicated to ensure operational response during unexpected blackouts. \n \n29. \nBilling  systems  and  customer  information  system.  The  billing  system  and  CIS, \nintegrated with the AMI, will be deployed for the whole customer base of the DISCO concerned \nto fully automate the \u201cmeter to cash\u201d process. The billing system and CIS will also be accessible \nin  each  customer  service  center,  which  will  improve  the  quality  of  services.  The  systems  will \nallow interfaces with other corporate systems to ensure automatic information flow. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n30. \nEconomic and financial analyses will be carried out separately for each DISCO and for \neach tranche under the investment program. For tranche 1, the financial internal rate of return is \n12.4%,  which  is  greater  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  at  4.8%,  confirming  the \ninvestment\u2019s financial viability. The financial benefits accrued from a reduction in network losses \ntranslate into more revenues from electricity sales and lower operation and maintenance costs. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of return  is  18.6%, which is greater  than the economic  opportunity \ncost  of  12%,  confirming  the  investment\u2019s  economic  viability.  The  economic  benefits  are \nmeasured based on the value of the tariff net of taxes for incremental power consumption that \nstems from reduced system losses. \n \nThe financial performance of IESCO and LESCO was assessed for tranche 1. Except for \n31. \nfiscal  year  2012,  when the fuel cost  surged  and the timing for  tariff  increase  was substantially \ndelayed, both DISCOs have been financially stable with a low level of debt and are expected to \nremain so even with the investment. The tariffs may need to rise marginally for a short time to \nreflect  the  cost  of  financing,  but  no  significant  direct  impacts  on  tariffs  are  expected  from  the \ninvestment. \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fC. \n\nGovernance \n\nThe  financial  management  assessment 17 for  tranche  1  was  conducted  in  November \n32. \n2014 and shows that the pre-mitigation risks are substantial. Both IESCO and LESCO are under \na  capacity  development program  with  the  United  States  Agency for International  Development \nto  introduce  a  new  accounting  manual  and  system.  Although  the  DISCOs  are  familiar  with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time), capacity development in \nprocuring such turnkey contracts and contract management is essential. \n \n33. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  DISCOs.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the FAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social  \n\n34. \nThe investment program\u2019s poverty and social impacts are indirect. Improved systems will \nincrease  household  savings  and  reduce  operating  costs  of  small  entrepreneurs  who  spend \nmuch  on  backup  power  generators.  The  CIS  will  not  only  provide  facilities  to  customers  for \nbilling  and  accurate  reading,  but  also  allow  them  to  monitor  consumption  trends.  A \ncommunication strategy will be devised to increase public awareness of AMI and its benefits. \n \n35.  With no direct benefits to women, tranche 1 is categorized as having no gender element, \nas  detailed  in  the  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy.18 The  project  will  also  have \nminimal or no social impacts related to HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, and labor. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n36. \nNo civil works will be required for the AMI. No permanent or temporary land acquisition \nwill occur, nor any impact on assets or livelihoods. No indigenous peoples, as defined in ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  were  identified  in  areas  to  be  covered  by  the  investment \nprogram, which neither targets nor excludes individuals or specific groups of people. \n \nThe  MFF  is  expected  to  have  minimal  environmental  impact,  and  no  involuntary \n37. \nresettlement or indigenous peoples impact.19 However, to mitigate any impacts that may arise in \nany  of  the  tranches,  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework,  and  a  resettlement \nframework  were  prepared. 20    DISCOs  have  adequately  staffed  environment  and  social \nsafeguard  cells  within  their  PMUs  to  implement  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009). \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n38. \nThe  investment  program\u2019s  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4, and described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n\n                                                \n17 The financial management assessment was conducted in November 2014. \n18 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Tranche  1  has  been  categorized  as  C  for  environmental  impact  as  well  as  for  involuntary  resettlement  and \n\nindigenous peoples, and the potential impacts of future tranches are expected to be the same. \n\n20 Resettlement Framework, and Environmental Assessment and Review Framework were disclosed on 15 January \n\n2015 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nExisting business processes are \nno longer applicable with AMI. \n\nNon-integrated solutions will \nrequire homemade interfaces. \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures by Distribution Companies \nThe project implementation consultant will update, within 1 year of mobilization, the \ncommercial procedures handbook to reflect the changes in business procedures \nrequired for AMI operations. \nFocus on integrated solution.  Procurement will be done as a single responsibility \ncontract with all three components as part of the same package, and proof of \nconcept to be approved before contract signing. \nProvide (i) additional technical support through project preparatory technical \nassistance consultants, (ii) hands-on training by contractor, and (iii) special \ncapacity development program by project implementation consultant.
