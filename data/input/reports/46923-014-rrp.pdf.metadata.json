The private investment climate is challenging, characterized by rapid inflation, weak \nfiscal  discipline  and  public  sector  governance,  and  an  unresolved  energy  crisis.  Despite  a \nmodern  regulatory  banking  system,  Pakistan\u2019s  financial intermediation  trails  its  regional  peers. \nCommercial  bank  credit  was  only  20%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2012,  down  from \n29%  in  2008.  High  fiscal  deficits  undermine  private  access  to  funding  at  affordable  costs. \nFinancial inclusion remains low: only 3% of the adult population has loan accounts and 28% has \ndeposit  accounts.2 Poverty  remains  widespread.  The  World  Bank  estimated  that  60%  of  the \npopulation earned less than $2 per day in 2008. The government\u2019s poverty head count ratio is \n27% in rural areas and 13% in urban areas.3  \n\n3. \nIn  this  challenging  investment  climate,  Pakistan\u2019s  large  private  banks  have  shown \nresilience. Their asset quality, profitability, and solvency have remained substantially better than \ntheir  smaller  and  public  sector  peers.  The  banking  system  continues  to  have  ample  liquidity \nrepresenting  49%  of  total  bank  assets.4 In  addition,  strong  domestic  demand  and  continued \naccess to funding have helped large listed companies remain resilient. \n\nPakistan\u2019s  rural  economy  contributes  substantially  to  employment  (45%) 5  and  GDP \n4. \n(20%).6 However,  only  5%  of  bank  loans  are  to  the  agriculture  sector,  and  half  of  those  are \nprovided by public sector banks at subsidized rates (footnote 3). Access to public sector bank \nloans is limited and often based on relationships rather than farmers\u2019 creditworthiness. Among \nthe constraints on lending  to farmers are the banks\u2019 difficulty in monitoring remote farms, high \nfarm risks and farmers\u2019 inability to provide requisite documentation. The State Bank of Pakistan \n(SBP) and commercial banks recognize that more inclusive ways are needed to link farmers to \nmarkets, increase their productivity, and transform them into creditworthy partners. \n\nPakistan is one of the five largest milk producers in the world, generating 38 billion liters \n5. \nannually.7 It has more than 8 million dairy-producing households, representing 35 million people. \nDairy production is estimated to currently grow at 2%\u20134% annually, and accounted for 12% of \nGDP  and  55%  of  agricultural  GDP  in  2012.  Only  54%  of  produced  milk  is  tradable,  93%  of \nwhich is provided to the consumers as loose milk. While packaged dairy products still constitute \na  small  market  segment  at  1.4  billion  liters  annually  (or  7%  of  tradable  milk),  the  demand  is \ngrowing  10%\u201315%  per  year\u2014outpacing  annual  production  growth.  This  indicates  a  growing \nsupply shortage and the need to source more milk from small farmers. The binding constraints \n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  International Monetary Fund.

Pakistan Metadata. http://www.worldbank.org/ (accessed on 2 September 2013).  \n7  Information provided by Engro Foods Limited. The estimates should be interpreted with caution since unrecorded \nvolumes are high, and a large part of the milk being consumed by farmers and wastage is known to be substantial.   \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nfacing the dairy sector are discussed in paras. 6\u20139.   \n\n6. \nSmall  farm  size.  Farms  with  less  than  10  cattle  provide  80%  of  the  milk  supply, \nrepresenting 92% of the dairy stock.  However, the low yielding dairy stock and the small farm \nsize limits the production of animal feed and the farms\u2019 overall dairy yield. Average yields at less \nthan 4 liters per cattle per day are low compared with  local commercial farms, which normally \nexceed 15 liters per cattle. In addition, losses from inadequate cooling facilities exceed 25% of \nproduction.  There  are  only  a  few  medium-sized  and  large  farms  with  more  than  100  cattle. \nThese  require  long  periods  to  reach  profitability  and  represent  less  than  10%  of  the  market \nproduction.     \n\n7. \nLow  quality  and  capital  availability.  Intermediaries  dominate  the  supply  chain  and \noften  contaminate  milk  through  mishandling.  Milk  is  largely  sold  unpackaged,  compromising \nconsumer health. Most farmers lack even minimal management skills and investment capital.  \n\n8. \nInvestment  identification.    Since September 2011, ADB has explored opportunities to \npromote rural financial inclusion in Pakistan through an inclusive business approach  by linking \nfarmers  to  agribusiness  companies  and  banks  to  achieve  high  business  and  social  impact. \nConsultations  with  the  government,  development  partners,  private  commercial  banks,  and \nagribusiness  companies  identified  the  dairy  value  chain  as  a  promising  entry  point.  Providing \nprivate  investment  capital  to  promote  the  use  of  locally  adapted,  higher-yielding  dairy  cattle \nwould enhance private, government, and development partner efforts to improve rural incomes, \nand farm management. \n\n9. \nThe consultation process resulted in an inclusive business design of the facility that aims \nto provide dairy farmers access to investment capital to increase farm yields and dairy outputs, \nreduce losses, and improve the quality of milk. The proposed approach entails collaboration and \nrisk  sharing  between  participating  dairy  companies  (PDCs)  that  source  milk  from  farmers  and \nparticipating  commercial  banks  (PCBs)  that  provide  loans  to  farmers  in  Pakistan.  Because  of \nthe  untested  nature  of  the  approach  and  farm  risk,  the  Department  for  International \nDevelopment of  the United Kingdom (DFID) and  SBP have agreed to provide a 20% first-loss \nguarantee from their existing Financial Inclusion Program.8 In exchange for being able to select \nfarmers and benefit from increasing milk sales, PDCs will have to participate significantly in the \ncredit risk to ensure good management and assistance of their veterinary services  to farmers. \nTo  ensure  scalability,  ADB  has  discussed  the  inclusive  business  approach  with  a  number  of \nbanks,  including  Habib  Bank  Limited  (HBL),  and  dairy  market  leaders,  including  Engro  Foods \nLimited (EFL). After 2 years ADB reached an agreement with HBL, EFL, SBP, and DFID on the \nterms of the untested inclusive business approach.  \n\nB. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\nTo reduce production losses and meet the increasing domestic demand, dairy producers \n10. \nwill  move  their  direct  milk  sourcing  network  closer  to  the  farmers  and  increase  their  farm \nveterinary services to help improve farm management. HBL has been identified as the first PCB \nand  EFL  as  the  first  PDC  that  meet  the  eligibility  criteria  under  the  facility.  Subject  to  Board \napproval, ADB will identify other PCBs and PDCs in a manner set forth in para 26. \n\n11. \nEstablished  in  1941,  HBL  is  Pakistan\u2019s  largest  bank  with  assets  of  PRs1,518  billion \n($14.4 billion) and market shares of 11% of loans and 15% of deposits at the end of FY2012. It \n                                                 \n8  SBP will be the guarantor of record, with funding provided by DFID. The program includes a nationwide guarantee \nfinance. \n\nto  support  access  of  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and \n\nto  bank \n\nfarmers \n\nfacility \nhttp://projects.dfid.gov.uk/project.aspx?Project=113331  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n\nhas  1,497  branches,  representing  about  15%  of  Pakistan\u2019s  bank  branch  network.  With  PRs18 \nbillion  ($170  million)  HBL  is  the  largest  private  lender  to  agriculture.  The  facility  will  provide \nfinance  to  farmers  who  would  not  normally  qualify  as  borrowers  under  HBL\u2019s  existing  lending \ncriteria.  Linking  HBL\u2019s  widespread  branch  network  and  credit  underwriting  experience  in  rural \nareas with the strengths of EFL provides an untapped opportunity for inclusive business. \n\n12. \nEFL\u2019s assets have grown quickly, reaching  PRs22.2 billion  ($209  million) at the  end of \nFY2012.  EFL  improved  its  long-term  debt-to-equity  ratio  from  47.5%  at  the  end  of  FY2010  to \n37.5% at the end of FY2012. EFL\u2019s liquidity remained healthy as the current ratio improved from \n1.5 at the end of FY2010 to 2.1 at the end of FY2012. Net after tax income increased more than \nfourteen-fold since 2010 to PRs2.6 billion ($25 million), driven by strong revenue growth, which \nreached  PRs40  billion  ($378  million)  in  FY2012.  Profitability  improved  consistently  in  FY2012, \nwith return on equity reaching 25.8%, compared with 3.4% in 2010. In 2012, EFL received the \nGroup  of  Twenty  international  inclusive  business  award  for  successful  integration  of  small \nfarmers in its business model. \n\nC. \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n1. \n\nHabib Bank Limited  \n\nlegal,  operations,  and \n\n13. \nOwnership.  Privatized  in  2004,  HBL  is  owned  by  the  Aga  Khan  Fund  for  Economic \nDevelopment (51%); SBP, representing the government (41.5%); and the public (7.5%) through \nits listing on Pakistan\u2019s stock exchanges. \n \n14.  Management. Nauman K. Dar, the chief executive officer (CEO) is supported by senior \nmanagers  in  retail,  corporate,  and  Islamic  banking,  as  well  as  treasury,  financial  control,  risk \nmanagement,  strategic  planning,  human  resources, \ninformation \ntechnology. Management is supported by senior staff through dedicated departments for asset\u2013\nliability  management,  risk  management,  credit  policy,  and  operational  risk  management.  HBL \nhas an independent risk management department covering credit, portfolio, market, and liquidity \nrisks. It reports to the board\u2019s risk management committee.  \n \n15. \nGovernance  structure.  HBL  is  a  Public  listed  company  with  a  strong  governance \nstructure  with  an  8  member  Board  representing  the  shareholders  and  with  independent \nDirectors  as  required  by  Law.    The  board  has  3  sub  committees,  Audit,  Human  Resource  & \nRemuneration  and  the  Risk  Management  Committee,  each  of  which  is  chaired  by  a  non \nexecutive Director.  \n \n16. \nHBL  has  an  independent  audit  department  whose  chief  reports  to  the  board\u2019s  audit \ncommittee.  HBL  has  adequate  anti-money-laundering  systems  in  compliance  with  local \nregulations.  Transactions  are  monitored  using  specialized  software.  An  anti-money-laundering \nofficer reports to the chief compliance officer. The compliance unit reports transactions to SBP.  \n\n2. \n\nEngro Foods Limited \n\nOwnership.  Established  in  2006,  EFL  is  a  90%  owned  subsidiary  of  Engro  Holdings \n17. \nCorporation  Limited.  It  is  a  diversified  conglomerate  with  operations  in  food  and  beverage, \nfertilizer, energy, trading, chemicals, storage, and engineering. Fourty-eight percent of its shares \nare held by prominent institutional and high net worth investors with the remaining shares being \ntraded  on  Pakistan\u2019s  stock  exchanges.  Like  its  parent,  EFL  is  subject  to  the  exchange\u2019s \ndisclosure  and  corporate  governance  regulations  under  the  supervision  of  the  Securities  and \nExchange Commission.  \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n18.  Management.  CEO  Sarfaraz  Rehman  led  EFL  from  its  foundation  in  2006  until \nSeptember 2011 and again since July 2013. He is an experienced industry manager in Pakistan \nand  was  vital  in  building  EFL.  He  is  assisted  by  a  10-member  management  committee  of \nexperienced managers who lead business units for sales, marketing, and dairy supply chain, as \nwell as support units including finance, human resources and administration, legal, and audit. \n\n19. \nGovernance  structure.  EFL  has  a  10-member  board,  including  the  CEO  representing \nexperienced  professionals  from  finance,  marketing,  and  operations.  As a  listed  company,  EFL \nalso  has  an  independent  non-  executive  director  who  chairs  the  board\u2019s  audit  and  finance \ncommittees.  \n\nD. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\nCapital adequacy. With a total capital adequacy ratio of 15.1% and a tier 1 capital ratio \n20. \nof 12.9%, HBL\u2019s capital adequacy exceeded SBP\u2019s regulatory minimum of 10% in FY2012. HBL \nis  moving  towards  an  internal  ratings-based  approach  for  credit  and  market  risks,  and  is \nadopting an advanced measure for the operational risk capital charge. These reforms toward an \nintegration of capital and risk management and strategic planning will  improve automation and \nstreamline business processes, and modify HBL\u2019s capital charge in FY2014.   \n    \nAsset  quality.  HBL\u2019s asset quality is satisfactory and has substantially improved since \n21. \n2009. It is above the sector average of 14.5% in Pakistan, where loans are rarely written off and \nnonperforming  loan  statistics  carry  substantial  fully  provisioned  loss  loans.  While  the  overall \nnonperforming  loan  ratio  (including  losses)  was  reported  at  10.1%  in FY2012  ,  the  net  of  loss \nnonperforming  loan  ratio  was  reported  at  2.6%  in  FY  2012,  reflecting  HBL\u2019s  prudent \nunderwriting. HBL increased its exposure to the government and its entities through loans and \ntreasury bills to 74% of its exposures at  the end of  FY2012 compared with 55% at  the end of \nFY2009.   \n\nEarnings.  For  FY2012,  net  income  reached  PRs21.6  billion  with  a  slight  drop  in  the \n22. \nreturn on equity to19.3% and return on assets to 1.7% as result of asset growth of 42.7% during \nFY2012.  Net  income  grew  at  a  compound  annual  growth  rate  of  20.6%  from  2009  to  2012, \nprimarily  because of  robust asset  growth at a  compound  annual growth rate  of 22.7%. During \nFY2012, HBL\u2019s net interest margin dropped by about 150 basis points to 5.1% because of SBP \ninterest rate reductions and higher deposit funding costs. HBL\u2019s profitability is strong compared \nwith local peers and stable with 83% of its business funded by low-cost deposits and an 18.1% \nshare of non-interest income to operating income.  \n \n23. \nLiquidity  and  sensitivity  to  market  risk.  In  FY2012,  HBL\u2019s  deposit  growth  was  30% \noutpacing  the  industry  average  of  11%.  More  than  half  of  the  deposits  are  raised  at  low-cost \nfrom  individuals,  who  tend  to  be  less  price-sensitive.  Long-term  assets  are  well  covered  as \nindicated by a net stable funding ratio consistently exceeding 115% since FY2009 and reaching \n140% in FY2012. HBL\u2019s liquidity coverage ratio has consistently exceeded 150% since 2010.  \n\nE. \n\nUnique Features \n\n24. \nThe  facility  involves  an  inclusive  business  approach  in  blending  funding,  skills,  and \noutreach of PCBs, PDCs, and development partners to offer unbanked dairy farmers access to \naffordable  credit.  PDCs\u2019  ability  to  select  suitable  farmers  and  investments,  and  monitor  farm \nmanagement  jointly  with  PCBs\u2019  underwriting  and  risk  management  skills,  is  far  superior  to \ntraditional PCB lending. In addition, the first-loss risk cover (an essential feature of the facility) \nwill  alleviate high first-mover risks  when  developing  this market segment. Also, the PDCs\u2019 risk \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n\nparticipation  is  essential  to  ensure  its  careful  selection  monitoring  of,  and  advisory  to  farmers \nand their investments, and thereby  identify and address  risks  early on.  In this scalable model, \nADB and the PCB can leverage an inclusive business model at limited risk.  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nTransaction Structure \n\n  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, KPI = key performance indicator, IT = information technology, PCB \n= participating commercial bank, PCG = partial credit guarantee, PDC = participating dairy company, \nPRe = Pakistan rupee, SBP = State Bank of Pakistan. \nSource: ADB. \n\n \n\n25. \nThe structure of the ADB assistance is illustrated in the figure. It entails a PCG facility of \nup  to  $35  million  (or  Pakistan  rupee  equivalent)  in  support  of  investment  loans  made  to  dairy \nfarmers in Pakistan. Under the facility, PCGs in favor PCBs may be entered into by ADB up to 4 \nyears after Board approval. Such PCGs will cover loans made by PCBs with a tenor of up to 5 \nyears that can be disbursed within 5 years from the signing of such PCG. The size of the facility \nis  adequate,  taking  into  account  the  rapidly  increasing  market  demand  and  the  positive \nresponses from possible PCBs and PDCs. DFID expressed interest to guarantee the first loss \nunder the facility. \n\nB. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nUnder  the  facility,  ADB  will  select  PCBs  and  PDCs  that  will  benefit  from  ADB\u2019s  PCGs, \n26. \nsubject  to  the  eligibility  criteria  set  out  in  the  implementation  arrangements,  and  standard  due \ndiligence procedures of ADB\u2019s private sector operations. Subject to approval by the Board of the \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nfacility, ADB\u2019s Investment Committee will be authorized to review and approve each PCB, PDC, \nand the amount and structure of each PCG under the facility. To reduce ADB\u2019s credit risk, other \nparties  will  take  junior  positions  under  guarantee  structures,  before  ADB\u2019s  PCG  will  be \ntriggered.9 ADB will only incur losses under its PCGs after the other guarantors have assumed \ntheir losses. For each PCG, ADB will require a PDC to assume either a first-loss or second-loss \nposition but in any event a position under which it bears the risk of loss either in priority to, or \nranking  equally  with  ADB.  ADB  will  also  require  the  PCB  to  retain  a  significant  portion  of  the \noverall risk of loss under each guarantee structure. \n\n27. \nA first PCG under the facility has been targeted and is currently under negotiation.  The \nprincipal  amount  guaranteed  under  this  PCG  will  be  up  to  $3  million  (or  Pakistan  rupee \nequivalent) and cover 35% of the outstanding principal in a portfolio of loans to be made by HBL \nto eligible dairy farmers selected by EFL and HBL. The loans will fund the purchase of cows and \nassociated capital expenses such as sheds and animal feed. EFL will select farmers and assist \nthem in selecting healthy dairy cows. EFL will purchase the produced milk and the proceeds will \nbe used to service the farmers\u2019 loans directly from the milk sales. SBP as a guarantor of record \nfor DFID will issue a first-loss guarantee of 20% of the loan pool. EFL will issue a second-loss \nguarantee of 10% of the loan pool. ADB will guarantee 50% of the losses that exceed the first \nand second loss threshold. The remaining risk will be retained by HBL.   \n\nThe  individual  PCGs  and  their  structures  (including  first  loss  requirements,  tenors,  fee \n28. \nrates,  and  security  arrangements)  under  the  facility,  including  the  first PCG  referred  to  above, \nwill  be  tailored  to  the  circumstances  and  needs  of  each  PCB  and  PDC,  and  will  take  into \naccount the experience with earlier similar transactions.  \n\nfinancial  statements \n\nHBL,  EFL,  and  other  participating  banks  and  companies  will  be  required  to  provide \n29. \nannual  audited \nfinancial  reporting \nstandards.10 They  will  also  provide  quarterly  progress  reports  and  financial  statements  of  the \nguaranteed  loan  pools.  Reporting  requirements  include  (i)  status  updates  on  governance, \nsafeguards,  and  annual  reports  of  the  PCB\u2019s  facility  environmental  and  social  management \nsystem (ESMS); (ii) updates on the PCBs\u2019 business and loan pool performance, and utilization \nof the ADB PCG limit; and (iii) development effectiveness. ADB will field review missions at least \nannually and discuss progress with the PCBs, PDCs, SBP, and DFID or other guarantors. \n\nin  accordance  with  applicable \n\nC. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n30.   Strengthening  agriculture  through  an  innovative,  inclusive  business  model.  ADB \nplays  a  vital  role  in  providing  a  viable  and  scalable  inclusive  business  model  to  farmers  that \nbenefits from the collaboration and risk sharing of PDCs and PCBs. The business model\u2019s key \nfeatures  include  (i)  PDCs\u2019  market  knowledge  and  ability  to  source  quality  milk  from  small \nfarmers;  (ii)  PDCs\u2019  ability  to  identify  farmers  and  investments  to  increase  farm  yields  and \nincome; (iii) PDCs\u2019 veterinary services to advise  farmers in animal  and farm management; (iv) \ncommercial  risk  capital  leveraged  through  risk  shared  by  development  partners,  PDCs,  and \nPCGs;  (v)  investment  and  credit  cash  flows  controlled  from  abuse  by  limiting  direct  cash \npayments  to  farmers;  (vi)  alignment  of  PCB,  PDC,  and  farmer  interests  in  boosting  sales, \nincome,  and  creditworthiness;  (vii)  improvement  of  financial  and  farm  management  literacy \nthrough monitoring and field advice; and (viii) improvement in the understanding of farmer risk \nprofiles through a staged learning-by-doing process.  \n                                                 \n9 A first-loss guarantee may be issued by a third party in combination with a second-loss guarantee issued by another \n\nparty. This may include SBP as a guarantor of record for DFID or DFID directly. \n\n10 Commercial banks and listed companies in Pakistan are required to publish annual audited accounts in accordance \n\nwith international financial reporting standards.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n\n Catalyzing sustainable private funding at affordable rates. The risk participation will \n31.  \noffer PDCs incentives to select farmers carefully. Banks currently do not lend to small farmers, \nwhile microfinance and money lenders charge annual effective interest rates of more than 30%. \nThe  risk  participation  will  enable  financial  institutions  to  provide  affordable  borrowing  and/or \nlending  rates  to  the  farmers.  The  need  for  first-loss  cover  funded  by  development  partners  is \nexpected to diminish gradually once the track record for this product is established and widely \naccepted by PCBs and PDCs.    \n\n32.   Enhancing corporate governance and risk management. Through on-site monitoring \nand dialogue, ADB will support the adherence of PCBs and PDCs to high corporate governance \nand social, environmental, and fiduciary standards. It will also enhance risk management. \n\nD. \n\nRisks  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n33.           Impact.  The  facility  will  contribute  to  (i)  the  growth  of  small,  high-value-added  dairy \nproducts in Pakistan; (ii) the scaling up of commercial banking services for small dairy farmers; \nand (iii) improvements in dairy farmers\u2019 access to investment capital. \n\n34. \nOutcome.  The facility will provide a scalable commercial model for  providing credit to \nsmall farmers. Once successfully tested, this model will provide for sustainable credit outreach \nto  small  farmers,  substantial  revenue  through  higher-yielding  cows,  and  increased  farmer \nproductivity.  \n\n35. \nOutputs.  The outputs include (i) increased access of small dairy farmers to finance, (ii) \nthe establishment of a sustainable farmer credit program, and (iii) improved farm management.  \n\nB. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\nUnder  Strategy  2020,  ADB  aims  to  strengthen  its  support  for  the  finance  sector  by \n36. \nassisting in the development of financial infrastructure, institutions, and products and services, \nas  well  as  by  promoting  inclusive  growth.11 Through  such  initiatives,  ADB  will  encourage  the \nchanneling  of  savings  into  productive  investments.  The  building  of  inclusive  financial  systems \nwill be supported by the facility funding agriculture where productivity is low and the potential for \nemployment and income generation is high. The facility will help establish an inclusive business \nmodel  for  commercial  banks  to  reach  dairy  farmers  who  do  not  have  access  to  affordable \ncommercial  funding,  consistent  with  efforts  by  the  government,  SBP,  DFID  to  promote \nagricultural  growth.  Strategy  2020\u2019s  target  for  poverty  reduction  through  private  sector \ndevelopment  will  be  directly  addressed  by  linking  small  farmers  and  their  families  to  markets, \nand providing them access to credit and productive assets. Consistent with Strategy 2020, the \nfacility  will  demonstrate  an  inclusive  business  approach  and  leverage  a  partnership  with  the \nexisting Financial Inclusion Program of SBP and DFID.  \n\n37. \nThe  facility  supports  the  development  objectives  of  the  government,  which  include \nfinance for development. The country partnership strategy for Pakistan, 2009\u20132013 emphasizes \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB.  2008.  Strategy  2020:  The  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  2008\u20132020. \n\nManila. \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nthe need for reforms, including measures to improve productivity in agriculture and promote the \nprivate  sector. 12 ADB\u2019s  consultations  with  stakeholders  highlight  the  importance  of  the  private \nand financial sector, as well as the need to improve financial inclusion, especially in rural areas. \nMore  commercial  financial  services  will  capture  essential  qualitative  inclusive  business  growth \nopportunities  and  encourage  sound  risk  management.  Capital  support  through  the  partnership \nof  banks  and  agribusiness  present  a  strong  inclusive  business  transaction  through  ADB\u2019s \nprivate sector operations.  \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n38. \nThe facility is consistent with ADB\u2019s financial sector operational plan and the 2007 report \nof  the  working  group  on  rural  poverty,  which  emphasizes  the  importance  of  rural  finance  and \npromotes financial inclusion of underserved poor households and farmers.13  \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n39. \nThe facility is classified as category FI under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \nOn  social  safeguards,  the  facility  is  category  FI  treated  as  C  for  impacts  on  involuntary \nresettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  Sub-loans  classified  as  environment  category  A  and \nsocial safeguard categories A and B will not be financed under the facility.  \n\n40. \nThe sub-loans to be guaranteed by the first PCG will finance the acquisition of cows and \nassociated capital expenses targeting small farmers in Punjab province. The sites are irrigated \nagricultural  land  far  from  notified  protected  ecosystems.  The  implementation  of  the  PCG  is \nexpected  to  have  minimal  to  moderate  environmental  impacts.  Potential  impacts on  land,  soil, \nwater,  air  quality,  and  biodiversity  are  derived  from  (i)  solid  wastes  from  waste  feed,  animal \nwaste,  carcasses,  and other  hazardous  wastes;  (ii)  wastewater  from  runoff  from  feed  storage; \n(iii) ammonia and odors from manure, and dust from overgrazed pastureland; (iv) environmental \ndamage  of  soil  and  water  resources  because  of  cattle  access;  and  (v)  spread  of  animal \ndiseases.  \n\nFor the first PCG, HBL and EFL have management systems in place and are committed \n41. \nto meeting ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. The ESMS established by HBL in collaboration with \nEFL, with the agreed-upon modifications requested by ADB, is considered adequate to comply \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  EFL  and  HBL  will  ensure  that  investments  using  the \nPCG do not involve business activities on ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list. Under the \nfirst PCG, HBL will provide only sub-loans to be guaranteed by ADB classified as environment C \nuntil  HBL\u2019s  existing  ESMS  is  enhanced  to  ADB\u2019s  satisfaction.  That  will  be  triggered  by  the \ncompletion of  measures addressing environmental  impacts of sub-loans classified as category \nB. The ESMS provides for HBL compliance with applicable national safeguard requirements on \nenvironment, health, and safety; and safeguard requirements including labor laws in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.14 \n\nADB  has  made  significant  efforts  during  its  due  diligence  to  assess  HBL\u2019s  and  EFL\u2019s \n42. \ncommitment and capacity for promoting gender equity, and to ensure that gender inclusiveness \nis an integral feature of this transaction.
