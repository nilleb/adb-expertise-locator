Gobi will \nincrease  its  raw  cashmere  procurement  capacity,  ultimately  benefiting  herders,  and  the \nmanufactured  end  products  will  be  sold  domestically  and  exported  to  over  30  countries.  The \nproject  is  fully  aligned  with  the  Government  of  Mongolia\u2019s  goals  to  enhance  agricultural \nproductivity, increase local value addition, diversify exports, and create jobs. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n1. \n\nProject Identification \n\n \n3. \nImportance of agriculture and animal husbandry in Mongolia. The agriculture sector \nis the backbone of the Mongolian economy. In 2017, agriculture accounted for 12% of Mongolia\u2019s \ngross domestic product (GDP) and employed 30% of the country\u2019s workforce.2 The agriculture \nsector is also considered the key in diversifying the economy away from its heavy reliance on the \nmining sector. Agricultural products, accounting for 8% of total exports in terms of value in 2017, \nare  the  second  largest  export  item  after  mineral  products  (footnote  2).  Within  the  agriculture \nsector, pastoral animal husbandry accounts for more than two-thirds of the country\u2019s agricultural \noutputs.  One-third  of  Mongolia\u2019s  population  live  in  rural  areas  and  their  livelihoods  are  highly \ndependent on animal husbandry, with 78% of rural households owning livestock (footnote 2). \n \nLack of local processing capability. Mongolia\u2019s agriculture is largely concentrated on \n4. \nprimary production and basic processing. It foregoes significant value addition because of limited \ndomestic  processing  capacity,  and  the  country  exports  a  substantial  portion  of  its  agricultural \nproducts after primary processing. Raw materials and semi-processed goods accounted for over \n76% of Mongolia\u2019s agricultural exports in 2017. According to the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and \nLight Industry, full end processing of agricultural raw materials is estimated to increase the current \nagricultural output value by at least three times.3 \n \nCashmere  industry  development.  Mongolia  has  a  natural  competitive  advantage  in \n5. \ncashmere  production  with  its  climate  and  terrain  extremely  well  suited  for  cashmere  goats. \nMongolia  produces  one-third  of  the  global  supply  of  raw  cashmere. 4  Cashmere  is  one  of \nMongolia\u2019s  major  agricultural  commodities  and  the  main  source  of  livelihood  for  Mongolian \nherders. Despite this high level of raw cashmere production, only 10% of raw cashmere is fully \nprocessed  domestically.  Exports  of  semi-processed  cashmere\u2014primarily  to  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC)\u2014account for 90% of Mongolia\u2019s raw cashmere (footnote 4). Despite the \ndevelopment of the Mongolian cashmere processing  industry in the past decade, considerable \npotential value addition through secondary processing remains uncaptured. \n \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015. Faster Approach to Small Nonsovereign Transactions. Manila. \n2  Government of Mongolia, National Statistics Office. Mongolian Statistical Information Service. http://www.1212.mn \n\n(accessed 3 April 2018). \n\n3  Government of Mongolia, Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry. http://mofa.gov.mn/exp/blog/7/3#. \n4  Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and export diversification. Mongolia\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on its \n6. \nmining sector, which accounts for 20% of GDP and 80% of exports.5 However, the mining sector \ndepends on foreign direct investment inflows and external demand for its output. This causes the \nMongolian  economy  to  be  highly  vulnerable  to  external  shocks  stemming  from  swings  in \ninternational commodity prices and the economic cycles of major trading partners, particularly the \nPRC. The mining sector, despite its significant share of GDP and exports, contributes to less than \n4% of total employment. The agriculture sector is a pivotal sector in that its development translates \nmore  directly  into  improved  livelihoods  for  vulnerable  Mongolians  than  mining.  As  cashmere \nexports amount to almost 40% of Mongolia\u2019s non-mineral exports (footnote 5), the development \nof  a  value-added  cashmere  industry  is  a  key  element  in  Mongolia\u2019s  economic  and  export \ndiversification away from the mining sector. \n \nGovernment  policy  alignment.  The  Government  of  Mongolia  has  prioritized  the \n7. \ndevelopment  of  the  cashmere  industry.  The  government\u2019s  National  Production  Program  2016-\n2020  aims  to  increase  the  share  of  value-added  products  in  the  national  GDP  and  boost  the \nproduction of goods for export.6 The program also addresses the supply chain development of \nraw materials, including cashmere. In February 2018, the government renewed its commitment \nto  support  the  cashmere  industry  by  launching  a  4-year  Cashmere  Program  that  will  support \ndomestic production of cashmere end products and technological innovation in the industry.7 This \nprogram  will  continue  financial  support  to  cashmere  producers  as  well,  partly  through \nconcessional  loans  for  raw  cashmere  procurement.  The  government\u2019s  goal  in  supporting  the \ncashmere industry is to increase export income and create new jobs. \n \n8. \nProject  selection.  Gobi  is  the  largest  cashmere  manufacturer  in  Mongolia.  As  an \nintegrated cashmere producer, Gobi manages its entire value chain, from sourcing raw cashmere \ndirectly  from  herders  to  processing  and  manufacturing  cashmere  products  at  its  primary  and \nsecondary processing facilities in Ulaanbaatar.8 Gobi designs, manufactures, markets, and sells \nits own branded products domestically through its domestic branches and internationally through \nits  international  branches,  franchise  stores,  and  online  shop.  It  also  conducts  original  design \nmanufacturing for international brands.9 The project team identified Gobi as a suitable candidate \nfor the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support given the company\u2019s strong track record, export \norientation, and potential to create jobs and positively impact herders through its scale. Gobi is a \nparticipating enterprise of ADB\u2019s Agriculture and Rural Development Project.10 \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n \n9. \nfinancing primary and secondary cashmere processing expansion. \n \n\nThe  project  will  support  Gobi\u2019s  $31.4  million  investment  plan  during  2018\u20132019  by \n\n                                                \n5  Government of Mongolia, National Statistics Office.

Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fHigher local value addition. The project will help Gobi develop primary and secondary \n10. \nprocessing capacity, adding more value in the domestic cashmere market and further integrating \nthe cashmere value chain. Gobi plans to expand its primary cashmere processing capacity from \n750 tons per annum (tpa) to 2,000 tpa by building a new primary processing and storage facility. \nThe location of the new primary processing facility is yet to be finalized but is planned to be in Tuv  \nprovince,11 subject to government approval. An estimated 200 workers from the vicinity, where \nthe poverty rate is significantly higher than in Ulaanbaatar,12 will be hired to work in the factory. \nFor its secondary processing capacity, Gobi plans to increase its spinning capacity from 350 tpa \nto  700  tpa  and  sewing  capacity  from  100,000  to  250,000  pieces  per  annum  by  purchasing \nequipment  and  building  a  new  secondary  processing  facility  adjacent  to  its  current  facility  in \nUlaanbaatar. \n \nImproved rural livelihoods. The increase in primary processing and storage capacity will \n11. \nallow Gobi to procure more raw cashmere from herders. Gobi procures raw cashmere directly \nand indirectly from herders. During the raw cashmere production season (March\u2013June of each \nyear), Gobi deploys its procurement team across Mongolia to inspect and purchase raw cashmere \ndirectly from herders. Gobi also purchases raw cashmere at its factory from intermediaries. About \n60% of Gobi\u2019s raw cashmere procurement is from its procurement team and 40% is received at \nits  factory  from  intermediaries.  Gobi\u2019s  procurement  team  directly  procured  108  tons  of  raw \ncashmere  from  437  herders  in  2017.  Gobi  plans  to  increase  the  share  of  raw  cashmere \nprocurement from its procurement team and direct procurement from herders (to at least 180 tons \nfrom 650 herders by 2022) to gain stronger control over its raw cashmere quality. Herders benefit \nfrom increased supply to Gobi, as Gobi provides a stable source of offtake for the communities \nfrom  which  it  procures,  unlike  PRC  traders  whose  procurement  is  more  volatile  depending  on \nPRC market demand and regulation. Herders ultimately benefit, as they are able to increase their \nproductivity  and  produce  higher-quality  cashmere,  which  results  in  higher  income.  Gobi  also \nprovides basic extension services to certain herders in the form of provision of goat blankets and \ncashmere-collecting  sacks.  Additionally,  as  Gobi  intends  to  locate  its  new  primary  processing \nfacility  outside  of  Ulaanbaatar,  Gobi  will  directly  contribute  to  the  local  economy  by  employing \nstaff from the local community and increasing procurement of raw cashmere from the vicinity. \n \n12. \nExport  diversification.  The  majority  (68%)  of  Gobi  customers  are  based  outside  of \nMongolia. While 60% of Gobi\u2019s sales are domestic, almost half of domestic sales are to foreign \ntourists, and 40% of Gobi\u2019s sales are exports. In addition to its 10 retail stores in Mongolia, Gobi \nhas 50 franchise stores and 5 branch stores operating in 34 cities across 13 countries. Gobi also \nproduces finished goods for 211 companies from 32 countries in accordance with the companies\u2019 \ndesign specifications. Gobi\u2019s export sales from its international branch stores and online channels \nare a relatively new development: its first international branch store opened in Berlin in November \n2016 and its online store started in February 2017. As Gobi\u2019s midterm strategy is to expand its \ninternational sales, it will give priority to marketing and selling its own-branded products abroad \nthrough its international branches, franchise stores, and online channel. \n \n13. \nIn  addition,  ADB  is  exploring  complementing  the  project  with  support  from  an  ongoing \ntechnical assistance (TA) that will help develop a corporate sustainability plan for Gobi to ensure \nthat  its  operations  across  the  value  chain  are  environmentally  sustainable,  productive,  and \nresilient.13 \n                                                \n11 The tentative location is 65 kilometers south of Ulaanbaatar and 3.5 kilometers from Zuunmod, the provincial center. \n12 The poverty rate in Sergelen district and the surrounding rural areas was estimated at 32.3%\u201338.0% in 2016, while \n\nthe poverty rate in Ulaanbaatar was estimated at 24.8% by the National Statistics Office and the World Bank. \n\n13 2016.

Manila. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n3. \n\nBorrower \n\n \n14. \nThe borrower is Gobi, a joint stock company incorporated in Mongolia and publicly listed \non the Mongolian Stock Exchange. Gobi is a vertically integrated manufacturer and the largest \ncashmere garment manufacturer in Mongolia. Gobi was founded as a state-owned enterprise in \n1981 with technical and financial support from the Government of Japan and was privatized in \n1993. Gobi procures raw cashmere, conducts primary and secondary processing in its own plants, \nand sells end products such as cashmere sweaters, coats, and scarfs to domestic and foreign \ncustomers. As one of the leading non-mining exporters of Mongolia, Gobi currently employs over \n1,700 people (more than two-thirds of whom are women), and operates 10 stores in Mongolia, \nand 50 franchise stores and 5 branch stores overseas. \n \nGobi\u2019s management team consists of specialists with substantial industry knowledge and \n15. \nexperience.  They  have  broad  experience  in finance,  manufacturing,  and  marketing  and  sales. \nBaatarsaikhan Tsagaach, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Gobi and the founder and president \nof  Tavan  Bogd  Group,  the  second  largest  conglomerate  in  Mongolia,  has  over  25  years  of \nmanagement experience. \n \n16. \nGobi\u2019s current major shareholders are Hide Inter LLC (with 34.0% ownership), FCI LLC \n(28.6%), and Tavan Bogd Trade LLC (21.5%). Hide Inter is a Japanese investment firm owned \nby Hideo Sawada (the president of Skymark Airlines Inc. and H.I.S. Co., Ltd., and the chairperson \nof Khan Bank) and his spouse, Mayumi Sawada. FCI is fully owned by Tavan Bogd Trade. Tavan \nBogd  Trade  is  Gobi\u2019s  parent  and  ultimate  holding  company,  with  50.1%  direct  and  indirect \nshareholdings. Tavan Bogd Trade is owned by Baatarsaikhan Tsagaach (60% share) along with \nhis spouse, Khulan Dashdavaa (20%), and his three siblings (20%). Tavan Bogd Trade and its \nsubsidiaries  (Tavan  Bogd  Group)  is  one  of  Mongolia\u2019s  largest  conglomerates  with  a  business \nportfolio spanning multiple industries including trading, manufacturing, importing and wholesaling, \nhospitality and tourism, and banking. Established in 1995, Tavan Bogd Group has 15 subsidiary \ncompanies and 4 affiliated businesses, employing over 10,000 people. Baatarsaikan Tsagaach \nis Gobi\u2019s ultimate controlling party. \n \n17. \nrisks were identified. Tax integrity due diligence was not required. \n \nB. \n \nImpacts.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts  and  consistent  with  key \n18. \nobjectives of the Action Program of the Government of Mongolia, 2016-2020: (i) a sustainable \neconomy  based  on  diversified  domestic  production  developed  by  (a)  creating  an  integrated \nsystem of production, transportation, processing, and supply of livestock-originated raw materials; \nand  (b)  supporting  foreign  and  domestic  investments;  and  (ii)  livestock  farming  production \nincreased  and  its  economic  turnover  improved,  and  advanced  technology  and  innovation \nintroduced.15  \n \n19. \nexport-oriented agribusiness value chain increased.  \n \n\nIntegrity  due diligence  was conducted.14 No significant  or  potentially  significant  integrity \n\nOutcome.

The outputs are (i) secondary cashmere processing operations in Ulaanbaatar \n\n20. \nexpanded and (ii) primary cashmere processing operations in rural Mongolia established. \n \nC. \n \n21. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  is  aligned  with \nADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which emphasizes the need to invest in agriculture to \nincrease productivity and strengthen links with global value chains.16 The project is aligned with \nall  three  strategic  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Mongolia,    2017\u20132020:  (i) \npromoting economic and social stability, (ii) developing infrastructure for economic diversification, \nand  (iii)  strengthening  environmental  sustainability. 17 The  project  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s \nIndependent  Evaluation  Department\u2019s  validation  of  the  country  partnership  strategy  and  its \nemphasis to promote diversification of the economy with a focus on improving the productivity of \nagribusinesses.18 The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s operational plan for regional cooperation and \nintegration,  as  it  supports  greater  regional  agribusiness  value  chains  and  greater  inclusion  of \nsmallholders into value chains.19 The support is expected to increase the number of smallholders \nsupplying  Gobi  as  well  as  increase  the  volume  they  supply.  Gobi\u2019s  exports  to  a  number  of \neconomies across the region will increase (e.g., Hong Kong, China; Japan; the PRC; the Republic \nof Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China) and will provide additional sales to Gobi\u2019s clients in these \neconomies. Further, Gobi will make equipment purchases for the project from companies based \nin the region, including those based in the PRC and Japan. ADB\u2019s financing is expected to further \nattract capital and partnerships from across the region. \n \n22. \nConsistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s operational plan for agriculture and natural resources, 2015\u20132020, which recommends \ngreater private sector agribusiness investment by ADB through working with strong agribusiness \nsponsors  adopting  best  practices.20 The  project  will  complement  ADB\u2019s  sovereign  assistance \nprogram  in  Mongolia,  which  aims  to  increase  the  value  addition  of  the  country\u2019s  rich  yet \nunderutilized  livestock  and  other  agricultural  resources  through  (i)  value  chain  investments  by \nagro-enterprises  and  cooperatives,  (ii)  capacity  strengthening  of  primary  producers  and \nprocessors,  (iii)  improvement  of  marketing  and  technical  capacity  of  agro-enterprises  and \ncooperatives, and (iv) development of Mongolian product brands.21 The project will also benefit \nfrom and complement the completed sovereign project that improved the livelihood of herders by \nensuring sustainable pasture management in Bayankhongor province, a region where Gobi has \nextensive raw cashmere procurement activities.22 \n \nD. \n \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n                                                \n16 ADB. 2014.

Gobi is \nsubject to international trade laws, including import duties. \nGobi has a management team led by Baatarsaikhan Tsagaach, chief executive officer, who is also \nthe president of Tavan Bogd Group, Gobi\u2019s parent company. He is supported by eight directors in \ncharge of each of the major business functions. \nJune 2018\u2013December 2019. Gobi plans to complete primary and secondary processing \nexpansions by 2019. \n[Redacted] \n\nThe project will rely on Gobi, which already operates similar facilities and equipment, for successful \noperation and maintenance. Gobi procures raw cashmere directly and indirectly from herders. Gobi \nplans to continue to increase the share of raw cashmere procurement from its procurement team to \ngain higher control over its raw cashmere quality. The entire manufacturing process, along with the \nmaintenance and quality control units, are directly managed by Gobi\u2019s chief operating officer. Gobi \nhas quality control managers who, at each stage of primary and secondary processing, oversee \nquality and make corrections on the spot. Gobi\u2019s technical management division is responsible for \nthe maintenance and repair of the equipment present at the factory. The domestic sales \ndepartment handles marketing and sales in the domestic market and the international sales \ndepartment handles marketing and sales for Gobi\u2019s exports. \nGobi will report quarterly on financial and operational key performance indicators, and annually on \nsafeguard and development indicators (i.e., output and outcome targets). \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank and Gobi Joint Stock Company. \n \nF. \n \n[Redacted] \n \nG. \n \n24. \nThis project will support an internationally competitive and export-oriented business model \nfor  higher  local  value  addition.  Gobi  is  an  inclusive  business  because  it  offers  sustainable \nlivelihoods and employment opportunities to poor Mongolians, particularly women. It is ADB\u2019s first \nnonsovereign project in the agribusiness sector in Mongolia. \n \n\nUnique Features \n\nIII. \n\nTHE ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n25. \nADB will extend a loan of up to $9 million to Gobi. The proposed loan tenor is 7 years with \na 2-year grace period. The parallel loan of up to $9 million to Gobi will have a tenor up to 7 years, \nincluding a grace period of up to 4 years. The main terms and conditions of ADB\u2019s proposed loan \nhave been agreed with Gobi. \n \n\n                                                \n23 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fB. \n \n26. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nADB assistance will add value in three areas: \n(i) \n\nSafeguards,  gender,  and  sustainability  best  practices.  ADB  will  help  Gobi \ndevelop  a robust  environmental  and  social management  plan following  the  best \ninternational  safeguard  practices,  including  climate  adaptation  measures  and  a \ngender  action  plan,  and  will  monitor  the  company\u2019s  progress  during  project \nimplementation. Also, the potential TA that ADB is exploring will help Gobi develop \nand implement a corporate sustainability plan (para. 13). \nDiversified funding base. Gobi has primarily financed its growth through equity \nand loans from local commercial banks. ADB\u2019s financing will give Gobi\u2019s business \na  valued  stamp  of  approval  to  further  attract  long-term  capital  and  partnerships \nfrom international sources. The cofinancing is an example of how ADB\u2019s financing \nhas mobilized another international lender. \nLong-term  financing.  ADB  will  provide  long-term  debt,  which  is  not  readily \navailable in Mongolia. ADB is in a unique position to offer such financing because \nof  its  understanding  of  agribusiness  (specifically  the  cashmere  industry)  in \nMongolia through past and ongoing sovereign projects. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nRisks \n\nC. \n \n[Redacted] \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nA. \n \n27. \nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009)  as  follows:  environment  (category  B),  involuntary  resettlement  (category  C), \nand indigenous peoples (category C).24 \n \n28. \nADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts  of the  project  and  the measures to avoid, minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate for  the \nadverse impacts in the safeguard reports and plans. The environmental and social measures and \nthe  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  Gobi  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts  are  deemed  adequate.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  requirements  for  general  corporate  finance,  a  corporate  audit  of  the  company\u2019s \nenvironmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS)  has  been  undertaken  as  well  as  a \ncompliance audit of existing facilities. Compliance with national, international, and ADB standards \nwere  assessed,  and  where  any  noncompliance  was  identified,  corrective  actions  were  prepared \nand  agreed  with  Gobi,  and  included  in  the  corrective  action  plan  (CAP).  The  CAP  includes \nnecessary remedial actions, budget and resources, and timelines and responsibilities for resolution \nof partial compliance issues. No issues of noncompliance were identified.  \n \n29. \nGobi  is  required  to  enhance  its  existing  management  system  into  a  compliant  ESMS, \nincorporating the CAP. The CAP recommends employing an additional staff member to effectively \ncarry  out  environmental  monitoring  and  reporting  tasks.  The  CAP  also  recommends  minor \nimprovements  to  occupational  health  and  safety  management.  Gobi  will  adopt  the  enhanced \nESMS satisfactory to ADB before ADB\u2019s first fund disbursement. Other operational improvements \nwill be enacted during 2019. ADB will closely monitor Gobi\u2019s ESMS and CAP implementation. \n\n                                                \n24 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f \n30. \nThe ESMS will be used to screen and assess activities related to Gobi\u2019s expansion. There \nare limited environmental impacts from the purchase of new machinery for the existing factories. \nPotential  environmental  impacts  during  the  construction and  operation  of  new  facilities include \ncontaminated wastewater discharges; discharges to air; generation of solid waste; occupational \nand  community  health  and  safety  risks;  and  temporary  construction  impacts  such  as  noise, \nvibration, and traffic. The ESMS will set out the processes and procedures to ensure compliance \nwith  national  laws,  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  other  social  requirements.  Initial \nenvironmental  examinations,  environmental  management  plans,  environmental  and  social \ncompliance audit reports, and other safeguard documents will be prepared by Gobi.  \n \n31. \nGobi also works directly with herders to improve cashmere production in the supply chain. \nThe company conducts training on goat raising and animal husbandry, resulting in more effective \nand sustainable farming practices from its suppliers. Countrywide issues related to goat raising, \nincluding impacts of extreme weather events and pasture land management, are being addressed \nby  the  Government  of  Mongolia,  partially  through  ADB  sovereign  loans,  grants,  and  TA.  25 \nPotential  climate  risks  to  new  factory  construction will  be  addressed under  ESMS  procedures, \nincluding considering flood and permafrost impacts during the design phase. \n \n32. \nGobi  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \nStrategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards.26 Gobi  will  report  regularly  to  ADB  on  (i)  its  compliance  with  such  laws  and  (ii)  the \nmeasures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people will be conducted \nin accordance with ADB requirements.27 \n \n33. \nThe project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on \nGender and Development (1998), Gobi has incorporated measures to promote gender equality \nand/or women\u2019s empowerment in its business activities. Gobi commits to implementing a gender \naction  plan. 28  Gobi  will  assign  capable  staff  to  conduct  monitoring  of  labor  issues  and \nimplementation  of  the  gender  action  plan;  this  monitoring  will  be  reflected  in  the  annual \nenvironmental and social monitoring report submitted to ADB. \n \nB. \n \n34. \nGobi was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n \n[Redacted] \n \nD. \n \n\nInvestment Limitations  \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nAssurances \n\n                                                \n25 Relevant projects include: ADB.
