The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical \nassistance (TA) for Capacity Building for Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Support, and if the Board \napproves  the  proposed  loans,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to me  by  the  Board,  will \napprove the TA.1 \n \n2. \nThe  program  comprises  an  integrated  approach  to  enable  women  entrepreneurs  and \nmicro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs)  in  Armenia  to  play  a  greater  role  in \neconomic development. The program has two components: (i) a policy-based loan to help fund \nbudget  allocations  to  strengthen  the  business  environment  and  the  Small  and  Medium \nEntrepreneurship  Development  National  Center  (SME  DNC)  of  Armenia2 and  its  support  for \nwomen  entrepreneurs  and  MSMEs;  and  (ii)  a  financial  intermediation  loan  (FIL)  to  enable \nparticipating financial institutions (PFIs) to provide local currency loans to MSMEs, of which at \nleast  50%  are  women's  MSMEs.3 The  program  is  supported  by  capacity  development  TA  to \nimprove the entrepreneurial capacity of women and to increase the capacity of  the SME DNC, \nthe project management unit of the German\u2013Armenian Fund (PMU GAF),4 and PFIs to provide \nsupport for women's entrepreneurship. The implementation period is 2013\u20132017. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nWomen  in  Armenia  are  not  reaching  their  economic  potential.  While  women\u2019s \neducational  achievements  in  Armenia  are  on  a  par  with  those  of  men,  women\u2019s  ownership  of \nenterprises  (31%)  and  share  of  management  positions  (13.5%)  are  below  regional  averages. \nWomen\u2019s formal labor force participation rate is declining (from 65% in 2001 to 54% in 2012). In \naddition  to  public  sector  jobs,  self-employment  is  a  core  occupation  for  women.  Most  women \nengage in small subsistence-based business activities in trade and retail services. While women \nare  increasingly  engaged  in  growth  sectors  including  agro  processing  and  tourism,  their \nparticipation in these sectors remains small. Mutually reinforcing social, market, and institutional \nconstraints  limit  women\u2019s  access  to  economic  opportunities  and  productive  resources,  and  to \nthe  development  of  entrepreneurial  attitudes.  Small  business  is  a  crucial  option  for  women  to \ngain a livelihood. Yet women often lack the business skills, knowledge, confidence, and access \nto networks to increase their entrepreneurial capacity, and have less access to credit and other \nfinancial services than men. \n \n4. \nAccess  to  affordable  finance  and  financial  services  remains  an  obstacle  for  many \nenterprises  in  Armenia.  Historically,  banks  have  been  disinclined  to  lend  to  non-top-tier \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The SME DNC  was established by the  government of Armenia in 2002 to provide support to entrepreneurs from \nannual small and medium-sized enterprise state support programs with resources allocated from the state budget. \n3  Under  the  program,  women's  MSMEs  are  defined  as  being  one  of  the  following:  (i)  at  least  50%  of  enterprise \nownership  is  controlled  by  women,  (ii)  at  least  60%  of  senior  managers  are  women,  or  (iii)  at  least  50%  of  the \nregistered employees of the enterprise are women (which is also to  contribute to the program target of women to \nbenefit from increased economic opportunities. (see Appendix 1). \n\n4  The PMU GAF was established by order N 518 of 14 September 2001 of the president of the CBA, as part of the \nCBA.  The  PMU  GAF  administers  liquidity  support  programs  to  the  finance  sector  provided  by  German \nDevelopment  Cooperation  through  KfW,  the World  Bank,  the  Russian  Federation,  and  other  sources  targeted  at \nSMEs and other defined sectors of the economy. \n\n\fenterprises,  citing  inadequate  collateral,  poor  business  plans,  and  lack  of  transparency. \nFinancial  institutions  (i) have limited  experience in  providing financial  products  and  services to \nwomen  entrepreneurs  and  MSMEs;  and  (ii)  because  of  the  nascent  local  capital  market,  face \ndifficulties  in  structuring  such  products  in  ways  which  can  help  protect  customers  against \ncurrency, interest rate, and tenor mismatch risks. \n \n5. \nMSME  financing  remains  inadequate.  In  2011,  there  were  about  150,000  registered \nMSMEs  in  Armenia,  of  which  about  60.0%,  or  90,000,  were  active. 5  Women's  MSMEs 6 \nrepresented about 11.0%, or 9,900, of active MSMEs. In 2010, about 13,600 new MSMEs were \nregistered,  of  which  about  3.0%,  or  400,  were  registered  by  women.7 The  total  MSME  sector \naccounted for 98.5% of all registered enterprises and contributed 43.0% of GDP and 42.5% of \nemployment, representing a doubling of the MSME contribution to the economy since 1999. The \nMSME share of Armenia\u2019s export volume was 18.0% in 2011, an increase from 14.3% in 2003,8 \nand about 33.0% of banks total lending portfolio went to MSMEs. \n \n6. \nFacilitating  women\u2019s  entrepreneurship  can  contribute  to  economic  growth.  Enhancing \nbusiness  skills,  financial  literacy,  and  confidence  in  their  entrepreneurial  abilities  will  enable \nwomen  to  build  productive  businesses  in  profitable  sectors,  operate  to  scale,  access  finance, \nand  benefit  from  economic  opportunities.  Providing  financial  support  in  the  form  of  start-up \nsupport,  loan  guarantees,  and  local  currency  loans  is  essential  for  women  to  invest  in  new \ntechnology,  equipment,  and  other  fixed  assets  needed  to  increase  their  productivity  and \ncompetitiveness.  Supporting  PFIs  through  the  local-currency-denominated  FIL  can  help  make \nthe  finance  sector  more  broadly  based,  competitive,  and  efficient.  It  will  allow  PFIs  to  provide \nlocal currency loans to MSMEs; contribute to the government\u2019s de-dollarization efforts;9 as well \nas  mitigate  currency,  interest  rate,  and  tenor  mismatch  risks.  By  focusing  on  MSMEs,  and \nwomen entrepreneurs in particular, the loan will help spread financial intermediation to outlying \nareas by developing financial services. \n \n7. \nMSME  development  has  been  recognized  as  one  of  the  key  development  priorities  for \nthe  government.  It  has  set  out  its  commitment  to  development  of  women  entrepreneurs  and \nMSMEs  through  the  Concept  for  SME  Development  Policy  and  Strategy  in  Armenia,  and  the \nLaw  on  State  Support  to  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises,  both  adopted  in  2000. 10  Annual \nprograms for state support of MSMEs have been implemented since 2001. In 2012, a national \nstrategy for  small  and medium  entrepreneurship  development11 was  drafted,  which  specifically \npromotes entrepreneurship among women and is in line with the government\u2019s On the Approval \nof  the  Gender  Policy  Concept  Paper, 12 the  Gender  Policy  Strategic  Action  Plan, 13 and  the \nGender  Policy  Action  Plan  for  2012. 14  In  2002,  the  SME  DNC  was  established  by  the \ngovernment  to  implement  the  annual  SME  state  support  programs  (footnote  2).  The  Law  On \nState  Support  to  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  requires  funding  for  implementation  of  the \nannual program to be allocated in the state budget. However, while the budget allocated to the \nMinistry  of  Economy  (MOE)  increased  8.1%  from  2009  to  2012,  the  budget  allocation  to  the \n                                                \n5  SME DNC. http://www.marketplace.smednc.am (accessed August 2012). \n6   There  is  no  legal  definition  for  women\u2019s  MSMEs.

The program will complement ADB\u2019s $65 \nmillion  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprise  Finance  Program  approved  in  201117 to  promote \nbroad-based  growth,  but  differs  by  (i)  offering  an  integrated  approach  to  support  women \nentrepreneurs;  (ii)  using  Asian  Development  Fund  resources  through  a  sovereign  operation, \nallowing  longer  and  more  favorable  terms  for  lending  to  MSMEs;  and  (iii)  mitigating  currency, \ninterest rate, and tenor mismatch risks.  \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe  impact  of  the  program  will  be  that  women  benefit  from  increased  economic \nopportunities. The outcome will be an improved enabling environment for women entrepreneurs. \n \nC. \n \n10. \nThe  program  will  have  two  components:  (i)  a  policy-based  loan,  and  (ii)  a  FIL.  The \npolicy-based  loan  will  have  four  outputs:  (i)  improved  institutional  framework  supports  women \nentrepreneurs  and  MSMEs,  (ii)  improved  capacity  of  women  entrepreneurs  and  MSMEs,  (iii) \nimproved access to finance by women entrepreneurs and MSMEs, and (iv)  improved business \nenvironment supports MSMEs. The FIL will help achieve output 3. \n \n11.   Output  1:  Improved  institutional  framework  supports  women  entrepreneurs  and \nMSMEs.  A  stronger  institutional  framework  will  improve  the  enabling  environment  for  women \nentrepreneurs and MSMEs through enhanced policy coordination. Under tranche 1, information \non  MSMEs  has  been  improved  through  (i)  defining  target  groups  through  implementation  of \nParticipatory  Appraisal  of  Competitive  Advantages  (PACA)  exercises  to  assess  the  role  of \nwomen  entrepreneurs  in  growth  sectors  of  the  economy,  and  (ii)  establishing  an  internal \nstrategic planning committee to improve coordination and support to women entrepreneurs and \nMSMEs.  As  an  integral  implementing  agency  in  government  efforts  to  strengthen  MSMEs, \ncorporate  governance  in  the  SME  DNC  has  been  strengthened  through  establishment  of  an \naudit committee to monitor financial and economic activities and ensure adequate systems for \ninternal control and risk management, and a strengthened approach to support start-ups. Under \ntranche  2,  the  SME  DNC  will  (i)  develop  a  database  to  include  at  least  10,000  entrepreneurs \nand  MSMEs,  (ii)  undertake  annual  surveys  of  MSMEs,  and (iii)  implement  an  action  plan  with \ntargets  and  indicators  for  developing  women  entrepreneurs  in  sectors  identified  in  the  PACA \nexercise.  The  MOE  will  (i)  adopt  and  implement  the  national  strategy  for  small  and  medium \nentrepreneurship  development;  and  (ii)  implement  an  interagency  coordination  working  group \n\n                                                \n15 The  budget  deficit  increased  from  1.2%  of  GDP  in  2008  to 7.9%  of  GDP  in  2009.  With  restrained spending,  the \nbudget deficit decreased to 2.8% of GDP in 2011. The budget allocation to the SME DNC was AMD400 million in \n2008. In 2009, it was increased as part of government anticrisis measures.  \n16 ADB. 2011. Country Operations Business Plan: Armenia, 2012\u20132013. Manila. \n17 ADB.  2011.

Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Finance Program. Manila. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fon  promoting  women\u2019s  entrepreneurship. 18  Corporate  governance  will  continue  to  be \nstrengthened  in  the  SME  DNC  by  (i)  appointing  new  independent  members  of  the  board  of \ntrustees, of which at least 50% will be women, and requiring board members to undergo training \non good  corporate governance  practices; (ii)  strengthening the  risk management  committee to \nenable  it  to  assist  with  risk  monitoring,  control  and  analysis  associated  with financial  products \nprovided by it and by ensuring that the committee comprises at least 50% women; (iii) adopting \ninternal  procedures  to  assess  credit  risk  related  to  provision  of  financial  products;  and  (iv) \nestablishing  appraisal  panels  for  fund  allocations  at  the  regional  level  involving  the  SME  DNC \nand stakeholders. In addition, the SME DNC will improve data collection, by registering start-up \nentrepreneurs according to sector and region, as well as those registered by women; and adopt \na tailored approach to support women entrepreneurs and MSME start-ups. \n \nOutput 2: Improved capacity of women entrepreneurs and MSMEs. Accessible and \n12. \ntargeted training  and  business  development  services (BDS)  inputs  will  contribute  to  enterprise \ncreation and development, and enhanced market access for women entrepreneurs and MSMEs. \nUnder tranche 1, partnerships have been developed between the SME DNC and two providers \nof training and BDS for women entrepreneurs and MSMEs, and eight start-up campaigns have \nbeen  conducted  using  specialized  education  strategies  to  promote  entrepreneurship.  A  pilot \nannual  awards  program  has  been  launched  by  the  MOE  where  11  awards  were  presented to \nwomen entrepreneurs and MSMEs. Under tranche 2, women entrepreneurs and MSMEs will be \nsupported through (i) delivery of at least 20 trainings for start-ups; (ii) implementation of at least \n4  awareness  campaigns  about  BDS  resources;  (iii)  improvement  of  SME  DNC\u2019s  website  and \nonline  market  place  to  meet  the  specific  needs  of  women  entrepreneurs;  and  (iv)  use  of \ninformation and communication technology (ICT) to increase the reach of start-up campaigns to \nserve at least 2,400 people annually, of which at least 50% will be women. Capacity building for \nwomen entrepreneurs and MSMEs will be strengthened through piloting a mentorship network \nfor  women  entrepreneurs,  and  leveraging  ICTs  to  make  the  mentorship  network  easily \naccessible  to  women.  In  addition,  the  MOE  awards  program  will  be  established  as  an  annual \ncampaign to promote women's entrepreneurship. \n \n13. \nOutput  3:  Improved  access  to  finance  by  women  entrepreneurs  and  MSMEs. \nImproved access to financial services by women entrepreneurs and MSMEs will enable them to \nincreasingly  build  productive,  profitable,  and  sustainable  businesses  in  existing  and  emerging \ngrowth sectors. Under tranche 1, the SME DNC adopted a revised loan guarantee scheme, and \nissued  loan  guarantees  to  MSMEs  as  well  as  start-ups  to  an  aggregate  value  of  $0.6  million; \n33% was provided to women entrepreneurs. Under tranche 2, the SME DNC will issue at least \n300 loan guarantees or new financial products to active MSMEs and start-ups for an aggregate \nvalue  of  $1.5  million;  at  least  50%  of  the  guarantees  will  be  to  women  entrepreneurs  and \nMSMEs. Under the FIL, loans will be made by PFIs to MSMEs, with at least 50% of the loans \ngoing to women's MSMEs. \n \n14. \nOutput 4: Improved business environment supports MSMEs. An improved business \nenvironment will enable MSMEs, including women entrepreneurs and MSMEs, to optimize their \npotential  and  contribute  to  economic  growth.  Under  tranche  1,  (i)  the  cost  of  registering \nbusinesses  has  been  reduced  through  the  elimination  of  a  business  registration  fee;  (ii) \nprocedures  for  paying  patent  fees  (income  tax  plus  value-added  tax)  have  been  simplified  by \nenabling businesses to pay such fees on flexible terms; (iii) tax reporting has been simplified by \neliminating  requirements  for  maintaining  special  tax  books, 19  which  is  expected  to  reduce \n\n                                                \n18 Agencies will include the SME DNC, the Armenian Development Agency, and the SME Council. \n19 Special tax books are the book of registration of revenues and the book of shipment of inventory holdings. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fInvestment and Financing Plan \n\ncompliance  costs  for  businesses  by  one-third;20 and  (iv)  the  Accounting  Center  provided  tax \ncounseling  services  to  MSMEs.  To  support  government  efforts  to  improve  the  business \nenvironment, the (i) establishment of a virtual one-stop shop to include efficient and up-to-date \naccess to information, products, and services for starting and growing businesses (micro, small, \nmedium-sized,  and  large)  to  scale,  including  for women entrepreneurs  and  MSMEs,  has  been \ninitiated;  and  (ii)  a  working  group  for  increasing  cooperation  between  the  SME  DNC,  the \nArmenian  Development  Agency  to  promote  micro,  small,  medium-sized,  and  large  enterprise \ndevelopment,  including  women  entrepreneurs  and  MSMEs,  has  been  established.  Under \ntranche  2,  the  business  environment  will  be  further  improved  as  follows:  (i)  a  virtual  one-stop \nshop will  be  implemented  to  provide  businesses  with efficient  access to information,  products, \nand  services  for  starting  and  growing  through  utilization  of  ICTs  and  consolidate  existing \ndatabases into one database on micro, small, medium-sized, and large enterprises in Armenia; \nand (ii) the MOE will adopt an action plan to ensure collaboration between the SME DNC and \nthe  Armenian  Development  Agency  in  their  support  to  micro,  small,  medium-sized,  and  large \nenterprise development. In addition, a platform for paying taxes via point-of-sale terminals and \nthrough the  official  website  of  the  State  Revenue  Committee  will  be  piloted  to further  broaden \nthe base for electronic tax reporting. The Accounting Center will also adopt a strategy to ensure \nongoing services to MSMEs, including the needs of women's MSMEs. \n \nD. \n \n15. \nVolatile global economic conditions may result in reduced flows from remittances, export \nearnings,  foreign  direct  investment,  and/or  official  sources  into  Armenia.  As  a  result,  the \ngovernment  faces  tough  socioeconomic  challenges  and  is  committed  to  addressing  them  with \nwell-designed  initiatives.  The  government  has  laid  out  its  medium-term  reform  priorities  in \nseveral  documents.  The  government  program  for  2012\u20132017  outlines  key  directions  of \ngovernment activities, which include developing the business and investment environment and \nimproving  financial  intermediation,  including  introducing  electronic  systems  for  business \nfor  doing  business  and \nregistration,  reducing  and  simplifying \nentrepreneurship,  and  simplifying  the taxation framework for  MSMEs. The government gender \npolicy action plan for 2012 outlines start-up support to women entrepreneurs as well as creation \nof new jobs for women in industry sectors. In addition, activities under the national strategy for \nsmall  and  medium  entrepreneurship  development  outlines  key  activities,  including  supporting \nstart-up  entrepreneurs;  providing  business  information,  counseling,  and  training;  and  ensuring \nthe  operation  of  the  Accounting  Center.  To  effectively  support  reform  priorities  which  will  help \ndevelopment  of  women  entrepreneurs  and  MSMEs,  the  government  has  requested  two  loans \ntotaling  the  equivalent  of  $40  million  in  special  drawing  rights  from  Asian  Development  Fund \nresources.  Investment  components  include  (i)  a  $20  million  policy-based  loan  for  budget \nallocations  aimed  at  implementing  state  support,  including  government  action  plans  and \nmeasures  to  further  improve  the  enabling  business  environment  for  MSMEs  and  in  particular \nwomen entrepreneurs and MSMEs;21 and (ii) a $20 million equivalent FIL for MSMEs, of which \nat  least  50%  will  be  women's  MSMEs.

The loan will \nhave  a  24-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum \nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions \nset forth in the draft loan agreement. It will be disbursed in two tranches of equal amounts upon \ncompletion  of  policy  actions  for  the  respective  tranches.  Budget  allocations  will  be  made  from \nthe  MOF  to  help  strengthen  the  business  environment  to  efficiently  provide  financial, \ninformation, advisory, and training support to start-up entrepreneurs and operating MSMEs. The \ngovernment and the CBA have requested the sovereign-guaranteed loan in various currencies \nequivalent  to  SDR13,035,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  32-\nyear  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe  draft  loan,  guarantee,  and  project  agreements.  The  CBA  will  relend  the  loan  proceeds  (in \nlocal currency equivalent) to PFIs22 that meet ADB\u2019s eligibility criteria and have demonstrated a \nwillingness and ability to design and offer loans to women's MSMEs.23 Relending to these PFIs \nwill  be  based  on  a  5-year  repayment  term  and  a  fixed  interest  rate.24 The  CBA  will  bear  the \nforeign  exchange  risk.  PFIs  will  onlend  these  funds  by  making  loans  to  MSMEs  to  finance \nsubprojects that meet ADB\u2019s eligibility and safeguards criteria. Each of these loans will (i) have \na repayment term of up to 7 years, (ii) have a market-based interest rate, and (iii) cover at least \n80% of the subproject costs. Among the PFIs, (i) loans from the commercial banks will have a \nceiling  of  $250,000  equivalent  and  a  free  limit  of  $150,000  equivalent,  and  (ii)  loans  from \nuniversal credit organizations (UCOs) will have a ceiling of $50,000 equivalent.25 At least 50% of \nthe total number of loans to the MSMEs should be to women's MSMEs. The aggregate amount \nof loans available to each MSME from all PFIs is $250,000 equivalent. PFIs will independently \nassess creditworthiness of borrowers and determine commercial terms and conditions of loans. \n \n \n\n                                                \n22 Following discussions with the CBA, ADB has carried out due diligence on four applicant PFIs. Due diligence has \nbeen  completed  for  ACBA-Credit  Agricole  Bank,  and  CARD  AgroCredit  Universal  Credit  Organization  and  is \nexpected  to  be  completed  for  Armeconombank  and  Araratbank  by  October  2012.  Final  selection  of  PFIs  will  be \nagreed between the CBA and ADB. It is anticipated that one or more additional PFIs may be added to the program, \nprovided eligibility requirements as stipulated under the program have been met.  \n\n23 Financial intermediation loan allocations will be made to  at least four PFIs to an aggregate amount of $14 million. \nThe  remaining  $6  million  equivalent  will  be  allocated  among  additional  PFIs  that  meet  eligibility  criteria  during \nimplementation.  If there  is  any  change  to  the  composition of  the  PFIs,  and/or  if there  is a  need  to  reallocate  the \nproceeds  of  the  FIL  for  more effective  project implementation,  the  CBA shall  reallocate  the  FIL  proceeds  among \nthe PFIs in a manner acceptable to ADB.  \n\n24 This interest rate will be based on the average of the prevailing CBA refinancing rate and the 5-year government \n\nbond yield. It will be determined at the time of the relending to the PFIs. \n\n25 Loans from banks that are above the free limit are subject to ADB prior concurrence. Loans from the banks that are \nbelow the free limit and loans from the UCO are not subject to ADB prior concurrence, with the exception of the \nfirst five loans from each of the banks and the UCO. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \n17. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  program\u2019s  executing  agency.  The  MOE \n(through the SME DNC) will be the implementing agency for the policy-based component. The \nCBA  (through  the  PMU  GAF)  and  PFIs  will  be  implementing  agencies  for  the  financial \nintermediation component. Each PFI will establish a project management unit for monitoring and \nreporting  of  FIL  proceeds.  Implementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  2  and \ndescribed  in  detail  in  the  project  administration  manual  (PAM).26 The  proceeds  of  the  policy-\nbased  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  disbursement  procedures  and  related \nrequirements for program loans.27 ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds, \nand to verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \n\nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nJanuary 2013\u2013June 2017 \n30 June 2017 \n31 December 2017 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated program completion date \nEstimated loan closing date  \nProgram management \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nOversight body \nExecuting agency \nKey implementing agencies \n\n(iv) \n\nImplementation units \n\nDisbursement \n\nCBA \nMinistry of Finance \nPolicy-based loan: Ministry of Economy through SME DNC \nFIL: CBA through PMU GAF; PFIs \nTechnical assistance: Ministry of Economy through SME DNC \nEach PFI to establish a PMU within its organization, as detailed in PAM.  \nThe FIL proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  CBA  =  Central  Bank  of  Armenia,  PAM  =  project  administration  manual,  PFI  = \nparticipating financial institution, PMU GAF = project management unit of the German\u2013Armenian Fund, SME DNC = \nSmall and Medium Enterprise Development National Center. \nSources: Asian Development Bank, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Economy. \n \n18. \nSubloans  to  MSMEs  are  expected  to  range  from  $2,000\u2013$15,000  equivalent  and  are \nlikely to be used for procurement of raw materials, agricultural and food processing equipment, \nmachinery  and  other  goods.  More  than  41.8%  of  Armenia\u2019s  imports  in  2011  (43.2%  in  2010) \nwere from non-ADB members. Of total imports, 20.0% (10.3% excluding mineral fuels and oils) \ncame from the Russian Federation and 6.9% from Ukraine. In light of Armenia's extensive trade \nwith non-ADB members and relatively small size of individual transactions, it will be difficult and \nexpensive for the PFIs to ensure that all procurement is of raw material, equipment and goods \noriginating in ADB members. In other instances of MSME procurement originating in non-ADB \nmembers  in  Armenia  (footnote  17),  Kazakhstan 28  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic 29 ,  procurement \nwaivers  were  granted  by  the  Board  in  connection  with  similar  ADB  FILs.  With  this  in  view,  a \nrequest  for  ADB  Board  approval  is  being  made  pursuant  to  Article  14(ix)  of  the  Agreement \nEstablishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the  Charter) to  approve  procurement  of  goods  by \nMSME borrowers under the FIL from non-ADB members. \n \n \n\n                                                \n26 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 ADB. 1998.

It will have two outputs: (i) increased capacity of the SME DNC, PMU GAF, \nand  PFIs  to  support  women  entrepreneurs;  and  (ii)  strengthened  awareness  and  technical \ncapacity  of  women  entrepreneurs  and  business  support  organizations  to  ensure  women \nentrepreneurs can benefit from increased credit resources under the FIL component. The TA is \nestimated  to  cost  $630,000.  ADB  will  provide  $600,000  from  its  Technical  Assistance  Special \nFund (TASF\u2013IV), and the government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart \nstaff,  office space,  workshop  venues,  radio  and  television  time  for  communication  campaigns, \nand  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  3  years  during  program \nimplementation. The MOE (through the SME DNC) will be the implementing agency for the TA. \nADB and the SME DNC will jointly review implementation progress. The TA will require services \nof  three  international  consultants  (9  person-months  total)  and  eight  national  consultants  (68 \nperson-months  total).30 Consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  TA  resources  will  be \ndisbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nGovernance \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n20. \nADB  has  designed  the  program  in  collaboration  with  the  government,  PFIs,  and  other \nstakeholders.  An  assessment  of  the  needs  of  women's  MSMEs  was  prepared.  Due  diligence \nconfirmed the demand for local-currency-denominated, fixed-rate loans by PFIs, which can fund \nmarket-based  loans  to  women's  MSMEs.  Demand  for  loan  guarantees  and  other  financial \nservices  from  the  SME  DNC  targeted  at  start-up  businesses,  including  women  entrepreneurs, \nwas  also  assessed.  PFI  eligibility  criteria  were  defined  and  the  selection  process  identified \npotential PFIs. Financial and integrity due diligence has been completed for two PFIs, for which \nthe results are deemed adequate.31\n \n \nB. \n \n21. \nADB\u2019s  requirements  and  policies  on  financial  management  reporting  and  auditing, \nprocurement,  anticorruption,  and  environmental  and  social  safeguards  were  discussed  and \nagreed with the MOF and implementing agencies and incorporated into the program design. PFI \nenvironmental  and  social  management  systems  (ESMSs)  were  assessed  and  deemed \nadequate.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to,  and \ndiscussed  with,  the  government  and  the  MOF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 26). \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n \n22. \nPotential poverty reduction and social impacts were reviewed. A gender assessment  is \nreflected  in  the  project  documents  and  is  an  integral  part  of  the  sector  development  program \nwhich  is  categorized  thematically  as  gender  equity.  The  program  addresses  women\u2019s \nempowerment  by  narrowing  gender  disparities  through  access  to  financial  resources  and \nopportunities.32 \n                                                \n30 Indicative  terms  of  reference  are  included  in  the  PAM  and  the  Technical  Assistance  (accessible  from  the  list  of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n31 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nD. \n \n23. \nThe  policy-based  loan  will  not  trigger  safeguard  policies  and  is  categorized  C  for \nenvironment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  FIL  is  categorized  as \nfinancial  intermediation  for  environment  and  indigenous  peoples,  and  financial  intermediation \n(treated  as  C)  with  respect  to  involuntary  resettlement.  Subprojects  categorized  A  for \nenvironment  and  indigenous  peoples  or  having  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  will  not  be \neligible  for  financing  under  this  program.  Activities  included  in  ADB\u2019s  Prohibited  Investment \nActivities  List  are  excluded.  Each  PFI  will  implement  an  ESMS  acceptable  to  ADB  to  ensure \nproposals for subprojects are screened for environmental and social impacts and (if applicable) \nmitigating  measures  are  in  place.  The  program  will  ensure  women  entrepreneurs  and  ethnic \nminorities  have  access  to  training  and  MSME  credit  outreach  activities  of  the  program. \nSafeguards due diligence has been carried out according to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009)  requirements  for  financial  intermediations.  Assessed  PFIs,  except  one  PFI,  have  staff \ncapacity  and  an  established  Environment  and  Social  Management  System  Arrangement.  This \nPFI will be required to adopt an appropriate ESMS commensurate with the nature and risks of \nits  likely  future  portfolio.  For  all  PFIs,  improvement  is  needed  on  safeguards  categorization, \nscreening  and  review  procedures,  social  inclusion  of  ethnic  minorities,  and  performance \nmonitoring  and  reporting  to  process  category  B  projects  (for  environmental  safeguards).  ADB \nwill  ensure  that  ESMSs  of  PFIs  are  finalized  or  established  in  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements before any disbursement of funds from the ADB loan account for subprojects, and \nprovide capacity building workshops to PFI staff. Each PFI is required to designate at least one \nstaff member to be responsible for implementation of its ESMS. \n \nE. \n \n24.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.33 The program is classified as low risk since \n(i) the total loan amount is less than $200 million for the project and less than $50 million for the \npolicy-based loan, (ii) ADB had a good experience previously with a similar FIL in the country,34 \nand  (iii)  there  is  reasonable  capacity  and  experience  in  the  executing  and  implementing \nagencies. The benefits and impacts of the program are expected to outweigh its costs. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nWeak economic growth impacts \nbusiness opportunities and business \nclimate \n\nMitigating Measures \nImproving the policy and institutional frameworks that support rural \noutreach and women entrepreneurs and MSMEs, including their capacity \nand access to finance, will contribute to greater sector diversification and \nopportunities in business. \nEffective and coordinated donor support will contribute to ensure \nconsistency in reforms. \n\nExternal environment deteriorates, \ncausing delay in reforms to improve \nthe business environment \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  MSMEs  =  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises;  PFI  =  participating \nfinancial institution. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n25. \nThe  government  and  the  CBA  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \n\n                                                \n33 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Micro,  Small,  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nsafeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  the \nPAM  and  loan  documents.
