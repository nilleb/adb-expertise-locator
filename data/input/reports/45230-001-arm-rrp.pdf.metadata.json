I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based loan to Armenia; and (ii) a proposed loan to the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA), \nwith a sovereign guarantee from Armenia\u2014both for the Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Support \nSector Development Program (the program). The report also describes proposed technical \nassistance (TA) for Capacity Building for Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Support, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will \napprove the TA.1 \n \n2.  The program comprises an integrated approach to enable women entrepreneurs and \nmicro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in Armenia to play a greater role in \neconomic development. The program has two components: (i) a policy-based loan to help fund \nbudget  allocations  to  strengthen  the  business  environment  and  the  Small  and  Medium \nEntrepreneurship Development National Center (SME DNC) of Armenia2 and its support for \nwomen entrepreneurs and MSMEs; and (ii) a financial intermediation loan (FIL) to enable \nparticipating financial institutions (PFIs) to provide local currency loans to MSMEs, of which at \nleast 50% are women's MSMEs.3 The program is supported by capacity development TA to \nimprove the entrepreneurial capacity of women and to increase the capacity of the SME DNC, \nthe project management unit of the German\u2013Armenian Fund (PMU GAF),4 and PFIs to provide \nsupport for women's entrepreneurship. The implementation period is 2013\u20132017. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Women  in  Armenia  are  not  reaching  their  economic  potential.  While  women\u2019s \neducational achievements in Armenia are on a par with those of men, women\u2019s ownership of \nenterprises (31%) and share of management positions (13.5%) are below regional averages. \nWomen\u2019s formal labor force participation rate is declining (from 65% in 2001 to 54% in 2012). In \naddition to public sector jobs, self-employment is a core occupation for women. Most women \nengage in small subsistence-based business activities in trade and retail services. While women \nare  increasingly  engaged  in  growth  sectors  including  agro  processing  and  tourism,  their \nparticipation in these sectors remains small. Mutually reinforcing social, market, and institutional \nconstraints limit women\u2019s access to economic opportunities and productive resources, and to \nthe development of entrepreneurial attitudes. Small business is a crucial option for women to \ngain a livelihood. Yet women often lack the business skills, knowledge, confidence, and access \nto networks to increase their entrepreneurial capacity, and have less access to credit and other \nfinancial services than men. \n \n4.  Access  to  affordable  finance  and  financial  services  remains  an  obstacle  for  many \nenterprises  in  Armenia.  Historically,  banks  have  been  disinclined  to  lend  to  non-top-tier \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The SME DNC was established by the government of Armenia in 2002 to provide support to entrepreneurs from \nannual small and medium-sized enterprise state support programs with resources allocated from the state budget. \n3  Under the program, women's MSMEs are defined as being one of the following: (i) at least 50% of enterprise \nownership is controlled by women, (ii) at least 60% of senior managers are women, or (iii) at least 50% of the \nregistered employees of the enterprise are women (which is also to contribute to the program target of women to \nbenefit from increased economic opportunities. (see Appendix 1). \n4  The PMU GAF was established by order N 518 of 14 September 2001 of the president of the CBA, as part of the \nCBA.  The  PMU  GAF  administers  liquidity  support  programs  to  the  finance  sector  provided  by  German \nDevelopment Cooperation through KfW, the World Bank, the Russian Federation, and other sources targeted at \nSMEs and other defined sectors of the economy. ", "2 \nenterprises,  citing  inadequate  collateral,  poor  business  plans,  and  lack  of  transparency. \nFinancial institutions (i) have limited experience in providing financial products and services to \nwomen entrepreneurs and MSMEs; and (ii) because of the nascent local capital market, face \ndifficulties  in  structuring  such  products  in  ways  which  can  help  protect  customers  against \ncurrency, interest rate, and tenor mismatch risks. \n \n5.  MSME financing remains inadequate. In 2011, there were about 150,000 registered \nMSMEs  in  Armenia,  of  which  about  60.0%,  or  90,000,  were  active.5 Women's  MSMEs6 \nrepresented about 11.0%, or 9,900, of active MSMEs. In 2010, about 13,600 new MSMEs were \nregistered, of which about 3.0%, or 400, were registered by women.7 The total MSME sector \naccounted for 98.5% of all registered enterprises and contributed 43.0% of GDP and 42.5% of \nemployment, representing a doubling of the MSME contribution to the economy since 1999. The \nMSME share of Armenia\u2019s export volume was 18.0% in 2011, an increase from 14.3% in 2003,8 \nand about 33.0% of banks total lending portfolio went to MSMEs. \n \n6.  Facilitating women\u2019s entrepreneurship can contribute to economic growth. Enhancing \nbusiness skills, financial literacy, and confidence in their entrepreneurial abilities will enable \nwomen to build productive businesses in profitable sectors, operate to scale, access finance, \nand benefit from economic opportunities. Providing financial support in the form of start-up \nsupport, loan guarantees, and local currency loans is essential for women to invest in new \ntechnology,  equipment,  and  other  fixed  assets  needed  to  increase  their  productivity  and \ncompetitiveness. Supporting PFIs through the local-currency-denominated FIL can help make \nthe finance sector more broadly based, competitive, and efficient. It will allow PFIs to provide \nlocal currency loans to MSMEs; contribute to the government\u2019s de-dollarization efforts;9 as well \nas mitigate currency, interest rate, and tenor mismatch risks. By focusing on MSMEs, and \nwomen entrepreneurs in particular, the loan will help spread financial intermediation to outlying \nareas by developing financial services. \n \n7.  MSME development has been recognized as one of the key development priorities for \nthe government. It has set out its commitment to development of women entrepreneurs and \nMSMEs through the Concept for SME Development Policy and Strategy in Armenia, and the \nLaw  on  State  Support  to  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises,  both  adopted  in  2000.10 Annual \nprograms for state support of MSMEs have been implemented since 2001. In 2012, a national \nstrategy for small and medium entrepreneurship development11 was drafted, which specifically \npromotes entrepreneurship among women and is in line with the government\u2019s On the Approval \nof the Gender Policy Concept Paper,12 the Gender Policy Strategic Action Plan,13 and the \nGender  Policy  Action  Plan  for  2012.14 In  2002,  the  SME  DNC  was  established  by  the \ngovernment to implement the annual SME state support programs (footnote 2). The Law On \nState Support to Small and Medium Enterprises requires funding for implementation of the \nannual program to be allocated in the state budget. However, while the budget allocated to the \nMinistry of Economy (MOE) increased 8.1% from 2009 to 2012, the budget allocation to the \n                                                \n5  SME DNC. http://www.marketplace.smednc.am (accessed August 2012). \n6  There is no legal definition for women\u2019s MSMEs.

The program is consistent with ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2012\u20132013 for \nArmenia, which aims to increase the role of women entrepreneurs and SMEs.16 In developing \nthe program, consultations were held with the government, donors, potential PFIs, women\u2019s \nassociations, women business leaders, and academe. The program will complement ADB\u2019s $65 \nmillion Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Finance Program approved in 201117 to promote \nbroad-based  growth,  but  differs  by  (i)  offering  an  integrated  approach  to  support  women \nentrepreneurs; (ii) using Asian Development Fund resources through a sovereign operation, \nallowing longer and more favorable terms for lending to MSMEs; and (iii) mitigating currency, \ninterest rate, and tenor mismatch risks.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  impact  of  the  program  will  be  that  women  benefit  from  increased  economic \nopportunities. The outcome will be an improved enabling environment for women entrepreneurs. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n10.  The program will have two components: (i) a policy-based loan, and (ii) a FIL. The \npolicy-based loan will have four outputs: (i) improved institutional framework supports women \nentrepreneurs and MSMEs, (ii) improved capacity of women entrepreneurs and MSMEs, (iii) \nimproved access to finance by women entrepreneurs and MSMEs, and (iv) improved business \nenvironment supports MSMEs. The FIL will help achieve output 3. \n \n11.   Output 1: Improved institutional framework supports women entrepreneurs and \nMSMEs. A stronger institutional framework will improve the enabling environment for women \nentrepreneurs and MSMEs through enhanced policy coordination. Under tranche 1, information \non MSMEs has been improved through (i) defining target groups through implementation of \nParticipatory Appraisal of Competitive Advantages (PACA) exercises to assess the role of \nwomen  entrepreneurs  in  growth  sectors  of  the  economy,  and  (ii)  establishing  an  internal \nstrategic planning committee to improve coordination and support to women entrepreneurs and \nMSMEs. As an integral implementing agency in government efforts to strengthen MSMEs, \ncorporate governance in the SME DNC has been strengthened through establishment of an \naudit committee to monitor financial and economic activities and ensure adequate systems for \ninternal control and risk management, and a strengthened approach to support start-ups. Under \ntranche 2, the SME DNC will (i) develop a database to include at least 10,000 entrepreneurs \nand MSMEs, (ii) undertake annual surveys of MSMEs, and (iii) implement an action plan with \ntargets and indicators for developing women entrepreneurs in sectors identified in the PACA \nexercise. The MOE will (i) adopt and implement the national strategy for small and medium \nentrepreneurship development; and (ii) implement an interagency coordination working group \n                                                \n15 The budget deficit increased from 1.2% of GDP in 2008 to 7.9% of GDP in 2009. With restrained spending, the \nbudget deficit decreased to 2.8% of GDP in 2011. The budget allocation to the SME DNC was AMD400 million in \n2008. In 2009, it was increased as part of government anticrisis measures.  \n16 ADB. 2011. Country Operations Business Plan: Armenia, 2012\u20132013. Manila. \n17 ADB. 2011.

In addition, the SME DNC will improve data collection, by registering start-up \nentrepreneurs according to sector and region, as well as those registered by women; and adopt \na tailored approach to support women entrepreneurs and MSME start-ups. \n \n12.  Output 2: Improved capacity of women entrepreneurs and MSMEs. Accessible and \ntargeted training and business development services (BDS) inputs will contribute to enterprise \ncreation and development, and enhanced market access for women entrepreneurs and MSMEs. \nUnder tranche 1, partnerships have been developed between the SME DNC and two providers \nof training and BDS for women entrepreneurs and MSMEs, and eight start-up campaigns have \nbeen conducted using specialized education strategies to promote entrepreneurship. A pilot \nannual awards program has been launched by the MOE where 11 awards were presented to \nwomen entrepreneurs and MSMEs. Under tranche 2, women entrepreneurs and MSMEs will be \nsupported through (i) delivery of at least 20 trainings for start-ups; (ii) implementation of at least \n4 awareness campaigns about BDS resources; (iii) improvement of SME DNC\u2019s website and \nonline  market  place  to  meet  the  specific  needs  of  women  entrepreneurs;  and  (iv)  use  of \ninformation and communication technology (ICT) to increase the reach of start-up campaigns to \nserve at least 2,400 people annually, of which at least 50% will be women. Capacity building for \nwomen entrepreneurs and MSMEs will be strengthened through piloting a mentorship network \nfor  women  entrepreneurs,  and  leveraging  ICTs  to  make  the  mentorship  network  easily \naccessible to women. In addition, the MOE awards program will be established as an annual \ncampaign to promote women's entrepreneurship. \n \n13.  Output  3:  Improved  access  to  finance  by  women  entrepreneurs  and  MSMEs. \nImproved access to financial services by women entrepreneurs and MSMEs will enable them to \nincreasingly build productive, profitable, and sustainable businesses in existing and emerging \ngrowth sectors. Under tranche 1, the SME DNC adopted a revised loan guarantee scheme, and \nissued loan guarantees to MSMEs as well as start-ups to an aggregate value of $0.6 million; \n33% was provided to women entrepreneurs. Under tranche 2, the SME DNC will issue at least \n300 loan guarantees or new financial products to active MSMEs and start-ups for an aggregate \nvalue of $1.5 million; at least 50% of the guarantees will be to women entrepreneurs and \nMSMEs. Under the FIL, loans will be made by PFIs to MSMEs, with at least 50% of the loans \ngoing to women's MSMEs. \n \n14.  Output 4: Improved business environment supports MSMEs. An improved business \nenvironment will enable MSMEs, including women entrepreneurs and MSMEs, to optimize their \npotential  and  contribute  to  economic  growth.  Under  tranche  1,  (i)  the  cost  of  registering \nbusinesses  has  been  reduced  through  the  elimination  of  a  business  registration  fee;  (ii) \nprocedures for paying patent fees (income tax plus value-added tax) have been simplified by \nenabling businesses to pay such fees on flexible terms; (iii) tax reporting has been simplified by \neliminating  requirements  for  maintaining  special  tax  books,19 which  is  expected  to  reduce \n                                                \n18 Agencies will include the SME DNC, the Armenian Development Agency, and the SME Council. \n19 Special tax books are the book of registration of revenues and the book of shipment of inventory holdings. \n ", "5 \ncompliance costs for businesses by one-third;20 and (iv) the Accounting Center provided tax \ncounseling  services  to  MSMEs.  To  support  government  efforts  to  improve  the  business \nenvironment, the (i) establishment of a virtual one-stop shop to include efficient and up-to-date \naccess to information, products, and services for starting and growing businesses (micro, small, \nmedium-sized, and large) to scale, including for women entrepreneurs and MSMEs, has been \ninitiated;  and  (ii)  a  working  group  for  increasing  cooperation  between  the  SME  DNC,  the \nArmenian Development Agency to promote micro, small, medium-sized, and large enterprise \ndevelopment,  including  women  entrepreneurs  and  MSMEs,  has  been  established.  Under \ntranche 2, the business environment will be further improved as follows: (i) a virtual one-stop \nshop will be implemented to provide businesses with efficient access to information, products, \nand  services  for  starting  and  growing  through  utilization  of  ICTs  and  consolidate  existing \ndatabases into one database on micro, small, medium-sized, and large enterprises in Armenia; \nand (ii) the MOE will adopt an action plan to ensure collaboration between the SME DNC and \nthe Armenian Development Agency in their support to micro, small, medium-sized, and large \nenterprise development. In addition, a platform for paying taxes via point-of-sale terminals and \nthrough the official website of the State Revenue Committee will be piloted to further broaden \nthe base for electronic tax reporting. The Accounting Center will also adopt a strategy to ensure \nongoing services to MSMEs, including the needs of women's MSMEs. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plan \n \n15.  Volatile global economic conditions may result in reduced flows from remittances, export \nearnings,  foreign  direct  investment,  and/or  official  sources  into  Armenia.  As  a  result,  the \ngovernment faces tough socioeconomic challenges and is committed to addressing them with \nwell-designed  initiatives.  The  government  has  laid  out  its  medium-term  reform  priorities  in \nseveral  documents.  The  government  program  for  2012\u20132017  outlines  key  directions  of \ngovernment activities, which include developing the business and investment environment and \nimproving  financial  intermediation,  including  introducing  electronic  systems  for  business \nregistration,  reducing  and  simplifying  the  range  of  permits  for  doing  business  and \nentrepreneurship, and simplifying the taxation framework for MSMEs. The government gender \npolicy action plan for 2012 outlines start-up support to women entrepreneurs as well as creation \nof new jobs for women in industry sectors. In addition, activities under the national strategy for \nsmall and medium entrepreneurship development outlines key activities, including supporting \nstart-up entrepreneurs; providing business information, counseling, and training; and ensuring \nthe operation of the Accounting Center. To effectively support reform priorities which will help \ndevelopment of women entrepreneurs and MSMEs, the government has requested two loans \ntotaling the equivalent of $40 million in special drawing rights from Asian Development Fund \nresources.  Investment  components  include  (i)  a  $20  million  policy-based  loan  for  budget \nallocations  aimed  at  implementing  state  support,  including  government  action  plans  and \nmeasures to further improve the enabling business environment for MSMEs and in particular \nwomen entrepreneurs and MSMEs;21 and (ii) a $20 million equivalent FIL for MSMEs, of which \nat least 50% will be women's MSMEs.

Budget allocations will be made from \nthe  MOF  to  help  strengthen  the  business  environment  to  efficiently  provide  financial, \ninformation, advisory, and training support to start-up entrepreneurs and operating MSMEs. The \ngovernment and the CBA have requested the sovereign-guaranteed loan in various currencies \nequivalent to SDR13,035,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will have a 32-\nyear term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan, guarantee, and project agreements. The CBA will relend the loan proceeds (in \nlocal currency equivalent) to PFIs22 that meet ADB\u2019s eligibility criteria and have demonstrated a \nwillingness and ability to design and offer loans to women's MSMEs.23 Relending to these PFIs \nwill be based on a 5-year repayment term and a fixed interest rate.24 The CBA will bear the \nforeign exchange risk. PFIs will onlend these funds by making loans to MSMEs to finance \nsubprojects that meet ADB\u2019s eligibility and safeguards criteria. Each of these loans will (i) have \na repayment term of up to 7 years, (ii) have a market-based interest rate, and (iii) cover at least \n80% of the subproject costs. Among the PFIs, (i) loans from the commercial banks will have a \nceiling of $250,000 equivalent and a free limit of $150,000 equivalent, and (ii) loans from \nuniversal credit organizations (UCOs) will have a ceiling of $50,000 equivalent.25 At least 50% of \nthe total number of loans to the MSMEs should be to women's MSMEs. The aggregate amount \nof loans available to each MSME from all PFIs is $250,000 equivalent. PFIs will independently \nassess creditworthiness of borrowers and determine commercial terms and conditions of loans. \n \n \n                                                \n22 Following discussions with the CBA, ADB has carried out due diligence on four applicant PFIs. Due diligence has \nbeen completed for ACBA-Credit Agricole Bank, and CARD AgroCredit Universal Credit Organization and is \nexpected to be completed for Armeconombank and Araratbank by October 2012. Final selection of PFIs will be \nagreed between the CBA and ADB. It is anticipated that one or more additional PFIs may be added to the program, \nprovided eligibility requirements as stipulated under the program have been met.  \n23 Financial intermediation loan allocations will be made to at least four PFIs to an aggregate amount of $14 million. \nThe remaining $6 million equivalent will be allocated among additional PFIs that meet eligibility criteria during \nimplementation. If there is any change to the composition of the PFIs, and/or if there is a need to reallocate the \nproceeds of the FIL for more effective project implementation, the CBA shall reallocate the FIL proceeds among \nthe PFIs in a manner acceptable to ADB.  \n24 This interest rate will be based on the average of the prevailing CBA refinancing rate and the 5-year government \nbond yield. It will be determined at the time of the relending to the PFIs. \n25 Loans from banks that are above the free limit are subject to ADB prior concurrence. Loans from the banks that are \nbelow the free limit and loans from the UCO are not subject to ADB prior concurrence, with the exception of the \nfirst five loans from each of the banks and the UCO. \n ", "7 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  program\u2019s  executing  agency.  The  MOE \n(through the SME DNC) will be the implementing agency for the policy-based component. The \nCBA  (through  the  PMU  GAF)  and  PFIs  will  be  implementing  agencies  for  the  financial \nintermediation component. Each PFI will establish a project management unit for monitoring and \nreporting  of  FIL  proceeds.  Implementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  2  and \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual (PAM).26 The proceeds of the policy-\nbased loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s disbursement procedures and related \nrequirements for program loans.27 ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds, \nand to verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2013\u2013June 2017 \nEstimated program completion date  30 June 2017 \nEstimated loan closing date   31 December 2017 \nProgram management \n(i)  Oversight body  CBA \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Finance \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Policy-based loan: Ministry of Economy through SME DNC \nFIL: CBA through PMU GAF; PFIs \nTechnical assistance: Ministry of Economy through SME DNC \n(iv)  Implementation units  Each PFI to establish a PMU within its organization, as detailed in PAM.  \nDisbursement  The FIL proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CBA = Central Bank of Armenia, PAM = project administration manual, PFI = \nparticipating financial institution, PMU GAF = project management unit of the German\u2013Armenian Fund, SME DNC = \nSmall and Medium Enterprise Development National Center. \nSources: Asian Development Bank, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Economy. \n \n18.  Subloans to MSMEs are expected to range from $2,000\u2013$15,000 equivalent and are \nlikely to be used for procurement of raw materials, agricultural and food processing equipment, \nmachinery and other goods. More than 41.8% of Armenia\u2019s imports in 2011 (43.2% in 2010) \nwere from non-ADB members. Of total imports, 20.0% (10.3% excluding mineral fuels and oils) \ncame from the Russian Federation and 6.9% from Ukraine. In light of Armenia's extensive trade \nwith non-ADB members and relatively small size of individual transactions, it will be difficult and \nexpensive for the PFIs to ensure that all procurement is of raw material, equipment and goods \noriginating in ADB members. In other instances of MSME procurement originating in non-ADB \nmembers  in  Armenia  (footnote  17),  Kazakhstan28 and the  Kyrgyz  Republic29,  procurement \nwaivers were granted by the Board in connection with similar ADB FILs. With this in view, a \nrequest for ADB Board approval is being made pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the Agreement \nEstablishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter) to approve procurement of goods by \nMSME borrowers under the FIL from non-ADB members. \n \n \n                                                \n26 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 ADB. 1998.

It will have two outputs: (i) increased capacity of the SME DNC, PMU GAF, \nand PFIs to support women entrepreneurs; and (ii) strengthened awareness and technical \ncapacity  of  women  entrepreneurs  and  business  support  organizations  to  ensure  women \nentrepreneurs can benefit from increased credit resources under the FIL component. The TA is \nestimated to cost $630,000. ADB will provide $600,000 from its Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF\u2013IV), and the government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart \nstaff, office space, workshop venues, radio and television time for communication campaigns, \nand other in-kind contributions. The TA will be implemented over  3 years during program \nimplementation. The MOE (through the SME DNC) will be the implementing agency for the TA. \nADB and the SME DNC will jointly review implementation progress. The TA will require services \nof three international consultants (9 person-months total) and eight national consultants (68 \nperson-months total).30 Consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  TA  resources  will  be \ndisbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n20.  ADB has designed the program in collaboration with the government, PFIs, and other \nstakeholders. An assessment of the needs of women's MSMEs was prepared. Due diligence \nconfirmed the demand for local-currency-denominated, fixed-rate loans by PFIs, which can fund \nmarket-based  loans to women's  MSMEs.  Demand for  loan guarantees  and  other financial \nservices from the SME DNC targeted at start-up businesses, including women entrepreneurs, \nwas also assessed. PFI eligibility criteria were defined and the selection process identified \npotential PFIs. Financial and integrity due diligence has been completed for two PFIs, for which \nthe results are deemed adequate.31 \n \nB.  Governance \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s  requirements  and  policies  on  financial  management  reporting  and  auditing, \nprocurement,  anticorruption,  and  environmental  and  social  safeguards  were  discussed  and \nagreed with the MOF and implementing agencies and incorporated into the program design. PFI \nenvironmental  and  social  management  systems  (ESMSs)  were  assessed  and  deemed \nadequate. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained  to, and \ndiscussed  with,  the  government  and  the  MOF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 26). \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n22.  Potential poverty reduction and social impacts were reviewed. A gender assessment is \nreflected in the project documents and is an integral part of the sector development program \nwhich  is  categorized  thematically  as  gender  equity.  The  program  addresses  women\u2019s \nempowerment  by  narrowing  gender  disparities  through  access  to  financial  resources  and \nopportunities.32 \n                                                \n30 Indicative terms of reference are included in the PAM and the Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2).  \n31 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nD.  Safeguards \n \n23.  The  policy-based  loan  will  not  trigger  safeguard  policies  and  is  categorized  C  for \nenvironment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  FIL  is  categorized  as \nfinancial intermediation for environment and indigenous peoples, and financial intermediation \n(treated  as  C)  with  respect  to  involuntary  resettlement.  Subprojects  categorized  A  for \nenvironment and indigenous peoples or having involuntary resettlement impacts will not be \neligible for financing under this program. Activities included in ADB\u2019s Prohibited Investment \nActivities List are excluded. Each PFI will implement an ESMS acceptable to ADB to ensure \nproposals for subprojects are screened for environmental and social impacts and (if applicable) \nmitigating measures are in place. The program will ensure women entrepreneurs and ethnic \nminorities  have  access  to  training  and  MSME  credit  outreach  activities  of  the  program. \nSafeguards due diligence has been carried out according to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) requirements for financial intermediations. Assessed PFIs, except one PFI, have staff \ncapacity and an established Environment and Social Management System Arrangement. This \nPFI will be required to adopt an appropriate ESMS commensurate with the nature and risks of \nits likely future portfolio. For all PFIs, improvement is needed on safeguards categorization, \nscreening  and  review  procedures,  social  inclusion  of  ethnic  minorities,  and  performance \nmonitoring and reporting to process category B projects (for environmental safeguards). ADB \nwill  ensure  that  ESMSs  of  PFIs  are  finalized  or  established  in  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements before any disbursement of funds from the ADB loan account for subprojects, and \nprovide capacity building workshops to PFI staff. Each PFI is required to designate at least one \nstaff member to be responsible for implementation of its ESMS. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n24.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.33 The program is classified as low risk since \n(i) the total loan amount is less than $200 million for the project and less than $50 million for the \npolicy-based loan, (ii) ADB had a good experience previously with a similar FIL in the country,34 \nand  (iii)  there  is  reasonable  capacity  and  experience  in  the  executing  and  implementing \nagencies. The benefits and impacts of the program are expected to outweigh its costs. \n \nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWeak economic growth impacts  Improving the policy and institutional frameworks that support rural \nbusiness opportunities and business  outreach and women entrepreneurs and MSMEs, including their capacity \nclimate  and access to finance, will contribute to greater sector diversification and \nopportunities in business. \nExternal environment deteriorates,  Effective and coordinated donor support will contribute to ensure \ncausing delay in reforms to improve  consistency in reforms. \nthe business environment \nADB = Asian Development Bank; MSMEs = micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises; PFI = participating \nfinancial institution. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n25.  The government and the CBA have assured ADB that implementation of the program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \n                                                \n33 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 Sector Assessment (Summary): Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in the \nPAM and loan documents. The government and the CBA have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the program, which are set forth in the loan, guarantee, and project agreements. It \nwas also agreed that the loans will not be made effective until the project agreements with at \nleast 2 PFIs are effective. The government and the CBA also agreed that no withdrawal will be \nmade from the ADB loan account for the FIL for any PFI until such PFI has established an \nESMS  to  the  satisfaction  of  ADB  and  appointed  designated  staff  that  are  trained  in \nimplementing the ESMS for screening prospective subprojects. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATIONS \n \n26.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the  policy-based  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR13,035,000  to \nArmenia  for  the  Women\u2019s  Entrepreneurship  Support  Sector  Development \nProgram, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; \nfor a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms \nand conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nloan agreement presented to the Board; and  \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR13,035,000 to the Central Bank \nof Armenia, to be guaranteed by Armenia, for the Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship \nSupport Sector Development Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with \nan interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan,  guarantee,  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n27.  I also recommend that the Board approve the proposal set out in paragraph 18 of this \nReport that goods procured from nonmember countries of ADB be eligible for financing from the \nloan provided to the Central Bank of Armenia, to be guaranteed by Armenia, for the Women\u2019s \nEntrepreneurship Support Sector Development Project.  \n \n28.  If the requisite affirmative vote of Directors representing not less than two-thirds of the \ntotal voting power of ADB's members, pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the Agreement Establishing \nthe Asian Development Bank, is not obtained for this recommendation and the Board approves \nonly the recommendation in paragraph 26, then goods procured only from member countries of \nADB will be eligible for financing from the loan. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n     President \n \n2 October 2012 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Reporting \nIndicators with Baselines  Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \nWomen benefit from  MSMEs contribution to gross  National Statistics  Government remains \nincreased economic  domestic product increases from  Office  committed to reform the \nopportunities  43.0% in 2011 to 47.0% in 2020    enabling environment for \n  (sex-disaggregated data has zero    women entrepreneurs \nbaseline)    and MSMEs \n     \nUnemployment for women  Global Gender Gap  Effective donor \ndecreases from 35% in 2011 to  Report, World  coordination  \n25% in 2020  Economic Forum    \n    Risks \nGender gap in labor force  Global Gender Gap  External environment \nparticipation decreases from 20%  Report, World  deteriorates, causing \nin 2011 to 15% in 2020  Economic Forum  delay in reforms to \nimprove the business \nenvironment  \n \nSocial norms take more \ntime to overcome \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved enabling  By 2017, percentage of new  State Registry  Effective interagency \nenvironment for  businesses registered by women  Agency  coordination \nwomen entrepreneurs  entrepreneurs reaches 20% from   \nthe 2010 level of 3%  Risk \nWeak economic growth \nimpact business \nopportunities and \nbusiness climate  A\np\nOutputs      Assumptions  p\ne\n1.
