The  program \naligns with the government\u2019s Seventh Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, and the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) country partnership strategy for Bangladesh, 2016\u20132020.2 The impact of the program \nis  strengthened  human  capital  formation.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  quality  and  equity  of \nprimary education for all children from pre-primary to grade 5. The program has three outputs; (i) \nquality  of  primary  education  improved;  (ii)  access  and  participation  to  primary  education \nenhanced;  and  (iii)  governance  and  management  of  primary  education  system  improved.  The \ntotal cost for the program is $14.7 billion, with $500 million financed by a concessional loan from \nADB. The program was approved in September 2018, and an advance financing of $65 million \nwas  disbursed  in  December  2018.  Additional  $60  million  was  disbursed  in  June  2019  on  the \nachievement  of  four  prior  results. 3    The  program  is  making  progress  to  achieve  2019 \ndisbursement-linked indicators (DLIs).  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nJustification \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe program will strengthen teaching-learning quality for children to acquire the essential \ngrade  level  competencies  stipulated  in  the  curriculum.  It  will  also  improve  governance  and \nmanagement  of  the  primary  education  system,  which  is  necessary  for  education  quality \nenhancement. To achieve these goals, the following areas need to be strengthened: (i) needs-\nbased  Continuous  Professional  Development  (CPD)  for  in-service  teacher  development,  (ii) \nclassroom  teaching  assessment  system  for  monitoring  teaching  quality,  and  (iii)  education \nmanagement  information  system  (EMIS)  for  monitoring  and  accountability.  The  proposed \ntransaction  technical  assistance  (TA)  of  $1.2  million,  to  be  financed  (on  a  grant  basis)  by  the \nJapan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR),  will  support  implementation  of  these  innovative \ninitiatives  in  the  initial  stage  of  the  program. 4  The  TA  activities  include  (i)  supporting  the \noperationalization  of    CPD  framework  (with  an  integrated  component  of  ICT-based  teacher \ntraining), (ii) providing technical support to update classroom observation tool, and (iii) structuring \nthe web-based integrated EMIS and conducting early-stage tests. The proposed scope and scale \nof  these  activities,  including  intensive  collaboration  between  ministries  and  other  development \npartners and access to international networks and experts, requires a transaction TA to ensure \nthe  successful  implementation  of  the  loan  program. 5 The  program  and  TA  align  with  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030, which calls for improving education.6 \n\n \n\n1  ADB. 2018.

The \nTA will support the operationalization of the CPD framework7, which takes a lifelong approach to \ntrain teachers (especially on subject content and pedagogy), by guiding the implementation and \nevaluation  of  teacher  development  programs.  This  includes  a  study  based  on  a  survey  of \nteachers\u2019 training needs and assessment of existing training system and capacity. The study will \npropose a plan to operationalize the CPD framework by supporting the incorporation of teacher \nneeds,  regular  assessments  of  teachers\u2019  classroom  performances,  and  improving  teachers\u2019 \nclassroom  practices  under  upgraded  academic  supervision  to  meet  teacher  competencies \nrequirements.  The study will also support the integration of ICT for teacher training, which is part \nof  the  structure  of  CPD  framework.  Cost-effective  options  for  online  learning,  including  open \nsource course management system such as Moodle, will be considered. The operationalization \nplan  will  be  piloted  in  selected  areas  based  on  needs.  The  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency (JICA) and ADB will closely coordinate in the work related to mathematics subject. This \nTA output supports output 1 (quality of primary education) of the ongoing program. \n \n4. \nDeliverables under this output will include: (i) survey report on teachers\u2019 training needs, \ncovering  gender  issues  and  analysis;  (ii)  operationalization  plan  for  CPD  framework  piloted  in \nselected areas; and (iii) technical inputs for the ICT platform for teacher training, composed of (a) \nonline and offline training platform, which is open for incorporating digitized training modules and \nthe e-teaching and learning materials and at least 50% of major users are women; (b) online and \noffline  teacher  assessment  modules;  and  (c)  database  in  line  with  the  requirements  on  data \nformatting for teacher management information system. \n\n \n5. \nOutput 2: Updated classroom observation tool for monitoring teaching practices. \nThe  TA  will  support  updating  the  classroom  observation  tool  from  3-scale  points  (not  good, \naverage,  fair)  to  at  least  5-scale  points  (by  adding  \u201cgood\u201d  and  \u201cvery  good\u201d)  with  scientifically \ndeveloped scoring rubric method to reflect the multiple dimensions of requirements on teaching \nquality  (including,  but  not  limited  to  pedagogy,  subject  knowledge,  student  engagement,  and \nclassroom  environment).  The  TA  will  support  the  improvement  of  the  capacity  of  academic \nsupervisors  (mainly  assistant  upazila 8  education  officers,  public  training  institute  instructors, \nupazila  resource  center  instructors,  and  headmasters).  Pilot  trainings  on  using  the  updated \nclassroom  observation  tool  will  be  provided  to  the  academic  supervisors  in  representative \nschools. This TA output supports output 1 (quality of primary education) of the ongoing program. \n \nDeliverables  under  Output  2  will  include:  (i)  sample  survey  of  selected  upazilas  and \n6. \nschools for classroom observations, with sex-disaggregated data collected and gender analysis \nconducted; (ii) updated classroom observation tool from the current 3-scale points to at least 5-\nscale points reflecting multiple dimensions on teaching quality; (iii) training on using the updated \nclassroom  observation tool  conducted for  selected  academic supervisors,  with at  least  50%  of \nteachers trained as women; (iv) outline of training program on academic supervision; (v) teacher \nmonitoring and mentoring guidelines; and (vi) technical inputs for a sample database of teaching \npractices at selected upazilas. \n \n7. \nOutput  3:  Piloting  of  web-based  integrated  EMIS  and  ICT  platform  for  teacher \ntraining.
