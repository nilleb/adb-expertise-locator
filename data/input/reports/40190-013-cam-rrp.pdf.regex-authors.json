THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, (ii) proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the ADB Strategic Climate Fund,1 \nand (iii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the ADB Strategic Climate Fund, \nall to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Flood and Drought \nRisk Management and Mitigation Project.2 \n \n2.  The regional project is designed to assist three Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) countries: \nCambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and Viet Nam. This report and \nrecommendation covers the project interventions and proposed financing for Cambodia. The \nreport and recommendation covering project interventions and financing for the Lao PDR and \nViet Nam was approved by the Board on 6 November 2012. The two-step processing approach \ndoes not compromise the overall integrity of the regional project in general and the regional \nactivities in particular. \n \n3.  The project will support the Government of Cambodia as it undertakes structural and \nnonstructural measures to prepare for and manage disaster risks linked to floods and droughts.3 \nProject interventions will (i) enhance the regional data, information, and knowledge base for the \nmanagement of floods and droughts; (ii) upgrade or develop water management infrastructure; \nand (iii) prepare communities to manage disasters such as floods and droughts, and adapt to \nclimate change. Improved drought management and irrigation water structures in Cambodia will \nbenefit farmers on about 16,000 hectares (ha) of agricultural lands, and at least 10,000 people \nwill benefit from improved flood management. 4 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale5 \n \n4.  The Mekong River stretches from the eastern watershed of the Xizang6 Plateau to the \nMekong Delta, flowing over 4,909 kilometers (km) through Cambodia, the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina,  the  Lao  PDR,  Myanmar,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam  with  a  total  basin  area  of \n795,000 square kilometers (km2).7 The Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) is home to about 60 million \npeople in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The Mekong River, while being one \nof the 20 largest rivers in the world, stands apart because of the large fluctuations in seasonal \ndischarge\u2014very low flows in the dry season yet extensive flooding in the wet season.8 River \n                                                 \n1  Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience financed by the Strategic Climate Fund. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  \u201cStructural measures refer to any physical construction to reduce or avoid possible impacts of hazards, which \ninclude engineering measures and construction of hazard-resistant and protective structures and infrastructure. \nNonstructural measures refer to policies, awareness, knowledge development, public commitment, and methods \nand operating practices, including participatory mechanisms and the provision of information, which can reduce risk \nand related impacts.\u201d Source: United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR). 2009. \nUNISDR  Terminology  on  Disaster  Risk  Reduction.

Climate change. The anticipated impacts of climate change and sea level rise in the \nMekong River Basin indicate that the water-related vulnerability will be exacerbated.9 Global and \nregional climate change scenario analyses indicate that in the LMB, temperatures as well as \nannual  rainfall  and  runoff  will  increase  and  sea  level  will  rise,  increasing  agriculture  and \neconomic losses in the Mekong Delta.10 Floods and droughts are projected to become more \nfrequent and intense. \n \n6.  Floods. Annual floods in the LMB are beneficial, nourishing the wetlands and sustaining \nfisheries and biodiversity.11 Extreme floods, however, cause losses and damage to livelihoods, \nagriculture,  and  infrastructure.  The  average  annual  direct  cost  of  flooding  to  agriculture, \ninfrastructure, and buildings in the LMB is $60 million\u2013$70 million, while the average annual \nvalue of flood benefit is estimated at $8 billion\u2013$10 billion (footnote 10). The challenge for flood \nrisk management is to reduce the costs and impacts of flooding while preserving its benefits. \n \n7.  Physical exposure to flood risks in the LMB is high and this is translated into economic \nexposure.12 Damage in monetary terms is higher in Viet Nam, signifying the level of exposure \nresulting from higher development (agriculture and infrastructure) than in Cambodia and the Lao \nPDR. In September 2009, typhoon Ketsana caused damage and losses estimated at $800 \nmillion in Viet Nam, $131 million in Cambodia, and $58 million in the Lao PDR.  \n \n8.  Droughts. Droughts, which occur as a result of periods of very low rainfall and river flow, \ncause disruption to the livelihoods of farmers and food supply chains.13 Droughts are considered \ndisasters because they significantly affect poor and vulnerable communities, particularly by \nincreasing  household  food  insecurity.14 Water  shortages,  particularly  during  critical  growth \nstages of crops, significantly reduce yields. Saline water intrusion in estuaries and coastal \nareas\u2014exacerbated by the low flows, particularly in the delta area of Viet Nam\u2014is another \ncause of concern that reduces food production. \n \n9.  The direct costs of drought in the LMB relate to the impact of agricultural droughts\u2014\nreduced yields or total loss of crops, especially rice, together with reduced livestock and fishery \nyields. The 2004\u20132005 drought was severe for all LMB countries, with losses estimated at  \n$42 million in the delta and localized food shortages. The extreme low flows in the Mekong \nRiver during March\u2013April 2010 harmed dry season crops along the Mekong River as pumping \nstations were not able to draw water.   \n                                                 \n9  United Nations Environment Programme. 2009.

Bangkok. \n13 Meteorological droughts, defined by low rainfall over the wet season (May\u2013November), reduce yields of rain-fed \nrice and other crops. The agricultural impacts of hydrological droughts are most severe during the dry season, \nwhen below-normal streamflows reduce irrigation and the yield of dry season crops. Hydrological droughts may \nalso occur during the wet season, for example, when below-normal streamflows reduce the volume and extent of \nflood waters stored in the Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia and the yield of its fishery.  \n14 Indirect costs that are difficult to assess include costs of perpetuating structural poverty, such as stunted growth in \nearly childhood, resulting in lifelong loss of productivity.  \n ", "     3 \n \n10.  Insufficient  disaster  preparedness.  Countries  in  the  LMB  have  varying  levels  of \ncapacity to prepare for and manage flood- and drought-related disasters. Actions are mostly \nreactive,  rather  than  proactive,  and  are  uncoordinated.  Better  flood  and  drought  disaster \npreparedness requires (i) knowledge availability and sharing of potential changes to the spatial \nand temporal distribution of climate and hydrological variables over the basin as a whole; \n(ii) capacity  for  timely  flood  and  drought  forecasting  and  dissemination  of  warnings  to \ncommunities  at  risk;  (iii)  engagement  of  at-risk  communities  in  the  identification,  analysis, \ntreatment,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  of  disaster  risks  to  reduce  their  vulnerabilities  and \nenhance their coping capacities; and (iv) improved condition of water control infrastructure. \n \n11.  Solutions and opportunities. Improving the disaster preparedness of countries and \ncommunities to manage and mitigate the potential impacts of extreme floods and droughts \nrequires structural and nonstructural initiatives. In terms of nonstructural measures, institutional \nand technical capacity building activities can strengthen regional information and knowledge \ngeneration and sharing with regard to water resources management in general and flood and \ndrought management in particular. Community-based disaster risk management (CBDRM) can \nequip communities, especially women, to access information on disaster risks and enhance \ntheir preparedness.15 Two-way channels for information sharing between local communities, \nriver  basin  management  systems,  national  early  warning  centers,  and  disaster  forecasting \ncenters are necessary. Structural measures include rehabilitation of flood control embankments, \nwater control structures, and irrigation and drainage structures. \n \n12.  Regional initiatives. The project is one of the flagship programs of the 2002 GMS \nEconomic Cooperation Program Strategic Framework and the 2008 Vientiane Plan of Action. At \nthe  regional  level,  the  Mekong  River  Commission  provides  a  framework  for  sustainable \ndevelopment of the LMB.16 The Mekong River Commission secretariat plays an important role in \nsupporting  national  agencies  and  nongovernment  organizations  with  technical  services  on \nregional and  transboundary issues. ADB and development partners are also supporting natural \nresource management and climate change adaptation through subregional initiatives including \nthe GMS Core Environment Program and its Biodiversity Conservation Initiative, and the GMS \nCore Agriculture Support Program.17  \n \n13.  Relevance  to  national  priorities. The project is aligned with the relevant policies, \nstrategies, and programs such as (i) the Lao PDR Disaster Management Action Frameworks, \n2003\u20132020; (ii) Viet Nam\u2019s National Strategy for Natural Disaster Prevention, Response and \nMitigation approved by the Prime Minister in 2007 (Decision No. 172/2007); National Targeted \nProgram to Respond to Climate Change; Strategic Direction of Water Resources Development \n(to 2020 and toward 2050), and the Mekong Delta Master Plan; and (iii) the Ministry of Water \nResources  and  Meteorology  of  Cambodia\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy  and  the  National  Water \nResources Policy for Cambodia.18 \n \n \n                                                 \n15 CBDRM is a process in which at-risk communities are actively engaged in the identification, analysis, treatment, \nand monitoring and evaluation of disaster risks in order to reduce their vulnerabilities and enhance their capacities. \nCBDRM seeks to strengthen community resilience to disaster-related shocks. \n16 The Mekong River Commission was formed on 5 April 1995 by an agreement between the governments of \nCambodia, the Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The Mekong River Commission secretariat is based in \nVientiane, Lao PDR. \n17 The GMS initiatives are supported by several development partners, such as the Government of Finland (Core \nEnvironment Program Biodiversity Corridors Initiative pilot and second phases) and the Government of Sweden \n(Implementing the Core Agriculture Support Program Phase 2). \n18 Approved by the Council of Ministers on 16 January 2004. \n ", "4   \n14.  ADB support. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020, \nwhich identifies flood and drought mitigation (as part of disaster risk management) as one of the \ntwo urgent challenges to be addressed in the integrated water resource management process.19 \nThe project is also aligned with the ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004) as \nit will support the governments and local communities in identifying and managing risks from \nnatural hazards. The project benefits from lessons from past ADB assistance on irrigation \ndevelopment and flood management in the region.20 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The impact will be reduced economic losses resulting from floods and droughts. The \noutcome will be improved capacity and preparedness to manage and mitigate the impacts of \nflood and drought events.21 \n \nC.  Outputs  \n \n16.  The project in Cambodia will have four key outputs. \n \n17.  Output  1:  Enhanced  regional  data,  information,  and  knowledge  base  for  the \nmanagement of floods and droughts. The project will support (i) the development of design \ncriteria for flood and drought risk mitigation schemes and water control infrastructure in the \nMekong Delta and elsewhere, (ii) the assessment of cross-border flood management options in \nViet Nam and Cambodia, and (iii) the strengthening of the National Flood Forecasting Center. \n \n18.  Output 2:  Upgraded  water management infrastructure. The Damnak Chheukrom \nirrigation system rehabilitation subproject for improved drought management and increased \nflood protection of Pursat town includes:22  \n(i)   an upstream controlled and supply-managed irrigation scheme to provide (a) wet \nseason supplementary irrigation for 16,100 ha of net command area in Pursat \nProvince, and (b) full irrigation to a smaller net command area during the dry \nseason;23  \n(ii)   a new headworks structure that will withdraw irrigation water from the Pursat \nRiver to the command area and facilitate peak flood diversion using the scheme\u2019s \nmain canal, comprising (a) a new barrage located on the Pursat River about \n40 km upstream of Pursat town that is designed to safely convey the 50-year \nflood under anticipated climate change conditions, and (b) an intake structure \nthat can control river withdrawals for both command and flood diversion flows;  \n(iii)   a 30 km main canal that will convey the peak flood diversion discharge of 40 \ncubic meters per second from the Pursat River to the Svay Donkeo River, which \ncomprises (a) rehabilitation of a 14 km reach of an existing nonfunctioning main \ncanal, and (b) further construction of 16 km of new main canal;  \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2011.

Manila (TA 4574-CAM). \n21 The proposed support to the Lao PDR and Viet Nam will have the same project impact and outcome. \n22 The proposed support to the Lao PDR and Viet Nam under this output includes two subprojects in the Lao PDR \n(Vientiane capital flood protection subproject and Vientiane capital irrigation development subproject) and four \nsubprojects in Viet Nam (upgrading the main canal system to drain and irrigate Plain of Reeds area, Thuong Thoi \nTien bank protection, control and mitigation of flood risk for the Ba Rai\u2013Phu An area, and upgrading the salinity \nintrusion system for the Go Cong area). \n23 Approximately 50% of the wet season net command area. \n ", "     5 \n(iv)   four new main canal cross-regulator structures to control flows and water levels \nin the main canal for diversion of command flows into the secondary canals, \nwhile allowing conveyance of the peak flood discharge of 40 cubic meters per \nsecond;  \n(v)   a new outlet structure near the Svay Donkeo River; and \n(vi)   four  new  secondary  canals  with  a  total  length  of  51.5  km,  including  check \nstructures and outlets to the tertiary system, new tertiary and distribution canals \nand new drainage systems, canal cross-drainage and overflow structures along \nthe main canal, and new road bridges along the main and secondary canals. \n \n19.  Output 3:  Enhanced capacity for community-based disaster risk management. \nCBDRM activities will be implemented to ensure that communities are able to obtain the full \nbenefit from upgraded water control infrastructure and improved flood warnings. Community-\ndriven flood and drought risk reduction measures will be implemented based on participatory \nlocal  flood  and  drought  risk  assessment  and  analysis,  and  disaster  risk  reduction  and \nmanagement  plans.24 Farmer  water  user  committees  will  receive  training  and  support  to \neffectively undertake their role as managers of the tertiary and distribution irrigation system; and \nthey will be supported in climate adaptation measures to diversify their crops and reduce crop \nirrigation requirements for dry and early wet season crops. \n \n20.  Output 4: Effective project implementation. The project will provide support to the \nexecuting agency and implementing agencies in the form of  improved office facilities, technical \nand office equipment, capacity development of the staff, and consulting services for detailed \ndesign and construction supervision and implementation support. \n   \n21.  Increased climate resilience. The outputs are designed to increase climate resilience \nin Cambodia in general and in the project area of Pursat Province in particular.25 As climate \nchange predictions indicate larger peak water flows, the design structural subproject has been \nimproved to ensure that the subproject is more climate resilient. Besides structural measures, \nclimate resilience will be increased through accompanying nonstructural measures. The ADB \nSCF grant will finance the costs of nonstructural measures to strengthen the capacity of the \ngovernment and affected communities to reduce the risks associated with climate extremes, i.e., \nfloods and droughts. The key measures are (i) setting up an effective early flood and drought \nwarning  system  by  providing  real-time  data  through  improved  communication  among  the \nDepartment of Meteorology, the Provincial Department of Water Resources and Meteorology \n(PDWRAM), the Provincial Committee for Disaster Management, and the farmer water user \ncommittees;  (ii) improving  hydraulic  design  standards  in  the  Mekong  Delta;  (iii) providing \ntechnical assistance to build community capacity to better manage and mitigate risks associated \nwith increasing climate extremes, including the use of early warning systems to augment coping \nstrategies  and  mechanisms  of  communities  and  promote  community-based  disaster  risk \nreduction and management; and (iv) promoting adaptation measures. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n22.  The project is estimated to cost $47.75 million (Table 1). \n \n   \n                                                 \n24 The proposed support to the Lao PDR and Viet Nam includes similar CBDRM activities. \n25 Increased Climate Resilience (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6   \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.29 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements\nImplementation period  March 2013\u2013March 2019 (6 years) \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Project steering committee  \nMinister of Water Resources and Meteorology (chair) \nRepresentatives of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, General Directorate \nof the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, General Directorate of \nTechnical Affairs, Ministry of Environment, National Committee for Disaster \nManagement, Cambodia National Mekong Committee, Governor of Pursat \nProvince (members) \n(ii)   Executing agency  Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies   Provincial Department of Water Resources and Meteorology of Pursat province; \nDepartment of Hydrology and River Works \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Central project management unit (19 staff) and two project implementation units \n(13 staff) in Phnom Penh and Pursat. \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  multiple contracts   $25.7 million \nNational competitive bidding  multiple contracts   $4.74 million \nShopping  multiple contracts  $0.05 million \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  173 person-months  $2.19 million \n(80:20) \nQuality-based selection     $3.72 million \nConsultants\u2019 qualifications selection     $0.66 million \nAdvance contracting  Recruitment of the project implementation consultants. \nDisbursement  The ADB loan and SCF loan and SCF grant proceeds will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from \ntime to time) and detailed arrangements agreed upon by the government and \nADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, SCF = Strategic Climate Fund. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n   \n                                                 \n29  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n29.  The structural subproject involves the rehabilitation and upgrading of the existing water \ncontrol infrastructure and construction of new structures such as the headworks structure. The \nPDWRAM has the capacity to supervise and coordinate the construction of such infrastructure. \nThe design capacities of flood control gates, drainage pumps, and irrigation canals are based \non  international  norms,  hydrological  and  hydraulic  analyses,  and  hydrographic  and \ntopographical surveys of the project area, and are suited to local conditions. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n30.  Economic benefits have been quantified from incremental agricultural output and from \nreduced flood damage to commercial activities and public infrastructure, as well as reduced \nneed for relocation of families around Pursat township.30 The economic analysis compares the \nidentified net incremental benefits attributed to the investment with the costs for developing the \nirrigation system. The economic internal rate of return for the subproject is 12.1%.31 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n31.  All procurement to be financed by the ADB loan and the ADB SCF loan and grant will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). Project implementation, procurement, and financial management will be aligned with the \ngovernments\u2019 standard operating procedures. MOWRAM has given assurance that all accounts \nadministered by the CPMU and PIUs will be consolidated and audited annually by auditors \nacceptable  to  ADB.  A  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the  existing \norganizational structures of executing and implementing agencies are generally suitable for the \nimplementation of the project and fund flow arrangements are clear. There are shortfalls such \nas the lack of experience with ADB project management; however, this will be addressed \nthrough  training.  The  project  will  strengthen  the  capacities  of  the  CPMU  and  PIU  staff  in \nfinancial management procedures to allow the efficient operation of advance accounts and the \nreporting of financial performance to the government and ADB. The project will establish or use \nexisting ministerial websites to (i) disclose implementation progress and bid notifications and \ntheir results, and (ii) provide a grievance mechanism against any corrupt practice.  \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the project administration manual (footnote 29). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n33.  Benefits. The mitigation and improved management of the risks related to floods and \ndroughts will enable communities to benefit substantially from (i) avoiding loss of property and \nreducing casualties, (ii) increasing agricultural productivity and incomes through the improved \n                                                 \n30 This has been estimated based on data provided by the National Committee for Disaster Management based on \nthe 2000 and 2011 floods and extrapolating the extent of damage to higher and lower frequency return periods of \nflood. \n31 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "     9 \nmanagement and availability of water, and (iii) reducing economic losses from disruption of \nlivelihoods. 32  \n \n34.  Gender impact (effective gender mainstreaming). The key gender impacts of the \nproject include increased women's engagement in (i) management of data and information on \nfloods  and  droughts,  (ii)  local  disaster  risk  management  activities,  and  (iii)  employment \ngenerated  through  civil  works  and  other  project-related  activities.  The  gender  action  plan \ncontains gender design features to ensure that (i) at least 40% of trainees will be women in all \ntraining on disaster risk assessment and analysis, prioritization, and implementation of locally \nappropriate  risk  management  measures;  (ii)  at  least  40%  of  participants  in  all  public \nconsultations for the development of safer village and commune plans will be women; (iii) at \nleast 30% of community facilitators of the public consultation will be women; (iv) at least 30% of \nthe implementers of the CBDRM measures will be women; (v) at least 30% of commune \nCBDRM coordination committee members will be women; (vi) contractors prioritize the use of \nlocal unskilled labor for civil works, at least 30% of unskilled laborers will be women, and equal \npay for equal work is adhered to; (vii) at least 30% of project staff will be women; and (viii) \ngender-related performance indicators are included in the project monitoring and evaluation \nframework.33 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n35.  Environment  (category  B).  The  government  will  ensure  that  the  subproject  is \nimplemented in strict conformity with relevant laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009), and all measures and requirements set forth in the initial environmental \nexamination and environmental management plan that have been prepared and endorsed by \nthe government. The initial environmental examination will be posted on ADB\u2019s website upon \nBoard  approval  of  the  project.34 All  identified  adverse  impacts  resulting  from  the  location, \ndesign, construction, and operation of the water management infrastructure are expected to be \nsmall to moderate and can be mitigated. Further updating of the environmental management \nplan will be undertaken before the commencement of site-specific construction activities. \n \n36.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). About 792 households (3,960 people) will be \naffected, including about 384 households (1,920 people) severely affected by potentially losing \nmore  than  10%  of  their  productive  land  and/or  productive  assets.  The  total  land  take  is \nestimated  at  277.51  ha.  A  resettlement  plan  has  been  endorsed  by  the  government  and \ndisclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website.35 Resettlement  planning  and  implementation  are  designed  to \nensure that the affected persons will be no worse off as a result of the project. The government \nhas shown a commitment to managing social risks, but institutional capacity building is still \nnecessary and is included in the project. \n \n37.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No indigenous people maintaining distinct cultural \nidentities or separate cultural traditions were found to reside in the project area.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n \n38.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.36  \n                                                 \n32 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n34 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nFrequency and severity of flood and  Designs will be robust, and will include adaptation for predicted \ndrought events exceed capacity of  climate change impacts and quality control to reduce \ninfrastructure due to climate change  vulnerability of infrastructure. \nInsufficient government interagency  Project implementation consultants will raise awareness on the \ncoordination leads to incohesive  links between the structural and nonstructural measures. \nimplementation of structural and  Studies on hydraulic design standards will demonstrate these \nnonstructural measures.  links and can be used to advocate for better coordination. \nRegional coordination of disaster risk  The National Flood Forecasting Center will adopt Mekong River \nmanagement is inadequate.
