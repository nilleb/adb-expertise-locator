The environmental implications were reviewed and no \nsignificant adverse impacts were identified.  \n \nADB\u2019s CSP identifies power sector restructuring as one of the main \ninterventions for directly impacting the most important development \nconstraints,  such  as  the  fiscal  imbalance  and  poor  investment \nclimate. The restructuring has reached an important juncture. The \nlegal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  for  privatization  and \ncompetition  is  largely  in  place.  However,  for  the  restructuring  to \nsucceed,  the  sector\u2019s  financial  viability  has  to  be  restored, \nregulatory  performance  improved,  and  the  confidence  of  private \nsector investors enhanced. The Government needs ADB\u2019s support \nin all these areas to consolidate the restructuring process.  \n \nBased on lessons from previous operations, a cluster approach is \nadopted for the Power Sector Development Program (PSDP). The \ntwo  subprograms  that  form  the  Program  cluster  have  2-year  time \nhorizons,  one  covering  2007\u20132008  and  the  other  (tentatively) \ncovering  2009\u20132010.  Target  dates are  set  only  for  subprogram  1. \nSubprogram  1\u2019s  accomplishments  will  be \nit \napproaches  completion,  and \nthe  scope  and  schedule  of \nsubprogram  2  will  be  defined  as  necessary.  This  will  provide \nflexibility  in  subprogram  2  design,  as  adjustments  can  be  made \nbased on the results of subprogram 1 and changes in the external \nenvironment. \n \n \nThe primary objective of the Program cluster loan is to help restore \nthe financial viability of the power sector, and specifically to support \nthe  Government\u2019s  absorption  of  NPC\u2019s  long-term  liabilities.  For \nsubprogram  1  of  the  PSDP,  the  objectives  are  to  (i)  provide \nfinancial  assistance, \nthe \nthrough  a  program \nGovernment meet part of the power sector restructuring costs; (ii) \nestablish  the  necessary  conditions  for  substantial  progress  in  the \nprivatization program under subprogram 2; (iii) improve confidence \nin  regulatory  performance;  and  (iv)  ensure  a  smooth  transition  to \ncompetitive electricity markets. \n  \nThe  Government  requires  about  $9.2  billion  in  financing  for  the \nloan  under \npower  sector  during  2006\u20132010.  The  program \n\nreviewed  as \n\nto  help \n\nloan, \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\nsubprogram 1 of the PSDP will cover $450 million of that amount.  \n \n\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \n\nProgram Period and \nProgram Cluster \n\nExecuting Agency and \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nLoan Amount and Terms  To  finance  subprogram  1,  a  loan  of  $450  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London \nInter-bank Offered Rate-based lending facility. The loan will have a \n15  year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate \ndetermined \nlending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \nThe  program  cluster  period  is  tentatively  4  years  from  2007  to \n2010,  with  a  single  tranche  of  $450  million  to  be  disbursed  under \nsubprogram  1.  The  scope  and  amount  of  subprogram  2  will  be \ndetermined after the Government fulfills relevant policy conditions. \n \nThe Department of Finance (DOF) is the Executing Agency for the \nprogram  loan,  while  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  is  the \nImplementing  Agency.  DOF  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall \nimplementation of the Program, including (i) compliance with policy \nactions,  (ii)  program  administration,  (iii)  disbursements,  and  (iv) \nmaintenance of program records. An Energy Executive Committee \nwill  be  formed  to  take  charge  of  PSDP\u2019s  implementation.  The \ncommittee, comprising of officials and executives of DOE, National \nElectrification Administration, National Power Corporation, National \nElectricity  Market \nTransmission  Corporation, \nCorporation,  Philippine  National  Oil  Company,  and  Power  Sector \nAssets  and  Liabilities  Management  Corporation  will  meet  at  least \nonce  a  month  and  monitor  the  program  implementation  progress. \nDOE  will  be  responsible  for  the  monitoring  of  the  program \nimplementation activities, and reporting implementation progress. \n \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and \nprocured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and \nimports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The \ndisbursement  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans. \n \nThe  period  for  subprogram  1  will  be  2007\u20132008,  while  the  period \nfor subprogram 2 is tentatively 2009\u20132010. \n \nPower sector restructuring will have a significant positive impact in \nthe  sector,  as  well  as  in  the  economy.  With  the  large-scale \nprivatization and introduction of a competitive electricity market, the \nGovernment\u2019s  role  in  the  power  sector  will  be  curtailed.  The \nGovernment  will  become  a  policy  maker  and  planner;  and  its \nunsustainable  subsidies  to  the  power  sector  will  be  reduced  to \nlevels  needed  for  electrification  in  unviable  rural  areas.  Thus,  a \nmajor  fiscal  crisis  will  be  averted,  and  financial  resources  will  be \nfreed  up  for  social  services  and  infrastructure.  Restoring  financial \n\nProcurement, and \nDisbursement \n\nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n\nPhilippine \n\n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nviability of the power sector is vital to fiscal consolidation, and will \nbe important in attracting new investments in the power sector. \n \n\nRisks and Assumptions  While the Government remains committed to power sector reform, \nthe  delays  in  the  privatization  program  have  cast  doubt  on  the \nrelevance  of  the  ongoing  power  sector  restructuring.  A  policy \nreversal to return to the previous, vertically integrated Government-\nowned  monopoly  is  a  major  political  risk.  This  would  exacerbate \nthe  financial  difficulties  of  the  power  sector  and  discourage  the \nprivate  participation  that  is  needed  to  ensure  the  long-term \nsustainability  of  the  sector.  The  PSDP  will  provide  essential \nsupport to the Government to ensure that the reform program is on \ntrack.  Private  investors  have  perceived  ADB\u2019s  continued  support \nfor power sector reforms as an important factor for the successful \ncompletion  of  the  reforms.  The  proposed  PSDP,  therefore,  will \ncontribute  to  building  much-needed  confidence  among  private \nthe  power  sector \nsector \nrestructuring process. \n\ninvestors  at  a  critical \n\njuncture  of \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nprogram  loan  under  the  Program  cluster  concept  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the \nPower Sector Development Program (PSDP). The program design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. The policy matrix is in Appendix 2.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\n2. \nThe  macroeconomic  management  priority  of  the  Government  of  the  Philippines  (the \nGovernment)  is  to  maintain  momentum  on  fiscal  consolidation.  This  will  leave  more  budget \nresources  for  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Also,  progress  on  deficit  reduction  has \nemerged as the proxy for financial markets and investors to gauge Government\u2019s commitment, \ncapacity, and credibility to deliver on its broader agenda. In July 2005, the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  Board  endorsed  the  Philippine  country  strategy  and  program  2005\u20132007  (CSP),1 \nwhich  proposes  significant  levels  of  policy-based  support.  However,  for  the  Government  to \nreceive that assistance, (i) the budget deficit reduction program must be on track, and (ii) sector-\nspecific  reform  agendas  must  be  in  place.  These  conditions  have  been  met  sufficiently.  This \nsection  concludes  that  the  macroeconomic  progress  is  on  track,  allowing  ADB\u2019s  policy-based \nsupport to proceed.  \n \n3. \nThe erosion of tax collection ratio from 17% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997 to \n12.3% in 2004, when the decline was arrested, was the primary cause of the rapid increase in \nthe  Government  budget  deficit  from  0.1%  of  GDP  in  1997  to  its  peak  of  5.3%  in  2002. \nMeanwhile,  escalating  losses  of  nonfinancial  Government-owned  and  -controlled  corporations \n(GOCC) during 1999\u20132004\u2014especially in the power sector\u2014increased the consolidated public \nsector deficit as a percentage of GDP.2 Figure 1 summarizes the history of these three trends. \nWeak  tax  collection  meant  public  development  expenditure  was  financed  increasingly  from \nborrowings. This increased significantly the Government\u2019s debt stock as a percentage of GDP, \nconsequently almost doubling interest expenses from 16.6% of the budget in 1997 to 31.8% in \n2005 (Figure 2). The increase in mandatory interest expenses reduced discretionary spending. \nCapital outlays as a proportion of budget spending almost halved during 1997\u20132005 (Figure 2), \nwhile  expenditure  on  social  sectors  similarly  fell.  The  Government\u2019s  access  to  official \ndevelopment assistance for investment projects was constrained due to the lack of budget cover \nand  counterpart  funding.  Hence,  relatively  expensive  financing  was  sourced  from  international \ncapital markets, feeding back into high debt service commitments. This \u201cvicious circle\u201d needs to \nbe broken to allow public spending for economic growth and poverty reduction.   \n \n4. \nThe  Government\u2019s  fiscal  consolidation  program  includes  a  wide  range  of  initiatives. \nHowever,  given  the  serious  impact  of  undercollection  of  revenues  on  economic  growth  and \npublic service delivery, the primary focus has been on broadening the tax base, increasing tax \nrates,  and  strengthening  tax  administration.  With  a  view  to  front-loading  initiatives  to  increase \ntax collection, excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco were adjusted from January 2005. Further, \nthe  coverage  of  the  value-added  tax  was  expanded  from  November  2005,  and  the  rate  was \nincreased from 10% to 12% from February 2006.3 \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

To  this  end,  tax  administration  has  been  strengthened  by  the  passage  of  the \nLateral  Attrition  Law  (2005), 4  which  provides  for  performance-based  sanctions  (including \nretraining,  redeployment,  and  removal)  for  employees  of  revenue-collecting  agencies  who  fall \nshort of revenue targets, and rewards for those who exceed them. Further, focused programs \nhave  strengthened  tax  compliance  and  enhanced  governance  of  the  tax  system,  including  (i) \nBureau  of  Custom\u2019s  Run  After  the  Smugglers  program,  (ii)  Bureau  of  Internal  Revenue\u2019s  Run \nAfter Tax Evaders program, and (iii) Department of Finance\u2019s lifestyle checks on officials under \nits  Revenue  Integrity  Protection  System.  These  programs  are  highly  publicized,  target  well-\nknown  personalities,  and  emphasize  the  increased  risk  to  officials  of  tax  evasion  and  corrupt \npractices.  \n \n6. \nIn  2005,  a  reduction  in  the  aggregate  deficit  of  GOCCs  complemented  these  revenue \ninitiatives, reversing a worsening trend since 1999. The most significant contribution was from \nincreases  in  wholesale  electricity  prices,5 which  allowed  National  Power  Corporation  (NPC)\u2014\nthe largest contributor to the consolidated deficit\u2014to break even in 2005. NPC\u2019s financial loss \nfell  from  2%  of  GDP  in  2004  to  almost  zero  in  2005,  assisted  by  improved  NPC  operational \nefficiency, Government debt absorption, and appreciation of the peso. Further improvement in \naggregate  GOCC  financial  performance  is  expected  from  implementing  Executive  Order  No. \n366  (October  2004),  which  requires  Government  departments,  agencies,  and  corporations  to \ncomplete  strategic  reviews  to  rationalize  their  functions  and  staffing.  Performance-based \nbudgeting  also  is  being  introduced.6 For  local  governments,  the  focus  is  on  (i)  strengthening \npublic  resource  management;  (ii)  improving  the  cost-effectiveness  of  service  delivery;  and  (iii) \n\n                                                 \n4  The  implementing  rules  and  regulations  of  the  law  were  released  on  30  May  2006,  which  will  allow  the \n\nperformance-based provisions to be implemented from January 2007.  \n\n5  Depoliticizing tariff adjustments has been a major achievement, aided by strengthening the technical capacity and \nautonomy  of  the  Energy  Regulatory  Commission,  with  ADB  assistance:  ADB.  2004.

Tax revenue increased by 15% in 2005, compared with \naverage annual growth of about 6.8% during 2000\u20132004. For the first time since 1997, the tax \nrevenue  increased  from  12.3%  of  GDP  in  2004  to  12.6%  in  2005,  while  the  Government\u2019s \nbudget deficit declined from 3.8% of GDP in 2004 to 2.7% in 2005\u2014the third successive annual \nimprovement. The Government debt stock, meanwhile, fell from 79% of GDP in 2004 to 72% in \n2005.  The  outcomes  encouraged,  and  benefited  from,  more  favorable  market  sentiment  in \n2005:  (i)  foreign  direct  investment  almost  tripled  (albeit  from  a  low  base),  (ii)  two  of  the  three \nmajor  credit  rating  agencies  upgraded  their  outlooks  from  negative  to  stable,  (iii)  sovereign \nborrowing costs fell,8 and (iv) the peso appreciated against the dollar beginning in the early part \nof  the  year.  These  translated  into  significant  debt  service  savings,  which  was  an  important \ncontributor  to  the  emergence  a  \u201cvirtuous  circle\u201d  in  2005.  Staying  the  course  of  reforms \ngenerated  improved  market  sentiment,  which  in  turn  generated  more  favorable  conditions  for \nachieving macroeconomic targets. \n \n8. \nIn  March  2006,  development  partners  characterized  the  progress  on  aggregate  fiscal \nconsolidation  as  \u201cimpressive\u201d  during  the  Philippine  Development  Forum  (PDF),  which  also \nassessed the program as broadly on track.9 The emerging trend is better than projected in the \nGovernment\u2019s  Medium  Term  Philippine  Development  Plan  2004\u20132010, 10 and  the  target  for \nachieving  a  balanced  budget  has  been  advanced  from  2010  to  2008.    While  this  target  is \nambitious,  development  partners  consider  it  achievable.  For  2006,  the  enhanced  value-added \ntax revenues are expected to total the equivalent of 1.2% of GDP, while the overall tax effort is \nexpected to improve by 1.9 percentage points, from 12.7% of GDP in 2005 to 14.6% in 2006. \nThe  Government\u2019s  budget  deficit  is  expected  to  decline  1.7  percentage  points  from  2004  to \n2.1% of GDP, while the consolidated public sector deficit is expected to decline 2.7 percentage \npoints to 2.1% of GDP.   \n \n9. \nRisks  associated  with  this  scenario  relate  partly  to  the  magnitude,  intensity,  and \nconsistency  of  effort  needed  to  secure  recent  gains.  For  example,  the  tax  revenue  target  for \n2010 of 17% of GDP\u2014the same level as in 1997\u2014requires an average annual increase of 0.8 \npercentage points. The PDF characterized 2005 as \u201cthe year of tax legislation\u201d and 2006 as \u201cthe \nyear  of  tax  implementation\u201d,  underscoring  the  Government\u2019s  need  to  secure  recent  gains  to \nachieve  its  2010  goal.  Another  consideration  is  the  composition  and  quality  of  fiscal \nconsolidation.  The  2  point  reduction  in  the  deficit  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  during  2003\u20132005 \ncomprised  1.4  percentage  points  from  expenditure  reduction  and  only  0.6  percentage  points \nfrom  increased  revenue.  The  PDF  cautioned  against  disproportionate  reliance  on  expenditure \ncuts  rather  than  higher  revenue  collections  and  pointed  out  that  a  lower  budget  deficit  is  not \ninconsistent  with  higher  spending  on  public  infrastructure,  health,  and  education.  The \ncomprehensive  approach  to  fiscal  consolidation,  which  includes  revenue  enhancement, \nimproved  public  expenditure  management,  and  more  efficient  service  delivery,  supports  this \nview. The failure of the executive and legislative branches of Government to agree on the year\u2019s \n\n                                                 \n7  This is supported under several ADB TA grants, including (i) ADB. 2005 Technical Assistance to the Philippines for \nDebt  and  Risk  Management.  Manila  (TA  4717-PHI,  approved  7  December  2005,  for  $720,000);  and  ADB.  2006. \nTechnical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for Local Governance and Fiscal Management. Manila (TA \n4778-PHI, approved 3 April, for $1.8 million).  \n\n8  For example, sovereign borrowing from the international market in January 2006 was secured at 333 basis points \n\nover US Treasury bonds compared with about 505 basis points a year earlier.   \n\n9  ADB. 2006. 2006 Philippines Development Forum.

Thus, \nachieving  the  2006  deficit  target  will  be  less  onerous  under  the  lower  spending  of  last  year\u2019s \nbudget, with the possibility of less pressure to improve the tax effort.  \n \nThe  CSP  sets  fiscal  triggers  for  policy-based  lending.  During  2005\u20132007,  the  primary \n10. \ntrigger  is  a  reduction  in  the  projected  Government  deficit  of  0.7  percentage  points  in  terms  of \nGDP  (CSP,  Results  Framework,  Appendix  8)  relative  to  the  2004  baseline.  Further,  the  CSP \nrequires  that  \u201cactions  to  achieve  the  expected  reduction  in  the  deficit/GDP  ratio  will  precede \nADB lending operations, rather than actual results of the actions\u201d (footnote 1).  Importantly, the \nCSP  notes  that,  during  the  period  of  fiscal consolidation,  ADB  will  provide  program  support  to \nassist  implementation  of  budgetary,  power,  and  related  reforms\u2014as  long  as  the  transition \nremains on track. Thus, a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d of reform progress and new support will be created: \nprogress  elicits  new  lending,  and  new  lending  strengthens  reforms.  For  the  transition  to \noperations  beyond  the  CSP  period,  the  trigger  is  an  actual  reduction  in  Government  deficit  of \n1.5  percentage  points  in  terms  of GDP,  supplemented  by  the stabilization  of  the power  sector \ndeficit  at  a  substantially  reduced  level  (CSP,  para.  55).  Table  1  shows  how  the  budget  deficit \ntrigger for policy-based lending has been met.  \n \n\n \n\nTable 1: CSP\u2019s Budget Deficit Trigger for Policy-Based Lending \n\n \n\n2005 (actual) \nP bn  % GDP \n\n2004 (baseline) \nP bn  % GDP \n\n2007 (projected) \n \n% GDP \nP bn \nItem \n0.9 \n63 \n146 \nGovernment Deficit  \n3.0 \n \n \n   % point reduction \n \n \n \n \n0.6 \n41 \n145 \nCPSD \n4.3 \n \n \n   % point reduction \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMemo Item: \n15.0 \n \n \n   Tax \nbn = billion, CPSD = consolidated public sector deficit, CSP = country strategy and program, GDP = gross \ndomestic product, P = peso. \nSource: Department of Finance. \n\n2006 (projected) \n% GDP \nP bn \n2.1 \n125 \n1.7 \n \n \n \n2.1 \n125 \n2.7 \n \n \n \n \n \n14.5 \n \n\n2.7 \n1.1 \n \n1.9 \n2.9 \n \n \n12.6 \n\n3.8 \n \n \n4.8 \n \n \n \n12.3 \n\n187 \n \n \n232 \n \n \n \n \n\n \nThe  second  CSP  fiscal  trigger  (CSP,  Appendix  8)  complements  the  first,  aggregate \n11. \ntrigger.

The  restructuring  followed  the  promulgation  of  the  implementing  rules  and \nregulations  for  the  Electric  Power  Industry  Reform  Act  2001  (EPIRA),  which  the  Congress \npassed in June 2001. Prior to the restructuring, NPC and several independent power producers \n(IPP)  shared  electricity  generating  functions  in  the  country.  Privately  owned  Manila  Electric \nCompany  (Meralco),  16  privately  owned  utilities,  7  municipal  systems,  and  119  rural  electric \ncooperatives  carried  out  electricity  distribution.  Thirty-five  IPPs  (about  8,000  megawatt  [MW]) \nhave  contracts  with  NPC  for  the  sale  of  electricity,  while  three  others  (about  2,000  MW)  have \nthem  with  Meralco.  NPC  also  owns  and  operates  about  4,500  MW  of  grid-connected  power \ngenerating plants. \n \n14.  Many of the IPPs entered the power sector as part of a Government-supported solution \nto the power crisis that the Philippines experienced in the early 1990s. Severe power shortages \nbrought  about  by  power  generating  capacity  deficits  constrained  the  economy.  However,  the \nearly IPP contracts, mostly with NPC in 1993 and 1994, included high cost premiums due to the \nperceived investor risks. As such, they undermined NPC\u2019s financial position. NPC\u2019s debt service \nburden also increased due to the lack of Government equity inputs for NPC\u2019s capital expansion \nprograms,  as  well  as  the  depreciation  of  the  peso  against  the  foreign  currencies  in  NPC\u2019s \nheavily  foreign-denominated  debt  portfolio.  NPC\u2019s  financial  position  worsened  when  the  Asian \nfinancial  crisis  suppressed  economic  growth  and  reduced  electricity  demand  in  1997\u20131998, \nleading to a significant surplus of power generating capacity, especially in Luzon. Consequently, \nIPP  power  generating  commitments  that  were  protected  by  long  term  take-or-pay  contracts12 \n                                                 \n11   PSALM has been created to own and manage the assets and liabilities of National Power Corporation (NPC) and   \n\nNational Transmission Corporation (TransCo), para. 18. \n\n12     Contract  between  NPC  and  IPPs,  whereby  the  former  agrees  to  purchase  from  the  latter  a  fixed  quantity  of \nelectricity for a given price with Government guarantee. Irrespective of the quantity which is finally needed and  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nwere under-utilized. Thus, NPC\u2019s return on rate base (RORB) and debt service coverage ratio \n(DSCR) in 1997 fell below 8% and 1.0, respectively. \n \n\n2. \n\nPower Sector Restructuring \n\n15. \nADB\u2019s  involvement  with  power  sector  restructuring  in  the  Philippines  began  in  early \n1994,  when  policy  dialogue  intensified  with  NPC,  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE),  and  the \nDepartment  of  Finance  (DOF).  Those  discussions  focused  on  NPC's  deteriorating  financial \nperformance,  and  consequent  inability  to  fund  necessary  power  generation  and  transmission \nprojects.  After  the  participants  agreed  that  a  radical  change  was  needed,  NPC  provided  ADB \nwith  its  in-house  report  entitled  NPC  Privatization  and  Restructuring  Study  for  comment. \nExtensive and lengthy  policy dialogue followed with ADB  and the sector\u2019s other major funding \nagencies,  which  also  considered  NPC\u2019s  added  financial  burden  due  to  the  power  generation \novercapacity that was emerging as a consequence of the Asian financial crisis. The dialogue led \nto a consensus on initiating a competitive market for electricity in the Philippines. \n \nThe objectives of the Government initiated power sector restructuring program include (i) \n16. \ncreation  of  an  enabling  legal  and  regulatory  environment  to  support  competitive  markets  in \nelectricity; (ii) restoration of the financial viability of NPC before the introduction of competitive \nmarkets; (iii) unbundling and corporatization of NPC's operations to facilitate the introduction of \ncompetitive  markets  in  electricity;  (iv)  establishment  of  the  open-access  transmission  system \nneeded  to  support  a  competitive  wholesale  market  for  electricity;  (v)  establishment  of  open-\naccess  distribution  systems  to  support  competitive  markets  in  electricity  retailing;  (vi) \nimprovement of the operational efficiency of the distribution subsector to enable it to participate \nin competitive markets; (vii) promotion of energy conservation and demand-side management to \nsupplement efficiency gains from competitive markets; (viii) mitigation of the social impact of the \ntransition  to  competitive  markets;  and  (ix)  ensuring  environmentally  sustainable  power \ngeneration.  These  measures  were  expected  to  achieve  greater  operational  and  economic \nefficiency,  enhance  the  inflow  of  private  capital,  broaden  the  ownership  base  of  the  power \nsector, and minimize the Government's financial and risk exposure.  \n \n17. \nTo  support  the  Government\u2019s  power  sector  restructuring  program,  ADB  approved  the \nPower  Sector  Restructuring  Program  (PSRP),  for  $300 million,  on  16  December  1998. 13 In \nDecember  2002,  ADB  supplemented  this  loan with  a  partial  credit  guarantee  (PCG)  to  help in \nfinancing additional adjustment costs associated with the restructuring.14  The principal objective \nof the PSRP was to restore NPC\u2019s financial viability and create competitive electricity markets \nby  unbundling  generation  and  transmission,  and  providing  open  and  equal  access  to \ntransmission  and  distribution.  The  blueprint  to  achieve  these  objectives  is  EPIRA,  which \nprovides  the  legal  framework  for  power  sector  restructuring  and  the  privatization  of  NPC.  The \nimplementing rules and regulations of EPIRA were promulgated in February 2002. A description \nof the power sector institutions and the sector road map is in Appendix 3. The Supplementary \nAppendix provides an extensive and detailed analysis of the energy sector. \n \n18. \n\nThe power sector restructuring has achieved the following thus far: \n\n                                                 \n\ntransferred,  NPC  is  bound  by  its  commitments  and  is  required  to  pay  for  the  whole  volume  of  sales  at  the \ncontractual terms agreed upon. \n\n13  ADB. 1998.

Further,  the \nPSRP  achieved  the  unbundling  of  the  power  generation  and  transmission  functions,  with  the \nprovision of open access in the transmission and distribution systems required for the working of \na  competitive  market.  The  successful  start  of  the  WESM  on  26  June  2006,  and  its  smooth \noperation as a viable platform for electricity trading, is another measure of success of the PSRP. \nHowever, the restoration of financial viability in the power sector, the substantial privatization of \nNPC\u2019s  power  generation  assets,  and  the  selection  of  a  transmission  system  concessionaire \nwere not achieved to a significant extent. The capability of the power system to meet expected \ndemand for electricity in the medium term is another area of concern.  \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Options \n\n1. \n\nPSALM\u2019s Financial Situation  \n\n20. \nThe  Government\u2019s  decision  to  contract  IPPs  as  a  response  to  the  power  crisis  of  the \n1990s  (para.  14),  and  the  Asian  financial  crisis  after  1997,  resulted  in  NPC  incurring  huge \nliabilities.  The  long-standing  liquidity  problem  of  NPC  is  mainly  attributable  to  its  under-\ncapitalization  and  inadequate  tariff  adjustments.  As  a  result  of  its  excessive  debt  and  foreign \nexchange exposure,  compounded by its high exposure to market and fuel price risk, NPC has \nincurred  financial  losses  since  1998.  The  failure  to  effectively  address  these  problems  has \nharmed the economy and created a large financial burden on the Government.  \n \n\n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2005. Report on the Transfer of Liabilities and Generation Assets from the National Power Corporation to the \nPower  Sector  Assets  and  Liabilities  Management  Corporation  and  Transfer  of  Transmission  Assets  from  the \nNational  Power  Corporation  to  the  National  Transmission  Corporation  in  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines.  Manila \n(approved on 19 July).  \n\n16 The captive market refers to electricity consumers who do not have the choice of a supplier of electricity. \n17 Inter-grid cross subsidy refers to a subsidy by Luzon grid to Visayas and Mindanao grids; intra-grid cross subsidy \nrefers to a subsidy by Meralco to other distribution utilities within Luzon grid; inter-class subsidy refers to a subsidy \nby industrial consumers to residential consumers.  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nAs shown in Table 4, the financial position of PSALM (consolidated NPC and TransCo) \n21. \ndeteriorated significantly from 2002 to 2003. During this period, PSALM\u2019s IPP lease obligations \nincreased by 20% due to the commissioning of the San Roque hydropower and the Kalayaan 2 \nplants,  both  of  which  were  committed  for  construction  during  the  late  1990s.  The  failure  to \nincrease generation rates in 2002 to cover IPP liabilities from existing facilities, as well as those \nof the San Roque and and Kalayaan 2 plants, exacerbated PSALM\u2019s financial problems. By the \nend  of  2003,  PSALM\u2019s  assets  were  less  than  its  accumulated  liabilities,  implying  that  the \ncorporation  was  technically  bankrupt.  In  the  absence  of  a  Government  equity  infusion  or \nsubsidy, PSALM relied on commercial borrowings to refinance its maturing obligations. In 2004 \nand  2005,  PSALM  borrowed  almost  $2.2  billion  from,  among  others,  the  international  bond \nmarkets.  \n \n\nTable 4: PSALM\u2019s (NPC and TransCo) Financial Performance 1998\u20132005 \n(P billion) \n \nResult of Operations \n2001 \n115.70 \n108.90 \n6.80 \n15.10 \n(2.10) \n(10.40) \n\n2003 \n119.20 \n124.50 \n(5.30) \n24.90 \n(86.80)c \n(117.00) \n\n2000 \n100.10 \n94.70 \n5.40 \n15.10 \n(3.30) \n(13.00) \n\n2002 \n116.40 \n115.90 \n0.50 \n17.90 \n(16.30) \n(33.70) \n\n2004 \n167.30 \n145.10 \n22.10 \n30.20 \n(21.80) \n(29.90) \n\n1999 \n89.70 \n81.20 \n8.50 \n13.00 \n(1.50) \n(6.00) \n\n86.60 \n79.70 \n6.90 \n11.00 \n0.50 \n(3.60) \n\n1998 \n\nItem \nNet Operating Revenues \nOperating Expenses \nOperating Income \nInterest Expense \nOther Income (Expense) \nNet Income (Loss) \n \n\n2005 \n165.40 \n143.60 \n21.90 \n19.60 \n83.60e \n86.00 \n\nItem \nUtility Plantsa \nPlants Under \nCapital Lease \nLease \nOther Assets \nTotal Assets \nLong-Term Debtb \nIPP Lease \nObligationsd \nOther Liabilities \nand Credits \nTotal Liabilities \nand Deferred \nCredits \n\n1998 \n287.10 \n \n166.30 \n \n192.70 \n646.10 \n214.00 \n \n230.50 \n \n72.50 \n \n \n517.00 \n \n129.10 \n\n1999 \n277.60 \n \n350.90 \n \n233.90 \n862.40 \n238.80 \n \n406.20 \n \n92.00 \n \n \n737.00 \n \n125.40 \n\nFinancial Condition \n2001 \n2000 \n270.10 \n273.50 \n \n \n367.20 \n360.00 \n \n \n356.30 \n368.70 \n989.80  1,006.00 \n290.10 \n292.00 \n \n \n505.00 \n485.80 \n \n \n117.40 \n100.90 \n \n \n \n \n912.50 \n878.70 \n \n \n93.50 \n111.10 \n\n2002 \n268.90 \n \n454.70 \n \n429.40 \n1,153.00 \n376.30 \n \n595.10 \n \n120.80 \n \n \n\n \n60.80 \n\n1,092.20 \n\n2003 \n268.20 \n \n552.50 \n \n169.30 \n990.00 \n461.10 \n \n716.00 \n \n140.10 \n \n \n\n1,317.20 \n\n \n(327.20) \n\n2004 \n262.80 \n \n528.30 \n \n264.90 \n1,056.00 \n348.60 \n \n680.70 \n \n164.00 \n \n \n\n1,193.30 \n\n \n(137.30) \n\n2005 \n309.50 \n \n503.50 \n \n266.00 \n1,079.00 \n346.00 \n \n596.10 \n \n158.30 \n \n \n1,100.40 \n \n(21.40) \n\nNet Assets \n( ) = negative, IPP = independent power producer, NPC = National Power Corporation, P = peso, PSALM = Power \nSector Assets and Liabilities Corporation \na   Depreciated replacement cost of power plants plus construction work in progress. \nb    Includes bond and loan principal net of current portion. \nc    Includes a one-off charge of P78 billion due to a change in the accounting treatment of foreign exchange and IPP \n\nlosses.

On  31  December  2004,  the \nGovernment assumed a portion of PSALM\u2019s financial obligations, totaling about P200 billion. On \n13 April 2005, ERC issued its final approval for an increase of P1.0353/kilowatt-hour (kWh) in \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\npower  generation  base  rate,  effective  from  26  April  2005.  ERC  also  approved  additional \nincreases  of  P0.4239/kWh  through  the  generation  rate  adjustment  mechanism  (GRAM)  and \nP0.14/kWh  through  the  incremental  currency  exchange  rate  adjustment  (ICERA)  to  recover \nincreasing fuel costs and unfavorable currency fluctuations. \n \n23. \nAs  a  result  of  these  financial  adjustments,  PSALM  averted  a  liquidity  crisis  and  turned \naround its financial position. For the first time in 7 years, PSALM reported a positive net income \n(P7.9 billion) in 2005 before inclusion of foreign exchange gain. After inclusion of a large (non-\ncash)  foreign  exchange  gain  (P78  billion),  PSALM  reported  a  record  high  net  income  of  P86 \nbillion  in  2005,  compared  with  a  record  low  of  P117  billion  net  loss  (including  P78  billion  of \nforeign exchange loss) in 2003. PSALM\u2019s DSCR, a key indicator of its financial health, improved \nconsiderably to about 0.81 times in 2005, compared with extremely low levels of 0.13 in 2003 \nand 0.15 times in 2004. A sharp reduction of PSALM\u2019s share of the consolidated public sector \ndeficit,  from  a  record  high  level  of  2.0%  of  GDP  in  2004  to  an  estimated  0.1%  in  2005,  was \nanother indicator of its improved liquidity position.   \n \n24.  With  further  progress  in  the  power  sector  restructuring  and  privatization,  PSALM\u2019s \nfinancial position would improve due to (i) revenue from the sale of NPC generation facilities, (ii) \nrevenue from the transmission grid concessionaire, (iii) Government\u2019s absorption of any further \nPSALM  debt,  (iv)  revenue  from  the  stranded  debt  and  stranded  contract  cost  portion  to  be \nincluded in the universal charge levied on all electricity end users for IPP contracts approved by \nthe  Government  before  31  December  2000,  and  (v)  financial  gains  from  renegotiating  IPP \ncontracts.  Following  EPIRA\u2019s  mandate,  PSALM  has  renegotiated  substantially  20  of  the  35 \ncontracts that NPC has with IPPs, resulting in savings of about $1 billion in discounted present \nvalue terms. However, EPIRA also requires that all outstanding financial obligations of electric \ncooperatives  (EC)  to  National  Electrification  Administration  (NEA)  and  other  Government \nagencies be forgiven and assumed by PSALM, and that the electricity retail rate of each EC be \nreduced by an amount commensurate to the resulting savings.   \n \n\n2. \n\nPrivatization Program \n\n25. \nThe  PSRP  and  EPIRA  targets  for  privatizing  the  eligible  NPC  power  generating  plants \nwere  optimistic,  primarily  due  to  (i)  the  continuing  effects  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  which \nconstrained electricity demand growth; and (ii) the rapid private sector implementation of large \nblocks of more environmentally acceptable, natural gas-fired power generating plants in Luzon \nwith Government support. This reduced the utilization of older NPC-contracted IPP power plants \nand  NPC\u2019s  own  power  plants  until  electricity  demand  rebounded  to  higher  levels.  The  lack  of \nprospective  market  share  in  the  near  term,  therefore,  limited  investor  interest  in  bidding  for \neligible NPC power generating plants in the last few years. However, steadily growing electricity \ndemand,  the  Government\u2019s  vigorous  efforts  to  associate  transition  supply  contracts  to  eligible \nNPC  power  generating  plants,  and  the  initial  operations  of  the  WESM  are  stimulating  greater \nprivate sector interest in acquiring eligible NPC power generating plants. Further strengthening \nof ERC under the PSDP also will help allay private sector perceptions of regulatory and country \nrisks. \n \n26. \nSome  general  factors  also  have  hampered  the  ongoing  privatization  program.  First, \nsince the adoption of EPIRA and the start of the privatization program, many US and European \ninvestors in the power sector have encountered serious financial difficulties, while others have \nscaled down their investment particularly in developing countries. The commercial lenders that \nsuffered  losses  from  their  investments  in  the  1990s  also  have  reduced  their  exposure  to  the \npower sector. In addition to these external factors that affected all emerging markets, investors \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nperceive the country and regulatory risks associated with political events in the Philippines to be \nhigh. Although the ERC has been making steady progress in fulfilling its mandate under EPIRA, \nseveral  of  its  decisions  have  been  challenged  and  reversed  by  the  Supreme  Court  based  on \nprocedural  lapses. 18  These  judicial  interventions  affect  investors\u2019  confidence  in  the  new \nregulatory framework.  \n \n27. \nIn  countries  that  have  successfully  implemented  privatization  of  generation  assets, \nbilateral supply contracts19 generally were attached to these assets to provide a  viable market \nfor investors and a bankable project for lenders. Without such contracts, investors are unable to \nmobilize  long-term  financing  from  commercial  banks.  Concluding  such  bilateral  contracts \nbetween  power  generation  plants  and  distribution  utilities  (DU)  is  relatively  easy  when  both \nparties  are  initially  government-owned.  In  the  Philippines,  however,  the  private  sector \ntraditionally has owned DUs, which are not compelled under EPIRA to sign long-term bilateral \nsupply  contracts  with  NPC\u2019s  power  plants.  Since  EPIRA  envisages  the  introduction  of  retail \ncompetition for large consumers with demand over 1 MW, DUs might face competition for such \nconsumers  and  even  lose  part  of  the  business  in  their  franchise  areas.  For  example,  with  the \nprospect of losing its monopoly in its franchise area, Meralco\u2014accounting for 56% of national \nelectricity sales\u2014has refused to enter into a bilateral supply contract with NPC. Even if Meralco \nand/or some DUs enter into bilateral contracts, potential investors for generation assets still will \nneed to assess the credit risk of these electricity offtakers.20 This is particularly important if the \nofftaker is an EC. 21 The recent decision by Mirant Corporation, 22  the largest IPP investor in the \nPhilippines,  to  sell  its  assets  in  the  country  also  creates  serious  competition  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s  privatization  program,  since  Mirant\u2019s  IPPs  will  retain  their  original  Government-\nguaranteed bilateral contracts for electricity sales. \n \n28. \nThe EPIRA target was the privatization of 70% of NPC\u2019s eligible capacity in Luzon and \nVisayas  by  June  2004.  Seven  hydroelectric  power  plants,  with  a  combined  rated  capacity  of \n115.4  MW,  have  been  auctioned  off  (for  $134  million)\u2014i.e.,  only  2.7%  of  the  4,336  MW  of \neligible  generation  assets  for  privatization.  The  bidding  for  the  360  MW  Magat  Hydroelectric \nPower  Plant  is  scheduled  before  the  end  of  2006.  The  bidding  for  the  600  MW  coal-fired \nMasinloc  Thermal  Power  Plant  failed  because  the  winning  bidder  was  unable  to  secure \nfinancing for its purchase in the absence of a bilateral supply contract. Similarly, the bidding for \nthe  600  MW  Calaca  Thermal  Power  Plant  failed  because  the  best  offer  did  not  meet  the \nGovernment\u2019s reserve (minimum expected) price. PSALM is negotiating bilateral contracts to be \n\n                                                 \n18 As  an  example,  on  16  August  2006,  the  Supreme  Court  declared  invalid  the  ERC\u2019s  approval  of  Meralco\u2019s  tariff \nadjustment for the recovery of its purchase cost under GRAM, because the adjustment was not published for public \nconsultation. \n\n19 A  bilateral  contract  is  a  contract  between  a  generator  and  a  purchaser  for  a  market-trading  period  to  supply  a \nspecific quantity of electricity at a quoted price. If the market price for that period is higher than the quoted price, \nthe  generator  will  refund  the  difference  to  the  purchaser;  if  the  quoted  price  is  higher  than  the  market  price,  the \npurchaser will refund the difference to the generator.  \n\n20 Meralco\u2019s Foreign Currency Corporate Credit Rating by Standard & Poor\u2019s suffered nine downgrades in the last 4 \nyears, from BB+ in 1999 to CC in 2003. As one of the major creditors of Meralco, ADB has granted the necessary \nconsents  and  waivers,  allowing  Meralco  to  refinance  its  short-term  unsecured  debt  liabilities  of  $228  million \nmaturing  in  2004\u20132006  with  a  7-year  secured  loan  facility  under  a  comprehensive  liability  management  plan. \nSubsequently, Standard & Poor\u2019s raised its long-term credit rating on Meralco to B- in February 2005.  \n\n21 Including  Meralco,  the  Philippines  has  19  investor-owned  utilities  (81%  of  countrywide  retail  sales)  and  120 \ncustomer-owned ECs (19% of countrywide retail sales). These are classified into four categories: A\u2013creditworthy, \nfinancially  self-sufficient  (about  25%  of  the  DUs);  B\u2013partially  creditworthy,  large  size  and  density,  with  potential \nefficiency  gains  (about  10%);  C\u2013marginal  viability,  unable  to  attract  private  financing  (about  35%);  and  D\u2013\nnonviable, operating in low-density and disadvantaged areas (about 30%). \n\n22 Mirant Philippines assets include the 1,218 MW coal fired power plant in Sual, Pangasinan; the 735 MW coal-fired \n\npower plant in Pagbilao, Quezon; and a 20% share in the 1,200 MW Ilijan natural gas facility in Batangas. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nassigned to each plant eligible for privatization, and rebidding the Masinloc and Calaca plants in \nlight of the lessons from the failed bids. The demonstrated satisfactory operation of the WESM \nprovides an incentive for investors to sell at least part of the output from an electricity generation \nproject, and also will make investors factor in project location advantages in the grid for future \ndispatch  and  market  share.  For  DUs  (including  Meralco),  the  potential  price  volatilities  of  the \nWESM will be an incentive for them to enter into bilateral contracts with power generators.  \n \n29. \nFor  the  TransCo  concession,  two  auctions  failed  due  to  an  insufficient  number  of \nqualified bidders.23 In accordance with EPIRA, the private concessionaire of TransCo will need \nto  obtain  from  Congress  a  national  franchise  to  operate  the  transmission  facilities.  However, \nCongress has refused to grant such a franchise to a future concessionaire without knowing its \nidentity, i.e., before the selection process is completed. In May 2006, PSALM launched a third \nround of bidding, and received 12 expressions of interest. In September 2006, three consortia of \nbidders submitted prequalification documents. In contrast to the previous two rounds of bidding, \na  new  concession  structure  has  been  adopted  that  will  require  financial  closing  only  after \nCongress  grants  a  franchise.  Although  time-consuming,  this  structure  will  reduce  regulatory \nrisks  to  the  investor. 24  Along  with  ADB,  the  World  Bank  and  the  International  Finance \nCorporation have announced their intention to provide political risk guarantee and/or funding for \nthe bidders. The bid opening is scheduled on 20 December 2006. \n \n\n3. \n\nTransition to Competitive Markets \n\n \nThe WESM, established with ADB financing, 25 began commercial operations on 26 June \n30. \n2006 with several important risk mitigation measures in place. These include (i) the stipulation of \nbid caps on wholesale electricity spot prices to arrest abnormal volatility and consequent market \ninstability;  (ii)  the  establishment  of  a  tripartite  market  monitoring  committee,  comprising  ERC, \nDOE, and PEMC; and (iii) the designation of NPC and PSALM as default wholesale suppliers to \nthose  bulk  offtakers  of  grid  electricity  that  might  have  difficulty  in  directly  participating  in  the \nWESM. These actions will enhance the credibility of the WESM. \n \n31.  While  the  privatization  is  in  progress,  PSALM  and  NPC  are  assuming  on  a  transitional \nbasis the trading role in WESM for NPC-contracted IPP electricity generating plants and NPC\u2019s \nown generating plants. PSALM has established four trading teams, representing the four groups \nof NPC-contracted IPP generating plants proposed to be allocated later to IPP administrators.  \nNPC  also  has  established  nine  trading  teams  for  its  own  power  stations.  While  these \narrangements  try  to  simulate  the  electricity  trading  structure  that  should  exist  at  the  end  of \nprivatization,  the  reality  is  that  all  trading  affects  the  same  public  participants  (PSALM  and \nNPC).  Moreover,  NPC  procures  all  fuel  and  coordinates  maintenance  for  all  power  plants \nincluding IPPs. Therefore, the private sector and investors might perceive these arrangements \n\n                                                 \n23 The first bidding in July 2003 failed as only one party, Singapore Power, submitted a pre-qualification proposal. The \n\nsecond bidding held in August 2004 also failed as only the same party submitted an Expression of Interest.  \n\n24 Originally,  the  Government  decided  to  proceed  with  a  two-phase  approach  for  TransCo\u2019s  privatization.  Phase  1 \nwould  commence  upon  award  of  the  concession  to  the  winning  bidder.  At  that  time,  the  concessionaire  would \nassume  responsibility  for  the  functions  of  repair,  maintenance,  expansion,  construction,  and  financing  of  the \ntransmission network. As the franchise for operation of a public utility would be with TransCo during phase 1, the \nnon-delegable functions (e.g., monitoring and control of the transmission system, and filing of rates with the ERC) \nwould remain with TransCo. Phase 2 would commence when Congress awards a franchise to the concessionaire, \nafter which the concessionaire would take over all the operational functions of TransCo.  \n\n25 ADB.  2002.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nRepublic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Electricity  Market  and  Transmission  Development  Generation  Project.  Manila \n(Loan 1984-PHI). \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\nas \u201ccoordinated trading.\u201d26 In August 2006, ERC addressed the structural issues arising from the \ndominant  position  of  PSALM  and  NPC  in  generation,  and  Meralco  in  distribution,  by \npromulgating competition rules and complaint response procedures to ensure fair competition.  \n \n\n4. \n\nSecurity of Supply \n\n32. \nIn the short term, the Philippines does not face a risk of a countrywide electricity supply \nshortage,  as  experienced  in  the  early  1990s.  The  tables  in  Appendix  4  show  the  electricity \ndemand  forecasts  for  each  of  the  three  main  grids  in  the  country  (Luzon,  Visayas,  and \nMindanao).  Based  on  the  forecast  demand  growth  rate,  Luzon  will  need  new  generation \ncapacity around 2012 to provide adequate capacity margin. The supply situation in the Visayas \nis  more  acute,  with  additional  generation  capacity  required  in  2009.  In  August  2006,  a \nconsortium  of  foreign  investors  entered  into  an  agreement  with  NPC,  which  acts  as  an \naggregator  of  the  power  demand  of  various  DUs,  to  build  a  200  MW  coal-fired  power  plant  in \nCebu for commissioning in 2009. In Mindanao, commissioning of the 200 MW Mindanao coal-\nfired power plant in January 2007 will alleviate the electricity supply situation for about 2 years \nto 2009.  \n \n33. \nTherefore, increased private sector participation in power generation clearly is needed, \nparticularly since EPIRA does not provide for a default investor for power generation, and NPC \nis  prohibited  from  providing  new  power  generating  capacity  or  purchasing  power  through  new \nbilateral  contracts  from  IPPs.  However,  the  open  access  power  transmission  and  distribution \nenvisaged  under  EPIRA  enables  private  sector  power  generators  to  provide  electricity  to  the \nmarket of DUs and eligible retail customers. ERC needs to facilitate this mode of bridging supply \nand  demand.  The  mechanisms  and  measures  under  EPIRA  should  improve  the  investment \nclimate and create conditions that promote generation investment to ensure power supply in the \ncountry.  However,  these  measures  cannot  guarantee  adequate,  market-driven  generation \ninvestment.  For  this  reason,  DOE  will  maintain  a  contingency  plan  that  defines  the \nGovernment\u2019s  responsibility  to  ensure  generation  adequacy  if  generation  investment  is \ninsufficient (para. 59). \n \nC. \n\nLessons \n\n34. \nThe  Philippines  is  among  the  first  ADB  developing  member  countries  to  implement \nfundamental power sector restructuring, with substantive privatization of generation assets and \nconcessionaire  agreements  with  private  parties  to  operate  transmission  assets,  to  achieve  a \ncompetitive  market  for  electricity.  In  the  prevailing  economic  environment,  this  is  an  ambitious \nand  complex  task  that  involves  coordinated  actions  on  legislative,  regulatory,  and  policy \nmeasures spread over a reasonably long period. A more appropriate modality for fundamental \npower  sector  restructuring  of  the  magnitude  envisaged  under  the  PSRP  would  have  been  a \ncluster approach, which would have prioritized and sequenced the reforms more realistically in \nphases. In the first phase, the PSRP could have concentrated on establishing a sound policy, \nlegal, and regulatory framework to introduce a competitive market. Laying the ground work for \nthe  transfer  of  assets,  privatization,  and  absorption  of  stranded  debt  could  have  been \naccomplished in subsequent phases.  \n \n35. \nTherefore,  one  important  lesson  is  that  power  sector  restructuring  in  developing \ncountries is a long process. As such, the design of policy reforms should recognize the need for \na  steady  approach  with  a  phased  and  realistic  implementation  schedule.  The  PSRP,  as \n\n                                                 \n26 The allegation of price manipulation by PSALM in October 2006 was an illustration of such concerns.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\ndesigned in 1998, underestimated the complexities of the prevailing investment climate\u2014judicial \nand  regulatory\u2014which  plays  a  significant  role  in  privatization  of  power  entities.  Further,  the \nlegislative  branch  in  the  Philippines  has  some  unique  characteristics  that  can  make  any \nimportant  decision  a  lengthy  process.  The  investment  climate  also  has  been  affected  by  the \njudiciary overruling ERC rulings and weak contract enforcement, as manifested in some private \nsector deals involving public utilities. As such, adequate regulatory independence and broader \nimprovements in governance of the judicial system must be ensured for power reforms to move \nahead in a timely manner.  \n \n36.  Most of these findings have been mirrored in the recent evaluation of the PSRP in the \nPhilippines.27 The policy matrix of the PSRP included 60 actions and measures to be completed \nby  the  Government  within  3  years.  In  April  2004,  the  evaluation  by  the  Program  Completion \nReview found a high level of formal compliance, with 80% of those measures fully implemented \nand  20%  partly  implemented.  The  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  largely  was \nestablished;  NPC  was  unbundled  and  corporatized;  and  the  preparations  for  privatization  and \nwholesale competition were advanced. However, the objectives of making the sector financially \nviable, and privatizing NPC\u2019s assets were not achieved. In addition, ERC\u2019s technical expertise \nunder the new regulatory regime raised concerns.  \n \n37. \nTheoretically, timely privatization of generation and transmission assets ought to reduce \nfinancial  difficulties  of  public  sector  power  utilities  and  ease  government  budget  pressure. \nHowever,  the  PSRP  underestimated  the  nexus  between  the  public  sector  liabilities  and  high \nfiscal  deficit,  which  impacted  the  ability  to  meet adjustment costs.  As  a result,  the  progress  of \npower sector restructuring was slowed. Over the past few years, inefficiencies of Government-\nowned corporations have perpetuated the fiscal deficit and eroded the Government\u2019s ability to \nfinance  the  structural  adjustment  costs  of  power  entities.  Such  financing  is  essential  to \nfacilitating privatization and restoring power sector financial sustainability. As such, future power \nsector  operations  should  recognize  the  nexus  and  complexities  of  debt  resolution  of  state \nenterprises at a time of high and unsustainable fiscal deficits. In the Philippines, the fiscal deficit \nwill continue to impede the prospects of an early absorption of NPC\u2019s stranded debt, which in \nturn  constrains  the  ability  of  PSALM  to  raise  resources  at  competitive  prices.  Moreover,  the \nrestructuring cost should take into account the possible timing mismatch between cash inflows \nfrom the expected privatization revenues and cash outflows, particularly in the initial years.  \n \n38. \nIn  particular,  preparation  of  the  PSDP  benefited  from  the  Sector  Assistance  Program \nEvaluation (SAPE) 28 of ADB\u2019s assistance to the Philippines\u2019 power sector. The SAPE provided \na comprehensive and independent assessment of ADB\u2019s assistance to the sector, and identified \nlessons  and  areas  where  ADB  could  work  more  effectively  to  achieve  its  development \nobjectives. With  the sector  reforms  at  a critical  transition  phase,  and  the  sector  still  needing  a \nhuge amount of liquidity to meet its financial obligations, SAPE concluded that ADB should not \ncease support. In terms of future assistance in the power sector, SAPE recommended that ADB \n(i)  support  sector  reforms  through  policy-based  lending  and  technical  assistance  (TA);  (ii) \nrestrict  public  sector  lending  to  solvent  entities,  and  avoid  supporting  projects  that  increase \nfinancial  losses  and  indebtedness;  and  (iii)  support  private  sector  participation  in  the  power \nsector  through  improved  governance  and  transparency.  Accordingly,  the  proposed  PSDP  will \nprovide  policy-based  lending  to  assist  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda  and  facilitate  private \nsector investment. \n\n                                                 \n27 ADB. 2004.

A special evaluation study29 called for greater \nflexibility  in  program  design  by  considering  the  standard  two-tranche  design  with  a  relatively \nshort implementation period, as well as options with single tranche and program clusters\u2014the \nlatter allowing a process approach rather than a blueprint approach. The study pointed out the \nimportance  of  political  economy  factors,  such  as  (i)  the  commitment  to,  and  the  timing  of,  the \nreform; (ii) the length of the government tenure; and (iii) the extent of the crisis. An evaluation of \nADB operations in the Philippines30 also emphasized the importance of such factors, concluding \nthat  flexibility  in  implementation  schedules  was  essential  for  program  lending  to  allow  for  the \nimpact of political economy factors.  \n\n \n\nD. \n\nExternal Assistance and Funding Agency Coordination \n\n40. \nADB  is  the  lead  official  development  partner  in  the  energy  sector,  with  a  focus  on  the \nelectricity subsector. Since 1971, ADB has provided 28 loans with a combined amount of $2.3 \nbillion to the energy sector. This has included 20 loans to NPC, guaranteed by the Government, \nwith  a  combined  value  of  $1.6  billion.  In  addition  to  lending,  ADB  provided  two  PCGs  to  help \nNPC  raise  long-term  funds  totaling  $642  million.  ADB  has  also  provided  34  TA  grants  to  the \nenergy  sector  with  a  combined  value  of  $15  million,  covering  areas  such  as  (i)  coal  industry \ndevelopment, (ii) rural electrification, (iii) energy conservation, (iv) tariff and pricing studies, (v) \nregulation,  (vi)  consumer  impact  assessment,  (vii)  geothermal  steam  and  natural  gas  pricing \nstudies,  (viii)  power  development  planning,  (ix)  feasibility  studies,  and  (x)  environmental \nassessments. A list of ADB assistance to the energy sector is in Appendix 5. \n \nThe  World  Bank  also  has  been  active  in  the  power  sector.  To  improve  coordination  of \n41. \nADB- and World Bank-assisted operations, ADB and the World Bank reached an understanding \nin  1998  on  the  division  of  responsibility  in  the  power  sector.  According  to  this  understanding, \nADB  would  take  the  lead  in  providing  policy  advice  to  the  Government  on  power  sector \nrestructuring,  while  continuing  support  to  NPC  before  its  privatization.  The  World  Bank  would \nassume  a  more  prominent  role  in  rural  electrification  programs.  Other  major  multilateral  and \nbilateral  agencies  involved  in  the  sector  include  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation \n(JBIC),  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  the  United  States  (US)  Overseas  Private \nInvestment  Corporation,  and  the  US  Agency  for  International  Development.  ADB  has  been \ncoordinating  its  assistance  to  the  sector  with  other  agencies,  particularly  the  World  Bank  and \nJBIC. A summary of major external assistance to the power sector is in Appendix 6. \n \nIn  preparing  the  PSDP,  ADB,  JBIC,  the  World  Bank,  DOE,  and  other  Government \n42. \nagencies  held  several  meetings  to  ensure  the  close  coordination  of  external  support  for  the \npower  sector  reform  agenda.  Given  ADB\u2019s  history  of  support  for  power  sector  reforms  in  the \nPhilippines, and the comprehensive program that it has designed with Government agencies in \nrecent months (as reflected in the PSDP), the Government considered it appropriate for ADB to \ncontinue its lead role, at the same time welcoming continuation of the strong support from other \ndevelopment partners. ADB and other development partners are strongly aligned on the overall \nreform agenda, and on the need to restore financial health of PSALM and facilitate privatization. \nThe development partners also share an understanding of the urgency for power sector reforms \nto support the Government\u2019s broader task of fiscal consolidation, which is the primary focus for \nmacroeconomic  management.  The  World  Bank  is  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal \nconsolidation through a development policy loan (DPL), which includes a component to support \n\n                                                 \n29 ADB. 2001.

The World Bank also approved a TA grant to complement ADB\u2019s assistance, \n31 and  is  considering  a  partial  risk  guarantee  for  the  private  concessionaire  of  TransCo  (para. \n29).    \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale, Objective, and Assistance Modality \n\nADB\u2019s CSP 2005\u20132007 for the Philippines (footnote 1) identifies power sector reform as \n43. \none of the main interventions for directly impacting the most important development constraints, \nsuch as the fiscal imbalance and poor investment climate. As the lead financing agency in the \nsector, ADB has continued to conduct policy dialogue, as well as review and monitor the power \nsector reform and privatization process. While recognizing the main issues and challenges, ADB \ncontinues to support the broad direction for power sector restructuring.  \n \n44. \nThe  restructuring  has  reached  an  important  juncture.  The  legal,  regulatory,  and \ninstitutional  framework  for  privatization  and  competition  is  largely  in  place.  However,  for  the \nrestructuring  to  succeed,  the  sector\u2019s  financial  viability  has  to  be  restored,  regulatory \nperformance  improved,  and  the  confidence  of  private  sector  investors  enhanced.  The \nGovernment  needs  ADB\u2019s  support  in  all  these  areas  to  consolidate  the  restructuring  process. \nDespite the commitment demonstrated by the Government to honor existing IPP contracts, the \nprivate  sector  is  still  cautious  about  investing  large  funds  in  the  power  sector  due  to  the \nperceived political, regulatory, and commercial risks. The Government has requested additional \nADB assistance for the sector restructuring to (i) correct the long-term financial problems of the \nsector, (ii) strengthen the regulatory performance, (iii) enhance conditions for privatization, and \n(iv) improve public confidence in the reforms. \n \n45. \nThe goal of the PSDP is a financially sustainable, efficient, and secure power supply that \narrests  the  power  sector\u2019s  drain  on  the  Government\u2019s  finances,  freeing  up  resources  for  the \nsocial sectors, and minimizes the risk of power shortages that would impede economic growth.  \n \n46. \nBecause of uncertainties about the scope and completion dates of some actions that are \nbeyond the direct control of the Government, a program cluster consisting of two subprograms \nis  proposed.  The  lessons  from  the  PSRP  with  regard  to  the  design  of  a  reform  program  are \nclear:  (i)  the  program  should  cover  only  areas  directly  relevant  to  its  objectives,  (ii)  an  overly \ncomplex policy matrix with too many measures should be avoided, (iii) the measures should be \nobjective-  rather  than  action-oriented,  (iv)  the  schedule  for  program  implementation  should  be \nrealistic, and (v) a longer time frame should be factored in where measures beyond government \ncontrol are needed (e.g., legislative changes). Lessons (i)\u2013(iii) are reflected in the policy matrix \n(Appendix 2), while lessons (iv) and (v) are taken into account by following a cluster approach \n(i.e.,  subprogram  1  and  subprogram  2).  The  two  subprograms  have  2-year  time  horizons, \ncovering 2007\u20132008 and tentatively 2009\u20132010. Target dates are set only for subprogram 1 to \nallow  flexibility  in  the  overall  implementation  schedule.  As  subprogram  1  approaches \ncompletion,  its  accomplishments  will  be  reviewed.  The  results  will  help  define  the  scope  and \nschedule of subprogram 2. This flexibility in program design will allow adjustments to be made \nbased on the results of subprogram 1 and changes in the external environment. \n \n\n                                                 \n31 World Bank. 2006. Philippines: Preparation of Private Sector Development Support/Guarantee for Power Sector \n\nReform Project. Washington, DC.  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\nFor  subprogram  1  of  the  PSDP,  the  objectives  are  to  (i)  provide  financial  assistance, \n47. \nthrough  a  program  loan,  to  help  the  Government  meet  part  of  the  power  sector  restructuring \ncosts; (ii) establish the necessary conditions for substantial progress in the privatization program \nunder  subprogram  2;  (iii)  improve  confidence  in  regulatory  performance;  and  (iv)  ensure  a \nsmooth  transition  to  competitive  markets.  Since  the  financial  recovery  of  the  power  sector  is \nessential  to  fiscal  consolidation,  the  upfront  actions  of  the  PSDP\u2014such  as  the  increase  in \nNPC\u2019s  generation  tariff  and  the  Government\u2019s  assumption  of  P200  billion  of  NPC\u2019s  debt\u2014are \namong  the  first  important  steps  to  restore  the  power  sector\u2019s  financial  viability.  Effective  and \ntimely  implementation  of  the  PSDP  will  lead  to  a  reliable  and  financially  sustainable  power \nsector, while contributing to the Government\u2019s fiscal consolidation.  \n \n48. \nTentatively, subprogram 2 may include a PCG  to support PSALM\u2019s debt management, \nand political risk guarantee (PRG) to facilitate private sector investment in power generation and \ntransmission. ADB expects to leverage its own resources by cooperating with commercial and \nofficial political risk insurers through the use of coinsurance and reinsurance. ADB might require \na  counter-indemnity  or  other  assurance  from  the  Government,  depending  on  the  level  of  risk \nassociated with the contractual obligations and commitments it has been asked to guarantee.   \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Framework \n\nThe policy matrix (Appendix 2) describes the main policy actions necessary to achieve \n49. \nthe  PSDP\u2019s  objective:  (i)  ensuring  financial  viability  of  the  power  sector,  (ii)  strengthening  the \nsector  regulatory  framework,  (iii)  restructuring  the  market  towards  competition,  (iv)  promoting \nprivate  sector  participation  in  the  power  sector,  and  (v)  enhancing  consumer  welfare  and \nprotection.  \n \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Viability of the Power Sector \n\nThe main actions required to improve the financial viability of the power sector will focus \n50. \non (i) timely tariff adjustment to reflect fuel cost and foreign currency fluctuations, coupled with \nNPC  and  TransCo  capital  expenditure  prioritization  and  operating  cost  control;  (ii)  use  of \nprivatization proceeds to reduce borrowings; (iii) introduction of a universal charge component in \nthe power tariff to cover stranded costs and debt; (iv) liability management and debt refinancing \non  more  favorable  terms;  (v)  Government  payment  to  PSALM  for  non-power  cost  of \nmultipurpose  projects;  and  (vi)    appropriate  budgetary  assistance  for  PSALM    to  achieve  a \nDSCR of at least 1.0 by the end of 2009. In particular, the introduction of the universal charge \nmust be achieved before the processing of subprogram 2. Subprogram 2 may include a PCG to \nassist  PSALM\u2019s  debt  management  program,  and  help  meet  the  debt  repayment  peak  around \n2009\u20132010. \n \nIn addition to justifiable adjustments in the average tariff levels, the tariff structure needs \n51. \nto  be  modified  to  reflect  more  accurately  the  cost  of  supplying  electricity  at  different  times  of \nday, in different grids, and to different consumer classes. ERC took the first step by approving \ntime-of-use  (TOU)  tariffs  at  the  generation  level,32 which  NPC  will  charge  to  the  DUs  and  its \nlarge direct consumers. This will be followed by the introduction of TOU pricing at the retail level \nfor consumers with a peak demand of at least 1MW, initially in Meralco\u2019s franchise area through \na customer choice program. By providing the right signals to such consumers, they will reduce \n                                                 \n32 The cost of supplying electricity is highest during the peak load period, because new generation capacity would be \nrequired if the demand were to exceed the available capacity. On the other hand, the cost of supply is as low as the \nincremental fuel costs during the low load period at night. The TOU tariffs will benefit large consumers who have \nthe ability to shift load to off-peak periods. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\ntheir demand during peak hours, curtailing the need for additional capacity. Another measure for \nrestoring the financial viability is the removal of cross-subsidies. Inter-grid and intra-grid cross-\nsubsidies  have  been  removed.  The  removal  of  the  remaining  inter-class  cross-subsidies33\u2014\nfrom  large  industrial  and  commercial  consumers  to  residential  consumers\u2014is  in  progress  to \nprovide the right price signals. \n \n52. \nGiven the large number of ECs, and their technical and financial problems, an approach \nneeds  to  be  developed,  and  guidelines  issued,  for  improving  their  efficiency  and  financial \nviability.  This  can  be  done  through  operational  and  structural  reforms,  such  as  merger, \nconsolidation,  integration,  and  bulk  procurement.  Action  under  subprogram  1  requires  the \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  strengthen  financially  weak  electricity  offtakers,  especially  ECs, \nwith tariff rationalization and mandatory restructuring. \n \n\n2. \n\nRegulatory Framework and Performance \n\nThe  proposed  PSDP  will  not  provide \n\n53. \nThe  success  of  restructuring  will  depend  to  a  large  extent  on  public  and  investor \nconfidence in sector regulation. This confidence will be based on perceptions of ERC\u2019s technical \nexpertise,  efficiency,  regulatory  consistency,  and  susceptibility  to  political  and  other  pressure. \nEffective  sector  regulation  also  relies  on  the  competence  and  reliability  of  other  sector \nparticipants.  If  regulated  entities  fail  to  submit  requests  for  tariff  adjustments,  or  do  so  with \nincomplete or inaccurate data, ERC will be unable to act, will act with incomplete information, or \nwill be forced to delay proceedings while waiting for the parties to complete the information.  \n \n54. \ninstitutional  development  and  capacity \nenhancement assistance to public and private sector participants. Clear guidance and discipline \nfrom ERC is expected to promote improvement in their performance. The proposed PSDP and \nongoing  TA34 will  support  ERC\u2019s  institutional  development,  and  organizational  efficiency  and \neffectiveness.  They  will  support  ERC\u2019s  ability  to  (i)  respond  efficiently  and  fairly  to  regulatory \ndemands; (ii) continuously improve its technical competence; and (iii) communicate clearly and \neffectively  on  regulatory  matters  with  the  public,  regulated  parties,  and  investors.  Further,  the \npolicy  actions  in  the  PSDP  also  support  ERC\u2019s  administrative  autonomy,  through  the  use  of \nindependent counsel, and its financial autonomy, through the use of fees levied from regulated \nutilities. \n \n55. \nSeveral  of  ERC\u2019s  decisions  have  been  challenged  and  reversed  on  procedural  bases, \nwhich  is  not  surprising  given  the  breadth,  complexity  and  political  sensitivity  of  ERC\u2019s  tasks. \nERC  is  making  steady  progress  in  fulfilling  its  mandate  under  EPIRA.  In  particular,  under  the \nongoing  ADB  TA  (footnote  31),  ERC  has  promulgated  Rules  of  Practice  and  Procedure  to \nimprove  the  efficiency,  transparency,  consistency,  and  predictability  of  its  hearing  and \ninvestigative  procedures.  Through  nationwide  public  consultations,  and  the  posting  of  its \ndecisions and guidelines on a Web site, ERC has enhanced the transparency of its decisions. \nThese efforts and improvements will reduce significantly the scope for judicial interventions on \nprocedural grounds. \n  \n\n                                                 \n33 ERC  has  begun  removing  inter-class  cross-subsidies  for  ECs.  On  8  October  2004,  ERC  approved  a  two-phase \n\nremoval of such cross-subsidies for customers of Meralco. \n\n34 ADB.  2004.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nMarket Restructuring Toward Competition \n\n56. \nThe  WESM  is  an  important  component  of  the  restructuring.  The  WESM  began \ncommercial operations on 26 June 2006 in the Luzon grid (paras. 30 and 31) and its operations \nare expected to be expanded to the Visayas grid in 2007, if warranted by the initial experience \nin Luzon and the power supply situation in those areas. The WESM will (i) provide appropriate \nprice  signals  for  capacity  additions  and  demand-side  management,  (ii)  ensure  optimal \nscheduling of power plants, (iii) reduce the need for regulation at the generation level, and (iv) \ncontribute  to  greater  private  sector  participation  and  competition  in  power  generation  and \nsupply. In the long run, this will reduce the Government\u2019s involvement in power generation and \nsupply.  \n \n57.  With more than 40% of electricity sales in Luzon traded through the WESM, wholesale \nelectricity  prices  declined  during  the  first  two  months  of  WESM  operations.  However,  market \nparticipants  also  face  potentially  higher  risks  as  demonstrated  by  the  recently  rising  WESM \nprices. Signing of bilateral contracts with a power generator will provide a hedge against price \nvolatility,  as  well  as  ensure  a  more  stable  power  supply.  For  power  plants  that  are  not  yet \nprivatized, PSALM will assign transition supply contracts (TSC), signed between NPC and DUs \n(or  other  purchasers)  and  approved  by  the  ERC.  These  TSCs  can  be  converted  into  bilateral \ncontracts  with  the  new  plant  owners,  who  can  transit  smoothly  to  the  WESM.  However, \nmeasures  are  needed  to  ensure  the  creditworthiness  of  DUs  (or  purchasers).  This  would \ngenerate  confidence  among  generators  that  the  DUs  will  be  able  to  meet  their  financial \ncommitments.  \n \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  WESM  will  be  expanded  to  Mindanao,  if  warranted  by  the \n58. \nexperience  in  Luzon  and  Visayas  under  subprogram  1  and  the  power  supply  situation.  Also \nunder subprogram 2, retail competition will start, initially only for consumers with a peak demand \nof at least 1MW. This will increase efficiency in the downstream segment of the power supply \nchain,  as  pressure  will  be  exerted  on  DUs  to  keep  their  tariffs  low  for  such  consumers  by  (i) \nreducing  system  losses,  (ii)  removing  inter-class  cross-subsidies,  and  (iii)  optimizing  their \nwholesale  power  purchase  contracting.  Following \nthe  experience  gathered  with  retail \ncompetition  for  such  large  consumers,  the  benefits  and  costs  of  expanding  the  competition  to \nresidential  and  other  small  consumers  will  need  to  be  assessed,  taking  into  account  the \nexperience of other, more advanced competitive foreign markets. \n \n59. \nThe  length  of  the  transition  period  until  the  market  functions  properly  and  induces \ncapacity additions by the private sector is difficult to estimate. To ensure a reliable power supply \nduring this period, the Government must be ready to play a backstop role, when necessary. As \nthe WESM is being implemented for the first time in the Philippines, the Government, through \nDOE,  will  prepare  a  contingency  plan  and  information  program  that  examines  conventional \nsupply,  demand-side,  and  distributed  generation  options  to  ensure  a  reliable  power  supply  in \naccordance  with  EPIRA,35 without  disrupting  the  development  of  a  competitive  energy  market. \nThis  should  include  publication  of  information  needed  for  investment  decisions,  such  as \nforecasts of the demand-supply balance, sector planning, and business opportunities. \n \n\n                                                 \n35 Section  71  of  EPIRA  stipulates:  \u201cUpon  the  determination  by  the  President  of  the  Philippines  of  an  imminent \nshortage  of  the  supply  of  electricity,  Congress  may  authorize,  through  a  joint  resolution,  the  establishment  of \nadditional generating capacity under such terms and conditions as it may approve.\u201d \n\n \n\n\f19\n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n60. \ninclude:  \n(i) \n\n4. \n\nPrivate Participation in Power Generation and Transmission \n\nThe  priority  actions  to  be  pursued  by  PSALM  to  increase  private  sector  participation \n\ncompleting the negotiations on TSCs between NPC and the DUs to facilitate the \nongoing process of bidding out NPC generation capacity to the private sector;  \ninitiating  a  customer  choice  program  to  allow  direct  contracting  between \ngenerators and large customers (those with a demand over 1 MW); and  \nintroducing  regulatory  requirements  and  incentives  for  electricity  offtakers  to \nenter  into  TSCs  by  imposing  a  premium  on  sale  prices  for  DUs  that  rely  on \ndefault wholesale supplier arrangements without such contracts. \n\nit \n\nInstead, \n\nfocuses  on  enhancing \n\n \nGiven the numerous factors that can affect the timely implementation of the privatization \n61. \nprogram, subprogram 1 does not include specific targets for selling a significant part of NPC\u2019s \ngeneration  capacity. \nfor \nimplementation  of  the  privatization  program.  The  sale  of  NPC\u2019s  generation  capacity  would \ncontinue  under  subprogram  2.  To  achieve  the  envisaged  large-scale  private  participation  in \npower  generation  and  transmission,  DOE  will  make  available  adequate  and  consistent \ninformation  needed  for  investment  decisions.  This  applies  to  the  various  documents  on  sector \nplanning, such as the Philippine Energy Plan, Power Development Program, and Transmission \nDevelopment Plan. DOE also must provide information on project opportunities, specifying main \nproject parameters, such as recommended location, capacity, fuel, and timing. \n \n\nthe  necessary  conditions \n\n5. \n\nConsumer Welfare and Protection \n\n62. \nThe  success  of  the  power  sector  restructuring  will  depend  on  public  acceptance  of \nreform  measures,  some  of  which  are  painful  for  consumers,  at  least  in  the  short  term.  The \nongoing  public  information  campaign  should  be  continued  and  intensified.  The  unavoidable \nneed  for  the  restructuring  has  to  be  explained  by  pointing  out  what  would  likely  happen  in  its \nabsence,  and  by  outlining  its  medium-  and  long-term  benefits.  The  campaign  should  be \naccompanied by promulgating consumer rights. ERC has issued the bill of rights for consumer \nprotection and its implementation guidelines. \n \n63. \nTo protect electricity consumers from service interruption, ERC has issued guidelines on \nthe  supplier  of  last  resort  in  case  of  a  retail  electricity  supplier\u2019s  suspension  from  the  WESM. \nThe  guidelines  also  cover  the  appointment  of  a  default  temporary  wholesale  supplier  for  DUs \nand ECs that are unable to participate in the WESM and the contract market. Furthermore, ERC \nhas  established  a  public  complaint  procedure,  a  consumer  complaint  desk  at  ERC,  and  a \nconsumer welfare desk at each of the DUs.  \n \n64.  When  cross-subsidies  are  removed,  welfare  losses  are  possible,  especially  for  poor \nhouseholds,  which  are  generally  more  vulnerable  than  the  non-poor.  ERC  has  established \n\u201clifeline  rates\u201d  for  marginalized  end  users.  The  lifeline  rate  provides  grid-connected  end  users \nthat consume low levels of electricity with a reduced electricity rate. The subsidies provided by \nthe  lifeline  rate  schemes  are  extensive.  With  the  changes  in  the  sales  mix,  the  lifeline  rates \nmight  need  to  be  reviewed  and  modified,  or  replaced  by  a  different  subsidy  mechanism,  to \nimprove targeting and protection of the poor.  For example, although the lifeline rates within the \nMeralco  franchise  area  are  not  applicable  to  all  electricity  consumers,  they  are  still  relatively \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\ngenerous  regarding  the  monthly  consumption  threshold.36   These  rates  probably  benefit  more \nthan the poor, and the discounts given might not be sufficient to cushion adequately the impact \nof  tariff  increases  on  the  poor.  Although  untargeted  assistance  to  large  groups  of  consumers \nmight be politically popular, it is not sustainable.  \n\n \n\nC. \n\nImportant Features of the PSDP \n\n65. \nThe  policy  framework  for  subprogram  1,  as  outlined  in  the  policy  matrix,  aims  to  (i) \nrestore  the  sector\u2019s  financial  soundness;  (ii)  address  the  regulatory  concerns  of  investors;  (iii) \nstart  wholesale  competition;  (iv)  improve  the  investment  climate  for  privatization,  including \neducating the public about the rationale for the restructuring; and (v) protect consumer welfare.  \nUnder  subprogram  2,  whose  scope  and  schedule  can  be  modified  based  on  the  results  of \nsubprogram 1, (i) the sector\u2019s financial soundness will be preserved; (ii) wholesale competition \nwill  be  expanded;  (iii)  retail  competition  will  be  started;  (iv)  a  significant  part  of  eligible \ngeneration assets will be privatized; and (v) TransCo concession will be awarded.  \n \nSpecifically,  the  policy  actions  prescribed  under  the  PSDP  will  address  the  major \n66. \nconstraints that affected the privatization of NPC, including the lack of bilateral supply contracts \nand the low creditworthiness of DUs. The policy actions are designed as a holistic solution with \na  multipronged  approach  that  recognizes  the  complexity  of  these  issues  and  the  interactions \nbetween  stakeholders.  To  promote  signing  of  bilateral  contracts,  DOE  requires  all  DUs  to \nensure adequate supply capacity for their captive markets, while ERC imposes a significant cost \npremium  for  DUs  relying  on  the  wholesale  supplier  of  last  resort  (i.e.,  their  demand  is  not \ncovered  by  a  TSC  and  the  WESM).  The  expected  price  volatilities  in  the  WESM  also  will \nmotivate  DUs  to  enter  into  bilateral  supply  contracts  to  optimize  their  market  risk  profile. \nHowever, the bilateral contracts signed with DUs will help the privatization process only if these \nDUs, particularly ECs, are creditworthy. Under the PSDP policy framework, DOE will implement \nan action plan to consolidate ECs. For ECs that rely on wholesale supplier of last resort and fail \nto cure the problems within a specified period, this plan will include actions such as mandatory \nNEA  or  NPC  transitional  participation  in  the  boards  of  ECs,  as  appropriate;  and  investment \nmanagement contracts with private investors. In parallel, ERC has issued guidelines to enable \nsmall and/or weak ECs to participate in the WESM through wholesale aggregators. The World \nBank\u2019s System Loss Reduction Project,37 will also help to strengthen ECs. \n  \n67. \nThe cluster approach will allow the Government and ADB to design subprogram 2 based \non  implementation  and  experience  gained  under  subprogram  1,  as  well  as  to  reflect  changes \nthat might occur in the external environment during subprogram 1. DOE will undertake a review \ntoward the end of subprogram 1. The review will result in a report, submitted for consideration to \nADB,  that  (i)  assesses  compliance  with  policy  actions  under  subprogram  1,  (ii)  assesses \nprogress  with  implementation  of  activities  under  the  PSDP,  and  (iii)  defines  requirements  for \nadjustments  to  the  scope  and  timing  of  activities  to  be  undertaken  under  subprogram  2.  The \nreview  will be  based  on  the  program  framework  (Appendix  1)  and  the  policy  matrix  (Appendix \n2), the principal tools for program performance monitoring and review. \n \n\n                                                 \n36 Meralco customers with a monthly consumption of less than 50 kWh receive a discount of 50%, between 51 kWh \n\nand 70 kWh receive 35%, and between 71 kWh and 100 kWh receive 20%.

The power sector will \ncontinue to require significant funding support from the Government during 2006\u20132010, thereby \nremaining a challenge to the Government\u2019s efforts at fiscal consolidation. As shown in Table 5, \nthe  power  sector  will  require  about  $9.2  billion  in  direct  Government  financial  support  during \n2006\u20132010,  which  will  be  met  mainly  through  (i)  universal  charge  for  stranded  liabilities  to  be \nintroduced  by  January  2008,  (ii)  Government  budget  allocations  to  cover  part  of  interest \npayments  of  Government-absorbed  NPC  loans,  (iii)  Government  commercial  borrowings  to \ncover  interest  and  principal  payments  of  Government-absorbed  NPC  loans,  and  (iv)  PSALM\u2019s \ncommercial  borrowings  with  Government  guarantee  to  cover  PSALM\u2019s  deficit.  A  detailed \nanalysis of PSALM\u2019s financial performance and projections is in Appendix 7.  \n \n\nTable 5: Power Sector Financial Requirements, 2006\u20132010 \n($ million) \n\nYear  Debt Service on Absorbed NPC Loans  PSALM Deficit \n\n \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \nTotal \nNPC = National Power Corporation, PSALM = Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nPrincipal \n640 \n \n \n500 \n \n1,140 \n\nInterest \n324 \n263 \n263 \n228 \n221 \n1,299 \n\n  \n1,172 \n1,052 \n  894 \n1,663 \n1,951 \n6,732 \n\nTotal \n  \n2,136 \n1,315 \n1,157 \n2,391 \n2,172 \n9,171 \n\n \nTable  6  below  shows  the  financing  plan  for  2006\u20132010.

Under subprogram 1, a policy-based program \nloan of $450 million will be provided, which accounts for 4.9% of the total financing requirement \nduring  the  period.  The  Government\u2019s  direct  contribution  (through  budget  allocations  and \ncommercial  borrowing)  will  be  $1,889  million,  representing  20.6%  of  the  requirement.  The \ncollection of the universal charges from January 2008 will generate $3,162 million, or 34.5% of \nthe financing requirement, during 2008\u20132010. PSALM will rely on commercial borrowing to raise \n$3,670  million, 38  representing  40.0%  of  the  requirement.  Under  subprogram  2,  ADB  will \nconsider PCGs to assist PSALM with raising commercial borrowing on competitive terms. \n \n\nTable 6: Power Sector Financing Plan, 2006\u20132010 \n($ million) \n\nSources \nAsian Development Bank \nUniversal charges \nGovernment budget and/or commercial \nborrowing \nPSALM commercial borrowing \nTotal \nPSALM = Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n                                                 \n38 On 25 October 2006, PSALM raised $500 million 10-year bonds with Government guarantee.  \n\nAmount \n450 \n3,162 \n1,889 \n\n3,670 \n9,171 \n\n% \n4.9 \n34.5 \n20.6 \n\n40.0 \n100.0 \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  ADB  loan  of  $450  million,  from  its  ordinary  capital  resources,  will  have  a  15-year \n70. \nterm,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years.  The  loan  will  carry  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  and  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  year.  As  the  Borrower,  the  Government  has  provided  ADB \nwith (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility based \non  these  terms  and  conditions;  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  made \nindependently, and did not rely on any communication or advice from ADB. The loan, expected \nto  be  utilized  over  24  months  from  January  2007  to  December  2008,  will  be  released  in  one \ntranche  upon  meeting  the  conditions  of  the  policy  matrix  and  upon  loan  effectiveness.  Before \nsubprogram 2 is processed, the Government will have to demonstrate satisfactory progress with \nimplementation of subprogram 1.  \n \nTo complement ADB\u2019s program loan, the World Bank will support the power sector as a \n71. \ncomponent  of  its  Development  Policy  Loans  (DPL),  which  is  envisaged  to  be  provided  in  the \namount  of  $250  million.  The  DPL  also  will  include  other  policy  areas,  including  (i)  fiscal \nconsolidation  and  macroeconomic  stability,  (ii)  governance  and  anticorruption,  (iii)  investment \nclimate,  and  (iv)  social  inclusion.  For  the  power  sector,  the  priority  actions  required  under  the \nWorld  Bank\u2019s  DPL  form  an  integral  part  of  the  policy  matrix  developed  under  PSDP.  The \nfinancial  resources  provided  by  the  World  Bank  will  help  the  Government  to  reduce  costly \ncommercial borrowings. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n72. \nDOF  is  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  program  loan,  while  DOE  is  the  Implementing \nAgency.  DOF  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  implementation  of  the  Program,  including  (i) \ncompliance  with  policy  actions,  (ii)  program  administration,  (iii)  disbursements,  and  (iv) \nmaintenance  of  program  records.  The  Energy  Executive  Committee  before  the  Effective  Date \nwill  be  formed  to  take  charge  of  PSDP\u2019s  implementation.  The  committee,  comprising  officials \nand  executives  of  DOE,  NEA,  NPC,  PEMC,  Philippine  National  Oil  Company,  PSALM,  and \nTransCo, will meet at least once a month. DOE will be responsible for the monitoring of program \nimplementation activities, and reporting implementation progress. \n \n\n2. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs  (excluding \n73. \nlocal  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible items (Appendix 8) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loan,39 the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed \nto  the  Government  as  the  Borrower.  Supporting  import  documentation  will  not  be  required,  if \nduring each year that loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of Philippines\u2019 total \nimports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed \nunder other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan \nexpected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance with this \nformula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing \n\n                                                 \n39 ADB. 1998.

ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and verify \nthe accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n\n3. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n74. \nThe  Government  will  use  counterpart  funds  generated  by  the  program  loan,  under \narrangements satisfactory to ADB, to support the sector restructuring and meet the adjustment \ncosts  associated  with  the  PSDP,  as  agreed  upon  by  the  Government.  The  counterpart  funds \ngenerated  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  transferred  from  the  Treasury  to  DOF  to  meet  the \ncosts and counterpart funding requirements of the Program.  \n \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption \n\n75. \nThe Government was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy and Policy relating to the \nCombating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require  the \nGovernment  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The documentation between ADB and the Government will further \nallow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. In particular, \nall contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Program shall include provisions specifying \nthe right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Program.  \n \n\n5. \n\nMonitoring and Review \n\n76. \nIn  cooperation  with  DOF  and  DOE,  ADB  will  review  periodically  the  implementation \nprogress of the PSDP, and will assess the impact of the PSDP on the sector. The Government \nwill keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral \nagencies that have implications for implementation of the PSDP, and will provide ADB with the \nopportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals. \n\n \n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing and Reporting \n\n77. \nDOE  shall  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  (i)  semi-annual  progress  reports  on  program \nimplementation and (ii) a subprogram 1 final review report by December 2008. The report will (i) \nevaluate the implementation of the policy reform measures under the subprogram 1 of PSDP, \n(ii)  assess  the  impact  on  the  sector,  (iii)  describe  lessons  from  the  program  period,  and  (iv) \noutline further reforms and assistance needed for the development of the sector. In particular, \ngiven the need to closely monitor the financial recovery of the power sector, the Government will \nrequire PSALM to furnish ADB with certified copies of PSALM\u2019s audited consolidated financial \nstatements,  including  the  financial  statements  of  NPC  and  TransCo,  not  later  than  6  months \nafter the end of each related fiscal year.  \n \n78. \nThe  policy  matrix  (Appendix  2)  contains  22  actions  that  are  conditions  precedent  to \nsubmission  of  the  PSDP  to  the  Board.  Satisfactory  implementation  of  the  PSDP,  and \ncompliance  with  seven  actions,  is  required  to  enable  processing  of  subprogram  2.  During \nsubprogram  1,  16  policy  actions  need  to  be  accomplished,  while  seven  actions  must  be \naccomplished  during  subprogram  2.  Documentary  evidence,  in  a  form  satisfactory  to  ADB,  is \nrequired to demonstrate compliance with each of the actions in the policy matrix. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts  \n\n79.   Power sector restructuring will have a significant positive impact on the sector, as well as \non  the  overall  economy.  With  the  large-scale  privatization  and  introduction  of  a  competitive \nelectricity market, the Government\u2019s role will be reduced to that of a policy maker and planner. \nFurther,  its  unsustainable  subsidies  to  the  power  sector  will  decline  to  levels  needed  for \nelectrification  of  unviable  rural  areas.  Thus,  a  major  fiscal  crisis  will  be  averted,  and  financial \nresources  will  be  freed  up  for  social  services  and  infrastructure.  Restoring  financial  viability  to \nthe  power  sector  is  essential  to  fiscal  consolidation,  and  will  be  a  key  to  attracting  new \ninvestments in the power sector.  \n \n80. \nThe proposed ADB loan will help to lower the financing costs of PSALM and contribute \nto  lowering  the  universal  charge.  When  compared  with  Government  bonds  issued  at  the \nprevailing market conditions, the annual interest savings are estimated to total about $5 million \na year during the 15-year loan tenure. \n \n81. \nThe removal of cross-subsidies that benefit residential consumers will ease the burden \non industries, thereby improving their international competitiveness. The TOU pricing will reduce \ndemand during peak hours, resulting in more efficient use of power facilities. After the initial pain \ncaused by the need to increase electricity tariffs to levels required for cost recovery, efficiency \ngains brought about by competition will lower these costs in the medium and long run. This will \nbenefit all consumers.  \n \n82. \nThe  lifeline  tariff  policy  (para.  64)  is  to  be  supplemented  by  programs  to  improve  and \nmake less costly the access of poor households, especially the rural poor, to electricity supply. \nSuch  programs  are  financed  through  the  universal  charge  component  of  the  tariff  to  provide \nelectrification for the poor. The Government has launched a major rural electrification program, \nwhich aims to electrify all barangays40 in the country by 2008 and 90% of households by 2017. \nAs  of  December  2005,  about  94%  of  the  barangays  in  the  country  had  access  to  electricity, \ncompared with 68% in 1998 when the power sector restructuring started. \n \n83. \nThough  the  Philippines\u2019  GDP  has  grown  steadily  in  recent  years,  the  growth  has  not \nbeen  pro-poor. 41  The  high  electricity  tariff  was  one  of  the  factors  that  constrained  poverty \nreduction. As electricity is an input to most economic processes, it is an important ingredient of \neconomic development that is essential for poverty reduction. Provision of electricity throughout \nthe  country  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the  main  tasks  of  the  Government\u2019s  Medium  Term \nDevelopment Plan (footnote 10). The proposed PSDP will assist in providing a reliable electricity \nsupply  to  satisfy  the  forecast  electricity  demand,  including  the  accelerated  rural  electrification \ninitiatives.  The  sustainable  power  supply  and  application  of  a  lifeline  rate  will  benefit  poor \nconsumers.  A  summary  of  the  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy  of  the  Program  is  in \nAppendix 9. \n  \nB. \n\nProgram Risks and Safeguards  \n\n84. \nADB has been advocating and supporting the Government\u2019s power sector restructuring \nprogram  since  it  approved  the  PSRP  in  1998.  While  the  Government  remains  committed  to \n\n                                                 \n40 A unit of administration consisting of 50\u2013100 families under a headman. \n41 ADB. 2005. Poverty in the Philippines: Income, Assets, and Access. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\npower sector reform, the delays in the privatization program have cast doubt on the relevance of \nthe  power  sector  restructuring.  A  policy  reversal  to  return  to  the  previous  vertically  integrated, \nGovernment-owned  monopoly  is  a  major  political  risk.  Such  a  move  would  exacerbate  the \nfinancial difficulties of the power sector and discourage the private participation that is needed to \nensure  long-term  sustainability  of  the  sector.  The  PSDP  will  provide  essential  support  to  the \nGovernment  to  ensure  that  the  reform  program  is  on  track.  Private  investors  have  perceived \nADB\u2019s  continued  support  as  an  important  factor  for  the  successful  completion  of  the  power \nsector  reform.  Therefore,  with  the  privatization  program  at  a  critical  juncture,  the  proposed \nPSDP  will  contribute  to  building  much-needed  confidence  among  private  investors.  Without \nsuch  strong  support  from  ADB,  the  momentum  developed  towards  achieving  the  objectives  of \nthe power sector reform is unlikely to be sustained. \n \nPSALM  continues  to  be  exposed  to  significant  financial  risks  that  could  threaten  the \n85. \nentity\u2019s viability at any time, and undermine the Government\u2019s financial condition. As shown in \nAppendix 7, even under the most optimistic scenarios, significant Government intervention and \nsupport  is  required  to  restore  the  financial  viability  of  the  power  sector.  A  delay  in  the \nintroduction  of  the  universal  charge  for  stranded  liabilities  will  mean  an  additional  burden  of \nabout  $3.2  billion  on  the  Government\u2019s  finances  between  2008  and  2010.  The  Government \nagreed  to  improve  PSALM\u2019s  cash  generation,  including  the  timely  introduction  of  a  universal \ncharge for stranded liabilities. Under subprogram 2, ADB may consider a PCG to help PSALM \nimplement debt restructuring options to address the cash flow mismatch over the succeeding 5 \nyears. \n \n86. \nThe power sector restructuring has been underway in the Philippines for five years since \nthe promulgation of EPIRA. During this period, capacity and technical skills of the Government \nagencies  concerned  have  been  strengthened  considerably.  Nevertheless,  to  avoid  design \nweaknesses  and  implementation  delays,  lessons  from  the  PSRP  have  been  incorporated. \nFurther,  extensive  consultations  have  been  held  with  the  Government  and  its  agencies; \ndevelopment partners, such as JBIC, US Agency for International Development, and the World \nBank;  potential  private  investors;  and  other  stakeholders.  Target  dates  are  set  only  for \nsubprogram  1  to  allow  flexibility  in  the  overall  implementation  schedule.  The  program  cluster \napproach  also  provides  flexibility  in  design.  As  subprogram  1  approaches  completion,  its \naccomplishments  will  be  reviewed.  The  results  will  help  define  the  scope  and  schedule  of \nsubprogram 2.  \n \n87. \nTo  persuade  investors  and  lenders  and  other  political  risk  insurers  to  finance  energy \nprojects in the Philippines, the proposed PSDP will be used as an anchor to offer investors (to \ncover subordinated debt, for example), as well as foreign and domestic commercial lenders (to \nthe  extent  required),  long-term  PRGs  covering  the  risks  of  (i)  inconvertibility;  (ii)  political \nviolence; (iii) expropriation; and, when appropriate, (iv) breach of contract. 42  ADB's PRG would \nprovide investors and lenders the comfort that the Government stands behind its obligations and \ncommitments. Specifically, the Government recently advised ADB that some interested bidders \nfor the TransCo concession might require a PRG to facilitate the financing of their acquisition. \nTo  allay  investors'  concerns,  the  Government  has  asked  ADB  and  World  Bank  to  prepare  a \nletter of interest about the availability of their respective PRGs. If a bidder requires a PRG from \nADB for TransCo, a separate Report and Recommendation of the President will be prepared for \n\n                                                 \n42 The Proposed PSDP will satisfy the participation requirement for credit enhancements, including guarantees, that \nmay be considered to support private participation in power generation and transmission.

As part of its streamlining \nefforts  to  address  the  critical  issues  facing  the  power  sector,  DOE  established  the  Electric \nPower  Industry  Management  Bureau  (EPIMB)  to  take  responsibility  for  matters  relating  to  the \npower industry.  One of  EPIMB\u2019s functions is the preparation of an annual power development \nplan.  However,  with  the  extent  of  power  sector  deregulation  envisaged  under  Electric  Power \nIndustry Reform Act (EPIRA), the influence of the plan on the development of the power sector \nmight  be  limited  to  the  provision  of  a  guide.  EPIMB  is  directly  involved  in  other  activities, \nincluding (i)  establishment of the wholesale electricity spot market (WESM) in collaboration with \nother industry participants, and particularly the appointment of an independent market operator \nto manage the bulk power trade market; (ii) promotion of rural electrification, and coordination of \nthe  Government\u2019s  expanded  rural  electrification  program  that  aims  to  provide  electricity  to  all \nbarangays 1  in  the  country;  (iii)  administration  of  policies  promoting  the  use  of  electricity \ngenerated from renewable sources; and (iv) administration of the host community fund.   \n \n\n2. \n\nPower Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM) \n\n2. \nPSALM  has  been  established  as  a  Government  corporation  to  implement  EPIRA\u2019s \nrestructuring and privatization mandate. To this end, PSALM has been (i) mobilizing resources \nto cover National Power Corporation (NPC)\u2019s stranded debt and stranded contract costs, which \narise  due  to  the  underutilization  of  certain  generation  assets  as  a  result  of  a  slower-than-\nexpected  growth  of  electricity  demand  in  the  recent  past;  (ii)  reviewing  and  renegotiating \nindependent  power  producer  (IPP)  contracts  to  obtain  more  favorable  terms  for  users  of  IPP-\ngenerated electricity; (iii) developing and implementing a privatization plan for the sale of NPC\u2019s \ngeneration assets and other properties, and the transfer of NPC\u2019s transmission operations to a \nprivate  sector  concessionaire;  (iv)  developing  a  plan  for  the  assumption  of  relevant  National \nElectrification Administration (NEA) long-term loan liabilities following the condonation of electric \ncooperative  (EC)  loans  in  accordance  with  EPIRA  (Section  60);  and  (v)  negotiating  transition \nsupply contracts (TSC) with distribution utilities (DUs) for the sale of electricity from NPC-owned \npower generation sources. \n \n3. \nPSALM\u2019s  major  sources  of  finance  include  (i)  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  NPC\u2019s \ngeneration  facilities,  as  well  as  generation  revenue  until  such  a  sale;  (ii)  revenue  from  the \ntransmission  grid  concessionaire;  (iii)  Government\u2019s  partial  assumption  of  debt  liabilities;2 and \n(iv)  revenue  from  the  stranded  debt  and  stranded  contract  cost  portion  of  the  common \n(universal) charge levied on all electricity end users in accordance with EPIRA (Section 34[a]).3  \n \n\n3. \n\nWholesale Electricity Spot Market \n\n4. \nDOE established WESM in accordance with Section 30 of EPIRA. Under WESM, a day \nwill  be  divided  into  24  one-hour  trading  periods,  and  generators  will  bid  competitively  for  a \nposition  on  the  electricity  dispatch  generation  schedule  for  each  trading  period.  In  any  trading \nperiod,  generators  will  be  dispatched  in  the  order  of  their  bid  prices,  with  the  market-clearing \n                                                 \n1    A unit of administration consisting of 50\u2013100 families under a headman. \n2  Section 32 of EPIRA calls for the Government to assume directly up to P200 billion ($3.9 billion) of NPC\u2019s financial \nobligations. The Government had considered increasing the debt assumption to P500 billion, but eventually only \nthe P200 billion required by EPIRA was assumed.  \n\n3  Other revenue sources include proceeds from the sale of subtransmission assets to DUs, and generation revenue \nfrom the Agus and Pulangui hydropower stations in Mindanao, which will not be sold. These revenues are unlikely \nto materially affect PSALM\u2019s financial position. \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nprice  being  set  by  the  highest  bidder  to  be  dispatched.4 This  model  is  economically  efficient \nbecause competition for dispatch should ensure that at times of low electricity demand higher-\npriced generators are not dispatched. Thus, the price paid by customers purchasing electricity \nfrom  the  market  is  reduced.  As  demand  increases,  prices  should  rise  to  the  extent  that  it \nbecomes  economical  for  investors  to  build  new  generation  to  enter  the  market.  Since  new \ngeneration  faces  no  constraints  on  entry,  economic  theory  would  suggest  that  only  relatively \nefficient  new  generation  will  be  constructed.  A  relatively  less  efficient  new  entrant  would  risk \nbeing displaced by a more efficient entrant and, therefore, not being dispatched.  \n \n5. \nWESM  intends  that  all  generation,  except  small  plants  embedded  in  distribution \nsystems,  be  dispatched  through  the  market  based  on  bid  price.5 However,  a  financial  hedge \nmarket will operate in parallel with the WESM. Financial hedges are bilateral contracts between \nelectricity  generators  and  purchasers  for  a  fixed  price  and  quantity  of  electricity  in  a  given \ntrading period, and require the contracting parties to pay one another the difference between the \nmarket  clearing  price  and  the  hedged  contract  price  for  the  quantity  of  electricity  contracted.6 \nHedge contracts play an important role in the operation of the market, giving price certainty to \npurchasers and providing generators with a secure and predictable revenue stream. In a mature \nmarket,  hedge  contract  prices  will  be  similar  to  the  expected  market-clearing  price.  However, \nconsistent  with  Section  45(c)  of  EPIRA,  no  DU  is  allowed  to  hedge  more  than  90%  of  its \nelectricity requirements for the first 5 years of market operation. \n  \n\n4. \n\nSmall Power Utilities Group (SPUG) \n\n6. \nSPUG  is  a  separate  division  of  NPC,  which  supplies  electricity  to  ECs  and  local \ngovernments  operating  distribution  networks  that  are  not  connected  to  any  of  the  three  main \ngrids.  Its  power  plants  range  in  size  up  to  14  megawatt  (MW).  The  large  power  barges  use \nbunker  C  heavy  fuel  oil,  while  the  smaller  plants  generally  are  fueled  by  light  fuel  oil.7 SPUG \nalso owns and operates off-grid transmission systems in Palawan and Mindoro.8 In accordance \nwith  Section  47  of  EPIRA,  SPUG\u2019s  assets  are  exempt  from  the  privatization  process. \nNevertheless, the DOE and NPC initiated a program aimed at luring private sector players into \nthe  business  of  missionary  electrification.  Through  a  DOE  circular,  which  became  effective  on \n12 February 2004,9 NPC-SPUG areas are to be grouped into waves based on the suitability of \nthe areas for supply by new private providers (NPP). The first wave groupings, consisting of 14 \nareas, were selected based on their respective peak demand levels. Through different options, \nsix  areas  have  begun  their  respective  processes  for  the  entry  of  NPPs.  Section  70  of  EPIRA \nrequires  that  missionary  electrification  be  funded  from  sales  of  electricity  in  missionary  areas \n\n                                                 \n4  This  is  strictly  true  only  if  the  generators  were  supplying  electricity  to  one  point  in  the  transmission  grid.  In \npractice, minimizing losses, ensuring that prudent power transfer capacities of transmission grid elements are not \nexceeded,  and  maintaining  adequate  network  security  are  necessary.  The  location  of  generation  on  the  grid, \ntherefore, is an important consideration. As a result, a more complicated dispatch model is used, and each grid \nnode  has  different  clearing  prices.  This  might  result  in  some  low  priced  generation  not  being  dispatched,  and \nbeing  displaced  by  more  expensive  generation  at  another  node.  However,  it  does  not  alter  the  fundamental \neconomic concepts on which the market design is based. \n\n5  Some generation, based on wind power for example, cannot bid into the market since generation output will vary \ncontinuously with prime mover input. Such generators are necessarily \u201cprice takers\u201d, and in any trading period will \nbe paid the market-clearing price for the node to which they are connected. \n\n6  Hedge contracts also are known as \u201ccontracts for differences\u201d because, if the market-clearing price is above the \nhedge price, the generator will pay the difference to the purchaser. The reverse will occur when the hedge price is \ngreater  than  the  market-clearing  price.  In  this  way,  the  physical  operation  of  the  system  or  the  market-clearing \nprice is not distorted by the bilateral contracts. \n\n7  The exception is Balongbong in Catanduanes province, which is a 1.8 MW hydropower station. \n8   Ongoing projects are in Masbate, Marinduque, and Catanduanes. \n9   DOE Circular No. 2004-01-001. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n45 \n\nand  from  the  missionary  electrification  component  of  the  universal  charge.  In  accordance  with \nthis provision, NPPs taking over from SPUG in  privatized supply areas also will be eligible for \nsubsidy funding from the universal charge. \n \n\n5. \n\nElectricity Cooperatives \n\nWhile  EPIRA  did  not  materially  alter  the  franchise  arrangements10 or  structure  of  the \n7. \ndistribution  sector,  it  introduced  some  changes  that  will  impact  the  way  these  utilities  operate. \nThe more significant changes include the (i) structural and functional unbundling of distribution \nbusiness  activities  and  rates,  which  means  that  generation,  transmission,  distribution,  and \nsupply costs will be shown separately on customer bills, and generation and transmission costs \nwill  be  treated  as  a  pass-through;  (ii)  introduction  of  open  access  and  retail  competition  on \ndistribution  wires;11 (iii)  provision  of  restrictions  on  the  sourcing  of  demand  requirements  from \nassociated firms (not more than 50%) and from bilateral contracts (DUs must purchase at least \n10%  of  their  requirements  from  WESM  for  the  first  5  years  after  its  establishment); 12  (iv) \ncondonation of the loans of ECs and the assumption of these loans by PSALM in exchange for \na reduction in the rates of the ECs by an amount commensurate to the resulting savings; and (v) \nremoval  of  cross  subsidiaries  within  a  grid,  and  between  grids  and/or  classes  of  customers, \nwithin  3  years  of  the  establishment  of  a  universal  charge  by  Energy  Regulatory  Commission \n(ERC).  \n \n8. \nECs  are  customer-owned,  nonprofit  organizations  without  a  capital  structure.  The \nfinancial  and  operational  position  of  the  119  ECs  vary.  In  2005,  77  ECs  generated  insufficient \nrevenues to cover their operating and debt service costs, while 48 were unable to cover even \ntheir operating costs. These figures are higher by 24% and 85%, respectively, than in 2004. In \naddition, 63 ECs reported power losses greater than 14%.13 Of these, 16 reported losses higher \nthan  20%.  Seventeen  ECs  were  in  arrears  to  NEA  on  loan  repayments,  and  42  had  overdue \naccounts with NPC for purchased power as of 30 June 2006.14 The NEA balance sheet shows \nP2.6 billion in outstanding EC loans as of 31 December 2004, down from P3.7 billion as of 31 \nDecember 2003 and from P15.4 billion as of 31 December 2002.15 The movement is primarily \ndue to PSALM\u2019s assumption, in accordance with EPIRA, of the ECs\u2019 loan obligations to NEA as \nof  June  2001.  In  2003  and  2004,  PSALM  assumed  almost  P18  billion  of  EC  loans  and  made \npayments  of  around  P3.6  billion  from  2003  to  2005.  NEA  uses  a  categorization  system  to \nmeasure  the  performance  of  ECs.  The  present  system  revised  in  2005  ranks  ECs  on  a  scale \nfrom A+ to E based on (i) loan repayment history, (ii) system loss levels, (iii) revenue collection \nefficiency, (iv) level of power purchase payment arrears, (v) level of non-power operating costs, \nand  (vi)  barangay  energization16.    Fifty-eight  and  13  ECs  were  rated  A+  and  A,  respectively, \nwhile nine and 10 ECs were rated D and E, respectively, based on these categories. \n\n                                                 \n10  Before the passage of EPIRA, the power to award distribution franchises was vested in the National Electrification \nCommission  operating  under  NEA.  Under  Section  27  of  the  EPIRA,  this  power  is  now  vested  in  Congress \nprovided  that  existing  franchises  must  continue  for  their  full  term  and  that  the  power  to  renew  and  cancel  the \nfranchises of ECs will remain with NEA for 5 years after the effectiveness of EPIRA. \n\n11  DUs have an exclusive right to supply electricity to customers connected to their network. Under open access and \nretail  competition,  electricity  supply  will  become  competitive  and  DUs  must  let  competing  electricity  suppliers \ntransport electricity over their network.  \n\n12  Many of the smaller DUs probably will not be able to meet the prudential requirements to allow them to trade in \nthe  market.  However,  Section  30  of  EPIRA  provides  that  NEA  may,  \u201cin  exchange  for  adequate  security  and  a \nguarantee fee\u201d, act as a guarantor for purchases of electricity in WESM by any EC or small DU. \n\n13  In accordance with RA No. 7832, 1994 (the Anti-Pilferage Act), ECs are subject to a loss cap of 14%. The cost of \n\nlosses above the cap is ignored when setting the rate, and cannot be recovered from customers. \n\n14   Excludes 8 ECs whose overdue accounts with NPC are being disputed. \n15   Additional lending in 2005 has since increased outstanding EC loans to NEA to P2.9 billion.   \n16   The inclusion of power reliability as an additional criterion for the ranking of ECs was deferred for 2006. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nAs  with  NPC,  NEA  had  experienced  severe  financial  stress  in  recent years.  In  2003,  it \n9. \nrecorded  a  net  operating  loss  of  P518  million,  up  from  P122  million  in  2002.  NEA\u2019s  2003 \nbalance sheet reported a deficit of P7 billion, with current assets of only P2.7 billion (including \nP1.3  billion  of  matured  loan  receivables  from  ECs),  compared  with  current  liabilities  of  P13.1 \nbillion.  The  balance  sheet  also  showed  some  P5.5  billion  in  long-term  loans  from  the \nGovernment. Some of these loan advances were made to ensure that NEA does not default on \nrepayment  of  its  foreign  debt,  which  amounted  to  P3.1  billion  as  of  31  December  2003.  Loan \ncondonation  will  mean  that  PSALM,  rather  than  the  ECs  will  be  responsible  for  making  most \noutstanding loan principal payments. However, interest payments for these loans will now be to \nthe sole account of NEA. In early 2004, NEA was reorganized and staffing levels rationalized to \naddress the financial problems and more effectively carry out its revised mandate under EPIRA. \nThe reduction in personnel expenses and the restructuring of some EC loans resulted in a 2004 \nnet  operating  income  of  P200  million,  a  marked  improvement  over  the  previous  year\u2019s \nperformance. Mostly due to higher Government subsidy, to cover NEA\u2019s interest expenses and \na decline in subsidies granted to ECs during the year, NEA reported a slightly positive bottom \nline in 2005.  \n \n10.  Manila Electric Company (Meralco) is the largest DU in the Philippines. As the recipient \nof an Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan,17 its performance is of particular interest. During the \nmid-1990s,  immediately  following  the  approval  of  ADB\u2019s  loan,  Meralco\u2019s  financial  performance \nwas  satisfactory.  However,  Meralco\u2019s  financial  position  has  deteriorated  in  recent  years  to  the \nextent that it has failed to meet ADB\u2019s required 8% rate on return base (RORB) since 1997. In \nfact,  Meralco  also  failed  to  meet  its  covenanted  self-financing  ratio  of  20%  in  2002.  Meralco \nposted a before-tax loss of P29.6 billion in 2002, before recovering slightly in 2003.18 However, \nan  adverse  Court  of  Appeals  ruling  on  Meralco\u2019s  unbundling  case  filed  with  the  ERC  required \nthe company to set aside provisions for probable losses of almost P10 billion in 2004, pushing \nMeralco back into the red for the year. Additional provisioning of P5.9 billion in 2005 meant that \nMeralco  reported  another  net  loss  for  that  year.  A  major  reason  for  this  deteriorating  financial \nperformance  has  been  the  lack  of  increases  in  Meralco\u2019s  distribution  rate  between  1994  and \n2003. Meralco\u2019s new tariff application under the performance based regulation is being reviewed \nby ERC. \n \n\n6. \n\nEnergy Regulatory Commission \n\n11. \nEPIRA established ERC as the industry\u2019s independent regulator, succeeding the Energy \nRegulatory  Board.  New  functions  and  responsibilities  have  been  introduced  by  the  law, \nincluding (i) developing and enforcing technical standards for transmission and distribution; (ii) \nenforcing  the  WESM  rules;  (iii)  licensing  generators  and  suppliers  of  electricity;19 (iii)  setting \nrates  for  non-contestable  sectors  of  the  industry;20 (iv)  determining  and  approving  the  level  of \nthe  universal  charge;  (v)  preventing  abuse  of  market  power,  and  anticompetitive  or \ndiscriminatory  behavior,  by  industry  participants;  and  (vi)  resolving  disputes  between  industry \nparticipants, or between industry participants and customers. \n \n\n                                                 \n17  ADB.1992.

Manila. \n\n18  This includes the extraordinary loss realized because of the Supreme Court refund decision. \n19 The  purpose  of  a  license  is  to  ensure  adherence  to  standards  rather  than  to  limit  the  number  of  participants.  \nConsistent with this philosophy, licenses in the generation sector are called certificates of compliance in EPIRA. \n20 Rates  for  generation  and  supply  currently  are  regulated.  Generation  rates  will  cease  to  be  regulated  after  the \ncommencement  of  WESM.  Upon  the  implementation  of  retail  competition,  the  retail  supply  rate  to  contestable \ncustomers will no longer be regulated. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n47 \n\nFollowing the passage of EPIRA, all utilities have been required to file a petition for the \n12. \napproval  of  unbundled  rates,  while  ECs  also  have  been  required  to  file  a  petition  for  rate \nreductions  due  to  the  condonation  of  NEA  loans.  In  the  unbundled  rate,  generation, \ntransmission, and universal charges are itemized separately on a customer bill. Any changes in \nthe unbundled components of generation, transmission, and universal charges are treated as a \npass  through,  although  ERC  approval  is  required  before  these  changes  can  be  reflected  in \ncustomer  bills.  Loan  condonation  applications  from  ECs  are  being  treated  separately.  Loan \ncondonation  applies  only  to  the  distribution  component  of  the  unbundled  rate.  The  petitions \nwere filed in accordance with Section 60 of EPIRA, which requires that a reduction of the rates \nof  ECs  commensurate  with  the  savings  due  to  loan  condonation.  The  processing  of  loan \ncondonation and rate unbundling petitions is now substantially complete. \n \nERC  has  examined  rate  unbundling  applications  using  2000  as  the  historic  test  year.  \n13. \nWhile rate unbundling is technically revenue neutral, the process used effectively has involved a \nreview  of  the  existing  costs.  As  a  result,  distribution  rates  have  been  revised. 21  ERC  first \nreplaced  the  previous  automatic  cost  adjustment  formulae  with  a  generation  rate  adjustment \nmechanism (GRAM) and an incremental currency rate adjustment (ICERA). However, ERC now \nhas introduced the automatic adjustment of generation rates and system loss rates (AGRA) to \nreplace  GRAM.  Under  GRAM  and  ICERA,  adjustments  needed  to  be  pre-approved  by  ERC \nbefore they could be included in customer bills. Under AGRA, the process has been changed to \nallow  adjustments  to  be  applied  by  the  regulated  entities,  subject  to  retrospective  approval  by \nERC.  \n \n14.  With  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  ADB, 22 the  ERC  promulgated  the  performance-\nbased  rate  (PBR)  methodology  for  the  transmission sector on  29  May  2003.  The PBR  regime \ndeparts from the traditional RORB methodology, which has been used in the Philippines for the \npast  80  years.  The  methodology  provides  that  a  revenue  cap  for  each  year  of  a  5-year \nregulatory  period  will  be  set  before  the  beginning  of  the  period, 23  and  that  under  normal \ncircumstances these caps will not be changed.24 The revenue caps will be based on a series of \nbuilding  blocks  that  include  (i)  operating  and  maintenance  expenditure;  (ii)  depreciation;  (iii)  a \nreturn  on  invested  capital,  including  system  assets  valued  using  the  depreciated  optimized \nreplacement cost method; (iv) a return on capital expenditure undertaken during the regulatory \nperiod; and (v) income and other taxes. The contribution of each building block to the revenue \nrequirement  in  a  particular  year  is  based  on  a  forecast  of  the  business\u2019  expenditure \nrequirements  over  the  regulatory  period.  The  scheme  includes  an  efficiency  incentive  that \nrewards  or  penalizes  an  operator  depending  on  the  difference  between  its  achieved  level  of \nnetwork  performance  and  preset  performance  targets.  It  also  has  an  efficiency  carryover \nmechanism,  whereby  the  benefits  achieved  by  reducing  costs  below  forecast  levels  can  be \nretained by the regulated entity for a 5-year period.  \n \nOn  5  January  2005,  the  ERC  issued  guidelines  for  a  new  methodology  for  setting \n15. \nwheeling rates for private DUs. This is a PBR methodology that is similar in most respects to the \nPBR methodology to be used for the transmission sector. The key difference for the distribution \nsector  is  that  the  methodology  will  be  used  to  determine  a  maximum  average  price,25 rather \n                                                 \n21 Some utilities have experienced rate reductions as a result of their unbundling applications. \n22 ADB.  2001.

Manila.  \n\n23 As envisaged, a regulatory period normally will last 5 years. \n24 The methodology has provisions for a review of the revenue caps in situations that are outside the control of the \n\nregulated entity and that would have a significant impact on the profitability of the regulated entity. \n\n25  The average price is determined by dividing the total amount billed for regulated services in a regulatory year by \n\ntotal energy delivered in that year. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nthan  a  maximum  allowed  revenue  as  in  the  transmission  business.  Hence,  under  this  rate-\nsetting mechanism, the revenue received by DUs can rise and fall with the volume of electricity \ndelivered,  whereas  the  maximum  allowed  revenue  determined  for  National  Transmission \nCorporation  is  independent  of  electricity  volumes.  A  less  significant  difference  is  that  the \nregulatory period for DUs is only 4 years. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nRecent Past \n(1998\u20132006) \n\u2022  NPC major contributor to consolidated \npublic sector deficit with PSALM long \nterm debt of about $7 billion (2005) \nand, as a legacy of the power crisis in \nthe 1990s, IPP lease obligations of \nabout $12 billion (2005) \n\n\u2022  High retail electricity tariff of about \n\n$0.13/kWh \n\n\u2022  Capacity oversupply (installed capacity \nof 12,000 MW vs peak demand of \n6,500 MW in Luzon in 2005)  \n\u2022  Slow pace of privatization of NPC \n\nassets.

In  2003,  the  World  Bank  approved \nRural  Power  Project  with  a  credit  line  of  $20  million  to  support \nthe  rural  electrification  projects.  The  International  Finance \nCorporation, as the Government-appointed transaction advisor, \nassists \nimplementing  private  sector \nparticipation \nin  areas  currently  serve  by  National  Power \nCorporation\u2019s Small Power Utilities Group. \nIn  2003,  GEF  provided  $10  million  for  the  Philippines  Electric \nCooperative System Loss Reduction Project. \nJBIC is providing financing for transmission systems particularly \nin  Visayas  and  Mindanao,  also  involved  in  supporting  private \ninvestors for power generation plants. \nJICA  is  providing  institutional  support  to  the  Department  of \nEnergy  for  the  preparation  of  the  Power  Sector  Development \nProgram \nforecast  methodology), \nTransmission  Development  Plan,  and  Missionary  Electrification \nDevelopment Plan. \nOPIC\u2019s substantial exposure to the sector is well diversified and \nall of its NPC risk is counter-guaranteed by the Government of \nthe  Philippines.

Specifically, \na major component of the current energy sector restructuring program in Philippines is to provide rural areas with \nelectricity access at affordable price to attain economic and social development. Lifeline rates will be provided to poor \nconsumers. With access to electricity, the poor will enjoy better education, entertainment, communication, health, \ncomfort, convenience, and productivity.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nAs electricity is an input to most economic processes, it is an important ingredient of economic development that is \nessential for poverty reduction. Provision of electricity throughout the country is one of the key tasks of the \nGovernment\u2019s Medium Term Development Strategy (2004\u20132012). The proposed Program will help provide an \nadequate and reliable electricity supply to satisfy the forecast electricity demand, including the accelerated rural \nelectrification initiatives. Although the impact on poverty reduction cannot be quantified, the lower power tariff and \napplication of lifeline rate will benefit poor consumers. The lifeline rate provides less expensive electricity for grid-\nconnected end-use customers with low electricity consumption. The subsidies provided by the lifeline rate schemes \nare extensive in the Philippines. For example, residential customers in the Meralco franchise area using less than 50 \nkWh per month get a discount of 50% on their electricity bill, and customers using from 51\u2013100 kWh per month get a \n20% discount. To fund these subsidies, all customers using more than 100 kWh per month pay an additional P0.0761 \nper kWh. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nD.
