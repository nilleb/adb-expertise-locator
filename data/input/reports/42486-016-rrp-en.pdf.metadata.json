Madhya  Pradesh  in  central  India  is  the \n3. \nsecond-largest state by area (308,000 square kilometers), fifth most populous (72 million), and \neighth most urbanized state in India. It is urbanizing at a faster pace (2.57% per year) than the \nnational average (2.45%), with the proportion of its urban population expected to increase from \n28%  in  2016  to  35%  by  2026.  Despite  its  improving  economy,  Madhya  Pradesh  still  has  a \n31.0%  poverty  rate,  and  an  urban  poverty  rate  (21.0%)  that  is  higher  than  India\u2019s  average  of \n13.7%.3 Increasing urbanization is putting more stress on urban infrastructure and  urban basic \nservices.  Many  urban  local  bodies  (ULBs)  or  local  municipal  boards  do  not  have  piped  water \nsupply,  and  only  a  fraction  have  wastewater  and  sanitation  systems.  A  service-level \nbenchmarking  assessment  conducted  for  110  sample  ULBs  by  the  Urban  Development  and \nHousing Department (UDHD) of Madhya Pradesh indicated an extremely uneven distribution of \nurban services, with small ULBs (nagar parishads or municipal boards) ranked at the bottom. \n \n4. \nA 2011 survey of 378 ULBs in Madhya Pradesh noted that less than 55% of households \nhave  access  to  piped  water  supply.4 About  60%  of  households  with  piped  water  connections \nhave  intermittent  water  supply  (from  30  minutes  to  2  hours  per  day),  and  the  rest  have  water \nonce every 2 days; some urban areas get drinking water even less frequently. Less than 2% of \npiped  water  supply  connections  are  metered,  and  less  than  45%  of  total  consumers  pay  for \nwater  supply.  Nonrevenue  water  is  high,  and  none  of  the  cities  or  towns  have  continuous \npressurized  water  supply  services,  leading  to  inefficiencies  and  potential  health  risks.5 A  2013 \nstudy  showed  the  importance  of  increasing  access  to  potable  water  supply  for  poverty \nreduction: poor drinking water quality has increased the disease burden, resulting in economic \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2014.

The  state  government  has  given  high  priority  to  urban \n5. \ninfrastructure  development.  Previous  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  urban  investments  in \nMadhya Pradesh have improved access to safe drinking water for more than 5 million residents \nin four major cities, and the World Bank is considering a loan to support water and wastewater \nservice  improvement  for  about  2  million  residents  in  18  secondary  cities.7 Learning  from  past \ncentral and state government-sponsored programs, Madhya Pradesh has committed to provide \nsustainable, inclusive, and quality urban services. Mission 8 of Madhya Pradesh\u2019s Vision 2018 \naims  to  provide  universal  water  supply  coverage  and  implement  reforms  to  improve  the \nefficiency  of  service  delivery  in  the  drinking  water  supply  sector. 8  To  improve  long-term \nsustainability  and  cost  recovery  for  urban services O&M,  the state government  has  set up the \nMadhya  Pradesh  Urban  Development  Company  Limited  (MPUDC)  to  manage  the  urban \nprojects. The MPUDC will create urban infrastructure assets and ensure the sustainable O&M of \nthe created assets. \n \n6. \nNeed for a sector improvement project. The state government has initiated programs \nto  improve  urban  services  in  250  of  the  378  ULBs  using  funds  from  its  own  resources,9 the \nGovernment of India (Swachh Bharat, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation \n[AMRUT],  and  Smart  City  initiative), 10 and  external  agencies.  The  state  government  sought \nADB\u2019s support to improve water supply in the remaining 128 ULBs, which had a population of \n2.7 million as of 2011 and have limited financial resources and technical capability. The project \ntakes  a  sector  approach  to  fund  64  of  these  128  towns  because  of  the  large  number  of \nsubprojects  and  to  ensure  an  integrated  focus  on  sector  policies  and  the  adequacy  of \ninstitutions  to  formulate  and  manage  such  plans.  The  government  has  a  sector  development \nplan  to  meet  the  priority  development  needs  of  the  urban  water  sector  and  is  undertaking \nreforms to build state and ULB capacity.11 \n \n7. \nThe  state  government  identified  64  towns\u2014with  a  reliable  water  resource,  sound \nengineering feasibility, available land, and a commitment to O&M\u2014for the project to support.12 \nThe state government plans to approach ADB for additional funding for the remaining 64 of the \n128  towns based  on  lessons  learned from  the  project  implementation. The sector  investments \nwill lead to increase in wastewater, which also needs to be addressed. The state government is \ncommitted  to  improving  wastewater  management  in  a  phased  manner.13 The  project  will  also \n\n                                                \n6  Oxford  Policy  Management  Asia  and  CRISIL.  2013.

Through  the  development  and  efficient  use  of  surface \nwater  sources,  the  project  will  preserve  groundwater  and  enhance  climate  resilience,  and \nprovide  near-universal  access  to  piped  water  supply  in  small  and  medium-sized  towns,  which \nhave a higher prevalence of poverty. It will benefit many households below the poverty line, and \nempower  women by  eliminating  drudgery  associated  with fetching  water from  distant  sources. \nBy  increasing  access  to  good-quality  water  with  enough  pressure,  the  project  will  help reduce \ninfant mortality and morbidity and the associated burdensome health expenditures. The project \nwill  introduce  and  implement  design\u2013build\u2013operate  (DBO)  contracts,  where  the  contractor  will \nhave  to  develop  not  only  high-quality  infrastructure  but  also  efficient  operations  of  the  assets \nthrough a long-term performance-based contract for ten years. This will give adequate time for \nULBs to build their capacity to operate assets after the end of the O&M contract period. \n \n9. \nThe project will provide continuous water supply with emphasis on 100% metered water \nconnections, efficient water supply zoning and nonrevenue water reduction, quality water supply, \nand  high  customer  satisfaction.  It  will  contribute  to  financial  sustainability  of  operations  by \nintroducing metering and volumetric tariff, improving efficiency via nonrevenue water reduction, \nimproving  customer  focus  and  service  delivery,  and  building  awareness  and  engaging  with \nstakeholders.  This  is  in  line  with  the  sustainability  lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  previous  water \nprojects.14 The project will strengthen the management capacity of ULBs and the MPUDC, and \nimprove  cost  recovery.  It  will  develop  and  implement  (i)  a  regulatory  framework  to  facilitate \nprivate  sector  participation  in  the  water  sector  over  the medium term,  and  (ii)  sanitation  safety \nplans  to  manage  the  septic  tanks  and  expand  decentralized  sewage  treatment  in  the  project \ntowns. \n \n10. \nThe project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for India (2017-2019); \nwill contribute to goal 6 of the Sustainable Development Goals; and is in line with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership  strategy,  2013\u20132017  for  India.15 The  project  is  consistent  with  the  state\u2019s  Twelfth \nFive-Year Plan, 2012\u2013201716 and ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan.17 \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe  impacts  of  the  project  will  be  (i)  improved  economic  growth  and  urban  living \nconditions, and (ii) reduced infant mortality in Madhya Pradesh. The outcome will be improved \nquality, coverage, efficiency, and sustainability of urban service delivery in Madhya Pradesh.18 \n \nC. \n \n12. \nOutput  1:  Water  supply  infrastructure  and  integrated  storm  water  and  sewage \ninfrastructure improved. This will include (i) constructing water supply facilities, using the DBO \nmodel, in 64 project towns (the facilities will comprise raw water intakes, water treatment plants, \n\nImpacts and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n14 Independent  Evaluation  Department.  2015.

Based on their location and size, subprojects \nin the project towns were grouped into 23 procurement packages to achieve economies of scale \nfor contract purposes. Surface water is the source in 60 towns. In the four towns that depend on \ngroundwater,  the  project  will  support  groundwater  recharge  and  its  sustainable  use.  Activities \nunder  this  output  will  focus  on  ensuring  vulnerable  households,  below  the  poverty  line \nhouseholds, and households headed by women have continuous water supply. \n \n13. \nOutput  2:  Systems  to  ensure  sustainable  urban  infrastructure  operations  and \nmanagement established. The project will support the state government and the ULBs, during \nproject  implementation  period,  in  establishing  and  maintaining  10  years  performance-based \nO&M  water  supply  contracts.  The  project  will  engage  operators  on  performance-based,  long-\nterm  O&M  contracts,  monitor  them,  and  support  an  independent  review  of  their  services. \nConstruction of the water supply facilities is estimated to take 2 years. After this is completed, \nthe  contractors  of  the  civil  works  packages  will  provide  continuous  water  supply  to  the  project \ntowns  for  10  years.  Of  the  10-year  O&M  contract  period,  ADB  will  finance  the  first  few  years \nprior  to  subproject  completion,  and  the  state  government  will  finance  the  remaining  O&M  cost \nfor  the  subsequent  years.  The  MPUDC  will  pay  O&M  costs  to  the  contractors  on  a  monthly \nbasis,  in  fixed  and  performance-linked  variable  fees,  following  the  contract  agreement.  The \ncontractors will ensure that (i) there is proper metering and volumetric billing, (ii) adequate water \npressure  is  maintained at  the  consumer  end  (7 meters),  and (iii)  supplied  water  complies with \nnational  quality  standards  for  drinking  water.  The  operators  will  establish  about  20  customer \nservice centers to serve the needs of all the project towns. The ULBs\u2019 obligations include setting \nand adjusting tariffs in a timely manner, collecting revenue, and managing defaulters to ensure \ncost recovery and handling financial management for timely payments to the contractors by the \nMPUDC.  During  the  O&M  period,  ULB  staff  will  be  trained  in  operating  the  assets.  After  the \ncontract is completed, the contractors will turn over the water supply assets to the ULBs. \n \n14. \nOutput  3:  Capacity  of  Madhya  Pradesh  Urban  Development  Company  and  urban \nlocal  bodies  improved. This will include  (i)  setting up a geographic information system-based \nasset  management  and  service  delivery  monitoring  system;  (ii)  developing  information \ntechnology  systems  in  15  ULBs  to  assist  in  day-to-day  management;  (iii)  improving  septage \nmanagement  in  the  project  towns  by  implementing  sanitation  safety  plans;  (iv)  building  the \ncapacity  of  the  MPUDC  and  project  town  ULBs  to  manage  the  DBO  contracts  and  the  assets \nafter  contract  completion;  and  (v)  raising  community  awareness  on  water  conservation, \nenvironmental protection, and hygiene practices in the project towns. \n \nD. \n \n15. \nproject administration manual (PAM).19 \n  \n16. \nThe  Government  of  India  has  requested  a  regular  loan  of  $275  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  the  project.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.15%  per  year;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan  and  project \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $399 million (Table 1).

The \n\ngovernment counterpart fund will fund O&M and incidental costs for the last 7 years of project implementation. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \nThe proposed TA will support capacity development of institutions in the urban sector of \n18. \nMadhya  Pradesh. 21 It  will  have  three  outputs:  (i)  septage  management  in  the  project  towns \nimproved by implementing sanitation safety plans; (ii) capacity of the MPUDC and ULBs in the \nproject  towns  developed  to  manage  the  DBO  contracts  and  to  manage  assets  after  contract \ncompletion;  and  (iii)  awareness-raising  activities  relating  to  water  preservation,  environmental \nprotection, and hygiene awareness conducted in the project towns. The TA is estimated to cost \n$1,000,000,  which  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special \nFund  (TASF-others).  The  state  government  will  provide  counterpart  staff,  office  space, \nworkshop venues, and other in-kind contributions. MPUDC will be the executing agency for the \nTA, which will be implemented over 3 years. \n \n\n                                                \n21 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f7 \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \nThe MPUDC has recruited qualified design consultants to undertake subproject surveys \n19. \nand  investigations  for  preparing  detailed  design  reports  that  include  evaluating  alternative \ntechno-economic options. A water resource review committee and a technical review committee \nhave  been  established to  review  surface  water  source sustainability  and  the  most  appropriate \ntechno-economic  solutions  considering  full  life-cycle  costs.  The  PMC  has  been  recruited  to \nvalidate the detailed engineering designs submitted by the DBO contractor. \n \n20. \nThe  project  includes  performance-based  DBO  contracts  with  a  10-year  O&M  period, \nwhich will improve construction quality and mitigate the ULBs\u2019 weak O&M capacity by providing \ncontinuity  in  system  operation.  The  PMC  will  monitor  the  construction  and  initial  operation \nservices to ensure low nonrevenue water and proper asset management. MPUDC will recruit an \nindependent  performance  monitoring  and  review  body  to  review  the  contractors\u2019  performance \nand  employers\u2019  obligations  over  the  operation  service  period.  The  cost  of  house  service \nconnections and asset replacement during operation services has been capitalized and included \nin  the  DBO  contracts.  With  state  government  support,  the  ULBs  are  obligated  with  periodical \ntariff  setting,  collection  for  O&M  cost  recovery,  and  providing  sufficient  funds  for  sustainable \nservice delivery and optimal maintenance of the assets created.  \n \nB. \n \nEconomic  analysis.  The  economic  analysis  was  conducted  for  the  two  sample towns \n21. \nfor which detailed designs were completed: water supply and drainage subprojects in Khajuraho \nand  water  supply  subproject  in  Sagar.  The  estimated  economic  internal  rates  of  return  for  the \ntwo  sample  towns  are  12.1%\u201313.3%,  higher  than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital \n(estimated at 12.0%), indicating sufficient economic return. The results of the sensitivity analysis \nare not satisfactory against (i) capital costs overrun by 20%, (ii) O&M costs overrun by 20%, (iii) \nbenefits  decrease  by  20%,  and (iv)  combined worst  scenario.  However, it  is  expected  that the \nproposed  subprojects  will  secure  economic  viability  even  in  those  cases  as  a  result  of  the \nunquantifiable benefits,  including  the  improvement  of  environment quality  and increase in land \nvalue, which are not reflected in the analysis.22 \n \n22. \nFinancial  analysis.  The  financial  internal  rates  of  return  for  the  project,  calculated  on \nthe  basis  of  income  from  water  and  sewerage  tariffs,  are  negative  since  the  water  tariffs  are \nexpected to recover partial O&M costs only. A cash flow analysis of ULBs, including revenues \nfrom property tax and institutionalized transfers from the state government, is more relevant and \nconfirms  that  project  cities  have  the  financial  capacity  to  sustain  infrastructure  and  deliver  the \nservices  upon  introduction  of  volumetric  tariff  in  FY2020.23 Sample  ULBs\u2019  financial  projections \ndemonstrate  that,  with  (i)  rationalizing  the  tariffs,  (ii)  improving  collection  efficiency,  (iii) \nrecovering arrears with adequate provisioning for bad  debts, (iv) computerizing operations and \nfinancial management, and (v) continued government support, the revenue account will remain \nin  surplus.  The  10-year  performance-based  O&M  contract  partly  funded  under  the  loan  and \nother reforms built into the project will help ULBs improve financial sustainability. \n \n\n                                                \n22 Economic Analysis and Subproject Cost and Benefit Flow Stream (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n23 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\ftransparency \n\nGovernance \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n \n23. \nA financial management assessment of the UDHD, MPUDC, and six sample ULBs show \nthat  the  overall  risk  is  substantial,  primarily  because  the  newly  established  MPUDC  needs  to \nquickly  become  operational  to  implement  the  project. 24  The  ULBs  are  small  and  have \ncomparatively  lower  capacity.  However,  a  number  of  key  staff  members  with  significant \nexperience  in  implementing  donor-funded  projects  from  the  existing  project  management  unit \n(PMU) at the UDHD were transferred to the MPUDC. A financial management action plan has \nbeen  prepared  to  guide  the  PMU  and  project  implementation  units  on  financial  management, \nwhich  includes  setting  up  financial  accounting,  reporting,  audit,  and  management  information \nsystems  in  the  MPUDC;  adopting  and  implementing  various  municipal  reforms;  and  providing \ntraining and capacity building support to all relevant staff. \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to,  and \ndiscussed  with  the  governments  of  India  and  Madhya  Pradesh,  and  the  UDHD.  The  specific \npolicy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM  (footnote  19). \nBased on the risk assessments, some of the mitigation measures in the project design aim to (i) \nestablish  a  mechanism  for  regular  voluntary  disclosure  of  project-related  information  to \nresidents,  (ii)  maintain  an  e-procurement  system  to  enhance \nin  project \nimplementation, and (iii) establish a grievance redress mechanism to ensure quick and effective \nresolution. \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  developing  infrastructure,  improving \n25. \nquality  of  life,  reducing  drudgery  of  women,  reducing  health  morbidity  and  related  health \nexpenditures, and stimulating economic growth. It will improve sanitation and drainage systems, \nespecially in low-income households and slums in Khajuraho and Rajnagar.25 \n \n26. \nGender.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  gender  action \nplan has clear targets, responsibilities, and resource allocation.26 Awareness raising campaigns \non  water  conservation,  environmental  protection,  and  hygiene  will  specifically  target  at  least \n50% participation from women and girls. Grievance redress committees will have at least 30% \nwomen  representatives.  Women  will  comprise  at  least  30%  of  the  participants  to  the  MPUDC \nand ULBs\u2019 capacity building training on DBO management. Women will comprise at least half of \nthe  400  people  benefiting  from  skills  training  on  water  supply  asset  management,  operations, \nand  management.  The  PMC  will  help  the  MPUDC  to  prepare  a  town-wise  action  plan  for \nimplementation. \n \nE. \n \n27. \nSocial safeguards. The project is classified category B for involuntary resettlement and \nfor indigenous peoples. Subprojects with significant involuntary resettlement and/or indigenous \npeoples  impacts  will  not  be  eligible  for  funding  under  the  project.  MPUDC  prepared  a \nresettlement framework and indigenous peoples planning framework following ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009)  and  applicable  laws.  MPUDC  prepared  a  draft  resettlement  plan  and \ndue diligence reports on involuntary resettlement impacts and impacts on indigenous peoples in \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n24 Financial Management Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nline  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  which  will  be  updated  after  detailed  designs.  The \ninvoluntary  resettlement  impacts  are  mostly  temporary  during  the  construction.  Indigenous \npeoples  or  scheduled  tribes  will  benefit  from  project  investments.  The  proposed  mitigation \nmeasures,  including  capacity  building  of  the  PMU  and  project  implementation  units,  are \nadequate  to  address  the  assessed  risks.  MPUDC  disclosed  the  safeguard  documents  on  the \ngovernment\u2019s  website,  and  will  share  relevant  information  with  the  affected  persons.  A \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  established  by  each  participating  ULB  and  disclosed  to \nthe project\u2019s beneficiaries and/or affected communities before civil work contracts are awarded. \nThe implementing agency will prepare a semiannual social safeguard monitoring report for ADB \nreview and disclosure.27 \n \n28. \nEnvironmental  safeguards.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  the  environment \nfollowing the Safeguard Policy Statement. MPUDC prepared an environmental assessment and \nreview framework in line with the Safeguard Policy Statement and applicable laws. Three initial \nenvironmental  examination  reports  prepared  for  sample  subprojects  in  Khajuraho,  Kothri, \nRajnagar,  and  Sagar  show  that  the  subprojects are  not  likely  to  cause  any  significant  adverse \nenvironmental impacts and that any impacts during construction and operation can be mitigated \nthrough  appropriate  design  and  good  practices.  Public  consultations  were  conducted  by \nMPUDC  for  the  selected  subprojects  during  preparation,  and  will  be  continued  throughout \nproject  implementation.  Environmental  grievances  will  be  handled  following  the  grievance \nredress  mechanism  developed  for  the  project.  The  implementing  agency  will  prepare  a \nsemiannual environmental monitoring report for ADB review and disclosure.28 \n \n29. \nDisasters  and  climate  change.  Climate  change  projections  indicate  a  temperature \nincrease of 2.6\u00ba C by 2050 in Madhya Pradesh.29 The key risk factors  are droughts, extremely \nlow  and  erratic  rainfall  leading  to  frequent  flooding,  and  seasonal  depletion  of  surface  water \nsources.  The  project  supports  the  efficient  use  of  surface  water  and  the  preservation  of \ngroundwater,  raising  awareness  of  climate  risks,  and  improvement  of  sewage  and  flood \ndrainage management to strengthen climate resilience. The project will incorporate appropriate \nmeasures for risks related to earthquakes, landslides, floods, and climate change.30 \n \nF. \n \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.31 The project loan\u2019s fiduciary risk is medium, \nand the state government has adequate public financial management systems to mitigate such \nrisks. The integrated project benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nLack of qualified contractors and \nchallenges in availability of \ncleared sites may lead to delays \nin project implementation, and \n\nMPUDC and ULBs have conducted several pre-bid meetings to explain the bid \ndocuments to the potential bidders.

Sufficient \nO&M funding is included in the project cost. \nRisk screening will be done to identify the type and intensity of climate risk the \nsubprojects will face. If risks are found to be relevant, adaptation or resilience \nmeasures to protect the investments from pre-identified risks will be incorporated \ninto the project design. The Water Resource Review Committee, comprising \nexperts from all water-related departments, is constituted to review and validate \nthe water source selection and intake location. \nMPUDC staff will include UDHD staff with strong understanding of financial \nregulations. MPUDC has committed to fill all sanctioned positions including a full-\ntime chartered accountant. External auditors have been appointed, and internal \nauditors will be appointed. Finance staff will be provided training in ADB financial \nreporting, disbursement, and procurement requirements under the project. \n\nAwareness campaigns for consumers and ULBs on improved service levels \nlinked to marginally higher tariffs will be conducted, and continuing policy \ndialogue for gradual and continuous volumetric tariff increases will be \nimplemented.  \n\nMPUDC  =  Madhya  Pradesh  Urban  Development  Company,  O&M  =  operation  and  maintenance,  UDHD  =  Urban \nDevelopment and Housing Department, ULB = urban local body. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n31. \nThe governments of India and Madhya Pradesh and the MPUDC have assured ADB that \nimplementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement and standard legal conditions, as described in the PAM and loan documents.
