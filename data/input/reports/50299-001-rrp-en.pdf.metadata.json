The report also describes proposed technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  the  Expressway  Operations  Improvement  Project  and  the  proposed \nadministration of TA to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Supporting Trade \nLogistics Facilitation, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the TA and the administration of the TA. \n \n2. \nThe  proposed  project  will  finance  the  construction  of  about  5.3  kilometers  (km)  of  an \nelevated toll highway with related facilities between the New Kelani Bridge (NKB) and Galle Face \nin central Colombo.1 It will provide a direct link to the city center and the port from the Colombo\u2013\nKatunayake Expressway (CKE) via the NKB, and extend the expressway network into the city.2 \nThe project will help alleviate traffic congestion in Colombo\u2019s densely populated areas, improve \nlast-mile  connectivity  between  the  country\u2019s  expressway  network  and  Colombo\u2019s  international \nport, provide better logistics services for freight operations, and facilitate regional trade. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nWith economic growth averaging 5.8% per year since 2009, Sri Lanka is close to attaining \nupper middle-income status.3 To serve the dynamic transformation of the economy, the transport \nsector is gradually changing to provide growth-oriented infrastructure, support more diversified \nservices, promote exports, and cater to the value-adding manufacturing industry. New economic \nactivities  continue  to  be  established  close  to  population  centers  and  international  gateways. \nColombo is the center of commercial and administrative functions and has the largest international \nport in the country. Western Province, which includes Colombo, contributes more than 40% to the \nnational gross domestic product. About 48.7% of Sri Lanka\u2019s urban population is in Colombo, a \ndistrict  with  a  population  of  2.3  million.  Improvement  of  traffic  conditions  in  an  area  with great \npotential  is  key  to  enabling  efficient  economic  activities.  The  project  also  follows  ADB\u2019s \ncomprehensive approach in facilitating trade logistics under the South Asia Subregional Economic \nCooperation. Improved connectivity to the port will facilitate the smooth flow of goods between \ndomestic, regional, and international markets to develop a high-value-added economy. \n \n4. \nRoad  subsector  overview  of  Colombo.  Sri  Lanka  has  a  moderately  developed  road \nnetwork.  Road  transport  accounts  for  93%  of  the  estimated  80  billion  passenger-kilometers  in \npassenger  traffic  and  97%  of freight traffic.4 The road  density,  defined  as ratio  of road  area  to \nadministrative  area,  is  10.7%  in  the  Colombo  municipal  council,  which  is  better  than  in  other \ncongested Asian cities such as Bangkok (7.1%) or Jakarta (7.3%) but lower than in other major \ncities such as Tokyo (16.3%), Seoul (13.6%), and Shanghai (12.3%).5 The number of vehicles \ncoming to the city has increased to nearly 300,000 per day. Total person-trips are projected to \n\n                                                \n1  Along the route, a dedicated ramp to the port will be constructed for port-related traffic. \n2  Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). 2014.

Tokyo. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fincrease  2.3  times  from  2013  to  2035.6  The  road  network  needs  to  be  further  developed  to \naccommodate the increasing traffic demand.7 \n \n5. \nTraffic volume on major arterial roads is almost at capacity, which causes serious traffic \ncongestion throughout the city. The average traffic speed is less than 10 km per hour during peak \nhours  at  many  intersections  along  major  arterial  roads,  particularly  between  the  north\u2013south \nBaseline Road and radial roads. Constructing new roads or widening existing ones, however, has \nbecome almost economically and socially unviable because of the potentially large scale of land \nacquisition and resettlement requirements. The congestion hindering efficient economic activities \nis a growing economic and social concern in Colombo. Without further intervention in transport \nprojects  in  Colombo,  economic  loss  could  reach  about  3.5%  of  the  Western  Province\u2019s  gross \ndomestic product by 2020.8 \n \n6. \nExpansion  of  expressway  network.  The  Road  Development  Authority  (RDA)  has \nexpanded  its  expressway  network  since  it  opened  the  Southern  Expressway,  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  first \nexpressway, to traffic in 2011. The CKE has been in operation since 2013 and part of the Outer \nCircular  Highway  (OCH)  has  been  in  operation  since  2014.  The  RDA  will  connect  the  three \nexpressways once the rest of the OCH is completed. The planned central expressway leading to \nthe OCH will also be part of the network. Connecting the rest of the country with Colombo through \nthe expressways will be essential for the development of the whole economy. However, without \nan efficient urban road network system, it will create additional traffic in the Colombo metropolitan \narea. The NKB, funded and implemented by the Japan International Cooperation Agency, links \nthe CKE to the proposed elevated highway. The NKB is scheduled for completion in 2021 and is \nclassified as collaborative cofinancing with the project, since it is part of the same plan of road \ndevelopment. \n \n7. \nInsufficient logistics infrastructure to Colombo port. Colombo serves as the central \ntransport node between domestic and international logistics. At the northwestern edge of the city \nis Colombo port, Sri Lanka\u2019s main international port, which handled 5.7 million 20-foot equivalent \nunits (TEUs) of container cargo in 2016. During the same year, the port handled about 1.3 million \nTEUs destined for or originating from Sri Lanka (25% of total containers handled), and this could \ndouble  to  2.5  million  TEUs  in  2030  with  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  economic  growth.9  The  constrained  site \nlocation  forces  the  great  majority  of  freight  vehicles  exiting  and  entering  the  port  to  pass  only \nthrough the main gate on a four-lane, ground-level port access road.10 The existing port access \nroad leads to an intersection with Baseline Road, which is one of the busiest trunk roads in the \ncity.11 The cargo trucks, mostly through-traffic to and from areas outside Colombo city, have no \nchoice but to use the intersection, causing serious traffic congestion.12 The limited access route \nto the port, together with the national highway network radiating out from Colombo, creates the \nunnecessary concentration of through-traffic in the congested city. \n \n\n                                                \n6  Government  of  Sri  Lanka,  Ministry  of  Megapolis  and  Western  Development.  2016.

The volume is expected to exceed \n\n11 About 300 freight vehicles per hour use Main Gate No. 6 (both directions) on Baseline Road during the daytime. \n12 The traffic origin\u2013destination survey in Colombo port shows that less than 10% of the containers originated from and \n\nwere destined for the Colombo municipal council. \n\nPlan.

Sri Lanka\u2019s performance on \nindicators of trade facilitation is better than that of other countries in the region, but lags many \nSoutheast  Asian  economies.  Current  trade  logistics  procedures,  which  lack  a  modern  risk \nmanagement system and limit use of automated systems, lead to queuing of cargo traffic at the \nport and may hinder the elevated highway project from realizing the intended benefits (para. 25).13 \nIntegrating trade logistics facilitation with the road project will then reduce congestion not only on \nthe  surrounding  road  network  but  also  within  the  port,  addressing  the  key  physical  and \nnonphysical  barriers  identified  by  the  South  Asian  Association  for  Regional  Cooperation \nSecretariat  Regional  Multimodal  Transport  Study  for  Colombo  Port.14  The  project  will  (i) \nsignificantly  enhance  the  port\u2019s  capacity  for  expanding  distribution  services,  (ii)  provide  better \nservices to port users, and (iii) help develop Colombo port into a logistics hub.15 \n \nChallenges of traffic mobility in Colombo. Considering (i) the increasing traffic demand \n9. \nin a district with the most economic potential, (ii) further development of the expressway network, \nand (iii) the insufficient logistics infrastructure to the port, the transport sector faces the following \nmajor challenges: (i) alleviating the intensifying congestion in Colombo without large-scale land \nacquisition;  (ii)  efficiently  managing the  incoming  traffic  through  the  NKB from the  expressway \nnetwork, while minimizing the burden on the existing road network in Colombo; and (iii) handling \nthe increasing freight traffic for Colombo port without causing congestion in the surrounding area. \nThe project will address these challenges by constructing the elevated highway within the port \npremises, which will enable the project to be implemented without considerable negative social \nimpact.  Through  the  attached  TA  projects,  it  also  aims  to  enhance  institutional  capacity  for \nexpressway operation and to improve trade logistics efficiency. \n \nGovernment  development  strategy.  The government\u2019s  development  policy  statement \n10. \nhighlights  the  strategic  importance  of  Sri  Lanka  as  a  hub  for  global  logistics  and  commercial \noperations.16  The  government  also  emphasized  that  export  development  is  a  top  priority,  with \nmeasures  aimed  at  productivity  improvement,  trade  facilitation,  and  bilateral  economic \nintegration. The Public Investment Programme, 2017\u20132020 provides policy directions to facilitate \nthe country\u2019s economic growth by creating an efficient road network (footnote 4). Key strategies \nto achieve the policy are (i) providing efficient links between key economic centers and ports by \nextending the expressway network, and (ii) constructing an elevated road network to minimize \ntraffic  congestion  in the Colombo  metropolitan  area. The  project  is  identified  as a  priority  road \nproject in the Western Region Megapolis Master Plan (footnote 8). \n \n11. \nADB intervention. In line with the government\u2019s national strategy, the country partnership \nstrategy, 2018\u20132022 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) aims to address major constraints on \nSri  Lanka\u2019s  development  through  the  following  pillars:  (i)  strengthen  the  drivers  of  economic \ngrowth, and (ii) improve the quality of growth.17 The transport sector is one of the key areas where \nthe strategy will be implemented. For the first pillar, ADB places a high value on the provision of \ngrowth-oriented  infrastructure,  which  includes  regional  cooperation,  and  is  boosted  by  better \nconnectivity  to  Colombo  port.  Emphasis  is  also  given  to  institutional  capacity  strengthening  to \n\n                                                \n13 \n\nInspection  requirements  for  import  cargo  is  a  nonphysical  factor  that  worsens  heavy  traffic  at  the  intersections. \nDetails  are  in  Attached  Technical  Assistance  Report:  Supporting  Trade  Logistics  Facilitation;  and  Sector \nBackground: Industry and Trade (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n14  South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation Secretariat. 2006.

Support  for  improving \ncustoms  practices  is  in  line  with  the  operational  priorities  identified  under  the  South  Asia \nSubregional  Economic  Cooperation  Operational  Plan\u2019s  strategic  objective  of  enhancing  trade \nfacilitation.18 Improved trade logistics will strengthen competitiveness and thus also aligns with \nthe country partnership strategy\u2019s thematic priority of supporting private sector development. \n \n12. \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  The  project  involves  port-related  activities  and \nmultiagency  coordination,  including  with  customs,  and  requires  government  intervention.  ADB \nassistance  in  the  toll  road  and  its  linkage  with  the  NKB  will  add  value  by  strengthening  the \ninstitutional capacity of the RDA in the operation of the expressway network. As all expressways \nwill become interconnected, the current project-by-project basis of tolling operation needs to be \nchanged. Among the challenges the RDA could face is the need (i) to develop a fair, consistent, \nand accountable toll rate policy; and (ii) to introduce a technically unified modern toll collection \nsystem. The attached TA for the Expressway Operations Improvement Project will support the toll \npolicy formulation, which aligns with lessons learned from past ADB interventions.19 The project \ndesign  also  includes  an  advanced  technology  of  the  the  multi-lane  free  flow  electronic  toll \ncollection (ETC) with support from the loan and the attached TA to charge tolls without physical \ntollbooths. \n \n13. \nADB\u2019s strong ties with the implementing agencies for road, port, and regional cooperation \nwill enable an integrated and multidisciplinary approach to the project. The Employer\u2019s detailed \ndesign has been prepared by the RDA under the Transport Project Preparatory Facility, and the \nproject has been fully reviewed by ADB\u2019s TA for the National Port Master Plan to conform with \nfuture port development plans.20 The project requires coordination between the Sri Lanka Ports \nAuthority (SLPA) and the RDA for its location inside the port, where ADB has played a critical \nnodal role. Furthermore, ADB\u2019s comprehensive approach in facilitating trade logistics under the \nSouth Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation will enhance the value of the project. TA support \nfor efficient trade logistics through customs modernization will contribute to improved economic \nefficiency. The TA also supports an innovative technology of electronic cargo tracking system to \nmonitor real-time container movement. Leveraging information and communications technology, \ncustoms practices, and maritime operations will be further integrated with trade logistics. \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: economic growth and regional trade and \ncooperation of the country facilitated (footnote 4). The project will have the following outcome: \ntransport efficiency along the project road increased.21 \n \nC. \n \n15. \nOutput 1: Elevated toll highway and related infrastructure constructed, upgraded, \nand installed.

The expansion of the expressway network will require \na fair, consistent, and accountable toll policy, and a modern and unified collection system. The \ncurrent toll rate policy and toll collection system were developed on a project-by-project basis, \nresulting  in  differing  toll  rates  and  collection  systems  among  expressways.  The  TA  for  the \nExpressway Operations Improvement Project will assist in developing a new accountable toll rate \npolicy to address the long-term operational sustainability of the expressway network and support \na newly introduced ETC system by creating an enabling policy environment and strengthening \nthe RDA\u2019s information and communications technology capacity.28 \n \n25. \nCurrent trade logistics procedures may prevent the project from maximizing its economic \nand social benefits, particularly (i) the high inspection rate of about 80% for import goods, (ii) the \nlack  of  a  real-time  cargo  tracking  system,  and  (iii)  the  location  of  customs  inspection  facilities \ninside Colombo that create unnecessary traffic congestion. Without improving these procedures, \nintersections on trunk roads will continue to be heavily congested. The TA for Supporting Trade \nLogistics Facilitation will assist in (i) improving the risk management system of customs to reduce \nthe inspection rate, (ii) preparing a study for a new customs inspection facility, and (iii) preparing \nthe technical design and business case for using an electronic cargo tracking system.29 \n\n                                                \n28  Attached  Technical  Assistance:  Expressway  Operations  Improvement  Project  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\n29  Attached Technical Assistance: Supporting Trade Logistics Facilitation (accessible from the list of linked documents \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\nin Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fExpressway Operations Improvement Project. The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, \n26. \nof which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-6). The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace, and other in-kind contributions. The RDA will be the implementing agency for the TA, which \nwill be implemented from October 2018 to September 2023 with 50.5 person-months of consultant \ninputs  (10.0  international,  40.5  national).  The  project  team  will  recruit  a  consulting  firm  and \nindividual  consultants  following  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions. \n \n27. \nSupporting  Trade  Logistics  Facilitation.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,437,500,  of \nwhich $1,250,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. The \ngovernment  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  and \nother in-kind contributions. The Sri Lanka Customs Department will be the executing agency for \nthe  TA,  which  will  be  implemented  from  December  2018  to  November  2020  with  66  person-\nmonths  of  consultant  inputs  (24  international,  42  national).  The  project  team  will  recruit  a \nconsulting  firm  and  individual  consultants  following  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as \namended  from  time  to  time)  and  its  associated  project  administration  instructions  and/or  staff \ninstructions. \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n28. \nThe project team considered the alignment and elevated concrete box girder structure as \nthe best among the proposals it reviewed during project preparation in terms of land acquisition, \nthe  number  of affected SLPA facilities,  current and future  port  operation requirements,  climate \nresilience, and economic feasibility and sustainability. The Employer\u2019s detailed design has been \nprepared by the RDA under the Transport Project Preparatory Facility (footnote 20). The design \nconsiders future extensions to Marine Drive along the coastline and to Pettah to address future \ntraffic demand generated by ongoing urban developments. The RDA adopted a higher standard \nof vehicle loading for heavy cargo traffic. The RDA will secure a minimum vertical clearance of 10 \nmeters from the ground level for the port operation, which will also increase resilience to climate \nchange risks. \n \nB. \n \n29. \nEconomic analysis. The economic  analysis  of  the  project  follows  ADB  guidelines  and \ncompares life cycle costs in with- and without-project scenarios, using a 9.0% discount rate and \nthe economic internal rate of return decision criteria.30 The project will cater to traffic, including \ncargo trucks, destined for the port. Quantified benefits include savings in vehicle operation costs \nand travel time, as well as a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. The economic internal rate of \nreturn is estimated to be 14.0%.31 Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the project. \n \n30. \nFinancial analysis. The project is revenue generating as a toll road. The RDA conducted \na financial analysis on an incremental basis using the discounted cash flow method and calculated \nthe financial internal rate of return following ADB guidelines. Capital costs include the construction \nof the elevated highway and the toll collection system. Operation and maintenance (O&M) costs \ninclude routine and periodic maintenance as well as operational costs of the tollway. The financial \ninternal rate of return is 2.11%, which is above the estimated weighted average cost of capital of \n1.01%.  The  cash  flow  projections  indicate  that  the  project  will  generate sufficient  resources  to \nmeet its O&M costs. \n\n                                                \n30  ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n31  Excluding carbon dioxide emissions savings, the economic internal rate of return is 13.9%. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nC. \n \n31. \nPolicy,  legal,  and  institutional  capacity.  The  Ministry  of  Highways  and  Road \nDevelopment  (MOHRD)  and  the  Ministry  of  Ports  and  Shipping  (MOPS)  will  act  as  executing \nagencies.  They  will  formulate  the  policies  and  monitor  the  performance  of  the  road  and  port \nsubsectors. The RDA, the implementing agency for road facilities under  the road development \ncomponent, was established as a statutory authority with independent legal status through the \nRoad Development  Authority  Act,  1981.  The  SLPA,  the  implementing  agency for  port facilities \nunder  the  road  development  component,  was  established  as  a  statutory  authority  with \nindependent  legal  status  under  the  Sri  Lanka  Ports  Authority  Act,  1979.  The  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies  have  sufficient  capacity  and  experience  to  procure  civil  works  and \nequipment, select consultants, and administer contracts. Implementation of the advanced  ETC \nsystem  will  be  fully  supported  by  project  management  consultants.  The  RDA  has  adequate \ncapacity for the O&M of expressways. However, private sector participation will be brought into \nthe  operation  of  the  new  ETC  system,  through a  service  agreement,  to  improve  toll  operation \nefficiency.32  The  Sri  Lanka  Customs  Department  will  be  the  executing  agency  of  the  TA  for \nSupporting Trade Logistics Facilitation. \n \n32. \n Financial management. The RDA and the SLPA have prior and ongoing experience in \nimplementing  ADB-funded  projects.  Assessments  of  the  RDA  and  the  SLPA  found  that  the \nfinancial  management  risk  is  moderate,  mainly  because  of  staffing  and  internal  audit \narrangements. The RDA and the SLPA have project accounting and finance teams with suitably \nqualified  accountants. The implementing  agencies will  establish and maintain separate project \nrecords and accounts to identify the financing resources received and expenditures made for the \nproject, thus ensuring an adequate audit trail. The government\u2019s Auditor General\u2019s Department \nwill  audit  project  accounts  and  financial  statements  annually  following  international  auditing \nstandards. \n \n33. \nProcurement and anticorruption measures. The implementing agencies have shown \nsatisfactory  performance  in  procurement  under  ADB-funded  projects;  the  procurement  risk  is \nassessed as moderate. Procurement of works, equipment, and consulting services will follow the \nADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for \nADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The civil works contract for the elevated \nhighway  is  under  procurement;  concurrently,  the  RDA  is  recruiting  construction  supervision \nconsultants.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government and the executing and implementing agencies. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 24). \n \nD. \n \n34. \nPoverty and social. Colombo district has a population of 2.3 million and is home to 48.7% \nof Sri Lanka\u2019s urban population. The smooth flow of goods and people in the port area is a key \ncomponent to developing the country\u2019s high-value-added economy. Increased port efficiency will \nindirectly  benefit  those  living  in  Sri  Lanka  through  reduced  shipping  costs.  At  the  local  level, \nbeneficiaries  will  include  transport  providers  and  businesses  (including  locally  run  businesses) \nsupporting construction and port operations. \n \n35. \nGender  and  development.  The  design  of  the  maritime  facilitation  center  and  other \nphysical  infrastructure  will  include  gender-inclusive  features,  such  as  women\u2019s  washrooms  on \nevery  floor,  and  other  design  features  that  may  benefit  female  workers  or  help  raise  the \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n                                                \n32  The Expressway Operation Maintenance and Management Division of the RDA has operated and maintained 171 \n\nkm of expressways since 2011. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\npercentage of female workers in the SLPA. \n \n36. \nHealth and labor. The project team will make sure the contractor includes provisions for \npromoting awareness and preventing the spread of communicable diseases, including sexually \ntransmitted infections. The contractor will conduct semiannual awareness-building sessions for \nall  workers  in  a  form  and  language  understandable  to  them.  The  construction  supervision \nconsultants will monitor the sessions. The contractor will display awareness-raising materials in \nstrategic areas of the port. The civil works contractor will follow national core labor standards. \n \nE. \n \n37. \ncategories are as follows.33 \n \n38. \nEnvironment (category B). The project expects no significant irreversible environmental \nimpacts.  The  RDA  has  prepared  initial  environmental  examination  reports  for  the  highway \nconstruction  and  the  maritime  facilitation  center.34  Anticipated  environmental  impacts  are \nrestricted  to  the  project  construction  stage  and entail  typical  issues  related  to  road  or  building \nconstruction such as generation of dust, noise, exhaust, and waste from construction sites; and \noccupational  health  and  safety.  The  most  sensitive  impact  expected  during  construction  is \npotential noise and vibration impacts on old historic buildings along the elevated road alignment. \nThe  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  which  forms  part  of  the  initial  environmental \nexamination,  incorporated  mitigation  measures  to  address  all  expected  impacts,  including \nstringent measures to control and monitor noise and vibration levels. The EMP will be included in \nthe  bidding  documents  and  implementation  by  the  contractor  is  mandatory.  The  RDA  held \nconsultations with stakeholders, such  as  local government  officials  and utility  agencies,  during \nproject preparation and will continue to hold them during project construction. A grievance redress \nmechanism will be in place to address the concerns of any individual or agency during project \nimplementation.  The  RDA\u2019s  Environment  and  Social  Safeguard  Division  will  monitor  overall \nmanagement and implementation of environmental safeguards under the project. The contractor \nand the construction supervision consultants will also include an environment specialist to ensure \nproper EMP implementation and monitoring. \n \n39. \nInvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (category C). For all project outputs \ninvolving civil works, thorough due diligence confirmed that the project will be implemented within \nthe existing secured port area and port-owned land. The government owns the project site, no \ntitleholders  or  non-titleholders  occupy  the  area,  and  no private  structures will  be  affected. The \nRDA held consultations with stakeholders during project preparation. Due diligence found that the \nproject  will  have  no  impact  on  livelihood  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  social  development \nspecialist of the project supervision consultant will perform annual monitoring to verify that there \nare  no  impacts  during  implementation  and  that  information  disclosure  and  consultation  are \ncontinued throughout the construction period. \n \nF. \n \n40. \nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.35 The integrated benefits and impacts \nare expected to outweigh the costs. \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n                                                \n33  ADB.

The  sections  will  be  handed  over  to  the \ncontractor  24  months  after  the  commencement  of  the  civil  works.  The \nRDA  will  consider  temporary  relocation  of  the  facilities  in  case  the \nrelocations cannot be achieved by the due date. \nSri Lanka ratified the WTO TFA on 31 May 2016.
