It will \nmake  provision  for  (i)  urban  roads  and  municipal  services  in  Baicheng  that  promote  people-\ncentered urban transport; (ii) the introduction of integrated solid waste management (ISWM) in \nboth  cities,  based  on  the  reduce,  reuse,  recycle  (3R)  principle  that  includes  composting \nsolutions;  and  (iii)  improvement  of  water  supply  services  in  Baishan,  emphasizing  water \nconservation, water supply safety, and energy efficiency.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  PRC\u2019s  National  New  Urbanization  Plan,  2014\u20132020  aims  to  increase  the \nurbanization  rate  from  the  current  54%  to  60%  by  2020  (representing  about  100  million  new \nurban  residents),  and  to  70%  by  2030  (equal  to  about  300  million  new  urban  residents). 3 \nUrbanization  is  perceived  as  a  means  to  sustain  economic  growth  through  domestic \nconsumption, 4  and  to  achieve  more  balanced  development  by  directing  the  future  urban \npopulation away  from  large  cities.5 The  strategy focuses on  the  development  of  medium-sized \ncities  (in  which  more  than  one-third  of  the  urban  population  lives)  as  an  important  means  of \nabsorbing future urban residents in a sustainable, inclusive, and efficient manner.6 These cities \nhave the potential to generate sufficient economies of scale to cluster local economic activities, \nwhile their proximity to the rural population supports rural and urban integration,7 and balances \nthe  development  of  industry  and  job  markets  nationally  and  in  each  province.  Although  they \nbenefit  from  some  advantages, 8  they  suffer  from  a  deficit  of  infrastructure  and  municipal \nservices,  resulting  in  environmental  pollution  and  constrained  economic  development.  The \ncapacity  of  medium-sized  cities  to  pilot,  implement,  and  replicate  efficient  urban  infrastructure \nand  municipal  service  delivery  best  practices  will  play  an  essential  role  in  the  quality  and \nlivability of the country\u2019s urban development. \n \n4. \nDevelopment  in  Jilin  Province  is  centered  in  the  cities  of  Changchun  and  Jilin,  and \nimprovements  barely  reach  the  remote,  less-developed  prefectures  in  the  southeast  and \nnorthwest,  where  Baishan  (480,000  residents)  and  Baicheng  (330,000  residents)  cities, \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2012.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People's  Republic  of  China  for  Preparing  the  Jilin  Urban  Services \n\nImprovement Development Project. Manila (TA 8172-PRC).  \n\n3  Staff Council of the PRC. 2014. National New Urbanization Plan, 2014\u20132020. Beijing. \n4  Domestic  consumption  accounted  for  36%  of  the  PRC\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  in  2011;  by  comparison,  it \naccounted  for  72%  in  the  United  States,  65%  in  the  United  Kingdom,  and  59%  in  India.  The  PRC\u2019s  domestic \nmarkets are perceived to have the potential to sustain economic growth even if the global economy stagnates. \n\n5  Most large or mega cities in the PRC face significant challenges relating to the environment and congestion (e.g., \n\nescalating housing prices, traffic gridlock, extensive air and water pollution, water scarcity, and overcrowding). \n\n6  A medium-sized city has a population of 0.2\u20131.0 million. \n7  On  15  November  2013,  the  decisions  by  the  Central  Committee  of  the  Communist  Party  of  China  indicated  that \nurbanization  and  reform  of  the  hukou  (household  registration)  system  should  focus  on  small-  and  medium-sized \ncities, while migration to the large and mega cities should be strictly controlled. \n\n8  Such as lower living costs, healthier environments, household registration system reforms, proximity to large rural \n\npopulations, and lower land costs. \n\n\frespectively, are located.9 The Jilin provincial government (JPG) has formulated a strategy that \nprioritizes  development  of  the  two  cities,  seeking  to  increase  economic  activity,  decrease  the \npoverty rates in their respective areas,10 and balance development within the province. \n \nCritical  infrastructure  gaps  that  prevent  sustainable  development  of  Baichang  and \n5. \nBaishan  cities  have  been  identified.  Residential  areas  in  western  Baicheng\u2014the  Baicheng \nEconomic Development Zone (BEDZ)\u2014have grown without proper access to central municipal \nservices.  An  estimated  25,000  residents  are  not  yet  connected  to  the  central  wastewater \ntreatment plant, and discharge wastewater into the surrounding environment or into unimproved \nseptic  tanks.  A  rational  road  network  is  absent  within  the  BEDZ  to  provide  adequate  urban \nservices  to  the  existing  population,  properly  connects  the  area  to  the  rest  of  Baicheng,  and \nfacilitate  the  development  of  mixed-function  areas  to  accommodate  future  residents  and \neconomic  activities.  The  city\u2019s  current  road  design  allows  little  room  for  promoting  public  and \nnonmotorized transport.  \n \n6. \nThe  current  daily  generation  of  municipal  solid  waste  (MSW)  is  420  wet  tons  per  day \n(t/d)  in  Baicheng  and  330  wet  t/d  in  Baishan.  In  Baicheng,  a  new  sanitary  landfill  is  under \nconstruction.  In  Baishan,  the  existing  landfill  is  being  rehabilitated  and  will  reach  its  maximum \ncapacity  in  3  years.  In  the  two  cities,  solid  waste  management  relies  on  \u201ctruck  and  dump\u201d \noperations, with little consideration for 3R principles, and limited disposal options. This results in \npollution and inefficient use of waste resources.  \n \n7. \nBaishan\u2019s  water  supply  has  reached  its  full  capacity  and  cannot  ensure  24-hour  water \nservices. Currently, 30% of the population (144,000 people) lacks full-time access to water. The \nrecent  decline  in  the  quality  and  quantity  of  the  main  water  source  (Dayangcha  River)  in \nJiangyuan  district  combined  with  the  growing  population  of  Hunjiang  district  are  putting \nBaishan\u2019s  water  supply  safety  at  significant  risk.  Previously  inadequate  technical  standards, \naging  pipes,  and  poor  water  supply  dispatching  efficiency  have  resulted  in  nonrevenue  water \n(NRW) in Baishan reaching 65%; this in turn has caused inefficient water use, loss of income, \nand excessive energy consumption. \n \n8. \nStrategic  fit. While addressing priority infrastructure gaps, the project aims to promote \nbest international practices and enhance investment proposals for long-term, resource-efficient, \nand  environmentally  compliant  solutions.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  ADB  country \npartnership  strategy  and  ADB\u2019s  urban  and  water  operational  plans,  2011\u20132020.11 It  is  also  in \nline  with  the  National  New  Urbanization  Plan,  2014\u20132020  and  the  government\u2019s  Twelfth  Five-\nYear  Plan  as  it  supports  (i)  balanced  urbanization  with  development  of  cities  that  are  livable, \nconserve  resources,  and  are  inclusive;  and  (ii)  the  sector  objective  of  improving  and  piloting \nbest  practices  with  respect  to  water,  solid  waste,  and  municipal  services.12 Finally,  the  project \ncontinues the long-term strategic partnership that ADB has built through multiple investments to \n\n                                                \n9  Baishan  City  population  is  projected  to  reach  700,000  by  2020.  Baicheng  City  population  is  projected  to  reach \n\n600,000 in 2020. \n\n10 The two cities and their surrounding rural areas have some of the highest poverty rates in the province. \n11 ADB.  2012.  Country  Partnership  Strategy:  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  2011\u20132015.  Manila;  ADB.  2013.  Urban \n\nOperational Plan, 2012\u20132020. Manila; and ADB. 2011. Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020. Manila. \n\n12 For example, the Twelfth Five-Year Plan direction for solid waste management indicates that classified collection, \ntransport, and treatment of organic waste in the cities at or above prefecture level should be promoted. Model cities \nfor  domestic  solid  waste  classification  should  focus  on  wet  and/or  dry  classification  of  household  garbage.  If \napplicable, organic waste will be collected separately and recycled. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fImpact and Outcome \n\ndecrease  urban  pollution  and  support more  balanced urban  development  in  Jilin Province,  the \nSonghua river basin, and the Yalu river basin.13 \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe impact will be improved economic growth, resource efficiency, and quality of life in \nBaicheng and Baishan cities. The outcome will be improved delivery and efficiency of municipal \nservices in Baicheng and Baishan cities. \n \nC. \n \n10. \nThe project has four components: (i) Baicheng municipal services; (ii) the Baishan ISWM \nsystem; (iii) Baishan water supply management; and (iv) capacity development and institutional \nstrengthening, divided into five outputs: \n\nOutputs \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nOutput  1:  Improved  urban  infrastructure  in  Baicheng.

Comprising (1) \nsupport for project implementation and management, institutional strengthening, \ncapacity  development,  and  training;  (2)  institutional  capacity  development \nsupport  for  water  management,  community-led  waste  sorting  and  recycling, \npeople-centered  urban  transport,  traffic  management  and  safety,  and  public-\nawareness campaigns; and (3) external resettlement monitoring. \n \n\n11. \nSpecial  features  and  value  addition.  The project will promote people-centered urban \ntransport  in  Baicheng.  The  provision  of  lanes  dedicated  to  buses  and  nonmotorized  traffic, \nsupported  by  a  capacity  development  program,  will  initiate  change  in  the  transport  planning \nsystem  and  promote  the  extension  of  low-carbon  transport.  The  project  will  also  introduce  a \nmore  systematic  and  efficient  use  of  public  buses.  It  will  implement  a  traffic  management  and \ncontrol  system,  traffic  safety  measures,  and  a  public-awareness  campaign  to  help  improve \ntraffic  safety  and  reduce  traffic  congestion.  The  project  will  also  pilot  curbside  stormwater \ncollection and local infiltration, which has the potential to significantly reduce water logging and \npollution.15  \n \n12. \nThe solid waste management systems in Baicheng and Baishan cities will be developed \ninto ISWM systems16 through a plan that defines step-by-step solutions for each type of waste. \nThe  project  will  pioneer  an  MSW  composting  program  in  a  medium-sized  city. 17 At-source \nsegregation  will  be  established  in  selected  communities 18  and  recycling  activities  will  be \nmaximized  by  providing  collection  points  for  materials  such  as  glass,  metal,  clothes,  and \nconstruction  waste.  Education  and  public  awareness  campaigns,  and  community-based  solid \nwaste  management  will  be  implemented  to  ensure  the  sustained  operation  and  impact  of  the \ninfrastructure improvements. \n \n13. \nThe  establishment  of  a  resource-efficient  and  safe  water supply  system  in Baishan  will \nbe achieved by supporting (i) reduction of NRW from 65% to 35%, by addressing water leakage, \nunbilled uses, and commercial losses; (ii) improvements in operations and energy efficiency by \naddressing engineering, automation and monitoring, and operation and maintenance (O&M); (iii) \nwater supply safety, through the implementation of a water safety plan based on water quality \nmonitoring and assurance systems;19 (iv) financial sustainability through tariff reform to achieve \nfull cost recovery; and (v) an education campaign to raise water conservation awareness. 20 \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $386.84  million  (Table  1),  of  which  44.3%  of  the  base \n14. \ncost  will  finance  civil  works,  16.5%  for  mechanical  and  equipment,  and  0.8%  for  consultants. \nThe government has requested a loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to \nhelp  finance  the  project.  The  loan  will  (i)  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5 \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n                                                \n15 Water  logging  refers  to  temporary  urban  flooding.  This  results  from  urban  drainage  system  overflows  caused  by \n\nincreased surface sealing in cities. \n\n16 ISWM  integrates  (i)  stakeholders;  (ii)  technical  elements  of  waste  reduction,  reuse  and  recycling,  collection,  and \n\ndisposal; and (iii) sociocultural, environmental, institutional, political, and legal issues. \n\n17 Currently, composting represents less than 5% of MSW treatment undertaken in the PRC, and is virtually unknown \n\nin medium-sized cities. \n\n18 Representing 20% of the population of the two cities.  \n19 Water  conservation  and  implementation  of  a  water  safety  plan  is  based  on  World  Health  Organization \nmethodology, and aims to avoid the limitations associated with relying on end-product testing as a means of water \nsafety control. \n\n20 A road map for sector improvement in each city is in Appendix 4 of the Project Administration Manual (accessible \n\nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fyears;  (ii)  use the  annuity  repayment  method,  with  a  10%  discount factor;  (iii)  have  an  annual \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility;  (iv)  have  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year;  and  (v)  have  such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based on this, the \naverage loan maturity is 18.31 years and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.20%. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n\nAmount ($ million)a \n\n  \n\nShare of Total (%) \n \n\nBase Costb \n1.

The  project  city  governments  will  assume  the  foreign \nexchange  and  interest  variation  risks  of  the  ADB  loan.  The  governments  assured  ADB  that \ncounterpart  funding  will  be  provided  in  a  timely  manner,  including  any  additional  counterpart \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\ffunding required for any shortfall of funds or cost overruns. The indicative flow of funds and the \nrelending and onlending arrangements are in the project administration manual (PAM).21 \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n17. \nJPG is the project executing agency. A project management office (PMO) for the project \nwas  established  under  the  Jilin  Housing  and  Urban\u2013Rural  Development  Department.  The \nproject  implementing  agencies are  the  Baicheng  and  Baishan municipal governments.  For the \nISWM  subcomponent,  the  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  is  Baishan  Solid  Waste  Disposal \nCompany  and  for  the  water  supply  subcomponent,  the  PIU  is  Baishan  Xibeicha  Qiyuan \nHydropower Corporation. The PIU for implementation of the Baicheng urban infrastructure and \nISWM  components  is  BEDZ  Investment  and  Development.  The  implementation  arrangements \nare summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM. \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nDecember 2014\u2013December 2018 \n31 December 2018 (estimated loan closing date: 30 June 2019) \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion \ndate \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n\n(iii)  Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iv)  Implementation \n\nunit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing \nand/or advance \ncontracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nThe Jilin PLG will provide policy guidance and project coordination. It will be chaired by the \ndirector  general  of  Jilin  Housing  and  Urban\u2013Rural  Development  Department,  and  will \ninclude senior officials from JDRC, JFB, JHUDD, BCMG, and BSMG (members). \nThe  Jilin  provincial  government  has  overall  responsibility  for  project  implementation, \nincluding  establishing  and  managing  the  project  imprest  account.  The  PMO,  established \nunder the JHUDD, will handle overall project coordination and management. \nBCMG  and  BSMG  will  be  the  implementing  agencies,  with  overall  responsibility  for \nimplementing  components,  including  the  provision  of  counterpart  funding  and  loan \nrepayment;  technical  and  procurement  activities;  monitoring,  supervision  and  evaluation; \nand  safeguard  compliance.  Two  sub-PMOs  will  be  established  to  manage  day-to-day \nactivities  and  provide  coordination  support  for  subproject  implementation:  Baicheng \nMunicipality  PMO,  headed  by  the  director  of  BEDZ  Investment  and  Development;  and \nBaishan Municipality PMO, headed by the director of the housing and construction bureau. \nThe three project implementation units are government-owned entities that will report to the \nrespective  municipal  government:  (i)  BEDZ  Investment  and  Development  will  report  to \nBCMG (12 staff proposed), (ii) Baishan Solid Waste Disposal will report to BSMG (49 staff \nproposed),  and  (iii)  Baishan  Xibeicha  Qiyuan  Hydropower  will  report  to  BSMG  (27  staff \nproposed).  The  PIUs  will  carry  out  day-to-day  implementation,  including  engineering \nsupervision and procurement of goods and civil works. \nInternational competitive bidding \nNational competitive bidding \nConsultants qualification selection \nQuality- and cost-based selection  \nAdvance  contracting  will  require  three  packages  (two  for  consulting  services  and  one  for \ngoods). Advance contracting and retroactive financing will require six civil works contracts. \nRetroactive financing will finance up to $30 million of eligible expenditures (20% of the ADB \nloan) incurred prior to loan effectiveness but not earlier than 12 months  prior to signing of \nthe loan agreement. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed upon \nbetween the government and ADB. \n\n20 contracts \n19 contracts \n1 contract \n174.5 person-months \n\n$131.8 million \n$95.4 million \n\n$0.15 million \n$2.85 million \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  BCMG  =  Baicheng  Municipal  Government,  BEDZ  =  Baicheng  Economic \nDevelopment Zone, BSMG = Baishan Municipal Government, JDRC = Jilin  Development and  Reform Commission, \nJFB  =  Jilin  Finance  Bureau,  JHUDD  =  Jilin  Housing  and  Urban\u2013Rural  Development  Department,  PLG  =  Project \nLeading Group, PMO = Project Management Office. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n                                                \n21 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \nTechnical  due  diligence  of  the  project  component  included  comparative  analyses; \n18. \nassessed  technical  specifications,  sustainability,  and  design  methods;  and  ensured  standards \ncomply with relevant PRC engineering guidelines and local regulations, as well as specific local \nconditions.  The  3R  principle  was  discussed  and  incorporated  in  the  MSW  management \nproposal  to  address  waste  reduction,  sorting-at-source,  recycling,  and  reuse  of  compost.  The \nwater supply component engineering design will facilitate O&M by optimizing energy efficiency, \nmonitoring,  and  control  systems;  and  reduce  NRW.  A  people-centered  transport  system  has \nbeen incorporated to promote nonmotorized transport, traffic safety, and public transportation. \n \nB. \n \n19. \nThe economic analysis evaluated the technical options, confirmed the economic viability \nof the project, and confirmed that the chosen engineering options are the least-cost options. The \ncost\u2013benefit  analysis  reveals  an  overall  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  16%,  and  overall \neconomic net present value of CNY553.9 million. The economic internal rate of return for each \ncomponent  is  computed  at  16.0%  for  improved  municipal  services  in  Baicheng,  15.1%  for \nBaishan  ISWM,  and  16.0%  for  Baishan  improved  water  supply  service;  each  exceeds  the \neconomic opportunity cost of capital of 12.0%. The sensitivity analysis shows that the project\u2019s \neconomic return is robust against negative impacts.22 \n \nThe  analysis  of  the  financial  viability  of  the  project\u2019s  cost-recovery  component  (i.e., \n20. \nimproved water supply management in Baishan) finds the financial internal rate of return to be \n5.82%,  which  compares  favorably  with  the  2.58%  weighted  average  cost  of  capital.  The \nfinancial  analysis  is  based  on  a  stepped  tariff  plan  that  aims  at  full  cost  recovery  in  the  long \nterm,  and  takes  the  form  of  an  increasing  block  tariff,  or  volumetric  tariffs. 23  Financial \nsustainability  analysis  indicates  that  the  proposed  project  components  entail  acceptable  fiscal \nrisk  regarding  the  ability  of  both  Baicheng  Municipal  Government  (BCMG)  and  Baishan \nMunicipal Government (BSMG) to provide counterpart funds for capital investment, financing of \nO&M costs, and to service project debts. \n \nC. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n21. \nwith JPG, BCMG, and BSMG. The financial management assessment concludes that, although \nthe  implementing  agencies  have  adequate  financial  management  capacity,  measures  will  be \nimplemented  to  strengthen  their  capacity  to  meet  the  project\u2019s  financial  management \nrequirements.  The  procurement  capacity  assessment  concludes  that  Jilin  provincial  PMO  has \nstrong experience managing ADB projects in accordance with ADB policies and procedures, as \nwell  as  national  laws  and  regulations.  The  implementing  agencies  and  PIUs  lack  experience \nwith ADB or foreign-funded projects. The implementing agencies and PIUs will work under the \nguidance of Jilin provincial PMO and will receive adequate knowledge and training support for \nprocurement from an experienced procurement agent, and through the project implementation. \nThe specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n22 The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  remained  above  12%  even  under  a  scenario  that  combined  a  (i)  10% \n\nreduction in project benefits, (ii) 10% cost overrun, and (iii) project implementation delay of 1 year. \n\n23 This is in line with water conservation guidances issued by the National Development and Reform Commission and \nthe Ministry of Housing and Urban\u2013Rural Development, which include water volumetric quotas, updated per region. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty and Social \n\nGender.  The  project  has  been  designed \n\n \nD. \n \n22. \nThe project will benefit directly  786,000 people, including 86,500 low-income residents. \nThe urban poverty rates of both cities are higher than the provincial average (12.5% in Baishan \nand  10.2%  in Baicheng,  versus  an  average of  6.0% for  the Jilin  Province).  Poor  infrastructure \nand  services  were  identified  as  critical  constraints  to  economic  and  social  development.  It  is \nestimated  that  a  total  of  more  than  22,600  person-months  of  construction  employment  will  be \ncreated  by  the  project; most jobs  will  be filled  by  local  people,  including  the  local  poor,  and  at \nleast 30% will be provided to women. The implementing agencies will ensure that all PRC labor \nlaws and core labor standards are followed. Details on specific measures to ensure the poverty \nand social benefits are in the social action plan included in the PAM. \n  \n23. \nSocial and gender action plans were prepared for the project to ensure the participation \nof communities in managing the cities\u2019 urban areas. Actions include (i) implementation of traffic \nsafety and water conservation-awareness programs; (ii) monitoring of public participation in the \npublic  hearing process for  water tariffs;  and  (iii) targets for  employment of  local  labor,  women, \nand  the  poor  during  construction  and  implementation.  In  addition,  the  creation  of  community-\nbased  waste  management  groups  and  outreach  to  schools  will  help  ensure  the  waste \nmanagement infrastructure improvement impacts are sustainable. Social and gender indicators \nwill  be  included  in  the  project  performance  management  system,  and  appropriate  consultant \ninputs  for  implementation  and  monitoring  of  both  plans  are  included  in  the  supervision \nconsultant package.24 \n \n\u201ceffective  gender \n24. \nmainstreaming.\u201d  A  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  was  prepared  to  enhance  women\u2019s  active  and \nequitable  participation  in  the  project  and  help  ensure  that  benefits  accrue  to  women.  Gender-\nspecific measures are included in the resettlement plans and a social action plan. The PMO will \nimplement the GAP measures, monitor impacts, and provide ADB with sex-disaggregated data \non employment and participation, as detailed in the GAP\u2019s monitoring section and other project \ndocuments.  GAP  implementation  will  (i)  increase  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  project  through \ntargets  that  specify  women  will  account  for  (a)  at  least  30%  of  people  employed  during \nconstruction, (b) 50% of participants in public consultations, and  (c) at least 30% of participants \nin  capacity  development  training;  and  (ii)  ensure  the  collection  of  sex-disaggregated  baseline \nand survey data, and establishment and monitoring of the GAP indicators. \n \nE. \n \n25. \nincluding \nenvironmental  management  plan  was  prepared  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009),  and  disclosed  to  potentially  affected  people.  Anticipated  environmental \nimpacts  during  construction  include  significant  earthworks,  waste  management,  soil  erosion, \nand health and safety risks around construction sites. These impacts are of a temporary nature \nand  are  covered  by  stringent  construction  site  management  and  procedural  provisions  in  the \nenvironmental  management  plan.  During  operation,  predicted  ambient  air  and  noise  quality \nalong  project  roads  and  at  solid  waste collection,  composting  and  disposal  facilities  are  within \npermitted  limits.  The  water  supply  system  in  Baishan  is  not  anticipated  to  affect  local  water \nresources  and  downstream  water  users. 25  JPG  will  be  responsible \nthe  overall \n                                                \n24 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Water  source  protection  measures  and  minimum  flow  requirements  are  specified  in  the  Xibeicha  reservoir \n\ninitial  environmental  examination, \n\n(category  B).

Environmental \nmanagement  is  supported  by  loan  assurances  and  capacity  development  and  institutional \nstrengthening  activities  under  the  project.  JPG  conducted  meaningful  consultations  with \npotentially affected people and project beneficiaries. Environmental complaints will be handled \nin accordance with the grievance redress mechanism developed for the project. \n \n26. \nThe  project  will  have  significant  environmental  benefits.  In  Baishan,  the  project  will \nimplement  a  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  system  to  improve  energy  efficiency.26 \nBaishan\u2019s  resilience  to  climate  variability  will  be  strengthened  by  reducing  NRW  (from  65%  to \n35%); by increasing the number of supply options and thus  water source redundancy; through \ndemand management (i.e., public awareness on water conservation); and through water supply \nsafety planning. In Baicheng, the project will promote low-carbon transport modes, and curbside \nstormwater  collection  and infiltration  will  be  piloted  along  selected roads  to  mitigate  the  risk  of \nwater logging. In the two cities, about 14,000 tons/year of kitchen waste will be converted into \nvaluable compost. In Baishan, the proposed sanitary landfill will include methane capture. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category A). The implementing agencies, with the support of \n27. \na local institute, prepared resettlement plans for (i) Baicheng urban infrastructure and integrated \nMSW  management,  (ii)  the  Baishan  water  supply,  and  (iii)  Baishan  MSW  management.  The \nproject  affects  10  villages  and  three  towns.  The  total  permanent  land  acquisition  is  2,425  mu, \nincluding  796  mu  of  state-owned  land  and  1,629  mu  of  collective  land. 27 Total  house  and \nbuilding  demolition  area  is  59,715  square  meters.  It  is  estimated  that  a  total  of  1,914  persons \nfrom  701  households  will  be  affected,  including  364  households  affected  only  by  land \nacquisition,  293  households  by  house  demolition,  and  44  households  by  both.  Three \nresettlement  plans  were  prepared  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and \nendorsed  by  the  Baicheng  and  Baishan  municipal  governments,  disclosed  to  the  affected \npersons, and uploaded on the ADB website on 25 May 2014. Compensation for lost assets and \nresettlement allowances will be paid to affected people. Livelihood rehabilitation arrangements \nin accordance with the resettlement plan will be made prior to the commencement of the related \ncivil  works.  The  executing  and  the  implementing  agencies  have  the  capacity  and  the \nresponsibility  for  planning,  implementing,  financing,  and  reporting  on  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  has  been  established.  An  external  resettlement \nand  social  monitor  will  be  engaged  to  conduct  semiannual  monitoring  and  evaluation  of \nresettlement  implementation.  The  Baicheng  and  Baishan  municipal  governments  have  stated \nthat the funds for involuntary resettlement will be available on time. \n \n28. \ngroups are living separately and no adverse impacts are expected. \n \nF. \n \n29. \nThe  project  has  no  unusual  technical  risks.
