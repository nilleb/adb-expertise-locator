RATIONALE: BACKGROUND, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Key Macroeconomic Considerations \n1.  Credit Background \n2.  Indonesia  underwent  considerable  risk  compression  in  late  2005  because  of  high \ninflation  and  consequent  high  interest  rates.  However,  these  rates  have  been  gradually \ndeclining through the first half of 2006. All in all, the underlying economy remains intact and \nwell-supported by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are estimated to account \nfor over 50% of gross domestic product (GDP) (with trading and agriculture dominant) and \nabout 10% of exports.  \n   \n3.  The country\u2019s credit risk profile balances improvements in public finances against the \nneed for further reduction in the country\u2019s external finances.1 Two structural changes are seen \nas affecting the economy in the near term. First, the non-oil and gas economy is gaining in \nimportance as Indonesia\u2019s oil and gas balance is now approximately neutral and higher oil \nprices no longer have a significantly positive effect on the economy. Second, stronger economic \ngrowth in Japan is beneficial to Indonesia, given the close trade and investment links between \nthe two countries. Indonesia is rated BB- by Fitch, Ba3 by Moody\u2019s2 and B+ by Standard & \nPoors (S&P). \n \n2.  Credit Outlook \n4.  The  credit  outlook  hinges  on  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  maintain  macroeconomic \nstability and monetary policy credibility, while implementing a demonstrated reform agenda \naimed at increasing the investment climate to attract more inflows. 3 \n \n5.  The rating agency Fitch expects GDP growth to remain at around 5.2% in 2006, below \nthe  government\u2019s  5.9%  forecast.  Economic  weakness  attributable  to  higher  inflationary \nexpectations and interest rates will probably last until third Quarter 2006. Rp stability remains \nthe lynchpin of the Indonesian economy given its close links to inflationary expectations, policy \ncredibility and the interest rate environment. \n \n                                                 \n1  Indonesia\u2019s fiscal deficit position was equivalent to 0.5% of GDP in 2005, well within the budgeted 0.9%. According \nto the rating agency Fitch, this is better than its \u2018BB\u2019 median of 3.2%. Fitch, 2006. Indonesia. \n2  Recent upgrade as at 24 May 2006 \n3  In addition, it will also be vital to increase competitiveness of exports. The reversal toward a current account deficit \nposition does not come at an opportune time when amortization payments falling due will be heavier over 2006\u2013\n2008 and the risks of portfolio securities outflow or further accumulation of external assets by domestic residents \nalso weigh on the balance of payments. ", "2   \n6.  The Government\u2019s ongoing commitment to strict fiscal discipline and the maintenance of \nprimary balances should, however, provide scope for the public debt burden to continue on its \ndownward path, albeit at a slower pace, given the weaker near-term economic outlook and the \nenvironment of generally high interest rates. It is forecast that the country\u2019s general Government \ndebt level will drop to 41% of GDP in 2006.4  \n \nB.  Finance Sector Overview in Indonesia  \n1.  Banking Sector and Retail Banking \n7.  The number of banks operating in Indonesia has been cut almost in half from the pre-\ncrisis level of 239 to 133 banks at the end of 2004. This is because of the closures and \nconsolidation that occurred during and after the Asian financial crisis.5 The generally successful \nrecapitalization and restructuring of the sector by the Government post-crisis, followed by a \nmore robust operating environment over 2003\u20132004, saw the industry\u2019s asset base restored to \nmuch stronger levels by the end of 2004. As a share of GDP, banking system loans continued \nto lag pre-crisis levels at 24% of GDP in 2004 versus 55% in 1996.6 \n \n8.  The retail banking market has expanded rapidly since the Asian financial crisis. From the \nend of 1999 to the end of September 2005, commercial banks\u2019 total lending to individuals grew \nby a compounded average growth rate (CAGR) of 44% and outpaced the 21% increase in \noverall banking system loans. Retail lending has grown to about 30% of banking system loans \nby September 2005 (10% in 1997). Forty\u2013five percent of individual lending is attributed to \npersonal  transportation  loans,  especially  for  motorcycles,  which  has  led  this  growth  (20% \nresidential mortgages, 10% credit cards, and 25% microcredits and other personal loans).7 \n \n2.  Nonbank Finance Sector  \n9.  The  nonbank  financial  institutions  comprise  multi-finance  companies  (more  typically \nreferred to as finance companies), insurers, and pension funds. As of September 2004, there \nwere 238 finance companies operating in Indonesia with total assets of Rp79 trillion, which was \nequivalent to 6.5% of the total asset base of the commercial banks. This is up from 3.5% in \n2000 reflecting the strong recovery in domestic consumption in recent years which has, in turn, \nfuelled demand for the financing of cars and motorcycles (considered an essential good for \nmost Indonesians). As a result, most finance companies have shifted their focus away from their \ntraditional business of leasing and factoring to consumer financing. \n \n10.  In the 4 years ending on 31 December 2004, loans extended by finance companies grew \nby a 17% CAGR led by a 43% CAGR in consumer financing. These are almost entirely for \nconsumer lending purposes, comprising mainly  motorcycle and automotive loans, and can \namount to 1\u20133 times the size of their on-balance sheet consumer receivables for the larger \nplayers in the industry (i.e., Astra Sedaya, Federal International Finance, Adira Finance and \nWahana Ottomitra Multiartha). Finance companies are prohibited from taking deposits (and \nraising funds from the retail public in general) and therefore depend on borrowings (mainly from \nthe banks) and the issuance of bonds for their funding needs.  \n                                                 \n4  Which is lower than the 46% \u201dBB\u201d median, according to Fitch, 2006. Indonesia. According to Fitch, the Government \nneeds to increase revenue from 19% of GDP towards the 25% median levels reported by its \u201cBB\u2019\u201d peers. \n5  The \u2018\u201dleaning-up\u201d continued in 2004 with three smaller banks having their licenses revoked because of solvency \nissues. \n6  For more details on the Indonesian banking sector, please refer to Appendix 1. \n7  For more details on the motorcycle financing market, please see below, chapter III.B. Please refer to Appendix 2 \nfor more details on the retail banking and consumer lending market in Indonesia. ", "      3\n \n11.  Existing and future growth opportunities have increased the need for these companies to \ntap other investor classes for the provision of debt capital and to explore ways of financing via \nfactoring, forfeiting, or securitization. \n \nC.  Securitization: Overview \n1.  The Global Scenario  \n12.  Securitization  has  emerged  as  one  of  the  dominant  means  of  capital  formation \nthroughout the world, particularly in the United States (US) and Europe. Each year trillions of \ndollars of securitization transactions are structured by a wide range of entities such as financial \ninstitutions, secondary mortgage companies, auto financiers, leasing companies, credit card \nissuers, infrastructure and insurance companies, governments, local authorities, and others. \n13.  Asset-backed  securitization  (ABS)  is  a  highly  structured  financing  technique  that \nprovides  an  entity  with  an  economical  means  of  financing  without  the  added  burden  of \nincreasing debt and/or equity. In its simplest form, securitization is a process whereby the \nrevenue  stream  of  a  segregated  pool  of  financial  assets  (receivables)  is  repackaged  into \ntradable securities issued to investors. The receivables are sold by the owner (the \u201coriginator\u201d) \nto a specially incorporated, off-balance sheet company or trust, known as a special-purpose \nvehicle (SPV). The SPV will pay, with funding received from the issue of securities, the (par or \nnet present) value of the receivables it has purchased with no recourse against the originator for \nnonperformance of the underlying debtors (except in the event of certain defects relating to the \nunderlying receivables and their sale and transfer).. \n14.  In developed markets, asset securitization serves a number of purposes: (i) supporting \npublic  policy  objectives  such  as  broad  home  ownership  and  the  development  of  financial \nmarkets  (especially  capital,  retail,  and  mortgage  markets);  (ii)  addressing  regulatory \nrequirements  for  financial  institutions,  especially  capital  adequacy  and  lending  limit \nrequirements  applicable  to  banks;  (iii)  transferring  risk,  especially  in  the  context  of  \nnonperforming assets, and portfolio diversification; and (iv) providing finance. \n2.  Securitization in Asia \n15.  Although securitization has gained wide acceptance in other parts of the world, it is still \nin its nascent stages in most of Asia. In the Republic of Korea, banks turned to securitization \nfollowing  a  stringent  period  of  bank  restructuring,  adding  an  extra  measure  of  liquidity. \nElsewhere in Asia, securitization is still not commonly being accessed. Regulations, prudential \nguidelines, and laws in most Asian markets are yet to be defined to promote or regulate \nsecuritization.  In  some  jurisdictions,  authorities  require  banks  to  obtain  the consent  of  the \nborrower before packaging and selling the loans. This stricture impedes the time-honored Asian \ntradition of close-knit, long-standing relationships between bankers and clients. Bankers worry \nthat informing the borrowers of a decision to securitize will imply that the borrower is regarded \n \nas a risk, and they are unwilling to convey that impression.However, there is a strong argument \nfavoring the growth of asset securitization in countries with developing capital markets as well \nas in the more mature ones. Many Asian countries are uniquely positioned to gain from the \nevolution of securitization in the region. \n16.  For Asian corporations, asset securitization provides a new and potentially cheaper form \nof financing. For loan originators such as banks and nonbank finance institutions, securitization \nis a means of removing assets from the balance sheet while retaining most of the economic \n ", "4   \nbenefits  associated  with  the  assets,  and  of  freeing  up  capital  to  support  further  loan \nunderwriting, while better matching assets and liabilities.  \n \n17.  For investors in Asia, including banks, unit trusts, and pension funds, the securities \nissued  offer  yields  exceeding  those  on  comparable  corporate  bonds  while  providing  an \nopportunity to diversify a fixed-income portfolio by adding another class of securities.  \n \n18.  Securitization is already proving to be an important option for governments seeking to \npromote private sector growth and access funding for infrastructure development. In addition, \nand because asset-backed and mortgage-backed deals are usually large and have high credit \nratings, the securities tend to be liquid and may be actively traded in secondary markets. This \npromotes capital market development and enhances the competitiveness of regional financial \ncenters. \n \nD.  Securitization and Capital Markets in Indonesia \n1.  Securitization in Indonesia \n19.  The securitization market was in its infancy before the Asian economic crisis of 1997. \nBefore the crisis, asset securitization was an attractive option for Indonesian commercial banks, \nburdened by a liquidity mismatch and struggling to clean up their balance sheets. PT Astra \nInternational completed a $200 million auto loan ABS in August 1996. The last completed deal \nwas a motorcycle ABS from finance company Putra Surya Multidana. The $144 million issue \nclosed in October 1997, exactly 1 day after the region's stock markets crashed.8  \n \n20.  The crisis has effectively halted new ABS transactions in the country. Currency and \ninterest-rate uncertainties made it difficult for swaps and insurance providers to price their \npremiums  and  made  these  providers  unwilling  to  render  service.  Similarly,  international \ninvestors were unwilling to invest fresh money as the risk was considered too high to justify the \nexpected returns.9 In addition, while the regulatory framework seeks to promote securitization, \nits cumbersome and unclear processes effectively hinder these transactions.  However, banks \nand other finance companies are expected to turn to securitization once again to improve capital \nadequacy ratios ahead of the implementation of Basel II. \n \n21.  Since the 1997 crisis, the first and only securitization transaction that closed was the \n$600 million cross-border future flow securitization for the major Indonesian energy group, PT \nBumi Resources, backed by coal exports generated by two of its subsidiaries, PT Kaltim Prima \nCoal and PT Arutmin Indonesia in June 2005.10 \n \n2.  Indonesian Bond Market \n \n22.  The bond market suffered greatly during the 1997 economic crisis. There were no new \nissuer listings in 1998. Meanwhile, the outstanding issuers encountered difficulties in paying \ninterest and principal at maturity of the bonds. In 1999, the bond market regained strength and \nachieved its peak growth in 2003. In that year, corporate bond activities, involving conventional \nbonds and Islamic bond offerings,11 picked up significantly. Total issues increased by 67.9% \n                                                 \n8 Davies,  Rob.  2005,  13  June.  Indonesian  Coal  ABS  Surprises.  Asset  Securitization  Report\u2014Source  Media. \nAvailable: http://www.securitization.net/article.asp?id=1&aid=4602. \n9 Harianto, Farid. The Mortgage-Backed Securities Market in Indonesia.  \n    Available: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Mortgage_Backed_Securities_Markets/3_indonesia.pdf.  \n10 However, their transaction was structured outside the existing securitization framework. \n11  Islamic bonds, based on Sharia principles, play a major role in the Indonesian capital market. ", "      5\nand the number of issuers increased by 34.0% over that of the previous year.12 The growth in \nthe bond market continued until mid-2005, as global and domestic interest rates dropped, and \ninvestors, mainly in Asia, jumped at the opportunities for higher yields in Indonesia.  \n \n23.  The  Surabaya  Stock  Exchange  is  the  primary  listing  agency  for  government  and \ncorporate bonds in Indonesia, with 103 corporate bond issuers and 243 of listed issues as of \nMay 2006. The number of listed issues has grown by more than 200% since 2002. This growth \nreflects  the  increasing  role  of  the  bond  market  as  an  alternative  means  of  financing  for \ncorporations. Total market cap of corporate bonds is about $6.5 billion, most of which are \nconcentrated in the banking and financial sector. 13  \n \n24.  The Government is the principal issuer in the bond market. Other issuers include local \nbanks,  mining,  oil  and  gas  firms,  and  state-owned  and  private  corporations.  Most  bond \npurchasers are long-term investors with no intention of reselling their bonds on the secondary \nmarket. Around 80% are domestic financial institutions. The rest are mutual funds, pension \nfunds,  foreign  financial  institutions,  insurance  companies,  and  individuals.  The  secondary \nmarket is thin, with no efficient mechanism for obtaining bid\u2013ask prices.  \n \n3.  Main Development Challenges Calling for the Development of Domestic \nBond Markets and Securitization \n25.  A vibrant capital market is crucial for economic development. The Asian financial crisis \nhas confirmed the need to develop the long-term domestic bond markets in the region. Despite \ngenerally high rates of savings, long-term savings have not been efficiently mobilized. Private \nsector investments in rapidly growing emerging economies have had to be financed with short-\nterm  foreign  borrowing.  To  avoid  the  risk  of  such  mismatches,  governments  in  ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) have been looking for ways to address this issue. \n \n26.  Underdeveloped bond markets narrow a country\u2019s choice in raising capital, leading them \nto rely heavily on the banking system. Banks, on the other hand, risk mismatches in their \nmaturity structures if they continue to provide long-term capital given their short-term liabilities. \nFor  lack  of  alternative  sources  of  domestic  long-term  capital,  firms  have  often  turned  to \ninternational wholesale credit markets, and have exposed themselves to exchange rate risks in \nthe payment of debt. The Asian financial crisis, however, has worsened those risks, and has \nreduced  the  flow  of  portfolio  lending  to  Asian  countries.  Little  long-term  capital  is  being \nmobilized in the region. Clearly, domestic bond markets have a crucial role to play, along with \ndomestic  equity  markets,  in  financing  investments  in  areas  critical  to  sustained  economic \ngrowth. Reforms in these markets are thus a key part of financial market reform in Asia in \ngeneral.  \n27.  In line with this rationale, and in order to develop an active and liquid debt market for \ngovernment and corporate bonds, the Government is applying strategic measures to improve \nthe  regulatory  framework,  corporate  governance,  trading  and  clearing  systems,  and  other \nnecessary market infrastructure, as it positions the public debt market to become a significant \nfinancing tool for domestic corporations, SMEs, and local governments.  \n \n28.  The creation of fixed-income bonds, from a pool of otherwise illiquid loans through a \nsecuritization  process,  will  help  spur  the  development  of  the  domestic  capital  market  in \nIndonesia.  At  present,  the  legal  framework  for  securitization  encourages  investment \n                                                 \n12 Bapepam. 2005. Indonesian Capital Market Master Plan 2005-2009. Jakarta. \n13  Surabaya Stock Exchange website, http://www.bes.co.id/market/stBond.asp. \n ", "6   \nopportunities and cross-border transactions. However, the process is very cumbersome and \ndifficult. Transactions are therefore usually structured outside the existing regulatory framework.  \n \n29.  Several factors call for the development of the securitization market: (i) the development \nof  the  bond  and  securitization  market,  in  particular,  would  reduce  the  problem  of  credit \ntightening  as  it  would  release  scarce  capital  of  the  Indonesian  banks  and  other  financial \ninstitutions  (FIs)  enabling  new  lending;  (ii)  given  the  increased  competitiveness  and \nconsolidation process in the financial and corporate sectors, securitization would allow banks \nand finance companies to increase their returns by redeploying the same equity. A financial \ninstitution can extend loans at market rates, and then securitize a pool at a lower rate because \nof diversification and the efficiencies inherent in tranching cash flows. With FIs becoming more \nconscious of the cost of capital and more aware of the need to diversify their sources of funding, \nsecuritization of loan portfolios would become a core tool of balance-sheet management; (iii) \nsecuritization would offer the FIs a new kind of intermediary role by redistributing credit risk in \nthe same way that an insurance provider pools individuals\u2019 exposures to loss or accident. Under \nthe  traditional  model,  banks  performed  this  by  matching  pools  of  borrowing  with  pools  of \ndeposits.  In  securitization,  they  package  credit  for  capital  markets  investors  rather  than \ndepositors.  \n \n30.  Securitization offers effective means of improving the capital adequacy of the banking \nand financial sectors, both of which are critical elements in improving the overall performance of \nthe Indonesian financial sector. The development of the securitization market will aid in the \ngrowth and development of the corporate bond market, in particular:  \n \n(i)  Credit rating culture. Based on international past precedents, an independent \ncredit rating system represents a key component to the development of a well-\nfunctioning  corporate  bond  market.  Only  when  investors  have  comfort  in  an \nindependent rating system will they be able to properly assess the true credit risk \nin corporate and other bonds.  \n(ii)  Credit  pricing  process.  Securitization  issuance  will  also  develop  the  credit \npricing curve. Securitization results directly in the sophistication, consistency, and \ntransparency of the credit pricing process.  \n(iii)  Increasing  number  of  institutional  investors.  With  the  growth  of  the \nsecuritization market, more institutional investors will come to Indonesia, serving \nto enhance competition and increase liquidity for the market as a whole. \n(iv)  Diversification for investors. Securitization issuance and the supply of a wide \nrange of new financial assets will enable institutional investors to better achieve \ntheir goals of creating stable, diversified asset portfolios that offer them a better \nchance of achieving their return and risk management objectives. \n \nE.  Project  Selection  and  Strategic  Approach  of  the  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment \n31.  In  line  with  the  revised  medium-term  strategy  (MTS  II),  ADB  aims  to  expand  its \ncofinancing operations, especially guarantee operations. One focus on such expansion is to \nprovide credit guarantees in support of capital markets, i.e., to guarantee the issue of securities, \nincluding corporate issues or asset-backed securities.  \n \n   \n ", "      7\nF.  Country and Sector Strategy \n32.  The  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  for  Indonesia  2003\u2013200514 calls  special \nattention to the need to foster a vibrant and competitive private sector and foresees not only \npublic sector operations but especially direct investments by PSOD to achieve this goal. One of \nthe main strategic target areas is \u201cto support the reform and development of a diversified and \nsound financial sector that can provide effective intermediation of savings through improved \nfinancial institutions and markets, including banks\u201d but also through the capital markets.  \n \n33.  The CSP is being updated. The initiating draft focuses on reviving the private sector in \nIndonesia as a key success factor for Indonesia\u2019s future to stimulate domestic and foreign \ninvestments. In particular, the much needed deepening of the financial sector is seen as a \nprerequisite for long-term development and is therefore one of the main strategic focus areas of \nthe new CSP. The banking sector plays a dominant role, accounting for over 82% of overall \nassets. Capital markets have grown in importance in recent years, but long-term debt issuance \nhas until recently been limited to government bonds. All in all, the capital markets play only a \nlimited role. This is why the CSP calls for an improvement of this situation. \n \n34.  It has been agreed that special attention will be paid to private sector operations, and \nthat ADB will strengthen its focus on Indonesia as a priority destination for direct investments in \nthe private sector. ADB will explore various opportunities in the financial sector with a special \nfocus on domestic capital market development and the development of a cross-border and \ndomestic securitizations market. As such, the proposed transaction is in line with the existing as \nwell as the anticipated new strategy for Indonesia. \n \n35.  ADB has been active in promoting the Asian Bond Market Initiative (ABMI),15 which was \nproposed by the Government of Japan in December 2002 and under which various efforts to \ndevelop bond markets have been underway within the framework of ASEAN+3 (Japan, the \nPRC,  and  Republic  of  Korea).  ADB  promotes  the  ABMI  inter  alia  through  the  use  of  its \nguarantee products. \n \nIII.  THE PROJECT SPONSOR AND MARKET BACKGROUND \nA.  Deutsche Bank AG \n36.  Deutsche Bank AG is the largest bank in Germany in terms of total assets, and one of \nthe most diversified financial institutions on a global level.16 As of 31 December 2004, the group \nprovided services to 56,434 corporate and investment bank clients, 3,722 institutional asset-\nmanagement clients, 13.3 million personal customers, 111,000 private banking clients, and 7.7 \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2002.

Currently, \ndiscussions are underway among the governments of ASEAN+3 countries on ways to develop and invigorate bond \nmarkets in Asian countries. \n16\n Business activities are categorized along three group divisions: (i) Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB): this \ndivision  is  focused  on  private  and  public  sector  clients,  SMEs,  in  addition  to  global  corporates.  Activities \nencompass capital markets, advisory, and lending; (ii) Private Clients and Asset Management (PCAM): the focus of \nthis division is on small businesses and private clients in Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, and Poland, in addition to \nglobally bound asset management activities conducted via its retail franchises in Europe (DWS Investments) and \nthe US (Scudder Investments). Tailored financing solutions are offered to high net worth clients of Deutsche Bank; \n(iii) Corporate Investments (CI): this division covers industrial shareholdings, other holdings and bank-occupied real \nestate assets, private equity, and venture capital activities.  \n \n ", "8   \nmillion retail asset-management customers. The group is actively present in 74 countries via a \nnetwork  of  1,559  branches,  respective  offices  and  subsidiaries.  Additional  distribution  is \nachieved via mobile advisors, Internet, telephone banking and third party distribution initiatives. \nAs at 31 March 2005, the bank employed 64,527 full-time staff. \n \n37.  Deutsche  Bank  AG\u2019s  operations  are  supported  by  a  reassuring  level  of  economic \ncapitalization and are steered by sophisticated and efficient risk management. The bank is \nexpected to continue to generate excess economic capital from recurring earnings. The current \nphase of Deutsche Bank AG\u2019s restructuring program is focused on ongoing cost control, risk \nmanagement, and enhanced revenue generation (through greater leveraging of its franchises) \nand should help to improve the bank\u2019s risk-return profile in domestic and global markets.  \n \n38.  Deutsche Bank AG reported an operating profit of \u20ac6.1 billion and a net income of \u20ac3.5 \nbillion for 2005, up by 52% and 47%, respectively, year-on-year and primarily reflecting good \nrevenue growth and moderate cost increases. Total assets stood at \u20ac992 billion, backed by \nequity of \u20ac29.9 billion and a solid tier-1 ratio of 8.7%. Deutsche Bank AG is rated Aa3 by \nMoody\u2019s and AA- by S&P and Fitch. \n \nB.  The Indonesian Motorcycle Industry \n39.  In  Indonesia,  motorcycles  are  a  major  alternative  mode  of  transportation  for  the \npopulace  as  it  is  often  more  efficient  and  economical  than  existing  public  transportation. \nHowever, Indonesia has a low motorcycle user ratio. Notably, there is only one motorcycle per \neight  to  nine  Indonesians,  compared  to  one  in  every  three  to  four Thais  and one  to  two \nTaiwanese.  \n \n40.  As proven by industrialized countries such as the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and \nvarious countries in Latin America (the development paths of which in turn follow that of Europe \nand even the US), the growth in the automobile population is strongly related to the country\u2019s \nper capita income. In the case of Indonesia, the Asian economic crisis resulted in a sharp drop \nin the country\u2019s purchasing power, with GDP per head falling 59% to $469 in 1998, which, in \nturn, led to a sharp decline in total motor sales. Motorcycle sales rebounded from 1998 to 2000 \nas the economy stabilized but remained flat in 2001. 2003 continued to see sales growth \ndespite the Iraq war, the SARS outbreak, and the military assault on the northern province of \nAceh. For perspective, from 2000 to 2004, the compounded annual growth rate totaled 13% for \nautomobiles and 45% for motorcycles, but in 2004 (because of easier credit access), the \nautomobile and motorcycle market showed an averaged growth of 37%, which was higher than \nthat of Malaysia and Thailand.  \n \n41.  There is considerable scope for further growth in the motorcycle industry because of the \nlarge population (in excess of 210 million), low levels of motorcycle ownership, increasing \naffluence, and rising credit availability. The above describe revived growth of motorcycle sales \nin the last two years is expected to continue, which should lead to a recovery to pre-crisis sales \nlevels  in  2006.  Please  refer  to  figure  Appendix  3  for  a  graphic  illustration  of  the  historic \nmotorcycle  sales  development  from  1995  to  2006.  Three  key  Japanese  brands  (Honda, \nYamaha, Suzuki) dominate the market with approximately 96% total market share.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "      9\n \nIV.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Overview, Outcome and Objectives \n42.  ADB will finance the acquisition by DB of two portfolios of motorcycle loans (Portfolio 1 \nand Portfolio 2, together the Portfolios) from the Company, based on predetermined Eligibility \nCriteria. The Portfolios were originated by the Company.  It is envisaged that ADB will (i) provide \na credit guarantee to DB with respect to principal and potentially interest to a second loss \nportion of the Portfolios (Guaranteed Portion) by way of a (partial) credit guarantee (Guarantee) \nor PCG; and (ii) finance by way of a funded participation (or other similar instrument) in an \namount of up to $200,000 (or its rupiah equivalent), the senior tranche (Senior Tranche) of the \nPortfolios acquired by DB. It is anticipated that (i) DB and the Company will retain a first loss \namount with respect to principal repayments of up to a certain percentage of the Portfolio; (ii) \nADB will guarantee amounts over the first loss amount up to a certain percentage, representing \nthe second loss amount on the Portfolios; and (iii) ADB will guarantee principal and potentially \nalso the interest portion of the Guaranteed Portion. The Company will act as servicer with \nrespect to the Portfolios.  \n \n43.  After an initial warehousing period, DB will securitize part of the Portfolios through the \nissuance of reference note to a group of investors.  \n \n \nB.  Portfolio Selection  \n44.  DB has selected and purchased from the Company Portfolio 1 in February 2006 and will \nselect and purchase a Portfolio 2 (together the Portfolios) from the Company once ADB has \nreceived all necessary approvals.  \n \n   \nV.  THE PROPOSED ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK FINANCING \nA.  Asian Development Bank Partial Credit Guarantee  \n45.  The ADB Guarantee will be a guarantee on the second loss portion of the Portfolios.  It \nis envisaged that losses will be calculated at the end of the maturity of the Guarantee, which \ncoincides with the maturity of the Portfolios. ADB will guarantee the principal, and may also \npartially cover interest. \n \nB.  Participation Agreement \n46.  ADB will make an anchor  investment of up to $100,000 (or its rupiah equivalent) in each \nof the Portfolios by way of a limited recourse funded Participation Agreement with DB, pursuant \nto  which  ADB  will  receive  a  pro  rata  interest  in  collections  of  the  Senior  Tranche  of  the \nPortfolios. \n \nC.  Main Terms and Conditions \n47.  The proposed ADB guarantee and limited recourse participation agreement will contain \nterms and conditions applicable to a transaction of this nature.  \n \n48.  The Guarantee Committee will determine the guarantee fee under the PCG and other \nfees involved in accordance with market rates and spreads available in the Project. \n \n ", "10  \n \nVI.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Justification of the Proposed ADB Assistance \n1.  Development Impact and Effectiveness \n \n49.  The proposed ADB funding will promote development at the following key levels: \n \n50.  Develop  the  Capital  Market.  The to-be-issued reference notes will be sold in the \nIndonesian domestic bond market. This will (i) have a demonstration effect with respect to \nmodern  capital  market  technology;  (ii)  increase  liquidity  in  the  domestic  market,  including \nattraction of foreign capital investment and creation of a secondary market for Indonesian loan \nassets; (iii) promote price discovery for this nascent and complex class of assets; and (iv) \nestablish pricing benchmarks for similar assets as well as term structures for other types of \nassets. The growth of the domestic bond markets will provide the much needed counterweight \nto the dominant banking market. \n \n51.  Fostering the Retail Lending Market in Indonesia. The sale of the Portfolios frees up \ncapital  of  the  Company  and  balances its debt-to-equity  ratio,  enabling  further lending  and \ngrowth. ADB\u2019s due diligence process and the design of the Eligibility Criteria provides know-how \ntransfer in terms of pool analysis and loan underwriting. \n \n52.  ADB will monitor and measure the development impact of the Project. Please refer to \nAppendix 4 for the development impact matrix. \n \n2.  Value Addition of the Asian Development Bank \n53.  Catalytic Role and Demonstration Effect. ADB\u2019s assistance in this transaction will \nserve to catalyze investors to the to-be-issued reference notes.  \n \n54.  Support to the Government. ADB\u2019s participation in this transaction will signal clear \nsupport to the Indonesian Government in its efforts to create a deeper and more developed \ncapital markets.  \n \n   \nB.  Risks and Safeguards \n55.  ADB has carried out thorough due diligence and is satisfied with the key legal and \ncommercial  parameters  of  the  investments.  Supporting  the  ADB-proposed  financing  are \nsatisfactory results from the portfolio sampling and extensive discussions with DB, the Company \nand local legal advisors, among others. Certain risks are involved but are acceptable for a \nfinancing of this kind. \n ", "      11\nC.  Safeguard Implementation \n \n56.  Environment.  This  is  a  category-FI  project.  However,  given  the  nature  of  this \ntransaction, an environmental management system is not required. \n \n57.  Social  Safeguards. This is a category-C project. No impact is expected regarding \ninvoluntary resettlement or indigenous peoples from the Project. \n \nD.  Anticorruption  Policy,  Combating  Money  Laundering,  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n58.  ADB  performed  compliance  due  diligence  on  the  Company  and  concluded  with \nsatisfaction that the Company\u2019s parent and sponsors are of good reputation, and that its senior \nmanagement  and  ground  staff  are  well  supervised  and  compliant  with  regards  to  internal \nmanagement policies. In addition, DB performed compliance due diligence and also concluded \nthat the Company was in compliance with the law on \u201cknow your customer\u201d (KYC) and anti-\nmoney-laundering matters.  \n \n \nVII.  ASSURANCE \n59.  A framework agreement relating to ADB\u2019s status, privileges, and immunities with respect \nto ADB\u2019s lending, guarantee, and equity operations in the private sector is in effect between the \nIndonesian  Government  and  ADB.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank, the Indonesian Government will be requested to confirm that it has no \nobjection to the proposed ADB financial assistance to DB. No funding will be disbursed until the \nno-objection letter is obtained. \n \n60.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  guarantee  agreements,  and  other  legally  required \ndocuments, following approval of the proposed financing by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors. These \nagreements will be on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. In addition, ADB will need to be \nsatisfied with all terms and conditions of the other principal documents associated with the \nproposed financial assistance. \n \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATIONS \n61.  I am satisfied that the proposed financing would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the following:  \n \n(i)  An investment in the Portfolios, by way of funded participation (or other similar \ninstrument) with Deutsche Bank AG, Jakarta branch, in an amount of up to \n$200,000 (or its rupiah equivalent), and \n \n \n \n(ii)  A partial credit guarantee of principal and interest in an amount of up to $9.8 \nmillion rupiah equivalent in favour of Deutsche Bank AG, Jakarta branch  \n \non terms and conditions described in this Report and Recommendation of the President \nand as may be reported to the Board. \n \n ", "12  \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n30 June 2006 ", "    Appendix 1  13\n   \nINDONESIAN BANKING SECTOR\u2014MAIN ISSUES \n \n1.  The less certain operating climate in the second half 2005, with higher oil prices, inflation \nand sharply higher interest rates (up 500bp), caused profitability to ease and loan quality to \nweaken among the Indonesian banks. This was greatly compounded by \u201ctechnical downgrades\u201d \narising from stricter nonperforming loan (NPL) classification requirements.  \n \n2.  The broader public sector risks posed by the tougher operating environment and rising \ninterest  rate  environment  for  banks  should  be  limited  by  the  introduction  of  stricter  NPL \nclassification requirements by Bank Indonesia (BI), as well as improvements in state bank \ngovernance and increased foreign ownership of banking system assets. \n \n3.  It is estimated that the sector\u2019s return on assets fell to 1.8% in the first 9 months of 2005 \nversus 2.6% in full-year 2004, although this was still a reasonably strong performance, even by \nregional standards. The gross NPL ratio doubled to 10% versus 2.6% in full-year 2004 \u2013 mainly \nowing  to  the  technical  downgrades,  as  mentioned  above,  although  there  was  also  some \ndeterioration in underlying loan quality, as reflected by the increase in special mention loans \nposted by a few banks.  \n \n4.  Although NPLs need to be closely monitored, given the higher interest rate environment, \nmitigating factors still exist in the form of low system leverage, diversified loan books, good core \nprofitability and the banks\u2019 generally quite strong capital positions.  \n \n5.  The sector\u2019s equity to assets ratio held steady at 10% as of end-September 2005 (Tier 1 \nCAR: 15%, Total CAR: 20.  \n \n6.  Indonesian banks continued to rebuild their loan books over 2005, albeit from a small \nbase (after huge, Asian-crisis-induced write-offs) with an emphasis on small-and medium sized \nenterprises (SME) and consumer lending. These now account for roughly 40% and 30% of \nloans, respectively, while corporate loans have fallen to some 30% from a pre-crisis share of \n60%-70%. \n \n \n ", "14  Appendix 2 \nINDONESIAN RETAIL BANKING MARKET \n \nA.  Overview1 \n1.  Indonesia\u2019s  retail  banking  market  has  expanded  rapidly  since  the  1997-1998  Asian \nfinancial crisis, fed by stronger economic growth and lower interest rates, increased confidence \nwith the improved political situation in the country, and the Indonesian banks\u2019 desire to rebuild \nand diversify their loan books following the massive corporate loan write-offs arising out of the \ncrisis.  Between  end-1999  and  end-September  2005  commercial  banks\u2019  total  lending  to \nindividuals grew by a compounded average growth rate (CAGR) of 44% and outpaced the 21% \nincrease in overall banking system loans. \n \n2.  However, growth emanated from a very small base, with central bank data suggesting \nlending to individuals stood at just 7%-8% of GDP share, reflecting the banks\u2019 historical lack of \nfocus on consumer loans and the quite small size of the Indonesian consumer market. Other \ninfluencing factors are the geographical diversity of the country and the prevalence of a large \nrural population base and the general inaccessibility of basic banking services for a sizeable \nportion  of  the  population.  It  also  reflects  low  income  levels  and  limited  borrowing  ability: \nmortgage loans account for only 20% of consumer lending; almost half is for purchase of \nmotorbikes. This is clearly not low-risk lending but the risk-return profile appears reasonable in \nthe context of delinquency ratios of 2%-3% (3Q 2005) and average interest margins of close to \n5%. \n \n3.  Nevertheless, individual lending has grown to about 30% of banking system loans at \nend-September  2005  from  just  10%  in  1997;  SME-commercial  loans  are  estimated  at \nApproximately 40% and corporate loans at approximately 30% (a sharp reduction from 60%-\n70% pre-crisis). However, the overall share of retail loans to total loans is, according to Fitch, \nlikely to be slightly higher, possibly closer to 35%. \n \n4.  With lending to individuals, the segmental breakdown is estimated as follows: 45% \nautomotive (including motorcycles), 20% residential mortgages, 10% credit cards, and 25% \nmicro-credits and other personal loans. Growth has been led by the financing of motorcycles \n(where sales have increased by 30%-40% over 2004-2005), residential properties, cars and \nother micro-credits. \n \n5.  There  is  currently  no  nationwide  credit  bureau  in  Indonesia,  although  a  regulatory \nframework was established in early 2005 for a more comprehensive platform to be developed. \n \nB.  Nonperforming Loans \n \n6.  The 12 larger Indonesian banks show gross consumer NPL rates of no more than 2%-\n3% of their consumer loan portfolio as at September 2005 compared with an overall banking \nsystem gross NPL ratio of 9%-10%. The high overall NPL rate reflects an overhang of corporate \nand commercial NPLs emanating from the Asian financial crisis while the low consumer NPL \nfigure has been partly diluted by the banks\u2019 strong expansion.  \n \n7.  Credit  assessment  and  risk  management  processes  in  this  area  are  still  evolving. \nHence, the recent sharp spike in domestic interest rates, with the 1-month SBI upped by 550bp \nover 2005, may cause some deterioration in consumer loan quality and ease the pace of \nlending in 2006. The system-wide impact, however, should be mitigated by the still low level of \n                                                 \n1 This section is based on Fitch. Indonesian Retail Lending Market, 2006. ", "  Appendix 2  15 \nconsumer leverage, the stronger financial shape of the larger banks and the support that is \nlikely to be forthcoming for several of the now foreign-owned private national banks. Rising \naffluence and a growing middle class in Indonesia are also other factors that should help \nunderpin  the  long-term  growth  prospects  for  the  retail  loan  market  in  Indonesia.  The  key \nuncertainty in 2006 is how much negative impact higher interest rates will have on consumer \ncredit quality. \n \nC.  Outlook for Consumer Lending in Indonesia  \n8.  The underdeveloped consumer lending market of Indonesia has room to grow for many \nyears but the lesson to draw from the recent experience of Republic of Korea is that effective \nrisk management tools are essential. However, access to good information combined with \nreasonably  sophisticated  risk  management  systems  will  not  prevent  bad  debt  problems  if \nlenders  are  too  aggressive  in  extending  credit  to  new  borrowers,  who  are  inevitably \ninexperienced  in  managing  personal  borrowing,  making  it  too  easy  for  them  to  take  on \nexcessive debts. \n \n9.  In this respect, finance companies have several advantages over banks in the marketing \nand collection of such loans through their grassroots-based staff and offices. Recently, the \nindustry consolidated the four larger finance companies in Indonesia that are either majority \nowned by banks (Adira Finance and WOM are now owned by Danamon and BII respectively) or \naffiliated to a bank (via Astra which holds a stake in Bank Permata). \n ", "16   Appendix 3 \n \nINDONESIAN MOTORCYCLE MARKET \nFigure A8.1: Indonesia Motorcycle Sales\n6,000,000 \n5,074,277 \n5,000,000 \n4,500,000\n3,900,664 \n4,000,000 \n3,000,000  2,823,111\n2,307,678\n1,852,476\n2,000,000  1,654,855\n1,426,901 \n1,035,595  976,819\n873,808\n1,000,000  587,410\n518,776\n0 \n1995  1996  1997  1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004  2005  Mar  2006\n'06 \n \nSource: Asosiasi Industri Sepeda Motor Indonesia (AISI).   \n \n \n \nFigure A8.2: Indonesia Motorcycle Market Growth \n \n2005 vs. 2006 \n \n600,000 0%\n-5%\n500,000\n-10% In\nc\n400,000 r\ne\na\ns s\ne -15% e\nal  (D\nUnit S 300,000 -20% ecre\na\ns\n200,000 e\n)\n-25%  (%\n)\n100,000\n-30%\n0 -35%\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n2005 2006 Market Growth YTD 2006 (YoY)\nNote:   \n  \u2022  YTD Apr 2006: 1,144,900 \n  \u2022  Monthly Average YTD 2006: 286,225 \n\u2022  Monthly Average 2005: 423,477 \nSource: PT Summit OTO Finance.
