The  report  also  describes  the \nproposed technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Supporting  Implementation  of  SEMP  II,  and  if  the  Board \napproves the proposed policy-based loan and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me \nby the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \nThe  program  will  provide  budget  support  for  reforms  to  (i)  improve  revenue  and \n2. \nmacroprudential  management,  and  (ii)  strengthen  financial  sector  development  by  targeting \ncapital  markets,  financial  inclusion,  and  the  Credit  Information  Bureau  (CIB).  Through  these \nreforms, the program will improve macroeconomic stability in Bhutan.  \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\n3. \nPast  structural  and  cyclical  imbalances  and ADB\u2019s  assistance. With the hydropower \nsector  driving  growth,  Bhutan\u2019s  economy  achieved  an  average  annual  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP)  growth  rate  of  8%  during  fiscal  years  (FYs)  2001\u20132011.  Despite  the  high  growth \nperformance,  Bhutan  faced  a  major  rupee  liquidity  crunch  in  FY2012,  which  exposed  critical \nstructural  and  cyclical  imbalances  in  the  economy  related  to  (i)  a  narrow  economic  base,  (ii) \nmismatches  in  revenue  flows  and  debt  repayments  due  to  the  overreliance  on  the  hydropower \ndevelopment,  (iii)  credit-driven  and  import-dependent  consumption  growth  leading  to  rapid \ndepletion  of  Indian  rupee  reserves,  and  (iv)  policy  distortions  associated  with  weaknesses  in \nmacroeconomic management and financial intermediation.  \n \n4. \nIn  response  to  the  liquidity  crunch,  the  Government  of  Bhutan  adopted  temporary \nemergency measures such as curtailing credit and import growth. As part of the comprehensive \nreforms,  ADB  provided  support  for  the  government  by  financing  the  Strengthening  Economic \nManagement Program (SEMP I) in 2013.2 SEMP I successfully helped stabilize the economy, and \nthereby avoid a prolonged slowdown. The economy grew by 3.5% in FY2013 with an increase in \n\nI  was \n\nsuccessfully \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2013.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Policy-Based  Loan \nand Grant to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Strengthening Economic Management Program.  Manila (L2994/G0338-\nBHU).  SEMP \ninclude  \nin \nstrengthening of budget and debt management through preparation of municipal budgets based on the medium-term \nexpenditure  framework,  and  approval  of  the  Medium-Term  Debt  Management  Strategy,  and  a  strategy  for  the \ngovernment  securities  market.  For  revenue  management,  the  Department  of  Revenue  and  Customs  piloted  the \nrevenue administration management information system (RAMIS). The Ministry of Finance adopted and piloted a new \nproperty  valuation  methodology.  For  monetary  and  liquidity  management,  the  Royal  Monetary  Authority  approved \nmacroprudential regulations, credit rating agency regulations, and the Capital Markets Master Plan. For external and \ninternal audit systems, the Royal Audit Authority piloted an audit resource management system, approved an internal \naudit  manual,  and  completed  training  of  audit  staff  from  the  internal  audit  divisions  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and \nother ministries. The program was supported in part by five TA projects. Assessment of the Strengthening Economic \nManagement Program (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nJuly  2014.  Major  program \n\ncompleted \n\nreforms \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \ninternational reserves\u2014the balance of payments turned to a surplus of 9.5% of GDP in FY2013, \nfrom a deficit of 10.7% in FY2012.3 \n\nissues  related \n\n \n5. \nRemaining  development  constraints.  Despite  the  success  of  SEMP  I,  two  critical \ndevelopment  constraints  need  to  be  addressed. 4  First,  weak  institutions  and  systems  for \nmacroeconomic  management  constrain  the  government\u2019s  capacity  to  effectively  manage \nmacroeconomic  shocks  and  mitigate  their  impact  on  the  economy.  The  government\u2019s  capacity \nneeds to be strengthened in this area. Second, the absence of a developed financial sector has \nconstrained private sector development and growth of infrastructure investment. Low investment \nhas led to an undiversified economy that over-relies on the hydropower sector, characterized by \nlow  employment  generation.  Removing  policy  distortions  related  to  financial  intermediation  and \naccess to finance is a prerequisite for sustainable economic growth.  \n \n6. \nGovernment  efforts,  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue,  and  development  coordination. \nRecognizing these critical constraints, the government is fully committed to putting in place more \npermanent,  structural,  and  corrective  measures  to  strengthen  the  economy.5 These  measures \nwould not  only  provide  continuity  and  deepen  earlier  reforms  under  SEMP  I,  but  also  revive the \neconomy and lead to a more sustainable and balanced growth model in Bhutan. SEMP II is timely \nand  essential  to  support  the  objectives  of  the  government.  The  reforms  proposed  under  the \nprogram  address \nfinancial  sector \ndevelopment. \n \n7. \nThe reforms for improving macroeconomic management will help sustain the recovery and \nstrengthen  resilience  against  potential  macroeconomic,  financial,  and  external  shocks.  This  will \nhelp minimize volatility and improve macroeconomic stability to achieve sustainable growth. The \nmacroeconomic management reforms have two components. \n \nRevenue  management. Given  Bhutan\u2019s  tax revenue to GDP  ratio of 13.2%  in  FY2014,6 \n8. \nthere is scope for additional revenue mobilization by improving tax administration and broadening \nthe tax base. This will reduce the dependence on external grants and loans over the medium to \nlong  term  and  a  larger  share  of  development  outlays  could  be  financed  from  country\u2019s  own \nresources by creating additional fiscal space.    \n \nMacroprudential  management.  The  reforms  for  macroprudential  management  are \n9. \nnecessary  to  enhance  macrofinancial  stability  by  improving  the  regulatory  framework  and \nproviding better supervision of financial system soundness. It is also critical to reduce risks arising \nfrom  debt  spikes  due  to  challenges  in  forecasting  government  revenue  and  expenditure  flows; \nasset\u2013liability  mismatches  on  the  banking sector balance sheet;  and the hydropower  linked  pro-\ncyclicality of bank lending. \n \n\nto  macroeconomic  management  and \n\n                                                \n3  The overall macroeconomic conditions have stabilized further with GDP growth at 4.0% in FY2014, although it is still \nbelow  the  historic  average  annual  growth  rate  of  8%  during  FY2001\u2013FY2011.  The  fiscal deficit  increased  to 4%  in \nFY2014 compared with the deficit during the rupee liquidity crunch due to low tax revenue associated with economic \nslowdown. The current account deficit narrowed slightly. The balance of payments was in a surplus of 5.8% of GDP \nin  FY2014,  supported  by  an  increase  in  official  reserves  in  months  of  import  coverage.  Money  supply  growth  and \ninflation remained stable due to credit restrictions. No major inflationary risks are associated with capital inflows due \nto the tight monetary policy in FY2014.  Country Economic Indicators; and International Monetary Fund  Assessment \nLetter (both accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n4  The Sector Assessment (Summary) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). These development \nconstraints are also  identified in ADB. 2013.  Country Diagnostic Studies. Bhutan: Critical Development Constraints. \nManila.  \n\n5  The Development Policy Letter is in Appendix 3. \n6  Indicative Estimate of Impact from Revenue Reforms (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\n10. \nThe  reforms  to  strengthen financial  sector  development  under the  SEMP  II  are  critical  to \naddress  the  lack  of  diversification  and  depth  in  financial  sector,  high  cost  of  financial \nintermediation,  lack  of  long-term  financing  especially  for  infrastructure,  low  savings  mobilization, \nand  information  asymmetries  associated  with  access  to  finance.  The  proposed  reforms  in  this \narea  will  complement  government\u2019s  own  initiatives  such  as  the  Capital  Markets  Master  Plan.7 \nMoreover,  in  line  with  government  priorities  under  the  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan  (2013\u20132018),8 \nimproving the business climate for the private sector through better CIB coverage and services is \nrequired for Bhutan to lower the country\u2019s dependence on the capital-intensive hydropower sector, \nand  diversify  its  economic  base  in  order  to  (i)  improve  its  export  potential,  which  could  help \nalleviate the current account deficits; (ii) generate employment; and (iii) achieve poverty reduction \ngoals.9  \n \n11. \nThe  policy  matrix  of  SEMP  II  was  designed  in  coordination  with  the  World  Bank\u2019s  2014 \ndevelopment  policy  credit  of  $20  million  for  Fiscal  Sustainability  and  Investment  Climate.  The \nWorld Bank program focuses on improving the ease of doing business, such as strengthening of \nelectronic  property  and  business  registration  systems,  central  asset  registry,  and  investor \nprotection.  The  two  programs  are  complementary  and  pursue  the  common  objective  of \ncomprehensive private sector development in Bhutan.10 \n \n12. \nReform  program  and  budget  support.  The  reforms  highlighted  in  the  policy  matrix \n(Appendix  4)  will  facilitate  Bhutan\u2019s  transition  to  a  sustainable  and  balanced  socioeconomic \ndevelopment  path.  The  budget  support  under  SEMP  II  is  necessary  to  finance  part  of  the \nprojected resource gap (Table 1), particularly covering the period between introduction of reforms, \nand  the  time  when  the  reforms  gain  traction  and  the  full  impact  of  the  reforms  is  realized.  The \nsupport  will  temporarily  contribute  to  government  spending  in  areas  such  as  infrastructure  and \nsocial  programs  for  education  and  health,  until  the  full  impact  of  the  reforms  can  lead  to  more \nsustained development spending. \n\n13. \nADB\u2019s  value  addition.  Through  SEMP  II,  ADB\u2019s  value  addition  in  Bhutan  will  be  to \nintroduce  reforms  in  the  areas  of  public  resource  management  and  financial  and  private  sector \ndevelopment based on its experience and knowledge of international best practices and extensive \ninvolvement in similar programs in South Asia. ADB\u2019s strength lies in its integrated policy support, \nwhich  focuses  on  \u201chow  to  do  it\u201d  and  covers  (i)  policy  dialogue,  (ii)  structuring  and  design  of \ncustomized  policy  reforms,  (iii)  policy  implementation  support,  and  (iv)  capacity  development \nthrough  technical  assistance  to  ensure  sustainability.  Very  few  development  partners  have  the \ncredibility, the means, or the capacity to offer this solutions-based approach, which can effectively \nadapt  best  practices  to  the  specific  needs  and  conditions  of  the  Bhutanese  economy. 11 For \nexample, SEMP II, in addition to the attached TA (paras. 25\u201326), is supported by three ongoing \n\n                                                \n7  The Capital Markets Master Plan for 2014\u20132024 was approved by the  Ministry of  Finance and the Royal Monetary \n\nAuthority as a policy action under SEMP I.  \n\n8  Government  of  Bhutan,  Gross  National  Happiness  Commission.  2013.

In  addition,  ADB  will  support  the  establishment  of  the  Better \nBusiness  Council  in  Bhutan  under  ADB.  2012.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for  Enhancing \nDevelopment Management for Sustainable and Inclusive Growth. Manila. (TA 8229-BHU). \n\n10  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 Since  2006,  ADB  approved  two  major  programs  (Financial  Sector  Development  Program  and  Micro,  Small,  and \nMedium-Sized  Enterprise  Sector  Development  Program  [footnote  17])  and  16  TA  projects  in  the  areas  of  public \nsector management and financial and private sector development, which have built the reform momentum leading to \nSEMP  I  and  SEMP  II.  Through  these  programs,  ADB  has  gained  an  in-depth  understanding  of  the  capacity  of \nBhutanese  institutions  to  effectively  manage  reforms.  Development  Coordination  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \nTA projects, which will assist the government in (i) operationalizing the tax administration system \nunder  the  revenue  administration  management  information  system  (RAMIS);12 (ii)  implementing \nmacroprudential  rules  and  regulations,  and  the  liquidity  management  and  stress  testing \nframework;  and  publishing  a  financial  stability  report  for  FY2015; 13  and  (iii)  formulating  the \nNational  Pension  Policy  and  a  strategic  plan  for  the  National  Pension  and  Provident  Fund \n(NPPF).14  \n\n \n14. \nAlignment with ADB\u2019s strategy and lessons learned. The program is fully aligned with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 to improve public sector management, strengthen \nthe financial sector, and promote the private sector development in Bhutan.15  \n \nSEMP  II  draws  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  policy-based  loans  in  South  Asia16 \n15. \nand  in  small  economies  such  as  Bhutan  and  the  Maldives,17   and  SEMP  I  (footnote  2).  Three \nimportant  lessons  are  that  (i)  active  stakeholder  consultation  can  increase  the  acceptability  and \nmomentum  of  reforms;  (ii)  government  ownership  and  commitment  are  a  prerequisite  for \nsuccessful  program  implementation;  and  (iii)  sustained  engagement  with  government  officials, \nincluding  capacity  development,  is  critical  for  timely  program  completion.  For  the  proposed \nprogram, aside from the government, consultations with financial sector representatives from the \nBankers\u2019 Association of Bhutan and civil society organizations, such as the Bhutan Association of \nWomen Entrepreneurs and National Commission for Women and Children,  were conducted and \nstakeholder engagement will continue throughout program implementation.  \n \nB. \n \n16. \nBhutan.

The  program  will  strengthen \ndevelopment  of  the  financial  sector  to  rebalance  growth  by  promoting  an  investment-driven \neconomy in the medium term, and to reorient and diversify the economic base in the long term. \nFor  development  of  capital  markets,  policy  actions  will  include  (i)  strengthening  of  the  NPPF \nthrough  risk-based  investment  guidelines,  Cabinet  approval  of  the  National  Pension  Policy, \napproval  of  the  NPPF  strategic  plan,  and  increase  in  NPPF  membership  by  at  least  5%;  (ii) \neffectiveness  of  regulations  for  the  public  issue  of  shares;  (iii)  conducting  a  feasibility  study  on \nestablishing a securities and exchange commission; (iv) approval and starting implementation of \nBhutanese  Accounting  Standards  and  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards; 20  and  (v) \nconducting  a  feasibility  study  on  securitizing  Bhutan\u2019s  hydropower  revenues  to  strengthen  the \ngovernment\u2019s  capacity  for  infrastructure  financing.

Under  the  circumstances,  the  government  has  adopted  a \npolicy of financing its capital and infrastructure expenditures through external concessional loans \nand grants, while using domestic revenues to finance current expenditure.23 \n\n                                                \n18 These enhanced disclosure requirements are in line with Basel III core principles. \n19 A  more  streamlined  framework  will  be  implemented  in  line  with  the  new  prudential  liquidity  standards  of  the  Basel \n\nCommittee on Banking Supervision.  \n\n20 With  the  early  adoption  of  an  additional  26  Bhutanese  Accounting  Standards  and  International  Financial  Reporting \n\nStandards, the standards are harmonized with international norms.  \n\n21 Bhutan  Development  Bank  Limited  provides  mobile  and  branchless  financial  services,  particularly  for  underserved \n\ngroups, such as rural women. \n\n22 Gewog refers to a group of villages in Bhutan. \n23 Bhutan\u2019s  debt  stock  is  related  to  the  hydropower  development.  Capacity  addition  of  10,000  megawatts  is  targeted \nthrough  construction  of  10  hydropower  projects  by  2020.  Six  of  these  projects  are  proposed  to  be  funded  under \nbilateral  agreements  with  India  on  a  70:30  loan-to-grant  basis  and  four  projects  are  commercial  joint  ventures \nbetween public sector companies in both countries. Based on debt sustainability analysis under SEMP I and the July \n2014  IMF  Article  IV  consultation  report,  Bhutan\u2019s  debt  dynamics  (including  hydropower  loans)  are  classified  as \n\u201cmoderate risk.\u201d For the debt portfolio and debt service requirements, there is sufficient hedge against the risks due to \nfavorable financing arrangements with India and strong economic returns from these hydropower projects. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n21. \nIn  line  with  this  policy,  the  government\u2019s  development  financing  need  at  the  broad \nmacroeconomic level is projected to be $85.5 million, which is the resource gap between FY2015 \nand  FY2017  (Table  1).24 It  is  proposed  that  ADB  covers  $36.2  million  (42%  of  the  gap)  under \nSEMP II and the remaining $49.3 million will be financed by the government. 25  \n \n\nTable 1: Overall Fiscal Deficit and Development Financing Needs \n\nItem \nFiscal balance  \n         Nu million \n         $ million \nNet borrowing \n         Nu million \n         $ million \nResource gap \n          Nu million \n          $ million \nExchange rate \n          Nu/$ \n\nFY2014 \n(Revised) \n\nFY2015 \n(Budget) \n\nFY2016 \n(Projection) \n  \n\nFY2017 \n(Projection) \n  \n\nTotal \nFY2015\u2013FY2017  \n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n(4,601.6) \n(77.1) \n\n66.2 \n1.1 \n\n(4,535.4) \n(76.0) \n\n59.7 \n\n(3,447.1) \n(53.2) \n \n\n(1,358.1) \n(21.0) \n  \n\n(4,805.2) \n(74.2) \n \n64.8 \n\n(1,278.2)  \n(18.9)  \n \n371.6 \n5.5 \n  \n(906.6)  \n(13.4)  \n \n67.8 \n\n135.8  \n1.9  \n \n9.7 \n0.1 \n  \n145.4  \n2.1  \n \n70.9 \n\n(4,589.5) \n(70.1) \n \n(976.9) \n(15.3) \n \n\n(5,566.4) \n(85.5) \n\n \n \n\n( ) = negative, FY = fiscal year.  \nNote: Revised estimates are as of 31 March 2014.  \nSources: FY2014, FY2015, net borrowing and exchange rate are from  Government of Bhutan, Ministry of Finance. \n2014.

The \nloan  and  grant  will  have  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  financing \nagreement.27  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n23. \nThe Department of Public Accounts (DPA) of the Ministry of Finance will be the executing \nagency.  It  will  oversee  and  coordinate  timely  implementation  of  the  policy  actions.  DPA  will  be \nresponsible  for  overall  administration  of  the  program  and  the  TA,  disbursements,  and \nmaintenance  of  all  program  records.  A  program  steering  committee,  comprising  representatives \nfrom the implementing agencies, will be set up and chaired by the secretary and/or joint secretary \nof the Ministry of Finance.28  It will meet quarterly to monitor progress. ADB will monitor program \nimplementation  through  periodic  progress  reports,  submitted  by  DPA,  and  will  field  regular \nmissions to confirm the fulfillment of policy actions for tranche releases. ADB and the World Bank \n\n                                                \n24 The resource gap, which is the sum of the fiscal balance and net borrowing, reflects the financing requirement of the \ntotal outlay, which could not be met from available domestic resources including grants and planned net borrowing.  \n25 Combined  with  SEMP  II,  an  additional  World  Bank  development  policy  credit  of  $20  million,  to  be  disbursed  in \nFY2016,  will  finance  66%  of  the  estimated  resource  gap.  The  government  will  then  finance  the  remaining  $29.3 \nmillion.  For  details  of  the  development  financing  need  based  on  fiscal  projections,  see  Economic  and  Financial \nAnalysis; and Indicative Estimate of Impact from Revenue Reforms (both accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2).  \n\n26 A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its risk \nof debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that Bhutan has a moderate risk of debt distress \nand is therefore eligible to receive 50% of its Asian Development Fund allocation as grants. \n\n27 Financing Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 The implementing agencies are Bhutan Development Bank Limited, CIB, the Department of Revenue and Customs, \n\nDPA, the Ministry of Finance, NPPF, the Registrar of Companies, and the Royal Monetary Authority. \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nwill  continue  coordination  to  ensure  no  overlap  or  duplication  of  activities  during  program \nimplementation.  \n \n24. \nTranches,  disbursement,  and  counterpart  funds. The program has two tranches. The \ngrant  will  be  disbursed  as  the  first  tranche  upon  effectiveness  of  the  draft  financing  agreement \n(expected  in  June  2015),  which  will  be  conditional  upon  achievement  of  the  first  tranche  policy \nactions.  The  loan  will  be  disbursed  as  the  second  tranche  upon  achievement  of  the  second \ntranche  policy  actions  (expected  to  be  no  later  than  18  months  after  disbursement  of  the  first \ntranche).  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  and  the  grant  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nsimplification  of  disbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for  policy-based  loans  and \ngrants.29 The proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items produced and \nprocured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  items  included  in  a  list  of  ineligible  items  and \nimports financed  by  other bilateral  and multilateral  sources.30 Local  currency  generated from the \nloan  and  grant  will  be  deposited  into  the  government\u2019s  budget  fund  account  with  the  Bank  of \nBhutan  Limited  to  provide  supplementary  financing  for  the  budget.  The  program  will  be \nimplemented over a period of 18 months. The disbursement of the loan and grant proceeds will be \nin accordance  with ADB\u2019s Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as amended from time to time) \nand  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the  government  and  ADB.  ADB  will  have  the \nright to audit the use of the proceeds and verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n25. \nThe  attached  capacity  development  TA  is  proposed  to  support  program  implementation. \nThe TA outputs will mirror major policy actions under the program and strengthen the capacity of \nkey institutions responsible for implementing the reforms.31 The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, \nof which $700,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-V). The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nand housing accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and \nother in-kind contributions.  \n \n26. \nDPA  will  be  the  executing  agency,  and  will  oversee  and  coordinate  the  timely \nimplementation  of  TA  activities  through  the  program  steering  committee.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented over 18 months from the disbursement of the first tranche (expected in June 2015) \nuntil  the  disbursement  of  the  second  tranche  (expected  no  later  than  December  2016).  It  will \nrequire a total of 15 person-months of international consultancy services and 12 person-months of \nnational  consultancy  services  intermittently.  Consultants  will  be  recruited,  using  the  quality-  and \ncost-based  selection  method  with  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  90:10  due  to  the  highly  specialized \nexpertise  needed,  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  All  disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nTechnical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nProcurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as \namended from time to time).  \n \n \n \n                                                \n29 ADB. 1998.

Loan  and  grant  proceeds \ndisbursed against imports will require a certificate from the government stipulating that, in a given year, the value of \nthe  total  imports  of  Bhutan,  minus  its  imports  from  non-member  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed \nunder  other  official  development  assistance,  is  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  loan  and  the  grant  expected  to  be \ndisbursed  in  such  year.

The fiscal balance to GDP \nratio is projected to improve to a deficit of 0.9% in FY2016 from a deficit of 2.7% in FY2015, and \nturn to a modest surplus of 0.1% in FY2017 (Table 2). The creation of fiscal space will enable the \ngovernment  to  devote  more  resources  on  a  sustainable  basis  for  capital  spending  and  social \nprograms  that  are  critical  for  inclusive  growth.  Revenue  management  reforms  will  help  Bhutan \nmaintain  a  smaller  resource  gap  and  manage  any  recurring  development  financing  needs  more \neffectively after program implementation (Table 1). \n \n\nItem \nDomestic revenue (tax and non-tax) \nCurrent expenditure  \nCapital expenditure  \nFiscal balance (% of GDP) \nReal GDP growth (%) \n\nTable 2: Fiscal Indicators \n($ million) \nFY2014 \n(Revised) \n366.5 \n322.9 \n341.3 \n(4.0) \n4.0 \n\nFY2013 \n(Actual) \n355.1 \n304.5 \n310.1 \n(4.1) \n3.5 \n\nFY2015 \n(Budget) \n379.6 \n337.9 \n234.6 \n(2.7) \n6.8 \n\nFY2016 \nProjection \n\nFY2017 \nProjection \n\n397.6 \n358.2 \n323.7 \n(0.9) \n5.2 \n\n427.1 \n365.0 \n316.3 \n0.1 \n5.1 \n\n( ) = negative, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: GDP growth for FY2013 and FY2014 are from Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments  in  Appendix  2).

These reforms will enable proactive \nmanagement  of  macrofinancial  risks  and  improve  resilience  of  the  economy  against  economic \nshocks.  Reforms  targeting  financial  sector  development  will  help  rebalance  Bhutan\u2019s  economy \ntoward  investment  and  reorient  the  economic  base  to  private  sector  development.  The  program \nwill  strengthen  the  regulatory  and  institutional  framework  for  efficient  financial  intermediation. \nIntroduction of a legal framework for microfinance institutions and branchless banking, outreach of \ntechnology-based  financial  services  to  underserved  communities  in  rural  areas,  and  a  financial \nliteracy  program  will  enhance financial  inclusion,  and savings  mobilization. The  strengthening  of \nCIB will improve access to finance and the business climate for entrepreneurs. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n29. \nThe governance risk assessment was conducted as part of the ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy. 33 The  assessment  does  not  identify  any  serious  governance  risks  related  to  public \n\n                                                \n32 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 A  summary  of  the  governance  risk  assessment  is  available  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan  of \n\nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for Bhutan (footnote 15). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nfinancial  management,  procurement,  and  corruption  at  the  executing  level.  The  program  will \nsupport  policy  actions  and  capacity  development  that  address  vulnerabilities  for  public  financial \nmanagement  by  (i)  improving  cash  forecasting,  including  reliable  revenue  projections;  (ii) \ndeveloping  systems  for  effective  debt  management,  including  the  government  debt  securities \nmarket;  (iii)  improving  the  local  and  national  tax  administration;  and  (iv)  strengthening  financial \nstability  monitoring,  including  liquidity  management  and  stress  testing  of  the  financial  sector. \nThese reforms  will  strengthen fiduciary  arrangements  for  efficient  utilization  of  public  resources. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment and DPA. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, implementation of the \nprogram  will  adhere  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Implementing  the  Second  Governance  and \nAnticorruption Action Plan (2014). \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n30. \nAlthough  Bhutan\u2019s  record  of  poverty  reduction  has  been  strong  in  the  last  decade,  the \nimprovement of the general quality of life has been accompanied by rising vulnerabilities such as \naccelerating  rural\u2013urban  migration,  widening  income  inequality,  and  rising  youth  unemployment \nbecause  of  the  narrow  economic  base.  In  addition,  in  the  absence  of  a  strong  social  security \nsystem,  risks  of  cyclical  downturns  and  external  economic  shocks  have  made  protection  of \nvulnerable groups more difficult. From this perspective, the program will have a positive impact on \npoverty  and social  issues. The  program  will  improve  the  management  of  the  economy,  which is \nnecessary  to  achieve  a  stable  and  sustainable  growth  trajectory,  and  in  turn  allow  for  effective \nallocation of public resources to achieve development goals and provide critical public services for \nthe poor and other vulnerable groups such as women. By strengthening financial institutions and \nCIB, the program will improve the enabling environment for private sector development, which is \ncritical for employment generation and poverty reduction. The program\u2019s emphasis on introducing \nmobile  and  branchless  banking  services  will  extend  the  reach  of  financial  services  to  remote \nareas. The financial literacy program will strengthen the financial inclusion by creating awareness \nof  access  to  formal  financial  services  among  various  socioeconomic,  demographic,  and  gender \ngroups in Bhutan; and the culture of savings and responsible personal financial management.34  \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nProgram activities are confined to policy and institutional reforms. None of the activities will \n31. \nresult  in  or  lead  to  involuntary  resettlement  or  affect  indigenous  peoples.  No  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  have  been  identified.  Safeguard  categories  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples are all C. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n32. \nThe program is categorized as low risk as (i) the size of the program loan is less than $50 \nmillion;  (ii)  ADB  has  a  sound  record  with  previous  experience  in  the  sector  in  Bhutan;  \n(iii) DPA, the proposed executing agency, has a good performance record for externally financed \nproject  implementation;  and  (iv)  the  program  is  unlikely  to  have  any  impact  on  safeguards.  The \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks that could affect \nprogram  implementation  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.35  \n \n \n\n                                                \n34 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n35 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nPublic financial management \n\nWeak implementation capacity \nof government agencies \nInadequate coordination among \ngovernment agencies  \nTrained staff are not retained \nduring program implementation \n\n \nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nStrengthening of systems and institutions under SEMP II for cash \nforecasting, debt management, tax administration and financial \nstability monitoring  \nTechnical assistance provided to improve the capacity of the \nimplementing agencies \nEstablishment of a program steering committee for proper \ncoordination \nEngagement with the government to stress the importance of staff \ncontinuity and capacity building of junior staff to develop expertise and \nknowledge at all levels \n\nSEMP II = Strengthening Economic Management Program II. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n33. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to all \napplicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, \nprocurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  draft  financing \nagreement.
