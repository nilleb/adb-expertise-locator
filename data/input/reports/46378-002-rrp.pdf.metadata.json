With  this  strategic \nlocation,  Pakistan  has  the  potential  to  be  a  regional  transport  hub.  The  government\u2019s  national \ntrade corridor improvement program launched in 2006 realized this potential and highlights the \nimportance  of  regional  connectivity  through  improving  linkages  with  neighboring  countries. \nThe  Pakistan  Vision  2025  strategy  embraces  the  country\u2019s  potential  as  a  hub  and  corridor  of \nregional  trade,  and  aims  to  help  integrate  the  region  into  an  interconnected  market  and make \nPakistan a hub of regional trade and commerce.2  \n\nIn  2011,  Pakistan  joined  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC) \n4. \nProgram.  Pakistan\u2019s  accession  to  the  CAREC  Program  will  enable  subregions  in  Asia  and \nEurope to be virtually integrated and seamlessly connected from East Asia through South Asia \nand  Central  Asia  to  Europe.  In  2013,  the  CAREC  corridors  were  extended  to  Pakistan  to \nconnect Afghanistan, Central Asia, and the People\u2019s Republic of China to Gwadar and Karachi \nports  on  the  Arabian  Sea.  The  CAREC  Transport  and  Trade  Facilitation  Strategy  2020, \nendorsed  by  the  CAREC  ministers  at  the  12th  Ministerial  Conference  in  2013,  proposes \n$5.6  billion  of  investment  projects  to  build  the  extended  CAREC  corridors  in  Pakistan  to \nstreamline transport, trade logistics, customs, and other trade-related border control operations, \nwhich would increase cross-border trade in South and Central Asia.3 In tune with these various \ngovernment  visions  and  CAREC  initiatives,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country \npartnership  strategy,  2015\u20132019  for  Pakistan  emphasizes  the  necessity  of  modernization  of \ntransport infrastructure and greater regional connectivity.4 \n\n5. \nThe  performance  of  Pakistan  Customs  has  improved  substantially  since  2010. \nIn 2012, it was ranked by international freight forwarders as being the best in the Central Asia \nregion.5 In 2012, Pakistan Customs started the rollout of its Web Based One Customs system, \nwhich  has  helped  achieve  gradual  reduction  of  paperwork  and  processing  time.  Pakistan \nCustoms  implements  preliminary  assessment  of  cargo  pre-arrival  information  and  uses  risk \nmanagement  for  selective  customs  inspections.  However,  the  performance  of  border  point \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Pakistan, Planning Commission. 2014.

Doing Business: Trading Across Borders Dataset. \n\nhttp://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/trading-across-borders (accessed 3 July 2015); World Bank. \nLogistics Performance Index Dataset. http://lpi.worldbank.org/ (accessed 3 July 2015). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nmanagement  still  lags  behind  and  consequently  poses  a  fundamental  obstacle  to  promoting \ntransit  and  intraregional  trade  through  Pakistan.  The  main  reasons  for  this  poor  performance \ninclude the following: (i) poor infrastructure and facilities at border points; (ii) lack of governance \nstructure  in  border  point  management;  (iii)  remote  locations  of  border  points,  which  are \ngenerally in security-sensitive areas; and (iv) lack of internet service, which hinders connectivity \nto the central database of the Web Based One Customs system. \n\n6. \nTorkham  and  Chaman  are  the  major  transit  stations  for  Afghan  transit  trade  (84%  of \ncargo flows through Torkham and 16% flows through Chaman as of 2014). Traffic volume at the \nTorkham  border  crossing  point  now  amounts  to  700  vehicles  per  day.6 However,  both  border \npoints face challenges to meet demand for quality services, characterized by nonavailability of \nmodern  and  sufficient  physical  infrastructure,  nonavailability  of  suitable  information  and \ncommunication  technology  (ICT)  infrastructure,  poor  logistics  for  staff  and  officers,  lack  of \nequipment and scanners to detect explosives, and insufficient facilities to manage movement of \npeople  (estimated  to  be  more  than  25,000  people  per  day  for  Torkham).  Currently,  the  trade \nvolume  between  India  and  Pakistan  is  less  than  $3  billion.  With  full  normalization  of  their \npolitical  and  trade  relationship,  potential  trade  volume  between  the  two  countries  would  likely \ngrow substantially, and Wagha, the only open land route connecting South Asia to Central Asia, \nwill not be able to handle the trade and traffic volumes owing to a lack of infrastructure allowing \nthe transport of containerized cargo by road. \n\n7. \nAccording to the CAREC corridor performance measurement and monitoring study, the \nmajor  bottleneck  for  transport  and  trade  in  the  CAREC  region  is  border  crossing  points. 7 \nFor  a  typical  500-kilometer  journey  by  a  20-ton  truck,  more  than  three-quarters  of  the  total \nstopping  time,  or  24  hours,  occurs  at  border  crossing  points,  with  more  than  18  hours  of  this \ntime spent waiting for border-crossing formalities to commence.8 A significant portion of delays \nare attributable to poor physical infrastructure, low utilization of ICT for efficient border control, \nand limited supporting trade logistics facilities at the border crossing points. In Pakistan, border \ncrossing points are the worst bottlenecks for cross-border transport and trade because of poor \ninfrastructure  at  the  border  points,  such  as  poor  customs  facilities,  insufficient  and  outdated \noffice and cargo handling equipment, limited parking spaces for vehicles near border crossings, \nfrequent  power  failures,  insufficient  and  unplanned  supporting  infrastructure,  poor  ICT \ninfrastructure,  and  difficult  terrain  and  uncertain  road  security  conditions  in  the  area  of  border \ncrossing. \n\n8. \nThere  is  no  legally  established  border  point  management  regime  in  Pakistan. \nAll border points are physically possessed and controlled by security forces whose only interest \nis border security, with no concern for trade facilitation. The National Logistics Cell (NLC),9 filling \nthis governance vacuum, has developed border point facilities at some border points, acting as \na custodian, and plays the role of a border point facility manager. Recognizing the necessity of a \nlegally transparent border point management regime, the government decided in April 2014 that \n\n                                                \n6  Pakistan  and  Afghanistan  signed  the  amended  Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan  Transit  Trade  Agreement  in  2010,  which \ngives  Pakistani  vehicles  access  to  Central  Asian  countries,  and  gives  Afghan  vehicles  access  to  Pakistan\u2019s \nseaports and to the land port of Wagha for exports to India. \n\n7  ADB.  2014.  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  Corridor  Performance  Measurement  and  Monitoring  A \n\nForward-Looking Retrospective. Manila. \n\n8  In the cases of Torkham and Chaman, the waiting time is 12 hours. \n9  The  NLC  was  originally  established  in  1978  as  an  attached  department  of  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and \nDevelopment  to  manage  the  nationwide  logistics  problems  for  transportation  of  important  commodities. \nFunctionally,  it  is  under  the  administrative  control  of  the  Pakistan  Army.  Since  its  establishment,  it  has  gradually \nevolved into a state-owned organization with expanded areas of operation including development and management \nof cross-border terminals and dry ports.  \n\n\fthe  PLPA  should  be  established.  In  February  2015,  the  government  defined  the  PLPA  as  a \ncustodian of nationwide border points and a border point facility manager and the Federal Board \nof Revenue (FBR) has developed, through ADB\u2019s assistance, a PLPA establishment plan and a \ndraft  executive  order.  Upon  government  endorsement,  the  executive  order  will  be  issued  to \neffectively  establish  the  PLPA,  which  will  take  the  responsibility  to  possess  and  manage  the \nborder  point  facilities  of  Chaman,  Torkham,  and  Wagha  that  will  be  improved  by  the  project. \nThe  project  is  also  designed  to  assist  the  FBR  in  (i)  establishing  the  PLPA  according  to  the \nPLPA establishment plan; and (ii) training border point operating agencies, including the PLPA. \n\n9. \nGiven the challenges facing border crossing points in Pakistan, many aid agencies have \nconducted  studies,  surveys,  and  needs  assessments,  particularly  on  the  subject  of  simplifying \nand  harmonizing  customs  procedures,  improving  border  services,  and  modernizing  border \ncrossing  point  infrastructure.  While  some  infrastructure  improvement  projects  have  been \nundertaken  to  equip  border  points  with  computers,  scanners,  or  weighbridges,  these  efforts \nhave  been  piecemeal  and  have  not  resulted  in  conspicuous  improvements.  To  avoid \ncoordination  issues  among  development  partners,  the  FBR  has  formed  an  Integrated  Transit \nTrade  Management  System  (ITTMS)  Steering  Committee  headed  by  the  minister  for  finance \nand  including  the  ministers  of  commerce,  foreign  affairs,  defense,  and  railways  to  guide  the \ntrade facilitation agenda.  \n\n10.  When  the  project  was  conceptualized  in  2013,  ADB  adopted  a  proactive  donor \ncoordination approach, setting up and chairing a donor coordination group on trade facilitation at \nborder  points;  acting  as  a  bridge  between  all  stakeholders,  including  the  government;  and \nholding  regular  meetings,  which  improved  the  timely  sharing  of  information.  The  coordination \nmechanism  adopted  by  ADB  enabled  donors  to  design  their  own  assistance  programs  to \ncomplement  other  donors\u2019  programs.  ADB  has  led  infrastructure  development,  while  other \ndevelopment partners have focused their attention on other areas, particularly the simplification \nand  harmonization  of  cross-border  procedures  (e.g.,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency  has  focused  on  enhancing  operational  efficiency  at  seaports  in  Karachi,  the \nInternational Finance Corporation has focused on involving the private sector, the United States \nAgency  for  International  Development  has  focused  on  supporting  capacity  development,  and \nthe  World  Bank  has  focused  on  trade  reforms).  The  coordination  efforts  led  by  ADB  in  trade \nfacilitation  have  helped  in  promoting  knowledge  and  information  sharing  among  development \npartners, avoiding duplications of assistance, and more effectively using development resources. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe impact of the project will be an increased value of export, import, and transit trade. \nThe  outcome  will  be  reduced  cross-border  processing  time  for  goods  and  cargo  in  Chaman, \nTorkham, and Wagha. \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe  outputs  will  be  (i)  improvement  of  the  border  crossing  point  infrastructure  and \nfacilities  at  Chaman,  Torkham,  and  Wagha;  (ii)  production  and  adoption  of  a  national  border \npoint management regime governance structure, and production and adoption of organizational \ndesign, management structure, financial and administrative procedures, and financial modeling \nfor the PLPA; and (iii) enhancement of knowledge and skills of border point operating agencies. \n\n13. \nInfrastructure and facility development works include (i) site development, approach and \ninternal  roads,  bridges,  and  boundary  walls;  (ii)  overhead  water  reservoirs,  water  supply,  and \ndrainage  works;  (iii)  streetlights,  floodlights,  solar  power  systems,  power  supply  networks, \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fwatchtowers,  and  security  gates;  (iv)  central  administration  building  with  separate  toilets  for \nmales  and  females,  small  offices,  customs  laboratory,  passenger  terminal  building,  service \nareas, and a business center; (v) warehouses for seized goods, tollbooths and canopies for toll \ncollection,  secondary  inspection  areas,  cargo  immigration  areas,  and  quarantine  sheds; \n(vi)  separate  male  and  female  accommodation  facilities  and  related  infrastructure;  and \n(vii) installation of ICT, security, and trade facilitation equipment. \n\n14. \nCapacity development of border point operating agencies includes (i) legal assistance in \nsetting up the PLPA; (ii) assistance in developing organizational structures, job descriptions with \nno gender bias, and gender-sensitive standard operating procedures and compliance standards \nfor  the  PLPA;  (iii)  assistance  in  planning  and  setting  up  the  financial  model  of  the  PLPA; \n(iv)  assistance  in  project  planning  for  the  takeover  of  border  point  facilities  by  the  PLPA  after \ncompletion  of  construction  works;  (v)  assistance  in  developing  long-term  and  short-term \noperational  planning  for  the  PLPA,  as  well  as  a  performance  management  and  appraisal \nsystem;  (vi)  design  and  implementation  of  training  activities  for  the  PLPA  and  border  point \noperating agencies; (vii) assistance in implementing capacity development plans for staff of the \nPLPA  and border  point operating agencies;  and  (viii)  assistance  in developing  employee  skills \nas  well  as  a  performance  appraisal  and  motivation  system  for  the  PLPA  and  border  point \noperating agencies. \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n15. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $300 million (Table 1). \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\nBase Costb \n1.

The ITTMS Steering Committee  headed by the \nfinance  minister  will  act  as  the  highest  decision-making  authority  for  project  implementation \nissues  and  provide  overall  guidance  for  all  agencies  involved  in  project  implementation. \nA project management unit (PMU) headed by a project director will be  established in the FBR \nthat will provide guidance on, and oversight to, the overall implementation and performance of \nthe  project.  The  PMU\u2019s  technical  expertise  will  be  complemented  by  the  project  management \nconsultant, who will be recruited externally. A project implementation committee, headed by the \nchairperson of the FBR and consisting of senior officers from the Ministry of Commerce and the \nMinistry of Defense, as well as the project director of the PMU, will be established to guide the \nPMU,  review  the  progress  of  implementation,  and  coordinate  with  relevant  ministries  and \ndepartments to resolve any project implementation problems. \n\n19. \nProcurement of goods, civil works, and related services financed from the ADB loan will \nbe  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).  For  Wagha,  the  entire  works  will  be  tendered  by  an  engineering\u2013procurement\u2013\nconstruction contract through international competitive bidding. For Torkham and Chaman, the \nentire works will be directly contracted to the NLC (footnote 9) by an engineering\u2013procurement\u2013\nconstruction  contract.  The  NLC  as  a government  agency  and  state-owned  organization  would \noriginally not be eligible to participate in ADB-financed project. Participation of government-owned \nenterprises in ADB-funded projects is permitted provided they comply with the eligibility test set forth in \nADB's  Procurement  Guidelines. 10  The  NLC  is  not  legally  autonomous  from  the  government, \nalthough  it  has  partial  financial  autonomy  and  is  managerially  independent  from  the  FBR. \nHowever,  because  the  project  sites  are  located  in  security-sensitive  areas  on  the  border  with \nAfghanistan  to  which  private  contractors  will  have  no  access11 and  it  is  considered  that  direct \ncontracting  with  the  NLC  would  be  appropriate  subject  to  a  waiver  of  the  eligibility  criteria  as \ndiscussed  above.  The  NLC  has  technical  capacity  to  undertake  and  complete  large-scale \ninfrastructure  projects  on  a  turnkey  basis.  ADB  will  assess  the  adequacy  of  contract  prices \nunder  direct  contracting  by  benchmarking  and  referencing  the  price  of  an  engineering\u2013\nprocurement\u2013construction  contract \ninternational \ncompetitive bidding. ADB will also validate final contract prices under direct contracting through \na third-party independent validator. \n\nto  be  determined \n\nfor  Wagha \n\nthrough \n\n                                                \n10 Paragraph 1.8(c) of Procurement Guidelines states: \"Government-owned enterprises in the borrower's country may \nparticipate  as  a  bidder  only  if  they  can  establish  that  they  (i)  are  legally  and  financially  autonomous,  (ii)  operate \nunder commercial law, and (iii) are not dependent agencies of the borrower or sub-borrower.\"  \n\n11 Torkham is located in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a sanctuary of the Pakistani Taliban where the Taliban insurgency is \nentrenched.  Chaman  is  located  in  Balochistan,  where  armed  violence  from  conflicts  with  Baloch  nationalists  is \nongoing. It would be impossible for any  private contractor to have unhindered access to project sites to carry out \nconstruction  works  without  disruption  or  safety  risks.  The  cost  of  doing  so  would  be  exorbitant,  and  even  the \ngovernment would not be able to guarantee the safety of private contractors.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fThe project will require consulting services for project management, design review, and \n20. \nconstruction supervision. Consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Advance  contracting  will  be \nundertaken  to  assist  with  timely  implementation  of  the  project.  The  government  has  been \nadvised that approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\n21. \nthe project administration manual.12 \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2021 (loan closing date: 30 June 2022) \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body \n\nArrangements \nJuly 2016\u2013December 2021 \n\nIntegrated Transit Trade Management System Steering Committee \nFinance Minister (head) \nMinisters of foreign affairs, defense, railways, communication, and commerce, as well as \nconcerned federal secretaries (members) \n\n \n\nQCBS \n\n1 contract \n\nProject implementation committee \nChairperson of the FBR (head) \nSenior officers from the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Defense, as well as \nthe project director of the PMU (members)  \nFBR \nPMU under the FBR, headed by project director \nInternational competitive \nbidding \nDirect contracting  \nProject \nmanagement \nConstruction \nsupervision \nEstablishment of \nthe PLPA \nTraining of border \npoint operating \nagencies \nAdvance contracting for civil works and equipment and consulting services.  \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed \nupon between the government and ADB. \n\n2 contracts \nInternational: 90 person-months \nNational: 192 person-months \nInternational: 108 person-months \nNational: 666 person-months \nInternational: 42 person-months \nNational: 138 person-months \nInternational: 12 person-months \nNational: 132 person-months \n\n$148.4 million \n\n$12.0 million \n\n$3.0 million \n\n$3.0 million \n\nQCBS \n\nQCBS \n\nQCBS \n\n$82.5 million  \n\n$3.0 million  \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii) Implementation unit \nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nAdvance contracting \nDisbursement  \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  FBR  =  Federal  Board  of  Revenue,  PLPA  =  Pakistan  Land  Port  Authority, \nPMU = project management unit, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n22. \nBorder  sites  and  infrastructure  and  facilities  at  the  three  border  points  were  designed \nbased  on  the  following  design  parameters,  which  are  technologically  viable,  particularly  if \nsufficient space is secured to adopt them at the three border points: \n\n                                                \n12 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n(xii) \n(xiii) \n\nsegregating vehicle and passenger and bus traffic lanes; \nlaying multi-entry and multi-exit traffic lanes, and equipping each entry lane with an \ninspection booth built to the height of a truck cab window and linked to passport, \nroad transport, immigration, and customs databases; \nlaying  multi-entry  and  multi-exit  pedestrian  lanes  for  males  and  females, \ncomplete  with  walk-through  detectors,  handheld  metal  and  explosive  detectors, \nlarge-scale  baggage  scanning  equipment,  and  passport  and  visa  scanning \nequipment; \nbuilding export, import, and transit cargo processing areas complete with angled \nvehicle  parking  spaces  with  safe  paths  for  drivers  to  walk  to  the  one-stop-shop \noffice building; \ninstalling vehicle weighing machines that can also measure vehicle dimensions; \ninstalling new fit-for-purpose fixed tunnel and mobile X-ray scanning machines; \nbuilding  primary  inspection  and  safe  and  secure  secondary  vehicle  inspection \nareas; \nconstructing  an  integrated  administrative  building  for  all  border  point  operating \nagency staff and managers, with no public access; \nconstructing an office building for users such as customs brokers, banks, freight \nforwarders,  and  transport  service  providers  complete  with  ICT  connectivity, \nincluding fiber optic cable; \nbuilding  a  control  room  complete  with  closed-circuit  TV  and  accommodation  for \nmulti-agency staff; \nbuilding sanitary and phytosanitary facilities, including a disinfection facility; \ninstalling traffic signposting (bilingual or multilingual) plus electronic lane signs; and \nanticipating a 100% increase in current traffic flow and securing extra land for future \nexpansion.  \n\n23. \nFollowing the preset design parameters, new border point infrastructure and facilities at \nthe three border points will be constructed to (i) fit into site-specific geographic, topographic, and \nclimatic  environments;  (ii)  support  the  unhindered  flow  of  traffic;  (iii)  provide  safe  and  secure \nworking  environments;  (iv)  enable  a  long-lasting  power  supply  that  relies  on  a  renewable  power \ngeneration option; and (v) secure internet data connectivity to the primary customs data center \nin Karachi, to the backup customs data center in Islamabad, and among the three border points \nthat enables electronic filing of import and export documents and a paperless workflow. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nincremental  changes \n\n24. \nThe  economic  analysis  was  undertaken  on  the  proposed  modernization  of  the  three \nborder  points  in  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects. \nThe  analysis  compared \ninvestment  and  operation  and \nmaintenance costs resulting from the project, to incremental changes in journey time costs and \nnet  revenue  lost  from  delays  to  goods  vehicles  at  border  points.  The  analysis  used  2015 \ndomestic prices. The calculated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 19.5% for Torkham, \n11.4%  for  Wagha,  and  10.5%  for  Chaman,  with  an  EIRR  of  14.1%  for  all  three  border  points \ncombined,  above  the  12%  discount  rate  used  for  ADB  projects.  Wagha  and  Chaman  are \nconsidered  economically  viable  despite  EIRRs  of  less  than  12%  because  of  substantial \nunquantified benefits (e.g., improvements in security, reduction in the smuggling of illicit goods, \nand better quality facilities for users and staff). \n\nto  both \n\n25. \nThe project will build public infrastructure, the operation and maintenance cost of which \nwill  be  financed  by  fiscal  budget  allocation.  The  PLPA  will  be  established  as  a  government \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fagency to be supported by fiscal budget. However, financial planning and financial modeling for \nthe  PLPA  will  identify  possible  revenue  sources  for  the  PLPA  to  operate  and  maintain  border \npoints with minimal fiscal budgetary support. In the long term, however, the government\u2019s goal \nis to transform the PLPA into a financially self-sufficient entity like Pakistan\u2019s seaport or airport \nauthorities. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n26. \nwith  the  government  and  the  FBR.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 12). \n\nADB  and  the  World  Bank  jointly  conducted  the  FBR\u2019s  public  financial  management \n27. \nassessment. The assessment notes that the FBR has a well-defined budgeting process in terms \nof  the  annual  development  program  (development  budget).  It  has  acceptable  accounting \nstandards  for  formulating  and  reporting  the  budget,  and  for  recording  the  current  and \ndevelopment  expenditures  and  revenue  with  low  entity-specific  risks.  A  detailed  financial \nmanagement assessment was conducted for the PMU during project preparation, which noted \nthat  the  government-established  budgetary,  accounting,  financial  reporting,  and  auditing \nsystems  and  procedures  are  functioning  effectively  in  the  FBR.  On  the  whole,  the  financial \nmanagement  assessment  concludes  that  the  pre-mitigation  of  financial  management  risk  is \nimportant. Key issues include adequately staffing the PMU, building the capacity of PMU staff, \nand operationalizing the internal audit functions. \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n28. \nThe  project  aims  at  (i)  improving  border  crossing  point  infrastructure,  (ii)  reducing \nprocessing  and  dwell  times  for  cargo  clearance,  (iii)  increasing  trade  flows,  and  (iv)  improving \nthe  security  and  integrity  of  national  borders.  The  project  will  indirectly  contribute  to  curbing \npoverty,  as  the  investment  will  improve  local  economic  activity  as  well  as  increase  trade  and \ntransport  through  project  border  points  and  along  the  connector  roads.  Increased  business  in \ntrade and transportation service sectors around and along project border points will contribute to \nincreasing employment opportunities, generating revenue, and increasing the social mobility of \nthe  communities.  The  local  population  will  also  benefit,  as  they  will  be  recruited  as  workers \nduring the project\u2019s construction and operation phases.  \n\nAs of 2014, Pakistan\u2019s gender inequality index ranking was 126 out of 149 countries; the \n29. \nlabor force participation rate of women was 24.4% compared to 82.9% for men.13 Project design \nand  implementation  will  allow  for  women  to  participate  in  the  consultative  process  and  raise \ntheir  concerns.  The  project  will  be  designed  to  address  (i)  the  lack  of  women-friendly  border \nfacilities  (e.g.,  separate  toilets  for  females),  (ii)  the  lack  of  gender  sensitivity  among  border \nofficials \nthose  of  women \nentrepreneurs;  and (iii)  the  limited  (or  lack  of) female  participation  in land port  or  cross-border \noperations.  \n\nin  processing  cross-border  movement  of  goods,  especially \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n30. \nEnvironment.  The  project  has  been  categorized  as  B for  environment  as there  are  no \nmajor long-term impacts associated with the project.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) \nstudy  has  been  conducted  for  each  border  point,  which  discusses  the  likely  impacts  and \n\n                                                \n13 United Nations Development Programme. 2014. Human Development Report 2014. New York. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\frecommends  mitigation  measures  to  minimize  these  impacts.  The  environmental  impacts  of \neach  of  the  border  points  are  confined  to  the  construction  phase.  Each  IEE  contains  an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) that guides the implementation of mitigation measures \nduring  project  implementation.  Environmental  safeguards  specialists  of  the  contractors  will \nprepare  site-specific  EMPs  based  on  the  generic  EMPs.  The  construction  supervision \nconsultant\u2019s environment specialist will monitor the contractors\u2019 compliance with environmental \nsafeguards.  During  the project  implementation  stage,  the  construction  supervision  consultant\u2019s \nenvironment specialist will monitor contractor compliance with the IEEs and EMPs. \n\n31. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement. The project social safeguards impacts have been \nadequately  assessed;  the  measures  developed  in  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans \n(LARPs)  are  adequate  to address  identified  impacts.  Of the three  border  crossing  points,  only \nTorkham  and  Wagha  require  land  acquisition.  At  Chaman,  all  land  required  is  government-\nowned and unencumbered. A LARP has been prepared for each border point. Key resettlement \nimpacts include the acquisition of 115.1 acres of privately owned land (64.8 acres of agricultural \nland  at  Wagha  and  50.3  acres  of  barren  hilly  land  at  Torkham),  and  the  relocation  of  three \nresidential structures at Torkham and 42 commercial structures (28 in Chaman, 12 in Torkham, \nand 2 in Wagha). There are 91 affected households across the three subprojects, with a total of \n192 affected persons entitled to compensation. \n\nAccording to all the LARPs, (i) all impacted assets will be compensated in cash at a full \n32. \nreplacement  cost  basis;  (ii)  business  structure  owners  will  be  provided  with  replacement  land \nand/or  structures  in  the  service  and/or  business  area  in  the  improved  border  points  with  a \nsecured  tenure;  and  (iii)  affected  households  losing  residential  structures  will  reconstruct  new \nresidential structures at nearby locations of their choosing, so no off-site relocation is envisaged \nunder  the  project.  Within  the  three  subproject  areas,  no  groups  fit  the  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009)  criteria  for  indigenous  people;  local  tribal  communities  represent  the \nmainstream  culture  within  the  respective  areas.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for \ninvoluntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples.  \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.14 The risks are assessed as manageable by \nadopting  mitigating  measures,  and  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs of mitigation. \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nFew internationally \nqualified contractors and \nconsultants are interested \nin the work because of \nsecurity concerns. \nLocal tribal powers near \nthe Afghanistan border \ndisturb construction works \noutside of government's \ncontrol. \nThe executing agency \ndoes not have adequate \nexperience in \n\nMitigating Measures \nOther than in Wagha, a settled area free of security concerns, civil works will be directly \ncontracted to the NLC. By involving the NLC, which has full access to project sites and \nworking  relationships  with  other  security  agencies  like  the  Frontier  Corps  and  tribal \npowers, international consultants will have unhindered access to Torkham and Chaman \nand be given satisfactory assurance on their security. \nIn  the  course  of  project  preparation,  local  tribal  people  were  fully  engaged.  They  were \nconvinced that the project would bring huge benefits to the local community both during \nproject implementation (in the form of increased jobs from construction works) and after \ncompletion of the project (in the form of increased trade and opportunities to create local \nbusinesses). \nThe  implementation  arrangement  was  devised  to  bolster  the  executing  agency\u2019s \nknowledge of and experience with ADB\u2019s rules, procedures, and safeguard requirements. \nThe  NLC,  an  experienced  border  point  facility  designer,  builder,  and  manager,  will \n\n                                                \n14 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nimplementing ADB \nprojects, and is not yet \nconversant with ADB\u2019s \nrules, procedures, and \nsafeguard requirements. \nCountrywide law and \norder situation remains \nunstable. \n\nMitigating Measures \nconstruct  the  Torkham  and  Chaman  facilities  with  minimum  supervision  from  the  PMU. \nThe expertise of the PMU will be complemented by the project management consultant, \nwhich will be recruited externally. Safeguards capacity building of the  executing agency \nwill be included in the terms of reference of the project management consultant. \n\nThe  new  government  is  committed  to  restoring  law  and  order.  The  geopolitical \nenvironment  in  the  region  around  Pakistan  is  also  changing  to  the  benefit  of  Pakistan \n(e.g.,  the  new  governments  of  both  Afghanistan  and  India  are  actively  engaging \nPakistan, the Government of the United States continues its support of Pakistan\u2019s effort \nto  incapacitate  Taliban  forces  near  the  Afghanistan  border).  In  addition,  development \npartners are cooperating with the government in restoring law and order.   \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, NLC = National Logistics Cell, PMU = project management unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n34. \nThe government and the FBR have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n\n35. \nThe  government  and  the  FBR  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \nproject,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  loan  agreement.
