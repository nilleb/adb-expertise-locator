THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation \nRegional Improving Border Services Project.1 \n2.  The proposed project will (i) improve border crossing point infrastructure and facilities at \nChaman, Torkham, and Wagha; (ii) assist the government in establishing the Pakistan Land \nPort Authority (PLPA); and (iii) establish a border point management regime and enhance \nknowledge and skills of border point operating agencies. \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Pakistan is strategically located to connect South Asia to Central Asia and Europe, and it \nprovides the landlocked Central Asian countries with access to seaports. With this strategic \nlocation, Pakistan has the potential to be a regional transport hub. The government\u2019s national \ntrade corridor improvement program launched in 2006 realized this potential and highlights the \nimportance  of  regional  connectivity  through  improving  linkages  with  neighboring  countries. \nThe Pakistan Vision 2025 strategy embraces the country\u2019s potential as a hub and corridor of \nregional trade, and aims to help integrate the region into an interconnected market and make \nPakistan a hub of regional trade and commerce.2  \n4.  In 2011, Pakistan joined the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \nProgram. Pakistan\u2019s accession to the CAREC Program will enable subregions in Asia and \nEurope to be virtually integrated and seamlessly connected from East Asia through South Asia \nand Central Asia to Europe. In 2013, the CAREC corridors were extended to Pakistan to \nconnect Afghanistan, Central Asia, and the People\u2019s Republic of China to Gwadar and Karachi \nports  on  the  Arabian  Sea.  The  CAREC  Transport  and  Trade  Facilitation  Strategy  2020, \nendorsed  by  the  CAREC  ministers  at  the  12th  Ministerial  Conference  in  2013,  proposes \n$5.6  billion  of  investment  projects  to  build  the  extended  CAREC  corridors  in  Pakistan  to \nstreamline transport, trade logistics, customs, and other trade-related border control operations, \nwhich would increase cross-border trade in South and Central Asia.3 In tune with these various \ngovernment  visions  and  CAREC  initiatives,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country \npartnership strategy, 2015\u20132019 for Pakistan emphasizes the necessity of modernization of \ntransport infrastructure and greater regional connectivity.4 \n5.  The  performance  of  Pakistan  Customs  has  improved  substantially  since  2010. \nIn 2012, it was ranked by international freight forwarders as being the best in the Central Asia \nregion.5 In 2012, Pakistan Customs started the rollout of its Web Based One Customs system, \nwhich  has  helped  achieve  gradual  reduction  of  paperwork  and  processing  time.  Pakistan \nCustoms implements preliminary assessment of cargo pre-arrival information and uses risk \nmanagement for  selective  customs  inspections.  However,  the  performance  of  border  point \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Pakistan, Planning Commission. 2014.

Country Partnership Strategy: Pakistan, 2015\u20132019. Manila. \n5  World Bank. Doing Business: Trading Across Borders Dataset. \nhttp://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/trading-across-borders (accessed 3 July 2015); World Bank. \nLogistics Performance Index Dataset. http://lpi.worldbank.org/ (accessed 3 July 2015). \n ", "2 \nmanagement still lags behind and consequently poses a fundamental obstacle to promoting \ntransit and intraregional trade through Pakistan. The main reasons for this poor performance \ninclude the following: (i) poor infrastructure and facilities at border points; (ii) lack of governance \nstructure  in  border  point  management;  (iii)  remote  locations  of  border  points,  which  are \ngenerally in security-sensitive areas; and (iv) lack of internet service, which hinders connectivity \nto the central database of the Web Based One Customs system. \n6.  Torkham and Chaman are the major transit stations for Afghan transit trade (84% of \ncargo flows through Torkham and 16% flows through Chaman as of 2014). Traffic volume at the \nTorkham border crossing point now amounts to 700 vehicles per day.6 However, both border \npoints face challenges to meet demand for quality services, characterized by nonavailability of \nmodern  and  sufficient  physical  infrastructure,  nonavailability  of  suitable  information  and \ncommunication  technology  (ICT)  infrastructure,  poor  logistics  for  staff and  officers,  lack  of \nequipment and scanners to detect explosives, and insufficient facilities to manage movement of \npeople (estimated to be more than 25,000 people per day for Torkham). Currently, the trade \nvolume between India and Pakistan is less than $3 billion. With full normalization of their \npolitical and trade relationship, potential trade volume between the two countries would likely \ngrow substantially, and Wagha, the only open land route connecting South Asia to Central Asia, \nwill not be able to handle the trade and traffic volumes owing to a lack of infrastructure allowing \nthe transport of containerized cargo by road. \n7.  According to the CAREC corridor performance measurement and monitoring study, the \nmajor  bottleneck for transport  and trade  in the  CAREC  region  is  border  crossing  points.7 \nFor a typical 500-kilometer journey by a 20-ton truck, more than three-quarters of the total \nstopping time, or 24 hours, occurs at border crossing points, with more than 18 hours of this \ntime spent waiting for border-crossing formalities to commence.8 A significant portion of delays \nare attributable to poor physical infrastructure, low utilization of ICT for efficient border control, \nand limited supporting trade logistics facilities at the border crossing points. In Pakistan, border \ncrossing points are the worst bottlenecks for cross-border transport and trade because of poor \ninfrastructure at the border points, such as poor customs facilities, insufficient and outdated \noffice and cargo handling equipment, limited parking spaces for vehicles near border crossings, \nfrequent  power  failures,  insufficient  and  unplanned  supporting  infrastructure,  poor  ICT \ninfrastructure, and difficult terrain and uncertain road security conditions in the area of border \ncrossing. \n8.  There  is  no  legally  established  border  point  management  regime  in  Pakistan. \nAll border points are physically possessed and controlled by security forces whose only interest \nis border security, with no concern for trade facilitation. The National Logistics Cell (NLC),9 filling \nthis governance vacuum, has developed border point facilities at some border points, acting as \na custodian, and plays the role of a border point facility manager. Recognizing the necessity of a \nlegally transparent border point management regime, the government decided in April 2014 that \n                                                \n6  Pakistan and Afghanistan signed the amended Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement in 2010, which \ngives Pakistani vehicles access to Central Asian countries, and gives Afghan vehicles access to Pakistan\u2019s \nseaports and to the land port of Wagha for exports to India. \n7  ADB. 2014. Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridor Performance Measurement and Monitoring A \nForward-Looking Retrospective. Manila. \n8  In the cases of Torkham and Chaman, the waiting time is 12 hours. \n9  The  NLC  was  originally  established  in  1978  as  an  attached  department  of  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and \nDevelopment  to  manage  the  nationwide  logistics  problems  for  transportation  of  important  commodities. \nFunctionally, it is under the administrative control of the Pakistan Army. Since its establishment, it has gradually \nevolved into a state-owned organization with expanded areas of operation including development and management \nof cross-border terminals and dry ports.  \n ", "3 \nthe PLPA should be established. In February 2015, the government defined the PLPA as a \ncustodian of nationwide border points and a border point facility manager and the Federal Board \nof Revenue (FBR) has developed, through ADB\u2019s assistance, a PLPA establishment plan and a \ndraft executive order. Upon government endorsement, the executive order will be issued to \neffectively establish the PLPA, which will take the responsibility to possess and manage the \nborder point facilities of Chaman, Torkham, and Wagha that will be improved by the project. \nThe project is also designed to assist the FBR in (i) establishing the PLPA according to the \nPLPA establishment plan; and (ii) training border point operating agencies, including the PLPA. \n9.  Given the challenges facing border crossing points in Pakistan, many aid agencies have \nconducted studies, surveys, and needs assessments, particularly on the subject of simplifying \nand  harmonizing  customs  procedures,  improving  border  services,  and  modernizing  border \ncrossing  point  infrastructure.  While  some  infrastructure  improvement  projects  have  been \nundertaken to equip border points with computers, scanners, or weighbridges, these efforts \nhave  been  piecemeal  and  have  not  resulted  in  conspicuous  improvements.  To  avoid \ncoordination issues among development partners, the FBR has formed an Integrated Transit \nTrade Management System (ITTMS) Steering Committee headed by the minister for finance \nand including the ministers of commerce, foreign affairs, defense, and railways to guide the \ntrade facilitation agenda.  \n10.  When  the  project  was  conceptualized  in  2013,  ADB  adopted  a  proactive  donor \ncoordination approach, setting up and chairing a donor coordination group on trade facilitation at \nborder points; acting as a bridge between all stakeholders, including the government; and \nholding regular meetings, which improved the timely sharing of information. The coordination \nmechanism  adopted  by  ADB  enabled  donors  to  design  their  own  assistance  programs  to \ncomplement  other  donors\u2019  programs.  ADB  has  led  infrastructure  development,  while  other \ndevelopment partners have focused their attention on other areas, particularly the simplification \nand  harmonization  of  cross-border  procedures  (e.g.,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency  has  focused  on  enhancing  operational  efficiency  at  seaports  in  Karachi,  the \nInternational Finance Corporation has focused on involving the private sector, the United States \nAgency for International Development has focused on supporting capacity development, and \nthe World Bank has focused on trade reforms). The coordination efforts led by ADB in trade \nfacilitation have helped in promoting knowledge and information sharing among development \npartners, avoiding duplications of assistance, and more effectively using development resources. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the project will be an increased value of export, import, and transit trade. \nThe outcome will be reduced cross-border processing time for goods and cargo in Chaman, \nTorkham, and Wagha. \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The  outputs  will  be  (i)  improvement  of the  border  crossing  point  infrastructure  and \nfacilities at Chaman, Torkham, and Wagha; (ii) production and adoption of a national border \npoint management regime governance structure, and production and adoption of organizational \ndesign, management structure, financial and administrative procedures, and financial modeling \nfor the PLPA; and (iii) enhancement of knowledge and skills of border point operating agencies. \n13.  Infrastructure and facility development works include (i) site development, approach and \ninternal roads, bridges, and boundary walls; (ii) overhead water reservoirs, water supply, and \ndrainage  works;  (iii)  streetlights,  floodlights,  solar  power  systems,  power  supply  networks, \n ", "4 \nwatchtowers, and security gates; (iv) central administration building with separate toilets for \nmales and females, small offices, customs laboratory, passenger terminal building, service \nareas, and a business center; (v) warehouses for seized goods, tollbooths and canopies for toll \ncollection,  secondary  inspection  areas,  cargo  immigration  areas,  and  quarantine  sheds; \n(vi)  separate  male  and  female  accommodation  facilities  and  related  infrastructure;  and \n(vii) installation of ICT, security, and trade facilitation equipment. \n14.  Capacity development of border point operating agencies includes (i) legal assistance in \nsetting up the PLPA; (ii) assistance in developing organizational structures, job descriptions with \nno gender bias, and gender-sensitive standard operating procedures and compliance standards \nfor the PLPA; (iii) assistance in planning and setting up the financial model of the PLPA; \n(iv) assistance in project planning for the takeover of border point facilities by the PLPA after \ncompletion  of  construction  works;  (v)  assistance  in  developing  long-term  and  short-term \noperational  planning  for  the  PLPA,  as  well  as  a  performance  management  and  appraisal \nsystem; (vi) design and implementation of training activities for the PLPA and border point \noperating agencies; (vii) assistance in implementing capacity development plans for staff of the \nPLPA and border point operating agencies; and (viii) assistance in developing employee skills \nas well as a performance appraisal and motivation system for the PLPA and border point \noperating agencies. \nD.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR71,605,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will \nhave a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. The government has also requested a loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 21-year term, including a \ngrace period of 6 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \n(the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan), and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n ", "5 \n17.

Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The executing agency will be the FBR. The ITTMS Steering Committee headed by the \nfinance minister will act as the highest decision-making authority for project implementation \nissues  and  provide  overall  guidance  for  all  agencies  involved  in  project  implementation. \nA project management unit (PMU) headed by a project director will be established in the FBR \nthat will provide guidance on, and oversight to, the overall implementation and performance of \nthe project. The PMU\u2019s technical expertise will be complemented by the project management \nconsultant, who will be recruited externally. A project implementation committee, headed by the \nchairperson of the FBR and consisting of senior officers from the Ministry of Commerce and the \nMinistry of Defense, as well as the project director of the PMU, will be established to guide the \nPMU,  review  the  progress  of  implementation,  and  coordinate  with  relevant  ministries  and \ndepartments to resolve any project implementation problems. \n19.  Procurement of goods, civil works, and related services financed from the ADB loan will \nbe done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to \ntime).  For  Wagha,  the  entire  works  will  be  tendered  by  an  engineering\u2013procurement\u2013\nconstruction contract through international competitive bidding. For Torkham and Chaman, the \nentire works will be directly contracted to the NLC (footnote 9) by an engineering\u2013procurement\u2013\nconstruction contract. The NLC as a government agency and state-owned organization would \noriginally not be eligible to participate in ADB-financed project. Participation of government-owned \nenterprises in ADB-funded projects is permitted provided they comply with the eligibility test set forth in \nADB's  Procurement Guidelines.10 The NLC is  not  legally  autonomous from  the  government, \nalthough  it  has  partial financial  autonomy  and is  managerially  independent  from  the  FBR. \nHowever, because the project sites are located in security-sensitive areas on the border with \nAfghanistan to which private contractors will have no access11 and it is considered that direct \ncontracting with the NLC would be appropriate subject to a waiver of the eligibility criteria as \ndiscussed  above.  The  NLC  has  technical  capacity  to  undertake  and  complete  large-scale \ninfrastructure projects on a turnkey basis. ADB will assess the adequacy of contract prices \nunder  direct  contracting  by  benchmarking  and  referencing  the  price  of  an  engineering\u2013\nprocurement\u2013construction  contract  for  Wagha  to  be  determined  through  international \ncompetitive bidding. ADB will also validate final contract prices under direct contracting through \na third-party independent validator. \n                                                \n10 Paragraph 1.8(c) of Procurement Guidelines states: \"Government-owned enterprises in the borrower's country may \nparticipate as a bidder only if they can establish that they (i) are legally and financially autonomous, (ii) operate \nunder commercial law, and (iii) are not dependent agencies of the borrower or sub-borrower.\"  \n11 Torkham is located in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a sanctuary of the Pakistani Taliban where the Taliban insurgency is \nentrenched. Chaman is located in Balochistan, where armed violence from conflicts with Baloch nationalists is \nongoing. It would be impossible for any private contractor to have unhindered access to project sites to carry out \nconstruction works without disruption or safety risks. The cost of doing so would be exorbitant, and even the \ngovernment would not be able to guarantee the safety of private contractors.  \n ", "6 \n20.  The project will require consulting services for project management, design review, and \nconstruction supervision. Consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Advance contracting will be \nundertaken  to  assist  with  timely  implementation  of  the  project. The government  has  been \nadvised that approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n21.

Border sites and infrastructure and facilities at the three border points were designed \nbased  on  the  following  design  parameters,  which  are  technologically  viable,  particularly  if \nsufficient space is secured to adopt them at the three border points: \n \n \n                                                \n12 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \n(i)  segregating vehicle and passenger and bus traffic lanes; \n(ii)  laying multi-entry and multi-exit traffic lanes, and equipping each entry lane with an \ninspection booth built to the height of a truck cab window and linked to passport, \nroad transport, immigration, and customs databases; \n(iii)  laying  multi-entry  and  multi-exit  pedestrian  lanes  for  males  and  females, \ncomplete with walk-through detectors, handheld metal and explosive detectors, \nlarge-scale  baggage  scanning  equipment,  and  passport  and  visa  scanning \nequipment; \n(iv)  building export, import, and transit cargo processing areas complete with angled \nvehicle parking spaces with safe paths for drivers to walk to the one-stop-shop \noffice building; \n(v)  installing vehicle weighing machines that can also measure vehicle dimensions; \n(vi)  installing new fit-for-purpose fixed tunnel and mobile X-ray scanning machines; \n(vii)  building  primary  inspection  and  safe  and  secure  secondary  vehicle  inspection \nareas; \n(viii)  constructing an integrated administrative building for all border point operating \nagency staff and managers, with no public access; \n(ix)  constructing an office building for users such as customs brokers, banks, freight \nforwarders,  and  transport  service  providers  complete  with  ICT  connectivity, \nincluding fiber optic cable; \n(x)  building a control room complete with closed-circuit TV and accommodation for \nmulti-agency staff; \n(xi)  building sanitary and phytosanitary facilities, including a disinfection facility; \n(xii)  installing traffic signposting (bilingual or multilingual) plus electronic lane signs; and \n(xiii)  anticipating a 100% increase in current traffic flow and securing extra land for future \nexpansion.  \n23.  Following the preset design parameters, new border point infrastructure and facilities at \nthe three border points will be constructed to (i) fit into site-specific geographic, topographic, and \nclimatic environments; (ii) support the unhindered flow of traffic; (iii) provide safe and secure \nworking environments; (iv) enable a long-lasting power supply that relies on a renewable power \ngeneration option; and (v) secure internet data connectivity to the primary customs data center \nin Karachi, to the backup customs data center in Islamabad, and among the three border points \nthat enables electronic filing of import and export documents and a paperless workflow. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  The economic analysis was undertaken on the proposed modernization of the three \nborder  points  in  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects. \nThe  analysis  compared  incremental  changes  to  both  investment  and  operation  and \nmaintenance costs resulting from the project, to incremental changes in journey time costs and \nnet revenue lost from delays to goods vehicles at  border points. The analysis used 2015 \ndomestic prices. The calculated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 19.5% for Torkham, \n11.4% for Wagha, and 10.5% for Chaman, with an EIRR of 14.1% for all three border points \ncombined,  above  the  12%  discount rate  used for  ADB  projects.  Wagha  and  Chaman  are \nconsidered  economically  viable  despite  EIRRs  of  less  than  12%  because  of  substantial \nunquantified benefits (e.g., improvements in security, reduction in the smuggling of illicit goods, \nand better quality facilities for users and staff). \n25.  The project will build public infrastructure, the operation and maintenance cost of which \nwill be financed by fiscal budget allocation. The PLPA will be established as a government \n ", "8 \nagency to be supported by fiscal budget. However, financial planning and financial modeling for \nthe PLPA will identify possible revenue sources for the PLPA to operate and maintain border \npoints with minimal fiscal budgetary support. In the long term, however, the government\u2019s goal \nis to transform the PLPA into a financially self-sufficient entity like Pakistan\u2019s seaport or airport \nauthorities. \nC.  Governance \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  FBR.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 12). \n27.  ADB and the World Bank jointly conducted the FBR\u2019s public financial management \nassessment. The assessment notes that the FBR has a well-defined budgeting process in terms \nof  the  annual  development  program  (development  budget).  It  has  acceptable  accounting \nstandards  for  formulating  and  reporting  the  budget,  and  for  recording  the  current  and \ndevelopment  expenditures  and  revenue  with  low  entity-specific  risks.  A  detailed  financial \nmanagement assessment was conducted for the PMU during project preparation, which noted \nthat  the  government-established  budgetary,  accounting,  financial  reporting,  and  auditing \nsystems and procedures are functioning effectively in the FBR. On the whole, the financial \nmanagement assessment concludes that the pre-mitigation of financial management risk is \nimportant. Key issues include adequately staffing the PMU, building the capacity of PMU staff, \nand operationalizing the internal audit functions. \nD.  Poverty and Social \n28.  The  project  aims  at  (i)  improving  border  crossing  point  infrastructure,  (ii)  reducing \nprocessing and dwell times for cargo clearance, (iii) increasing trade flows, and (iv) improving \nthe security and integrity of national borders. The project will indirectly contribute to curbing \npoverty, as the investment will improve local economic activity as well as increase trade and \ntransport through project border points and along the connector roads. Increased business in \ntrade and transportation service sectors around and along project border points will contribute to \nincreasing employment opportunities, generating revenue, and increasing the social mobility of \nthe communities. The local population will also benefit, as they will be recruited as workers \nduring the project\u2019s construction and operation phases.  \n29.  As of 2014, Pakistan\u2019s gender inequality index ranking was 126 out of 149 countries; the \nlabor force participation rate of women was 24.4% compared to 82.9% for men.13 Project design \nand implementation will allow for women to participate in the consultative process and raise \ntheir concerns. The project will be designed to address (i) the lack of women-friendly border \nfacilities (e.g., separate toilets for females), (ii) the lack of gender sensitivity among border \nofficials  in  processing  cross-border  movement  of  goods,  especially  those  of  women \nentrepreneurs; and (iii) the limited (or lack of) female participation in land port or cross-border \noperations.  \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  Environment. The project has been categorized as B for environment as there are no \nmajor long-term impacts associated with the project.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) \nstudy  has  been  conducted  for  each  border  point,  which  discusses  the  likely  impacts  and \n                                                \n13 United Nations Development Programme. 2014. Human Development Report 2014. New York. \n ", "9 \nrecommends mitigation measures to minimize these impacts. The environmental impacts of \neach  of  the  border  points  are  confined  to  the  construction  phase.  Each  IEE  contains  an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) that guides the implementation of mitigation measures \nduring  project  implementation.  Environmental  safeguards  specialists  of  the  contractors  will \nprepare  site-specific  EMPs  based  on  the  generic  EMPs.  The  construction  supervision \nconsultant\u2019s environment specialist will monitor the contractors\u2019 compliance with environmental \nsafeguards. During the project implementation stage, the construction supervision consultant\u2019s \nenvironment specialist will monitor contractor compliance with the IEEs and EMPs. \n31.  Land acquisition and resettlement. The project social safeguards impacts have been \nadequately assessed; the measures developed in the land acquisition and resettlement plans \n(LARPs) are adequate to address identified impacts. Of the three border crossing points, only \nTorkham and Wagha require land acquisition. At Chaman, all land required is government-\nowned and unencumbered. A LARP has been prepared for each border point. Key resettlement \nimpacts include the acquisition of 115.1 acres of privately owned land (64.8 acres of agricultural \nland at Wagha and 50.3 acres of barren hilly land at Torkham), and the relocation of three \nresidential structures at Torkham and 42 commercial structures (28 in Chaman, 12 in Torkham, \nand 2 in Wagha). There are 91 affected households across the three subprojects, with a total of \n192 affected persons entitled to compensation. \n32.  According to all the LARPs, (i) all impacted assets will be compensated in cash at a full \nreplacement cost basis; (ii) business structure owners will be provided with replacement land \nand/or structures in the service and/or business area in the improved border points with a \nsecured tenure; and (iii) affected households losing residential structures will reconstruct new \nresidential structures at nearby locations of their choosing, so no off-site relocation is envisaged \nunder  the  project.  Within  the  three  subproject  areas,  no  groups  fit  the  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009)  criteria  for  indigenous  people;  local  tribal  communities  represent  the \nmainstream culture within the respective areas. The project is classified as category B for \ninvoluntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples.  \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.14 The risks are assessed as manageable by \nadopting  mitigating  measures,  and  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs of mitigation. \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nFew internationally  Other than in Wagha, a settled area free of security concerns, civil works will be directly \nqualified contractors and  contracted to the NLC.
