(SZWG)  and \nShenzhen  Water  and  Environment  Investment  Group  Co.,  Ltd.  (SZWEIC)  for  the  Climate-\nResilient and Smart Urban Water Infrastructure Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n \n2. \nThe  proposed  project  will  support  SZWG\u2019s  investment  in  multiple  water  supply  and \nwastewater treatment facilities with smart water technologies and climate- and disaster-resilient \nurban water infrastructure in Shenzhen and third- and fourth-tier cities in the PRC.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProject identification. The PRC is one of the world\u2019s most water-stressed countries. Per \ncapita water resources are about one-quarter of the global average,2 and 25% of its water bodies \ndo not meet minimum drinking water quality standards.3 By 2030, the country will need up to 20% \nmore in total water supply than it did in 2014, with a rapid increase in urban water demand.4 Water \nscarcity is exacerbated by climate change and surface water and groundwater pollution. Climatic \nchanges can alter the seasonality of rainfall and intensify extreme precipitation events, straining \ndrainage  and  sewerage  infrastructure  and  heightening  the  risks  of  urban  flooding.5 Enhancing \nresilience to extreme weather events associated with climate change is an emerging priority for \ncities in the PRC. \n \n4. \nIn response, the Government of the PRC launched a national \u201csponge city\u201d program in \n2015.  The  country\u2019s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan  (2016\u20132020)  for  the  Development  of  Strategic \nEmerging Industries emphasized greater use of smart water systems.6 A \u201csponge city\u201d is a city \nwith  a  water  infrastructure  system  that  is  capable  of  absorbing,  harvesting,  storing,  filtering, \npurifying, and slowly releasing or reusing urban runoff\u2014in effect, acting like a sponge. A sponge \ncity is designed to soak up heavy rainfall and flooding and, when needed, release stored water to \nmake  it  available  for  beneficial  use.  In  these  ways,  a  sponge  city  helps  to  ensure  safe  urban \ndrainage,  avoid  flooding,  reuse  rainwater,  and  protect  the  environment.  Smart  water  solutions \nutilize technological innovation to improve water quality and supply, reduce leakages, enhance \nwastewater treatment and reuse, support monitoring and evaluation, improve customer services, \nand reduce energy consumption. \n \n5. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has long supported capacity development in areas \nof  water  supply,  wastewater  management,  integrated  water  resource  management,  flood  risk \nmanagement,  and  enabling  the  environment  for  private  sector  participation.  Recent  examples \ninclude ADB assistance for preparing (i) an outline strategy to promote smart water approaches \nin a comprehensive integrated urban water system for Tianjin Municipality, (ii) a nationwide long-\n\n \n\n1  Third- and fourth-tier cities are generally cities smaller than and ranked below provincial capital cities. \n2  National Bureau of Statistics of China.

In  2018,  SZWG  participated  in  an  ADB  sponge  city  dissemination \nworkshop and requested ADB assistance to partially fund its 2020\u20132023 investment plan. SZWG \nis committed to making its investments more resilient to climate change and sharing knowledge \nit has gained in Shenzhen with third- and fourth-tier cities in the PRC. \n \n6. \nProject  design.  The  loan  will  finance  multiple  urban  water  subprojects  that  support \nsponge  city  development  to  enhance  climate  resilience,  or  apply  smart  water  technology  to \nimprove  efficiency  in  the  water  value  chain  from  the  supply  end  to  wastewater  treatment.  The \nproject  is  designed  to  be  cost-effective  in  financing  multiple  subprojects.  Subprojects  will  be \nidentified  during  the  project  implementation  period  between  2020  and  2023.  ADB  will  extend \nfinancing on a subproject-by-subproject basis. \n \n7. \nEligibility  criteria.  The  majority  (60%)  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  in  third-  and \nfourth-tier  cities,  while the  rest  will  be  used  in  Shenzhen.  All  subprojects should meet  climate-\nresilient  and  smart  water  technique  and  technology  requirements  and  pre-agreed  eligibility \ncriteria. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n8. \nThe sponsor and borrowers. SZWG is the project\u2019s sponsor and guarantor, and SZWG \nand SZWEIC are the co-borrowers. Established in 2001, SZWG is a water utility that provides \ncomprehensive water solutions and services that include urban water system management and \nwastewater  treatment  and  network  maintenance.  The  Shenzhen  Municipal  Government  is  the \nmajority  owner  of  SZWG  (55%),  with  the  remaining  shares  held  indirectly  by  Veolia \nEnvironnement S.A. (25%)7 and Beijing Capital Co., Ltd. (20%).8 SZWEIC is a SZWG investment \nplatform established in 2005 to develop, invest, and implement subprojects outside of Shenzhen. \nSZWEIC is owned by SZWG (70%) and the Shenzhen Municipal Government\u2019s investment arm, \nShenzhen Capital Co., Ltd. (30%). \n \n9. \nSZWG  plans  to  upgrade  the  technologies  of  water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment \nfacilities to reduce nonrevenue water, optimize energy efficiency, and enhance service quality. It \nwill also strengthen long-term monitoring and evaluation of urban water systems. The resulting \nimproved  operational  efficiency  and  reduced  water  losses  will  lower  energy  consumption  and \ncarbon emissions. \n \n10. \nSZWG\u2019s sponge city development will be guided by modeling of surface water, weather \npatterns, drainage systems, and groundwater. It will involve low-impact development techniques \nsuch  as  the  use  of  wetlands,  permeable  pavements,  rainwater  gardens,  green  roofs,  storage \nfacilities, wastewater reuse, and managed aquifer recharge. Sponge city development can also \nincorporate  advanced  early  warning  systems  for  floods,  weather  events,  and  pollution.  The \nsponge city is expected to contribute to climate and disaster resilience, mainly by reducing the \nseverity  of  the  urban  flooding  caused  by  excessive  rainfall  and  droughts  through  storing  and \nreleasing runoff in a more ecologically functional way. \n\n \n\n7  Veolia  Environnement  S.A.  has been  the  sponsor  in  previous  ADB-funded  projects.

As of 2019, SZWG was managing 88 water supply plants with an aggregate \ndaily design capacity of 9.8 million cubic meters and 41 wastewater treatment plants with total \ncapacity of 4.0 million cubic meters. These plants served more than 30 million people across 22 \ncities in seven provinces. SZWG is the first PRC water company to produce and distribute high-\nquality  potable  water  to  households  using  a  water  safety  plan  for  streamlined  water  quality \nmanagement through automation. In addition, SZWG has invested in research and development \nin collaboration with PRC universities and owned 52 patents and 62 utility models as of 2019.  \n \n12. \nSZWG  has  completed two  sponge  city  projects and  is  keen  to  learn from  industry  best \npractices. Although SZWG has made significant progress on smart water solutions, most of them \nhave  focused  on  e-payment  and  digitalized  monitoring.  SZWG  has  taken  initial  steps  to  apply \nsmart water technology for climate change mitigation to reduce energy consumption. SZWG is \nalso committed to improving its approaches to social and environmental management and gender \ninclusiveness, and has participated in knowledge-sharing events organized by ADB. \n \nADB  conducted  integrity  due  diligence. 9 SZWG  and  SZWEIC  and  their  shareholders, \n13. \nboards  of  directors,  and  managers  do  not  appear  to  constitute  a  significant  or  potentially \nsignificant integrity risk, since no significant unresolved or substantiated adverse media or other \nrelevant information is related to them. Tax integrity due diligence was not required. \n \n14. \nPandemic  impacts.  The  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  highlights  the \nimportance and preventive power of water, sanitation, and hygiene in sustaining human health \nand well-being. The pandemic has not had a material impact on SZWG\u2019s project costs or capacity. \nUsing digital solutions such as automation and remote monitoring, SZWG provided water supply \nand  wastewater  treatment  services  during  the  first  quarter  of  2020  without  interruption.  The \npandemic\u2019s potential impact on municipal governments involved was not fully assessed during \nproject processing. However, ADB\u2019s support for crucial infrastructure through a nonsovereign loan \nis  expected  to  help  local  governments  ensure  climate  consciousness  in  economic  recovery \nefforts, and the subprojects will provide local jobs. \n \nB. \n \n15. \necosystems improved, and climate resilience enhanced in the PRC.10 \n \n16. \nwater management in the PRC expanded. \n \nOutputs. The project will have three outputs: (i) climate-resilient and smart urban water \n17. \nsystems in selected cities constructed or rehabilitated; (ii) knowledge of sponge city and smart \nwater technology application that promotes increased resilience of women to climate change and \ndisasters  increased;  and  (iii)  SZWG\u2019s  gender  inclusiveness  improved.

By supporting greater gender \ninclusiveness  at  SZWG,  the  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  operational  priority  2 \n(accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality).  The  project  will  include  a  gender  action  plan.  It  is \naligned with operational priority 3 (tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, \nand enhancing environmental sustainability) by supporting the establishment of sponge cities to \naddress flood risks and improving energy efficiency through the use of smart water technologies. \nBy supporting water quality improvements, reducing pollution, and enhancing water  efficiency \nin PRC cities, the project is also aligned with operational priority 4 (livable cities). The project \nsupports the strategic priorities of ADB\u2019s water operational plan 2011\u20132020 and the objectives \nlaid  out  in  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  2016\u20132020  to  manage  climate \nchange and the environment and to develop green cities.11 \n \n19. \nLessons from previous operations. The ADB-supported Jiangxi\u2013Pingxiang Integrated \nRural\u2013Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Project  showed  that  rigorous  demand  analyses  and \neffective policy dialogue on cost recovery benefited urban water planning and ensured investment \nsustainability. 12  ADB\u2019s  Jilin  Yanji  Low-Carbon  Climate-Resilient  Healthy  City  Project \ndemonstrated that sponge city infrastructure yielded multiple benefits, including effective defense \nagainst flooding; better water absorption filtering and purifying; increased biodiversity; and a more \nconducive  environment  for  recreation,  walking,  and  cycling.13 In  light  of  progress  achieved  on \nsustainable  green  growth,  ADB  should  support  the  transformation  of  traditional  urban  water \nutilities into comprehensive water environmental management providers and mobilize investment \nfrom the private sector to support sustainable development. \n \nD. \n \n20. \n \n21. \n \nE. \n \n22. \n \n\nTable 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nTable 2: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nFor each subproject outside of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, \nSZWG or SZWEIC will enter into an agreement with the municipal \ngovernment under a form of public\u2013private partnership.

EARD and PSOD subsequently worked together with the company to \nprocess this nonsovereign operation. ADB supported SZWG\u2019s efforts to obtain a shadow credit \nrating  from  Standard  &  Poor\u2019s,  which,  with  the  underscoring  of  support  from  the  Shenzhen \nMunicipal Government, improved its credit rating in ADB\u2019s pricing tools.14 In addition, the Water \nSector Group  of  Sustainable  Development  and Climate  Change  Department  (SDCC)  provided \nadvice on climate-resilient and smart water techniques and technologies. The combination of the \nsector knowledge of EARD and SDCC and PSOD\u2019s transaction expertise and skills has provided \n\n14  ADB. 2017.

The loan has a maturity of up to 10 years \n[CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION  DELETED].  The  loan  will  be channeled  through  shareholder \nloans or equity investments to subprojects controlled by SZWG and SZWEIC. \n \nDuring the life of the loan, SZWG, SZWEIC, and their subproject companies are bound by \n26. \nfinancial, operational, and safeguards covenants stipulated in the facility agreement, including the \nsubmission  to  ADB  of  regular  monitoring  reports  on  finance,  operations,  development \neffectiveness, and requirements to meet covenants typical for this type of transaction. \n \nB. \n \n27. \n \n\nADB\u2019s assistance provides the following additionality: \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nFinancial  additionality.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  is  designed  to  improve  efficiency  by \nbundling subprojects that are too small or costly to be financed on a stand-alone \nbasis. Without ADB support, SZWG would have to raise financing for each separate \nsubproject through the local branches of commercial banks where the subproject is \nlocated. ADB adds value by linking the cluster of projects with the wider financing \ncommunity,  including  international  financial  institutions.  ADB\u2019s  facility  will  have  a \ncatalytic  role  in  mobilizing  private  sector  resources  through  various  cofinancing \narrangements during project implementation. \nNonfinancial additionality. ADB\u2019s engagement will promote gender inclusiveness \nin  SZWG\u2019s  operations  and  support  knowledge  that  increases  the  resilience  of \nwomen to climate change and disasters through the gender action plan. This will \nmake  SZWG\u2019s  human  resource  management  policy  more  supportive  of  gender \nmainstreaming, and the number of women managers at SZWG will increase. ADB \nwill also enhance SZWG\u2019s environmental and social management system (ESMS) \nas a condition precedent to the first loan disbursement. \n\n(iii)  Knowledge  sharing.  Based  on  ADB\u2019s  continuous  knowledge  sharing  and  policy \ndialogue  with  the  Government  of  the  PRC  (para.  5),  the  project  will  have  a \ndemonstration impact and disseminate knowledge for the industry beyond SZWG. \nADB and SZWG will co-organize knowledge events to promote regional and global \nlearning on climate-resilient and smart water infrastructure. \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n29. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  A  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \n\n6 \n \n\n \n28. \n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n \n\nindigenous peoples.15 Potential environmental and social impacts have been identified. Although \nADB does not anticipate category A involuntary displacement impacts from SZWG subprojects, \nthis classification will enable SZWG to utilize ADB loan proceeds to address any displacement of \nmore than 200 people by any sponge city subproject. Consolidated measures to avoid, minimize, \nmitigate,  and  compensate  affected  people  for  potential  adverse  impacts  are  in  the  safeguard \nreports  and  management  plans.  SZWG  has  sufficient  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  to \nmanage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts.  \n \nEnvironmental and social audit findings and recommendations. An external expert \n30. \nundertook due diligence in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements for \ngeneral corporate finance. Due diligence included a corporate audit of SZWG\u2019s ESMS and four \nsite  audits  at  water,  wastewater  treatment,  and  sponge  city  facilities.  The  corporate  audit \ndetermined that SZWG was in compliance with applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions \nin which it operates. However, in terms of the objectives, principles, and requirements of ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement, some gaps were identified. The company\u2019s environmental and social \nsystems, processes, and practices were assessed as commensurate with the risks and impacts \nassociated with its business and operations. The aspects reviewed during due diligence include \nodor  and  noise  nuisance,  waste  management,  hazardous  substance  management,  sludge \ndisposal, and occupational health and safety. SZWG did not have a land procurement procedure \nin place to identify and manage unresolved or potential future displacement impacts. This was \ndue largely to the fact that municipal governments carry out land procurement in the PRC and \naward land-use rights under concession agreements. As SZWG has not had and does not expect \nto have adverse or beneficial impacts on ethnic minority groups, its consideration of such groups \nin subproject planning was based on national law. \n \n31. \n \n32. \nSZWG has agreed to all audit findings and recommendations, which were reflected in the \nproject\u2019s  corrective  action  plan.  As  an  initial  action,  SZWG,  assisted  by  ADB,  will  develop  an \nESMS that satisfies ADB requirements. ADB assistance has included drafting of specific ESMS \nprocedures, and ADB will also support staff training. The ESMS will include an environmental and \nsocial  compliance  audit  procedure  for  SZWG  to  confirm  that  subprojects  utilizing  ADB  loan \nproceeds  comply  with  ADB  requirements.  SZWG  will  submit  each  subproject  audit  to  ADB  for \napproval before disbursement. Compliance audits will be disclosed on the ADB website. SZWG \nwill  submit  annual  reports  on  each  ADB-financed  subproject  to  ADB  to  confirm  ongoing \ncompliance with ADB requirements set out in the ESMS. \n \n33. \nEffective gender mainstreaming. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development \n(1998), SZWG has incorporated measures to promote gender equality and/or the empowerment \nof women in its business activities.  ADB conducted a gender analysis of SZWG during project \npreparation. The gender action plan calls for (i) increasing the number of women in mid-level or \nhigh-level management; (ii) developing SZWG\u2019s human resource policy to include measures that \nincrease  the  proportion  of  women  staff  recruited,  retained,  and  promoted;  (iii)  increasing  the \nproportion of female employees participating in professional training that can help advance their \ncareers;  and  (iv)  developing  a  knowledge  product  on  how  sponge  city  and  smart  water \ntechnologies  can  help  women  become  more  resilient  to  the  effects  of  climate  change  and \ndisasters. SZWG will submit periodic reports on the implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \n\n [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\n15 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAnticorruption Policy \n\nSZWG will (i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, (ii) ensure that investments \n34. \nusing ADB funds comply with the Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by national laws and \nregulations,  and  (iii)  establish  and  maintain  an  ESMS  that  is  satisfactory  to  ADB  before  loan \ndisbursement.  The  ESMS  requires  implementation  of  applicable  national  labor  laws  and \nregulations, in accordance with the labor elements of ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001). \nThe ESMS also contains requirements, as applicable, for information disclosure and consultation \nwith affected people following ADB requirements. SZWG will regularly report to ADB confirming \n(i) its and its subprojects\u2019 compliance with such laws and (ii) the measures taken. \n \nB. \n \n35. \nSZWG was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n \n36. \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n \nConsistent with the \u2018Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank\u2019 (the Charter),16 \n37. \nADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the  Government  of  the \nPRC  has  no  objection to  the  proposed  assistance  to  SZWG  and  SZWEIC.  ADB  will  enter  into \nsuitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of \nthe proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors.  \n \n\nThe proposed direct loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nAssurances \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n38. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  up  to \n$200,000,000  equivalent  in  yuan  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  Shenzhen  Water \n(Group)  Co.,  Ltd.  and  Shenzhen  Water  and  Environment  Investment  Group  Co.,  Ltd.  for  the \nClimate-Resilient and Smart Urban Water Infrastructure Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nwith  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  this \nreport, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n\nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n\n \n3 August 2020 \n\n16 ADB. 1966.
