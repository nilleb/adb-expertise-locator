The project aligns with the National \nMedium-term Development Plan (RPJMN), 2015\u20132019, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  Indonesia,  2016\u20132019,  which  highlights  the  critical  role  of \nvocational  and  tertiary  education  in  providing  the  skilled  human  capital  needed  to  support \nIndonesia\u2019s economic growth.2 The impact of the project is increased income and productivity of \nthe working age population. The outcome will be strengthened access, relevance, and quality of \ntargeted universities. The project has two outputs (i) market-responsive programs delivered; and \n(ii)  training  of  technical-and-vocational-education-and-training  (TVET)  teachers  improved.  The \ntotal  cost  for  the  project  is  $266.52  million,  with  $200  million  financed  by  a  loan  from  ADB. \nImplementation of the project starts in 2019. The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) \nfor  $1.15  million,  to  be  financed  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction,  will  support \nimplementation of the project.3 The project and the TA align with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which calls \nfor improving education.4 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nJustification \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  loan  project  will  support  the  construction  and  upgrading  of  new  facilities  that \n2. \nincorporate  green-building  and  climate-proofing  design  features.  It  will  also  strengthen  staff \ncapacity at the universities and support demand-driven quality education and research aligned \nwith  local  economic  priorities.  To  achieve  these  goals,  the  following  areas  need  to  be \nstrengthened: (i) linking universities with industry in research and education, (ii) measuring and \nmonitoring  quality  and  relevance  of  education  and  research,  and  (iii)  collaboration  with \ninternational partners and stakeholders. The transaction TA will support implementation of these \ninnovative  elements  in  the  initial  stage  of  the  loan  project.  This  will  include  the  introduction  of \nnational  and  international  best  practices  in  research  and  education  and  the  development  of  a \nmedium-term  higher-education  investment  plan  and  a  medium-term  strategy  to  educate  TVET \nteachers. The TA will also support the assessment of pilots in entrepreneurship and technology \nthat  will  benefit  higher  education.

The TA \nwill build the capacity of the project management unit in the Ministry of Research, Technology \nand Higher Education (MORTHE) and the project implementation units in the universities to apply \nthese principles. \n \n7. \nCenters of excellence. To support the development of centers of excellence under each \nuniversity,  the  TA  will  provide  international  short-term  expertise  to  introduce  international  best \npractices on an as-needed basis. \n \n8. \nGovernance capacity. To instill international best practices and strengthen governance \nof  universities,  the  TA  will  collaborate  with  the  Human  Capital  and  Education  for  Asian \nDevelopment  Foundation,  a  renowned  international  think  tank  with  rich  experience  in  higher \neducation in Asia and a knowledge partner of ADB.  \n \n9. \nStrategy  formulation:  Medium-term  investment  plan  for  higher  education.  To \nimplement  the  RPJMN,  2020\u20132024,  which  is  currently  under  preparation,  the  TA  will  provide \nexpertise to the MORTHE and other stakeholders to support and facilitate collaborative strategy \ndevelopment for investment in higher education.  \n \n10. \nStrategy  formulation:  Medium-term  strategy  to  educate  technical-and-vocational-\neducation-and-training  teachers.  The  center  of  excellence  in  the  Indonesia  University  of \nEducation will focus on TVET-teacher education. In line with the RPJMN, 2020\u20132024, the TA will \nsupport  development  of a  medium-term  strategy to  educate TVET  teachers  both for  in-service \nand  pre-service  training.  The  development  of  this  strategy  will  be  undertaken  in  close \ncollaboration with the MORTHE, the Ministry of Education and Culture, and other stakeholders. \n\n                                                 \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 October 2017. \n\n\f3 \n\nKnowledge  management.  The  TA  will  support  the  MORTHE  and  the  universities  to \n11. \nestablish knowledge management for the loan project, including a project website, outreach, and \npublications. This includes a solid communications plan for the centers of excellence. \n \nOutput 2: Entrepreneurship and technology pilot assessments in higher education \n12. \nprepared.  The  TA  will  assess  innovative  approaches  in  entrepreneurship  and  technology \nimplemented in Indonesia. The results of these assessments will inform the development of new \neducation programs and initiate policy dialogue.6 The following three assessments are proposed: \n \n\n(i)  Evaluation  of  innovative  entrepreneurship  programs  and  programs  to  link \nuniversity\u2013industry  linkage  programs.  Indonesia  aims  to  strengthen  its  capacity  for \nentrepreneurship.  The  TA  will  support  an  evaluation  of  four  or  five  entrepreneurship \nprograms and/or programs to link universities with industry. This will include programs run \nby  (a)  the  Japan  International  Corporation  Agency;  (b)  the  Asian  Entrepreneurship \nTraining Program, supported by the Zurich University of Applied Sciences and the Swiss \nFederal  Institute  of  Technology;  and  (c)  private  initiatives. 7  The  TA  will  support \nindependent  evaluations  of  these  programs  to  develop  lessons  learned  for  higher-\neducation institutions and future entrepreneurship programs. \n \n\n(ii)  Skills  for  a  new  technology  sector.  The  TA  will  support  a  holistic  analysis  of  labor \ndemand and supply trends in a selected industry to fully understand its challenges. The \nelectricity sector is proposed, as it is an important sector in Indonesia that is undergoing \nrapid change because of new technological developments. It is also a sector in which ADB \nprovides  significant  support.  Future  needs  will  be  influenced  by  expansion,  a  shift  to \nsustainable energy, and the introduction of smart systems. The approach will build upon \nlessons learned from an earlier study conducted on demand and supply in the maritime \nsector by the Education Sector Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership.8 A local \nnongovernment organization with a strong grassroots network will be engaged to conduct \nthe analysis. \n \n\n(iii) Improving  employability.  The  TA  will  support  analytical  work  to  identify  how  the \nemployability  of  graduates  can  improve.  The  TA  will  build  upon  the  experiences  and \nresults of the pilots, which are planned for 2019. In these pilots, a program to support the \ntransition from school to work for graduates and a program to support upskilling of workers \nwill be tested. 9 Based upon the lessons learned from these pilots, the proposed TA will \n\n                                                 \n6   These pilot assessments will not have any impact on the environment. \n7   The  Japan  International  Corporation  Agency  programs  were  or  are  implemented  in  Gadjah  Mada  University, \nHasanuddin  University,  and \nInstitute  of  Surabaya.  The  Asian \nEntrepreneurship Training Program aims to provide targeted coaching during a few intensive working sessions in \nwhich joint Swiss and Indonesian teams work on their proposals. The program is a pilot within the Swiss bilateral \nScience and Technology Cooperation with Asia (funded by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and \nInnovation) and is planned for implementation in 2019. A possible national private program would be Lingkaran's \nBusiness  Starter  Pack  program,  a  3-month  short  course  for  budding  entrepreneurs  in  Jakarta.  Lingkaran  is  an \neducational community which offers entrepreneurship training programs in the creative industry.  \n\nthe  Electronic  Engineering  Polytechnic \n\n8   ADB. 2010.
