Subprogram 2, included in the 2019 pipeline of the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  country  operations  business  plan  for  Uzbekistan,  2019\u20132021,  is  fully  aligned  with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2019\u20132023 and one of the key operational priorities under \nStrategy  2030  in  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity  for  public  management \nreforms.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n3. \nUzbekistan  is  a  landlocked  and  lower-middle-income  economy  in  Central  Asia  with  a \npopulation of 33 million  and a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of $1,550 as of 2018. \nAfter  independence  from  the  Soviet  Union  in  1991,  Uzbekistan  has  pursued  an  import-\nsubstitution model, implemented through state investments and directed credit to SOEs; foreign \nexchange  controls;  and  tariff  and  nontariff  barriers  on  foreign  trade.  The  SOEs  have  enjoyed \npreferential access to physical and financial resources while being sheltered from domestic and \nexternal competition. Under this model, Uzbekistan had an average GDP growth of over 7% per \nannum  during  2010\u20132016,  driven  by  (i)  strong  global  demand  for  its  export  products  (copper, \nnatural  gas,  gold,  and  cotton);  (ii)  disciplined  macroeconomic  management;  and  (iii)  a  strong \nfiscal  position,  which  was  partially  the  result  of  limited  exposure  to  world  financial  markets. \nBuoyant  export  performance,  aided  by  high  commodity  prices,  helped  generate  budgetary \nrevenues  that  financed  large-scale  infrastructure  investment  and  industrial  modernization. \nRemittances of the Uzbek migrant workers, mainly from the Russian Federation, and increases \nin public sector wages and pensions supported consumption growth. \n \n4. \nThe  real  GDP  growth  in  Uzbekistan  decelerated  from  6.1%  in  2016  to  4.5%  in  2017 \nbecause  of  the  adverse  effects  of  the  declining  global  commodity  prices,  subdued  growth  in \nexport  destination  countries, 4  and  the  economic  downturn  in  the  Russian  Federation. 5  In \nresponse,  the  government  initiated  countercyclical  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  to  stimulate \n\n                                                \n1  ADB.  2018.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Programmatic \nApproach, Policy-Based Loan for Subprogram 1, and Technical Assistance Grant to the Republic of Uzbekistan for \nthe  Economic  Management  Improvement  Program.  Manila  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \nAppendix 2). Subprogram 1 ($300 million) was approved on 26 June 2018 with attached technical assistance (TA).  \n\n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB. 2018.

Manila. \n\n4  Uzbekistan\u2019s  main  export  destination  countries  were  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  the  Russian  Federation, \n\nKazakhstan and Turkey in 2018.  \n\n5  Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fdemand,  including  comprehensive  exchange  rate  reform  to  resolve  the  distortions  associated \nwith limited access to foreign exchange, a key deterrent to foreign investment and private sector \ndevelopment. The reforms liberalized the foreign exchange market in September 2017 to allow \nunfettered  access  to  foreign  currency  and  unified  multiple  exchange  rates.  However, \ndevaluation  of  the  local  currency  by  48%  and  changes  in  relative  prices  because  of  price \nliberalization, led to rising inflation from 8.8% in 2016 to 13.9% in 2017 and to 17.5% in 2018. \nReflecting  adjustments  in  prices  and  subsequent  tariff  hikes  of  utilities,  upward  pressure  on \nprices remains, with inflation projected at 14.7% in 2019 and 14.1% in 2020.6 \n \n5. \nOn the  positive  side,  Uzbekistan\u2019s  macroeconomic  stance  has remained  prudent.  Real \nGDP  growth  has  accelerated  to  5.1%  in  2018,  driven  by  industry  and  services  on  the  supply \nside  and  by  public  investments  on  the  demand  side.  The  GDP  growth  is  projected  at  5.5%  in \n2019 and 6% in 2020. Given Uzbekistan\u2019s historically conservative fiscal policy, its risk of debt \nstress  has  remained  low  despite  the  devaluation  of  the  currency.  The  external  debt  stood  at \n34.5%  of GDP  in  2018, and  public  debt  at  20.6%  of GDP,  and the foreign  exchange reserves \nhave  provided  a  healthy  buffer  against  external  economic  shocks.7 The  government  launched \ncomprehensive  tax  reform  in  2018; 8  started  consolidating  and  reporting  on-  and  off-budget \ntransactions in 2019; and launched a debut eurobond in February 2019. \n \n6. \nNotwithstanding  these  positive  steps,  several  long-standing  developmental  constraints \nhave  required  a  more  comprehensive  PFM  and  governance  reform  approach  to  transform \nUzbekistan\u2019s  economy  into  an  open  and  diversified  structure  and  improve  its  resilience  to \nmacroeconomic shocks. These constraints are summarized in paras. 7\u201310. \n \nInefficient macroeconomic and fiscal management. Based on public expenditure and \n7. \nfinancial accountability (PEFA) assessment of macroeconomic and PFM systems,9 Uzbekistan\u2019s \nstanding has been weak with respect to (i) oversight and management of fiscal risks from public \nsector  entities;  (ii)  effectiveness  of  internal  and  external  audit;  (iii)  quality  and  timeliness  of \nannual  financial  statements;  (iv)  medium-term  fiscal  framework  to  ensure  a  multiyear \nperspective in fiscal policy, planning, and budgeting; and (v) competition, value for money, and \ncontrols  in  procurement.  The  data  collection,  analysis,  and  dissemination  systems  also  need \nmodernizing to enable informed decision-making in macroeconomic planning and management. \n \n8. \nLarge  public  sector  involvement  in  the  economy.  SOEs  dominate  important \nsegments of the economy, leaving little space for the private sector.10 Inefficient SOEs dealing \n\n                                                \n6  The  foreign  exchange  liberalization  adversely  affected  the  financial  performance  of  SOEs  and  led  to  utility  tariff \nadjustments.  As  per  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  resolution  on  14  November  2017,  the  electricity  tariff  increased  by \n12% and the gas tariff by 10% from 1 April 2018. Tariff increases for electricity and natural gas have averaged 18% \nin 2019. Further adjustments are expected during 2020\u20132021. Considering that spending on transport accounts for \n8%  of  the  average  household\u2019s  expenditures,  and  communication  services  for  6%,  the  burden  has  been  mainly \npassed onto over 6.4 million households as consumers of SOEs\u2019 services. \n\n7  The  latest  debt  sustainability  analysis  of  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  conducted  after  the  devaluation \nsuggests  that  most  significant  risks  could  result  from  significantly  lower  remittances  and  exports.  IMF.  2019. \nRepublic  of  Uzbekistan:  Article  IV  Consultation  Press  Release  and  Staff  Report.  IMF  Country  Report  No.19/129. \nWashington, D.C. \n\n8  With  support  from  the  IMF,  the  government\u2019s  tax  reforms  covered  (i)  improvement  in  tax  administration,  (ii) \nenlargement of the tax base, (iii) simplification of the tax rules, and (iv) transparency for tax incentives  to ensure \nequal treatment for state-owned and private businesses. \n\n9  Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 These  segments  include  energy;  metallurgy;  mining;  telecommunication;  agriculture;  machinery  (e.g.,  automotive \nindustry); and transport (airlines, railways, and municipal public transport). In 2016, there were 2,413 public sector \nentities of which (i) 294 were general government entities, including the social security fund and local governments; \n(ii) 2,107 were nonfinancial public corporations; and (iii) 12 were financial public corporations. Of net public sector \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fwith utilities adversely impact the delivery and quality of public goods and services. Many SOEs \nresemble  sector  ministries,  combining  regulatory,  operational,  and  social  protection  functions. \nMajor SOEs run into conflicts of interest when fulfilling their sectoral supervisory and regulatory \nroles while operating as commercial enterprises. Governance standards tend to be opaque, and \nsupervisory  boards  are  often  chaired  by  a  government  official. 11  SOEs  are  still  subject  to \ndomestic accounting standards and rules, which are not fully comparable with the International \nFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The consolidated reporting on the financial performance \nof SOEs, guarantees, and off-budget liabilities is inadequate. \n \n9. \nInefficient  banking  intermediation  and  supervision.  Uzbekistan\u2019s  finance  sector  is \ndominated  by  heavily  regulated  state-owned  and/or  controlled  banks.12 Government  policies \nhave  created  a  dual  credit  market  whereby  commercial  credit  is  provided  to  the  private sector \n(corporations  and  households)  in  local  currency  while  preferential  credit  is  allocated  to  SOEs \nand  priority  sectors  in  foreign  currency.  The  state-owned  and/or  controlled  banks  have  strong \ninfluence over systemic loan growth through their participation in state-run lending programs.13  \nConsequently,  they  do  not  play  the  role  of  effective  financial  intermediation,  which  constrains \nthe  access  of  citizens  or  private  companies to  credit  and  other  banking  services. The  banking \nsupervision, including capital and liquidity assessments has been regular and the reported bank \nsoundness indicators have remained reassuring. However, the bank soundness indicators may \nunderestimate  the  risks  and  thus  there  is  a  need  for  strengthening  risk-based  banking \nsupervision.  The  scope  for  macroprudential  policies  has  also  been  limited  in  the  largely  state-\nowned banking system. \n \n10. \nConstraints  to  private  sector  development.  With  the  state\u2019s  dominant  role  in  the \neconomy  through  SOEs,  expansion  of  the  private  sector  has  been  traditionally  constrained \nbecause of monopolistic practices and various tax, customs, and licensing privileges granted to \nSOEs. Consequently, public investment is crowding out private investment. The contribution of \nthe  private  sector  to  growth  has  been  modest  in  Uzbekistan  because  of  ineffective  financial \nintermediation  and  the  high  cost  of  funds  for  private  investment.14 The  absence  of  a  robust \npublic\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  framework  in  the  past  has  prevented  the  government  from \nleveraging  private  investments  to  modernize,  expand,  and  improve  aging  or  inadequate \ninfrastructure.  There  is  a  need  for  comprehensive  improvements  in  the  enabling  environment \nsuch  as  (i)  rule  of  law,  transparency,  and  other  governance-related  factors;  (ii)  competition \npolicy; (iii) efficient allocation of capital; (iv) improving skills of the workforce; and (v) productivity \nand efficiency gains from price liberalization across the economy and other structural reforms to \ncreate opportunities for the private sector.15 \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \nexpenditures,  nonfinancial  public  corporations  accounted  for  16%  and  financial  public  sector  corporations \naccounted for 6%.  IMF.  2019.  Republic of  Uzbekistan:  Fiscal  Transparency  Evaluation.  IMF  Country  Report.  No. \n19/117. Washington, D.C. \n\n11 Key  deficiencies  in  the  governance  structure  of  SOEs  include  (i)  weak  control  of  payroll  and  non-payroll \nexpenditures;  (ii)  poor  quality  and  timeliness  in  preparing  financial  statements  and  audits;  (iii)  poor  legislative \nscrutiny and lack of follow-up of external audits; and (iv) nontransparency. \n\n12 These banks account for the banking sector\u2019s 86% of assets, 81% of capital and 89% of loans in 2019. \n13 In 2018, the domestic credit-to-GDP ratio was 51%. Of the SUM165 trillion credit stock, 58% was preferential credit \nat the average interest rate of 8%, while 42% was commercial credit at 22% interest rate. The preferential credit \ngrowth  was  43%  and  commercial  credit  growth  was  61%.  IMF.  2019.  Republic  of  Uzbekistan:  Article  IV \nConsultation Press Release and Staff Report. IMF Country Report No.19/129. Washington, D.C. \n\n14 The World Bank\u2019s Enterprise Surveys in 2013 indicated that close to 74% of firms did not use bank loans and the \nvalue  of  collateral  averaged  176%  of  the  loan  amount  in  Uzbekistan.  World  Bank.  2013.  Enterprise  Surveys: \nUzbekistan Country Profile. Washington, D.C.  \n\n15 In the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business 2020 report, Uzbekistan improved its ease of doing business ranking to 69th \nout of 190 economies from 150th out of 183 in 2010. Progress was noted in (i) simplifying procedures for starting a \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\nB. \n \n11. \nIn  recognition  of  these  structural  development  constraints,  in  February  2017,  after \nUzbekistan\u2019s  first  change  in  leadership  since  independence  in  1991,  the  government  adopted \nthe  national  development  strategy,  2017\u20132021,  articulating  the  government\u2019s  vision  for \ndeveloping the private sector and improving public sector management, the banking sector, and \nthe  financial  performance  of  SOEs. 16 The  government  is  committed  to  (i)  increasing \ntransparency  of  the  budget  process  and  transitioning  gradually  to  program  budgeting  to \nincrease  the  effectiveness  of  expenditures;  (ii)  ending  unproductive  transfers  and  subsidies  to \nSOEs from the budget and converting loss-making SOEs into competitive profit-making entities; \nand (iii) using market mechanisms to distribute resources and manage government assets. This \nis  planned  to  be  achieved  through  restructuring  and,  for  smaller  SOEs,  outright  privatization. \nThe  government  intends  to  gradually  move  to  the  International  Public  Sector  Accounting \nStandards  (IPSAS)  across  all  agencies.  Further,  the  government  has  initiated  reforms  to \nimprove the banking sector\u2019s performance, regulation and risk-based supervision. \n \nAchievements  under  subprogram  1. ADB helped the government identify the priority \n12. \nreforms,  addressing  the  key  development  constraints  in  line  with  its  strategic  agenda,  and \nimplement them under a programmatic approach over two subprograms. 17 Under subprogram 1, \nmodernization  of  data  collection,  analysis,  and  dissemination  by  the  State  Committee  on \nStatistics  (SCS),  based  on  the  enhanced  general  data  dissemination  system  (e-GDDS)  of  the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), has begun. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) set the direction \nof  PFM  reforms  by  publishing  the  2012  PEFA  assessment  with  information  on  the  progress \nachieved during 2012\u20132017 on its website. To improve budget preparation, the MOF issued an \norder  to  adopt  and  use  12  budget  accounting  standards  in  line  with  the  IPSAS.18 To  enhance \ninternal  controls,  the  MOF  approved  the  internal  audit  guidelines  and  internal  audit  activities \nwere piloted in the Ministry of Public Education (MOPE) and the Ministry of Health (MOH). To \nimprove banking supervision, the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) prepared capital adequacy \nassessment  for  10  selected  state-owned  banks  and  conducted  stress  testing.19 The  corporate \ngovernance  rules  (CGRs)  based  on  the  2015  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment  Corporate  Governance  Guidelines  for  SOEs  were  adopted  in  seven  SOEs.  A \nsustainable  debt  management  strategy  of  Joint  Stock  Company  (JSC)  Uzbekenergo  was \napproved. The  PPP  law  was  approved  in  2019  to  expand  private  sector participation  in  public \nsector  infrastructure  projects. 20 The  government  approved  a  list  of  non-core  assets  of  JSC \nUzbekenergo, Uzkimyosanoat and Uzbekneftegaz to improve the financial performance of these \ncritical SOEs. For transparency in financial management, the decision to prepare and disclose \nIFRS-compliant  audited  financial  statements  was  approved  by  the  supervisory  board  of  JSC \nUzbekenergo. All policy actions for subprogram 1, which continue to be in effect, have allowed \nthe  government  to  (i)  initiate  key  sector  reforms  that  allow  greater  and  better  access  to \nmacroeconomic data, (ii) switch focus to improving efficiency of banking sector supervision and \nmanagement  of  state-owned  banks,  (iii)  streamline  PFM  systems,  (iv)  initiate  corporate \ngovernance reforms for SOEs, and (v) support power sector reform initiatives. \n                                                                                                                                                       \nbusiness, (ii) tax payments, (iii) protecting minority investors, and (iv) enforcing contracts.

The  law  was  approved  by  the \n\nParliament and signed by the President on 10 May 2019 and entered into force on 12 June 2019. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fProposed  subprogram  2.  The  proposed  subprogram  2  supports  the  government  to \n13. \nsequentially continue and deepen the reforms initiated under subprogram 1. The policy actions \nunder subprogram 2 cover the following three reform areas: \n\n(i)  Macroeconomic  data  collection,  analysis,  and  dissemination  systems \nimproved.  The  requirements  for  IMF\u2019s  e-GDDS  were  fully  complied  with  and  the \ngovernment joined the e-GDDS on 4 May 2018. The government also submitted an \naction  plan  to  update  e-GDDS  indicators,  methodology,  and  frequency  of  data \npublication to comply with the requirements of the IMF\u2019s special data dissemination \nstandard  (SDDS). 21  The  CBU\u2019s  data  coverage  and  dissemination  systems  were \nstrengthened  with  the  update  of  the  data  release  calendar  of  monetary,  fiscal, \nfinancial,  and  macroeconomic  indicators;  and  publication  of  the  calendar  on  the \nCBU\u2019s website for public access starting in 2019. \n\n(ii)  Fiscal  and  financial  management  strengthened.  The  methodology  for  medium-\nterm budget preparation was strengthened with the MOF\u2019s approval of the medium-\nterm budget framework (MTBF) manual, which includes tools for gender-responsive \nbudgeting.  The  government  also  adopted  the  MTBF  for  budget  making  beginning \n2020.  The  MOF  completed  the  2018  PEFA  performance  assessment  report  and \napproved  measures  to  address  the  priority  PFM  areas  based  on  the  2018  PEFA \nreport. 22 The  MOF  also  approved  measures  to  achieve  full  compliance  with  the \naccrual-based  IPSAS.  The  internal  audit  units  in  the  MOPE  and  the  MOH  were \nstaffed  and  operationalized  as  well  as  those  in  three  additional  ministries  and/or \nagencies.23 To strengthen competitiveness, efficiency, and transparency of the public \nprocurement  system,  a  road  map  for  public  procurement  reform  was  approved  in \nFebruary  2019  and  the  draft  public  procurement  law  was  published  on  the \ngovernment\u2019s  website  for  public  consultation,  which  is  expected  to  be  submitted  to \nthe Parliament by the end of 2019. Based on the capital adequacy assessment and \nstress  testing,  the  CBU  implemented  actions  to  address  the  identified  shortfalls  in \nloan loss provisioning, capital, and liquidity for 10 selected state-owned banks.24 The \nCBU  also  introduced  risk-based  banking  supervision  to  enhance  oversight  of  the \nbanking  sector;  the  manual  for  implementation  of  risk-based  bank  supervision  was \napproved and became effective in August 2019. To improve access to bank loans by \nthe  private  sector  and  to  reduce  directed  lending  in  a  phased  manner,  the \ngovernment  approved  a policy  to  augment market-based  lending  covering  all  state-\nowned banks.25 \n\n                                                \n21 The  government  has  been  disseminating  data  on  422  indicators  in  24  categories  as  required  by  e-GDDS  and \nadvance  data  release  calendar,  using  standardized  electronic  reporting  procedures.  The  SDDS  transition  will  be \ncompleted by 2021 as per the road map approved in April 2019. \n\n22 The  MOF\u2019s  Fiscal  Transparency  Action  Plan  (2018\u20132021)  was  published  in  IMF.  2019.  Republic  of  Uzbekistan: \n\nFiscal Transparency Evaluation. IMF Country Report No. 19/117. Washington, D.C. \n\n23 Internal  audit  units  were  established  in  (i)  the  Ministry  of  Higher  and  Secondary  Specialized  Education;  (ii)  the \n\nPension Fund at MOF; and (iii) the Ministry of Preschool Education. \n\n24 The  stress  tests  show  that  banks\u2019  capital  adequacy  ratios  are  currently  in  line  with  the  regulatory  requirements, \nexcept for one bank where capital injection is needed. The CBU has provided instructions to commercial banks to \n(i)  make  adjustments  to  reduce  their  nonperforming  loans;  (ii)  slow  down  loan  issuance;  (iii)  bring  the  capital \nadequacy ratio to 14% by 1 September 2020, and further keep it at that level; (iv) increase the share of highly liquid \nassets to 10% by a quarterly increase of at least 1%; and (v) increase the ratio of highly liquid assets to short-term \nliabilities up to 40%, through a quarterly increase of the indicator by at least 5%. \n\n25 In  December  2018,  a  resolution  was  adopted  for  the  state-owned  banks  to  (i)  strengthen  risk  management,  (ii) \ndiversify  their  lending  portfolio,  and  (iii)  establish  lending  conditions  based  on  (a)  market principles,  (b)  technical \nand  economic  assessment  of  projects,  and  (c)  borrowers\u2019  creditworthiness.  These  measures  will  support \ncommercial lending to the private sector, including small and medium-sized enterprises, and offer great potential to \nsynergize with ADB\u2019s proposed Mortgage Market Sector Development Program in 2019, which aims to address key \ndistortions  in  residential  mortgage  market  such  as  (i)  inefficient  housing  subsidies,  (ii)  limited  mortgage-related \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\ffixed  assets  (generation, \n\n(iii) State-owned  enterprise  governance  and  private  sector  operations  improved. \nThe CGRs in selected SOEs were implemented and a timetable for implementation \nof CGRs in all other SOEs was approved.26 The government\u2019s shares in 34 out of 38 \nSOEs, identified in Presidential Decree No. 4112, were transferred to the State Asset \nManagement  Agency  (SAMA), 27 and  a  special  fund  was  created  in  May  2019  to \nfacilitate restructuring, divestment, and privatization of these SOEs.28 Revaluing JSC \ntransmission,  and  distribution)  was \nUzbekenergo\u2019s \ncompleted  to  determine  the  true  and  fair  value  of  the  company\u2019s  assets  in \ncompliance  with  the  international  financial  reporting  and  valuation  standards.29 To \npromote  private  sector  activities,  two  financially  viable  PPP  projects  were  taken  to \nthe bidding stage.30 From the approved list of non-core assets of JSC Uzbekenergo, \nUzkimyosanoat  and  Uzbekneftegaz,  the  government  sold  90  out  of  186  non-core \nassets  that  were  identified  for  divestment  and  transferred  112  out  of  118  non-core \nassets that were identified for transfer to local authorities. To ensure cost recovery of \nrelated investments, a new tariff methodology for provision of electricity was adopted \nin  April  2019.  Finally,  an  independent  auditor  was  contracted  to  carry  out  IFRS-\ncompliant  consolidated  audited  financial  statements  of  JSC  Uzbekenergo  for  2017, \n2018,  and  the first  half of  2019 (up  to the  unbundling  of  the  company  on  27  March \n2019). The three successor companies of JSC Uzbekenergo31 also took the decision \nto annually prepare and disclose IFRS-compliant audited financial statements in line \nwith  the  decision  of  the  Power  Sector  Reform  Commission  of  the  Cabinet  of \nMinisters and the order of the SAMA as the sole shareholder of these companies. \n\n \n14. \nAdjustments in subprogram 2 policy actions. Under subprogram 2, inclusion of new \npolicy  actions  and  adjustments  to  initial  policy  actions  as  summarized  in  paras.  15\u201317  (i) \nstrengthened  the  program\u2019s  relevance  to  Uzbekistan\u2019s  dynamic  macroeconomic  context  and \npolicy  environment,  (ii)  reflected  the  positive  changes  in  the  government\u2019s  priorities  and  its \ncommitment to adopt more advanced PFM reforms in line with the latest gap assessments and \ninternational  best  practices,  and  (iii)  strengthened  institutional  and  technical  implementation \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \nfinancial  products,  (iii)  inadequate  regulations  on  lending  quality,  and  (iv)  limited  access  to  long-term  funding  by \nbanks because of underdeveloped capital markets. \n\n26 Based on the assessment, selected SOEs are compliant with 66% of the selected 36 key CGRs in the areas of (i) \nrelated party transactions; (ii) internal control policy and audit; (iii) prevention of conflicts of interest and responsible \nbusiness conduct; (iv) disclosure of quarterly and annual reports; and (v) organizational roles and responsibilities of \nthe  shareholders  and  the  supervisory  board  and/or  executive  body,  clearly  laid  out  in  the  SOE  charter. \nImplementation and capacity building support  is most required for CGRs related to (i) composition of independent \nsupervisory boards; (ii) competitive selection of executives; (iii) IFRS-compliant financial reporting; (iv) adoption of \ninternational auditing standards; and (v) creation of a risk management framework, where compliance is partial or \nnon-substantial. The implementation of CGRs in the 50 largest SOEs will begin in 2019, followed by other JSCs in \n2020, limited liability companies in 2021\u20132022, and state unitary enterprises in 2023\u20132025. \n\n27 The Presidential Decree No. 4112 legally transferred the government\u2019s shares in 38 SOEs to SAMA on 14 January \n2019. The net asset value of 38 SOEs was SUM18,377 billion in 2018 (about $2 billion based on the exchange rate \nof  $1/SUM8,705  as  of  9  August  2019).  During  2019,  the  transfer  of  34  SOEs  to  SAMA  was  completed.  The \nadministrative process for two SOEs is ongoing. The remaining two SOEs have been transferred to other agencies \nfor privatization and/or restructuring. \n\n28 The  government  established  the  SAMA  in  January  2019  to  improve  SOEs\u2019  performance,  transparency,  and \n\ncorporate governance, and to promote privatization. \n\n29 These  assets  are  now  being  transferred  to  three  successor  companies  following  the  unbundling  of  JSC \n\nUzbekenergo under the government\u2019s comprehensive power sector reforms. \n\n30 Two PPP projects selected under subprogram 2 are (i) a 100-megawatt solar photovoltaic power station in Navoi \nregion  ($100  million)  and  (ii)  hemodialysis  centers  in  different  regions  ($9.8  million).  The  International  Finance \nCorporation provided support for these PPP transactions. \n\n31 JSC  Thermal  Power  Plants  (generation),  JSC  National  Electric  Networks  of  Uzbekistan  (transmission),  and  JSC \n\nRegional Electric Networks (distribution). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fcapacity across the implementing agencies. \n \n15. \nPolicy action 1 was strengthened to reflect the government\u2019s compliance with the IMF\u2019s \ne-GDDS  requirements.  Policy  action  2  was  reformulated  to  reflect  the  policy  commitment  by \nmultiple  agencies  to  modernizing  statistical  systems  in  line  with  the  SDDS  during  2019\u20132020. \nPolicy action 3 was also strengthened to reflect the CBU\u2019s update of the data release calendar \nand its public dissemination. Under policy action 4, while the government indicated that it would \nuse MTBF for budget making starting in 2020,32 the MOF will reach technical readiness to fully \nimplement the  MTBF  along  with  program  budgeting  in  2021  once  templates  and  standardized \ndata  for  expenditures  in  administrative  departments  are  completed  with  technical  assistance \n(TA) support from the IMF and ADB. Thus, the approval of MTBF was reformulated as approval \nof the MTBF manual to strengthen the MOF\u2019s operational and technical capacity for the budget \npreparation process in line with the sequential approach for introducing the MTBF based on the \nIMF\u2019s  advice to the government.  Policy  action  5  was  strengthened  to reflect  the completion  of \nthe 2018 PEFA assessment and the timeline for addressing the priority PFM areas. Because of \nthe  government\u2019s  recent  policy  decision  to  expedite  the  full  transition  to  IPSAS,  approval  of \nmeasures for full compliance with the accrual-based IPSAS was included under policy action 6 \ninstead of the original action to implement 12 budget accounting standards.33 The policy action \n7 was reformulated to reflect the progress already achieved with staffing and activities in audit \nunits  of  MOPE  and  MOH,  which  were  initiated  under  subprogram  1  and  operationalization  of \naudit units in additional ministries and/or agencies. A new policy action on approval of a public \nprocurement road map and publishing of a draft public procurement law for public consultation \nwas introduced under policy action 8, reflecting the government\u2019s commitment to improving the \npublic procurement system. Under policy action 9, the context for the CBU\u2019s actions to address \nthe  shortfalls  in  the  banking  sector  was  more  clearly  highlighted.  Under  policy  action  10,  the \napproval  of  risk-based  banking  supervision  guidelines  and  the  initiation of  implementation  was \nreformulated as the introduction of risk-based banking supervision with the approval of the risk-\nbased  banking  supervision  manual.  Unlike  the  guidelines,  the  manual  strengthens  the  CBU\u2019s \noperational  ability  to  effectively  detect  and  manage  banking  sector  risks,  including  credit, \nliquidity,  and  compliance.  Extensive  training  was  provided  to  the  CBU\u2019s  inspection  staff  to \ndevelop  their  technical  capacity  to  practically  implement  the  manual  as  early  as  the  banking \ninspection  process  that  started  in  October  2019  in  consultation  with  ADB\u2019s  TA  support.  Policy \naction 11 was reformulated to reflect the approved policy for augmenting market-based lending \ncovering all state-owned banks.34 \n \n16. \nUnder  policy  action  12,  the  timeline  for  the  implementation  of  CGRs  in  all  other  SOEs \nwas  more  clearly  defined  and  the  SAMA  was  specified  as  the  new  implementing  agency  in \ncharge of managing state assets as a shareholder and setting up relevant policies. A new policy \naction  on  the  transfer  of  the  government  shares  in  34  out  of  38  SOEs  to  the  SAMA  and  the \ncreation  of  a  special fund for  restructuring,  divestment,  and  privatization  under the  SAMA  was \nincluded under policy action 13 to strengthen the focus of subprogram 2 on SOE reforms and to \n                                                \n32 The  government  presented  3-year  fiscal  projections  for  the  first  time  in  the  2019  budget.  The  2020  budget \nintroduces elements of MTBF with a 3-year horizon on key macroeconomic targets and aggregate budget items. \n33 The relevance of 12 budget accounting standards will be reevaluated based on their compliance with international \nnorms and the new road map for transitioning to the IPSAS accrual-based budget accounting standards. The road \nmap shows that standards on reporting of cash flows and consolidated financial statements will be completed by \n2020\u20132021 and provisions of contingent assets and liabilities will be completed by 2023 while advanced practices \nunder accrual-based budgeting will be completed by 2030 in a phased manner. \n\n34 Details on other measures are in Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nIn  August  2019,  the  government  indicated  that  directed  lending  programs  from  the  Uzbekistan  Fund  for \nReconstruction  and  Development  will  be  concentrated  in  a  few  state-owned  banks  and  the  remaining  will  be \nprivatized. Preliminary calculations show that this will enable three large banks to increase lending by $5.7 billion. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fprovide  capacity-building  support  to  the  SAMA  under  ADB\u2019s  TA.  Policy  action  15  was \nstrengthened by (i) indicating the specific number of selected PPP projects; (ii) designating the \nPublic\u2013Private  Partnership  Development  Agency  (PPPDA),  which  was  established  in  October \n2018,  as  the  new  implementing  agency  for  selecting  the  PPP  projects;  and  (iii)  demonstrating \nthe government\u2019s broader commitment to 86 PPP projects open for international investment as \napproved under the presidential decree in April 2019. The status report on the completion of the \ndivestment process (per the original indicative policy action) would not be entirely feasible within \none  year  of  subprogram  2  implementation  given  that  (i)  divestment  of  the  selected  non-core \nassets  of  SOEs  is  not  a  one-time  terminal  activity,  (ii)  income  generation  from  the  process \nrequires  having  favorable  market  conditions  and  existence  of  private  sector  demand,  and  (iii) \nthe  final  transfer  of  ownership  of  non-core  assets  could  involve  resolving  complex  legal  and \nprocedural  requirements.  Therefore,  policy  action  16  was  reformulated  to  reflect  the  ongoing \nprocess and the government\u2019s commitment to streamline SOE operations. \n \n17. \nThe unbundling of JSC Uzbekenergo through presidential resolution on 27 March 2019 \nrequired  reformulation  of  three  policy  actions:  14,  17,  and  18.35 Revaluing  the  fixed  assets  of \nthree  successor  companies  (generation,  distribution,  and  transmission),  instead  of  JSC \nUzbekenergo  as  a  single  entity,  was  completed  by  an  independent  audit  firm  for  the  newly \nestablished  Ministry  of  Energy  under  policy  action  14.  The  master  plan  for  financing  JSC \nUzbekenergo\u2019s  investment  during  2018\u20132022  was  replaced  with  the  adoption  of  a  new \nelectricity tariff methodology for policy action 17. This came about because of the government\u2019s \ndecision to develop a more comprehensive power sector master plan for a longer time horizon \nof  10  years,  for  which  it  is  currently  considering  policy  and  technical  recommendations  from \ndevelopment  partners,  including  ADB.  The  new  tariff  methodology  enables  full  recovery  of \noperational  and  capital  costs  and  ensures  the  necessary  net  profit  for  the  power  sector  to  be \nfinancially sustainable. This will help reduce the subsidy requirement and attract new investment \ninto the sector. Given the ongoing corporate restructuring of the three successor companies, the \npreparation  of  JSC  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  2017  IFRS-compliant  consolidated  audited  financial \nstatements  was  delayed.  The  adjusted  policy  action  18  reflects  a  more  forward-looking \napproach and expands the original action by including financial statements for the last 3 years \nof JSC Uzbekenergo and extending independent audit and reporting requirements to the three \nsuccessor companies.36 \n \n18. \nSupporting  technical  assistance.  The  program\u2019s  attached  TA  has  been  supporting \nsubprograms 1 and 2, focusing on (i) training of SCS staff; (ii) capacity building of the MOF on \nMTBF  preparation;  (iii)  preparation  of  the  MTBF manual  and  gender-sensitivity  assessment  of \npublic expenditures; (iv) capacity building of the CBU in risk-based banking supervision, capital \nadequacy  assessments,  and  stress  testing;  (v)  development  of  the  risk-based  banking \nsupervision manual; (vi) strengthening of the internal audit units within selected ministries and/or \nagencies,  including  introduction  of  a  risk-based  audit  manual;  (vii)  capacity  building  of  the \nPPPDA,  including  drafting  of  model  concession  agreements  and  operational  guidelines,  and \nestablishment of a PPP development facility; (viii) strengthening of the CGRs in selected SOEs \nand  capacity  building  of  the  SAMA  and  directors  of  SOEs;  and  (ix)  revaluation  of  JSC \nUzbekenergo\u2019s  fixed  assets  for  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution.  Resources  will  be \nadded  to the  existing TA  to  extend  the  implementation  until the  end  of  2022  to  strengthen  the \n\n                                                \n35 Further details on energy sector reforms are in Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (accessible from the list \n\nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n36 The  audit of  IFRS-compliant  consolidated  audited  financial  statements  of JSC  Uzbekenergo  for  2017, 2018,  and \nthe  first  half  of  2019  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  2020.

The expanded TA will \nalso serve as a post-program review framework for ADB to assess the need for future reforms. \nTo  ensure  sustainability,  the  TA  will  provide  implementation  support  in  (i)  gender-responsive \nMTBF and performance-based program budgeting by the MOF; (ii) accrual-based IPSAS based \non the MOF\u2019s approved road map; 37 (iii) extension of the risk-based internal audit framework to \nother  ministries  and/or  agencies;  (iv)  IFRS-compliant  financial  statements  by  SOEs;  (v)  the \nupgrading  of  national  accounting  standards  by  the  MOF;  (vi)  the  strengthening  of  the  SCS\u2019s \nstatistical  data  systems  including  more  regular  updates  of  sex-disaggregated  data;  (vii)  the \nCBU\u2019s risk-based banking supervision and (viii) the SOE reforms. 38 \n \n19. \nADB\u2019s  value  addition.  The  reforms  under  the  two  subprograms  have  provided \nsignificant  value  addition  and  complementarity  to  the  government\u2019s  agenda.  ADB  has  been \neffectively engaging in policy dialogue with the government to bring in experience and lessons \nfrom similar PFM projects and policy-based programs in the Central and West Asia region.39 A \nkey  lesson  is  that  the  programmatic  approach  has  proven  to  be  an  appropriate  modality  for \nlogically  sequencing  structural  reforms  under  a  multiyear  engagement  framework  and  making \nnecessary  and  realistic  adjustments  in  response  to  dynamic  changes  in  the  policy  and \nmacroeconomic environment in Uzbekistan.40 Strong government commitment to realistic policy \nactions and complementarity of support from development partners were found to be important \nprerequisites  for  successful  implementation.  The  program\u2019s  attached  TA  facilitated  the \nimplementation  of  international  best  practices  by  tailoring  them  to  Uzbekistan\u2019s  unique  needs \nand  provided  operational  support  and  capacity  building  to  implement  complex  reforms.

While  the  World  Bank\u2019s  2018  DPO  and  ADB\u2019s  subprogram  1 \nadministered  their  own  policy  matrices,  they  coordinated  closely  to  identify  complementary \nreforms. The World Bank supported the introduction of IFRS and stress testing of the banking \nsector,  which  synergized  with  ADB\u2019s  reforms  in  these  areas  and  support  to  the  CBU  for  risk-\nbased  banking  supervision  under  subprogram  1.  The  2019  DPO  focuses  on  (i)  citizen \nparticipation  in  local  budgetary  processes;  (ii)  private  sector  promotion  and  liberalization  of \nstate-dominated  sectors;  and  (iii)  strengthening  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  for  greater \ninvestment in the energy and financial sectors. These activities closely complement the reforms \nrelated to public sector budget systems, SOEs, and JSC Uzbekenergo under subprogram 2.42 In \nMay  2019,  the World  Bank  approved  $33  million  for  the  Institutional  Capacity  Building  Project \nfor  (i)  improvements  in  public  sector  accounting,  audit,  and  treasury  management;  (ii) \ndevelopment of a legal and regulatory framework for SOE restructuring and a database for SOE \nassets; (iii) support to the regulatory agencies; and (iv) support for implementation of PPPs. \n \n23. \nIn 2018, AFD provided \u20ac150 million in collaborative cofinancing with \u20ac1 million TA under \nsubprogram  1.  AFD  supported  the  MOF  for  strengthening  budget  systems  and  public \nprocurement,  and  SAMA  for  improving  SOE  supervision  and  corporate  governance.  AFD  also \napproved \u20ac50 million of collaborative cofinancing for subprogram 2. 43  The UNDP provided TA \nsupport  to  MOF  for  (i)  the  2019  Citizens\u2019  Budget;  (ii)  introduction  of  medium-term  budget \nplanning;  (iii)  establishment  of  internal  control  and  audit  systems;  (iv)  reforms  of  the  public \naccounting system; and (v) enhancing the capacities of the Pension Fund. The UNDP plans to \nstrengthen the  MOF\u2019s  capacity  in  program-based  budgeting,  environmentally  sensitive  (green) \nbudgeting, and gender budgeting. \n \nC. \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\nSubprogram 2 will help facilitate macroeconomic stability and sustainable high growth.44 \n24. \nReforms  in  PFM  will  help  improve  the  environment  conducive  to  private  investment  over  the \nmedium term. These reforms will be made through (i) preparing the annual budget using MTBF, \nwhich  improves  the  distributive  efficiency  of  scarce  public  resources  and  better  aligns \nexpenditures with developmental targets; (ii) improving internal controls and audit systems; (iii) \nreducing  fiscal  transfers  to  large  SOEs;  and  (iv)  ceasing  systemic  leakages,  i.e.,  from  public \n                                                \n42 The World Bank\u2019s 2019 DPO is also supporting reforms in social inclusion and safety nets. In addition, the World \nBank  approved  $50  million  loan  in  2019  for  a  project  to  strengthen  social  inclusion,  social  protection,  and \nemployment  generation  for  labor  affected  by  SOE  reforms.  The  project  provided  support  to  the  Ministry  of \nEmployment and Labor Relations for strengthening public employment services in Uzbekistan. This complements \nADB\u2019s proposed technical and vocational education and training project to  strengthen education and competence \nin science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; upgrade the curriculum to ensure industry\u2013education links; \nand improve labor skills. \n\n43 While  AFD\u2019s  cofinancing  was  not  administered  by  ADB,  ADB  and  AFD  closely  cooperated  to  develop \ncomplementary  policy  actions  and  TA  activities.  The  implementation  has  been  monitored  through  regular \ncommunication  among  cofinancing  partners  under  subprogram  1.  The  same  approach  has  been  followed  under \nsubprogram 2.  \n\n44 Under  the  effect  of  the  reform  in the design  and monitoring  framework  in  Appendix  1  (environment conducive  to \nprivate  investment  improved),  the  first  performance  indicator  (local  currency  bank  credit  to  private  sector)  was \nreplaced  with  a  new  indicator  on  loans  extended  to  small  businesses.  In  line  with  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to \npromote  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  compared  to  the  earlier  indicator,  this  indicator  is  a  more  direct \nmeasure  of  the  improvements  in  access  to  finance  by  small  businesses  that  are  essential  for  job  creation  and \ninclusive  growth.  The  second  performance  indicator  (the  ratio  of  operating  revenue  to  the  operating  cost  of  JSC \nUzbekenergo)  was  replaced  with  a  new  indicator  on  policy  lending  because  JSC  Uzbekenergo  no  longer  exists \nafter  its  unbundling  on  27  March  2019.  Both  indicators  are  directly  related  to  improvements  in  financial \nintermediation to private sector and reduction in directed lending, which are critical for improving the environment \nconductive to private investment. \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fprocurement. Full compliance with the accrual-based IPSAS for budget and IFRS for SOEs will \nincrease  the  reliability  and  quality  of  public  sector  accounting  and  financial  reporting.  A  more \nstable  banking  sector  and  its  enhanced  ability  to  finance  private  sector  investments  will  result \nfrom  improved  risk-based  banking  supervision,  reduced  directed  lending  to  SOEs,  and  more \nmarket-based  financial  intermediation.  An  enabling  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  environment \nfor PPPs will promote private sector investment. Subprogram 2 will contribute to improving the \nefficiency, governance, operational and financial viability of SOEs by promoting (i) international \nCGRs,  (ii)  divestment  of  selected  non-core  assets,  and  (iii)  restructuring  of  key  power  sector \nSOEs. These reforms will support the national development strategies, aiming toward a vibrant \nmarket economy driven by private entrepreneurship. \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\n25. \nThe  development  financing  need  of  the  Government  of  Uzbekistan  amounts  to  $1.7 \nbillion  (14%  of  the  budget  expenditure  in  2019),  driven  by  higher  wages  and  expenditures  on \nsocial programs to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation  on low-income households resulting \nfrom  depreciation  of  the  local  currency,  price  liberalization,  and  SOE  reforms. 45  Despite \nimprovements  in  tax  revenues,  the  state\u2019s  budget  expenditures  have  increased  from  2018  to \n2019.46 In  2019,  the  augmented  budget  deficit  is  projected  at  SUM7.8  trillion  ($0.9  billion  or \n1.6% of GDP), of which SUM3.5 trillion ($0.4 billion) will be covered through external borrowings \nfrom  development  partners,  including  ADB. 47 Without  the  development  partners\u2019  support,  it \nwould  be  difficult  for  Uzbekistan  to  cover  the  development  financing  need  on  its  own  without \njeopardizing  essential \nthe \nGovernment of Uzbekistan is in Appendix 3.  \n \n26. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  regular  loan  of  $300  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 2. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace  period  of  3  years;  an  annual  interest rate determined in  accordance with ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement. Based on the straight-line \nmethod, the average loan maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to \nADB. \n \nE. \n\ninvestments.

The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nThe implementation period for subprogram 2 is 26 June 2018\u201331 December 2019. \n \n\n                                                \n45 Reform-related  budget  expenditures  comprise  (i)  wage  and  utility  tariff  adjustments;  (ii)  allowances,  financial \nassistance, and benefits; (iii) support for job creation for youth and women; and (iv) a subsidy to the Pension Fund. \nDetails are in Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n46 Budget revenues have risen by 65% in nominal terms in 2019 compared with 2018 because of economic growth. \nThe  indirect  taxes  (from  value-added  tax)  have  grown  by  141%  (46%  of  revenues)  and  direct  taxes  from \ncorporations,  businesses,  and  individuals  have  grown  by  227%  (29%  of  revenues)  following  the  tax  reforms. \nHowever,  budget  expenditures  have  increased  by  72%  with  higher  social  spending.

PFM reforms will help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public sector \ninvestment. The CGRs will contribute to enhanced performance and financial viability of SOEs, \nreducing  fiscal  transfers  over  the  medium  term.  Improved  economic  management  and \nmacroeconomic stability will have a crowding-in impact on the private sector.48 \n \nC. \n \n30. \nA  governance  risk  assessment  was  conducted  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Second  Governance \nand  Anticorruption  Action  Plan. 49 No  major  governance  risks  were  identified  except  for  weak \nimplementation capacity and retention of trained staff in relevant departments. The government \nis  committed  to  reforms  and,  in  2017,  launched  an  anticorruption  campaign  that  includes \nlegislative, regulatory, and institutional initiatives.50 No major risks of resource mismanagement \ncan  be  discerned  at  the  relevant  departments,  and  PFM  related  to  budget  credibility,  debt \nmanagement,  and  treasury  functions  is  generally  reliable.  Identified  weaknesses  in  (i)  internal \naudit; (ii) planning of capital and current expenditures; (iii) corporate governance of SOEs; and \n(iv)  IPSAS  were  targeted  under  the  attached  TA.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the MOF. \n \nD. \n \n31. \nThe  poverty  reduction  and  social  impacts  of  subprogram  2  are  positive.  The  reforms \nunder  subprogram  2  will  enhance  (i)  the  allocative  efficiency  of  public  sector  expenditures;  (ii) \nfinancial  intermediation  by  the  banking  sector;  (iii)  the  SOEs\u2019  governance  to  enable  more \neffective and inclusive delivery of public goods and services; and (iv) the enabling environment \nfor the private sector.51 These outcomes have an indirect impact on poverty reduction. Creation \nof  fiscal  headroom  through  better  fiscal  management  will  enable  higher  public  investment  and \nbudget allocations for the poor and vulnerable groups; and improved access to finance by the \nprivate  sector  will  contribute  to  business  growth  and  job  creation.  Subprogram  2  has  some \ngender elements given that the MOF has adopted a gender-responsive MTBF manual and the \nMOF\u2019s  capacity  to  implement gender-responsive  budgeting  and gender-sensitivity  assessment \nof public expenditures was strengthened under the TA.

However, the \ndialogue with the government and related agencies such as the SAMA will continue to strengthen the systems for \nsocial inclusion, protection, and employment generation for labor during the SOE reforms.
