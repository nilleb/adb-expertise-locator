This will be achieved through the implementation of \nan integrated approach to manage flooding, the water environment, and ecology collectively with \na well-balanced mix of structural and nonstructural interventions, including capacity building. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT  \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nYangtze  River  Economic  Belt  (YREB)  covers  nine  provinces  and  two  specially \n3. \nadministered cities in the Yangtze River Basin. It accounts for over 40% of the PRC\u2019s population \nand  has  40%  of  the  freshwater  resources.  It  also  serves  as  the  drinking  water  resource  for \n400 million people, provides 60% of the total fisheries production, has 20% of the total wetland \narea, and contributes about 45% of the PRC\u2019s economic output. YREB has been earmarked as \none of the three key growth engines to ensure the PRC\u2019s future economic development.1 \n \n4. \nYREB  has  benefitted from  extensive development  since  1990s,  particularly  in the  delta \narea. Yet, economic growth in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River Basin is lagging \nand  below  its  potential  capacity.  The  middle  and  upper  reaches  of  YREB  still  face  significant \ndevelopment challenges because of (i) slow transformation for green development and economic \ndiversification; (ii) limited integration of waterways, ports, and intermodal logistics; (iii) increasing \npollution and pressure on natural resources; and (iv) weak institutional coordination for strategic \nplanning.2 YREB faces a growing imbalance between economic achievements and the quality of \nthe environment. \n \nTo  address  these  challenges,  the  Government  of  the  PRC  formulated  the  YREB \n5. \ndevelopment  plan  2016\u20132030,3 which  stipulated  the  prioritization  of  ecological  protection  and \npromotion  of  green  development  as  the  guiding  principle  for  the  YREB  development. 4 In  this \nconnection,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  government  have  agreed  to  adopt  a \nframework approach, providing about $2.0 billion of funding in the YREB  during 2018\u20132020 to \nstrategically program ADB\u2019s lending support for development initiatives in the YREB with priority \ngiven to the following four areas: (i) ecosystem restoration, environmental protection, and water \nresources management; (ii) green and inclusive industrial transformation; (iii) construction of an \nintegrated multimodal transport corridor; and (iv) institutional strengthening and policy reform. \n \n6. \nSince 1980, YREB has suffered over $0.3 trillion in direct economic damage from recurring \nfloods, accounting for 75% of the total flood damage in the PRC. Most flood damage does not \n\n                                                \n1  The  other  flagship  projects  are  the  Belt  and  Road  Initiative  and  the  Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei  Integrated  Regional \n\nDevelopment Strategy. \n\n2  ADB. 2016.

Outline of the Yangtze River Economic Belt Development Plan, 2016\u20132030. Beijing. \n4  Green development aims to (i) change the traditional development model to a sustainable development model; (ii) \n\naddress the challenges of rapid urbanization; and (iii) serve as a guide to socioeconomic development. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ncome from the main stem river but from small to moderate-sized river sub-basins. YREB suffered \nfrom fatal floods in 2016 that caused $28 billion of economic damage, declaring emergencies at \nmore than 3,300 locations. Of those, over 3,200 were reported on small tributaries that generally \nhave lower standards of flood protection or where standards have not kept pace with the rapid \nrate  of  development  or  intensifying  extreme rainfall  events  caused  by global  climatic changes. \nSince 1980, water pollution has risen by 73% mainly because of the direct discharge of domestic, \nindustrial,  and  agricultural  waste,  making  water  unfit  for  consumptive  and  productive  use.  The \nupper  and  middle  reaches  account  for  80%  of  YREB\u2019s  total  wastewater  discharge  and  the \ntributaries have the worst water quality in the river basin.5 The hydrological variability caused by \nrapid urbanization and industrialization has had a large contribution to water pollution and has \nincreased flood frequency and magnitude. The enormity of the losses suffered during 2000\u20132017 \nmerits a review of policies and practices in the PRC. Priority is yet to be given to improve water \ninterception,  water  quality,  flood  risk  mitigation,  and  ecological  protection  in  upstream  areas, \nmainly sub-basins, to ensure the water flowing downstream is clean and free of flood risk. \n \n7. \nChongqing Municipality, the largest urban area in the upper YREB, plays a critical role in \nenvironmental and conservation efforts in the region.6 However, many rural towns and villages in \nChongqing are left behind from overall development because of insufficient public infrastructure, \ncontinued  flood  disasters,  worsening  water  pollution,  and  degraded  ecological  conditions.  The \ntraditional approach taken by CMG to flood control relies solely on structural measures, which are \nno  longer  feasible.  The  link  between  flood  management,  environmental  degradation,  and \necosystem sustainability needs to be addressed. An integrated approach is necessary to adapt \nto changing  social, geophysical,  and environmental  conditions,  leading  to  integrated flood and \nenvironmental risk management (FERM) as an approach to be adopted by the municipality. \n \n8. \nChongqing  is  a  core  part  of  the  ecological  conservation  zone  of  the  Three  Gorges \nReservoir, which plays a pivotal role in mitigating floods in the middle and lower Yangtze River \nreaches.  However,  Chongqing  has  suffered  from  seven  fatal  floods  since  2007.  Longxi  River \nwatershed is one of the worst flood-impacted areas, with only 10% of river reach protected by \nlevees for less than 5-year return period floods.7 The old concrete dams in Longxi River are no \nlonger  beneficial  as  they  are filled  up  with sediment  and  their  operation is  not  compatible with \nemerging FERM needs. The annual average flood damage in Longxi River watershed is about \nCNY1.71 billion, with fatal flooding in 2010, 2014, 2016, and 2017. \n \n9. \nChongqing  produces  7%  (1.5  billion  tons)  of  household  and  18%  (355  million  tons)  of \nindustrial wastewater in YREB annually\u2014among the highest values per unit area in YREB. The \nannual average solid waste volume is more than 30 million tons in Chongqing, of which only 14% \nis  being  treated.  Inadequate  management  of  waste  has  resulted  in  poor  water  quality  in \nChongqing\u2019s rivers and lakes, which exceeds the national standard (class III) at various locations, \nspecifically  in  the  Longxi  River  watershed. 8  The  fast-paced  industrialization  (50%)  and \nurbanization  (45%)  rates  along  the  Longxi  River  corridor,  without  proper  planning,  have  put \npressure on water resources. The floods formed many belts of floating rubbish in the Longxi River, \nwhich exacerbated flooding and water pollution. Despite the availability of treatment facilities, over \n\n                                                \n5  YREB produces about 81% of the country\u2019s chemical fibers, 58% of pesticides,  and 51% of fertilizers. Ministry of \n\nEcology and Environment. 2013. MEP Releases State of Environmental Quality of China in 2012.  \n\n6  Chongqing Municipality comprises 38 districts and counties over 82,400 square kilometers, and has a population of \n\n33.7 million of which over 39% is rural. \n\n7  Longxi River Basin in Chongqing Municipality has an area of 2,966 square kilometers (about 30 kilometers long) with \n2.1 million population. The river originates in Liangping District, passes through Dianjiang County, and merges with \nthe Yangtze River in Changshou District. The basin is located about 200 kilometers north of Chongqing City. \n8  Up to class III water is suitable for drinking as per PRC\u2019s Environmental Water Quality Standard (GB 3838-2002). \n\n\f40% of residents and 80% of industries in the watershed do not benefit due to the lack of sewer \nnetwork.  Unsustainable  farming  resulted  in  high  sediment  yield  and  poor  water  operation \npractices  have  worsen  the  water  quality  in  Shuanggui  and  Sanhe  lakes  (small  lakes)  in  the \nwatershed.  Water  quality  in  Changshou  Lake  in  the  lower  Longxi  River  watershed  has  also \ndeteriorated because of eutrophication.  \n \n10.  Wetlands account for 2.5% of the total area in Chongqing while green spaces make up \n4.3%\u2014the lowest in YREB. In the municipality, the Longxi River watershed suffers the most from \nhuman-induced  ecological  destruction.  The  hydrology  and  environment  of  the  Longxi  River \nwatershed are modified through long-term human activities, including agriculture and small water \ninfrastructure (e.g., barrages), which regulate river flows and habitat clearance. Since 1990, about \n60% of the wetlands and 35% of the vegetated areas in this watershed have disappeared and \nover 41% of the land area has been exposed to water-induced soil erosion, resulting in reduced \nriver  conveyance,  flooding,  reservoir  shrinkage,  and  water  contamination.  The  climate  change \nimpact in the watershed is likely to (i) worsen the water quality because of increased temperature \nand decreased river flow, and (ii) increase floods as a result of increased rainfall intensity. \n \n11. \nCoordination among the upstream and downstream local governments in the Longxi River \nwatershed has not yet been established because of a lack of participatory watershed development \nplanning.  The  institutional  capacity  of  local  governments  to  implement  FERM  is  still  weak.  To \nfacilitate sustainable development and enhance livelihoods,  accommodate growing population, \nand  attract  investments,  CMG  will  support  local  governments  in  development  planning  and \nimplementation.  The  integrated  FERM  plan  and  the  implementation  of  critical  measures  are \nurgently required to promote sustainable development in the watershed, including infrastructure \ndevelopment, physical connectivity, and economic competitiveness. Since the watershed is in a \nless developed region, it can demonstrate environmentally sustainable growth model that can be \nreplicated in other manageable watersheds in Chongqing, YREB, or the entire PRC. \n \nStrategic  fit.  In  January  2018,  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission \n12. \nannounced  the  first  batch  of  national  priority  river  basin  water  environment  and  sustainable \ndevelopment pilot projects and identified the Longxi River  Basin as one of 16 pilot river basins \nnationwide.9 The Chongqing Development and Reform Commission adopted the pilot program in \nthe form of the Longxi River basin development plan, 2018\u20132025, for which CMG considers this \nproject a kickoff and benchmark for investment in FERM. The project also aims to revitalize the \neco-compensation mechanism in the watershed by promoting upstream\u2013downstream links, and \nwill  contribute  to  the  PRC\u2019s  goal  of  building  a  harmonious  and  prosperous  society  through \nenvironmentally  sustainable  growth.  It  is  consistent  with  the  PRC\u2019s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan, \n2016\u20132020, which aims to realize \u201cecological civilization\u201d.10 The project is aligned with the ADB \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  2016\u20132020, 11  mainly  the  three  major  principles: \n(i) managing  climate  change  and  environment,  (ii)  supporting  inclusive  economic  growth,  and \n(iii) fostering knowledge cooperation. It is also consistent with (i) ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, \n2011\u20132020, which emphasizes integrated water resources management (IWRM) with a focus on \nwater-related disaster risk management;12 and (ii) sustainable development goals 6, 11, and 13.13  \n\n                                                \n9  Government of the PRC. 2018.

Licensed \ndomestic  design  institutes  prepared  all  project  components,  considering  local  geophysical, \nsocioeconomic,  and hydro-metrological  conditions,  as well  as  anticipated  climate change risks \n(rated  medium\u2013high),  in  accordance  with  PRC  design  guidelines  and  local  regulations.  The \nproject (i) considered technical alternatives (e.g., conventional dike or ecological embankments, \nfixing dams to retain water or small barrages to regulate water, continuous or discontinuous dikes, \na  stand-alone  flash  flood  early  warning  system  or  centralized  one)  and  their  technical  and \neconomic viability; (ii) deliberated ways to promote a flood footprint and accountability system in \nthe  river  basin,  ensuring  that  the  project  will  not  just  protect  localities  but  also  reduce  15.0%, \n12.0%, and 2.5% of 20-year flood peaks from Liangping to Dianjiang, Changshou, and ultimately \nthe  Yangtze  main  river  respectively;  (iii)  promoted  the  use  of  information  and  communication \ntechnology in IWRM; and (iv) optimized timescales for project implementation. \n \nB. \n \nThe economic analysis indicated that the project is economically viable, with an overall \n25. \neconomic internal rate of return of 23.2% and an economic net present value of CNY3,209 million. \nThe analysis also confirmed the economic viability of all subprojects, with economic internal rates \nof return  of  11.1%\u201326.2%.25 Sensitivity  analysis  indicated that the  project  is  robust  to  negative \nscenarios examined, such as an increase in investment costs, benefits reduction, and an increase \nin O&M cost. The full economic benefits of the project are expected to be significantly higher, as \nsome  effects  such  as  ecological  benefits  are  not  easily  quantifiable.  The  financial  analysis \nincluded  assessment  of  (i)  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  project  and  (ii)  the  financial \nmanagement capacity of the executing and implementing agencies. Financial sustainability was \nassessed based on the fiscal impact of (i) counterpart funding for the project; and (ii) incremental \nrecurrent costs, including O&M expenditures. The implementing agencies\u2014Changshou District \nGovernment, Dianjiang County Government, and Liangping District Government\u2014substantially \ndepend on state government funding. The analysis confirmed the financial sustainability of the \nproject, with the fiscal impacts well within the government\u2019s projected revenue capacities. 26 \n \nC. \n \n26. \nThe  financial  management  risk  before  considering  mitigation  measures  is  moderate \nmainly because of the moderate inherent risk, low\u2013moderate control risk, and a relatively high \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n25 Detailed Economic Analysis (available on request). \n26 The counterpart funding commitment and incremental recurrent costs are less than 2% of the projected revenue for \n\nChangshou District, Dianjiang County, and Liangping District governments. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nlevel of financial management capacities. CMG, given its experience with donor-funded projects, \nincluding ongoing ADB projects, will take overall responsibility for the financial management of \nthe project. CMG\u2019s sound financial management capacity is sufficient to support the implementing \nagencies for the financial management of the project. Measures to mitigate the identified financial \nmanagement  risks  are  in  the  financial  management  assessment. 27  The  procurement risk \nassessment  confirmed  that  the  implementing  agencies,  which  will  conduct  all  procurement \nthrough  a  procurement  agency,  have  adequate  capacity  to  implement  the  ADB  Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n(2017, as amended from time to time). ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  CMG,  and  implementing  agencies.  The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 23). \n \nD. \n \n27. \nPoverty and social. The project is classified general intervention for poverty reduction. A \ntotal of 0.895 million residents in 19 project towns, including 4,450 urban poor and 16,268 rural \npoor  people,  will  directly  benefit from  the  project  through  strengthened flood risk management \nand  better  environment and ecological  protection in the  Longxi  River  watershed.  An additional \n1.909  million  residents  in  the  three  project  counties  and  districts  will  benefit  indirectly  from \nimproved flood management and environment. The project will create 2,337 jobs during project \nimplementation and 99 jobs during operation. A poverty and social analysis has been undertaken; \nand a social development action plan has been prepared. Key social design measures include (i) \navoiding or minimizing adverse social impacts; (ii) enhancing social benefits, including targeted \nemployment for women and the poor; and (iii) strengthening public participation and consultation \nduring project preparation and implementation. Several consultation meetings with local residents \nand  stakeholders  were  undertaken  during  project  preparation,  and  additional  consultation  and \nparticipation measures are in the social development action plan and other relevant plans.  \n \nGender.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  following  ADB\u2019s \n28. \nGuidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects.28 It will benefit women, who \nconstitute 48.7% of the direct beneficiary population, by empowering them and improving their \nincome, living environment, and quality of life. A gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared \nbased  on  gender  analyses and local  consultations to ensure  gender mainstreaming  under  the \nproject.  The  key  measures  in  the  GAP  include  (i)  fair  and  equitable  participation  of  women  in \ndecision making during project design and implementation, with at least 40% women participants; \n(ii) training and capacity building of staff of the executing and implementing agencies to implement \nthe GAP and related measures; (iii) priority employment opportunities for women, with at least \n30%  during  construction  and  40%  during  operation;  (iv) participation  of  women  in  awareness \nraising in flood and environmental management and public hearing on tariffs, with 50% women \nparticipants; (v)  participation  of  women  in decision  making for  the  pilot  community-based  solid \nwaste  management  program,  with  at  least  40%  women  members  in  community  groups;  and \n(vi) ensuring  women  employees\u2019  rights  and  equitable  access  to  sanitation  facilities  and  health \neducation  (e.g.,  HIV/AIDS  awareness)  during  construction.  Key  gender  indicators  have  been \nincluded in the design and monitoring framework. \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n27 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nE. \n \n29. \ncategories are as follows:29 \n \n30. \nEnvironment  (category  A).  An  environmental  impact  assessment  and  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) have been prepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \nwas disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 20 March 2018. A grievance redress mechanism (GRM) has \nbeen prepared and comprises steps with time-based actions to ensure that any public concerns \nare quickly identified and addressed. The GRM will be operational within 60 days from the date \nof  loan  effectiveness.  The  Chongqing  provincial  management  office  and  project  management \noffice environment and social officers will lead the implementation of the GRM. The procedures \nare described in the PAM and the EMP. \n \n31. \nThe project is expected to contribute significantly to municipal targets for environmental \nimprovement,  including  improved  water  quality;  improved  flood  control,  reduced  siltation,  and \navoided flood damage; and IWRM. Construction-related issues include the potential release of \ncontaminants  from  polluted  sediments  during  dredging  or  disposal,  as  well  as  short-term \nconstruction impacts such as dust and noise. Operational risks include altered hydrology and flow \nregime  and  inadequate  O&M  of  the  project  facilities.  The  risk  of  indirect,  cumulative,  and/or \ninduced  impacts  was  assessed.  Mitigation  measures  are  described  in  the  EMP  and  include \nprocedures for the safe collection and disposal of the dredged sediments based on international \nbest practice, and green embankment designs to improve water retention and use native plantings. \nEffective EMP implementation, together with the prescribed training, will result in residual impacts \nwithin the limits of the PRC standards defined in the EMP. \n \n32. \nThe project will contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation, by increasing the \nresilience  of  the  flood  defense  and  environmental  protection  infrastructure  in  accordance  with \nanticipated  climate  impacts  on  the  hydrological  values  and  on  the  selection  of  materials  and \nlocations, and by sequestering carbon through the revegetation components. \n \n33. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category A). Of 4,193 mu of land area, 1,773 mu is existing \nstate-owned land; 1,585 mu of collective land will be obtained by land acquisition; 310 mu of land \nwill be arranged through rural infrastructure land use; and 525 mu will be used through land use \nright transfer.30 In addition, 527 mu of land will be temporarily used. A total of 32 households with \n123 persons will be relocated. A total of 5,412 households with 18,000 persons will be affected \nby  the  project\u2019s  land  use,  mostly  infrastructure along  the  riverbanks.  Three  resettlement  plans \nhave been  prepared  in accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  relevant  laws \nand regulations of the PRC. These include adequate measures of compensation, resettlement, \nand rehabilitation for affected people. Consultations were undertaken with affected people and \nlocal stakeholders during project preparation, and they will be further consulted during updating \nand  implementation  of the  resettlement  plans. GRMs  have been  established and incorporated \ninto  the  resettlement  plans.  The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  will  conduct  internal \nmonitoring  and  will  engage  an  external  monitoring  agency  to  monitor  the  implementation  of \nresettlement plans and submit semiannual monitoring reports to ADB. \n \n34. \nIndigenous  peoples  or  ethnic  minorities  (category  C).  The  project  does  not  involve \nimpacts  on  ethnic  minority  villages  or  communities  that  would  trigger  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \n\n                                                \n29 ADB.
