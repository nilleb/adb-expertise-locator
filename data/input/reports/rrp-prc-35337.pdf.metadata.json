An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was \nAssessment  undertaken,  and  the  summary  EIA  circulated  to  the  Board  on \n17 June 2004. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  was  developed  in  a  participatory  manner  and \nsustainable transport planning context. It involves building a 188-\nkilometer (km)-long expressway between Greater Nanning (Tanlou \nCity)  and  Baise  City  in  Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous  Region \n(Guangxi); constructing 25 km connecting roads; upgrading 250 \nkm intercounty and 500 km minority village roads serving isolated \npoor counties and townships; providing consulting services and \ntraining; project monitoring and evaluation (M&E); and improving \nroad  safety.  The  Project  will  support  the  provision  of  better \ntransport  services,  asset  management  and  road  maintenance \npractice,  roadside  stations  management,  enforcement  of \nregulations  on  overloaded  vehicles,  preventing  measures  for \nhuman  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency \nsyndrome (HIV/AIDS), and link markets and centers of economic \nactivity. The Project will support the Government\u2019s western region \ndevelopment strategy by building a section of the western region \ncorridor, and linking Guangxi and the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) with the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). \n   \nRationale  Guangxi, located in the southern part of the country, is bordered by \nYunnan Province on the west, Guizhou on the northwest, Hunan \non the northeast, and Guangdong on the southeast; the Gulf of \nTonkin on the south; and Viet Nam on the southwest. Guangxi is \none of the three least developed areas in the PRC. Average gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  per  capita  is  CNY5,099,  62%  of  the \nnational average. Of the 81 counties in Guangxi, 49 are classified \nas national or provincial poverty counties. Poverty and minority \ngroups are concentrated in the western part of Guangxi where the \nproposed  Project  is  located.  Inadequate  road  transport \ninfrastructure and the high cost of transport are two of the factors \ncontributing to the depressed economic conditions. Current road \ndensity in the project area is 1.3 km per 1,000 persons. Poverty is  \n ", "iv   \n  widespread, and all counties, from Greater Nanning to Baise City,  \nare  either  nationally  or  locally  designated  poverty  areas.  The \ncurrent Greater Nanning-Baise City G324 class II road has poor \ngeometrical  standards  and  traffic  has  reached  the  optimum \ncapacity. Traffic has grown at the rate of around 7% annually, \ntravel time is about 5 hours, and traffic accidents are double the \nnational average for a class II road. The high incidence of traffic \naccidents,  and  the  associated  death  and  injury  place  a  heavy \nburden on the health and welfare systems of the poor counties in \nthe project area. The local roads component of the Project will \nupgrade the lowest chain of the network to serve some of the \npoorest,  most  remote,  and  totally  isolated  communities. \nThe Project will promote trade between Guangxi, the western \nprovinces,  and  Viet  Nam.  Consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country \noperational  strategy,  the  Project  will  support  (i)  construction  of \nroads that connect major growth centers; (ii) integration of the road \nnetwork;  (iii)  improvement  of  road  safety;  (iv)  strengthening \ninstitutions and creation of a corporation; (v) enhancing regional \ncooperation; and (vi) activities to involve the private sector. \n   \n  The  Project  will  link  the  Baise-Luocunkou/Yunnan  border \nexpressway with the Nanning ring road. Thus it will form a strategic \nlink  between  Yunnan  and  Guizhou  provinces  and  the  ports  of \nFangcheng,  Qinzhou,  and  Beihai.  It  will  provide  the  western \nprovinces  better  access  to  Guangdong  and  Hunan  and  will \nimprove linkage with the 360 km border area with Viet Nam. \n   \nObjectives  The  Project\u2019s  main  objective  is  to  lower  transport  costs,  and \nthereby  enhance  economic  growth  and  contribute  to  reducing \npoverty  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  will  (i)  strengthen \nconnectivity between the national trunk highway system and local \nroads network; (ii) reduce transport prices, and improve travel time \nand comfort; (iii) provide better access to markets, services, jobs, \ngrowth centers, and isolated communities; (iv) improve road safety, \ntransport  services,  roadside  stations  management,  corporate \ngovernance, and asset management and maintenance practice; \n(v)  increase  traffic  between  the  western  provinces  and  the \nseaports in Guangxi; and (vi) improve access to the Viet Nam \nborder and the GMS. \n \n  The Project will entail (i) construction of about 188 km of a four-\nlane access-controlled toll expressway, about 25 km of connecting \nroads, 12 interchanges, 12 toll stations, 3 traffic control centers,\n8 roadside stations, and 4 asset management and maintenance \ncenters; (ii) upgrading of about 250 km of intercounty roads and \n500 km of minority villages roads; (iii) procurement of equipment \nfor asset management, maintenance, training, and expressway toll \ncollection,  surveillance,  communications,  safety,  and  vehicle-\nweighing  stations;  (iv)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement;  and\n(v) consulting services and capacity building. \n ", "  v\nCost Estimates  The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies \nand interest during construction, is estimated at $726 million \nequivalent, of which $304.1 million (42%) is in foreign exchange \nand $421.9 million (58%) equivalent in local currency. \n   \nFinancing Plan                              ($ million) \n  Source  Foreign  Local  Total  Percent \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nAsian Development Bank   200.0  0.0  200.0  28 \nChina Development Bank  104.1  167.3  271.4  37 \nMinistry of Communications  0.0  147.6  147.6  20 \nGuangxi Government Grant  0.0  107.0  107.0  15 \n      Total  304.1  421.9  726.0  100 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nLoan Amount and  A loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nTerms  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 24-year term, including \na  grace  period  of  4  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n   \nAllocation and   The PRC as Borrower will make the ADB loan proceeds available to \nRelending Terms   the  Guangxi  government  and  further  to  the  Guangxi \nCommunications  Department  (GCD)  for  constructing  the  project \nexpressway between Nanning (Tanluo) and Baise and local roads, \non the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. GCD \nwill  bear  the  interest  rate  variation  and  foreign  exchange  risks. \nA  corporatized  entity  responsible  for  management  of  the \nexpressway  will  be  established  by  September  2005  to  manage \nADB-financed  projects,  i.e.,  the  ongoing  Guangxi  Roads \nDevelopment I Project (Guangxi I), as well as this project (Guangxi \nII). \n   \nPeriod of Utilization   Until 31 December 2008 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Guangxi Communications Department  \n   \nImplementation  The  project  implementation  office  will  be  established  within \nArrangements  Guangxi  Communications  Infrastructure  Construction \nAdministration Bureau (GCICAB)  of GCD to  be responsible for \nconstruction  of  the  project  expressway.  The  local  roads \nimprovement  program  will  be  implemented  under  the  overall \nresponsibility of GCD. Operation, maintenance, and management \nof the expressway after construction will be carried out by the \ncorporation to be established under Guangxi I by September 2005. \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services financed by the ADB loan will be procured in \n ", "vi   \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works for \nthe expressway will be procured through international competitive \nbidding (ICB). Civil works for local roads will be procured through \nlocal competitive bidding or force account. The equipment packages \nwill  be  procured  through  ICB,  direct  purchase,  and  international \nshopping. ADB approved advance action for procurement of civil \nworks. \n   \nConsulting Services  About 57 person-months of international consulting services will be \n  provided under the Project (i) to assist project management over \n  the entire construction period and provide expertise in (a) road and \n  bridge design and construction, (b) asset management and road \n  maintenance,  (c)  electrical  and  mechanical  systems,\n  (d)  environmental  monitoring,  and  (e)  road  safety  and  traffic \n  management; (ii) help formulate a human resource development \n  and training program; (iii) help develop and implement a project \n  performance management system, and assess project impact on \n  poverty  reduction;  and  (iv)  help  train  staffs  for  corporate \nmanagement. About 50 person-months of international training will \nhelp  develop  the  human  resources  skills  of  GCD  subordinate \nbureaus staff and enhance their capacity in expressway and local \nroad  operation  and  maintenance,  commercialization  and \ncorporatization,  bridge  and  pavement  design  and  construction, \ncomputer software development management, transport planning, \nand intelligent transportation systems. About 4,500 person-months \nof consulting services will be undertaken by domestic consultant \nteams experienced in similar road projects. A team of domestic \nconsultants (24 person-months) will be recruited to help monitor the \nProject\u2019s socioeconomic impact, particularly on poverty reduction \nand the minorities. The international consultants financed from the \nADB  loan  will  be  recruited  under  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection method, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants. The domestic consultants will be financed by GCD \nand  recruited  in  accordance  with  government  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  will  reduce  transport  time  and  costs,  and  thereby \nBeneficiaries  promote private business, raise incomes, and create jobs. The route \nforms part of the connection between the provinces of Yunnan and \nGuizhou  and  the  Guangxi  ports  and  areas  further  east  in \nGuangdong;  Hong  Kong,  China;  and  Macau.  There  is  a  high \nproportion of through traffic on the current G324 road. The economic \ninternal rate of return for the Project is estimated at 17.8%. The \nfinancial internal rate of return after taxes is 7.0%, which is higher \nthan the real weighted average cost of capital of 2.7%. By improving \nlocal roads as well as constructing the expressway, the Project will \nhelp to improve access to market opportunities and social services \nfor the isolated rural poor living in the project area. The Project will \ndirectly and indirectly benefit over 5.6 million people, of whom 88% \nare ethnic minorities and 46% are poor. The beneficiaries include \nhouseholds in poor counties and townships, providers of transport \n ", "  vii\nservices  (261  routes)  and  their  customers,  key  industry  (over \n100,000 employees), agricultural businesses, and people living in \nthe  project  area  who  will  have  better  access  to  long-distance \ntransport.  The  Project  will  improve  access  to  93  hospitals, \n907 schools, 5 key county centers, 20 tourism attractions, 95 village \nmarkets, 70 townships, and 745 villages and isolated communities. \nThe number of deaths from road accidents will fall by 90 per annum. \nThe Project will help enhance social services, and reduce vehicle \nemissions and traffic noise. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  is  not  expected  to  face  significant  technical  risks. \n  Deep-cut  earthworks  will  be  carefully  investigated  before \n  construction and high embankments monitored prior to paving to \n  avoid implementation problems. The expected continued economic \n  growth and resulting traffic increase limit the potential economic \n  risks. Initial traffic levels were estimated based on actual traffic on \nkey  roads  in  the  project  corridor.  The  foreign  exchange  and \ninterest  rate  risks  to  be  borne  by  GCD  have  been  identified. \nADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  to  create  a  legally  independent  and \nfinancially  autonomous  expressway  company  will  promote  risk \nmanagement and mitigation by GCD. The project covenants will \nencourage GCD to adopt best practice and better manage market-\nbased  financial  costs.  The  poverty  reduction  impact  will  be \nmonitored to ensure that anticipated benefits accrue to the poor. \nThe incidence of HIV/AIDS in the region is reported to be one of \nthe highest in the PRC. The high concentration of construction \nworkers during project implementation, and improved accessibility \nand mobility resulting from the Project may aggravate the spread \nof  HIV/AIDS  and  sexually  transmitted  infections  (STIs). \nAn HIV/AIDS and STI prevention program, including a monitoring \nmechanism, will be implemented during project construction and \noperation. Several action plans were developed to facilitate project \nimplementation  and,  together  with  the  consulting  services  and \ntraining  program,  will  help  local  capacity,  facilitate  monitoring, \nstrengthen interagency coordination, and minimize risks. \n   \n \n ", "", " ", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Guangxi Roads Development II Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The PRC economy grew rapidly during the past decade\u2014averaging around 10% per \nannum\u2014and is expected to continue growing rapidly in the foreseeable future. Despite this \ngood progress, the Government\u2019s fight against poverty is far from over. There is a need to raise \nthe living standards of millions of people, particularly in the western region. The inadequate road \nnetwork, road transport bottlenecks, and the resulting high transport costs and poor levels of \nservice are core constraints to achieving key economic and social development objectives. \n \n3.  The  economy\u2019s  changing  structure  has  altered  the  pattern  of  transport  demand.  \nThe network of 1.8 million kilometers (km) of roads at the end of 2003, was longer by 44,600 km \nfrom 2002. The motor vehicle fleet is growing at 15\u201330% per annum. In 2003 the vehicle fleet \nconsisted  of  about  24.3  million  trucks,  cars,  and  buses;  and  72.3  million  other  motorized \nvehicles, mainly motorcycles and agricultural vehicles. In 1985\u20132003 the privately owned fleet of \nmotor vehicles increased more than 40 times, from 300,000 vehicles to 12.5 million. In 2003, \nroad passenger volume and passenger-km accounted for about 92.3% and 55.7%, respectively, \nof all modes. Despite its rapid increase over recent years, the motorization rate is lower than in \nmany other Asian and Pacific countries, with only 1.3 vehicles (trucks, cars, or buses) for every \n100 persons.1 Given the PRC's rapid economic growth, low vehicle ownership rates, lower car \nprices as tariff barriers fell after accession to the World Trade Organization, steadily increasing \nincomes,  increasing  access  to  loans  to  finance  automobile  purchases,  and  investment  in \nautomotive manufacturing ($6 billion provided by state banks during 2001\u20132003), the vehicle \nfleet is anticipated to grow rapidly in the coming years. The Asian Develoment Bank (ADB) is \nsupporting the improvements of road transport efficiency in the PRC.2 \n \n4.  To meet the growing demand, the Government has made major efforts to increase the \ncountry\u2019s road capacity. Roads are classified into expressways, and class I\u2013IV and unclassified \nroads (local roads).3 The backbone of the network is the national trunk highway system (NTHS), \na 35,000 km system of interprovincial expressways and high-class highways to be constructed \nby 2010. The lowest chain or lowest standard of the network is village or farm roads, which are \nnormally either class IV or unclassified. In March 2000 the Government adopted the long-term \nWestern Region Development Strategy.4 This strategy, a key theme of the Tenth Five-Year Plan \n(10FYP, 2001\u20132005), aims to reduce development disparities between the western and coastal \nregions. ADB helped the Government formulate the details of this strategy.5 \n \n5.  The Government\u2019s commitment to improve road infrastructure is reflected in a large \ninvestment  program,  which  reached  $44.9  billion  in  2003.6 The  next  stage  of  the  road \n                                                 \n1  Corresponding figures are 59.6 for Australia, 2.5 for India, 5.0 for Indonesia, 65.3 for Japan, and 14.3 for Thailand. \n2  ADB. 2004.

", "2  \ndevelopment program (2003\u20132017) will increase the network to over 3 million km, or by about \n70,000 km annually. Highway infrastructure expenditures are financed from dedicated user \ncharges,  government  grants,  domestic  bank  loans  and  bonds,  and  foreign  loans  and \ninvestments,7 as  well  as  private  sector  participation.  To  support  this  policy,  ADB  provided \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  develop  the  institutional  capacity  to  promote  corporatization, \nleasing, and securitization in the road sector.8 The proposed Project will support the Western \nRegion Development Strategy. The project framework is in Appendix 1 and the road subsector \nanalysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n6.  Despite the huge amount of investment, PRC\u2019s road network has weaknesses that are \nparticularly evident in the poor rural areas of the western region (Supplementary Appendix A). \nHigh-standard expressways account for only 1.6% of the total network, while class I roads \nrepresent 1.7%, and class II 11.8%. About 70% of the county and township roads are gravel or \nearth roads. In total, 173 townships and 56,693 villages have no road connections. No public \ntransport services are available in 1,000 townships and 160,000 villages, most of which are in \nwestern region. Expressways are built on the outskirts of key urban areas, but connections to \nthe city center are insufficient. About 85% of the total network does not have adequate traffic \nsignals, signs, or markings. Lack of transport integration and high logistics costs, have hindered \nthe development of the domestic market. \n \n7.  The rapid growth of traffic9 has resulted in increased congestion on the road network and \nan increasing number of road accidents. In 2002, 773,137 road accidents involved 109,381 \nfatalities, one of the highest rates in the world. If appropriate measures are not taken, fatalities \ncould reach 200,000 per annum by 2010. Economic losses from accidents are estimated to be \nbetween 1% and 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) per annum. The poor, who are usually \npedestrians, are disproportionately represented among those dying in road accidents. \n \n8.  Rapid socioeconomic development has increased the demand for road transport relative \nto other modes, straining road infrastructure; and necessitated adequate access to isolated \nregions, including the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi).10 Road investment is a \nprerequisite to raising productivity and achieving long-term economic growth.11 Good roads are \nalso required to allow the private sector12 to thrive and enable markets to operate efficiently.  \nA prime requirement to reduce poverty is road development, as it provides access to growth \ncenters and basic social services.13 The poor have limited mobility beyond their immediate \n                                                 \n7  During the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996\u20132000), road maintenance fees provided about 53% of financing for the road \nsubsector. Other domestic financing sources, including vehicle purchase fees, government grants, and domestic loans \nand bonds, provided about 36%. Foreign loans covered 8%. \n8  ADB. 1997.

Manila.  \nThe study concluded that insufficient and low-quality roads in poor areas are a major obstacle to economic growth.  \n11 For every CNY10,000 invested in roads, 3.2 poor people are lifted out of poverty; and for every 1.00% increase in \nkilometer of road per capita, household consumption increases by 0.08%. \n12 Poor roads are cited as the main infrastructure bottleneck faced by private firms in the western provinces.  \nAbout 21% of international companies operating on the east coast do not want to expand into the poor provinces.   \nIn Guangxi, efforts so far to involve the private sector have had very limited success. \n13 Fan, S., L. Zhang, and X. Zhang. 2000. Growth and Poverty in Rural China: The Role of Public Investments. \nWashington, DC: International Food Policy Research Institute. ", "    3 \ncommunities because of geographical isolation and the high transport cost. Roads are very \nimportant as they help lower transport and input costs, improve farming practices, and promote \nthe transition from a subsistence farming rural economy to a cash crop economy with higher \nand more stable household income flow. An ADB-financed TA,14 which selected Guangxi for \none of the pilot studies, will help the Government prepare a road transport strategy that will \nintegrate expressways and local roads to meet community needs and support economic growth. \n \n9.  The Government's road development policy is to (i) construct expressways to expand the \nNTHS to link all cities with a population of more than 500,000; (ii) develop secondary roads, \nparticularly those that will help reduce poverty and promote the rural economy; and (iii) build roads \nto support regional cooperation with neighboring countries. The road sector is the largest in \nADB\u2019s PRC operations, accounting for over 52% of the portfolio. To increase the probability that \nthe poor will benefit from ADB-funded roads, the projects have been shifted to the poor central \nand southwest regions. The scope of ADB-financed expressway projects has been broadened \nto  integrate  improvement  of  local  roads,  to  provide  better  access  to  poor  communities.  \nADB\u2019s operational strategy in the PRC gives high priority to removing infrastructure constraints \nand supporting policy reforms.15 External assistance to the PRC road subsector has come mainly \nfrom ADB, Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and World Bank. ADB coordinates \nwith the World Bank and JBIC on policy and road subsector institutional issues. Since 1991 ADB \nhas provided 27 loans totaling about $4.8 billion to finance around 4,000 km of the road network \n(Appendix 3). \n \n1.  Project Rationale \n10.  Guangxi,  is  located  in  the  southern  part  of  the  country.  It  is  bordered  by  Yunnan \nProvince on the west, Guizhou on the northwest, Hunan on the northeast, and Guangdong on \nthe southeast; the Gulf of Tonkin on the south; and Viet Nam on the southwest (Map 1).  \nThe population of Guangxi exceeded 48.2 million at the end of 2003. The area is one of the \nthree least developed in the PRC. The per capita GDP was CNY5,099 in 2003, about 62% of \nthe national average. Of 81 counties in Guangxi, 49 are designated as national (28) or provincial  \n(21) poverty counties.16 Poverty and minority groups are mainly concentrated in the west where \nthe proposed Project is located. All counties in the project area are either nationally or locally \ndesignated poverty areas. Lack of road transport infrastructure is one of the factors contributing \nto the depressed economic conditions. \n \n11.  Roads are the dominant transport mode in Guangxi. In 2003 the ownership of passenger \nvehicles increased by over 20% and freight vehicles by over 13%. The current low levels of \nownership mean that this growth is likely to be sustained, and will increases traffic and create \ncongestion on the current fragile road network. Improving the road network is essential to \nsupport  economic  growth,  connect  the  key  hubs,  and  spread  the  benefits  more  widely, \nparticularly to the poor and isolated communities. The project expressway is a segment of the \nNTHS and Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS)17 road network, and will provide an alternative \nhigh-capacity route to the existing G324 road (class II) between Greater Nanning (Tanluo City) \nand Baise City, which is one section of the national east-west highway from Hunan to Yunnan \nprovince. The existing G324 has poor geometrical standards and has reached its capacity. \nTraffic is growing at an annual rate of 7%. Travel time between Tanluo and Baise is about  \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2004.

The Project will help \npromote trade between Guangxi, the western provinces, and Viet Nam. Consistent with ADB\u2019s \noperational strategy, the Project will support (i) construction of an integrated road network,  \n(ii) added value and policy reform, and (iii) regional cooperation. \n \n2.  Lessons Learned \n12.  ADB loans have facilitated the PRC\u2019s economic growth significantly, particularly in the \npoorer regions. A performance review of completed road projects concluded that, in general, all \nloans to the road subsector in the PRC have been or are being implemented satisfactorily.18  \nThe project completion reports prepared for nine road projects conclude that eight projects19 \nwere generally successful and one was highly successful. The project performance audit report \nfor three road projects concluded that the three were either highly successful or successful. \nExperience in the PRC road subsector has indicated that while the overall performance of the \nhighway portfolio is satisfactory, some problems occurred during implementation\u23afincluding \nweak soil investigation during feasibility studies, underestimation of the technical complexity of \nexpressway  construction,  and  delays  in  resettlement  operations.  In  general,  the  portfolio \nperformance  reflects  PRC\u2019s  strong  sense  of  project  ownership,  implementation  capability, \nquality assurance, and compliance with covenants. However, some areas for improvement have \nbeen identified, including (i) making adequate provisions for operation and maintenance (O&M) \nto ensure sustainability; (ii) developing verifiable, monitorable indicators to better understand the \nsocioeconomic impact of the projects; (iii) improving the quality and quantity of ADB review \nmissions  and  project  administration;  (iv)  addressing  institutional  weakness  in  the  interior \nprovinces; (v) minimizing delayed loan signing and effectiveness and lengthy approval period for \na feasibility study and prequalification and bidding documents; (vi) addressing the institutional \nweakness  of  tendering  companies;  (vii)  improving  expressway  agencies\u2019  capability  for \nsustainable  transport  planning,  road  safety,  and  commercial  business  practices;  and  \n(viii) addressing institutional issues that limit the coordination necessary to develop integrated \nexpressways and local roads, and improve road safety. \n \n13.  The Guangxi Communications Department (GCD) has implemented two ADB-financed \ntransport projects. One after completion was assessed as highly successful, and one is under \nconstruction.20 There are also two completed World Bank-financed transport projects: an inland \nwaterway project and an expressway project. A lesson learned is that the long time it took to \nobtain approval for the feasibility study and the lengthy procedures for procuring civil works \ndelayed the start of the current Guangxi Roads Development I Project (Guangxi I). As a result, \nthe establishment of the expressway corporation was also delayed. Lessons from previous road \nprojects in the PRC have been incorporated into the project design: (i) to avoid delayed loan \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2001.

THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n14.  The Project\u2019s main objective is to lower transport costs, so as to enhance economic \ngrowth and thus contribute to reducing poverty in the project area. The Project will (i) strengthen \nconnectivity between the NHTS and the local road network; (ii) reduce transport prices, and \nimprove travel time and comfort; (iii) provide better access to markets, services, jobs, growth \ncenters, and isolated communities; (iv) promote asset management and maintenance, roadside \nstations management, transport services, road safety and enforcement, overloaded vehicles \nmanagement, social and poverty reduction impacts, and corporatization; and (v) improve traffic \nbetween the western provinces, connection to the seaports in Guangxi, and access to the Viet \nNam border and GMS. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n15.  The  Project  will  (i)  construct  about  188  km  of  a  four-lane  access-controlled  toll \nexpressway, 25 km of class II connecting roads, 12 interchanges, 12 toll stations, 3 traffic \ncontrol  centers,  8  roadside  stations,  and  4  asset  management  and  maintenance  centers; \n(ii) upgrade 250 km of intercounty roads and 500 km of minority village roads; (iii) procure \nequipment  for  asset  management  and  road  maintenance,  and  expressway  toll  collection, \nsurveillance,  communications,  safety,  and  vehicle-weighing  stations;  (iv)  address  land \nacquisition and resettlement issues; and (v) provide consulting services and capacity building. \n \nC.  Special Features \n  1.  Sustainable Transport Planning and Value Added \n16.  The Project was developed in a participatory manner and sustainable transport planning \ncontext to integrate construction of roads with policy reform issues such as transport services, \nlocation of economic centers, social and poverty issues, road maintenance, road accidents, \nroad administration, accessibility, and interagency cooperation. The Project will serve 5.6 million \npeople living in Guangxi\u2014where road density is 1.3 km per 1,000 inhabitants\u2014and about 90% \nethnic minorities, in addition to interprovincial and intercountry beneficiaries.23 Poverty incidence \n                                                 \n21 Average civil works procurement processing period of ADB-financed projects in various sectors in the PRC is about \n653 days from the Management Review Meeting to contract signing. \n22 ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Guangxi Roads Development II Project. \nManila. \n23 The project area has been classified into three categories (i) the direct project influence area (DPIA), which \nincludes 5 counties/cities with a total population of 1.9 million, and a poor population of 30\u201350% in each county; \n(ii) the area-wide project influence area (APIA), which includes 14 counties, with a total population of 3.7 million, of \nwhom 33% are poor; and (iii) the indirect project influence area (IPIA), which includes the interprovincial and \nintercountry traffic and beneficiaries. ", "6  \nin the area is 46%. The expressway and its local roads will connect totally isolated minority \nvillages and optimize the efficiency and safety of the overall road network. Direct access will be \nprovided to 5 key county centers, 907 schools, 93 hospitals, 95 village markets, 20 tourism \nattractions,  agricultural  zones,  70  townships,  and  745  villages  and  isolated  communities. \nAlignments of project roads were deliberately selected to facilitate local and intercounty or \ninterprovincial bus services and freight transport, while all project roads will be managed and \nmaintained promptly after project opening to ensure steady efficiency. To maximize income-\ngenerating  opportunities  for  poor  communities,  a  new  scheme  of  farm  development  and \nchanged crop patterns will be implemented in many of the target villages as part of the Ethnic \nMinorities Development Plan (EMDP). The scheme will cost over $10 million. All key industries \nemploying over 100,000 people in the project area will have better access to markets and inputs \nvia the improved road network. Action plans have been developed and translated with ADB \nhelp,  to  facilitate  implementation  and  monitoring  of  various  features  of  the  Project  and  to \nstrengthen stakeholder capacity and coordination. \n \n2.  Local Roads \n17.  To ensure that benefits reach the poor and meet the needs of all stakeholders, the \nProject has included constructing and upgrading 775 km of local roads, totaling over $60 million \nas follows: (i) 25 km of class II roads to link the expressway with surrounding counties and \nroads  networks,  to  serve  1.9  million  people,  of  whom  36%  are  poor  and  89%  are  ethnic \nminorities; (ii) upgrading 250 km of unclassified intercounty roads to Class III and IV to benefit \n210,000 isolated mountain people, with a poverty level of 80%; and (iii) upgrading 500 km of \nunclassified minority village roads to Class IV to serve 378,000 totally isolated people, with a \npoverty  incidence  of  77%.  The  local  roads  were  selected  from  Guangxi\u2019s  10FYP,  and  all \neconomic, social, and engineering aspects were assessed. The Project will finance around  \n$18 million of the local roads. Implementation and impact will be monitored concurrently with the \nexpressway component, with the help of the international consultants (Supplementary Appendix \nB). \n \n  3.  Asset Management and Road Maintenance \n18.  Road maintenance is becoming an increasingly important issue as the road network \nexpands and use intensity increases. To overcome current obstacles and attract staff to work in \nthe  area,  Guangxi  will  apply  a  road  maintenance  scheme,  called  \u201cunified  leadership \nmanagement.\u201d  That  is,  GCD  develops  sector  plans  and  policies,  and  local  highway \nadministration and communication bureaus at prefecture and county levels implement the road \nmaintenance plan according to GCD policies. GCD will operate the project expressway and \nlocal roads using a cost-effective asset management and maintenance strategy. The Project will \n(i) procure a relatively large proportion of equipment, $7.5 million (in addition to the traditional \nexpressway equipment) for (a) road maintenance, such as multipurpose truck and emergency \ndevices;  (b)  road  user  facilities,  e.g.,  signs  and  marks;  (c)  overloaded  vehicle  inspection \nsystems;  and  (d)  road  pavement  management  systems,  e.g.,  data  collection  and  analysis \nsoftware;  and  (ii)  strengthen  the  capability  of  Guangxi  Communications  College  (GCC)  to \nprovide  ongoing  capacity  building  and  staff  training  programs.  The  loan  will  also  finance  \n3  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  12  person-months  of  overseas  training.  \nTo ensure sustainability after project opening, the expressway fund source for maintenance will \nbe the toll revenues, while for nontolled roads, the fund sources will be the road maintenance \nfee and beneficiary resources, in addition to the contribution of GCD (Appendix 4). \n ", "    7 \n  4.  Roadside Stations \n19.  To distribute benefits in the project area, the Project was designed to include eight \nroadside stations in various counties\u2014four as parking areas with limited services, and four as \nfull service areas. Management of these stations will be awarded through competitive bidding. \nPreference will be given to contractors that will (i) provide better employment plans, and select \nemployees in consultation with the local  county women\u2019s federation and poverty reduction \noffices; (ii) promote the cultural characteristics in the relevant county; and (iii) promote road \nsafety, environmental protection, and health issues (e.g., display posters and provide leaflets on \nHIV/AIDS).24 The international consultant will help GCD implement this scheme. Three traffic \ncontrol centers, four asset management and maintenance centers, and 12 toll stations will also \nbe constructed. These facilities will create over 2,500 permanent jobs and a considerable \nnumber of support jobs, mostly to benefit local communities. \n \n5.  Transport Services \n20.  Obstacles to the development of efficient transport services in the project area include  \n(i) lack of road infrastructure; (ii) high transport costs; and (iii) lack of competition in the provision \nof passenger and freight services, and lack of facilities, e.g., spare parts and repair. Within the \nexpressway area itself, however, services are offered by road, rail, and inland waterway. Road \ntransport is the dominant mode, and accounts for two thirds of all freight traffic and 90% of local \nand  interprovincial/intercountry  passenger  traffic.  Buses  are  the  main  means  of  passenger \ntransport,  and  provide  linkages  between  homes,  farms,  markets,  places  of  employment, \nschools, hospitals, tourist spots, and other destinations. Bus operators based in the five key \ncounties of the project area run daily services on 90 separate routes. These are supplemented \nby formal services into and through the area administered by Guangxi government (171 routes), \nand a range of informal services. Freight services are provided by a range of vehicles and also \nby animals. The area also carries a substantial proportion of through traffic, particularly between \nYunnan and other western provinces, and Guangdong. The area contains over 20 important \ntourist facilities, which attract local and interprovincial bus operations. \n \n21.  Construction of the project roads will significantly increase the number of bus and freight \nservices, as operators, passengers, and farmers take advantage of the faster transit times and, \nbetter  journey  opportunities.  The  increase  in  the  number  of  services  will  lead  to  greater \ncompetition,  which,  together  with  improved  operating  conditions,  will  lead  to  reductions  in \ntransport costs to the community.25 To ensure that the opportunities expected to arise are taken \nadvantage of, the Project has included a transport services action plan (Appendix 5). The action \nplan sets out a series of steps to address issues such as anticipated shuttle buses (150), new \nrural routes (50), role of roadside stations of the Project, construction of new county bus stations \n($46 million), and industry competition and regulation. A coordinated approach will be adopted, \nwith the transport operators and local authorities working together to market and publicize the \nnew facilities. The Project has financed translation of the action plan to facilitate implementation \nand monitoring and strengthen stakeholders\u2019 sense of ownership. The international consultant \nwill help the government implement the action plan. \n \n                                                 \n24 HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n25 The operating costs for vehicles using the expressway route will typically fall by about a third. Travel time will be \nreduced by half for buses and vehicles, and by 30\u201350% for freight trucks. ", "8  \n6.  Road Safety and Traffic Enforcement \n22.  For the first time in history, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly gathered in April \n2004 for a plenary session devoted to road safety. The UN\u2019s Chief Legislative Body called on \nMember States to stimulate a new level of commitments to tackle road safety problems, which \nwill be the second cause of death facing the world during the next 10 years, particularly in the \nPRC where 1 road accident death occurs every 5 minutes. In 2003, there were 15,330 road \naccidents in Guangxi, a rate of 10 traffic accident deaths every day despite the relatively low \nlevel of vehicle ownership. The existing G324 road has a high accident rate, about twice as high \nas the national average for Class II roads, and accounts for 50\u201377% of the total accidents in the \nsurrounding  poor  counties.  The  problem  will  get  worse  as  road  congestion  increases.  \nThe Project has developed a road safety action plan in consultation with all parties. The plan \ntakes into account the requirements of the new national road safety law, which became effective \nin  May  2004,26 and  integration  of  the  4  E\u2019s\u2014engineering,  enforcement,  education,  and \nemergency. The plan has set out the steps required to manage road safety through road design, \nroad safety audit, and targeted enforcement of regulations such as seat belt use, no drunk \ndriving, no speeding, and no unruly driver behavior. The plan also covers emergency and health \ncare services. Education will address target road users, the community and children through \nlectures and publicity materials. Three static advertisements (4 m x 6 m) to be built under the \nProject will be displayed by the police in selected sites, together with awareness materials, to \nmaximize safety. This is a new initiative accepted by a police department in the PRC as part of \nan ADB-financed road project. The Project is anticipated to reduce the number of road deaths in \nthe project area by an average of 90 deaths per annum over a 15-year period. The loan will also \nfinance 4 person-months of international road safety and traffic management specialists, and  \n4 person-months of related overseas training (Appendix 6 and Supplementary Appendix C). \n \n  7.  Regional Cooperation \n23.  The project expressway will form the missing link to give the western region provinces \naccess to the seaports in southern Guangxi, particularly to the ADB-financed Fangcheng Port  \n(footnote 20), completed in 2001 and assessed as highly successful. The intercounty roads \nwere selected to connect Baise City (at km 188 of the expressway) with the Viet Nam border \nthrough Napo county, to contribute to better regional cooperation and improve connectivity of \nthe isolated mountain community along the 360 km border. Traffic on the intercounty roads\u2014\ndespite their poor and unclassified status\u2014is currently about 600 vehicles per day, and this is \nexpected to double during the first 5 years of operation. The intercounty roads will promote \nborder  trade  among  Napo  county,  Viet  Nam  and  Yunnan  Province.  The  volume  of  trade \nbetween Guangxi and Viet Nam was about $500 million in 2002, growing at 65\u201370% annually. \nCross-border trade will increase sharply after project completion. The improved connection will \nhelp develop tourism in the border areas. Before the project opens, the international consultant \nwill help GCD to prepare an efficient traffic management scheme to enhance overall road \nnetwork operations, including intercountry and interprovincial traffic. \n \n                                                 \n26 ADB has helped the Government through technical assistance (ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China for Capacity Building in Traffic Safety, Planning, and Management. Manila.) in implementing the \nnew road safety law. A specialized road safety web site has also been developed to fill current information and \ntraining gap to help DMCs to address the problem \u2013 http://www.adb.org/Projects/PRCRoadSafety/default.asp. ", "    9 \n  8.  Stakeholders Consultation \n24.  To ensure that the Project reflected the concerns of stakeholders, a relatively large \nnumber of around 4,000 people were consulted through (i) feasibility study assessment (200); \n(ii)  evaluation  of  the  preliminary  design  (150);  (iii)  social  and  economic  survey  (2000);  \n(iv)  preparation  of  final  resettlement  plan/framework  (1250);  (v)  traffic  survey  (165);  \n(vi) overloaded vehicle survey (45); and (vii) meetings with Guangxi vice governor, traffic police, \nmayors, politicians, and senior officials at provincial and county levels (170). The needs and \npriorities of stakeholders were recorded, and the information collected was used to formulate \nthe project components. All communities expressed a high degree of support for the Project. \n \n  9.  Overloaded Vehicles \n25.  Overloading of vehicles is a problem nationwide. It has a significant adverse impact on \npavement conditions, traffic flow, and safety, and results in economic losses and inconvenience \nto the community and road users. The project TA conducted a 24-hour survey on the G324 \nroad. Of the total sample of 6,000 vehicles, around 1,000 were tested and the majority were \nfound significantly overloaded. Currently, there is no system in Guangxi to monitor overloaded \nvehicles, and police enforcement is insufficient. An action plan was developed as part of the \nProject to help the government address this problem (Supplementary Appendix D). The plan \nincludes improving pavement design and installing weighing devices at the main entrances to \nthe expressway. Portable systems will also be procured under the Project to monitor overloaded \nvehicles on the local roads. To prevent overloaded vehicles from using the project roads, the \nimportance of enforcement procedures in conjunction with the police has also been addressed. \nThe international consultant will help GCD undertake the necessary measures to implement the \naction plan. \n \n  10.  HIV/AIDS \n26.  The  project  counties  are  high  risk  areas  for  HIV/AIDS.  Baise  County  is  now \nimplementing  an  efficient  HIV/AIDS  program  with  the  help  of  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development, under the guidance of the governor, who chairs the local leading \ngroup of this Project. The HIV/AIDS program will be implemented in the project area to cover  \n(i)  establishment  of  health  clinics  at  the  construction  camps,  (ii)  awareness  posters  and \nbooklets, (iii) education program, and (iv) prevention measures (Supplementary Appendix E). \nGCD and health authorities will ensure that prevention measures are in place and information \non the risks of HIV/AIDS is disseminated continuously to workers and local communities during \nconstruction and to transport operators and truck drivers during operation of the project facilities. \nThe EMDP of the Project includes prevention measures, which will also be implemented by the \ngovernment. \n \n11.  Corporatization \n27.  GCD  experienced  some  delay  in  meeting  the  covenants  for  corporatization  under \nGuangxi I. The delay was partly due to a delay of over 1 year in project commencement. It also \nreflected unease on the part of the Government over the proposed model for corporatization, \nnamely that all expressways in Guangxi should be operated by one large company. It was felt \nthat  it  did  not  offer  attractive  options  for  potential  private  sector  involvement  in  road \ndevelopment in one of the poorest areas of the PRC. \n ", "10  \n28.  The Government has now agreed to establish a corporation (the project company) for \noperation, maintenance, and management of expressways financed by ADB under Guangxi I \nand this Project (Guangxi II). GCD has agreed that (i) the project company will be established \nby 30 September 2005 for operation, maintenance, and management of both ADB-financed \nGuangxi  I  and  Guangxi  II;  (ii)  the  project  company  will  be  the  implementing  agency  (IA) \nresponsible for operation, maintenance, and management of the Guangxi I and Guangxi II \nexpressways and GCD will remain as the Executing Agency for Guangxi I and Guangxi II; (iii) a \nconcession agreement will be entered into between GCD and the project company in form and \nsubstance acceptable to ADB. The final draft concession agreement will be submitted to ADB \nby 31 July 2005, and GCD and the project company will sign the concession agreement prior to \nthe transfer of the project expressway and project company. Guangxi I will be transferred to the \ncompany no later than 30 September 2005, and Guangxi II after completion of construction \n(Supplementary Appendix F). GCD has started processing the establishment of the company \naccording to the agreement. A company preparatory committee was formulated on 28 April \n2004, which was a condition for the appraisal on 27 May 2004. Preparation of the company draft \ncharter was a condition for loan negotiation as was the regional government\u2019s approval of the \nestablishment of the company. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n29.  The total project cost is estimated at about $726 million equivalent, with $304.1 million in \nforeign exchange and $421.9 million equivalent in local currency (Appendix 7). \n \nTable 1: Summary of Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

The $200 million ADB loan will be from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. Provided in US \ndollars, the loan will have a maturity period of 24 years, including a grace period of 4 years, an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, conversion options that may \nbe exercised in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Regulations, ADB\u2019s Conversion Guidelines, and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement.  Interest  will  be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. The Borrower will be the ", "    11 \nPRC. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for PRC\u2019s decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions; and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were the PRC\u2019s own independent decision and not made in \nreliance on any communication or advice of ADB. The proceeds from ADB\u2019s loan will be made \navailable to the Government, which will in turn make the loan proceeds available to Guangxi, on \nthe same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. GCD will bear the interest rate \nvariation  and  foreign  exchange  risks.  About  $526  million  equivalent  will  be  required  as \nGovernment counterpart funds to implement the Project. The Government has agreed that the \ncounterpart funds would be made available in a timely manner. \n \nTable 2: Summary of Financing Plan \n($ million) \nForeign  Local  Total \nSource  Percent\nExchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n  1.  Project Management \n31.  GCD will be the Executing Agency for the Project. A project management office (PMO) \nwill be established in GCD headquarters to coordinate and monitor all project activities and \nadministration matters. The PMO will coordinate with the Provincial Finance Bureau on loan \ndisbursement and repayment. A project construction office (PCO) will also be established at the \nproject  site  to  deal  with  construction  issues.  A  deputy  director  responsible  for  physical \nimplementation of project activities on a day-to-day basis and the preparation of progress \nreports will head the PCO. A team of qualified engineering, financial, and administrative staff will \nbe assigned. The local roads program will be implemented by various agencies under the \nguidance of GCD, and a land acquisition and resettlement leading group has been established. \nThe financial management assessment conducted during project appraisal concluded that the \nProject would have in place an adequate project financial management system that can provide, \nwith  reasonable  assurance,  accurate  and  timely  information  on  the  status  of  the  Project.  \nThe  financial  management  questionnaire  was  completed  during  project  appraisal,  and  is \nattached to Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n32.  Preconstruction activities including preliminary and detailed design, and preparation of \nprequalification  and  bidding  documents  have  all  been  completed.  The  opening  of \nprequalification of contractors for civil works was on 28 July 2004. The central Government \napproved the feasibility study on 21 July 2004. The target date for starting the expressway is the \nfourth quarter of 2004, while the target date for completing construction activities is the second ", "12  \nhalf of 2007. The overall Project, including full testing of the equipment and trial period, will be \ncompleted in June 2008 (Appendix 8). Under GCD\u2019s supervision, local roads will be upgraded \nconcurrently with expressway construction and in compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies. \n \n3.  Procurement \n33.  All ADB-financed procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The civil \nworks for the project expressway will be divided into 12 packages, 10 of which will be financed \nby the loan and procured under international competitive bidding (ICB), including the relevant \nconnecting  roads.  Six  expressway  pavement  packages  will  also  be  procured  under  ICB.  \nOne expressway equipment package, and 12 asset management and maintenance equipment \npackages  will  be  procured  through  ICB,  direct  purchase,  and  international  shopping. \nProcurement for intercounty roads (11 packages) will be through LCB and procurement of \nminority village roads (5 main packages) will follow force account procedures. International \nbidding will be handled by two tendering companies qualified to perform the task and has \nprevious experience in other externally funded projects. All equipment will be used solely for the \npurpose of expressway communications, surveillance and toll system, capacity building, or for \npostconstruction operations. No equipment financed by ADB will be used for construction or \nhired out to the civil works contractors (Appendix 9). \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n34.  Construction supervision involving about 4,500 person-months of consulting services will \nbe undertaken by domestic consultant teams experienced in implementing similar road projects. \nA chief supervision engineer will head the domestic consultants\u2019 teams, which will be financed \nby GCD and recruited in accordance with local procedures satisfactory to ADB.  The loan will \nfinance  57  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  to  (i)  assist  in  project \nmanagement over the entire construction period; (ii) provide expertise in bridges, road safety \nand  traffic  management,  asset  management  and  maintenance,  electrical  and  mechanical \n(E&M),  environmental  impact,  corporate  management,  and  benefit  monitoring  and  social \nimpacts. The team leader will act as the deputy chief engineer with authority to sign, certify, and \nmake  recommendations;  will  provide  36  person-months  input  over  the  entire  construction \nperiod; and will help the chief supervision engineer. International training covering 50 person-\nmonths is included under international consulting services to develop GCD staff\u2019s skills and \nenhance capacity in road planning, construction, and operations (Supplementary Appendix H). \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n35.  The ADB loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nSince  most  payments  will  be  made  for  large  contracts  above  $100,000,  direct  payment, \nreimbursements, and commitment procedures will be used. If the Government initially funds \neligible  expenditures,  ADB's  reimbursement  procedure  will  be  followed.  To  facilitate \ndisbursements,  an  imprest  account 27  will  be  established  by  Guangxi  Finance  Bureau \nimmediately after loan effectiveness. Disbursements from the imprest account will be supported \nby an appropriate withdrawal application and related documentation. The ceiling of the imprest \naccount will be set as either the estimated expenditures for the next 6 months, or 10% of the \nloan amount, whichever is lower. The statement of expenditures (SOE) will apply to payments \nunder $200,000 for reimbursement and imprest account procedures. \n \n                                                 \n27 The imprest account is being used in World Bank-financed loans. The utilization performance has been satisfactory. ", "    13 \n6.  Advance Procurement Action \n36.  During  project  processing,  the  Government  requested  ADB\u2019s  approval  for  advance \nprocurement action for civil works.28 Advance procurement action was approved on 24 May \n2004. It covers prequalification of contractors, tendering, and bid evaluation for civil works \npackages, but does not include the signing of contracts. The advance actions will be undertaken \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The prequalification documents were \nissued to bidders on 28 May 2004, and the bidding documents were submitted to ADB in June \n2004. The Government and GCD have been advised that approval of advance action does not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project. A shortlist of international consulting firms for construction \nsupervision was also approved by ADB on 25 May 2004. It covers selection of the appropriate \nfirm, but not including contract signing which is subject to loan effectiveness. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n37.  Previous  ADB-financed  road  projects  in  Guangxi  have  a  good  record  of  financial \nreporting. GCD will maintain separate accounts for the Project and related financial statements, \nsuch as statements of source and application of funds, implementation of the Loan Agreement, \nand balance sheet. The income statements will be prepared for the first full year of commercial \noperation of the project expressway. GCD will prepare one set of financial statements for the \nProject and another for consolidated accounts following the establishment of the corporation, \nand will have them audited annually. The audit will be in accordance with appropriate auditing \nstandards  consistently  applied  by  independent  external  auditors  whose  qualifications, \nexperience, and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB. GCD will submit to ADB, within  \n6 months of the end of each related fiscal year, certified copies of audited project accounts and \nfinancial  statements  and  an  auditor\u2019s  report  for  the  Project,  all  in  the  English  language.  \nDuring the midterm review (para. 41) scheduled for 2006, GCD\u2019s financial projections for the \nproject expressway for the next 5 years will be submitted to ADB for review and thereafter \nupdated annually. The Government has agreed that arrangements satisfactory to ADB will be \nmade for reporting implementation progress. During construction, GCD will submit quarterly \nprogress  reports  in  such  form  and  detail  as  ADB  may  request.  To  facilitate  project \npostevaluation, GCD will furnish ADB a completion report within 3 months of the end of the \nProject.  GCD  will  submit  to  ADB  reports  on  contract  management  procedures  (including \napproval of variation orders), forecast traffic volumes, proposed toll tariff increases, benefit \nmonitoring, and other activities within the time stipulated in the Loan and Project Agreements. \n \n38.  As a SOE and imprest fund facility will be provided under the Project, the special- \npurpose audit should include a separate opinion on (i) utilization of the imprest account; (ii) SOE \nincluding  whether  the  amount  claimed  was  duly  supported  to  the  extent  verified;  and  \n(iii) whether or not GCD was operating the imprest account in accordance with ADB procedures. \n \n8.  Anticorruption \n39.  ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to the government officials. Attention was \ndrawn  to  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption  that  was  added  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement  and  Guidelines on  the  Use  of Consultants,  particularly  the  need  for  bidders, \nsuppliers, contractors, and consultants to be ethical in procuring and executing ADB-financed \ncontracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. GCD has agreed to include \n                                                 \n28 This Project was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (ADBBO) in March 2004, and approval of advance \naction was reported in the May 2004 issue. ", "14  \nthe relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy in all documents and contracts governing \nproject implementation. ADB\u2019s PRC program includes assistance29 that will improve governance \nand encourage fraud reduction. The central Government is undertaking serious measures to \nfight corruption, and the March 2004 report has addressed this issue and identified some  \n15 cases within various provincial communications departments during recent years. None of \nthese  cases  was  associated  with  ADB\u2013financed  projects  in  the  PRC.  GCD  has  a  good \nreputation in implementing previous ADB and World Bank projects. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n40.  GCD has agreed on a set of indicators for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of project \ngoals  and  objectives.30 Where  relevant,  indicators  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender.  The \nbaseline indicator values will be collected before project implementation. The indicator values \nwill be updated at midterm, completion, and annually for 3 years after completion, as shown in \nthe  outline  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS).  A  report  summarizing  the \nfindings and analysis of the project impacts will be incorporated annually in the second quarterly \nreport submitted to ADB. With the assistance of the international consultant, a domestic institute \nto be recruited by GCD (24 person-months) will develop the PPMS, collect and analyze data, \nconduct surveys, and prepare PPMS progress and monitoring reports in consultation with ADB \n(Appendix 10). \n \n10.  Project Review \n41.  ADB, Government, and GCD will carry out a midterm review of the Project in 2006, \nfocusing  on  all  institutional,  administrative,  organizational,  technical,  environmental, \nresettlement, social, poverty reduction, economic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may \nimpact on project performance and viability. In consultation with national Government agencies \nconcerned,  the  review  will  examine  and  update  the  status  of  sector  reforms,  policy \ndevelopment, and compliance with loan covenants. ADB will update the anticipated project \nsocioeconomic and financial performance based on updated data and traffic projections. \n \n11.  Capacity Building and Human Resources Development \n42.  The international consultant for construction supervision will provide on-the-job training \nfor GCD staff and domestic consultants in construction supervision, quality control, and road \nnetwork management. Domestic consultants will provide training in a variety of road engineering \nand  management  subjects.  An  international  training  program  for  50  person-months  will  be \nfinanced under the loan. The international consultant will help GCD develop the program. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n43.  Travel Demand. The Project will increase transport capacity to meet the demand and \nreduce travel distance. The traffic on the expressway is forecast to grow from about 10,700 \nPCU31 per day when facilities are commissioned in 2007, to about 47,100 PCU in 2026. Traffic \n                                                 \n29 ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Strengthening the Government Auditing \nSystem. Manila. \n30 The indicators were refined based on the findings of the project TA (footnote 22) and other studies. \n31 PCU = passenger car unit. PCU is the official unit for measuring traffic for all classes of roads in the PRC in \naccordance with the new technical standard of highway engineering, which became effective on 1 March 2004. ", "    15 \nflows are based on an average real toll per vehicle-km increasing from about CNY0.88 in 2007 \nto almost CNY1.00 in 2027. Local roads will also experience significant traffic growth. The traffic \nprojections take into account (i) expected economic growth in the project area; (ii) additional \ntraffic generated by the Project due to enhanced development potential in the area; (iii) increase \nin interprovincial and intercountry traffic, and (iv) impact of the toll level (Appendix 11). \n \n44.  Economic  Benefits.  The  economic  impacts  of  the  Project  were  analyzed  for  the \nexpressway,  the  local  roads  component,  and  the  two  combined.  Without  the  Project,  the \nincreased traffic in the corridor will cause congestion, increase vehicle operating costs (VOCs), \nand reducing road safety and accessibility. The expressway will provide the needed increase in \ncapacity. Economic benefits of traffic transferring to the expressway from the existing G324 \ninclude travel time savings, savings in transport costs allowing more efficient transport services, \nand increases in safety and comfort. Environmental benefits which will also come from the \nreduced vehicle emissions and noise were not included in the analysis because of a lack of \nsuitable data and evaluation methodology. GCD will build noise barriers along the expressway \nwhere required. The lower transport costs will facilitate further economic growth in the area, \nleading to higher traffic flows and toll revenues. Traffic continuing to use the existing G324 will \nbenefit  from  reduced  congestion  and  accidents.  The  expressway's  economic  costs  cover \nconstruction, land acquisition and resettlement, environmental management, and O&M. For the \nlocal roads component, benefits arise from (i) the increased per capita incomes in remote areas \ndue to lower transport costs and improved access resulting in better agricultural prices, cheaper \ninputs, and improved access to markets; (ii) savings in VOCs; and (iii) increased personal \nmobility giving greater employment opportunities and allowing social interaction and improved \naccess  to  facilities,  all  of  which  will  help  raise  the  overall  level  of  welfare  of  the  project \nbeneficiaries. With an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 17.8%, for the combined \nexpressway and local roads, the Project is considered economically viable. The EIRR for the \nexpressway component itself is 17.1% and that for the local roads is about 65%. This high figure \nreflects the relatively low costs of the upgrading proposed for these roads and the substantial \nbenefits that are potentially achievable with improved accessibility. Likely changes in the key \nvariables or an assessment of the risks do not significantly affect viability, and in the entire set of \nstandard  tests  the  EIRR  remains  well  above  the  12%  threshold  (Appendix  12  and \nSupplementary Appendix I). \n \n45.  Financial Benefits. The toll rates proposed for the project roads are in line with tolls \nproposed for other roads in Guangxi. Given the traffic forecast and toll levels, the financial \nperformance of the Project is satisfactory (Appendix 13). To confirm the appropriate toll level \nGCD will undertake a toll study before opening the expressway and yearly for 5 years thereafter \nand will submit the results to ADB for comment. The level of the tolls will be designed to ensure \nthat  the  revenue  will  cover  O&M  costs,  debt  service,  and  depreciation  in  excess  of  debt \nservicing; and generate an acceptable rate of return on the investment. Financial evaluation was \nundertaken in real terms using constant 2004 prices. The project cost estimates and financial \nprojections in nominal terms were converted to real terms by adjusting for the projected effects \nof foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuation. Incremental costs and benefits were \nderived by evaluating the financial position of the GCD in with- and without-project scenarios. \nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the Project, computed on an after-tax basis, is \n7%. This compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 2.7%, also \ncomputed  on  an  after-tax  basis.  The  Project  is  considered  both  financially  viable  and \nsustainable. Sensitivity and risk analysis indicates that the FIRR for the Project overall is robust \nunder  adverse  conditions.  The  more  detailed  financial  analysis  is  in  Appendix  14  and \nSupplementary Appendix G. \n ", "16  \n46.  Social  Benefits  and  Poverty  Reduction  Impacts.  Socioeconomic  surveys  of  the \nbeneficiaries found that inadequate road access prevented farmers and poor communities from \nearning adequate income. All survey participants, particularly residents of the isolated minority \nvillages  and  intercounty  areas  ranked  road  infrastructure  as  a  second  need  after  food  or \nincome. Among 28 mountain villages surveyed, the annual per capita income was CNY875 for  \n9 villages served only by footpaths. The corresponding figures are CNY1,425 for villages with \ngravel road access and over CNY1,500 for villages with some paved road access. The Project \nwill link poor areas to NTHS and county and village networks; will expand economic and social \nactivities; strengthen cultural links; and improve access to markets, health centers, schools, and \nother services. The Project will promote a commercial environment where farmers can grow \nmore cash crops or fruits, including winter season vegetables and sugarcane, and have better \ntransport facilities. The Project will enable poor farmers to increase their incomes at an annual \nrate of 10\u201315%32 in the next 5 years. The Project will use about 500,000 person-months of \nunskilled  local  labor  as  construction  workers  for  over  3  years,  while  the  operation  of  the \nexpressway  will  create  over  2,500  permanent  jobs 33  covering  road  administration  and \nmaintenance, and roadside stations. The Project will facilitate the development of the aluminum \nindustry, the backbone industry of the project area as well as of Guangxi, from the current  \n1.2 million tons of alumina powder to 5 million tons in 5\u201310 years, creating employment and \nmore foreign investment opportunities in the area. Other effects of traffic growth will include a \nrapid  increase  in  vehicle  ownership,  the  provision  of  competitive  transport  services, \nurbanization,  tourism,  and  road  safety  improvement.  The  combination  of  these  effects  will \nreduce poverty on a sustainable basis. The social analysis found that there would be 2.9 million \ndirect project beneficiaries, accounting for 52% of the total population (5.6 million) of the project \narea. Rural households will be the largest beneficiary group (78%). Net direct project benefits \namounting to 40% will go to the poor of the project area in Guangxi. Over time the benefits will \naccrue to a much bigger population, reflecting the benefits of intercountry and interprovincial \ntraffic (Appendix 15). \n \nB.  Impacts \n47.  Social and Gender Impacts. The Project will benefit both women and men. Women are \nthe  main  contributors  to  farming  activities\u2014marketing  small  surplus  production\u2014and  are \nresponsible for household chores. Young women travel frequently to Guangdong and other \nlarge cities as migrants from the project area. Reduced travel costs, more readily available and \nmore frequent public transport, and better roads will help improve the lives of women and \nchildren.  Improved  transport  will  result  in  better  access  to  health  and  social  facilities.  \nWomen living along the expressway and those living near the contractors' camps will benefit \nfrom catering to the construction workers and from providing services to and employment in the \nroadside stations following project operation. Half of the employees in the roadside stations will \nbe women.34 \n \n48.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The expressway will directly affect 18 townships, \n70 villages, and 505 village groups in six districts and counties. The expressway and connecting \nroads will require 1,434 ha of land. About 313 ha of land will be temporarily borrowed during the \nconstruction phase. The degree of impact is equivalent to 13,141 persons completely losing \ntheir  farmland.  Also,  360  households  (1,584  persons)  will  have  to  relocate  their  houses.  \nRoad  alignments  were  selected  based  on  impact  surveys  and  consultations  with  local \n                                                 \n32 Average incomes for the 28 national poverty counties increased by 6.5% from 2001 to 2002. \n33 Ten employees per km in the case of the ADB Hebei section of the Beiing-Shanghai Expressway. \n34 Women employees make up 60% in the service areas of the ADB-financed expressway in Hebei Province. ", "    17 \ncommunities to minimize impacts on paddy land, vegetable land, and housing. Consequently, \nthe project impact at the village level is relatively moderate. A resettlement plan (RP) was \nprepared based on impact surveys and consultations. The resettlement budget for the proposed \nexpressway and connecting roads (25 km) is $75.5 million equivalent. A resettlement booklet in \nChinese was distributed to affected households and publicized in the local media in May 2004, \nto  give  information  on  resettlement  impacts,  resettlement  policy,  compensation  rates, \norganizational arrangements, and grievance procedures. \n \n49.  For the 250 km intercounty roads, investigations were carried out in three counties and \nthe results are included in the RP. Upgrading those roads will require acquisition of 118 ha and \naffect the equivalent of 498 people. An estimated 67 houses with 296 people will be relocated. \nThe cost of land acquisition and resettlement is $1.7 million equivalent, which is included in the \ncost estimates for the intercounty roads. For the minority village roads (500 km), the land \nacquisition procedure may differ for some roads that fall completely within the jurisdiction of \nadministrative villages, so there is no transfer of land. If some villagers lose land, they will be \ncompensated for their loss according to local laws and regulations, which normally involve the \nprovision of replacement land. A resettlement framework (RF) was prepared for the minority \nvillage roads and was appended to the RP. The final RP and RF were approved by GCD in \nJune  2004  and  uploaded  on  ADB\u2019s  website  in  September  2004  (Appendix  16).  During \nimplementation, affected groups will be consulted further and will participate in the monitoring. \nThe local government is responsible for implementing the RP and RF but the village and group \nleaders will make the key decisions and take action. \n \n50.  Ethnic Minorities. The project area is the original homeland of the Zhuang people. \nThe Zhuang account for over 87% of the total population, while the Yao make up about 3%.  \nThe project expressway will facilitate economic development and the local roads will benefit the \nremote areas. The minority village roads program will benefit 378,000 people, of whom 98% are \nminorities. The Project is not expected to have any adverse impacts on minorities, except for \nland acquisition. To enhance the benefits for ethnic minorities, the Project will take special \nmeasures, which are set out in an EMDP developed under the project TA in consultation with \nethnic minority villages and the local government. The final EMDP was approved by GCD in \nJune 2004 and uploaded on ADB\u2019s website in September 2004 (Appendix 17). \n \n51.  Environmental Impacts and Vehicle Emissions Control. The Project is classified as \nenvironmental category A by ADB. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) concluded that \nall impacts can be successfully mitigated if existing national and local standards are followed. \nThe Project poses low environmental risks. It will reduce vehicle emissions as a result of \nimproved motor vehicle engine efficiency when operating on the expressway, compared with the \nwithout-Project scenario. Traffic noise barriers will be installed as required. As much of the \ntraffic on the existing G324 will be diverted to the expressway, noise levels, vehicle emissions, \nand emergency operations along G324 are expected to diminish, benefiting a large number of \npeople, as well as schools, hospitals, and other sensitive receptors. The summary EIA was \ncirculated  on  17  June  2004,  and  its  monitoring  program  and  mitigating  measures  will  be \nimplemented in the project area. \n \nC.  Risks \n52.  The  Project  is  not  subject  to  any  significant  technical  risks,  given  GCD\u2019s  proven \nexperience  and  good  performance  in  implementing  this  type  of  project.  Prequalification  of \ncontractors  will  focus  on  their  technical  and  financial  capability  to  handle  complex  works.  \nWith the help of the international consultants, monitoring and efficient project management ", "18  \nsystems will be set up for timely identification of technical problems and carrying out corrective \nmeasures. High-standard equipment will be procured and staff will be selected on their merits to \nimplement  the  Project  and  operate  its  facilities.  Action  plans  have  been  formulated  and \ntranslated to facilitate implementation and prevent adverse impacts. The expected continued \nstrong economic growth and forecasts based on actual traffic trends in the area indicate that the \ncontinuously  increasing  traffic  limits  the  risk  that  economic  benefits  will  not  materialize.  \nThe proposed toll level is consistent with the local economy and reflects the trend in tolls for \nGuangxi expressways. The foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk to be borne by GCD will \nbe identified in the ADB loan agreement. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue, designed to create a legally \nindependent  and  financially  autonomous  expressway  company,  will  promote  financial  risk \nmanagement and mitigation. The project covenants will encourage GCD to adopt best practice. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n53.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n54.  Construction Quality. The government of Guangxi will cause GCD to ensure that the \nproject expressway and local roads are constructed or upgraded with reference to the highway \ndesign  manual  developed  under  ADB-financed  TA  2573-PRC,35 where  required,  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s 2004 technical standard of highway engineering; and that the standards and \nconstruction  supervision  under  the  Project  follow  nationally  and  internationally  accepted \npractices. \n \n55.

The road network of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) totaled 1.8 million kilometers \n(km)  at  the  end  of  2003,  an  increase  of  44,600  km  from  2002.  However,  it  is  still \nunderdeveloped in quality and extent. High standard roads, expressways, and class-1 and \nclass-2 highways account for only 15% of the total network. The remaining 85% are medium- to \nlow-grade paved roads and gravel roads. In Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi), \nthe total length of the road network was 56,300 km, of which high-standard roads accounted for \n6,044 km (11%) in 2003. At the end of 2003, the total length of expressways exceeded 1,000 \nkm, while the length of the road network grew by 3.8% annually during 1990\u20132003. The road \nquality is poor in general. Class IV and unclassified roads account for 75% of the network.  \n \nB.  Vehicle Fleet and Traffic \n \n2.  In 2003 the PRC vehicle fleet consisted of over 24.2 million trucks, cars, and buses (12.4 \nmillion privately owned), and over 72.3 million other motorized vehicles, mainly motorcycles and \nagricultural vehicles. The privately owned motor vehicle fleet increased more than 40 times \nduring 1985\u20132003, from 300,000 to 12.4 million vehicles. Despite this rapid increase, there are \nonly about 1.3 vehicles per 100 persons, a ratio that is lower than that in many other Asian and \nPacific countries.1 The PRC\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization in December 2001 \nreduced the cost of imported vehicles, increased investment in automobile production, and \nmade automotive financing more readily available. The modernization of the vehicle fleet will \nimprove  vehicle  safety,  and  reduce  fuel  consumption  and  vehicle  emissions.  In  2003,  the \nnumber of vehicles grew rapidly in Guangxi. At the end of 2003, the total number of vehicles \nexceeded 403,000, an increase of 14% over 2002. The number of private vehicles totaled \n166,800 units, about 27% higher than in 2002, and is expected to continue growing rapidly. \n \n3.  In the PRC, road passenger volume and passenger-km account for 92.3% and 55.7%, \nrespectively, of all transport modes, while road freight and freight km account for 74.3% and \n13.2%, respectively. Road traffic in Guangxi has increased rapidly. In 2003, the passenger traffic \nexceeded 426 million persons, while freight traffic reached 245 million tons. Roads account for \n92% of passenger trips and 73% of freight lifted. \n \nC.  Road Transport Services \n \n4.  In 2003, about 900,000 buses were in operation in the PRC compared with 764,000 in \n2002. The number of bus routes reached 85,000 to serve more than 94% of villages accessible \nby road. In Guangxi, the number of vehicles for public transport services reached 34,000 in \n2003. Of these, 10,300 passenger vehicles with 148,700 seats and 63,700 freight vehicles with \n191,700 tons capacity were owned by private transport service providers. There were 128,000 \npublic transport service businesses, employing a total of 384,900 people. In 2003, 230 long-\ndistance passenger bus stations and 115 freight transport stations served 4,230 long-distance \npassenger  transport  routes  in  Guangxi,  covering  1,381  townships  and  11,679  villages.  \nThere were also 14,172 vehicle and motorcycle repair shops, and 105 driver training schools.  \n \n5.  In May 2001, a cross-border tourist bus service was opened between Dongxin City in \nGuangxi and Mangjie City in Viet Nam. In September 2001, The Governments agreed to issue \n1,200 licenses to the PRC and Viet Nam freight trucks for cross-border transportation. It was \n                                                 \n1  Figures for other countries are 59.6 for Australia, 2.5 for India, 5.0 for Indonesia, and 65.3 for Japan. ", "26  Appendix 2 \nalso agreed that regular passenger bus services be opened between Nanning and Xialong (in \nViet Nam), and between Beihai and Xialong.  \n \nD.  Road Administration \n \n6.  Road administration in the PRC is decentralized. At the provincial and autonomous level, \ncommunications departments (CDs) are responsible for highway network development and \nmaintenance. Generally they are financially independent of the Government, except for large \nprojects of national significance. The Ministry of Communications (MOC) provides guidance and \nsupport to CDs through national policies, regulations, and standards. Provincial and regional \nplanning  commissions  approve  development  plans  and  projects.  Road  safety  and  annual \nvehicle testing are under the Ministry of Public Security at national and local levels. Inspection of \nvehicle emissions is the responsibility of local environmental protection bureaus in collaboration \nwith provincial public security bureaus. Road sector agencies are generally well staffed. In the \ntransport sector, executing agencies have been making good use of the knowledge transfer and \nin-country and external training opportunities provided under Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nprojects.2 Road transport efficiency and quality are improving, and ADB supported this process.3 \n \nE.  Road Sector Revenues and Expenditures \n \n7.  The PRC's road investment needs from 1996 to 2010 are estimated at $504 billion. \nAvailable revenues are estimated at $302 billion from road-user charges, and $29 billion from \ntoll collections, leaving a financing gap of $173 billion or about $12 billion per year. Consistent \nwith ADB's policy dialogue, the Government is creating a framework to attract private sector \nfinance for road construction. While the private sector is interested in financing the high-grade \nand provincial road networks under concession agreements under certain circumstances, its \ncontribution to build-operate-transfer projects is hindered by the initial risks of construction and \ntraffic  demand.  Expenditures  for  highway  infrastructure  are  financed  from  dedicated-user \ncharges, central Government grants, domestic bank loans and bonds, and foreign loans and \ninvestments.  MOC  provided  supplementary  financing  of  about  2%  of  the  requirements  to \nconstruct or rehabilitate rural roads in poor areas. Domestic loans were low, accounting for 9% \nof all highway investments. Based on the findings of ADB-financed technical assistance (TA),4 \nthe fuel tax is likely to improve financing of the road sector. Foreign loans covered 8% of \ninvestment in highway construction, and foreign direct investment the remaining 3%, mainly \nfrom ADB, Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and World Bank. \n \nF.  Road Engineering, Construction, and Maintenance \n \n8.  Road  projects  are  designed  by  planning  and  design  institutes  at  the  provincial, \nprefecture, and county levels which are staffed with experienced, well-qualified personnel. MOC \nreviews  the  designs  of  expressways,  high-standard  roads,  and  associated  structures,  and \nimplements measures to enhance quality control and inspection regime. The city and county \nhighway bureaus have their own construction units to carry out minor projects within their \nadministrative districts. Drawing on experience gained under projects financed by ADB and \nWorld Bank, the 1999 Tendering and Bidding Law5 mandated competitive bidding practices.  \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1998.

Introduction \n1.  The  Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous  Region  (Guangxi)  currently  applies  a  road \nmaintenance  scheme,  called  \u201cunified  leadership  management.\u201d  That  is  the  Guangxi \nCommunications  Department  (GCD)  develops  and  implements  sector  management  plans, \npolicies  and  regulations,  and  the  local  highway  administration  bureau  (LHAB)  and  local \ncommunication bureau (LCB)1 at prefecture and county levels implement the road maintenance \nplan according to GCD policies and regulations (Table A4). \n \nB.  Institutional Framework \n2.  Under the GCD, several departments are responsible for road maintenance: (i) planning \nadministration divisions: responsible for making the road maintenance plan, budgeting, and \ncapacity building and staff training for all roads; (ii) Expressway Administration Bureau (GEAB): \nresponsible  for  expressways  maintenance  and  employing  a  staff  of  284;  (iii)  Highway \nAdministration Bureau (GHAB): responsible for maintaining national and provincial highways and \npart  of  county  roads,  and  employing  over  20,000  staff;  and  (iv)  local  communication \nadministration bureaus (CAB): responsible for rural road maintenance, including part of county \nroads (with light traffic) and township and village roads. In addition, township governments \nparticipate in local road maintenance with technical support from the county local CAB. Some \ncorporatized expressways and highways are maintained by their companies. Village roads are \nmaintained by villagers. \n \n3.  For expressways and tolled highways, the fund source for maintenance is the toll revenue.  \nFor nontolled highways and roads, the source is mainly the road maintenance fee. Maintenance \nworker teams for routine maintenance such as surface cleaning and minor pavement repairs are \nrecruited  by  GEAB  and  GHAB  at  the  rate  of  one  worker  per  2  km  of  road.  For  periodic \nmaintenance, external construction companies are recruited through public bidding. At prefecture \nand county levels, the local CAB is responsible for routine maintenance, while major maintenance \nprograms  are  directly  managed  by  GHAB.  A  township  government  directly  carries  out \nmaintenance of township roads with support from the county CAB. Most villagers themselves \nmaintain  the  village  roads.  The  beneficiaries  maintain  some  special  roads,  which  connect \nfactories and other activities. \n \nTable A4: Road Maintenance Framework in Guangxi\u20132003 \n \n    National  Provincial  County Road  Township  Village \nItem  Expressway  Highway  Road  Road  Road \nLength   1,000 km  4,968 km  5,488 km  20,444 km  24,427 km   \nResponsibility  GHAB  GHAB  GHAB  GHAB  LCB  Village \n    LCB \nBudget  $25,000 per  RMB9,000 per  RMB9,000 per  RMB100 million    Villager \nkm (R), and  km(R), and  km(R), and  for all roads,  resources \n$55,000 per  RMB 90,000  RMB 90,000  including \nkm (P)  per km (P)   per km (P)   townships \nFund Source  Toll  Toll,  Toll,  Maintenance  Maintenance  Villager \nmaintenance  maintenance  Fee  fee  resources \nfee  fee \nEquipment  Good   Good  Moderate/Poor  Poor  Very poor  None \nConditions  /Moderate \nGHAB = Guangxi Highway Administration Bureau, km = kilometer, LCB = local communication bureau, P = periodic \nmaintenance, R = routine maintenance. \n                                                 \n1  Local highway administration bureaus and communication bureaus are functioning agencies of local governments. ", "Appendix 4    33\nC.  Issues in Road Maintenance \n4.  Current  obstacles  of  road  maintenance  in  Guangxi  include  (i)  maintenance \nplanning\u2014Road maintenance planning is comparatively weak due to the need for the road \nstructure itself. As a result, the nonincome-generating roads (no toll) particularly rural roads suffer \nfrom lack of maintenance and resources; (ii) insufficient fund; (iii) need for more basic and \nadvance equipment; (iv) lack of skilled maintenance staff\u2014The problem is that engineers and \ntechnicians consider working in maintenance divisions poor for their career prospects and prefer \nto work in design or construction offices; therefore careers in maintenance must be made more \nattractive in order to attract high-quality trained staff; (v) lack of knowledge of maintenance \ntechniques; (vi) unavailability of appropriate software, which is essential to improve productivity \nand efficiency and to overcome the issue of scarce resources; (vii) the problem of overloaded \nvehicles, which has caused very serious damage to roads and has sharply increased the need for \nroad maintenance.  \n \nD.  Asset Management and Road Maintenance Program of the Project \n5.  To overcome the current obstacles of road maintenance, attract staff to work in the area, \nand ensure project sustainability, GCD will operate the project expressway and local roads using \na cost-effective asset management strategy.   \n \n6.  The Project will procure equipment and strengthen local capacity ($7.5 million) as follows: \n \n(i)  Equipment (a) Asphalt mixture equipment, pavement maintenance equipment, \nand  multipurpose  trucks;  (b)  pavement  management  system,  including  data \ncollection devices, geographical information system and software; (c) overloaded \nvehicle inspection systems; and (d) emergency and safety equipment. \n \n(ii)  Capacity  building  and  training  (a)  Strengthen  the  capacity  of  Guangxi \nCommunications College (GCC) through training and office equipment, software, \nand educational materials; (b) establish an ongoing GCC training program to \nenhance staff skills; and (c) provide 6 person-months of overseas training to \nstrengthen staff capacity and adopt best practice. \n \n(iii)  International consultants. Provide 3 person-months of short-term international \nconsultants to enhance local capacity.  \n \n(iv)  Team leader. With the help of the team leader/international consultant, develop a \nsustainable  maintenance  system,  including  budget  plan,  staff  development \nprogram, monitoring system to efficiently manage assets and provide steady \noperation of the expressway and local roads, following project completion. \n \n(v)  Administration and staffing. Following project opening, GCD, GHAB, and the \nLCB  will  implement  the  asset  management  and  maintenance  strategy  in \naccordance with GCD policies and regulations; and will ensure the availability of \nappropriate staff. \n \n(vi)  Budget. Under the leadership of GCD, an ongoing maintenance budget will be \nprovided to ensure steady operation of the expressway and local roads after \nproject opening. The government maintenance fees will support maintenance of \nthe local roads and the toll revenue will support maintenance of the expressway.  \n \n(vii)  Corporatization. GCD, in consultation with the ADB, will create a regime, to \nensure  implementation  of  the  asset  management  and  maintenance  strategy \nfollowing the establishment of the project company. ", " 34 Appendix 5 \nTRANSPORT SERVICES ACTION PLAN \n \nA.  General \n \n1.  There is a wide range of transport services within the project area for three main modes: \nroad, rail, and inland waterway. Each mode plays a different role, with only limited competition \nbetween them. Inland waterways are suitable for low-value bulk commodities, the transport of \nwhich is not time sensitive, e.g., building materials, and bulk fuels. While passenger services \nhave  been  operated,  the  slow  transit  times  mean  that  usage  is  low  and  declining.  \nRail services are most suitable for the movement of bulk commodities between a limited number \nof destinations. The railway also carries substantial numbers of passengers to a limited number \nof destinations and at low frequencies. Rail flows are estimated at 1.3\u20131.5 million passengers \nper year and 4\u20135 million tons of freight, both well within the capacity of the system. Roads carry \nabout 12 million passengers per year and about 8\u201310 million tons of freight. Formal and informal \nbus and other services provide a wide range of passenger services. Roads also cater to the \nrapidly increasing numbers of private vehicle trips, reflecting the substantial growth in vehicle \nownership in the area and in the country as a whole. Typically, private vehicles represent \ncomplex and dispersed trip patterns, for which rail and inland waterways would not be suitable. \nTraffic and social surveys of the project TA have revealed that improvement of roads and \ntransport services is the second need of the rural population, after food or income increase. \n \n2.  A similar situation is true of freight, where bulk cargoes are largely carried by rail and, to \na lesser extent, by inland waterways; and general cargoes are increasingly carried by road. \nRoad transport offers faster transit times, door-to-door services, greater security, and the ability \nto provide direct transit without the need for intermediate intermodal transshipment. As a result, \nroad transport is more able to cater to high-value, time-sensitive, and dispersed movements of \nfreight, a category of traffic that is growing rapidly with economic development and the People's \nRepublic  of  China's  (PRC\u2019s)  transition  to  a  market  economy.  The  patterns  of  traffic  are \nsummarized in Table A5.1. \n \nTable A5.1: Current Traffic Patterns Within the G324 Corridor (2003) \n(excluding short-distance tripsa) \n \n  Passenger Traffic   \n  (Buses and Cars)  Freight Traffic in \n  in the Project  the Project Corridor \n  Corridor  (vehicle/day) \nItem  (vehicle/day) \nTotal Movements   4700  6625 \nWithin 5 Key Counties of Expressway  1,450  31%  1,500  23% \nCorridor \nWithin the PA  2,010  43%  2,250  34% \n  Total Local Trips  3,460  74%  3,750  57% \n         \nTrips between Nanning and Guangxi  740  16%  990  15% \nTrips between Yunnan, Guizhou, and   500  11%  1885  29% \n  Guangdong provinces \nGuangxi = Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, km = kilometer, PA = project area.  \na  Short distance = less than 10 km. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n3.  The development of the project roads will allow formal and informal public transport \nservices to access a higher proportion of the main activity centers and rural areas where many \n ", "Appendix 5   35\nof the poor live, and will encourage development of better linkages with employment and other \nopportunities. The project area also contains a range of important tourist facilities and their \ncontinued  development  depends  on  improving  accessibility  that  will  be  possible  with \nexpressway and local roads development. \n \nB.  Transport Services Program of the Project \n \n4.  Construction of the expressway and the local roads will provide opportunities for better \ntransport services in the project area, through improved competition and transport cost savings.    \nThe opportunities for public transport are likely to include the following: \n \n  (i)  use of the expressway for long-distance public transport services traveling the full \nlength of the route between Nanning and Baise, or to shorten the distance for \npublic transport services connecting to the major centers along the route; \n \n  (ii)  use  of  the  G324  for  enhanced  local  public  transport  services  following  the \ndiversion of traffic to the expressway; and  \n \n  (iii)  use  of  the  upgraded  local  roads  to  provide  enhanced  local  public  transport \nservices between the main centers to villages at more remote locations. \n \n5.  Much of the public transport industry in the area is in the hands of private sector \noperators, who operate services without a subsidy. To ensure that the best use is made of the \nopportunities that become available, the following approaches are proposed, to encourage and \nfacilitate the provision of public transport and freight services. \n \n(i)  Identify clearly the benefits for public transport and freight operations likely to \narise from the construction of the expressway and the local roads program, and \npresent these to representatives of the local communities, stakeholders, and to \npotential operators of both formal and informal transport services. \n \n(ii)  Based on the discussions, invite operators and other interested parties to define \nwhat  new  services  may  be  operated,  and  what  additional  infrastructure  and \nfacilities need to be provided or facilitated by the public sector. These may, for \nexample, include the expansion of existing terminal facilities in the major centers, \nand provision of simple terminals in towns and villages getting new services. \n \n(iii)  Assess the potential role of roadside stations to ensure that the design of such \nfacilities can accommodate the need of the local community and stakeholders. \n \n(iv)  Before the expressway and local roads are opened, review the potential service \nprovision with operators. \n \n(v)  Ensure that there is public awareness of the opportunities offered by these new \nservices and, in conjunction with the operators, mount a publicity campaign. \n \n6.  A transport services action plan covering areas to be served by the expressway and \nlocal roads is in Table A5.2. The objective of the plan is to maximize the project benefits and \nprovide better service to the local community. \n \n ", " 36 Appendix 5 \nTable A5.2: Transport Services Action Plan \n \nTransport \nActivity  Description  Responsibility  Timing \nOperators Involved \nLocal shuttle  Over 150 shuttle buses, newly  Municipal and  Commercial transport  2007 \nbuses on the  operated or shifted from the  county transport  service companies  onward \nexpressway  current G324 road, will operate  bureaus  and private sector \n  on the project roads, to connect \n  all county centers with main \n  cities and other provinces. \n \nRoadside  Four service areas and four  Guangxi  Local counties  2005\u2013\nstations  parking areas will be  Communications  2007 \n  constructed on the project  Department \n  expressway.

Introduction \n1.  Implementation of the Government's economic reform policies has resulted in rapid \ngrowth of the economy, and a corresponding increase in the demand for transport services. \nConsequently, the number of vehicles has sharply increased, and will continue to grow rapidly in \nthe years to come. An inevitable problem is the incidence and severity of road accidents. If the \npresent trend of one death every 5 minutes due to road accidents is not arrested in the People's \nRepublic of China (PRC), the number of deaths will rise to over 200,000 per annum by 2010, \nthe number of injuries will double to more than a million, and the costs will exceed $12.5 billion \nper  annum,  creating  a  huge  burden  on  the  socioeconomic  development  programs  of  the \nGovernment and community. Many problems encountered with road safety are predominantly \ninstitutional in nature\u2014fragmentation of responsibility, lack of interdepartmental coordination, \nand  inadequate  strategy.  To  help  improve  road  safety,  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA) \napproved in 19991 helped a national program to tackle safety problems. The  Government \nintroduced a new road safety law in May 2004. Road safety is a major concern in Guangxi \nZhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi) and in the project area. The problem will get worse as \ncongestion increases (Supplementary Appendix C). \n \nB.  Need for an Integrated Approach \n2.  The two key agencies concerned with road safety and enforcement on the existing \nexpressways in Guangxi are the Traffic Police Expressway Branch of the Traffic Police of \nGuangxi  Public  Security  Bureau  (GPSB),  the  lead  agency,  and  Guangxi  Communications \nDepartment (GCD). However, promoting road safety is essentially a multidimensional activity, \nand there is a need to consider the role of other agencies. The following integrated approach \nwill be adopted in the project area. The objective is to minimize the incidence and severity of \nroad accidents and maximize the benefits to the community. \n \nTable A6: Road Safety and Traffic Enforcement Action Plan for the Project \n \nItem  Agency  Pre-Accident  Accident  Post-Accident \nInstitution   Guangxi Public  \u2022 Strengthen role of Guangxi Zhuang  Investigate  \u2022 Monitor trends. \nSecurity Bureau  Autonomous Region (Guangxi)  major accident  \u2022 Provide guidance \n(GPSB), and  interagency road safety committee.  causes.  and standards. \nGuangxi  \u2022 Develop strategy / policy, monitoring    \u2022 Assess causes and \nCommunications  system, and ensure skills and resources    provide prevention \nDepartment  availability, with the help of the  measures. \n(GCD)  international consultants.  \u2022 Foster knowledge. \n  \u2022 Involve relevant stakeholders.  \u2022 Asses effectiveness \n\u2022 Fulfill requirements of the 2004 road safety  against targets. \nlaw, and United Nations (UN) standards. \n    \u2022 Illustrate the magnitude of the safety     \nproblem to ensure a high level of interest. \nEngineering  GCD  \u2022 Promote safety-conscious design of roads,  Set up  \u2022 Provide rescue \nCounties  including road safety audit and black spot  protective  facilities. \nGPSB  and maintenance plans.  roadside  \u2022 Alleviate \n  \u2022 Provide sign, signal, marks, safety  object.  congestion. \ndevices, and design speed.     \n\u2022 Maintain traffic surveillance center,   \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1999.

Road traffic in the Nanning (Tanluo)-Baise corridor has been growing rapidly in recent \nyears, reflecting in part the rapid economic growth within the area and in part the growth in longer \ndistance interprovincial and intercountry traffic through the area from Guangdong, Yunnan and \nother provinces. Initial traffic forecasts for the expressway, based on surveys in 2000, were \nreviewed during the project TA and suggestions were made to refine the modelling. As a result, \nadditional surveys were undertaken in November 2003, and revised forecasts were produced for \nthe period up to 2026, (Figure A11.1). \n \n \nFigure A11.1: Observed and Forecast Traffic in the Corridor (PCU) \n \n 40,000 \n35,000 \n30,000 \n25,000 \n20,000 \n15,000 \n10,000 \n5,000 \n0\n1980 1990 2000 2010 2020  2030\n1970 \nObserved Flows  Forecast Flows\n \nPCU = passenger car unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n2.  Traffic on the project expressway was forecast to be 10,724 passenger car unit (PCU) in \n2007 and 47,056 PCU Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) in 2026 (Table A11). According to the \nstandards for expressways (25,000\u201355,000 PCU AADT) of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nthe 4-lane expressway will meet the requirements of that traffic level. This project expressway will \nhave sufficient and sustainable traffic suitable for the expressway engineering design and toll \nrevenue generation. \n \n3.  The flows in the corridor have also been compared with the forecast economic growth \n(Figure A11.2). The forecast traffic flows in the corridor as a whole are below the rate of economic \ngrowth, but both display a generally similar pattern over time, except for the initial period when the \nconstruction  of  the  expressway  leads  to  high  initial  growth  over  the  period  to  2010.  \nThe growth of expressway traffic is generally higher than that for the corridor as a whole, because \nof the shortage of capacity on the G324.

", "46   Appendix 12 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n1.  The Project comprises the expressway from Nanning (Tanluo) to Baise and the local \nroad connected to the expressway through the road network system. The main civil works of the \nexpressway will be executed in 3 years and the economic analysis covers that period and the \nfollowing 21 years of operation. The expressway\u2019s economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was \nestimated by comparing the situations with and without the new road. Without the Project, the \nexisting road network will become congested because of rapidly increasing traffic and some \ntrips will be suppressed. The Project will reduce congestion; offer faster, cheaper, and safer \ntravel; and allow additional trip making. The analysis has been undertaken for each component \nof the Project and for the whole Project, using 2003/04 prices. \n \nA.  Expressway Component \n \n2.  Cost.  For  the  economic  evaluation,  the  expressway  component  includes  the \nconstruction of the expressway itself and construction of the connecting roads. The costs of the \nexpressway include (i) capital costs: physical contingencies, costs of land acquisition, costs of \nenvironmental mitigating measures, and compensation or relocation of affected people; and  \n(ii) costs of operating and maintaining the expressway. \n \n3.  Benefit. The economic benefits include (i) savings in vehicle operating costs (VOCs) \nresulting from shorter travel time and improved traffic conditions, (ii) savings in the value of \npassenger time, (iii) savings resulting from fewer accidents, and (iv) benefits to generated traffic. \nIn addition there will be environmental benefits from reduced vehicle emissions and noise, and \nindirect  economic  benefits  resulting  from  increased  in  economic  growth  in  the  corridor \ngenerated by the new road. However, these indirect benefits were not been included in the \nanalysis for lack of a suitable evaluation methodology. The main source of economic benefits is \nthe  reduced  VOCs.  The  new  road  shortens  the  route  between  Nanning  and  Baise  by  \n14 kilometers (kms) and provides better operating conditions. Traffic diverted to the expressway \nwill enjoy higher speeds on a smoother road, with better vertical and horizontal alignment, less \ncongestion, and a shorter through distance; and will gain substantial benefits. All these changes \naffect  VOCs\u2014which  were  estimated  using  the  standard  Highway  Development  and \nManagement  System  (HDM)  VOC  estimation  techniques\u2014and  the  savings  were  then \nincorporated into the economic evaluation. The other main sources of economic benefits are \ntime savings, accident savings and the benefits to generated traffic. The value of time savings \nhas  been  determined  based  on  the  reduction  in  journey  times  and  the  value  of  time  of \npassengers traveling in and through the corridor, taking into account the characteristics of these \ntravelers. Accident cost savings were based in part on an analysis of national and local accident \nstatistics  for  2002.  The  unit  costs  of  accidents  are  based  on  a  review  of  the  severity  of \naccidents, taking into account damage to property and the value of output lost. \n \n4.  Benefits to the additional traffic attracted to the corridor were estimated by calculating \nthe generalized cost savings for traffic using the expressway in each forecast year and then \nattributing 50% of this change in costs to the increases in traffic over the level that would exist if \nthe expressway was not constructed. The evaluation also accounts for the time taken for the full \nlevel of demand on the expressway to be achieved, as travelers adjust their travel behavior to \ntake advantage of the new opportunities that become available. This is reflected in the analysis \nby assuming that only 50% of the full forecast benefits are achieved in the first year (2008) of \noperation and 85% in the second (2009). \n \n ", "Appendix 12  47\n5.  The EIRR for the expressway component is estimated at 17.1%, indicating that the \nproject is economically viable, with a net present value of CNY2.5 billion. Of the total benefits, \n59% are savings in VOC; 21%, savings in passenger time costs; 2%, accident cost savings; and \n17%, benefits from generated traffic. Sensitivity analyses confirm the robustness of the Project\u2019s \neconomic viability. \n \nB.  Local Roads \n \n6.  To extend the potential benefits of the expressway to a wider area, upgrading of a range \nof intercounty roads was investigated. Following this review, one route of 250 km linking Baise \nand Napo to the Viet Nam border was selected for inclusion in the overall project. This route \nwould extend the potential catchment area of the expressway and would bring the benefits of \nthe higher levels of economic activity in the expressway corridor to a wider section of the \npopulation especially those living in poor isolated areas between the corridor and the Vietnam \nborder. The project would also enhance the accessibility of the border areas and help stimulate \ncross-border trade with Vietnam currently about $500 million per year between Guangxi and \nVietnam and growing strongly. The cost of this road is estimated at about CNY220 million in \n2003/04 prices. This part of the Project will upgrade an existing unsealed road and will directly \nserve a poor and isolated community. Quantified benefits include the changes in VOCs and \ntravel times with the new road, accident savings, and benefits to generated traffic. This analysis \ngave an EIRR of about 17%, with a net present value of about CNY90 million. However it is \nlikely that substantial benefits are offered by the enhanced mobility and opportunities for cross \nBorder activity, but are not captured in the quantified analysis. \n \n7.  The  final  component  of  the  local  roads  is  the  provision  of  500  km  of  all-weather \nmotorable roads to poor minority villages currently without vehicular access. The costs of this \nroad upgrading are estimated at about CNY75 million. The results of the social and poverty \nassessment surveys indicated substantial differences in income between villages served only by \nearth paths and those with graveled road access. The evaluation was therefore based on the \ndifference in incomes after making allowance for the additional costs of the inputs required to \nachieve them. The EIRR for these roads is estimated at between 32% and 95%, depending on \nwhether the evaluation is based on the increase in net agricultural incomes or in net total \nincomes.  Central  values  have  been  used  in  the  overall  appraisal,  but  even  on  the  lower \nestimates, the benefits are very large. \n \nC.  The Project as a Whole \n \n8.  Based on the combined economic cash flows from 2005 to 2028, the Project as a \nwhole\u2014the 188 km expressway, 250 km of intercounty road upgrading, and 500 km of minority \nvillage roads\u2014will generate an EIRR of 17.8% (Supplementary Appendix I). The benefits of the \nlocal roads component, while critically important to the areas served, are minor, reflecting the \nmodest share of investment in them (Table A12.1). \n \n9.  The sensitivity analysis of the results for the expressway confirms the robustness of its \neconomic  viability.  Changes  in  the  key  variables  have  no  significant  effect  (Table  A12.2).  \nThe capital cost would have to be more than 65% higher than estimated for the EIRR to fall \nbelow the cutoff rate of 12%. Considering the experience of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nin People's Republic of China (PRC), such an increase in capital cost is unlikely. ADB-financed \nroad projects in the PRC have not encountered major cost overruns, and the contract prices \ntend to be lower than estimated because contracting is becoming increasingly competitive. The \neconomic viability of the project and its components can therefore be regarded as very robust. \n ", "48   Appendix 12 \nTable A12.1: Economic Evaluation of the Expressway and Local Roads \n      Local Roads  \nExpressway Costs and Benefits \nExpressway \nThrough  Generated  Net Benefits \nCapital and  VOC  Accident  Total  Net  Overall Net \nYear  VOT  Traffic    for Local \nOperating  Benefits  Savings  Benefitsa  Benefits  Benefits \nBenefits  Benefits  Roadsb \nCosts  \n2005  1,371  0  0  0  0  0  (1,371)    (297)  (1,668) \n2006  2,032  0  0  0  0  0  (2,032)    54  (1,978) \n2007  1,676  0  0  0  0  0  (1,676)    79  (1,598) \n2008  28  464  142  39  16  330  302    96  398 \n2009  28  510  161  51  18  630  601    106  707 \n2010  28  562  183  69  20  833  804    109  913 \n2011  28  592  197  86  21  896  867    112  979 \n2012  28  623  213  107  23  966  937    114  1,051 \n2013  28  657  230  134  24  1,044  1,016    117  1,133 \n2014  28  692  248  168  26  1,133  1,104    120  1,224 \n2015  29  730  267  210  27  1,234  1,204    123  1,327 \n2016  131  774  289  243  29  1,335  1,202    126  1,328 \n2017  29  821  312  283  31  1,447  1,417    129  1,546 \n2018  29  871  337  328  33  1,570  1,540    133  1,673 \n2019  29  925  364  381  36  1,706  1,676    137  1,812 \n2020  29  982  394  442  38  1,856  1,826    141  1,966 \n2021  29  1041  424  494  41  2,000  1,971    145  2,115 \n2022  187  1105  458  552  44  2,159  1,969    148  2,117 \n2023  29  1174  493  617  47  2,332  2,302    152  2,453 \n2024  29  1249  532  690  50  2,521  2,491    155  2,647 \n2025  30  1331  573  771  54  2,729  2,698    159  2,858 \n2026  30  1419  618  862  58  2,957  2,926      2,926 \n2027  30  1508  662  953  62  3,185  3,154      3,154 \n2028  (2,763)  1596  707  1044  66  3,412  6,212      6,212 \nNPV at  4,055   4270  1,557  1,258  181  6,551  2,496     449   2,945  \n12% \n                  EIRR 17.8% \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, VOC = vehicle operating cost, VOT = value of time. \na  The total benefits of 2008 and 2009 are based on para. 4.

General \n \n1.  The financial projections for the Project were prepared for a 24-year period from 2005 to \n2028  in  current  terms.  Construction  will  be completed  in  2007.  Domestic  price  inflation  is \nforecast to be 1% in 2004, 2% in 2005, 3% in 2006, 4% for 2007, 3.5% in 2008, and 3% from \n2008 onward. International inflation is estimated at 1% in 2004, 1.53% in 2005, 0.89% in 2006 \nand 2007, 1% in 2008, and 1.5% from 2008 onward. The initial foreign exchange rate for 2004 \nis CNY8.28 per $1.

The financial projections include revenues from operating (toll) revenues and other non-\noperating  revenues  primarily  from  advertising  and  rental  income  from  operators  of  fueling \nstations and other services available in the service areas along the expressway. Based on past \nexperiences of existing expressways in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi), the \nnet  revenues  from  these  other  activities  are  estimated  at  1  percent  of  total  toll  revenues \ncollected. \n \n3.  Operating revenues from tolls are projected based on forecast traffic and a base toll rate \nof CNY0.35 per passenger car per kilometer (km). Corresponding tolls for other vehicle types \nare CNY0.35 for a small truck, CNY0.81 for a bus, CNY0.81 for a medium truck, CNY1.97 for a \nlarge truck, and CNY1.97 for a trailer and container truck. The assumed toll rate is forecast to \nincrease every 5 years in normal terms from the opening of the expressway to keep up with the \ninflation rate (16% over 5 years, or an average of 3% per year). The proportion of exempted \nvehicles such as police, ambulance, and security and inspection cars is estimated at 6% of \npassenger cars. \n \n4.  The traffic volume is sensitive to the toll level. The diversion of traffic according to a \nchange  of  toll  rates  is  estimated  based  on  the  Toll  Diversion  Model  Application  Manual \n(September 2000) developed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and reflected in the traffic \nforecast for the Project.  \n \n5.  During the 1\u20132 years of opening a new expressway, not all forecast traffic will appear on \nthe expressway. To reflect this, a \u201cramp-up\u201d factor of 50% of forecast traffic is estimated for the \nfirst year of operation (2008) and 85% in the second year (2009). \n \n6.  Two types of taxes are considered in the financial evaluation: business taxes of 5.5% on \ngross revenue, and corporate income tax at 33% of net profit. Corporate income tax is fully \nexempted during the first 2 years of operation, but will gradually be increased to 15% of net \nprofit during year 3 to year 5. From year 6, a standard 33% will be applied to the corporation. \n \n7.  The Project will borrow from two institutions: China Development Bank (CDB) and ADB. \nThe interest rates of CDB and ADB are assumed at 5.76% and 5.48% per annum, respectively. \nThe loan term of CDB is taken as a combination of a 4-year grace period and a 20-year of \nrepayment period. For the ADB loan, maturity is assumed as 24 years, for US dollar LIBOR-\nbased loans, including a 4-year grace period. An equity investment of CNY1.222 billion from the ", " 50 Appendix 13 \nMinistry of Communications (MOC) has been firmed up. MOC and GCD equity investment \nunder this Project will account for 35% of the total project cost. \n \n8.  Expressway operating costs include operation costsand administration costs. Operation \ncosts are assumed to increase as traffic grows. Initially, a staff of 240 will be hired for 12 \ntollbooths at an estimated annual salary of CNY10,000. Administration costs are assumed to be \nconstant at CNY85,000 per km per year throughout the evaluation period. These administration \ncosts include two components: (i) office staff and running expenses (CNY75,000 per km); and \n(ii) landscaping, building maintenance, and periodic traffic count surveys (CNY10,000 per km). \n \n9.  Expressway maintenance may be: routine, medium, or major. Routine maintenance has \nbeen estimated at CNY65,000 per km per year. Medium maintenance is required every 5 years \nat CNY550,000 per km, and major maintenance is required every 10 years at CNY2.18 million \nper km. \n \n10.  Operation and maintenance (O&M) costs for intercounty and minority village roads have \nbeen estimated at CNY10,000 and CNY6,000 per km per year, respectively. \n \n11.  Assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis while the average economic life varies \nfrom 10 to 40 years.  \n \n12.  The pro forma financial statements (Appendix 14) show that although the expressway \nwill generate enough revenue over the loan period, the first 2 years (2008\u20132009) will produce \ndeficits. However, the Project will generate sufficient cash flow during the 2 years. The main \nconclusions are summarized as follows: (i) the project revenues are expected to cover O&M \ncosts, debt servicing, and depreciation in excess of debt servicing, and generate an acceptable \nrate of return on the investment as adjusted for inflation during the project period; (ii) the \nworking ratio will remain below 15% from the first year of full operation; and (iii) the annual \naverage debt service coverage ratio will be equal to more than 1.2 from the third year of full \noperation.  \n \nC.  Financial Analysis \n \n13.  Major assumptions used for calculating the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) are as \nfollows: (i) all calculations are in 2004 constant prices, covering the period from 2005\u20132028;  \n(ii) capital costs consist of all capital expenditures related to the construction and equipment \nassociated with the Project, but excludes price contingencies and financial charges during \nconstruction; (iii) operating revenues from toll used in financial projections are adjusted to 2004 \nreal terms; (iv) incremental O&M costs are also adjusted to 2004 real terms; (v) residual value of \nthe assets is computed based on the average economic asset life for different items. \n \n14.  The  level  of  the  proposed  toll  rates  shown  in  the  base  case  of  the  financial  and \neconomic evaluations gives financial and economic results that are well within the range of \nacceptability. We have tested a range of toll rates and the impact on the FIRR and the economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) and plotted these relationships on a graph (Figure A13). The graph \nshows that at 100% of the base toll rate, the after-tax FIRR is just bout 7% and the EIRR is \napproximately 17%. At higher toll rates, the EIRR declines to 12% at between 1.5 and 1.6 \nmultiplier level of the base toll. The FIRR increases slightly at the toll multiplier level of 1.25, and \nthen declines at higher multipliers. At lower toll rates, the FIRR declines and approaches the \nweighted average cost of capital (WACC) at about the toll multiplier of 0.5. We consider that the ", "Appendix 13  51\nbase toll rate incorporated in the analysis results in adequate financial and economic results. If it \nis changed significantly, the values of these evaluations deteriorate. \n \nFigure A13: Comparison of EIRR and FIRR\n25%\n20%\n%)\nn ( 15%\nr\nu\net\nR\nof  10%\ne \nat\nR 5%\n0%\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\nToll Rate (Proportion of Base Toll Assumption)\nEIRR FIRR Social Discount Rate WACC\n \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, WACC = weighted \naverage cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Develoment Bank estimates. \n \n15.  The estimated WACC, after-tax, in real terms was derived using estimated capital mix \nand costs of funds. The estimated interest costs of the loan funds were considered, while the \ncost of equity was assumed to be 8%. Income tax was assumed at 33%. Weighted average \ninternational and domestic inflation were 1.3% and 2.98% per annum respectively. \n \n16.  The  FIRR  for  the  Project,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  is  7%.  This  compares \nfavorably with the WACC of 2.7%, also computed at after-tax basis (Table A13.1). The Project is \nconsidered both financially viable and sustainable (Supplementary Appendix G). \n \nD.  Sensitivity and Switching Values Analysis \n \n17.  For the financial sensitivity risk analysis, the six most uncertain factors that may affect \nthe financial evaluation are (i) traffic growth, (ii) toll charges, (iii) total working costs, (iv) total \ncapital investment, (v) delay in opening the expressway, and (vi) devaluation of the yuan. \nSensitivity and switching values analysis indicates that the FIRR for the project overall is robust \nunder adverse conditions. The sensitivity of the Project to assumed variations is summarized in \nTable A13.2.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes   Yes \npriority in country poverty partnership \npriority in country poverty analysis?        No    No \nagreement?   \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC):  \n \nThrough improved access to external markets, and social services for the poor, lower transport costs of agricultural \ninputs and products, better interaction with other regions, and increased employment opportunities during and after \nproject implementation due to increased economic activities (e.g., aluminum plant development). The Project\u2019s local \nroad component, specifically where the isolated poorest reside, will help local people break the transport bottleneck \nand therefore add economic values to their fruits, vegetables, and livestock; and facilitate the provision of social and \nphysical infrastructure services (e.g., health), which are introduced by various poverty reduction programs.  Both the \nexpressway and local roads will speed up local development, and roadside stations will help facilitate the formation of \nnew growth centers that will have greater impacts on poverty reduction. Increased revenue from economic activities \npromoted by the project roads will enable the Government to spend more on social services. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Poverty Classification: Other \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nOf the 17 project counties, 16 are either national or provincial poor counties in the project area (PA). The causes of \npoverty in the PA are lack of access to outside markets and unemployment due to remoteness and isolation. \nInsufficient  infrastructure  (e.g.,  roads)  and  an  unfavorable  environment  (e.g.,  being  drought  prone  in  stony \nmountainous areas) worsen the poverty situation. Rural poverty in the PA, measured as per capita income below \nCNY900, affects 2.3 million people (46% of the rural population). Absolute poverty (<CNY625) affects a population of \n0.57 million (12%). Food security has generally been achieved due to favorable climatic conditions and technical and \ninfrastructure progress in agriculture. Some mountain communities, however, might suffer from food shortage once in \nseveral years in case of natural disaster. The urban poor (<CNY130/capita/month) is about 60,000 (9.5%) of the total \nurban population. About 823,000 rural and urban poor\u2014accounting for 34% of the total beneficiaries\u2014will directly \nbenefit from the Project. About 39% of the beneficiaries in the PA are the rural poor. The Project itself will directly \ngenerate economic opportunities for the poor through improved access to urban markets and to other social services, \nreduced transport costs, and better access to and interaction with other regions, including labor migration. Directly and \nindirectly, through the promotion of agricultural commercialization and of local level urbanization, the Project will help \namplify the effects of ongoing poverty reduction efforts. In addition, the Project will promote the development of local \ntourism  in  remote  and  isolated  areas.  With  the  employment  opportunities  created,  increased  agricultural  and \nnonagricultural activities, and rise in labor migration, the poor\u2019s annual income per capita is estimated to increase 11% \nannually for 2004\u20132014. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No \n \n \nIn stakeholder analysis conducted before and during project preparation, the roles of each stakeholder group are well \ndefined. Guangxi Communications Department (GCD) is the Executing Agency, and is responsible for fund-raising \nand overall supervision; the Guangxi-Baise Expressway Construction Office (NBECO) will be the Implementing \nAgency (IA) responsible for implementing construction activities, and the Guangxi Expressway Administration Bureau \n(GEAB)  will  take  over  the  follow-up  management  role.  Local  governments,  local  communities,  and  relevant \nstakeholders will assist NBECO to acquire land, implement the resettlement plan (RP), including the minority village \nroads resettlement framework, implement the ethnic minorities development plan (EMDP), and organize local labor for \nexpressway construction. Leadership organizations consisting of various county-level government agencies have \nbeen set up at each county. The main responsibilities of the organizations will include acting as the problem-and-\nconflict resolution mechanism, such as the grievance system for the affected communities, and facilitator of a \nparticipatory process. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nDuring project preparation, GCD and the project technical assistance consultants undertook socioeconomic and traffic \nsurveys and public meetings among potential beneficiaries (around 4,000 people) to raise the level of awareness and \ngain local support. These processes enabled local stakeholders to express their opinions and to make relevant \nsuggestions on the expressway and local road designs. Specifically, intensive consultations with the rural poor, \nwomen, and minority population were carried out during project preparation and surveys on project impacts. Various \naction plans were developed and distributed locally to facilitate implementation and monitoring, and help stakeholders ", " 56 Appendix 15 \nacquire a sense of ownership. The participatory activities will continue during project implementation, involving the \npoor, women, minority people, and other vulnerable people. In selecting unskilled labor in the PA during construction, \nthe contractors will follow the recommendations of county poverty reduction offices and women\u2019s federations. During \nthe detailed design and construction of the expressway, local leaders from the affected villages and townships will be \nconsulted to minimize the loss of high-quality arable land and structures. For the local roads component, villagers will \nprovide unskilled labor at local market rates. Service contractors at the roadside station will be required to employ the \nlocal poor and to offer places for local products and service outlets. The RP and EMDP have been prepared and will \nbe implemented in the PA.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe labor division in gender exhibits certain differences as those found in many other regions. Men are engaged more \nin outside activities, as migrant labor and in heavy physical activities, while women are more responsible for \nhousehold chores and cropping activities. Young women account for 40% of total labor migrants from the PA. \nWomen\u2019s role in decision making in the household and community affairs varies from place to place and is constantly \nimproving, although it is still limited. Out of 212 women consulted, about 74%, 17%, and 6% were satisfied, \nunsatisfied, and unclear about their current status, respectively. Those that were unsatisfied felt that they are ignored \nby the women\u2019s federations. \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \n \nThe Project will not adversely affect women, but will improve their social and economic roles in general. Women, \nespecially those from ethnic minority groups, are expected to benefit more than men. The road improvements will help \nfacilitate the implementation of government programs, and will create better access to information, goods, services, \nand jobs. Women will receive more benefits from providing catering and other services to workers (over 30,000 \npermanently over 3 years) during the expressway construction period. Operation of the expressway will provide over \n500 jobs (50\u201360% of total jobs to be offered to rural people) for young women in the PA. Priority for project benefits \nwill be given to poor women, under the guidance of women\u2019s federations. \n \nE.

The Guangxi Roads Development II Project will finance the construction of an expressway \nproject between Nanning City and Baise City, comprising a 188 kilometer (km) expressway,    \n25 km of connector roads, 250 km of intercounty roads, and 500 km of minority village roads. \nUpgrading  of  minority  village  roads  is  not  expected  to  require  much  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement, if any. The government of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi) has \nassured the Asian Development Bank (ADB) that if additional farmland is required for the \ncomplementary roads, the affected people will receive compensation and other assistance as \nstipulated in the resettlement plan (RP) or the resettlement framework (RF) for minority village \nroads. The Guangxi Communications Department (GCD) is the project Executing Agency and the \nNanning-Baise Expressway Construction Office (NBECO) will be the Implementing Agency.   \nThe  Nanning  and  Baise  city  governments  will  implement  the  resettlement  activities  with \nsupervision by NBECO. The RP and RF for village roads were approved by GCD on behalf of the \nGuangxi government in June 2004. \n \n2.  The  proposed  expressway  and  its  connecting  roads  will  affect  18  townships,            \n70 administrative villages, and 505 village groups. About 1,434 hectares (ha) of land will be \nacquired, 83% of which will be farmland; 11%, forestland; and 6%, wasteland. Land acquisition \nwill directly affect the equivalent of 2,987 households (13,141 people). Another 313 ha will be \noccupied temporarily during the construction phase. A total of 41,021 square meters (m2) of \nhouses will be demolished, necessitating relocation of 360 houses in which 1,584 people live. \nAbout 19.9% of the affected houses are brick-concrete structures and 77.3% are brick-timber \nstructures. The 250 km intercounty road is located in Youjiang District, Jingxi County, and Napo \nCounty of Baise City. It will require the acquisition of 118 ha, of which 25% is farmland, and will \naffect the equivalent of 498 people. Also, 67 houses with 296 people will need to be relocated. \nThe Project also includes 500 km of minority village roads, which are located in poverty counties \nalong the expressway alignment. Since this program involves improvement of existing roads, very \nlittle land acquisition and resettlement as anticipated and impacts will not be significant. An RF \nhas been prepared in the case of resettlement impacts. \n \n3.  For people who are unavoidably affected, the resettlement objective is to achieve equal, \nor better, income and living standards in line with the People's Republic of China (PRC) Land Law \n(1998) and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and Policy on Indigenous Peoples. GCD \nwill ensure that any people losing land, housing, other assets, or income source will be helped to \nfully  restore  their  income  and  living  standards.  The  RP  stipulates  entitlements  for  land \ncompensation,  resettlement  subsidies,  crop  compensation,  house  compensation,  and \nresettlement  measures.  Given  the  poverty  condition  in  the  region  and  the  compensation \nstandards  used  for  other  expressway  projects,  GCD  has  proposed  higher  standards  for \ncompensation.1 Those who lose their houses will be given free new housing with roads, electricity, \nand water. Housing compensation will not be reduced for depreciation, and people will be allowed \nto salvage materials from their old houses. Relocation will provide an opportunity to improve \ncurrent housing conditions. These households will be moved a short distance to another site \nwithin their original village. Other affected assets include telecommunications and electrical \ninfrastructure, tombs, and trees. All land, housing, and other assets will be compensated at \nreplacement value. The RP has provisions for moving allowances to help affected people during \nthe transitional period. GCD will request expressway contractors to give priority to resettlement- \naffected households in the allocation of unskilled jobs during construction. Resettlement effects \n                                                      \n1  Assuming more than 0.053 ha per capita. If the average landholding is less, the resettlement subsidy will be \nincreased proportionately. ", " 58  Appendix 16 \nwere minimized by consulting with local officials and affected people during selection of the \nalignment in the initial feasibility study. Most affected people will remain in their native rural areas \nand will be provided with replacement land and cash compensation based on the feedback from \nmore than two thirds of villagers surveyed in each village group. If the compensation for land \nacquisition is used collectively, village groups will utilize the compensation funds to improve farms, \ndevelop cash crops, and invest in various nonfarm activities. Of 505 affected village groups,     \n10 were identified as seriously affected. The decision to restore and improve the agricultural \neconomy was based on consultation with the affected people. New employment and income \ngenerating opportunities will also arise once the expressway is constructed and the local roads \nimproved. The people generally felt confident that this strategy will lead to better living conditions. \n \n4.  GCD will assume overall responsibility for implementing resettlement. A resettlement \noffice  within  NBECO  will  coordinate  planning,  implementing,  financing,  and  reporting  land \nacquisition and resettlement for the expressway, connector roads, intercounty roads and minority \nvillage roads. Leading groups for resettlement were established at city and county or district levels. \nSince 89% of affected people are Zhuang, ethnic minority officials were selected to handle \nresettlement matters. Ethnic minority committees also will provide another forum where minority \npeople can voice possible grievances. For economically vulnerable people, the Project will \nprovide additional financial and physical support. Vulnerable households will receive (i) physical \nhelp to build their houses, and (ii) special measures to enable them to maintain their living \nstandards. The RP includes a special assistance of 1% of the total resettlement budget to directly \nhelp vulnerable people. The people affected were notified about the key elements of the RP \nduring meetings and interviews. Before implementation, township and village officials will arrange \nfurther consultations to discuss specific impacts in each village group and how they will be \naddressed. People losing their houses will be offered a choice of housing sites, and those losing \nagricultural land will have a choice of suitable income replacement alternatives. All villagers will \nhelp  decide  how  to  utilize  the  collective  compensation  funds.  In  May  2004  copies  of  a \nresettlement information booklet were distributed to all affected townships and villages, and \ndiscussed with households. The information booklet contains the resettlement scope, project \nschedule, compensation rates for land and other assets, other assistance to replace assets, \nrelocation and economic rehabilitation strategies, and grievance redress mechanisms. \n \n5.  In case of any grievance, affected people will submit their oral or written complaint first to \nthe village committee or the township resettlement office. If their complaint is not settled in       \n2 weeks, they can seek redress at the county resettlement office within 1 month. If the grievance \nis still unresolved, NBECO will try to solve the problem. Final redress will be sought, if necessary, \nin the civil courts, in accordance with the Civil Procedures Act. NBECO will engage the services of \nan independent monitoring agency to ascertain that the affected people have (i) received their full \nentitlements on time, and (ii) fully restored their livelihoods standards. NBECO also will establish \na reporting system and report on the progress of land acquisition and resettlement through \nquarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB.  NBECO  and  ADB  will  establish  a  set  of  resettlement \nsupervision milestones. \n \n6.  The RP budget for the proposed expressway and its connecting roads is CNY625 million \n($75.5 million equivalent). For the intercounty road, the cost is CNY14 million ($1.7 million \nequivalent).  GCD  has  guaranteed  to  supplement  the  resettlement  budget,  if  necessary.       \nThe resettlement implementation schedule was prepared, based on the project construction \ntimetable.  Land  acquisition  will  start  in  September  2004  and  be  completed  in  early  2005.    \nHouse relocation will be from July to December 2004 to provide time to develop some new \nagricultural land and readjust farmland in early 2005, and to fully restore livelihoods and living \nconditions by 2006. ", "Appendix 17   59\nSUMMARY ETHNIC MINORITIES DEVELOPMENT PLAN \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  An  ethnic  minorities  development  plan  (EMDP)  was  prepared  to  ensure  equitable \nsharing of project benefits and to propose measures for mitigating adverse effects on minority \ncommunities in the project area (PA). Adequate provisions to enhance economic conditions of \nminority groups have been integrated in the project design. Special mitigating measures have \nbeen included in the resettlement plan to ensure that adversely affected ethnic minorities will \nalso benefit from the Project. Government policies will further help enhance project benefits. \n \nB.  Socioeconomic Characteristics of Ethnic Minorities in the Project Area \n \n2.  The total minority population1 in the PA is estimated at 1.7 million (about 90% of the total \npopulation)\u2014higher than the provincial average of 38%. The Zhuang account for over 87% of \nthe total population in the PA, while the Yao make up about 3%, and the Han 10%. They reside \nmainly in the expressway corridor (74%) and are concentrated in the county towns (69%). About \n300 people, mainly of Hui nationality, live in urban towns and represent the better-off and more \nadvanced  groups.  Sugarcane  and  fruit  production  are  important  cash  income  sources  for \nfarmers in the valley and hilly areas. The poverty situation of the Zhuang and Yao is relevant to \ntheir  geographical  remoteness,  which  limits  access  to  outside  markets  and  to  external \nemployment.  Households  of  Zhuang  (60%)  and  Yao  (90%)  have  an  income  of  less  than \nCNY900. Information and transport are key factors for men and women to advance their social \nability (Appendix 5). \n \nC.  Legal Framework and Project Benefits \n \n3.  The EMDP for the Project is based on the People's Republic of china (PRC) regulations \nand Asian Development Bank (ADB) Policy on Indigenous Peoples. The Government adopted a \npolicy of ethnic equality post-1949 where all groups are legally and constitutionally equal. ADB \npolicy aims to protect ethnic minorities from the adverse impacts and to ensure benefits from \nproject development. The Project fully mainstreams ethnic minorities\u2019 concerns into its design, \nas these people are considered one of the primary beneficiaries. The local roads program was \ndesigned to benefits the isolated minorities and poor. Significant project impacts include tourism \nand roadside stations development, higher farm prices of goods, accessibility, and enhanced \ncommunication  with  urban  centers  (Table  A17).  The  Project  is  not  expected  to  have  any \nadverse impacts on minorities, except for land acquisition. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n4.  Implementation  arrangements  and  the  associated  costs  for  the  EMDP  have  been \nintegrated into the overall project arrangements, or are part of ongoing government programs. \nResettlement  assistance  for  vulnerable  households  is  budgeted  at  1%  of  the  total  basic \nresettlement cost. The overall project system includes monitoring and evaluating the EMDP and \nhiring an independent domestic agency for external monitoring. Ethnic minority beneficiaries will \nparticipate in project implementation. The ADB midterm review will pay special attention to \nethnic minority groups. If necessary, adjustments will be made during the Project to better meet \nethnic minority needs. \n \n                                                 \n1  Ethnic minority groups refer to groups that are different from the majority ethnic group\u2014the Han.
