An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was \nundertaken,  and  the  summary  EIA  circulated  to  the  Board  on \n17 June 2004. \n \nThe  Project  was  developed  in  a  participatory  manner  and \nsustainable  transport  planning  context.  It  involves  building  a  188-\nkilometer (km)-long expressway between Greater Nanning (Tanlou \nCity)  and  Baise  City  in  Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous  Region \n(Guangxi);  constructing  25  km  connecting  roads;  upgrading  250 \nkm intercounty and 500 km minority village roads serving isolated \npoor  counties  and  townships;  providing  consulting  services  and \ntraining;  project  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E);  and  improving \nroad  safety.  The  Project  will  support  the  provision  of  better \ntransport  services,  asset  management  and  road  maintenance \npractice, \nroadside  stations  management,  enforcement  of \nregulations  on  overloaded  vehicles,  preventing  measures  for \nhuman \nimmunodeficiency \nsyndrome  (HIV/AIDS),  and  link  markets  and  centers  of  economic \nactivity. The Project will support the Government\u2019s western region \ndevelopment  strategy  by  building  a  section  of  the  western  region \ncorridor,  and  linking  Guangxi  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China \n(PRC) with the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). \n \nGuangxi, located in the southern part of the country, is bordered by \nYunnan  Province  on  the  west,  Guizhou  on  the  northwest,  Hunan \non  the  northeast,  and  Guangdong  on  the  southeast;  the  Gulf  of \nTonkin  on  the  south;  and  Viet  Nam  on  the  southwest.  Guangxi  is \none of the three least developed areas in the PRC. Average gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  per  capita  is  CNY5,099,  62%  of  the \nnational average. Of the 81 counties in Guangxi, 49 are classified \nas  national  or  provincial  poverty  counties.  Poverty  and  minority \ngroups are concentrated in the western part of Guangxi where the \nproposed  Project \ntransport \ninfrastructure and the high cost of transport are two of the factors \ncontributing  to  the  depressed  economic  conditions.  Current  road \ndensity in the project area is 1.3 km per 1,000 persons. Poverty is  \n\nimmunodeficiency \n\nvirus/acquired \n\nInadequate \n\nlocated. \n\nroad \n\nis \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\f \n\nlink \n\ntotally \n\nremote,  and \n\nwidespread, and all counties, from Greater Nanning to Baise City,  \nare  either  nationally  or  locally  designated  poverty  areas.  The \ncurrent  Greater  Nanning-Baise  City  G324  class  II  road  has  poor \ngeometrical  standards  and  traffic  has  reached  the  optimum \ncapacity.  Traffic  has  grown  at  the  rate  of  around  7%  annually, \ntravel  time  is  about  5  hours,  and  traffic  accidents  are  double  the \nnational  average  for  a  class  II  road.  The  high  incidence  of  traffic \naccidents,  and  the  associated  death  and  injury  place  a  heavy \nburden on the health and welfare systems of the poor counties in \nthe  project  area.  The  local  roads  component  of  the  Project  will \nupgrade  the  lowest  chain  of  the  network  to  serve  some  of  the \npoorest,  most \nisolated  communities. \nThe  Project  will  promote  trade  between  Guangxi,  the  western \nprovinces,  and  Viet  Nam.  Consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country \noperational  strategy,  the  Project  will  support  (i)  construction  of \nroads that connect major growth centers; (ii) integration of the road \nnetwork;  (iii)  improvement  of  road  safety;  (iv)  strengthening \ninstitutions  and  creation  of  a  corporation;  (v)  enhancing  regional \ncooperation; and (vi) activities to involve the private sector. \n \nthe  Baise-Luocunkou/Yunnan  border \nThe  Project  will \nexpressway with the Nanning ring road. Thus it will form a strategic \nlink  between  Yunnan  and  Guizhou  provinces  and  the  ports  of \nFangcheng,  Qinzhou,  and  Beihai.  It  will  provide  the  western \nprovinces  better  access  to  Guangdong  and  Hunan  and  will \nimprove linkage with the 360 km border area with Viet Nam. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  main  objective  is  to  lower  transport  costs,  and \nthereby  enhance  economic  growth  and  contribute  to  reducing \npoverty  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  will  (i)  strengthen \nconnectivity between the national trunk highway system and local \nroads network; (ii) reduce transport prices, and improve travel time \nand  comfort;  (iii)  provide  better  access  to  markets,  services,  jobs, \ngrowth centers, and isolated communities; (iv) improve road safety, \ntransport  services,  roadside  stations  management,  corporate \ngovernance,  and  asset  management  and  maintenance  practice; \n(v)  increase  traffic  between  the  western  provinces  and  the \nseaports  in  Guangxi;  and  (vi)  improve  access  to  the  Viet  Nam \nborder and the GMS. \n \nThe  Project  will  entail  (i)  construction  of  about  188  km  of  a  four-\nlane access-controlled toll expressway, about 25 km of connecting \nroads,  12  interchanges,  12  toll  stations,  3  traffic  control  centers,\n8  roadside  stations,  and  4  asset  management  and  maintenance \ncenters;  (ii)  upgrading  of  about  250  km  of  intercounty  roads  and \n500  km  of  minority  villages  roads;  (iii)  procurement  of  equipment \nfor asset management, maintenance, training, and expressway toll \ncollection,  surveillance,  communications,  safety,  and  vehicle-\nweighing  stations;  (iv)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement;  and\n(v) consulting services and capacity building. \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nObjectives \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nThe  total  project  cost,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies \nand interest during construction, is estimated at $726 million \nequivalent,  of  which  $304.1  million  (42%)  is  in  foreign  exchange \nand $421.9 million (58%) equivalent in local currency. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n             ($ million) \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank  \nChina Development Bank \nMinistry of Communications \nGuangxi Government Grant \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n200.0 \n104.1 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n304.1 \n\n \nLocal \nCurrency \n0.0 \n167.3 \n147.6 \n107.0 \n421.9 \n\nTotal \nCost \n200.0 \n271.4 \n147.6 \n107.0 \n726.0 \n\nPercent \n\n28 \n37 \n20 \n15 \n100 \n\n \n\nlending \n\nTotal \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nA loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 24-year term, including \na  grace  period  of  4  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nfacility,  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \nThe PRC as Borrower will make the ADB loan proceeds available to \nthe  Guangxi  government  and \nthe  Guangxi \nCommunications  Department  (GCD)  for  constructing  the  project \nexpressway  between  Nanning  (Tanluo) and  Baise and  local  roads, \non the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. GCD \nwill  bear  the  interest  rate  variation  and  foreign  exchange  risks. \nthe \nA  corporatized  entity \nexpressway  will  be  established  by  September  2005  to  manage \nADB-financed  projects, \nthe  ongoing  Guangxi  Roads \nDevelopment I Project (Guangxi I), as well as this project (Guangxi \nII). \n \nUntil 31 December 2008 \n \n30 June 2008 \n\nfor  management  of \n\nresponsible \n\nfurther \n\ni.e., \n\nto \n\nCommunications \n\n \nGuangxi Communications Department  \n \nThe  project  implementation  office  will  be  established  within \nGuangxi \nConstruction \nAdministration  Bureau  (GCICAB)  of  GCD  to  be  responsible  for \nroads \nconstruction  of \nimprovement  program  will  be  implemented  under  the  overall \nresponsibility  of  GCD.

Civil  works  for  local  roads  will  be  procured  through \nlocal competitive bidding or force account. The equipment packages \nwill  be  procured  through  ICB,  direct  purchase,  and  international \nshopping.  ADB  approved  advance  action  for  procurement  of  civil \nworks. \n \nAbout 57 person-months of international consulting services will be \nprovided  under  the  Project  (i)  to  assist  project  management  over \nthe entire construction period and provide expertise in (a) road and \nbridge  design  and  construction,  (b)  asset  management  and  road \nsystems,\nmaintenance, \n(d)  environmental  monitoring,  and  (e)  road  safety  and  traffic \nmanagement;  (ii)  help  formulate  a  human  resource  development \nand  training  program;  (iii)  help  develop  and  implement  a  project \nperformance  management  system,  and  assess  project  impact  on \npoverty  reduction;  and  (iv)  help \nfor  corporate \nmanagement. About 50 person-months of international training will \nhelp  develop  the  human  resources  skills  of  GCD  subordinate \nbureaus staff and enhance their capacity in expressway and local \nroad  operation  and  maintenance,  commercialization  and \ncorporatization,  bridge  and  pavement  design  and  construction, \ncomputer  software  development  management,  transport  planning, \nand intelligent transportation systems. About 4,500 person-months \nof  consulting  services  will  be  undertaken  by  domestic  consultant \nteams  experienced  in  similar  road  projects.  A  team  of  domestic \nconsultants (24 person-months) will be recruited to help monitor the \nProject\u2019s  socioeconomic  impact,  particularly  on  poverty  reduction \nand  the  minorities.  The  international  consultants  financed  from  the \nADB  loan  will  be  recruited  under  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection method, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants.  The  domestic  consultants  will  be  financed  by  GCD \nand \nin  accordance  with  government  procedures \nrecruited \nacceptable to ADB. \n \nThe  Project  will  reduce  transport  time  and  costs,  and  thereby \npromote private business, raise incomes, and create jobs. The route \nforms part of the connection between the provinces of Yunnan and \nGuizhou  and \nin \nthe  Guangxi  ports  and  areas \nGuangdong;  Hong  Kong,  China;  and  Macau.  There  is  a  high \nproportion of through traffic on the current G324 road. The economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  for  the  Project  is  estimated  at  17.8%.  The \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  after  taxes  is  7.0%,  which  is  higher \nthan the real weighted average cost of capital of 2.7%. By improving \nlocal roads as well as constructing the expressway, the Project will \nhelp to improve access to market opportunities and social services \nfor the isolated rural poor living in the project area. The Project will \ndirectly and indirectly benefit over 5.6 million people, of whom 88% \nare  ethnic  minorities  and  46%  are  poor.  The  beneficiaries  include \nhouseholds  in  poor  counties  and  townships,  providers  of  transport \n\nfurther  east \n\n \nConsulting Services \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nvii\n\nimprove  access \n\nservices  (261  routes)  and  their  customers,  key  industry  (over \n100,000  employees),  agricultural  businesses,  and  people  living  in \nthe  project  area  who  will  have  better  access  to  long-distance \ntransport.  The  Project  will \nto  93  hospitals, \n907 schools, 5 key county centers, 20 tourism attractions, 95 village \nmarkets, 70 townships, and 745 villages and isolated communities. \nThe number of deaths from road accidents will fall by 90 per annum. \nThe  Project  will  help  enhance  social  services,  and  reduce  vehicle \nemissions and traffic noise. \n \nThe  Project  is  not  expected  to  face  significant  technical  risks. \nDeep-cut  earthworks  will  be  carefully \ninvestigated  before \nconstruction  and  high  embankments  monitored  prior  to  paving  to \navoid implementation problems. The expected continued economic \ngrowth  and  resulting  traffic  increase  limit  the  potential  economic \nrisks. Initial traffic levels were estimated based on actual traffic on \nkey  roads  in  the  project  corridor.  The  foreign  exchange  and \ninterest  rate  risks  to  be  borne  by  GCD  have  been  identified. \nADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  to  create  a  legally  independent  and \nfinancially  autonomous  expressway  company  will  promote  risk \nmanagement  and  mitigation  by  GCD.  The  project  covenants  will \nencourage GCD to adopt best practice and better manage market-\nbased  financial  costs.  The  poverty  reduction  impact  will  be \nmonitored  to  ensure  that  anticipated  benefits  accrue  to  the  poor. \nThe  incidence  of  HIV/AIDS  in  the  region  is  reported  to  be  one  of \nthe  highest  in  the  PRC.  The  high  concentration  of  construction \nworkers during project implementation, and improved accessibility \nand  mobility  resulting  from  the  Project  may  aggravate  the  spread \n(STIs). \nof  HIV/AIDS  and  sexually \nAn  HIV/AIDS  and  STI  prevention  program,  including  a  monitoring \nmechanism,  will  be  implemented  during  project  construction  and \noperation. Several action plans were developed to facilitate project \nimplementation  and,  together  with  the  consulting  services  and \ntraining  program,  will  help  local  capacity,  facilitate  monitoring, \nstrengthen interagency coordination, and minimize risks. \n \n\ntransmitted \n\ninfections \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Guangxi Roads Development II Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nThe  PRC  economy  grew  rapidly  during  the  past  decade\u2014averaging  around  10%  per \nannum\u2014and  is  expected  to  continue  growing  rapidly  in  the  foreseeable  future.  Despite  this \ngood progress, the Government\u2019s fight against poverty is far from over. There is a need to raise \nthe living standards of millions of people, particularly in the western region. The inadequate road \nnetwork,  road  transport  bottlenecks,  and  the  resulting  high  transport  costs  and  poor  levels  of \nservice are core constraints to achieving key economic and social development objectives. \n \nThe  economy\u2019s  changing  structure  has  altered  the  pattern  of  transport  demand.  \n3. \nThe network of 1.8 million kilometers (km) of roads at the end of 2003, was longer by 44,600 km \nfrom 2002. The motor vehicle fleet is growing at 15\u201330% per annum. In 2003 the vehicle fleet \nconsisted  of  about  24.3  million  trucks,  cars,  and  buses;  and  72.3  million  other  motorized \nvehicles, mainly motorcycles and agricultural vehicles. In 1985\u20132003 the privately owned fleet of \nmotor  vehicles  increased  more  than  40  times,  from  300,000  vehicles  to  12.5  million.  In  2003, \nroad passenger volume and passenger-km accounted for about 92.3% and 55.7%, respectively, \nof all modes. Despite its rapid increase over recent years, the motorization rate is lower than in \nmany other Asian and Pacific countries, with only 1.3 vehicles (trucks, cars, or buses) for every \n100 persons.1 Given the PRC's rapid economic growth, low vehicle ownership rates, lower car \nprices as tariff barriers fell after accession to the World Trade Organization, steadily increasing \nincomes,  increasing  access  to  loans  to  finance  automobile  purchases,  and  investment  in \nautomotive  manufacturing  ($6  billion  provided  by  state  banks  during  2001\u20132003),  the  vehicle \nfleet  is  anticipated  to  grow  rapidly  in  the  coming  years.  The  Asian  Develoment  Bank  (ADB)  is \nsupporting the improvements of road transport efficiency in the PRC.2 \n \nTo meet the growing demand, the Government has made major efforts to increase the \n4. \ncountry\u2019s road capacity. Roads are classified into expressways, and class I\u2013IV and unclassified \nroads (local roads).3 The backbone of the network is the national trunk highway system (NTHS), \na 35,000 km system of interprovincial expressways and high-class highways to be constructed \nby 2010. The lowest chain or lowest standard of the network is village or farm roads, which are \nnormally  either  class  IV  or  unclassified.  In  March  2000  the  Government  adopted  the  long-term \nWestern Region Development Strategy.4 This strategy, a key theme of the Tenth Five-Year Plan \n(10FYP,  2001\u20132005),  aims  to  reduce  development  disparities  between  the  western  and  coastal \nregions. ADB helped the Government formulate the details of this strategy.5 \n \n5. \nThe  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  improve  road  infrastructure  is  reflected  in  a  large \ninvestment  program,  which  reached  $44.9  billion  in  2003. 6  The  next  stage  of  the  road \n\n                                                 \n1  Corresponding figures are 59.6 for Australia, 2.5 for India, 5.0 for Indonesia, 65.3 for Japan, and 14.3 for Thailand. \n2  ADB. 2004.

Highway  infrastructure  expenditures  are  financed  from  dedicated  user \ncharges,  government  grants,  domestic  bank  loans  and  bonds,  and  foreign  loans  and \ninvestments, 7  as  well  as  private  sector  participation.  To  support  this  policy,  ADB  provided \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  develop  the  institutional  capacity  to  promote  corporatization, \nleasing,  and  securitization  in  the  road  sector.8 The  proposed  Project  will  support  the  Western \nRegion Development Strategy. The project framework is in Appendix 1 and the road subsector \nanalysis is in Appendix 2. \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n \n\n6. \nDespite  the  huge  amount  of  investment,  PRC\u2019s  road  network  has  weaknesses  that  are \nparticularly evident in the poor rural areas  of the western region (Supplementary Appendix A). \nHigh-standard  expressways  account  for  only  1.6%  of  the  total  network,  while  class  I  roads \nrepresent 1.7%, and class II 11.8%. About 70% of the county and township roads are gravel or \nearth  roads.  In  total,  173  townships  and  56,693  villages  have  no  road  connections.  No  public \ntransport services are available in 1,000 townships and 160,000 villages, most of which are in \nwestern region. Expressways are built on the outskirts of  key urban  areas,  but  connections  to \nthe  city  center  are  insufficient.  About  85%  of  the  total  network  does  not  have  adequate  traffic \nsignals, signs, or markings. Lack of transport integration and high logistics costs, have hindered \nthe development of the domestic market. \n \nThe rapid growth of traffic9 has resulted in increased congestion on the road network and \n7. \nan  increasing  number  of  road  accidents.  In  2002,  773,137  road  accidents  involved  109,381 \nfatalities, one of the highest rates in the world. If appropriate measures are not taken, fatalities \ncould reach 200,000 per annum by 2010. Economic losses from accidents are estimated to be \nbetween 1% and 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) per annum. The poor, who are usually \npedestrians, are disproportionately represented among those dying in road accidents. \n \n8. \nRapid socioeconomic development has increased the demand for road transport relative \nto  other  modes,  straining  road  infrastructure;  and  necessitated  adequate  access  to  isolated \nregions, including the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi).10 Road investment is a \nprerequisite to raising productivity and achieving long-term economic growth.11 Good roads are \nalso  required  to  allow  the  private  sector12 to  thrive  and  enable  markets  to  operate  efficiently.  \nA  prime  requirement  to  reduce  poverty  is  road  development,  as  it  provides  access  to  growth \ncenters  and  basic  social  services. 13 The  poor  have  limited  mobility  beyond  their  immediate \n\n                                                 \n7  During the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996\u20132000), road maintenance fees provided about 53% of financing for the road \nsubsector. Other domestic financing sources, including vehicle purchase fees, government grants, and domestic loans \nand bonds, provided about 36%. Foreign loans covered 8%. \n\n8  ADB. 1997.

Roads  are  very \nimportant as they help lower transport and input costs, improve farming practices, and promote \nthe  transition  from  a  subsistence  farming  rural  economy  to  a  cash  crop  economy  with  higher \nand  more  stable  household  income  flow.  An  ADB-financed  TA,14 which  selected  Guangxi  for \none  of  the  pilot  studies,  will  help  the  Government  prepare  a  road  transport  strategy  that  will \nintegrate expressways and local roads to meet community needs and support economic growth. \n \n9. \nThe Government's road development policy is to (i) construct expressways to expand the \nNTHS  to  link  all  cities  with  a  population  of  more  than  500,000;  (ii)  develop  secondary  roads, \nparticularly those that will help reduce poverty and promote the rural economy; and (iii) build roads \nto  support  regional  cooperation  with  neighboring  countries.  The  road  sector  is  the  largest  in \nADB\u2019s PRC operations, accounting for over 52% of the portfolio. To increase the probability that \nthe poor will benefit from ADB-funded roads, the projects have been shifted to the poor central \nand southwest regions. The scope of ADB-financed expressway projects has been broadened \nto  integrate  improvement  of  local  roads,  to  provide  better  access  to  poor  communities.  \nADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  in  the  PRC  gives  high  priority  to  removing  infrastructure  constraints \nand supporting policy reforms.15 External assistance to the PRC road subsector has come mainly \nfrom  ADB,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  and  World  Bank.  ADB  coordinates \nwith the World Bank and JBIC on policy and road subsector institutional issues. Since 1991 ADB \nhas provided 27 loans totaling about $4.8 billion to finance around 4,000 km of the road network \n(Appendix 3). \n \n\n1. \n\nProject Rationale \n\nGuangxi,  is  located  in  the  southern  part  of  the  country.  It  is  bordered  by  Yunnan \n10. \nProvince on the west, Guizhou on the northwest, Hunan on the northeast, and Guangdong on \nthe  southeast;  the  Gulf  of  Tonkin  on  the  south;  and  Viet  Nam  on  the  southwest  (Map  1).  \nThe  population  of  Guangxi  exceeded  48.2  million  at  the  end  of  2003.  The  area  is  one  of  the \nthree least developed in the PRC. The per capita GDP was CNY5,099 in 2003, about 62% of \nthe national average. Of 81 counties in Guangxi, 49 are designated as national (28) or provincial  \n(21) poverty counties.16 Poverty and minority groups are mainly concentrated in the west where \nthe  proposed  Project  is  located.  All  counties  in  the  project  area  are  either  nationally  or  locally \ndesignated poverty areas. Lack of road transport infrastructure is one of the factors contributing \nto the depressed economic conditions. \n \n11. \nRoads are the dominant transport mode in Guangxi. In 2003 the ownership of passenger \nvehicles  increased  by  over  20%  and  freight  vehicles  by  over  13%.  The  current  low  levels  of \nownership mean that this growth is likely to be sustained, and will increases traffic and create \ncongestion  on  the  current  fragile  road  network.  Improving  the  road  network  is  essential  to \nsupport  economic  growth,  connect  the  key  hubs,  and  spread  the  benefits  more  widely, \nparticularly to the poor and isolated communities. The project expressway is a segment of the \nNTHS  and  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)17 road  network,  and  will  provide  an  alternative \nhigh-capacity route to the existing G324 road (class II) between Greater Nanning (Tanluo City) \nand Baise City, which is one section of the national east-west highway from Hunan to Yunnan \nprovince.  The  existing  G324  has  poor  geometrical  standards  and  has  reached  its  capacity. \nTraffic  is  growing  at  an  annual  rate  of  7%.  Travel  time  between  Tanluo  and  Baise  is  about  \n                                                 \n14 ADB.  2004.

The high level of deaths and injuries from accidents on G324 places a heavy burden on \nthe  health  and  welfare  systems  of  the  poor  counties  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  will  help \npromote trade between Guangxi, the western provinces, and Viet Nam. Consistent with ADB\u2019s \noperational  strategy,  the  Project  will  support  (i)  construction  of  an  integrated  road  network,  \n(ii) added value and policy reform, and (iii) regional cooperation. \n \n\n2. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nADB  loans  have  facilitated  the  PRC\u2019s  economic  growth  significantly,  particularly  in  the \n12. \npoorer regions. A performance review of completed road projects concluded that, in general, all \nloans  to  the  road  subsector  in  the  PRC  have  been  or  are  being  implemented  satisfactorily.18  \nThe  project  completion  reports  prepared  for  nine  road  projects  conclude  that  eight  projects19 \nwere generally successful and one was highly successful. The project performance audit report \nfor  three  road  projects  concluded  that  the  three  were  either  highly  successful  or  successful. \nExperience in the PRC road subsector has indicated that while the overall performance of the \nhighway  portfolio  is  satisfactory,  some  problems  occurred  during  implementation\u23afincluding \nweak soil investigation during feasibility studies, underestimation of the technical complexity of \nexpressway  construction,  and  delays  in  resettlement  operations.  In  general,  the  portfolio \nperformance  reflects  PRC\u2019s  strong  sense  of  project  ownership,  implementation  capability, \nquality assurance, and compliance with covenants. However, some areas for improvement have \nbeen identified, including (i) making adequate provisions for operation and maintenance (O&M) \nto ensure sustainability; (ii) developing verifiable, monitorable indicators to better understand the \nsocioeconomic  impact  of  the  projects;  (iii)  improving  the  quality  and  quantity  of  ADB  review \nmissions  and  project  administration;  (iv)  addressing  institutional  weakness  in  the  interior \nprovinces; (v) minimizing delayed loan signing and effectiveness and lengthy approval period for \na  feasibility  study  and  prequalification  and  bidding  documents;  (vi)  addressing  the  institutional \nweakness  of  tendering  companies;  (vii)  improving  expressway  agencies\u2019  capability  for \nsustainable \ntransport  planning,  road  safety,  and  commercial  business  practices;  and  \n(viii)  addressing  institutional  issues  that  limit  the  coordination  necessary  to  develop  integrated \nexpressways and local roads, and improve road safety. \n \n13. \nThe  Guangxi  Communications  Department  (GCD)  has  implemented  two  ADB-financed \ntransport projects. One after completion was assessed as highly successful, and one is under \nconstruction.20 There are also two completed World Bank-financed transport projects: an inland \nwaterway  project  and  an  expressway  project.  A  lesson  learned  is  that  the  long  time  it  took  to \nobtain  approval  for  the  feasibility  study  and  the  lengthy  procedures  for  procuring  civil  works \ndelayed the start of the current Guangxi Roads Development I Project (Guangxi I). As a result, \nthe establishment of the expressway corporation was also delayed. Lessons from previous road \nprojects  in  the  PRC  have  been  incorporated  into  the  project  design:  (i)  to  avoid  delayed  loan \n\n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2001.

The Project will (i) strengthen \nconnectivity  between  the  NHTS  and  the  local  road  network;  (ii)  reduce  transport  prices,  and \nimprove  travel  time  and  comfort;  (iii)  provide  better  access  to  markets,  services,  jobs,  growth \ncenters, and isolated communities; (iv) promote asset management and maintenance, roadside \nstations  management,  transport  services,  road  safety  and  enforcement,  overloaded  vehicles \nmanagement, social and poverty reduction impacts, and corporatization; and (v) improve traffic \nbetween the western provinces, connection to the seaports in Guangxi, and access to the Viet \nNam border and GMS. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n15. \nThe  Project  will  (i)  construct  about  188  km  of  a  four-lane  access-controlled  toll \nexpressway,  25  km  of  class  II  connecting  roads,  12  interchanges,  12  toll  stations,  3  traffic \ncontrol  centers,  8  roadside  stations,  and  4  asset  management  and  maintenance  centers; \n(ii)  upgrade  250  km  of  intercounty  roads  and  500  km  of  minority  village  roads;  (iii)  procure \nequipment  for  asset  management  and  road  maintenance,  and  expressway  toll  collection, \nsurveillance,  communications,  safety,  and  vehicle-weighing  stations;  (iv)  address \nland \nacquisition and resettlement issues; and (v) provide consulting services and capacity building. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n\n1. \n\nSustainable Transport Planning and Value Added \n\n16. \nThe Project was developed in a participatory manner and sustainable transport planning \ncontext to integrate construction of roads with policy reform issues such as transport services, \nlocation  of  economic  centers,  social  and  poverty  issues,  road  maintenance,  road  accidents, \nroad administration, accessibility, and interagency cooperation. The Project will serve 5.6 million \npeople living in Guangxi\u2014where road density is 1.3 km per 1,000 inhabitants\u2014and about 90% \nethnic minorities, in addition to interprovincial and intercountry beneficiaries.23 Poverty incidence \n                                                 \n21 Average civil works procurement processing period of ADB-financed projects in various sectors in the PRC is about \n\n653 days from the Management Review Meeting to contract signing. \n\n22 ADB.  2003.

The  expressway  and  its  local  roads  will  connect  totally  isolated  minority \nvillages and optimize the efficiency and safety of the overall road network. Direct access will be \nprovided  to  5  key  county  centers,  907  schools,  93  hospitals,  95  village  markets,  20  tourism \nattractions,  agricultural  zones,  70  townships,  and  745  villages  and  isolated  communities. \nAlignments  of  project  roads  were  deliberately  selected  to  facilitate  local  and  intercounty  or \ninterprovincial  bus  services  and  freight  transport,  while  all  project  roads  will  be  managed  and \nmaintained  promptly  after  project  opening  to  ensure  steady  efficiency.  To  maximize  income-\ngenerating  opportunities  for  poor  communities,  a  new  scheme  of  farm  development  and \nchanged crop patterns will be implemented in many of the target villages as part of the Ethnic \nMinorities Development Plan (EMDP). The scheme will cost over $10 million. All key industries \nemploying over 100,000 people in the project area will have better access to markets and inputs \nvia  the  improved  road  network.  Action  plans  have  been  developed  and  translated  with  ADB \nhelp,  to  facilitate  implementation  and  monitoring  of  various  features  of  the  Project  and  to \nstrengthen stakeholder capacity and coordination. \n \n\n2. \n\nLocal Roads \n\n17. \nTo  ensure  that  benefits  reach  the  poor  and  meet  the  needs  of  all  stakeholders,  the \nProject has included constructing and upgrading 775 km of local roads, totaling over $60 million \nas  follows:  (i)  25  km  of  class  II  roads  to  link  the  expressway  with  surrounding  counties  and \nroads  networks,  to  serve  1.9  million  people,  of  whom  36%  are  poor  and  89%  are  ethnic \nminorities; (ii) upgrading 250 km of unclassified intercounty roads to Class III and IV to benefit \n210,000  isolated  mountain  people,  with  a  poverty  level  of  80%;  and  (iii)  upgrading  500  km  of \nunclassified  minority  village  roads  to  Class  IV  to  serve  378,000  totally  isolated  people,  with  a \npoverty  incidence  of  77%.  The  local  roads  were  selected  from  Guangxi\u2019s  10FYP,  and  all \neconomic,  social,  and  engineering  aspects  were  assessed.  The  Project  will  finance  around  \n$18 million of the local roads. Implementation and impact will be monitored concurrently with the \nexpressway component, with the help of the international consultants (Supplementary Appendix \nB). \n \n \n\nAsset Management and Road Maintenance \n\n3. \n\nRoad  maintenance  is  becoming  an  increasingly  important  issue  as  the  road  network \n18. \nexpands and use intensity increases. To overcome current obstacles and attract staff to work in \nthe  area,  Guangxi  will  apply  a  road  maintenance  scheme,  called  \u201cunified  leadership \nmanagement.\u201d  That  is,  GCD  develops  sector  plans  and  policies,  and  local  highway \nadministration and communication bureaus at prefecture and county levels implement the road \nmaintenance  plan  according  to  GCD  policies.  GCD  will  operate  the  project  expressway  and \nlocal roads using a cost-effective asset management and maintenance strategy. The Project will \n(i) procure  a relatively  large proportion of equipment, $7.5  million (in addition to the traditional \nexpressway  equipment)  for  (a)  road  maintenance,  such  as  multipurpose  truck  and  emergency \ndevices;  (b)  road  user  facilities,  e.g.,  signs  and  marks;  (c)  overloaded  vehicle  inspection \nsystems;  and  (d)  road  pavement  management  systems,  e.g.,  data  collection  and  analysis \nsoftware;  and  (ii)  strengthen  the  capability  of  Guangxi  Communications  College  (GCC)  to \nprovide  ongoing  capacity  building  and  staff  training  programs.  The  loan  will  also  finance  \n3  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  12  person-months  of  overseas  training.  \nTo ensure sustainability after project opening, the expressway fund source for maintenance will \nbe the toll revenues, while for nontolled roads, the fund sources  will be the road maintenance \nfee and beneficiary resources, in addition to the contribution of GCD (Appendix 4). \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 7\n\n \n\n4. \n\nRoadside Stations \n\n19. \nTo  distribute  benefits  in  the  project  area,  the  Project  was  designed  to  include  eight \nroadside stations in  various  counties\u2014four as  parking areas with  limited services, and four as \nfull service areas. Management of these stations will be awarded through competitive bidding. \nPreference will be given to contractors that will (i) provide better employment plans, and select \nemployees  in  consultation  with  the  local  county  women\u2019s  federation  and  poverty  reduction \noffices;  (ii)  promote  the  cultural  characteristics  in  the  relevant  county;  and  (iii)  promote  road \nsafety, environmental protection, and health issues (e.g., display posters and provide leaflets on \nHIV/AIDS).24 The  international  consultant  will  help  GCD  implement  this  scheme.  Three  traffic \ncontrol centers, four asset management and maintenance centers, and 12 toll stations will also \nbe  constructed.  These  facilities  will  create  over  2,500  permanent  jobs  and  a  considerable \nnumber of support jobs, mostly to benefit local communities. \n \n\n5. \n\nTransport Services \n\nObstacles  to  the  development  of  efficient  transport  services  in  the  project  area  include  \n20. \n(i) lack of road infrastructure; (ii) high transport costs; and (iii) lack of competition in the provision \nof passenger and freight services, and lack of facilities, e.g., spare parts and repair. Within the \nexpressway area itself, however, services are offered by road, rail, and inland waterway. Road \ntransport is the dominant mode, and accounts for two thirds of all freight traffic and 90% of local \nand  interprovincial/intercountry  passenger  traffic.  Buses  are  the  main  means  of  passenger \ntransport,  and  provide  linkages  between  homes,  farms,  markets,  places  of  employment, \nschools,  hospitals,  tourist  spots,  and  other  destinations.  Bus  operators  based  in  the  five  key \ncounties of the project area run daily services on 90 separate routes. These are supplemented \nby formal services into and through the area administered by Guangxi government (171 routes), \nand a range of informal services. Freight services are provided by a range of vehicles and also \nby animals. The area also carries a substantial proportion of through traffic, particularly between \nYunnan  and  other  western  provinces,  and  Guangdong.  The  area  contains  over  20  important \ntourist facilities, which attract local and interprovincial bus operations. \n \n21. \nConstruction of the project roads will significantly increase the number of bus and freight \nservices, as operators, passengers, and farmers take advantage of the faster transit times and, \nbetter  journey  opportunities.  The  increase  in  the  number  of  services  will  lead  to  greater \ncompetition,  which,  together  with  improved  operating  conditions,  will  lead  to  reductions  in \ntransport costs to the community.25 To ensure that the opportunities expected to arise are taken \nadvantage of, the Project has included a transport services action plan (Appendix 5). The action \nplan sets out a series of steps to address issues such as anticipated shuttle buses (150), new \nrural routes (50), role of roadside stations of the Project, construction of new county bus stations \n($46 million), and industry competition and regulation. A coordinated approach will be adopted, \nwith the transport operators and  local authorities working together to market and  publicize the \nnew facilities. The Project has financed translation of the action plan to facilitate implementation \nand  monitoring  and  strengthen  stakeholders\u2019  sense  of  ownership.  The  international  consultant \nwill help the government implement the action plan. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n24 HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n25 The operating costs for vehicles using the expressway route will typically fall by about a third. Travel time will be \n\nreduced by half for buses and vehicles, and by 30\u201350% for freight trucks. \n\n\f 8\n\n6. \n\nRoad Safety and Traffic Enforcement \n\n22. \nFor the first time in history, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly gathered in April \n2004 for a plenary  session devoted to road safety. The UN\u2019s Chief Legislative Body called on \nMember States to stimulate a new level of commitments to tackle road safety problems, which \nwill be the second cause of death facing the world during the next 10 years, particularly in the \nPRC  where  1  road  accident  death  occurs  every  5  minutes.  In  2003,  there  were  15,330  road \naccidents  in  Guangxi,  a  rate  of  10  traffic  accident  deaths  every  day  despite  the  relatively  low \nlevel of vehicle ownership. The existing G324 road has a high accident rate, about twice as high \nas the national average for Class II roads, and accounts for 50\u201377% of the total accidents in the \nsurrounding  poor  counties.  The  problem  will  get  worse  as  road  congestion  increases.  \nThe  Project  has  developed  a  road  safety  action  plan  in  consultation  with  all  parties.  The  plan \ntakes into account the requirements of the new national road safety law, which became effective \nin  May  2004, 26  and  integration  of  the  4  E\u2019s\u2014engineering,  enforcement,  education,  and \nemergency. The plan has set out the steps required to manage road safety through road design, \nroad  safety  audit,  and  targeted  enforcement  of  regulations  such  as  seat  belt  use,  no  drunk \ndriving, no speeding, and no unruly driver behavior. The plan also covers emergency and health \ncare  services.  Education  will  address  target  road  users,  the  community  and  children  through \nlectures and publicity  materials. Three static advertisements (4  m  x 6  m) to be built under the \nProject  will  be  displayed  by  the  police  in  selected  sites,  together  with  awareness  materials,  to \nmaximize safety. This is a new initiative accepted by a police department in the PRC as part of \nan ADB-financed road project. The Project is anticipated to reduce the number of road deaths in \nthe project area by an average of 90 deaths per annum over a 15-year period. The loan will also \nfinance  4  person-months  of  international  road  safety  and  traffic  management  specialists,  and  \n4 person-months of related overseas training (Appendix 6 and Supplementary Appendix C). \n \n \n\nRegional Cooperation \n\n7. \n\nThe  project  expressway  will  form  the  missing  link  to  give  the  western  region  provinces \n23. \naccess  to  the  seaports  in  southern  Guangxi,  particularly  to  the  ADB-financed  Fangcheng  Port  \n(footnote  20),  completed  in  2001  and  assessed  as  highly  successful.  The  intercounty  roads \nwere  selected  to  connect  Baise  City  (at  km  188  of  the  expressway)  with  the  Viet  Nam  border \nthrough  Napo  county,  to  contribute  to  better  regional  cooperation  and  improve  connectivity  of \nthe  isolated  mountain  community  along  the  360  km  border.  Traffic  on  the  intercounty  roads\u2014\ndespite their poor and unclassified status\u2014is currently about 600 vehicles per day, and this is \nexpected  to  double  during  the  first  5  years  of  operation.  The  intercounty  roads  will  promote \nborder  trade  among  Napo  county,  Viet  Nam  and  Yunnan  Province.  The  volume  of  trade \nbetween Guangxi and Viet Nam was about $500 million in 2002, growing at 65\u201370% annually. \nCross-border trade will increase sharply after project completion. The improved connection will \nhelp develop tourism in the border areas. Before the project opens, the international consultant \nwill  help  GCD  to  prepare  an  efficient  traffic  management  scheme  to  enhance  overall  road \nnetwork operations, including intercountry and interprovincial traffic. \n \n\n                                                 \n26 ADB has helped the Government through technical assistance (ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China for Capacity Building in Traffic Safety, Planning, and Management. Manila.) in implementing the \nnew  road  safety  law.  A  specialized  road  safety  web  site  has  also  been  developed  to  fill  current  information  and \ntraining gap to help DMCs to address the problem \u2013 http://www.adb.org/Projects/PRCRoadSafety/default.asp. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 9\n\n \n\n8. \n\nStakeholders Consultation \n\n24. \nTo  ensure  that  the  Project  reflected  the  concerns  of  stakeholders,  a  relatively  large \nnumber of around 4,000 people were consulted through (i)  feasibility  study assessment (200); \n(ii)  evaluation  of  the  preliminary  design  (150);  (iii)  social  and  economic  survey  (2000);  \n(iv)  preparation  of \ntraffic  survey  (165);  \nfinal  resettlement  plan/framework  (1250);  (v) \n(vi) overloaded vehicle survey (45); and (vii) meetings with Guangxi vice governor, traffic police, \nmayors,  politicians,  and  senior  officials  at  provincial  and  county  levels  (170).  The  needs  and \npriorities  of  stakeholders  were  recorded,  and  the  information  collected  was  used  to  formulate \nthe project components. All communities expressed a high degree of support for the Project. \n \n \n\nOverloaded Vehicles \n\n9. \n\n25. \nOverloading of vehicles is a problem nationwide. It has a significant adverse impact on \npavement conditions, traffic flow, and safety, and results in economic losses and inconvenience \nto  the  community  and  road  users.  The  project  TA  conducted  a  24-hour  survey  on  the  G324 \nroad.  Of  the  total  sample  of  6,000  vehicles,  around  1,000  were  tested  and  the  majority  were \nfound significantly overloaded. Currently, there is no system in Guangxi to monitor overloaded \nvehicles,  and  police  enforcement  is  insufficient.  An  action  plan  was  developed  as  part  of  the \nProject  to  help  the  government  address  this  problem  (Supplementary  Appendix  D).  The  plan \nincludes  improving  pavement  design  and  installing  weighing  devices  at  the  main  entrances  to \nthe expressway. Portable systems will also be procured under the Project to monitor overloaded \nvehicles  on  the  local  roads.  To  prevent  overloaded  vehicles  from  using  the  project  roads,  the \nimportance of enforcement procedures in conjunction with the police has also been addressed. \nThe international consultant will help GCD undertake the necessary measures to implement the \naction plan. \n \n \n\nHIV/AIDS \n\n10. \n\n26. \nThe  project  counties  are  high  risk  areas  for  HIV/AIDS.  Baise  County  is  now \nimplementing  an  efficient  HIV/AIDS  program  with  the  help  of  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational  Development,  under  the  guidance  of  the  governor,  who  chairs  the  local  leading \ngroup  of  this  Project.  The  HIV/AIDS  program  will  be  implemented  in  the  project  area  to  cover  \n(i)  establishment  of  health  clinics  at  the  construction  camps,  (ii)  awareness  posters  and \nbooklets,  (iii)  education  program,  and  (iv)  prevention  measures  (Supplementary  Appendix  E). \nGCD and health authorities  will ensure that prevention  measures are  in place and  information \non the risks of HIV/AIDS is disseminated continuously to workers and local communities during \nconstruction and to transport operators and truck drivers during operation of the project facilities. \nThe EMDP of the Project includes prevention measures, which will also be implemented by the \ngovernment. \n \n\n11. \n\nCorporatization \n\n27. \nGCD  experienced  some  delay  in  meeting  the  covenants  for  corporatization  under \nGuangxi I. The delay was partly due to a delay of over 1 year in project commencement. It also \nreflected  unease  on  the  part  of  the  Government  over  the  proposed  model  for  corporatization, \nnamely that all expressways in Guangxi should be operated by one large company. It was felt \nthat  it  did  not  offer  attractive  options  for  potential  private  sector  involvement  in  road \ndevelopment in one of the poorest areas of the PRC. \n \n\n\f 10\n\nThe  Government  has  now  agreed  to  establish  a  corporation  (the  project  company)  for \n28. \noperation,  maintenance,  and  management  of  expressways  financed  by  ADB  under  Guangxi  I \nand this Project (Guangxi II). GCD has agreed that (i) the project company will be established \nby  30  September  2005  for  operation,  maintenance,  and  management  of  both  ADB-financed \nGuangxi  I  and  Guangxi  II;  (ii)  the  project  company  will  be  the  implementing  agency  (IA) \nresponsible  for  operation,  maintenance,  and  management  of  the  Guangxi  I  and  Guangxi  II \nexpressways and GCD will remain as the Executing Agency for Guangxi I and Guangxi II; (iii) a \nconcession agreement will be entered into between GCD and the project company in form and \nsubstance acceptable to ADB. The final draft concession agreement will be submitted to ADB \nby 31 July 2005, and GCD and the project company will sign the concession agreement prior to \nthe transfer of the project expressway and project company. Guangxi I will be transferred to the \ncompany  no  later  than  30  September  2005,  and  Guangxi  II  after  completion  of  construction \n(Supplementary  Appendix  F).  GCD  has  started  processing  the  establishment  of  the  company \naccording  to  the  agreement.  A  company  preparatory  committee  was  formulated  on  28  April \n2004, which was a condition for the appraisal on 27 May 2004. Preparation of the company draft \ncharter was a condition for loan negotiation as was the regional government\u2019s approval of the \nestablishment of the company. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nThe total project cost is estimated at about $726 million equivalent, with $304.1 million in \n\n29. \nforeign exchange and $421.9 million equivalent in local currency (Appendix 7). \n \n\nTable 1: Summary of Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\n1.

Provided in US \n30. \ndollars, the loan will have a maturity period of 24 years, including a grace period of 4 years, an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, conversion options that may \nbe  exercised  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Conversion  Guidelines,  and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement.  Interest  will  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility.  The  Borrower  will  be  the \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 11\n\nPRC.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  PRC\u2019s  decision  to  borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions; and (ii) an \nundertaking  that  these  choices  were  the  PRC\u2019s  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in \nreliance on any communication or advice of ADB. The proceeds from ADB\u2019s loan will be made \navailable to the Government, which will in turn make the loan proceeds available to Guangxi, on \nthe  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan.  GCD  will  bear  the  interest  rate \nvariation  and  foreign  exchange  risks.  About  $526  million  equivalent  will  be  required  as \nGovernment counterpart funds to implement the Project. The Government has agreed that the \ncounterpart funds would be made available in a timely manner. \n \n\nTable 2: Summary of Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \n\n1.

A project management office (PMO) \nwill  be  established  in  GCD  headquarters  to  coordinate  and  monitor  all  project  activities  and \nadministration  matters.  The  PMO  will  coordinate  with  the  Provincial  Finance  Bureau  on  loan \ndisbursement and repayment. A project construction office (PCO) will also be established at the \nproject  site  to  deal  with  construction  issues.  A  deputy  director  responsible  for  physical \nimplementation  of  project  activities  on  a  day-to-day  basis  and  the  preparation  of  progress \nreports will head the PCO. A team of qualified engineering, financial, and administrative staff will \nbe  assigned.  The  local  roads  program  will  be  implemented  by  various  agencies  under  the \nguidance of GCD, and a land acquisition and resettlement leading group has been established. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  conducted  during  project  appraisal  concluded  that  the \nProject would have in place an adequate project financial management system that can provide, \nwith  reasonable  assurance,  accurate  and  timely  information  on  the  status  of  the  Project.  \nThe  financial  management  questionnaire  was  completed  during  project  appraisal,  and  is \nattached to Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n32. \nPreconstruction  activities  including  preliminary  and  detailed  design,  and  preparation  of \nprequalification  and  bidding  documents  have  all  been  completed.  The  opening  of \nprequalification  of  contractors  for  civil  works  was  on  28  July  2004.  The  central  Government \napproved the feasibility study on 21 July 2004. The target date for starting the expressway is the \nfourth quarter of 2004, while the target date for completing construction activities is the second \n\n\f 12\n\nhalf of 2007. The overall Project, including full testing of the equipment and trial period, will be \ncompleted in June 2008 (Appendix 8). Under GCD\u2019s supervision, local roads will be upgraded \nconcurrently with expressway construction and in compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n33. \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  civil \nworks for the project expressway will be divided into 12 packages, 10 of which will be financed \nby  the  loan  and  procured  under  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB),  including  the  relevant \nconnecting  roads.  Six  expressway  pavement  packages  will  also  be  procured  under  ICB.  \nOne expressway equipment package, and 12 asset management and maintenance equipment \npackages  will  be  procured  through  ICB,  direct  purchase,  and  international  shopping. \nProcurement  for  intercounty  roads  (11  packages)  will  be  through  LCB  and  procurement  of \nminority  village  roads  (5  main  packages)  will  follow  force  account  procedures.  International \nbidding  will  be  handled  by  two  tendering  companies  qualified  to  perform  the  task  and  has \nprevious experience in other externally funded projects. All equipment will be used solely for the \npurpose  of  expressway  communications,  surveillance  and  toll  system,  capacity  building,  or  for \npostconstruction  operations.  No  equipment  financed  by  ADB  will  be  used  for  construction  or \nhired out to the civil works contractors (Appendix 9). \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n34. \nConstruction supervision involving about 4,500 person-months of consulting services will \nbe undertaken by domestic consultant teams experienced in implementing similar road projects. \nA chief supervision engineer will head the domestic consultants\u2019 teams, which will be financed \nby  GCD  and  recruited  in  accordance  with  local  procedures satisfactory  to  ADB.    The  loan  will \nfinance  57  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  to  (i)  assist  in  project \nmanagement  over  the  entire  construction  period;  (ii)  provide  expertise  in  bridges,  road  safety \nand  traffic  management,  asset  management  and  maintenance,  electrical  and  mechanical \n(E&M),  environmental  impact,  corporate  management,  and  benefit  monitoring  and  social \nimpacts. The team leader will act as the deputy chief engineer with authority to sign, certify, and \nmake  recommendations;  will  provide  36  person-months  input  over  the  entire  construction \nperiod;  and  will  help  the  chief  supervision  engineer.  International  training  covering  50  person-\nmonths  is  included  under  international  consulting  services  to  develop  GCD  staff\u2019s  skills  and \nenhance capacity in road planning, construction, and operations (Supplementary Appendix H). \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n35. \nThe ADB loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nSince  most  payments  will  be  made  for  large  contracts  above  $100,000,  direct  payment, \nreimbursements,  and  commitment  procedures  will  be  used.  If  the  Government  initially  funds \neligible  expenditures,  ADB's  reimbursement  procedure  will  be \nfacilitate \ndisbursements,  an  imprest  account 27  will  be  established  by  Guangxi  Finance  Bureau \nimmediately after loan effectiveness. Disbursements from the imprest account will be supported \nby an appropriate withdrawal application and related documentation. The ceiling of the imprest \naccount  will  be  set  as  either  the  estimated  expenditures  for  the  next  6  months,  or  10%  of  the \nloan amount, whichever is lower. The statement of expenditures (SOE) will apply to payments \nunder $200,000 for reimbursement and imprest account procedures. \n \n\nfollowed.  To \n\n                                                 \n27 The imprest account is being used in World Bank-financed loans. The utilization performance has been satisfactory. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 13\n\n6. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action \n\n36. \nDuring  project  processing,  the  Government  requested  ADB\u2019s  approval  for  advance \nprocurement  action  for  civil  works.28 Advance  procurement  action  was  approved  on  24  May \n2004.  It  covers  prequalification  of  contractors,  tendering,  and  bid  evaluation  for  civil  works \npackages, but does not include the signing of contracts. The advance actions will be undertaken \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  prequalification  documents  were \nissued to bidders on 28 May 2004, and the bidding documents were submitted to ADB in June \n2004. The Government and GCD have been advised that approval of advance action does not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project. A shortlist of international consulting firms for construction \nsupervision was also approved by ADB on 25 May 2004. It covers selection of the appropriate \nfirm, but not including contract signing which is subject to loan effectiveness. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n37. \nPrevious  ADB-financed  road  projects  in  Guangxi  have  a  good  record  of  financial \nreporting. GCD will maintain separate accounts for the Project and related financial statements, \nsuch as statements of source and application of funds, implementation of the Loan Agreement, \nand balance sheet. The income statements will be prepared for the first full year of commercial \noperation  of  the  project  expressway.  GCD  will  prepare  one  set  of  financial  statements  for  the \nProject  and  another  for  consolidated  accounts  following  the  establishment  of  the  corporation, \nand will have them audited annually. The audit will be in accordance with appropriate auditing \nindependent  external  auditors  whose  qualifications, \nstandards  consistently  applied  by \nexperience,  and  terms  of  reference  are  acceptable  to  ADB.  GCD  will  submit  to  ADB,  within  \n6 months of the end of each related fiscal year, certified copies of audited project accounts and \nfinancial  statements  and  an  auditor\u2019s  report  for  the  Project,  all  in  the  English  language.  \nDuring  the  midterm  review  (para.  41)  scheduled  for  2006,  GCD\u2019s  financial  projections  for  the \nproject  expressway  for  the  next  5  years  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  thereafter \nupdated  annually.  The  Government  has  agreed  that  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  be \nmade  for  reporting  implementation  progress.  During  construction,  GCD  will  submit  quarterly \nprogress  reports  in  such  form  and  detail  as  ADB  may  request.  To  facilitate  project \npostevaluation,  GCD  will  furnish  ADB  a  completion  report  within  3  months  of  the  end  of  the \nProject.  GCD  will  submit  to  ADB  reports  on  contract  management  procedures  (including \napproval  of  variation  orders),  forecast  traffic  volumes,  proposed  toll  tariff  increases,  benefit \nmonitoring, and other activities within the time stipulated in the Loan and Project Agreements. \n \nAs  a  SOE  and  imprest  fund  facility  will  be  provided  under  the  Project,  the  special- \n38. \npurpose audit should include a separate opinion on (i) utilization of the imprest account; (ii) SOE \nincluding  whether  the  amount  claimed  was  duly  supported  to  the  extent  verified;  and  \n(iii) whether or not GCD was operating the imprest account in accordance with ADB procedures. \n \n\n8. \n\nAnticorruption \n\n39. \nADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  the  government  officials.  Attention  was \ndrawn  to  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption  that  was  added  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  particularly  the  need  for  bidders, \nsuppliers,  contractors,  and  consultants  to  be  ethical  in  procuring  and  executing  ADB-financed \ncontracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. GCD has agreed to include \n\n                                                 \n28 This  Project  was  first  listed  in  ADB  Business  Opportunities  (ADBBO)  in  March  2004,  and  approval  of  advance \n\naction was reported in the May 2004 issue. \n\n\f 14\n\nthe  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  in  all  documents  and  contracts  governing \nproject implementation. ADB\u2019s PRC program includes assistance29 that will improve governance \nand  encourage  fraud  reduction.  The  central  Government  is  undertaking  serious  measures  to \nfight  corruption,  and  the  March  2004  report  has  addressed  this  issue  and  identified  some  \n15  cases  within  various  provincial  communications  departments  during  recent  years.  None  of \nthese  cases  was  associated  with  ADB\u2013financed  projects  in  the  PRC.  GCD  has  a  good \nreputation in implementing previous ADB and World Bank projects. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n40. \nGCD  has  agreed  on  a  set  of  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  of  project \ngoals  and  objectives. 30  Where  relevant,  indicators  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender.  The \nbaseline  indicator  values  will  be  collected  before  project  implementation.  The  indicator  values \nwill be updated at midterm, completion, and annually for 3 years after completion, as shown in \nthe  outline  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS).  A  report  summarizing  the \nfindings and analysis of the project impacts will be incorporated annually in the second quarterly \nreport submitted to ADB. With the assistance of the international consultant, a domestic institute \nto  be  recruited  by  GCD  (24  person-months)  will  develop  the  PPMS,  collect  and  analyze  data, \nconduct surveys, and prepare PPMS progress and monitoring reports in consultation with ADB \n(Appendix 10). \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\ninstitutional,  administrative,  organizational, \n\n41. \nADB,  Government,  and  GCD  will  carry  out  a  midterm  review  of  the  Project  in  2006, \ntechnical,  environmental, \nfocusing  on  all \nresettlement, social, poverty reduction, economic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may \nimpact on project performance and viability. In consultation with national Government agencies \nconcerned,  the  review  will  examine  and  update  the  status  of  sector  reforms,  policy \ndevelopment,  and  compliance  with  loan  covenants.  ADB  will  update  the  anticipated  project \nsocioeconomic and financial performance based on updated data and traffic projections. \n \n\n11. \n\nCapacity Building and Human Resources Development \n\n42. \nThe  international  consultant  for  construction  supervision  will  provide  on-the-job  training \nfor  GCD  staff  and  domestic  consultants  in  construction  supervision,  quality  control,  and  road \nnetwork management. Domestic consultants will provide training in a variety of road engineering \nand  management  subjects.  An  international  training  program  for  50  person-months  will  be \nfinanced under the loan. The international consultant will help GCD develop the program. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n43. \nTravel  Demand.  The  Project  will  increase  transport  capacity  to  meet  the  demand  and \nreduce  travel  distance.  The  traffic  on  the  expressway  is  forecast  to  grow  from  about  10,700 \nPCU31 per day when facilities are commissioned in 2007, to about 47,100 PCU in 2026. Traffic \n\n                                                 \n29 ADB.  1998.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Strengthening  the  Government  Auditing \n\nSystem. Manila. \n\n30 The indicators were refined based on the findings of the project TA (footnote 22) and other studies. \n31 PCU  =  passenger  car  unit.  PCU  is  the  official  unit  for  measuring  traffic  for  all  classes  of  roads  in  the  PRC  in \naccordance with the new technical standard of highway engineering, which became effective on 1 March 2004. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 15\n\nflows are based on an average real toll per vehicle-km increasing from about CNY0.88 in 2007 \nto almost CNY1.00 in 2027. Local roads will also experience significant traffic growth. The traffic \nprojections  take  into  account  (i)  expected  economic  growth  in  the  project  area;  (ii)  additional \ntraffic generated by the Project due to enhanced development potential in the area; (iii) increase \nin interprovincial and intercountry traffic, and (iv) impact of the toll level (Appendix 11). \n \n44. \nEconomic  Benefits.  The  economic  impacts  of  the  Project  were  analyzed  for  the \nexpressway,  the  local  roads  component,  and  the  two  combined.  Without  the  Project,  the \nincreased traffic in the corridor will cause congestion, increase vehicle operating costs (VOCs), \nand reducing road safety and accessibility. The expressway will provide the needed increase in \ncapacity.  Economic  benefits  of  traffic  transferring  to  the  expressway  from  the  existing  G324 \ninclude travel time savings, savings in transport costs allowing more efficient transport services, \nand  increases  in  safety  and  comfort.  Environmental  benefits  which  will  also  come  from  the \nreduced  vehicle  emissions  and  noise  were  not  included  in  the  analysis  because  of  a  lack  of \nsuitable data and evaluation methodology. GCD will build noise barriers along the expressway \nwhere  required.  The  lower  transport  costs  will  facilitate  further  economic  growth  in  the  area, \nleading to higher traffic flows and toll revenues. Traffic continuing to use the existing G324 will \nbenefit  from  reduced  congestion  and  accidents.  The  expressway's  economic  costs  cover \nconstruction, land acquisition and resettlement, environmental management, and O&M. For the \nlocal roads component, benefits arise from (i) the increased per capita incomes in remote areas \ndue to lower transport costs and improved access resulting in better agricultural prices, cheaper \ninputs,  and  improved  access  to  markets;  (ii)  savings  in  VOCs;  and  (iii)  increased  personal \nmobility  giving  greater  employment  opportunities  and  allowing  social  interaction  and  improved \naccess  to  facilities,  all  of  which  will  help  raise  the  overall  level  of  welfare  of  the  project \nbeneficiaries.  With  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  17.8%,  for  the  combined \nexpressway  and  local  roads,  the  Project  is  considered  economically  viable.  The  EIRR  for  the \nexpressway component itself is 17.1% and that for the local roads is about 65%. This high figure \nreflects  the  relatively  low  costs  of  the  upgrading  proposed  for  these  roads  and  the  substantial \nbenefits  that  are  potentially  achievable  with  improved  accessibility.  Likely  changes  in  the  key \nvariables or an assessment of the risks do not significantly affect viability, and in the entire set of \nstandard  tests  the  EIRR  remains  well  above  the  12%  threshold  (Appendix  12  and \nSupplementary Appendix I). \n \n45. \nFinancial  Benefits.  The  toll  rates  proposed  for  the  project  roads  are  in  line  with  tolls \nproposed  for  other  roads  in  Guangxi.  Given  the  traffic  forecast  and  toll  levels,  the  financial \nperformance  of  the  Project  is  satisfactory  (Appendix  13).  To  confirm  the  appropriate  toll  level \nGCD will undertake a toll study before opening the expressway and yearly for 5 years thereafter \nand will submit the results to ADB for comment. The level of the tolls will be designed to ensure \nthat  the  revenue  will  cover  O&M  costs,  debt  service,  and  depreciation  in  excess  of  debt \nservicing; and generate an acceptable rate of return on the investment. Financial evaluation was \nundertaken  in  real  terms  using  constant  2004  prices.  The  project  cost  estimates  and  financial \nprojections in nominal terms were converted to real terms by adjusting for the projected effects \nof foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuation. Incremental costs and benefits were \nderived  by  evaluating  the  financial  position  of  the  GCD  in  with-  and  without-project  scenarios. \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  for  the  Project,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  is \n7%. This compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 2.7%, also \ncomputed  on  an  after-tax  basis.  The  Project  is  considered  both  financially  viable  and \nsustainable. Sensitivity and risk analysis indicates that the FIRR for the Project overall is robust \nunder  adverse  conditions.  The  more  detailed  financial  analysis  is  in  Appendix  14  and \nSupplementary Appendix G. \n \n\n\f 16\n\nSocial  Benefits  and  Poverty  Reduction  Impacts.  Socioeconomic  surveys  of  the \n46. \nbeneficiaries found that inadequate road access prevented farmers and poor communities from \nearning adequate income. All survey participants, particularly residents of the isolated minority \nvillages  and  intercounty  areas  ranked  road  infrastructure  as  a  second  need  after  food  or \nincome. Among 28 mountain villages surveyed, the annual per capita income was CNY875 for  \n9  villages  served  only  by  footpaths.  The  corresponding  figures  are  CNY1,425  for  villages  with \ngravel road access and over CNY1,500 for villages with some paved road access. The Project \nwill link poor areas to NTHS and county and village networks; will expand economic and social \nactivities; strengthen cultural links; and improve access to markets, health centers, schools, and \nother  services.  The  Project  will  promote  a  commercial  environment  where  farmers  can  grow \nmore cash crops or fruits, including winter season vegetables and sugarcane, and have better \ntransport facilities. The Project will enable poor farmers to increase their incomes at an annual \nrate  of  10\u201315%32 in  the  next  5  years.  The  Project  will  use  about  500,000  person-months  of \nunskilled  local  labor  as  construction  workers  for  over  3  years,  while  the  operation  of  the \nexpressway  will  create  over  2,500  permanent  jobs 33  covering  road  administration  and \nmaintenance, and roadside stations. The Project will facilitate the development of the aluminum \nindustry,  the  backbone  industry  of  the  project  area  as  well  as  of  Guangxi,  from  the  current  \n1.2  million  tons  of  alumina  powder  to  5  million  tons  in  5\u201310  years,  creating  employment  and \nmore  foreign  investment  opportunities  in  the  area.  Other  effects  of  traffic  growth  will  include  a \nrapid \ntransport  services, \nurbanization,  tourism,  and  road  safety  improvement.  The  combination  of  these  effects  will \nreduce poverty on a sustainable basis. The social analysis found that there would be 2.9 million \ndirect project beneficiaries, accounting for 52% of the total population (5.6 million) of the project \narea.  Rural  households  will  be  the  largest  beneficiary  group  (78%).  Net  direct  project  benefits \namounting to 40% will go to the poor of the project area in Guangxi. Over time the benefits will \naccrue  to  a  much  bigger  population,  reflecting  the  benefits  of  intercountry  and  interprovincial \ntraffic (Appendix 15). \n \nB. \n\nthe  provision  of  competitive \n\nin  vehicle  ownership, \n\nImpacts \n\nincrease \n\n47. \nSocial and Gender Impacts. The Project will benefit both women and men. Women are \nthe  main  contributors  to  farming  activities\u2014marketing  small  surplus  production\u2014and  are \nresponsible  for  household  chores.  Young  women  travel  frequently  to  Guangdong  and  other \nlarge cities as migrants from the project area. Reduced travel costs, more readily available and \nmore  frequent  public  transport,  and  better  roads  will  help  improve  the  lives  of  women  and \nchildren.  Improved  transport  will  result  in  better  access  to  health  and  social  facilities.  \nWomen  living  along  the  expressway  and  those  living  near  the  contractors'  camps  will  benefit \nfrom catering to the construction workers and from providing services to and employment in the \nroadside stations following project operation. Half of the employees in the roadside stations will \nbe women.34 \n \n48. \nLand Acquisition and Resettlement. The expressway will directly affect 18 townships, \n70 villages, and 505 village groups in six districts and counties. The expressway and connecting \nroads will require 1,434 ha of land. About 313 ha of land will be temporarily borrowed during the \nconstruction  phase.  The  degree  of  impact  is  equivalent  to  13,141  persons  completely  losing \ntheir  farmland.  Also,  360  households  (1,584  persons)  will  have  to  relocate  their  houses.  \nRoad  alignments  were  selected  based  on  impact  surveys  and  consultations  with  local \n\n                                                 \n32 Average incomes for the 28 national poverty counties increased by 6.5% from 2001 to 2002. \n33 Ten employees per km in the case of the ADB Hebei section of the Beiing-Shanghai Expressway. \n34 Women employees make up 60% in the service areas of the ADB-financed expressway in Hebei Province. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 17\n\ninformation  on  resettlement \n\ncommunities  to  minimize  impacts  on  paddy  land,  vegetable  land,  and  housing.  Consequently, \nthe  project  impact  at  the  village  level  is  relatively  moderate.  A  resettlement  plan  (RP)  was \nprepared based on impact surveys and consultations. The resettlement budget for the proposed \nexpressway and connecting roads (25 km) is $75.5 million equivalent. A resettlement booklet in \nChinese was distributed to affected households and publicized in the local media in May 2004, \nto  give \nimpacts,  resettlement  policy,  compensation  rates, \norganizational arrangements, and grievance procedures. \n \nFor the 250 km intercounty roads, investigations were carried out in three counties and \n49. \nthe results are included in the RP. Upgrading those roads will require acquisition of 118 ha and \naffect the equivalent of 498 people. An estimated 67 houses with 296 people will be relocated. \nThe cost of land acquisition and resettlement is $1.7 million equivalent, which is included in the \ncost  estimates  for  the  intercounty  roads.  For  the  minority  village  roads  (500  km),  the  land \nacquisition  procedure  may  differ  for  some  roads  that  fall  completely  within  the  jurisdiction  of \nadministrative  villages,  so  there  is  no  transfer  of  land.  If  some  villagers  lose  land,  they  will  be \ncompensated for their loss according to local laws and regulations, which normally involve the \nprovision  of  replacement  land.  A  resettlement  framework  (RF)  was  prepared  for  the  minority \nvillage  roads  and  was  appended  to  the  RP.  The  final  RP  and  RF  were  approved  by  GCD  in \nJune  2004  and  uploaded  on  ADB\u2019s  website  in  September  2004  (Appendix  16).  During \nimplementation, affected groups will be consulted further and will participate in the monitoring. \nThe local government is responsible for implementing the RP and RF but the village and group \nleaders will make the key decisions and take action. \n \n50. \nEthnic  Minorities.  The  project  area  is  the  original  homeland  of  the  Zhuang  people. \nThe  Zhuang  account  for  over  87%  of  the  total  population,  while  the  Yao  make  up  about  3%.  \nThe project expressway will facilitate economic development and the local roads will benefit the \nremote areas. The minority village roads program will benefit 378,000 people, of whom 98% are \nminorities.  The  Project  is  not  expected  to  have  any  adverse  impacts  on  minorities,  except  for \nland  acquisition.  To  enhance  the  benefits  for  ethnic  minorities,  the  Project  will  take  special \nmeasures, which are set out in an EMDP developed under the project TA in consultation with \nethnic  minority  villages  and  the  local  government.  The  final  EMDP  was  approved  by  GCD  in \nJune 2004 and uploaded on ADB\u2019s website in September 2004 (Appendix 17). \n \n51. \nEnvironmental  Impacts  and  Vehicle  Emissions  Control.  The Project is classified as \nenvironmental category A by ADB. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) concluded that \nall  impacts  can  be  successfully  mitigated  if  existing  national  and  local  standards  are  followed. \nThe  Project  poses  low  environmental  risks.  It  will  reduce  vehicle  emissions  as  a  result  of \nimproved motor vehicle engine efficiency when operating on the expressway, compared with the \nwithout-Project  scenario.  Traffic  noise  barriers  will  be  installed  as  required.  As  much  of  the \ntraffic on the existing G324 will be diverted to the expressway, noise levels, vehicle emissions, \nand emergency operations along G324 are expected to diminish, benefiting a large number of \npeople,  as  well  as  schools,  hospitals,  and  other  sensitive  receptors.  The  summary  EIA  was \ncirculated  on  17  June  2004,  and  its  monitoring  program  and  mitigating  measures  will  be \nimplemented in the project area. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\n52. \nThe  Project  is  not  subject  to  any  significant  technical  risks,  given  GCD\u2019s  proven \nexperience  and  good  performance  in  implementing  this  type  of  project.  Prequalification  of \ncontractors  will  focus  on  their  technical  and  financial  capability  to  handle  complex  works.  \nWith  the  help  of  the  international  consultants,  monitoring  and  efficient  project  management \n\n\f 18\n\nsystems will be set up for timely identification of technical problems and carrying out corrective \nmeasures. High-standard equipment will be procured and staff will be selected on their merits to \nimplement  the  Project  and  operate  its  facilities.  Action  plans  have  been  formulated  and \ntranslated  to  facilitate  implementation  and  prevent  adverse  impacts.  The  expected  continued \nstrong economic growth and forecasts based on actual traffic trends in the area indicate that the \ncontinuously  increasing  traffic  limits  the  risk  that  economic  benefits  will  not  materialize.  \nThe  proposed  toll  level  is  consistent  with  the  local  economy  and  reflects  the  trend  in  tolls  for \nGuangxi expressways. The foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk to be borne by GCD will \nbe  identified  in  the  ADB  loan  agreement.  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue,  designed  to  create  a  legally \nindependent  and  financially  autonomous  expressway  company,  will  promote  financial  risk \nmanagement and mitigation. The project covenants will encourage GCD to adopt best practice. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n53. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n54. \nConstruction  Quality.  The  government  of  Guangxi  will  cause  GCD  to  ensure  that  the \nproject expressway and local roads are constructed or upgraded with reference to the highway \ndesign  manual  developed  under  ADB-financed  TA  2573-PRC, 35  where  required,  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  2004  technical  standard  of  highway  engineering;  and  that  the  standards  and \nconstruction  supervision  under  the  Project  follow  nationally  and  internationally  accepted \npractices. \n \nCounterpart  Financing. The government of Guangxi will take all necessary measures \n55. \nto  ensure  that  (i)  GCD  can  successfully  construct  the  project  expressway,  and  (ii)  the  local \nroads construction and upgrading are completed before the expressway is opened. \n \nAsset  Management,  Operation  and  Maintenance.

GCD  will  install  vehicle  axle  weighing  and  weighing  scales \n59. \nequipment at the project expressway tollgates; make suitable arrangements for operating such \nequipment; and monitor overloading vehicles on the local roads. Before commercial operation of \nthe Project, GCD will submit to ADB a statement indicating legal axle load limits, frequency of \ntesting, and penalties for infringement. \n \n60. \nChange  in  Ownership.  The  Government  of  the  PRC  and  the  government  of  Guangxi \nwill  consult  ADB  at  least  6  months  before  any  anticipated  change  in  ownership  of  the  project \nfacilities, or before it makes any sale, transfer, or assignment of GCD's or the project company\u2019s \ninterest in the project expressway, or rights of O&M of the project expressway; and will ensure \nthat such transfer is made in a legal or transparent manner. \n \nTolls. The government of Guangxi will ensure that at least 6 months before expressway \n61. \noperations start, GCD will propose a set of toll rates in accordance with the Highway Law while \nincorporating economic factors, and will submit to ADB for review and comment a report on the \nproposed toll structure and rates prior to the final implementation of the toll rate. GCD will seek \nADB\u2019s comments before implementing any application for toll adjustment during the first 5 years \nof operation. \n \n62. \nFinancial Ratios. GCD will ensure that the project company maintain a working ratio of \nnot more than 15% and a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.2, starting from the third \nyear of operation of the project expressway. \n \n63. \nEnvironment.  GCD  will  ensure  that  (i)  the  Project  is  constructed  and  operated  in \naccordance with the Government\u2019s laws and ADB environment procedures and the EIA; (ii) any \nadverse environmental impacts are minimized by the EIA\u2019s mitigating measures and monitoring \nprogram;  and  (iii)  implementation  of  the  environmental  monitoring  plan,  including  any  violation \nand remedies to the negative environmental impacts is reported to ADB. GCD and the Regional \nEnvironmental  Protection  Bureau  will  cooperate  in  controlling  vehicle  emissions  on  the  project \nexpressway  and  the  local  roads.  GCD  will  submit  to  ADB  the  Government-prescribed  vehicle \nemission  regulation  limits,  penalties,  and  a  plan  before  commercial  operation  of  the  project \nfacilities. \n \n64. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  GCD  will  implement  the  RP  and  RF,  including \nland acquisition, in accordance with their terms, in a timely manner, and in accordance with all \napplicable  Government  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement, \nand  (i)  ensure  compensation  and  assistance  are  given  to  the  affected  people  prior  to \ndispossession and displacement to ensure that they will be as well as they would have been in \nthe absence of the Project; (ii) engage an independent agency acceptable to ADB to carry out \nM&E,  and  forward  progress  reports  to  ADB;  (iii)  maintain  records  of  consultation  and \ngrievances;  (iv)  ensure  that  civil  works  contracts  include  requirements  to  comply  with  the  RP; \nand (v) submit an updated RP or RF to ADB after a detailed measurement survey. \n \n65. \nEthnic  Minorities.

However,  it  is  still \nunderdeveloped  in  quality  and  extent.  High  standard  roads,  expressways,  and  class-1  and \nclass-2 highways account for only 15% of the total network. The remaining 85% are medium- to \nlow-grade  paved  roads  and  gravel  roads.  In  Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous  Region  (Guangxi), \nthe total length of the road network was 56,300 km, of which high-standard roads accounted for \n6,044 km (11%) in 2003. At the end of 2003, the total length of expressways exceeded 1,000 \nkm,  while  the  length  of  the  road  network  grew  by  3.8%  annually  during  1990\u20132003.  The  road \nquality is poor in general. Class IV and unclassified roads account for 75% of the network.  \n \nB. \n \nIn 2003 the PRC vehicle fleet consisted of over 24.2 million trucks, cars, and buses (12.4 \n2. \nmillion privately owned), and over 72.3 million other motorized vehicles, mainly motorcycles and \nagricultural  vehicles.  The  privately  owned  motor  vehicle  fleet  increased  more  than  40  times \nduring 1985\u20132003, from 300,000 to 12.4 million vehicles. Despite this rapid increase, there are \nonly about 1.3 vehicles per 100 persons, a ratio that is lower than that in many other Asian and \nPacific  countries.1 The  PRC\u2019s  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  in  December  2001 \nreduced  the  cost  of  imported  vehicles,  increased  investment  in  automobile  production,  and \nmade  automotive  financing  more  readily  available.  The  modernization  of  the  vehicle  fleet  will \nimprove  vehicle  safety,  and  reduce  fuel  consumption  and  vehicle  emissions.  In  2003,  the \nnumber  of  vehicles  grew  rapidly  in  Guangxi.  At  the  end  of  2003,  the  total  number  of  vehicles \nexceeded  403,000,  an  increase  of  14%  over  2002.  The  number  of  private  vehicles  totaled \n166,800 units, about 27% higher than in 2002, and is expected to continue growing rapidly. \n \n3. \nIn the PRC, road passenger volume and passenger-km account for 92.3% and 55.7%, \nrespectively,  of  all  transport  modes,  while  road  freight  and  freight  km  account  for  74.3%  and \n13.2%, respectively. Road traffic in Guangxi has increased rapidly. In 2003, the passenger traffic \nexceeded 426 million persons, while freight traffic reached 245 million tons. Roads account for \n92% of passenger trips and 73% of freight lifted. \n \nC. \n \nIn 2003, about 900,000 buses were in operation in the PRC compared with 764,000 in \n4. \n2002. The number of bus routes reached 85,000 to serve more than 94% of villages accessible \nby  road.  In  Guangxi,  the  number  of  vehicles  for  public  transport  services  reached  34,000  in \n2003. Of these, 10,300 passenger vehicles with 148,700 seats and 63,700 freight vehicles with \n191,700 tons capacity were owned by private transport service providers. There were 128,000 \npublic  transport  service  businesses,  employing  a  total  of  384,900  people.  In  2003,  230  long-\ndistance passenger bus stations and 115 freight transport stations served 4,230 long-distance \npassenger  transport  routes  in  Guangxi,  covering  1,381  townships  and  11,679  villages.  \nThere were also 14,172 vehicle and motorcycle repair shops, and 105 driver training schools.  \n \n5. \nIn  May  2001,  a  cross-border  tourist  bus  service  was  opened  between  Dongxin  City  in \nGuangxi and Mangjie City in Viet Nam. In September 2001, The Governments agreed to issue \n1,200  licenses  to  the  PRC  and  Viet  Nam  freight  trucks  for  cross-border  transportation.  It  was \n\nRoad Transport Services \n\n                                                 \n1  Figures for other countries are 59.6 for Australia, 2.5 for India, 5.0 for Indonesia, and 65.3 for Japan. \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nRoad Administration \n\nRoad Sector Revenues and Expenditures \n\nalso agreed that regular passenger bus services be opened between Nanning and Xialong (in \nViet Nam), and between Beihai and Xialong.  \n \nD. \n \n6. \nRoad administration in the PRC is decentralized. At the provincial and autonomous level, \ncommunications  departments  (CDs)  are  responsible  for  highway  network  development  and \nmaintenance.  Generally  they  are  financially  independent  of  the  Government,  except  for  large \nprojects of national significance. The Ministry of Communications (MOC) provides guidance and \nsupport  to  CDs  through  national  policies,  regulations,  and  standards.  Provincial  and  regional \nplanning  commissions  approve  development  plans  and  projects.  Road  safety  and  annual \nvehicle testing are under the Ministry of Public Security at national and local levels. Inspection of \nvehicle emissions is the responsibility of local environmental protection bureaus in collaboration \nwith provincial public security bureaus. Road sector agencies are generally well staffed. In the \ntransport sector, executing agencies have been making good use of the knowledge transfer and \nin-country  and  external  training  opportunities  provided  under  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nprojects.2 Road transport efficiency and quality are improving, and ADB supported this process.3 \n \nE. \n \n7. \nThe  PRC's  road  investment  needs  from  1996  to  2010  are  estimated  at  $504  billion. \nAvailable  revenues  are  estimated  at  $302  billion  from  road-user  charges,  and  $29  billion  from \ntoll collections, leaving a financing gap of $173 billion or about $12 billion per year. Consistent \nwith  ADB's  policy  dialogue,  the  Government  is  creating  a  framework  to  attract  private  sector \nfinance for road construction. While the private sector is interested in financing the high-grade \nand  provincial  road  networks  under  concession  agreements  under  certain  circumstances,  its \ncontribution to build-operate-transfer projects is hindered by the initial risks of construction and \ntraffic  demand.  Expenditures  for  highway  infrastructure  are  financed  from  dedicated-user \ncharges,  central  Government  grants,  domestic  bank  loans  and  bonds,  and  foreign  loans  and \ninvestments.  MOC  provided  supplementary  financing  of  about  2%  of  the  requirements  to \nconstruct or rehabilitate rural roads in poor areas. Domestic loans were low, accounting for 9% \nof all highway investments. Based on the findings of ADB-financed technical assistance  (TA),4 \nthe  fuel  tax  is  likely  to  improve  financing  of  the  road  sector.  Foreign  loans  covered  8%  of \ninvestment  in  highway  construction,  and  foreign  direct  investment  the  remaining  3%,  mainly \nfrom ADB, Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and World Bank. \n \nF. \n \n8. \nRoad  projects  are  designed  by  planning  and  design  institutes  at  the  provincial, \nprefecture, and county levels which are staffed with experienced, well-qualified personnel. MOC \nreviews  the  designs  of  expressways,  high-standard  roads,  and  associated  structures,  and \nimplements  measures  to  enhance  quality  control  and  inspection  regime.  The  city  and  county \nhighway  bureaus  have  their  own  construction  units  to  carry  out  minor  projects  within  their \nadministrative  districts.  Drawing  on  experience  gained  under  projects  financed  by  ADB  and \nWorld Bank, the 1999 Tendering and Bidding Law5 mandated competitive bidding practices.  \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1998.

currently  applies  a  road \n1. \nmaintenance  scheme,  called  \u201cunified \nthe  Guangxi \nCommunications  Department  (GCD)  develops  and  implements  sector  management  plans, \npolicies  and  regulations,  and  the  local  highway  administration  bureau  (LHAB)  and  local \ncommunication bureau (LCB)1  at prefecture and county levels implement the road maintenance \nplan according to GCD policies and regulations (Table A4). \n \nB. \n\nleadership  management.\u201d  That \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\nis \n\n2. \nUnder the GCD, several departments are responsible for road maintenance: (i) planning \nadministration  divisions:  responsible  for  making  the  road  maintenance  plan,  budgeting,  and \ncapacity building and staff training for all roads; (ii) Expressway Administration Bureau (GEAB): \nresponsible  for  expressways  maintenance  and  employing  a  staff  of  284;  (iii)  Highway \nAdministration Bureau (GHAB): responsible for maintaining national and provincial highways and \npart  of  county  roads,  and  employing  over  20,000  staff;  and  (iv)  local  communication \nadministration bureaus (CAB): responsible for rural road maintenance, including part of county \nroads  (with  light  traffic)  and  township  and  village  roads.  In  addition,  township  governments \nparticipate  in  local  road  maintenance  with  technical  support  from  the  county  local  CAB.  Some \ncorporatized expressways and highways are maintained by their companies. Village roads are \nmaintained by villagers. \n \n3. \nFor expressways and tolled highways, the fund source for maintenance is the toll revenue.   \nFor nontolled highways and roads, the source is mainly the road maintenance fee. Maintenance \nworker teams for routine maintenance such as surface cleaning and minor pavement repairs are \nrecruited  by  GEAB  and  GHAB  at  the  rate  of  one  worker  per  2  km  of  road.  For  periodic \nmaintenance, external construction companies are recruited through public bidding. At prefecture \nand county levels, the local CAB is responsible for routine maintenance, while major maintenance \nprograms  are  directly  managed  by  GHAB.  A  township  government  directly  carries  out \nmaintenance  of  township  roads  with  support  from  the  county  CAB.  Most  villagers  themselves \nmaintain  the  village  roads.  The  beneficiaries  maintain  some  special  roads,  which  connect \nfactories and other activities. \n \n\nTable A4: Road Maintenance Framework in Guangxi\u20132003 \n\n \nExpressway \n1,000 km \n\nNational \nHighway \n\nProvincial \nRoad \n\nCounty Road \n\nTownship \nRoad \n\nVillage \nRoad \n\n4,968 km \n\n5,488 km \n\n20,444 km \n\n24,427 km \n\n \n\nResponsibility \n\nGHAB \n \n\nGHAB \n \n\nGHAB \n\nGHAB \nLCB \n\nLCB \n\nVillage \n\n \n\n \nItem \nLength   \n\nBudget \n\n$25,000 per \nkm (R), and \n$55,000 per \nkm (P) \n\nRMB9,000 per \nkm(R), and \nRMB 90,000 \nper km (P)   \n\nRMB9,000 per \nkm(R), and \nRMB 90,000 \nper km (P)   \n\nRMB100 million \nfor all roads, \nincluding \ntownships \n\n \n\nVillager \nresources \n\nFund Source \n\nToll \n\nToll, \nmaintenance \nfee \n\nToll, \nmaintenance \nfee \n\nMaintenance \nFee \n\nMaintenance \nfee \n\nVillager \nresources \n\nGood   \n\nEquipment \nConditions \nGHAB = Guangxi Highway Administration Bureau, km = kilometer, LCB = local communication bureau, P = periodic \nmaintenance, R = routine maintenance. \n\nModerate/Poor  Poor \n\nGood \n/Moderate \n\nVery poor \n\nNone \n\n                                                 \n1  Local highway administration bureaus and communication bureaus are functioning agencies of local governments. \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n  33\n\nC. \n\nIssues in Road Maintenance \n\ninclude \n\nin  Guangxi \n\nroad  maintenance \n\nCurrent  obstacles  of \n\n4. \n(i)  maintenance \nplanning\u2014Road  maintenance  planning  is  comparatively  weak  due  to  the  need  for  the  road \nstructure itself. As a result, the nonincome-generating roads (no toll) particularly rural roads suffer \nfrom  lack  of  maintenance  and  resources;  (ii)  insufficient  fund;  (iii)  need  for  more  basic  and \nadvance  equipment;  (iv)  lack  of  skilled  maintenance  staff\u2014The  problem  is  that  engineers  and \ntechnicians consider working in maintenance divisions poor for their career prospects and prefer \nto work in design or construction offices; therefore careers in maintenance must be made more \nattractive  in  order  to  attract  high-quality  trained  staff;  (v)  lack  of  knowledge  of  maintenance \ntechniques; (vi) unavailability of appropriate software, which is essential to improve productivity \nand efficiency and to overcome the issue of scarce resources; (vii) the problem of overloaded \nvehicles, which has caused very serious damage to roads and has sharply increased the need for \nroad maintenance.   \n \nD. \n\nAsset Management and Road Maintenance Program of the Project \n\n5. \nTo overcome the current obstacles of road maintenance, attract staff to work in the area, \nand ensure project sustainability, GCD will operate the project expressway and local roads using \na cost-effective asset management strategy.     \n \n6. \n \n\nThe Project will procure equipment and strengthen local capacity ($7.5 million) as follows: \n\nEquipment  (a)  Asphalt  mixture  equipment,  pavement  maintenance  equipment, \nand  multipurpose  trucks;  (b)  pavement  management  system,  including  data \ncollection devices, geographical information system and software; (c) overloaded \nvehicle inspection systems; and (d) emergency and safety equipment. \n\nCapacity  building  and  training  (a)  Strengthen  the  capacity  of  Guangxi \nCommunications College (GCC) through training and office equipment, software, \nand  educational  materials;  (b)  establish  an  ongoing  GCC  training  program  to \nenhance  staff  skills;  and  (c)  provide  6  person-months  of  overseas  training  to \nstrengthen staff capacity and adopt best practice. \n\nInternational  consultants. Provide 3 person-months of short-term international \nconsultants to enhance local capacity.   \n\nTeam leader. With the help of the team leader/international consultant, develop a \nsustainable  maintenance  system,  including  budget  plan,  staff  development \nprogram,  monitoring  system  to  efficiently  manage  assets  and  provide  steady \noperation of the expressway and local roads, following project completion. \n\nAdministration  and  staffing.  Following  project  opening,  GCD,  GHAB,  and  the \nLCB  will  implement  the  asset  management  and  maintenance  strategy  in \naccordance with GCD policies and regulations; and will ensure the availability of \nappropriate staff. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\nBudget.  Under  the  leadership  of  GCD,  an  ongoing  maintenance  budget  will  be \nprovided  to  ensure  steady  operation  of  the  expressway  and  local  roads  after \nproject opening. The government maintenance fees will support maintenance of \nthe local roads and the toll revenue will support maintenance of the expressway.   \n\n \n(vii)  Corporatization.  GCD,  in  consultation  with  the  ADB,  will  create  a  regime,  to \nensure  implementation  of  the  asset  management  and  maintenance  strategy \nfollowing the establishment of the project company. \n\n\f34\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nTRANSPORT SERVICES ACTION PLAN \n \n\nGeneral \n\nA. \n \nThere is a wide range of transport services within the project area for three main modes: \n1. \nroad, rail, and inland waterway. Each mode plays a different role, with only limited competition \nbetween  them.  Inland  waterways  are  suitable  for  low-value  bulk  commodities,  the  transport  of \nwhich  is  not  time  sensitive,  e.g.,  building  materials,  and  bulk  fuels.  While  passenger  services \nhave  been  operated,  the  slow  transit  times  mean  that  usage  is  low  and  declining.  \nRail services are most suitable for the movement of bulk commodities between a limited number \nof destinations. The railway also carries substantial numbers of passengers to a limited number \nof  destinations  and  at  low  frequencies.  Rail  flows  are  estimated  at  1.3\u20131.5  million  passengers \nper year and 4\u20135 million tons of freight, both well within the capacity of the system. Roads carry \nabout 12 million passengers per year and about 8\u201310 million tons of freight. Formal and informal \nbus  and  other  services  provide  a  wide  range  of  passenger  services.  Roads  also  cater  to  the \nrapidly  increasing  numbers  of  private  vehicle  trips,  reflecting  the  substantial  growth  in  vehicle \nownership  in  the  area  and  in  the  country  as  a  whole.  Typically,  private  vehicles  represent \ncomplex and dispersed trip patterns, for which rail and inland waterways would not be suitable. \nTraffic  and  social  surveys  of  the  project  TA  have  revealed  that  improvement  of  roads  and \ntransport services is the second need of the rural population, after food or income increase. \n \n2. \nA similar situation is true of freight, where bulk cargoes are largely carried by rail and, to \na  lesser  extent,  by  inland  waterways;  and  general  cargoes  are  increasingly  carried  by  road. \nRoad transport offers faster transit times, door-to-door services, greater security, and the ability \nto provide direct transit without the need for intermediate intermodal transshipment. As a result, \nroad transport is more able to cater to high-value, time-sensitive, and dispersed movements of \nfreight, a category of traffic that is growing rapidly with economic development and the People's \nRepublic  of  China's  (PRC\u2019s)  transition  to  a  market  economy.  The  patterns  of  traffic  are \nsummarized in Table A5.1. \n \n\n \nFreight Traffic in \nthe Project Corridor \n(vehicle/day) \n\nTable A5.1: Current Traffic Patterns Within the G324 Corridor (2003) \n(excluding short-distance tripsa) \n \nPassenger Traffic \n(Buses and Cars) \nin the Project \nCorridor \n(vehicle/day) \n4700 \n\n \n \n \n \nItem \nTotal Movements  \nWithin 5 Key Counties of Expressway \nCorridor \nWithin the PA \n \n \nTrips between Nanning and Guangxi \nTrips between Yunnan, Guizhou, and  \n  Guangdong provinces \nGuangxi = Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, km = kilometer, PA = project area.  \na  Short distance = less than 10 km. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n2,010 \n3,460 \n \n740 \n500 \n\n2,250 \n3,750 \n \n990 \n1885 \n\n43% \n74% \n \n16% \n11% \n\nTotal Local Trips \n\n1,500 \n\n1,450 \n\n31% \n\n6625 \n\n23% \n\n34% \n57% \n \n15% \n29% \n\n \n3. \nThe  development  of  the  project  roads  will  allow  formal  and  informal  public  transport \nservices to access a higher proportion of the main activity centers and rural areas where many \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5  \n\n35\n\nTransport Services Program of the Project \n\nof the poor live, and will encourage development of better linkages with employment and other \nopportunities.  The  project  area  also  contains  a  range  of  important  tourist  facilities  and  their \ncontinued  development  depends  on  improving  accessibility  that  will  be  possible  with \nexpressway and local roads development. \n \nB. \n \n4. \ntransport services in the project area, through improved competition and transport cost savings.    \nThe opportunities for public transport are likely to include the following: \n \n \n\nConstruction of the expressway and the local roads will provide opportunities for better \n\nuse of the expressway for long-distance public transport services traveling the full \nlength  of  the  route  between  Nanning  and  Baise,  or  to  shorten  the  distance  for \npublic transport services connecting to the major centers along the route; \n\n(i) \n\nuse  of  the  G324  for  enhanced  local  public  transport  services  following  the \ndiversion of traffic to the expressway; and  \n\nuse  of  the  upgraded  local  roads  to  provide  enhanced  local  public  transport \nservices between the main centers to villages at more remote locations. \n\n5. \nMuch  of  the  public  transport  industry  in  the  area  is  in  the  hands  of  private  sector \noperators, who operate services without a subsidy. To ensure that the best use is made of the \nopportunities that become available, the following approaches are proposed, to encourage and \nfacilitate the provision of public transport and freight services. \n \n\nIdentify  clearly  the  benefits  for  public  transport  and  freight  operations  likely  to \narise from the construction of the expressway and the local roads program, and \npresent  these  to  representatives  of  the  local  communities,  stakeholders,  and  to \npotential operators of both formal and informal transport services. \n\nBased on the discussions, invite operators and other interested parties to define \nwhat  new  services  may  be  operated,  and  what  additional  infrastructure  and \nfacilities  need  to  be  provided  or  facilitated  by  the  public  sector.  These  may,  for \nexample, include the expansion of existing terminal facilities in the major centers, \nand provision of simple terminals in towns and villages getting new services. \n\nAssess  the potential  role  of  roadside  stations  to  ensure  that  the  design  of  such \nfacilities can accommodate the need of the local community and stakeholders. \n\nBefore the expressway and local roads are opened, review the potential service \nprovision with operators. \n\nEnsure that there is public awareness of the opportunities offered by these new \nservices and, in conjunction with the operators, mount a publicity campaign. \n\n \n6. \nA  transport  services  action  plan  covering  areas  to  be  served  by  the  expressway  and \nlocal  roads  is  in  Table  A5.2.  The  objective  of  the  plan  is  to  maximize  the  project  benefits  and \nprovide better service to the local community. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n\fTable A5.2: Transport Services Action Plan \n\nDescription \n\nResponsibility \n\nMunicipal and \ncounty transport \nbureaus \n\nTransport \nOperators Involved \nCommercial transport \nservice companies \nand private sector \n\nTiming \n\n2007 \nonward \n\n36\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\nActivity \n\nLocal shuttle \nbuses on the \nexpressway \n \n \n \n \nRoadside \nstations \n \n \n \n \n\nRoad network \nimprovements \n\nNew bus and \nfreight stations, \nand facilities  \n\nNew bus routes \nin rural areas \n\nIndustry \ncompetition, \nregulation, and \npromotion \n\nOver 150 shuttle buses, newly \noperated or shifted from the \ncurrent G324 road, will operate \non the project roads, to connect \nall county centers with main \ncities and other provinces. \n\nFour service areas and four \nparking areas will be \nconstructed on the project \nexpressway.

An inevitable problem is the incidence and severity of road accidents. If the \npresent trend of one death every 5 minutes due to road accidents is not arrested in the People's \nRepublic  of China  (PRC),  the  number  of  deaths  will  rise  to over  200,000  per  annum  by  2010, \nthe number of injuries will double to more than a million, and the costs will exceed $12.5 billion \nper  annum,  creating  a  huge  burden  on  the  socioeconomic  development  programs  of  the \nGovernment  and  community.  Many  problems  encountered  with  road  safety  are  predominantly \ninstitutional  in  nature\u2014fragmentation  of  responsibility,  lack  of  interdepartmental  coordination, \nand  inadequate  strategy.  To  help  improve  road  safety,  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA) \napproved  in  1999 1  helped  a  national  program  to  tackle  safety  problems.  The  Government \nintroduced  a  new  road  safety  law  in  May  2004.  Road  safety  is  a  major  concern  in  Guangxi \nZhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi) and in the project area. The problem will get worse as \ncongestion increases (Supplementary Appendix C). \n \nB. \n\nNeed for an Integrated Approach \n\n2. \nThe  two  key  agencies  concerned  with  road  safety  and  enforcement  on  the  existing \nexpressways  in  Guangxi  are  the  Traffic  Police  Expressway  Branch  of  the  Traffic  Police  of \nGuangxi  Public  Security  Bureau  (GPSB),  the  lead  agency,  and  Guangxi  Communications \nDepartment  (GCD).  However,  promoting  road  safety  is  essentially  a  multidimensional  activity, \nand  there  is  a  need  to  consider  the  role  of  other  agencies.  The  following  integrated  approach \nwill  be  adopted  in  the  project  area.  The  objective  is  to  minimize  the  incidence  and  severity  of \nroad accidents and maximize the benefits to the community. \n \n\nTable A6: Road Safety and Traffic Enforcement Action Plan for the Project \n \n\nItem \nInstitution  \n\nAgency \n\nGuangxi Public \nSecurity Bureau \n(GPSB), and \nGuangxi \nCommunications \nDepartment \n(GCD) \n \n\n \n\n \n\nEngineering \n\nGCD \nCounties \nGPSB \n \n\nPre-Accident \n\n\u2022 Strengthen role of Guangxi Zhuang \n\nAutonomous Region (Guangxi) \ninteragency road safety committee. \n\u2022 Develop strategy / policy, monitoring \n\nsystem, and ensure skills and resources \navailability, with the help of the \ninternational consultants. \n\n\u2022 Involve relevant stakeholders. \n\u2022 Fulfill requirements of the 2004 road safety \nlaw, and United Nations (UN) standards. \n\n\u2022 Illustrate the magnitude of the safety \n\n \n\nproblem to ensure a high level of interest. \n\u2022 Promote safety-conscious design of roads, \nincluding road safety audit and black spot \nand maintenance plans. \n\n\u2022 Provide sign, signal, marks, safety \n\ndevices, and design speed. \n\n\u2022 Maintain traffic surveillance center, \n\nAccident \n\nInvestigate \nmajor accident \ncauses. \n \n \n\nPost-Accident \n\n\u2022 Monitor trends. \n\u2022 Provide guidance \nand standards. \n\n\u2022 Assess causes and \nprovide prevention \nmeasures. \n\n\u2022 Foster knowledge. \n\u2022 Asses effectiveness \n\nagainst targets. \n\nSet up \nprotective \nroadside \nobject. \n \n\n\u2022 Provide rescue \n\nfacilities. \n\u2022 Alleviate \n\ncongestion. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  1999.

Initial  traffic  forecasts  for  the  expressway,  based  on  surveys  in  2000,  were \nreviewed during the project TA and suggestions were made to refine the modelling. As a result, \nadditional surveys were undertaken in November 2003, and revised forecasts were produced for \nthe period up to 2026, (Figure A11.1). \n \n \n\nFigure A11.1: Observed and Forecast Traffic in the Corridor (PCU) \n \n\n40,000 \n \n\n35,000 \n\n30,000 \n\n25,000 \n\n20,000 \n\n15,000 \n\n10,000 \n\n5,000 \n\n0\n\n1970 \n\n1980\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n2020 \n\n2030\n\nObserved Flows \n\nForecast Flows\n\nPCU = passenger car unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \nTraffic on the project expressway was forecast to be 10,724 passenger car unit (PCU) in \n2007 and 47,056 PCU Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) in 2026 (Table A11). According to the \nstandards for expressways (25,000\u201355,000 PCU AADT) of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nthe 4-lane expressway will meet the requirements of that traffic level. This project expressway will \nhave  sufficient  and  sustainable  traffic  suitable  for  the  expressway  engineering  design  and  toll \nrevenue generation. \n \nThe  flows  in  the  corridor  have  also  been  compared  with  the  forecast  economic  growth \n3. \n(Figure A11.2). The forecast traffic flows in the corridor as a whole are below the rate of economic \ngrowth, but both display a generally similar pattern over time, except for the initial period when the \nconstruction  of  the  expressway  leads  to  high  initial  growth  over  the  period  to  2010.  \nThe growth of expressway traffic is generally higher than that for the corridor as a whole, because \nof the shortage of capacity on the G324. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11    45\n\nTable A11: Traffic Forecasts\u2014Average Annual Daily Traffic (PCU) \n\n \nRoad Corridor Traffic \n   \n\nG324 Traffic \nPassenger  \nFreight  \nG324 Total  \nAnnual Growth Rate (%)  \n\nActual \n2003 \n\n4,720 \n4,964 \n12,170 \n\nSubtotal (diverted from G324) \n\nThe Proposed Expressway  \npassengers (diverted from G324) \nFreight (diverted from G324) \n \nPassenger (additional)  \nFreight (Additional) \n \nExpressway Total \nAnnual Growth Rate (%)  \nTotal Road Corridor  \nAnnual Growth Rate (%)  \nForecast Real GDP (%) \n\nSubtotal (Additional) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n\n12,170 \n \n12.25 \n\n2007 \n\n2010 \n\n2020 \n\n2026 \n\nForecast \n2015 \n\n1,698 \n3,230 \n4,928 \n\n(20.23) \n\n4,906 \n4,730 \n9,636 \n56 \n1,032 \n1,088 \n10,724 \n\n15,692 \n6.60 \n10.25 \n\n1,864 \n3,688 \n5,554 \n\n4.07 \n\n5,984 \n6,430 \n12,412 \n682 \n1,376 \n2,058 \n14,470 \n10.50 \n\n20,074 \n8.60 \n10.25 \n\n2,324 \n4,848 \n7,172 \n\n5.25 \n\n7,290 \n7,648 \n14,938 \n2,770 \n3,638 \n6,408 \n21,346 \n8.10 \n\n28,588 \n7.30 \n8.75 \n\n2,964 \n6,426 \n9,390 \n\n5.54 \n\n9,398 \n9,512 \n18,910 \n5,952 \n6,934 \n12,886 \n31,796 \n8.30 \n\n41,288 \n7.60 \n8.75 \n\n3,500 \n7,420 \n10,920 \n\n2.55 \n\n12,340 \n12,334 \n24,674 \n10,976 \n11,406 \n22,382 \n47,056 \n6.80 \n\n58,120 \n5.90 \n7.75 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, NH = national highway, PCU = passenger car unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n\nFigure A11.2: Forecast of Economic and Traffic Growth \n\n \n\n14 \n\n12 \n\n10 \n\n8 \n\n6 \n\n4 \n\n2 \n\n0 \n\n \n)\n\n%\n\n \n\n(\n \ne\nt\na\nR\nh\nt\nw\no\nr\nG\n\n \nl\na\nu\nn\nn\nA\n\n2000 \n\n2005 \n\n2010\n\n2015\n\n2020\n\n2025 \n\n2030\n\n Expressway Annual Traffic Growth Rate (%)  \n  Forecast Growth in Real GDP (%) \n\n Corridor Annual Traffic Growth Rate (%)  \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n\f46\n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n\nincludes \n\nCost.  For \n\nExpressway Component \n\nthe  economic  evaluation, \n\nthe  expressway  component \n\n1. \nThe  Project  comprises  the  expressway  from  Nanning  (Tanluo)  to  Baise  and  the  local \nroad connected to the expressway through the road network system. The main civil works of the \nexpressway will be executed in 3 years and the economic analysis covers that period and the \nfollowing 21 years of operation. The expressway\u2019s economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was \nestimated by comparing the situations with and without the new road. Without the Project, the \nexisting  road  network  will  become  congested  because  of  rapidly  increasing  traffic  and  some \ntrips  will  be  suppressed.  The  Project  will  reduce  congestion;  offer  faster,  cheaper,  and  safer \ntravel; and allow additional trip making. The analysis has been undertaken for each component \nof the Project and for the whole Project, using 2003/04 prices. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nthe \nconstruction of the expressway itself and construction of the connecting roads. The costs of the \nexpressway include (i) capital costs: physical contingencies, costs of land acquisition, costs of \nenvironmental  mitigating  measures,  and  compensation  or  relocation  of  affected  people;  and  \n(ii) costs of operating and maintaining the expressway. \n \nBenefit.  The  economic  benefits  include  (i)  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs) \n3. \nresulting  from  shorter  travel  time  and  improved  traffic  conditions,  (ii)  savings  in  the  value  of \npassenger time, (iii) savings resulting from fewer accidents, and (iv) benefits to generated traffic. \nIn addition there will be environmental benefits from reduced vehicle emissions and noise, and \nindirect  economic  benefits  resulting  from  increased  in  economic  growth  in  the  corridor \ngenerated  by  the  new  road.  However,  these  indirect  benefits  were  not  been  included  in  the \nanalysis for lack of a suitable evaluation methodology. The main source of economic benefits is \nthe  reduced  VOCs.  The  new  road  shortens  the  route  between  Nanning  and  Baise  by  \n14 kilometers (kms) and provides better operating conditions. Traffic diverted to the expressway \nwill enjoy higher speeds on a smoother road, with better vertical and horizontal alignment, less \ncongestion, and a shorter through distance; and will gain substantial benefits. All these changes \naffect  VOCs\u2014which  were  estimated  using \nthe  standard  Highway  Development  and \nManagement  System  (HDM)  VOC  estimation  techniques\u2014and  the  savings  were  then \nincorporated  into  the  economic  evaluation.  The  other  main  sources  of  economic  benefits  are \ntime savings, accident savings and the benefits to generated traffic. The value of time savings \nhas  been  determined  based  on  the  reduction  in  journey  times  and  the  value  of  time  of \npassengers traveling in and through the corridor, taking into account the characteristics of these \ntravelers. Accident cost savings were based in part on an analysis of national and local accident \nstatistics  for  2002.  The  unit  costs  of  accidents  are  based  on  a  review  of  the  severity  of \naccidents, taking into account damage to property and the value of output lost. \n \n4. \nBenefits  to  the  additional  traffic  attracted  to  the  corridor  were  estimated  by  calculating \nthe  generalized  cost  savings  for  traffic  using  the  expressway  in  each  forecast  year  and  then \nattributing 50% of this change in costs to the increases in traffic over the level that would exist if \nthe expressway was not constructed. The evaluation also accounts for the time taken for the full \nlevel of demand on the expressway to be achieved, as travelers adjust their travel behavior to \ntake advantage of the new opportunities that become available. This is reflected in the analysis \nby assuming that only 50% of the full forecast benefits are achieved in the first year (2008) of \noperation and 85% in the second (2009). \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n47\n\nLocal Roads \n\nThe  EIRR  for  the  expressway  component  is  estimated  at  17.1%,  indicating  that  the \n5. \nproject is economically viable, with a net present value of CNY2.5 billion. Of the total benefits, \n59% are savings in VOC; 21%, savings in passenger time costs; 2%, accident cost savings; and \n17%, benefits from generated traffic. Sensitivity analyses confirm the robustness of the Project\u2019s \neconomic viability. \n \nB. \n \nTo extend the potential benefits of the expressway to a wider area, upgrading of a range \n6. \nof intercounty roads was investigated. Following this review, one route of 250 km linking Baise \nand  Napo  to  the  Viet  Nam  border  was  selected  for  inclusion  in  the  overall  project.  This  route \nwould  extend  the  potential  catchment  area  of  the  expressway  and  would  bring  the  benefits  of \nthe  higher  levels  of  economic  activity  in  the  expressway  corridor  to  a  wider  section  of  the \npopulation especially those living in poor isolated areas between the corridor and the Vietnam \nborder. The project would also enhance the accessibility of the border areas and help stimulate \ncross-border  trade  with  Vietnam  currently  about  $500  million  per  year  between  Guangxi  and \nVietnam  and  growing  strongly.  The  cost  of  this  road  is  estimated  at  about  CNY220  million  in \n2003/04 prices. This part of the Project will upgrade an existing unsealed road and will directly \nserve  a  poor  and  isolated  community.  Quantified  benefits  include  the  changes  in  VOCs  and \ntravel times with the new road, accident savings, and benefits to generated traffic. This analysis \ngave  an  EIRR  of  about  17%,  with  a  net  present  value  of  about  CNY90  million.  However  it  is \nlikely that substantial benefits are offered by the enhanced mobility and opportunities for cross \nBorder activity, but are not captured in the quantified analysis. \n \nThe  final  component  of  the  local  roads  is  the  provision  of  500  km  of  all-weather \n7. \nmotorable  roads  to  poor  minority  villages  currently  without  vehicular  access.  The  costs  of  this \nroad  upgrading  are  estimated  at  about  CNY75  million.  The  results  of  the  social  and  poverty \nassessment surveys indicated substantial differences in income between villages served only by \nearth  paths  and  those  with  graveled  road  access.  The  evaluation  was  therefore  based  on  the \ndifference  in  incomes  after  making  allowance  for  the  additional  costs  of  the  inputs  required  to \nachieve them. The EIRR for these roads is estimated at between 32% and 95%, depending on \nwhether  the  evaluation  is  based  on  the  increase  in  net  agricultural  incomes  or  in  net  total \nincomes.  Central  values  have  been  used  in  the  overall  appraisal,  but  even  on  the  lower \nestimates, the benefits are very large. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nBased  on  the  combined  economic  cash  flows  from  2005  to  2028,  the  Project  as  a \nwhole\u2014the 188 km expressway, 250 km of intercounty road upgrading, and 500 km of minority \nvillage roads\u2014will generate an EIRR of 17.8% (Supplementary Appendix I). The benefits of the \nlocal  roads  component,  while  critically  important  to  the  areas  served,  are  minor,  reflecting  the \nmodest share of investment in them (Table A12.1). \n \n9. \nThe sensitivity analysis of the results for the expressway confirms the robustness of its \neconomic  viability.  Changes  in  the  key  variables  have  no  significant  effect  (Table  A12.2).  \nThe  capital  cost  would  have  to  be  more  than  65%  higher  than  estimated  for  the  EIRR  to  fall \nbelow the cutoff rate of 12%. Considering the experience of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nin People's Republic of China (PRC), such an increase in capital cost is unlikely. ADB-financed \nroad  projects  in  the  PRC  have  not  encountered  major  cost  overruns,  and  the  contract  prices \ntend to be lower than estimated because contracting is becoming increasingly competitive. The \neconomic viability of the project and its components can therefore be regarded as very robust. \n\nThe Project as a Whole \n\n \n\n\f48\n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\nYear \n\nExpressway \nCapital and \nOperating \nCosts  \n\nTable A12.1: Economic Evaluation of the Expressway and Local Roads \n  Local Roads\n\n \n\n \nExpressway Costs and Benefits \n\nVOC \nBenefits \n\nThrough \nVOT \nBenefits \n\nGenerated \nTraffic \nBenefits \n\nAccident \nSavings \n\nTotal \nBenefitsa \n\nNet \nBenefits \n\n \n\nNet Benefits \nfor Local \nRoadsb \n\nOverall Net \nBenefits \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n464 \n510 \n562 \n592 \n623 \n657 \n692 \n730 \n774 \n821 \n871 \n925 \n982 \n1041 \n1105 \n1174 \n1249 \n1331 \n1419 \n1508 \n1596 \n4270 \n\n1,371 \n2,032 \n1,676 \n28 \n28 \n28 \n28 \n28 \n28 \n28 \n29 \n131 \n29 \n29 \n29 \n29 \n29 \n187 \n29 \n29 \n30 \n30 \n30 \n(2,763) \n4,055  \n\n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \nNPV at \n12% \n \n \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, VOC = vehicle operating cost, VOT = value of time. \na  The  total  benefits  of  2008  and  2009  are  based  on  para.  4.

Construction  will  be  completed  in  2007.  Domestic  price  inflation  is \nforecast to be 1% in 2004, 2% in 2005, 3% in 2006, 4% for 2007, 3.5% in 2008, and 3% from \n2008 onward. International inflation is estimated at 1% in 2004, 1.53% in 2005, 0.89% in 2006 \nand 2007, 1% in 2008, and 1.5% from 2008 onward. The initial foreign exchange rate for 2004 \nis CNY8.28 per $1. The cost estimates are presented in nominal terms, taking into account both \nthe  potential  impacts  of  domestic  and  international  inflation,  and  potential  exchange  rate \nfluctuations using the assumption of purchasing power parity. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe financial projections include revenues from operating (toll) revenues and other non-\noperating  revenues  primarily  from  advertising  and  rental  income  from  operators  of  fueling \nstations and other services available in the service areas along the expressway. Based on past \nexperiences  of  existing  expressways  in  Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous  Region  (Guangxi),  the \nnet  revenues  from  these  other  activities  are  estimated  at  1  percent  of  total  toll  revenues \ncollected. \n \n3. \nOperating revenues from tolls are projected based on forecast traffic and a base toll rate \nof  CNY0.35  per  passenger  car  per  kilometer  (km).  Corresponding  tolls  for  other  vehicle  types \nare CNY0.35 for a small truck, CNY0.81 for a bus, CNY0.81 for a medium truck, CNY1.97 for a \nlarge truck, and CNY1.97 for a trailer and container truck. The assumed toll rate is forecast to \nincrease every 5 years in normal terms from the opening of the expressway to keep up with the \ninflation  rate  (16%  over  5  years,  or  an  average  of  3%  per  year).  The  proportion  of  exempted \nvehicles  such  as  police,  ambulance,  and  security  and  inspection  cars  is  estimated  at  6%  of \npassenger cars. \n \n4. \nThe  traffic  volume  is  sensitive  to  the  toll  level.  The  diversion  of  traffic  according  to  a \nchange  of  toll  rates  is  estimated  based  on  the  Toll  Diversion  Model  Application  Manual \n(September 2000) developed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and reflected in the traffic \nforecast for the Project.  \n \nDuring the 1\u20132 years of opening a new expressway, not all forecast traffic will appear on \n5. \nthe expressway. To reflect this, a \u201cramp-up\u201d factor of 50% of forecast traffic is estimated for the \nfirst year of operation (2008) and 85% in the second year (2009). \n \nTwo types of taxes are considered in the financial evaluation: business taxes of 5.5% on \n6. \ngross  revenue,  and  corporate  income  tax  at  33%  of  net  profit.  Corporate  income  tax  is  fully \nexempted  during  the  first  2  years  of  operation,  but  will  gradually  be  increased  to  15%  of  net \nprofit during year 3 to year 5. From year 6, a standard 33% will be applied to the corporation. \n \n7. \nThe Project will borrow from two institutions: China Development Bank (CDB) and ADB. \nThe interest rates of CDB and ADB are assumed at 5.76% and 5.48% per annum, respectively. \nThe  loan  term  of  CDB  is  taken  as  a  combination  of  a  4-year  grace  period  and  a  20-year  of \nrepayment  period.  For  the  ADB  loan,  maturity  is  assumed  as  24  years,  for  US  dollar  LIBOR-\nbased loans, including a 4-year grace period. An equity investment of CNY1.222 billion from the \n\n\f50\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nOperation and maintenance (O&M) costs for intercounty and minority village roads have \n\nAssets  are  depreciated  on  a  straight-line  basis  while  the  average  economic  life  varies \n\nMinistry  of  Communications  (MOC)  has  been  firmed  up.  MOC  and  GCD  equity  investment \nunder this Project will account for 35% of the total project cost. \n \n8. \nExpressway operating costs include operation costsand administration costs. Operation \ncosts  are  assumed  to  increase  as  traffic  grows.  Initially,  a  staff  of  240  will  be  hired  for  12 \ntollbooths at an estimated annual salary of CNY10,000. Administration costs are assumed to be \nconstant at CNY85,000 per km per year throughout the evaluation period. These administration \ncosts include two components: (i) office staff and running expenses (CNY75,000 per km); and \n(ii) landscaping, building maintenance, and periodic traffic count surveys (CNY10,000 per km). \n \n9. \nExpressway maintenance may be: routine, medium, or major. Routine maintenance has \nbeen estimated at CNY65,000 per km per year. Medium maintenance is required every 5 years \nat CNY550,000 per km, and major maintenance is required every 10 years at CNY2.18 million \nper km. \n \n10. \nbeen estimated at CNY10,000 and CNY6,000 per km per year, respectively. \n \n11. \nfrom 10 to 40 years.  \n \n12. \nThe  pro  forma  financial  statements  (Appendix  14)  show  that  although  the  expressway \nwill generate enough revenue over  the loan period, the first 2 years (2008\u20132009) will produce \ndeficits.  However,  the  Project  will  generate  sufficient  cash  flow  during  the  2  years.  The  main \nconclusions  are  summarized  as  follows:  (i)  the  project  revenues  are  expected  to  cover  O&M \ncosts, debt servicing, and depreciation in excess of debt servicing, and generate an acceptable \nrate  of  return  on  the  investment  as  adjusted  for  inflation  during  the  project  period;  (ii)  the \nworking  ratio  will  remain  below  15%  from  the  first  year  of  full  operation;  and  (iii)  the  annual \naverage  debt  service  coverage  ratio  will  be  equal  to  more  than  1.2  from  the  third  year  of  full \noperation.  \n \nC. \n \n13.  Major assumptions used for calculating the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) are as \nfollows:  (i)  all  calculations  are  in  2004  constant  prices,  covering  the  period  from  2005\u20132028;  \n(ii)  capital  costs  consist  of  all  capital  expenditures  related  to  the  construction  and  equipment \nassociated  with  the  Project,  but  excludes  price  contingencies  and  financial  charges  during \nconstruction; (iii) operating revenues from toll used in financial projections are adjusted to 2004 \nreal terms; (iv) incremental O&M costs are also adjusted to 2004 real terms; (v) residual value of \nthe assets is computed based on the average economic asset life for different items. \n \n14. \nThe  level  of  the  proposed  toll  rates  shown  in  the  base  case  of  the  financial  and \neconomic  evaluations  gives  financial  and  economic  results  that  are  well  within  the  range  of \nacceptability. We have tested a range of toll rates and the impact on the FIRR and the economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) and plotted these relationships on a graph (Figure A13). The graph \nshows  that  at  100%  of  the  base  toll  rate,  the  after-tax  FIRR  is  just  bout  7%  and  the  EIRR  is \napproximately  17%.  At  higher  toll  rates,  the  EIRR  declines  to  12%  at  between  1.5  and  1.6 \nmultiplier level of the base toll. The FIRR increases slightly at the toll multiplier level of 1.25, and \nthen  declines  at  higher  multipliers.  At  lower  toll  rates,  the  FIRR  declines  and  approaches  the \nweighted average cost of capital (WACC) at about the toll multiplier of 0.5. We consider that the \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n\fbase toll rate incorporated in the analysis results in adequate financial and economic results. If it \nis changed significantly, the values of these evaluations deteriorate. \n \n\nFigure A13: Comparison of EIRR and FIRR\n\nAppendix 13 \n\n51\n\n25%\n\n20%\n\n15%\n\n10%\n\n5%\n\n0%\n\n)\n\n%\n\n(\n \nn\nr\nu\nt\ne\nR\n\n \nf\no\n \ne\nt\na\nR\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\nToll Rate (Proportion of Base Toll Assumption)\n\nEIRR\n\nFIRR\n\nSocial Discount Rate\n\nWACC\n\n \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, WACC = weighted \naverage cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Develoment Bank estimates. \n \n15. \nThe  estimated  WACC,  after-tax,  in  real  terms  was  derived  using  estimated  capital  mix \nand  costs  of  funds.  The  estimated  interest  costs  of  the  loan  funds  were  considered,  while  the \ncost  of  equity  was  assumed  to  be  8%.  Income  tax  was  assumed  at  33%.  Weighted  average \ninternational and domestic inflation were 1.3% and 2.98% per annum respectively. \n \n16. \nThe  FIRR  for  the  Project,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  is  7%.  This  compares \nfavorably with the WACC of 2.7%, also computed at after-tax basis (Table A13.1). The Project is \nconsidered both financially viable and sustainable (Supplementary Appendix G). \n \nD. \n \nFor  the  financial  sensitivity  risk  analysis,  the  six  most  uncertain  factors  that  may  affect \n17. \nthe  financial  evaluation  are  (i)  traffic  growth,  (ii)  toll  charges,  (iii)  total  working  costs,  (iv)  total \ncapital  investment,  (v)  delay  in  opening  the  expressway,  and  (vi)  devaluation  of  the  yuan. \nSensitivity and switching values analysis indicates that the FIRR for the project overall is robust \nunder adverse conditions.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n  Yes \n    No \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n Yes \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC):  \n \nThrough  improved  access  to  external  markets,  and  social  services  for  the  poor,  lower  transport  costs  of  agricultural \ninputs  and  products,  better  interaction  with  other  regions,  and  increased  employment  opportunities  during  and  after \nproject  implementation  due  to  increased  economic  activities  (e.g.,  aluminum  plant  development). The  Project\u2019s  local \nroad  component,  specifically  where  the  isolated  poorest  reside,  will  help  local  people  break  the  transport  bottleneck \nand therefore add economic values to their fruits, vegetables, and livestock; and facilitate the provision of social and \nphysical infrastructure services (e.g., health), which are introduced by various poverty reduction programs.  Both the \nexpressway and local roads will speed up local development, and roadside stations will help facilitate the formation of \nnew growth centers that  will have greater impacts on poverty reduction. Increased revenue from economic activities \npromoted by the project roads will enable the Government to spend more on social services. \n\n \n\nPoverty Classification: Other \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nOf the 17 project counties, 16 are either national or provincial poor counties in the project area (PA). The causes of \npoverty  in  the  PA  are  lack  of  access  to  outside  markets  and  unemployment  due  to  remoteness  and  isolation. \nInsufficient  infrastructure  (e.g.,  roads)  and  an  unfavorable  environment  (e.g.,  being  drought  prone  in  stony \nmountainous  areas)  worsen  the  poverty  situation.  Rural  poverty  in  the  PA,  measured  as  per  capita  income  below \nCNY900, affects 2.3 million people (46% of the rural population). Absolute poverty (<CNY625) affects a population of \n0.57 million (12%). Food security has generally been achieved due to favorable climatic conditions and technical and \ninfrastructure progress in agriculture. Some mountain communities, however, might suffer from food shortage once in \nseveral years in case of natural disaster. The urban poor (<CNY130/capita/month) is about 60,000 (9.5%) of the total \nurban  population.  About  823,000  rural  and  urban  poor\u2014accounting  for  34%  of  the  total  beneficiaries\u2014will  directly \nbenefit  from  the  Project.  About  39%  of  the  beneficiaries  in  the  PA  are  the  rural  poor.  The  Project  itself  will  directly \ngenerate economic opportunities for the poor through improved access to urban markets and to other social services, \nreduced transport costs, and better access to and interaction with other regions, including labor migration. Directly and \nindirectly, through the promotion of agricultural commercialization and of local level urbanization, the Project will help \namplify the effects of ongoing poverty reduction efforts. In addition, the Project will promote the development of local \ntourism  in  remote  and  isolated  areas.  With  the  employment  opportunities  created,  increased  agricultural  and \nnonagricultural activities, and rise in labor migration, the poor\u2019s annual income per capita is estimated to increase 11% \nannually for 2004\u20132014. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIn stakeholder analysis conducted before and during project preparation, the roles of each stakeholder group are well \ndefined.  Guangxi  Communications  Department  (GCD)  is  the  Executing  Agency,  and  is  responsible  for  fund-raising \nand  overall  supervision;  the  Guangxi-Baise  Expressway  Construction  Office  (NBECO)  will  be  the  Implementing \nAgency (IA) responsible for implementing construction activities, and the Guangxi Expressway Administration Bureau \n(GEAB)  will  take  over  the  follow-up  management  role.  Local  governments,  local  communities,  and  relevant \nstakeholders  will assist NBECO to acquire land, implement  the resettlement plan (RP), including the minority village \nroads resettlement framework, implement the ethnic minorities development plan (EMDP), and organize local labor for \nexpressway  construction.  Leadership  organizations  consisting  of  various  county-level  government  agencies  have \nbeen  set  up  at  each  county.  The  main  responsibilities  of  the  organizations  will  include  acting  as  the  problem-and-\nconflict  resolution  mechanism,  such  as  the  grievance  system  for  the  affected  communities,  and  facilitator  of  a \nparticipatory process. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nDuring project preparation, GCD and the project technical assistance consultants undertook socioeconomic and traffic \nsurveys and public meetings among potential beneficiaries (around 4,000 people) to raise the level of awareness and \ngain  local  support.  These  processes  enabled  local  stakeholders  to  express  their  opinions  and  to  make  relevant \nsuggestions  on  the  expressway  and  local  road  designs.  Specifically,  intensive  consultations  with  the  rural  poor, \nwomen, and minority population were carried out during project preparation and surveys on project impacts. Various \naction plans were developed and distributed locally to facilitate implementation and monitoring, and help stakeholders \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\n\f56\n \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nacquire  a  sense  of  ownership.  The  participatory  activities  will  continue  during  project  implementation,  involving  the \npoor, women, minority people, and other vulnerable people. In selecting unskilled labor in the PA during construction, \nthe contractors will follow the recommendations of county poverty reduction offices and women\u2019s federations. During \nthe detailed design and construction of the expressway, local leaders from the affected villages and townships will be \nconsulted to minimize the loss of high-quality arable land and structures. For the local roads component, villagers will \nprovide unskilled labor at local market rates. Service contractors at the roadside station will be required to employ the \nlocal poor and to offer places for local products and service outlets. The RP and EMDP have been prepared and will \nbe implemented in the PA.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \n\n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe labor division in gender exhibits certain differences as those found in many other regions. Men are engaged more \nin  outside  activities,  as  migrant  labor  and  in  heavy  physical  activities,  while  women  are  more  responsible  for \nhousehold  chores  and  cropping  activities.  Young  women  account  for  40%  of  total  labor  migrants  from  the  PA. \nWomen\u2019s role in decision making in the household and community affairs varies from place to place and is constantly \nimproving,  although  it  is  still  limited.  Out  of  212  women  consulted,  about  74%,  17%,  and  6%  were  satisfied, \nunsatisfied, and unclear about their current status, respectively. Those that were unsatisfied felt that they are ignored \nby the women\u2019s federations. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nThe  Project  will  not  adversely  affect  women,  but  will  improve  their  social  and  economic  roles  in  general.  Women, \nespecially those from ethnic minority groups, are expected to benefit more than men. The road improvements will help \nfacilitate  the  implementation  of  government  programs,  and  will  create  better  access  to  information,  goods,  services, \nand  jobs.  Women  will  receive  more  benefits  from  providing  catering  and  other  services  to  workers  (over  30,000 \npermanently over 3 years) during the expressway construction period. Operation of the expressway will provide over \n500 jobs (50\u201360% of total jobs to be offered to rural people) for young women in the PA. Priority for project benefits \nwill be given to poor women, under the guidance of women\u2019s federations. \n \nE.

Resettlement leading groups and offices \nhave been set up.  \nA  socioeconomic  survey  indicated  that  the  local  people \ncould generally afford transport services. The local roads \ncomponent will make transport services more available to \nthe poor at an expected lower cost. \nThe  Project  will  use  about  500,000  person-months  of \nunskilled labor as construction workers over 3 years. The \noperation of expressways will create 2,500 permanent job \npositions on road administration and maintenance, service \nareas, and traffic control. About half of the employees will \nbe from the local population. The Project will facilitate the \ndevelopment  of  local  industry,  e.g.,  aluminum,  which  will \nalso create more employment opportunities. \n90% of the total beneficiaries are Zhuang and Yao people. \nThe minority village roads are targeting the isolated areas. \nThe  RP  and  EMDP  include  mitigating  measures  for \nminorities affected, and provisions to maximize benefits. \nimmunodeficiency  virus/acquired \nThe  risk  of  human \nimmunodeficiency \nsexually \ntransmitted infections might increase during and after the \nProject due to increased mobility and interactions outside \nthe PA.

The government of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi) has \nassured  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  that  if  additional  farmland  is  required  for  the \ncomplementary  roads,  the  affected  people  will  receive  compensation  and  other  assistance  as \nstipulated in the resettlement plan (RP) or the resettlement framework (RF) for minority village \nroads. The Guangxi Communications Department (GCD) is the project Executing Agency and the \nNanning-Baise  Expressway  Construction  Office  (NBECO)  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency.     \nThe  Nanning  and  Baise  city  governments  will  implement  the  resettlement  activities  with \nsupervision by NBECO. The RP and RF for village roads were approved by GCD on behalf of the \nGuangxi government in June 2004. \n \n2. \n70  administrative  villages,  and  505  village  groups.  About  1,434  hectares  (ha)  of  land  will  be \nacquired, 83% of which will be farmland; 11%, forestland; and 6%, wasteland. Land acquisition \nwill  directly affect  the  equivalent  of  2,987  households  (13,141  people).  Another  313  ha  will  be \noccupied  temporarily  during  the  construction  phase.  A  total  of  41,021  square  meters  (m2)  of \nhouses will be demolished, necessitating relocation of 360 houses in which 1,584 people live. \nAbout  19.9%  of  the  affected  houses  are  brick-concrete  structures  and  77.3%  are  brick-timber \nstructures. The 250 km intercounty road is located in Youjiang District, Jingxi County, and Napo \nCounty of Baise City. It will require the acquisition of 118 ha, of which 25% is farmland, and will \naffect the equivalent of 498 people. Also, 67 houses with 296 people will need to be relocated. \nThe Project also includes 500 km of minority village roads, which are located in poverty counties \nalong the expressway alignment. Since this program involves improvement of existing roads, very \nlittle land acquisition and resettlement as anticipated and impacts will not be significant. An RF \nhas been prepared in the case of resettlement impacts. \n \n3. \nFor people who are unavoidably affected, the resettlement objective is to achieve equal, \nor better, income and living standards in line with the People's Republic of China (PRC) Land Law \n(1998) and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and Policy on Indigenous Peoples. GCD \nwill ensure that any people losing land, housing, other assets, or income source will be helped to \nfully  restore  their  income  and  living  standards.  The  RP  stipulates  entitlements  for  land \nresettlement  subsidies,  crop  compensation,  house  compensation,  and \ncompensation, \nresettlement  measures.  Given  the  poverty  condition  in  the  region  and  the  compensation \nstandards  used  for  other  expressway  projects,  GCD  has  proposed  higher  standards  for \ncompensation.1  Those who lose their houses will be given free new housing with roads, electricity, \nand water. Housing compensation will not be reduced for depreciation, and people will be allowed \nto  salvage  materials  from  their  old  houses.  Relocation  will  provide  an  opportunity  to  improve \ncurrent  housing  conditions.  These  households  will  be  moved  a  short  distance  to  another  site \nwithin  their  original  village.  Other  affected  assets  include  telecommunications  and  electrical \ninfrastructure,  tombs,  and  trees.  All  land,  housing,  and  other  assets  will  be  compensated  at \nreplacement value. The RP has provisions for moving allowances to help affected people during \nthe transitional period. GCD will request expressway contractors to give priority to resettlement- \naffected households in the allocation of unskilled jobs during construction. Resettlement effects \n\n                                                      \n1  Assuming  more  than  0.053  ha  per  capita.  If  the  average  landholding  is  less,  the  resettlement  subsidy  will  be \n\nincreased proportionately. \n\n\f58 \n \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nwere  minimized  by  consulting  with  local  officials  and  affected  people  during  selection  of  the \nalignment in the initial feasibility study. Most affected people will remain in their native rural areas \nand will be provided with replacement land and cash compensation based on the feedback from \nmore  than  two  thirds  of  villagers  surveyed  in  each  village  group.  If  the  compensation  for  land \nacquisition is used collectively, village groups will utilize the compensation funds to improve farms, \ndevelop  cash  crops,  and  invest  in  various  nonfarm  activities.  Of  505  affected  village  groups,         \n10  were  identified  as  seriously  affected.  The  decision  to  restore  and  improve  the  agricultural \neconomy  was  based  on  consultation  with  the  affected  people.  New  employment  and  income \ngenerating opportunities will also arise once the expressway is constructed and the local roads \nimproved. The people generally felt confident that this strategy will lead to better living conditions. \n \n4. \nGCD  will  assume  overall  responsibility  for  implementing  resettlement.  A  resettlement \noffice  within  NBECO  will  coordinate  planning,  implementing,  financing,  and  reporting  land \nacquisition and resettlement for the expressway, connector roads, intercounty roads and minority \nvillage roads. Leading groups for resettlement were established at city and county or district levels. \nSince  89%  of  affected  people  are  Zhuang,  ethnic  minority  officials  were  selected  to  handle \nresettlement matters. Ethnic minority committees also will provide another forum where minority \npeople  can  voice  possible  grievances.  For  economically  vulnerable  people,  the  Project  will \nprovide additional financial and physical support. Vulnerable households will receive (i) physical \nhelp  to  build  their  houses,  and  (ii)  special  measures  to  enable  them  to  maintain  their  living \nstandards. The RP includes a special assistance of 1% of the total resettlement budget to directly \nhelp  vulnerable  people.  The  people  affected  were  notified  about  the  key  elements  of  the  RP \nduring meetings and interviews. Before implementation, township and village officials will arrange \nfurther  consultations  to  discuss  specific  impacts  in  each  village  group  and  how  they  will  be \naddressed. People losing their houses will be offered a choice of housing sites, and those losing \nagricultural land will have a choice of suitable income replacement alternatives. All villagers will \nhelp  decide  how  to  utilize  the  collective  compensation  funds.  In  May  2004  copies  of  a \nresettlement  information  booklet  were  distributed  to  all  affected  townships  and  villages,  and \ndiscussed  with  households.  The  information  booklet  contains  the  resettlement  scope,  project \nschedule,  compensation  rates  for  land  and  other  assets,  other  assistance  to  replace  assets, \nrelocation and economic rehabilitation strategies, and grievance redress mechanisms. \n \nIn case of any grievance, affected people will submit their oral or written complaint first to \n5. \nthe  village  committee  or  the  township  resettlement  office.  If  their  complaint  is  not  settled  in             \n2 weeks, they can seek redress at the county resettlement office within 1 month. If the grievance \nis still unresolved, NBECO will try to solve the problem. Final redress will be sought, if necessary, \nin the civil courts, in accordance with the Civil Procedures Act. NBECO will engage the services of \nan independent monitoring agency to ascertain that the affected people have (i) received their full \nentitlements on time, and (ii) fully restored their livelihoods standards. NBECO also will establish \na  reporting  system  and  report  on  the  progress  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  through \nquarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB.  NBECO  and  ADB  will  establish  a  set  of  resettlement \nsupervision milestones. \n \n6. \nThe RP budget for the proposed expressway and its connecting roads is CNY625 million \n($75.5  million  equivalent).  For  the  intercounty  road,  the  cost  is  CNY14  million  ($1.7  million \nequivalent).  GCD  has  guaranteed  to  supplement  the  resettlement  budget,  if  necessary.             \nThe  resettlement  implementation  schedule  was  prepared,  based  on  the  project  construction \ntimetable.  Land  acquisition  will  start  in  September  2004  and  be  completed  in  early  2005.       \nHouse  relocation  will  be  from  July  to  December  2004  to  provide  time  to  develop  some  new \nagricultural land and readjust farmland in early 2005, and to fully restore livelihoods and living \nconditions by 2006. \n\n\fAppendix 17   \n\n59\n\nSUMMARY ETHNIC MINORITIES DEVELOPMENT PLAN \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nSocioeconomic Characteristics of Ethnic Minorities in the Project Area \n\nA. \n \nAn  ethnic  minorities  development  plan  (EMDP)  was  prepared  to  ensure  equitable \n1. \nsharing of project benefits and to propose measures for mitigating adverse effects on minority \ncommunities in the project area (PA). Adequate provisions to enhance economic conditions of \nminority  groups  have  been  integrated  in  the  project  design.  Special  mitigating  measures  have \nbeen  included  in  the  resettlement  plan  to  ensure  that  adversely  affected  ethnic  minorities  will \nalso benefit from the Project. Government policies will further help enhance project benefits. \n \nB. \n \nThe total minority population1 in the PA is estimated at 1.7 million (about 90% of the total \n2. \npopulation)\u2014higher  than  the  provincial  average  of  38%.  The  Zhuang  account  for  over  87%  of \nthe total population in the PA, while the Yao make up about 3%, and the Han 10%. They reside \nmainly in the expressway corridor (74%) and are concentrated in the county towns (69%). About \n300 people, mainly of Hui nationality, live in urban towns and represent the better-off and more \nadvanced  groups.  Sugarcane  and  fruit  production  are  important  cash  income  sources  for \nfarmers in the valley and hilly areas. The poverty situation of the Zhuang and Yao is relevant to \ntheir  geographical  remoteness,  which  limits  access  to  outside  markets  and  to  external \nemployment.  Households  of  Zhuang  (60%)  and  Yao  (90%)  have  an  income  of  less  than \nCNY900. Information and transport are key factors for men and women to advance their social \nability (Appendix 5). \n \nC. \n \n3. \nThe EMDP for the Project is based on the People's Republic of china (PRC) regulations \nand Asian Development Bank (ADB) Policy on Indigenous Peoples. The Government adopted a \npolicy of ethnic equality post-1949 where all groups are legally and constitutionally equal. ADB \npolicy  aims  to  protect  ethnic  minorities  from  the  adverse  impacts  and  to  ensure  benefits  from \nproject development. The Project fully mainstreams ethnic minorities\u2019 concerns into its design, \nas these people are considered one of the primary beneficiaries. The local roads program was \ndesigned to benefits the isolated minorities and poor. Significant project impacts include tourism \nand  roadside  stations  development,  higher  farm  prices  of  goods,  accessibility,  and  enhanced \ncommunication  with  urban  centers  (Table  A17).  The  Project  is  not  expected  to  have  any \nadverse impacts on minorities, except for land acquisition. \n \nD. \n \nImplementation  arrangements  and  the  associated  costs  for  the  EMDP  have  been \n4. \nintegrated into the overall project arrangements, or are part of ongoing government programs. \nResettlement  assistance  for  vulnerable  households  is  budgeted  at  1%  of  the  total  basic \nresettlement cost. The overall project system includes monitoring and evaluating the EMDP and \nhiring an independent domestic agency for external monitoring. Ethnic minority beneficiaries will \nparticipate  in  project  implementation.  The  ADB  midterm  review  will  pay  special  attention  to \nethnic minority groups. If necessary, adjustments will be made during the Project to better meet \nethnic minority needs. \n \n\nLegal Framework and Project Benefits \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n                                                 \n1  Ethnic minority groups refer to groups that are different from the majority ethnic group\u2014the Han.  \n\n\f60\n \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n \nProposed \nMeasures \nProtection of \ncommunities from \nconstruction  \ndisturbances \nControl of \ntransmissible \ndiseases \n \n \nSpecial support to \nresettlement-\naffected people \n \n \n \n \n \nMinority village \nroads \n\nConstruction of \nbiogas digesters \nMicrocredit  \n\nNew farmland \nreclamation \n \nForestation \n\nAgricultural inputs \n(training and crop \nproduction) \nEmployment of \nminorities  \n \n \n\nTable A17: Ethnic Minorities Action Plan \n\nTargets/Indicators \n\nProhibiting nighttime construction \nBuilding 383 grade-separated crossings \nRepairing damaged irrigation systems \n\nHealth clinics in construction camps \nHuman immunodeficiency virus/acquired \nimmunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and \nsexually transmitted diseases (STD) and  \nHIV/AIDS and STD prevention programs \n1% of resettlement budget reserved for \nvulnerable groups \nOptions for affected households  \n6 months notice time for affected households \nto select new resettlement sites \nTraining by minority trainers \nRefunding land reclamation and forestry \ntaxes to affected area \n500 km village roads in 120 villages \n\n10,000 digesters \n\n120 villages, mostly to rural women \n\n+120 villages; 40,000 mu of farmland \n\nSelected poverty villages \n1,200 mu of orchards/forest planted \n120 rural villages \nMinority trainers \n\nOver 800,000 person-months unskilled labor \nfor expressway and intercounty roads \nconstruction (90% of total unskilled labor \nrequired) \nContractors use minimum 75% of local labor  \n2,000 workers \n\nBeneficiaries \n\nOver 180,000 \nminority people \nfrom 503 sub-\nvillages \nMinority residents  \nOver 30,000 \nmigrant \nconstruction \nworkers \n2,100 ethnic \nminority \nhouseholds (8,100 \npersons) \n\n225,000 minority \npopulation \n \n45,000 minority \npeople \n225,000 rural \nminority \npopulation \n80,000 rural poor \n\n225,000 minority \npopulation \n\n200,000 minority \nlabor (avg. 4 \nmonths each) \n\n6,000 rural people  4,600 Tax \n\nBudget \n(CNY \u2018000) \nIncluded in the \nProject \n\nTiming \n\n2005\u2013\n2007 \n\nIncluded in the \nProject \n\n2005\u2013\n2007 \n\n2004\u2013\n2005 \n\n2005\u2013\n2008 \n\n2005\u2013\n2007 \n2005\u2013\n2007 \n\n2005\u2013\n2007 \n\n2005\u2013\n2006 \n2005\u2013\n2007 \n\n2005\u2013\n2007 \n\nIncluded in \nresettlement \nplan and \nGovernment \nprograms \n\n75,000 in \nproject \n\n10,000 \nPoverty Fund \n25,000 (ABC) \n\n81,000 tax \nrebate \n\nrebate \nCovered by \nlocal programs \n\nNone, \nGuangxi \nComm.
