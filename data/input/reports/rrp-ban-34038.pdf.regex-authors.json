The \nProject will implement innovative approaches for erosion mitigation \nfor this purpose: (i) protecting the riverbanks through an adaptive \napproach of placing revetments along the natural river alignments \nas needed; and (ii) using sand-filled geotextile bags, a lower cost \nand  labor-intensive  alternative  to  conventional  materials. \nInstitutional  development  support  will  focus  on  the  full \nimplementation of the key principles of the 1999 National Water \nPolicy  (NWP)  applied  to  the  Project  institutions  including  the \noperation of joint management committees (JMCs) by the national \nGovernment, local governments, and diverse stakeholders.  \n   \nRationale  Riverbank  erosion  is  a  perennial  problem  in  Bangladesh  that \ndisplaces over 100,000 people annually with devastating social \nand  poverty  impacts  along  the  major  rivers,  where  poverty  is \nheavily concentrated. The dynamic river process in the Jamuna \nand Meghna rivers is currently critically threatening the PIRDP and \nMDIP flood embankments. If unattended, the process is likely to \nerode  the  embankments  in  the  very  near  future,  resulting  in \ninundation of the project area affecting the livelihoods of up to 2 \nmillion people and significantly reversing the momentum of poverty \nreduction, due to the loss of agriculture and other benefits secured \nby the embankments, including local institutions for participatory \nwater management. About 1,700 hectares (ha) of highly productive \nagricultural lands and homesteads are also expected to be eroded, \ndisplacing  28,000  people  as  asset-less  poor  over  the  next  10 \nyears.   \nDespite the urgent need to protect the project area, conventional \nprotection structures using hard materials to actively control the \nriver channels require high investment and maintenance costs and \nare infeasible. On the other hand, retiring the embankments could \nbe less costly, but results in significant social disruption associated ", "iv   \nwith  substantial  loss  of  land  and  dislocation  of  people,  and  is \ndifficult  to  be  implemented  prior  to  the  erosion  of  the  existing \nembankments,  given  its  social  implications.  Thus,  sustainable \nmeasures that are socially viable and economically feasible were \ndesperately  required.  The  Project  was  formulated  from  this \nperspective,  based  on  the  intensive  assessment  of  river \nmorphology and interventions in Bangladesh and elsewhere, which \nresulted in the identification of cost effective structural measures \nand  a  range  of  nonstructural  measures,  including  social \ndevelopment programs to engage the most vulnerable erosion-\ndisplaced hard-core poor in sustainable water management. The \nsuccessful implementation of the Project will serve as a model that \ncan  be  replicated  throughout  the  country  to  enhance  the \nlivelihoods  of  many  vulnerable  people  threatened  by  riverbank \nerosion in the floodplains of Bangladesh.        \n   \nObjectives and Scope  The Project aims to sustain the incomes of people in the PIRDP \nand  MDIP  areas  through  establishing  sustainable  riverbank \nerosion  management  system  (REMS)  that  provide  reliable  and \ncost-effective  mitigation  measures  through  adaptive  riverbank \nprotection works and a range of nonstructural instruments to adapt \nto  the  dynamic  morphological  processes  of  the  Jamuna  and \nMeghna  rivers.  The  project  scope  comprises  (i)  about  7.0 \nkilometers (km) and 4.4 km of riverbank protection works in PIRDP \nand MDIP, respectively through placement of revetments using \nsand-filled geotextile bags; (ii) nonstructural river erosion mitigation \nmeasures including data and information management, disaster \npreparedness, and targeted social development to the erosion-\ndisplaced  poor;  and  (iii)  institutional  strengthening  of  REMS \nincluding capacity development and project management.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The Project is estimated to cost $61.3 million equivalent, of which \n$19.6  million  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $41.7  million \nequivalent is the local currency cost including taxes and duties of \n$9.7 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan          ($ million) \nForeign  Local \nSource  Total  Percent \nExchange  Currency \nADB  19.6  22.6  42.2   69 \nGovernment 0.0  19.1  19.1   31 \n     Total  19.6  41.7  61.3  100 \n  (Above table excludes operation and maintenance costs of irrigation and drainage \nfacilities borne by the beneficiaries and the Government.) \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The  equivalent  in  various  currencies  of  SDR31,975,000  ($42.2 \nmillion approximately) from the Special Funds Resources of ADB. \nThe term will be 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, and \nthere will be an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  ", "  v\n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) \n   \nImplementation  Project  implementation  will  aim  towards  full  operation  of  key \nArrangements  principles  of  the  1999  NWP.  A  project  management  office  is \nestablished within BWDB to manage the project implementation to \nbe  undertaken  by  subproject  management  offices  (SMOs) \nestablished in the PIRDP and MDIP. A JMC will be established in \neach subproject area, with representation from line agencies, local \ngovernments, and diverse stakeholder institutions including water \nmanagement associations and fishery representatives, which will \nprovide  supervision  and  guidance  to  the  annual  planning  and \nimplementation of SMO activities. A steering committee will be \nconvened for central level coordination of the concerned ministries \nand departments. \nThe Project will also establish and operate sustainable operation \nand  maintenance  (O&M)  funding  following  the  NWP,  which \nstipulates O&M cost recovery of irrigation schemes through local \nresource  mobilization  and  of  flood  control  schemes  through \nrationalizing the Government\u2019s budgetary mechanism. In line with \nthis,  the  Project  aims  to  (i)  substantially  enhance  local  cost \nrecovery of irrigation O&M, thereby reducing the existing budgetary \nburden  of  BWDB  for  the  project  areas;  and  (ii)  establish  and \noperate, in the context of the Project, a performance-based O&M \nbudgetary  management  mechanism  within  BWDB,  where  fund \nallocation  is  prioritized  on  the  basis  of  the  stipulated  and \ntransparent performance criteria.  \n   \nProcurement  In  consideration  of  the  urgent  need  to  undertake  riverbank \nprotection work during the dry season of 2002/03 to prevent the \nembankment failure during the 2003 monsoon, advance action and \nretroactive financing have been approved for eligible expenditures \nafter the date of appraisal, subject to ADB approval of the loan. All \nprocurement under the Project will be done in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Major contracts for equipment \nand  materials  exceeding  $0.5  million  will  be  procured  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB),  including  the  supply  of \ngeotextile bags. Civil works under the Project will be up to $2.0 \nmillion and will be contracted through local competitive bidding \n(LCB) with prequalification by the PMO, due to the remoteness of \nthe  area  and  intermittent  distribution  of  the  works  over  the \nimplementation period. As to the ICB for geotextile bag supply and \nLCB for civil works, consultants will be engaged as \u201cthe engineer\u2019s \nrepresentatives\u201d to undertake contract management.   \n   ", "vi   \nConsulting Services  Consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. It \nis  estimated  that  a  total  of  470  person-months  of  consulting \nservices  will  be  required,  including  125  person-months  of \ninternational and 345 person-months of domestic consulting inputs. \nThis will comprise (i) a team of individually recruited consultants to \nundertake the protection works in the 2002/03 dry season, (ii) a \nteam recruited from a firm for project management and capacity \ndevelopment activities, and (iii) individual consultants to form an \nexpert panel for technical guidance of the protection works. To \nensure timely recruitment of consultants to meet the immediate \nneeds of protection works, the Government has requested ADB to \nselect the consultants on its behalf.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will benefit the project areas having a total population \nBeneficiaries  of 2 million in the flood protection command, and 440,000 in the \nirrigation  command.  Major  benefits  will  include  avoided  loss  of \n1,700 ha of land and avoided displacement of 28,000 people in the \nnext 10 years; and protection and enhancement of flood protection \nand  irrigation  benefits  in  the  overall  project  area  amounting  to \n116,000  metric  tons  of  cereal  production  along  with  water \nmanagement associations developed for sustainable O&M of water \ncontrol facilities. The economic internal rate of return is 16.7% in \nPIRDP and 31.4% in MDIP.  \nSurveys conducted during project preparation estimated that about \n53% and 47% of the total households in the PIRDP and MDIP \nareas, respectively, fall below the poverty line, which is higher than \nthe national average but about 10-15% lower than in the adjacent \nareas.  These  figures  would  substantially  increase  without  the \nProject. With its labor-intensive approach to riverbank protection, \nthe  Project  will  also  have  a  poverty  impact  of  45%  and  42%, \nrespectively.  Its  social  development  strategy  will  focus  on \nenhancing  participatory  development  for  the  poor  in  water \nmanagement  activities,  empowerment  of  the  most  vulnerable \nerosion-affected  people  along  the  bank  line  through  targeted \nsupport, and enhancing the role of women in project institutions.   \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  has  certain  risks  that  could  adversely  affect  its \neffective  implementation  and  sustainability:  (i)  technical  and \nmorphological  risks,  (ii)  implementation  risks,  and  (iii)  O&M \nsustainability risks. The Project design has incorporated mitigation \nmeasures  to  address  the  remaining  risks  through  (i)  including \ncontingency  plans  to  cope  with  morphological  and  technical \nuncertainties  through  process-type  approach  of  implementation \nwith intensive performance evaluation; (ii) incorporating specific \narrangements  to  ensure  timely  recruitment  of  consultants, \nprocurement processing, and construction quality control, including \nthe  selection  of  consultants  by  ADB  and  fielding  of  sufficient \nnumber of consultants for critical processes; and (iii) agreeing  with ", "  vii\n  the national government on the specific local resource mobilization \nplan  and  action  plans  to  strengthen  the  O&M  funding  by  the \nnational and local governments following the principles of the 1999 \nNWP.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Jamuna-Meghna  River  Erosion  Mitigation \nProject.1 The Project Framework is shown in Appendix 1. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Sector  Description.  Poverty  remains  a  massive  and  predominant  problem  in \nBangladesh, with 44% of its population of over 130 million living under the poverty line. Given \nthat over 80% of the poor live in rural areas engaged in agriculture and related nonfarm \nactivities, enhancing agricultural and rural development is a key to reducing poverty in the \ncountry. Due to the geographical location of Bangladesh in the confluence of three major \nrivers\u2015 Jamuna, Ganges, and Meghna\u2015the livelihood of the poor is fundamentally affected by \nwater sector challenges generated by this major river system, including (i) massive floods in the \nmonsoon season, (ii) severe water scarcity in the dry season, (iii) riverbank erosion and siltation \nof watercourses, (iv) periodic natural disasters such as cyclones and tidal surges, and (v) \nwidespread arsenic contamination of groundwater. While sustainable water management is \nparamount for the prosperity of the poor and overall economic growth, the task is further \ncomplicated  by  diverse  social  interests  attached  to  different  livelihood  activities  and  the \nvulnerable  natural  environment,  which  are  affected  by  water  management  activities.  The \ncountry\u2019s sector policies and institutional framework and capacities remain weak to meet these \ndiverse challenges comprehensively, and in a participatory and strategic manner.  \n3.  Riverbank  Erosion.  Riverbank  erosion  is  a  perennial  problem  caused  by  dynamic \nchannel shifting of the rivers flowing through the unconsolidated sediments of the floodplain. \nNationwide, an estimated 1,200 kilometers (km) of riverbank in the major rivers is actively \neroding, with more than 500 km having severe erosion problems. An estimated 10,000 hectares \n(ha) of floodplain land is lost annually, with the emergence of new but much smaller and short-\nlived low-lying char lands, which exhibit a significantly reduced production base. This process \nannually affects about 100,000 local people, who face significant social hardships such as loss \nof  homestead,  becoming  landless,  and  being  displaced  to  the  riverine  fringe  land,  nearby \nembankments, char lands, or urban slums. In total some 5 million people live in the active \nfloodplain of the major rivers susceptible to bank erosion, of whom 2 million live on vulnerable \nchar land. Poverty incidence is significantly higher in these areas due to river erosion. Past \nefforts to mitigate the effects of erosion have not produced tangible outputs, due to the lack of \ncost-effective mitigation measures that can effectively cope with the highly dynamic, erratic, and \nunavoidable morphological changes of the major rivers in Bangladesh.2  \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n4.  Erosion Threats in the Project Area. Progressive riverbank erosion is now threatening \nthe flood embankments in the two subproject sites of the ongoing Loan No. 1399-BAN(SF) \nCommand  Area  Development  Project  (CADP),  comprising  the  Pabna  Irrigation  and  Rural \n                                                 \n1  Project Preparatory Technical Assistance was provided under ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of Bangladesh for Jamuna-Meghna River Erosion Mitigation Project. Manila. \n2  Some protection measures have been attempted at a few locations where key infrastructure and urban areas are \nat risk, with high-cost, hard structures to directly control the channel flow pattern. However, in some such cases \nthis treatment has resulted in even more severe attacks resulting in structural failure and high maintenance costs. ", "2 \nDevelopment Project (PIRDP) and the Meghna-Dhonagoda Irrigation Project (MDIP), located \nalong the right bank of the Jamuna and left bank of the Meghna rivers, respectively.3 The two \nschemes provide flood protection for 203,500 ha with a total population of 2 million, of which \n36,400 ha is provided with irrigation facilities being rehabilitated under the ongoing CADP. \nIntensive agriculture and fish culture are under way to their full development potential, with an \nincrease  of  cropping  intensity  from  125%  to  191%  between  1994  and  2001,  and  of  rice \nproduction from 130,000 to 203,000 metric tons between 1996 and 2001. Poverty incidence has \nalso been significantly reduced, and is now about 10-15% lower than in the adjacent areas, \nalthough it is still higher than the national average, with the continued inflow of people displaced \nby bank erosion from nearby. To promote optimal use of irrigation facilities, water management \nassociations (WMAs) were established, and cost-recovery arrangements are being introduced \nfor sustainable operation and maintenance (O&M), rendering them the first large-scale irrigation \nschemes to institutionalize participatory water management in Bangladesh.  \n5.  However, natural river erosion has accelerated along the PIRDP and MDIP since the \nlate 1990s, reducing the distance between the bank and the flood embankments from about 1 \nkm to none in some critical reaches. While the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) \nimplemented immediate interim works in 2001 and 2002, mobilizing its own resources to protect \nthe flood embankments, the embankments are likely to fail in the very near future without \npermanent protection works, which would lead to the inundation of the area and substantial loss \nof flood protection and irrigation benefits along with the deterioration of local WMAs, affecting \nthe  people  within  the  embankments.  The  momentum  of  poverty  reduction  would  also  be \nreversed, with substantial increase in the number of the poor due to the lost agriculture and \nother  benefits.  The  process  would  also  erode  1,700  ha  of  homestead,  embankment,  and \nagricultural land and displace 5,600 households or some 28,000 people in the next 10 years.  \n6.  Government Policies and Plans. In recent years, the Government has proceeded with \nwater sector reforms to address past shortcomings. The 1999 National Water Policy (NWP) \nadopted the principles of integrated water management with due emphasis on stakeholder \nparticipation, strategic planning, sound management of social and environmental issues, and \nsustainable O&M. Following the NWP, comprehensive reforms of sector institutions have been \ninitiated to meet the policy principles, including the reorganization of BWDB and improvement of \nthe legal and regulatory framework and investment plan. On the legal and regulatory side, the \nWater Act is under preparation to comprehensively govern the utilization and management of \nwater. Guidelines for participatory water management have also been finalized that stipulate the \nmanagement transfer and local participation arrangements in water resources schemes. The \nGovernment also prepared the National Water Management Plan (NWMP) recently, which lays \nout strategies and priority programs at the national and regional levels. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) played a key role during the process, with its assistance strategy focusing on \npromoting an improved policy and institutional environment while addressing the significant \ncapacity  constraints  to  implement  the  reforms  and  providing  critical  infrastructure.  (See \nAppendix 2 for sector analysis, Appendix 3 for policy and institutional actions agreed upon in the \ncontext of the Project, and Appendix 4 for external assistance.)   \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1995.

The NWP and \nNWMP have accorded high priority to mitigating the effects of riverbank erosion in view of its \nsignificant poverty implications. However, effective strategy, measures, and institutions to cope \nwith the problem have not been established in Bangladesh. According to a study conducted \nunder the CADP in 2000, conventional structures using hard materials and taking an active \napproach to controlling river channels required high capital and O&M costs and resulted in low \neconomic returns. On the other hand, the alternative option of a phased retirement of the \nembankments was found less costly, but would result in significant social disruption associated \nwith continued loss of land and dislocation of over 28,000 people in the next 10 years, rendering \nthis option socially unattractive and opposed. It is also difficult to urgently implement this option \nbefore the existing embankment is breached, a major factor undermining its economic viability. \nThus, there was identified an urgent need to develop more cost-effective, socially desirable, and \nsustainable mitigation measures commensurate with the land use in the areas they protect; and \nthat were within the fiscal capacity of the local institutions and the Government; and that could \nbe sustained under the highly dynamic morphological environment of the major rivers.  \n8.  Appropriate Alternative. From this perspective, an alternative approach was identified \nand developed under the project preparatory technical assistance (footnote1) through detailed \nassessments of the morphological process and studies of the lessons learned in Bangladesh \nand in other parts of the world. (See Appendix 5 for project alternatives.) In contrast to the past \ninterventions, the proposed measures provided a passive and adaptive approach to managing \nriver erosion by placing the protection works parallel to the natural alignment of the river system. \nThis would reduce the risks of severe attack resulting in structural failure and high maintenance \ncosts. The protection works would consist of a revetment with launching sections, to cover and \nprotect the existing bank line as the scour holes develop. They are constructed of sand-filled \ngeotextile bags, which can be placed at about half the cost of conventional hard materials and \nhave the advantage of using sand and labor, the most abundant resources in Bangladesh. This \nis to be implemented with a range of nonstructural measures including the establishment of and \ndevelopment  of  capacity  in  riverbank  management  institutions  that  incorporate  stakeholder \nparticipation and ownership, and effective O&M systems with local cost recovery. Successful \nimplementation  will  serve  as  a  model  for  effective  and  sustainable  mitigation  of  riverbank \nerosion that can be replicated throughout the country, thereby contributing to the livelihood \nprotection of poverty-stricken local communities occupying the erosion-prone floodplains.  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n9.  The goal of the proposed Project is to sustain and enhance economic growth, poverty \nreduction, and livelihood security in areas threatened by riverbank erosion. Its specific objective \nis to sustain the incomes of people in PIRDP and MDIP areas4 through establishing cost-\neffective and sustainable riverbank erosion management system (REMS) that provide reliable \nmitigation measures through adaptive riverbank protection works and a range of nonstructural \ninstruments to adapt to the highly dynamic morphological processes of the Jamuna and the \nMeghna rivers while protecting and enhancing the livelihoods of the poor in the project areas.    \n \n                                                 \n4  Total number of beneficiaries is about 2 million, including 443,000 in the irrigation command.  ", "4 \nB.  Components and Outputs \n10.  The scope or components of the Project include (i) riverbank protection works, (ii) non-\nstructural river erosion mitigation measures, and (iii) institutional strengthening of REMS. They \nwill be provided focusing on PIRDP and MDIP areas. For the purpose of effective monitoring \nand achievement of outputs, the Project has distinct performance targets towards its midterm \nreview (MTR) in the third year and its completion. Implementation after MTR is designed based \non the performance of the output targets and other policy dialogue agreements, in particular the \nsatisfactory implementation of bank protection works and achievement of institutional targets.  \n \n1.  Part A: Riverbank Protection Works for the PIRDP and MDIP  \n11.  The Project will provide riverbank protection works to stabilize the critical sections of the \nriverbank  along  the  flood  embankments  in  the  PIRDP  and  MDIP,  following  an  \u201cadaptive \napproach\u201d to protect and stabilize the riverbank along smooth alignments that are parallel to the \nriver systems without changing the flow pattern, thereby reducing turbulence and the resulting \nscour more effectively than active structures that control and stand against the channel flows \nmore directly. An estimated total of 7.0 km and 4.4 km reach of riverbank will be protected in the \nPIRDP and MDIP, respectively.5 The protection works will comprise (i) riverbank revetment with \nlaunching aprons using sand-filled graded geotextile bags that start to fall down and cover the \neroding banks as the scour holes develop, (ii) upper bank line revetment with concrete blocks, \nand (iii) grass turfing along a strip of the bank at the crest of the revetment.6 (See Figure A11.3 \nfor illustrative figure of erosion control mechanism.) \n12.  The placement of protection works will follow a phased and process-type approach. The \nworks during years 1 and 2 will consist of a pilot-cum-implementation approach to reconfirm and \ndefine optimal design criteria and implementation approaches with intensive monitoring and \nevaluation. Specifically, protection works will initially concentrate on the most critical reaches of \nthe bank line along the PIRDP and MDIP. Detailed evaluation of the effectiveness of the \nprotection measures will be made in preparing the annual implementation plan, which will be \nsubmitted for ADB approval each year. Further reinforcement and extension of protection works \nwill be provided as necessary, in response to the river conditions prevailing at the time, and all \nthreatened  sections  will  be  protected  by  the  end  of  the  implementation  period.  Sufficient \nfinancial provision has been included to cope with the level of the scour depth observed under \nmore active structures applied in Bangladesh.  \n2.  Part B: Nonstructural Erosion Impact Mitigation Measures  \n13.  The  nonstructural  measures  comprise  (i)  community  disaster  preparedness  and \nmanagement, and (ii) resettlement and targeted social development support. These activities \nwill be implemented primarily during the first half of the implementation period.   \n \n14.  Disaster Preparedness and Management. The Project will implement the disaster \npreparedness and management plans in PIRDP and MDIP to alleviate the suffering of the \npeople in the event of an embankment breach due to an extreme flood event and/or sudden \ncollapse of an eroding embankment through (i) strengthening the system to warn stakeholders \n                                                 \n5  Morphological analysis has indicated that an additional 3.4 km and 4.4 km of riverbank may have to be protected in \nthe PIRDP and MDIP, respectively, over the project life of 30 years. The proposed Project does not include these \nadditional investments, although their costs and benefits were incorporated in the economic analysis.   \n6  In addition, 1.2 km of secondary defense line of embankment will be constructed in the PIRDP to protect the area \nfrom a potential breach of a critical section of the embankment with no setback distance to the river channel.  ", "5 \nand relief organizations, and (ii) enhancing the capacity of the people to cope with the threat. \nFor these purposes, the Project will provide training to community leaders and stakeholders, \ninitiate a public awareness campaign, and provide advisory support for the operation of the plan \nby community representatives. An awareness campaign about groundwater arsenic will also be \nincluded  to  promote  other  ongoing  programs  for  testing  and  mitigation.  An  experienced \nnongovernment organization (NGO) will be engaged to undertake these activities. \n15.  Resettlement and Targeted Social Development Support. About 57 ha of land will be \nacquired for the Project to implement the proposed riverbank protection works, comprising 35 \nha in the PIRDP and 22 ha in the MDIP, which would be lost to erosion without the Project. Due \nto the dynamic riverine environment, specific project-affected persons (PAPs) and the amount of \nland required are to be finalized during the final design stage.7 PAPs will receive compensation \nand  resettlement  benefits  in  accordance  with  ADB  policy  and  guidelines.  A  resettlement \nframework has been prepared to stipulate the procedures and arrangements. \n16.  The Project will also provide social development support to the vulnerable people living \nin the project area who are displaced by the ongoing river erosion process. Primarily focusing \non the most vulnerable groups such as female-headed households currently living as illegal \nsquatters on the flood embankments and vulnerable PAPs, support will be provided through an \nexperienced  NGO  for  group  formation  and  community  campaign  for  health,  hygiene  and \neducation awareness, and training on practical knowledge for income generation.8   \n3.  Part C: Institutional Strengthening  \n17.  The institutional strengthening component will consist of (i) capacity development and \nproject management, and (ii) information management.  \na.  Capacity Development and Project Management \n18.  This subcomponent comprises (i) establishment and operation of permanent project \ninstitutions including joint management committees (JMCs) and their affiliated government and \nstakeholder organizations, (ii) national level programming and coordination, and (iii) training of \nproject personnel and stakeholders. Services by consultants and NGOs will be provided to \nsupport these activities, along with the necessary hardware and software.   \n19.  Permanent Project Level Institutions Including JMCs. Following the 1999 NWP and  \nBWDB Act 2000,9 the Government is to establish and operate a JMC for each subproject, which \ncomprises representatives of line agencies, local governments, and stakeholders of diverse \n                                                 \n7  An additional 10 ha of land is required for the construction of the secondary defense line of embankments. \n8  A separate program to enhance the poverty reduction impact of these most vulnerable people has been prepared \nand submitted to the Government of Japan for funding through the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR). The \nJFPR  will  pilot  test  and  establish  effective  community-based  self-help  mechanisms  of  engaging  the  most \nvulnerable  erosion-affected  poor  in  permanent  employment  activities  associated  with  water  management. \nSpecifically, beneficiaries will be provided with opportunities to relocate themselves to more secure public land \nwithin the embankments and to undertake income-generating activities such as nursery development and social \nforestry, fish culture and livestock breeding using the water management facilities, in return for their engagement in \nroutine O&M works on the concerned facilities. The total JFPR grant is estimated at $1,000,000. Lessons and \nexperiences learned from the pilot activities will be used as a model for future replication by the Government in \nother erosion-prone areas.  \n9  The Act stipulated the new organizational structures and operational arrangements of BWDB following the NWP, \nincluding the newly-established Governing Council that include diverse stakeholder representatives and local \nexperts to decide on policy matters, procedures for scheme management transfer, and arrangements for improved \naccountability and transparency, among others.   ", "6 \nprofessions including those in WMAs and vulnerable social groups. The JMCs will govern the \ndecisions  regarding  water  resources  management  activities  in  the  project  area,  including \nriverbank erosion management, irrigation and drainage O&M, and agricultural and fisheries \ndevelopment. The JMCs will form a basis for managing water resources from an integrated \nperspective as promoted under the NWP.  \n20.  For the purpose of establishing sound JMCs and its subsidiary stakeholder institutions, \nthe Project will provide support to establish, strengthen, and operate the concerned project \ninstitutions, including the JMCs, local project offices, and the diverse stakeholder institutions \nincluding WMAs that will represent the JMCs through provision of consulting services and \ncommunity-based organizers (CBOs) for beneficiary mobilization and participation. Assistance \nby consultants will be provided primarily to establish and operate effective procedures and \narrangements along with human resources capacities for annual programming encompassing \nrelevant  project  activities;  design,  implementation,  monitoring,  and  evaluation;  emergency \nworks; management of environmental, social, and resettlement issues; resource mobilization; \nand preparation of annual reports. Specific efforts will be made to ensure that (i) JMCs play a \nprominent role in guiding project activities, maintaining effective coordination with and gaining \nsupport from the affiliated institutions; (ii) the project offices establish mechanisms for sound \nconstruction  supervision,  operation  monitoring,  and  performance  evaluation  of  riverbank \nprotection works; and (iii) all Project institutions charged with carrying out project and O&M \nactivities do so effectively with appropriate resource mobilization.  \n21.  By the middle of the third year, the project activities will result in significant strengthening \nof the institutional base of JMCs and stakeholder institutions to be evidenced by (i) effective \nfunctioning of the JMCs confirmed by its annual reports, (ii) WMA enrollment of at least 70% of \nagriculture and fish culture beneficiaries, and (iii) collection of stipulated beneficiary contribution \ntargets. By the end of the Project, all institutions will have sufficient local capacity to undertake \nProject-related activities without substantial external support, with necessary capacity retention \nand financial resource allocation mechanisms ensured at the national level.  \n22.  National Level Project Management and REMS Programming and Coordination. \nConsulting  services  will  be  provided  to  (i)  assist  the  central  project  office  operations  for \nimplementation, including supervision and guidance to the JMCs and control of field office \nactivities; operation of construction quality control and operational monitoring; and processing of \ndesign, technical specifications, and procurement; and (ii) monitor and advise on national REMS \nprogramming and coordination in BWDB including annual development and revenue budget \nmanagement,  implementation  coordination,  internal  and  external  audit,  and  preparation  of \nrelevant sections of the BWDB annual report in accordance with the BWDB Act 2000.   \n23.  Training. The Project will provide training for institutional strengthening within various \ninstitutions involved in riverbank erosion mitigation and relevant water resources management \nactivities in the project area. While training is aimed at enhancing the performance of those \nactivities  within  the  project  institutions  including  JMCs  and  affiliated  institutions,  it  is  also \nintended  to  enhance  the  long-term  abilities  of  BWDB  to  develop  required  programs  and \ncapacities  within  the  organization  to  train  the  related  project  institutions  and  stakeholder \nrepresentatives. They will be provided through consulting services and the existing government \nline department staff at the local subdistrict level who are also trained by consultants. The \nprogram will enhance skills for (i) riverbank management including river morphology, design, \nimplementation,  supervision,  monitoring,  environmental  management,  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement; (ii) participatory O&M for water resources management; (iii) management of the ", "7 \nJMCs;  and  (iv)  technical  support  for  agriculture  and  fisheries  development,  and  for \norganizational management of WMAs. The consultant team will design a capacity development \nplan  (CDP)  having  specific  monitorable  performance  targets  encompassing  the  staff  and \nstakeholder representatives of the relevant institutions, select and contract competent experts to \nprovide training, and supervise and evaluate the delivery of the training under the CDP.   \nb.  Riverbank Erosion Information Management  \n24.  The Project will strengthen the collection, storage, management, and sharing of data and \ninformation  relating  to  riverbank  erosion  management  focusing  on  hydrology  and  river \nmorphology in the vicinity of the project area along the Jamuna and Meghna rivers. Specific \nactivities  will  consist  of  (i)  updating  and  refining  database  management  arrangements,  (ii) \nimproving and updating the database, (iii) providing data management equipment and software, \nand (iv) analyzing morphological data. In particular, the Project will procure satellite images of \nthe  major  rivers  on  a  regular  basis,  monitor  morphological  changes,  undertake  short-term \nforecasting, and provide warnings to critical locations where land is likely to be eroded. Specific \nattention will be given to the potential morphological impacts of erosion and/or sand deposition \ninduced by the riverbank protection works provided by the Project.  \nC.  Special Features \n25.  The Project has several features to promote water resources sector reforms through \ndeveloping and establishing specific strategies and instruments, and implementing key policy \nand institutional reform principles. These include the following:  \n(i)  The Project will establish cost effective, sustainable, and innovative riverbank \nerosion mitigation measures that could be replicable nationwide to protect the \nlivelihoods  in  poverty-stricken  active  floodplains  through  (a)  an  \u201cadaptive\u201d \napproach of protection works to cope with the dynamic morphological process, \nand (b) the use of substantially lower cost and labor-intensive alternatives.  \n(ii)  The Project will put into operation key principles of the 1999 NWP in the PIRDP \nand MDIP as the leading large schemes where the NWP is operated. It will \nestablish  and  operate  the  JMCs,  which  will  incorporate  diverse  stakeholder \nparticipation,  transparent  and  accountable  decision  making,  and  information-\nbased management with capacity development and retention mechanisms.  \n(iii)  An effective local O&M financing mechanism will be operated with necessary \nrevision  of  regulations  to  authorize  project  entities  to  collect  and  retain \nbeneficiary contributions at the scheme level. Contributions from other private \nbeneficiaries will also be institutionalized. In addition the Project will promote \npolicy actions for improved O&M financing arrangements.  \n(iv)  The Project will implement a program to stimulate the self-help efforts of the most \nvulnerable and the poorest people displaced by river erosion and living on the \nembankments. They will be provided with opportunities to be organized into \ngroups,  and  will  be  engaged  in  income  generating  activities  using  water \nmanagement facilities. ", "8 \nD.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n26.  The total project cost is estimated at about $61.3 million, of which $19.6 million (32%) \nrepresents the foreign exchange cost, and $41.7 million equivalent (68%) represents the local \ncurrency cost, including taxes and duties of $9.7 million (Table 1). The detailed cost estimates \nand financing plan are shown in Appendix 6.10  \n27.  ADB will provide a loan equivalent to $42.2 million from its Special Funds resources to \nfinance about 69% of the total cost of the Project. The loan will finance foreign exchange costs \nestimated at $19.6 million (100% of the total foreign exchange cost) and local costs estimated at \n$22.6 million equivalent (53% of the total local cost). The Government will provide all the \nremaining local currency costs estimated at $19.1 million equivalent for incremental project staff, \ntaxes  and  duties,  land  acquisition,  and  compensation  and  part  of  the  construction.11  The \nfinancing plan is summarized in Table 2. Local cost financing is justified given the poverty-\noriented nature of the Project and the tight fiscal situation in the country.  \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nProject Components  Foreign   Local      Total \nExchange  Currency  \nI.       \nBase Cost \n  A.

", "9 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n28.  Organization and Management: The Executing Agency for the Project will be BWDB. \nAt the headquarters level, a project management office (PMO) will be established under an \nadditional director general in charge of O&M to manage implementation of the Project. A senior \nengineer at the level of senior superintending engineer, or an additional chief engineer and with \nmultidisciplinary experience and skills will head the PMO as project director. The PMO will (i) \nmanage  an  overall  implementation  plan,  annual  work  plans  and  budgets,  and  capacity \ndevelopment plan; (ii) liaise with the BWDB hydrology directorate for the implementation of the \ninformation management subcomponent and with the BWDB design directorate for structural \ndesign;  (iii)  liaise  with  subproject  directors  and  subproject  management  offices  (SMOs)  in \ndeveloping  subproject  institutions,  preparing  tender  documents,  evaluating  bids,  awarding \ncontracts for equipment, civil works and other project activities including implementation of the \nresettlement  plan,  and  monitoring  of  environmental  and  social  impacts;  (iv)  maintain  and \nmanage financial accounts; (v) monitor and evaluate the performance of riverbank protection \nworks and institutions; (vi) prepare periodic reports on implementation progress; and (vii) liaise \nwith  the  benefit  monitoring  unit  for  project  benefits.  The  organizational  chart  for  project \ninstitutions is in Appendix 7.  \n29.  For central-level coordination, a project steering committee will be formed comprising \nrepresentatives of the concerned agencies. The secretary of the Ministry of Water Resources \nwill chair the committee, with the project director as member-secretary.12 Committee meetings \nwill be held semiannually during the first year and annually from the second year.  \n30.  Under the control of the PMO and in accordance with inputs provided by the JMCs, \nsuperintending  engineers  at  the  Pabna  and  Chandpur  O&M  circles  will  be  appointed  as \nsubproject managers for day-to-day implementation by the concerned SMO. The SMOs will (i) \nprepare and regularly update an overall implementation plan and annual subproject work plans; \n(ii) strengthen the institutional basis of the JMC including WMAs and other local institutions with \nsupport  from  NGOs  and  CBOs;  (iii)  carry  out  field  surveys  and  designs;  (iv)  manage \nconstruction  activities  with  consultants;  (v)  undertake  flood  monitoring  and  emergency \nprotection works; (vi) monitor and report subproject activities to the PMO; and (vii) coordinate \nwith other agencies, local governments, and NGOs.  \n \n31.  The SMOs will be established with one construction division and one O&M division, each \nheaded by a full-time executive engineer, through reorganization of the field office structure of \nthe CADP, having two O&M divisions. The construction division will have (i) a construction \nsubdivision that will undertake design, construction management of river protection works, and \nrelated nonstructural measures; and (ii) a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) subdivision, to be \npermanently established using human resources from BWDB\u2019s hydrology directorate, which will \nundertake  regular  survey,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  work.  A  resettlement  and  social \ndevelopment section and an environmental management section will be established within the \nconstruction  and  M&E  subdivisions,  respectively,  with  experienced  BWDB  staff.  The  O&M \ndivision will undertake institutional strengthening of the JMCs and its affiliated stakeholder \n                                                 \n12 The project steering committee will include the Finance Division, Planning Commission, Ministry of Environment \nand Forests, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock, Local Government Division, Rural \nDevelopment and Cooperatives Division, Ministry of Land, Economic Relations Division, Implementation Monitoring \nand Evaluation Division, and Ministry of Water Resources and their concerned line departments, along with the \nBangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority. ", "10 \ninstitutions, and O&M jointly with WMAs established following the Cooperatives Societies Act \n2001, and Guidelines for Participatory Water Management (2000). CBOs will be engaged to \nenhance beneficiary participation in WMAs with performance-based contracts with SMOs. The \nO&M division will also form an emergency riverbank protection groups (ERPGs) comprising \nstakeholders living along the protected bank line, who will provide voluntary labor for emergency \nwork during the flood season.13 \n \n32.  At each subproject level, a JMC will be established in accordance with both the 1999 \nNWP and the BWDB Act 2000. A JMC will be chaired by the head of the SMO and will comprise \nlocal representatives of the line departments, heads of divisions in the SMO, representatives of \nlocal governments at the municipal committee and union parishad chairperson level, WMAs,  \nERPGs, and other stakeholder institutions, with an executive engineer of a concerned O&M \ndivision as member-secretary.14 The JMC will guide the activities of the SMO and contribute to \ndecisions related to project activities, such as (i) annual programs and budget, (ii) monitoring \nand emergency plans for the flood season, (iii) work plan for the dry season, (iv) capacity \ndevelopment plans, (v) local resource mobilization plans, and (vi) annual reports. It will also \nform a construction inspection group, with an effective grievance redressing mechanism to be \ndesigned by consultants. Initially, an adhoc JMC will be formed, with the participation of the \nstipulated members, and its operation will be assisted by the consultants. On the basis of the \ninitial operation, a detailed organizational setup and operational arrangements will be further \nrefined and finalized at the time of the MTR, based on which BWDB will issue an official gazette \nto formally establish and operate the JMCs by the end of the third year.  \n33.  In support of the actual operation of the JMCs, the Project will utilize existing institutions \nat the local level along with available external services. Specifically, the SMOs will coordinate \nwith the Department of Agricultural Extension and the Department of Fisheries so that their \ntechnical support will be provided to WMAs for agriculture and fisheries development, based on \ntheir institutional performance such as membership enrollment and O&M contributions. The \nLocal  Government  Division  will  be  coordinated  to  provide  training  to  concerned  local \ngovernment  representatives  in  the  JMCs.  The  Department  of  Cooperatives  will  provide \nregulatory  support  to  WMAs  while  providing  specific  training  for  WMA  management.  The \nDepartment of Environment will approve the environmental impact assessment of the Project \nand will monitor its impacts. The specific cooperation arrangements will be agreed upon under \nthe memorandum of understanding between BWDB and the concerned agencies by the end of \nthe first year, with necessary activity funds released from the PMO through the SMO. \n  \n34.  Capacity Development and Retention. Deployment of qualified staff and developing \nand retaining capacities are crucial for the sustainable performance of the riverbank erosion \nmitigation  measures  and  institutions  established  and  developed  under  the  Project.  As  an \nimportant step to ensure capacity retention between the construction and O&M phase, BWDB is \nto merge its central Implementation and O&M wings and their subordinate field offices. In the \ncontext of the Project, BWDB will create a pool of highly qualified river engineers and engineers \n                                                 \n13 Upon completion of the Project, each SMO will in principle be placed under the chief engineer of the concerned \nzone. Regarding the PMO, the Government intends to undertake further sector interventions, at which time it would \ncontinue its function as a focal point with necessary reorganization within central BWDB. \n14 The JMC will comprise one subdistrict representative each from the Department of Agricultural Extension, \nDepartment of Cooperatives, Department of Environment, Department of Fisheries, and Bangladesh Inland Water \nTransport Authority; heads of divisions of the SMO; the chairperson of the municipal committee; three union council \nchairpersons nominated by subdivision coordination committee; four representatives of WMAs comprising different \nprofessions; a representative from Information and Resources Center to be established under JFPR; and two \nrepresentatives from ERPGs. The concerned subdivision head officer, consultants, and representatives of the PMO \nand local NGOs will also participate as nonvoting advisors.  ", "11 \nwith  institutional  development  capacities  by  ensuring  acquisition,  development,  and  field \npractice of the concerned skills during the progress of their career path. Top officials posted to \nthe Project as project director, subproject managers, and executive engineers will have fixed \ntenure of sufficient duration to maintain continuity of leadership roles, institutional building, and \ntechnology transfer. BWDB will prepare a policy and service rules for recruitment, promotion, \ntransfer, and job rotation, which will be issued upon clearance of its Governing Council.    \n \n35.  Operation and Maintenance. In line with the 1999 NWP, O&M of the riverbank erosion \nprotection works and flood control, drainage and irrigation (FCDI) facilities will be undertaken by \nthe SMOs with overall control, supervision, and support from BWDB and the JMCs. The annual \nO&M plans will be prepared by the SMOs\u2019 M&E subdivisions for riverbank protection works, and \nby the O&M subdivisions for FCDI facilities in consultation with stakeholder institutions and \nthrough joint walk-throughs with WMAs. It will be endorsed by JMCs for implementation, with \ntheir  periodical  review  and  reendorsement  during  the  year.  Regarding  its  funding,15  NWP \nstipulates that, while water rates are to be charged for O&M of irrigation facilities, cost recovery \nfor flood control, drainage, and river management works is not envisaged, given the public good \nnature  of  the  benefits,  with  a  vision  that  the  funds  be  provided  by  strengthening  the \nGovernment\u2019s financing mechanisms through sector reforms. In line with this, the Project will \naim to (i) enhance irrigation O&M cost recovery from beneficiaries thereby reducing the existing \nO&M budgetary burden of BWDB in the project areas; and (ii) rationalize overall O&M budgetary \nmanagement within BWDB to ensure sufficient funds allocation to the Project.  \n \n36.  Regarding  the  local  O&M  financing,  the  Project  will  institutionalize  full  recovery  of \nirrigation O&M, the stipulated policy goal, and contributions from other private beneficiaries. As \na key step to improve beneficiary contributions, the Government is in the process of amending \nthe existing rules to the 1983 Water Rate Ordinance to authorize the project entities to collect, \nretain, and utilize the service charges for their own O&M. In line with this, BWDB and WMAs \nstarted  collecting  charges  in  2002,  with  the  target  of  substantially  recovering  the  cost  of \nirrigation pump operation by fiscal year (FY) 2004. By the end of the Project, SMOs/WMAs will \nachieve the full local O&M financing of irrigation canal O&M in addition to pump operations.16 \nFurthermore,  BWDB  will  (i)  establish  and  introduce  water  service  charges  to  beneficiaries \ninvolved in fish culture in areas protected by flood embankments prior to the MTR; (ii) develop, \nin consultation with concerned local governments, an action plan for their contribution to project \nmaintenance works prior to the MTR and operate the mechanism by project completion; and (iii) \nform ERPGs prior to the MTR to provide voluntary labor for emergency maintenance works \nduring the flood season through entering into agreements with immediate beneficiaries residing \nwithin close vicinity of the protected bank line.  \n \n37.  To improve the overall O&M financing in the water sector, BWDB has been undertaking \nseveral  institutional  reform  activities,  including  (i)  rationalization  of  overhead  through  staff \nreduction; (ii) reduction of O&M responsibilities through scheme management transfer; and (iii) \naugmentation of cost recovery from the irrigation project beneficiaries (see Appendix 3 for policy \nand institutional actions relevant to the Project), which will be reviewed annually during the \nproject implementation period. To further ensure sufficient O&M budgetary allocation to the \n                                                 \n15 Riverbank protection works and FCDI facilities are estimated to require annual O&M of about $0.5-1.0 million (for \nadditional placement of geotextile bags through intensive monitoring) and $1.6 million equivalent, respectively. \nBWDB\u2019s annual recurrent expenditure has been about $60 million in recent years, with over $20 million for \noverhead.   \n16 The target for FY2004 is $0.70 million equivalent. For this purpose, the SMOs will enter into service agreements \nwith each water management group within WMAs, to be signed by all farm households, along with undertaking an \nintensive beneficiary mobilization campaign for sound O&M practices within the project area. The agreements will \nbe revised in FY2005 to reflect the renewed targets towards project completion.  ", "12 \nProject, BWDB will develop and introduce a performance-based O&M budgetary allocation \nmechanism within the organization through which sufficient funds will be reserved for and \nallocated to well-performing schemes on a priority basis. Specific policy and administrative rules \nwill be developed with the assistance of the consultants and endorsed by the BWDB Governing \nCouncil by the second year.17 Furthermore, the Government will establish a specific block fund \nthat can be drawn upon for any follow-on activities required after the closing of the loan, by \nincorporating a 3-year post investment phase into a project concept paper for this purpose.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n38.  The  implementation  period  will  be  6  years,  from  January  2003  to  December  2008 \n(Appendix 8). Riverbank protection works will be implemented starting January 2003 to cope \nwith the critical threat of the ongoing progressive river erosion.   \n3.  Procurement \n39.  Goods and related services, and civil works to be financed from the ADB loan proceeds \nwill be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Vehicles, equipment, \nand materials will be procured by international competitive bidding (ICB) where the cost is \nvalued at more than $500,000 equivalent, or by international shopping between $100,000 to \n$500,000 equivalent. Where there are several local suppliers with satisfactory service facilities, \nequipment or materials valued at less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured under local \ncompetitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures,  or  on  the  basis  of  a  comparison  of  at  least  three \nquotations from the local suppliers when the cost is less than $50,000. \n \n40.  The civil works to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance with LCB procedures among prequalified private local contractors acceptable to \nADB. Given the small nature of individual contracts (less than $2.0 million), the remoteness of \nthe work area, and the intermittent distribution over a 6-year period, individual contracts are \nunlikely to attract international bidders. Domestic contractors have the capacity and capability to \nundertake the required works. Domestic contractors for these civil works contracts will be \nprequalified by the PMO using government procedures acceptable to ADB. Prequalification will \nbe updated annually and be based on contractor performance during the previous year on \nProject-related works. Indicative contract packages are shown in Appendix 9.   \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n41.  To cope with the dynamic morphological process, all bank protection works of any year \nhave to be designed, implemented, and completed within one dry season. Successful project \nimplementation within the tight time schedule will require strong consultant support for BWDB. \nTo ensure timely execution and construction quality, experienced international consultants will \nbe engaged by the PMO in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and \nother arrangements acceptable to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic consultants. A total \nof 125 person-months of international and 345 person-months of domestic consultant inputs will \nbe required, grouped into three packages: (i) a team of individually recruited consultants (22 \nperson-months international and 47 person-months domestic) to assist in the preparation and \nimplementation of the urgently required bank protection works from November 2002 to June \n                                                 \n17 As a guide, specific criteria for eligibility of acceptable performance will include (i) substantial local participation \ndemonstrated by WMA enrollment of over 70% of beneficiaries and satisfactory annual joint preparation and \nimplementation of O&M plans, (ii) satisfactory achievement of water service charge collection, (iii) satisfactory \nperformance of farm channel O&M delegated to WMAs, and (iv) substantial achievement of production targets. ", "13 \n2003; (ii) a team recruited from a firm (98.5 person-months international and 295 person-months \ndomestic) to undertake overall project management and capacity development from April 2003 \nonwards; and (iii) an expert panel formed with individually recruited consultants (4.5 person-\nmonths international and 3 person-months domestic) to provide technical scrutinization and \nguidance. The consultants under the first two packages are designated by BWDB as \u201cthe \nengineer\u2019s representatives\u201d under the standard contract document of ADB for each ICB contract \nfor geotextile bags and each LCB contract for civil works, and will administer the procurement \nand contract management processes for BWDB. Summary terms of reference are in Appendix \n10.  In view of the critical time dependence of the Project and the technical complexity, ADB will \nselect the consultants of the three packages on behalf of the Government. Quality and cost-\nbased selection procedures will be applied for the selection of a consulting firm.  \n \n42.  The services of NGOs are required to carry out (i) resettlement and land acquisition, (ii) \nsocial  development,  and  (iii)  disaster  preparedness  activities.  Prequalified  NGOs  will  be \ncontracted  on  the  basis  of  LCB  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  summary  terms  of \nreference of NGOs are shown in Appendix 10. For timely implementation of urgent project \nworks, an NGO engaged for the first activities has to meet the following eligibility criteria: (i) \nregistered under the Social Welfare Department or NGO Affairs Bureau; (ii) having at least 5 \nyears of working experience in the implementation of the relevant activities under externally \nfunded projects, with certificates by the concerned authority to verify satisfactory performance; \n(iii) having audit reports for the past 3 years to verify sufficient financial health; and (iv) having \nevidence of sufficient experienced and trained manpower.  \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n43.  The  Government  will  make  available  to  BWDB  and  the  PMO  through  budgetary \nallocation the proceeds of the loan to be applied to finance project expenditures. To expedite \ndisbursements,  BWDB/PMO  will  establish  an  imprest  account,  immediately  after  loan \neffectiveness, with a recognized commercial bank acceptable to ADB. Payments will be made to \nand from this account for eligible expenditures under the Project. The imprest account will be \nmanaged by BWDB/PMO in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January \n2001), and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the Government and ADB. The initial \namount of the loan proceeds released to the imprest account will not exceed 6 months of \nestimated expenditures and not more than 10% of the total loan amount. ADB\u2019s statement of \nexpenditures (SOE) procedures will be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures for \ncontracts  not  exceeding  $50,000  to  liquidate  advances  from  the  imprest  accounts.  For \ndisbursement of loan proceeds, direct payment procedures will be used for eligible expenditures \nincurred under contracts for geotextile supply, consulting and NGO services, and civil works \ncontract valued at more than $1.0 million. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n44.  BWDB/PMO and the SMOs will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to \nidentify  the  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  the  financing  resources \nreceived, expenditures incurred for the Project, and the use of local funds, in accordance with \ngenerally accepted accounting principles.  Consolidated Project accounts and related financial \nstatements will be compiled by BWDB/PMO and audited annually by independent auditors \nacceptable to ADB. The annual audit will include the audit of the imprest account and SOE \nprocedures,  and  a  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  SOE \nprocedures should be included in the annual audit report. The audited accounts, audit report, \nand related financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after the close ", "14 \nof the fiscal year to which they relate. BWDB/PMO will also prepare and submit quarterly \nprogress reports indicating progress made, problems encountered during the period under \nreview, steps taken or proposed to remedy the problems, the proposed program of activities, \nand the expected progress during the following quarter. A project completion report will be \nprepared and submitted to ADB within 3 months after physical completion of the Project.   \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n45.  The performance monitoring and evaluation of the Project will be carried out under the \ndirection of the PMO. Data for implementation-related monitoring including those related to \nsocial, institutional, and environmental issues will be provided by concerned staff of the SMOs, \nwhereas those related to the project benefits will be provided by extension officers of the SMOs, \nprocessed and analyzed by the Management Division of BWDB, and provided to the PMO. \nWithin 1 year of loan effectiveness, BWDB will have established a management information \nsystem with the assistance of the main consultants based on the system developed under the \nCADP, which will be consistent with the project performance monitoring system in ADB. The \nmanagement  information  system  will  be  used  for  implementation,  benefit  monitoring,  and \nevaluation of the two subprojects. Necessary surveys will follow the prescriptions of ADB\u2019s \nHandbook  on  Benefit  and  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  (1992),  Environmental  Guidelines  of \nSelected Agricultural and Natural Resources Development Projects (1991), and Environmental \nAssessment Requirements and Environmental Review Procedures of ADB (1993).    \n \n8.  Project Review \n46.  Detailed technical evaluation of the effectiveness of the erosion mitigation strategy and \nprotection measures will be made in the middle of year 2, based on which an optimal design \nand implementation approach will be identified for implementation in the subsequent years. This \nwill be followed by a comprehensive MTR in year 3, which will evaluate (i) Project progress \nincluding design, stakeholder participation, construction quality, and possibilities of modifying \nthe project scope; (ii) social and environmental impacts; (iii) future implementation plans and \ntargets;  (iv)  effectiveness  of  the  project  management  structures  and  implementation \narrangements;  and  (v)  institutional  sustainability  and  progress  on  developing  an  adequate \ninstitutional framework at all levels.   \n \n9.  Advance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n47.  Given  the  critical  threat  of  the  progressive  river  erosion  to  undercut  the  flood \nembankments in the PIRDP and MDIP during the 2003 monsoon season, thereby causing \nsubstantial  flood  damage  there,  the  Project  needs  to  implement  and  complete  significant \nprotection works during the dry season of 2002/03. This requires initiation of preconstruction \nactivities in November 2002. To achieve this end, ADB has approved advance action and \nretroactive  financing  for  recruitment  of  consultants  and  procurement  of  goods  and  related \nservices  and  civil  works  incurred  under  the  Project,  from  25  June  2002  to  the  date  of \neffectiveness of the ADB loan. For the timely implementation of the urgently required project \nworks, it is estimated that the Government will have to enter into contracts with consultants and \ngeotextile bag suppliers amounting to $4.2 million equivalent, and mobilize necessary payments \nprior to loan effectiveness. The Government has been advised that such advance action and \nretroactive financing do not commit ADB to finance the Project.  ", "15 \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Technical Issues \n48.  The  Project  aims  to  establish  cost  effective,  sustainable  and  innovative  riverbank \nprotection measures. However, river morphology in the Jamuna and the Meghna rivers is \ngenerally highly dynamic, for which accurate prediction is not possible beyond the short term of \n2\u20133 years. In response to the uncertainty of morphological behavior beyond short terms, an \n\u201cadaptive approach\u201d was developed, which will place protection works as and where needed \nand along the smooth and flat alignments that are natural to the river system, and stabilize the \nchannel along those alignments with sufficient design to withstand further scour. Following this \napproach, the Project will protect over 50% of the bank lines along the flood embankments of \nthe PIRDP and MDIP.18 Over the long period of years, the entire bank line may have to be \nprotected, although a major morphological change has to happen to necessitate the protection \nof the remaining sections,19 and the morphological attack on the bank line protected under the \nProject  would  recede  under  such  circumstance.  In  the  project  design,  the  costs  of  these \nadditional works are incorporated in the economic analysis over its 30-year economic life, with a \nsensitivity analysis of adverse morphological scenario where protection works for the remaining \nsections are placed immediately after project completion, in justifying the project investment. \n(See overall technical assessment in Appendix 11.) \n49.  The selected design option under this approach is the revetment with launching aprons \nof sand-filled graded geotextile bags placed in the river at the top of the eroding bank. The large \namount of bags built up along the bank will slide down the slope when river erosion undercuts it \nand will cover the bank to arrest the erosion. Concrete slabs will be placed on the prepared \nslope above low water level to provide a layer resistant to wave erosion. The bank protection is \nbased on the intensive monitoring of river conditions and short-term morphological prediction \nusing  satellite  images  and  is  provided  to  cover  the  critical  sections  of  the  riverbank.  All \nprocesses including survey, design, and construction need to be carried out rapidly after the \nmonsoon floods and completed during the subsequent dry season.  \n50.   A \u201claunching revetment\u201d using hard materials has been successfully implemented with \nlow annual maintenance costs of about 0.4% of investment costs in the Mississippi River, which \nhas similar morphological characteristics to the major rivers in Bangladesh. However, the same \nmeasure using geotextile bags has limited application history.20 While intensive data collection \nand  physical  model  testing  undertaken  during  the  PPTA  and  performance  monitoring  of \ngeotextile bags placed during the interim works by the Government in 2001 and 2002 have \nprovided positive indications, there remain some technical uncertainties for which verification \nwill require intensive field monitoring, such as launching performance in deeper scours. To \naddress those risks, the project design has incorporated built-in contingencies amounting to \nover 23% of base cost, comprising physical contingencies (10%), adoption of conservative \ndesign  scour  depth  (which  amounts  to  over  10%),21  and  reserve  stockpiles  (about  3%). \nIntensive  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  performance  of  the  protection  works  will  be \nundertaken during the first two years with the support of the independent panel of experts, \n                                                 \n18 Flood embankments have crest levels that can withstand the levels of floods with 100-year return period. \n19  The remaining bank lines that will not be covered under the Project in the PIRDP and MDIP have been stable for \nabout 20 years and 10 years without any erosion, respectively.  \n20 This is because conventional hard materials are readily available in the United States at cheap cost, which is not \nthe case in Bangladesh, where they are twice as costly as sand-filled geotextile bags. \n21 The design scour depth is -30m for PIRDP and -20m for MDIP from the low water level respectively for the whole \nprotected bank line. This is designed to withstand major floods with high return period, although a partial failure and \nrehabilitation may be required in the event and at the point of an extreme attack.   ", "16 \nbased  on  which  an  optimal  and/or  modified  design  and  implementation  approach  will  be \nidentified and adopted as required for the remaining implementation period.  \n \nB.  Economic Benefits \n51.  Economic analysis was carried out for the PIRDP and MDIP to evaluate the returns on \nproject investments (Appendix 12), with its economic life of 30 years. The major benefits of the \nProject are also shown in Appendix 1 as output performance targets. The estimated economic \ninternal rates of return (EIRRs) are 16.7% for the PIRDP and 31.4% for the MDIP. The EIRR for \nthe PIRDP is lower due to the longer bank sections that have to be protected and the deeper \nscour depth seen in the Jamuna River. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to test the project \nviability covering a range of scenarios including the uncertain and dynamic morphology. In the \nPIRDP, the EIRR in the event of a 20% decrease in incremental future agricultural and fishery \ndevelopment will reduce the EIRR to 14.0%. A 20% increase in protection works will reduce the \nEIRR to 12.6%.22 A significant morphological change that necessitates the protection of the \nremaining riverbank sections immediately after the Project will also reduce the EIRR to 13.1%. \nOn the other hand, at the MIRDP the EIRR remains significantly above 20% in all of these \nscenarios. These indicate that an investment in the MDIP is fairly robust, whereas in the PIRDP \nit is relatively vulnerable, although it remains viable in all sensitivity analysis cases. However, \nthe PIRDP has a higher poverty incidence, with high poverty impact ratio (para. 52).23  \n \nC.  Poverty Impacts \n52.  The  Project  will  have  direct  positive  impacts  on  the  income  and  employment \nopportunities  and  the  food  security  situation  of  poor  people.  According  to  the  sample \nsocioeconomic survey, poverty incidence among the beneficiary households in the irrigation \ncommand area and adjacent riverine areas of the PIRDP and MDIP is lower than in the \nneighboring areas by about 10-15%, although it is still 53% and 47%, respectively, which is \nhigher than the national average of 44% in 2000. Over the years, there has been a significant \nincrease  in  production  and  yield  of  rice  crops  and  a  reduction  in  poverty,  thanks  to  the \nimplementation of the CADP. Overall, the poor may attain a total of about 45% and 42% of \ndirect and indirect project benefits in the PIRDP and MDIP, respectively, when production and \nlabor benefits are taken into account. These benefits will be lost due to erosion under the \nwithout-project scenario, reversing the trend of poverty reduction (Appendix 13).  \n \n53.  The causes of poverty in the project areas are multidimensional. In both areas, the \ndistribution of existing resources such as land is extremely skewed. The landless and marginal \nhouseholds together account for about 62% and 74% of total households in the PIRDP and \nMDIP, respectively. As these areas are erosion-prone, a large number of households may \nfurther  lose  their  homesteads,  cultivable  land,  and  other  assets  completely  and  become \nassetless. A vast majority of people displaced by erosion have remained in the area, adding to \nthe existing number of poor households.24 Groundwater arsenic is also a major concern, with \n17% and 90% of the tubewells contaminated in the PIRDP and MDIP, respectively.25 Traditional \nsocial and local power structure induced an increased dependence of the poor while excluding \n                                                 \n22  The possibility for such increase may be low, given that the design of the projection works has already incorporated \na built-in contingency of over 23% (para 50). \n23 There are also unquantified benefits such as avoidance of human injuries, loss of livestock and household assets, \nas well as indirect benefits generated by the current agricultural production such as processing and/or trading of \nagricultural inputs and products, and other relevant nonfarm activities, which will be lost without the Project.    \n24  Over the past 15 years, 2,500 and 4,000 households have lost their assets in the PIRDP and MDIP, respectively.  \n25  Testing and marking of wells is being carried out under the ongoing programs, which the Project will also promote \nthrough awareness campaign under the disaster management subcomponent.  ", "17 \nthem from the political and social processes. From the socioeconomic survey, it appears that \nthe critical causes of poverty in the project area are income poverty, lack of human development \nsuch as education, health and nutrition and of empowerment of the poor and women. \nD.  Social Development Strategy  \n54.  The Project\u2019s strategy for social development will include the following, focusing on  \npoverty reduction among project beneficiaries. (The Summary Poverty Reduction and Social \nStrategy is shown in Appendix 13.) The project area does not have any indigenous peoples. \n(i)  In  line  with  the  1999  NWP,  which  promotes  participatory  and  comprehensive \nmanagement of water, the Project will include in the JMCs the participation of all \nstakeholders  including  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups,  who  will  be  treated  as \npeople\u2019s representatives and will be empowered equally as part of the JMCs.    \n(ii)  Groups comprising the most vulnerable segments of the population will be formed for \nself-help  empowerment,  with  specific  targets  to  include  female-headed  and  the \nlowest  income  households,  who  will  be  given  opportunities  to  be  engaged  in  \npermanent income-generating activities using water management facilities.  \n(iii)  Specific efforts will be made to increase the participation and the role of women in \nWMAs and JMCs. To ensure this, the Project will (a) set up a special network for \nwomen WMA members, (b) fix targets for enrollment of female WMA members, and  \n(c) provide special training for women-only groups. \n(iv)  Further efforts will be made to engage the local population, in particular poor and \nvulnerable  people,  as  construction  laborers  for  riverbank  stabilization  works,  for \nwhich wage rates will be fixed transparently.  \n \nE.  Environmental Impacts  \n55.  An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was  carried  out  during  the  feasibility \nstudies.26 The Project will have overall beneficial impacts, preserving the existing and potential \nbenefits of the PIRDP and MDIP schemes as well as protecting the livelihood of the population \nin  the  erosion-prone  areas  nearby.  Potential  negative  impacts  identified  under  summary \nenvironmental impact assessment (SEIA) include (i) mining, transportation and storage of sand; \n(ii) construction-related impacts including health hazards and accidental injury of workers; (iii) \nland acquisition and resettlement; and (iv) possible erosion of sandbars/chars and changes in \nriver morphology. On these accounts, the impact of sand mining will be negligible, given the \namount of sand required for construction during the 6-year Project of about 1 million metric tons \ncompared with the annual bed load transport of the Jamuna and the lower Meghna of more than \n150 and 200 million metric tons. The morphological impacts are also estimated to be limited, as \nthe structures do not confront the flow and cause great scouring. The sandbars and the char \nclosest to the protected portion are uninhabited and largely without vegetation. The Project will \nclosely  monitor  the  morphological  process,  and  if  significant  changes  originate  from  the \nprotection works, a compensation program will be implemented. \n \n56.  Key mitigation measures include (i) resettlement and rehabilitation of affected people \nprior to displacement from housing and loss of income and assets on the land; (ii) construction \nsite  management  including  labor  camps,  water  supply  and  drainage,  waste  and  spoil \nmanagement,  emergency  facilities,  and  restoration  of  land;  and  (iii)  monitoring  of  the \n                                                 \n26  EIA and the summary EIA (SEIA) were submitted by the Government to ADB on 14 May 2002 with authorization \nfor publication. The SEIA was circulated to the Board on 11 July 2002. ", "18 \nenvironment and river morphology for implementation of necessary remedial actions. These \nwere incorporated in the environmental management plan (EMP) in EIA and in the SEIA.27 The \noverall responsibility for implementing the EMP will be with the PMO, with the assignment of an \nexperienced executive engineer as chief resettlement and environmental officer, to be assisted \nby consultants. At the level of each SMO, an M&E subdivision and construction subdivision \nunder  the  construction  division  of  the  SMO  will  be  responsible  for  environmental  and \nresettlement management, respectively, with the assignment of subdivisional engineers as their \nsupervisors, and with necessary support for capacity development under the Project.     \nF.  Resettlement \n57.  The Project will involve a total of (i) 11.4 km of revetment works in the PIRDP and MDIP; \nand (ii) 1.2 km of secondary defense line (SDL) of embankments in the PIRDP, which will \nrequire  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  amount  of  land  acquired  for  revetment  is \nestimated at 35 ha in the PIRDP and 22 ha in the MDIP. These are located along the eroding \nbank line, which would be lost without project intervention. The SDL will require 10 ha of land \nacquisition.28 A resettlement framework for revetment works and a short resettlement plan for \nSDL were prepared for the Project (Appendix 14 for summary resettlement framework and \nresettlement plan). \n58.  The resettlement activities will be implemented in accordance with ADB\u2019s involuntary \nresettlement and other social safeguard policies. Under the Project, the resettlement framework \nwas prepared to cover the riverbank protection work. The main principles of the framework \ninclude (i) eligibility for all types of losses (land, crops/trees, structures, business/employment, \nand workdays/wages) associated with the project works including losses to nontitled people; (ii) \ninformation dissemination and consultation with PAPs; (iii) improving or at least restoring the \npre-project living standards of PAPs; (iv) compensating for acquired assets at full replacement \nvalue with other resettlement allowances for shifting and compensation for lost income; (v) \nproviding  special  additional  assistance  to  PAPs  of  female-headed  and  other  vulnerable \nhouseholds; (vi) providing priority assistance to PAPs in the social development program under \nthe  Project;  and  (vii)  providing  compensation  payments  for  acquired  lands, \nstructures/immovable  properties,  and  other  eligible  benefits  prior  to  award  of  civil  works \ncontracts that include ground leveling and demolition of structures.  \n59.  The  PMO  has  overall  planning,  financing,  and  supervisory  responsibilities  for \nresettlement plan preparation and implementation, which will be carried out by the SMOs with \ntheir resettlement and social development officers, with the engagement of an experienced \nNGO and consultants. Upon finalizing the specific sites and design of bank stabilization works in \neach year in response to the shifting of the riverine environment, the SMOs with the assistance \nof consultants, will prepare full or short resettlement plans, which will be sent to ADB for \napproval. The resettlement plans will then be implemented with the assistance of the NGO, with \na grievance redressing mechanism by representatives of the PMO, PAPs, local governments, \nand the NGO. The PMO will prepare and submit to ADB an annual report on the land acquisition \nand resettlement issues. An independent M&E agency will also be engaged to assess the \nperformance and impacts.  \n                                                 \n27 The key cost provisions in the EMP supervised by the chief resettlement and environmental officer include (i) land \nacquisition and resettlement ($1.9 million equivalent), (ii) temporary compensation and environmental works during \nconstruction ($0.53 million), (iii) disaster preparedness ($0.10 million), (iv) river monitoring ($0.90 million), and (v) \nproject management and capacity development on environmental management ($0.17 million).   \n28  Three households (18 people) will be relocated and an additional 30 households will experience some loss of \nagricultural lands. ", "19 \nG.  Risks  \n60.  The Project has certain risks that could adversely affect the effective implementation and \nsustainability of its benefits. These risks include (i) technical and morphological risks of the \nselected  design  measures,  (ii)  risks  of  implementation  in  terms  of  delivering  the  required \nservices  and  works  appropriately  within  the  limited  construction  period,  and  (iii)  O&M \nsustainability.  The  project  design  has  incorporated  measures  mitigating  those  risks  to  the \nmaximum possible extent.   \n61.  Regarding the technical risks associated with the limited experience of the revetment \nusing  geotextile  bags,  significant  contingencies  have  been  built  in  through  adoption  of \nconservative  design  scour  depth  and  stockpiling  arrangements  (para.  50),  with  economic \nsensitivity  analysis  of  a  further  cost  increase  by  20%  to  justify  the  investment.  Similarly, \nsensitivity analysis of significantly more severe morphological change was carried out to assess \nthe viability against the morphological risks. Project implementation also envisages intensive \nM&E with the involvement of an external panel of experts.  \n62.  The implementation risk is associated with the critical need to undertake and complete \nbank protection works of any year within one dry season, including during 2002/03 dry season. \nThis  requires  expeditious  fielding  of  consultants,  procurement,  and  implementation  of \nresettlement  activities,  and  stringent  quality  control.  The  project  design  has  included  the \narrangements for engaging consultants for pre-construction services and contract management \nas  \u201cthe  engineers  representatives.\u201d  ADB  is  also  to  select  consultants  on  behalf  of  the \nGovernment. The Government also initiated necessary advance actions to ensure the timely \ninitiation of the project activities.     \n63.  Finally, there is a sustainability risk associated with (i) local institutional development, \nand (ii) BWDB capacities to rationalize and prioritize O&M budgetary management. To address \nthese risks, the Project has incorporated institutional support to strengthen the capacities of \nBWDB engineers, extension officers, CBOs, and other JMC representatives. Regarding the \nO&M funding sustainability, specific arrangements to ensure the sufficient allocation of O&M \nfunds to the Project were agreed upon with the Government, including the introduction of a \nperformance-based O&M budgetary allocation mechanism to the project entities having eligible \ninstitutional performance as monitored through specific indicators.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n64.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:   \n \n(i)  The Government will annually update the status of implementation of the staff \nreduction plan, scheme management transfer plan, and overall annual O&M and \nforward the report to ADB for consultation.     \n(ii)  Within 1 year of the effectiveness date, BWDB will transform its Implementation \nand O&M wings into two O&M wings with job demarcations satisfactory to ADB.  \n(iii)  Within 1 year of the effectiveness date, BWDB will prepare policy and service \nrules for recruitment, promotion, and job rotation satisfactory to ADB.  ", "20 \n(iv)  By  the  loan  closing  date,  BWDB  will  convert  staff  positions  in  the  M&E \nsubdivisions of SMOs to permanent positions through reorganization of existing \nstaff positions in the concerned circles of BWDB. \n(v)  Within 1 year of the effectiveness date, the Government will revise the rules to \nthe 1983 BWDB Water Rate Ordinance and formally authorize the project entities \nto collect, retain, and utilize the service charges at their own discretion. \n(vi)  Within  2  years  of  the  effectiveness  date,  BWDB  will  develop  a  binding \noperational  policy  and  rules  to  operate  the  performance-based  O&M  budget \nallocation and management system satisfactory to ADB, to be fully operational by \nloan closing.  \n(vii)  BWDB will ensure that the cost of irrigation O&M will be increasingly born by \nWMAs,  with  achievement  of  WMA  O&M  cost  recovery  for  irrigation  pump \noperation by FY2004. This will be further expanded to cover secondary and \ntertiary canal O&M by loan closing.  \n(viii)  The  Government  will  further  ensure  sustainable  O&M  funding  of  the  bank \nstabilization works through provision of a block fund under the project concept \npaper for the Project, which can be drawn for this purpose after loan closing.     \n(ix)  The Government will ensure that all environmental mitigation measures identified \nand included in the EIA and SEIA will be incorporated in the detailed design of \nthe civil works and duly followed during implementation. \n(x)  BWDB  will  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  are \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the \nGovernment, and ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement, as set out in the \nagreed resettlement framework and resettlement plan. \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n65.  In view of the urgency of implementing the bank protection works during the 2002/03 dry \nseason, only general conditions for loan effectiveness will apply under the Project.  \n \nVI.

", "  Appendix 2  25 \nSECTOR ANALYSIS: \n BANGLADESH WATER RESOURCES SECTOR \n \n \n1.  Rural Poverty. Bangladesh remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with a per \ncapita income of approximately $360 in 2000. The most recent countrywide poverty data show \nthat 44% of the population was poor, and 20% extremely poor. With a population of over 130 \nmillion, Bangladesh suffers from massive poverty. It is predominantly a rural phenomenon, as \nmore than 90 % of the poor live in rural areas. It is multifaceted, reflected in low standards of \nliving, poor health and nutrition, and lack of education, abandonment of women and children, \nand vulnerability to natural disasters such as floods and cyclones. The basic causes of poverty \nare lack of access to productive resources (mainly land and water); public resources such as \neducation, health provision, and transport; and jobs. Lack of social and government safety nets \nentitlements  makes  the  land-poor  and  landless  particularly  vulnerable.  Poverty  is  largely \nattributed to weak rural and agricultural development.  \n \n2.  Water  Resources  and  Their  Implications.  Bangladesh  is  in  an  alluvial  deltaic \nfloodplain  in  the  confluence  of  the  three  major  rivers\u2013the  Ganges  (Padma),  Jamuna \n(Brahmaputra), and Meghna, which have a catchment area of 1.74 million square kilometers \n(km2) and bring about massive annual floods that inundate up to two thirds of the country. For \nrural people, access to productive resources, particularly to land and water, is of fundamental \nimportance to their livelihoods, although the people\u2019s relations with water are diverse and \ncomplex. Integrated and sustainable water resource management is required to meet people\u2019s \ndiverse  needs  while  preserving  the  rich  natural  ecosystems  in  the  country\u2019s  extraordinary \nenvironment characterized by (i) severe flooding, which not only inundates large areas but also \nfills river channels with sediment and erodes riverbanks; (ii) limited water during the dry season \nand expanding water demand; (iii) saline intrusion and environmental degradation; (iv) cyclones \nand tidal surges that decimate life and property in the coastal areas; and (v) widespread arsenic \ncontamination of groundwater.  \n \n3.  Agriculture is the centerpiece of the economy and supports the vast majority of the  \npopulation, accounting for 32% of gross domestic product (GDP), 13% of exports, and 60% of \nemployment. The sector has exhibited strong growth since the late 1980s, contributing to lower \nfood grain prices and benefiting poor households. However, sustaining agricultural growth to \nkeep pace with the expanding population presents a fundamental challenge where increased \nirrigation and flood management is a critical requirement. The country also needs to preserve \nresources for capture fishery and expand culture fishery with effective flood management and \nimproved access rights of the poor to publicly owned water bodies. The natural environment has \nbeen under increasing pressure, with declining soil fertility, land degradation, biodiversity loss, \nand deteriorating water quality due to urbanization and intensification of agriculture and fish \nculture with increased use of chemical inputs. The establishment of effective and sustainable \nwater management systems is an important part of protecting natural resources.  \n \n4.  Sector Institutions. The National Water Resources Council (NWRC), chaired by the \nPrime  Minister,  is  the  highest  authority  governing  the  water  resources  sector.  The  Water \nResources Planning Organization (WARPO) has been established under the Ministry of Water \nResources as the secretariat to the NWRC. Some 35 government organizations affiliated with \n13 ministries have some involvement in water resource management. The key implementing \nagency among these are the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), responsible for \nwater resource projects exceeding 1,000 hectares (ha); and the Local Government Engineering \nDepartment, responsible for projects below 1,000 ha. In general, despite the dire need for sound \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nand integrated water resources management, the country\u2019s sector policies and institutional \nframework and capacities have been unable to meet these diverse challenges comprehensively \nand in a participatory and strategic manner. Key institutional issues include (i) weakness in \nparticipatory, integrated, and strategic planning; (ii) agency\u2019s lack of capacity to implement water \nresource interventions to achieve the intended benefits; (iii) inability of local institutions to \nsupport the participatory process; (iv) deficient operation and maintenance (O&M) of many \npublic schemes due to insufficient mobilization of funds by central and local governments and \nthe lack of support from beneficiaries; and (v) corruption. \n \n5.  Past Interventions and Lessons Learned. External funding agencies have provided \nassistance exceeding $2.5 billion to the Bangladesh water resources sector. Of this, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank provided $600 million, and the World Bank $1.0 billion. Bilateral assistance \nhas been provided by 15 countries, of which the Netherlands provided the most at more than \n$200 million. Funding assistance was relatively low in late 1990s. ADB has provided 17 loans of \nalmost $600 million to water management initiatives. All investments resulted in increased \nagricultural production although increases were less than anticipated at appraisal. The extent to \nwhich  ongoing  system  maintenance  was  undertaken  governed  the  sustainability  of  these \nproduction increases. Environmental impacts of the investments were evaluated as generally \neither benign or positive, but the early projects that substantially altered floodplain regimes had \nnegative impacts on open-water capture fisheries, including the Pabna Irrigation and Rural \nDevelopment Project (PIRDP) and Meghna-Dhonagoda Irrigation Project (MDIP). Key lessons \nover the past two decades can be grouped into 6 themes:  \n \n(i)  Beneficiary  participation.  Sufficient  time,  resources,  and  a  clear  and  well-defined \nprocess to establish local organizations and their legal status are essential, along with \neffective management of the participatory process. Linkages to other sectors must be \nrecognized and reflected in implementation. \n(ii)  Environment. Environmental planning must be undertaken early in the project cycle to \navoid  and  minimize  adverse  environmental  impacts.  Monitoring  of  environmental \nimpacts and implementation of mitigation plan must also be improved.   \n(iii)  Planning. Rehabilitation of existing systems provides potentially large returns, given the \nsystem\u2019s quick gestation period and small social and environmental impacts. Planning \nshould also be participatory and fully take into account cross-sectoral perspectives to \nmaximize the benefits of potential interventions.  \n(iv)  Implementation. Construction supervision and quality control require rigorous attention, \nas  poor  construction  quality  affects  maintenance  requirements  and  discourages \nbeneficiary  involvement  in  O&M.  Effective  oversight  mechanism  of  the  construction \nprocess should be established.  \n(v)  O&M. O&M activities need to be planned early in the project cycle and must involve and \ntrain beneficiaries. Project designs must recognize agency capacity to support O&M, and \nbeneficiary contributions need to be collected before any commitment to proceed with \nconstruction. Finally, farmers are more likely to contribute to O&M if the level of service \nis high. \n(vi)  Management. The commitment of executing agencies to the poverty agenda must be \nstrengthened. Management information systems are important and project designs need \nto clearly spell out arrangements for coordinated support from government agencies. \nDisaster  rehabilitation  projects  require  rapid  preparation  and  simple  disbursement \narrangements to provide timely relief to affected populations. ", "  Appendix 2  27 \n6.  Recent Policy and Institutional Reforms. In recent years, the Government has been \nmaking steady progress in establishing a comprehensive policy, planning, institutional, and legal \nframework for the water sector. The National Water Policy (NWP) was approved in 1999, \nadopting  the  principles  of  integrated  water  resources  management  with  due  emphasis  on \nstakeholder participation, strategic planning, decentralization, sound management of social and \nenvironmental issues, sustainable O&M through management transfer to water management \nassociations  (WMAs),  and  transparency  and  accountability  of  sector  institutions.  BWDB \ninstitutional  reforms  have  also  been  initiated,  which  include  (i)  structuring  of  the  Board  of \ndirectors  to  include  stakeholder  representatives  to  decide  on  policy  issues;  (ii)  long-term \nassignment of leadership; (iii) staff reduction; and (iv) diversification of skill mix. The reform also \nenvisages transforming regional entities into autonomous boards with a similar participatory \nsetup.  On  the  legal  and  regulatory  side,  the  national  water  act  is  under  preparation  to \ncomprehensively govern the utilization and management of water. Guidelines for participatory \nwater management (GPWM) have also been finalized, stipulating the management transfer and \nlocal participation arrangements in water resources schemes. The Government also recently \nprepared the national water management plan (NWMP), which lays out national and regional \nstrategies and priority programs for the next 25 years. \n \n7.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  played  a  key  role  in  promoting  these  sector \nreforms.  Specifically,  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  small-scale  water  resources  subsector1 \nencouraged the Government to decentralize the management of small-scale schemes to local \ngovernment institutions and WMAs, which was adopted in the NWP. The procedures and \narrangements  developed  under  the  project  were  also  used  as  a  model  for  GPWM.  The \nassistance in the Command Area Development Project2 is also establishing and putting into \noperation the participatory water management framework for large flood control, drainage, and \nirrigation (FCDI) schemes as a leading model to apply the key NWP principles, including full \ncost recovery of irrigation O&M by WMAs, and a transparent and accountable joint management \nframework of the Government and stakeholders.

33 \nPROJECT ALTERNATIVES \n \n \n1.  Background.  The  River  Erosion  Prevention  and  Morphology  Study,  prepared  in \nNovember 2000, comprised a prefeasibility study for several bank protection and mitigation \nmeasures. Under the current study, a further options assessment was undertaken. Conventional \nstructures such as revetments with deep setting level with hard and/or interconnected materials \nand high spurs were found to be far more expensive than other options and had low economic \nreturn and high maintenance costs. While low permeable spurs were identified as a potential \nalternative, the piling alone showed to cost three times more than the low solid spurs and was \nconsequently dropped. The following options were taken forward for the feasibility study: \n(i)  without project,  \n(ii)  embankment retirement (inward shifting of embankment), \n(iii)  riverbank protection by revetment, \n(iv)  riverbank protection by low solid spur. \n \n2.  Without  Project.  In  the  without-project  scenario,  river  erosion  will  continue.  The \nestimated loss of land by river erosion over the last 10 years is 1,358 hectares (ha) in Pabna \nIrrigation and Rural Development Project (PIRDP) and 416 ha in Meghna-Dhonagoda Irrigation \nProject (MDIP). With the expected average erosion rate over the next 30 years, it is estimated \nthat 3,002 ha will be eroded in PIRDP and 2,242 ha in MDIP. Some of the erosion at the project \nsites  is  expected  to  cause  sediment  deposition  and  generation  of  new  land  elsewhere. \nHowever, newly accreted land is of low value and generally takes up to 20 years before it \nbecomes productive. \n3.  In a without-project scenario, the embankment will be breached to inundate the project \narea, damaging the terrestrial and aquatic environment. Annual floods will reduce agricultural \nproduction  by  approximately  11%  in  PIRDP  and  39%  in  MDIP.  Flooding  will  also  have  a \nnegative impact on water supply, sanitation, and health. The floodplains will revert to supporting \naquatic life during the flood season, which will have a significant impact on fisheries and culture \nfish production. A considerable part of the production capacity of the pond culture will be lost, \nwhile the capture fishery can be reinstated. However, on the whole, the increase in fisheries \nproduction in PIRDP will be minimal.  \n4.  Embankment Retirement. Under an embankment retirement scenario (as well as the \nwithout-project  scenario)  continued  river  erosion  will  accelerate  the  cycle  of  environmental \ndegradation in the project area, where people displaced by erosion move to remaining marginal \nland, causing further deterioration of natural resources and reduction of terrestrial biodiversity in \nMDIP and PIRDP. \n5.  In PIRDP, over the past 15 years at least 2,500 households have lost their homestead \nlands to river erosion and been forced to move, some to the embankment. In the next 30 years, \naround 7,000 households could be lost in PIRDP as a result of erosion including the 2,425 living \noutside the embankment and others just on and behind it. In MDIP, over the past 15 years, \nabout 4,000 households are estimated to have lost their homesteads, of which about 600 are \nsquatting on and along the embankment. Another 2,900 households or so have migrated to the \nproject area, and about 500 to the opposite side of the rivers. In the next 30 years, 5,450 \nhouseholds could be lost due to bank retreat as a result of erosion.  \n ", "34  Appendix 5 \n6.  Riverbank Protection and Comparative Assessment. Riverbank protection through \nrevetment and low spurs intends to stabilize the riverbank following an \u201cadaptive approach\u201d to \nprotect  and  stabilize  the  riverbank  along  smooth  alignments  that  are  parallel  to  the  river \nsystems. By using sand-filled graded geotextile bags, it can be implemented at about half the \ncost  of  conventional  hard  materials.  This  option  was  compared  to  the  without-project  and \nembankment retirement scenarios using a multicriterion analysis including economic, social, \nand  environmental  consequences.  (See  a  summary  of  alternatives  analysis  in  Table  A5.)               \nThe overall analysis shows that embankment retirement is cheaper than riverbank protection. \nHowever,  embankment  retirement  entails  significant  social  disruption  and  environmental \nimpacts associated with continued loss of agriculture and homestead land and dislocation of \n28,000 people in the next 10 years, which make this choice socially unattractive. The financial \ncost of embankment retirement for the two subprojects in the 30-year project life is estimated at \n$44.1 million against the revetment option of $78.9 million. However, the cost of embankment \nretirement does not include the lost income opportunities of those who lose their land due to \nriver erosion, estimated at $52.7 million valued at the present market price. \n7.  Embankment retirement is also not practical as mitigation measures are urgently needed \nin  the  project  area  to  cope  with  river  erosion,  and  in  view  of  (i)  strong  opposition  by \nstakeholders; (ii) lack of social safety nets accepted by the stakeholders (who request full \ncompensation of lost assets) and the Government (which does not compensate loss of assets \ndue  to  the  natural  phenomenon  of  river  erosion);  and  (iii)  time-consuming  procedural \nrequirements for land acquisition and resettlement, and provision of necessary social safety \nnets. Embankment retirement is also generally used as a rehabilitation rather than protective \nmeasure  against  flood  damage.1  If  the  retired  embankment  is  not  constructed  before  the \nexisting embankment is undercut by erosion in PIRDP and MDIP, the economic viability of the \nembankment retirement will be significantly undermined due to substantial inundation damage, \ndeterioration  of  cropping  patterns  due  to  loss  of  confidence  among  farmers,  and  added \nrehabilitation costs.  \n8.  Public Consultation. Having thoroughly evaluated the alternative from a multicriterion \nperspective, the Government and ADB consulted the major stakeholders, representatives of the \nconcerned central and local governments and nongovernment organizations, and national and \ninternational experts. A consensus emerged that embankment retirement should be avoided \ndue to its highly adverse social impacts as long as an economically feasible alternative exists.  \n9.  Selected Design Option. While the two riverbank-protection options have similar costs \nand economic returns, the low-spur option is viable where the riverbed is shallow and deep \nscours are far from the bank, which is not the case in PIRDP. The low-spur option is less \nadaptive and flexible than revetment and does not allow for phased construction in response to \nmorphological  developments:  all  the  spurs  should  be  constructed  at  once.  Consequently, \nriverbank protection option by revetment was chosen as the selected design option for the \nProject.    \n                                                 \n1  Similar erosion-induced embankment breach occurred in 1997 in PIRDP, after which about 8 kilometers of retired \nembankment was constructed by the Government.  \n ", "   \nMULTICRITERION ANALYSIS OF OPTIONS FOR AVERAGE RATES OF EROSION \nTable A5: Options and Criteria for Average Rate of Erosion \n  PIRDP  MDIP \nItem  Do  Riverbank Protection  Retireda  Do  Riverbank Protection  Retireda \nNothing  Revetment  Low Solid  Embankment Nothing  Revetment  Low Solid  Embankment\nSpur \nSpur \nFinancial Capital Cost over 30 years ($ million) -  47.6  48.2  23.7  -  31.3  34.7  20.4 \nEconomic  Economic Net Present Value ($ million)  -26.0    3.7    3.0   9.3    -44.9  13.2  10.7  15.4 \nCriteria \nEIRR       15.8%     12.5%  b          31.4%      23.4%  b \nPhysical  Air  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 \nEnvironment \nSoils  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 \nPhysiography  -3  0  0  -2  -3  0  0  -2 \nRiver Hydrology and Morphology  0  -1  -1  0  0  -1  -1  0 \nSurface Water Quality  -2   -1  -1  -1  -2   -1  +1  -1 \nGround Water  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 \nBiological  Aquatic Ecosystem  +2  -1  -1  0  +2  -1   -1  0 \nEnvironment \nTerrestrial Ecosystem  - 2  +2  +2  -2  -2  +2  +2  -2 \nEndangered Species  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 \nHuman and  Land Use and Settlement  - 3  +2  +2  -2  -3  +2  +2  -2 \nEconomic \nWater Supply and Sanitation  - 3  +1  +1  -1  -3  +1  +1  -1 \nDevelopment \nAgricultural Productivity  - 3  +2   +2  -1  -3  +2   +2  -1 \nFish Culture  - 3  +2  +2  -1  -3  +2  +2  -1 \nNavigation  - 1  0  0  0  -1  0  0  0 \nQuality-of-Life Way of Life and Equity  - 3  +2  +2  -1  -3  +2  +2  -1 \nValues \nIncome and Poverty  - 3  +2  +2  -1  -3  +2  +2  -1 \nHealth and Education  - 2  +1  +1  -1  -2  +1  +1  -1 \nResettlement  Cost of Resettlement ($ million)    1.18  0.59  5.4    0.64  0.32  5.2 \nCriteria \nRelocation of Household (hh)  7,000  86  26  7,000  5,450  3  1  5,450 \nMarket Price of Eroded Land ($ million)   26.0  -  -  26.0  26.7  -  -  26.7 \nExcluded from Financial Cost \nErosion-and Flood-Affected People(no.)  540,000  430  130  35,000  210,000  15  5  17,000 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, hh = households, MDIP = Meghna-Dhonagoda Irrigation Project, PIRDP = Pabna Irrigation and Rural Development \nProject \nNote  0 = not significant   -2 = moderate negative impact  +1 = small benefit \n  -1= small negative impact  -3 = major negative impact  +2 = moderate benefit \na  Financial cost and EIRR of this option does not include the cost of social safety nets for those who will be displaced by river erosion. \nb  Maximum EIRR of 30.9% and 72.0% could be achieved if this option is successfully implemented before ongoing erosion process undercuts the existing \nembankments.

Introduction \n \n1.  In the economic analysis, the economic costs and benefits of the proposed erosion \nmitigation works, i.e., geotextile bag revetment, were evaluated in Pabna Irrigation and Rural \nDevelopment Project (PIRDP) and Meghna-Dhonagoda Irrigation Project  (MDIP) for a project \nlife of 30 years, including the construction period. The costs and benefits were expressed in \nconstant 2002 prices, and valued using the world price numeraire method. All taxes and duties \nwere excluded in deriving the economic values. The financial costs of traded goods were \nadjusted to their respective values using the standard conversion factor of 0.9 and a shadow \nwage rate of 0.85 for agricultural labor and 0.84 for construction labor are used. In the case of \nmajor tradable commodities, economic values are based on border parity pricing. These price \ndata were obtained from the recently completed National Water Management Plan study with \nsome adjustment in accordance with the local conditions based on the benefit monitoring and \nevaluation data collected under the Command Area Development Project (CADP).  \n \nB.  Economic Costs of Project \n \n2.  The capital investment and recurrent costs required for the Project were compiled and \nthen distributed over 6-years in accordance with the proposed phasing of the Project before \nbeing valued in economic prices. Economic conversion factors were applied to the financial cost \nestimates to derive the economic costs of the various project components. The economic capital \ncosts of the Project were estimated at $43.3 million. The economic costs of the immediate \nworks undertaken in May-July 2002, amounting to $2.67 million, were also included in the \neconomic analysis as they are an integral part of the future erosion mitigation measures. Further \nbank stabilization works were also assumed to be required during the life of the Project to \nensure no breaches in the embankments result from erosion. The works were estimated at \n$11.9 million for PIRDP, and $9.7 million for MDIP.  \n  \nC.  Benefits of Riverbank Stabilization \n \n3.  Project benefits were derived by assessing the avoidance of economic losses in the \nfuture without-project (FWO) scenario, as a result of land erosion and loss of flood protection \nbenefits  due  to  annual  flooding  caused  by  a  breach  in  the  embankment.  Expected  future \ncropping pattern change and culture fishery development promoted under the CADP were also \nincluded  as  the  benefit  associated  with  protection  of  flood  embankments  through  bank \nprotection in the future with-project situation.1 Specific benefits and methodology of estimating \nthose benefits are summarized as follows.  \n \n4.   Economic Loss of Land due to Erosion. The rates of erosion of the riverbank at the \nPIRDP  and  MDIP  sites  have  been  estimated  from  the  morphological  trend  analysis.  The \ncategories of land under threat from erosion include (i) agricultural land (inside and outside the \nembankment), (ii) water bodies, (iii) settlement land (house plots), (iv) industry and markets, and \n(v) public buildings and infrastructure (flood control drainage and irrigation under CADP and \nthose managed by Local Government Engineering Department). These were valued at net \npresent value (NPV) of production for agricultural land and water bodies, and NPV of rental \n                                                 \n1  The rate of adoption of high-yielding rice varieties in the monsoon season is low in PIRDP, in association with the \nlack of confidence among farmers in the stability of embankments demonstrated when erosion induced an \nembankment breach in 1997. Successful bank stabilization is expected to address this constraint.   \n ", "52  Appendix 12 \nprice for settlement land, industry and markets at 12% discount rate. The average capital costs \nwere estimated for the loss of the last category of land. The economic costs of household \nrelocation were also included as avoided loss in the analysis, comprising (i) transport to a new \nlocation, (ii) development of a new homestead, and (iii) temporary crop losses. \n \n5.  Economic Loss due to Flooding in the Future Without-Project (FWO) Scenario. On \nthe basis of the assessment of morphological trends and the remaining distance between the \nflood embankments and bank lines, the embankments in PIRDP and MDIP were assumed to \nbreach in the 2002 and 2003 monsoon season, respectively, under FWO, causing damage to \naman crops. On the basis of the land elevation distribution pattern, present cropping pattern, \npotential  flood  levels  and  their  impacts  on  standing  crops,  and  past  inundation  records, \nembankment breach was assumed to reduce the yields of three varieties of aman crops: \ntraditional broadcast by 10%, improved transplant by 30%, and high-yielding variety (HYV) by \n65% in PIRDP in its irrigation command. An embankment breach would reduce yields by 25%, \n60%, and 80% in MDIP, where most agricultural land is under more than 1.8 meters of water. A \n30% decline in transplant and HYV aman was anticipated in PIRDP areas outside the irrigation \ncommand. In subsequent years, it is estimated that the farmers will immediately adjust the \ncropping pattern to the flood regimes. Accordingly, more moderate annual damage of 5-10% \nwas estimated as aman crop damages due to annual flooding.  \n \n6.  About 50% of the culture fishery ponds were estimated to lose 50% of production in the \nyear of the breach; 20% of the ponds would lose 50% in subsequent years due to annual \ninundation.  About  25%  of  the  settlement  and  infrastructure  area  within  PIRDP  irrigation \ncommand and MDIP would be severely damaged by floods due to their high velocity and wave \naction. The valuation of this damage was based on (i) an average of 20% of the full economic \nreplacement cost of the damaged structure that corresponds to estimates used in the Flood \nAction Plan studies in rural areas, and (ii) actual damage caused by inundation in PIRDP in \n1997 for pourashava areas. An average of 5% of the full replacement cost was assumed for \nsubsequent years. Finally, these losses were offset by probable annual flood damage under \nfuture-with-Project case, estimated at 5% of the damage in the initial year of breach, taking into \naccount the 5% probability (once in 20 years) of such event.   \n \n7.  Loss of Agricultural Income due to Cropping Pattern Difference between Future \nWithout-Project (FWO) and Future With-Project Scenarios. The cropping patterns for PIRDP \nand MDIP in these scenarios were derived from CADP project documents and estimates by \nCADP agricultural staff and consultants of present trends and likely changes in future crop \nareas. The analysis assumed that cropping patterns would be improved over 10 years; the \nareas would then remain constant.  \n \n8.  Loss of Fishery Income due to Land Use Difference between Future Without-\nProject (FWO) and Future With-Project. The areas of fisheries in the present and FWO  \nscenarios were derived in a similar manner as the agricultural area. The FWO scenario shows \nthat capture fisheries areas in PIRDP and MDIP will expand in the floodplain. However, this \nexpansion is anticipated to be offset by a decline in culture fisheries production due to the \ndecline in fishponds caused by annual flooding and inundation. In a future with-project scenario \nthe current expansion in culture fisheries is anticipated to continue in PIRDP and MDIP and \nlevel off after the 10th year.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 12  53 \nD.  Economic Viability \n \n9.  The economic analysis was undertaken over 30 years time to reflect the economic life of \nthe  erosion  mitigation  works  under  satisfactory  maintenance.  The  incremental  net  benefit \nstreams were derived from the cost-and-benefit streams to calculate the EIRR, which was \nestimated at 16.7% for PIRDP and 31.4% for MDIP. Most of the benefit is the prevented flood \ndamage and associated deterioration of cropping patterns, followed by prevented loss of land \ndue to erosion. In PIRDP, great benefits are expected as a result of the increased planting of \nhigh-yielding rice varieties as farmers\u2019 confidence in the stability of embankment, which was \ngreatly lessened after the 1997 breach, would be restored. The EIRR for PIRDP is lower due to \nthe longer sections of the riverbanks that have to be protected under the Project and the deeper \ndesign scour depth.2 \n \n10.  Sensitivity analysis was undertaken for PIRDP and MDIP to test the economic viability of \nthe proposed erosion mitigation works against various changes in the cost-and-benefit streams. \nIn general, the results of this sensitivity analysis (Table A12) show that the viability of the project \nis sensitive to adverse changes in the overall cost-and-benefit stream parameters, particularly a \nreduction in the benefits from avoiding flooding from a breach.  \n \nTable A12: Results of Sensitivity Analysis \nPIRDP  MDIP \nChange in Costs and Benefits \nEIRR  EIRR \nBase case  16.7%  31.4% \n10% decrease in overall project benefits  12.9%  26.7% \n20% reduction in incremental benefits from present  14.0%  30.3% \n10% increase in capital and recurrent costs  13.2%  27.1% \n20% increase in cost of erosion mitigation worksa  12.6%  26.4% \nProtection of unprotected bank line sections brought  13.1%  27.5% \nforward to 2009-2011b \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, MDIP = Meghna-Dhonagoda Irrigation Project,  \n  PIRDP = Pabna Irrigation and Rural Development Project. \n  a  In addition to the built-in contingencies of over 23%. \nb  In the base case, the protection of these sections is envisaged in 2022=2024 in PIRDP (for a total of 3.4 \nkilometers [km] and in 2012, 2017, 2022, and 2027 in MDIP (4.4 km), based on the morphological trend \nanalysis. \n \n11.  The economic and sensitivity analyses indicate that an investment in MDIP is fairly \nrobust and will remain viable under all scenarios, whereas in PIRDP, investment is relatively \nvulnerable, although it remains viable in all sensitivity analysis cases. However, PIRDP has a \nsignificantly higher poverty incidence than the national average, with a high poverty impact ratio \n(Appendix 13) that would justify the investment. The benefit estimate excluded the avoidance of \ninjuries, loss of household assets, livestock and machinery, as well as the indirect benefits \ngenerated by increased agricultural production promoted under CADP, such as processing \nand/or trading of agricultural inputs and products, and other associated nonfarm activities, which \nwill also be lost under the FWO scenario. The EIRRs, therefore, provide conservative estimates \nof the true economic, social, and poverty reduction benefits of the Project. \n                                                 \n2  30 meters (m) below low water level (LWL) as against 20 meters below LWL in MDIP, in response to the deeper \nscour depth observed in the Jamuna River.    \n ", "54  Appendix 13 \nSUMMARY POVERTY ANALYSIS AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national priority in country  Sector identified as a national priority in country poverty \npoverty analysis?  Yes  partnership agreement?  Yes \nContribution of the sector/ subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh \nPoverty remains a serious problem, with 44.3% of the population of over 130 million living under the poverty line in \n2000. This poverty line is measured using a food poverty line on the basis of a basket of food that satisfies the \nminimum daily intake of 2,122 kilocalories (kcal) of energy per person, with the lower \u201chardcore\u201d poverty line \ncorresponding to an intake of 1,805 kcal; 20.0% of the population falls under the latter hardcore poverty line.  \nGiven that over 80% of the poor live in rural areas and engage in agriculture and related nonfarm activities, \nenhancing agricultural and rural development is a key to reduce poverty in the country. For the rural poor, access to \nand control of water is of fundamental importance as it is the foundation for many livelihood activities, including \nagriculture, inland and coastal fishing, transportation, and water supply. Improving water resource management has \nbeen given high priority in the Poverty Partnership Agreement between the Government and the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). \nAmong the water sector challenges, riverbank erosion is one of the most critical challenges with significant poverty \nimplications. Annually, this natural phenomenon displaces an estimated 100,000 people, most of whom are extremely \npoor, and deprived of assets and move to riverine fringe land, embankments, and urban slums. The Project aims to \nestablish cost-effective and sustainable measures and institutions to manage the process in the context of Pabna \nIrrigation and Rural Development Project (PIRDP) and Meghna-Dhonagoda Irrigation Project (MDIP), which could be \nreplicated nationwide to address this critical subsector challenge. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \nOverall Status and Causes. Socioeconomic surveys undertaken during the project preparatory stage suggest that \nthe incidence of poverty in PIRDP is 52.8% and in MDIP, 47.1% (including flood protection command and areas \nbetween the embankments and the bank lines). The causes of poverty in these areas are multidimensional. Poverty \nencompasses both income and nonincome dimensions such as education, health and nutrition, and empowerment. \nDeprivations of education, health, and nutrition are closely associated with income, but others such as voicelessness \nand insecurity are not linked in the same degree.    \nIn PIRDP and MDIP, the distribution of resources such as land is highly skewed. The landless account for about 62% \nof total households, and marginal households for 74%. As these areas are erosion-prone, a large number of \nhouseholds lost their homesteads, cultivable land, and other assets. Most remained in the area, adding to the number \nof poor households. The traditional social and local power structures excluded the poor from participation in  political \nand social processes. The critical issues are lack of income as well as human development such as education, health \nand nutrition, and social exclusion of the poor and women. The project area does not have any indigenous peoples. \nEconomic and Social Impacts. The Project will provide a range of economic and noneconomic benefits. Economic \nbenefits mainly include (i) avoided loss of lands and household assets in the riverine front, which would otherwise be \nlost to erosion; (ii) protection and enhancement of agricultural and fishery production within the flood embankments in \nparticular and areas outside and along the bank line; and (iii) more jobs due to increased economic activities and \nconstruction works during the Project. Noneconomic and social benefits include (i) increased security of population, \nlivestock, and assets; and (ii) establishment and strengthening of local institutions that will take a socially inclusive \nand participatory approach covering diverse stakeholders, including establishment of an institution to promote the \nlivelihood of the erosion-displaced and most vulnerable population.  \nImpacts on Employment. While the economic benefits of the Project tend to be distributed proportionately to the \nlandholding size of the households, those with fewer assets will also benefit from project-related jobs. The Project is \nestimated to provide incremental agricultural jobs amounting to 460,000 labor days per annum in PIRDP and 610,000  \nin MDIP, or about Tk960 per landless and Tk1,280 per marginal farm household. Labor-intensive bank protection \nwork will generate about 5.1 million labor days during the investment period in PIRDP, and 3.1 million during that of \nMDIP. A total of 200,000 labor days will be required for annual operation and maintenance (O&M) activities.1  \nDistribution of Project Benefits. As a part of the economic and financial analysis, the distribution of project benefits \namong stakeholders was analyzed, including an assessment to determine the extent to which the Project directly \nbenefits the poor. The economic analysis showed that benefits to households were derived from land erosion, \n                                                 \n1  Nonagricultural employment increased by about 1.4 million in PIRDP and 1.0 million labor days in MDIP between \n1996 and 2001, which may be accrued to flood protection and irrigation in the project area.    \n ", "  Appendix 13  55 \navoided flood damage, and increased agricultural and fishery development. During construction, laborers will benefit \nfrom jobs in labor-intensive riverbank protection works. The public sector will gain tax incomes, but will have to bear \nmost of the costs of investment. Tables A13.1 to A13.2 present the results of the distribution analysis. Overall, the \npoor may attain a total of about 45% of the direct and indirect project benefits in PIRDP, and 42% of those of MDIP  \nwhen crop and fishery production, family and hired agricultural labor, and construction labor benefits are taken into \naccount. These benefits will be lost due to erosion under the without-project scenario.   \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis prepared.  Yes  \nThe public was substantially involved in the project preparatory process. It was carried out in two rounds, the first \nthrough focus group discussions with smaller groups of homogeneous stakeholders in the area (i) inside and outside \nthe embankment directly threatened by riverbank erosion, (ii) outside the embankment not threatened by bank \nerosion, and (iii) inside the embankment benefited from flood control, drainage and irrigation (FCDI) facilities. On the \nbasis  of  focused  group  discussions,  the  second  round  was  held  in  the  form  of  local  workshops  involving \nrepresentatives from the central and local governments, water management associations (WMAs), and civil society. \nThe process generally revealed that (i) river erosion protection is strongly favored against retiring the embankments; \n(ii) nonstructural measures were identified as beneficial; (iii) people\u2019s representation in WMAs and union parishad and \ninvolvement of NGOs was considered important in implementing the riverbank protection works along with the \nBangladesh Water Development Board; and (iv) local people are willing to contribute to mitigating river erosion by \npaying irrigation service fees, taxes on fish culture, and tolls on traffic and on market places; and in kind such as \nphysical labor, and supply of food, shelter, and materials (bamboo, sacks, etc.). \nParticipation Strategy/ Poverty and Social Development Strategy.  Yes \n(i)  Targeted Interventions to the Erosion-displaced Poor. Over 10,000 people in PIRDP and MDIP who were \ndisplaced by river erosion now live on the riverine fringe, particularly on the flood embankments, as illegal squatters. \nThey are mostly landless and poor, with over 70% living below the poverty line, have very limited physical assets, and \nearn daily wages, or are self-employed. With the engagement of experienced NGOs, the Project, under its social \ndevelopment subcomponent, will organize this most vulnerable population, specifically targeting female-headed and \nother low-income groups to stimulate their self-help efforts.2  \n(ii)  Enhancing Socially Inclusive Participatory Water Management. In line with the 1999 National Water Policy, \nwhich promotes participatory and comprehensive management of water, the Project will establish Joint Management \nCommittees (JMCs) to play key roles in decision making on water resources management, including riverbank \nerosion management, irrigation and drainage, and agricultural and fishery development. The Project\u2019s institutional \nstrengthening component will focus on developing a firm institutional basis to affiliate stakeholder institutions such as \nWMAs.  Their  membership  status  will  be  substantially  strengthened  through  involvement  of  consultants, \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  community-based  organizers  (CBOs).  JMC  will  also  include \nrepresentatives of the diverse stakeholders, including the most vulnerable groups. JMCs and subproject management \noffices (SMOs) will also form an emergency riverbank protection group (ERPG) to provide labor for emergency works \nduring the flood season. ERPG representatives will also participate in construction quality assurance, e.g., throughout \nthe JMC subcommittee for joint construction inspection. \n(iii) Gender Strategy and Actions. The Project will try to increase the participation and role of women in WMAs, \nand JMCs. With the help of consultants, NGOs, and CBOs, the Project\u2019s nonstructural mitigation and institutional-\nstrengthening components will (i) set up a special network for women members of these stakeholder institutions, (ii) \nestablish numerical targets for enrollment of female members and engagement of female laborers for earthwork and \nother project-related activities, and (iii) provide special training for women-only groups through WMAs. Gender-\nspecific monitoring indicators will be identified and gender-relevant information included and documented in the \nProject\u2019s management information system to be developed with the consultants.  \n(iv) Engagement of the Poor as Construction Labor. To place sand-filled geotextile bags in the river channel, the \nProject will require an estimated 1.4 million labor days per annum during the implementation or over 50% of the total \nagricultural jobs in the project area. To ensure the highest benefit to the poor, the local population, in particular poor \nand vulnerable, will be engaged as construction labor for the works, for which wage rates will be fixed transparently.  \n \n \n                                                 \n2 Through a Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction project that has been submitted to the Government of Japan for \napproval, they will be given further opportunities to engage in routine maintenance of water resources facilities and \nincome-generating activities using those facilities. Information and resource centers (IRCs) will be established in \nPIRDP and MDIP to support activities such as information sharing, a community-wide campaign, training, with the \ninvolvement of community representatives to sustain the institution after project completion and with contributions \nfrom beneficiaries. \n ", "56  Appendix 13 \nD.

Resettlement Framework for the Riverbank Protection Works \n \n1.  Scope  and  Impact.  The  resettlement  framework  includes  the  framework  for  the \nproposed 7.0 km and 4.4 km of protection work for the flood embankments along the Jamuna \nand Meghna rivers in Pabna Irrigation and Rural Development Project (PIRDP) and Meghna-\nDhonagoda Irrigation Project (MDIP) respectively, to protect the project area from progressive \nriver erosion. The revetment works will be implemented over 6 years. The total amount of land \nacquired for revetment is estimated at 35 hectares (ha) in PIRDP and 22 ha in MDIP, which will \nbe eroded without project intervention. Their exact locations and impacts have to be reviewed \nand finalized during the final design stage, when the alignments for the protection works will be \ndecided based on morphological development. Project implementation is expected to start in the \nfirst quarter of 2003.  \n \n2.  Resettlement Policy. Resettlement will be implemented in accordance with the policy \non involuntary resettlement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and following the passage of \nthe (i) Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property (ARIP) Ordinance 1982; and (ii) East \nBengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act (1951, revised 1994).    \n \n3.  Resettlement Principles, Entitlements, and Procedures. The resettlement framework \napplies to all involuntary resettlement effects, including displacement of nontitled people, arising \nfrom land acquisition or conversion, or any other effects that result from project works on the \nfloodplain, bank line, and any other land affected by the Project, including that required for \nembankment work and char lands lost due to the project works. Those affected will be helped to \nmaintain at least their standard of living at preproject level. All losses, including of land, crops, \ntrees, structures, business, employment, and workdays and wages, will be fully compensated, \nincluding those incurred by nontitled people. The owners of land acquired for protection work, \nincluding bank line and eroded land within the 50-meter right-of-way acquisition, will be fully \ncompensated.  Affected  households  will  receive  (i)  an  additional  cash  grant  to  match \nreplacement value to supplement the grant provided by the deputy commissioner, and (ii) other \nresettlement assistance such as shifting allowances and compensation for loss of workdays \nand/or income due to dislocation. Female-headed and other vulnerable households will be \neligible for further cash assistance for relocation and house reconstruction. People involuntarily \ndisplaced, including nontitled people, will receive priority assistance under the Project\u2019s social \ndevelopment subcomponent. \n \n4.  Institutional  Responsibilities  and  Procedures.  The  project  management  office \n(PMO), under the responsibility of the chief resettlement and environmental management officer \nat  the  rank  of  executive  engineer,  has  overall  planning,  financing,  and  supervisory \nresponsibilities for resettlement plan preparation and implementation to be carried out by the \nsubproject management offices (SMOs) with designated resettlement and social development \nofficer. PMO will engage experienced NGO and consultants to assist the process. Each year, \nupon identification of the bank lines for protection after the monsoon season, the following \nprocedures are to be carried out: (i) PMO will undertake impact assessment surveys based on \ntechnical designs; and (ii) depending on the significance of the impacts, PMO will prepare full or \nshort  resettlement  plans  for  the  protected  section,  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \ninvoluntary resettlement and other social safeguard guidelines. The full or short resettlement \nplans will be submitted to ADB for approval, and people affected should be fully compensated \nbefore award of the relevant civil works contracts. BWDB will ensure that resettlement budgets \n ", "  Appendix 21  59 \nare delivered on time to the deputy commissioner\u2019s office and the implementing nongovernment \norganization (NGO) for timely resettlement plan implementation.  \n \n5.  Disclosure, Consultation and Grievances. Each resettlement plan will be prepared \nand  implemented  in  close  consultation  with  the  stakeholders  and  will  involve  focus  group \ndiscussions  and  meetings,  particularly  with  the  project  affected  persons.  Copies  of  draft \nresettlement plan will be distributed among NGOs and community groups prior to finalizing the \nengineering  design.  A  grievances  redress  committee  (GRC)  will  be  established  with \nrepresentatives from PMO, affected persons, women and vulnerable groups, local government, \nand NGOs. The chief resettlement officer will chair the GRC. Other than disputes relating to \nownership rights under the court of law, GRC will review grievances involving all resettlement \nbenefits,  relocation,  and  other  assistance.  Any  grievances  submitted  to  the  GRC  will  be \nresolved within 2\u20133 weeks. \n \n6.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  Bangladesh  Water  Development  Board  (BWDB)  will \nestablish a monthly monitoring system involving PMO, SMOs and implementing NGO staff, and \nprepare  progress  reports  on  all  aspects  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  social \ndevelopment efforts and outcomes. External monitoring will be assigned to an independent local \nexpert and agency and report to BWDB and ADB quarterly. BWDB will also report to ADB on \nland acquisition and resettlement and social development in the quarterly progress report. \n \n7.  Resettlement  Cost.  The  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  estimated  at \nTk109.7 million ($1.91 million) excluding NGO services. The Government will provide the entire \nfund for land acquisition and resettlement, and will guarantee meeting unforeseen obligations in \nexcess of the budget estimate to meet the resettlement objectives.    \n \nB.  Short Resettlement Plan for the Secondary Embankments In PIRDP \n \n8.  Scope and Impacts. The short resettlement plan is associated with the construction of a \n1.2-kilometer  secondary  defense  line  of  embankments  to  protect  some  critical  sections  of \nembankments in PIRDP. The plan will be implemented in 2003. The construction of the second \ndefense line will require acquisition of an estimated 10 hectares. The proposed alignment \nlargely consists of low-lying agricultural land. As a result, the project impact is limited to three \nhouseholds only (18 affected persons). An estimated 30 households will lose limited agricultural \nlands from strip acquisition.  \n \n9.  Resettlement Policy. Resettlement will be in accordance with the ARIP Ordinance and \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. \n \n10.  Stakeholder Consultation and Entitlements. During the project preparatory stage, a \nconsultation  was  held  covering  the  secondary  defense  line  area.  The  feedback  and \nobservations made at the stakeholders\u2019 meetings have been used in preparing the entitlement \nmatrix  and  project  benefits  for  affected  people.  No  nontitled  people  were  affected.  The \nentitlement matrix recognizes seven types of losses to cover all potential losses, including loss \nof access by tenants (Table A14). \n \n \n \n ", "60  Appendix 21 \n \nTable A14: Entitlement Matrix \nType of Loss  Application   Definition of  Entitlements  Expected Results \nPAPs \n1.
