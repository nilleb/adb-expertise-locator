Inequality of income and \nopportunity  will  be  addressed  through  the  redistributive  role  of  fiscal  policy  in  tax  and  social \nprotection measures.4  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nGrowth  of  the  Georgian  economy  since  the  Rose  Revolution  in  2003  has  averaged \nnearly  6%  annually  during  2004\u20132013,  leading  to  an  increase  in  per  capita  gross  national \nincome by three times in current US dollar terms.5 While Georgia advanced rapidly on the Doing \nBusiness rankings, growth stemmed mainly from capital inflows before the twin crises of 2008 \n(the  global  financial  crisis  and  the  conflict  with  the  Russian  Federation)  and  from  high  public \ncapital  spending  thereafter.  In  2008,  the  crises  sharply  reduced  capital  inflows,  and  private \ninvestment  and growth contracted  by  3.8%  in 2009. The government  launched  countercyclical \nfiscal  measures  to  spur  growth,  increasing  public  expenditure  from  34.0%  of  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP)  in 2007 to 38.4%  in 2009. The fiscal  stimulus paid off,  with growth  rebounding \nand averaging more than 5% during 2010\u20132013.6 The share of foreign direct investment in GDP \ndeclined  from  7.7%  in  2011  to  5.8%  in  2012.  However,  by  the  first  quarter  of  2014  it  had \nincreased to 7.2%.      \n\n \n\nReducing  poverty  and  promoting  shared  growth  remain challenges  in Georgia.  Income \n4. \ndistribution is relatively skewed, with a Gini coefficient of 0.42. Unemployment is still a challenge \ndespite the rapid growth of the economy, and was 14.6% of the labor force in 2013, from 15.0% \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Domestic resource mobilization refers to the generation of savings from domestic resources and their allocation to \nsocially productive investments. The public sector mobilizes domestic resources through public revenue generation \nfor social service and infrastructure investment. The private sector mobilizes the savings of households and firms \nthrough financial intermediaries, which lend for investment in productive activities.   \n\n3 The  proposed  program  is  not  included  in  the  country  operations  business  plan,  2014\u20132016  for  Georgia.  The \nprogram was requested by the government in late 2013, when it asked for programmatic assistance to improve the \nmacrofiscal framework and to increase domestic resource mobilization from public and private resources. \n\n4  International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2014. IMF Policy Paper. Washington, DC. To enhance the role of fiscal policy \nfor  inclusive  growth,  the  paper  recommends  (i)  well-targeted  public  spending  on  social  assistance  programs, \npensions, and infrastructure; and (ii) increased resource mobilization from tax revenue and social contributions.   \n5  Georgia\u2019s gross national income (Atlas method, current dollars) was $3,570 in 2012, approximately three times the \nAsian Development Fund (ADF) eligibility threshold of $1,215. Georgia crossed the ADF eligibility threshold in 2003 \nand  has  remained  above  such  threshold  every  year  since.  As  a  result  and  positive  assessment  of  Georgia\u2019s \ncreditworthiness,  in  August  2014,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Board  of  Directors  approved  the \nreclassification  of  Georgia  as  a  group  C  country  for  accessing  ordinary  capital  resources,  to  be  effective  from  1 \nJanuary 2017. ADB. 2014. Georgia: Review of Classification under ADB\u2019s Graduation Policy. Manila.  \n\n6  IMF. 2013. IMF Country Report No. 13/264. Georgia 2013 Article IV Consultation. Washington, DC. \n\n\fin  2012.  High  unemployment  contributes  to  the  weak  link  between  growth  and  poverty \nreduction.  Average  monthly  incomes  per  household  increased  during  2006\u20132013  from \nGEL385.3  to  GEL887.2,  with  a  corresponding  decline  in  the  relative  poverty  level  (share  of \npopulation  under  60%  of  median  consumption)  from  23.3%  to  21.4%.  Nevertheless,  poverty \nindicators are still high.    \n\n5. \nWith the change in government in 2012, public finances came under pressure because \nof a large increase in social expenditure and limited scope to raise revenues, resulting in a fiscal \ndeficit of 2.6% of GDP in 2013. The deficit is expected to widen to 3.7% in 2014 with a surge in \nsocial  expenditures  and lower  revenues  due  to  the  slowing  of  growth  in  preceding  years.  The \ncomposition  of  central  government  expenditure  will  be  changing  over  time  with  subsidies, \ntransfers,  compensation  of  employees,  and  interest  payments  taking  up  increasing  budget \nshares at the  expense  of goods  and  services. In  2013  public  capital  expenditure,  a significant \ndriver of Georgia\u2019s economic growth during previous years, declined to below 6.0% of GDP from \nthe  2008\u20132011  level  of  7.5%\u20138.0%  due  to  project  implementation  delays.  Weaknesses  have \nbeen identified in the selection, preparation, and appraisal of investment projects.7 Infrastructure \ninvestment  needs,  including  those  emerging  from  decentralization,  will  require  a  strong  public \ninvestment management system to contain fiscal risks and maintain existing infrastructure.  \n \n6. \nMaintaining  sound  macroeconomic  and  prudent  fiscal  management  is  critical  for \ninclusive  growth,  requiring  the  government  to  exercise  expenditure  restraint  as  well  as  to \nincrease revenues. The planned increase in social expenditure in the medium term is consistent \nwith the government\u2019s push for inclusive, equitable growth for all citizens, as well as for gender-\nequitable growth. In this situation, maintaining capital expenditure requires careful prioritization \nfiscal \nimproved  expenditure  efficiency  and  effectiveness \nof  spending  and \nsustainability.  The  government  plans  to  develop  public\u2012private  partnerships  to  leverage  public \nresources and increase private participation, which can also strengthen its fiscal position. \n\nto  ensure \n\nThe  government  confronts  different  types  of  fiscal  risk\u2014macroeconomic,  debt,  and \n7. \ncontingent  liabilities\u2014as  well  as  those  risks  arising  from  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE) \noperations and the finance sector. The present capacity to monitor and deal with these different \nrisks  is  limited.  Recent  reviews  have  put  particular  emphasis  on  the  risks  associated  with  the \nquasi-fiscal operations of SOEs, as some implicit subsidies are not reflected in the budget and \nthe accounts of the central government. The SOE sector in Georgia contributed to 7% of gross \nGDP in 2012, accounting for 24% of total corporate investment.  \n\nTotal public debt amounted to 34.4% of GDP in 2013, of which 27.2% was denominated \n8. \nin  foreign  currency.  Borrowing  procedures  are  generally  well  developed,  but  they  are  poorly \ndocumented  in  case  of  external  borrowing.  A  defined  debt  strategy  is  needed,  as  is  more \ndetailed analysis of external borrowing proposals. Operational risk management procedures are \nwell  developed,  but  documentation  is  again  lacking.  Presently,  debt  management  and  cash \nmanagement  in  Georgia  are  two  separate  activities.  Cash  management  is  weak,  since  the \ngovernment  relies  on  a  non-remunerated  cash  buffer  in  the  National  Bank  of  Georgia,  the \ncentral bank, to ensure that payments can be made when due. In modern treasury management \nthese  two  functions  are  merged  and  managed  by  one  single  entity,  using  financial  market \ninstruments  to  meet  the  government\u2019s  immediate  and  longer-term  cash  needs.  To  reach  this \nstage,  a  two-pronged  approach  is  required:  developing  the  local  financial  markets,  and \nestablishing a modern treasury function in the Ministry of Finance (MOF).  \n \n\n                                                \n7  World Bank. 2013. Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment 2012. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fLocal governments  account for  approximately  7%  of GDP  and for  30% of consolidated \n9. \ngovernment expenditure, with costs increasing steadily since 2012 in real terms and relative to \nGDP.  In  addition  to  the  provision  of  housing,  utilities,  and  communal  services,  local \ngovernments  may  execute  investment  projects  with  allocated  central  funding.  Determinants  of \nfiscal efficiency include appropriate assignment of responsibilities between the different levels of \ngovernment, and the degree of revenue autonomy of the subnational levels. In Georgia, the only \ntax source presently available to local governments is the property tax, and local governments \nconsequently depend heavily on grants from the central government.  \n \n10. \nTax  policy  and  administration  reforms  serve  as  part  of  wider  improvements  of  the \nbusiness  and  investment  climate.  Total  taxes  in  Georgia  amount  to  24.8%  of  GDP,  of  which \nindirect  taxes  make  up  13.6%  and  direct  taxes  11.2%  in  2013.  A  notable  feature  is  the \nconstitutional ban on increasing various tax rates. The Georgia Revenue Service is responsible \nfor collecting taxes for both levels of government as well as customs duties. High levels of old \narrears impair the smooth functioning of tax administration.8 Selective writing-off of tax arrears is \nneeded, with improved capacity for risk analysis to guide audit targeting and current controls.  \n\n \n11. \nPensions constitute the largest social spending item in the state budget, accounting for \n18%  of  public  expenditure  in  2013  and  4%  of  GDP.  This  cost  is  likely  to  increase  over  time \nbecause of  population  aging.  Social  security  is  presently  noncontributory.  The current  pension \nsystem needs revision to ensure both fiscal sustainability and adequate pension levels over the \nmedium term. More expansive and efficient capital markets will be necessary to absorb pension \ninflows  and  allow  pension  funds  to  responsibly  invest  in  equities.  Capital  markets,  including \nmoney markets, can also provide funding for banks and nonbank financial institutions in Georgia \nthrough equity raising and bond issuance. In the design of a new pension system, it is essential \nto take gender issues into account, as women are less likely to work in formal sectors, generally \nearn lower wages, and may perform other nonpaid labor. The current pension eligibility age is \n65 for men and 60 for women, and is paid to all citizens regardless of marital status.  \n\n \n12. \nThe  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  sector  represents  nearly  96%  of  registered \nbusinesses  and  employs  42.0%  of  the  workforce  in  Georgia,  but  accounted  for  only  17.7%  of \nbusiness turnover in 2013. Firms cite high interest rates, risk-averse bank lending policies, and \nabsence  of  venture  capital  as  major  constraints  to  growth.  Small  businesses  currently  rely  on \nowner  resources  or  on  retained  earnings  for  investment.  Poor  development  of  securities  and \ncapital  markets  and  long-term  financial  instruments,  and  reliance  on  a  fully  publicly  funded \npension  scheme,  prevent  higher  savings  rates  and  limit  the  funds  available  for  lending. \nIncreasing  access  to  finance,  especially  for  small  businesses  managed  by  women,  is  an \nimportant  policy  consideration.  Limited  support  for  and  use  of  innovation  and  technology  also \nhampers  small  business  development,  with  Georgia  ranking  73  out  of  142  on  the  World \nEconomic Forum\u2019s Global Innovation Index.   \n \n13. \nThe  Socio-Economic  Development  Strategy  of  Georgia\u2014Georgia  2020\u2014establishes \npolicy directions for sustainable and inclusive economic growth under four pillars. The proposed \nprogram corresponds closely to the four pillars.9 The program also responds to the 2014\u20132016 \n\n                                                \n8  Tax  arrears  have  been accumulating  since  the 1990s; many  businesses owing  the  old  tax  arrears  are  no  longer \noperating. Focusing the collection efforts on active taxpayers and businesses will lower costs and improve results.  \n9  Government of Georgia. 2013. Socio-Economic Development Strategy of Georgia, 2020. Tbilisi. Pillar 1 establishes \nthe  preconditions  for  growth  through  fiscal  efficiency,  sustainable  management  of  public  debt,  financial  stability, \nand  improvement  of  public  policy  management.  Pillar  2  enhances  private  sector  competitiveness  by  improving \nbusiness  and  investment  environment  (especially  for  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises),  strengthening \ninnovation capacities, and developing infrastructure. Pillar 3 addresses human capital issues through development \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nNational  Action  Plan  for  Implementation  of  Gender  Equality  Policy  in  Georgia  that  supports \ngender  equality  in  the  economic  and  finance  sectors. 10 The  program  is  consistent  with  the \ncountry  assistance to  Georgia  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  with  government \npolicy.  The  draft  country  partnership  strategy,  2014\u20132018  is  aligned  with  Georgia 2020, \nfostering inclusive economic growth while enhancing regional connectivity and environmentally \nsustainable growth.11 The country  operations  business plan,  2014\u20132016 for  Georgia  enhances \ninclusive growth by improving access to finance.12 \n \nThe program will enhance inclusive growth options by opening up the fiscal space for the \n14. \ngovernment to meet its planned significant funding of inclusive social and economic services. To \nachieve  this,  the  program  will  support  fiscal  consolidation,  improve  revenue  management, \nstrengthen public  expenditure management,  enhance the generation  of domestic  savings,  and \nincrease private resource mobilization for investment opportunities, especially for  micro, small, \nand  medium-sized  businesses.  The  programmatic  approach  adopted  for  the  program-- \nsequencing  of  reforms  with  the  flexibility  to  incrementally  change  the  reforms  based  on  the \nprogress  achieved--  will  allow  the  government  to  build  on  achievements  and  lessons  from  the \nreforms and to steer the next phase of policy reforms accordingly.  Separate policy and advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) will provide support to the government in the areas of capital market \ndevelopment,  pension  reforms,  public\u2012private  partnerships,  and  public  debt  management. 13 \nThese  actions  help  the  government  to  achieve  its  medium-term  sector  policy  objectives  for \npublic  sector  management  and  finance  sector  development.  Women  will  benefit  from  the \nprogram through targeted financing opportunities for their small businesses, equitable treatment \nin  business  opportunities,  and  pension  reforms.  Relevant  lessons  on  the  need  for  policy \nreforms,  stronger  focus  on  inclusive  growth,  and  longer-term  engagement  in  public  sector \nreforms  have  been  incorporated  from  the  evaluation  findings  of  Georgia\u2019s  country  program \nportfolio.14 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n15. \nThe  program  impact  will  be  citizens,  particularly  women,  benefiting  from  higher  living \nstandards and more employment opportunities. The outcome will be the effective mobilization of \ndomestic  resources for  increased  public  and  private  investment. The  program  will  help  enable \nimproved  fiscal  space,  better  business  opportunities  and  pension  arrangements  for  women, \nmore sustainable social service delivery, and a better environment for economic growth. \n \nC. \n \n16. \nThe program comprises three annual subprograms to support  the government\u2019s reform \ninitiatives as outlined in Georgia 2020 and the national action plan on gender (see footnote 10), \nand  specifically  covers  medium-term  issues  in  the  following  four  areas:  (i)  improving \nmanagement  of  debt,  cash,  and  fiscal  risk;  (ii)  strengthening  revenue  and  public  expenditure \n                                                                                                                                                       \nof a labor-market-oriented workforce, strengthening social security, and ensuring high-quality health care.

Subprogram  1  has  20  policy  actions,  all  of  which  were \ncompleted  by  15  September  2014,  and  there  are  27  and  25  indicative  policy  actions  for \nsubprograms 2 and 3, respectively.15 \n\n \n17. \nOutput 1: Improved management of debt, cash, and fiscal risk. The objective of this \noutput  is  to  strengthen  debt,  cash,  and  fiscal  risk  management.  Debt  management  will  be \nstrengthened by improving relevant government processes, increasing transparency, preparing \nand  implementing  strategies,  amending  legislation  and  developing  analytical  and  forecasting \ncapabilities. Fiscal risk management will be strengthened by drafting a strategy for dealing with \nthe  different  types  of  fiscal  risks  and  conducting  risk  assessments  for  risks,  including  those \nassociated with loan guarantees and other contingent liabilities. The requisite in-house capacity \nwill be developed to monitor such risks on an ongoing basis.  \n \n18. \nSubprogram  1  (i)  established  an  internal  procedures  manual  for  external  borrowing  for \ninvestment  financing  and  budget  support;  (ii)  developed  procedures  manuals  for  public  debt \nservice  processing,  debt  data  recording,  and  validation  for  an  efficient  debt  management  and \nmonitoring  process;  (iii)  put  into  place  a  system  of  regular  website  posting  of  information  on \nprojects and programs financed by external sources covering total loan amounts and disbursed \namounts reflected in the state budget, as well as a statistical bulletin on public debt presenting \noverall  performance,  treasury  securities  issuance,  and  transactions  on  primary  markets;  (iv) \ncarried  out  an  inventory  indicating  the  fiscal  position  of  large  SOEs  and  their  audited  financial \nsituation;  and  (v)  developed  a  strategic  template  for  monitoring  and  dealing  with  all  types  of \nfiscal risk confronting the country. \n \n19. \nSubprograms  2  and  3,  building  on  the  accomplishments  under  subprogram  1,  will \ncontinue to improve management of debt, cash and fiscal risk over a medium term. On the basis \nof  the  newly  prepared  debt  strategy,  the  required  legislative  amendments  will  be  submitted  to \nthe  parliament.  The  debt  management  and  risk  analysis  systems  will  be  upgraded  and  a \nsystematic process developed for tracking debt and loan guarantees and their timely reporting \nin  the  government\u2019s  financial  statements.  A  dedicated  function  will  be  established  to  manage \nfiscal risks from contingent liabilities related to SOEs and public\u2013private partnership projects.  \n \n20. \nOutput  2:  Strengthened  revenue  and  public  expenditure  management.  The \nobjective  of  this  output  is  to  increase  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  revenue  collection, \nimprove public  expenditure  management,  and  strengthen local government finances.  Because \nof lack of internal capacity, the government in the past relied on external tax auditors under the \numbrella  of  the  Alternative  Audit  Program.  Through  increased  recruitment  and  training  efforts, \nthese external auditors will be replaced by in-house tax auditors. Increased efforts will be made \nto  collect  tax  dues  and  arrears,  and  write  off  certain  categories  of  old  tax  liabilities  deemed \nuncollectable  Budgeting  and  budget  execution  functions  of  government  entities  will  be \nincreasingly  integrated  into  the  public  financial  management  system  and  the  treasury  single \naccount. The quality of public capital investments will be improved by strengthening the project \ninvestment framework, especially private sector participation through PPPs.   \n \n21. \nSubprogram 1 (i) implemented strengthened tax collection procedures by establishing a \nnew administrative department; (ii) approved a strategy to reduce the statutory time limit of tax \nnotices  and  taxpayer  notices  incrementally  from  6  years  to  3  years  to  shorten  the  tax  liability \nimposition period and provide relief to taxpayers; (iii) approved an action plan to phase out the \n\n                                                \n15 The policy matrix setting out the policy actions for each of the three subprograms is in Appendix 4. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nAlternative  Audit  Program  and  to  increase  in-house  audit  capacity  in  specialized  sectors;  (iv) \nprepared  amendments  to the  budget code to  allow  the finances  of  local self-governments  and \nlegal  entities  of  public  law  (LEPLs)16 to  be  managed  through  the  public  financial  management \nsystem,  with  payments and receipts  through the  treasury  single  account;  (v)  provided  detailed \nsupplementary  information  on  types  and  funding  of  capital  projects  in  the  state  budget \ndocuments;  and  (vi)  paved  the  way  for  approval  of  the  Local  Self  Governance  Code  by  \nParliament, resulting in reforms in intergovernmental finances including transfers.  \n \nSubprograms 2 and 3 will build on the accomplishments under subprogram 1. Recovery \n22. \nof  arrears  of  at  least  GEL80  million  from  active  taxpayers,  reduction  in  time  limitation  of  tax \nnotices,  and  writing  off  tax  arrears  of  defunct  businesses  on  the  basis  of  legally  approved \ncategories  will  streamline  tax  collection  efforts.  The  cash  operations  of  local  self-governments \nand  LEPLs  (except  schools  and kindergartens)17 will  be  channeled  through  the treasury  single \naccount  and  budgeting  and  accounting  processes  through  the  public  financial  management \nsystem.  The  identification  and  addressing  of  gaps  in  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for \npreparation,  appraisal,  and  implementation  of  public\u2013private  partnership  projects  will  facilitate \nparticipation of the private sector in capital projects. \n\n \n23. \nOutput  3:  Enhanced generation  of  domestic savings. The objective of this output is \nto streamline the government\u2019s universal pension or \u201cpillar zero\u201d18 and to establish a sustainable \nprivate  pension  savings  system  with  quasi-mandatory  elements,  the  so-called  hybrid  or  joint \npillar  combining  elements  of  pillars  2  and  3.19 The  government  will  calculate  the  present  and \nfuture costs of providing universal pensions to its citizens, and devise an improved pension plan \nto make the cost fiscally sustainable. The key areas of the pension structure under the hybrid or \njoint  pillar  will  be  designed  defining  issues  such  as  membership  contributions,  investment  of \nbenefits,  tax  considerations,  beneficiary  arrangements,  and  relationship  with  the  existing  pillar \nzero.  The  introduction  of  pension  plans  is  a  long  and  involved  process  and  needs  careful \nunderstanding  of  the  economic  and  social  environment  of  the  country,  presence  of  capital \nmarkets for investment, and drafting of legislation. The program will develop and launch a public \nawareness and communications campaign that explains the benefits and roles of individuals in \nthe new pension plan, with inclusion of gender aspects.   \n \nSubprogram 1 (i) established a pension reform unit with adequate budget and staff and \n24. \nan  interagency  working group to  devise  a  time-bound  action  plan  to  develop  the  new  pension \nplan, and (ii) issued a public notification on the broad concept and direction of pension reforms, \nboth mandatory and voluntary systems.20 \n \n25. \nSubprograms 2 and 3, building on subprogram 1, will further expand the pension reforms \nby completing the analysis of key areas of pension system design and structure, with revisions \nensuring continuity  of  equitable treatment  of men  and  women. The  individual  reporting, record \n\n                                                \n16 A number of general government functions are carried out by LEPLs. They collect and are allowed to retain income \nfrom services they provide. LEPL finances historically have been managed outside the treasury system. Payments \nby and to them flow through individual accounts held in commercial banks. \n\n17 There are more than 2,000 schools and kindergartens, many of them in remote and rural areas. Integrating these \n\nin the treasury system is costly. The government is exploring options to improve school expenditure efficiency. \n\n18 Pillar zero is the existing universal pension plan of the government. \n19 Pillar  2  is  the  occupational  mandatory  defined  contribution  savings  that  provides  pensions.  Pillar  3  is  voluntary \n\npensions. Hybrid or joint pillar is the term given to a pension plan that combines elements of pillars 2 and 3.  \n\n20 The  interagency  council  for  pension  reform  has  representation  from  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment  (MOESD),  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  Healthcare  and  Social  Affairs \n(MOLHSA), the Office of the State Minister for Diaspora Issues, the National Bank of Georgia (NBG), the Budget \nand Finance Committee of the Parliament, and the National Statistics Office of Georgia.  \n\n\fkeeping,  and  accounts  system  for  the  new  scheme  will  be  developed  and  implemented.  The \nlegislative amendments to the Basic Law on Pensions for the hybrid or joint pillar and to the law \non voluntary savings covering private pensions will be drafted.  \n \nOutput 4: Increased mobilization of private resources for investment. The objective \n26. \nof this output is to develop capital markets to mobilize long-term finance, and to enhance access \nto finance through small-business financing, development, and gender targeting. Capital market \nreforms will include bond market development, legal and regulatory reforms, and money market \ninstruments so they can contribute to pension reforms under output 3.  \n \n27. \nSubprogram 1 (i) built on the policies laid down under Georgia 2020 for the development \nof  financial  intermediation  and  mobilization  of  private  investments;  (ii)  established  an \ninteragency committee and working group to devise a time-bound action plan on capital market \nreform  and  development; 21 (iii)  established  the  Entrepreneurship  Development  Agency  with \nstaffing  and  allocated  budget  of  GEL110  million  for  2014\u20132018;  (iv)  established  the  Georgia \nInnovation  and  Technology  Agency  with  staffing  and  allocated  budget  of  GEL20  million  for \n2014\u20132016; (v) earmarked GEL3 million from its budget for a matching grant facility for micro, \nsmall, and medium-sized businesses with 20% reserved for businesses owned by women; (vi) \nearmarked  GEL2  million  from  its  budget  for  mini  grants  and  innovation  vouchers  for  private \nsector  innovation  and  technology  development  with  20%  reserved  for  businesses  owned  by \nwomen; and (vii) adopted a gender action plan to ensure equal participation of men and women \nin economic and business activities. \n \n28. \nSubprograms 2 and 3, building on subprogram 1, will continue  reforms related to long-\nterm  finance  and  availability  of  finance.  The  review  of  laws,  bylaws,  and  regulations  on \ninvestment,  governance,  risk  management,  and  fund  managers  will  be  completed  as  well  as \napproval  of  account  and  prudential  regulations  for  repos  and  securities  lending.  The  two \nagencies,  established  under  subprogram  1,  will  provide  additional  funding,  expanding  the \nmatching  grant  facility  for  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  with  specific  gender \ntargets. The government will implement the gender action plan and publicly report on results. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nThe  overall  program  is  estimated  to  cost  $200  million  equivalent  for  2014\u20132016. \nSubprogram  1  comprises  single-tranche  loans  in  the  aggregate  amount  of  $75  million \nequivalent. Subprogram 2, with a loan amount of $50 million equivalent, and subprogram 3, with \na  loan  amount  of  $75  million  equivalent,  are  both  subject  to  further  discussion  between  ADB \nand  the  government.  The  subsequent  subprograms  will  be  submitted  for  ADB  Board \nconsideration  upon  completion  of  the  policy  triggers.  The  policy  matrix  provides  actions  to  be \ntaken  prior  to  Board  consideration  for  subprogram  1,  and  proposed  policy  actions  for \nsubsequent programs.  \n \n30. \nTo  help  finance  subprogram  1,  the  government  has  requested  (i)  a  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR39,286,000  ($59  million  equivalent)  from  ADB's  Special  Funds \nresources,  and  (ii)  a  loan  of  $16,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR).22 The \nAsian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5 \nyears,  an  interest  rate  of  2.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  thereafter,  and  such \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs  \n\n                                                \n21 The  interagency committee  and  working group  for capital market  reform has  representatives from  the  Ministry of \n\nEconomy and Sustainable Development, the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank of Georgia. \n\n22 Development policy letter from the government is in Appendix 3. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The OCR loan will have a 15-\nyear  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  straight-line  repayment  method,  an  annual \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 9.25 \nyears and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. Subprograms 2 and 3 will be financed \nfrom  OCR  or  a  combination  of  ADF  resources  and  OCR,  subject  to  the  availability  of  ADF \nresources. \n \n31. \nThe  loan  size  is  based  on  government\u2019s  financing  needs,  the  nature  and  sequence  of \nthe required reforms, and potential development impact. The government\u2019s development-related \nexpenses  associated  with  the  program  are  estimated  at  GEL757.3  million  ($440.3  million),23 \nleaving  a  shortfall  of  approximately  GEL300.0  million  ($174.4  million)  for  2014  in  unfunded \nliabilities that are envisaged to be financed through development partner assistance. Georgia\u2019s \ngross financing needs continue to be high. In 2014, with the fiscal deficit amounting to 3.7% of \nGDP,  the  government  intends  to  borrow  both  from  domestic  (28.7%)  and  foreign  (71.3%) \nsources to finance the deficit. The public debt level is expected to increase to 33.6% of GDP in \n2014 from 32.9% at the end of 2013 as a result of government borrowing for budget support. \n \nE. \n \n32. \nThe  MOF  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment  and  the  MOF  will  be  the  implementing  agencies  for  the  program.  A  program \nsteering committee will be formed comprising senior officials from the two ministries, chaired by \nthe  deputy  minister  of  finance.  The  committee  will  meet  semiannually  to  review  progress  in \nachieving the agreed policy actions for the program. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will \nbe  disbursed  to  Georgia  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.24 The loan proceeds \nwill  be  used  to  finance  the  cost  (excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of  items  produced  and \nprocured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other \nbilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The  implementation  period  for  the  overall  program  is  from \nJanuary  2014  to  December  2016,  while  the  implementation  period  for  subprogram  1  is  from \nJanuary 2014 to December 2014. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nfiscal  costs  of \n\n \nThe  beneficiaries  will  primarily  be  the  taxpayers,  pension  recipients,  small  businesses, \n33. \nwomen  entrepreneurs,  and  local  constituents  who  will  gain from  improved  revenue  and  public \nexpenditure  management.  Citizens  will  benefit  from  improved  investment  management \npractices of the government. Taxpayers and recipients of government services will benefit from \ninvestment  projects.  Small  businesses,  particularly  women \nreduced \nentrepreneurs, will benefit from improved availability of financing and increased opportunities to \nintroduce innovation and technology in businesses. \n \nA. \n \n34. \nThe  reform  agenda  supported  by  the  program  is  economically  viable.

The  economic  benefits  will  accrue  from \nenhanced  operational  and  allocative  efficiencies  from  the  program  reform  areas.  The  benefits \nare expected from better management of debt and fiscal risks confronting the country, increased \ninflows  of  tax  revenues  and  better  expenditure  allocative  efficiency  by  establishing  a \nstrengthened  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  investment  and  public-private  partnership \nprojects.  The  program  beneficiaries  will  include  the  working  population,  especially  the \npensioners  who  stand  to  gain  from  a  sustainable  and  reformed  new  pensions  system.  The \nenhanced  generation  of  domestic  savings  will  be  productively  used  in  stimulating  investment \nand furthering entrepreneurial activities for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.  \n \nB. \n \nIn  line  with  the  Second  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan,  a governance  risk \n35. \nassessment was conducted as part of the draft country partnership strategy for Georgia, 2014\u2013\n2018.  The  draft  assessment  notes  the  significant  advancements  that  Georgia  has  made  in \nbudgetary  and financial management  systems. A  basic  set  of  systems  is  in place for  strategic \nbudget  planning  and  budget  formulation  and  execution,  key  modules  of  an  integrated  public \nfinancial  management  system  have  been  launched,  the  treasury  information  system  is \noperational,  and  electronic  government  procurement  has  been  introduced.  Complementary \nreforms are being rolled out to line ministries and sectors. Risks identified include weak public \ninvestment  management,  inadequate  monitoring  and  analysis  of  government  contingent \nliabilities,  non-inclusion  of  LEPL  revenues  and  expenditures  in  budget  execution  reports,  and \ninadequate  predictability  and  transparency  of  intergovernmental  transfers.  The  proposed \nprogram and related TA project are addressing these areas. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. The government is \nacting  against  corruption,  including  ongoing  monitoring  and  reporting  work  by  the  public \naccounts  committee  of  the  Parliament.  The  government\u2019s  fiduciary  arrangements  for  budget \nsupport and relevant public financial management systems are considered sound.  \n \nC. \n \n36. \nThe  reforms  supported  under  the  program  will  accelerate  economic  growth  and  help \ncreate  jobs,  which  are  keys  to  reducing  poverty  and  ensuring  inclusive  growth.  Domestic \nresources for public and social expenditure will increase through more domestic savings, better \nincome  generating  opportunities  will  be  provided  through  improved  access  to  finance,  and \nenhanced protection against life and economic risks will be available through pension and social \nIncreased  domestic  resource  mobilization  will  also  benefit  small \nassistance  reforms. \nbusinesses,  especially  those  owned  or  run  by  women.  The  program  addresses  women\u2019s \nempowerment by narrowing gender disparities through improved access to financial resources \nand opportunities, as well as through better representation on the tax audit teams. The program \nwill also take an equitable approach for both men and women in the reformed pension system, \nconsistent with the current arrangements under pillar zero.   \n \nD. \n \n37. \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n\nThe  policy-based  loan  will  not  trigger  safeguard  policies  and  is  categorized  C  for \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nE. \n \n38. \nOf  the  potential  risks  identified  for  the  program,  the  key  risks  are  that  (i)  the  external \nenvironment  deteriorates  and  delays  fiscal  consolidation  reforms,  and  (ii)  weak  economic \ngrowth affects expenditure efficiency. The mitigation measures for these risks are that (i) ADB \nwill  facilitate  effective  and  coordinated  donor  support  to  ensure  reform  consistency;  and  (ii) \nthrough  policy  dialogue and  the TA (see footnote 13),  ADB  will  support the  MOF  in improving \ndebt  and  fiscal  management,  strengthening  public  expenditure  management,  and  increasing \ndomestic savings and private resources for investment. These risks and mitigating measures as \nwell  as  other  additional  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  described  in  detail  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan.25 The integrated benefits of the program are expected \nto outweigh the costs.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n39. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 1 shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as described in detail  in  the  loan \ndocuments. \n \n40. \nset forth in the loan agreements. \n \n\nThe government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for subprogram 1, which are \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n41. \nI  am  satisfied that  the proposed  programmatic  approach and  policy-based  loans  would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  programmatic  approach  for  the  Improving  Domestic  Resource  Mobilization \nfor Inclusive Growth Program;  \nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR39,286,000  to  Georgia  for \nsubprogram  1  of  the  Improving  Domestic  Resource  Mobilization  for  Inclusive \nGrowth Program, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at \nthe rate of 2.0% per annum during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of \n25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nagreement presented to the Board; and  \nthe loan of $16,000,000 to Georgia for subprogram 1 of the Improving Domestic \nResource Mobilization for Inclusive Growth Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of  15  years, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement \npresented to the Board. \n\nTakehiko Nakao  \nPresident \n\n                                                \n25 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n28 October 2014 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks \nAssumptions \nGovernment remains \ncommitted to reforms \npromoting inclusive \npublic investment \n \nEffective donor \ncoordination to further \npublic sector \nmanagement reforms \n \nRisk \nExternal environment \ndeteriorates and delays \nreforms to improve fiscal \nconsolidation  \nAssumption \nEffective interagency \ncoordination \n \nRisk \nWeak economic growth \nimpacts expenditure \nefficiency \nAssumption \nEffective and timely \ncollaboration of \nstakeholders \n \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nCitizens, particularly \nwomen, benefit from \nhigher living \nstandards and more \nemployment \nopportunities   \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n\n \nFiscal deficit reduced to 1.5% \nof GDP by 2020 \n(2012 baseline: 3.0%) \n \nAbsolute poverty reduced to \n18.0% of population by 2020 \n(2012 baseline: 22.4%) \n \nGini coefficient reduced to 0.35 \nby 2020  \n(2012 baseline: 0.42) a \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \nMOF public notification \n \n \n \nMOF public notification \n \n \n \nMOF public notification \n\nOutcome \nEffective mobilization \nof domestic \nresources for \nincreased public and \nprivate investment \n \n\n \nBy December 2016, domestic \nsavings as a percentage of \nGDP increased to at least \n21.6% (2012 baseline: 10.2%) \n \n\n \nNational Statistics \nOffice of Georgia \n \n\nOutputs  \n1.
