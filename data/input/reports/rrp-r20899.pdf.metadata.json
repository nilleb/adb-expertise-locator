The  Project  will\ncomplement  the  ongoing  Bank  Loan  1537-VIE:  Lower  Secondary\nEducation Development Project, aimed at improving the lower secondary\nschool  curriculum  and  in-service  teacher  training  system,  as  part  of  the\ncountry\u2019s  lower  secondary  education  reform  process.  The  Project  will\nalso create synergies with the ongoing project by revising the preservice\nteacher  training  curriculum  to  match  the  new  lower  secondary  school\ncurriculum. While the Project will contribute  to  improving the  quality  and\ninstitutional  capacity  of  the  preservice  teacher  training  system  for  lower\nfocus  on  10  selected\nsecondary  education  nationwide, \ndisadvantaged provinces in upgrading facilities and increasing access to\nteacher  training  colleges  (TTCs)  among  the  poor,  especially  ethnic\nminorities who are the poorest of the poor.\n\nit  will \n\nClassification\n\nPrimary: Human development\nSecondary: Poverty reduction\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nRationale\n\nCategory C\nEnvironmental  implications  were  reviewed,  and  no  significant  adverse\nenvironmental impacts were identified.\n\nThe  increasing  market  orientation  of  Viet  Nam's  economic  activities,\ntogether  with  the growing  number  of  graduates  of  primary  education,  is\ncreating  substantial  social  demand  and  manpower  requirements  for  a\nbetter  educated  workforce  beyond  primary  school.  While  primary\neducation  provides  basic  cognitive  skills,  lower  secondary  education\nprovides the  solid foundation for  producing  an  adaptive  and  competitive\nworkforce to sustain high economic growth. Accordingly, lower secondary\nschool  enrollments  increased  significantly  from  3.1  million  students  in\n1993 to 5.3 million  in  1997.  The  Government  projected  that  enrollments\nwill reach 7.9 million students by 2005. Because of the rapid expansion,\nthe  quality  of  lower  secondary  education  has  deteriorated.  The  poor\nquality  is  due  mainly  to  an  unsuitable  curriculum  and  shortages  of\nphysical  facilities  and  human  resources  (including  qualified  teachers).\nThe  lack  of  adequately  trained  teachers  is  also  a  major  cause  of  low\ninternal efficiency, as indicated by the high dropout and repetition rates of\n8.1 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, in 1997.\n\nPoor teaching quality stems from the outdated teacher training curriculum\nand teaching  methods,  and overcrowded facilities.  Teachers are  trained\nin  one  major  subject  and  one  minor  subject.  The  result  is  both\noverspecialization  and  inefficient  utilization  of  teachers  since  they  are\ngenerally  unable  to  teach  their  minor  subjects. While  in-service  teacher\ntraining  can  improve  the  teaching performance  of  existing  teachers,  the\ntraining of new teachers through an improved preservice system will be a\n\n\f           iii\n\nlong-term solution to the problem of low teaching quality. It  will enhance\noverall  teachers\u2019  performance  and  their  ability  to  handle  the  new  lower\nsecondary  school  curriculum.  It  will  also  prepare  a  sufficiently  large\nnumber  of  qualified  new  lower  secondary  school  teachers  in  the  near\nfuture  to  improve  the  existing  student/teacher  ratio  of  29:1  and  prevent\nfurther deterioration  in  teaching  quality.  The Government has  requested\nthe Bank to continue its lead role in the development of lower secondary\neducation.  The  Project  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  priority  in  the\neducation  sector  and  with  the  Bank\u2019s  Country  Operational  Strategy,\nwhich  emphasizes  efficient  economic  growth  with  equity,  poverty\nreduction, and environmentally sound development.\n\nThe  overall  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  assist  the  Government  in\nimproving  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  the  lower  secondary  education\nsubsector by providing lower secondary students with a sufficient number\nof qualified teachers. The specific objectives of the Project are to improve\nthe quality, access to, and institutional capacity of the preservice teacher\ntraining  system  for  lower  secondary  education.  The  Project  has  three\ncomponents  to  meet  the  objectives:  (i)  improve  the  quality  of  the\npreservice  teacher  training  program  for  lower  secondary  education  by\nrevising the curriculum, student textbooks, and teacher manuals of TTCs;\nproviding these materials to TTC libraries and to poor students through a\ntextbook  lending  scheme;  upgrading  the  knowledge  of  TTC  teachers;\nproviding  support  for  the  development  of  three  model  TTCs  in  three\nselected  cities  where  the  new  curriculum  and  materials  will  be  piloted;\nand  reestablishing an  external  assessment  system  for  TTC;  (ii) improve\nfacilities and access to TTCs in 10 selected disadvantaged provinces by\nproviding  facilities  and  a  transition  program  to  improve  pre-entrance\nqualifications  to  TTCs  for  ethnic  minorities;  and  (iii) strengthen  the\ncapacity of institutions involved in preservice teacher training by providing\ntraining in management and technical skills to relevant staff of the central\nand provincial institutions to support and sustain the reforms.\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $35.4  million  equivalent,\nincluding  taxes,  duties,  and  an  interest  charge  on  the  Bank  loan,  and\nphysical and price contingencies. The foreign exchange cost is estimated\nat $18.5 million (52 percent of the total cost) and the local currency cost\nis estimated at $16.9 million equivalent (48 percent of the total cost).\n\nSource\n\nForeign\nExchange\n18.1\nBank\n0.0\nGovernment\nCofinancing (New Zealand) 0.4\n18.5\n\nTotal\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n6.9\n10.0\n0.0\n16.9\n\nTotal \nCost\n25.0\n10.0\n0.4\n35.4\n\n70.6\n28.3\n1.1\n  100.0\n\n                   ($ million)\nPercent\n\nIt is proposed that the Bank provide a loan of $25 million (70.6 percent of\nthe  total  project  cost)  to  finance  $18.1  million  of  the  foreign  exchange\ncost  and  $6.9  million  equivalent  of  the  local  cost.

The  Government  of  New  Zealand  has  agreed  to\nprovide grant cofinancing on a tied and parallel basis, of about $400,000\nequivalent  (about  $133,333  equivalent  per  annum  over  the  first  three\nyears of the project period), with a possibility of providing additional grant\ncofinancing after the first three years of the project period.\n\nIt  is  proposed  that  the  Bank  provide  a  loan  of  Special  Drawing  Rights\n(SDR)  18,106,000  ($25  million  equivalent)  from  its  Special  Funds\nresources,  with a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years\nand  an  interest  charge of 1 percent per  annum  during  the  grace  period\nand 1.5 percent per annum thereafter, and equal amortization.\n\nUntil 30 September 2006\n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  by  a  project  implementation  unit\nestablished  within  the  Executing  Agency  and  by  provincial  project\nimplementation  units  established  within  the  provincial  departments  of\neducation  and  training  (DOETs)  of  the  10  selected  disadvantaged\nprovinces  and  the  three  selected  cities  where  model  TTCs  will  be\ndeveloped.  Overall  guidance  will  be  provided  by  a  project  steering\ncommittee,  chaired  by  the  relevant  Vice  Minister  of  the  Ministry  of\nEducation  and  Training  (MOET),  with  representation  from  MOET,\nMinistry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and Investment, and State Bank\nof Viet Nam.\n\nAll Bank-financed procurement for the Project will be in accordance with\nthe Bank\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works under the Project are\nsmall  and  scattered  throughout  the  country  and  are  not  likely  to  attract\nthe  interest  of  international  contractors.  Thus,  it  is  proposed  that  civil\nworks  contracts  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding\n(LCB)  procedures  acceptable  to  the  Bank.  For  minor  rehabilitation\ncosting  less  than  $50,000  equivalent,  the  civil  works  contracts  will  be\nawarded  on  a  direct  purchase  basis.  Contracts  for  the  supply  of  goods\nand services (including equipment, furniture, and  instructional  materials)\nare expected to be  small and  are  not expected  to  attract  the  interest  of\ninternational suppliers. Contracts are expected to be less than $100,000\nbut some will be grouped together to form larger packages. Contracts of\n$500,000 or less will be awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  shopping\nprocedures.  Contracts  of  $100,000  or  less  will  be  procured  on  local\ncompetitive  bidding  (LCB)  or  direct  purchase  basis  acceptable  to  the\nBank. Where many suppliers are locally available, procurement will be on\na LCB basis; where provinces are remote, and there are a limited number\nof  suppliers,  procurement  will  be  on  a  direct  purchase  basis  from  the\nlocal supplier within the province, or from a regional supplier in a nearby\nprovince.\n\nConsulting\nServices\n\nAbout 75 person-months of international and about 336 person-months of\ndomestic consulting services will be provided to support various aspects\nof  the  Project,  including  curriculum  redesign,  materials  development,\n\n\f31 March 2006\n\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date\n\nProject Benefits\nand Beneficiaries\n\n           v\n\nlending  scheme  design,  model  TTCs  development,\ntextbook \ndevelopment  of  an  external  assessment  system,  design  of  a  transition\nprogram to improve TTC pre-entrance qualifications for ethnic minorities,\nand  staff  development  (both  in  the  cited  aspects  and  in  institutional\ncapacity  building  in  management  and  other  technical  skills  to  underpin\nthe teacher training reforms). All consultants financed under the loan will\nbe  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s  Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to the Bank\nfor the engagement of domestic consultants.\n\nThe  major  project  benefits  are  the  contributions  to  improvements  in  the\ninternal efficiency of lower secondary education, as  reflected  in  reduced\ndropout  and  repetition  rates,  since  better  qualified  teachers  to  be\nproduced by the Project will have better knowledge of the new curriculum\nand  will  be  able  to  deliver  teaching  more  effectively.  The  new  teaching\nmethodologies  to  be  introduced  in  the  Project,  which  will  be  based  on\nstudent-centered approaches, will enable the newly produced teachers to\ninteract  more  with  students,  thus  helping  improve  the  performance  of\ntheir  students.  Moreover,  the  double  major  system  to  be  instituted  at\nTTCs  will  enable  the  newly  produced  teachers  to  teach  more  than  one\nsubject,  thereby  increasing  the  utilization  of  teachers.  These  internal\nefficiency gains are captured by the high economic internal rate of return\nestimated at 23 percent.\n\nBy the end of the Project (2006), the beneficiaries will include (i) around\n26,000 TTC students (about 80 percent females) who will complete their\nthird year teacher training courses under the new curriculum by the end\nof the project period, and their successors; and (ii) around 8 million lower\nsecondary  school  students  (about  50  percent  females)  enrolled  at  the\nend  of  the  project  period,  and  their  successors,  who  will  benefit  from\nbetter qualified teachers.\n\nThe  beneficiaries  during  the  project  period  (2000-2006)  will  include\n(i) around  12,000  students  (about  80  percent  females),  who  are  the\npoorest  50  percent  of  TTC  students  in  the  10  selected  disadvantaged\nprovinces and in the three cities selected as model TTCs (inclusive of all\nethnic  minority  students),  will  be  provided  with  textbooks  under  the\nProject\u2019s textbook lending scheme; (ii) around 4,000 (800 per year for five\nyears) prospective ethnic minorities (about 60 percent females) in the 10\ndisadvantaged  provinces  who  will  be  recruited  to  upgrade  their  pre-\nentrance qualifications so as to subsequently gain access to TTCs under\nthe project\u2019s transition program, after which they will become teachers of\nlower  secondary  schools  in  their own  communes;  and  (iii) around  1,500\nadministrative  staff  from  MOET,  DOETs,  and  TTCs  (300,  700,  and  500\nrespectively), and 5,000  TTC  teachers  (about  80 percent females),  who\nwill benefit from staff development (mainly in-country short-term training)\nrelated to various aspects of teacher training program improvements and\nto  institutional  capacity  building  in  management  and  in  other  relevant\ntechnical skills to support and sustain the teacher training reforms.\n\n\f           vi\n\n\fmap.jpg\n\n\fI submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan\n\n1.\nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Teacher Training Project.\n\nI.\n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAs requested by the Government, the Bank provided technical assistance (TA)1 between\n2.\nAugust 1998 and February 1999 to assist the Government in preparing a teacher training project\nto  improve  the  preservice  teacher  training  system  for  lower  secondary  education  in  terms  of\nquality,  access,  and  institutional  capacity.  This  will  be  part  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  lower  secondary\neducation reforms assisted by the Bank\u2019s  ongoing  Loan 1537-VIE:  Lower Secondary Education\nDevelopment  Project2  to  improve  the  lower  secondary  school  curriculum  and  the  in-service\nteacher training system. The proposed Project will  create synergies  with the  ongoing project  by\nrevising  the  preservice  teacher  training  curriculum  for  lower  secondary  education  to  match  the\nnew lower secondary school curriculum. While the proposed Project will contribute to nationwide\nquality  and  institutional  capacity  improvements,  it  will  focus  on  10  selected  disadvantaged\nprovinces  for  increasing  facilities  and  access  to  teacher  training  colleges  and  schools  (TTCs,\nTTSs)  among  the poor, especially ethnic  minorities  who are  the poorest of  the  poor.  The  Bank\nundertook  loan  fact-finding  in  April  1999  and  appraisal  in  July  1999.3  Throughout  project\npreparation  and  appraisal,  there  were  close  coordination  and  consultation  with  Government\nofficials  at  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training  (MOET)  and  the  provincial  departments  of\neducation and training (DOETs); Ministry of Finance (MOF); Ministry of Planning and Investment\n(MPI); State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV); TTCs/TTSs; funding agencies; and expected beneficiaries\nof  the  Project  (e.g.,  TTC/TTS  teachers  and  students,  lower  secondary  school  teachers  and\nstudents,  parents,  community  representatives,  and  representatives  of  ethnic  minorities).  The\nproject framework is in Appendix 1.\n\nA.\n\nSocioeconomic Context and Poverty Issues\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe population of Viet Nam was estimated to be about 77 million at the end of 1997, with\n3.\na  concomitant  high  population  density  of  235  persons  per  square  kilometers.  The  high  annual\npopulation growth rate of more than 2 percent in the past\u2014it recently  declined to 1.9 percent\u2014\nresulted in a large proportion of children (23 percent) in the basic education age cohort (aged 6-\n14). About 80 percent of the population live in rural areas. Of the total population, 87 percent are\nethnic  Vietnamese  (Kinh),  and  the  rest  consist  of  53  ethnic  minority  groups,  with  distinct\nlanguages and cultural practices. Although the ethnic minorities are concentrated in the northern\nmountainous  borderlands,  they  are  found  in  practically  all  provinces,  comprising  less  than  1\npercent to over 90 percent of the population in the provinces.\n\n4.\nViet Nam remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with a per  capita  income  of\n$330  in  1997.  About  51  percent  of  the  population  live  below  the  poverty  line,4  which  was\nestimated  to  be  about  $100  per  head per  year  (1992/93  prices).5  However,  about  half  of  these\n\n                                               \n1 TA 2970-VIE: Teacher Training Project, for $600,000, approved on 24 December 1997.\n2 Loan 1537-VIE: Lower Secondary Education Development Project, for $50 million, approved on 16 September 1997.\n3 The Mission comprised S. Hutaserani, Project Economist/Mission Leader; C. Wee, Counsel; and E. Sison, Education\n\nPlanning and Costing Specialist/Staff Consultant.\n\n4 World Bank. 1995. Viet Nam Poverty Assessment and Strategy Report. Report No. 13442-VN. East Asia and Pacific\n\nRegion, Country Department I, Washington, DC.\n\n5 Poverty incidence estimated by the Government is lower because lower poverty line is used.\n\n\f2\n\npoor people (25 percent of the population) live in hard-core poverty, unable to afford the minimum\ndaily  food  requirements  of  2,100  calories.  Most  of  them  live  in  the  northern  mountainous\nprovinces,  the  mountainous  and  coastal  areas  of  the  central  provinces,  and  the  flood-prone\nMekong delta of  the  southern  provinces.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  social  indicators  are  relatively  good  for  its\nincome  level  due  to  the  emphasis  on  social  well-being  under  the  past  socialist  regime.  For\nexample, it has a moderate Human Development Index of 0.664.6 It has achieved very low levels\nof mortality\u2014life expectancy is 67 years and infant mortality rate is 30 per 1,000 live births. Adult\nliteracy rate is high at 97 percent. The Government adopted the Doi Moi Policy or market-oriented\npolicy in 1986, with actual implementation in 1991, to transform the economy into a market-based\nsystem through various reform measures such as abolition of price controls, progressive removal\nof price subsidies to public enterprises, expansion of foreign direct investment, reduction of trade\nbarriers,  and  liberalization  of  foreign  exchange  controls.  The  annual  growth  rate  of  the  gross\ndomestic product (GDP) has averaged more than 8 percent for most of the 1990s, peaking at 9.5\npercent  in  1996  before  slowing  down  to  7  percent  in  1998.  Inflation  has  been  kept  to  a  single\ndigit. Sustained economic growth will, however, depend on an efficient basic education system to\nproduce quality human resources.\n\nB.\n\nThe Education Sector\n\n1.\n\nStructure\n\n5.\nThe Vietnamese education system consists of five years of primary education, followed by\nfour  years  of  lower  secondary,  three  years  of  upper  secondary,  and  four  years  of  higher\neducation. Since the primary and lower secondary levels are considered as basic education, they\nwere offered in the same schools. Only in 1991, when the Government wanted to focus first on\nmaking  primary  education  universal,  were  most  schools  for  basic  education  split  into  separate\nprimary  and  lower  secondary  schools.  However,  due  to  the  shortage  of  school  buildings,  a\nsubstantial  number  of  these  separate  schools  still  share  the  same  premises.  Upper  secondary\neducation  and technical  and  vocational education  are offered  as three-year  courses  after  lower\nsecondary  education.  Short  vocational  training  courses  of  up  to  two  years  are  an  alternative.\nUniversity  education  is  offered  in  four-  to  six-year  courses  after  upper  secondary  education.\nThere  are  also  special  education  courses,  namely,  complementary  education  offered  to  adults\ncompleting  lower  secondary  education,  and  continuing  education  offered  to  those  completing\nupper  secondary  education.  Professional  education,  such  as  teacher  training  for  primary\neducation, is offered at TTCs/TTSs  in three-year  courses  after  lower  secondary  education or  in\ntwo-year  courses  after  upper  secondary  education.  Teacher  training  for  lower  secondary\neducation is offered at the same TTCs/TTSs as those for primary education in three-year courses\nafter upper  secondary education.  Upper  secondary  teachers are  trained  in four-year  courses  at\nteacher training universities (TTUs) or universities of pedagogy.\n\n2.\n\nSize\n\n6.\nPrimary  schools  totaling  13,000  in  1997  are  found  in  almost  all  villages  throughout  the\ncountry. In the same year, there were about 7,000 lower secondary schools, 3,000 basic schools\n(offering both primary  and  lower  secondary education),  800  upper  secondary  schools,  and  800\ncombined lower and upper secondary schools. With the emphasis on social development in the\npast regime, gross enrollment rate (GER) for primary  education has  been  high  (over 100)  even\nprior to primary education was made as compulsory in 1991.7 During 1993-1997, enrollments at\n                                               \n6 Based on the most recent Human Development Index  developed  by the  United  Nations  Development  Programme,\n\nHuman Development Report, 1999, Viet Nam ranked as 110 among 174 countries (1997).\n\n7  GER is the total enrollment in a grade level, regardless  of  age,  expressed  as  a  percentage (sometimes  exceeding\n\n100 percent) of the population in the officially defined school-age group for the level.\n\n\f3\n\nthe primary level increased from 9.7 million to 10.6 million (with GER of 117 percent). During this\nperiod,  enrollments  at  the  lower  secondary  level  expanded  even  faster  at  an  average  annual\ngrowth  rate  of  around  14  percent,  from  3.1  million  to  5.3  million  (with  GER  of  64  percent)  to\nabsorb  the  growing  number  of  primary  school  graduates.  The  major  characteristics  and\nperformance indicators of primary and lower secondary education are in Appendix 2. Enrollments\nat the upper secondary level also expanded rapidly at an average annual growth rate of around\n18 percent, from 724,369 to 1.4 million (with GER of 25 percent). Females accounted for almost\n50 percent of the total enrollments at both primary and lower secondary levels, and for 46 percent\nat the upper secondary level.\n\n7.\nThe rapid  increases  in  secondary enrollments  have  led  to facility  shortages  (classrooms\nand  teachers).  In 1997,  the  number  of  classes  at  the  primary,  and  lower  and  upper  secondary\nlevels were 323,353, 125,456, and 28,747 respectively, resulting in class sizes of 33, 42, and 48,\nrespectively. About 80 percent of  secondary  schools  have to  operate  more than one  shift. With\nthe  teachers  for  the  three  education  levels  numbering  325,777,  179,512,  and  46,979,  the\nresulting student/teacher ratios were 32.4, 29.3, and 29.6, respectively. Although the ratios of less\nthan 30 for the lower and upper secondary levels are not considered too high, they represent a\nrapid increase from 23.4 and 21.2, respectively, in 1993, and are expected to increase rapidly in\nthe future unless the number of teachers at both levels can be expanded enough  to  keep  pace\nwith the rapid enrollment growth. For lower secondary education, the Government has come up\nwith an expansion plan to produce more teachers under the so-called Program-IV (para. 24) by\nincreasing the  physical  facilities  of  TTCs/TTSs  and  almost  doubling  TTC/TTS  enrollments  from\nthe average of about 15,000 students in 1997 to about 28,000 students per year. This will almost\ndouble  the  total  TTC/TTS  enrollments  during  the  three-year  program  for  lower  secondary\neducation from 44,000 students to about 84,000 students.\n\n8.\nTeacher  training  for  primary  and  lower  secondary  education  is  provided  under  different\nprograms  in  the  same  TTC/TTS  in  each  of  the  country\u2019s  61  provinces.  The  teacher  training\nprogram for primary education takes three years after completing lower  secondary education  or\ntwo  years  after  completing  upper  secondary  education,  whereas  that  for  lower  secondary\neducation takes three years after completing upper secondary education. Each province has  its\nown TTC/TTS, which is operated by its provincial DOET under the supervision of MOET. The 61\nprovinces  have  45  TTCs  and  16  TTSs.  TTSs  differ  from  TTCs  in  that  their  teaching  staff  and\nphysical  facilities  are  insufficient  to  meet  the  minimum  requirements  for  becoming  TTCs.\nHowever,  with  the  Government  plan  to  expand  TTC/TTS  enrollments  under  Program-IV,  both\nTTS teaching staff and physical facilities have been expanded to upgrade the remaining TTSs to\nTTCs by 2001.8 At present, TTS students receive certificates from TTCs in nearby provinces after\ngraduation.  In  addition  to  the  61  TTCs/TTSs  under  DOETs,  there  are  six  TTCs  operated  by\nMOET (two in Hanoi, two in Ho Chi Minh City [HCMC], one in Nha Trang, and one in Tay Bac).\nThe six are specialized TTCs at the regional level, offering training only in physical education or\nart and music, or both. Teacher training for upper secondary education is provided in a four-year\nprogram at nine TTUs.\n\n9.\nThe  61  TTCs/TTSs  have  a  total  enrollment  of  about  75,000  students:  about  31,000\nstudents are in the primary education program and 44,000 students (about 15,000 students per\nyear) in the lower secondary program. The enrollments for both programs have been targeted for\nexpansion  under  the  Government\u2019s  Program-IV.  That  is,  the  lower  secondary  program\nenrollments are expected to almost double to around 84,000 students (28,000 students per year)\nto keep pace with the rapidly growing lower secondary enrollments, which are expected to reach\n8  million  by  mid-2000s.  In  the  61  TTCs/TTSs,  there  are  about  7,300  teachers,  of  which  about\n                                               \n8  Since  the  Government  has  a plan to upgrade  all TTSs to  TTCs by  2001, the  remaining  sections  of this  report  will\n\nrefer to TTCs/TTSs as TTCs to avoid confusion.\n\n\f4\n\n2,300  belong  to  the  primary  education  program  and  5,000  to  the  lower  secondary  program,\nalthough  many  teachers  teach  both  programs.  The  TTC/TTS  student/teacher  ratios  are  about\n13:1 for the primary education program and about 9:1 for the lower secondary program. Only 13\npercent of TTC/TTS teachers have master\u2019s degrees (MA/M.Ed.).\n\n3.\n\nAdministration\n\n10.\nThe administration of education and training is shared among the central, provincial, and\ndistrict  governments  and  the  communities,  with  centralized  decision  making  and  decentralized\nimplementation.  While  primary  education \nis  administered  by  district  governments  and\ncommunities, secondary and professional education (including teacher training) are administered\nby provincial governments (DOETs) under the supervision of MOET and the provincial People\u2019s\nCommittees. Each DOET is headed by a director, with some vice directors.\n\n11.\nAlthough MOET is more involved in administering higher education and some specialized\nupper secondary technical institutions, basically it is responsible for all education and training in\nthe country in terms of policy formulation, guidance, and supervision. It is headed by the minister\nof  Education  and  Training,  with  four  vice  ministers.  MOET  has  16  departments,  two  research\ninstitutes,  and  associated  service  units.  Secondary  education  and  teacher  training  are  the\nresponsibility  of  the  Department  of  Secondary  Education  and  the  Department  of  Teacher\nTraining,  respectively.  The  National  Institute  of  Educational  Science  (NIES)  develops  curricula,\nand the Education Publishing House develops and publishes textbooks. The Institute for School\nDesign is in charge of school building design and civil works supervision. School equipment is the\nresponsibility of the two Education Equipment Companies.\n\n4.\n\nFinancing\n\n12.\nConcomitant  with  the  Government\u2019s  national  priority  set  in  1993,  which  accorded  top\npriority to the education sector, the share  of  public  recurrent expenditure allocated  to  education\nhas been  increasing from  less than  15  percent to  around  19 percent  recently.  It  is  expected  to\nincrease more during the next decade. Given the target of achieving universal primary education\nby  2000,  the  largest  education  share  of  about  30  percent  has  been  allocated  to  primary\neducation, followed by lower secondary education (20 percent), university and college education\n(13  percent),  upper  secondary  education  (8  percent),  technical  and  vocational  education  (8\npercent), and preschool education (6 percent). The remaining 15 percent goes to other categories\nof education and research. As lower secondary enrollments are estimated  to  reach  8  million  by\nthe  mid-2000s,  the  lower secondary budget  share  is expected to  increase  slightly  to  reflect  the\nGovernment\u2019s target of achieving  universal  lower  secondary education  in urban areas by  2010.\nThe increase after 2005 is expected to be faster as the target of universal primary education will\nhave  been  fully  achieved,  even  in  remote  mountainous  areas,  so  that  some  resources  can  be\nreleased to focus on lower secondary education.\n\n13.\nThere  exist  cost-sharing  mechanisms  in  the  public  education  financing  system,  which\nfollow the structure of administration. That is, for primary education, district governments pay for\nthe  salaries  of  teachers,  communities  pay  for  investment  costs  of  building  construction,  and\nparents\u2019  associations  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs.  For  secondary  education,\nprovincial governments share the responsibility with communities and parents\u2019 associations. The\ncentral Government finances higher education. Cost recovery also exists in the public education\nfinancing system: tuition fees were introduced in 1989 at the postprimary levels, with the official\nfee  structure  introduced  in  1993.  Monthly  tuition  fees  for  lower  secondary  school  students  are\nD3,000-6,000 (about $0.22-0.43) in urban areas, depending on grade, and D2,000-5,000 (about\n$0.14-0.36)  in  rural  areas.  Students  also  pay  annual  contributions  of  D10,000-25,000  (about\n\n\f5\n\n$0.72-1.8),  depending  on  the  region,  and  pay  around  D47,600  (about  $3.4)  for  textbooks  per\nyear.  The  annual  contributions  are  waived  for  needy  students.  All  fees  are  waived  for  ethnic\nminority  students.  Scholarships  are  available  to  gifted  and  poor  students  (including  all  ethnic\nminorities). Although the tuition fees were recently abolished to attract more TTC students, TTC\nstudents also pay annual contributions and pay for textbooks as do the lower secondary school\nstudents. There are few private schools in Viet Nam since all private schools were absorbed into\nthe  public  education  system  during  the  1950s.  Greater  flexibility  was  introduced  recently,\nparticularly  at  higher  levels  of  education.  Private  providers  now  account  for  only  4  percent  of\nstudents at the lower secondary level.\n\nC.\n\nIssues in Lower Secondary Education\n\n1.\n\nAccess\n\n14.\nSince  primary  education  became  compulsory  in  1991,  the  country  has  made  good\nprogress  in  achieving  almost  universal  primary  education,  with  a  net  enrollment  rate  (NER)  of\nover 90 percent and GER of 117 in 1997.9 While primary education is still short of being universal\nonly in  highly  inaccessible  mountainous  and  delta  areas, access  to  lower  secondary  education,\nthough increasing significantly, is still limited to only half of the age cohort. For lower secondary\neducation, NER was 48 percent and GER 64 percent in 1997. Limited access to lower secondary\neducation,  especially  by  ethnic  minorities,  remains a problem. Ethnic  minority  enrollments  were\nonly 5 percent of the total lower secondary enrollments in 1997.\n\n15.\nInadequate  access  to  lower  secondary  education  is  caused  by  both  the  demand-  and\nsupply-side  factors.  On  the  supply  side,  unlike  primary  schools,  which  are  available  in  all\ncommunes, only about 85 percent of the communes have lower secondary schools. Distance to\nschool poses a serious problem. Although many lower secondary schools provide board specially\nto ethnic minority students, the desire of ethnic minority parents to send their children, especially\ngirls, to boarding schools is suppressed by cultural values. The  situation  is compounded  by  the\nhigh opportunity costs of schooling as opposed to working on the farm. Another supply-side factor\nis  the  shortage  of  physical  and  support  facilities.  The  rapid  increase  in  lower  secondary\nenrollments has put a pressure on classrooms. Average class size increased from 39 to 42 during\n1993-1997 (Appendix 2). The problem has been aggravated by the  separation of basic  schools\ninto  primary  and  lower  secondary  schools  but  without  the  provision  of  additional  space.  Many\nschools have resorted to double or even triple shifting. While the former can be considered as an\nefficient  way  to  use  scarce  classrooms  provided  that  curriculum,  teaching  methods,  and\nmanagement systems are appropriate, the latter will reduce teaching quality through inadequate\nteacher  contact  time.  Other  physical  facilities  (library  and  laboratory  spaces),  together  with\nsupport facilities (lavatories and water), are also inadequate.\n\nAccess  to  TTCs  is  also  limited,  particularly  for  ethnic  minorities  in  remote  and\n16.\nmountainous  areas,  by  both  the  demand  and  supply  sides.  On  the  supply  side,  although  each\nprovince has its own TTC, this is usually located in the center of the province, far from the ethnic\nminority areas. Inadequate physical facilities (classrooms, library and laboratory space, and study\nareas)  also  limit  the  enrollment  capacity  of  TTCs.  On  the  demand  side,  although  boarding\nfacilities  are  provided  for  ethnic  minorities  and  other  poor  students  at  all  TTCs,  ethnic  minority\nparents are reluctant to send their teenage daughters to boarding schools. Coupled with the high\nopportunity costs of schooling, ethnic minority enrollments at TTCs are low, especially for girls. In\nthe 10  disadvantaged provinces  selected  in this Project  to  increase ethnic  minorities\u2019 access  to\nTTCs, ethnic minority enrollments are only 8 percent. However, in an attempt to meet the target\n                                               \n9 NER is the number of pupils in the official school-age group expressed as a percentage of the total population in that\n\nage group.\n\n\f6\n\nof  universal  lower  secondary  education  in  urban  areas  by  2010,  the  Government  has  been\nexpanding  the  physical  capacity  of  both  lower  secondary  schools  and  TTCs.  Loan  1537-VIE\n(para. 2) also assists in improving physical and support facilities in 234 lower secondary schools\nin  the 10 disadvantaged  provinces.  This  Project  will  assist  in  improving  facilities  and  access  to\nTTCs in those provinces.\n\n2.\n\nQuality\n\na.\n\nInternal Efficiency\n\n17.\nPoor quality and low internal efficiency are major problems in the basic education system\n(primary  and  lower  secondary  education  combined).  Poor  quality  is  due  to  poor  curricula  and\ninsufficient  quality-enhancing  inputs  (textbooks,  instructional  materials,  and  qualified  teachers).\nResulting  largely  from  poor  quality,  low  internal  efficiency  is  reflected  in  high  dropout  and\nrepetition rates, which waste scarce resources. In 1997, the average dropout and repetition rates\nin primary education were 6 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively; in lower secondary education,\nthe figures were 8 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively. The result is a low completion rate of 69\npercent  in  the  primary  and  lower  secondary  cycles.  The  internal  efficiency  measures  for  both\nlevels  are  expected  to  improve  during  the  2000s  (Appendix  2)  as  the  Government\u2019s  primary\neducation reforms (part of which is supported by the World Bank) and lower secondary education\nreforms  (part  of  which  is  supported  by  Loan  1537-VIE  and  another  part  by  this  Project)  take\neffect.\n\nb.\n\nCurriculum\n\n18.\nThe  existing  lower  secondary  curriculum  is  not  suited  to  the  demand  of  the  market\neconomy since it is too extensive for the length of time available, too structured, and inflexible. It\ncovers 16 subjects over a 40-week period. With the need in many schools to reduce school hours\nto accommodate double or even triple shifting, the breadth of the curriculum cannot be completed\neasily.  The  complexity  of  the  curriculum  also  requires  a  greater  number  of  teachers,  thus\nimposing  a  heavy  financial  burden  on  the  Government.  The  World  Bank  has  been  providing\nsupport  for  curriculum  reforms  at  the  primary  level.  The  Bank  has  taken  the  lead  role  in\nsupporting  curriculum  reforms  at  the  lower  secondary  level  through  TA  2690-VIE10  and  Loan\n1537-VIE (para. 2). The TA proposed a new curriculum framework for  lower  secondary  schools\nby  combining  the  many  subjects  into  10  subject  groups  (mathematics,  science,  history,\ngeography, civics education,  Vietnamese  language/literature, foreign  languages, technology, art\nand music, and physical education) and providing a new syllabus outline for each subject group.\nIt also developed a new curriculum framework for in-service teacher training to be consistent with\nthe  new  lower  secondary  school  curriculum. Loan  1537-VIE  developed  the new  curriculum  and\nsubject  syllabi  as  the  basis  for  writing  student  textbooks  and  workbooks  as  well  as  teacher\nmanuals, which will be pilot-tested for grades 6-9 during school years 2000/01-2003/04, starting\nwith grade 6 in 2000/01.\n\nc.\n\nTeachers\n\n19.\nAlthough the  student/teacher  ratio of  29.3  for  lower  secondary  schools  in  1997  was  not\nexcessive  compared  with  35-40  in  other  countries  in  the  region,  many  teachers  have  had  to\nhandle double or even triple shifts due to inadequate classrooms. This is one reason for the low\nteaching  quality.  Moreover,  almost  20  percent  of  lower  secondary  education  teachers  remain\nuntrained  as  teachers.  Trained  teachers  can  normally  teach  only  one  subject  because  of  the\n                                               \n10 TA  2690-VIE:  Lower Secondary Curriculum and In-Service Teacher Training Systems Development Project,  for\n\n$1,000,000, approved on 20 November 1996.\n\n\f7\n\nexcessive  specialization  of  the  curricula  in  the  secondary  schools  and  TTCs.  Thus,  teacher\nshortages in some specialized subjects (including art and music) remain a problem. There are 15\nsubject  areas  taught  in  TTCs  (mathematics,  biology,  chemistry,  physics,  history,  geography,\ncivics  education,  Vietnamese  language/literature,  English,  French,  agricultural  technology,\nindustrial technology, art, music, and physical education), with one major and one minor subject.\nGiven  the  major-minor  time  allocation  of  70:30,  the  time  for  the  minor  subject  is  too  limited  to\nallow TTC students to specialize in the minor subject. Moreover, teaching methodologies do not\nencourage active participation by students.\n\n20.\nThis  Project  will  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  lower  secondary  education  reforms  by\nrevising the  existing  TTC preservice  curriculum  (including  teaching  methodologies)  to  be  in  line\nwith  the new  lower  secondary  school  curriculum  developed  under  Loan  1537-VIE.  A  system  of\ndouble  major  will  also be  considered.  The  revised  TTC  curriculum  will  be  used  as  the  basis  in\nrevising TTC student textbooks and teacher manuals.\n\nD.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n1.\n\nPolicies and Plans for Poverty Reduction\n\n21.\nViet Nam being one of the poorest countries in the world, with poverty incidence of about\n51 percent (1992/93 prices) and hard-core poverty incidence of 25 percent, the Government has\nidentified  three  strategies  for  reducing  poverty:  (i)  sustaining  rapid  economic  growth  to  expand\nemployment  opportunities,  increase  efficiency  in  resources  use,  and  thus  significantly  reduce\npoverty;  (ii)  providing  adequate  social  services  (especially  basic  education,  basic  health  care,\nfamily planning, and nutrition) to equip the poor with basic skills for taking full advantage of new\nemployment  opportunities,  thus  attacking  one  of  the  principal  causes  of  poverty;  and\n(iii) reorienting social safety nets or antipoverty programs (including pensions and social reliefs) to\nprovide  more  benefits  to  the  poorest  20  percent  of  the  population,  who  are  currently  receiving\nonly  7  percent  of  the  benefits  of  these  programs  compared  with  40  percent  received  by  the\nrichest 20 percent.\n\n2.\n\nPolicies and Plans for Promoting Education\n\n22.\nThe Government\u2019s and the Party\u2019s general policies on education have been presented in\na number of documents, including the Education Development Policy (ratified in January 1993);\nthe  five-year  plan  for  1996-2000  (endorsed  by  the  July  1996  Party  Congress);  guidelines  for  a\ndevelopment  strategy  for  education  (approved  in  December  1996);  and  the  Education  Law\n(approved  in  December  1998).  On  the  basis  of  these  policies  and  plans,  the  development  of\neducation was accorded top national priority as the key instrument for facilitating socioeconomic\nreforms  and  sustaining  the  favorable  economic  performance  of  the  last  decade.  Education  is\nconsidered  a  prerequisite  for  the  realization  of  other  socioeconomic  goals,  including  reducing\npopulation  growth  and  improving  primary  health  care.  The  goals  of  education  are  to  enhance\nexcellence, efficiency, and equity. However, with cost recovery as a requirement, the Government\nwill retain equity policies to create favorable conditions that will enable the poor to study.\n\n23.\nThe Government\u2019s broad education sector targets for the next decade are (i) elimination of\nilliteracy,  (ii) universal  primary  education  by  2000,  (iii) universal  lower  secondary  education  in\nurban  areas  by  2010,  and  (iv) gradual  expansion  of  upper  secondary  education  to  promote\nindustrialization and economic  modernization.  Broad  strategies  to  achieve  these  targets  include\nredesigning the curricula of basic education (for both students and teachers), improving teaching\nmethodologies,  increasing  learning  facilities  and  access  in  disadvantaged  areas,  strengthening\ninstitutional  capacity,  and  identifying  external  sources  to  finance  the  reforms.  With  primary\n\n\f8\n\neducation close to being universal, the Government has shifted its  attention to  lower  secondary\neducation, alongside primary education, by focusing on physical capacity expansion and  quality\nimprovements with external support from funding agencies.\n\nThe  policy  shift  is  demonstrated  in  the  pattern  of  Government  investments  since  1995.\n24.\nProvinces have  been  supported  by  increased  subventions  to  expand  their  physical  facilities  for\nlower  secondary  education,  alongside  those  for  primary  education,  under  the  Government\u2019s\nProgram-IV,  a  special  multi-million  dollar  Teacher  Training  Upgrading  and  Strengthening\nProgram. This program was initiated in 1994 and has been cofunded by the central and provincial\ngovernments  on  a  50:50  basis,  with  higher  central  Government  subsidies  for  the  most\ndisadvantaged provinces. A master plan, designed for the implementation of this program, aimed\nat putting in place sufficient basic infrastructure by expanding TTC classrooms, and boarding and\nadministrative  facilities  threefold  and  by  establishing  a  TTC  in  every  province  to  meet  the\nprovincial demand for primary and lower secondary education teachers. Most facilities had been\ncompleted  and  commissioned  by  late  1998.  Toward  the  end  of  the  1990s,  with  the  basic\ninfrastructure  in  place,  the  Government  will  focus  attention  on  the  quality  aspects  of  teacher\ntraining. Given the high priority on education, especially basic education, and the continuing high\neconomic  growth  of  6-7  percent  per  annum,  the  necessary  resources  will  be  available  for  the\nGovernment  to  achieve  the  Program-IV  target  of  physical  capacity  expansion.  This  will  lay  the\nfoundation for quality improvements of teacher training to be supported by this Project.\n\nE.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n25.\nSince  1991,  external  assistance  to  the  education  sector  from  multilateral  and  bilateral\nfunding  agencies  has  focused  on  primary  education.  The  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund\nprovided support for the development of primary and preschool education  ($7  million).  Australia\nassisted  in  the  establishment  of  an  English  language  center,  with  training  and  scholarship\nprograms  ($12.5  million).  Belgium  has  provided  assistance  in  distance  training  for  primary\neducation  teachers  in five  disadvantaged  provinces  ($2.5  million)  and  teacher  training for  basic\neducation in seven disadvantaged provinces ($1.3 million). Canada has contributed to improving\nthe capacity of the National Institute for Education Development in strategic planning for primary\neducation ($0.5 million). The European Union has supported improvements in MOET capacity in\neducation management and an information system ($7.5 million). Japan provided assistance for\nprimary schools in flood-prone areas  ($51  million).  The World  Bank  gave  the  largest  support to\nprimary education\u2013$70 million for curriculum development, textbook writing, provision of teaching\naids,  and  rehabilitation  of  primary  schools  in  selected  provinces.  The  World  Bank  is  currently\npreparing  another  project  on  teacher  training  for  primary  education,  focusing  on  improving\nprimary  school  teachers\u2019  quality,  utilization,  and  remuneration  system.  The  project  will  be\ncofinanced by the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development.\n\nThe World Bank is also providing assistance to higher education ($83.3 million), with the\n26.\nfocus on quality improvements for universities and building the capacity of institutions for higher\neducation.  Earlier,  the sources of  support for  higher education  included  Canada for  institutional\nlinkages between Canadian and Vietnamese universities ($8.2 million), Japan for upgrading Can\nTho  University  ($20.5  million),  and  the  Netherlands  for  strengthening  university  research\ncapabilities ($5 million).\n\n27.\nThe  Bank  is  a  key  funding  agency  for  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training\n(TVET), with a project for $54 million aimed at improving the quality of 15 key TVET institutions to\nserve  as  demonstration  schools  in  disseminating  nationwide  TVET  reforms.11  The  project  is\n\n                                               \n11 Loan 1655-VIE: Vocational and Technical Education Project, for $54 million, approved on 11 December 1998.\n\n\f9\n\ncofinanced by France and the Nordic Development Fund, and probably Japan. Earlier assistance\nto  TVET  came  from  Germany  for  vocational  teacher  training  schools  ($12  million)  and  the\nRepublic of Korea for renovating two vocational training schools ($5.3 million).\n\nThe Bank has taken the lead role  in providing  assistance to  lower  secondary education,\n28.\ninitiated  by  Loan  1537-VIE  (para.  2),  for  $50  million,  focusing  on  the  development  of  a  new\ncurriculum,  textbooks,  and  teacher  manuals  for  lower  secondary  schools  as  well  as  for  lower\nsecondary  in-service  teacher  training;  provision  of  teaching  aids;  and  rehabilitation  of  lower\nsecondary schools in selected provinces. The Project is cofinanced by Belgium. With the growing\nnumber  of  funding  agencies  actively  involved  in  the  education  sector,  there  is  a  need  for  aid\ncoordination. This Project has taken the initiative to coordinate a round table meeting in January\n1999  to  increase  coordination  among  funding  agencies,  avoid  duplicating  efforts,  and  explore\ncofinancing  possibilities  for  the  Project.  Continuing  dialogue  between  the  Government  and\nfunding agencies has helped shape the Government\u2019s education policy and planning directions.\nDetailed external assistance to the education sector is in Appendix 3.\n\nF.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n29.\nNone of the Bank education projects in Viet Nam has been completed yet. However, Bank\nprojects in other sectors and education projects of bilateral funding agencies in Viet Nam indicate\nthat the inadequate experience of executing agencies  (EAs)  in  international  competitive bidding\nand accounting procedures have delayed project implementation. The situation has improved in\nthe past two years due to the Bank\u2019s assistance in preparing the Project Accounting Manual. The\nlessons  learned  from  postevaluated  Bank  education  projects  in  other  countries  are  as  follows:\n(i) insufficient assessment of institutional capacity during project preparation, leading to excessive\ninvestments  in hardware  and  inadequate  provision of  software  to  ensure  quality  improvements;\n(ii)  insufficient  provision  of  physical  infrastructure,  which  has  made  it  difficult  to  ensure  quality\nimprovements;  (iii) poor  coordination  among  concerned  institutions at  various  levels;  (iv) lack  of\nthe benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME) subcomponent to assess project progress; (v) lack of\na  mechanism \nthe  Government;\n(vi) implementation  delay  due  to  delays  in  the  appointment  of  consultants  and  in  procurement;\n(vii) implementation  delay  due  to  lack  of  detailed  planning  and  implementation  of  projects  to\nassist EAs; and (viii) the need to ensure high quality education that enables students to become\nproductive citizens who can adapt to a rapidly changing environment.\n\nrecurrent  budgetary  support  by \n\nto  ensure  adequate \n\n30.\nThese lessons have been incorporated in the project design, which will provide substantial\nsupport to the institutional aspects, including training in technical skills and project implementation\nprocedures.  The  Project  will  also  provide  sufficient  physical  infrastructure  to  upgrade  TTC\nfacilities to ensure quality improvements.  The  subcomponent on project  implementation  support\nhas  built-in  BME.  Detailed  planning  and  implementation  of  the  Project,  together  with  the  Bank\nprocedures  for  procurement,  will  be  provided  to  the  EA  during  inception.  Since  the  Bank  has\napproved  advance  action  for  consultant  selection,  the  Bank  procedures  for  selection  were\nexplained to MOET in detail to facilitate the preparation of bid documents and the short-listing of\nconsulting firms. One of the international consultants for the Project will assist the EA in various\naspects of project administration and financial management over a long period.\n\nG.\n\nThe Bank\u2019s Sectoral Strategy\n\nThe Bank\u2019s operational  strategy for  Viet  Nam places high  priority  on  sustainable  growth\n31.\nwith  equity  and  environmentally  sound  development.  The  strategy  aims  at  facilitating  the\ntransition and restructuring of the economy under market-based principles by promoting efficient\neconomic  growth,  human  development,  women\u2019s  status,  poverty  reduction,  and  environmental\n\n\f10\n\npreservation.  A  key  means  of  achieving  these  objectives  is  to  improve  basic  social  services,\nespecially  basic  education  (primary  and  lower  secondary  education  combined)  with  the\ndisadvantaged groups (including women and the rural poor) as special target.\n\nto  basic  education, \n\nGiven  the  importance  of  basic  education  as  a  foundation  for  long-term  economic\n32.\ndevelopment  and  subsequent  poverty  reduction,  the  Bank\u2019s  priority  for  the  education  sector\nemphasizes  equitable  access \ntogether  with  quality  and  efficiency\nimprovements.  Since  primary  education  has  been  strongly  addressed  by  the  World  Bank  and\nother funding agencies, the Bank\u2019s focus is on expanding access to lower secondary education to\nmeet the increasing social demand, while improving its quality and efficiency. In the medium term,\nimproving the quality  of  the  teacher  training  system  will  be a  major  Bank  strategy for achieving\noverall improvements in the lower secondary education subsector and, hence, poverty reduction.\nThis  strategy  coincides  with  the  Government\u2019s  strategy,  which  accords  high  priority  to  teacher\ntraining  improvement.  Since  the  Government  emphasizes  increasing  access  to  TTCs  by\nexpanding  their  physical  capacity,  the  Project  will  complement  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  by\nfocusing  on  improving  the  quality  of  the  preservice  teacher  training  system.  It  will  also  create\nsynergies  with  Loan  1537-VIE,  which  is  improving  the  quality  of  the  lower  secondary  school\ncurriculum and the in-service teacher training system.\n\nH.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n33.\nThe Bank\u2019s policy dialogue with the Government focuses on the potential contributions of\nthe  Project  to  promote  (i) lower  secondary  education  reforms,  (ii) poverty  reduction,  and\n(iii) project sustainability.\n\n1.\n\nLower Secondary Education Reforms\n\n34.\nThe  Government  has  agreed  to  adjust,  with  the  assistance  of  a  curriculum  steering\ncommittee (CSC),12 some features of the preservice teacher training program for lower secondary\neducation  prior  to  revising  its  curriculum.  The  agreed  upon  adjustments  will  also  promote  cost-\neffectiveness in the use of the Government\u2019s scarce education resources in that they will allow for\nmore efficient utilization of lower secondary school teachers in the future as the new teachers will\nbe  able  to  teach  more  than  one  subject  and  to  do  more  effective  teaching.  The  adjustments,\nwhich will also be formally approved prior to revising the existing TTC curriculum, are as follows:\n(i) institution of a double major system with an approximately 60:40 major and minor subject ratio,\nwithout a reduction in the number of credits allocated to the major subject; (ii) regrouping of the\nTTC  major-minor  subject  combinations  to  be  consistent  with  the  new  lower  secondary  school\nsubject  groups  proposed  under  Loan  1537-VIE;  (iii) increase  in  the  number  of  credits  for\nobservation and practice teaching in lower secondary schools, without a reduction in the number\nof credits allocated to teaching methodologies; (iv) reinstitution of an external assessment system\nfor  measuring  TTC  performance  and  standardizing  certification;  and  (v) increase  in  the  yearly\nintake  of  TTC  students  to  match  the  rapid  growth  in  the  number  of  lower  secondary  school\nstudents projected in Appendix 2 so as to reduce the lower secondary student/teacher ratio from\nthe 1998 level of 29:1 to a smaller ratio during the project period.\n\n2.\n\nPoverty Reduction\n\n35.\nSince ethnic minorities are the poorest of the poor, the Government agreed to implement\nthe  project  ethnic  minority  strategies  as  a  means  of  promoting  poverty  reduction  as  follows:\n                                               \n12 The  Government is  planning  to  establish a  CSC  in  January  2000.  The  CSC  will  be  chaired  by  MOET\u2019s key  policy\nmaker on teacher training and include other policy experts on lower secondary education and teacher training from\nMOET and DOETs as well as curriculum experts from TTUs, TTCs, NIES, etc.\n\n\f11\n\n(i) providing  textbooks,  under  a  textbook  lending  scheme,  to  the  poorest  50  percent  of  TTC\nstudents  (including  all  ethnic  minority  students)  in  10  selected  disadvantaged  provinces  and  in\nthree  cities  where  three  model  TTCs  will  be  developed;  (ii) improving  TTC  pre-entrance\nqualifications for prospective ethnic minorities under a transition program in the 10 disadvantaged\nprovinces and subsequently enrolling them as TTC students under the Government\u2019s scholarship\nprogram for ethnic minority students; and (iii) giving ethnic minorities who work at MOET, DOETs,\nand TTCs priority in the Project\u2019s staff development programs.\n\n3.\n\nProject Sustainability\n\n36.\nThe  Government  agreed  to  (i) sustain  the  Project  after  completion,  using  financial\ncontributions (equal to 3 percent of the total investment costs of civil works and 5 percent of the\ntotal investment costs of equipment and furniture) to be provided by the provincial governments\nfor the O&M of these project inputs; and (ii) give priority to lower secondary education (alongside\nprimary education) so as to facilitate universal lower secondary education at least in urban areas\nby 2010 by increasing the percentage share of the lower secondary recurrent budget in the total\nrecurrent  education  budget  from  20  percent  to  21  percent  during  the  project  period,  and\nincreasing it further by a few more percent in the postproject period, after primary education has\nachieved full universal status and quality improvement target.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\nThe  increasing  market  orientation  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economic  activities,  together  with  the\n37.\ngrowing number of graduates of primary education, is creating a substantial social demand  and\nmanpower  requirements  for  a  workforce  with  education  beyond  primary  school  and  capable  of\nassimilating  new  concepts  and  modern  means of  production. While  primary  education  provides\nbasic cognitive skills, lower secondary  education provides  the  solid foundation for  producing  an\nadaptive  and  competitive  workforce  to  sustain  high  economic  growth.  Enrollments  in  lower\nsecondary  schools  have  increased  significantly  from  3.1  million  students  in  1993  to  5.3  million\nstudents  in  1997,  an  average  annual  enrollment  growth  rate  of  about  14  percent.  The\nGovernment  projected  that  enrollments  will  reach  7.9  million  students  by  2005.  This  rapid\nexpansion has resulted in the deteriorating quality of lower secondary education, aggravated by\ndouble  and  triple  shifting  to  accommodate  such  a  rapid  expansion.  The  poor  quality  of  lower\nsecondary  education  is  caused  mainly  by  an  unsuitable  curriculum  and  shortages  of  physical\nfacilities  and  human  resources  (textbooks,  instructional  materials,  and  qualified  teachers).  In\n1997,  almost  20 percent  of  the  lower  secondary  teachers  remained  underqualified.  The  lack  of\nadequately  trained  teachers  to  meet  the  demand  of  a  modern  curriculum  and  to  do  effective\nteaching  is  also  a  major  cause  of  low  internal  efficiency  in  lower  secondary  education.  This  is\nindicated by the high dropout and repetition rates of 8.1 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, in\n1997.\n\n38.\nPoor teaching quality stems from an unsuitable  teacher  training  curriculum  and  teaching\nmethods, overcrowded facilities, and lack of management capacity. Classroom teaching focuses\non memorization, rather than on active learning. Teachers are trained in only one major subject\nand  one  minor  subject.  This  results  in  overspecialization  in  subject  knowledge  and  inefficient\nutilization of  staff  teaching  across  subject groups since  they are generally  unable to teach  their\nminor  subjects.  While  in-service  teacher  training  can  improve  the  teaching  performance  of\nexisting lower secondary teachers, the training of new teachers through an improved preservice\nsystem is needed as a long-term solution to the problem of low teaching quality. This training will\nenhance overall teachers\u2019 performance and their ability to handle the new lower secondary school\n\n\f12\n\ncurriculum and  in-service  teacher training  system  being  developed under Loan  1537-VIE.  It  will\nalso prepare a sufficiently large number of qualified new lower secondary school teachers in the\nnear  future  to  improve  or  at  least  maintain  the  student/teacher  ratio  of  29:1  in  1998  to  avoid\nfurther deterioration in teaching quality. In the Government projections of the demand and supply\nof  lower  secondary  school  teachers  (Appendix  2),  the  demand  for  and  supply  of  teachers  are\nmeasured  by  the  student/teacher  ratio.  The  projections  have \nthe\nGovernment\u2019s teacher expansion plan.\n\ninto  account \n\ntaken \n\nAnother problem related to teacher training is weak institutional capacity in management\n39.\ndue to insufficient qualified staff and weak coordination among Government  agencies  (including\nMOET, DOETs, TTUs, and TTCs) involved in teacher training. Another problem is limited access\nto  enrollment  in  TTCs  in  disadvantaged  areas  despite  the  nationwide  doubling  of  annual  TTC\nenrollments  in  the  lower  secondary  education  program  during  1994-1997  from  about  7,000  to\n15,000  students  per  year.  The  problem  is  caused  by  inadequate  physical  capacity  of  TTCs  in\nthose  areas  (including  classrooms,  library  and  laboratory  spaces,  and  study  areas)  and\ninadequate  incentives  to  encourage  higher  enrollment  of  disadvantaged  groups,  especially  the\nethnic minorities.\n\n40.\nThe Government has requested the Bank to continue its lead role in the development of\nlower secondary education through a project to improve the preservice training system for lower\nsecondary  education  teachers.  The  Project  is  in  line  with  the  Bank\u2019s  Country  Operational\nStrategy,  which  emphasizes  efficient  economic  growth  with  equity,  poverty  reduction,  and\nenvironmentally sound development. The Project is also in line with the Government\u2019s priority in\nthe education sector, which emphasizes teacher training development as a key strategy for basic\neducation  reforms.  While  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  focuses  on  expansion  of  the  physical\ncapacity of TTCs to catch up with the rapid expansion of lower secondary school enrollments, the\nProject will complement the Government\u2019s efforts by focusing on quality improvements of the TTC\ncurriculum and institutional capacity strengthening of Government agencies involved in providing\nteacher training. The EA also has the requisite experience to carry out the Project, and the sector\npolicies have good potential for improvement.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n41.\nThe overall  objective  of  the  Project  is to  assist  the  Government  in  improving  the  quality\nand efficiency of the lower secondary education subsector by providing lower secondary students\nwith a sufficient number of qualified teachers. The specific objectives are to improve the quality,\naccess to, and institutional capacity of the preservice teacher training system for lower secondary\neducation.  The  improvements  in  quality  and  institutional  capacity  aspects  will  be  nationwide,\nwhereas  the  improvements  in  access  will  focus  on  10  selected  disadvantaged  provinces  (Ha\nGiang,  Lao  Cai,  Lai  Chau,  Thanh  Hoa,  Binh  Dinh,  Quang  Nam,  Quang  Ngai,  Binh  Phuoc,  Tra\nVinh,  and  Soc  Trang).  The  Project  has  three  components:  (i) improving  the  quality  of  the\npreservice  teacher  training  program  for  lower  secondary  education  by  redesigning  the  TTC\ncurriculum,  revising  student  textbooks  and  teacher  manuals,  providing  these  instructional\nmaterials  to  TTC  libraries  and  to  disadvantaged  students  through  a  textbook  lending  scheme,\nproviding orientation on the new curriculum and instructional materials, upgrading the knowledge\nof  TTC teachers, providing  support for  the development  of  three  model  TTCs  in  three  selected\ncities  (Hanoi,  Hue,  and  HCMC),  where  the  new  curriculum  and  instructional  materials  will  be\npiloted,  and  reestablishing  an  external  assessment  system  for  TTC  certification;  (ii) improving\nfacilities  and  access  to  TTCs  in  some  disadvantaged  provinces  by  providing  facilities  and  a\ntransition program to improve pre-entrance qualifications to  TTCs for ethnic  minorities  in  the  10\nselected disadvantaged provinces; and (iii) strengthening the institutional capacity of Government\nagencies  involved  in  preservice  teacher  training  by  providing  training  in  management  and\n\n\f13\n\ntechnical  skills  to  relevant  staff at  the  central,  provincial,  and  college  levels  involved  in  teacher\ntraining so as to support and sustain the reforms.\n\n42.\nThe  project  components  and  subcomponents  were  designed  based  on  a  bottom-up\n(participatory) approach, with substantial discussions with and involvement by the private sector,\nespecially provincial stakeholders\u2014TTC teachers and students, lower secondary school teachers\nand students, parents, community groups, and representatives of major ethnic minority groups in\nthe  10  disadvantaged  provinces  and  the  three  cities  selected  for  development  of  model  TTCs.\nThe ethnic minority representatives provided useful information for the design of the project ethnic\nminority  strategies.  These  strategies  (detailed \nin  some\nsubcomponents. This private sector involvement proved essential in the design of the Project and\nin the establishment of provincial ownership of the Project. For example, during the design phase,\nthe major provincial community groups in the 10 provinces and the three cities agreed to provide\nfinancial contributions, through their provincial DOETs, as part of the O&M costs for maintaining\nthe civil works and equipment to be provided by the Project (para. 58). The project components\nand subcomponents are described below.\n\nin  Appendix  4)  are  reflected \n\n1.\n\nQuality  Improvement  of  Preservice  Teacher  Training  Program  for  Lower\nSecondary Education\n\nThis component aims at improving the quality of the existing preservice training program\nits  delivery  system  nationwide.  Seven\n\n43.\nfor \nsubcomponents were designed to achieve the quality improvement target.\n\nlower  secondary  education \n\nteachers  and \n\na.\n\nCurriculum Redesign\n\n44.\nThe  existing  TTC  curriculum  (inclusive  of  a  syllabus  for  each  TTC  subject,  teaching\nmethodologies,  and  student  assessment  system)  will  be  redesigned  to  meet  the  modern\nrequirements of the new lower secondary school curriculum developed under Loan 1537-VIE. A\ndouble  major  system  will  be  instituted  at  TTCs  and  the  combination  of  TTCs\u2019  major-minor\nsubjects will be reorganized in line with the new lower secondary school subject groups as well as\nwith  the  demand  for  teachers  in  each  subject  group.  The  revised  curriculum  will  incorporate\nenvironmental  topics  in  the  relevant  subjects  to  create  environmental  awareness  among  TTC\nteachers  and  students.  Teaching  methodologies  will  be  revised  to  focus  on  a  student-centered\napproach.\n\nThe CSC (para. 34) will assist the Government to (i) determine key directions required to\n45.\nadjust  the  existing  TTC  program  prior  to  revising  its  curriculum,  the  proposed  adjustments  of\nwhich are specified in para. 34; (ii) facilitate approval of the proposed adjustments; (iii) determine\nkey  direction  of  changes  in  the  existing  TTC  curriculum  prior  to  the  revision;  and  (iv) facilitate\napproval for the revised curriculum as well as for the remaining activities. Prior to the curriculum\nredesign, about 15 curriculum experts (1 person per subject) from MOET and TTUs will go on a\nshort-term overseas study visit for orientation to teacher training program design and curriculum\ndevelopment. About 20 remaining curriculum experts from MOET, TTUs, and TTCs will undertake\nsimilar short-term  orientation  in-country  delivered  by  an  international  consultant and  a  domestic\nconsultant.  Both  consultants  will  be  engaged  for  revising  the  curriculum  and  providing  some\ntraining.13 The detailed staff development plan is in Appendix 5, consulting services requirements\nare in Appendix 6, and the indicative terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 7.\n\n                                               \n13 The type of training to be provided by each international and domestic consultant is mentioned in detail in Appendix\n\n7.\n\n\f14\n\nb.\n\nInstructional Materials Development\n\n46.\nAbout  300  TTC  student  textbooks  for  15  TTC  subjects  taught  over  three  years  will  be\nrevised and about 45 TTC teacher manuals following the new TTC curriculum will be developed\nby  local  textbook  writers,  with  the  assistance  of  international  and  domestic  consultants.  The\nrevised  textbooks  and teacher  manuals  will  be  reviewed  by  the  curriculum  expert  team.  Before\nthe textbook revision, about 15 textbook experts (1 person per subject) from MOET and TTUs will\nbe  sent  on  a  short-term  overseas  study  visit  for  orientation  to  textbook  development  and\npublications.  About  228  textbook  writers  from  MOET,  DOETs,  TTUs,  and  TTCs  will  be  trained\nshort-term  in-country  by  the  international  and  domestic  consultants  (66  persons  trained  in\ntextbook development and publications, 81 in teaching methodologies and  student assessment,\nand  81  in  syllabus  design  and  web-based  modules  development).  With  the  assistance  of  the\ntextbook  writing  team,  the  consultants  will  also  develop  teaching  aids  for  the  new  curriculum,\nusing  local  materials.  Some  special  teaching  methodologies  and  teaching  aids  for  ethnic\nminorities  will  also be designed  to  make  classroom  instruction  more  relevant  and  interesting  to\nthem. The textbook writing team will assist a team of local internet service providers (ISPs), who\nwill be hired to translate the revised curriculum, textbooks, and teacher manuals into web-based\nmodules for  inclusion  on  an  internet  site  to  be  used  mainly  by  TTC  teachers  for  cost-effective,\nself-study distance learning of the new curriculum and textbooks.\n\nAfter the student textbooks and  teacher  manuals  have been  revised, prior  to nationwide\n47.\nimplementation,  they  will  be  pilot-tested  in  the  three  cities  where  model  TTCs  are  to  be\ndeveloped. The implementation procedure of the new TTC curriculum will follow that of the new\nlower  secondary  school  curriculum  to  be  carried  out  under  Loan  1537-VIE.  For  example,  the\nrevision  of  the  TTC  curriculum  can  only  take  place  after  the  completion  of  the  writing  of  the\noutlines of  lower  secondary  school  textbooks  and  teacher  manuals  for  all  grades  (grades  6-9),\ntentatively by the end of quarter I of the year 2000 (as shown in the implementation schedules of\nthe  new  lower  secondary  school  and  TTC  curricula  in  Appendix  8).  Subsequently,  it  will  take\nabout  two  years  (until  quarter  I,  2002)  to  complete  revising  the  TTC  curriculum  and  writing  the\noutlines  of  textbooks  as  well  as  teacher  manuals  for  the  entire  TTC  program  (years  1-3).  The\nwriting  of  the  whole  textbooks  and  teacher  manuals  for  year  1  will  then  take  place  and  be\ncompleted within two quarters (until quarter III, 2002), after which pilot tests of these materials for\nyear 1 can be conducted and completed within one year prior to nationwide implementation. The\nimplementation  of  year  2  and  year  3  textbooks  and  teacher  manuals  can  follow  the  same\nprocedure as that of year 1 in a cascading manner, so that the nationwide implementation of year\n3  textbooks  and  teacher  manuals  can  start  within  the  Project  period  (2000-2006).  Prior  to\nnationwide implementation, the revised TTC textbooks and teacher manuals will be finalized and\npublished,  taking  into  account  the  results  of  the  pilot  tests  of  the  lower  secondary  school\ntextbooks and the TTC textbooks.\n\nc.\n\nProvision of Instructional Materials\n\n48.\nEach of the 61 TTC libraries will receive about 50 sets of TTC student textbooks and 10\nsets of teacher manuals for all TTC subjects taught in three years. About 50 sets of the new lower\nsecondary school student textbooks and workbooks as well as teacher manuals to be developed\nunder Loan 1537-VIE will also be given to each of the 61 TTC libraries for use by teachers and\nstudents  as  reference  materials.  Book  lots  will  be  procured  from  the  Government\u2019s  Education\nPublishing House.\n\n49.\nA  textbook  lending  scheme  will  be  developed  by  an  international  consultant  and  a\ndomestic consultant to allow the poorest 50 percent of TTC students (about 12,000 students) in\nthe  10  disadvantaged  provinces  and  in  the  three  cities  with  model  TTCs  to  borrow  textbooks\n\n\f15\n\nwithout having to pay. Textbooks will be lent out to these needy students, perhaps on a sharing\nbasis, at the beginning of the school year and collected back at the end of the year for reissue to\na new cohort of students in the following year, assuming a three-year life of textbooks. The same\nconsultants  will  give  40  administrators  from  MOET,  DOETs,  and  TTCs  short-term  in-country\ntraining in textbook lending scheme operations to enable the administrators to operate, monitor,\nand  sustain  the scheme.  Since  this  subcomponent  is  designed  to  benefit  the  poor  including  all\nethnic  minority  students,  it  is  part  of  the  project  ethnic  minority  strategies  described  in  detail  in\nAppendix 4.\n\nd.\n\nOrientation to New Curriculum and Textbooks\n\n50.\nA  series  of  short-term  in-country  workshops  will  be  conducted  by  the  textbook  writing\nteam  and  the  international  and  domestic  consultants  (who  will  help  develop  the  textbooks)  for\nabout 335 MOET, DOET, and TTC administrators as well as 915 TTC lead subject teachers and\nabout 4,085 TTC teachers from 61 TTCs all over  the  country.  The  purpose  will be to orient  the\nparticipants  with  the new  TTC  curriculum  including  the  new  syllabus  for  each  subject,  teaching\nmethodologies,  and  the  new  student  assessment  system;  student  textbooks;  and  teacher\nmanuals. About half of the TTC teachers will be subject to periodic subject implementation review\nuntil project completion.\n\ne.\n\nUpgrading TTC Teachers Qualifications\n\n51.\nA limited number of about 200 one-year overseas scholarships and about 1,000 in-country\njoint-program  scholarships  will  enable  TTC  teachers  to  undertake  the  MA/M.Ed.  in  their\nrespective  subject areas, along  with  short-term  in-country  English  language training at  TTUs  or\nlocal  language  institutions  prior  to  the  studies.  Candidates  for  both  programs  will  be  selected\ncompetitively  from  all  TTCs  nationwide  on  the  basis  of  criteria  agreed  upon  with  the  Bank\n(academic  background,  English  language  proficiency,  age,  etc.).  The  selected  candidates  will\nsign agreements that upon completion of their program of studies, they will return to and serve in\ntheir respective institutions for three years for each year of study. Priority will be given to female\ncandidates, who will constitute about 60 percent of the total candidates. Candidates for in-country\nscholarships  will  be  sent  to  selected  local  TTUs,  which  will  establish  joint  MA/M.Ed.  programs\nwith well-recognized foreign universities selected competitively from the Bank\u2019s member countries\non  the  basis  of  criteria  agreed  upon  with  the  Bank.  The  Government  will  select  at  least  three\nprospective local TTUs, which already have strong linkages with foreign universities. In addition,\nabout  45  TTC  lead  subject  teachers  (3  persons  per  subject)  will  be  sent  to  foreign  universities\noverseas for short-term training in teaching methodologies in their respective subject areas. They\nwill  first  be  provided  with  short-term  in-country  English  language  training  at  TTUs  or  at  local\nlanguage institutions. Foreign universities for overseas MA/M.Ed. studies and short-term training\nwill be selected competitively from the Bank\u2019s  member  countries on  the basis of  criteria agreed\nupon with the Bank.\n\n52.\nUpon completion of the MA/M.Ed. programs, the trained TTC teachers will offer for about\n915 TTC lead subject teachers a short-term in-country refresher course in their respective subject\nareas. The 45 TTC lead subject teachers, who will have  been  trained abroad,  will  also offer for\nthe  remaining  870  lead  subject  teachers  a  short-term  in-country  refresher  course  on  teaching\nmethodologies in their respective subject areas. The knowledge of TTC teachers will be upgraded\nthrough  orientation  workshops  on  the  use  of  web-based  modules  for  the  new  curriculum  and\ntextbooks.  The  first  workshops  will  be  conducted  by  the  textbook  writing  team,  the  consultants\nhired  to  help  revise  the  textbooks,  and  the  ISPs  hired  to  translate  the  revised  curriculum,\ntextbooks,  and  teacher  manuals  into  web-based  modules.  The  participants  will  be  about  66\nMOET, DOET and TTC administrators selected as subject coordinators. The second workshops\n\n\f16\n\nwill be conducted by the subject coordinators, the consultants, and the ISPs for about 915  TTC\nlead  subject  teachers  from  all  TTCs,  as  well  as  some  additional  68  MOET  and  DOET\nadministrators.  The  third  workshops  will  be  provided  at  TTCs  by  the  trained  TTC  lead  subject\nteachers for about 4,085 TTC teachers from all TTCs.\n\nf.\n\nSupport for Model and Specialized TTCs\n\n53.\nA  key  strategy  for  achieving  the  quality  improvements  goal  will  be  the  development  of\nthree model TTCs under DOETs in three selected cities from the north, central part, and south of\nthe country, which also have TTUs (Hanoi, Hue, and HCMC). The model TTCs will act as hubs in\nthe reform process, where the new TTC curriculum and materials will be piloted and disseminated\nand necessary training provided to TTC staff from other provinces. To develop the model TTCs,\neach  of  them  will  be provided  with  key  learning facilities  to facilitate  student  learning and  to  be\nused as venues for conducting training for other TTCs in the three regions. All TTCs face acute\nshortage  of  space  and  overcrowded  classrooms,  with  double  shifting.  The  provision  of  key\nlearning facilities will be based on the concept of effective utilization of limited space, not only to\nreduce  the  problem  of  space  shortages,  but  also  to  help  organize  and  utilize  the  new  space\neffectively  to  improve  the  learning  environment  and  encourage  modern  practices  and  teaching\nmethods. Included in the key learning facilities to be supported by the Project for each model TTC\nare  civil  works  for  on-campus  construction  of  (i) students\u2019  working  areas  or  study  areas,  which\ncan be combined with library reading areas; (ii) tutorial rooms, which can also be used as small\nclassrooms;  (iii) demonstration  classrooms  in  which  to  practice  modern  teaching  methods;\n(iv) teachers\u2019  common  room  for  lesson  preparation;  and  (v) computer  workstations  for  distance\nlearning  from  web-based  modules  on  the  new  curriculum  and  textbooks.  The  minimum  space\nrequired for the key learning facilities to be utilized effectively is about 750 square meters, at an\nestimated unit cost of about $100 per square meter. The space to be supported by the Project will\nbe determined by the number of TTC students. A sample design of the key learning facilities is in\nAppendix 9.\n\n54.\nThe  Project  will  equip  the  key  learning  facilities  with  furniture,  library  materials,  and\nequipment  (including  computers,  software,  desktop  publishing,  audiovisual  or  multimedia\nequipment), and provide operational support during project implementation. The Project will also\nprovide  the  laboratories  (language,  informatics,  and  sciences14)  of  the  three  model  TTCs  with\nequipment. The following training will be provided: (i) about three TTC administrators selected as\ncoordinators  for  the  key  learning  facilities  will  be  sent  on  a  short-term  overseas  study  visit  for\norientation to the  O&M  of  these  learning  facilities;  (ii) about  six  TTC  staff  selected  as  assistant\ncoordinators  for  the  key  learning  facilities  will  be  trained  short-term  in-country  in  O&M  of  the\nlearning facilities by an  international  consultant  and a domestic  consultant.  The  consultants  will\nalso  develop  an  operational  plan  of  model  TTCs  and  conduct  short-term  in-country  training  in\noperational  planning  of  model  TTCs  for  about  15  TTC  planning  administrators.  Short-term  in-\ncountry  training  on  O&M  of  the  language,  informatics,  and  sciences  laboratories  will  also  be\nprovided to about 30 TTC teachers (6, 6, and 18 persons, respectively). In addition to providing\nsupport  for  the  three  model  TTCs  under  DOETs,  the  Project  will  provide  the  necessary\ninstructional materials, furniture, and minor rehabilitation for three specialized TTCs under MOET\ncatering only to art and music, fields where shortages of teachers and facilities are most acute.\n\ng.\n\nReestablishment of an External Assessment Mechanism\n\nThe external assessment system earlier abolished will be  reestablished.  The  Project  will\n55.\nprovide the necessary equipment, consulting  support, and  training for  the design,  development,\n\n                                               \n14 Science laboratories include biology, chemistry, and physics.\n\n\f17\n\npiloting,  and  implementation  of  a  fully  computerized  TTC  quality  assurance  (QA)  system  to\nstandardize TTC performance and certification  through  the use  of  external  examinations. About\neight MOET and DOET staff selected as QA experts will be sent on a short-term overseas study\nvisit for orientation in TTC program certification. About five staff will be sent for orientation in TTC\nprogram evaluation. About 50 additional QA experts from MOET and TTCs will receive short-term\nin-country  training  in  test  construction  and  grading,  and  about  195  exam  coordinators  from\nMOET,  DOETs,  and  TTCs  will  be  trained  in  QA  system  implementation  by  an  international\nconsultant and a domestic consultant. These consultants will also assist in the development, pilot-\ntesting, and implementation of the external assessment system.\n\n2.\n\nImproved Facilities and Access to TTCs in Disadvantaged Provinces\n\nAlthough the Project was designed to improve the quality and institutional capacity of the\n56.\npreservice  teacher  training  system  for  lower  secondary  education  nationwide,  it  targeted  10\nselected  disadvantaged  provinces  for  improving  TTC  facilities  and  access  (Appendix  10).  The\nprovinces (para. 41) were selected on the basis of poverty, facilities shortages at teacher training\ninstitutions,  and  regional  disadvantages  (including  large  proportions  of  ethnic  minorities  in  the\nnorth, flood-prone areas in the central part and the south, and newly created provinces in need of\nbasic facilities in the central part and the south). Increasing access to TTCs for ethnic minorities\nwill  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  the  long  run  since  these  minorities  are  the  poorest  of  the\npoor. Poverty incidence among the main ethnic minority groups (e.g., Hmong, Muong, Tay, Thai,\nCro,  Hre,  Khmer,  and  Stieng)  in  the  10  provinces  ranges  from  66  percent  for  the  Tay  to  100\npercent  for  the  Hmong,  compared  with  48  percent  for  the  majority  Kinh  and  51  percent\nnationwide. Given  the  poor  status of  the  10 provinces, this project  component  was designed  to\nimprove their status\u2014to improve physical facilities of their TTCs and to improve human resources\nof the poorest population groups through increasing access to TTCs for these groups. The three\nsubcomponents  are  (i)  upgrading  the  TTC  facilities  in  the  10  provinces,  (ii)  improving  the  TTC\npre-entrance qualification of ethnic minorities in the 10 provinces, and (iii) providing instructional\nsupport resources to other provinces.\n\na.\n\nUpgrading TTC Facilities in 10 Disadvantaged Provinces\n\nThe  Project  will  support  the  construction  in  the  10  disadvantaged  provinces  of  key\n57.\nlearning facilities similar to those in the three model TTCs. The support will include civil works for\nthe  construction  of  the  key  learning  facilities  on  campus  and  the  same  kind  of  equipment,\nfurniture,  and  library  materials  as  those  provided  for  the  three  model  TTCs,  depending  on\navailable space.  The  laboratories  (language,  informatics, and  sciences)  of  the  10  provinces  will\nalso be provided  with  laboratory equipment  similar  to those  provided for  the  laboratories  of  the\nthree model TTCs, depending on the size of the laboratories. The same kind of training related to\nthe  O&M  of  the  key  learning  facilities  for  the  three  model  TTCs  will  also  be  provided  here,\nincluding a short-term overseas study visit for about 10 TTC staff selected as coordinators for the\nkey learning facilities for orientation in the O&M of the learning facilities; and short-term in-country\ntraining  conducted  by  an  international  consultant  and  a  domestic  consultant  for  about  20  TTC\nstaff  selected  as  assistant  coordinators  for  the  key  learning  facilities  for  the  same  kind  of\norientation.  In  addition,  short-term  in-country  training  in  O&M  of  the  language,  informatics,  and\nsciences  laboratories  will  be  conducted  for  about  50  TTC  teachers  (10,  10,  and  30  persons,\nrespectively).  The  10  TTCs  will  also  be  provided  with  the  necessary  facilities  for  physical\neducation.\n\n58.\nThe  Government  has  agreed  to  secure  a  written  confirmation  of  the  following\ncommitments  from  DOET  in  each  of  the  10  provinces  and  three  cities,  whose  TTC  will  be\nprovided with the key learning facilities and laboratory equipment: (i) DOET will be the site of the\n\n\f18\n\nprovincial  project  implementation  unit  (PPIU)  and  will  assign  some  staff  to  be  PPIU\u2019s\ncoordinators,  equivalent  to  at  least  one  full-time  staff;  (ii)  DOET  will  provide  some  financial\ncontributions to the investment cost of civil works for the construction of the key learning facilities,\nthe percentage contributions of which will depend upon its internal arrangements with MOET and\nMPI;  (iii)  if  DOET  plans to build  more  space  in  excess  of  that  which  the  Project  had  agreed  to\nprovide, it will obtain additional funding support from other sources; (iv) DOET will provide yearly\nfinancial contributions to O&M costs of such civil works, together with equipment and furniture in\nsupport of the key learning facilities and with laboratory equipment, equal to at least 3 percent of\nthe total investment cost of the civil works, 5 percent of the total investment cost of the equipment\nand  furniture  for  the  key  learning  facilities,  and  5  percent  of  the  total  investment  cost  of  the\nlaboratory  equipment  during  and  after  the  project  period;  (v)  DOET  will  prepare  a  detailed\nmaintenance  and  repair  plan  for  the  key  learning  facilities,  furniture,  and  equipment  (including\nboth the equipment for the key learning facilities and that for the laboratories) for proper O&M and\nsubmit  the  plan  to  MOET  within  six  months  after  loan  effectiveness;  (vi)  with  its  own  budget,\nDOET will prepare a detailed feasibility study for the construction of the key learning facilities and\nsubmit the results to MOET within three months after loan effectiveness; and (vii) the key learning\nfacilities  will  be  built  on  a  TTC  campus  at  no  extra  cost  of  land  to  the  Project  (including  the\nGovernment\u2019s counterpart fund for the Project), and the estimated size of land, approximate costs\nof civil works, and a map of the location will be provided.\n\nb.\n\nImproving  TTC  Pre-Entrance  Qualification  of  Ethnic  Minorities  in\n10 Disadvantaged Provinces\n\n59.\nA  special  transition  program  to  enhance  TTC  pre-entrance  qualification  of  prospective\nethnic minorities (about 4,000 students or 800 students per year for five years) will be designed\nby  an  international  consultant  and  a  domestic  consultant,  and  implemented  in  the  10\ndisadvantaged provinces. Ethnic minorities who perform reasonably well in the transition program\nwill  be  admitted  to  TTCs  under  the  Government\u2019s  scholarship  program  for  ethnic  minority\nstudents.  All  the  candidates  from  the  transition  program  who  are  admitted  to  TTCs  will  sign\nagreements that upon the completion of their program of study, they will return to their respective\nhome  provinces  to  teach  in  the  lower  secondary  schools  for  three  years  for  each  year  of\nscholarship study. The transition program consists of four elements (Appendix 4).\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nBeneficiary  identification  recruitment  campaigns  will  be  conducted  in  the  10\nprovinces to enroll suitable trainees in the program.  The  campaigns  will  enhance\nthe  awareness  of  ethnic  minority  communities  about  the  advantages  of  sending\ntheir children (especially females) to school (including TTCs) as  well  as establish\ncoordination  mechanisms  between  the  provincial  DOETs  and  district  education\noffices  in  meeting  TTC  enrollment  targets.  Although  about  80  percent  of  overall\nTTC  students  are  females,  the  recruitment  for  this  transition  program  will  give  a\npriority (at least 60 percent) to ethnic minority females, who are more constrained\nby cultural attitudes compared with their male counterparts.\n\nIntensive  preparatory  courses  aimed  at  consolidating  foundation  knowledge\nusually  absorbed  at  the  secondary  school  level  will  be  developed  by  the\nconsultants.  These  courses  will  be  delivered  over  six  months  before  the\ncommencement of the TTC school year. Tutorial rooms to be built by this Project\nas part of the key learning facilities will be used as the training venues.\n\nSpecial remedial courses will be provided to ethnic minority students identified as\nhaving  pronounced  academic  weakness,  with  smaller  than  normal  class  size  to\npermit attention to individuals.\n\n\f19\n\n(iv)\n\nA  two-week orientation  program  conducted for  the newly  enrolled  ethnic  minority\nstudents will also provide TTCs with an opportunity to learn about their new ethnic\nminority students and the latter\u2019s particular needs (e.g., particular needs for female\nstudents). During this program, a student-mentor support bond will be established\nby partnering the new ethnic minority students with high performing urban students\nwilling to assist their peers in study.\n\nc.\n\nProviding Instructional Support Resources to Other Provinces\n\n60.\nTo upgrade equally all TTCs nationwide, the Project will also provide instructional support\nresources (e.g., laboratory equipment and necessary facilities for physical education), depending\non the  number  of  students,  to  TTCs  in  the  remaining  17  provinces15  not  covered  by  equipment\nprovision under Loan 1537-VIE. In addition, the Project will provide short-term in-country training\nin  O&M  of  the  language,  informatics,  and  science  laboratories  to  about  85  TTC  teachers  from\nthese provinces (17, 17, and 51 persons, respectively).\n\nThe  Government  has  agreed  to  secure  a  written  confirmation  of  the  following\n61.\ncommitments from DOET in each of the 17 provinces, whose TTC will be provided with a set of\nlaboratory equipment similar to those provided under Loan 1537-VIE: (i) DOET will provide yearly\nfinancial contributions to the O&M costs of such laboratory equipment equal to at least 5 percent\nof the total investment cost of the  equipment during  and  after the  project  period;  and  (ii)  DOET\nwill  prepare  a  detailed  maintenance  and  repair  plan  for  such  laboratory  equipment  for  proper\nO&M and submit the plan to MOET within six months after loan effectiveness.\n\n3.\n\nInstitutional Capacity Building and Project Implementation Support\n\n62.\nThis  component  aims  at  strengthening  the  capacity  of  Government  agencies  (MOET,\nDOETs,  and  TTCs)  involved  in  providing  preservice  teacher  training  for  lower  secondary\neducation  nationwide  to  enable  them  to  support  and  sustain  the  reforms.  There  are  two\nsubcomponents:  capacity  building \nfor  project\nimplementation.\n\nin  management  and \n\ntechnical  skills  and \n\na.\n\nStrengthening Management and Technical Skills\n\n63.\nThe Project will provide (i) about 59 MOET, DOET, and TTC administrators with a short-\nterm  overseas  study  visit  for  orientation  in  education  planning  and  management;  (ii) about  100\nMOET, DOET, and TTC administrators with one-year overseas M.Ed. scholarships in education\nplanning and management, together with short-term in-country English language training at TTUs\nor local language institutions prior to studies; (iii) about 244 DOET administrators with short-term\nin-country management training and about 610 DOET technical staff with technical skills training\n(e.g.,  simple  accounting,  etc.)  to  be  conducted  by  international  and  domestic  consultants  in\nmanagement and technical skills training and in education planning and management; (iv) about\n488  TTC  department  heads  with  short-term  in-country  management/leadership  training  to  be\nconducted by the same international and domestic consultants; (v) about 848 MOET, DOET, and\nTTC  staff  with  short-term  in-country  training  in  English  communication  skills  to  be  handled  by\nsome local language institutions; and (vi) about 337 MOET, DOET, and TTC staff with short-term\nin-country  internet  operations  training  to  be  conducted  by  the  ISPs.  The  candidates  for  M.Ed.\nstudies will be selected competitively from all TTCs nationwide based on the criteria agreed upon\nwith the Bank. The candidates will sign agreements that upon the completion of their programs of\n                                               \n15 The remaining 17 provinces are Tuyen Quang, Cao Bang, Lang Son, Bac Can, Thai Nguyen, Son La, Bac Ninh, Vinh\nPhuc,  Ninh  Binh,  Da  Nang,  Ninh  Thuan,  Kon  Tum,  Ba  Ria-Vung  Tau,  Kien  Giang,  Bac  Lieu,  Ca  Mau,  and  Binh\nThuan.\n\n\f20\n\nstudy, they will return to and serve in their respective institutions for three years for each year of\nstudy.  Foreign  universities  for  overseas  M.Ed.  studies  will  be  selected  competitively  from  the\nBank\u2019s  member  countries  on  the  basis  of  criteria  agreed  upon  with  the  Bank.  In  addition  to\nproviding training, the international and domestic consultants will also assist in designing training\ncourses and materials, establishing trainees\u2019 database, evaluating the results of the training, etc.\n\nb. \n\nProject Implementation Support\n\nThe  Project  will  provide  the  necessary  equipment,  furniture,  and  consultant  support  for\n64.\nproject implementation, by engaging (i) one long-term international consultant and one long-term\ndomestic  consultant  to  assist  in  project  administration  and  financial  management;  (ii) one\ninternational consultant for BME and one for midterm review; and (iii) three domestic consultants\n(one per region) for project operation and management. The Project will also provide short-term\nin-country  training  workshops  on  project  implementation  procedures  conducted  by  these\ninternational  and  domestic  consultants  on  an  annual  basis,  including  such  topics  as  good\ngovernance, procurement, disbursement, budget preparation,  use  of  the  imprest  account,  BME,\nmidterm review, and other project operation and financial  management.  The  participants  will  be\nabout  288  MOET,  DOET,  and  TTC  staff  directly  and  indirectly  involved  in  central  project\nimplementation. Since the Project also intends to enhance the project implementation capacity of\nprovincial  governments  in  all  aspects,  about  468  DOET  and  TTC  staff  directly  and  indirectly\ninvolved in provincial project implementation will be  trained  annually  in  all aspects  of  the above\nproject implementation by the same international and domestic consultants and by central project\nimplementation unit (PIU) staff.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n65.\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $35.4 million equivalent, of which an estimated\n$18.5  million, or  52 percent,  is  the foreign  exchange  cost,  including $1.1  million  interest  on  the\nproposed loan. The local currency cost is estimated at $16.9 million equivalent or 48 percent of\nthe total cost. A summary of the cost estimates is in Table 1.\n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n ($ million)\n\nItem\n\nQuality Improvement of Preservice Teacher Training\nIncreased Facilities and Access to TTCs \nInstitutional Capacity Building & Project Implementation \n\nTotal Base Cost\n\nContingenciesa\nInterest\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n7.4\n3.8\n4.4\n\n15.6\n\n1.8\n1.1\n\n8.7\n3.1\n2.8\n\n14.6\n\n2.3\n0.0\n\n16.1\n6.9\n7.2\n\n30.2\n\n4.1\n1.1\n\nTotal Cost\nTTC = teacher training college.\na Physical contingencies were calculated at 5 percent of base cost, whereas price contingencies were calculated using\nan estimated annual escalation of 2.4 percent for international prices and 8.0 percent for local prices, reflecting the\ndifferent inflation rates.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\n18.5\n\n16.9\n\n35.4\n\n\fD.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\n21\n\n66.\nIt is proposed that the Bank provide a loan of $25 million (70.6 percent of the total project\ncost) from its Special Funds resources to finance $18.1 million of the foreign exchange cost and\n$6.9 million equivalent of the local cost. The Bank loan will have a term of 32 years, including a\ngrace period of 8 years and an interest charge of 1 percent per annum during  the  grace period\nand 1.5 percent per annum thereafter, and equal amortization. The Government will provide $10\nmillion  equivalent  (28.3  percent  of  the  total  Project  cost)  as  counterpart  financing.  The\nGovernment  of  New  Zealand  has  agreed  to  provide,  on  a  tied  and  parallel  basis,  grant\ncofinancing  of  about  $133,333  equivalent  per  annum  over  the  first  three  years  of  the  project\nperiod, totaling about $400,000 equivalent (1.1 percent of the total project cost). The Government\nof New Zealand has also indicated a possibility of providing additional grant cofinancing after the\nfirst three years of the project period. A summary of the financing plan is in Table 2.

The  PSC  will  be  established  before  loan\neffectiveness.  It  will  be  chaired  by  the  relevant  MOET  Vice  Minister  and  will  include  senior\nrepresentatives  of  the  three  relevant  MOET  departments  (Teachers  Department,  Planning  and\nFinance Department, and International Relations Department) to ensure continuity with TA 2970-\nVIE (para. 2). Additional members will be senior representatives of other relevant departments of\nMOET  (Secondary  Education  Department,  Post-Graduate  Department,  Personnel  Department,\nand NIES) and of concerned agencies (including the Government Office, SBV, MOF, and MPI) as\nwell  as  the  project  manager  of  Loan  1537-VIE  to  ensure  close  coordination  and  synergies\nbetween the two Bank Projects. A representative from MOET\u2019s new department of examinations\nwill  be  included after  such  a  department  has  been  established.  The  PIU\u2019s  project  manager  will\nalso be a PSC member and serve as secretary to the PSC.\n\n68.\nThe PIU will  be headed by a full-time  project  manager,  who  will  be assisted  by five full-\ntime  assistant  project  managers  (for  Finance  and  Administration,  Curriculum  Development  and\nImplementation,  Procurement  and  Civil  Works,  Overseas  and  In-Country  Training,  and  Project\nMonitoring  and  Evaluation)  and  regional  coordinators  equivalent  to  three  full-time  staff  (for  the\nNorth,  Central,  and  South).  The  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  (i) detailed  project  planning,\nscheduling, and  implementation;  (ii) procurement of all  goods and  services;  (iii) recruitment  and\nsupervision of international and domestic consultants; (iv) project accounting, including arranging\nnecessary audits; (v) disbursement of project funds, including timely preparation of annual budget\nplan for counterpart fund  and  timely  submission  of  withdrawal  applications;  (vi) management  of\n\n\f22\n\nthe imprest account; and (vii) reporting to the Bank on project progress. A provincial PIU (PPIU)\nwill be established in each of the 10 disadvantaged provinces and three cities, totaling 13 PPIUs,\nto  (i)  coordinate  project  activities  with  the  respective  TTCs,  (ii)  assist  PIU  in  various  aspects  of\nproject implementation at the provincial level, and (iii) ensure provincial ownership of the Project.\nEach PPIU will be located at DOET\u2019s office. DOET in each of the 10 provinces and  three  cities\nwill  assign  some  staff,  equivalent  to  at  least  one  full-time  staff,  to  be  PPIU  coordinators.  For\nHanoi, one of the three cities, its TTC will also assign some staff equivalent to at least one full-\ntime staff to work for its PPIU with the assigned DOET staff.\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n69.\nThe Project  will  be  implemented  over  six  years  (2000-2006).  Consultant  recruitment  will\nbe an important activity during the first year to assist  in  project  implementation, development of\nvarious training programs, provision of some training, curriculum redesign, etc. Since the Project\nentails  TTC  curriculum  reforms,  the  first  two  years  of  the  Project  will  focus  on  revising  the\ncurriculum, textbooks, and teacher manuals (including teaching aids) for piloting those of year 1\n(of the three-year TTC program) in the third year of the Project and for nationwide implementation\nthereafter.  The  piloting  and  nationwide  implementation  of  year  2  and  year  3  textbooks  and\nteacher  manuals  will  follow  those  of  year  1  in  a  cascading  manner  so  that  by  the  end  of  the\nProject, the nationwide implementation of year 3 textbooks and teacher manuals can take place.\nThe detailed project implementation schedule is in Appendix 12.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement of Goods and Services\n\nAll  Bank-financed  procurement  for  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s\n70.\nGuidelines for Procurement. The civil works under the Project are small and scattered throughout\nthe  country  and  are  not  likely  to  attract  the  interest  of  international  contractors.  Thus,  the  civil\nworks  contracts  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures\nacceptable to the Bank. For minor rehabilitation of specialized TTCs for art and music that costs\nless  than  $50,000  equivalent,  the  civil  works  contracts  will  be  awarded  on  a  direct  purchase\nbasis.  Contracts  for  the  supply  of  goods  and  services  (including  equipment,  furniture,  and\ninstructional  materials)  are  expected  to be  small  and  are  not  expected  to  attract  the  interest  of\ninternational  suppliers.  Contracts  are  expected  to  be  less  than  $100,000  but  some  will  be\ngrouped together to form larger packages. Contracts of $500,000 or less will be awarded on the\nbasis  of  international  shopping  procedures.  Contracts  of  $100,000  or  less  will  be  procured  on\nlocal  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  or  direct  purchase  basis  acceptable  to  the  Bank.  Where  many\nsuppliers are locally available, procurement will be on a LCB basis; where provinces are remote,\nand there are a limited number of suppliers, procurement will be on a direct purchase basis from\nthe local supplier within the province, or from a regional supplier in a nearby province.  The PIU,\nin  collaboration  with  PPIUs,  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  procurement  complies  with\nthe Bank\u2019s requirements by (i) determining bid packages and proposing procurement methods as\napproved by the Bank, (ii) preparing detailed material lists and specifications, and (iii) evaluating\nbids and awarding contracts. Tentative procurement packages are in Appendix 13.\n\n4.\n\nConsulting Services and Key Training Opportunities\n\n71.\nConsulting  services  of  about  75  person-months  (international)  and  about  336  person-\nmonths (domestic) will be provided to support various aspects of the Project, including curriculum\ndesign;  materials  development  and  publications;  textbook  lending  scheme design;  development\nof  model  TTCs;  external  assessment  systems;  key  learning  facilities;  design  of  a  transition\nprogram to improve TTC pre-entrance qualification for ethnic minorities; education planning and\nmanagement;  management  and  technical  skills  training;  project  administration;  BME;  and\n\n\f23\n\nmidterm  review.  The  Government  will  select  and  engage  all  Bank-financed  consultants  in\naccordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to the Bank for the engagement of domestic consultants.\n\nKey  training  opportunities  will  be  provided  by  the  Project  to  (i) 200  well-qualified  TTC\n72.\nteachers  to  study  overseas  for  MA/M.Ed.  in  their  subject  areas  at  well-recognized  foreign\nuniversities;  (ii) 100  well-qualified  administrators  from  MOET,  DOETs,  and  TTCs  to  study\noverseas  for  M.Ed.  in  education  planning  and  management  at  well-recognized  foreign\nuniversities;  (iii) 1,000  well-qualified  TTC  teachers  to  study  in-country  for  MA/M.Ed.  in  their\nsubject areas under joint programs to be developed by selected local TTUs with well-recognized\nforeign  universities;  and  (iv) 45  well-qualified  TTC  lead  subject  teachers  to  study  overseas  for\nshort-term  courses  in  teaching  methodologies  for  their  subject  areas  at  well-recognized  foreign\nuniversities. Foreign universities for the key training opportunities in (i)-(iv) above will be selected\ncompetitively from all Bank member countries based on criteria agreed upon with the Bank.16 The\ncandidates for these key training opportunities will be selected competitively based on selection\ncriteria  agreed  upon  with  the  Bank  (academic  background,  English  language  proficiency,  age,\netc.).\n\n5. \n\nAdvance Action\n\nThe Bank has approved advance action for consultants selection. The Borrower has been\n\n73.\nadvised that advance action will not obligate the Bank to finance the Project.\n\n6.\n\nDisbursements, Reports, Accounts, and Auditing\n\n74.\nTo  expedite  project  implementation  through  the  timely  release  of  the  Bank\u2019s  share  of\nfunds  for  eligible  expenditures,  an  imprest  account  for  the  Project  will  be  established  at  a\ncommercial bank  designated  by  SBV  and  acceptable  to  the  Bank.  The  imprest  account  will  be\nestablished, operated, and liquidated in accordance with detailed arrangements agreed upon by\nthe  Borrower  and  the  Bank  and  in  accordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook\ndated June 1996. Statement of expenditure procedures in accordance with the handbook will be\npermitted for reimbursement of funds utilized for eligible expenditures under the Project and the\nliquidation of advances for payment from the imprest account.\n\n75.\nThe Government, acting through MOET, will maintain records and accounts adequate to\nidentify  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan.  The  PIU  will  maintain\nseparate  accounts  for  the  Project  and  ensure  that  all  accounts  and  financial  statements  are\naudited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  by  auditors  acceptable  to  the\nBank. Certified copies of such audited accounts will be submitted to the Bank within 12  months\nafter  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year.  The  PIU  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  on  the\nimplementation  of  the  Project  and  submit  them  to  the  Bank  within  30  days  of  the  respective\nquarters.  The  reports  will be  in  a format acceptable  to  the Bank and  will  indicate,  among  other\nthings, (i) the progress made against established targets, both  technical  and financial;  (ii) status\n\n                                               \n16 The  criteria  for  selecting  foreign  universities  for  overseas  MA/M.Ed.  and  for  overseas  short-term  training  include\n(i) be  internationally  recognized  universities;  (ii) have  existing  teacher  training  programs;  (iii) have  demonstrated\nexperience  in  providing  programs  and  special  services  for  foreign  students;  and  (iv) have  faculty  members  with\nexperience in developing countries, preferably in Asia. The criteria for selecting  foreign  universities  for  establishing\njoint  MA/M.Ed.  with  Vietnamese  universities  include  (i)-(iv)  above,  together  with  (v) have  previous  experience  in\nmanaging joint-MA/M.Ed. degree programs with developing country institutions, preferably in  Asia;  (vi) be  willing to\nissue a joint-MA/M.Ed. degree; (vii) propose suitable arrangements for ensuring that the MA/M.Ed.  program in  Viet\nNam is of similar quality to a degree  issued  in its  home  country;  and (viii) be capable  of  conducting courses  using\nInternet  technology.  Eligible  foreign  educational  institutions  from  all  Bank  member  countries  can  compete  for  the\ntraining opportunities.\n\n\f24\n\nof  management  indicators;  (iii) problems  encountered  during  the  quarter  and  steps  taken  or\nproposed  to  be  taken  to  resolve  the  problems;  (iv) compliance  with  loan  covenants;  and\n(v) proposed program activities to be undertaken during the succeeding quarter. The PIU will also\nprepare a project completion report and submit it to the Bank no later than three months following\nthe physical completion of the Project.\n\n7.\n\nMidterm Review\n\nIn  addition  to  regular  reviews,  the  Government  and  the  Bank  will  jointly  undertake  a\n76.\nmidterm review of the Project after the third year of implementation. The Project provides for the\npreparation of a midterm report prior to the joint review. The third annual operational review will\nalso provide input to the midterm review and will be extended to include a review of the project\nscope,  design,  policy  reforms,  institutional  reforms,  and  other  relevant  issues.  The  midterm\nreview  will  identify  changes  since  the  time  of  appraisal,  assess  implementation  performance\nagainst  project  performance  indicators,  reassess  the  impact  with  regard  to  future  project\nimplementation  and  sustainability,  review  and  establish  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  and\nidentify problems and constraints. Specific attention will be given to the progress of the revision of\nTTC  textbooks  and  teacher  manuals  (including  teaching  aids)  for  pilot  testing,  the  transition\nprogram to enhance TTC pre-entrance qualifications of the recruited ethnic minority students, the\ntextbook lending scheme, and the operations of the key learning facilities.\n\n8.\n\nProject Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n77.\nTo monitor the Project on a yearly basis, a set of general project performance indicators\nhas  been  developed  and  their  values  identified  (Appendix  2).  The  indicators  include  lower\nsecondary  GER;  NER;  completion  rate;  dropout  rate;  repetition  rate;  proportions  of  lower\nsecondary female students, female teachers, qualified teachers; students per class; teachers per\nclass;  qualified  teachers  per  class;  students  per  teacher;  and  students  per  qualified  teacher.\nAnother set of indicators, which are specific to project inputs, includes (i) TTC students trained in\nthe new curriculum; (ii) TTC teachers with MA; (iii) TTC enrollments of ethnic minorities in the 10\ndisadvantaged  provinces;  and  (iv) relevant  MOET,  DOET,  and  TTC  staff  qualified \nfor\nimplementing the teacher training reforms. The values of both the general and specific indicators\nwill  be  verified from  the  results  of  baseline  surveys.  Detailed  project-specific  indicators  (broken\ndown  by  sex  and  ethnic  minority  group  for  each  TTC  and  for  total  average)  will  be  developed\nduring the surveys. These may include, among others, lower secondary school subject areas that\nhave shortage and excess of teachers, the numbers of TTC teachers and students by year, TTC\ndropout  and  repetition  rates  by  year,  etc.  The  Project  will  also  provide  necessary  training  on\nproject  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  overall  training  on  project  implementation  to  PIU  and\nPPIU staff. The key performance indicators are in Appendix 14.\n\nF.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n78.\nMOET will be the EA. MOET has gained experience in project implementation mainly from\nthe  existing  Bank\u2019s  lower  secondary  education  project  (Loan  1537-VIE)  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s\nprimary  education  project.  In  addition  to  this  Project,  MOET  will  be  implementing  the  World\nBank\u2019s  higher  education  project  and  primary  teacher  training  project.  Nevertheless,  MOET\u2019s\nimplementation capacity needs to be strengthened, especially at the provincial level. The Project\nthus provides institutional capacity strengthening support for MOET, DOETs, PIU, and PPIUs in\nproject implementation, management, and other relevant technical skills.\n\n\f25\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\nTo  improve  environmental  awareness  among  TTC  teachers  and  students,  the  revised\n79.\nTTC curriculum will incorporate environmental topics in the relevant subjects, and the textbooks\nto  be  developed  and  distributed  will  have  suitable  emphasis  on  environmental  issues.  The\nenvironmental implications of the Project were reviewed and no adverse impacts were identified.\nMOET ensured that the siting, design, construction, and operations of the key learning facilities to\nbe  established  under  the  Project  will  follow  the  Bank\u2019s  Environmental Guidelines for Selected\nInfrastructure Development Projects and other relevant guidelines. DOET in each of the selected\n10  provinces  and  three  cities  have  agreed  to  allocate  a  small  plot  of  land  on  its  TTC  campus,\nowned by the provincial government, as the site for the key learning facilities. No resettlement will\nthus be involved. The provision of tubewells and toilets in the key learning facilities will improve\ngeneral sanitation. To increase local involvement and responsibility for investment in the Project,\neach of the 13 DOETs has agreed to prepare detailed feasibility design for the construction of the\nkey learning facilities based on the sample design provided in Appendix 9, following the concept\nof  effective  utilization  of  limited  space  of  the  key  learning  facilities.  These  DOETs  have  also\nagreed to provide some financial contributions for the O&M costs of the key learning facilities both\nduring and after the project period.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\na.\n\nEthnic Minorities\n\n80.\nEthnic minorities have low participation in education in Viet Nam: about 5 percent of lower\nsecondary  school  enrollments  and  8  percent  of  TTC  enrollments  in  the  10  disadvantaged\nprovinces.  The  Government  has  been  encouraging  the  participation  of  ethnic  minorities;  for\nexample,  at  the  primary  level,  special  programs  in  local  ethnic  minority  languages  have  been\nestablished  in ethnic  minority  areas  throughout  the  country.  At  the  lower  secondary  level,  such\nspecial  programs  are  not  provided.  However,  all  fees  are  waived  and  stipends  provided  in\naddition to the special boarding lower secondary schools catering only to ethnic minority students.\nUnder  Loan  1537-VIE,  appropriate  teaching  materials  and  teaching  aids  will  be  designed  for\nethnic minority students.\n\n81.\nAt  the  TTC  level,  although  ethnic  minority  students  are  also  provided  with  scholarships\nand  free  boarding  facilities,  these  incentives  are  not  sufficient  to  significantly  enhance  their\nenrollments in TTCs. The Project responds to this problem by designing ethnic minority strategies\nto enable them to have greater access to TTCs in the 10 selected provinces and to successfully\nparticipate in the TTC program without repeating the class or dropping out. To increase the ethnic\nminorities\u2019 access to TTCs, the Project will implement a special transition program to enhance the\nTTC  pre-entrance  qualification  of  prospective  candidates.  At  the  same  time,  to  retain  them  as\nsuccessful students at TTCs, the Project will implement a textbook loan scheme to provide them\nwith  free  textbooks  for  the  entire  three-year  program.  Special  teaching  methodologies  and\nteaching  aids  will  be  designed  to  make  classroom  instruction  more  relevant  and  interesting  to\nthem (details on ethnic minority strategies are in Appendix 4).\n\nb.\n\nGender\n\n82.\nViet Nam has high female participation in education, with the highest female enrollments\nat  the  primary  and  lower  secondary  levels  compared  with  other  low-income  countries.  Female\nenrollment at the lower secondary level is almost 50 percent. Female participation declines in the\n\n\f26\n\nhigher  grades,  except  at  the  TTC  level,  which  is  more  popular  among  females  than  males.\nFemale  enrollment  is  about  80  percent  of  total  TTC  enrollment.  However,  female  enrollment\namong ethnic minorities remains low. Although the Government has provided free boarding lower\nsecondary schools and free boarding facilities at TTCs, together with scholarships, to attract more\nethnic  minorities  particularly  females,  these  incentives  are  suppressed  by  some  cultural  values\nprevailing  in  their  communes.  Ethnic  minority  families  are  generally  reluctant  to  send  their\nteenage daughters to boarding schools. In some communes, marriages for girls can occur at an\nearly age of 13 years, after which studying is considered inappropriate. One of the ethnic minority\nstrategies  to  be  adopted  in  the  Project,  namely,  the  transition  program  to  improve  TTC  pre-\nentrance qualification for ethnic minorities, will respond to the gender issues by targeting to recruit\nat least 60 percent females among the target beneficiaries. In addition, the Project will also target\nat least 60 percent females as the beneficiaries of the  MA/M.Ed.  scholarship  programs for  TTC\nteachers.\n\nc.\n\nPoverty Reduction\n\nThe World Bank has estimated Viet Nam\u2019s poverty incidence to be about 51 percent, with\n83.\nthe  poverty  line  of  about  $100  per  head  per  year  (1992/93  prices).  However,  about  half  of  the\npoor (25 percent of the population) live in hard-core poverty, unable to afford the minimum daily\nfood  requirements  of  2,100  calories.  The  Government  has  identified  the  provision  of  adequate\nsocial  services  (especially  basic  education,  basic  health  care,  family  planning,  and  nutrition)  to\nthe  poor  as  one  of  the  key  strategies  for  reducing  poverty.  Investment  in  basic  education  has\nbecome  the  top  national  priority,  with  the  targets  of  achieving  universal  primary  education  by\n2000  and  universal  lower  secondary  education  in  urban  areas  by  2010.  Access  to  primary\neducation  has  been  expanded  substantially  to  reach  even  the  most  inaccessible  mountainous\nareas\u2014primary schools are now available in every commune throughout the country. At the same\ntime, the Government has been receiving substantial external assistance for improving the quality\nof primary education.\n\n84.\nAccess to lower secondary education by the poor has, however, been limited, particularly\namong ethnic  minorities  who  are  the  poorest  of  the  poor.  Only  19  percent  of  children  from  the\npoorest 20 percent of households enroll in lower secondary schools compared with 56 percent of\nchildren of the richest 20 percent of households. Lower secondary schools are available only in\n85  percent  of  the  communes  and  are  thus  inaccessible  to  many  ethnic  minority  groups.  The\naverage poverty incidence for all the ethnic minority groups, except for the Hoa (the Chinese), is\nover 70 percent, which is much higher than the national average of 51 percent. This Project will\ncontribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  the  long  run  by  enabling  ethnic  minorities  in  the  10\ndisadvantaged provinces to have greater access to TTCs through a special transition program to\nenhance their TTC pre-entrance qualifications. After completion of their studies, they will go back\nto teach in the lower secondary schools in their own communes. The availability of ethnic minority\nteachers  in  communes that have  no  lower  secondary  schools  yet  will  be  a  driving force  for  the\nGovernment to establish lower secondary schools there. The Project will also provide textbooks\nto the poorest 50 percent of TTC students including all ethnic minorities in the 10 disadvantaged\nprovinces and in the three model TTCs. This will help relieve the financial burden on their families\nand keep them as students without dropping out or repeating the class.\n\n\f27\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nSocioeconomic Analysis\n\n1.\n\nDemand Analysis\n\n85.\nThe demand for lower secondary education has increased dramatically, with an average\nenrollment  growth  rate  of  about  14  percent  per  year  during  1993-1997.  The  number  of  lower\nsecondary  schools  increased  by  more  than  40  percent  over  the  same  period.  Such  a  high\ndemand for lower secondary education reflects the Government\u2019s attempts to accommodate the\ngrowing  number  of  primary  school  graduates  associated  with  the  Government\u2019s  target  of\nachieving  universal  primary  education  by  2000.  To  achieve  a  sustainable  growth  path  and  to\nsurvive  in  the  globally  competitive  environment,  the  country  needs  to  prepare  a  solid  human\nresources base with adaptable skills.  This  can be  possible  only  through building  a  strong  lower\nsecondary education system since primary education  provides  only basic  cognitive  skills  as  the\nbasis  for  productivity  improvements  in  the  lower  secondary  level.  Given  such  a  high  social\ndemand for lower secondary education, the Government has set a target for achieving universal\nlower  secondary  education  in  urban  areas  by  2010,  with  priority  investments  allocated  to  this\nsubsector,  alongside  primary  education.  These  include  expansion  of  the  number  of  lower\nsecondary  schools  to  reach  remote  and  mountainous  areas,  provision  of  free  lower  secondary\neducation  and  scholarships  to  the  poor,  including  all  ethnic  minority  students,  and  provision  of\nmany boarding lower secondary schools catering only to ethnic minorities.\n\n86.\nOn  the  quality  aspects,  the  Government  has  been  receiving  substantial  external\nassistance, both from  bilateral  and  multilateral  funding  agencies,  with  the  Bank  taking  the  lead\nrole in helping improve the overall quality of lower secondary education as initiated in Loan 1537-\nVIE.  This  Project  will  also  assist  the  Government  in  improving  the  quality  of  lower  secondary\neducation  by  improving  the  TTC  curriculum  and,  hence,  the  quality  of  lower  secondary  school\nteachers.  The  Government  has  been  focusing  on  increasing  access  to  TTCs  by  providing  free\nTTC education and scholarships, together with free boarding facilities, to poor students including\nof all ethnic minorities.\n\n2.\n\nEconomic Analysis and Project Benefits\n\n87.\nThe major economic benefits of the Project lie in its contributions to improvements in the\ninternal  efficiency  of  lower  secondary  education,  as  reflected  in  the  reduced  dropout  and\nrepetition  rates  of  lower  secondary  students,  since  better  qualified  teachers  will  have  better\nknowledge  of  the  new  curriculum  and  will  do  more  effective  teaching.  The  new  teaching\nmethodologies based on student-centered approaches to be introduced by the Project will enable\nthe  newly  produced  teachers  to  interact  more  with  students,  thus  helping  improve  the\nperformance of  their  students.  Moreover, the double  major  system  to  be  instituted  at  TTCs  will\nenable  the  newly  produced  teachers  to  teach  more  than  one  subject,  thereby  increasing  the\nutilization  of  teachers.  The  benefits  from  the  greater  utilization  of  teachers  are  not  their  only\ncontributions to improved student performance or internal efficiency; they will also lead to higher\ncost-effectiveness in financing lower secondary education.\n\n88.\nOn the basis of the cited economic benefits, economic analysis of the Project is conducted\nat  the  discount  rate  of  12  percent  (Appendix  15).  The  student  dropout  and  repetition  rates  are\nexpected to reduce from 7.0 percent and 2.1 percent prior to the project period 1999/2000 to 5.5\npercent and 1.5 percent during the mid-project period 2002/03, respectively. Moreover, teachers\nare  expected  to  teach  10  percent  more  hours  as  a  result  of  the  double  major  system  to  be\n\n\f28\n\nintroduced at TTCs. The economic internal rate of return of the Project is estimated at 23 percent,\nimplying a worthwhile investment on the basis of the internal efficiency gains alone.\n\n3.\n\nProject Beneficiaries\n\n89.\nBy the end of the Project period (2006), the project beneficiaries will include the following:\n(i) around  26,000  TTC  students  (about  80  percent  females)  who  will  complete  their  third  year\nlower  secondary  teacher  training  courses  under  the  new  curriculum  by  the  end  of  the  project\nperiod (and their successors); and (ii) around 8 million lower secondary school students (about 50\npercent females) enrolled at the end of the project period (and their successors) who will benefit\nfrom better qualified teachers.\n\nThe  beneficiaries  during  the  project  period  (2000-2006)  include  the  following:  (i) around\n90.\n12,000  students  (about 80  percent females and  including all  ethnic  minority  students),  who  are\nthe poorest  50 percent  of  TTC  students  in  the 10  disadvantaged  provinces  and  the  three  cities\nselected  for  model  TTCs  development,  will  be  provided  with  textbooks  under  the  project\u2019s\ntextbook  lending  scheme;  (ii) around  4,000  (800  per  year  for  five  years)  prospective  ethnic\nminorities  (about  60  percent  females)  in  the  10  disadvantaged  provinces  will  be  recruited  to\nupgrade their  TTC pre-entrance  qualification  so  as  to  subsequently gain  access to  TTCs  under\nthe  project\u2019s  transition  program,  after  which  they  will  become  teachers  of  lower  secondary\nschools in their own communes; and (iii) around 1,500 administrative staff from MOET, DOETs,\nand TTCs (300, 700, and 500, respectively) and 5,000 TTC teachers (about 80 percent females)\nwill benefit from staff development (mainly from in-country short-term training) in various aspects\nof teacher training program improvements and institutional capacity building in management and\nin other relevant technical skills, to support and sustain the teacher training reforms.\n\n4.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\nSince the Government has identified ensuring adequate access of the poor to basic social\n91.\nservices  (including  basic  education)  as  one  of  the  key  strategies  for  reducing  poverty,  the\ncontributions  of  the  Project  to  increasing  access  of  ethnic  minority  groups  to  TTCs  will  have  a\npositive  impact  on  poverty  reduction.  Upon  completion  of  their  studies,  the  newly  graduated\nethnic minority teachers will go back to teach in lower secondary schools in their own or nearby\ncommunes. This development  will  increase  secondary school enrollment  among  ethnic  minority\nchildren, thus equipping more of them with the necessary skills required for direct entry into the\nlabor  market  or for  pursuing their  education further  to  ensure a future  means  of  livelihood.  The\nethnic minority teachers themselves will also improve their lots as  they  will  be employed by  the\nGovernment  as  lower  secondary  schoolteachers.  Moreover,  the  Project  will  provide  textbooks,\nunder the project\u2019s textbook lending scheme, to the poorest 50 percent of TTC students including\nall ethnic minorities as a safety net for them to complete their studies successfully as well as to\nrelieve the financial burden on their families.\n\n92.\nAbout  13  ethnic  minority  groups  in  the  10  disadvantaged  provinces  are  identified  in  the\nproject  ethnic  minority  strategies  (Appendix  4)  as  the  beneficiaries  of  the  project\u2019s  special\ntransition program designed to improve TTC pre-entrance qualification. These groups will include\nthe Hmong, Dao, Khmer, Muong, Nung, Thai, Tay, Cham, Katu,  Xodang,  Hre,  Cro,  and  Stieng.\nPoverty incidence ranges from 66 percent for the Tay to 100 percent for the Hmong,  compared\nwith  48  percent  for  the  majority  Kinh  and  51  percent  nationwide.  Since  these  ethnic  minority\ngroups  are  the  poorest  of  the  poor,  helping  them  gain  access  to  TTCs  and  subsequent\nemployment  as  teachers  to  teach  new  generations  of  lower  secondary  school  students  in  their\nown or nearby communes will generate a more positive impact on poverty reduction in the long\nrun than the focusing of attention only on the general poor. Since the number of the beneficiaries\n\n\f29\n\nin  this  case  will  be  around  4,000  students,  about  eight  times  the  number  of  ethnic  minority\nstudents currently enrolled at TTCs in the 10 selected provinces, the positive impact on poverty\nreduction is expected to be substantial.\n\n5.\n\nSustainability\n\n93.\nThe Project  will  generate  a  minor  continuing  incremental  recurrent  cost  after  the  project\nperiod.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  sustain  the  Project  into  the  future  after  its  completion\nusing financial contributions (equal to 3 percent of the total investment cost of civil works and 5\npercent  of  the  total  investment  cost  of  equipment  and  furniture)  to  be  provided  by  provincial\ngovernments (from the 10 targeted provinces and the three cities) for the O&M cost of the project\ninputs. Given  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  human  resources  development  and  the  shift  in\nfocus to lower secondary education, alongside primary education, the share of the Government\u2019s\ntotal recurrent expenditure devoted to overall education is expected to increase from 19 percent\nto about 22 percent during the project period (2000-2006) and to increase further afterwards. The\nincrease  in  the  overall  education  share  in  the  total  recurrent  expenditure  is  seen  as  a  likely\nscenario given the expected moderately high GDP growth rate of 6-8 percent per annum. At the\nsame  time,  the  share  of  the  Government\u2019s  total  recurrent  education  expenditure  allocated  to\nlower secondary education is expected to increase slightly, alongside that of primary education,\nfrom  20  percent  to  21  percent  during  the  project  period.  After  the  project  period,  the  share  of\nlower secondary education in the total recurrent education expenditure can be increased by a few\nmore  percent  with  the  achievement  of  the  goal  of  universal  primary  education  and  quality\nimprovement target.\n\nCompared  with  the  total  recurrent  expenditure  for  lower  secondary  education  the\n94.\nproportion of the incremental recurrent cost arising from the Project is small, less than 1 percent\nboth during and after the project period. This ensures that the Government can afford to sustain\nthe Project beyond the project period so that full benefits can be realized.\n\n6.\n\nRisks\n\n95.\n\nThe following risks are anticipated:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nDelay  in  the  approval  of  proposed  adjustments  in  the  TTC  program\u2013which  are\nrequired prior to revising the existing TTC curriculum\u2013due to the involvement of a\nlarge number of Government agencies at various levels. To minimize the risk, the\nGovernment will establish a CSC, chaired by MOET\u2019s key policy maker on teacher\ntraining, to facilitate the approval of the proposed adjustments.\n\nInsufficient coordination of project inputs and activities, particularly during the first\nphase of  the  Project,  due  to  the  involvement  of  a  large  number  of  stakeholders,\nincluding  MOET,  DOETs,  TTCs,  and  TTUs.  The  Project,  therefore,  provides\nsubstantial  staff  development  activities \nthe  stakeholders\u2019\nmanagement and monitoring skills.\n\nto  strengthen \n\nInsufficient  coordination  with  Loan  1537-VIE.  To  minimize  the  risk,  the  project\nmanager of the loan will be appointed as a member of the PSC for this Project.\n\nInsufficient project implementation experience of PIU and PPIU staff, especially at\nthe provincial level. To minimize the risk, the Project will provide training on project\nimplementation  to  familiarize  the  staff  with  Bank  requirements  and  procedures.\n\n\f30\n\nFurther,  the Project  will  provide  a  long-term  international  consultant  to  assist  the\nPIU in project implementation and management.\n\nB.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n96.\nThe Project is designed to have direct social benefits on the enrollments and retention of\nethnic minorities, particularly females, through a special transition program to enhance their TTC\npre-entrance qualifications and a textbook loan scheme to provide them with free textbooks. The\nProject  will  also  generate  direct  social  impact  on  the  retention  of  well-qualified  TTC  teachers,\nparticularly females, who will be trained under the project\u2019s MA/M.Ed. programs.  These positive\nsocial  benefits  will  contribute  to  the  improvements  in  human  resources,  especially  women\u2019s\nstatus,  in  the  long  run.  Moreover,  since  the  Project  is  designed  with  the  participation  of\nstakeholders  and  beneficiaries  (e.g.,  MOET,  DOETs,  TTUs,  TTCs,  students  and  teachers,\nparents,  and  representatives  of  ethnic  minorities),  beneficiary  involvement  will  have  a  positive\nsocial impact since their needs and social values have been taken into account.\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n97.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nMOET  will  ensure  that  the  foreign  universities  participating  in  the  joint-MA/M.Ed.\nprograms are selected competitively based on criteria agreed upon with the Bank.\nMOET  will  submit  for  Bank  approval  the  names  of  at  least  three  selected  local\nTTUs  and  the  foreign  universities  that  have  been  selected  to  offer  the  joint-\nMA/M.Ed. programs, within six months of the effective date.\n\nWithin 12 months of the effective date, MOET will submit the curriculum outlines of\nthe proposed joint-MA/M.Ed. programs to the Bank for approval.\n\nMOET will ensure that overseas universities to which the candidates for overseas\nMA/M.Ed. programs and for overseas  short-term  teaching  methodologies training\nwill be sent will be selected competitively based  on  criteria  agreed  upon  with  the\nBank.\n\nthe  number  of  credits  allocated \n\n(iv)  Within  12  months  of  the  effective  date,  with  the  assistance  of  the  CSC,  the\nGovernment will have adjusted and formally approved the following changes to the\nexisting  lower  secondary  preservice  teacher  training  program:  (a)  institution  of  a\ndouble  major  system  with an  approximately  60:40  major  and  minor  subject  ratio,\nwithout  reducing \nthe  major  subject;\n(b) regrouping of the TTC major-minor subject combinations to be consistent with\nthe  new  lower  secondary  subject  groups  proposed  under  Loan  1537-VIE;\n(c) increase in the number of credits for observation and practice teaching in lower\nsecondary  schools,  without  a  reduction  in  the  number  of  credits  allocated  to\nteaching  methodologies;  (d) reinstitution  of  an  external  assessment  system  for\nmeasuring  TTC  performance  and  standardizing  certification;  and  (e) increase  in\nthe yearly enrollment of TTC students to match the projected growth in the number\nof lower secondary school students as set forth in Appendix 2.\n\nto \n\n\f31\n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nMOET will monitor TTC enrollments and report the results to the Bank biannually\nduring project implementation.\n\nAt least two months before the commencement of each short-term overseas study\nvisit, the PIU will  submit  to  the  Bank for approval  the plan  of  the study  visit.  The\nplan will describe the purpose and objective of the study visit, proposed countries\nand  institutions  to  be  visited,  names  and  positions  of  participants  and  their\naffiliated institutions, proposed areas of study, and unit and total cost estimates.\n\n(vii)  Within  one  month  of  the  completion  of  each  short-term  overseas  study  visit,  the\n\nPIU will submit to the Bank a brief report outlining the results of the study visit.\n\n(viii)  At  least  six  months  before  the  commencement  of  the  short-term  overseas  study\nprogram in teaching methodologies, the PIU will submit the plan of the program to\nthe  Bank  for  approval.  The  plan  will  describe  the  purpose  and  objective  of  the\nprogram,  proposed  countries  and  institutions  of  study,  names  and  positions  of\nparticipants and their affiliated institutions, proposed areas of study, and unit  and\ntotal cost estimates.\n\n(ix)  Within two months of the completion of the short-term overseas study program in\nteaching methodologies, the PIU will submit to the Bank a brief report outlining the\nresults of the study program.\n\nMOET  will  ensure  that  all  candidates  for  overseas  and  in-country  MA/M.Ed.\nprograms will be selected competitively based on the criteria agreed upon with the\nBank  and  that  they  will  sign  agreements  that  upon  the  completion  of  their\nprograms of study, they will return to  and serve  in  their  respective  institutions for\nthree years for each year of scholarship studies.\n\nAt the start of each calendar year, the PIU will submit to the Bank for approval the\nplan  of  the  following  year's  overseas  MA/M.Ed.  study  programs  and  in-country\njoint-MA/M.Ed. study programs. The  plan  will describe  the  purpose and objective\nof the MA/M.Ed. programs, proposed countries and institutions of studies, names\nand  positions  of  participants  and  their  affiliated  institutions,  proposed  areas  of\nstudy, and unit and total cost estimates.\n\n(xii)  Within  two  months  of  the  completion  of  each  academic  year  of  study  under  the\noverseas  and  in-country  MA/M.Ed.  programs,  the  PIU  will  submit  to  the  Bank  a\nbrief report on the status and results of the programs.\n\n(xiii)  Within  12  months of the  effective date,  the PIU  will  have  (a)  completed  baseline\nsurveys  and  have  summary  results  for  about  61  provinces;  and  (b)  set  baseline\nand targeted values of general and project-specific indicators by province  and  by\ntotal  average,  as  agreed  upon  with  the  Bank.  The  PIU  will  verify  the  values\nannually by conducting follow-up surveys.\n\n(xiv)  The Government will ensure that at least 60 percent of the selected candidates for\n\nthe project MA/M.Ed. programs and transition program are females.\n\n(xv) \n\nThe Government will ensure that ethnic minority students who perform reasonably\nwell \nthe\ntransition  program  are  admitted \nGovernment's scholarship program for ethnic minority students.\n\nto  TTCs  under \n\nthe  project \n\nin \n\n\f32\n\n(xvi)  The Government will ensure that all ethnic minority candidates from the transition\nprogram who are admitted to TTCs under the Government\u2019s scholarship program\nfor  ethnic  minority  students  sign  agreements  that,  upon  the  completion  of  their\nprograms of study, they will return to their respective home  provinces  to  teach  in\nlower secondary schools for three years for each year of scholarship studies.\n\n(xvii)  The  Government  will  give  priority  to  ethnic  minorities  working  at  MOET,  DOETs\n\nand TTCs to participate in the project staff development program.\n\n(xviii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  recipient  provinces  provide  the  financial\ncontributions in an amount agreed upon between  the Government and  the  Bank,\nto finance the O&M costs of the Project (details in paras. 58 and 61).\n\n(xix)  The  Government  will  increase  the  percentage  share  of  its  lower  secondary\nrecurrent  budget  in  the  total  recurrent  education  budget  from  20  percent  to  21\npercent during project implementation (para. 36).\n\nB.\n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness\n\nThe Government agreed to the following condition, in addition to the standard conditions\n98.\nfor loan effectiveness, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: the Government will\nhave established the project steering committee.\n\nVII.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n99.\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the\nBank and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special\nDrawing Rights 18,106,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Teacher Training Project,\nwith a term of 32 years, including a grace  period  of 8  years,  and  with  an  interest  charge at  the\nrate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter, and\nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft\nLoan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\n16 November 1999\n\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n\n\f33\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber\n\nTitle\n\nPage\n\n   Cited on\n(page, para.)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nProject Framework\n\nMajor Characteristics and Performance Indicators\nof Primary and Lower Secondary Education\n\nExternal Assistance to the Education Sector\n\nProject Ethnic Minority Strategies\n\nStaff Development Plan\n\nConsulting Services Requirements\n\nIndicative Terms of Reference for Consultants\n\nImplementation Schedule of New Lower\nSecondary School Curriculum and Teacher\nTraining College Curriculum\n\nSample Design of Key Learning Facilities\n\nCriteria in Selecting 10 Disadvantaged Provinces\n\nProject Cost by Component and Financing Plan \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nTentative Procurement Packages\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n35\n\n40\n\n41\n\n43\n\n51\n\n53\n\n54\n\n63\n\n64\n\n65\n\n66\n\n69\n\n72\n\n73\n\n74\n\n1,2\n\n3,6\n\n9,28\n\n13,42\n\n13,45\n\n13,45\n\n13,45\n\n14,47\n\n16,53\n\n17,56\n\n21,66\n\n22,69\n\n22,70\n\n24,77\n\n27,88\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\n\nStructure of the Education System\n\nOrganizational Chart of Provincial Department of Education and Training\n\nOrganizational Chart of Ministry of Education  and Training\n\nLower Secondary School Subjects and Teacher Training College Subjects\n\nSelection Criteria of Candidates for Masters Degree Programs\n\n\f34\n\nF\n\nG\n\nH\n\nI\n\nCriteria in Selecting Foreign Universities for Overseas Masters Degree Programs\n\nCriteria for Establishing Joint-Masters Degree Programs with Foreign Universities\n\nPoverty Incidences of Main Ethnic Minority Groups\n\nSustainability Analysis\n\n\fPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nAppendix 1, page 1\n\nDesign Summary\n\nProject Targets\n(Verifiable Indicators)\n\nMonitoring\nMechanisms\n\nCritical Assumptions\n(Risks)\n\n1.1 LS NER increased from 49 to 70\n\n1.1 \u2013 1.4 inclusive:\n\n1.1  -

The main groups are Tay, Thai, Hoa, Khmer, Muong, and Nung; together they make\nup two thirds of the total ethnic minority population (Table A4.1).\n\nTable A4.1: Share of Main Ethnic Minority Population\n\nGroup\nTay\nThai\nHoa\nKhmer\nMuong\nNung\nOthers\nTotal Ethnic Minorities\nTotal Vietnamese Population\n\nMillion\n1.386\n1.155\n1.078\n1.001\n1.001\n0.847\n3.533\n\n10.0\n\n77.0\n\n% of Total\nVietnamese\nPopulation\n1.8\n1.5\n1.4\n1.3\n1.3\n1.1\n4.6\n13.0\n\n100.0\n\nIn the 10 disadvantaged provinces selected for the Project,1 a very high concentration of\n2.\nsome of the main ethnic minority groups (e.g., Tay, Thai, Muong, and Nung) is found in the four\nnorthern mountainous provinces of Ha Giang, Lao Cai, Lai Chau and Thanh Hoa (Table A4.2).\nThe  concentration  of  another  main  ethnic  minority  group  (Khmer)  is  also  high  in  the  three\nsouthern Mekong Delta provinces (Binh Phuoc, Tra Vinh, and Soc Trang). The remaining three\nprovinces  in  the  central  region  (Binh  Dinh,  Quang  Nam,  and  Quang  Ngai)  also  have  some\nethnic minority groups (e.g., Cham, Hre, and Katu), but not as many as those in the north and\nthe south. With the exception of the Hoa, who are ethnic Chinese concentrated in urban areas\nand coastal provinces, the rest of the ethnic minority groups have lower  socioeconomic  status\nand less access to social services than the majority Kinh. Many ethnic  minority  communes do\nnot  have  lower  secondary  schools;  and  although  every  province  has  its  own  teacher  training\ncollege  (TTC),  the  college  is  usually  located  in  the  center  of  the  province  far  from  their\ncommunes.  The  Government  responded  to  this  problem by providing  free  education  to  ethnic\nminorities (including scholarships, together with special boarding lower secondary schools, and\nfree boarding facilities at TTCs). Yet, TTC enrollments of ethnic minorities remain low (about 8\npercent in the 10 selected provinces). Of the 10 provinces, only Ha Giang and Lai Chau have\nethnic  minority  TTC enrollments higher than 30  percent;  those  of  the  rest  range  from  0  to  21\npercent  (Table  A4.2).  However,  the  more  than  30  percent  TTC  enrollment  shares  of  ethnic\nminorities in the two provinces should not be considered high compared with  the  much higher\nshares (more than 80 percent) of ethnic minority population in the total provincial population.\n\n                                               \n1 The 10 disadvantaged provinces were selected on  the  basis  of  poverty,  shortages  of facilities  at  teacher training\n\ninstitutions, and regional disadvantages described in detail in Appendix 10.\n\n\fAppendix 4, page 2\n\nProvince\n\nTable A4.2: Main EM Groups and Their TTC Enrollment Shares in 10 Selected Provinces\nEM TTC\nEnrollment (%\nof Prov.

The Project responds by\ndesigning  the  objectives  of  ethnic  minority  strategies  in  the  10  selected  provinces  as  follows:\n(i) to  provide  TTC  ethnic  minority  students  with  adequate  learning  materials  to  prevent  them\nfrom  repeating  the  class  or  dropping  out,  and  (ii)  to  upgrade  the  pre-entrance  qualification  of\nethnic minorities to enable them to gain access to TTCs. The project ethnic minority strategies\nare reflected in the following subcomponents: (i) subcomponent 1c: provide TTC ethnic minority\nstudents  (and  other  poor  students)  with  textbooks,  under  a  textbook  lending  scheme,  without\nhaving to pay; and (ii) subcomponent 2b: improve TTC pre-entrance qualification of prospective\nethnic minorities under a transition program.\n\nC.\n\nDescription of the Project Ethnic Minority Strategies\n\n1.\n\nSubcomponent 1c: Textbook Lending Scheme\n\n4.\nA  textbook  lending  scheme  for  the  poorest  50  percent  of  TTC  students  (including  all\nethnic minorities and other  poor  students)  in  the 10  disadvantaged  provinces  and  in the  three\ncities selected for development of model TTCs  will  be  designed by  an  international  consultant\nand  a  domestic  consultant  in  the  first  year  of  the  Project  and  piloted  in  these  13  TTCs  to\n(i) provide  a  safety  net  for  the  poor,  (ii) retain  larger  numbers  of  ethnic  minority  students  at\nTTCs, and (iii) attract more of them to enroll at TTCs. The same consultants will give training in\ntextbook  lending  scheme operations  to  selected  administrators  from  the  Ministry  of  Education\nand Training (MOET), the provincial departments of education  and training  (DOETs)  in the 10\nprovinces and the three cities, and the corresponding 13 TTCs. A manual for textbook lending\noperations will be developed and distributed as part of the training program. Textbooks for all of\nthe  TTC  subjects  will  be  distributed  to  these  13  TTCs at  least  in  the  third  year of the  Project,\nafter they have been revised in accordance with the new curriculum. By the end of the Project,\nthe textbook lending scheme will be in operation in the 13 TTCs after undergoing pilot tests for\nall three years of the TTC program. In addition, to be culturally sensitive to the needs of ethnic\nminority  students,  alternative  teaching  methodologies  and  teaching  aids  will  be  designed  for\nthem. If the total enrollments in the 13 TTCs will double during the project period (2000-2006) to\nabout  24,000  students  as  tentatively  planned,  it  is  expected  that  about  12,000  students  (50\npercent)  will  be  covered by  the  textbook  lending  scheme. Of  the  12,000  beneficiaries,  around\n3,000 (25 percent) are expected to be ethnic minority students.\n\nSubcomponent  2b:  Improved  TTC  Pre-entrance  Qualifications  of  Ethnic\nMinorities\n\nA special transition program to enhance TTC pre-entrance qualifications  of  prospective\n\n5.\nethnic minorities in the 10 disadvantaged provinces will consist of four elements:\n\n2.\n\n(i)\n\nBeneficiary  identification  recruitment  campaigns  will  be  conducted  in  the  10\ndisadvantaged  provinces  to  enroll  suitable  trainees.  The  campaign  will  include\nenhancing the awareness of ethnic  minority  communities  about  the advantages\nof sending their children (especially females) to school (including  TTCs) as  well\nas  establishing  coordination  mechanisms  between  the  provincial  DOETs  and\ndistrict  education offices  in  meeting  TTC  enrollment  targets.  Although  about  80\npercent  of  overall  TTC  students  are  females,  the  recruitment  for  this  transition\n\n\fAppendix 4, page 4\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\nprogram will give priority (at least 60 percent) to ethnic minority females, who are\nmore constrained by cultural attitudes than are their male counterparts.\n\nIntensive  preparatory  courses  aimed  at  consolidating  foundation  knowledge\nusually  absorbed  at  the  secondary  school  level  will  be  developed  by  an\ninternational  consultant  and  a  domestic  consultant.  These  courses  will  be\ndelivered  over  six  months  before  the  commencement  of  the  TTC  school  year.\nTutorial rooms to be built by this Project as part of the key learning facilities will\nbe used as the training venues.\n\nSpecial remedial courses will be provided to ethnic minority students identified as\nhaving pronounced academic  weakness,  with  smaller  than  normal  class  size  to\npermit special attention.\n\nA  two-week  orientation  program  will  be  delivered  to  newly  enrolled  ethnic\nminority  students,  which  will  also provide  the  TTCs  with  an  opportunity  to  learn\nabout their new ethnic minority students and their particular needs (e.g., special\nlanguage tuition and particular needs for females). During this program, a student\nmentor support system will be established by partnering the new ethnic minority\nstudents with high performing urban students willing to assist their peers in study.\n\n6.\nSince  most  of  the  existing  TTC  ethnic  minority  students  come  from  some  of  the  main\nethnic  minority  groups,  the  number  of  ethnic  minority  groups  targeted  for  the  project  ethnic\nminority  strategies  under  subcomponent  2b  will  be  limited  to  these  groups  (Table  A4.3).  The\nbenefits  of  the targeting are as follows:  (i)  avoiding  fragmentation  and  geographical  obstacles\nfor the Project in targeting and recruiting prospective ethnic minorities for the transition program;\n(ii)  creating  a  more  supportive  and  sustainable  schooling  for  ethnic  communities  for  their\ncontinuing participation  at  TTCs  (after  which the  Government  can  cast  a  wider  net  to  capture\nother ethnic minority groups); and (iii) avoiding overly ambitious coverage at this pilot stage so\nthat the strategies can be successfully applied and refined later. This targeting, however, does\nnot mean that access will be denied to students from other ethnic minority groups.\n\nFrom Table A4.3, the total TTC enrollment of ethnic minorities (for years 1-3) in the 10\n7.\nprovinces at one point in time during the project period will be about 2,340 students. This figure\nis  arrived  at  by  assuming  that  the  share  of  ethnic  minority  enrollments  at  TTCs  in  the  10\nprovinces  will  double  during  the  project  period  (from  the  current  level  of  8  percent  to  16\npercent). The distribution of the targeted number of beneficiaries across the 10 provinces then\nfollows  a  targeted  percentage  of  ethnic  minority  enrollments  in  each  province.  Provinces  with\nhigh current percentages of ethnic minorities in the total provincial population (Table A4.2) will\nbe targeted for larger percentages of beneficiaries. Of the total 2,340 expected ethnic minority\nstudents  in  the 10 provinces for the  three-year program,  at  least  780  (or  about  800)  students\nshould be recruited as the beneficiaries for the transition program each year and subsequently\nenrolled  as  TTC  students  under  the  Government\u2019s  scholarship  program  for  ethnic  minorities,\nprovided  that  they  perform  reasonably  well  in  the  transition  program.  If  the  design  of  the\ntransition program is ready for implementation by the second  year of  the  Project,  the program\ncan  be  implemented  for  five  years  and  will  cover  a  total  of  at  least    3,900  (or  about  4,000)\nbeneficiaries.\n\n\fTable A4.3: Target EM Groups and Beneficiaries\n\nProvince\n\nTarget EM\nGroup\n\nTotal EM\nPop. in\nTarget\nGroup\n\nCurrent\nTotal TTC\nEnrollmenta\nin Province\n(no.)\n\nCurrent\nTTC Enrollments\nof EM Students\nin Province\n%\n\nno.\n\nExpected\nTotal TTC\nEnrollment in\nProvince\n(no. for 3 yr)\n\nAppendix 4, page 5\n\nExpected (Targeted)\nTTC Enrollment of\nEM Students in\nProvince\n(no.\nper\nyr)\n\n(no.\nfor 3\nyr)\n\n%\n\n178,250\n149,500\n80,500\n57,500\n465,750\n\n145,360\n126,000\n75,480\n63,000\n410,240\n\n187,416\n130,150\n31,236\n348,802\n\n254,100\n181,500\n435,600\n\n15,000\n\n21,000\n21,000\n42,000\n\n106,845\n25,000\n131,845\n\n66,000\n24,000\n90,000\n\n1.

Based\non the socioeconomic profiles in Table A4.4, the main location where they live exerts significant\ninfluences  on  their  socioeconomic  status,  main  economic  activity,  and  cultural  characteristics.\nThose living in upland, high-altitude areas (e.g., Hmong and Dao) are very poor, especially the\nHmong  who  also  practice  shifting  agriculture  with  mobile  villages.  The  mountainous  nature  of\nmost of these provinces, which are inaccessible by road,  together  with  the  shifting  agricultural\npractices, makes physical access to education and other social services very difficult. With the\nlimited availability of lower secondary schools (e.g., only 30 percent of the districts in Ha Giang\nProvince  have  lower  secondary  schools),  access  to  education  beyond  the  primary  level  is\nextremely limited.\n\nTable A4.4: Socioeconomic Profile of Target EM Groups in the North\n\nEM Groups\n\nMain Location\n\nHmong\n\nUpland (high\naltitude)\n\nSocioeconomic\nStatus\n\nVery low\n\nMain Economic\nActivity\nAgriculture (some\nshifting\nagriculture)\n\nCultural\nCharacteristics\nMobile villages, early\nmarriages of females,\nRomanized language\n\nTay\n\nDao\n\nThai\n\nUpland/Lowland\nvalleys\n\nUpland (High\naltitude)\n\nUpland/Lowland\nvalleys\n\nLow\n\nAgriculture\n\nVery low\n\nAgriculture\n\nLow\n\nAgriculture\n\nMuong\n\nLowland/Mountain\nvalleys\n\nLow\n\nAgriculture\n\nEM = ethnic minority.\n\nb.\n\nCentral Provinces\n\nSophisticated art,\nRomanized language\n\nEstablished literature,\nChinese script\n\nLarge villages,\nSanskrit-derived\nlanguage, rich arts\nand traditions\n\nPractice Buddhism,\nlarge villages, rich\nliterature, culturally\nclose to Thai\n\n9.\nThe target ethnic minority groups in the three central provinces (Binh Dinh, Quang Nam,\nand  Quang  Ngai)  are  the  Cham,  Katu,  Xodang,  Hre,  and  Cro.  Their  socioeconomic  profile\n(Table A4.5) shows that all these groups are concentrated in the western highland areas of the\nprovinces,  which  are  difficult  to access.  The  majority of them  practice  shifting  agriculture,  and\nhave a very low socioeconomic status. The characteristics of their main location and economic\nactivity make access to education and other social services very difficult.\n\n\fAppendix 4, page 7\n\nSettled villages,\nadopt Hinduism,\nrich in literature and\nartistic traditions\n\nSmall villages,\nrudimentary\nhandicrafts\n\nStilt houses in\nmobile villages,\nrudimentary\nhandicrafts\n\nStilt houses in large\nvillages, rice\ncultivation\n\nTable A4.5: Socioeconomic Profile of Target EM Groups in the Central Region\n\nEM Group\n\nMain Location\n\nSocioeconomic\nStatus\n\nMain Economic\nActivity\n\nCultural\nCharacteristics\n\nCham\n\nWestern upland\n\nVery low\n\nAgriculture\n\nKatu\n\nWestern upland\n\nVery low\n\nAgriculture\n\nXodang\n\nWestern upland\n\nVery low\n\nWestern upland\n\nVery low\n\nHre\n\nCro\n\nEM = ethnic minority.\n\nShifting\nagriculture\n\nShifting\nagriculture\n\nWestern upland\n\nVery low\n\nShifting\nagriculture\n\nLarge villages, rice\ncultivation\n\nc.\n\nSouthern Flood-Prone Mekong Delta Provinces\n\nThe  target  ethnic  minority  groups  in  the  three  southern  flood-prone  provinces  in  the\n10.\nMekong-Delta areas  (Binh  Phuoc,  Tra  Vinh,  and  Soc  Trang) are the  Stieng and  Khmer.  Their\nsocioeconomic profile (Table A4.6) shows both groups live in the delta\u2019s  rural areas. Although\nthe land in the delta areas is normally fertile, which permits multiple cropping by the Stieng, it is\nprone to flooding during the monsoon season. In addition, most of the Khmer do not own land\nand  have  to  work  on  farms  as  landless  hired  labor.  The  resulting  economic  status  of  both\ngroups  is  thus  low.  Since  both  normally  live  in  remote  rural  areas  in  isolation  from  the  Kinh\nmajority, they have low access to education and other social services.\n\nTable A4.6: Socioeconomic Profile of Target EM Groups in the South\n\nEM Group\n\nMain Location\n\nStieng\n\nDelta (rural\nareas)\n\nSocioeconomic\nStatus\nLow\n\nMain Economic\nActivity\nAgriculture/fishing\n\nCultural\nCharacteristics\n\nLong houses in\nsmall villages, wet\nrice cultivation with\nmultiple cropping\n\nKhmer\n\nDelta (rural\nareas)\n\nLow\n\nEM = ethnic minority.\n\nAgriculture/fishing Work as landless\nhired labor, rich in\nliterature and\nartistic traditions\n\n\fAppendix 4, page 8\n\n2.\n\nNeeds of Target Groups\n\n11.\nThe  socioeconomic profile  of  the  target  groups  assessed  in  the  preceding  subsections\nhave a significant bearing on the need for better education for their offspring in relation to other\nneeds. Since these target groups belong to the low and very low socioeconomic strata, they are\ninevitably preoccupied  with  immediate needs  (e.g.,  improvement  in  income).  Coupled  with  the\nnature of their agricultural occupation (which depends largely on the labor of their children) as\nwell  as  the  important  role  that  their  children  (particularly  girls)  play  in  household  chores,  they\nsee  little  need  to  send  children  to  school  beyond  the  primary  level  as  that  would  mean  high\nopportunity  costs  to  them.  This  kind  of  need  is  difficult  to  change  by  education  policies  alone\nsince  it  is  structurally  tied  to  their  occupation.  Although  the  Government  has  been  trying  to\nchange the situation by providing scholarships and boarding facilities to ethnic minority students\nattending lower secondary schools and TTCs, the scholarships cover only the costs  related  to\nschooling, rather than their opportunity cost. However, this kind of need represents the needs of\nthe target groups only in general. It does not follow that every family in the target groups prefer\nto have their children work on farms or on household chores rather than go to school.\n\n3.\n\nDemand of Target Groups\n\n12.\nSome target groups who live in more accessible lowland mountain valleys (e.g., the Thai\nand  the  Muong  in  Thanh  Hoa  Province)  are  better-off  economically  compared  with  the  other\ngroups. Their more accessible location makes it easier for them to gain access to schools and\nother  social  services as  well as  to absorb urban values and  attitudes.  Thus,  their  demand  for\nbetter  education  can  be  formed  more  easily.  However,  the  project  ethnic  minority  strategies\nunder  subcomponent  2b  will  create  the  demand  for  TTC  education  in  all  the  target  groups\nthrough recruitment campaigns to make them realize the benefits of better education.\n\n4.\n\nAbsorptive Capacity of Target Groups\n\n13.\nConstrained by limited educational background and language barriers, the target groups\nnormally have limited capacity to absorb better education. The project ethnic minority strategies\nunder  subcomponent  2b  will  overcome  these  constraints  by  (i) providing  intensive  preparatory\ncourses  and  special  remedial  courses  to  upgrade  their  educational  background;  (ii) providing\nthese courses in major native languages, especially for the Khmer who normally have difficulties\nin absorbing the central language; and (iii) providing student mentors to support the new ethnic\nminority students enrolled at TTCs on an individual basis to enhance their learning capacity.\n\n5.\n\nGender Issues Among the Target Groups\n\n14.\nAlthough  TTC  enrollments  are  largely  dominated  by  females  (more  than  80  percent),\nethnic  minority  families  normally  prefer  better  education  for  sons  than  for  daughters.  For\nexample,  Lai  Chau  Province  has  twice  as  many  literate  men  as  women.  Economically,\ndaughters are highly valued not only on farms, but also in households. Culturally, ethnic minority\nfamilies  are  reluctant to  allow their  daughters  to  attend  boarding  schools  during  their  teenage\nyears. In some of the target groups (e.g., Hmong), marriages can occur for girls aged 13 years,\nafter  which  it  is  inappropriate  for  them  to  go  to  school.  The  project  ethnic  minority  strategies\nunder subcomponent 2b will address these issues  in all  the  target groups  through  recruitment\ncampaign, that will include public awareness campaigns to make families realize the benefits of\nsending  their  children,  especially  daughters,  to  school.  In  addition,  the  recruitment  target  for\nfemales under this subcomponent will be at least 60 percent.\n\n\fSTAFF DEVELOPMENT PLAN\n\nComponent/Subcomponent\nDescription\n\nCategory\n\nType\n\nDuration\n\nParticipants\n(Beneficiaries)\n\nTotal\nPerson- Number\nmonths\n\nMOET\n(inc.

These key selection\nindicators were used: (i) for poverty, provincial gross domestic product (GDP) per capita compared\nwith  the  national  average;  (ii)  for  facilities  shortages,  their  having  teacher  training  schools  (TTSs)\nrather than teacher training colleges (TTCs), overcrowded classrooms of more than 40 students per\nclass, or double shifting; and (iii) for regional disadvantages, large proportions of ethnic minorities in\nthe north, flood-prone nature of the central and southern regions, and newly separated provinces in\nneed  of  basic  facilities  in  the  central  and  southern  regions.  The  data  on  the  provincial  GDP  per\ncapita  came from  a World Bank  report.1  Based on  such  report,  only  five  provinces  have  GDP  per\ncapita below $100, all of which were in the north. Since that report had no data on GDP per capita\nfor Lao Cai Province, the data presented here were based on consultants\u2019 estimates from surveys of\nthe facilities during project preparation. All the 10 selected provinces can be classified as poor since\ntheir GDP per capita is much less than the national average of $217.2\n\n             Table A10: Major Characteristics of 10 Selected Disadvantaged Provinces\n\n Province\n\nRegion Population Per Capita\n\n1.

This will increase the quality of lower secondary school graduates and\nworkforce,  thereby  enhancing  Viet  Nam\u2019s  competitiveness  in  the  world  market  over  the  next\ngeneration.  On  the  efficiency  grounds,  the  Project  will  improve  the  internal  efficiency  of  lower\nsecondary education by reducing the dropout and repetition rates since better qualified teachers\nwill  have  better  knowledge  and  will  be  able  to  teach  more  effectively.  The  new  teaching\nmethodologies to be introduced in the Project, which will feature student-centered approaches,\nwill  enable  the  new  teachers  to  interact  more  with  students,  thus  helping  improve  the\nperformance of their students as well as reduce the students\u2019 tendency to drop out. Moreover,\nthe double major system to be instituted at teacher training colleges (TTCs) will enable the new\nteachers to teach more than one subject, thereby increasing the utilization of teachers.\n\n2.\nEven from the internal efficiency gains alone, the Project will be a worthwhile investment\nas  shown  in  the  economic  analysis  in  Tables  A15.1  and  A15.2.  At  the  discount  rate  of  12\npercent, the base case shows an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 23  percent based\non the following contributions by better qualified teachers: (i) reduction in students\u2019 dropout and\nrepetition  rates  from  7.0  percent  and  2.1  percent,  respectively,  prior  to  the  Project  period\n(1999/2000)  to  5.5  percent  and  1.5  percent,  respectively,  during  the  mid-Project  period\n(2002/03);  and  (ii)  an  increase  in  teachers\u2019  ability  to  teach  10  percent  more  hours  during  the\nmid-project period than before the project period, as a result of the double major system to be\nintroduced at TTCs.\n\nTable A15.1: Basic Assumptions for Base Case\n\nExchange rate (July 1999)\nStandard conversion factor\nCost per annum per lower secondary student ($46)\nTeacher attrition rates\n\u2022  Retirements\n\u2022  Leaving teaching for other reasons\n\nAnnual salary + 10% perquisites of lower secondary teacher ($302 + 10%)\nDropout rate per year without Project (1999/2000)\nDropout rate per year with Project (2002/03)\nRepetition rate per year without Project (1999/2000)\nRepetition rate per year with Project (2002/03)\nAdditional teaching load of a double-major teacher\n\n$1 = D13,890\n0.9\nD638,940\n\n3%\n5%\nD4,614,258\n7.0%\n5.5%\n2.1%\n1.5%\n10%\n\n3.\nThese efficiency gains are robust. Sensitivity analysis shows that even a reduction in the\nefficiency gain  makes  the  Project  a  still  worthwhile  investment.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  the\nfollowing:  (i)  a  lower  reduction  in  the  dropout  rate  from  7.0  percent  to  6.3  percent  leaves  the\nEIRR still at 21 percent; (ii) with no reduction in the repetition rate, the EIRR is still 21 percent;\n(iii) with a lower increase of 5 percent in the teaching hours, the EIRR is still 17 percent; (iv) with\na delay of one year in producing the first batch of TTC graduates, the EIRR is still 19 percent.\nOnly when all the shortfalls from the base case occur simultaneously will the EIRR be reduced\nto 10 percent.\n\n\fAppendix 15, page 2\n\nTable A15.2: Economic Rate of Return and Net Present Value\n\nBase Case\n\nTotal\nEconomic\nCost\n(D million)\n          24,925\n        137,612\n        126,396\n          80,398\n          32,040\n          18,204\n            7,713\n            7,713\n            7,713\n            7,713\n            7,713\n            7,713\n            7,713\n            7,713\n            7,713\n            7,713\n            7,713\n            7,713\n            7,713\n            7,713\n            7,713\n            7,713\n            7,713\n\nYear\n2000/01\n2001/02\n2002/03\n2003/04\n2004/05\n2005/06\n2006/07\n2007/08\n2008/09\n2009/10\n2010/11\n2011/12\n2012/13\n2013/14\n2014/15\n2015/16\n2016/17\n2017/18\n2018/19\n2019/20\n2020/21\n2021/22\n2022/23\n\n  Total Economic Benefit (D million)\n\nTeacher\n\nDropout\nReduction\n\n                 -\n                 -\n                 -\n                 -\n\nRepetition\nReduction Replacement\n                 -\n             -\n                 -\n             -\n                 -\n             -\n                 -\n             -\n            8,881         3,552           20,169\n          18,533         7,413           42,297\n          25,468       10,187           58,196\n          32,518       13,007           74,360\n          39,686       15,874           90,793\n          46,973       18,789          107,498\n          54,381       21,752          124,482\n          61,912       24,765          141,747\n          69,568       27,827          159,300\n          77,351       30,940          177,145\n          68,470       27,388          177,145\n          58,818       23,527          177,145\n          51,883       20,753          177,145\n          44,833       17,933          177,145\n          37,665       15,066          177,145\n          30,378       12,151          177,145\n          22,971         9,188          177,145\n          15,440         6,176          177,145\n            7,783         3,113          177,145\n\n            Economic Internal Rate of Return =\n Net  Present  Value  at  12%\n=\n\nNet\nIncremental\nBenefit\n(D million)\n\n-24,925\n-137,612\n-126,396\n-80,398\n              563\n          50,039\n          86,138\n        112,173\n        138,640\n        165,547\n        192,902\n        220,711\n        248,982\n        277,723\n        265,290\n        251,777\n        242,068\n        232,197\n        222,163\n        211,961\n        201,590\n        191,047\n        180,328\n\n23%\n 416,723\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 14 November 1999)\n", "Currency Unit\nD1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013\n=\n=\n", "Dong (D)\n$0.000071\nD14,008\n", "For the purpose of calculations in this report, a rate of $1.00 = D13,890 has been used.
