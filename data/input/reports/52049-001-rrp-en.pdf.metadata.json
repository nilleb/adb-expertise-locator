The \nprogram  will  (i)  introduce  important  tariff  and  tax-related  policy  reforms  to  support  Pakistan\u2019s \nexport industries and increase their competitiveness internationally; and (ii) strengthen key trade-\nfacilitating institutions such as accreditation bodies, the EXIM Bank of Pakistan (EXIMBP), and \nthe National Single Window (NSW). \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nPakistan\u2019s exports averaged growth of more than 10% per year from FY2004 to FY2011, \npeaking at $25.4 billion in FY2011, and remained relatively flat from FY2011 to FY2015. Exports \nin almost all major export groups and destinations declined shortly thereafter, dropping to $22.0 \nbillion in FY2017. Pakistan\u2019s share of global exports also declined by 20%, from 0.3% in 2005 to \n0.1% in 2017. While exports recovered to $24.8 billion in FY2018, their rise-and-fall pattern during \nFY2004\u2013FY2017 reflects the underperformance of the country\u2019s export industries and the long-\nterm decline of trade competitiveness. In fact, Pakistan\u2019s export performance lags that of South \nAsian  and  Southeast  Asian  comparator  countries,  including  those  that  entered  key  export \nindustries  such  as  textiles  later  than  Pakistan.  From  1990  to  2016,  Pakistan  averaged  export \ngrowth of 5.6% per year, compared with 8.3% in Sri Lanka, 11.8% in Bangladesh, 26.7% in Viet \nNam,  and  27.1%  in  Cambodia.  Pakistan\u2019s  ratio  of  exports  to  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)\u2014\n8.2% in 2017\u2014is the lowest among its competitor countries and is lower than the 17.7% regional \naverage. Foreign direct investment in Pakistan, including its export industries, remained relatively \nlow at 0.92% of GDP in 2017, even as the government increased infrastructure spending.1 \n \nThe weakness of Pakistan\u2019s export trade is also reflective of its inability to diversify export \n4. \nproducts over the past few decades. Exports have been concentrated in less sophisticated and \nlower  value-added  products,  particularly  agricultural,  textile,  and  leather  products.  Textiles \naccounted  for  56%  of  Pakistan\u2019s  exports  from  FY2016  to  FY2018,  but  while  textile  exports \naveraged  annual  growth  of  7.1%  during  FY2004\u2013FY2011,  the  average  dropped  to  just  0.2% \nduring FY2011\u2013FY2018 (Figure). Pakistan is also losing export competitiveness because of the \nhigh concentration of less sophisticated goods; high-tech products comprise less than 2% of total \nexports. More complex categories such as chemicals, plastics, machinery, and appliances have \nsmall export shares (0.7%\u20132.2%) and had low or negative export growth from FY2011 to FY2018. \nOne of the reasons for this is low and declining investment in Pakistan. Private investment as a \npercentage of GDP stood at about 10.0% from FY2014 to FY2018 and dipped to 9.8% in FY2019.2 \n \n5. \nTrade  performance  impact  on  the  current  account.  The  current  account  deficit  has \nwidened significantly as a result of its growing trade deficit, which puts pressure on the balance \nof payments. The current account deficit expanded to a new high of $20 billion (6.3% of GDP) in \n\n                                                \n1  World Bank. World Development Indicators (accessed 20 May 2019). \n2  Sector Assessment (Summary): Industry and Trade (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fFY2018  (Table  1).  The  trade  deficit  increased  rapidly  because  of  stagnant  export  growth  and \nincreasing imports. Capital and consumer goods contributed to the rise in imports from FY2014 \nto  FY2018.  Private  consumption  accounted  for  81%  of  GDP  in  FY2018,  largely  supported  by \nimports. However, by value, the share of consumer goods (including consumer raw materials) in \ntotal imports declined from 69% in FY2014 to 57% in FY2018, while the share of capital goods \nand  oil  imports  increased  10  percentage  points  to  40%.  This  can  be  partly  attributed  to  more \npublic spending on infrastructure projects, and to the rise in oil prices. Finally, the rising budget \ndeficit also fed into the worsening current account deficit. \n \n\nFigure: Compound Annual Export Growth Rate \n(%) \n\nFY2004 to FY2011\n\nFY2011 to FY2018\n\nVegetable\nproducts\n\nPrepared\nfoodstuffs\n\nMineral\nproducts\n\nChemical or\nallied\nindustries\n\nPlastics,\nrubber\narticles\n\nTextiles and\ntextile\narticles\n\nMachinery,\nmechanical\nappliances\n\nRaw hide\nskins,\nleather, fur\nskins,\narticles\n\n \n\nFY = fiscal year. \nSource: State Bank of Pakistan. \n \n6. \nPakistan's  gross  international  reserves  fell  from  $19.4  billion  at  the  end  of  FY2016  to \n$11.3 billion at the end of FY2018 (Table 1), and to $9.1 billion at the end of 2018. Net reserves \ndeclined from $18.1 billion to $9.8 billion (1.9 months of import cover) during the same period. \nReserves declined because of the increasing current account deficit, interventions to maintain the \novervalued exchange rate, and increasing debt service on borrowed reserves. The rebuilding of \nreserves is crucial if the country wants to strengthen the buffers against external shocks and avoid \na  balance-of-payment  crisis.  The  Pakistan  rupee\u2013United  States  (US)  dollar  exchange  rate \ndropped 25% in 2018 to slow the decline of reserves, but this has had a limited effect on reserves.3 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n3  Appreciation in Pakistan\u2019s Real Effective Exchange Rate since 2014 impacted export competitiveness compared to \nother countries. Real Effective Exchange Rate peaked at 127.4 in April 2017 before it started to slide down to 111.1 \nin April 2018 and 104.3 in April 2019 as the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) allowed depreciation in nominal exchange \nrate against major currencies. \n\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nFY11 \n\nTable 1: External Sector Indicators \nFY15 \n(2,796) \n\nFY14 \n(3,130) \n\nFY12 \n(4,658) \n\nFY13 \n(2,496) \n\n214 \n\nFY16 \n(4,867) \n\nFY17 \n(12,621) \n\nFY18 \n(19,897) \n\nBalance on trade in goods \n\n(10,427) \n\n(15,652) \n\n(15,355) \n\n(16,590) \n\n(17,267) \n\n(19,283) \n\n(26,784) \n\n(31,911) \n\n25,369 \n35,796 \n(2,029) \n\n24,718 \n40,370 \n(3,305) \n\n24,802 \n40,157 \n(1,564) \n\n25,078 \n41,668 \n(2,650) \n\n24,090 \n41,357 \n(2,970) \n\n21,972 \n41,255 \n(3,406) \n\n21,966 \n48,750 \n(4,339) \n\n24,758 \n56,669 \n(6,068) \n\n16,614 \n\n11,905 \n\n7,198 \n\n10,509 \n\n14,836 \n\n19,446 \n\n17,550 \n\n11,341 \n\n14,784 \n\n10,803 \n\n6,009 \n\n9,098 \n\n13,534 \n\n18,143 \n\n16,142 \n\n9,789 \n\nItem \nCurrent account balance \n\n($ million) \n\n($ million) \nExports ($ million) \nImports ($ million) \nBalance on trade in \nservices ($ million) \nSBP gross reserves \n\n($ million) \n\nSBP net reserves \n\n($ million) \n\n(PRs = $1.00) \n\nAverage exchange rate \n\n85.50 \n\n89.24 \n\n97.24 \n\n102.86 \n\n101.29 \n\n104.24 \n\n104.69 \n\n109.84 \n\nConstraints  on  export  performance.

Following a policy of fiscal consolidation to reduce the fiscal \ndeficit,  the  government  raised  tax  revenues  to  finance  large  development  needs.  Additional \nrevenues were raised largely from existing taxpayers, without broadening the tax base, putting an \nexcessive burden on corporate and trade players. Additional customs duties were imposed on \nmachinery (from 0% to 3%\u20135% since 2013) and intermediate goods to raise revenues, reduce \nimport demand, and narrow the balance-of-payment deficit. Average tariffs remain high and the \ntariff structure has become more complex, including 13 duty slabs with more than 7,000 tariff lines \nand  reversing  the  progress  of  previous  simplification  efforts.4  Regulatory  duties  (an  additional \ntrade tax) were imposed on 480 tariff lines, including 30% duty on iron and steel imports in 2016. \nCustoms duty exemptions (e.g., on machinery) could be availed of but are rarely sought in practice \nbecause of cumbersome documentary requirements. In the case of machinery and capital goods, \nexemption is subject to substantiation by the importers that  the products are not made locally. \nThis tax regime increased the costs for exporters that depend on imported intermediate goods, \ncreating a negative impact on the competitiveness of domestic industries involved in global value \nchains. Domestic taxes are also set at high rates to raise revenues from a narrow tax base to \nmitigate fiscal expansion. Corporate tax rates remain relatively high at 31% in FY2016\u2013FY2017 \n(reduced from 34%) and the goods and services tax rate is 17%, which aggravates the tax burden \nand drives up the cost of doing business and the price of export goods. Diesel, a key input for \nindustry, transport, and agriculture in Pakistan, is subject to 34.5% sales tax and duty. \n \nHigh raw material costs hurting exports. High tariffs and restrictions on the import of \n8. \nsynthetic  products  and  fibers  are keeping  Pakistani  manufacturers  from  producing  high  value-\nadded synthetic textile products, including finished garments, that better match global trends and \ndemand.5 This constrains the potential growth in export value and leads to the underperformance \n                                                \n4  Trade barriers are often justified as a means of reducing import competition and protecting jobs. But higher tariffs on \nessential inputs weaken the productivity and competitiveness of domestic firms and could in fact lead to a substantial \nnumber of job losses. Moreover, protectionist policies also have a detrimental impact on a country\u2019s position in global \nproduction networks for the same reasons. \n\n5  A. Mahmood and W. Ahmed. 2017. Export Performance of Pakistan: Role of Structural Factors. SBP Staff Notes. \n02/17. Karachi: State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Estimates in the staff note suggest that 20%\u201330% of imported inputs \nhave been used at different stages of production in Pakistan. Despite the significant importance of imported inputs \nin production, Pakistan applies relatively high tariff rates compared with its peers and competitors. \n\n \n\n\fof Pakistan\u2019s textile exports. Instead, Pakistan is competing with and in competition with low-tech \nproducts  from  lower-income  countries  with  more  competitive  wages.  Efforts  to  increase  the \ncomplexity and diversity of Pakistan\u2019s exports face multiple hurdles, such as the composition of \nthe export goods basket, little opportunity to transition to higher-value products given the country\u2019s \ncurrent  capabilities,  low  investment  in  research  and  development,  and  limited  productivity  and \nlabor skills.6 These binding constraints to higher-value production and stronger competitiveness \nare further corroborated in a 2013 World Bank study.7 \n \nOvervalued  exchange  rate.  To  protect  the  budget  from  the  impact  of  exchange  rate \n9. \nfluctuations on imported goods and foreign debt service costs, the real effective exchange rate of \nthe Pakistan rupee was allowed to appreciate by more than 20% from 2013 to 2017, which further \neroded export competitiveness. By maintaining a mostly fixed nominal exchange rate against the \nUS  dollar,  the  Pakistan  rupee  was  overvalued  by  10%\u201318%  in  July  2017,  increasing  import \ndemand  and  reducing  export  price  competitiveness.8  The  Pakistan rupee  has  been  allowed  to \ndevalue since 2018, which partially helped improve the price competitiveness of exporters. \n \n10.  Weak  institutional  capacity.  Exports  have  suffered  from  the  persistently  high  cost  of \ndoing business in Pakistan; outages of grid-based electricity supply; high cost of electricity; and \nalarmingly high tax incidence on petroleum products, including diesel fuel.9 Despite unbundling \nthe Water and Power Development Authority in 1999 into separate electricity and water divisions, \nthe desired reforms\u2014to curb inefficiencies in the power generation, distribution, and transmission \nsystem; improve collection; and reduce line losses of more than 20%\u2014were not implemented. As \na  result,  export-oriented  entrepreneurs  bear  the  cost  of  these  inefficiencies  by  paying  inflated \nelectricity  bills,  putting  them  at  a  competitive  disadvantage  to  other  exporters  in  this  region. \nFurthermore, the government withheld the refund of taxes and duties to exporters, which hurt their \nliquidity.10  Complex  and  cumbersome  customs  procedures  for  exporters  and  importers  also \ncontribute to the high cost of doing business. In the trading across borders category of the World \nBank\u2019s 2018 Doing Business Survey, Pakistan ranked 171st out of 189 countries because of the \nhigh financial and time costs  of clearing exports and imports at the border and complying with \ndocumentary requirements.11 This shows the need to streamline border control and documentary \nprocedures  and  to  fully  operationalize  the  National  Single  Window  (NSW)  for  exporters  and \nimporters. \n \n11. \nThe  institutions  and  bodies  established  to  provide  essential  trade-related  services  to \nexporters have inherent weaknesses. Institutions responsible for metrology and product testing, \ncertification  services  for  export  product  quality,  accreditation  services  for  testing  bodies, \nintellectual  property  rights  enforcement,  and  establishment  of  special  economic  zones  play  a \ncritical  role  in  trade  facilitation  and  competitiveness.12  Both  large  and  small  businesses  have \n\n                                                \n6  A.

Islamabad: Pakistan Institute of Development Economics. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\nsuffered from a lack of services to help them comply with changes in world trade rules, embodied \nin  the  technical  barriers  to  trade,  sanitary,  and  phytosanitary  measures  of  the  World  Trade \nOrganization.  For  example,  poor  testing  and  certification  facilities  make  the  export  of  many \nagricultural  commodities  difficult.  In  addition,  limited  access  to  trade  finance  places  many \nexporters at a disadvantage to international competitors, which can access financial support from \ntheir country\u2019s national export credit agency, including credit enhancements, low-cost financing, \nand  insurance  for  extended  payment  terms.  The  lack  of  trade  finance  seriously  challenges \nPakistan\u2019s  exporters,  and  did  so  especially  after  the  financial  crisis  in  2008\u20132009.  The  full \noperationalization  of  the  EXIMBP  could  remedy  this.13  Financing  constraints  are  even  more \nserious  for  women  entrepreneurs;  lack  of  finance  turned  out  to  be  the  major  bottleneck  for \nbusinesswomen in World Bank surveys done in 2015 and 2016.14 \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe vision of the strategic trade policy framework (STPF), 2019\u20132023 is for Pakistan to \nbecome  a  dynamic  and  efficient  domestic  market  and  a  globally  competitive,  export-driven \neconomy.  Vision  2025  articulates  the  government\u2019s  aim  to  encourage trade,  increase  exports, \nand improve the competitiveness of domestic industries in Pakistan  as a means to reduce the \ncurrent account deficit and foster macroeconomic stability and sustained high growth.15 The STPF \nobjective  is  to  make  exports  a  driver  of  economic  growth,  reduce  the  relative  disincentive  for \nexport  industries  by  removing  structural  anomalies,  and  improve  the  trade  ecosystem  by \nincreasing  institutional  efficiencies  and  reducing  the  cost  of  doing  business.  The  STPF\u2019s  main \ngoals are to (i) increase exports at a minimum compound annual growth rate of 15% per year until \nFY2023; (ii) improve the competitiveness and efficiency of industry, especially the export industry, \nby  restoring  average mean  tariffs to  FY2011  levels;  (iii)  step  up regional  integration  by  raising \nregional  trade\u2019s  share  of  total  trade  by  20%;  and  (iv)  promote  sustainable,  socially  compliant, \ninclusive, and gender-sensitive export development. \n \nThe  program  will  help  define  and  implement  key  reforms  to  tackle  the  development \n13. \nchallenges discussed in paras. 7\u201311 and to improve Pakistan\u2019s export performance. The reforms \nare grouped in two areas under the programmatic approach, and all the 13 subprogram 1 policy \nactions have been completed.16 \n\n(i) \n\nTax  and  tariff  rationalization. The  principal  objective is to promote  a  business \nenvironment  that  enables  export  competitiveness  and  facilitates  private  sector \ninvestment. The price competitiveness will be boosted by abolishing or reducing \nseveral regulatory and customs duties on raw materials and intermediate inputs. \nUnder subprogram 1, the government (i) submitted the draft national tariff policy to \nthe federal cabinet for approval, (ii) rationalized the tariff rates into a maximum of \nfour slabs with a 20% peak rate, (iii) abolished or reduced customs and regulatory \nduties  on  several  raw  materials  and  intermediate  inputs,  and  (iv) reduced  the \n\n                                                \n13 The World Bank commissioned a survey on trade and trade finance developments during the first quarter of 2009. \nThe  survey  of  425  firms  and  78  banks  in  14  developing  countries  across  five  regions  confirmed  that  the  global \nfinancial crisis constrained trade finance for exporters and importers in developing countries. The impact varied by \nfirm  size,  sector  activity,  and  the  country\u2019s  integration  into  the  global  economy,  but  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises  were  particularly  vulnerable,  making  export  diversification  more  difficult,  especially  in  low-income \ncountries (M. Malouche. 2009. Trade and Trade Finance Developments in 14 Developing Countries Post September \n2008: A World Bank Survey. Policy Research Working Paper. No. 5138.

These reforms will continue with logically sequenced policy \nactions proposed for subprogram 2. Under subprogram 2, the government will (i) \napprove  the  national  tariff  policy,  (ii) remove  the  requirement  for  importers  to \nconfirm that all imported machinery and capital goods are not made locally to avail \nof  customs  duty  exemption,  (iii) exempt  several  raw  materials  and  intermediate \ninputs from customs duties,17 (iv) reduce the corporate tax rate further to 28% and \nthe  dividend  tax  from  15%  to  10%,  and  (v)  remove  the  electricity  surcharge  of \nPRs3.35 per kilowatt-hour on industrial consumers. \nInstitutional strengthening. The rationalization of taxes, duties, and tariffs cannot \nimprove  Pakistan\u2019s  exports  unless  the  trade-relevant  legal  and  institutional \nstructures  are  strengthened  at  the  same  time.18  The  program  targets  three \nimportant reform areas: operationalizing the NSW, operationalizing the EXIMBP, \nand strengthening the certification and accreditation systems. For subprogram 1, \nthe government (a) prepared the draft e-commerce policy framework; (b) approved \nthe  operational  rules  for  appointments,  promotions,  and  transfers  of  Pakistan \nNational Accreditation Council (PNAC) employees, while PNAC published on its \nwebsite the long-term plans, policies, and schemes in line with international best \npractices, including export certification for gems and jewelry; (c) notified the high-\nlevel  steering  committee  for  the  NSW,  the  project  management  office,  and  five \nworking  groups  to  promote  export  facilitation;19  (d)  approved  the  NSW  blueprint \nand implementation plan to operationalize the NSW; (e) prepared the draft NSW \nact, which articulates the NSW business processes in line with international legal \nstandards  and  best  practices, \nfor  stakeholder  consultations;  (f) approved \namendments  to  the  Refinance  and  Credit  Guarantee  Scheme  for  Women \nEntrepreneurs  in  Underserved  Areas  to  expand  its  applicability  to  all  districts  of \nPakistan  and  improve  women  entrepreneurs\u2019  access  to  finance  by  allowing \nworking capital financing; and (g) initiated the recruitment of a full-time professional \nchief executive officer for the EXIMBP. These reforms will continue with logically \nsequenced policy actions proposed for subprogram 2. Under subprogram 2, the \ngovernment  will  submit  the  draft  e-commerce  act  to  the  National  Assembly  for \nconsideration. It will also amend the Pakistan National Accreditation Act, 2017 to \n(a) reconstitute the PNAC board of directors to include professionals with sector \nexpertise and scientific knowledge; restrict ex officio members to one-third of total \nboard members; ensure at least one woman on the board; and set a 3-year fixed \nterm for each board member, except for ex officio members; and (b) empower the \nboard of governors to recommend three candidates to the federal government for \nappointment as PNAC director general and/or chief executive officer. In addition, \nunder subprogram 2, the government will (a) ensure the approval of the long-term \n\n                                                \n17 The selected raw materials and intermediate inputs are in the policy matrix in Appendix 4. \n18 Without  adequate  human,  institutional,  and  infrastructure  capacity  to  participate  effectively  in  international  trade, \ncountries will not be able to expand the quantity and quality of goods and services they can supply to world markets \nat competitive prices (World Trade Organization. Building Trade Capacity). \n\n19 The single-window system in trade allows parties to lodge standardized information and documents with a single-\nentry point to fulfill all import, export, and transit-related regulatory requirements. After introducing the single window \nin Singapore, the time to process trade  documents fell from 4 days to 15 minutes. Total savings for the business \ncommunity  from  using  uTradeHub,  a  paperless  trading  system  in  the  Republic  of  Korea,  are  estimated  at \n$1.82 billion. Savings accrue from lower transmission costs by using e-documents; from greater productivity thanks \nto automated administration work; and from more efficient management, storage, and retrieval of information and \ndocuments  thanks  to  information  technology  (S.  Lim.  2012.  Single  Window  Implementation:  Benefits  and  Key \nSuccess  Factors.  Presentation  at  the  UNNExT  Capacity  Building  Workshop  for  Tajikistan  Single  Window \nImplementation. Bangkok. 18\u201319 November). \n\n\f7 \n\nplans, policies, and schemes of PNAC; (b) submit a status report on the activities \nof PNAC\u2019s five working groups; (c) complete targeted activities as per the NSW \nblueprint and implementation plan; (d) submit the draft NSW act to the National \nAssembly for consideration; (e) finalize the transfer of modules and activities from \nthe web-based one customs (WeBOC) platform to the NSW; and (f) approve the \nEXIMBP business plan and financial model, and finalize the draft EXIMBP act. \n\n \n14. \nA programmatic approach is needed because the structural reforms require a long-term \nhorizon to be implemented effectively. The implementation of most of the reforms must begin with \nessential changes to the legal, institutional, and human resource structures. Evaluating capacity \nconstraints while designing the reforms is equally important. Therefore, the sequencing of reforms \nwill  remain  critical.  For  example,  operationalizing  the  NSW  requires  sufficient  preparatory  and \nimplementation time. Similarly, operationalizing the EXIMBP requires a gradual approach starting \nwith designing the business plan and the financial model. A programmatic approach is suitable \nfor chronologically sequencing the reforms in a multiyear framework. It also enables alignment of \npolicy actions with unavoidable realities and exogenous shocks. Moreover, the modality plays a \nleveraging and catalyzing role in coordinating the technical assistance (TA) support provided by \ndevelopment partners. \n \n15. \nThe value addition of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) stems from its long experience \nin designing and implementing policy-based loans in ADB developing member countries (DMCs), \nincluding  Pakistan.20  These  loans  covered  several  areas  of  economic  management,  including \nrevenue mobilization and expenditure rationalization. ADB also supported reforms to state-owned \nenterprises and the energy sector in Pakistan. The program draws on lessons from these loans. \nStrong  government  commitment  and  adequate  support  from  all  stakeholders  are  the  two \nimportant prerequisites for a successful policy-based reform program. Thus, setting realistic policy \nactions, sequenced logically, is crucial to ensuring the government\u2019s commitment. These reforms \nwill also need to be supported by adequate capacity development assistance. \n \n16. \nADB\u2019s  value  addition  can  be  grouped  in  three  broad  categories:  (i)  facilitating  the \nidentification and sequencing of key reforms with immediate impact (tariff and tax rationalization) \nand medium-term impact (institutional strengthening), and international good practices in several \nareas of economic management; (ii) providing operational support to implement complex reforms \n(such as operationalizing the EXIMBP and the NSW) through transaction TA; and (iii) coordinating \nwith other development partners, especially the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World \nBank,  to  provide  a  unified  reform  package  to  the  government.  A  stand-alone  transaction  TA \nproject totaling $750,000 from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) \nwas approved on 5 September 2018 to support the effective preparation and implementation of \nthe program, including technical aid and capacity building.21 \n \nDevelopment  partner and/or  donor  coordination.

It is coordinating with the IMF, in particular, which approved a new $6 billion extended \nfund facility program in 2019 for Pakistan to improve macroeconomic management. The previous \nfacility  was  completed  in  September  2016.23  The  ADB  program  will  complement  the  IMF-led \nreform  initiatives  by  helping  improve  competitiveness,  which  in  turn  will  help  build  up  robust \nforeign  exchange  reserves.  The  IMF\u2019s  emphasis  on  a  market-driven  exchange  rate  will  also \ncomplement  the  program  by  improving  the  price  competitiveness  of  Pakistan\u2019s  exports.24  The \nWorld  Bank  is  processing  a  program-for-results  financing  (PforR)  modality  to  support  the \nimplementation of various actions under the STPF over 4\u20135 years.25 ADB\u2019s support for the NSW \ndraws  from  the  initial  plan  prepared  with  support  from  the  US  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment.  ADB  is  also  coordinating  with  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  to \nfacilitate the design of its complementary reforms. \n \nC. \n \n18. \nPakistan\u2019s  overarching  development  objective  is  to  foster  macroeconomic  stability  and \nsustainable high growth. Since trade is expected to play a vital role in this context, improving the \ncountry\u2019s export competitiveness remains an important pillar. The program will help achieve this \nthrough  the  proposed  reforms,  which  will  primarily  assist  Pakistan  in  making  (i)  its  traditional \nexport items more price competitive in international markets; and (ii) the trade infrastructure and \ninstitutions conducive to higher exports and the diversification of export goods. \n \nD. \n \n19. \nThe reforms under the program will have significant cost implications for the government. \nRevenue losses from tax and tariff rationalization and the operationalization of the NSW and the \nEXIMBP will lead to additional fiscal stress. The amount of fiscal stress is estimated at $2 billion \nover 3 years. The government is in the midst of a comprehensive fiscal consolidation exercise to \n(i)  bring  the  debt\u2013GDP  ratio  onto  a  firm  downward  trajectory,  (ii)  maintain  a  sustainable  fiscal \ndeficit  while  safeguarding  macroeconomic  stability,  and  (iii)  set  the  stage  for  sustainable  and \ninclusive  growth.  This  is  expected  to  be  achieved  primarily  through  revenue  mobilization  and \nexpenditure rationalization. However, given the sluggish nature of short- to medium-term revenue \nimprovements  and  the  presence  of  large  nondiscretionary  expenditure  items,  the  ratio  of \nconsolidated fiscal deficit (including grants) to GDP is expected to increase from 6.8% in FY2019 \nto 7.1% in FY2020. The IMF\u2019s adjustment scenario projects the deficit (including grants) to drop \nto 5.2% in FY2021. As a result, the government will not have  enough fiscal headroom to incur \nadditional development finance for the targeted reforms proposed under the program. This is a \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\n                                                \n22 The G5 consists of ADB, the IMF, the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development, the US Agency \n\nfor International Development, and the World Bank. \n\n23 IMF.  2018.  First  Post-Program  Monitoring  Discussions\u2014Press  Release;  Staff  Report;  and  Statement  by  the \nExecutive  Director  for  Pakistan.  Washington,  DC.  The  report  voices  concern  over  Pakistan\u2019s  rapidly  depleting \nreserves, and highlights that sustained efforts are needed to ensure macroeconomic stability. \n\n24 Domestic currency depreciation also leads to higher prices of imported raw materials and intermediate goods. The \n\ntariff rationalization under the program is vital to ensure net benefits to exporters that import raw materials. \n\n25 The Pakistan Goes Global program aims to contribute to sustainable growth by increasing the integration of Pakistani \nfirms into the global economy through a sharp reduction of the economy\u2019s anti-export bias. It starts with the premise \nthat integration into global markets through trade and investment plays a crucial role in achieving that objective. The \nprogram has three pillars: (i) strengthening institutions to ensure effective service delivery and alignment of objectives \nat the federal level in terms of competitiveness, (ii) changing the incentives regimes under which firms operate to \nmake integration profitable for firms, and (iii) improving Pakistani firms\u2019 technology and innovations. \n\n\f9 \n\nclear illustration of a hard budget constraint and its impact on development financing, given the \ndownward  rigidity  in  nondiscretionary  items  of  recurrent  expenditure  (salary,  pensions,  and \ninterest).  Strong  expenditure  rationalization  and  revenue  mobilization  efforts  will  need  to  be \nmaintained rigorously to create room for additional reform-related expenditure, to the extent it is \nreflected in the federal budget, within the fiscal deficit targets. \n \n20. \nBased on the development financing requirements of the program, ADB will provide policy-\nbased  lending  totaling  $800  million,  structured  into  two  subprograms.  For  subprogram  1,  the \ngovernment  has  requested  a  concessional  loan  of  $500  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the program. This will help the government compensate for revenue \nlosses already incurred from the tariff and corporate tax rationalization.26 The loan will have a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2% per year during the grace \nperiod and thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nE. \n \nThe Economic Reforms Unit of the Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency of the \n21. \nprogram. The Ministry of Finance, the Federal Board of Revenue, the Ministry of Commerce and \nTextiles, PNAC, and the EXIMBP are the proposed implementing agencies. The proceeds of the \npolicy-based  loan  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time). The programmatic approach is being implemented from \n1 January  2018  to  31  December  2020.  Subprogram  1  is  expected  to  be  implemented  by \n31 August 2019 and subprogram 2 is expected to be implemented by 31 December 2020. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \nSeveral program outputs have technical components at their core.  Operationalizing the \n22. \nEXIMBP will require strong financial and project management as well as selection skills. Similarly, \noperationalizing the NSW will require sound technical knowledge. Capacity building support under \nthe program will assist the respective government departments in better managing these technical \noperations. \n \nB. \n \nThe program was subjected to economic analysis, the results of which demonstrate that \n23. \nits benefits considerably outweigh the costs. The key direct and indirect benefits considered are \nclassified into four groups. \n\nEconomic \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nGiven low but statistically significant price elasticity of export demand (-0.27), the \nrationalization  of  tariffs,  regulatory  duties,  and  commodity  taxes  will  improve \nPakistan\u2019s export competitiveness. This in turn will also facilitate higher growth by \ncreating  demand  for  necessary  locally  made  raw  materials.  This  is  also \ncorroborated by the Granger Causality test (see Economic Analysis). \nHigher foreign exchange reserves will allow domestic output to increase, permitting \nthe resulting increase in imports. \n\n                                                \n26 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nSeveral reforms related to trade facilitation, including better access to finance, will \nease supply-side constraints and lead to trade diversification, catering to the group \nwith a higher income elasticity of demand.27 \nA reduction in the corporate tax rate will lead to more private investment. This in \nturn will lead to more growth, trade diversification, and job opportunities. \n\nGovernance \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n \nC. \n \nADB  staff  conducted  a  governance  risk  assessment  in  line  with  the  Guidelines  for \n24. \nImplementing  ADB\u2019s  Second  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan.28  This  was \ncomplemented  by  a  review  of  areas  of  possible  risk  and  vulnerability  in  state  financial \nmanagement.  The  governance  assessment  found  risks  that  could  affect  the  programmatic \napproach, such as (i) weak political support for and government ownership of reforms, especially \nsensitive  reforms;  and  (ii)  weak  institutional  capacity,  among  other  constraints.  The  financial \nmanagement  assessment  found  one  important  area  of  concern:  key  reforms  may  not  be \nimplemented  effectively  and  in  good  time  because  of  the  hard  budget  constraint  of  the \ngovernment. While no major risks of mismanagement of resources at the implementing level could \nbe discerned, areas relating to institutional capacity and financial sustainability, especially at the \nEXIMBP, were targeted for capacity development under the transaction TA and policy changes \nunder the program. \n \nD. \n \n25. \nThe poverty reduction and social impacts of the program are positive. Support for better \ngrowth through higher export volumes will have a significant impact on job opportunities and will \nalso have an impact on income poverty, especially in a situation of rising inflation. Higher private \ninvestment is expected from the rationalization of the corporate tax rate and the dividend tax. The \nprogram  proposes  targeted  gender-related  actions.  Wider  access  to  finance  for  women \nentrepreneurs and easier certification of jewelry, for example, will have a significant impact on \nwomen  exporters.  Research  shows  that  women  entrepreneurs  lack  access  to  basic  banking \nservices,  a  problem  that  is  exacerbated  when  they  apply  for  trade  finance  for  exports.  The \nprogram will address this issue and encourage further amendments to one of the bank finance \nschemes  for  women  entrepreneurs,29  which  was  amended  to  cover  all  districts  in  Pakistan. \nTargeted gender interventions will continue under subprogram 2. The program will facilitate the \ninclusion  of  women  on  the  PNAC  board  of  directors.  The  transaction  TA  will  help  prepare  a \ndatabase for women exporters in Pakistan. \n \nE. \n \n26. \nfor the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \n\nGiven the nature of the program, subprogram 1\u2019s safeguards classification is category C \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n27 For  example,  J.
