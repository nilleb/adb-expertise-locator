The  Indonesian  economy  is  at  a  major  crossroads. \nEconomic  growth  decelerated  from  its  peak  of  6.4%  in  2010  to  4.8%  in  2015.  This  is  mainly \nbecause the commodity price boom ended and macro policies were tightened to lower inflation \nand the current account deficit. Reliance on commodities has exposed structural weaknesses in \nthe  economy,  including  inefficient  investment  allocation  and  underinvestment  in  infrastructure. \nThese structural weaknesses are reflected in the adjustment to a lower economic growth path, \nwith the economy expected to grow by about 4.9%\u20135.3% in 2016, significantly below the bottom \nof  the  government\u2019s  target  range  of  7.0%\u20139.0%,  stated  in  the  National  Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan (RPJMN), 2015\u20132019.3 The economic slowdown, combined with volatility in \nglobal  financial  and  commodity  markets,  has  strained  fiscal  management\u2014with  tax  revenue \ncollections declining by 2.1% in the first quarter of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. \nGiven commitments to social and infrastructure spending in the 2016 budget, the fiscal deficit is \nexpected to be higher than the projected deficit of 2.1% of gross domestic product (GDP). \n \n4. \nAgainst this backdrop of slower economic growth, structural adjustment, and increased \nfiscal  pressures,  the  government  is  challenged  in  promoting  inclusive  growth.  Since  2000, \nIndonesia  has  experienced  one  of  the  largest  increases  in  inequality  of  all  Southeast  Asian \neconomies. The Gini index, used to measure household income inequality, increased from 0.30 \nin  2000  to  0.40  in  2015  and  is  explained  in  part  by  insufficient  job  creation.  For  example,  the \nrate  of  job  creation  is  insufficient  to  reduce  Indonesia\u2019s  12.2  million  youth  not  in  employment, \neducation, or training\u2014the highest rate in Southeast Asia (Figure 1). Uneven economic growth \nacross  provinces  has  also  contributed  to  widening  of  regional  income  disparities,  with  several \nprovinces  in  eastern  Indonesia  significantly  lagging  Java  and  Bali  in  per  capita  income.  For \nexample,  Jakarta\u2019s  2014  nominal  per  capita  income  ($14,816)  is  13  times  higher  than  that  of \nEast Nusa Tenggara ($1,154).  \n\n                                                \n1   ADB.  2014.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Programmatic \nApproach and Policy-Based Loan for Subprogram 1 to the Republic of Indonesia for Stepping Up Investments for \nGrowth Acceleration Program. Manila. \n\n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The  government\u2019s  2016  national  budget  projects  5.3%  growth.  ADB.  2016.  Asian  Development  Outlook  2016. \nManila  projects  5.2%.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Indonesia  quarterly  report  in  March  2016  projects  5.1%,  and  the \nInternational Monetary Fund 2016 Article IV Staff report projects 4.9%. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nTherefore, increasing investment in job-creating industries is a vital government priority. \n5. \nThe share of investment to GDP rose slightly to 26.2% in 2014, up from 25.1% in 2010. There is \nalso  a  strong  willingness  to  embrace  FDI.  Excluding  financial  services,  Indonesia  was  ranked \nthe 14th largest recipient of FDI in the world in 2014. Yet investment is inefficient and expensive \ncompared with the income it generates, and too much of it is wasted. For example, a common \nmeasure of investment efficiency is the incremental capital output ratio. In 2014, this ratio was \nhigh,  at  5.5,  meaning  that  $5.5  spent  on  investment  produces  only  $1.0  of  income  (Figure  2). \nThe incremental capital output ratio in neighboring countries is about 3.0\u20134.0.4 \n \n6. \nIndonesia\u2019s  difficult  business  climate  is  one  of  the  reasons  for  this  high-cost  and \ninefficient allocation of investment. According to the World Bank\u2019s 2016 Doing Business Report,5 \nIndonesia  is  ranked  109th  out  of  189  countries  in  ease  of  doing  business.  While  this  is  an \nimprovement  of  11  places  over  the  2015  report,  it  compares  unfavorably  with  many  of  its \nregional  neighbors:  Malaysia  (18th),  the  Philippines  (103th),  Thailand  (49th),  and  Viet  Nam \n(90th).  A  cumbersome  business  licensing  regime  has  contributed  to  this  high-cost  business \nenvironment. Indonesia still retains significant equity restrictions on FDI in the services sector. \n\nFigure 1: Rates of Youth Not in Employment, \nEducation, or Training \u2013  International \nComparison a   \n\nFigure 2: Investment Rate (% of GDP)  \nand Incremental Capital Output Ratio \n\n \n\nICOR  =  incremental  capital  output  ratio;  GDP  =  gross  domestic  product;  OECD  =  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-\noperation and Development. \na  As a percentage of youth population.

The  World  Economic  Forum\u2019s  Global  Competitiveness  Report  2015\u20132016 \nranks Indonesia 62nd out of 140 countries on the quality of its overall infrastructure\u2014well below \nMalaysia  (24th)  and  Thailand  (44th).6 This  is  the  result  of  low  public  infrastructure  investment \nspending  (average  of  1.5%  of  GDP  from  2008  to  2012);  inadequate  private  participation  in \ninfrastructure investment (average of 0.6% of GDP from 2008 to 2012); and an inefficient public \nprocurement system,  where  45.0%  of  budget  disbursements  are  made  in the  last  2 months of \nthe fiscal year, creating a drag on public infrastructure delivery. Indonesia\u2019s annual infrastructure \ninvestment  needs  are  estimated  at  6.2%  of  GDP  (3.9%  of  GDP  in  transport,  1.0%  of  GDP  in \nenergy, 1.0% of GDP in telecommunications, and 0.4% of GDP in water and sanitation).7 \n\n                                                \n4  Sector Assessment (Summary): Industry and Trade (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5  World Bank. 2016.

Geneva. \n7  ADB estimates with data are taken from Indonesia\u2019s national account. \n\n\fthat  deters \n\nBinding constraints. The government has recognized the set of challenges it needs to \n8. \ndeal  with  to  increase  investment  in  job-creating  industries,  including  (i)  addressing  the \nproliferation  of  high-cost  business  regulations \ninvestors,  (ii)  accelerating \ninfrastructure  delivery  through  increased  participation  of  the  private  sector,  and  (iii)  resolving \ninefficiencies in the public procurement system to speed up delivery of infrastructure projects. \n \n9. \nHigh-cost  business  regulatory  environment.  A  proliferation  of  regulations  (both  at \nnational and subnational levels), cumbersome licensing procedures, and remaining restrictions \non foreign investment, particularly in services, have created a high-cost business environment. \nThe  average  number  of  regulations  issued  by  both  national  and  subnational  governments \nincreased  from  453  per  year  during  1999\u20132003  to  1,789  per  year  in  2010\u20132014.  Starting  a \nbusiness  in  Indonesia  requires  an  investor  to  obtain  10  approvals,  and  the  process  takes  48 \ndays  compared  with  three  approvals  and  6  days  in  Malaysia.  Indonesia  would  benefit  from \nadopting \nimpact \ninternational  good  regulatory  practice,  such  as  mandatory  regulatory \nassessments  for  significant  regulatory  proposals.  Tax  administration  also  imposes  significant \nbusiness compliance costs on investors, such as the predominance of manual tax return filing \nand tax payment procedures. Moreover, the negative investment list has placed binding ceilings \non  direct  foreign  equity  investment  in  the  services  sector,  impeding  growth  prospects  in  these \nsectors and Indonesia\u2019s progress in meeting its ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) goals.8 \n \nInefficient  market  for  infrastructure  investment.  Increasing  public  infrastructure \n10. \nspending  is  critical  to  address  the  country\u2019s  infrastructure  deficit  and  for  crowding-in  private \nparticipation in infrastructure. A poor institutional, policy, and regulatory framework for promoting \nprivate participation in infrastructure investment projects, and the lack of long-term financing for \ninfrastructure  investments  have  also  contributed  to  an  inefficient  market  for  infrastructure  in \nIndonesia.  Four  main  policy \ninfrastructure \ninvestments in Indonesia. First, until 2014 the government did not have a PPP unit and a project \ndevelopment facility for financing feasibility studies and transaction advisory services, which are \nboth important for facilitating private participation in public infrastructure projects. As a result of \nthis  undeveloped  institutional framework, the government  does  not  have capacities to  develop \nand implement a robust pipeline of PPP infrastructure projects. Second, financial and fiscal risks \narising  from  PPP  infrastructure  projects  need  to  be  managed  and  budgeted  for,  such  as  the \ngovernment providing grants\u2013known as viability gap funding (VGF)\u2013to the PPP entity to ensure \nthe  commercial  viability  of \nthe  PPP  project.  Performance-based  payments\u2013known  as \navailability-based  PPP  contracts\u2013are  also  necessary  to  ensure  quality  projects.  Third,  a  major \nconstraint  to  private  participation  in  infrastructure  investments  is  the  absence  of  a  long-term \nasset  class  that  can  provide  long-term  financing  for  public  infrastructure  through  the  capital \nmarket.  Fourth,  the  land  acquisition  process  needs  to  be  made  more  timely,  transparent,  and \nfair to allow for more private sector participation in public infrastructure projects. \n \nInefficient  public  procurement  system.  Inefficiencies  in  public  procurement  are \n11. \nreflected in the concentration of public infrastructure procurement (45%) toward the end of each \nfiscal  year  because  of  lengthy  procurement  approval  processes.9 Improving  transparency  and \nthe  professionalism  of  procurement  officers,  as  well  as  promoting  competition  in  public \nprocurement,  are  necessary  to  accelerate  the  delivery  of  infrastructure  investments.  The \ngovernment will need to adopt international standards in public procurement practices, such as \ne-procurement  systems,  and  introduce  international  competitive  bidding  documents  to  enable \nforeign firms to compete in the domestic market on a level playing field. \n\nimpediments  affect  private  participation \n\nin \n\n                                                \n8  The AEC aims to create a single market in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.  \n9  Data are taken from the National Public Procurement Agency Monitoring and Evaluation system. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fGovernment reform agenda. To raise the economic growth rate above the 2016 range \n12. \nof 4.9%\u20135.3%, the government recognizes that it needs to pursue structural reforms to allocate \ninvestment more efficiently to job-creating industries. The new RPJMN, 2015\u20132019 cites income \ninequality reduction as one of its main priorities. Employment creation can help reduce income \ninequality. To  achieve  it,  the RPJMN  calls for  an  increased effort  and resources for  education, \nskills development, finance sector development, energy sector development, and investment in \ninfrastructure;  and  mandates  continued  reform  of  the  investment  and  business  climate.  The \nRPJMN  identifies initiatives to  simplify  investment  procedures and regulatory  reform,  liberalize \nFDI,  increase  budget  spending  on  public  infrastructure,  increase  private  participation  in \ninfrastructure  projects,  resolve  land acquisition  impediments,  and  improve  public  procurement. \nConsistent with this focus, since September 2015 the government has announced 12 economic \nreform  packages  aimed  at  simplifying  business  and  logistics  regulations  and  procedures,  and \nremoving  nontariff  barriers  to  trade.  It  also  considers  achieving  its  AEC  goals  a  catalyst  for \nfurther domestic investment climate reforms. \n  \n13. \nADB\u2019s  experience.  ADB  has  supported  reforms  in  the  investment  climate  through \nseveral loan programs, technical assistance (TA), and knowledge products (Figure 3). In 2001, \nthe  focus  was  on  state-owned  enterprises  reform  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise \ndevelopment,  but  this  has  shifted  to  improving  public  infrastructure  policy  and  connectivity \nacross Indonesia. Since 2014, ADB has focused on sector reforms\u2014with the goal of improving \nthe investment climate using an integrated sector approach. ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved \nthe Stepping Up Investments for Growth Acceleration programmatic approach and subprogram \n1 loan in September 2014, and established a structured medium- to long-term engagement on \ninvestment climate reforms with the new government (footnote 1). ADB has provided a series of \nTA projects to support the implementation of reforms under the program.10 Through subprogram \n2,  ADB  will  continue  to  work  with  the  government  to  create  a  predictable  and  open  business \nclimate,  build  an  efficient  market  for  infrastructure  by  strengthening  the  government\u2019s  PPP \nprogram  and  diversified modalities of  infrastructure financing,  and  improve public  procurement \nfor  faster  delivery  of  infrastructure  projects.  The  program  supplements  ADB\u2019s  financial  market \ndevelopment  and  inclusion  program,  approved  by  the  Board  in  September  2015,  which \naddresses \nfinancing  of \nto  capital  market  development  and \ninfrastructure.11 The inclusive energy program, also approved by ADB in 2015, supports a better \ninvestment  climate  by  addressing  Indonesia\u2019s  energy  deficit. 12  In  2016,  together  with  the \ngovernment,  ADB  is  preparing  an  education  sector  reform  program  that  aims  to  improve  the \nquality  of  education  and  address  the  youth  skills  mismatch  in  the  labor  market.  ADB  is  also \npreparing  an  engineering  project  that  aims  to  improve  the  quality  and  timely  start-up  of  public \ninfrastructure  projects,  which  could  be  a  catalyst  for  lifting  public  infrastructure  spending. 13 \nADB\u2019s Office of PPP is discussing with the government the provision of advisory services to the \nNorth Sumatra provincial government to develop Rawasaring, a 100-kilometer brownfield road. \n\nimpediments \n\nlong-term \n\n                                                \n10 ADB. 2014.

A \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach\u2014where all departments provide \nhighly  coordinated  support  to  the  government\u2019s  economic  reforms\u2014improves  program \neffectiveness and creates reform impact. This includes support for a medium-term policy reform \nframework, sustained capacity development TA, knowledge products, and an integrated sector \napproach  to  improving  the  investment  climate  with  program-  and  project-specific  support.  A \nsecond lesson is the need to engage with local governments in a decentralized system and to \nprovide  sustained  capacity  development  TA  to  enable  local  governments  to  pilot  test  reforms. \nAs  a  result  of  progress  in  these  two  areas,  ADB  support  is  shifting  to  policy  dialogue  and \nreforms at both the national and subnational levels, and taking an integrated sector approach to \nimproving the investment climate. \n \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank \n\n \n15. \nADB\u2019s value added to the  program design and implementation. Key policy reforms \nunder subprogram 1 included raising foreign equity ceilings in land transportation, shipping, and \nmanagement of ports; establishing KPPIP to screen, monitor, and evaluate 30 national strategic \nprojects for selection under the PPP program; establishing a dedicated office to formulate land \nacquisition  policy;  and  initiating  the  development  of  e-procurement.  Reforms  proposed  under \nsubprogram  2  focuses  on  operationalizing  reforms  and  securing  budget  allocations.  This \nincludes further liberalizing foreign ownership in the services sector; operationalizing the KPPIP \nand the National One Stop Service (OSS) Center for large investors; establishing the PPP Unit \nat the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and the Project Development Fund (PDF) under the PPP Unit; \nand  implementing  e-procurement  systems  in  the  national  government  and  pilot  testing  in \nselected local governments. \n\n \n16. \nADB  has  provided  direct  support  to  the  completion  of  reforms  proposed  under \nsubprogram  2.  The  project  preparatory  TA  (footnote  10)  provided  advisory  support  to  the \nCoordinating  Ministry  for  Economic  Affairs  (the  executing  agency)  and  Indonesia  Investment \nCoordinating Board (BKPM) on business climate reforms based on the TA-funded assessment \nof the ease of doing business in five local governments, including Jakarta and Surabaya. These \nefforts provided input to the government\u2019s most recent economic reform packages coordinated \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nthrough  the  executing  agency.  The  TA  on  municipal  bonds  (footnote  10)  provided  capacity \ndevelopment  support  to  the  West  Java  provincial  government  on  debt  management  and \nissuance  of  municipal  bonds.  ADB\u2019s  TA  on  tax  administration  (footnote  10),  funded  by  the \nGovernment  of  Switzerland,  provided  policy  and  capacity  development  support  to  the  Jakarta \nlocal  government  to  strengthen  its  tax  administration  systems.  Also  under  the  project \npreparatory  TA  (footnote  10),  ADB  assisted  the  Jakarta  local  government  to  establish  an  e-\nprocurement platform for competitive bidding on supplier contracts. \n\n \nThe  results  have  been  impressive.  In  November  2015,  the  OSS  center  issued  almost \n17. \n9,600 licenses. Under the strengthened PPP program, three PPP projects have been prepared \nand  one  contract  signed.  Total  public  procurement  delivery  through  e-procurement  increased \nfrom  Rp2.8  trillion  ($212  million)  in  2013  to  Rp580.9  trillion  ($4.4  billion)  in  2015.  Under  the \npublic e-procurement system, close to 43,500 items are listed in the e-catalog.  \n \nDevelopment partner coordination. Development partner coordination is strong in the \n18. \ninvestment, \ntrade,  PPP,  and  public  procurement  reform  areas.  German  development \ncooperation  through  KfW  provided  parallel  financing  in  the  amount  of  a  $245  million  loan  for \nsubprogram 1 and is considering parallel financing for subprogram 2 with an indicative amount \nof \u20ac200 million ($224.6 million equivalent). Both the ADB and KfW teams have worked closely \nwith the Government of Indonesia in formulating the program. The Government of Switzerland \nhas  also  provided  cofinancing  through  a  $5  million  grant  for  ADB\u2019s  local  tax  administration \nreform project (footnote 10). The Government of Australia, the Government of the United States, \nand  the  World  Bank  are  providing  separate  and  coordinated  support  to  the  government  on \ninvestment climate and PPP reforms.14 \n \n19. \nPolicy-based loan, budget support, and changes to the programmatic approach\u2014\nadditional  subprogram.  ADB  will  continue  its  programmatic  support  to  increase  investment. \nThis  approach  uses  policy-based  lending  in  conjunction  with  extensive  policy  dialogue  in \nrecognition  of  the  long-term  horizon  required  for  investment  climate  reforms.  In  addition, \nsubprogram 2 contains significant additional reforms not originally contemplated in subprogram \n1, such as the national regulatory reform program. Demonstrating this long-term commitment to \ninvestment  climate  reforms,  the  government  has  requested  an  additional  subprogram  3  for \nconsideration  in  2018,  with  increased  focus  on  its  national  regulatory  reform  program, \ninstitutional reforms for good regulatory practice, and its PPP program; and aligns the program \nwith the RPJMN, 2015\u20132019. \n \nEconomic  impact  of  the  program.  The  three  outputs  of  the  program  combined  are \n20. \nexpected to raise public and private investments. Potential economic gains are to be achieved \nthrough  efficiency  gains:  (i)  a  lower  regulatory  burden  on  businesses  and  a  more  open  FDI \nregime; (ii) project costs within budget and timely completion of PPP projects, and an increase \nin the overall level of infrastructure investments, which would not have occurred without the PPP \nprogram;  and  (iii)  improved  public  procurement  in  terms  of  lower  bid  prices  and  timely \nprocurement (para. 31). \n \nB. \n \n21. \nThe  impact  will  be  increased  investment  as  a  share  of  GDP,  in  alignment  with  the \nRPJMN,  2015\u20132019.  The  outcome  will  be  public  and  private  sector  investments  increased.  At \nthe  inception  of  the  programmatic  approach  in  2014,  the  government  agreed  to  22  indicative \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n                                                \n14 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fOutputs \n\npolicy  actions  as  a  basis  for  subprogram  2.  At  the  government\u2019s  request,  ADB  agreed  to \nsharpen the focus  of subprogram  2  and  to  rationalize  some  of  the measures by  concentrating \non  key  reforms.  Through  the  process,  eight  completed  indicative  actions  under  subprogram  2 \nwere  combined  into  four  actions,  six  new  policy  actions  were  added,  five  completed  actions \nwere dropped, and one ongoing action was dropped from the program as no follow-up actions \nwould be necessary.15 Subprogram 2 now contains 18 reform actions (10 expected prior actions \nrepresenting high-impact reforms and eight milestones), which the government completed from \nOctober 2014 to June 2016. The change in the policy matrix is reflected in the revised design \nand  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1).  Subprogram  3  contains  18  policy  actions  of  which  8 \nare expected prior actions. \n \nC. \n \n22. \nOutput  1:  More  predictable  and  open  business  environment. This output builds on \naccomplishments under subprogram 1 to ease restrictions on domestic and foreign investments \nin  three  important  ways.  First,  through  a  series  of  announcements  of  economic  reform \npackages,  the  government  began  a  national  regulatory  reform  program.  Over  147  business, \nlogistics, and trade regulations were either simplified or eliminated. To assist with identifying and \nprioritizing  regulations  for  review  and  reform,  selected  ministries  and  agencies  including  the \nMinistry of Trade established deregulation units with designated staff. Second, the government \nhas  issued  Presidential  Regulation  that  sets  out  the  revised  negative  investment  list,  further \nliberalizing foreign investment by allowing at least 67% foreign ownership in investments in the \nservices  sector\u2014covering  the  creative  industries  (100%  in  film  studios,  movie  production,  and \ndistribution),  tourism-related  industries  (100%  in  hotels  and  restaurants),  and  other  recreation \nenterprises. This is a major reform to the services sector, which will promote new investments \nand jobs. It also accomplishes the government\u2019s AEC commitments to liberalize foreign equity \nrestrictions.  Third,  the  government  reformed  licensing  procedures.  A  major  reform  under \nsubprogram 2 was the 22 line ministries delegating licensing approval authority to BKPM\u2019s OSS \ncenter\u2014significantly  reducing  transaction  costs  for  investors.  By  the  end  of  2015,  the  OSS \ncenter  had  issued  over  9,000  licenses  to  large  investors.  Another  related  reform  was  BKPM \nreducing the administrative time to obtain the eight mandatory national licenses from 23 days to \n3  hours,  and  the  Jakarta  local  government  reducing  the  time  it  takes  to  obtain  local  trading \nlicenses and enterprise registration certificates to 3 hours. \n \n23. \nFor  subprogram  3,  the  government  will  implement  good  regulatory  practices  by \ninstitutionalizing  a  systematic  regulatory  review  program.  This  will  include  setting  up  an \ninterministerial  steering  committee  to  oversee  the  implementation  of  good  regulatory  practices \nand pilot testing regulatory impact assessment programs in selected ministries or agencies.  \n \n24. \nOutput  2:  Creating  an  efficient  market  for  infrastructure  through  public\u2013private \npartnerships.  Output  2  builds  on  efforts  to  develop  a  robust  pipeline  of  PPP  projects  by \nstrengthening  the  institutional,  policy,  and  regulatory  framework  for  PPPs;  and  expanding  the \nfinancing  modalities  for  long-term  financing  of  infrastructure.  These  accomplishments  included \nthe  following.  First,  building  on  subprogram  1,  the  government  operationalized  the  KPPIP  to \nscreen strategic  projects for  the  PPP  program.  Second,  the government strengthened its  PPP \nstructure by establishing the PPP Unit in the MOF to complement the existing PPP directorate in \nthe  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS),  which  is  responsible  for  PPP \nplanning. The new MOF PPP Unit has a PDF to facilitate and prepare PPP projects. Third, the \n\n                                                \n15 Reconciliation  of  the  Original  Subprogram  2  to  the  Revised  Subprogram  2  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fgovernment  has  expanded  PPPs  to  social  infrastructure,  such  as  in  the  health  and  education \nsectors.  An  availability  based  scheme  for  PPP  projects  was  also  introduced.  These  reforms \nhave resulted in the signing of the two availability-based PPP contracts for a telecommunication \nproject. The government has also completed the competitive bidding process for a water supply \nPPP  project,  with  the  support  of  the  PPP  Unit.  In  addition,  the  government  has  implemented \nmeasures to reduce the fiscal and financial risks of PPP projects. The budget allocation for VGF \nin  the  2016  budget  has  been  increased  to  Rp1.1  trillion  ($86  million)  from  Rp814  billion  ($62 \nmillion)  in  the  2015  budget.  The  MOF  has  also  approved  VGF  for  three  main  national  water \nsupply PPP projects. The government has enhanced transparency, efficiency, and predictability \nin the  land  acquisition  process for  infrastructure projects  by  allowing  the private  sector to fund \nland acquisition  on  the government\u2019s  behalf.  It has  also  introduced time-bound  procedures for \nthe  preparation  and  implementation  of  land  acquisition,  and  required  land  compensation \npayments  to  be  made  within  7  days  after  validation  of  claims.  Finally,  the  government  has \ncontinued  to  expand  financing  modalities  for  the  public  share  of  capital  expenditure  of  PPP \nprojects,  including  increasing  issuances  of  sukuk  (Sharia  compliance  bond),  the  MOF \nconsolidating its infrastructure financing facilities, and capacity development of West Java local \ngovernment on debt management in preparation for issuing municipal bonds. \n\n \n25. \nUnder  subprogram  3,  the  government  will  continue  to  strengthen  the  PPP  policy \nframework  by  enabling  local  governments  to  use  availability-based  PPP  schemes,  enhancing \nthe  PDF  mechanism,  and  clarifying  the  treatment  of  unsolicited  PPP  proposal.  MOF  will  also \nstreamline the approval process for VGF and ensure adequate budget allocation for VGF. \n \n26. \nOutput  3:  Faster  and  more  transparent  public  procurement.  Continuing  from \nsubprogram  1,  the  government  mandated  the  use  of  an  e-procurement  system  for  all  public \nprocurement of goods and services, which increased total public procurement delivery through \ne-procurement from Rp2.8 trillion ($213 million) in 2013 to Rp580.9 trillion ($4.4 billion) in 2015. \nThe National Public Procurement Agency (LKPP), with the Jakarta local government, introduced \nan  electronic  platform  for  transparent  competitive  bidding  for  procurement  of  local  goods  and \nservices.  It  also  opened  up  foreign  firms\u2019  direct  participation  in  competitive  bidding  for  large \npublic  infrastructure  projects  by  introducing  international  competitive  bidding  documents  for \nprocurement of goods and services. \n \n27. \nFor  subprogram  3,  the  LKPP  will  continue  to  strengthen  the  public  procurement  legal \nframework  to  incorporate  procurement  audit,  and  will  enhance  the  e-procurement  system  to \ninclude  reverse  auction  of  goods.  LKPP  will  also  assist  the  Jakarta  local  government  in  pilot \ntesting an electronic platform for a transparent bidding process. \n \nD. \n \nThe government has requested a policy-based loan of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \n28. \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 2. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace  period  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest rate determined in  accordance with ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  Based  on  this,  the \naverage  loan  maturity  is  9.25  years,  and  no  maturity  premium  is  payable  to  ADB.  The  loan \nproceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  exchange  cost  (excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of \nitems produced and procured in ADB members, excluding ineligible items and imports financed \nby  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The  proceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be \ndisbursed  to  Indonesia  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  on  simplifying  disbursement \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\frequirements  for  program  loans. 16  The  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW  is \nconsidering parallel financing of subprogram 2. \n \n29. \nIn  the  2016  budget,  the  net  development  financing  needs  are  $19.6  billion.  With  the \ncontinuing economic slowdown in 2016, which has negatively affected tax revenue collections, \nthe  government  has  increased  overseas  development  assistance  loans  from  $3.9  billion  to \n$5.4 billion in the revised 2016 budget. The size of the loan primarily reflects the government\u2019s \nfinancing needs, the strength of the reform program, and the implementation costs (para. 31). \n\n \nImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \n30. \nThe  Coordinating  Ministry  for  Economic  Affairs,  the  executing  agency,  will  be \nresponsible  for  coordinating  the  government\u2019s  economic  reform  packages.  The  MOF;  BKPM; \nthe Ministry of Agrarian and Spatial Planning; PT Sarana Multi Infrastruktur (Persero), a state-\nowned  infrastructure  financing  company;  and  LKPP  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  The \nimplementation  of  program  policy  actions  will  be  monitored  through  a  steering  committee \nchaired by a deputy minister of the executing agency, and will consist of senior representatives \nfrom the implementing agencies. The implementation period is September 2014\u2013June 2016 for \nsubprogram 2, and July 2016\u2013June 2018 for subprogram 3.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic \n\n \nA. \n \nThe program will have positive economy-wide effects. The program impact assessment \n31. \nestimates  the  potential  net  quantifiable  benefits  of  the  program  at  $6.9 billion,  under \nconservative  discounting  assumptions,  which  well  exceed  the  program\u2019s  estimated  costs. 17 Of \nthis,  about  $2.5  billion  flows  to  the  economy  as  a  result  of  increased  trade  and  foreign \ninvestment  inflows  caused  by  better  regulation,  improved  ease  of  doing  business,  and \nstreamlined tax collection measures at national and subnational levels, particularly with respect \nto starting up  a  business.  A further  $1.3  billion  is  expected  to  come from  better  preparation of \nPPP projects, improved public debt management capacity at subnational level, and a better land \nacquisition process. A better public procurement process would also strengthen the governance \noutlook  in  Indonesia,  and  this  is  expected  to  have  a  net  present  benefit  of  $3.4  billion.  The \nreforms will entail costs about $500 million. \n \nB. \n \n32. \nThe government has made considerable progress in improving the legal and regulatory \nframework for public financial management. Since the enactment of laws on state finance, state \ntreasury,  and  state  audit  in  2003\u20132004,  most  regulations  underpinning  these  laws  have  been \npromulgated.  In  2012,  the  number  of  government  agencies  that  received  an  unqualified  audit \nopinion  from  the  external  audit  agency  increased  to  65%,  from  about  40%  in  2009.  ADB  has \nreinforced  this  momentum  with  continuing  support  to  improve  technical  capacity  and  controls. \nAs a result of the government\u2019s continuing commitment to reduce corruption, the capacity of the \nCorruption Eradication Commission has improved markedly. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n16 ADB. 1998.

A  more  conducive  investment  climate  will  lead  to  more  and  better \ninvestment  in  job-creating  industries.  Better  infrastructure  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction \nthrough higher growth and by improved connectivity of more remote areas to markets. Given the \nmacro nature of the program\u2019s reforms, no gender benefits are directly observed. \n \nD. \n \n34. \nimpacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE. \n \n35.  Major risks and mitigating measures are  described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.18 The expected net benefits and impacts of the program are expected to \noutweigh the risks. At the macroeconomic level, medium-level risks include the continuation of \nthe global economic slowdown, which affects budget allocations for infrastructure. Development \npartners  are  providing  coordinated  support  to  the  government  to  safeguard  budget  revenues \nand  expenditures.  At  the  microeconomic  level,  there  are  medium-term  risks  that  local \ngovernments  will  resist  regulatory  reforms  and  vested  interests  may  resist  structural  reforms. \nADB  will  continue  to  assist  the  government  in  improving  the  regulation  making  process  and \nfacilitating stakeholder consultations. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n36. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 2 shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as described in detail  in the loan \ndocuments. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\n37. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n\na change in the programmatic approach to include an additional subprogram, as \nfurther described in para. 19; and \nthe  loan  of  $500,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  subprogram  2  of  the \nStepping Up Investments for Growth Acceleration Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of  15 \nyears, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n6 June 2016 \n\n \n\n                                                \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Program is Aligned with \nInvestment increased as a share of GDP (National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2015\u20132019)a \n\nAppendix 1  11 \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \na.
