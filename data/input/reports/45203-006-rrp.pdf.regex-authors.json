THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Natural  Gas  Infrastructure  and  Efficiency \nImprovement Project.1 The report also describes the proposed administration of a loan to be \nprovided by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) for the Natural Gas Infrastructure \nand Efficiency Improvement Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the loan. \n2.  The project aims to (i) improve efficiency in natural gas production by installing seven \nwellhead  gas  compressors  at  location  A  of  Titas  gas  field,2 and  (ii)  expand  natural  gas \ntransmission pipeline capacity by constructing an approximately 181-kilometer (km), 36-inch (in) \nparallel gas transmission pipeline from Chittagong through Feni to Bakhrabad.3   \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Natural gas availability. Natural gas is Bangladesh\u2019s key indigenous energy source \nand is a driving force of the country\u2019s economy growth. Of Bangladesh\u2019s total primary energy \nconsumption of 28.1 million tons of oil equivalent, 75.4% is met by natural gas, while 58.0% of \ntotal natural gas production is used for electricity generation. The installed capacity of gas-\nbased power generation is 7,628 megawatts (MW), of which 2,300 MW was added before 2015, \nand an additional 4,032 MW is planned by 2021. The gas supply constraint leads to less gas-\nbased power generation and lower industrial production efficiency.4  \n4.  As of June 2016, out of a total recoverable reserve of 27.12 trillion cubic feet (TCF), \ncumulative production was 13.10 TCF. The remaining recoverable reserve of about 14 TCF, if \nfully exploited, can meet the country\u2019s natural gas demand at best for 12 more years with a \nmodest gas-demand growth rate of 5% per year. Currently, the gas production is 2,700 million \ncubic feet per day (MMCFD) against a demand of 3,155 MMCFD, indicating a daily shortage of \n455 MMCFD. The deficit is expected to further exacerbate given declining gas reserves and \nfast-rising demand, which will eventually impact Bangladesh\u2019s energy security and constrain the \nnation\u2019s economic growth. As an immediate crisis management action, the Government of \nBangladesh is handling the current gas supply shortfall by (i) prioritizing gas supply to power \nplants, (ii) curtailing gas supply to fertilizer plants, and (iii) rationing gas supply to compressed \nnatural gas and domestic sectors. \n5.  Exploration and production. In Bangladesh, natural gas exploration and production \nhas not kept pace with demand growth. Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production \nCompany Limited (BAPEX) has not done extensive exploration for many years due to lack of \npublic funds. Exploration in offshore blocks stalled in the early 2000s for various reasons, \nincluding unattractive production-sharing contracts. To combat the gas crisis, there is an urgent \nneed to accelerate gas exploration and production. The Government of Bangladesh established \nthe gas development fund in 2012 to support upstream activities and undertake large-scale \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Location A is one of 10 producing areas in Titas gas field, which is located 100 km northeast from Bangladesh\u2019s \ncapital (Dhaka).  \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Natural Gas \nTransmission and Distribution Development Investment Program (TA-8474).  \n4  In 2015, 800\u20131,000 MW of generation capacity was not operational because of inadequate gas supplies. In \nJanuary 2016, 680 million cubic feet per day (MMCFD) out of 1,548 MMCFD demand could not be met. \n ", "2 \nexploration  in  onshore  and  offshore  areas.5 BAPEX  has  initiated  well  appraisals,  such  as  \nthree-dimensional seismic surveys and development of discovered and producing gas fields, to \nprove additional gas reserves. It is also undertaking an ambitious exploration program of drilling \n108  wells  (53  exploration,  35  development,  and  20  workovers)  by  2021  using  the  gas \ndevelopment fund and other resources to increase production by 1,200 MMCFD.6 Bangladesh \nOil, Gas and Mineral Corporation (Petrobangla) has assigned offshore exploration rights to and \nsigned  new  production-sharing  contracts  with  international  oil  companies  to  complement \nBAPEX\u2019s onshore exploration program. In the meantime, Petrobangla is pursuing a program to \nincrease  recovery  from  existing  gas  fields  by  installing  wellhead  gas  compressors.  The \ngovernment is also considering establishing an energy security fund that will be earmarked for \nthe construction of liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, including the import of LNG and \nliquefied petroleum gas.7 \n6.  As part of gas crisis management, Petrobangla is diversifying the gas supply source \nthrough imports either through inter-country gas transmission pipeline or as LNG. The private \nsector  is  constructing  a  floating  storage  and  regasification  unit  near  Maheshkhali8 on  a  \nbuild\u2013own\u2013operate\u2013transfer  basis  to  import  about  500  MMCFD  of  gas,  and  the  terminal \nconstruction will be completed by the end of 2018. Other initiatives, such as importing gas from \nneighboring countries and constructing land-based LNG terminals, are under consideration to \naugment gas supply in Bangladesh.  \n7.  Since January 2009, a total 706 MMCFD of gas production capacity has been added \nthrough new wells, workovers, or capacity enhancements. An additional 400 MMCFD may be \nproduced when the production augmentation programs under the  Seventh Five-Year Plan, \nFY2016\u2013FY2020 are implemented.9 \n8.  Natural gas transmission infrastructure. Inadequate gas transmission infrastructure is \nanother hurdle in Bangladesh\u2019s gas sector. The gas transmission infrastructure coverage is not \nable to serve the country\u2019s key market areas, as most gas supply points are in the northeast and \ncentral  regions,  while  delivery  points  are  in  the  central,  south,  and  west.  Ongoing  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) loans have greatly enhanced the transmission capability.10 However, \nthe Chittagong area is still suffering from a gas supply shortfall due to full capacity attainment of \nthe existing 175 km, 24-in Bakhrabad\u2013Chittagong gas transmission pipeline. To enhance the \nthroughput  capabilities  and  facilitate  transmission  of  additional  gas,  the  gas  transmission \nnetwork must be expanded to accommodate the upcoming diversified gas supply sources from \nimports and offshore discoveries into the national gas network. \n9.  Gas  pricing.  The  non-cost  reflective  pricing  mechanism  constrains  gas  sector \ndevelopment. The average retail price of gas in Bangladesh is $1.88/million British thermal unit. \nIt is the lowest in the region, is heavily subsidized (compared to alternative sources of energy), \nand does not adequately reflect the gas resources\u2019 actual cost and value. Through its previous \ninterventions, ADB supported the government in implementing sector reforms and addressing \ninstitutional issues, which improved operational efficiency and sector governance.11 However, \n                                                \n5  Currently, the fund size is $900 million equivalent, all of which has been committed for use by 2021.  \n6  BAPEX. 2015.

Manila. \n11  Sector Assessment (Summary): Natural Gas (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "3 \ngas pricing reform has lagged because of the urgency to combat the country\u2019s energy crisis. \nThe expected outcome of the covenants on gas pricing in the ongoing ADB loans can be seen \nin the government effort to increase gas tariffs and establish energy security funds. \n \n10.  In  a  move  to  rationalize  gas  prices  to  align  with  equivalent  energy  prices,  the \ngovernment introduced the resource price of gas in September 2014 and also increased end-\nuser gas prices by 25% in September 2015. The government is working on a proposal to revise \nthe natural gas-pricing framework based on principles of economic efficiency, financial viability, \nand social equitability. The proposed framework envisages that market-related consumer prices \nwill be achieved in a phased manner over 7 to 8 years. Given the urgency of gas import \nincluding LNG, expected in 2018, the government is making further adjustments in domestic gas \nprices to reflect the cost of gas import. The actions under consideration include blending the \nimported  LNG  prices  with  domestically  produced  gas  to  ensure  sustainability.12  ADB  will \ncontinue  policy  dialogue  with  the  government  and  other  stakeholders  to  establish  a  cost-\nreflective pricing mechanism.  \n  \n11.  Government development plan. The government recognizes the strong link between \nenergy and economic growth, and the urgency to sustain gas supply and address inadequate \ngas-transmission infrastructure. In the Seventh Five-Year Plan, the government will promote \ngas sector development through (i) prioritized gas allocation, (ii) strengthened gas exploration, \nand (iii) rationalized gas pricing. The plan prioritizes LNG import or import through cross-border \npipelines  to  increase  gas  supply,  improve  gas  use  efficiency,  and  mobilize  private  sector \ninvestments. The proposed project forms an essential part of the government\u2019s gas sector \ndevelopment plan. \n \n12.  ADB  intervention.  ADB\u2019s  assistance,  totaling  $675 million  since  1993,  has  helped \nincrease  gas  production  capacity,  improve  the  gas  transmission  and  distribution  network, \nimprove gas operational efficiencies, strengthen the policy framework, and build the capacity of \nsector  institutions.13  The  gas  sector  reforms  supported  by  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  loans  covered \n(i) institutional and financial restructuring of gas sector companies to ensure long-term financial \nsustainability,  (ii)  transforming  gas  companies  to  diversify  ownership  involving  private  or \ninstitutional  investors,  and  (iii)  restructuring  and  unbundling  gas  sector  institutions  and \nenterprises. Given the gas sector\u2019s crucial role in promoting economic growth through expanded \npower generation, it is necessary for ADB to continue its support in this area. Reinforcing the \nnatural gas infrastructure is essential to ensure delivery reliability and efficiency, in particular for \nevacuating and transmitting imported LNG or pipeline gas in conjunction with domestic gas \nproduction. The twin effect of these initiatives will be the scaling up of gas availability for power \ngeneration to ensure energy security and support economic growth. The capacity of the national \ngas companies is not sufficiently developed to access international financing. Therefore, natural \ngas production and transmission continue to entail development partners\u2019 support. Consistent \nwith Sustainable Development Goal 7 for Energy, which seeks to ensure affordable, reliable, \nand sustainable modern energy for all, the project will expand access to reliable energy by \naddressing the prevailing gas supply constraint, supporting reservoir management designed to \nenhance energy security, and ensuring low-emission development.14  \n                                                \n12  The weighted average consumer-level price of domestic gas produced by both national gas companies and \ninternational oil companies is $2.17/cubic meter. The consumer-level price of regasified, imported LNG when \nblended with national gas would be $4.35/cubic meter.    \n13  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n14 Government  of  Bangladesh,  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forest.  2015.  Intended  Nationally  Determined \nContributions. Dhaka. \n ", "4 \n \n13.  The proposed project is an essential component of the Seventh Five-Year Plan to ease \nthe country\u2019s energy crisis and accelerate economic growth and is aligned with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for Bangladesh, 2016\u20132020 and its country operations business plan for \nBangladesh, 2017\u20132019.15 The ongoing ADB-supported gas projects experienced delays in \nachieving targets because of procurement difficulties and institutional weaknesses. Lessons \nlearned from these operations have been taken into account in the proposed project. ADB\u2019s \nintroduction of advance action based on an agreed procurement plan and provision of training \nfor executing agencies personnel in procurement, financial management, and reporting and \nmonitoring will help improve executing agencies\u2019 knowledge of ADB procedures and guidelines, \nand ensure timely project implementation. \n \n14.  Project features. Following the government\u2019s request, the proposed project will help \nimprove gas production efficiency to maximize recovery from the Titas gas field, the country\u2019s \nlargest producing gas field, and to maintain the current level of production at required delivery \npressure to the gas transmission system. Titas gas field has been producing gas since 1968, \nand wellhead pressure has declined from about 3,000 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) to \nan average of 1,250 psig. This is expected to reduce to below the 1,000 psig threshold by 2019. \nBangladesh Gas Fields Company Limited (BGFCL) is installing wellhead gas compressors at \nTitas  gas  field  location  A  to  ensure  smooth  gas  production  at  the  current  level.  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency has also provided support in installing wellhead compressors \nat location C of Titas gas field and of Narsingdi gas field. After the installation of wellhead \ncompressors, an additional 1.0 TCF of gas will be produced from Titas gas field, which has a \nremaining reserve of 2.5 TCF. \n \n15.  The initial 500 MMCFD of LNG imported and regasified at the floating storage and \nregasification unit will be transported from Maheshkhali to Anwara by a 30-in transmission \npipeline being constructed by Gas Transmission Company Limited (GTCL) to connect with the \nexisting 300 psig ring main gas pipeline around Chittagong. The regasified LNG will be partially \nconsumed in the Chittagong area, and the balance will be transmitted through the existing 24-in \ntransmission pipeline to meet gas demand in other parts of the country. Transmitting imported \nLNG or pipeline gas into the national network will necessitate constructing a 181 km, 36-in \nparallel gas transmission pipeline from Chittagong through Feni to Bakhrabad. The proposed \npipeline will constitute a loop between Chittagong and Bakhrabad and overcome the 24-in \npipeline\u2019s capacity limitation, which will ensure a dependable and reliable gas transmission \nnetwork, and  increase operational flexibility and supply integrity. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The project impact will be increased energy sector contribution to sustainable economic \ngrowth,  which  aligns  with the government\u2019s  Seventh  Five-Year  Plan. The  outcome  will  be \nimproved efficiency in gas production and expanded gas transmission pipeline capacity.  \nC.  Outputs \n17.  The project comprises two outputs: (i) increased and sustained wellhead gas delivery \npressure at location A of Titas gas field  by installing seven wellhead gas compressors to \nmaintain  the  current  gas  production  level  to  the  gas  transmission  pipeline  system;  and \n(ii) expanded capacity of Chittagong\u2013Feni\u2013Bakhrabad gas transmission pipeline by constructing \n                                                \n15  ADB. 2016.

Project-related procurement will be carried out following \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). As the project will be \njointly financed by ADB and AIIB, universal procurement will be applied to works, goods, and \nconsulting services to be financed under the project.19   \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n25.  Technical due diligence of the project focused on reviewing feasibility of the technical \nsolutions, investment plan, and operating cost structure. The executing agencies carried out the \ndetailed designs for their respective project components to address their specific needs. BGFCL \nintends  to  optimize  natural  gas  production  at  location  A  of  Titas  gas  field.  Installing  gas \ncompressors will boost wellhead pressure to sustain current production levels from the wells to \nthe gas transmission network, and allow optimum condensate recovery. The proposed design \nand technology are similar to BGFCL\u2019s existing compressor installation at Bakhrabad gas field.   \n26.  GTCL intends to increase gas supply in the national network and the Chittagong area \nthrough imported LNG or pipeline gas. The construction of the Chittagong\u2013Feni\u2013Bakhrabad \npipeline will enable GTCL to meet Chittagong\u2019s gas demand and transmit additional gas to the \nnational network. The pipeline design was prepared based on international codes and practices \nand in compliance with Bangladesh Natural Gas Safety Rule (1991). \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n27.  The project\u2019s economic analysis has been carried out with non-incremental benefits and \ncosts in economic prices estimated and compared over the project\u2019s life. All costs and benefits \nwere expressed in mid-2016 constant prices. Given the uncertainty in the global energy market, \nthe sensitivity analysis tested for the impact of crude oil price changes on the prices of both \nLNG and liquid fuel alternatives. A long-run crude oil real price of $50/barrel was used as the \nbase case; however, the impact of a lower oil price scenario ($30/barrel) and a higher price \nscenario ($70/barrel) was also tested. The base case price for LNG was assumed at $8/million \nBritish thermal unit. The economic analysis was conducted from both the national and global \nperspective. In the base case, the project as whole has an economic internal rate of return of \n19%  from  a  national  perspective  and  25%  when  global  gains  in  terms  of  carbon  dioxide \nemissions reduction are added to the national gains.20  \n28.  All  financial  benefits  and  costs  were  expressed  in  mid-2016  constant  prices.  The \nproject\u2019s financial viability was assessed by comparing the weighted average cost of capital in \nreal  terms  to  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR).  The  project\u2019s  overall  FIRR  was \nestimated at 2.93%, which exceeded the estimated weighted average cost of capital (1.22%), \nindicating  the  project\u2019s  financial  viability,  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  regulator  will \nincrease the wheeling charge for GTCL as petitioned.21 While the FIRR is not sensitive to other \nadverse movements in the underlying assumptions, it will fall below the weighted average cost \nof capital if the wheeling charge is not adequately increased.  \n                                                \n19 ADB. 2015.

Governance \n29.  Financial management. Financial management assessments have been carried out for \nBGFCL and GTCL. Both executing agencies have experience implementing externally funded \nprojects. BGFCL and GTCL have been the recipients of ADB financing, have implemented ADB \nprojects,  and  are  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s  project  accounting,  auditing,  and  disbursement \nrequirements. The assessments indicated that financial management risks of both BGFCL and \nGTCL are moderate. A financial management action plan has been prepared, recommending \nthe executing agencies further strengthen their internal audit and information systems.  \n30.  Procurement.  Procurement  capacity  assessments  indicated  that  both  executing \nagencies  have  experience  handling the  procurement  of  works, goods,  and  services  under \ndonor-funded  as  well  as  government-funded  projects  and  are  familiar  with  ADB  bidding \nguidelines and procedures. The project\u2019s overall rating of procurement risk is moderate. Risk \nmitigation measures made to ensure timely and smooth project implementation have included \nproviding continuous training to project implementation unit staff by ADB to strengthen their \nprocurement capacities, and preparing master bidding documents by executing agencies for \nsimilar packages to enable ADB\u2019s quick review and approval.  \n31.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government, BGFCL, and GTCL. The specific policy requirements \nand  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project  administration  manual.22  ADB \nreserves the right to review and examine, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive project-related practices under the project. Relevant provisions \nof the Anticorruption Policy will be included in the loan agreement and the bidding documents.  \nD.  Poverty and Social \n32.  The project is designed to improve gas supply reliability. Industries will benefit from the \nreliable  gas  supply  by  creating  more  economic  opportunities.  People,  including  the  poor, \nvulnerable consumers, and women, will benefit through increased job opportunities for skilled \nand unskilled labor during construction and beyond. Using cleaner energy will also improve \nurban and rural air quality, people\u2019s health, living conditions, and quality of life.  \nE.  Safeguards \n33.  The  project\u2019s  environmental  categorization  is  B  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009), as potential negative environmental impacts, including dust and noise, will be \ntemporary and reversible, and can be managed through appropriate engineering, design, and \nhealth  and  safety  measures.  BGFCL  and  GTCL  have  prepared  initial  environmental \nexaminations (IEEs) of their respective components based on the analysis of data collected \nthrough sampling, reviews of available reports, discussions with stakeholders, and field visits to \nthe project area.23 All construction impacts and those associated with the operation of the \nproject  and  associated  facilities,  including  occupational  and  safety  hazards,  were  also \nconsidered  in  the  IEEs,  which  were  uploaded  on  the  ADB  website  in  August  2016.  The \nenvironmental  management  plans  included  in  the  IEEs  are  sufficient  to  mitigate  potential \nimpacts.  The  Bangladesh  Department  of  Environment  is  expected  to  accord  the  required \nenvironmental clearances for the project before construction begins in 2017.

If any unanticipated environmental \nimpacts are identified during implementation, BGFCL and GTCL will update the IEEs and revise \nthe environmental management plan accordingly. \n  \n34.  Due diligence was undertaken, which included an environmental audit of the existing \nTitas  gas  field  facilities  and  three  associated  facilities:  the  Maheshkhali\u2013Anwara  gas \ntransmission  pipeline,  GTCL\u2019s  Anwara\u2013Faujdarhat  transmission  pipeline,  and  the  private \nsector\u2019s LNG terminal at Maheshkhali. All the three associated facilities are under construction \nand scheduled for completion by 2018. These facilities will supply the gas, which would not be \notherwise available, into the project\u2019s transmission pipeline. Following Bangladesh\u2019s applicable \nnational laws and regulations, GTCL prepared environmental impact assessments\u2014including \nenvironmental  management  plans  for  these  associated  facilities  to  mitigate  potential \nenvironmental  impacts.  The  environmental  assessments  are  generally  in  line  with  ADB's \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  government  will  ensure  the  design,  construction, \nimplementation, and operation of the associated facilities comply with all applicable laws and \nregulations on environment, health, and safety.  \n   \n35.  The project is classified as A for involuntary resettlement. The gas transmission pipeline \nroute has been carefully designed to minimize land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. \nThe gas transmission pipeline\u2019s right-of-way is 8 meters wide, and about 148.8 hectares of \nprivate land will be permanently acquired for the pipeline and related facilities. The project is \nexpected to affect 1,382 households and 5,693 persons. Additionally, 15 meters of right-of-way \nwill be used on a temporary basis during construction as requisition (temporarily occupied) area; \nthe area\u2019s size is 271 hectares. Social surveys and consultations were undertaken following \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The resettlement plan was prepared and disclosed on \nADB\u2019s website in August 2016. Budgetary provisions are in place to compensate affected \npeople including non-titleholders in a timely manner for their losses. GTCL and an external \nmonitoring  agency  will  supervise  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan,  and  monitoring \nreports will be submitted to ADB semiannually. The project categorization for indigenous people \nis C. According to social assessments, no indigenous peoples are expected to be affected by \nthe project. Thus, preparation of an indigenous peoples plan is not required. \n \n36.  Climate change impact.  The main climate impact on the project is the increasing risks \nof hydrometeorological hazards. The executing agency will monitor and maintain the depth of \ncover of pipelines through visual inspections, including corrosion protection and maintenance of \nright-of-way. The replacement of alternate fuels by natural gas supplied from the project will \nresult in a reduction of 703,522 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year from 2021 to 2031.   \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n37.  The project\u2019s integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major \nrisks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.24  \n   \n                                                \n24  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nImport  of  LNG  or  pipeline  gas  does  not  materialize,  Petrobangla  has  signed  the  FSRU  terminal  use \naffecting full use of the transmission pipeline in the short  agreement  with  the  concerned  private  investor. \nterm.
