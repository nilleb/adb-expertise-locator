The  Project  will  support  the  Government\u2019s\npolicy  reform  initiatives  by  pilot-testing  modifications  in  the\nState  procurement  system \nfor  cotton  and  wheat,\nstrengthening  rural  institutions  to  support  private  farming,\nand rehabilitating infrastructure to increase crop productivity,\nwith  a  view  to  improving  farm  income  in  the  short  run  and\nsustaining  agricultural  development  in  the  long  run.  The\nProject  will  substantially  reduce  the  State  procurement\nburden  on  farmers,  strengthen  the  newly  established  rural\nbusiness  advisory  centers  (RBACs),  establish  water  users\u2019\nassociations  (WUAs),  rehabilitate  37,000  hectares  (ha)  of\nirrigation  and  drainage  systems,  and  provide \nfarm\nmachinery  services.  The  Project\u2019s  experiences  in  policy\nreform  and  institutional  strengthening  are  expected  to  be\nreplicated nationwide.\n\nClassification\n\nEconomic Growth\nEnvironmental Protection\n\nEnvironmental Assessment\n\nCategory  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination  was\nundertaken  which  indicated  that  the  Project  will  have  no\nmajor  adverse  environmental  impacts  since  most  of  the\ncomponents comprise rehabilitation works.\n\nRationale\n\nUzbekistan  has  experienced  continuing  decline  in  cotton\nproduction  in  recent  years.  This  has  seriously  affected  the\ncountry\u2019s balance of payments, resulted in widespread farm\nlosses,  and  caused  serious  social  and  environmental\nproblems.  The  deterioration  of  the  irrigation  and  drainage\nsystems  and  degradation  of \nfarmland  have  affected\nagricultural  production  in  the  country.  The  Government\ninitiated  a  reform  package  in  1999  to  promote  farm\nincrease  State  procurement  prices,  and\nrestructuring, \nreduce  farm  losses.  These  measures  have  significantly\nimproved  the  farms\u2019  financial  status  in  the  short  run.\nPursuant  to  policy  dialogue  with  ADB,  the  Government  in\nMay 2001 introduced major policy reforms in Ak Altin Rayon\nby  replacing  the  production  target  with  much  reduced\nprocurement  quota  for  cotton  and  wheat,  and  abolishing\n\n\fii\n\njoint  responsibility  for  fulfilling  the  procurement  quota.  With\nthese  reforms,  the  farmers  now  have  better  prospects  to\nsustain  their  operations  if  the  remaining  constraints  are\naddressed  in  an  urgent  manner.  By  providing  institutional\nsupport \nthe\ndeteriorated irrigation and drainage systems, the Project will\ncontribute to a financially viable and sustainable agriculture,\nand  substantially  improve  the  living  standards  of  about\n50,400 beneficiaries in the Project area.\n\nfarming  and \n\nrehabilitating \n\nfor  private \n\nThe  Project  will  promote  agricultural  development  on  a\nsustainable  basis.  The  primary  objective  is  to  improve\nagricultural  performance  and  increase  farm  income  in  Ak\nAltin  district;  the  secondary  objective  is  environmental\nprotection.  The  Project  will  comprise  four  components:  (i)\n(ii)\ninstitutional  support,  monitoring,  and  evaluation; \nrehabilitation of the irrigation and drainage systems; (iii) farm\nmachinery services; and (iv) project management.\n\ntotal  project  cost \n\nThe \nis  estimated  at  $72.0  million\nequivalent,  composed  of  $38.7  million  in  foreign  exchange\nand $33.3 million equivalent in local currency.\n\nSource\n\nExchange Currency Total \n\n Percent\n\nForeign\n\nLocal\n\n($ million)\n\nAsian Development Bank\n\n35.2\n\n0.8\n\n36.0\n\n50.0\n\nGovernment\n\nBeneficiaries\n\n3.5\n\n0.0\n\n30.5\n\n34.0\n\n47.3\n\n2.0\n\n2.0\n\n2.7\n\nTotal\n\n38.7\n\n33.3\n\n72.0\n\n100.0\n\nThe  loan  of  $36.0  million  equivalent  from  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank's  (ADB's)  ordinary  capital  resources  will\nhave a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years,\nwith interest calculated in accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based\nvariable  lending  rate  system  for  US  dollar  loans,  an  annual\ncommitment charge of 0.75 percent, and a front-end fee of 1\npercent.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nLoan Amount and Terms\n\n  Period of Utilization\n\nUntil 31 March 2007\n\n\fExecuting Agency\n\nMinistry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR)\n\niii\n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nA  high-level  project  steering  committee  chaired  by  the\nDeputy  Prime  Minister \nin  charge  of  Ministry  of\nMacroeconomics  and  Statistics,  and  an  interministerial\nworking group have been established to address issues that\nneed interagency coordination. A deputy minister of MAWR\nhas  been  designated  as  project  director  to  oversee  project\nimplementation.  The  Rural  Restructuring  Agency  (RRA)\nunder MAWR will be responsible for project implementation.\nA project management office (PMO) has been established to\nmanage  day-to-day  project  implementation,  with  a  project\nsite  office  (PSO)  in  Ak  Altin  to  supervise  field  activities.  A\ndistrict  consultation  committee  comprising  beneficiary\nrepresentatives  will  monitor  project  implementation  and\nliaise with the PSO.\n\nThe  Project  will  procure  machinery,  equipment,  civil  works,\nservices,  as  well  as  vehicles,  office  equipment,  and\nmaterials. All procurement will be undertaken in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\n\nThe Project will provide for 263 person-months of consulting\nservices  (65  international  and  198  domestic)  to  assist  the\nPMO  and  PSO  in  (i)  design,  monitoring  and  evaluation  of\npilot  farms;  (ii)  carrying  out  surveys  and  investigations,\npreparing  and \nreviewing  designs,  and  supervising\nconstruction of on-farm and interfarm irrigation and drainage\nfacilities;  and  (iii)  project  management.  The  consulting\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nservices  will  be  engaged \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements satisfactory to the ADB for the engagement of\ndomestic consultants.\n\n30 September 2006\n\nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  about  50,400  people  or\n9,640  families  in  the  Project  area;  most  of  them  are  farm\nworkers  and  their  families  on  the  large  cooperative  farms\nthat  have  incurred  losses,  as  well  as  private  farmers  and\nother  rural  residents.  Over  50  percent  of  the  potential\nbeneficiaries  are  women.  The  Project  is  expected  to\nincrease  cotton  yield  from  the  current  (year  2000)  1.59  ton\n(t)/ha to 3 t/ha, and wheat yield from 2.19 t/ha to 3.7 t/ha in\neight  years.  With  increased  crop  yields,  farm  income  is\nexpected  to  double  in  eight  years.  The  increased  crop\n\nProcurement\n\nConsulting Services\n\nEstimated Project\n   Completion Date\n\nProject Benefits and\n\n   Beneficiaries\n\n\fiv\n\nproduction will, in turn, increase the demand for farm labor,\nespecially during the cotton harvest season.

A\nReconnaissance  Mission  visited  the  country  in  September  1998,  followed  by  a  Fact-Finding\nMission  during  November-December  1998,  a  Follow-up  Fact-Finding  Mission  during  August-\nSeptember  1999,  an  Appraisal  Mission  in  November  1999,  and  Follow-up  Missions  in  October\n2000  and  May  2001.2  The  lengthy  period  for  project  processing  reflects  the  intensive  policy\ndialogue with the Government on proposed policy reforms under the Project, and the time needed\nfor  the  Government\u2019s  internal  deliberations  on  the  policy  issues.  This  report  is  based  on  the\nconsultants\u2019  studies,  the  findings  of  the  missions,  and  discussions  with  the  national  and  local\ngovernment agencies concerned as well as farmers in the Project area. The Project framework is\ngiven in Appendix 1.\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nThe Agriculture Sector\n\n1. \n\nMacroeconomic Context\n\n3. \nFollowing  independence  in  1991,  Uzbekistan  embarked  on  transition  from  a  command\neconomy  to  a  market  system,  and  adopted  a  gradual  approach  with  the  State  playing  a  central\nrole  in  managing  the  transition.  This  gradual  approach  performed  relatively  well  in  maintaining\npolitical  and  social  stability,  and  the  Uzbek  Government  managed  to  avoid  the  prolonged\nrecessions  encountered  by  the  neighboring  Central  Asian  republics  (CARs),  where  social\ndislocation due to rising poverty and internal conflicts occurred.\n\nHowever, the slow pace of the transition has delayed the much-needed structural reforms\n4. \nin major sectors of the economy. The State continues to be heavily involved in price control and\nmarket  monopoly.  Furthermore,  prompted  by  a  poor  cotton  harvest  in  late  1996,  which  brought\nsevere pressures on the country\u2019s balance of payments, the Government, after a gradual lowering\nof  trade  barriers  during  1995-1996,  introduced  a  number  of  administrative  measures  to  control\nimports  in  late  1996  and  1997.  Import  restrictions  included  mandatory  registration  of  import\ncontracts with the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and obligation for importing enterprises\nto  obtain  an  import  license  from  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Economic  Relations  and  a  foreign\n\n                                                \n1 TA 2798-UZB: Agriculture Sector Development Project, for $1,075,000, approved on 19 May 1997.\n2 The Appraisal Mission comprised E.Q. Ye, Project Economist/Mission Leader; M.A. Malik, Senior Project Specialist;\nS. T. Qadri, Senior Environmental Specialist; G.N. Bestari, Project Economist; V.L. You, Counsel; and S. Khan, Farm\nMachinery  Specialist/Staff  Consultant.  M.  A.  Malik,  Senior  Project  Specialist/Mission  Leader  conducted  the  first\nFollow-up Appraisal Mission. The second Follow-up Mission comprised M. A. Malik, Senior Project Specialist/Mission\nLeader;  Tumurdavaa  Bayarsaihan,  Project  Economist;  and  Rustam  Abdukayumov,  Portfolio  Management  Officer,\nADB Uzbekistan Resident Mission.\n\n\f2\n\nexchange license from the Central Bank of Uzbekistan. All import licenses are granted selectively.\nOther restrictive measures that have directly affected foreign trade include (i) centralized export of\ngold  and  cotton,  (ii)  foreign  exchange  surrender  requirements  for  exports,  (iii)  import  quotas  for\nbasic food stuff through the tender system, (iv) import tariffs and excise duties set at levels higher\nthan the international norm, and (v) the overvalued official exchange rate. As the policy changes\nintroduced  in  late  1996  were  not  in  accordance  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund's  standby\narrangement agreed upon in 1995, the International Monetary Fund's program was suspended in\nDecember 1996.\n\n5. \nThe tight trade and price controls discouraged export and foreign investment, weakened\nthe  economy,  and  threatened  Uzbekistan\u2019s  balance  of  payments  position.  The  Government\nrecognized the need to reassess the current policy and is engaged in a process of policy review\nand revision. The Cabinet of Ministers (COM) issued on 10 June 1999 a resolution outlining an\nextensive  program  of  policy  reform  covering  the  economic,  political,  and  social  spheres  for  the\ncountry to unify the multiple exchange rates. At present; the State procurement price of cotton is\nbased  on  export  parity  level  using  the  overvalued  official  exchange  rate;  and  the  cost  of  less\nefficient processing, handling, and transportation by various government agencies; and effectively\nrepresents an implicit taxation on farms. The unification of the exchange rates, by converting the\nofficial  exchange  rate  to  its  economic  value,  will  reduce  the  implicit  taxation  on  farms  and  bring\nsubstantial gains to the agriculture sector. In particular, export-oriented cotton production will be\npromoted.3\n\n6. \nOn  24  June  2001,  the  Government  passed  a  resolution  that  substantially  changes  the\nforeign  exchange  regime  with  effect  from  1  July  2001.  The  resolution  reduces  the  number  of\nproducts  to  be  traded  at  official  exchange  rate  and  shifts  them  to  the  commercial  or  over  the\ncounter  (OTC)  exchange  rate.  Export  earnings,  which  are  surrendered  will  be  paid  at  the  OTC\nrate, thereby increasing receipts in domestic currency terms by as much as 45 percent. Even the\nexports of cotton and gold beyond a pre-specified limit have been permitted at the OTC rate.  The\nresolution  provides  the  incentives  for  the  exporters.    Small  and  medium  enterprises  have  also\nbeen allowed to convert their cash earnings at the OTC exchange rate. While the resolution of 24\nJune  2001  represents  a  move  in  the  right  direction,  it  has  still  not  fully  addressed  the  problems\nassociated with multiple exchange rates.\n\n2. \n\nFeatures of the Sector\n\n7. \nAgriculture is the foundation of the Uzbek economy and accounts for about 28 percent of\nthe gross domestic product, 44 percent of employment, and 60 percent of export revenues. About\n56  percent  of  the  country\u2019s  24.8  million  people  live  in  the  rural  areas.  The  agriculture  sector\ncomprises 60 percent of crops and 40 percent of livestock, with cotton and wheat being the two\n\n                                                \n3  The current official exchange rate is overvalued, and is maintained for currency transactions conducted at the Uzbek\nRepublican  Currency  Exchange.  The  primary  sources  of  supply  of  foreign  exchange  at  the  Uzbek  Republican\nCurrency  Exchange  are  mandatory  sales  of  foreign  exchange  proceeds  from  cotton  and  gold  at  the  overvalued\nexchange  rate.  The  primary  uses  of  foreign  exchange  sold  through  the  Uzbek  Republican  Currency  Exchange  are\nexternal  public  debt  service  and  State-approved  imports  of  capital  and  other  goods  for  supporting  State-sponsored\nprograms  and  projects.  The  State  allows  commercial  banks  and  exchange  bureaus  to  conduct  foreign  exchange\ntransactions.  The  exchange  rates  used  in  the  commercial  market  are  formally  determined  by  market  forces,  but\nmaintained  by  the  State  at  below  the  market  clearing  level.  For  example,  the  commercial  exchange  rate  was\nSUM675/690 to $1.00 (actual, May 2001). There is a thriving curb market to cater to the demand for additional foreign\nexchange. The cash curb rate was at SUM920 to $1.00 in May 2001. The official segments of the foreign exchange\ntransactions control the bulk of the total transactions in the country. Accurate estimates of the size of the curb market\nwere difficult to obtain. The high curb rate was also influenced by transaction risks and law enforcement.\n\n\f3\n\nmajor products.4 Uzbekistan was the largest producer of cotton, fruit, and vegetables in the former\nSoviet  Union  and  is  now  the  world\u2019s  fifth  largest  cotton  producer  and  the  second  largest  cotton\nexporter after the United States, accounting for 15 percent of the global cotton trade.\n\nThe  most  salient  feature  of  Uzbek  agriculture  is  the  dominant  role  of  cotton,  which\n8. \noccupies 44 percent of the irrigated area and contributes over 40 percent of the country\u2019s export\nearnings.  At  the  macroeconomic  level,  cotton  production  in  a  particular  year  directly  affects  the\ncountry\u2019s  balance  of  payments  and  State  budget  revenues.  The  crop  is  regarded  as  a  strategic\ncommodity.  At  the  micro  level,  cotton  is  the  primary  source  of  income  of  farms.  Because  it  is\nlabor-intensive,  cotton  production  is  a  major  source  of  rural  employment,  especially  during\nweeding  and  harvesting  seasons.  These  features  make  cotton  a  critical  factor  influencing  the\ncountry\u2019s political and social stability.\n\n9. \nAnother feature of Uzbek agriculture is its reliance on irrigation, which determines the size\nof the cropping area. In Uzbekistan, all cropping area is irrigated, as the continental climate and\nthe  concentration  of  rainfall  in  the  winter  months  make  irrigation  an  absolute  necessity  for  crop\nproduction.  The  country\u2019s  massive  irrigation  systems  were  expanded  during  the  1960s-1980s\nunder  the  central  planning  system  when  the  State  financed  all  investment  costs  and  was\nresponsible for operation and maintenance (O&M) of all irrigation and drainage systems.\n\n3. \n\nSector Performance\n\n10. \nThe  most  critical  issue  in  agriculture  is  the  trend  of  declining  cotton  production  in  recent\nyears. Nationwide, cotton outputs declined by over 22 percent from 4.6 million metric tons (t) in\n1991 to 3.6 million t in 2000. In 1998, cotton production was only 3.2 million t, the lowest in 20\nyears.  While  a  part  of  the  decline  was  attributed  to  the  shift  of  about  12  percent  cotton  area  to\ngrain  production  following  the  Government\u2019s  policy  of  grain  self-sufficiency,5  a  more  worrisome\nconcern was falling crop productivity. Nationwide, cotton yield declined from about 3 t per hectare\n(ha) in the 1980s to 2.7 t/ha in 1991, and further to 2.2 t/ha in 2000. The average cotton yield was\nlowest  at  2.1  t/ha  in  1998.  The  declining  cotton  production  led  to  widespread  farm  losses  and\naccumulated farm debts, which impaired the capacity of farms to pay cash wages regularly to their\nworkers, and the ability of the local communities to pay for social services. As a result, the living\nstandards of farm workers and social services for rural residents deteriorated.\n\n11. \nThe poor performance of agriculture was attributed to four basic factors: (i) poor producer\nincentives because of the low output prices fixed under a State order system for cotton and wheat\nprocurement,  largely  due  to  the  overvalued  official  exchange  rate  (para.  5);  (ii)  excessive  State\ninterventions  in  farm  operations,  especially  the  mandatory  fulfillment  of  production  targets  that\ncontrolled  the  entire  cotton  and  wheat  production  of  farms;  (iii)  deterioration  of  irrigation  and\ndrainage systems that led to rising groundwater tables, accelerated soil salinity, and falling crop\nyields; and (iv) lack of timely access to farm machinery services, which delayed farm operations\nand led to low crop yields and poor product quality. In particular, the continued deterioration of the\nirrigation  and  drainage  systems,  the  degraded  farmland,  and  wasted  water  (one  of  the  most\n                                                \n4  Uzbekistan has a comparative advantage in cotton production. Its cotton yield is the second highest (after the People's\nRepublic  of  China)  among  the  top  five  cotton  producers  in  the  world  (the  People's  Republic  of  China,  USA,  India,\nPakistan,  and  Uzbekistan;  statistics  from  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization,  United  Nations,  1990-1999).\nEconomic  analysis  shows  that  cotton  production  gives  the  highest  economic  return  among  all  crops  in  the  project\narea.  While  wheat  production  in  Uzbekistan  does  not  have  economic  returns  as  high  as  those  from  cotton,  the\nGovernment considers it politically important to ensure food security through domestic grain production. An important\nfactor  underlying  the  desire  for  grain  self-sufficiency  is  the  landlocked  geography  of  the  country  amid  the  political\ninstability in the region.\n\n5 The total cotton area was reduced from 1.7 million ha in 1991 to 1.5 million ha in 1998 and to 1.45 million ha in 2000.\n\n\f4\n\nvaluable  resources  in  the  country)  have  caused  serious  environmental  concerns,  directly\nthreatening the country\u2019s long-term base for agricultural development.6\n\n4. \n\nPolicy Reforms\n\n12. \nSince  independence  in  1991,  the  Government  has  initiated  reforms  in  both  farm\nprivatization and market liberalization to transform agriculture to a market-based system. Reforms\nin  farm  privatization  started  with  an  increase  of  household  plots  allocated  to  farm  employees,\nwhich  immediately  led  to  a  significant  increase  in  household  production  and  productivity.\nConstituting  about  10  percent  of  the  country\u2019s  irrigated  cropland,  these  household  plots  now\nproduce most of the country\u2019s vegetables, fruits, meat, and dairy products. The State farms were\ntransformed into collective farms, which were later converted into cooperative farms. However, no\nreal changes occurred in farm management and the incentive structure on these farms, most of\nwhich  were  still  led  by  the  same  directors,  were  incurring  losses,  and  were  a  heavy  financial\nburden to the State budget.\n\nRecognizing  these  problems,  the  Government  launched  a  nationwide  program  of  farm\n13. \nrestructuring  in  1998-1999  to  break  down  the  inefficient  cooperative  farms.  Under  the  program,\nthe large cooperative farms are being transformed into shirkats (restructured private farms) with\nmeasures to improve farm management and the incentive structure. On a typical shirkat, assets\nare  assessed  and  valued,  and  members  of  the  farm  are  given  shares  of  the  assets.  A  family\ncontract  system  has  been  introduced,  with  farm  workers\u2019  rights  and  obligations  tied  to  a\ndemarcated  piece  of  land.  Under  the  family  contract  system,  a  farm  worker  is  responsible  for\nproducing a certain amount of outputs using a fixed amount of inputs, and the farm is responsible\nfor  input  purchase,  distribution,  and  output  marketing.  The  system  has  demonstrated  its  initial\nimpacts  in  promoting  farm  workers\u2019  incentive,  and  the  Government  plans  to  transform  all\nremaining  cooperative  farms  into  shirkats.7  While  farm  workers  on  such  farms  now  have  better\nincentives for farm production, they are still under excessive State regulations, particularly by the\nmandatory State procurement for cotton and wheat (paras. 15-17).\n\n14. \nThe Government has demonstrated a clear intention to promote private farming. Four laws\npassed in 1998 created a legal basis for private farm operations, including a long-term land lease\npermit  to  individuals  who  wish  to  establish  private  farms  (para.  39).  Incentive  measures  were\nintroduced,  including  a  three-year  tax  break  to  newly  established  private  farms.  To  support  the\nsmall  private  farms,  the  Government  issued  a  resolution  in  1998  to  establish  a  rural  business\nadvisory center (RBAC) in every oblast (province) and rayon (district) to provide farm extension\nservices.  An  association  of  private  farmers  was  also  established  with  offices  at  the  national,\nprovince,  and  district  levels.  Another  Government  resolution  issued  in  1999  promoted  private\nmachinery services, with a view to addressing the private farms\u2019 lack of access to farm machinery\nservices  and  promoting  market  competition  in  farm  input  supply  and  machinery  services.\nHowever,  the  low  profit  in  cotton  and  wheat  production  and  the  widespread  farm  losses,  in\nconjunction with the strict State control on trade and foreign currency, discouraged private sector\n\n                                                \n6    The  most  critical  environmental  concern  in  Uzbek  agriculture  is  not  land  contamination  with  chemicals,  which  has\nbeen mitigated as the application of pesticide has been sharply reduced since 1991. According to the Uzbek National\nEnvironmental  Action  Plan,  the  deterioration  of  the  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  is  the  primary  cause  of  land\ndegradation  in  the  country.  A  large  amount  of  water  leakage  from  the  deteriorated  irrigation  system,  in  conjunction\nwith  poor  water  use practice, has  led  to  progressive  salinity  in  the  soil.  Discharges  from  the  drainage  system  have\nfurther affected fishery in the downstream areas such as Arnasai lake system.\n\n7  It is reported that about 30-40 percent of all cooperative farms in the Fergana Valley, the richest and most densely\n\npopulated area, have been restructured into private farms.\n\n\f5\n\nengagement  in  farm  services  industries.  The  RBACs  also  lacked  necessary  capacity  to  provide\nmeaningful business advisory and extension services to private farms.\n\n15. \nReforms  in  market  liberalization  started  in  the  less  strategic  subsectors  such  as\nvegetables, fruits, and livestock products. The mandatory State procurement (the State order) for\nthese products was abolished, and their prices are now set by market forces. The only agricultural\nproducts that are still subject to the State order are cotton and wheat, where the coverage of the\nState order was reduced from 100 percent to 30 and 25 percent of the production target for cotton\nand  wheat,  respectively.  However,  the  mandatory  requirement  to  fulfill  the  production  targets\njointly by farms restricted the actual implementation of this policy.8 Since most farms (especially\nthe  large  cooperative  farms)  could  not  fulfil  their  production  targets,  they  ended  up  selling  100\npercent of their cotton and wheat to the State at the fixed prices.\n\n16. \nUp to the cropping year 2000, all cotton was procured through Khlopkoprom, a State joint\nstock company which has, throughout the country, processing facilities for cotton including drying,\ncleaning,  grading,  ginning,  certifying,  and  packing.  The  processed  cotton  was  sold  to  foreign\ntraders  through  local  private  trading  firms  registered  with  the  Ministry  of  External  Economic\nRelations.  These  local  private  traders  handled  cotton  export  and  were  obliged  to  surrender  all\nforeign exchange earnings to the Government at the official exchange rate.\n\nPolicy  reforms  in  the  cotton  subsector  have  been  particularly  slow.  Cotton  farmers\n17. \ncontinued to suffer from excessive State interventions, including the production targets that control\nthe entire production of farms, and the fixed procurement price that, until most recently, was below\nproduction  costs.  The  slow  pace  of  policy  reforms  in  the  cotton  subsector  reflected  the\nGovernment\u2019s deep concern about the potential impacts of cotton liberalization on the country\u2019s\npolitical and social stability, given the large shares of cotton in the country\u2019s export earnings, State\nbudget revenues, and farm income. Such concern was reinforced by the negative results of rapid\npolicy  reforms  in  some  neighboring  CARs  and  the  financial  crisis  in  the  Russian  Federation.\nThese  countries  experienced  a  severe  disruption  in  agricultural  production,  sharp  rise  in  rural\npoverty, and a chronic decline in farm income and farmers\u2019 living standards.\n\n18. \nRecognizing the negative social and environmental impact of the widespread farm losses,\nthe Government initiated a new reform package in 1999 to reduce such losses. These reforms,\ninter  alia  (i)  raised  the  State  procurement  prices  of  cotton  and  wheat  by  44  percent,  which\n\n                                                \n8  This policy required farms to first fulfill their production targets, which were, in most cases, set at the high production\nlevels  achieved  in  the  1980s  when  the  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  functioned  well.  The  quantity  of  wheat\nprocured by the State was set at 50 percent of the wheat production target, where (i) the State procurement prices\nwere applied to the first 25 percent of the production target, and (ii) a price premium of 20 percent over and above the\nprocurement  prices  was  paid  to  the  remaining  volume  purchased  by  the  State.  Although  farmers  were  free  to  sell\nwheat  in  the  domestic  markets  once  they  had  fulfilled  the  State  procurement  volume,  there  was  little  left  for  free\nmarket  sales  because  actual  wheat  production  levels  were  consistently  below  the  high  production  targets.\nConsequently, the quantities of wheat purchased by the State effectively reached 70-95 percent of the actual wheat\nproduction in the Project area. For cotton, there was no price premium. But once the production targets were fulfilled,\nfarmers could receive a financial incentive in the form of additional value derived from cotton by-products, as farmers\nwere  given  the  right  to  purchase  at  ex-factory  prices  the  cottonseed  oil  and  seed  cake  produced  out  of  the  cotton\nseeds extracted from 70 percent of the raw cotton produced. In practice, this incentive did not materialize as cotton\nproduction  targets  were  set  above  actual  production  levels.  Furthermore,  a  \u201cjoint  responsibility\u201d  in  fulfilling  the\nproduction  targets  by  farms  was  applied  to  both  large  cooperative  farms  and  small  private  farms.  The  large\ncooperative  farms  typically  had  several  hundreds  to  over  a  thousand  farm  workers,  who  were  divided  into  small\nproduction units (brigades). Even if farmers in a brigade fulfilled their production target, they had to sell 100 percent of\ntheir products to the State at the fixed procurement prices without the financial incentive if other brigades on the same\nfarm did not fulfill their production targets. Joint responsibility was later replaced by the family contract system in the\nrestructured cooperative farms (para. 13).\n\n\f6\n\nrepresented  an  18  percent  real  price  increase  after  adjustment  for  inflation,  and  brought  the\nfarmgate prices of wheat and cotton to their international import and export parity levels valued at\nthe  official  exchange  rate;9  (ii)  transferred  farmers\u2019  financial  burdens  for  maintaining  social  and\ncommunal  services  to  the  local  government  budget;  (iii)  wrote  off  farm  debts  to  the  State,  and\nrescheduled farm debts to input suppliers; and (iv) modified the taxation system to a unified land\ntax that effectively represents a tax cut for farms.\n\n19. \nThese measures significantly improved the financial status of farms, enabling them to pay\ntheir  workers  on  time  and  leading  to  improved  producer  incentives.  The  write-off  of  farm  debts\nalso reduced restrictions on farm operations, as without outstanding debts, the tax authority and\nother creditors no longer have access to farms\u2019 banking accounts, and so normal farm operations\nare possible. In conjunction with favorable climatic conditions, cotton production increased by 14\npercent  in  1999.  By  addressing  the  difficult  issue  of  the  widespread  farm  losses,  these  reforms\ncontribute to maintaining and increasing the State budget revenues in the long run.10\n\n20. \nPursuant to policy dialogue with ADB, the Government took a major step to pilot-test policy\nreforms in Ak Altin district by issuing on 2 May 2001 COM Resolution No. 201. The main features\nof  the  resolution  include  (i)  commencing  from  the  cropping  season  2001,  the  annual  state\nproduction target of 50,000 t for wheat and cotton will be replaced by a fixed procurement quota of\n17,000 t for seed cotton and 12,500 t for wheat, (ii) production above the procurement quota can\nbe  sold  at  mutually  agreed  upon  prices,  (iii)  each  agricultural  enterprise  will  be  independently\nresponsible  for  fulfilling  its  procurement  quota,  and  (iv)  a  steering  committee  would  monitor\npreparation and implementation of the Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project and the impact of\npolicy reforms introduced.\n\n21. \nThe issuance of the COM Resolution No. 201 is the first major policy reform for cotton and\nwheat  procurement.  Considering  that  the  above-quota  cotton  will  be  sold  to  private  traders  in  a\ncompetitive  environment, \nthe  more  efficient\nmanagement  by  private  traders,  has  estimated  the  price  of  above-quota  cotton  at  40  percent\nabove the State procurement price.11 These calculations indicate the price the Government may\nhave  to  offer  if  it  wants  to  procure  the  above-quota  cotton.  The  Government,  however,  has  no\nintention  of  imposing  this  price  or  compelling  farmers  to  sell  their  above-quota  cotton  to  the\nGovernment at this price.\n\ninto  consideration \n\nthe  Government, \n\ntaking \n\nThe  year  2001  cotton  harvest  in  Ak  Altin  Rayon  will  be  the  first  to  experience  the\n22. \nimplementation of the COM Resolution No. 201. It is likely to take a couple of years to develop\n\n                                                \n9 Since  the  official  exchange  rate  is  overvalued  (footnote  3),  these  prices  are  still  below  their  economic  values.  In\naddition, these include cost of less efficient processing, handling, and transportation by various Government agencies.\n10 These reforms had no significant negative impacts on the State budget. First, the price increases brought the State\ncotton  price  in  the  local  currency  to  its  international  export  parity  level  at  the  official  exchange  rate.  As  the  cotton\nmarketing  agency  received  foreign  exchange  from  the  entire  proceeds  of  cotton  sales  to  international  buyers  at\nprevailing international prices and sold foreign currency to the State at the official exchange rate, there is no loss to\nthe State budget. Second, the transfer of the social charges from farms to local government budget had no impact on\nthe State budget, for utilities such as gas and electricity would be passed on to consumers who had benefited from\nfree communal services in the past. Third, the write-off of farm debts represented more of a book transfer than a real\nreduction in State tax revenues, as most farm debts had accumulated as arrears for many years, and could not be\nfeasibly collected. Finally, the Ministry of Finance did not anticipate significant negative impacts on the State budget as\na result of the consolidation of farm taxes into a single land tax, albeit at a reduced level, as the imposition of multiple\ntaxes  on  the  loss-incurring  farms  had  resulted  in  tax  arrears,  rather  than  increased  collection  of  taxes  in  the  past.\nSimplified taxation at a reduced rate is expected to increase the effective tax collection.\n\n11 These calculations, presented by the Government, use international price of cotton converted at the official rate and\ntaking into consideration the processing, transportation, storage, insurance, other trading costs, and profit margins of\nthe local private firms.\n\n\f7\n\nproper procurement and trading procedures. Although the farmers will be free to sell their above-\nquota production to any legal trading agency, it is envisaged that during the year 2001, the above-\nquota cotton production will continue to be procured by Khlopkoprom, albeit at prices significantly\nabove the State procurement price. As farmers gain confidence and experience, they are likely to\nenter  into  contracts  directly  with  the  local  private  trading  firms  (para.  16),  paying  the  service\ncharges to Khlopkoprom for processing. In the long term, particularly if more procurement reforms\nsimilar to those implemented in Ak Altin are undertaken in other parts of the country, more trading\nfirms and processing facilities in the private sector are likely to be established, thereby creating a\nmore competitive environment.\n\n23. \nDespite the achievements mentioned above, deficiencies remain in the policy environment\nin the overall economy and in agriculture. They include (i) State interventions in farm operations,\nespecially  the  State  procurement;  (ii)  the  multiple  exchange  rate  system  and  the  overvalued\nofficial exchange rate that generate significant price distortions; and (iii) lack of market competition\nin farm input supply, machinery services, output processing, and marketing.12\n\n5. \n\nThe Project Area\n\na. \n\nGeography and Population\n\nThe Project area covers Ak Altin district, located about 120 kilometers (km) from Tashkent\n24. \non  the  Tashkent-Samarkand  road  in  the  northwestern  part  of  Syr  Darya  Province  bordering\nKazakhstan.  Ak  Altin was  established  in  1971  from  five  experimental  State  farms  during  the\ndevelopment of the Golodnaya Steppe. It has an area of about 57,400 ha, of which about 40,380\nha comprises farmland that includes about 37,000 ha of irrigated crop area.  The soils are  gray,\nsandy  loam  with  low  humus  content.  The  climate  is  extremely  continental,  with  hot  and  dry\nsummers  and  cold  winters.  Precipitation  is  low,  and  80  percent  of  the  295-millimeter  annual\nrainfall occurs between October and April. As fixed by the State, the cropping pattern in Ak Altin is\ndominated by cotton and wheat, which cover 54 percent and 37 percent, respectively, of the total\nirrigated cropland. The remaining cropland has maize, vegetables, fruits, and alfalfa.\n\n25. \nAk Altin has a population of close to 50,400, with about 9,640 families living in 14 villages.\nSardoba is the administration center. The district population is young, with 31 percent under age\n14,  61  percent  aged  14-55,  and  only  8  percent  over  age  55.  Population  density  is  about  87\npersons per square kilometer, lower than the provincial average and the over 500 in the Fergana\nValley.\n\n26.  Women  account  for  about  51  percent  of  the  population.  About  6  percent  of  them  are\npensioners  and  11  percent  have  large  families  with  five  or  more  children.  Women  tend  to  hold\njobs  mostly  in  health  care  and  education  as  well  as  seasonal  manual  work  such  as  cotton\nweeding and harvesting. Their dominance in these areas results in low wage rates for them, which\non  the  average  are  about  80  percent  of  those  of  men.  As  in  the  rest  of  the  country,  women\u2019s\nsociopolitical  status  is  formally  protected.  Basic  education  indicators  show  very  little  gender\ndiscrimination  in  primary  and  secondary  education.13  There  are  women\u2019s  committees  at  the\nnational as well as district levels. Women in the district have equal access to land, irrigation water,\nand credit (in the form of advance payments).\n\n                                                \n12 There are no specific regulations against private sector participation in farm input supply, machinery services, output\nprocessing,  and  marketing.  The  lack  of  such  participation  is  largely  due  to  the  low  profitability  of  cotton  and  wheat\nproduction (para. 14).\n\n13 See Uzbekistan: Country Operational Strategy Study, March 2000.\n\n\f8\n\n27.  While there are no official data on poverty in the district, it is estimated that about 1,200 (or\n12  percent)  of  the  9,640  families  need  social  assistance.  This  figure  is  similar  to  the  national\naverage.14 Consultations with local community leaders in Ak Altin showed that most of the poor in\nthe district were farm workers and their families on the large cooperative farms. As these farms\nincurred  losses  and  were  unable  to  pay  cash  wages  regularly,  the  farm  workers  suffered  from\ndeclining  living  standards.  The  most  vulnerable  groups  were  the  single  mothers,  single\npensioners,  disabled  persons,  and  women  with  a  large  number  of  young  children.  There  was  a\nsocial  safety  net  with  a  limited  amount  of  financial  assistance  from  the  Government  as  well  as\nformal  and  informal  social  organizations  that  helped  their  members.  However,  the  farms\u2019  poor\nfinancial status has reduced the local communities\u2019 ability to assist the most needy.\n\nb. \n\nRural Institutions and Farming Systems\n\nThe  district Hokim (chief)  is  the  head  of  the  local  administration.  He  is  appointed  by  the\n28. \nprovincial Hokim, who, in turn, is assigned by the President of the country. As a legacy of a policy\nexperiment in 1995,15 an organization called Agrofirm integrates all farms and services enterprises\nin the district, comprising 12 large cooperative farms, 165 private farms, and all input suppliers,\nprocessing enterprises, and marketing agencies. Agrofirm is responsible for distributing inputs to\nfarms, based on the cotton and wheat procurement contracts.\n\nA typical cooperative farm in the district has 3,000 ha of irrigated cropland and 700-1,000\n29. \npermanent farm workers. These workers are divided into brigades, which are the basic production\nunits. A brigade typically has four workers and 20-30 ha of irrigated land. Farmland belongs to the\nState and is leased by the cooperative farm to the brigades on an annual basis, together with the\ndistribution of procurement quota for cotton and wheat. The cooperative farm provides farm inputs\nand  machinery  services  to  the  brigades.  As  part  of  the  nationwide  farm  restructuring  program\n(para. 13), 2 of the 12 large cooperative farms of the district were restructured into private farms,\nwhere  the  family  contract  system  has  replaced  joint  responsibility  in  fulfilling  the  production\ntargets. This new policy has increased farm workers\u2019 incentives and provided a basis for further\npolicy reforms under the Project.\n\n30. \nA private farm is established by separating from a cooperative farm, on recommendation\nfrom  the  council  of  the  cooperative  farm  and  approval  by  the  district Hokim.  A  private  farm  is  a\nlegal  entity  and  has  a  land  lease  agreement  initially  for  10  years.  Like  the  cooperative  farms,\nprivate  farms  are  subject  to  the  State  order  system  for  cotton  and  wheat  procurement  and  the\nmandatory  fulfillment  of  production  targets.  A  private  farm  in  Ak  Altin  typically  has  35  ha  of\nirrigated  cropland  and  8-12  workers.  Private  farms  are  generally  not  burdened  with  heavy  fixed\ncosts  due  to  their  lean  management  structure,  and  have  flexibility  in  utilizing  seasonal  labor  to\ncomplement  their  small  workforce.  However,  these  small  farms  lack  timely  access  to  farm\nmachinery services as most of them cannot afford to buy new machinery (para. 32).\n\n31. \nAll employees of the cooperative and private farms have their own private household plots.\nWith  an  average  size  of  0.35  ha  of  irrigated  cropland,  these  small  land  plots  are  the  primary\nsource  of  fruits,  vegetables,  and  potatoes  for  family  consumption.  In  the  absence  of  the  State\n\n                                                \n14 There  is  no  officially  defined  poverty  line  in  Uzbekistan.  The  Government  identifies  people  and  families  in  need  of\nsocial assistance by a standard of having an average per capita income of 1.5 times the prevailing minimum monthly\nwage, which was SUM2,450 (or $7.1 at the official exchange rate) in May 2001. Using this criterion, the country had\n14  percent  of  people  or  11  percent  of  families  in  need  of  social  assistance  in  May  1999  (see Uzbekistan: Country\nOperational Strategy Study, March 2000).\n\n15 Ak  Altin  and  two  other  districts  were  selected  under  a  resolution  of  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  in  May  1995  for  pilot-\n\ntesting vertical integration of all agricultural activities (farms and their forward and backward linkages).\n\n\f9\n\norder  system,  private  traders  are  active  in  the  marketing  of  fruits,  vegetables,  meat,  eggs,  and\ndairy products. Wheat is also traded in the free markets, but the volume has been rather small as\nfew  farms  had  surplus  wheat  left  after  meeting  the  heavy  State  procurement  requirements  and\nfamily consumption needs.\n\n32.  Within  the  State  order  system,  farm  inputs  are  provided  at  fixed  prices  based  on\nprocurement contracts between the State Cotton Agency and farms, and are allocated to farms\nthrough Agrofirm (para. 28). Machinery services are provided by the rayon machinery park (RMP)\nas well as by the machinery parks on the 12 large cooperative farms. The RMP is a joint stock\ncompany with 35 percent of shares belonging to the State and 65 percent to the 12 cooperative\nfarms.  Recently,  the  Government  purchased  some  new  farm  machinery  for  the  RMP:  large\nplowing  tractors,  wheat  harvesters,  and  cotton  pickers.  The  services  of  the  new  machinery  are\ncharged on a commercial basis. About 90 percent of the RMP\u2019s services are for the cooperative\nfarms and only 10 percent for private farms. Services on the 12 cooperative farms are exclusively\nfor the cooperative farms because the number of farm machinery is insufficient. It is estimated that\nmachinery  on  most  private  farms  is  10-15  years  old  and  requires  frequent  and  major  repairs.\nFurthermore,  spare  parts  of  old  machinery  are  not  easily  available.  Insufficient  access  to  timely\nmachinery  services  has  led  to  frequent  delays  in  farm  operations,  especially  during  the  peak\nseasons of planting and harvesting; the result is low crop yields and poor product quality. Since\nfarm  inputs  and  machinery  services  are  financed  by  advance  payments  under  the  State\nprocurement system, rural credit plays a minimal role in cotton and wheat production.\n\n33. \nUnder the State order system, the district had an unrealistic production target of 50,000 t\neach of raw cotton and wheat, substantially higher than the district's actual production of 27.475 t\nof raw cotton and 31,239 t of wheat in 1999. These production targets were distributed among the\ncooperative and private farms. In 1997, all cooperative farms and half of the private farms failed to\nfulfill their production targets, and all cooperative farms and 28 of 30 private farms incurred losses.\nTotal farm loss amounted to SUM840 million. The farm loss increased to SUM1.13 billion in 1998\nafter a historically low cotton harvest. By the end of 1998, all cooperative farms and over half of\nthe  private  farms  had  accumulated  debts.  In  addition  to  wage  arrears,  the  farm  debts  included\ndebts  to  the  State  budget,  pension  fund,  unemployment  fund,  water  authority,  and  suppliers  of\ninputs (fuel, electricity, fertilizer, chemicals, and seed). The situation improved in 1999; of the 65\nprivate farms only 8 incurred losses. The total farm loss went down to SUM1.092 billion in 1999.\nThe situation is expected to improve further in Ak Altin district with the implementation of the policy\nreforms through COM Resolution No. 201 (para. 20).\n\nc. \n\nIssues and Constraints\n\n34. \nThe widespread farm losses have caused serious social issues, the most important being\nthe  declining  living  standards  of  the  rural  majority.  During  two  social  surveys  conducted  in  the\nProject  area  in  1997-1998,  74  percent  of  the  respondents  said  that  their  living  standards  were\nworse and 54 percent, much worse, than five years ago. As few cooperative farms had the ability\nto  pay  cash  wages  on  time,  farm  workers  had  to  rely  on  production  from  their  small  household\nplots  and  irregular  payment-in-kind  from  their  cooperative  farms.  The  widespread  farm  losses\nfurther  weakened  the  local  communities\u2019  ability  to  pay  for  social  services  and  the  cooperative\nfarms\u2019 ability to maintain the communal facilities, which had sharply deteriorated.\n\n35. \nFarm losses have also led to serious environmental concerns, as the losses restricted the\nfarms\u2019  financial  ability  to  pay  for  O&M  of  their  on-farm  irrigation  and  drainage  systems,  most  of\nwhich had not been maintained properly since the early 1990s. The farms\u2019 poor financial status\nalso  restricted  the  effective  collection  of  water  charges,  providing  little  financial  incentive  to\n\n\f10\n\nfarmers to save water. Yet the primary cause of the large amount of water wastage is the poor\nstate of all irrigation distribution facilities, resulting in insufficient water supply to end users as well\nas rising groundwater tables and accelerated soil salinity. Due to poor and deferred maintenance,\nthe drainage system is now in urgent need of rehabilitation. Of the 186 drainage wells, only 12 are\nstill functioning. The water table in about 83 percent of the Project area has risen to within the root\nzone.  As  a  result,  average  crop  yields  have  declined  to  about  half  their  level  in  the  1980s,  with\ncotton yield as low as 0.4 t/ha in the most saline areas. Some irrigated lands have been withdrawn\nfrom production due to severe salinity.\n\n36. \nThe  basic  cause  underlying  the  social  and  environmental  problems  was  the  widespread\nfarm losses, which resulted from a number of factors: (i) low output prices for cotton and wheat\nunder the State order system; (ii) high farm operational costs, especially on the large cooperative\nfarms;16 (iii) multiple and high taxes for farms; (iv) low crop yields; and (v) poor product quality and\ngrades  that  led  to  significant  price  discounts  at  the  expense  of  the  farmers.  The  recent  reforms\ninitiated by the Government (para. 18) to some extent redressed these problems. With the write-\noff  of  farm  debts,  transfer  of  the  farms\u2019  social  obligations  to  the  local  government  budget,\nreduction  of  the  tax  burden,  and  a  significant  increase  in  cotton  and  wheat  procurement  prices,\nthe  financial  status  of  farms  significantly  improved.  As  the  policy  environment  improved,  the\nnumber of private farms in the district increased from 30 in 1998 to 65 in 1999, 102 in 2000, and\n165  in  2001.  The  implementation  of  policy  reforms  (para.  20)  is  expected  to  make  a  significant\npositive impact on the performance of the agriculture sector in Ak Altin.\n\n37. \nAk  Altin  farmers  will  have  better  prospects  of  becoming  financially  sustainable  if  the\nremaining  constraints  are  addressed  in  an  urgent  manner.  These  constraints  include  (i)  the\nremaining policy restrictions, especially the State procurement for cotton and wheat; (ii) physical\nconstraints, especially the deterioration of the irrigation and drainage systems; and (iii) the lack of\nsupporting system and services including business advice, extension services, and access to farm\nmachinery  services.  It  is  estimated  that  without  the  rehabilitation  of  the  irrigation  and  drainage\nsystems, crop yields in the district will further decline to 1.0 t/ha for cotton and 1.7 t/ha for wheat\nover the next eight years. No farms will be able to sustain operations with such low crop yields.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n38. \nThe Government\u2019s current agricultural policies and plans are contained in its Program for\nStrengthening of Economic Reforms in Agriculture during 1998-2000, issued in March 1998 by the\nCOM. The objectives of the Government\u2019s sector development strategy are (i) promoting cotton\nproduction;  (ii)  achieving  grain  self-sufficiency;  and  (iii)  ensuring  rural  employment,  enhanced\nliving standards, and social stability.\n\n39. \nThe traditional mechanism of Government\u2019s support to cotton and wheat production was\nState  budget  allocations,  including  allocations  for  the  irrigation  and  drainage  systems,  advance\npayments  to  finance  working  capital  for  cotton  and  wheat  production,  and  administrative\nmeasures  to  introduce  technologies.  Without  proper  producer  incentives,  these  measures  had\nonly  limited  impacts.  To  promote  producer  incentives  and  improve  efficiency,  the  Government\nlaunched a set of reform measures (paras. 12-20). For farm privatization, four laws issued in 1998\n(Land Code, Law on Private Farm, Law on Cooperative Farm, and Law on Dekhan Farm) created\na  legal  framework  for  private  farming.17  These  laws  gave  permits  for  long-term  land  leases  to\n                                                \n16 The large cooperative farms typically have high administrative costs, excessive farm labor, and, until most recently\n\n(para. 18), heavy financial burdens for the maintenance of social and communal infrastructures.\n\n17 Dekhan  farmers  (individual  farmers)  include  operators  of  small  (less  than  10  ha)  private  farms  and  household  plot\n\nusers.\n\n\f11\n\nindividual farmers, providing a legal basis for private farming. In addition, the Government has, for\npilot testing, initiated policy reforms in Ak Altin (para. 20).\n\n40. \nPromoting  agricultural  development  is  a  central  issue  in  the  Government\u2019s  poverty\nreduction and social policy, which focuses on employment generation and social assistance to the\nmost  vulnerable  groups.  Since  the  majority  of  the  Uzbek  population  live  in  the  rural  area,  the\nGovernment emphasizes employment generation in the rural area through development of small\nenterprises.  A  number  of  programs  were  initiated  to  support  the  development  of  small  and\nmedium-size enterprises. The Government has shown great interest in microcredit development,\nincluding the creation of rural savings and credit unions.\n\n41. \nIn the irrigation and drainage subsector, the concept of water users\u2019 associations (WUAs)\nwas introduced and is supported by the Government. The Government requires farmers to be fully\nresponsible for O&M of their on-farm irrigation and drainage facilities, and repay the full costs of\nthe  State  investment  on  rehabilitating  on-farm  irrigation  and  drainage  systems.  For  interfarm\nfacilities,  the  State  will  continue  to  be  responsible  for  both  investment  and  O&M  expenses.\nAlthough water user fees have been introduced, they do not reflect the real cost of water delivery,\nand their effective collection is limited by the poor financial status of most farms.\n\n42. \nIn  May  2001,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Water  Resources  (MAWR)  prepared  a\nmedium-term  (2001-2003)  time-bound action  plan  for  economic  reforms  in  agriculture.  The  plan\nputs  special  emphasis  on  improving  the  legislative  and  regulatory  framework,  deepening\nprivatization,  improving  agricultural  financial  systems,  capacity  building,  improving  irrigation  and\ndrainage  infrastructure,  and  relaxing  Government  restrictions  on  pricing  and  state  procurement.\nThe action plan is ambitious and is unlikely to be implemented in the timeframe envisaged, but it\npoints the direction in which the Government intends the agriculture sector to go.\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n43. \nExternal assistance to agriculture has been modest. So far, a World Bank-funded Cotton\nSubsector Improvement Project, with a loan amount of $66 million approved in May 1995, is the\nsingle largest operation in this sector. The World Bank is preparing its second agricultural project,\nAgriculture  Enterprises  Restructuring  Program  (AERP)  with  an  original  design  to  pilot-test  a  full\nmarket liberalization program in five districts. After encountering difficulties, the World Bank is now\nin  the  process  of  redesigning  the  AERP  to  support  the  nationwide  farm  restructuring  program\ninitiated by the  Government. The  World Bank is also working with the Government in preparing\ntwo projects on water resources.18\n\n44. \nIn  the  agroprocessing  subsector,  the  largest  investment  is  the  ADB-financed  $50  million\nRural  Enterprises  Development  Project.19  Other  external  assistance  to  this  sector  includes  the\nTurkish  Exim  Bank-financed  construction  of  the  Khorezm  sugar  refinery,  with  a  loan  amount  of\n$25 million. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has financed several credit\nlines aimed at supporting small and medium-size enterprises.\n\nThe  European  Union  has  provided  a  large  number  of  TA  grants  through  the  Technical\n45. \nAssistance  for  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  program.  Major  activities  of  the\n\n                                                \n18 These are (i) Karshi Pumping Cascade Rehabilitation Project, and (ii) Amudaria River Basin Drainage Project.\n19 Loan 1504-UZB: Rural Enterprises Development Project, for $50 million, approved on 17 December 1996. The Rural\nEnterprises Development Project experienced slow disbursement in its initial years of implementation due to lack of\nqualified  subloan  borrowers  and  implementing  agencies\u2019  lack  of  experience,  but  implementation  improved  in  late\n1999.\n\n\f12\n\nTechnical Assistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States program include (i) sectoral\nsupport to private farmers, (ii) a pilot integrated development project, (iii) training and education for\nfarmers  and  allied  personnel,  (iv)  a  food  and  agriculture  policy  unit,  (v)  water  resources\nmanagement  and  agricultural  production,  (vi)  on-farm  pilot  irrigation  management,  (vii)  land\nregistration, and (viii) crop forecasting by remote sensing.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\nThe  Project  will  be  the  first  ADB  investment  in  agriculture  through  MAWR.20  ADB\u2019s\n46. \nagricultural  operations  in  similar  countries,  especially  the  CARs,  as  well  as  its  operational\nexperience in other sectors in Uzbekistan provided useful lessons to guide the project design and\nimplementation arrangements.\n\n47. \nADB\u2019s  operational  experience  in  agriculture  in  similar  countries,  especially  CARs,\nhighlighted the critical importance of (i) strong Government ownership of projects and commitment\nto  their  implementation,  (ii)  realistic  assessment  of  institutional  capacity  of  the  implementing\nagencies,  and  (iii)  close  monitoring  of  project  implementation.  These  lessons  have  been\nincorporated into the project design. A participatory approach was adopted in project preparation.\nGovernment officials in both the central coordination agencies (COM, Ministry of Finance [MOF],\nand Ministry of Macroeconomics and Statistics) and the Executing Agency (EA), MAWR, actively\nparticipated in developing the project design including its cost estimates. Project implementation\nstaff on both national and local levels also participated in the preparations to foster ownership of\nand  commitment  to  the  Project.  Their  capacity  was  evaluated  during  the  course  of  project\npreparations. Considering MAWR\u2019s lack of project implementation experience, the project design\nemphasizes simplicity and implementability, with adequate resources provided under the Project\nfor  institutional  development  and  capacity  building.  Mechanisms  are  provided  to  closely  monitor\nproject implementation and its social and environmental impacts (paras. 81-83).\n\nADB\u2019s  project  portfolio  in  Uzbekistan  is  relatively  young  and  many  EAs  do  not  have\n48. \nsufficient implementation experience. The 1999 Country Portfolio Review Mission identified major\nimplementation problems and the Government agreed on various corrective measures including\nearly establishment of the project implementation structure (PIS) and assignment of the PIS staff.\nThe  Mission  also  recommended  ADB\u2019s  close  implementation  supervision  through  various\nmissions; and training for the counterpart staff through advisory TAs, on-the-job training, seminars\non  ADB  policies  and  procedures,  and  training  programs  for  PIS  staff.  The  Country  Portfolio\nReview  Mission  conducted  in  June  2000  reported  overall  improvement  of  the  portfolio\nmanagement.  It  was  noted  that  (i)  the  Government  and  EAs  had  taken  steps  to  enhance  the\nefficiency of project implementation, (ii) project implementation units were being maintained with\nqualified  staff  and  staff  attrition  was  minimum,  (iii)  utmost  efforts  were  being  made  to  improve\ncompliance  with  loan  and  TA  covenants,  (iv)  the  Government  was  making  necessary\narrangements  for  timely  submission  of  audited  financial  statements,  (v)  adequate  counterpart\nfunds were allocated, and (vi) the Government and the EA staff had improved their understanding\nof ADB\u2019s policies and procedures.\n\nFor Ak Altin Project, the Government has already established the PIS at both national and\n49. \ndistrict levels (paras. 78-79) and assigned key staff. Government counterpart staff worked with the\nADB  processing  missions  in  designing  the  Project  and  thus  familiarized  themselves  with  ADB\noperations.  Some  of  the  staff  also  participated  in  the  training  seminar  on  ADB  procedures  for\nconsultants selection and procurement. International consulting services will be provided to assist\n\n                                                \n20 The Executing Agency for Rural Enterprises Development Project is the National Bank of Uzbekistan.\n\n\f13\n\nthe project management office (PMO) and project site office (PSO) to establish sound operational\nsystems.  The  Government  has  given  assurances  on  timely  allocation  and  release  of  adequate\ncounterpart funds, and assignment of qualified and experienced staff to the remaining positions in\nthe PMO and PSO.\n\nE. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n50. \nADB\u2019s  operations  in  Uzbekistan  have  been  guided  by  the  country  operational  strategy\n(COS)  prepared  in  March  2000,  which  supports  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  in  transforming  the\nplanned  system  to  a  market  economy.  The  COS  involves  providing  support  for  policy  reforms,\ninstitutional  strengthening,  and  sector  investments  that  promote  growth,  improve  efficiency,  and\nrehabilitate  deteriorating  infrastructure.  The  COS  emphasizes  ADB  assistance  to  three  priority\nsectors: agriculture, infrastructure rehabilitation, and education. Agriculture is considered as key to\nthe country\u2019s long-term development and an avenue to address both the environmental and rural\npoverty issues.\n\nThe  central  goal  of  the  COS  is  to  manage  the  transition  to  an  economy  that  relies  on\n51. \nmarket-based  institutions  supporting  a  sustainable  reduction  in  poverty  and  increase  in  living\nstandards.  The  objectives  of  ADB  operations  in  Uzbekistan  include  (i)  managing  the  transition\nthrough institutional development, and (ii) fully unlocking the potential for future economic growth.\nTo support rural development, the COS calls for three avenues for ADB assistance to agriculture:\n(i) pilot projects to demonstrate the utility of sector reforms and selected investments, (ii) support\nfor rural finance institutions, and (iii) direct support to agriculture-related private sector activities.\n\nThe  COS  supports  ADB\u2019s  new  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy,  which  specifically  reflects\n52. \nthree major aspects of poverty, i.e., income poverty, poor living standards, and social exclusion.\nThe COS suggests that ADB assistance to address poverty in Uzbekistan include creating income\nopportunities  and  sustaining  social  protection  and  human  development,  especially  in  the  rural\nareas.  The  COS  also  calls  for  developing  the  rural  economy  through  pilot  projects,  related\nindustries  and  services,  and  rural  finance.  The  Project  is  fully  in  line  with  the  COS,  as  it  will\nsupport  the  transition  to  a  market  system,  rehabilitate  rural  infrastructure,  and  build  up  rural\ninstitutions.\n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n53. \nIntensive policy dialogue was conducted during project preparation at the highest level of\nthe  Government.  As  a  result,  important  aspects  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  recommendations  have  been\nincorporated  into  the  Government\u2019s  reform  package:  farm  debt  restructuring,  abolishing  joint\nresponsibility,  promoting  producer  incentives,  and  encouraging  private  farming  (paras.  13-18).\nImplementation of policy reforms in Ak Altin (para. 20) is a major focus of the Project.\n\n54. \nThe Project will pilot-test reforms in the State procurement system for cotton and wheat,\nreplacing the production targets with fixed procurement quotas. To encourage farmers to invest in\nagriculture,  the  Government  has  assured  that  it  will  not  increase  the  procurement  quotas  in  the\nfuture  even  with  substantial  yield  increases,  so  that  farmers  can  reap  the  full  returns  of  their\ninvestment  (para.  125  [i]).  These  measures  are  expected  to  substantially  increase  farmers'\nincentives  and  reduce  their  procurement  burdens.  The  free  market  sales  of  above-quota  cotton\nand wheat will bring higher returns to farmers and provide them with strong incentives to increase\nproduction.  Higher  returns  will  induce  a  demand  for  farm  inputs  and  machinery  services  on  a\ncommercial  basis,  which  will,  in  turn,  promote  private  sector  participation  in  these  services\nindustries and promote the growth of free markets.\n\n\f14\n\nThe  Project  will  open  a  window  for  ADB  to  continue  its  policy  dialogue  with  the\n55. \nGovernment, actively participate in the agriculture sector reforms, monitor the reform process, and\nprovide  policy  advice  on  a  continued  basis.  Future  policy  dialogue  will  focus  on  (i)  deepening\nprivate sector participation in cotton procurement, processing, and trade after the exchange rate\nunification (para. 5); (ii) promotion of market competition in farm input supply, machinery services,\noutput  processing,  and  marketing,  especially  when  farm  profit  increases  and  private  companies\nare interested in providing these services; and (iii) farm restructuring and privatization, especially\nwhen farming profit increases under the Project and an increasing number of farm workers want\nto separate from the large cooperative farms. Specific assurances have been obtained from the\nGovernment  to  periodically  review  (i)  the  cotton  and  wheat  procurement  policy  to  foster  and\ndevelop market competition and participation of the private sector; and (ii) the cotton and wheat\nprocurement  prices  to  ensure  that  future  price  revisions  fully  reflect  adjustments  for  annual\ninflation  and  changes  in  international  border  prices,  and  also  reflect  changes  in  the  exchange\nrates (para. 125 [iii \u2013 v]).\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n56. \nThe  continued  decline  in  cotton  production  in  Uzbekistan  in  recent  years  has  seriously\naffected the country\u2019s balance of payments and brought financial difficulties to the Government. At\nthe micro level, the declining cotton yield has resulted in widespread farm losses, leading to falling\nliving  standards  and  deteriorating  social  services  for  the  rural  majority.  Serious  environmental\nconcerns have also arisen as the poor financial status of farms restricted their ability to pay for the\nO&M of their irrigation and drainage systems. Lack of maintenance has led to deterioration of the\nirrigation systems, rising groundwater, and accelerated soil salinity. The waste of water resources\nand  degradation  of  farmland,  in  addition  to  short-term  losses,  are  constraining  agricultural\ndevelopment in the country.\n\n57. \nTo  reduce  farm  losses,  the  Government  initiated  a  reform  package  to  increase\nprocurement  prices,  reduce  farm  taxes  and  social  charges,  and  write  off  farm  debts  (para.  18).\nThe  positive  impacts  of  these  reforms  cannot  be  sustained  unless  the  remaining  sector\nconstraints  are  also  addressed  in  an  urgent  manner.  The  Project\u2014by  modifying  the  State\nprocurement  system  to  reduce  farmers\u2019  financial  burdens  and  promote  producer  incentives,\nrehabilitating  the  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  to  restore  crop  productivity,  and  providing\ninstitutional support to sustain the O&M of the systems after  rehabilitation\u2014will  complement the\nGovernment\u2019s reform efforts. The Government has also launched the nationwide program of farm\nrestructuring  with  the  intention  of  promoting  private  farming  (paras.  13-14).  However,  low  farm\nprofits  have  discouraged  private  farming  and  restricted  the  effectiveness  of  the  Government\nefforts. By doubling crop productivity, the Project will increase farming profit and thus encourage\nprivate  sector  participation  in  farming  and  farm  services  industries  (paras.  14  and  22).  The\nGovernment  has  agreed  to  pilot-test  further  policy  reforms  on  market  liberalization  under  the\nProject and has substantially (66-75 percent) reduced the mandatory State procurement of cotton\nand wheat (para. 20). The proposed reform on reducing State interventions and farmers\u2019 financial\nburdens has obtained strong support from farmers in the Project area. The Project\u2019s development\nimpacts will be maximized when its pilot experiences, if successful, are replicated nationwide.\n\n58. \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  the  sector  reforms  initiated  by  the  Government  and  enable\nADB  to  remain  engaged  in  policy  dialogue  to  promote  market-oriented  agriculture.  The  Project\nadopts  a  realistic  approach  that  focuses  on  increasing  crop  productivity  despite  the  remaining\npolicy constraints. As crop yields are expected to double in eight years after the rehabilitation of\n\n\f15\n\nthe  irrigation  and  drainage  systems,  farm  income  and  farmers\u2019  living  standards  will  rise\nsubstantially in the Project area. Improved farm profits will encourage private sector participation\nand market development. The rising cotton production will promote export earnings, improve the\ncountry\u2019s  balance  of  payments  position,  release  pressure  on  the  foreign  currency  reserve  and\nState  control  on  foreign  currency,  and  thus  provide  a  better  environment  for  macroeconomic\nreforms.  The  substantial  gains  in  crop  productivity  under  the  Project  will  demonstrate  tangible\nbenefits to convince policy makers and generate public support for further policy reforms.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n59. \nThe  Project  goal  is  to  promote  agricultural  development  on  a  sustainable  basis.  The\nprimary  objective  is  to  improve  agricultural  performance  and  increase  farm  incomes  in  Ak  Altin\ndistrict,  with  focus  on  cotton  and  wheat  production.  The  secondary  objective  is  to  protect  and\nenhance the environment by improving water management practices and land quality. Successful\nproject interventions are expected to be replicated nationwide.\n\nThe  Project  will  comprise  four  components:  (i)  institutional  support,  monitoring,  and\n60. \nevaluation; (ii) rehabilitation of the irrigation and drainage systems; (iii) farm machinery services;\nand (iv) project management.\n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Support, Monitoring, and Evaluation\n\n61. \nThe Project will strengthen the rural institutions to support agriculture sector reforms in Ak\nAltin, focusing on the newly established RBAC that will play a key role in facilitating the ongoing\nfarm restructuring, supporting private farming, and organizing and training WUAs. Support will be\nprovided  for  (i)  strengthening  RBAC,  (ii)  organizing  and  training  WUAs,  (iii)  establishing  pilot\ndemonstration farms, and (iv) establishing a monitoring and evaluation unit (MEU).\n\na. \n\nStrengthening the Rural Business Advisory Center\n\n62. \nThe RBAC in Ak Altin was established in October 1998 to facilitate farm restructuring and\nprovide extension services to farmers. However, RBAC lacks the necessary capacity to fulfill its\nresponsibilities.  The  Project  will  strengthen  RBAC  by  providing  equipment,  establishing\noperational  systems,  and  strengthening  its  staff.  RBAC  will  have  nine  full-time  staff  comprising\ndomestic experts specializing in agribusiness, farm management, finance, law, business planning,\ntraining  and  administration,  agricultural  engineering,  agronomy,  and  entomology.  A  team  of\ninternational  and  domestic  consultants  will  be  financed  under  an  associated  TA  to  assist  in\nstrengthening  RBAC.  The  consultants  will  help  RBAC  develop  its  operational  strategy  and\nmanagement systems, prepare training materials, and strengthen its staff through training courses\nand  hands-on  training.  Currently,  RBAC  is  self-financing  through  user  fees  from  farms.  It  is\nexpected  that,  with  the  establishment  of  sound  operational  systems,  development  of  training\nmaterials,  and  strengthening  of  staff  capacity,  RBAC  will  be  able  to  independently  provide  all\ntraining, and business advisory and farm extension services required by the Ak Altin farmers after\nthe Project is completed. Its operations will be sustained through user fees from its farmer clients.\n\n63. \nTo  strengthen  RBAC\u2019s  capacity  in  farm  extension  services,  the  Project  will  finance  the\ndevelopment of a program for integrated pest management (IPM).21 Local agronomists in RBAC\nwill  be  trained  in  IPM  and,  in  turn,  will  conduct  training  courses  for  farmers.  Improved  seed\n                                                \n21 IPM is a pest control approach that utilizes regular monitoring to determine if and when treatments are needed and\nemploys  physical,  mechanical,  cultural,  biological,  and  educational  methods  to  keep  pest  numbers  low.  Least-toxic\nchemicals are used as the last resort in pest control.\n\n\f16\n\nvarieties, new technologies, rational use of inputs especially agrochemicals, and better agronomic\npractices that fit the conditions of the project area will be studied and introduced as appropriate.\nThe Project will finance the preparation of training materials and conduct of training courses for\nboth trainers and the farmers.\n\nb. \n\nOrganizing and Training Water Users\u2019 Associations\n\n64. \nThe dynamics of farm restructuring implies continued changes in farm organizations in the\nProject area. The number of small private farms is likely to rise sharply as farm profits increase.\nConsequently, the existing water allocation and O&M systems will need change as many on-farm\nsystems  will  become  interfarm  facilities.  To  facilitate  the  transition,  the  Project  will  assist  in  the\nestablishment  of  WUAs.  Currently,  no  laws  or  regulations  in  Uzbekistan  specifically  relate  to\nWUAs. However, there is also no legal impediment to the establishment of a WUA. The only legal\nrequirement  is  that  a  WUA  be  registered  as  a  legal  entity  with  the  local  government.  The\nGovernment  has  agreed  to  take  necessary  actions  to  ensure  that  WUAs  can  perform  their\nfunctions:  organizing  and  training  water  users,  signing  contracts  for  water  allocation  and  O&M\nservices,  collecting  from  members  user  fees  for  O&M  activities,  introducing  water  management\nmeasures,  and  assuming  responsibility  for  O&M  of  their  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  (para.\n125[vi]).  The  legal  department  of  MWAR  will  assist  in  preparing  model  WUA  articles  of\nassociation, in consultation with the legal consultant under the associated TA.\n\n65.  WUAs will be organized on the basis of canal command areas in Ak Altin. The Project will\nstrengthen  WUAs  to  take  charge  of  water  allocation,  user  fee  collection  for  O&M,  water\nmanagement, and O&M activities. TA consultants and RBAC will facilitate WUA establishment. An\ninformation  campaign  at  the  start  of  the  Project  will  raise  farmers\u2019  awareness  of  the  need  for\nWUAs  and  their  functions.  WUA  staff  will  undergo  training  in  the  preparation  of  business  plans,\nfinancial  management,  bookkeeping,  and  procurement  of  goods  and  services  necessary  for\nmaintaining  the  water  management  systems.  WUAs  will  be  responsible  for  O&M  of  on-farm\nsystems  in  the  near  term,  and  eventually  be  capable  of  taking  responsibility  for  O&M  of  the\ninterfarm irrigation water supply and drainage systems.\n\nc. \n\nPilot Demonstration Farms\n\n66. \nTo  facilitate  the  dissemination  of  new  technologies  and  to  maximize  project  impacts,  a\nnumber of demonstration farms with a total area of about 200 ha will be established in Ak Altin.\nThese  farms  will  demonstrate  the  impacts  of  improved  seed  varieties,  optimal  use  of\nagrochemicals,  on-farm  water  and  land  management  practices  and  techniques,  IPM,  and  other\nnew  technologies  suitable  for  the  district.  The  Project  will  enter  into  agreement  with  interested\nfarms to use their lands for the demonstration purpose, setting forth the rights and responsibilities\nof the Government and the participating farmers. The Project will finance civil works, seeds, and\nagrochemicals;  the  farms  will  provide  labor,  water,  and  machinery  inputs.  An  information\ncampaign and field visits by farmers will disseminate the results of the demonstration farms. The\ndemonstration farms are expected to play a key role in promoting new technologies and contribute\nto  the  improvement  of  product  quality  and  productivity  in  the  Project  area.  The  farms  will  be\nselected pursuant to the criteria agreed upon between the Government and ADB.\n\nd. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\nAn MEU will be established to monitor the environmental and social impacts of the Project.\n67. \nThe  MEU  will  have  two  full-time  staff  specializing  in  environment  and  sociology,  and  will  be\nresponsible for (i) preparing and analyzing baseline economic, social, environmental, and health\n\n\f17\n\nconditions  in  the  Project  area;  (ii)  benefit  monitoring  during  project  implementation;  and  (iii)\nevaluating the Project\u2019s economic, social, and environmental impacts including health conditions\nin  the  Project  area.  The  MEU  will  work  with  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  specialist  of  PMO  to\ndevelop  and  maintain  a  system  for  measuring  the  Project\u2019s  outputs  and  impacts.  For\nenvironmental monitoring, the local office of the Hydrologic Amelioration Expedition (HAE) and the\nprovincial office of the State Committee for Nature Protection will collect and analyze data on the\nquality  of  irrigation  and  drainage  water,  soil  chemistry,  and  groundwater  depth  and  quality.  The\nlaboratories  of  HAE  and  State  Committee  for  Nature  Protection  will  be  equipped  to  ensure\neffective and regular environmental monitoring with specific reference to the quality of irrigation,\ndrainage,  and  municipal  water  supply.  Benchmark  data  will  be  collected  to  serve  as  baseline\ninformation to compare with data collected during and after project implementation. Environmental\nmonitoring will include a comparative analysis of water and soil samples outside the project area\nto measure the specific positive environmental impacts generated by the Project.\n\n68. \nTo monitor social impact, the MEU will (i) collect and analyze benchmark information on\neconomic  and  social  conditions,  and  public  health;  (ii)  assess  project  benefits  during  project\nimplementation;  and  (iii)  evaluate  benefits  at  project  completion.  The  participation  of  women  in\nvarious  project  activities  will  also  be  monitored.  A  socioeconomic  profile  of  the  beneficiaries\u2014\nbased on gender-disaggregated data on different social groups\u2014will be prepared at the start of\nproject implementation. The social profile will be updated at project completion, and a report will\ndescribe the project benefits and impacts on public health and farmers\u2019 living standards.\n\n2. \n\nRehabilitation of Irrigation and Drainage Systems\n\nThe Project will finance the rehabilitation of on-farm and interfarm facilities, including the\n69. \nrestoration  of  the  proper  functions  of  the  primary  open  collector  and  secondary  subsurface\ndrainage systems. Components of the irrigation system will be repaired or rebuilt as appropriate.\nNew water control and measurement structures will be built to allow proper control of the irrigation\nsupplies  to  both  small  and  large  water  users.  The  Project  will  finance  the  costs  of  rehabilitating\nand  improving  all  irrigation  and  drainage  facilities,  including  the  costs  of  surveys,  investigations,\ndesign  preparation,  as  well  as  consulting  services  for  design,  review,  construction  supervision,\nand  other  associated  costs.  The  costs  of  on-farm  improvements  will  be  recovered  from  the\nbeneficiaries.\n\n70. \nOn-farm  improvement  works  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  will  cover  irrigation,\ndrainage, and land management. The drainage infrastructure will include deepening of about 383\nkm  of  field  and  farm  drains,  cleaning  and  flushing  of  about  424  km  of  horizontal  field  drains,\nproviding  about  340  km  of  horizontal  subsurface  field  drains  in  the  vertical  drainage  area,  and\ninstalling  about  415  km  of  new  horizontal  field  drains.  The  irrigation  infrastructure  works  will\ninclude  rehabilitating  about  42  km  of  concrete  canals  with  bed  width  of  0.5  meter,  383  flume\ndistribution structures, 255 flume check structures, 255 end-flume transitions; reconstructing about\n240 km flumes of various sizes; and realigning about 128 km flumes of various sizes. The land\nmanagement works will include tertiary field-level distribution systems (pipe or canals) as well as\nland  leveling  operations,  deep  plowing,  and  remedial  subsoiling  to  break  up  plow  pans;  and\naddition of suitable soil amendments and land leveling to make salt leaching more effective.\n\n71. \nThe  detailed  design  of  on-farm  rehabilitation  work  will  be  based  on  the  results  of  close\nconsultations  with  farmer  beneficiaries.  The  Project  staff  and  consultants  will  present  design\nalternatives  to  farmer  beneficiaries,  explain  to  them  the  associated  costs  and  other  features  of\neach alternative, and assist them in selecting the most appropriate design. Before the start of on-\n\n\f18\n\nfarm rehabilitation works, farmers will enter into agreement with the Government implementation\nagency, indicating their approval of the works and readiness to repay the investment costs.\n\n72. \nInterfarm works will include (i) drainage works, comprising deepening and rehabilitation of\n75 km of interfarm collectors; and (ii) irrigation works, including rehabilitation of 10 km of concrete\ncanals and associated structures.\n\n73. \nTo ensure proper O&M of the rehabilitated irrigation and drainage systems, the Project will\nfinance  the  procurement  of  maintenance,  monitoring,  transport,  and  logistical  equipment.  The\nmaintenance equipment will be used for the upkeep of the irrigation and drainage facilities, farm\nroads,  and  for  land  leveling  of  the  irrigated  fields.  The  Project  will  also  provide  for  monitoring\nequipment for the provincial laboratories of HAE and State Committee for Nature Protection that\nwill regularly monitor the quality of irrigation, drainage, and municipal water supply and of soil. The\nO&M  equipment  procured  under  the  Project  will  be  operated  and  maintained  by  the  Rayon\nAgriculture  and  Water  Department  (RAWD),  which  will  charge  the  respective  farms  for  O&M\nservices for on-farm facilities.\n\n3. \n\nFarm Machinery Services\n\n74. \nTo  address  the  key  constraint  of  private  farms\u2019  lack  of  timely  access  to  farm  machinery\nservices, the Project will provide a set of farm machinery, together with the required civil works,\nworkshop facilities for maintenance and repair, office equipment, and training. The machinery will\nbe operated and maintained by a newly established commercial entity (the RAWD Unit) under the\nRAWD. MOF and the RAWD Unit will enter into a subsidiary loan agreement for the loan amount\nto  be  allocated  for  machinery  purchase  (para.  77).  RAWD  currently  operates  and  maintains  the\nO&M  equipment  for  the  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  in  the  district  and  has  the  necessary\nfacilities and experience for such activities. The RAWD Unit will provide farm machinery services\nto  private  farms  and  collect  service  charges  from  them.  The  charges  will  be  determined  on  a\ncommercial basis, which is the current practice in the district (para. 32). The RAWD Unit will use\nthese charges to meet O&M costs for the equipment and to repay the subsidiary loan.\n\n4. \n\nProject Management\n\n75. \nThe Project will provide staff complement and necessary vehicles, equipment, and office\nfurniture for a PMO in Tashkent and a PSO in Ak Altin. The Project will finance two international\nconsultants (a project management adviser and a procurement specialist) to assist PMO and PSO\nto  establish  their  operational  systems  comprising  a  sound  accounting,  internal  control,  and\nauditing  system  as  well  as  effective  monitoring  mechanisms.  The  consultants  will  also  provide\nhands-on  training  to  PMO  and  PSO  staff,  especially  during  the  early  stages  of  project\nimplementation.  PMO  and  PSO  staff  will  be  trained  on  project  management,  coordination  of\nproject  activities,  preparation  and  review  of  procurement  documents,  and  other  implementation\nmatters.\n\nC. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n76. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $72.0  million  equivalent,  comprising  $38.7\nmillion  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $33.3  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  The\nestimates  include  provision  for  $6.4  million  in  taxes  and  duties,  6.2  percent  of  base  costs  for\nphysical contingencies, and 7.7 percent for price contingencies. A summary of the cost estimates\nis in Table 1 and details are in Appendix 2.\n\n\f19\n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nComponent\n\nA. Base Costs\n\n1.

The\nBorrower will be the Republic of Uzbekistan. ADB financing will be about 50 percent22 of the total\nproject cost, and will cover about 91 percent of the foreign exchange costs including the front-end\nfee,  interest,  and  other  charges  during  construction,  and  $0.8  million  equivalent  of  the  local\ncurrency  costs.23  The  beneficiaries  will  contribute  about  $2.0  million  toward  project  costs  in  the\nform  of  O&M  costs  of  the  on-farm  facilities  during  project  implementation.  The  remaining  $34.0\nmillion equivalent will be provided by the Government and includes $3.5 million for indirect foreign\nexchange  expenditures.  For  the  component  for  farm  machinery  services,  a  subsidiary  loan\nagreement  in  the  amount  of  $5.3  million  will  be  entered  into  between  MOF,  on  behalf  of  the\nBorrower,  and  the  RAWD  Unit.24  Execution  and  delivery  of  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement\n\n                                                \n22 The Project was prepared substantially during 1999 and 2000, envisioning complete processing by 2000. Therefore,\nit is proposed that the cost-sharing limit applicable to the Republic of Uzbekistan in year 2000, i.e., 50 percent, be\napplied to this project.\n\n23  The  local  cost  financing  is  primarily  for  promoting  critical  capacity  building  initiatives  associated  with  (i)  the\nestablishment  of  demonstration  farms,  (ii)  provision  of  rural  business  advisory  services  and  training,  (iii)\nestablishment of alternative farm machinery services, (iv) recruitment of key domestic consultants as counterparts to\ninternational  consultants,  and  (v)  strengthening  of  project  management  and  administration.  In  total,  the  local  cost\nfinancing amounts to less than 2.2 percent of the total ADB financing of $36 million.\n\n24 The terms of subsidiary loan agreement shall not be softer than those of the ADB\u2019s loan to the Government.\n\n\facceptable to ADB will be a condition for effectiveness of the Loan Agreement.

MAWR will be the EA of the Project. A deputy minister of MAWR has been appointed as\nthe  project  director  to  oversee  project  implementation.  The  Rural  Restructuring  Agency  (RRA)\nunder MAWR has been made responsible for project implementation.25 On behalf of MAWR, the\ndirector general of RRA will have the authority to undertake financial transactions, sign contracts,\nand  endorse  financial  statements.  The  director  general  will  be  assisted  by  a  senior  financial\nadviser and a senior project management adviser on all financial and procurement matters.\n\n79. \nA  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  has  been  established  in  accordance  with  COM\nResolution No. 201 to strengthen the coordination of all matters related to the Project. The PSC is\nchaired  by  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  in  charge  of  Ministry  of  Macroeconomics  and  Statistics\n(MMS),  and  comprises  representatives  from  COM,  MAWR,  MOF,  MMS,  State  Property\nCommittee, State Tax Committee, State Committee for Land Resources, Cotton Bank, and RRA.\nAn interministerial working group (WG) was also established, with staff from COM, MOF, MMS,\nMAWR, RRA, and the Hokim of Ak Altin district. While the PSC comprises high-ranking officials\nand  is  responsible  for  policy  making,  the  WG  comprises  working-level  Government  staff  and  is\nresponsible  for  identifying  issues  that  need  interagency  coordination,  investigating  factors\nunderlying  the  issues,  and  proposing  solutions  to  the  PSC.  The  WG  worked  closely  with  ADB\nmissions on the project design. To ensure smooth implementation, the PSC and WG will continue\nto function during project implementation to handle issues that need interministerial coordination.\nThe  PSC  will  meet  quarterly  to  review  implementation  progress,  identify  issues,  and  determine\nmeasures to address the issues.\n\n80. \nThe  PMO,  established  within  RRA,  is  headed  by  a  full-time  manager,  who  will  be\nresponsible  for  the  day-to-day  tasks  relating  to  implementation.  The  PMO  manager  will  be\nassisted by two accountants, a financial specialist, a procurement specialist, an irrigation/drainage\nengineer,  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  specialist,  and  support  staff  including  administrative\nassistants, translators/interpreters, and secretaries.\n\n                                                \n25  RRA  was  established  in  accordance  with  the  COM  Resolution  No.  356  dated  19  August  1998  to  facilitate  the\n\npreparation of the World Bank-financed AERP and the ADB\u2019s Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project.\n\n\f21\n\nA PSO was established in Ak Altin to take charge of the day-to-day activities at the field\n81. \nlevel.  The  PSO  is  headed  by  a  site  manager  who  will  be  supported  by  an  accountant,  two\nirrigation/drainage  engineers,  a  farm  mechanization  specialist,  and  an  agronomist.  The  MEU\n(para.  67)  will  be  established  to  monitor  project  implementation,  benefits,  as  well  as  social  and\nenvironmental impacts.\n\n82. \nA team of international and domestic consultants will assist the PMO and the PSO to set\nup their operational systems and manage project implementation. The Government and ADB will\njointly  conduct  annual  reviews  of  project  implementation,  including  project  organization  and\nstaffing  arrangements.  Necessary  adjustments  will  be  made  on  the  basis  of  the  implementation\nexperience (para. 98).\n\nA rayon consultative committee (RCC) will be established in Ak Altin during the first year of\n83. \nimplementation to ensure active beneficiary participation in project activities. RCC will be chaired\nby an elected representative of the project beneficiaries, and comprise other representatives from\nprivate  farms,  cooperative  farms,  farm  brigade  leaders,  farm  workers,  family  contractors,\ncommunity  leaders,  WUAs,  women  representatives,  and  the  district  administration.  PSO  will\nsubmit to RCC quarterly reports on the progress of project implementation. RCC will (i) represent\nthe project beneficiaries to monitor project implementation and its impacts; (ii) provide a forum for\naddressing  beneficiaries\u2019  concerns  and  discuss  district-level \nthat  arise  during\nimplementation;  and  (iii)  provide  inputs  and  recommendations  for  PMO,  PSO,  and  district\nadministration to take corrective and mitigating measures to improve implementation. Appendix 3\nillustrates the relationship of the various organizations involved in project implementation.\n\nissues \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n84. \nThe Project will be implemented over five years starting in the fourth quarter of year 2001\n(Appendix 4). Project activities during the first year will concentrate on the fielding of consultants,\nprocurement  and  installation  of  equipment,  development  of  operational  systems  for  PMO  and\nPSO,  and  training  of  their  staff.  For  ease  in  implementation  scheduling,  the  Project  area  will  be\ndivided  into  three  phases  with  due  consideration  to  hydrologic  boundaries.  The  civil  works\ncomponent will be implemented in three overlapping packages, each taking two calendar years,\nwith package 1 starting in year 2 and package 3 finishing at the end of year 5. The packages will\nbe  designed  to  ensure  that  on-farm,  interfarm,  and  commissioned  drainage  facilities  are\ncompleted within each major hydrologic supply and drainage unit in a staged fashion. To address\nan urgent concern of the project beneficiaries, the rehabilitation schedule will give high priority to\nthe  drainage  systems  in  the  settlement  area  by  including  them  in  package  1.  Field  surveys,\ninvestigations,  and  preparation  of  detailed  designs  of  the  civil  works  of  package  1  will  be\nconducted in year 1. Establishment of WUAs and their training will be initiated in year 1, with the\nbulk of the activities conducted in years 2 and 3.\n\n3. \n\nConsultation with Project Beneficiaries on Cost Recovery\n\n85. \nIn  accordance  with  the  Government  policy,  on-farm  investment  costs  will  be  fully\nrecovered from the project beneficiaries over a period of 25 years including a grace period of 5\nyears pursuant to the cost recovery agreements.26 Full cost recovery will provide farmers with a\nstrong incentive to participate in monitoring the design and implementation of the rehabilitation of\ntheir  on-farm  irrigation  and  drainage  systems,  as  well  as  O&M  activities  after  rehabilitation.\n\n                                                \n26 The beneficiaries will be charged for only those improvements that will be implemented on their farms, except for the\n\ndrainage wells, which may not necessarily be located on their land.\n\n\f22\n\nFarmers will have the option to join the Project. Those who join will be consulted on their choice of\nalternate plans for the rehabilitation. Rehabilitation work on a specific farm will start only after the\nfarmers approve the investment plan and sign the cost-recovery agreement (para. 71).\n\nFarmers\u2019 ability to fully repay the investment and finance the O&M costs was confirmed by\n86. \nthe  results  of  farm  budget  model  simulations.  Using  data  verified  with  MAWR,  the  local\nadministration, and farmers, the results of the model simulations show that, as cotton yields will\ndouble in eight years with the rehabilitation, the Project will generate high financial returns and a\nhealthy  cash  flow  for  both  cooperative  and  private  farms.  The  farmers  will  have  the  ability  to\nfinance  the  O&M  costs  starting  from  year  4  and  repay  the  full  investment  costs  starting  from\nyear 6.\n\nVarious  farmer  groups  were  consulted  on  the  cost  recovery  issue  during  project\n87. \npreparation.  Anticipated  project  benefits  and  associated  investment  and  O&M  costs  were\npresented to the representative farm beneficiaries. The beneficiaries, representing both the large\ncooperative  farms  and  the  small  private  farmers,  unanimously  supported  the  Project  and  its\ndesign, and agreed to fully repay the on-farm investment and finance all O&M costs of the on-farm\nfacilities. To further increase farmers\u2019 awareness of their rights, choices, and responsibilities in the\nProject  and  cost  recovery,  an  information  campaign  will  be  launched  at  the  start  of  project\nimplementation,  with  assistance  from  RBAC  and  the  project  consultants,  and  with  active\nparticipation of RCC.\n\n4. \n\nOperation and Maintenance of the Irrigation and Drainage Systems\n\nThe  O&M  arrangements  as  well  as  support  for  WUA  establishment  and  training  are\n88. \ndesigned to develop institutional capacity to facilitate the smooth transfer of O&M responsibilities\nto the project beneficiaries, with a view to sustaining the project benefits. As at present, O&M of\non-farm  irrigation  facilities  and  drainage  collectors  will  continue  to  be  the  responsibility  of  the\nrespective  farms  and/or  individual  water  users.  O&M  of  the  drainage  wells  will  ultimately  be\nhandled  by  WUAs  after  they  develop  sufficient  capabilities  and  experience.  O&M  of  interfarm\ncanals  and  drainage  collectors,  presently  the  responsibility  of  RAWD,  will  be  handed  over\nultimately to WUAs.\n\n89. \nDuring  the  transition  period  \u2013  before  all  O&M  activities  are  handed  over  to  the\nbeneficiaries  \u2013  suitable  arrangements  will  be  made  to  ensure  proper  O&M  of  the  facilities\nconstructed/improved under the Project. During the project period, O&M of the wells and interfarm\nirrigation  and  drainage  systems  will  be  the  responsibility  of  RAWD,  which  will  undertake  these\nactivities through its staff or will contract them out to private enterprises. To sustain its operation,\nRAWD will collect service charges for the drainage wells. It will divide the amount of actual power\nbills over the effective drainage area, and collect payments from farmers on a per hectare basis. It\nwill  also  take  charge  of  the  O&M  of  the  farm  machinery  purchased  under  the  Project.  The\ncommercial charges from the farm machinery services will sustain the RAWD Unit\u2019s operations.\n\n5. \n\nProcurement\n\n90.  Machinery, equipment, civil works, and services for rehabilitating irrigation and drainage,\nas  well  as  vehicles,  office  equipment,  and  materials  required  for  project  implementation  and\nmonitoring  will  be  procured  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement.  An  equipment  and\nmaterial  procurement  contract  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $500,000  or  more  will  be\nawarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB).  Contracts  costing  less  than\n$500,000  will  be  on  the  basis  of  international  shopping  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Small\n\n\f23\n\nsupply contracts costing less than $100,000 will be procured through direct purchase. The award\nof all equipment contracts will be subject to approval by ADB.\n\n91. \nEach  civil  works  contract  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $500,000  or  more  will  be\nawarded on the basis of ICB among prequalified contractors as described in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for\nProcurement. Civil works packages costing less than $500,000 will be carried out on the basis of\nlocal  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  MAWR  will  supervise  all  procurement.\nThe award of all civil works contracts will be subject to approval by ADB. A list of equipment and\nmaterials to be procured is in Appendix 5, and a tentative packaging of major procurement and\ncivil works is given in Appendix 6.\n\n6. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n92. \nThe Project will provide for 65 person-months of international consultants and 198 person-\nmonths of domestic consultants. The consultants will assist MAWR in (i) monitoring, evaluating,\nand  designing  pilot  farms;  (ii)  carrying  out  surveys  and  investigations,  preparing  and  reviewing\ndesigns,  and  supervising  construction  of  on-farm  and  interfarm  irrigation  and  drainage  facilities;\nand (iii) project administration. The consulting services will be provided by international consulting\nfirms in association with domestic consulting firms to be engaged by MAWR in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for the\nengagement of the domestic consultants. An outline of the terms of reference for consultants is in\nAppendix 7.\n\nThe input of international consultants will be limited to the initial years during which they\n93. \nwill  provide  hands-on  training  to  PMO/PSO  staff,  who  will  then  carry  out  project  activities\nindependently  later  in  the  implementation  period.  To  maximize  the  impacts  of  the  consulting\nservices, the schedule of the consultants\u2019 field services will be flexible, with appropriate breaks to\nincrease the total period covered.\n\n7. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action\n\nTo  expedite  project  implementation,  ADB  has  approved  advance  action  on  the\n94. \nprocurement  of  civil  works,  construction  materials  and  equipment,  as  well  as  recruitment  of\nconsultants. The Government has been informed that (i) advance action will cover actions up to,\nbut  not  including, contract signing; and (ii) approval of advance action does not commit ADB to\nfinance the Project.\n\n8. \n\nDisbursement, Accounts, Audits, and Reports\n\nAfter  loan  effectiveness,  an  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  the  Central  Bank  of\n95. \nUzbekistan,  or  a  bank  acceptable  to  ADB,  to  facilitate  the  timely  release  of  loan  funds  for  the\npurpose  of  making  payments  in  local  currency  under  the  Project.  During  the  first  year  of\nimplementation, the ceiling of the imprest account will be set at $100,000. Thereafter, and once\nMAWR  has  established  an  adequate  accounting  system  and  internal  control  procedures  for  the\nProject,  the  ceiling  for  the  imprest  account  will  be  based  on  an  estimate  of  expenditures  to  be\nincurred during the following 12 months of implementation. In any case, the ceiling for the imprest\naccount  will  not  exceed  $500,000.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and other procedures to be agreed upon by ADB and the\nGovernment. The use of ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedures will be considered after the\n\n\f24\n\nfirst year of project implementation, assuming the establishment of MAWR's separate accounting\nsystem and internal control procedures for the Project.\n\n96.  MAWR  will  keep  separate  accounts  and  financial  statements  for  the  Project  (including\nseparate  accounts  and  financial  statements  for  RAWD  and  RAWD  Unit),  which  will  be  audited\nannually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Loan  proceeds  will  be  used  for  engaging\ninternational auditors acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited financial statements will\nbe submitted to ADB within six months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate.\n\n97.  MAWR,  through  PMO,  will  submit  quarterly  and  annual  reports  to  ADB.  The  reports  will\nindicate progress made and problems encountered during the period under review, steps taken to\nremedy  the  problems,  proposed  program  of  activities,  and  expected  progress  during  the\nremaining implementation period. MAWR will also provide other reports and information relating to\nthe  Project  as  ADB  may  reasonably  request,  including  the  Project\u2019s  environmental  impacts,\ndialogue with beneficiaries, and any social issues relating to the Project. Within three months after\nphysical completion of the Project, MAWR will submit to ADB a project completion report detailing,\namong others, information on project implementation, use of the loan proceeds, and the extent to\nwhich the objectives of the Project have been accomplished.\n\n9. \n\nMidterm Review\n\n98. \nThe Government and ADB will jointly carry out a midterm review at the beginning of year 3\nof project implementation. The midterm review will assess, among others, Project implementation\nstatus, including (i) design and construction standards, (ii) physical progress and disbursements in\nrelation  to  the  implementation  schedule,  (iii)  performance  of  the  Project  consultants  and\ncontractors, and (iv) status of compliance with the assurances stipulated in the Loan Agreement.\nThe midterm review will also assess project impacts including (i) the project\u2019s environmental and\nsocial  impacts,  (ii)  the  effects  of  the  procurement  system  on  cotton  and  wheat  yields,  farm\nproductivity,  market  competition  and  participation  of  the  private  sector,  and  (iii)  the  feasibility  of\nreplicating Project achievements nationwide.\n\nF. \n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n99.  MAWR, the EA for the Project, was created by merging the former ministries of agriculture\nand  water  resources.  Its  primary  responsibility  is  to  implement  and  monitor  agricultural  policies.\nMAWR  is  responsible  for  coordinating  State  procurement  of  cotton  and  grain,  including  input\ndelivery,  machinery  services,  financing  of  cotton  production,  output  processing,  and  marketing.\nMAWR is also responsible for ensuring irrigation water supply, which involves civil works as well\nas maintenance of the irrigation and drainage systems. MAWR has equipment depots and staff in\nevery  district  and  coordinates  with  more  than  20  Government  institutions  on  various  agriculture\nsector issues.\n\n100.  MAWR has so far not been involved in implementing ADB-financed projects. However, it\nhas  been  implementing  a  World  Bank-financed  Cotton  Subsector  Improvement  Project  and  is\ninvolved  in  preparing  the  proposed  AERP  to  be  financed  by  the  World  Bank  (para.  43).  As\npreparation  of  the  AERP  has  been  slower  than  anticipated,  the  Government  is  considering\nmeasures to strengthen MAWR\u2019s implementation capacity for this Project by appointing qualified\nand experienced staff to lead the project implementation offices.\n\n\f25\n\nG. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironment\n\n101.  The  Project  has  been  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  Accordingly,  an  initial\nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  was  conducted  under  the  project  preparatory  TA.  The  IEE\nconcluded  that  the  Project  will  have  no  major  adverse  environmental  impacts  since  most  of  the\ncomponents  comprise  rehabilitation  works.  A  full  environmental  impact  assessment  was,\ntherefore,  not  required.  However,  MAWR  will  need  to  comply  with  all  applicable  environmental\nrequirements in accordance with the Government\u2019s regulations to obtain necessary environmental\nclearances  prior  to  construction,  and  to  undertake  environmental  monitoring  throughout  the\nimplementation period, and with ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines.\n\n102.  For  environmental  protection  and  improvement  as  well  as  resources  conservation,  the\nProject provides for (i) lowering of the water table and reclamation of saline lands, (ii) adoption of\nIPM  techniques  and  training  of  local  agronomists  in  alternate  pest  control  methods  and  rational\nuse of fertilizers, (iii) improvement of the environmental monitoring capacity through provision of\nappropriate equipment, and (iv) improvement of irrigation and drainage facilities and adoption of\nimproved water management practices. These measures will have positive environmental impacts\nin the area.\n\n2. \n\nSocial Analysis\n\n103.  The  overriding  social  issues  in  the  Project  area  are  the  declining  living  standards  of  the\nrural majority, deteriorating social services, and flooding in the settlement areas during the winter\nand spring seasons. The major factors underlying these social issues are the falling crop yields,\ndeclining  farm  income,  and  widespread  farm  losses  caused  by  the  deteriorating  irrigation  and\ndrainage systems. Social services have deteriorated because the local communities are unable to\npay  for  the  services,  and  the  farms  responsible  for  O&M  of  social  facilities  are  themselves\nstrapped for cash. With the rehabilitation of the irrigation and drainage systems under the Project,\nfarmers  will  benefit  from  increased  crop  yields  and  farm  incomes,  and  their  living  standards  will\nimprove  accordingly.  While  the  Project  has  no  specific  components  on  social  services,  it  is\nexpected that the increased farm income and the communities\u2019 strengthened financial status will\nenable  the  farmers  to  pay  for  social  services  and  the  situation  will  improve  significantly.  To\nalleviate the flooding problem in the settlements, the Project will give priority to rehabilitation of the\ndrainage systems in the settlement areas (para. 84).\n\n104. \nIntensive consultations with farmer beneficiaries were conducted at every step of project\npreparation.  All  farmers  interviewed  expressed  their  strong  support  and  keen  interest  in\nparticipating in the Project. Recognizing their responsibility in repaying the full investment costs for\non-farm  rehabilitation,  farmers  requested  close  supervision  of  project  implementation  by  the\nbeneficiary representatives. Accordingly, project implementation arrangements have included the\nestablishment of the RCC (para. 83), which is expected to be an effective mechanism for project\nmonitoring and conveying farmers\u2019 concerns and demands to MAWR and ADB. The MEU to be\nestablished  under  the  Project  (paras.  67)  will  collect  baseline  information  on  the  nature  and\nincidence of poverty in the Project area, and develop poverty indicators to monitor and evaluate\nthe  Project\u2019s  impacts  on  poverty  reduction.  Women  representatives  will  serve  in  the  RCC  and\nactively participate in monitoring, especially the impacts of the Project on women.\n\n\f26\n\nH. \n\nTechnical Assistance\n\n105.  The objective of the associated TA is to strengthen the existing RBAC in the Project area\nto provide agribusiness advisory and agricultural extension services to the beneficiaries (Appendix\n8).  The  TA  will  (i)  provide  institutional  support  to  RBAC,  facilitate  the  development  of  its\noperational strategy and management systems, and strengthen its staff capacity; (ii) facilitate the\nongoing  farm  restructuring;  (iii)  strengthen  the  agricultural  extension  system;  (iv)  improve  water\nmanagement; and (v) promote beneficiary participation in project implementation.\n\n106.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $860,000 equivalent, of which $600,000 equivalent\nwill be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the TA Special Fund. The TA will provide for 20\nperson-months  of  international  and  44  person-months  of  domestic  consultants.  The  consultants\nwill be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and\nother  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  TA  will\ncommence during the first year of project implementation and will be completed in 18 months.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n1. \n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n107. \n  With  the  Project,  the  annual  production  of  the  major  crops  (cotton  and  wheat)  will  rise\nsteadily  over  an  eight-year  period,  and  will  be  maintained  thereafter.  Cotton  production  in  the\nProject  area  will  rise  from  about  28,000  t  in  2001  to  about  56,000  t  in  year  8,  and  wheat  from\nabout  33,200  t  in  2001  to  about  49,000  tons  in  year  8.  With  increased  crop  yields  and\nrationalization  of  the  production  cost  structure  of  the  farms  through  gradual  restructuring\n(Appendix  9,  para.  27),  the  proposed  project  investments  are  projected  to  generate  an  overall\nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 13.7 percent in constant 2001 prices. In the event that\ncotton  and  wheat  yields  decrease  by  10  percent  simultaneously,  FIRR  would  decline  to  12.0\npercent. A 10 percent reduction in the prices of both cotton and wheat would give a FIRR of 11.1\npercent.\n\n2. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n108.  The  economic  analysis  was  based  on  the  domestic  price  numeraire,  and  adjustments\nwere made to reflect the removal of taxes and duties, the exclusion of debt service charges, and\nthe application of a shadow exchange rate factor of 2.0 to the border prices of traded inputs and\noutputs.  Given  a  situation  of  less  than  full  employment  in  the  rural  areas,  a  shadow  wage  rate\nfactor of 0.8 was used in the analysis. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project is\nestimated at 26.2 percent. Essentially, the EIRR is robust. In the unlikely event, that the projected\nyields of cotton and wheat with the Project were reduced by 10 percent throughout the 25-year\nperiod, the EIRR of the Project will be reduced to 23.9 percent. When the projected prices for both\ncotton and wheat decline by 10 percent, the EIRR would drop to 23.3 percent. Detailed financial\nand economic analyses are in Appendix 9.\n\n109.  The  sensitivity  of  the  FIRR  to  depreciation  of  the  local  currency  (sum)  against  the  dollar\nwas tested in view of the Government\u2019s plan to liberalize the foreign exchange rate regime (para.\n5),  which  would  lead  to  the  depreciation  of  the  local  currency  given  the  currently  overvalued\nofficial exchange rate. Depreciation of the sum would cause prices in some of the tradable inputs\n(such as equipment) and outputs (wheat and cotton) to rise, while prices in sum of  nontradable\n\n\f27\n\ninputs would lag behind. In general, the overall prices of farm outputs (wheat and cotton) are more\nsensitive than input prices to the foreign exchange rate, and the net impact of the local currency\ndepreciation against the  dollar on the FIRR will be favorable. Therefore, the liberalization of the\nforeign exchange rate regime will have a substantial favorable impact on the financial conditions\nand  profitability  of  the  farms,  and  will  substantially  narrow  the  gap  between  the  FIRR  and  the\nEIRR.27 The significant gap between the FIRR (13.7 percent) and EIRR (26.2 percent) is mainly\ndue to the fact that in the economic analysis, the price distortions created by the fixed exchange\nrate policy have been removed through the application of a shadow exchange rate factor of 2.0.\n\n3. \n\nCost Recovery\n\n110.  Farms will repay the State for the costs of rehabilitating the on-farm drainage and irrigation\nsystems, while the State will pay for (i) the rehabilitation of the interfarm systems; (ii) the costs of\ninstitutional  support,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation;  and  (iii)  all  expenses  related  to  project\nadministration  and  management.  The  on-farm  rehabilitation  costs  were  estimated  at  $1,100/ha,\nequivalent to SUM386,100/ha at the official exchange rate in constant 2001 prices.\n\n111.  The State will recover costs from the farms in the form of an infrastructure betterment levy\nover a period of 25 years including a 5-year grace period. This betterment levy was estimated as\nfollows. The on-farm investment costs were accounted for in the local currency at the prevailing\nofficial  exchange  rate.  Interest  charges  during  construction,  or  the  five-year  grace  period,  were\ncapitalized as part of the investment costs. Cost recovery will be made in the local currency. For\nestimation  purposes,  an  interest  rate  of  7  percent  per  annum  in  real  terms  was  used  for\ncalculating interest during the grace period, and for the repayment over the 20-year period. The\nbetterment levy was calculated in equal annual installments in constant 2001 prices, comprising\nprincipal repayment and interest charges. Based on the projected cash flow analyses, the farms\ncan afford the cost recovery payments of about SUM50,000/ha in constant 2001 prices from year\n6 to 25.\n\n4. \n\nProject Risks\n\n112.  A  number  of  risks  may  affect  project  implementation.  Policy  deficiencies  remain  in  the\noverall  economy  and  in  the  agriculture  sector  including  State  control  of  foreign  currency,  price\ndistortion caused by the overvalued official exchange rate, State involvement in price fixation, the\nremaining  (although  in  a  substantially  reduced  volume)  mandatory  State  procurement  quota  for\ncotton and wheat, and State control on cropping patterns. The Project\u2019s financial and economic\nanalyses,  including  the  calculation  of  the  FIRR  and  EIRR,  are  based  on  a  conservative\nassumption  that  these  policy  deficiencies  will  remain  during  the  entire  project  implementation\nperiod.28 Even under such a restricted policy environment, the Project will remain financially and\neconomically viable and sustainable because of the substantial gains in crop productivity. Using\nthe  procurement  prices  following  the  stipulations  in  COM  Resolution  No.  201,  the  results  of  the\nfarm  model  simulations  show  that  the  Project  will  generate  attractive  financial  returns  to  farms,\nallowing  the  farms  to  have  the  financial  capacity  to  fully  repay  the  investment  costs  of  on-farm\nrehabilitation (Appendix 9). However, the financial analysis assumes that the State procurement\nprices  of  cotton  and  wheat  will  continue  to  be  set  at  the  international  import  and  export  parity\nlevels  projected  at  the  prevailing  official  exchange  rate.  To  safeguard  this  assumption,  specific\nassurances have been obtained that the Government will annually review the State procurement\n                                                \n27 Unification of the exchange rate will have no impact on the EIRR, which is estimated using a shadow exchange rate\n\nfactor of 2.0.\n\n28 The project benefits will increase if the policy constraints are further relaxed. In particular, if exchange rate unification\n\noccurs (para. 5), the Project\u2019s financial returns and farm profits will increase substantially.\n\n\f28\n\nprices of cotton and wheat to ensure that future adjustments of these prices fully reflect the annual\ninflation rate and changes in the international prices, and also adjust for changes in the exchange\nrate (para. 125 [iii]).\n\n113.  The track record of project implementation in Uzbekistan has not been fully satisfactory.\nFactors  underlying  this  problem  were  carefully  studied  during  the  project  design  (para.  49).\nIncorporating  lessons  learned,  the  project  design  emphasizes  simplicity  and  implementability.  In\nparticular,  the  proposed  policy  reforms  are  based  on  the  Government\u2019s  reform  initiatives.  The\nimplementability  of  the  reform  measures  is  carefully  examined  through  close  consultations  with\nGovernment  implementation  agencies,  and  assurances  have  been  obtained  from  senior\nGovernment officials.\n\n114.  To  simplify  the  project  design,  the  focus  of  investment  will  be  the  rehabilitation  of  the\nirrigation and drainage systems. Since MAWR has a sufficient number of technical staff who are\nexperienced  in  designing  and  constructing  irrigation  and  drainage  systems,  the  risk  of  the  EA\u2019s\nlack of technical competence is judged as small.\n\n115. \nIncorporating lessons learned, the Project has established its implementation structure at\nan  early  stage.  The  staff  of  the  offices  that  will  be  involved  in  project  implementation  have\nparticipated  in  project  design  to  foster  a  sense  of  ownership  of  the  Project  and  strengthen  their\ncommitment to project implementation.\n\n116.  To overcome MAWR's lack of project implementation experience and to familiarize it with\nADB  operations,  training  in  ADB  operational  policies,  guidelines,  and  procedures  has  been  and\nwill continue to be provided to the project staff. In addition, international and domestic consultants\nwill  be  recruited  to  (i)  assist  PMO  and  PSO  to  set  up  appropriate  operational  systems,  and  (ii)\nprovide hands-on training to the project staff. To ensure high-quality project staff and their stability,\ndetailed  job  descriptions  and  qualification  requirements  have  been  developed  in  close\nconsultation with the Government. MAWR gave the assurance that qualified and experienced staff\nacceptable  to  ADB  will  be  assigned  to  these  offices;  measures  will  be  taken  to  avoid  staff\nturnover;  and  additional  staff  will  be  assigned  to  PMO,  PSO,  and  WG  to  support  project\nimplementation whenever necessary.\n\n117.  Potential  delays  in  release  of  counterpart  funds,  slow  procedure  of  Government  internal\napproval  for  use  of  loan  proceeds,  and  lack  of  cooperation  among  Government  agencies  may\ndelay procurement and consultant recruitment. These systematic issues have been brought to the\nattention  of  top  Government  officials  and  a  set  of  measures  was  developed  to  improve  the\nsituation (para. 48). The Government gave the assurance that counterpart funds will be adequate\nand  timely  during  the  project  period.  The  interministerial  PSC  and  WG  will  identify  and  resolve\nissues that need coordination among multiple Government agencies. The authority to approve for\nproject implementation has been delegated to the director general of RRA (paras. 78-79). ADB\u2019s\nloan  review  missions  will  closely  monitor  the  actual  implementation  of  these  arrangements  and\ndevelop remedial measures accordingly.\n\n118.  Lack  of  participation  by  farmer  beneficiaries  in  the  development  of  the  cost-recovery\nscheme may lead to default in farmers\u2019 payments. To minimize this risk, close consultations with\nfarmer  beneficiaries  were  conducted  at  every  stage  of  project  preparation,  including  the\npresentation  of  the  estimated  investment  costs  of  the  on-farm  rehabilitation  on  a  per  hectare\nbasis, expected crop yield increases under the Project, and farm financial returns and cash flows\n(paras.  85,  108-109).  An  information  campaign  at  the  start  of  project  implementation  will  further\nraise farmer beneficiaries\u2019 awareness of their rights, options, and responsibilities in cost recovery;\n\n\f29\n\nand will develop a detailed investment plan, cost-recovery scheme, and repayment schedule with\nthem.  Suitable  mechanisms  will  need  to  be  developed  to  collect  repayments  for  the  investment\nand user fees for O&M. In conjunction with training for WUAs, the TA consultants and the RBAC\nstaff will facilitate development of collection mechanisms. The Government has assured it will take\nnecessary actions to ensure that WUAs can perform their functions: organizing and training water\nusers,  signing  contracts  for  water  allocation  and  O&M  services,  and  collecting  user  fees  from\nmembers (para. 125 [vi]).\n\n119.  A  number  of  factors  may  also  affect  the  achievement  and  sustainability  of  the  project\nbenefits: (i) lower-than-anticipated crop yields; (ii) falling international prices for cotton and wheat;\n(iii)  default  in  repayments  for  cost  recovery;  and  (iv)  unsustainable  operations  of  the  rural\ninstitutions strengthened or established under the Project, such as RBAC, MEU, and WUA. These\nfactors  have  been  considered  in  the  project  design.  Estimates  of  the  project  benefits  are\ndeliberately  based  on  conservative  assumptions  using  cotton  yields  historically  achieved  in  the\nproject area. Prices applied in the analysis are based on the World Bank commodity price forecast\n(January  2001),  which  predicts  a  slow  recovery  of  cotton  and  wheat  prices  in  2005  from  the\ncurrent depression. Sensitivity analysis confirms that the Project will generate robust returns to the\ninvestment even under adverse conditions (paras. 107-109 and Appendix 9). Finally, Government\nassurance has been obtained to finance the MEU operations after project completion. To sustain\nthe operations of RBAC and WUA after project completion, substantial efforts will be given during\nthe project period to strengthen their capacity in providing services to farmers and collecting user\nfees, including the establishment of sound operational systems and capacity building for their staff\n(paras. 62 - 65).\n\nB. \n\nEnvironment\n\n120.  The  Project  will  have  an  overall  positive  environmental  impact.  Lowering  of  the\nunderground  water  table,  reclamation  of  saline  lands,  and  reduction  in  the  salinity  of  drainage\nwater  through  effective  operation  of  the  rehabilitated  and  improved  irrigation  and  drainage\nsystems  will  create  an  environment  more  appropriate  for  human  health,  biodiversity,  and  crop\nproduction. The lowering water table will also reduce the incidence of waterborne diseases. Crop\nyield  increases  will  improve  farm  incomes  and  enable  farmers  to  improve  their  nutrition,  health\ncare, water supply,  and  sanitation. Such improvement will raise the general health standards of\nthe project beneficiaries. Failure to correct the current problems will almost certainly lead to further\ndeterioration  of  health  standards,  and  more  areas  of  fertile  land  will  be  subject  to  secondary\nsalinization.  Training  in  IPM,  and  improved  practices  in  fertilizer  application  and  water\nmanagement will lead to rational use of agrochemicals and more efficient use of water resources.\nStrengthening  the  capacity  of  the  environmental  monitoring  agencies  will  ensure  regular\nenvironmental  monitoring  and  early  warning  to  permit  corrective  measures.  The  formation  of\nWUAs and training them in water management and O&M will contribute to sustaining the Project\u2019s\nenvironmental benefits.\n\nC. \n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n1. \n\nPoverty Reduction\n\n121.  The Project will have a significant impact on poverty reduction in the Project area. There\nare  no  official  data  on  poverty  in  Ak  Altin;  however,  it  is  estimated  that  about  12  percent  of  the\ndistrict's 9,640 families who live on less than $18 per capita per month (para. 27) are in need of\nsocial  assistance.  The  majority  of  the  poor  in  the  Project  area  are  workers  on  the  large\ncooperative farms, which have been incurring losses and are unable to regularly pay cash wages\n\n\f30\n\nto  their  workers.  Lacking  alternative  income  sources,  farm  workers  rely  on  production  from\nhousehold plots and irregular payment in kind from their cooperative farms, and thus suffer from\ndeclining living standards. By doubling cotton yield, the Project is expected to transform the loss-\nincurring  farms  into  financially  sustainable  enterprises,  including  restructured  farms  and  private\nfarms.  Farm  workers  and  their  families  will  benefit  from  increased  wage  payments  in  a  timely\nmanner; their living standards will be improved accordingly. Furthermore, the rehabilitation of the\ndrainage  systems  in  the  settlement  areas  will  directly  improve  living  conditions  for  the  rural\nresidents  by  lowering  the  underground  water  tables  and  mitigating  the  flooding  problems  in  the\nwinter  and  spring  seasons.  With  rising  farm  incomes,  local  communities  will  have  the  financial\ncapability to spend for social services leading to improved sanitary conditions and public health.\nSince women and men have equal access to land in the Project area, and since water appears to\nbe equitably distributed and cropping patterns are uniformly based on cotton and wheat across all\nfarms,  the  benefits  are  expected  to  be  distributed  evenly  in  the  Project  area  among  all  social\ngroups, including women farmers and wives of farm workers.\n\n122.  Small  private  farmers  will  benefit  from  the  machinery  services  to  be  provided  under  the\nProject.  Many  small  farmers  currently  do  not  have  sufficient  access  to  timely  farm  machinery\nservices; thus, farm operations are delayed, crop yields are low, and product quality is poor. The\nadditional  choice  of  renting  machinery  from  the  RAWD  Unit  will  further  promote  competition  in\nfarm  machinery  services,  leading  to  better  services  and  prices  for  all  farmers.  Rural  people  will\nalso benefit from increased employment opportunity, as increased cotton production will use more\nlabor, especially during weeding and harvesting seasons.\n\n2. \n\nImproved Rural Institutions\n\n123.  The beneficiaries, especially the small private farmers, will benefit from the strengthened\nrural  institutions.  WUAs  established  and  strengthened  under  the  Project  will  organize  the  small\nindividual farmers, ensure their access to irrigation water supply, and arrange O&M services for\nthem.  In  the  long  term,  WUAs  will  become  a  permanent  structure  in  the  rural  area  to  organize\nfarmers in other activities such as input purchasing and output marketing. In addition to promoting\nfarmers\u2019  participation  in  project  implementation,  RCC  (para.  83)  will  likely  empower  farmers  to\nactively participate in other local community activities.\n\n3. \n\nWomen in Development\n\n124.  Women will have equal access to all services provided by the Project, including business\nadvice,  agricultural  extension  services,  and  training  provided  by  RBAC  and  WUAs.  Women  will\nalso  benefit  from  the  enhanced  employment  opportunities  brought  about  by  increased  cotton\nharvests. Women representatives will serve in RCC and participate in project implementation and\nmonitoring, particularly in the information campaign.

As of May 2001, about 5,855 ha was cultivated by 165 small private farms,\nand  the  remainder  by  12  large  cooperative  farms.  The  two  major  crops  in  Ak  Altin  are  cotton\nand wheat, annually utilizing 54 percent and 39 percent of the irrigated cropland, respectively.\nThe  remaining  7  percent  of  the  irrigated  cropland  is  planted  to  several  minor  crops:  maize  (3\npercent), fruit (2 percent), vegetables (1 percent), and alfalfa (1 percent). This cropping pattern\nis expected to remain, as the Government pursues an import substitution policy for wheat and\nrelies heavily on cotton to generate foreign exchange.\n\n2. \nAgricultural  lands  in  Ak  Altin  were  originally  converted  from  steppes  by  installing  and\noperating  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  on  which  crop  cultivation  depends.    Following  the\ncollapse  of  the  former  Soviet  Union,  State  farms  were  reorganized  as  new  cooperative  farms,\nwhich  essentially  retained  the  organization,  management,  and  operational  features  of  the  old\nState farm. However, changes were introduced recently to revitalize the incentive structure for\nthe  production  units  of  the  farms.  Typically,  a  cooperative  farm  has  3,000  ha  of  irrigated\ncropland.  Although  crop  cultivation  and  harvesting  are  generally  mechanized,  an  average\ncooperative  farm  maintains  a  large  workforce  of  700-1,000  people.  Until  early  1999  when  the\nGovernment \nthe\nresponsibilities of cooperative farms were more than just farming. The cooperative farms were\nobliged  to  provide  funds  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  schools,  hospitals,  and\npublic facilities such as water supply, electricity, heating, sewage, etc.\n\nintroduced  measures \n\nfinancial  burden  of \n\nto  reduce \n\nfarms, \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\nB. \n\nState Procurement of Wheat and Cotton\n\nThe State controls the cropping pattern of the farms, cotton procurement, and to some\n3. \nextent wheat procurement to provide financial incentives to the farms. The Government in May\n2001 replaced the annual production target of 50,000 tons (t) for cotton and wheat separately\nwith a fixed procurement quota of 17,000 t for cotton and 12,500 t for wheat. The Government\nalso abolished joint responsibility for fulfilling the procurement quota.\n\n4. \nThe  production  target  of  wheat,  which  was  valid  until  May  2001,  was  effectively\nequivalent to a yield target of 3.5 t/ha, compared with the actual average wheat yield of 2.2 t/ha.\nThe quantity of wheat procured by the State from the project area farms represented 50 percent\nof the wheat production target of 50,000 t, which is equivalent to 25,000 t annually. Given the\ndeclining wheat yields in the district, the State procurement has increased proportionally against\nthe actual production and effectively amounted to about 95 percent of the district's actual wheat\nproduction of 26,978 t in 2000. Given the amount of wheat procured by the State, little was left\nfor farmers to sell at the local markets. Farmers sold much of the remaining wheat to their own\nworkers at prices equivalent to the State procurement prices. Nonetheless, the State provided a\n20  percent  price  premium  over  and  above  the  published  procurement  prices  of  wheat  for  the\nquantities purchased by the State exceeding 25 percent of the production target. Thus, the price\npremium applied to State purchases of wheat over and above 12,500 t.\n\n5. \nThe annual fixed quota of 12,500 t of wheat is equivalent to 0.9 t/ha, compared with the\naverage  wheat  yield  of  about  2.2  t/ha  in  2000  in  the  district.  Once  farmers  have  fulfilled  their\nState  procurement  obligation,  they  can  sell  their  above-quota  wheat  at  the  local  markets  at\nprevailing prices. State procurement prices of wheat presently reflect a range of quality grades,\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\nand are essentially equivalent to farmgate import parity financial prices at the official exchange\nrate.  Nevertheless,  wheat  prices  at  the  local  markets  are  generally  higher  than  the  State\nprocurement  prices.  In  May  2001,  the  price  of  wheat  at  the  local  markets  was  at  least  50\npercent higher than the State procurement price. By limiting the State procurement of wheat, the\nProject will create a financial incentive for farmers to increase wheat crop productivity.\n\n6. \nUp  to  the  cropping  year  2000,  all  cotton  was  procured  through  Khlopkoprom,  a  State\njoint stock company which has, throughout the country, processing facilities for cotton including\ndrying,  cleaning,  grading,  ginning,  certifying,  and  packing.  The  processed  cotton  was  sold  to\nforeign  traders  through  local  private  trading  firms  registered  with  the  Ministry  of  External\nEconomic  Relations.  These  local  private  traders  handled  almost  all  cotton  export  and  were\nobliged to surrender all foreign exchange earnings to the Government at official exchange rate.\nAt  the  local  level,  farms  entered  into  contractual  agreements  with  designated  cotton  ginning\nfactories.  These  contracts  covered  scheduled  advance  payments,  crop  deliveries,  and  other\nobligations.  State  procurement  prices  for  cotton  were  determined  by  the  State,  taking  into\naccount  quality  grades;  international  prices  (cost,  insurance  and  freight  [CIF]  Liverpool);  the\nofficial exchange rate; freight, insurance, and ginning costs; and less efficient management by\nvarious Government agencies.\n\n7. \nWhile the cotton procurement arrangements mentioned above will continue for the rest\nof  the  country,  procurement  in  Ak  Altin  Rayon  will  be  governed  by  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers\nResolution  No.  102  issued  on  2  May  2001.  The  farmers  of  Ak  Altin  Rayon  will  be  free  to  sell\ntheir  above-quota  cotton  production  to  legal  trading  entities  at  mutually  agreed  upon  prices.\nAlthough  the  Government  has  estimated  the  price  premium  for  above-quota  cotton  at  40\npercent, a conservative price premium of 12 has been used in financial and economic analysis.\n\nC. \n\nPotential and Challenges\n\nAll farms in Ak Altin, with the exception of a few private ones, have been unprofitable in\n8. \nrecent  years  as  they  face  (i)  declining  crop  productivity  due  to  deteriorating  conditions  of  the\ndrainage  and  irrigation  systems,  (ii)  excessive  labor  costs  and  social  obligations,  (iii)  heavy\nfinancial  burdens  for  maintaining  social  and  communal  infrastructure,  (iv)  high  administrative\ncosts, (v) multiple and high taxes, and (vi) low prices for their crops under the centralized State\nprocurement system. Average yields of cotton and wheat have declined to 1.4 t/ha and 2.3 t/ha,\nrespectively, due to the poorly functioning irrigation and drainage systems. Without rehabilitation\nof these systems, per hectare yields are expected to decline further to 1.0 t/ha for cotton and 1.4\nt/ha  for  wheat  over  the  next  eight  years.  Essentially,  farms  have  been  squeezed  by  a\ncombination of high production costs and fixed costs, and low revenues. This dismal operating\nenvironment  has  led  the  farms  to  accumulate  massive  debts  to  the  State  and  their  input\nsuppliers.\n\n9. \nGiven  the  momentum  generated  by  the  reform  initiatives  and  the  pricing  incentives  for\nwheat and cotton, the Project is designed to improve agricultural productivity in the district and\nincrease  farm  incomes  and  profitability  by  rehabilitating  the  irrigation  and  drainage  systems.\nWith  the  improved  infrastructure  restoring  crop  productivity  rapidly,  farms  are  expected  to\nimprove  their  financial  health  and  profitability.  Although  the  financial  responsibility  for\nmaintaining  social  and  community  infrastructure  has  been  removed  from  the  farms  and\ntransferred to the State, cooperative farms still face high fixed costs and inefficient use of inputs.\nThe farms will be encouraged to undertake a number of measures to achieve higher revenues,\nand introduce financial discipline to reduce costs. The Rural Business Advisory Center (RBAC)\nwill  provide  advisory  services  to  participating  farms,  in  the  context  of  an  overall  business\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 9, page 3\n\nplanning  and  farm  management  initiatives,  including  aspects  related  to  agronomy,  pest\nmanagement, and O&M of the irrigation and drainage systems.\n\n10.  With  the  Project,  three  major  factors  will  lead  to  higher  farm  revenues:  (i)  incremental\ncrop yields and prevention of further decline in crop yields due to the deteriorating irrigation and\ndrainage  systems;  (ii)  prevention  of  crop  losses  by  improving  the  timeliness  of  cultivation  and\nharvests  through  increased  availability  of  farm  machinery  services.  and  (iii)  higher  prices  for\nabove-quota  cotton  and  wheat  through  crop  quality  improvements.  The  analyses  here  were\ndeliberately  conservative  to  exclude  the  potential  additional  benefits  from  quality  grade\nimprovement.  At  present,  the  crop  quality  grades  of  Ak  Altin  farms  are  below  standard.\nConsequently,  the  prices  the  farms  receive  for  these  commodities  have  been  substantially\ndiscounted at rates ranging from 5 to 30 percent of the listed State procurement prices for the\nhighest quality grades. In the medium term, over a period of 5-10 years, there is much room for\nimproving  crop  vigor  and  quality  grade  through  (i)  better  selection  of  seeds,  (ii)  improved\nagronomic practices, and (iii) upgraded pest management.\n\nFarms  can  undertake  several  cost-saving  measures  in  the  medium  term,  without\n11. \nresorting  to  drastic  measures  that  may  have  negative  social  impacts.  The  cooperative  farms\ngenerally have a large permanent workforce of 700-1,000 workers although farm operations are\ntypically seasonal. In addition, the cooperative farms also have a heavy layer of administrative\nand  management  staff,  and  face  excessive  overhead  expenses  for  administration  and\nmanagement. The workforce may be gradually reduced through natural attrition over a period of\neight years, without replacement, as many workers are retiring or leaving the farms on their own\nvolition.  Labor  requirements  at  peak  times  can  then  be  satisfied  with  seasonal  labor,  thereby\nreducing fixed expenses on wages and benefits. Essentially, the farms can gradually streamline\ntheir labor force and social obligations, and increase their seasonal labor inputs, when required,\nat  peak  times.  Additionally,  the  farms  can  also  rationalize  their  farm  machinery  operations  to\nsave costs by (i) limiting the use of transport facilities to farming purposes only, and preventing\nunauthorized uses of trucks, tractors, and wagons for other activities; (ii) improving agronomic\npractices to minimize seeding failure, and therefore avoid repeated mechanization for seeding;\n(iii) minimizing turnaround and idle running time for machinery to save fuel; and (iv) improving\npreventive  maintenance  to  avoid  costly  machinery  repairs  and  overhaul.  There  are  other\npossibilities  for  cost  savings  (effective  application  rates  of  fertilizers  and  agrochemicals  for\nspecific crops), but specific measures will have to be designed according to the circumstances\nfaced by the farms. The services of RBAC will therefore address the overall farm management\ninitiatives  that  can  be  feasibly  undertaken  in  the  context  of  the  progressively  changing\nenvironment for market-oriented farming.\n\n12. \nAt present, there is little flexibility for changing the cropping pattern dictated by the State.\nThe  following  analyses  are  conservative,  essentially  assuming  no  change  in  the  current\npractice. However, in the event the State relaxes its control on the cropping pattern and allows\nthe  farms  to  determine  their  own  cropping  pattern  for  as  long  as  they  meet  the  State\nprocurement quotas for wheat and cotton, the farms will very likely grow less wheat in favor of\ncotton. The gross margins per hectare for cotton are expected to be higher than those for wheat\nwhen potential incremental yields are fully realized.\n\nD. \n\nTypical Farm Models\n\nTo  illustrate  the  financial  viability  of  farms  in  the  project  area,  two  typical  farm  models\n13. \nwere  developed:  (i)  a  cooperative  farm  with  a  landholding  of  3,000  ha  of  irrigated  cropland,\nemploying a permanent workforce of 700 workers; and (ii) a private farm with 125 ha of irrigated\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 9, page 4\n\ncropland,  employing  15  permanent  workers.  Both  types  of  farm  maintain  the  same  cropping\npattern as described in para. 1.  Although the variable costs of production on these farms are\nsimilar, the cooperative farm has proportionally higher fixed costs than the private farm. These\nfixed  costs  are  mainly  associated  with  (i)  the  wages  and  social  benefits  for  the  permanent\nworkforce, (ii) power and energy consumption, (iii) maintenance for farm buildings and facilities,\nand  (iv)  administration  and  management  costs.  The  private  farms  are  generally  not  burdened\nwith heavy fixed costs, given their lean management structure and flexibility in utilizing seasonal\nlabor to complement their small workforce.\n\nE. \n\nMajor Assumptions\n\nTypical  1  ha  crop  budgets  were  estimated  for  scenarios  with  and  without  rehabilitated\n14. \nfertilizers,\nirrigation  and  drainage  systems.  Direct \nagrochemicals, labor, mechanization, and transport were estimated to reflect present practices\nand achievable improvement over an eight-year period.\n\ninputs  consisting  of  seeds, \n\nfarm \n\n15.  With  the  Project,  crop  yields  are  expected  to  increase  progressively  over  a  period  of\neight years: (i) cotton from an average of 1.4 t  to 2.8 t/ha, (ii) wheat from 2.3 t to 3.4 t/ha, (iii)\nmaize from 2.3 t to 3.1 t/ha, (iv) fruit from 3.2 t to 4.5 t/ha, (v) vegetables from 9.5 t to 13.3 t/ha,\nand (vi) alfalfa from 8.0 t to 11.2 t/ha. Without the Project, crop yields are expected to decline to\n(i) 1.0 t/ha for cotton, (ii) 1.4 t/ha for wheat, (iii) 1.2 t/ha for maize, (iv) 1.7 t/ha for fruit, (v) 5.0\nt/ha  for  vegetables,  and  (vi)  4.2  t/ha  for  alfalfa.  The  assumed  yield  gains  with  the  Project  are\ndeliberately modest and realistic, and are based on historical yields of the project area.\n\nForeign inflation rates follow the World Bank\u2019s projection of the manufacturing unit value\n16. \n(MUV) indices for inflation in US dollar terms of manufactures exported from the G-5 countries\n(France, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, and United States), weighted proportionally to the\ncountries\u2019  exports  to  the  developing  countries.  Accordingly,  foreign  inflation  was  projected  at\n0.61 percent in 2001, 1.60 percent in 2002, 2.50 percent in 2005, and 2.48 percent in 2010 and\nthereafter.\n\n17. \nBoth  financial  and  economic  analyses  were  for  a  period  of  25  years  in  2001  constant\nprices and in the local currency, the sum. Year 1 represents year 2001, the year in which the\nProject is expected to commence.\n\nThe  Government  official  exchange  rate1  was  assumed  at  SUM345.00  to  $1.00  (actual,\n18. \nApril  2001).  Direct  and  indirect  foreign  exchange  contents  of  input  and  output  prices  were\nconverted  to  the  local  currency  using  the  official  exchange  rate.2  The  use  of  the  official\n                                                \n1  This  official  exchange  rate  is  overvalued,  and  is  maintained  for  currency  transactions  conducted  at  the  Uzbek\nRepublican  Currency  Exchange  (URCE).  The  primary  sources  of  supply  of  foreign  exchange  at  the  URCE  are\nmandatory  sales  of  foreign  exchange  proceeds  of  cotton  and  gold  at  the  overvalued  exchange  rate;  and  the\nprimary uses of foreign exchange sold through URCE are external public debt service and State-approved imports\nof capital and other goods to support State-sponsored programs and projects. The State allows commercial banks\nand exchange bureaus to conduct foreign exchange transactions. The  exchange rates in the  commercial market\nare formally determined by market forces, but are maintained by the State at below the market clearing level. The\ncommercial  exchange  rate  was  SUM675.00/690  (buying/selling)  to  $1.00  (actual,  May  2001).  There  is  a  thriving\ncurb  foreign  exchange  market  to  cater  to  the  excess  demand  for  foreign  exchange.  The  cash  curb  rate  was\nSUM920 to $1.00 (May 2001). The official segments of the foreign exchange transactions control the bulk of the\ntotal transactions in the country. Accurate estimates of the size of the curb market were difficult to obtain. The high\ncurb rate was also influenced by transaction risks and law enforcement.\n\n2  The State procurement prices of tradable cotton and wheat, as determined at export and import parity levels using\nthe  overvalued  official  exchange  rate,  and  less  efficient  processing  and  management  by  various  government\nagencies effectively represent an implicit taxation on the farms. The financial farmgate prices of cotton and wheat\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 9, page 5\n\nexchange rate for the financial analysis is appropriate, considering that (i) cotton is subject to a\n100  percent  foreign  exchange  surrender  requirement  at  the  official  rate;  (ii)  financial  prices  of\nfertilizers and other inputs, including machinery services, are controlled by the State, using the\nofficial  exchange  rate  for  converting  foreign  contents  to  the  local  currency;  (iii)  State\nprocurement  prices  for  the  major  crops,  cotton  and  wheat,  are  linked  to  the  official  exchange\nrate;  and  (iv)  the  State  uses  the  official  exchange  rate  for  converting  foreign  exchange\ninvestment costs to the local currency.\n\nCotton,  wheat,  and  fertilizer  prices  were  projected  using  the  World  Bank\u2019s  commodity\n19. \nprice projections. Various adjustments for transport, handling, storage, insurance, intermediary\nmargins,  and  physical  losses  were  made  for  determining  farmgate  prices.  The  financial  and\neconomic  farmgate  prices  of  urea,  potassium  chloride,  and  phosphate  were  derived  on  an\nimport  parity  basis,  and  expressed  in  terms  of  their  nitrogen,  potassium,  and  phosphorus\nnutrient contents. The domestic prices of tradable fertilizers are presently controlled by the State\nand  are  largely  distorted.  In  August  1999,  the  actual  prices  of  fertilizers,  on  the  basis  of  their\npure nutrient contents, were below their import parity equivalents at the official exchange rate by\nabout  44  percent  for  nitrogen,  62  percent  for  potassium,  and  12  percent  for  phosphate.\nFarmgate financial prices of fertilizers were projected to reach import parity levels at the official\nexchange  rate  over  a  period  of  five  years,  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  plan  to  reduce\npayments for farm support gradually.\n\n20. \nUzbekistan  is  a  wheat-importing  country.  Thus,  farmgate  prices  of  wheat  were  derived\non  an  import  parity  basis,  using  neighboring  Kazakhstan\u2019s  export  parity  border  prices.\nKazakhstan\u2019s  wheat  exports  to  the  Russian  Federation  compete  with  wheat  exports  to  the\nRussian  Federation  from  the  United  States  (US)  and  Canada.  Therefore,  the  projected\ninternational  prices  of  wheat  for  the  region  were  based  on  the  Russian  markets,  around\nMoscow,  as  a  destination  reference  for  major  exports  in  the  region.  The  average  local  wheat\ngrades are of the third quality grade, carrying a price discount of about 15 percent on average\nagainst the first grade. The projected international prices of wheat (free on board [FOB], US) for\nUS  No.1  hard  red  winter  wheat  were  used  for  estimating  the  equivalent  border  wheat  prices\nafter  adjustments  for  quality,  freight  and  insurance  costs,  and  charges  for  handling  and\ntransport.  In  deriving  farmgate  prices  of  wheat,  further  adjustments  to  the  border  prices  were\nmade  to  account  for  costs  associated  with  elevator  storage,  physical  losses,  drying,  and  local\ntransport.\n\n21. \nUzbekistan is a major cotton exporter in the world. Accordingly, farmgate prices of seed\ncotton  (raw  cotton)  were  derived  from  the  projected  international  prices  of  cotton  fiber  ([CIF],\nEurope), by adjusting for (i) quality discount of about 8 percent for Uzbekistan\u2019s average grades;\n(ii) railway transport and insurance; (iii) intermediary costs including ginning costs; and (iv) the\nvalue  of  by-products  such  as  seeds,  fluff,  and  lint.  On  average,  the  quantity  of  fiber  produced\namounts  to  about  30  percent  of  seed  cotton  by  weight.  The  value  of  by-products  represents\nabout 10 percent of the value of the fiber equivalent.\n\n22. \nThe economic analysis was based on the domestic price numeraire, and adjustments to\nfinancial prices were made to reflect the removal of taxes of 10 percent, the exclusion of debt\nservice  charges,  and  the  application  of  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  (SERF)  of  2.0  to  the\nborder prices of tradable inputs and outputs. The basic wage rates on the farms in 2001 were\n\n                                                                                                                                                         \nin 2001 were estimated at $273/t (export parity) and $124/t (import parity), respectively. On the other hand, the use\nof the overvalued official exchange rate for pricing tradable agricultural inputs represents an implicit subsidy to the\nfarms.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 9, page 6\n\nestimated at SUM388/day, excluding pension and insurance charges amounting to 40 percent\nof the basic wages. Given a situation of less than full employment in the rural areas, a shadow\nwage rate factor (SWRF) of 0.8 was used in the analysis. The labor content for civil works was\nestimated  at  35  percent.  Therefore,  the  economic  prices  of  civil  works  were  calculated  by\napplying a conversion factor of 0.93 to the net-of-tax financial prices of civil works.\n\nF. \n\nBenefits\n\nThe benefits from rehabilitating irrigation and drainage were derived from the expected\n23. \nincreases in crop yields, and  prevention of further decline of crop yields. With the Project, the\nexpected annual production levels of the cultivated crops were estimated to rise steadily over an\neight-year period: (i) cotton, from 27,972 t to 55,736 t; (ii) wheat, from 33,189 t to 49,035 t; (iii)\nmaize, from 2,553 t to 3,417 t; (iv) fruit, from 2,368 t to 3,321 t; (v) vegetables, from 3,515 t to\n4,930 t; and (vi) alfalfa, from 2,960 t to 4,152 t. Without the Project, the annual crop production\nlevels would decline over an eight-year period to 19,117 t for cotton, 20,276 t for wheat, 1,347 t\nfor maize, 1,250 t for fruit, 1,855 t for vegetables, and 1,562 t for alfalfa.\n\nG. \n\nFarm Net Incomes, Cash Flows, and Cost Recovery\n\n24. \nFor estimating the profitability of the farms and their capacity to repay the Government\nfor  part  of  the  investment  costs,  financial  projections  estimated  farm  net  income  before  debt\nservice.  Both  income  and  cash  flow  analyses  were  performed  in  constant  2001  prices,  rather\nthan in the conventional  current  terms, for two reasons: (i) the domestic inflation forecast was\nhighly speculative, with a history of hyperinflation; and (ii) the present exchange rate regime is a\nhighly  administered  system,  with  two  different  legal  exchange  rates  (official  and  commercial\nrates),  against  a  backdrop  of  a  thriving  curb  market.  Thus,  a  cash  flow  analysis  in  constant\nprices provides a fair estimate of the magnitude of farm profitability and liquidity in real terms,\nespecially  with  the  expectation  that  the  Government  will  unify  and  float  the  exchange  rates  in\nthe near future. A number of key assumptions were made for the analysis:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Government  would  continue  to  provide  scheduled  installments  of  advance\npayments to farmers  over the crop growing period for both cotton and wheat in\nan  amount  equivalent  to  90  percent  of  the  expected  value  of  the  crops.  At\npresent, there are no alternative sources of trade financing to provide the farms\nwith the required working capital. Therefore, the State must provide assurances\nthat advance payments to the farms for cotton and wheat would continue for as\nlong as the  State (a) retains certain controls over cotton marketing, (b) controls\ndomestic  wheat  production,  and  (c)  dictates  the  cropping  pattern  for  cotton  and\nwheat.\n\nOn-farm  investments  for  improving  the  drainage  and  irrigation  systems  were\nestimated  at  $1,100/ha.  Beneficiaries  would  repay  the  Government  only  for  the\non-farm investment, in the form of an infrastructure betterment levy over a period\nof  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years.  The  Government  would  bear\nfully  all  other  investment  costs.  This  betterment  levy  was  estimated  as  follows.\nThe  on-farm  investment  costs  were  accounted  for  in  the  local  currency  at  the\nprevailing official exchange rate. Interest charges during construction, or the five-\nyear grace period, were capitalized as part of the investment costs. Repayment\nwould be made in the local currency. For estimation purposes, an interest rate of\n7  percent  per  annum  in  real  terms  was  used  in  calculating  interest  charges\nduring  the  grace  period,  and  in  amortizing  the  repayment  of  the  on-farm\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 9, page 7\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\ninvestment  cost  by  the  farms.  The  cost  recovery  payments  were  calculated  in\nequal annual installments comprising capital repayment and interest charges.\n\nA single and unified land tax of SUM1,842/ha was applied to the farms, based on\nan  average  land  fertility  score  for  the  district.  Sales  of  farm  outputs  would\ncontinue  to  be  exempted  from  value-added  taxes,  as  currently  practiced.  As  of\n2001, there were practically no income taxes applicable to the farms. The farms\nsimply paid a single tax, which is the unified land tax.\n\nCooperative farms would undertake measures to reduce fixed charges related to\nexcessive  administrative  costs  and  redundant  labor.  Such  measures  would  be\ncarried out gradually at an attainable rate of 2.5 percent annually for a maximum\nperiod of eight years.\n\nCooperative  farms  would  no  longer  be  burdened  with  the  financial  obligation  to\npay for maintaining public, social, and community infrastructures. It was projected\nthat  the  transfer  of  this  financial  obligation  from  the  farms  to  the  State  budget\nwould not be reversed.\n\n(vi) \n\nThe  cost  for  O&M  of  the  rehabilitated  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  was\nestimated at $25/ha.\n\n(vii)  Rehabilitation  of  the  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  would  be  undertaken  in  a\nfashion  that  would  minimize  disruption  of  farm  operations  and  prevent  crop\nproduction losses. With adequate planning and coordination, no crop losses were\nanticipated during the construction period.\n\n(viii)  The Government would periodically adjust the State procurement prices of cotton\nand  wheat  for  inflation,  changes  in  international  prices,  and  movements  in  the\nexchange  rate.  Given  that  a  double-digit  inflation  is  expected  to  continue  in  the\nmedium term, the State procurement prices would rapidly be eroded in real terms\nif the Government would not periodically adjust the prices for inflation. Therefore,\nfor as long as the State administers the procurement prices of cotton and wheat,\nthe State must ensure that adjustments for inflation would be made periodically,\nin  addition  to  adjustments  due  to  changes  in  the  international  prices  for  the\ncommodities  and  the  exchange  rate.  The  financial  viability  and  sustainability  of\nthe Project, including the profitability of the farms, will be seriously jeopardized if\nthe State allows inflation to erode the procurement prices in real terms.\n\n(ix) \n\nNo  provision  was  made  for  payment  of  dividends  to  shareholders.  This\nassumption  was  made  to  show  cash  balances  that  would  reflect  retained\nearnings fully.\n\n25. \nThe summary results of income and cash flow analysis for a representative cooperative\nfarm are shown in Table A9.1. Essentially, the cooperative farms were projected to have higher\nper ha expenses, including production and fixed costs, than the private farms. The cooperative\nfarms  are  expected  to  continue  with  a  large  permanent  labor.  With  the  expected  increases  in\nfertilizer prices to reach import parity levels, and increases in O&M costs for the irrigation and\ndrainage  systems,  the  total  expenses  of  the  cooperative  farms  were  estimated  to  climb  from\nSUM160,000/ha in year 1 to SUM226,000/ha in year 8 in constant 2001 prices. However, with\nthe  expected  improvement  in  international  prices  of  wheat  and  cotton,  coupled  with  the\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 9, page 8\n\nincreases in yields due to the Project, a typical cooperative farm with 3,000 ha area is expected\nto improve its profitability, from a loss of about SUM34.7 million in 2001 to a net income before\ndebt service in constant 2001 prices of SUM44.5 million in year 4, and SUM272.3 million in year\n8.  With  this  improvement  in  financial  performance,  the  large  farms  are  expected  to  have  the\ncapacity  to  pay  for  the  betterment  levy  for  on-farm  rehabilitation  over  a  20-year  period,  and\ngenerate  a  net  cash  flow  of  SUM121.5  million  in  year  8  and  thereafter.  The  debt  service\ncoverage ratio was estimated at 1.8 in year 8 and thereafter. The detailed farm budget analysis\nfor  a  representative  cooperative  farm  is  provided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  H  (Detailed\nFinancial and Economic Analysis).\n\n26. \nThe  summary  results  of  income  and  cash  flow  analysis  for  a  typical  small  private  farm\nwith  1,500  ha  area  are  shown  in  Table  A9.2.  For  such  small  private  farms,  per  ha  expenses\nwere estimated to rise from SUM143,000/ha in year 1 to SUM212,000/ha in year 8 in constant\n2001  prices.  The  private  farms  are  projected  to  improve  their  profitability  steadily  with  the\nimprovement in crop yields. Net incomes before debt service were calculated  to increase from\nSUM0.7  million  in  year  1  to  SUM13.0  million  by  year  8.  The  small  private  farms  are  also\nexpected to be able to pay for the betterment levy for on-farm rehabilitation cost over a period of\n20 years, starting from year 6. The debt service coverage ratio was estimated at 2.0 in year 8\nand thereafter, generating a net cash flow of about SUM6.7 million annually after debt service,\nin constant 2001 prices. The detailed farm budget analysis for a representative private farm is\nprovided in the Supplementary Appendix H (Detailed Financial and Economic Analysis).\n\nH. \n\nRates of Return on Rehabilitation of the Irrigation and Drainage Systems\n\nThe overall project investment is expected to generate a financial internal rate of return\n27. \n(FIRR) of 13.7 percent with a financial net present value of SUM2,035 million at a discount rate\nof  12  percent  per  annum.  With  economic  prices  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  domestic  price\nnumeraire,  the  overall  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the  Project  was  estimated  at\n26.2  percent  with  an  economic  net  present  value  of  SUM23,913  million.  The  significant  gap\nbetween the FIRR (13.7 percent) and EIRR (26.2 percent) is mainly due to the fact that in the\neconomic  analysis,  the  price  distortions  created  by  the  fixed  exchange  rate  policy  have  been\nremoved through the application of a shadow exchange rate factor of 2.0.\n\nI. \n\nSensitivity Analysis\n\n28. \nThe sensitivity of the FIRR and EIRR to decreases in yield and prices are presented in\nTable  A9.3.  The  sensitivity  of  the  FIRR  to  depreciation  of  the  exchange  rate  of  the  local\ncurrency to the dollar is shown in Table A9.4.\n\n29. \nIn the unlikely event, that the projected yields of cotton and wheat with the Project were\nreduced  by  10  percent  throughout  the  25-year  period,  the  FIRR  and  the  EIRR  of  the  Project\nwould reduce to 12.0 percent and 23.9 percent, respectively. When the projected cotton prices\nalone declined by 10 percent, the FIRR and the EIRR would decline to 11.9 percent and 23.0\npercent,  respectively.  Should  the  projected  wheat  prices  decline  by  10  percent,  the  FIRR  and\nthe EIRR of the Project would drop to 13.1 percent and 25.7 percent, respectively.\n\n30. \nIn  the  unlike  event  that  the  prices  of  both  cotton  and  wheat  decrease  by  10  percent\nsimultaneously,  the  FIRR  and  EIRR  would  decline  to  11.1  percent  and  23.3  percent\nrespectively.\n\n\f   63\n\nAppendix 9, page 9\n\nTable A9.1:  Typical Farm Budget\n Cooperative Farm, 3,000 ha\n('000 Sum in Constant 2001 Prices)\n\nItem\n\nYear 1\n\nYear 2\n\nYear 3\n\nYear 4\n\nYear 5\n\nYear 6\n\nYear 7\n\nYear  8-\n25\n\n445,123 490,784 554,007 631,158 719,458 820,598 889,496 949,227\n\n479,857 500,058 530,941 586,657 624,745 641,848 661,581 676,965\n94,713 178,750 227,915 272,262\n(34,734)\n91\n(12)\n226\n160\n\n(9,274)\n(3)\n167\n\n23,066\n8\n177\n\n44,500\n15\n196\n\n60\n214\n\n76\n221\n\n32\n208\n\nREVENUES, COSTS \n\nTotal Revenuesa\nTotal Costsb\nNet Income before debt service\nNet Income (before debt service) per ha\nTotal cost per ha\n\nCASH FLOW\n\nCash Inflow\n     Net Income before debt service\nCash Outflow\nNet Cash flow\nEnding Year Balance\nEstimated Debt Service Coverage Ratio c \na     The revenues from seed cotton, wheat, maize, fruit, vegetable, and alfalfa.\nb       This includes direct and indirect production costs.\nc      The ratio of net income (excluding depreciation, non-cash charges, interest and other charges on debt) against debt service including long-term           \n     loan principal repayments, and interest charges.\n\n94,713 178,750 227,915 272,262\n44,500\n0 150,727 150,727 150,727\n0\n44,500\n77,188 121,535\n28,023\n23,558 118,271 146,294 223,482 345,017\n\n(34,734)\n0\n(34,734)\n(34,734)\n\n23,066\n0\n23,066\n(20,942)\n\n(9,274)\n0\n(9,274)\n(44,008)\n\n94,713\n\n(0.6)\n\n(5.5)\n\n13.0\n\n4.6\n\n7.2\n\n1.2\n\n1.8\n\n1.5\n\nTable A9.2:  Typical Farm Budget\n Private Farm, 125 ha\n('000 Sum in Constant 2001 Prices)\n\nItem\n\nYear 1\n\nYear 2\n\nYear 3\n\nYear 4\n\nYear 5\n\nYear 6\n\nYear 7\n\nREVENUES, COSTS \n\nTotal Revenuesa\nTotal Costsb\nNet Income before debt service\nNet Income (before debt service) per ha\nTotal cost per ha\n\nCASH FLOW\n\n18,547\n\n17,822\n725\n6\n143\n\n20,449\n\n18,810\n1,640\n13\n150\n\n23,084\n\n20,242\n2,841\n23\n162\n\n26,298\n\n22,192\n4,107\n33\n178\n\n29,977\n\n23,924\n6,053\n48\n191\n\n34,192\n\n24,783\n9,409\n75\n198\n\n37,062\n\n25,750\n11,312\n90\n206\n\nCash Inflow\n     Net Income before debt service\nCash Outflow\nNet Cash flow\nEnding Year Balance\nEstimated Debt Service Coverage Ratio c \na     The revenues from seed cotton, wheat, maize, fruit, vegetable, and alfalfa.\nb       This includes direct and indirect production costs.\nc      The ratio of net income (excluding depreciation, non-cash charges, interest and other charges on debt) against debt service including long-term           \n     loan principal repayments, and interest charges.\n\n11,312\n6,280\n5,032\n23,526\n\n9,409\n6,280\n3,129\n18,494\n\n6,053\n0\n6,053\n15,366\n\n2,841\n0\n2,841\n5,206\n\n1,640\n0\n1,640\n2,364\n\n4,107\n0\n4,107\n9,312\n\n725\n0\n725\n725\n\n19.5\n\n11.6\n\n14.8\n\n1.8\n\n7.7\n\n4.3\n\n1.5\n\nYear  8-\n25\n\n39,551\n\n26,537\n13,014\n104\n212\n\n13,014\n6,280\n6,734\n30,259\n\n2.0\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 9, page 10\n\nThe sensitivity of the FIRR to depreciation of the local currency to the dollar was tested.\n31.\nIn  the  event  that  the  sum  experiences  a  20  percent  depreciation,  from  SUM345.00/$1  to\nSUM431.00/$1, the FIRR is expected to rise to 14.5 percent. The FIRR will rise to 15.4 percent\nwhen the local currency depreciates by 30 percent. Depreciation of the sum would cause prices\nin  sum  of  tradable  inputs  (such  as  equipment)  and  outputs  (wheat  and  cotton)  to  rise,  while\nprices in sum of nontradable inputs would lag behind. The overall prices of farm outputs (wheat\nand cotton) are more sensitive than input prices in general to the foreign exchange rate. The net\nimpact of the local currency depreciation against the dollar on the FIRR is favorable. Given the\ncurrently  overvalued  official  exchange  rate,  the  liberalization  of  the  foreign  exchange  rate\nregime would effectively lead to the depreciation of the local currency. The liberalization of the\nforeign exchange rate regime will have a substantial favorable impact on the financial conditions\nand profitability of the farms.\n\nTable A9.3: Switching Values for FIRR and EIRR\n\nItem\n\nBase\nCase (%)\n\n10%\nDecrease in\nboth Cotton\nand Wheat\nYields\n\n10%\nDecrease in\nCotton Price\n\n10%\nDecrease in\nWheat Price\n\n10%\nDecrease in\nboth Cotton\nand Wheat\nPrices\n\nFIRRa (%)\nEIRR (%)\n\n13.7\n\n26.2\n\n12.0\n\n23.9\n\n11.9\n\n23.9\n\n13.1\n\n25.7\n\n11.1\n\n23.3\n\n        EIRR = economic internal rate of return, FIRR = financial internal rate of return.\n        a  Includes all project investment costs.\n\nTable A9.4: Sensitivity of FIRRs to Local Currency Depreciation\n\nItem\n\nBase Case\n\n20 percent Sum\nDepreciation\n\n30 percent Sum\nDepreciation\n\nFIRRa  (%)\n\n13.7\n\n14.5\n\n15.4\n\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return.\na  Includes all project investment costs.\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 18 May 2001)\n", "Currency Unit\nSUM1.00\n$1.00\n", "Sum (SUM)\n$0.00285\nSUM351\n", "=\n=\n", "                                                               ABBREVIATIONS\n", "ADB\nAERP\nCAR\nCOM\nCOS\nEA\nEIRR\nFIRR\nha\nHAE\nICB\nIEE\nIPM\nkm\nMAWR\nMEU\nMMS\nMOF\nNPV\nO&M\nPIS\nPMO\nPSC\nPSO\nRAWD\nRBAC\nRCC\nRMP\nRRA\nt\nTA\nWG\nWUA \n", "-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n", "Asian Development Bank\nAgriculture Enterprises Restructuring Project\nCentral Asian Republic\nCabinet of Ministers\ncountry operational strategy\nexecuting agency\neconomic internal rate of return\nfinancial internal rate of return\nhectare\nHydrologic Amelioration Expedition\ninternational competitive bidding\ninitial environmental examination\nintegrated pest management\nkilometer\nMinistry of Agriculture and Water Resources\nmonitoring and evaluation unit\nMinistry of Macroeconomics and Statistics\nMinistry of Finance\nnet present value\noperation and maintenance\nproject implementation structure\nproject management office\nproject steering committee\nproject site office\nRayon Agriculture and Water Department\nrural business advisory center\nrayon (district) consultative committee\nrayon (district) machinery park\nRural Restructuring Agency\nton (metric)\ntechnical assistance\nworking group\nwater users\u2019 association\n", "NOTES\n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.\nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars.\n", "CONTENTS\n", "LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY\n", "MAP\n", "I.\n", "II.\n", "THE PROPOSAL\n", "INTRODUCTION\n", "III.\n", "BACKGROUND\n", "A.\nB.\nC.\nD.\nE.\nF.\n", "A.\nB.\nC.\nD.\nE.\nF. \nG. \nH. \n", "A.\nB.\nC.\n", "A.\nB.\nC.\n", "IV.\n", "THE PROPOSED PROJECT\n", "The Agriculture Sector\nGovernment Policies and Plans\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\nLessons Learned\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\nPolicy Dialogue\n", "Rationale\nObjectives and Scope\nCost Estimates\nFinancing Plan\nImplementation Arrangements\nThe Executing Agency\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\nTechnical Assistance\n", "V.\n", "PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n", "VI.\n", "ASSURANCES\n", "Financial and Economic Analyses\nEnvironment\nSocial Dimensions\n", "Specific Assurances\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness\nCondition for Disbursement\n", "VII.\n", "RECOMMENDATION\n", "APPENDIXES\n", "Page\n", "ii\n", "vi\n", "1\n", "1\n", "1\n", "1\n10\n11\n12\n13\n13\n", "14\n", "14\n15\n18\n19\n20\n24\n25\n26\n", "26\n", "26\n29\n29\n", "30\n", "30\n32\n32\n", "32\n", "33\n"]}
