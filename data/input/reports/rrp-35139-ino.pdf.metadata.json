The sample summary IEE is a core appendix. IEEs will \nbe undertaken for selected noncore subprojects. \n   \nProject Description  The Power Transmission Improvement Sector Project will comprise \nvarious  core  and  noncore  subprojects  that  add  360  megawatt-\namperes (MVA) of transformation capacity to remove substation \ncapacity bottlenecks in Java-Bali, and 276 kilometers of 150 kilovolt \n(kV)  transmission  line  to  interconnect  power  grids  in  the  outer \nislands. The Project will also create the necessary market facilities \nto establish and operate a competitive electricity market.  \n   \nRationale  Power  transmission  bottlenecks  in  Java  must  be  removed  and \nsome  small  power  grids  in  the  outer  islands  interconnected  to \nmaintain quality of power supply and improve efficiency. Further, \nthe new electricity law requires that within 5 years the price of \npower generated be set  on a competitive basis so the required \nfacilities for the power system and market operator have to be \ncreated in Java-Bali. \n   \nObjectives  The Project will (i) remove power supply bottlenecks in selected \npower substations and medium-voltage transmission lines in Java; \n(ii)  interconnect  outer  island  power  grids;  and  (iii)  provide \ninformation and communication technology (ICT)-based equipment \nfor  a  competitive  electricity  market  and  consulting  services  to \nsupervise its installation. \n   \nCost Estimates  Total project cost, including price contingencies and interest during \nconstruction, is estimated at $175 million, comprising foreign costs \nof $125.9 million (72%) and $49.1 million equivalent of local costs \n(18%).  \n   \nFinancing Plan  Source  Foreign  Local  Total  Total Cost \n($ million) ($ million) ($ million)  (%) \nADB  125.9  14.1  140.0  80 \nGovernment  0.0  35.0  35.0  20 \nand PLN \nTotal  125.9  49.1  175.0  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PLN = State Electricity Enterprise \n   \n ", "  iii \n   \nLoan Amount and  A loan of $140 million from the ordinary capital resources of the \nTerms  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The \nloan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-\nend fee of 1.0%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft Loan and Project Implementation Agreements.  \n   \nAllocation and  The proceeds of the ADB loan will be relent to the State Electricity \nRelending Terms  Enterprise (PLN) on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. PLN \nwill bear interest rate variation and foreign exchange risks on the \nloan. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2008 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 March 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Directorate  General  for  Electricity  and  Energy  Utilization  in  the \nMinistry of Energy and Mineral Resources of the Government of \nIndonesia  \n   \nImplementing Agency  PLN \n   \nImplementation  PLN  has  decentralized  day-to-day  operations  and  project \nArrangements  management to strategic business units (SBUs). A full-time sector \nproject director has been appointed to the PLN headquarters to \ncoordinate ADB-funded project implementation. The sector project \ndirector is supported by staff to coordinate specific functions, i.e., \nproject  implementation  and  schedule,  procurement,  design  and \nengineering,  environment,  land  acquisition,  and  compensation. \nSubproject managers will be appointed to the SBUs, and subproject \nteams  will  be  established  to  oversee  the  implementation  of \nindividual  subprojects.  PLN  will  assign  enough  qualified  and \nexperienced  staff  to  the  sector  project  director  and  subproject \nmanagers. ADB-funded consultants will assist PLN staff in project \nimplementation. \n \n   \n ", "iv   \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed under the Project will be carried out \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The various \nprocurement  threshold  limits  are  the  following:  (i)  international \ncompetitive bidding for (a) supply contracts of $500,000 or more; \nand  (b)  turnkey  contracts  packages  of  $1  million  or  more;  (ii) \ninternational shopping for supply contracts of $100,000\u2013500,000; \n(iii)  local  competitive  bidding  for  all  civil  works  contracts, \nconstruction  of  transmission  lines,  and  equipment  erection  of \n$100,000 to $1 million; and (iv) direct purchase for all contracts \nbelow $100,000. The local competitive bidding  procedures to be \nfollowed will be subject to ADB\u2019s approval. \n   \nConsulting Services  A sector project implementation consultant will be engaged by PLN \nunder  the  renewable  energy  development  sector  project  to  help \nsupervise the implementation of subprojects under it and this Project \nconcurrently.  \n \nAn  ICT  consultant  will  be  engaged  under  the  Project  to  help \nsupervise  the  installation  of  ICT-based  equipment.  The  ICT \nconsultant will be recruited by  PLN using quality- and cost-based \nselection  in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  ICT  consultant  will \nprovide an estimated 48 person-months of international consulting \nservices.  \n \nProject Benefits and  The Project will help remove supply bottlenecks in Java-Bali and \nBeneficiaries  integrate medium-sized power grids in the outer islands to help \nachieve economies of scale. The Project will improve economic \nproductivity in subproject areas by enhancing energy efficiency and \nreliability of power supply. The labor force, which includes the poor \nworking  in  the  informal  sectors,  will  be  assured  of  continued \nemployment. \n \nThe creation of an ICT-based competitive electricity market in Java-\nBali is central to the ongoing power sector restructuring program \nand  mandated  by  the  new  electricity  law.  The  competition and \nconsequent efficiency gain in power generation are envisioned to \nlower the bulk electricity price and bring it closer to the marginal \ncost, which will also lower the average retail electricity price. The \nlower retail price will bring a direct gain to all households connected \nto the power grid, including the poor. \n   \n ", "  v\nRisks and  Project  success  depends  on  (i)  the  Government's  approval  of \nAssumptions  revaluation of PLN\u2019s assets, and a gradual increase of electricity \ntariff from 2003; (ii) PLN\u2019s  decentralization and empowerment of \nSBUs;  and  (iii)  timely  preparation  of  required  documents  for \nsubproject  approval,  efficient  procurement,  and  project \nimplementation.  The  Government  has  assured  ADB  that  PLN's \nassets will be revalued and the tariff increased on time; and PLN \nhas approved the establishment of support functions for SBUs. The \nlast  condition  for  success  will  be  minimized  through  close \nmonitoring  and  ADB  review  missions.  The  Project  is  in  the \ninfrastructure  sector  with  revenue  in  the  domestic  currency, \nexposing the investment to the foreign exchange rate. Ongoing \nreforms aim at macroeconomic stability. Over the long run, power \nsector restructuring will allow managing the price risk through the \ncompetitive electricity market. Until this is possible, the Government \nwill gradually raise the electricity tariff to an appropriate level and \nreintroduce an automatic tariff adjustment mechanism to maintain \nfinancial viability. \n \n  The  timely  and  successful  implementation  of  the  competitive \nelectricity  market  is  subject  to  the  Government  maintaining  its \ncommitment  to  the  restructuring  and  implementation  schedule. \nAlthough  competitive  electricity  markets  have  developed  and \noperate successfully in several countries, international experience \nunderscores the risks related to market dominance and limitation on \nbilateral contracts. The design of the market in Indonesia takes into \naccount these factors and the specific features of the Java-Bali \npower system. The new electricity law provides 5 years to start \ncompetition in power generation. Provisions have also been made \nfor retail competition, which will be gradually introduced later. The \nGovernment  also  confirmed  that  the  regulatory  body  will  be \nestablished within 1 year in accordance with the electricity law to \nensure timely implementation of the competitive market and an \nindependent tariff regime.  \n \n ", " \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n  -1\n \ni\n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL   \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Power Transmission Improvement (PTI) Sector Project.  \n \n2.  At the request of the Government of Indonesia, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \napproved  a  project  preparation  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  power  transmission \nimprovement project.1 The project proposal was included in the Country Assistance Plan (2001-\n2003) and it is now titled the PTI Sector Project. The sector project framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES  \nA.  Power Sector Overview    \n3.  The formulation of power sector development policies is the responsibility of the Ministry \nof Energy and Mineral Resources, which discharges its control and regulatory functions through \nthe  Directorate  General  for  Electricity  and  Energy  Utilization  (DGEEU).  State  Electricity \nEnterprise (PLN) is responsible for developing and operating the power sector and serves over \n30 million consumers. The Ministry for State-Owned Enterprises exercises sole shareholder's \npowers on behalf of the Government. PLN's total installed power generation capacity reached \n21,000 megawatts (MW) in December 2001. PLN\u2019s operational assets also include 24,800 \ncircuit-kilometers  (cct-km)  of  transmission  lines;  substation  capacity  of  50,000  megavolt-\namperes (MVA); and medium- and low-voltage lines totaling 287,500 cct-km. The Java-Bali \npower grid has 74% of the installed capacity, with the rest spread over 1,100 power grids. \n \n4.  PLN's installed power generation capacity outside Java-Bali (the outer islands) is only \n5,270  MW  (2000),  and the total energy sale, 16.7 terawatt-hour (TWh) (2000). The area's \ngeographical features (islands and inhabited forests) have fragmented the power grid into small \nseparate grids, some with less than 10 MW capacity. Economies of scale are possible, and as \npower demand grows, the grids must interconnect. Increasing the size of the power grids allows \noperation of larger and more efficient power generation units. The south, central, and west \nSumatra power grids are being interconnected under an ongoing ADB loan.2  The power grid of \nEast Kalimantan has a capacity of 140 MW, and South Kalimantan, 340 MW; over 62% of \nenergy production is diesel-based. The interconnection of the two grids will help optimize \noperations, improve the reliability of power supply, and facilitate the transfer of 60 MW power \nfrom East to South Kalimantan instead of building a new power plant. \n  \n5.  Electricity is also generated by power plants with an aggregate capacity of about 12,000 \nMW. Large industries and businesses own and operate the plants, and PLN customers own \nabout half of these captive power plants, allowing these electricity users to buy power from PLN \nor generate their own. Since the plants are unregulated, sufficient data is not available to \ndetermine the actual amount of electricity used, or the impact of tariffs on PLN\u2019s power demand. \nIndependent power producers (IPPs), which are under contract to sell all their power output to \nPLN, have the capacity to generate another 3,000 MW. \n \n                                                 \n1  TA 3807-INO: Regional Power Transmission and Competitive Market Development, for $500,000, approved on 18 \nDecember 2001 and financed under the Japan Special Fund.  \n2  Loan 1397-INO: Power Development and Efficiency Enhancement Project, for $337 million ($176.61 net amount) \napproved on 24 October 1995.  \n ", "2  \n6.  PLN's  power  supply  extends  to  49,000  (84%)  of  58,000  villages,  and  53%  of  the \nestimated 52 million households are PLN\u2019s customers. The reliability of power supply has \ngenerally been better than in many other developing member countries (DMCs), and Java-Bali \nhas not experienced a system-wide power failure in the past 5 years despite PLN\u2019s financial \nproblems. Industrial and commercial customers find the electricity tariff competitive. Reduction \nof  the  subsidy  on  liquid  fuels3  will  increase  the  cost  of  self-generation  and  improve  the \ncompetitiveness of PLN's supply. \n \n7.  During 1998-2002, the capacity factor increased by about 3%, which indicates that the \nexisting power stations are generating more energy. The load factor has remained in the 67.5\u2013\n69.5% range, indicating that the growth in peak power demand has been normal. The tariff \nstructure for large consumers includes a multiplier to reflect a higher supply during evening \nhours. PLN has also introduced measures that allow it to negotiate lower tariffs to encourage \ndemand-side management. Although the average electricity tariff has risen significantly in recent \nyears, it still remains lower than alternate options, and so energy sales have not been affected \nmuch.  \n \nB.  Power Sector Development Plan \n8.  Until 1997, DGEEU and PLN regularly prepared power sector development plans to \nreflect an annual energy sales growth rate of about 12%, and resources were mobilized to \nimplement these plans. Although the plans were optimistic, PLN could acquire resources to \nimplement new  projects. In 1997, about 70% surplus generation capacity was available and \nseveral new power generation projects were under implementation, some by IPPs. The crisis \nhad two significant impacts: (i) the growth of energy sales slowed, reducing the urgency to add \nnew power generation capacity; and (ii) the electricity tariffs could only be gradually raised to \nreflect increased cost of electricity supply, so financial performance results of PLN were poor \nand  it  could  not  borrow  for  capital  investment.  These  factors  introduced  considerable \nuncertainties in the power sector planning process, and available resources barely allowed PLN \nto complete ongoing projects.  \n \n9.  The situation has gradually changed. The annual energy sales growth is now about \n10%, and although the economic forecasts still lack clarity, PLN has prepared power demand \nprojections  corresponding  to  annual  economic  growth  of  3.5\u20136.0%  and  an  increase  in \nelectrification ratio4 from 53% to 75% by 2010. A summary of the power development plan, i.e., \nthe forecast of demand growth and capacity additions required in the power sector, is in \nAppendix 2. The electricity tariff was gradually raised during 2000\u20132002, and the Government \nplans to keep raising it to a level of full cost recovery and a reasonable rate of return by 2005. \nThe projected higher electricity sales revenue will allow PLN to meet the operating costs \n(including power purchase from IPPs) and borrow funds for the new investment required to \nsatisfy power demand growth. A delay in new investment will reduce the reliability of PLN\u2019s \npower supply, and the Java-Bali power grid could have a power shortfall by 2005. To address \nsuch concerns, large consumers may decide to implement new captive power plants, which \nwould be a less efficient and environment-friendly outcome. \n                                                 \n3  The competitiveness of PLN\u2019s supply can be established because of the low barrier for installing captive power \nplants. If large customers assign a low value to the supply, they will use self-generation, reducing PLN\u2019s energy \nsales.  \n4  The electrification ratio is the number of households connected to PLN supply divided by the total number of \nhouseholds. \n ", "  3\nC.  Power Sector Policies    \n10.  Based on the Government\u2019s Power Sector Restructuring Policy (August 1998), ADB \napproved a policy-based program loan (the Program) and the associated capacity-building loan \n(TA Loan).5 The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) also approved a loan of $400 \nmillion, disbursed in two equal tranches, and linked to the release of the two program loan \ntranches. The first program loan tranche of $200 million was disbursed in March 1999 and the \nBoard's approval is being sought for the release of the second tranche following the enactment \nand promulgation of the Electricity Law 20 on 23 September 2002.6 \n \n11.  The Program seeks to make the power sector more efficient and financially viable by \nestablishing a competitive electricity market in Java-Bali. The new electricity law provides the \nnecessary legal framework. The law allows ventures to obtain licenses for different functions: \ngeneration, transmission, distribution, sales (only for low-voltage consumers), sales agency (for \nhigh-  and  medium-voltage  consumers  and  may  include  low-voltage  consumers),  market \noperation,  and  system  operation.  The  various  ventures  will  be  undertaken  separately  by \ndifferent enterprises, which will prevent reintegration and limit the market power of participants. \nThe electricity generation ventures will be subject to competition and are specifically prohibited \nfrom acquiring market dominance. The transmission and distribution ventures will be recognized \nas natural monopolies, but will be required to provide open access with tariff regulated by the \npower market supervisory agency (the regulatory body) that will be established within 1 year. \nElectricity supply ventures and supply agencies will buy electricity from the electricity market or \nthrough bilateral contracts and sell to consumers. The market organizer will determine electricity \nmarket prices and the system operator will match supply and demand according to market rules \nset by the regulatory body. The market organizer and system operator will be accountable and \nimpartial  to,  and  financed  by  charges  paid  by,  the  market  participants.  The  transmission \nventure, market operation, and system operation will first be integrated and later separated as \nbusiness activities grow. The new electricity law also stipulates that the electricity sales price for \ngeneration and for medium- and high-voltage consumers will be based on natural and sound \ncompetition.  Based  on  the  consensus  reached  in  the  House  of  Representatives  (DPR), \ncompetition will start in power generation within 5 years. Based on the progress made during \nthis period, the electricity law will allow the regulatory body to extend licenses to interested sales \nagents. These agents can also start buying electricity form the market once it is established and \nsell to some medium- and high-voltage consumers on a competitive basis. In the absence of \nsales agents, however, the regulatory body will set the electricity price for all the consumers.  \n \nD.  Implementing Agency     \n1.  State  Electricity  Enterprise  (PLN)  Reorganization  and  Community \nDevelopment \n12.  PLN  has  a  two-tier  management  with  a  five-member  board  of  commissioners  of \nnominated government officials, and a five-member full-time board of directors lead by the \npresident  director.  The  management  is  fully  responsible  for  formulating  and  implementing \ncorporate strategies and business plans for utility operations, investments, finance, and human \nresources. Independent auditors review and submit a report on the company\u2019s annual financial \nstatements.  PLN  will  retain  its  primary  license  for  power  generation,  transmission,  and \n                                                 \n5  Loan 1673-INO: Power Sector Restructuring Program, for $380 million, and Loan 1674-INO: Capacity Building for \nEstablishment of a Competitive Electricity Market, for $20 million, both approved on 23 March 1999.  \n6   Indonesia: Progress Report of the Power Sector Restructuring Program (Loan 1673-INO), planned for Board \nconsideration on a no objection basis by 9 December 2002. \n ", "4  \ndistribution until the enterprise is unbundled in accordance with the new electricity law. PLN has \n(i) two wholly owned subsidiaries that own and operate the power plants in Java-Bali; (ii) one \npower  transmission  unit  in  Java-Bali;  (iii)  two  operation  units  in  Sumatra  responsible  for \ngeneration and transmission; (iv) 16 regional operation units7 in the outer islands and four power \ndistribution units  in  Java;  and  (v)  several  support  services  for  engineering,  construction, \nproduction, etc. PLN is being reorganized in anticipation of the structural changes. A World \nBank-funded  international  consulting  firm  is  assisting  PLN  in  financial  and  organizational \nrestructuring.  \n \n13.  To  facilitate  the  transition  to  an  unbundled  power  sector,  the  focus  now  is  on \ndecentralization and empowerment of operational units by making them strategic business units \n(SBUs). The corporate office, which earlier made all decisions in operational and investment-\nrelated matters, is now transforming itself as a \u201cholding company\u201d with SBUs as \u201cvirtual\u201d \nsubsidiaries. During the past 2 years, many corporate staff have been relocated to SBUs. SBU \ngeneral managers now exercise full responsibility for energy sales, including the expansion of \nthe distribution network. The larger generation and transmission projects are implemented \nunder the direct control of the corporate office. However, in the next phase of decentralization, \nSBU  managers  will  share  responsibility  for  procurement  and  be  fully  responsible  for  the \nimplementation of all the projects in their respective regions. SBUs will eventually have the \nflexibility to negotiate agreements for power purchase at the local level based on projected \nenergy  sale  and  revenue.  With  the  strengthening  of  managerial  capacity,  SBUs  are  well \npositioned to coordinate the development and management of the regional power sector with \nthe provincial and regency governments. When local governments establish their financial \ncapacity to invest in regional development and are prepared to adjust the regional electricity \ntariffs to reflect the full cost of the power supply in the region, SBUs are envisaged to be \nseparated from PLN as jointly owned subsidiaries. The new electricity law allows such vertically \nintegrated power companies in the outer islands to be owned by the private sector. Like any \nnetwork industry, economies of scale are available in the power sector. While administrative \ndecentralization may transfer authority to nearly 400 regencies and cities, fragmentation of the \npower sector is not advisable.  \n   \n14.  PLN  has  adopted  another  three  programs  to  directly  benefit  the  poor  and  small \nconsumers: (i) the rural business service, which has benefited 75,000 small entrepreneurs and \nhelped create 29,000 jobs for villagers; (ii) the rural electrification loan, which provides low-\ninterest loans to poor households unable to pay the new connection charge (about Rp60 billion \nto 781,000 consumers); and (iii) the program to empower small businesses and cooperatives, \nwhich extends loans for working capital, and grants for training, quality improvement, and \nmarketing to small businesses and cooperatives (about Rp207 billion\u2014Rp173 billion as loans \nand Rp34 billion as pledges\u2014to over 43,000 units). With its improved financial results, PLN \nallocated Rp13 billion to the scheme in 2002 and 2003.  \n \n2.  PLN Financial Management \n15.  PLN\u2019s financial strategy is based on strict budget control over SBUs and operational \nunits, stringent cash flow norms to maintain a reasonable level of power supply within the \nfinancial constraints, proposals to gradually increase tariff levels for Government approval, \n                                                 \n7  The regional operation units, or  wilayahs, in the outer islands have relatively lower annual energy sales (1.5 \nterawatt-hours [TWh]) and number of consumers (870,000). Being small, the regional operation units need to \noperate as vertically integrated utilities.  \n ", "  5\ndetermination of the subsidy necessary to offset the partial cost recovery from small consumers, \nand efficient energy billing and bill collection.  \n \n16.  A  detailed  analysis  of  PLN  financial  performance  is  in  Appendix  3.  The  main \ncomponents  of  operating  costs  are  power  purchase,  fuel  and  lubricants,  maintenance, \npersonnel, and depreciation. The trend for these and other important operational parameters is \nbetter than that in other DMC utilities, particularly the low energy losses (11.5\u201313.5%) and \nreceivables (33-40 days). The debt service cost for foreign currency loans acquired before the \ncrisis is now higher and, based on the policy of the early 1990s, PLN now buys more power \nfrom IPPs instead of investing in new power generation capacity.8 It avoided incurring larger \ndebt to build about 3,000 MW of new capacity. \n \n17.  PLN has pursued an efficiency improvement program based on an operational and \ncapital expenditure audit carried out by international experts in 1999. All units were assigned \nloss reduction targets, which involved several actions such as reduction of fuel consumption, \ninventory levels, maintenance costs, and the billing cycle. Steps were also taken for customer \nvoltage improvement, load balancing, and efficient procurement of spares and consumables. \nPLN estimates that the resultant savings in 2001 were Rp1 trillion. \n \n18.  Under the 1985 electricity law, the Government sets the electricity tariff for various \nconsumer categories to allow PLN to recover all its costs. While this had not been particularly \ndifficult until 1997, the Government has faced a challenge since then in raising tariffs to adjust \nfor  the  higher  costs.  Wider  support  and  greater  transparency  are  now  needed,  including \ndiscussions in the DPR. A sharp increase in electricity tariff would be inflationary, reduce \ndomestic  savings,  and  thus  slow  economic  recovery.  Despite  the  difficulties,  the  average \nrevenue from electricity sales has increased from Rp211 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in 1999 (when \nADB appraised the Program loan) to Rp437/kWh in June 2002. To offset a lower tariff for small \nhouseholds (decided by DPR), a subsidy of Rp6.7 trillion covering a period of 3 years was \ntransferred to PLN in 2001.  \n \n19.  Another correction remains for PLN to incorporate in its balance sheet. The net asset \nvalue does not reflect the fair replacement value. The Government and PLN are discussing a \nproposal to revalue the assets to increase the net asset value from Rp54 trillion to about Rp173 \ntrillion on 1 January 2002. The asset revaluation will attract a one-time tax, which may be \nspread over 5 years, and increase annual provisions for depreciation. The higher charges will \ncause PLN to incur a loss in 2002 and 2003, although the cash generation (addition of net \nincome and depreciation) is not expected to change significantly. \n \nE.  ADB\u2019s Strategy in the Power Sector \n20.  DMCs should make more energy available in a least-cost and environment-friendly \nmanner, and improve access to it for all, particularly the poor. Mobilizing the required resources \nwill require establishing greater transparency and a competitive environment to promote private \nsector  investment,  and  increasing  supply-  and  demand-side  efficiencies.  Energy  sector \ndevelopment must also be environmentally sustainable. Regional and global environmental \nimpacts must thus be mitigated and greater use of renewable energy sources encouraged. To \nensure that its future operations reflect these requirements, ADB prioritizes reducing poverty, \npromoting private sector involvement, addressing regional and global environmental impacts, \n                                                 \n8  The share of purchased energy has increased from 2% in 1997 to 15% in 2001.  \n ", "6  \nand promoting regional cooperation. ADB interventions take into account the varying physical \nfeatures, resource endowments, and economic standards of DMCs.  \n \n21.  The 1999 Program loan to Indonesia will be fully disbursed in 2002. The next significant \nchange will take place at end-2007, when the competitive electricity market will be established \nin  Java-Bali.  ADB  is  envisaged  to  consider  another  policy-based  loan  to  support  market \ndevelopment.  \n \nF.  Lessons Learned \n22.  Based on implementation experience of recent projects, particular attention will be given \nto (i) availability of counterpart funds, (ii) security concerns that delay project implementation, \n(iii) streamlined internal procedures for selection of contractors, and (iv) timely availability of the \nright-of-way for transmission lines.  \n \n23.  Counterpart funds have become significantly more available with the increase in the \nelectricity tariff, which will eventually be high enough to generate sufficient cash for operation \nand  capital  expenditure  without  budgetary  support.  PLN  decentralization  will  allow  field \nmanagers to closely monitor project implementation and take timely corrective steps when \nnecessary. Closer working ties with provincial and regency governments will help address \nsecurity concerns; and right-of-way issues will be addressed by preparing the land acquisition \nand resettlement plans (LARPs) using a participatory process.  \n \n24.  PLN is the Implementing Agency for two ongoing projects9 that are classified as \"at risk\": \n(i)  the  1993  Power  XXIII  project,  which  includes  the  implementation  of  the  86  MW  Musi \nhydropower  project  in  southern  Sumatra;  and  (ii)  the  1995  project,  which  includes \nimplementation of 522 km of a 275 kilovolt (kV) transmission line in Sumatra, and the 86 MW \nPeusangan hydropower project in Aceh Province in Sumatra. The Musi hydropower project's \nconstruction  was  suspended  in  December  1997  along  with  that  of  a  large  number  of \ninfrastructure projects to limit export credit borrowings. In August 2000, considering that most of \nthe civil works had been completed, ADB approved the use of loan savings to substitute the \nexport credit to build the power plant, albeit considerably delayed. PLN is now evaluating the \nbids for the equipment packages, and contract award is expected by end-2002. Transmission \nline construction in Sumatra was considerably delayed because of difficulties in obtaining the \nright of way. By August 2002, 87% of the length had been completed. In June 2002, the district \nadministration took the lead in finalizing amicable settlements with the affected people, which is \nhelping in the construction of the remaining section. Commissioning of all transmission lines is \nplanned by end-2002. In Peusangan, however, little site work has been possible because of \nsecurity concerns in Aceh. The Government is unable to unilaterally suspend the project as that \nwould adversely influence the ongoing political efforts to find a basis for sharing all resources.10 \nThrough collaborative efforts of the Government, provincial government, and the military, a \nsecurity action plan was prepared in June 2002, and is considered acceptable by prospective \ncivil works contractors. PLN will seek JBIC's approval to rebid the civil works contract and \nextend the loan closing date to 2008, and request an extension of the ADB loan. These steps \nprovide an opportunity to implement the Peusangan hydropower project, which will help avoid \npower shortage in the province and promote balanced regional development, which were the \n                                                 \n9 Loan 1271-INO: Power XXIII Project, for $275 million ($201.89 million net amount after cancellations), approved in \nNovember 1993; and Loan 1397-INO (footnote 2).  \n10  The Aceh government supports the project, and the additional power generation capacity is needed to avoid \nsevere power shortages. JBIC is cofinancing the front-end civil works and consulting services, and its loan is also \nopen. \n ", "  7\nADB loan's objectives. The long delay in implementing the three project components will keep \nimplementation progress as only partly satisfactory, and so the projects will technically be \nconsidered \"at risk.\" However, when completed, the projects will provide the urgently needed \ninfrastructure to mitigate power shortage in different parts of Sumatra. \n \nG.  External Assistance \n25.  External assistance (Appendix 4) has played a key role in expanding PLN\u2019s power \nsupply system and diversifying its generation mix. Although the private sector will be playing an \nincreasing role in expanding power generation, PLN will continue to invest significantly in the \ntransmission and distribution systems, and will continue to need assistance from multilateral and \nbilateral sources.  \n \n26.  Since 1970, ADB has approved 28 energy sector projects in Indonesia with a combined \nvalue of $3.13 billion for the power sector and a gas transmission project. ADB has also given \nIndonesia 37 TA grants totaling over $13.6 million for studies on hydropower and geothermal \npower  development,  rural  and  renewable  energy  development,  environmental  impact \nassessment, energy efficiency, human resource planning, coal sector policy, gas utilization, gas \nregulatory framework, electricity tariffs, strategic planning, etc. \n \n27.  ADB has coordinated its operations in the power sector with other agencies, particularly \nthe World Bank and JBIC, on efficiency improvement, cost recovery, private sector involvement, \nand restructuring. The World Bank has provided 29 energy sector loans since 1969, with a \ncombined value of $5.01 billion. The World Bank fielded a pre-appraisal mission in September \n2002 for an energy sector project proposal to be considered for approval in early 2003, which \nincludes, (i) about $90 million for critical transmission de-bottlenecking projects, (ii) about $25 \nmillion for information system to support PLN's reorganization, and (iii) about $2 million for \ninstitutional strengthening. JBIC has provided 127 overseas development assistance (ODA) \nprojects in the energy sector for a total of about $4.6 billion equivalent, and 14 non-ODA \nprojects for a total of about $3.6 billion equivalent. Further JBIC assistance to resume the \nimplementation of the IPP-owned Tanjung Jati B power plant (1,320 MW) is expected by end-\n2002.  \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n28.  The Project will (i) remove power supply bottlenecks in selected power substations and \nmedium-voltage transmission lines in Java-Bali, (ii) interconnect outer-island power grids, and \n(iii) provide information and communication technology (ICT)-based equipment for a competitive \nelectricity market and consulting services to supervise its installation. \n \n29.  The Java-Bali power grid subprojects will add power transformers (360 MW), switchyard \nbays (37), indoor switchgear feeders (48), 150 kV transmission lines (upgrading 113 km and \nconstructing  129  km),  and  capacitors  (120  megavolt-ampere-reactive  [MVAr])  to  remove \nbottlenecks in power supply to major load centers with increasing power demand, which are in \nJakarta, Serang in West Java, Bandung and Semarang in Central Java, and Malang in East \nJava.  The  augmentation  of  substation  capacity  will  avoid  adverse  impacts  from  power \ninterruption caused by substation overload, or low voltage supply. The installed capacity of the \npower  grid  in  East  Kalimantan  is  140  MW,  and  in  South  Kalimantan,  340  MW.  The \n ", "8  \ninterconnection with the 276 km transmission line will help realize economies of scale, provide \noperational flexibility, and maximize the use of resources.  \n \n30.  The ICT component will include the information technology (IT) system needed to \noperate the competitive electricity market. Once the Java-Bali electricity market is operational, \nthe power sector will be deregulated (retail price and entry will be depend on supply and \ndemand), thus allowing access to the private sector without government guarantees. The \nmarket rules have been developed and a suitable financial settlement system is being prepared \nunder the ADB-funded TA loan (footnote 5). An international consultant is also being selected \nunder another component of the TA Loan to prepare the specifications for the computer \nsoftware and hardware of the IT system, which will be used to procure the goods and services \nunder the Project\u2019s ICT component.  \n \nB.  Subprojects \n31.  Core  subprojects  have  been  identified  using  agreed-on  selection  criteria.  The \nsubprojects will be implemented immediately after ADB approves the Project and the loan \nbecomes effective.11 The core subprojects are the (i) Java-Bali power grid category: extension \nof 150 kV substations in Cianjur and Kebonagung, and installation of four capacitors having an \naggregate capacity of 120 MVAr; and (ii) power grid interconnection category: Barikin-Tanjung \n150 kV transmission line.  \n \n32.  PLN will select the noncore subprojects that also satisfy the agreed-on selection criteria. \nIt has identified several noncore subprojects and the list with the salient features is in Appendix \n5, Table A5.2. In case the priority changes during project implementation, PLN may substitute or \nadd other subprojects that also meet the selection criteria. PLN will seek ADB\u2019s approval to use \nloan proceeds to implement the noncore subprojects by submitting documents satisfactory to \nADB:12 the executive summary of feasibility report, including cost estimate, contract package \nlist,  implementation  schedule;  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  summary  IEE \n(SIEE);13 social assessment and poverty analysis; LARP; and a brief note establishing that the \nselected noncore subproject satisfy the relevant selection criteria.14  \n \n33.  The following selection criteria will apply to subprojects in the Java-Bali power grid: \n \n(i)  Based on power demand forecasts, the noncore subproject will prevent loading \nof an existing power transformer at a substation to more than 80% of its rated \ncapacity during the following 2 years, or avoid a reduction of substation voltage \nby 10% based on power system load flow analysis. \n(ii)  The subproject will be near a major load center in Java-Bali. \n(iii)  The subproject will be part of the least-cost development plan. \n(iv)  Implementation will be completed within the project implementation period. \n                                                 \n11  PLN may initiate procurement of the ICT-based goods and services also after the loan approval; however, it will still \nneed ADB's approval for the bidding documents. \n12  The documentation prepared for the core subproject before loan approval will serve as a sample for the non-core \nsubprojects. \n13 IEE/SIEE will be required for the new 150 kV transmission lines and associated substations.  \n14  Incase PLN requires to substitute or add noncore subprojects (not included in Appendix 5, Table A5.2), economic \nand financial analysis will also be provided to ADB. \n ", "  9\n(v)  Submission of a complete environmental screening checklist when an IEE need \nnot be submitted.15  \n \n34.  The following are selection criteria for power grid interconnection subprojects: \n \n(i)  Two power grids should interconnect, one of which should have reasonable \nspare generation capacity to share with the other. \n(ii)  The subproject will be part of the least-cost development plan for a particular \npower grid and will be financially and economically viable. \n(iii)  The implementation will be completed within the project implementation period. \n \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Tariff and Subsidy \n35.  The Government approved a package of measures to restructure PLN\u2019s balance sheet16 \nbut the electricity tariff is still below the cost of service. In consultation with DPR, the tariff has \nbeen increased by 6% at the start of every quarter in 2002.17 The Government agreed to \nincrease the annual average tariff in 2003 and 2004 to reach an economical level of tariff in \n2005 so that PLN will recover all costs and generate sufficient cash for new investments. To \nprevent erosion of PLN's revenue in real terms and to make the tariff more transparent, formula-\nbased automatic tariff adjustments will be made every quarter starting 1 January 2006 taking \ninto account changes in input costs from inflation, changes in fuel prices, and exchange rate.   \n \n36.  The average tariff for small consumers is Rp261/kWh, or about 40% lower than the \noverall average tariff. PLN plans to maintain the lifeline tariff targeted to the small household \nconsumers (450 volt-ampere [VA]), or households in the lowest 20-percentile income bracket. \nThe tariff for these households is expected to remain 30% lower than the average electricity \ntariff for the household consumer category. \n \n2.  Power Sector Restructuring \n37.  The Government will expedite execution of the measures envisaged under the new \nelectricity law and also revise the 1998 Power Sector Restructuring Policy to bring it in line with \nthe electricity law, particularly its implementation schedule and new organization structure for \nthe power sector in Java-Bali. Under the new electricity law, the regulatory body has to be \nestablished  by  September  2003,  and  competition  in  generation  should  commence  by \nSeptember  2007.  The  Government  has  assured  ADB  that  the  regulatory  body  will  be \nestablished and procurement of ICT-based equipment for the competitive market carried out \naccordingly.18 The Government has also assured ADB that the market rules and the supporting \nfinancial system will be approved by the regulatory body by June 2004.   \n                                                 \n15  The format of the environmental screening check-list was provided to PLN. It includes the aspects that are \nconsidered when ADB does environmental classification of hydropower project proposals.  \n16  The restructuring related to PLN's failure to service  the high-cost Government loans; the unpaid principal amount \n(Rp5.3  trillion)  was  converted  into  a  new  20-year  loan  (including  a  2-year  grace  period)  with  4%  annual \nadministrative charge; and the unpaid interest (Rp15.7 trillion) and penalty (Rp13.0 trillion) were converted to \nequity. \n17  The average revenue from electricity sales will increase to Rp497/kWh ($0.051/kWh) by December 2002. The \nlarge low-voltage consumers in all categories will be paying $0.08\u20130.09/kWh. Consumers also pay a streetlight tax \nequal to 3\u201310% of the energy bill, which is transferred to the regency. \n18  The procurement has to be timed so that the ICT-based system becomes operational at the same time as the \ncommencement of the power generation market, and vendor support is available during the initial period. \n ", "10  \n \n3.  Changing Strategic Business Units to Power Companies  \n38.  The new electricity law requires establishing electricity generation ventures that do not \nenjoy market dominance. The Government will thus unbundle PLN's assets in Java-Bali, which \nwill involve separating the SBUs into separate legal entities. The transmission SBU will be \nseparated and will initially be responsible for transmission, system, and market operations. The \nGovernment  has  assured  ADB  that  these  separate  companies  (including  the  Java-Bali \ntransmission company) will be established by December 2005. \n \n4.  Corporate Governance \n39.  PLN  is  conscious  of  the  acute  need  for  strong  corporate  governance,  given  the \nGovernment\u2019s increased emphasis on it in the aftermath of the economic crisis,19 and as a \ncorollary to the reorganization of PLN under the new electricity law.  \n \n40.  The April 2001 statement of PLN\u2019s president commissioner in the 2000 annual report, \nwhich notes that PLN must \u201cpractice good corporate governance,\u201d has been followed up in 2002 \nin two substantive forms.  First, as between PLN and one of its wholly owned subsidiaries \nresponsible for more than 50% of power generation in Java-Bali, a pilot project has been started \nwith the assistance of international experts. The pilot project seeks to establish an internal \ncorporate governance framework designed for operational and investment decisions within a \ndecentralized structure. The framework will be applied to the operations of the holding company \nand SBUs in the reorganized PLN. \n \n41.  Second, in April 2002, PLN began drafting an internal good corporate governance code \nthat sets qualitative standards for business management, including tackling corruption. The \ngood corporate governance code will be tailored to PLN\u2019s needs and allow refinement by the \nGovernment based on international consulting input.20 Deliberations have been held by the PLN \nboard  of  directors,  and  a  task  force  has  been  established  to  draft  the  good  corporate \ngovernance code by October 2002.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n42.  The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies and interest during \nconstruction, is estimated at $175.0 million, comprising foreign costs of $125.9 million (72%) \nand $49.1 million equivalent of local costs (28%). The project cost includes the estimated costs \nof core subprojects and noncore subprojects and the ICT-based equipment (Table 1, 2002 \nprices).  \n \n                                                 \n19  See the Government\u2019s establishment of the National Committee of Corporate Governance.  \n20  The Government has access to such international consulting services input under Loan 1866-INO: State-Owned \nEnterprise Governance and Privatization Program for $400 million, approved on 4 December 2001.  \n ", "  11\nTable 1: Estimated Project Cost \n($ million) \n \nItem  Foreign Cost  Local Cost  Total Cost \nJava-Bali Power Grid  59.6  16.3  75.9 \nInterconnection of Power  29.4  10.7  40.1 \nGrids \nICT  21.0  4.0  25.0 \nConsulting Services  1.3  0.2  1.5 \nSubtotal  111.3  31.2  142.5 \nTaxa  0.0  14.3  14.3 \nFront-End Fee  1.4  0.0  1.4 \nPrice Contingencyb  2.8  0.8  3.6 \nIDCc  10.4  2.8  13.2 \nTotal  125.9  49.1  175.0 \nICT = information and communication technology, IDC = interest during construction  \nNote: \na  Value added tax computed as 10% of foreign and local costs.  \nb  Price contingency computed on the basis of 2.5% on base cost. \nc  Includes commitment charge. \nSource: PLN estimates. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n43.  The Government has requested a loan of $140 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate  \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of \n1.00% (the fee will be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft Loan and Project Implementation Agreements. The Government has provided ADB \nwith (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the \nbasis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were the \nGovernment's  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  under  the  influence  of  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The Borrower will be the Government. The proceeds of the \nADB loan will be relent to PLN in dollar and other terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. PLN \nwill bear interest rate variation and foreign exchange risks on the loan.  \n \n44.  Proceeds of the proposed ADB loan will be utilized for (i) foreign currency cost and 45% \nof local currency cost (other than land and buildings) for power grid subprojects, (ii) foreign \ncurrency cost and 45% of local currency cost for ICT-based goods and services, (iii) foreign \ncurrency cost and 50% of local currency cost for consulting services provided by the ICT \nconsultant; (iv) up-front fee, and (v) interest during construction and commitment charge for the \nADB loan. For contracts for civil works, disbursement will be limited to 90% of the contract \nvalue. The Government and PLN will provide counterpart funds to meet 55% of the local \ncurrency cost of the power grid subprojects, and ICT, which will include cost of land acquisition, \nbuildings,  and  taxes  for  all  subprojects;  and  50%  of  the  local  currency  cost  of  the  ICT \nconsultant. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n \n \n ", "12  \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  Total Cost \n      (%) \nAsian Development Bank  125.9  14.1  140.0  80 \nGovernment and PLN  0.0  35.0  35.0  20 \nTotal  125.9  49.1  175.0  100 \nPLN = State Electricity Enterprise \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n45.   The Government has sought assistance to meet part of the local Project cost. The \nGovernment needs to support the power sector during 2003-2004, i.e., till the tariff remains \nbelow the economic level; whereas a deferment of the Project could cause power supply \ndislocation.  The high ADB cost-sharing ratio is justified given the current fiscal situation of the \nGovernment and the pro-poor nature of the Project (para 64). Although a modest economic \nrecovery has been experienced, the fiscal situation remains under severe stress. \n \n46.  When PLN is unbundled, the assets financed under the loan will need to be transferred \nto successor transmission and distribution companies in Java-Bali. To facilitate this transfer, \nADB's agreement will be sought and arrangements acceptable to ADB put in place to ensure \nthat project implementation and operation continue satisfactorily, including the servicing of debt \nand compliance to other loan conditions. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements   \n1.  Project Management and Consultation \n47.  DGEEU will be the Executing Agency as it is responsible for approval of electricity tariffs \nand implementation of power sector restructuring, which are two critical aspects of the Project. \nDGEEU also has administrative control over PLN, which will be the Implementing Agency. PLN \nhas established SBUs at the regional level to manage day-to-day project implementation and \nensure  achievement  of  project  performance  targets.  PLN  will  establish  the  necessary \ncoordinating functions at the head office to facilitate effective operation of SBUs.  \n \n48.  The project management will follow the decentralized setup of PLN. A sector project \ndirector has been appointed at the headquarters to coordinate all the activities related the \nimplementation of the two sector projects.   The sector project director and staff will coordinate \n(i) project implementation and schedule, (ii) procurement, (iii) design and engineering, (iv) \nenvironment, (v) land acquisition, and (vi) compensation. A subproject manager has been \nappointed  at  each  SBU  and  subproject  teams  will  be  established  to  oversee  individual \nsubproject implementation. The sector project implementation consultant (PIC), engaged by \nPLN  under  the  renewable  energy  development  sector  project,  will  help  implement  all  the \nsubprojects under the two sector projects. 21 An ICT consultant will be engaged under  the \nProject to supervise the installation of the computer software and hardware equipment needed \nto operate the competitive electricity market. \n \n                                                 \n21  The  Project  and  the  renewable  energy  development  sector  project  will  be  implemented  concurrently.  The \neffectiveness of Project implementation supervision will be better with one consultant being responsible for all \nactivities related to power generation and transmission grid. \n ", "  13\n2.  Period of Implementation \n49.  Power demand is projected to increase in the major load centers in Java-Bali, and early \ncompletion of the subprojects will avoid deterioration of the quality and reliability of the power \nsupply. The Project will be implemented from April 2003 to March 2008.22  \n \n3.  Procurement \n50.   All procurement to be financed under the Project will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The following are the threshold limits of various types of \nprocurement: (i) international competitive bidding for (a) supply contracts estimated to cost \n$500,000 or more; and (b) turnkey contracts packages, $1 million or more; (ii) international \nshopping for supply contracts, $100,000\u2013500,000; (iii) local competitive bidding for all civil works \ncontracts, construction of transmission lines, and equipment erection, from $100,000 to $1 \nmillion; and (iv) direct purchase for all contracts, below $100,000. The local competitive bidding \nprocedures to be followed will be subject to ADB\u2019s approval. The list of contract packages for \nthe core subprojects is in Appendix 5, Table A5.1. \n \n51.  PLN will recruit the ICT consultant using quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) in \naccordance with ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants. It is estimated that 48 \nperson-months of international consulting services will be provided. An outline of the TOR for \nthe consulting services and cost estimate are in Appendix 6.   \n \n52.  PLN initiated advance procurement action, and ADB reviewed and commented on \nthe  draft  bidding  documents  for  the  core  subprojects.23  PLN  has  been  informed  that \napproval for advance procurement action does not commit ADB to approve the proposed \nloan, and the contracts should be finalized only when the loan is approved and made \neffective.  \n \n4.  Disbursement Arrangements   \n53.  Loan funds will be disbursed in accordance with the procedures set out in ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. All four disbursement procedures\u2014reimbursement, replenishment, \ncommitment, and direct payment\u2014are envisaged to be used in this Project. An imprest account \n(the Government term is \"special account\") will be established in Bank Indonesia, with a ceiling \nof $14.0 million. The total of any advances requested should never exceed the estimated \nexpenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. Alternatively, \na more direct mechanism may be used for the fund flow, such as allowing PLN to manage the \nloan expenditure through a special account in its own name. Such a direct mechanism would \nrequire a consensus between the Ministry of Finance and PLN before loan inception. PLN will \nbe responsible for preparing all the withdrawal applications for authorization by the ministry. The \nstatement-of-account procedure can be used for individual payments of less than $200,000 in \nseeking replenishment and liquidation from the special account. Supporting documents, as \ndefined in the  Loan Disbursement Handbook, need to be submitted with every withdrawal \napplication for individual expenditure above $200,000. ADB reserves the right to conduct spot or \nrandom checks of expenditures covered by the statement of account, through disbursement or \n                                                 \n22 The implementation of subprojects (transmission lines and substations) will be completed by March 2005 and the \nimplementation of the ICT category for the electricity market will continue to December 2007. \n23  The Special Notice is scheduled for publication in the ADB Business Opportunities in November 2002. \n ", "14  \nreview  missions.  PLN  will  maintain  comprehensive  project-specific  accounting  records, \nsupporting all transactions, to facilitate any audit review. \n \n5.  Accounts, Audit, and Report   \n54.  PLN will submit audited annual financial statements for (i) PLN as an entity, and (ii) the \nProject. The entity and the Project statements will be audited by an independent auditor and in \naccordance with auditing standards acceptable to ADB. The audited financial statements (for \nthe entity and Project) will be submitted in English to ADB not later than 6 months after the end \nof the financial year. The audit opinion will, among other things, confirm (i) the accounting \nstandards used to prepare the statements, (ii) that PLN has utilized all proceeds only for the \nProject as agreed on between ADB and PLN, (iii) that PLN was in compliance as of the date of \nthe balance sheet with all financial covenants of the Loan Agreement between ADB and the \nGovernment,  and  (iv)  that  statement-of-account  transaction  documentation  has  been \nmaintained to support claims to ADB. \n \n6.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n55.  ADB staff provided PLN with the draft Project Administration Memorandum, which will be \nused to provide quarterly progress reports to ADB, starting from the first quarter after loan \neffectiveness. These reports will indicate (i) the financial status of the subprojects; (ii) progress \nmade and problems encountered during the period under review; (iii) steps taken or proposed to \nremedy any problems; (iv) the status of implementation and compliance with loan covenants; (v) \nenvironmental, LARP, social assessment, and poverty analysis-related indicators for monitoring \nand evaluation; and (vi) a proposed program of activities, expected disbursement, and progress \nof subproject implementation during the following quarter. After project completion, PLN will \nprepare a project completion report (PCR) in the form agreed on with ADB, within 3 months \nafter loan closure. The PCR will review the planned objectives and achievements of the Project, \nincluding costs and benefits, and performance and contribution of all parties associated with its \nexecution. ADB will review implementation at least once a year. \n \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic and Financial Analyses \n1.  Least-Cost Option    \n56.  A least cost analysis was carried out by comparing the costs related to the envisaged \nsubprojects and alternate diesel-based power plants. The proposed strengthening of the Java-\nBali power grid and interconnection of power grids in Kalimantan are considered the least-cost \noption to develop efficient and reliable transmission in the subproject areas.  \n \n2.  Economic Evaluation \n57.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  calculated  for  the  transmission \nsubprojects and the ICT-based equipment for the competitive electricity market (Appendix 7). \nThe EIRR was determined by valuing costs and benefits in economic terms. Domestic prices in \nconstant 2002 value were used in economic evaluation. Capital and O&M costs were adjusted \nto remove taxes, duties, and other transfer payments. Local currency expenditures relating \nmostly to nontraded goods are equal to their domestic value, and a shadow exchange rate of \n ", "  15\n1.05 was applied to calculate the economic prices of traded goods from their financial prices \n(based on a standard conversion factor of 0.95). Incremental energy available for sale is valued \nin terms of consumer willingness to pay. \n \n58.  The EIRR for the subprojects in the Java-Bali power grids and the competitive electricity \nmarket was estimated at 33.2%, and for the interconnection of power grids at 22.5%. The \ninvestments are thus economically viable and the resulting benefits sufficiently high to justify the \ncosts incurred by the subprojects, including capital costs. The EIRR calculation was subject to \nsensitivity analysis to test the effect of possible unfavorable changes in key variables. \n \n3.  Financial Analysis \n59.  The financial analysis of the core subprojects of the Project was carried out based on \nreal terms using constant 2002 prices. The financial evaluation assumes that tariffs will be set to \nachieve the full cost recovery and adequate rate of return. The annual energy flows through the \ntransmission system subprojects have been forecast based on the results of network analysis. \nThe costs include capital investment, fuel, O&M, and those for the associated distribution \nsystem.  Revenues  in  the  financial  analysis  were  valued  at  the  average  tariff,  which  was \ncalculated  based  on  the  weighted  average  of  tariffs  for  all  the  customer  groups  (social, \nresidential, commercial, industrial, public service, and street-lighting). An average tariff of $0.06 \nper kWh (Rp585 per kWh) was used during the period of analysis. Assuming the above, the \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the core subprojects was estimated as 8.4-11.9%, \nwhi9ch exceeds the weighted average cost of capital of 4.2%. The robustness of the investment \nwas evaluated by carrying out a sensitivity analysis for changes in major assumptions. Details \nabout the weighted average cost of capital, FIRR, and sensitivity analysis are in Appendix 8.  \n \n4.  Project Beneficiaries \n60.  The Project is justified. The subprojects in the Java-Bali power grid will help remove \ntransmission bottlenecks and ensure efficient and reliable power supply. Electricity is in demand \nnot only among rich and middle-income consumers but also among the poor who require \nelectricity to meet their basic needs. Electricity is vital to create jobs, support most economic \nactivities, and thus reduce poverty. The Project will help remove supply bottlenecks in Java-Bali \nand integrate medium-sized power grids in the outer islands to help achieve economies of \nscale. The Project will also develop electricity market facilities to establish and operate the \npower generation market in Java-Bali. The Project will help boost economic productivity in the \nsubproject  areas  by  enhancing  energy  efficiency  and  reliability  of  power  supply.  Existing \nindustrial and commercial consumers (including small and medium-sized enterprises) will be \nable to continue their operations, and some new units will be connected because of the \nincreased substation capacity. The labor force, which includes the poor working in the informal \nsectors, will be assured of continued employment. \n \n61.  ICT-based systems for the competitive electricity market in Java-Bali are essential for \nthe  ongoing  power  sector  restructuring  program.  Competition  in  power  generation  will \nencourage efficiency among electricity producers and other power companies, lower the bulk \nelectricity price and bring it closer to the marginal cost, and thus force down the average retail \nelectricity price and directly benefit all households connected to the power grid, including the \npoor.  \n \n ", "16  \nB.  Social and Poverty Impact \n62.  The poverty impact ratio (PIR)\u2014the proportion of net economic benefits accruing to the \npoor\u2014was estimated for the Project at 15.1% by comparing the net economic benefits to the \npoor with the net economic benefits to the economy as a whole. The net project benefit directly \naccruing to the poor was estimated at Rp1 trillion during the Project, including the economic \nbenefits from the market-based power supply for the whole Java-Bali power grid. The 15% \nshare of consumer surplus for the poor reflects the proportion of poor households with PLN \nsupply, but no secondary data exists on indirect benefits to the poor from the net benefits going \nto the commercial and industrial sectors. The analysis concludes that a substantial portion of the \nproject benefits will go directly to the poor and the Project will achieve its primary objective of \npro-poor economic growth. The summary poverty and social strategy and analysis of the PIR \nare in Appendix 9. \n \n63.  The Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement signed in April 2001 states that in the \nmedium-term, poverty reduction development priorities will focus on growth, human resource \ndevelopment, and good governance.  \n \n64.  Poverty is significant in most core subproject areas (Table 3).  With the exception of \nSumedang and Malang City, all the other areas are as poor or a little better-off than average \nbased on the 2000 National Socioeconomic Survey.  Levels of access to PLN electricity are also \nhigh in several areas, particularly around Bandung, Sumedang, and Malang, where access is \nnow virtually universal even among the poor.  However, Cianjur, Lebak, and Pandeglang have \nrural hinterlands that are more isolated and where population coverage is lower, but which are \nhome to many poor households. Improving capacity to transmit and distribute power more \neffectively in these areas may open up opportunities to extend service to more households.  \n \nTable 3: Households below the Poverty Line and with Electricity from PLN \n \nSubproject Area  People Below the  Households below  Households with \nPoverty Line   the Poverty Line  PLN Electricity \n(no.)

The Project will improve the reliability and quality of electricity supply in the affected \nareas and thus reduce the incidence or threat of power failure or excessive voltage fluctuations, \nwhich endanger household and business-related electrical appliances and equipment and to \nwhich the poor are more vulnerable (relative to income).  Dependable and quality electricity \nsupply will thus benefit poor households and may encourage greater (and  possibly more \nproductive) use due to reduced risk of damage to appliances and equipment. \n ", "  17\n \n66.  Although formal poverty targeting has not been used, the Project is designed to prevent \npower transmission bottlenecks that could harm the reliability, quality, and quantity of electricity \nsupplied to major load centers and lead to brownouts, interrupt production and commercial \nactivities, and reduce informal jobs, particularly for the poor. Electricity is also consumed by \nhouseholds, many of which are semi-urban poor in the subproject areas. The brunt of supply \nshortages is often borne by such consumers, who tap alternate sources of lighting at a higher \ncost. \n \n67.  Creation of market facilities for a competitive electricity market in Java-Bali is an integral \npart of the ongoing power sector restructuring program and will lower electricity prices. An \nefficient  power sector will free resources for other sectors of the economy and allow PLN to use \npublic  funds  to  expand  the  power  supply  in  outer  islands.  More  economic  agents  and \nentrepreneurial opportunities will provide new prospects in the power sector, while PLN will \naddress the issues that may arise when it is restructured. It has prepared a social protection \nplan based on consultation with its employees. While PLN is unbundled to create functional \ncompanies, the social protection plan document will evolve further with inputs from further \nconsultation, negotiation, legislation, and lessons from other privatization experiences.  \n \nC.  Risks \n68.  No significant technical risks are associated with the proposed investment. The Project \nis  considered  financially  and  economically  sound  and  capable  of  withstanding  reasonable \nchanges in major parameters. Institutional risks are not considered significant as PLN has a \ncomprehensive organizational structure in the outer islands. However, the success of the \nProject depends on (i) the Government's approval for revaluing PLN\u2019s assets, and a gradual \nincrease of electricity tariff from 2003; (ii) decentralization of PLN and empowerment of SBUs; \nand (iii) timely preparation of required documents for subproject approval, efficient procurement, \nand project implementation. The Government has assured ADB that PLN's assets will be \nrevalued and the tariff increased on time.  PLN has approved the establishment of support \nfunctions for SBUs. The last condition for success will be minimized through close monitoring \nand ADB review missions. The Project is in the infrastructure sector with revenue in the \ndomestic currency, exposing the investment to the foreign exchange rate. The ongoing reforms \naim at macroeconomic stabilization. Over the long run, the restructuring of the power sector will \nallow managing the price risk through the competitive electricity market. Until this is possible, \nthe Government will gradually raise the electricity tariff to an appropriate level and reintroduce \nan automatic tariff adjustment mechanism to maintain financial viability. \n \n69.  The timely and successful implementation of the competitive electricity market is subject \nto the ongoing power sector reorganization, under which generation, distribution, supply, and \ntransmission will be separated into independent businesses. The Government must maintain its \ncommitment to the restructuring and implementation schedule. Although competitive electricity \nmarkets operate successfully in several countries, international experience underscores the \nrisks related to market dominance and limitation on bilateral contracts. The design of the \ncompetitive electricity market in Indonesia takes into account these factors and the specific \nfeatures of the Java-Bali power system. The new electricity law requires competition in power \ngeneration to start in 5 years. Provisions have also been made for retail competition but a \ntimetable has not been specified to allow for a gradual evolution of the competitive market \nwithout raising concerns among the stakeholders, particularly civil society. The Government \nalso confirmed that the regulatory body will be established within 1  year in line with the \nelectricity law to ensure timely operation of the competitive market and an independent tariff \n ", "18  \nregime. ADB is helping the Government through international expertise to develop the market \nrules,  financial  settlement  system,  and  computer  software  specifications  needed  by  a \ncompetitive electricity market (para. 30).  \n \nD.  Environment \n70.  The Project has been classified as category B as the subprojects are small scale, not in \nenvironmentally sensitive areas, and will have limited environmental impacts during construction \nand operation. An IEE was prepared for each core subproject. A sample SIEE is in Appendix 10 \nto show the nature of the Project and its likely potential impacts. The sample SIEE includes \nmitigation measures that need to be adopted by the subproject. The IEEs indicate that short-\nterm interference in daily life may be expected during construction due to dust, road damage, \nand noise, while no significantly adverse environmental impacts are expected due to project \nimplementation.  \n \n71.  Project social and environmental impacts are limited to the construction period and can \nbe mitigated to an acceptable level by implementing recommended measures and using the \nbest engineering and environmental practices as stated in the IEE and SIEE of the core \nsubproject. The Project has adequate provisions for environmental mitigation and monitoring \nand their associated costs.  \n \n72.  For noncore subprojects, PLN will submit to ADB for no-objection an IEE and SIEE in \nADB format for each new 150 kV transmission line and associated substation. \n \nE.  Social Dimensions \n73.  An  initial  social  assessment  and  a  social  analysis  have  been  prepared  for  all \nsubprojects. No subproject is expected to affect indigenous communities or to have  specific \nimpacts on women or other vulnerable groups. The land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) \nimpacts vary by subproject type. Subprojects entailing substation or transmission line upgrading \nwill not involve LAR. Subprojects entailing transmission line construction involve only medium-\nimpact LAR of as land acquisition is limited to tower-base areas, and the houses in the \ntransmission lines\u2019 right of way will not have to be cleared. Only subprojects involving substation \nconstruction may have severe impacts. \n \n74.  The compensation and rehabilitation of families affected by LAR are regulated by the \ncompensation policy framework and procedural guidelines prepared by PLN for all subprojects. \nSubproject  preparation  and  implementation  will  be  regulated  by  LARPs  that  meet  the \nrequirements of the ADB policy on involuntary resettlement. The LARP for the Barikin-Tanjung \ntransmission line, the only core subproject involving LAR, has been prepared. The LARPs for \nnoncore subprojects involving LAR will be prepared during project implementation. For all \nsubprojects, a LARP will be a condition for award of civil works contract. A summary of LAR is in \nAppendix 11. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  19\nV.  ASSURANCES \n75.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  PLN  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.   \n  \n76.  PLN Financial Management. The Government\u2019s relending to PLN of loan proceeds on \nterms and conditions acceptable to ADB is a condition of loan effectiveness. In addition, the \nGovernment and PLN will ensure PLN\u2019s continuing compliance with financial management \nassurances  on  operational  budgets  and  efficiency  improvement  program  targets  and \ncompliance  with  assurances  on  tariff  levels  for  PLN,  based  on  factors  including  asset \nrevaluation and self-financing ratio. \n \n77.  Sector  Project  Criteria.  The  Government  and  PLN  will  ensure  compliance  with \nsubproject selection criteria for noncore subprojects, including ADB\u2019s approval of commencing \nimplementation  based  on  submission  of  documents  including  (a)  executive  summary  of \nfeasibility report, including cost estimate, contract package list, implementation schedule; (b) \nsocial assessment; (c) poverty analysis; (d) IEE and SIEE for selected subprojects; and (e) \nLARP, where applicable, satisfactory to ADB. \n \n78.  Financing Plan.  The Government and PLN will ensure counterpart funds, based on \nannual budget appropriation requested for land acquisition, building, taxes, and 55% of local \ncurrency costs for the Java-Bali power grids, interconnection of power grids, and ICT; and 50% \nof the local cost of the consulting services. \n \n79.  Project Implementation. The Government will ensure (i) appropriate security measures \nwill be put in place at project sites for the PLN staff, contractors, consultants, and ADB staff to \nperform the assigned tasks; (ii) PLN will streamline the procurement procedures to include \nexperts from headquarters, and SBU staff; (iii) timely and full implementation of LARPs; and (iv) \nall necessary action to make available land, rights of way, and other rights in land required for \nthe Project, to prevent project implementation delays. \n \n80.  PLN Financial Governance. The Government and PLN will ensure, amongst other \nthings, independent audits of PLN and project annual financial statements. \n \n81.  Environmental Safeguards. The Government and PLN will ensure, amongst other \nthings, implementing measures identified in the IEE and SIEE for the core subproject, and \nsimilarly for the noncore subprojects, all in accordance with the environmental monitoring \nprogram and ADB's environmental procedures requirements and guidelines as amended from \ntime to time. \n \n82.  Social Safeguards. The Government and PLN will ensure (i) preparation of plans to \naddress  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  in  accordance  with  CPFPG;  (ii)  LARPs  will  be \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB's  policies  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous \npeoples; and (iii) preparation and implementation of the relevant subproject LARP will be a \ncondition for the award of civil works contracts for that subproject. \n \n83.  Social Protection Plan. Within 12 months of loan effectiveness, the Government and \nPLN will ensure updating and finalization of a draft social protection plan satisfactory to ADB to \nreflect the planned corporate reorganization of PLN taking account of the recommendations of \nthe World Bank-funded consultant. \n \n ", "20  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n84.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and  recommend that the Board approve  the loan of $140,000,000 to the Republic of \nIndonesia for the Power Transmission Improvement Sector Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility, an amortization period of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan \nand Project Implementation Agreements presented to the Board. \nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n \n25 November 2002 \n \n ", " \nSECTOR PROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets  Monitoring Mechanism  Assumptions and Risks \nGoals       \n       \n?

Introduction \n1.  During the last two decades, the Indonesian power sector's annual average sales grew \nby 12\u201313%. In 2001, the State Electricity Enterprise  (PLN) served 30 million consumers all over \nthe archipelago, and electricity sales totaled 85.5 terawatt-hour (TWh).  About 56% of the \nelectricity was consumed for industry and commerce. PLN operates over 1,100 power grids, the \nlargest being the Java-Bali power grid with a power generation capacity of 18.4 gigawatt (GW). \nHowever, only about 53% of the population is connected to the power grids and so considerable \ngrowth is still needed.  \n \n2.  PLN has prepared a long-term power development plan (2002\u20132010). Based on least-\ncost principles, limited-, low-, medium-, and high-growth scenarios have been considered. The \nlimited-growth scenario is necessary to reflect immediate financial constraints, which may only \npermit completion of the committed projects.   \n \nB.  Existing Power Generation Capacity \n3.  PLN owns and operates about 4,055 generating units with a total capacity of 21,000 \nmegawatt (MW). About 74% of the capacity is in Java-Bali, and the rest is scattered throughout \nthe outer islands (Table A2.1).  \n \nTable A2.1: Installed Capacity of PLN Power Plants \n(MW) \n \nType of Power Plant  Outer Islands  Java-Bali  Total \nHydropower  714  2,391  3,105 \nCombine Cycle       \n  Gas Fired  876   3,268  4,146 \n  Oil Fired  0  2,717  2,717 \nSteam       \n  Gas Fired    1,000  1,000 \n  Oil Fired  310      800  1,110 \n  Coal  590  4,200  4,790 \nGeothermal  20  360  380 \nGas Turbine  646  558  1,204 \nDiesel  2,441  109  2,550 \n    Total  5,511  15,492  21,003 \nSource: PLN       \n \nC.

Total power generation in 2001 was 101.6 TWh, which included the power purchased \nfrom independent power producers (13.3 TWh) and from leased generating plants (0.7 TWh). \nVarious primary energy sources were utilized: coal (33.5%), natural gas (29%), fuel oil (22%), \nhydropower (12%), and geothermal sources (3.4%). \n  \n ", "24 Appendix 2 \nD.

Average  transmission  and  distribution  loss  during  1997-2001  was  12.3%,  which  is \nconsiderably lower than in other developing economies.24 The average frequency and duration \nof interruptions reflect the reliability and quality of service provided by a utility to its consumers. \nAlthough performance is generally satisfactory, the 5 year data suggests the need of regular \nmaintenance and upgrading of the distribution networks (Table A2.2). \n \nTable A2.2: Losses and Interruptions \n(%) \n \nItem  1997  1998  1999  2000  2001 \nLosses   12.10  12.34  12.22  11.50  13.48 \nSAIDI  15.15  15.58  14.00  13.90  13.24 \nSAIFI  12.81  18.68  18.49  18.10  15.12 \nSAIDI = system average interruption duration index (hours per customer), SAIFI = system \naverage interruption frequency index (times per customer) \nSource: PLN \n \nE.  Forecast of Power Demand  \n6.  Power demand cannot be forecast with complete certainty. A number of models are \navailable to utilities. PLN uses one based on gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate; level of \nelectrification  ratio;  and  efforts  to  replace  captive  power  supply,  which  is  conservatively \nestimated at 10,000 MW. PLN\u2019s forecast considers a GDP growth rate of 3.5\u20136.0% as given by \nthe National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS). The high-growth scenario would \nrequire prohibitively high capital investment in the power sector and, therefore, only scenarios of \nlimited (financial constraint preventing new commitment), low, and medium growth are analyzed \n(Table A2.3).  \n \nTable A2.3: Projected Energy Demand \n(GWh) \n \nEnergy \nDemand  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010 \nJava-Bali                     \nLimited  67,927  74,080   76,440   80,430   84,628   84,628   84,430   84,430   84,430   84,430  \nLow  67,927  74,080   80,029   85,607   91,862   98,486   105,449  113,214   121,900   131,334  \nMedium  67,927  74,080   82,092   89,272   97,469   106,223   115,550  125,463   135,973   147,088  \nOuter Islands                   \nLimited  16,592  18,104   16,956   17,669   18,178   18,511   18,559   18,608   18,657   18,708  \nLow  16,592  18,104   18,422   20,090   21,910   23,898   26,067   28,436   31,022   33,848  \nMedium  16,592  18,104   19,337   21,415   23,721   26,278   29,116   32,267   35,739   39,463  \nSource: PLN \n                                                 \n24  These losses are commonly attributed to technical and nontechnical reasons. Two major reasons for technical \nlosses are that (i) small consumers constitute a relatively high portion of all consumers and are supplied through a \nlarge low-voltage distribution network (440 volts), which has high current flows and high heat losses; and (ii) a lack \nof timely expansion and improvement of the distribution networks causes overloads. The nontechnical reason is \nillegal electricity consumption, either as an unauthorized connection or tampering of energy meters. \n ", "    Appendix 2  25\n7.  The availability of funds will determine the most likely scenario, and the present plans \nare based on the limited-growth scenario for the Java-Bali power grid. Its energy sales growth \nrate will be 4.2\u20134.6% in 2003\u20132005, less than the growth rate in 1995\u20132001 (8.8%). By 2005, \ncapacity would be fully utilized and the system may not be able to support further demand \ngrowth.  \n \n8.  Under  a  conservative  plan  (low  economic  growth)  that  would  be  possible  with \nimprovement in financial performance, the national electricity sales growth is projected to be \nabout  6.9%  per  annum.  The  forecasts  take  into  account the impact of the Government\u2019s \neconomic reform program to reduce poverty and promote regional autonomy. Reforms will \nincrease the electrification ratio from 53% to 75% by 2010. Electricity sales growth rate in the \nouter islands (7.4%) will be a little higher than in Java-Bali (6.8%). \n \nF.  Generation Expansion Plan \n9.  The installed generating capacity in Java-Bali is 18,700 MW, comprising PLN-owned \nplants of 15,700 MW and independent power producer (IPP)-owned of 3,000 MW. Due to aging \nof PLN\u2019s power plants, about 1,000 MW are not available. A peak power demand of 13,041 MW \nwas recorded on 13 November 2001. The generation capacity expansion plan is formulated on \na reserve margin criterion25 with a loss of load probability of 1 day per year. Based on past \nexperience, a reserve margin of 25\u201330% is required, and in the low-growth scenario, 11,000 \nMW of additional capacity will be needed in Java-Bali by 2010. Considering the financial \nconstraints (limited-growth scenario), addition of only 3,700 MW is likely by 2006. \n \n10.  In the outer islands, about 746 MW generation capacity is under construction, which \nincludes hydropower plants (546 MW) and coal-based power plants (200 MW). The power \nsupply situation in most power grids is unsatisfactory, and the required additional capacity in the \nmedium-growth scenario will be from various power plants: gas turbine (1,400 MW); geothermal \n(50 MW); coal based (270 MW); hydropower (20 MW); diesel based (390 MW); and mini \nhydropower (20 MW). \n \n11.  An estimated $5.5 billion will be needed in 2002-2005, excluding the investment in IPP \nprojects.  \n \nG.  Funds Needed for Transmission, Substations, and Distribution \n12.  To maintain the reliability and quality of power supply, the transmission and distribution \nnetworks should also be expanded to (i) prevent overloading of substations, (ii) provide flexibility \nin operation through interconnecting power grids, and (iii) evacuate power from new power \nplants.  \n \n13.  PLN has prepared an investment plan for 2002-2005 based on (i) energy sales growth \nrate according to the low-growth case for outer islands; (ii) removal of bottlenecks in Java-Bali; \n(iii) operation of IPP power plants; and (iv) interconnections between Java and Sumatra, West \nKalimantan and Serawak, and Java and Bali. The plan indicates a requirement of about $5.5 \nbillion, which is the same as the requirement for additional power generation capacity. \n \n                                                 \n25  An adequate generation reserve should be provided to anticipate the possibility of forced or planned plant outages, \nand also to ensure reliable services. \n ", "26 Appendix 2 \nH.  Planning Constraints \n14.  The higher foreign exchange rate since 1997 has increased PLN\u2019s costs, mainly to \nservice foreign currency-denominated loans, and purchase natural gas and power from IPPs. \nSince a corresponding tariff increase would have transferred the burden to consumers and \nslowed economic recovery, the tariff increase has been gradual. PLN could meet its cash flow \nrequirements for operations but was unable to service the foreign currency-based Government \nloans. Severe constraints were imposed on all new investments. While the demand forecast and \nexpansion-planning exercise indicate a large fund requirement, the financial capacity of PLN \ndoes not permit it to raise its borrowings to $11 billion in 4 years. As long as the electricity tariff \nremains below the economic level, the private sector will also face considerable risk in investing \nin power generation. PLN has taken the following measures to partly address its predicament.  \n \n15.  Efficiency Improvement. To ensure that consumers do not resist tariff increases, PLN \nmust  achieve  high  industry  standards.  It  involves  all  employees  in  improving  operational \nefficiency and promoting prudent capital expenditure. Since the efficiency improvement program \nstarted in 1999, PLN estimates that it has saved about $60 million in operational expenditure. \n \n16.  Rehabilitation of Power Plants. PLN has focused on rehabilitating inefficient and \nderated power plants, which provided larger benefits and required less time to implement than \nadding new power generating capacity. The program includes the following:  \n \n(i)  rehabilitation of seven small hydropower plants in Java (completed in 2000); \n(ii)  efficiency improvement of Muara Karang steam gas-based units 4 and 5 (2 x 200 \nMW),  under  cooperation  with  the  New  Energy  and  Industrial  Technology \nDevelopment Organization of Japan; and \n(iii)  efficiency improvement of Gresik steam oil-based units 1 and 2  (2 x 100 MW) by \nconversion to gas-based units, under cooperation with the Japan International \nCooperation Agency. \n \n17.  Excess Power from Captive Power Plants. PLN is investigating the possibility of \ncooperating with owners of captive power plants to help meet power requirements during high-\ndemand evenings. Based on a December 2001 survey, about 200 MW capacity may be \navailable from such power plants in Java in 2002.  \n \n18.  Demand-Side Management. PLN will launch a demand-side management program in \nclose cooperation with customers on voluntary basis. It will include electricity price adjustment \nduring high-demand periods, energy conservation, and voluntary load curtailment. In the first \nstage, the proposed program has the potential to reduce the peak demand in Java-Bali by 140 \nMW in 2002. \n \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 3  27 \n \n  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS  \n \nA.  Financial Performance of the State Electricity Enterprise \n1.  The financial performance of  the State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) in 1995\u20132001 is \nsummarized in Table A3.1. \n \nTable A3.1: Past Financial Performance of the State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) \n \nItem  Unit  1995  1996  1997  1998  1999  2000  2001 \n           \nEnergy sales  GWh  49,749  56,932 64,312  65,144 71,004  79,165 85,528 \nSales increases  %    14.4 13.0  1.3 9.0  11.5 8.0 \nOperating revenue  Rp billion  8,306  9,646 11,126  14,036 15,997  22,557 28,625 \nAverage revenues  Rp/kWh  163.0  165.4 169.1  211.3 220.7  279.7 330.6 \nAverage revenue increase  %    1.5 2.2  24.9 4.4  26.7 18.2 \nOperating expenses  Rp billion  6,537  7,713  9,450  16,809  21,503  27,216  31,939 \nEBIT  Rp billion  1,769  1,933  1,676  (2,773) (5,506)  (4,659) (3,315) \nDebt service   Rp billion  576  1,897 3,435  1,602.0 4,043.0  3,894.0 3,971 \nNet income after tax  Rp billion  1,020  1,178  (580)  (9,546) (11,368)  (24,611) 180 \nInternal sources of funds  Rp billion  3.328  4.542 5.833  269 1.426  (7.474) 7,409 \nReturn on assetsa  %  3.7  4.7 3.2  (13.3) (9.3)  (0.9) 0.4 \nReturn on equity  %    4.0 (1.9)  (40.8) (89.6)  (132.1) 0.9 \nOperating ratio  %  78.7  80.0 84.9  119.8 134.4  120.7 111.6 \nDebt to debt + equity ratio  %  27.7  34.7 45.3  64.6 78.5  72.0 71.6 \nDebt service coverage ratio  times  5.8  2.4  1.7  0.2  0.4  (1.9) 1.9 \nSelf financing ratio (annual)  %  12.7  33.6 33.1  40.8 8.0  69.6 79.7 \na Defined as operating income less tax / average net fixed assets in operation.   \nSource: State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) \n \n2.  The lower foreign exchange rate of the rupiah resulting from the 1997 crisis considerably \nincreased PLN\u2019s operating and debt servicing costs. The operating ratio (operating expense \ndivided by operating revenue) became more than 100%, and the debt service coverage ratio \ndropped below 1.0, indicating that PLN could not service all its debt.26 However, the cash flow \nneeded for operations was possible, as PLN did not service the loans that had been relent by \nthe  Government.  The  default  attracted  a  penalty  of  Rp13  trillion  in  2000,  resulting  in  a \ncumulative loss that not only wiped out the retained earnings from earlier  years  but  also \nthreatened to make the net value (equity and retained earnings) negative, making the company \ntechnically insolvent.  \n \n3.  The impact of higher foreign exchange-linked operating and debt servicing costs was \nforeseen  during  the  preparation  of  the  1999  Loan  1673-INO:  Power  Sector  Restructuring \nProgram  (the  Program)  and  during  loan  appraisal.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nacknowledged the need to restructure the high-cost debt. At the time, the Government faced \neven greater financial stress and could not immediately offer relief to a state-owned enterprise \non a selective basis. In June 2001, the Government as PLN\u2019s shareholder approved a financial \nrestructuring package that implicitly condoned PLN\u2019s failure to pay interest and the principal \n                                                 \n26  The self financing ratio is still indicated as positive because it is calculated from the cash flows, which do not record \nthe failure to service Government debt.    \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \namounts during 1998-2000, and converted these accrued payments (and the penalty for the \ndefault) into new long-term debt and equity. This financial package helped improve the balance \nsheet for 31 December 2000 by including (i) the conversion of Rp15.7 trillion of unpaid interest \nand Rp13.1 trillion of penalties into equity, and (ii) the conversion of unpaid principal amount of \nRp5.3 trillion into a 20-year term loan with an interest rate of 4%. \n \n4.  Helped by the withdrawal of the default-related penalty, debt restructuring under the \nsubsidiary loan agreements, a rising average electricity tariff, the renegotiated power purchase \ncosts, and the government subsidy to compensate for the low tariff for small consumers, PLN \nachieved a net income of Rp180 billion in 2001 compared to a net loss of Rp24.6 trillion in 2000. \nThe government subsidy of Rp6.7 trillion and the decrease in interest and financial charge by \nRp11 trillion significantly improved PLN\u2019s income statement.  The Government has already \nraised the tariff for 2002 by 6% per quarter and will raise it further in 2003-2005 so that it reflects \nthe full cost of supply, including a reasonable rate of return. PLN  is continuously trying to \nimprove its financial position by, among other things, (i) reducing nontechnical losses; and (ii) \nreducing costs by (a) renegotiating power purchase costs, (b) operating power plants using fuel \noil rather than  natural gas, and  (c) reducing fuel costs through contract amendment. The \noperating ratio will be substantially improved in 2005, indicating that PLN\u2019s financial health will \nrecover by then. Based on the higher projected revenue, PLN has the capacity to borrow for \nnew investments for next 4\u20135 years. \n \nB.  Projected Financial Performance \n5.  The major assumptions for the financial projections are as follows: \n(i)  Exchange rate: Rp9,000/$1 \n(ii)  Inflation rate: 7.2% annually for local costs and 2.5% annually for foreign costs \n(iii)  Fuel prices: linked to international prices in 2004 onward \n(iv)  Maintenance costs: 1% of average net fixed assets in operation \n(v)  Power purchase: reflecting new agreements with independent power producers \n(IPPs) \n(vi)  Energy sales growth (low-growth scenario): increase by 7.6% per annum in 2006 \nonward \n(vii)  Average tariff: increase of 6% every quarter in 2003 and of 5% every quarter in \n2004, no increases 2005 onward \n(viii)  Government subsidy: Rp3.2 trillion in 2003, and Rp3.3 trillion in 2004 \n(ix)  Annual investment (low-growth scenario): Rp161 trillion in 2003\u20132007 \n(x)  Assets revaluation: carried out on 1 January 2002 \n(xi)  Cost of borrowing: 7% interest on ADB loans and 6.1% per annum on others \n \n6.  The actual and projected financial statements for 1999-2008 are summarized in Tables \nA3.2\u2013A3.4. \n \n7.  PLN has requested the Government to revalue its assets based on the principles \nrecommended in the ADB-funded technical assistance.27 The net value of the operating assets \nwill increase to Rp173 trillion. Consequently, as of 31 December 2002, PLN\u2019s balance sheet will \nindicate a revaluation surplus of Rp74.1 trillion and government equity of Rp66 trillion, reducing \nthe debt-equity ratio from 61% to 27%. However, the asset revaluation will attract a tax payment \nof Rp8.7 trillion, in equal installments for 5 years starting from 2002.

Accounts payable, including arrears \nfrom IPPs, will significantly decrease from Rp19.9 trillion to Rp5.6 trillion due to reduced power \npurchase costs as a result of renegotiations with IPPs.  To continue meeting all costs and \nprovide a reasonable level of cash balance, a 72% increase in tariff will be needed in 2003. \nHowever, the Government plans to implement a more gradual increase of 20% per annum from \n2003 to 2005, which will allow a 68% rate of return starting in 2005.  \n \nC.  Financial Health of the State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) \n8.  In many ways, PLN is a well-run utility: its operating costs are low, transmission and \ndistribution losses are reasonable, and revenue collection is good. The inadequate tariff level, \nhowever, has adversely affected PLN's financial position. Sales revenue is expected to increase \nto Rp100 trillion in 2008.7 due to  higher energy sales and tariff. The operating expenses\u2014\nmainly fuel and power purchase costs\u2014will not increase by as much, and PLN will have a \npositive operating income in 2004, which will increase gradually from 2005 onward. Foreign \nborrowings of about Rp74.6 trillion will be needed in 2003-2007 for the investment program \nunder the low-case scenario, considering the cash shortfall remaining after equity contribution, \noperating income, depreciation, and subsidy payment. The tariff increase during 2003-2005 will \nallow PLN to service existing and future debt during the next 3\u20134 years. The debt service \ncoverage ratio will increase to 3.4 in 2005, and the self-financing ratio will be 0.7% in 2003, and \n53.9% in 2004. Asset revaluation will significantly improve the ratio of debt to debt plus equity \nfrom 72% in 2001, to 27% in 2002, which will make room for larger borrowings. The average \ncollection date is projected to remain within the normal range of 27-32 days. \n \n9.  PLN has obtained the Government's approval in principle to seek $804 million in official \nforeign  loans  during  2002\u20132004  from  ADB,  World  Bank,  Islamic  Development  Bank,  the \ngovernments of Belgium and Denmark, and Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW); and through \nexport credit. \n \nD.  Loan Covenants \n10.  Based on the projected financial performance, the following financial covenants will be \nproposed in the loan agreement: \n \n11.  Revaluation of Assets. The Government will cause PLN to revaluate its assets from 1 \nJanuary 2002, in accordance with the principles included in the ADB-funded study (footnote 2), \nand approve tax payment in five equal annual installments. \n \n12.  Implementation of Electricity Tariff Increases. The Government  will cause PLN to \nimplement (i) gradual tariff increases in 2003-2004 to reach and economic  tariff level in 2005; \n(ii) a tariff increase from 1 January 2005, to allow PLN to maintain a self-financing ratio of not \nless  than  30%  from  2005  onward;  and  (iii)  a  formula-based  automatic  tariff  adjustment \nmechanism  from  1  January  2006, to  protect the level of  PLN\u2019s  tariffs  in  real  terms  by \ncompensating for changes in (a) the prices and quantities of fuel, (b) foreign exchange rate, and \n(c) domestic prices (inflation). \n \n13.  Operating Ratio. The Government will ensure that PLN will maintain every fiscal year \nafter 31 December 2004, a ratio of total operating expenses to total operating revenue not \nhigher than 85%. \n \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \n14.  Debt Service Coverage Ratio. The Government will ensure that PLN will maintain a \nratio of gross internal sources of funds for each fiscal year of not less than 1.5 times the debt \nservice requirements after 31 December 2002. \n \n15.  Average Collection Period. The Government  will ensure that PLN will maintain an \naverage collection period of not more than 40 days after 31 December 2002. \n \n \n ", " \nTable A3.2: Consolidated Actual and Projected Income

Least Cost Analysis \n1.  The power sectors in the selected regions are scattered, made up of a large number of \nsmall power transmission systems. Power system expansion has been planned considering (i) \nfuture development of power demand and load, (ii) the gap between the available dependable \ncapacity and other required capacity, and (iii) closing this gap at the least cost. \n \n2.  The equalizing discount rate analysis was carried out for power grid interconnection on \nthe outer islands by comparing the selected core subproject with alternate modes of generation. \nSince the power sector in the project areas mostly consumes diesel, diesel power is considered \na viable alternate source. The least-cost analysis was conducted using 2002 domestic market \nprices. Capital costs and operating costs, including fuel costs, were taken into account, and \ntaxes excluded. The present values of the cost streams of the two options are calculated along \nwith equalizing discount rates for the core subproject as in Table A7.1. The Java-Bali power grid \nsubprojects are in line with the least-cost power development program of State Electricity \nEnterprise (PLN). \n \nTable A7.1: Least Cost Analysis for Core Subproject \n \nCore Subproject  Net Present Value   Equalizing \n(Rp million)  Discount \n  Renewable  Alternate  Rate \nResources-Based  Diesel-Based  (%) \nBarikin-Tanjung  Transmission  Line  51,958  53,928  16 \n150 kV \nkV = kilovolt \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nB.  General \n3.  The economic analysis was based on a comparison of the with- and without-project \nscenarios. Without the Project, power transmission systems will continue to deteriorate. With the \nProject, power transmission bottlenecks will be removed in Java, and power transmission \nsystems on the outer islands will be interconnected to maintain the quality of power supply and \nimprove  efficiency.  A  wholesale  electricity  market  will  be  established,  and  competitive \ngeneration tariff introduced that is economic and significantly determined by the interaction of \nmarket supply and demand. \n \n4.  The economic analysis was conducted using domestic market prices. The economic \nprice of nontraded goods is equal to their domestic prices, and a shadow exchange rate of \n1.053 (based on the standard conversion factor of 0.95) was applied to calculate the economic \nprice of traded goods. Due to local labor market conditions, an unskilled labor conversion factor \nof 0.75 in domestic prices was considered. Based on these assumptions, the main costs and \nbenefits have been broken down into traded goods, nontraded goods, and skilled and unskilled \nlabor; and conversion factors were calculated to value all costs and benefits in economic terms. \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix  7  41 \n \nC.  Costs \n5.  The  main  project  costs  cover  civil  works,  equipment,  incremental  operation  and \nmaintenance, land acquisition, and resettlement with and without the Project. The economic \ncosts were estimated from financial costs, including physical contingencies. Price escalation, \ninterest  during  construction,  and  taxes  are  excluded.  Local  currency  expenditures  relating \nmostly to nontraded goods are equal to their domestic value, and the shadow exchange rate of \n1.05 was applied to calculate the economic prices of traded goods from their financial prices. \n \nD.  Benefits \n6.  Enhanced Java-Bali power transmission systems and a wholesale electricity market will \nintroduce competition in power supply to bring electricity prices closer to marginal costs, force \ndown overall average electricity prices, and thereby increase consumption. These benefits \naccrue to incremental energy consumption and are valued at consumer willingness to pay. In \nthe long term, the electricity retail prices are expected to go down about $0.02 per kilowatt-hour \n(kWh) equivalent under the Project. The literature indicates price elasticity of about  \u20130.3 to \nmeasure the economic benefits from incremental electricity consumption, which suggests that \nwith  the  price  decrease  by  about  $0.02/kWh  equivalent,  market  demand  for  incremental \nelectricity consumption may go up to about 20%.  \n \n7.  Interconnection of power transmission systems on the outer islands will help boost \neconomic productivity of the project areas. The Project viability is based on the economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR).  Average  consumer  willingness-to-pay  in  East  and  South \nKalimantan was estimated as Rp1,251 (about $0.14/kWh equivalent) based on the willingness-\nto-pay for residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, as well as their respective shares in \nconsumption of power. The economic benefits were valued by applying the average consumer \nwillingness-to-pay to net energy sold to consumers due to the enhanced efficiency of power \ntransmission systems in the project areas. \n \n8.  The Project holds other benefits that are not easily quantified. Power transmission \nsystem improvement in Java-Bali and power grid interconnection on the outer islands will \nenhance  transmission  facilities,  meet  future  demand,  and  promote  balanced  regional \ndevelopment. A wholesale electricity market and competition in the generation sector through a \nsystem  of  marginal  cost  pricing  will  fend  off  inefficiency  in  production  (generation)  and \nconsumption (distribution and large industrial customers). With the wholesale electricity supply \nmarket in place, the power facilities will have to compete on the basis of least cost. Generation \nfacilities will be forced to keep down their operating costs, otherwise they run the risk of not \nbeing dispatched and being priced out of the system by more efficiently run facilities. Power \nfacilities will thus be pressured to minimize their operating costs and, at the same time, become \nmore efficient to improve their heat rates. \n \nE.  Results of Economic Analysis \n9.  The Project benefits will accrue to all energy consumers in the power transmission \nsystems, including the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. The Project will enhance \npower supply quality and ensure sufficient, reliable, and stable supply of power to consumers, \nincluding the poor. A wholesale electricity market and competition in generation are envisioned \nto bring electricity prices closer to marginal cost and force down overall average electricity \nprices. In the long run, sizable welfare gains will accrue to households, producers, and the \neconomy as a whole. \n ", "42  Appendix 7 \n \n10.  The Project's EIRR was calculated for 25 years, including 5 years of construction (2003-\n2007) and 20 years of operation (2008-2027) (Table A7.2). The results of the economic analysis \nshow that all the four core subprojects are economically viable and the subproject benefits \nsufficient to justify subproject costs, including capital costs.

The financial viability of the Project is assessed by considering the aggregated costs and \nbenefits attributable  to the subprojects in  Java-Bali and Kalimantan. The creation of market \nfacilities for the bulk electricity market in Java-Bali is analyzed on the assumption that it will \ncommence operation in 2008.  \n \nB.  Capital Costs and Financial Benefits \n2.  The main project costs include capital investment,  and operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M). The capital costs for  the Java-Bali and interconnection power grid subprojects include \ntransmission lines, transformers, capacitors, switch gears, and telecommunication equipment. \nThe cost for land acquisition, resettlement,  buildings, and access roads are also included. \nMarket facility costs are computer hardware and software. The annual capital expenditures are \nbased on the investment program of the State Electricity Enterprise (PLN). All capital costs are \nexpressed in real terms using constant 2002 prices. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nwas calculated on the basis of the base costs, excluding price contingency and interest during \nconstruction. No residual value of the project was considered. \n \n3.  The  financial  benefits  for  the  Java-Bali  power  subprojects  were  measured  by  the \nincremental energy sales and reduction of transmission loss as result of removing bottlenecks; \nand for the Kalimantan interconnection subproject, by the average energy transferred from the \nEast to the South Kalimantan system. The forecasted power demand and subproject\u2019s utilization \nfactor  were  also  taken  into  account.  The  financial  benefits  for  the  market  facilities  were \nmeasured by the net cash flow, which was the net revenue generated from the system, and \nmarket operation, and deducting the capital and operation costs for establishment and operation \nof the market facilities.  The revenue was computed from the system and market operation fee \nper kilowatt-hour (kWh) multiplied by the volume of energy traded through the market.  All \nbenefits are expressed in real terms using constant 2002 prices. \n \nC.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital and Assumptions \n4.  The FIRR was compared with the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 4.23%, \nwhich was determined based on the following assumptions: \n \n(i)  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Loan:  $140  million  (80%  of  total  funding), \ninterest rate of 5.6% per annum; \n(ii)  local loan: $17.5 million (10% of total funding), interest rate of 20% per annum; \n(iii)  government funds: $17.5 million (10% of total funding), nominal cost of 10.6% \nper annum; \n(iv)  tax rate: 30%; \n(v)  inflation rate: 7.2% per annum for local cost; \n(vi)  real cost: ADB Loan\u20143.92%, local loan\u20146.34%, government funds\u20143.17%; and \n(vii)  minimum rate test: 4.% \n \n5.  The  FIRR  analysis  covers  25  years  of  project  life,  including  5  years  for  project \nimplementation. The annual load demand in the core subproject areas has been forecasted \nbased on the low-case scenario. The  average tariff level will allow  full cost recovery and \nappropriate level of rate of return. The financial benefits consider a constant tariff of $0.06 per \nkilowatt-hour (kW) (Rp585/kW), which is the weighted average of tariffs for all the consumer \n ", "44  Appendix 8 \ncategories. O&M costs are assumed at 2% of capital expenditures. The power factor and load \nfactor are assumed as 0.85 and 70%, respectively. For the market facilities, the system and \nmarket operation charges are assumed as $0.000153/kWh, and the share of energy traded \nthrough the market was estimated at 10% of total energy sales in the Java-Bali system in 2008, \nto increase by 10% every year until it reaches 60%. O&M costs are assumed at 3.7% of capital \nexpenditures. \n \nD.  Financial Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis \n6.  The FIRR was calculated for the Java-Bali and interconnection power grid subprojects. \nTo assess the results obtained in the base-case scenario and to identify possible risks, a \nsensitivity analysis was carried out on changes in major key variables. The base-case FIRRs \nand results of the sensitivity analysis are in Table A8. \n \nTable A8: Financial Internal Rate of Return for Base Case  \nand Result of Sensitivity Analysis  \n(%) \n \nVariables  Java-Bali Power  Power Grid  Market Facilities \nGrid  Interconnection \nBase case  8.39  8.64  11.9 \nCapital Expenditure (+10%)  7.13  7.46  10.8 \nBenefits (-10%)  7.00  7.35  10.7a \nPower output (-10%)  6.30  7.31  10.7 \nWorst case I b  5.79  6.22  9.6 \nWorst case II c  5.12  6.17  9.5 \nNote: \na\n   In case of market facilities, the share of energy sales on competitive basis is considered 10% lower. \nb\n   A combination of capital expenditure increase and benefits decrease. \nc\n   A combination of capital expenditure increase and power output decrease in case of Java-Bali and the power grid \ninterconnection subprojects, and a combination of shared volume decrease and power output decrease in the \ncase of market facilities.  \n \n7.  The result of the sensitivity analysis shows that all categories achieve FIRRs of more \nthan 4.23% of WACC, including the two worst-case scenarios. The FIRRs are thus adequate \nand the Project is financially viable \n ", "  Appendix 9  45 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.

The Project \nwill contribute to these areas of intervention and is designed to prevent bottlenecks in power transmission that could \nadversely affect the reliability, quality, and quantity of electricity supplied to major load centers. Such constraints in \nelectricity delivery lead to brownouts, interrupt production and commercial activities, and reduce informal jobs, \nparticularly for the poor. Electricity is also consumed by households, including many semi-urban poor in subproject \nareas. Such consumers often bear the brunt of supply shortages and need to make alternate arrangements for at \nleast the essential services (lighting) at a higher cost. The ongoing restructuring and introduction of a competitive \nelectricity market will also benefit all consumers by bringing the cost of electricity close to its marginal cost.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Classification: Others \nAnalysis: \n \nA 15.1% poverty impact ratio (PIR) expressing the proportion of net economic benefits accruing to the poor was \nestimated for the Project by comparing the net economic benefits to the poor with the net economic benefits to the \neconomy as a whole. During the operation of the Project, the net project benefit directly accruing to the poor is \nestimated at Rp1 trillion including the economic benefits from the market-based power supply for the whole Java-Bali \npower grid. The 15% consumer surplus for the poor reflects the proportion of poor households with State Electricity \nEnterprise (PLN) supply, but no secondary data exists on the indirect benefits to the poor from the consumer surplus \ngoing to the commercial and industrial sectors. The analysis concludes that a substantial portion of the project \nbenefits will go directly to the poor and the Project will achieve its primary objective of pro-poor economic growth. \n \n \nC.

Poverty Impact Analysis \n1.  The Project's poverty impact was derived from the economic and financial analysis. The \ndomestic price numeraire and the discount rate of 12% were used. Table A9 shows the \ndistribution  of  project  effects  (economic  minus  financial  present  values)  among  the \nstakeholders. The resource savings will initially  accrue to PLN and the Government, then \ntransferred to outer island consumers through budget allocations for rural electrification and \ntargeted subsidy for small consumers. The Project will benefit consumers (through a consumer \nsurplus of Rp6.6 trillion) and labor (through jobs). The Government, however, will suffer an \neconomic loss due to inefficient resource use associated with domestic market price distortion \nrelative to world prices. The benefit is high because it includes the economic benefits from the \nmarket-based power supply for the whole Java-Bali power grid. \n \n2.  The net economic benefits (Rp6.3 trillion) accruing to each stakeholder were allocated \nbetween the poor and nonpoor. The marginal government expenditure required for project cost \nfinancing accruing to the poor was estimated using the income share of the poor (around 14%) \nin gross domestic product (GDP); 15% of the consumer surplus is assumed to go to the poor, \nbased on the estimate of poor consumers in Project area. Based on the projected rural labor \nemployed by the Project, 25% of the economic benefits accruing to unskilled labor are assumed \nto go to the poor. The net economic benefit to the poor is estimated at Rp950 billion during the \nProject operation, and the poverty impact ratio is estimated at 15.1%. \n \nTable A9: Poverty Impact Ratio of Core Subprojects \n(Rp million) \n \n   Financial  Economic  Difference  Distribution of Project Effects \n   Present  Present    PLN  Consumers Government/  Labor   \n Item  Values  Values        Economy    Total \nBenefits  82,448  6,702,349  6,619,901            \nCosts                  \n  Capital Costs  (93,871)  (98,358)  (4,488)      (4,724)  224    \n  O&M Costs  (12,627)  (306,526)  (293,900)      (309,368)  15,481    \nNet Present Value  (24,049)  6,297,465  6,321,514               \nGains and Losses    (24,049)  6,619,901  (314,092)  15,705  6,297,465 \nProportion of poor (%)    14  15  14  25   \nBenefits to poor    (3,367)  992,985  (43,973)  3,926  949,572 \nPoverty Impact Ratio (%)    15.1         \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n ", "  Appendix  10  47 \nREPORT OF SUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The Power Transmission Improvement Sector Project (the Project) is an environment B \nproject. It includes subprojects that will add 360 megavolt amperes (MVA) of transformation \ncapacity to the Java-Bali power sector, and 276 kilometers (km) of 150 kilovolt (kV) transmission \nline to interconnect power grids in outer islands. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was \nprepared  for  the  core  subproject  in  accordance  with  the  Environmental  Assessment \nRequirements of the Asian Development Bank. This sample summary IEE (SIEE) includes \nmajor findings and conclusions on the 150 kv Barikin-Tanjung transmission line (58 km) in \nKalimantan and was prepared for analytical purposes to show the nature of the Project, its likely \npotential impacts, and mitigation measures needed. \n \nB.  Description of the Core Subproject \n2.  The 58 km Barikin-Tanjung transmission line is in South Kalimantan Province, starting in \nBarikin Substation at Tower T-321 and proceeding northeast to T-530 at Tanjung Substation. \nMost of the land traversed by the line\u2019s right-of-way corridor is used for dry rice fields (40.14%), \nunderbrush (17.93%), orchards (7.77%), and other uses. In general, the dry rice fields are used \nto cultivate seasonal crops such as rice, corn, and several kind of fruits and vegetables, while \nthe orchards or market gardens are occupied by annual cropping plants such as rubber, palm \noil, coconut, durian, and others. \n \n3.  The Project is to proceed in three phases: preconstruction, construction, and operation. \nDuring  preconstruction,  the  main  activities  will  be  surveying,  site  investigation,  and  land \nacquisition  for  the  209  tower  sites  and  the  substations  in  Barikin  and  Tanjung.  During \nconstruction, the activities will be mobilization of work crews, construction of tower foundations, \ntower erection, and stringing. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n4.  With  the  exception  of  the  Meratus  Mountains  in  the  southeast  of  the  island,  and \nlimestone outcrops in the west (the highest, Mount Mulul, is 2,377 meters [m]), much of \nKalimantan\u2019s land area is barely above sea level. Kalimantan's monsoon climate brings dry \nwinds from the southeast from May to September; and moisture-laden winds from the northwest \nfrom October to March. Most rain falls from November to January, whereas July to September \nremain dry.  \n5.  Compared to other regions, Kalimantan still has a low level of industrialization. Its basic \ninfrastructure\u2014community services, health provision, piped water, and education\u2014is limited. \nThe poverty level is also high, associated with low incomes, subsistence agriculture such as rice \nfarming, smallholding rubber and coconut cultivation, and artisanal fishing. \n \n6.  The economy of Kalimantan is based on exploitation of its rich natural resources. Apart \nfrom gold and diamond mining, large-scale coal mining began in the late 19th century, followed \nby a series of oil booms. East Kalimantan has produced oil since the beginning of the 20th \ncentury, and liquefied natural gas is an important export. Kalimantan\u2019s forests also provide \nvaluable timber; large-scale lumber operations, which began in 1967, continue today at alarming \nrates.  \n \n ", "48  Appendix 10 \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n7.  The  Barikin-Tanjung  transmission  line  will  result  in  limited  negative  impacts  during \nconstruction and operation. Approximately 38 hectares (ha) of plantation belonging to 195 \nowners are to be cleared. Affected owners will be compensated for the vegetation cleared. The \ncleared land will be planted with low canopy plant. The total land requirement for the tower sites \nand substations was estimated to be 790 ha. A compensation procedure will be followed and \ndiscussed with landowners and affected persons. \n \n8.  During  the  operational  stage,  electric  and  magnetic  fields  will  result  from  power \ntransmission.  Based  on  PLN  consultation  research,  the  average  electric  and  magnetic \ninductions that resulted from the Java 150 kV transmission line are 193.4 volt per meter (V/m) \nand 2.0 micro-Tesla, respectively.  These values are below the World Health Organization \n(WHO) threshold values: 5,000 V/m for the electrical field and 100 micro-Tesla for magnetic field \nas recommended in WHO Publication No. 10 on nonionizing radiation protection for safety \nthreshold value for humans. Further, the ministerial decree of the minister of mines and energy \nNo. 01.P/47MPE/1992 stipulates minimum clearance between a conductor and ground for 150 \nkV transmission lines to minimize the potential public health hazard of a transmission line. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n9.  The environmental investigations made clear that only very minor environmental impacts \nare expected. The proposed institutional requirement and environmental monitoring activities for \nthe Project are compiled in Table A10. \n \nTable A10: Recommended Activities for Institutional Requirement \nand Environmental Monitoring Program \n \nActivities  Responsibility for  Assistance or \nExecution  Approval by \n1  Training sessions for key personnel of the  Environmental expert or  Internationally \nPLN planning department to address  scientist on behalf of PLN  experienced \n-  basics of environmental protection;  consultant, \n-  methodology and procedures of EIAs;   local university \n-  environment-friendly planning and   \nselection of sites and right of way for \nelectrification projects \n2   Assistance in detailed project planning  Environmental expert or  Local authorities \nactivities, especially for site surveys and  experienced engineer on \npreparation of project civil works  behalf of PLN \n3  Conflict management of land acquisition  Social development  Local authorities \nprocedures  expert on behalf of PLN   \n4  Establishment of an environmental  Environmental experts  Local authorities, \nmonitoring program   (e.g., biologist, chemist)  local university \n-  for project construction phase,  on behalf of PLN \n-  for the first 2 years from start-up of   \nproject operation \n \n ", "  Appendix  10  49 \nActivities  Responsibility for  Assistance or \nExecution  Approval by \n5  Supervision of project construction phase to  Environmental expert or  Independent local \nensure environment-friendly execution  experienced engineer on  environmental expert / \nbehalf of PLN  engineer in \ncollaboration with local \nauthorities \n6  Bimonthly preparation of environmental  Environmental expert or  Local authorities \nstatus reports during project construction   engineer on behalf of PLN \n7  Preparation of progress reports of  Environmental expert or  Local authorities \nenvironmental monitoring (two per year) for  engineer on behalf of PLN  \nfirst 2 years of project operation \n8  Establishment of an environmental  Environmental expert or  Local authorities, \nmanagement program for   engineer on behalf of PLN  local university \n-  subproject selection,  \n-  environmental review of subproject \nimplementation \nEIA = environmental impact assessment, PLN = State Electricity Enterprise \n \nF.   Findings and Recommendations \n10.  The IEE findings show that Barikin-Tanjung transmission line, by virtue of its limited \nconstruction requirements, will have a neutral, or only very small, influence on the environment. \nStarting  with  these  environmental  impacts,  PLN  will  incorporate  mitigation  proposals  and \nrecommendations for implementation in the later project phases. \n \nG.  Conclusions \n11.  The  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  are  limited  and  can  be  mitigated  by \nimplementing the recommended measures and environmental monitoring program. Appropriate \nbudget  has  been  allocated  in  the  Project  cost  for  this  purpose.  An  environmental  impact \nassessment is not required. \n \n ", "50  Appendix 11 \nSUMMARY OF SOCIAL SAFEGUARD STRATEGY \n \nA.  Background \n1.  The Power Transmission Improvement Sector Project includes the implementation of \nvarious subprojects in Java-Bali and Kalimantan, involving the construction of new substations \nand transmission lines and upgrading the capacity of some existing ones. Two core subprojects, \nrepresentative of the intervention types and regions, have been prepared. One core subproject \nentails land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) and compensation for right of way. Additional \nsubprojects will be identified after Loan approval and prepared during project implementation. \nLand impacts are expected to be small or medium.  \n \nB.  General Policy and Procedures for Land Acquisition and Resettlement  \n2.  LAR will be handled  in accordance to national law and the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) involuntary resettlement policy as detailed in the Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to \nGood Practice. LAR preparation requires (i) a common compensation policy framework and \nprocedural  guidelines  (CPFPG)  for  all  subprojects;  and  (ii)  individual  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement plans (LARPs) for subprojects. The preparation of a CPFPG, and the needed \nLARP for the core subproject was a condition for project appraisal. LARPs based on the \ndetailed  design  and  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  be  a  condition  for  financing  the  noncore \nsubprojects. \n \n3.  To meet these requirements State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) has prepared a CPFPG, \nand  one  LARP  for  the  core  subproject.  The  following  summarizes  the  CPFPG  and  core \nsubproject LARP.  \n   \n4.  The  noncore  subprojects  will  be  prepared  after  loan  approval.  Adequate  social \ndevelopment  capacity,  inclusive  of  LARP  and  IPDP  preparation,  will  be  injected  into  the \npostappraisal phases, which will include providing sufficient social development expertise in the \nconsulting  services  for  the  sector  project  implementation  consultant,  funded  under  the \nrenewable energy development sector project. \n \nC.  Land Acquisition And Resettlement  \n1.  Compensation Policy Framework and Procedural Guidelines  \n5.  The  CPFPG  reflect  the  main  project  preparation  and  implementation  principles:  (i) \nnegative impacts will be minimized; (ii) compensation will be sufficient to improve or at least \nrestore the preproject income and living standards of affected persons; (iii) affected persons will \nbe fully informed and consulted on compensation options and resettlement planning; (iv) asset \ncompensation  will  be  provided  at  replacement  rates;  and  (v)  lost  asset  compensation, \nreplacement dwellings, and rehabilitation provisions and allowances will be provided in full \nbefore ground leveling and demolition. ADB approval of a noncore subproject involving LARP \nwill be subject to ADB's approval of the LARP. \n     \n6.  The CPFPG also stipulate eligibility and entitlements for land, houses, income losses, \nand rehabilitation subsidies as follows:   \n(i)  Permanent agricultural and residential land losses will be compensated in cash \nat market rates. \n(ii)  Temporary land losses will be paid in cash at market rates. \n ", "  Appendix 11  51 \n(iii)  House and building losses will be compensated in cash at replacement rates, \nfree of demolition expenses and salvaged materials. \n(iv)  Crop losses will be paid to the affected persons in cash at market rates. \n(v)  Relocation  expenses  covering  transport  costs  will  be  paid  to  the  affected \npersons. \n(vi)  Business loss allowance based on tax declarations will be paid to each affected \npersons for each month of interruption of business activities. \n \n7.  As for LAR processing procedures, the CPFPG establish the following:  \n(i)  After subproject identification and completion of preliminary design, PLN will \ncarry out an ISA to determine preliminary impact data and the socioeconomic \nfeatures of the affected persons.  \n(ii)  If through this process, subproject impacts are identified as \u201csignificant,\u201d29 a full \nLARP will be prepared.  \n(iii)  If, however, the impacts are identified as less than \u201csignificant,\u201d only a short \nLARP will be prepared.30  \n \n2.  Institutional Responsibilities \n8.  The  sector  project  director,  through  the  social  development  unit,  has  the  overall \nsupervision, review, and financial responsibility for LAR. The subproject teams will prepare and \nimplement specific LARPs and share responsibility with local administrations for LAR, including \nasset valuation; consultation; entitlement delivery; and issuance of land acquisition, demolition, \nand building permits. Field tasks such as paying compensation, selecting replacement land, and \nproviding livelihood support will rest with village and local PLN personnel. \n \n3.  Disclosure and Public Consultation  \n9.  LARP  preparation  will  entail  intense  consultation  with  affected  families  through \nquestionnaires and community meetings involving the families and local subproject team and \ngovernments. A booklet summarizing the CPFPG will be sent to all affected families, and \nBahasa Indonesia CPFPG and LARPs will be made available in each affected village. The \nsame documents in English will be posted on ADB's web site and made available at the \nIndonesia Resident Mission in Jakarta.  \n \n4.  Grievance Procedures \n10.  Grievances will first be lodged with the villages. If no settlement is reached within 2 \nweeks, complaints can be raised to the land acquisition committee for the relevant district \n(established by presidential order). If still unresolved, outstanding cases can be sent to the \noffice of the head of local government. Final appeal for unsolved cases will be available in the \nappropriate courts of law. \n5.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n11.  The LARP will be internally and externally monitored. PLN has established a monthly \nreporting system involving the social development staff with the sector project director and in the \nregional subproject teams. External monitoring will be assigned to an independent monitoring \n                                                 \n29  Significant impacts are (i) 200 or more affected persons and (ii) 100 or more indigenous people or vulnerable \ngroups and affected persons.  \n30  For full and short LARP formats, see Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. \n ", "52  Appendix 11 \nagency. PLN will report to ADB on the LARP in quarterly progress reports. External monitoring \nreports will be submitted to ADB twice a year, detailing the progress in implementing each \nLARP until its conclusion. At the end of the implementation of subproject, the independent \nmonitoring agency will prepare a report evaluating the results of the whole resettlement program \nand assessing affected families rehabilitation and satisfaction. \n \n6.  Finances \n12.  Each LARP will establish unit compensation rates for items negatively affected by the \nsubproject and will provide a detailed budget for LAR compensation. The budget will include (i) \nland compensation, resettlement subsidies, and house improvement or replacement; (ii) income \nrestoration assistance; (iii) relocation allowances; (iv) management costs; (v) monitoring and \nevaluation; (vi) taxes; and (vii) contingency. Cost estimates will be adjusted annually based on \nthe inflation rate of the preceding year. Total cost of the resettlement program for the core \nsubprojects has been estimated at Rp5.6 billion. Cost estimates for the noncore subprojects will \nbe included in the respective LARPs. \n \nD.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plans for Core Subproject  \n13.  The core subproject is the 150 kV Barikin-Tanjung transmission line in Kalimantan and \nrequires a full LARP. The LARP prepared reflects the stipulation of the CPFPG outlined above \nand provides information on compensation rates, consultation activities, and budgets. This \nsubproject entails the construction of a new transmission line (58 km), expansion of the Barikin \nsubstation, and the construction of the Tanjung substation. A full LARP based on an advanced \nfeasibility design survey has been prepared and indicates that the subproject will acquire 6.1 \nhectare, of which 44% is farmland. The project will not cause building losses or resettlement. \nImpacts on trees are being assessed and will be documented in the final LARP based on \ndetailed design. Overall, the affected families will be 129 (548 persons). The LARP program \ncosts Rp5.6 billion. \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R326-02 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20021129111431Z", "Title": "R326-02", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 4.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20030205151803+08'00'"}}
