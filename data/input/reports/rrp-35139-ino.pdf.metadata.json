The sample summary IEE is a core appendix. IEEs will \nbe undertaken for selected noncore subprojects. \n \nThe Power Transmission Improvement Sector Project will comprise \nvarious  core  and  noncore  subprojects  that  add  360  megawatt-\namperes  (MVA)  of  transformation  capacity  to  remove  substation \ncapacity bottlenecks in Java-Bali, and 276 kilometers of 150 kilovolt \n(kV)  transmission  line  to  interconnect  power  grids  in  the  outer \nislands. The Project will also create the necessary market facilities \nto establish and operate a competitive electricity market.  \n \nPower  transmission  bottlenecks  in  Java  must  be  removed  and \nsome  small  power  grids  in  the  outer  islands  interconnected  to \nmaintain  quality  of  power  supply  and  improve  efficiency.  Further, \nthe  new  electricity  law  requires  that  within  5  years  the  price  of \npower  generated  be  set  on  a  competitive  basis  so  the  required \nfacilities  for  the  power  system  and  market  operator  have  to  be \ncreated in Java-Bali. \n \nThe  Project  will  (i)  remove  power  supply  bottlenecks  in  selected \npower substations and medium-voltage  transmission  lines in Java; \n(ii) \nisland  power  grids;  and  (iii)  provide \ninformation  and  communication  technology  (ICT)-based equipment \nfor  a  competitive  electricity  market  and  consulting  services  to \nsupervise its installation. \n \nTotal project cost, including price contingencies and interest during \nconstruction, is estimated at $175 million, comprising foreign costs \nof  $125.9  million  (72%)  and  $49.1  million  equivalent  of  local  costs \n(18%).  \n \n\ninterconnect  outer \n\nSource \n\nForeign \n($ million) \n125.9 \n0.0 \n\nLocal \n($ million) \n14.1 \n35.0 \n\nTotal \n($ million) \n140.0 \n35.0 \n\nADB \nGovernment \nand PLN \nTotal \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PLN = State Electricity Enterprise \n\n125.9 \n\n175.0 \n\n49.1 \n\n100 \n\nTotal Cost \n(%) \n80 \n20 \n\n \n\nii \n\n \n\n \n \nBorrower \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nObjectives \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementing Agency  PLN \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\niii \n\n \nA  loan  of  $140  million  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  The \nloan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-\nend  fee  of  1.0%,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in \nthe draft Loan and Project Implementation Agreements.  \n \nThe proceeds of the ADB loan will be relent to the State Electricity \nEnterprise (PLN) on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. PLN \nwill  bear  interest  rate  variation  and  foreign  exchange  risks  on  the \nloan. \n \nUntil 30 September 2008 \n \n31 March 2008 \n\n \nDirectorate  General  for  Electricity  and  Energy  Utilization  in  the \nMinistry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources  of  the  Government  of \nIndonesia  \n \n\n \nPLN  has  decentralized  day-to-day  operations  and  project \nmanagement  to  strategic  business  units  (SBUs).  A  full-time sector \nproject  director  has  been  appointed  to  the  PLN  headquarters  to \ncoordinate  ADB-funded  project  implementation. The sector project \ndirector  is  supported  by  staff  to  coordinate  specific  functions,  i.e., \nproject  implementation  and  schedule,  procurement,  design  and \nengineering,  environment,  land  acquisition,  and  compensation. \nSubproject managers will be appointed to the SBUs, and subproject \nteams  will  be  established  to  oversee  the  implementation  of \nindividual  subprojects.  PLN  will  assign  enough  qualified  and \nexperienced  staff  to  the  sector  project  director  and  subproject \nmanagers.  ADB-funded  consultants  will  assist  PLN staff in project \nimplementation. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nProcurement \n\n \n\nthe \n\ninstallation  of \n\nlocal  competitive  bidding \n\nICT-based  equipment.  The \n\nAll procurement to be financed under the Project will be carried out \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The various \nprocurement  threshold  limits  are  the  following:  (i)  international \ncompetitive  bidding  for  (a)  supply  contracts  of  $500,000  or  more; \nand  (b)  turnkey  contracts  packages  of  $1  million  or  more;  (ii) \ninternational  shopping  for  supply  contracts  of  $100,000\u2013500,000; \n(iii) \nfor  all  civil  works  contracts, \nconstruction  of  transmission  lines,  and  equipment  erection  of \n$100,000  to  $1  million;  and  (iv)  direct  purchase  for  all  contracts \nbelow  $100,000.  The  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  to  be \nfollowed will be subject to ADB\u2019s approval. \n \nA  sector  project  implementation  consultant  will  be  engaged  by  PLN \nunder  the  renewable  energy  development  sector  project  to  help \nsupervise the implementation of subprojects under it and this Project \nconcurrently.  \n \nAn  ICT  consultant  will  be  engaged  under  the  Project  to  help \nsupervise \nICT \nconsultant  will  be  recruited  by  PLN  using  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  ICT  consultant  will \nprovide  an  estimated  48  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices.  \n \nThe  Project  will  help  remove  supply  bottlenecks  in  Java-Bali  and \nintegrate  medium-sized  power  grids  in  the  outer  islands  to  help \nachieve  economies  of  scale.  The  Project  will  improve  economic \nproductivity in subproject areas by enhancing energy efficiency and \nreliability of power supply. The labor force, which includes the poor \nworking  in  the  informal  sectors,  will  be  assured  of  continued \nemployment. \n \nThe creation of an ICT-based competitive electricity market in Java-\nBali  is  central  to  the  ongoing  power  sector  restructuring  program \nand  mandated  by  the  new  electricity  law.  The  competition  and \nconsequent  efficiency  gain  in  power  generation  are  envisioned  to \nlower  the  bulk  electricity  price  and  bring  it  closer  to  the  marginal \ncost,  which  will  also  lower  the  average  retail  electricity  price.  The \nlower retail price will bring a direct gain to all households connected \nto the power grid, including the poor. \n \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nand \n\nefficient \n\napproval, \n\nprocurement, \n\nProject  success  depends  on  (i)  the  Government's  approval  of \nrevaluation  of  PLN\u2019s  assets,  and  a  gradual  increase  of  electricity \ntariff  from  2003;  (ii)  PLN\u2019s  decentralization  and  empowerment  of \nSBUs;  and  (iii)  timely  preparation  of  required  documents  for \nproject \nsubproject \nimplementation.  The  Government  has  assured  ADB  that  PLN's \nassets  will  be  revalued  and  the  tariff  increased on time; and PLN \nhas approved the establishment of support functions for SBUs. The \nthrough  close \nfor  success  will  be  minimized \nlast  condition \nmonitoring  and  ADB  review  missions.  The  Project  is  in  the \ninfrastructure  sector  with  revenue  in  the  domestic  currency, \nexposing  the  investment  to  the  foreign  exchange  rate.  Ongoing \nreforms  aim  at  macroeconomic  stability.  Over  the  long  run,  power \nsector  restructuring  will  allow  managing  the  price  risk  through  the \ncompetitive electricity market. Until this is possible, the Government \nwill  gradually  raise  the  electricity  tariff  to  an  appropriate  level  and \nreintroduce  an  automatic  tariff  adjustment  mechanism  to  maintain \nfinancial viability. \n \nThe  timely  and  successful  implementation  of  the  competitive \nelectricity  market  is  subject  to  the  Government  maintaining  its \ncommitment  to  the  restructuring  and  implementation  schedule. \nAlthough  competitive  electricity  markets  have  developed  and \noperate  successfully  in  several  countries,  international  experience \nunderscores the risks related to market dominance and limitation on \nbilateral contracts. The design of the market in Indonesia takes into \naccount  these  factors  and  the  specific  features  of  the  Java-Bali \npower  system.  The  new  electricity  law  provides  5  years  to  start \ncompetition  in  power  generation.  Provisions  have  also  been  made \nfor  retail  competition,  which  will  be  gradually  introduced  later.  The \nGovernment  also  confirmed  that  the  regulatory  body  will  be \nestablished  within  1  year  in  accordance  with  the  electricity  law  to \nensure  timely  implementation  of  the  competitive  market  and  an \nindependent tariff regime.  \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n \n-\n1\n \n\ni\n\ni\n\n \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Power Transmission Improvement (PTI) Sector Project.  \n \n2. \nAt  the  request  of  the  Government  of  Indonesia,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \napproved  a  project  preparation  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  power  transmission \nimprovement project.1 The project proposal was included in the Country Assistance Plan (2001-\n2003) and it is now titled the PTI Sector Project. The sector project framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES  \n\nA. \n\nPower Sector Overview    \n\n3. \nThe formulation of power sector development policies is the responsibility of the Ministry \nof Energy and Mineral Resources, which discharges its control and regulatory functions through \nthe  Directorate  General  for  Electricity  and  Energy  Utilization  (DGEEU).  State  Electricity \nEnterprise (PLN) is responsible for developing and operating the power sector and serves over \n30  million  consumers.  The  Ministry  for  State-Owned Enterprises exercises sole shareholder's \npowers  on  behalf  of  the  Government.  PLN's  total  installed power generation capacity reached \n21,000  megawatts  (MW)  in  December  2001.  PLN\u2019s  operational  assets  also  include  24,800 \ncircuit-kilometers  (cct-km)  of  transmission  lines;  substation  capacity  of  50,000  megavolt-\namperes  (MVA);  and  medium-  and  low-voltage  lines  totaling  287,500  cct-km.  The  Java-Bali \npower grid has 74% of the installed capacity, with the rest spread over 1,100 power grids. \n \n4. \nPLN's  installed  power  generation  capacity  outside  Java-Bali (the outer islands) is only \n5,270  MW  (2000),  and  the  total  energy  sale,  16.7  terawatt-hour  (TWh)  (2000).  The  area's \ngeographical features (islands and inhabited forests) have fragmented the power grid into small \nseparate grids, some with less than 10 MW capacity. Economies of scale are possible, and as \npower demand grows, the grids must interconnect. Increasing the size of the power grids allows \noperation  of  larger  and  more  efficient  power  generation  units.  The  south,  central,  and  west \nSumatra power grids are being interconnected under an ongoing ADB loan.2  The power grid of \nEast  Kalimantan  has  a  capacity  of  140  MW,  and  South  Kalimantan,  340  MW;  over  62%  of \nenergy  production  is  diesel-based.  The  interconnection  of  the  two  grids  will  help  optimize \noperations,  improve  the  reliability  of  power  supply,  and  facilitate  the  transfer  of  60  MW  power \nfrom East to South Kalimantan instead of building a new power plant. \n  \n5. \nElectricity is also generated by power plants with an aggregate capacity of about 12,000 \nMW.  Large  industries  and  businesses  own  and operate the plants, and PLN customers own \nabout half of these captive power plants, allowing these electricity users to buy power from PLN \nor  generate  their  own.  Since  the  plants  are  unregulated,  sufficient  data  is  not  available  to \ndetermine the actual amount of electricity used, or the impact of tariffs on PLN\u2019s power demand. \nIndependent power producers (IPPs), which are under contract to sell all their power output to \nPLN, have the capacity to generate another 3,000 MW. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   TA 3807-INO: Regional Power Transmission and Competitive Market Development, for $500,000, approved on 18 \n\nDecember 2001 and financed under the Japan Special Fund.  \n\n2   Loan 1397-INO: Power Development and Efficiency Enhancement Project, for $337 million ($176.61 net amount) \n\napproved on 24 October 1995.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2\n\n \n\nPLN's  power  supply  extends  to  49,000  (84%)  of  58,000  villages,  and  53%  of  the \n6. \nestimated  52  million  households  are  PLN\u2019s  customers.  The  reliability  of  power  supply  has \ngenerally been better than in many other developing member countries (DMCs), and Java-Bali \nhas  not  experienced  a  system-wide  power  failure  in  the  past  5  years  despite  PLN\u2019s  financial \nproblems.  Industrial  and  commercial  customers  find  the  electricity  tariff  competitive.  Reduction \nof  the  subsidy  on  liquid  fuels 3  will  increase  the  cost  of  self-generation  and  improve  the \ncompetitiveness of PLN's supply. \n \nDuring  1998-2002,  the  capacity  factor  increased  by  about  3%,  which  indicates  that  the \n7. \nexisting power stations are generating more energy. The load factor has remained in the 67.5\u2013\n69.5%  range,  indicating  that  the  growth  in  peak  power  demand  has  been  normal.  The  tariff \nstructure  for  large  consumers  includes  a  multiplier  to  reflect  a  higher  supply  during  evening \nhours.  PLN  has  also  introduced  measures  that  allow  it  to  negotiate  lower  tariffs  to  encourage \ndemand-side management. Although the average electricity tariff has risen significantly in recent \nyears, it still remains lower than alternate options, and so energy sales have not been affected \nmuch.  \n \nB. \n\nPower Sector Development Plan \n\n8. \nUntil  1997,  DGEEU  and  PLN  regularly  prepared  power  sector  development  plans  to \nreflect  an  annual  energy  sales  growth  rate  of  about  12%,  and  resources  were  mobilized  to \nimplement  these  plans.  Although  the  plans  were  optimistic,  PLN  could  acquire  resources  to \nimplement new  projects.  In  1997,  about  70%  surplus  generation  capacity  was  available  and \nseveral  new  power  generation  projects  were  under  implementation,  some  by  IPPs.  The  crisis \nhad two significant impacts: (i) the growth of energy sales slowed, reducing the urgency to add \nnew  power  generation  capacity;  and  (ii)  the  electricity  tariffs  could  only  be  gradually  raised  to \nreflect  increased  cost  of  electricity  supply,  so  financial  performance  results  of  PLN  were  poor \nand  it  could  not  borrow  for  capital  investment.  These  factors  introduced  considerable \nuncertainties in the power sector planning process, and available resources barely allowed PLN \nto complete ongoing projects.  \n \n9. \nThe  situation  has  gradually  changed.  The  annual  energy  sales  growth  is  now  about \n10%,  and  although  the  economic  forecasts  still  lack  clarity,  PLN  has  prepared  power  demand \nprojections  corresponding  to  annual  economic  growth  of  3.5\u20136.0%  and  an  increase  in \nelectrification ratio4 from 53% to 75% by 2010. A summary of the power development plan, i.e., \nthe  forecast  of  demand  growth  and  capacity  additions  required  in  the  power  sector,  is  in \nAppendix  2.  The  electricity  tariff  was  gradually  raised  during  2000\u20132002, and the Government \nplans to keep raising it to a level of full cost recovery and a reasonable rate of return by 2005. \nThe  projected  higher  electricity  sales  revenue  will  allow  PLN  to  meet  the  operating  costs \n(including  power  purchase  from  IPPs)  and  borrow  funds  for  the  new  investment  required  to \nsatisfy  power  demand  growth.  A  delay  in  new  investment  will  reduce  the  reliability  of  PLN\u2019s \npower supply, and the Java-Bali power grid could have a power shortfall by 2005. To address \nsuch  concerns,  large  consumers  may  decide  to  implement  new  captive  power  plants,  which \nwould be a less efficient and environment-friendly outcome. \n\n                                                 \n3   The competitiveness of PLN\u2019s supply can be established because of the low barrier for installing captive power \nplants.  If  large  customers  assign  a  low  value  to  the  supply,  they  will  use  self-generation,  reducing  PLN\u2019s  energy \nsales.  \n\n4   The  electrification  ratio  is  the  number  of  households  connected  to  PLN  supply  divided  by  the  total  number  of \n\nhouseholds. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nC. \n\nPower Sector Policies    \n\n10. \nBased  on  the  Government\u2019s  Power  Sector  Restructuring  Policy  (August  1998),  ADB \napproved a policy-based program loan (the Program) and the associated capacity-building loan \n(TA Loan).5 The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) also approved a loan of $400 \nmillion,  disbursed  in  two  equal  tranches,  and  linked  to  the  release  of  the  two  program  loan \ntranches. The first program loan tranche of $200 million was disbursed in March 1999 and the \nBoard's approval is being sought for the release of the second tranche following the enactment \nand promulgation of the Electricity Law 20 on 23 September 2002.6 \n \n11. \nThe  Program  seeks  to  make  the  power  sector  more  efficient  and  financially  viable by \nestablishing  a  competitive  electricity  market  in  Java-Bali. The  new electricity law provides the \nnecessary legal framework. The law  allows  ventures  to  obtain  licenses  for  different  functions: \ngeneration, transmission, distribution, sales (only for low-voltage consumers), sales agency (for \nhigh-  and  medium-voltage  consumers  and  may  include  low-voltage  consumers),  market \noperation,  and  system  operation.  The  various  ventures  will  be  undertaken  separately  by \ndifferent enterprises, which will prevent reintegration and limit the market power of participants. \nThe electricity generation ventures will be subject to competition and are specifically prohibited \nfrom acquiring market dominance. The transmission and distribution ventures will be recognized \nas  natural  monopolies,  but  will  be  required  to  provide  open  access  with  tariff  regulated  by  the \npower  market  supervisory  agency  (the  regulatory  body)  that  will  be  established  within  1  year. \nElectricity supply ventures and supply agencies will buy electricity from the electricity market or \nthrough bilateral contracts and sell to consumers. The market organizer will determine electricity \nmarket prices and the system operator will match supply and demand according to market rules \nset by the regulatory body. The market organizer and system operator will be accountable and \nimpartial  to,  and  financed  by  charges  paid  by,  the  market  participants.  The  transmission \nventure, market operation, and system operation will first be integrated and later separated as \nbusiness activities grow. The new electricity law also stipulates that the electricity sales price for \ngeneration  and  for  medium-  and  high-voltage  consumers  will  be  based  on  natural  and  sound \ncompetition.  Based  on  the  consensus  reached  in  the  House  of  Representatives  (DPR), \ncompetition  will  start  in  power  generation  within  5  years.  Based  on  the  progress  made  during \nthis period, the electricity law will allow the regulatory body to extend licenses to interested sales \nagents. These agents can also start buying electricity form the market once it is established and \nsell to some medium-  and  high-voltage  consumers  on  a  competitive  basis.  In  the  absence  of \nsales agents, however, the regulatory body will set the electricity price for all the consumers.  \n \nD. \n\nImplementing Agency     \n\n1. \n\nState  Electricity  Enterprise \nDevelopment \n\n(PLN)  Reorganization  and  Community \n\n12. \nPLN  has  a  two-tier  management  with  a  five-member  board  of  commissioners  of \nnominated  government  officials,  and  a  five-member  full-time  board  of  directors  lead  by  the \npresident  director.  The  management  is  fully  responsible  for  formulating  and  implementing \ncorporate strategies and business plans for utility operations, investments, finance, and human \nresources. Independent auditors review and submit a report on the company\u2019s annual financial \nstatements.  PLN  will  retain  its  primary  license  for  power  generation,  transmission,  and \n                                                 \n5   Loan 1673-INO: Power Sector Restructuring Program, for $380 million, and Loan 1674-INO: Capacity Building for \n\nEstablishment of a Competitive Electricity Market, for $20 million, both approved on 23 March 1999.  \n\n6     Indonesia:  Progress  Report  of  the  Power  Sector  Restructuring  Program  (Loan  1673-INO),  planned  for  Board \n\nconsideration on a no objection basis by 9 December 2002. \n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\ndistribution until the enterprise is unbundled in accordance with the new electricity law. PLN has \n(i)  two  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  that  own  and  operate  the  power  plants  in  Java-Bali; (ii) one \npower  transmission  unit  in  Java-Bali;  (iii)  two  operation  units  in  Sumatra  responsible  for \ngeneration and transmission; (iv) 16 regional operation units7 in the outer islands and four power \ndistribution  units  in  Java;  and  (v)  several  support  services  for  engineering,  construction, \nproduction,  etc.  PLN  is  being  reorganized  in  anticipation  of  the  structural  changes.  A  World \nBank-funded  international  consulting  firm  is  assisting  PLN  in  financial  and  organizational \nrestructuring.  \n \n13. \nTo  facilitate  the  transition  to  an  unbundled  power  sector,  the  focus  now  is  on \ndecentralization and empowerment of operational units by making them strategic business units \n(SBUs).  The  corporate  office,  which  earlier  made  all  decisions  in  operational  and  investment-\nrelated  matters,  is  now  transforming  itself  as  a  \u201cholding  company\u201d  with  SBUs  as  \u201cvirtual\u201d \nsubsidiaries. During the past 2 years, many corporate staff have been relocated to SBUs. SBU \ngeneral  managers  now  exercise  full  responsibility  for  energy  sales,  including  the  expansion  of \nthe  distribution  network.  The  larger  generation  and  transmission  projects  are  implemented \nunder the direct control of the corporate office. However, in the next phase of decentralization, \nSBU  managers  will  share  responsibility  for  procurement  and  be  fully  responsible  for  the \nimplementation  of  all  the  projects  in  their  respective  regions.  SBUs  will  eventually  have  the \nflexibility  to  negotiate  agreements  for  power  purchase  at  the  local  level  based  on  projected \nenergy  sale  and  revenue.  With  the  strengthening  of  managerial  capacity,  SBUs  are  well \npositioned  to  coordinate  the  development  and  management  of  the  regional  power  sector  with \nthe  provincial  and  regency  governments.  When  local  governments  establish  their  financial \ncapacity  to  invest  in  regional  development  and  are  prepared  to  adjust  the  regional  electricity \ntariffs  to  reflect  the  full  cost  of  the  power  supply  in  the  region,  SBUs  are  envisaged  to  be \nseparated from PLN as jointly owned subsidiaries. The new electricity law allows such vertically \nintegrated  power  companies  in  the  outer  islands  to  be  owned  by  the  private  sector.  Like  any \nnetwork  industry,  economies  of  scale  are  available  in  the  power  sector.  While  administrative \ndecentralization may transfer authority to nearly 400 regencies and cities, fragmentation of the \npower sector is not advisable.  \n   \n14. \nPLN  has  adopted  another  three  programs  to  directly  benefit  the  poor  and  small \nconsumers: (i) the rural business service, which has benefited 75,000 small entrepreneurs and \nhelped  create  29,000  jobs  for  villagers;  (ii)  the  rural  electrification  loan,  which  provides  low-\ninterest loans to poor households unable to pay the new connection charge (about Rp60 billion \nto 781,000 consumers);  and (iii) the program to empower small businesses and cooperatives, \nwhich  extends  loans  for  working  capital,  and  grants  for  training,  quality  improvement,  and \nmarketing  to  small  businesses  and  cooperatives  (about  Rp207  billion\u2014Rp173  billion  as  loans \nand  Rp34  billion  as  pledges\u2014to  over  43,000  units).  With  its  improved  financial  results,  PLN \nallocated Rp13 billion to the scheme in 2002 and 2003.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPLN Financial Management \n\n15. \nPLN\u2019s  financial  strategy  is  based  on  strict  budget  control  over  SBUs  and  operational \nunits,  stringent  cash  flow  norms  to  maintain  a  reasonable  level  of  power  supply  within  the \nfinancial  constraints,  proposals  to  gradually  increase  tariff  levels  for  Government  approval, \n\n                                                 \n7   The  regional  operation  units,  or  wilayahs,  in  the  outer  islands  have  relatively  lower  annual  energy  sales  (1.5 \nterawatt-hours  [TWh])  and  number  of  consumers  (870,000).  Being  small,  the  regional  operation  units  need  to \noperate as vertically integrated utilities.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\ndetermination of the subsidy necessary to offset the partial cost recovery from small consumers, \nand efficient energy billing and bill collection.  \n \n16. \nA  detailed  analysis  of  PLN  financial  performance  is  in  Appendix  3.  The  main \ncomponents  of  operating  costs  are  power  purchase,  fuel  and  lubricants,  maintenance, \npersonnel, and depreciation. The trend for these and other important operational parameters is \nbetter  than  that  in  other  DMC  utilities,  particularly  the  low  energy  losses  (11.5\u201313.5%)  and \nreceivables (33-40 days). The debt service cost for foreign currency loans acquired before the \ncrisis  is  now  higher  and,  based  on  the  policy  of  the  early  1990s,  PLN  now  buys  more  power \nfrom  IPPs  instead  of  investing  in  new  power  generation  capacity.8  It  avoided  incurring  larger \ndebt to build about 3,000 MW of new capacity. \n \nPLN  has  pursued  an  efficiency  improvement  program  based  on  an  operational  and \n17. \ncapital  expenditure  audit  carried  out  by  international  experts  in  1999.  All  units  were  assigned \nloss  reduction  targets,  which  involved  several  actions  such  as reduction of fuel consumption, \ninventory levels, maintenance costs, and the billing cycle. Steps were also taken for customer \nvoltage  improvement,  load  balancing,  and  efficient  procurement  of  spares  and  consumables. \nPLN estimates that the resultant savings in 2001 were Rp1 trillion. \n \n18. \nUnder  the  1985  electricity  law,  the  Government  sets  the  electricity  tariff  for  various \nconsumer categories to allow PLN to recover all its costs. While this had not been particularly \ndifficult until 1997, the Government has faced a challenge since then in raising tariffs to adjust \nfor  the  higher  costs.  Wider  support  and  greater  transparency  are  now  needed,  including \ndiscussions  in  the  DPR.  A  sharp  increase  in  electricity  tariff  would  be  inflationary,  reduce \ndomestic  savings,  and  thus  slow  economic  recovery.  Despite  the  difficulties,  the  average \nrevenue from electricity sales has increased from Rp211 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in 1999 (when \nADB appraised the Program loan) to Rp437/kWh in June 2002. To offset a lower tariff for small \nhouseholds  (decided  by  DPR),  a  subsidy  of  Rp6.7  trillion  covering  a  period  of  3  years  was \ntransferred to PLN in 2001.  \n \n19. \nAnother  correction  remains  for  PLN  to  incorporate  in  its  balance  sheet.  The  net  asset \nvalue does not reflect  the  fair  replacement  value.  The  Government  and  PLN  are  discussing  a \nproposal to revalue the assets to increase the net asset value from Rp54 trillion to about Rp173 \ntrillion  on  1  January  2002.  The  asset  revaluation  will  attract  a  one-time  tax,  which  may  be \nspread  over  5  years,  and  increase  annual  provisions  for  depreciation.  The  higher  charges  will \ncause  PLN  to  incur  a  loss  in  2002  and  2003,  although  the  cash  generation  (addition  of  net \nincome and depreciation) is not expected to change significantly. \n \nE. \n\nADB\u2019s Strategy in the Power Sector \n\nDMCs  should  make  more  energy  available  in  a  least-cost  and  environment-friendly \n20. \nmanner, and improve access to it for all, particularly the poor. Mobilizing the required resources \nwill require establishing greater transparency and a competitive environment to promote private \nsector  investment,  and  increasing  supply-  and  demand-side  efficiencies.  Energy  sector \ndevelopment  must  also  be  environmentally  sustainable.  Regional  and  global  environmental \nimpacts must thus be mitigated and greater use of renewable energy sources encouraged. To \nensure  that  its  future  operations  reflect  these  requirements,  ADB  prioritizes  reducing  poverty, \npromoting  private  sector  involvement,  addressing  regional  and  global  environmental  impacts, \n\n                                                 \n8   The share of purchased energy has increased from 2% in 1997 to 15% in 2001.  \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\nand  promoting  regional  cooperation.  ADB  interventions  take  into  account  the  varying  physical \nfeatures, resource endowments, and economic standards of DMCs.  \n \n21. \nThe 1999 Program loan to Indonesia will be fully disbursed in 2002. The next significant \nchange will take place at end-2007, when the competitive electricity market will be established \nin  Java-Bali.  ADB  is  envisaged  to  consider  another  policy-based  loan  to  support  market \ndevelopment.  \n \nF. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nin  southern  Sumatra;  and  (ii) \n\n22. \nBased on implementation experience of recent projects, particular attention will be given \nto  (i)  availability  of  counterpart  funds,  (ii)  security  concerns  that  delay  project  implementation, \n(iii) streamlined internal procedures for selection of contractors, and (iv) timely availability of the \nright-of-way for transmission lines.  \n \n23. \nCounterpart  funds  have  become  significantly  more  available  with  the  increase  in  the \nelectricity  tariff,  which  will  eventually  be  high  enough  to  generate  sufficient  cash  for  operation \nand  capital  expenditure  without  budgetary  support.  PLN  decentralization  will  allow  field \nmanagers  to  closely  monitor  project  implementation  and  take  timely  corrective  steps  when \nnecessary.  Closer  working  ties  with  provincial  and  regency  governments  will  help  address \nsecurity concerns; and right-of-way  issues  will  be  addressed  by  preparing  the  land  acquisition \nand resettlement plans (LARPs) using a participatory process.  \n \nPLN is the Implementing Agency for two ongoing projects9 that are classified as \"at risk\": \n24. \n(i)  the  1993  Power  XXIII  project,  which  includes  the  implementation  of  the  86  MW  Musi \nhydropower  project \nincludes \nimplementation  of  522  km  of  a  275  kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line  in  Sumatra, and the 86 MW \nPeusangan  hydropower  project  in  Aceh  Province  in  Sumatra.  The  Musi  hydropower  project's \nconstruction  was  suspended  in  December  1997  along  with  that  of  a  large  number  of \ninfrastructure projects to limit export credit borrowings. In August 2000, considering that most of \nthe  civil  works  had  been  completed,  ADB  approved  the  use  of  loan  savings  to  substitute  the \nexport  credit  to  build  the  power  plant,  albeit  considerably  delayed.  PLN  is  now  evaluating  the \nbids  for  the  equipment  packages,  and  contract  award  is  expected  by  end-2002. Transmission \nline  construction  in  Sumatra  was  considerably  delayed  because  of  difficulties  in  obtaining  the \nright of way. By August 2002, 87% of the length had been completed. In June 2002, the district \nadministration took the lead in finalizing amicable settlements with the affected people, which is \nhelping in the construction of the remaining section. Commissioning of all transmission lines is \nplanned  by  end-2002.  In  Peusangan,  however,  little  site  work  has  been  possible because of \nsecurity concerns in Aceh. The Government is unable to unilaterally suspend the project as that \nwould adversely influence the ongoing political efforts to find a basis for sharing all resources.10 \nThrough  collaborative  efforts  of  the  Government,  provincial  government,  and  the  military,  a \nsecurity  action  plan  was  prepared  in  June  2002,  and  is  considered  acceptable  by  prospective \ncivil  works  contractors.  PLN  will  seek  JBIC's  approval  to  rebid  the  civil  works  contract  and \nextend the loan closing date to 2008, and request an extension of the ADB loan. These steps \nprovide  an  opportunity  to  implement  the  Peusangan  hydropower  project,  which  will  help  avoid \npower  shortage  in  the  province  and  promote  balanced  regional  development,  which  were  the \n                                                 \n9 Loan 1271-INO: Power XXIII Project, for $275 million ($201.89 million net amount after cancellations), approved in \n\nthe  1995  project,  which \n\nNovember 1993; and Loan 1397-INO (footnote 2).  \n\n10  The  Aceh  government  supports  the  project,  and  the  additional  power  generation  capacity  is  needed  to  avoid \nsevere power shortages. JBIC is cofinancing the front-end civil works and consulting services, and its loan is also \nopen. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nADB loan's objectives. The long delay in implementing the three project components will keep \nimplementation  progress  as  only  partly  satisfactory,  and  so  the  projects  will  technically  be \nconsidered  \"at  risk.\"  However,  when  completed,  the  projects  will  provide  the  urgently  needed \ninfrastructure to mitigate power shortage in different parts of Sumatra. \n \nG. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n25. \nExternal  assistance  (Appendix  4)  has  played  a  key  role  in  expanding  PLN\u2019s  power \nsupply system and diversifying its generation mix. Although the private sector will be playing an \nincreasing  role  in  expanding  power  generation,  PLN  will  continue  to  invest  significantly  in  the \ntransmission and distribution systems, and will continue to need assistance from multilateral and \nbilateral sources.  \n \n26. \nSince 1970, ADB has approved 28 energy sector projects in Indonesia with a combined \nvalue of $3.13 billion for the power sector and a gas transmission project. ADB has also given \nIndonesia  37  TA  grants  totaling  over  $13.6  million  for  studies  on hydropower and geothermal \nimpact \npower  development,  rural  and  renewable  energy  development,  environmental \nassessment, energy efficiency, human resource planning, coal sector policy, gas utilization, gas \nregulatory framework, electricity tariffs, strategic planning, etc. \n \nADB has coordinated its operations in the power sector with other agencies, particularly \n27. \nthe World Bank and JBIC, on efficiency improvement, cost recovery, private sector involvement, \nand  restructuring.  The  World  Bank  has  provided  29  energy  sector  loans  since  1969,  with  a \ncombined value of $5.01 billion. The World Bank fielded a pre-appraisal mission in September \n2002 for an energy sector project proposal to be considered for approval in early 2003, which \nincludes,  (i)  about  $90  million  for  critical  transmission  de-bottlenecking projects, (ii) about $25 \nmillion  for  information  system  to  support  PLN's  reorganization,  and  (iii)  about  $2  million  for \ninstitutional  strengthening.  JBIC  has  provided  127  overseas  development  assistance  (ODA) \nprojects  in  the  energy  sector  for  a  total  of  about  $4.6  billion  equivalent,  and  14  non-ODA \nprojects  for  a  total  of  about  $3.6  billion  equivalent.  Further  JBIC  assistance  to  resume  the \nimplementation of the IPP-owned Tanjung Jati B power plant (1,320 MW) is expected by end-\n2002.  \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope  \n\n28. \nThe Project will (i) remove power supply bottlenecks in selected power substations and \nmedium-voltage  transmission  lines  in  Java-Bali,  (ii)  interconnect  outer-island  power grids, and \n(iii) provide information and communication technology (ICT)-based equipment for a competitive \nelectricity market and consulting services to supervise its installation. \n \n29. \nThe Java-Bali power grid subprojects will add power transformers (360 MW), switchyard \nbays  (37),  indoor  switchgear  feeders  (48),  150  kV  transmission  lines  (upgrading  113  km  and \nconstructing  129  km),  and  capacitors  (120  megavolt-ampere-reactive  [MVAr])  to  remove \nbottlenecks in power supply to major load centers with  increasing power demand, which are in \nJakarta,  Serang  in  West  Java,  Bandung  and  Semarang  in  Central  Java,  and  Malang  in  East \nJava.  The  augmentation  of  substation  capacity  will  avoid  adverse  impacts  from  power \ninterruption caused by substation overload, or  low voltage supply. The installed capacity of the \npower  grid  in  East  Kalimantan  is  140  MW,  and  in  South  Kalimantan,  340  MW.  The \n\n \n\n\f8\n\n \n\ninterconnection with the 276 km transmission line will help realize economies of scale, provide \noperational flexibility, and maximize the use of resources.  \n \n30. \nThe  ICT  component  will  include  the  information  technology  (IT)  system  needed  to \noperate  the  competitive  electricity  market.  Once  the  Java-Bali electricity market is operational, \nthe  power  sector  will  be  deregulated  (retail  price  and  entry  will  be  depend  on  supply  and \ndemand),  thus  allowing  access  to  the  private  sector  without  government  guarantees.  The \nmarket rules have been developed and a suitable financial settlement system is being prepared \nunder  the  ADB-funded  TA  loan  (footnote  5).  An  international  consultant  is  also  being  selected \nunder  another  component  of  the  TA  Loan  to  prepare  the  specifications  for  the  computer \nsoftware and hardware of the IT system, which will be used to procure the goods and services \nunder the Project\u2019s ICT component.  \n \nB. \n\nSubprojects \n\nCore  subprojects  have  been \n\n31. \nidentified  using  agreed-on  selection  criteria.  The \nsubprojects  will  be  implemented  immediately  after  ADB  approves  the  Project  and  the  loan \nbecomes effective.11 The core subprojects are the (i) Java-Bali power grid category: extension \nof 150 kV substations in Cianjur and Kebonagung, and installation of four capacitors having an \naggregate capacity of 120 MVAr; and (ii) power grid interconnection category: Barikin-Tanjung \n150 kV transmission line.  \n \n32. \nPLN will select the noncore subprojects that also satisfy the agreed-on selection criteria. \nIt has identified several noncore subprojects and the list with the salient features is in Appendix \n5, Table A5.2. In case the priority changes during project implementation, PLN may substitute or \nadd other subprojects that also meet the selection criteria. PLN will seek ADB\u2019s approval to use \nloan  proceeds  to  implement  the  noncore  subprojects  by  submitting  documents  satisfactory  to \nADB:12  the  executive  summary  of  feasibility  report,  including  cost  estimate,  contract  package \nlist,  implementation  schedule;  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  summary  IEE \n(SIEE);13 social assessment and poverty analysis; LARP; and a brief note establishing that the \nselected noncore subproject satisfy the relevant selection criteria.14  \n \n33. \n \n\nThe following selection criteria will apply to subprojects in the Java-Bali power grid: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nBased  on  power  demand  forecasts,  the  noncore  subproject  will  prevent loading \nof  an  existing  power  transformer  at  a  substation  to  more  than  80%  of  its  rated \ncapacity during the following 2 years, or avoid a reduction of substation voltage \nby 10% based on power system load flow analysis. \nThe subproject will be near a major load center in Java-Bali. \nThe subproject will be part of the least-cost development plan. \nImplementation will be completed within the project implementation period. \n\n                                                 \n11  PLN may initiate procurement of the ICT-based goods and services also after the loan approval; however, it will still \n\nneed ADB's approval for the bidding documents. \n\n12  The documentation prepared for the core subproject before loan approval will serve as a sample for the non-core \n\nsubprojects. \n\n13 IEE/SIEE will be required for the new 150 kV transmission lines and associated substations.  \n14  Incase PLN requires to substitute or add noncore subprojects (not included in Appendix 5, Table A5.2), economic \n\nand financial analysis will also be provided to ADB. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n(v) \n\nSubmission of a complete environmental screening checklist when an IEE need \nnot be submitted.15  \n\nThe following are selection criteria for power grid interconnection subprojects: \n\nTwo  power  grids  should  interconnect,  one  of  which  should  have  reasonable \nspare generation capacity to share with the other. \nThe  subproject  will  be  part  of  the  least-cost  development  plan  for  a  particular \npower grid and will be financially and economically viable. \nThe implementation will be completed within the project implementation period. \n\n \n34. \n \n\n \nC. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nTariff and Subsidy \n\nThe Government approved a package of measures to restructure PLN\u2019s balance sheet16 \n35. \nbut the electricity tariff is still below the cost of service. In consultation with DPR, the tariff has \nbeen  increased  by  6%  at  the  start  of  every  quarter  in  2002.17  The  Government  agreed  to \nincrease  the  annual  average  tariff  in  2003  and  2004  to  reach  an  economical  level  of  tariff  in \n2005  so  that  PLN  will  recover  all  costs  and  generate  sufficient  cash  for  new  investments.  To \nprevent erosion of PLN's revenue in real terms and to make the tariff more transparent, formula-\nbased  automatic  tariff  adjustments  will  be  made  every  quarter  starting  1  January  2006  taking \ninto account changes in input costs from inflation, changes in fuel prices, and exchange rate.   \n \nThe  average  tariff  for  small  consumers  is  Rp261/kWh,  or  about  40%  lower  than  the \n36. \noverall  average  tariff.  PLN  plans  to  maintain  the  lifeline  tariff  targeted  to  the  small  household \nconsumers (450 volt-ampere  [VA]),  or  households  in  the  lowest  20-percentile income bracket. \nThe  tariff  for  these  households  is  expected  to  remain  30%  lower  than  the  average  electricity \ntariff for the household consumer category. \n \n\n2. \n\nPower Sector Restructuring \n\nThe  Government  will  expedite  execution  of  the  measures  envisaged  under  the  new \n37. \nelectricity law and also revise the 1998 Power Sector Restructuring Policy to bring it in line with \nthe  electricity  law,  particularly  its  implementation  schedule  and  new  organization  structure  for \nthe  power  sector  in  Java-Bali.  Under  the  new  electricity  law,  the  regulatory  body  has  to  be \nestablished  by  September  2003,  and  competition  in  generation  should  commence  by \nSeptember  2007.  The  Government  has  assured  ADB  that  the  regulatory  body  will  be \nestablished  and  procurement  of  ICT-based  equipment  for  the  competitive  market carried out \naccordingly.18 The Government has also assured ADB that the market rules and the supporting \nfinancial system will be approved by the regulatory body by June 2004.   \n\n                                                 \n15  The  format  of  the  environmental  screening  check-list  was  provided  to  PLN.  It  includes  the  aspects  that  are \n\nconsidered when ADB does environmental classification of hydropower project proposals.  \n\n16  The restructuring related to PLN's failure to service  the  high-cost  Government  loans;  the  unpaid  principal  amount \n(Rp5.3  trillion)  was  converted  into  a  new  20-year  loan  (including  a  2-year  grace  period)  with  4%  annual \nadministrative  charge;  and  the  unpaid  interest  (Rp15.7  trillion)  and  penalty  (Rp13.0  trillion)  were  converted  to \nequity. \n\n17  The  average  revenue  from  electricity  sales  will  increase  to  Rp497/kWh  ($0.051/kWh)  by  December  2002.  The \nlarge low-voltage consumers in all categories will be paying $0.08\u20130.09/kWh. Consumers also pay a streetlight tax \nequal to 3\u201310% of the energy bill, which is transferred to the regency. \n\n18  The  procurement  has  to  be  timed  so  that  the  ICT-based system becomes operational at the same time as the \n\ncommencement of the power generation market, and vendor support is available during the initial period. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3. \n\nChanging Strategic Business Units to Power Companies  \n\n38. \nThe  new  electricity  law  requires  establishing  electricity  generation  ventures  that  do  not \nenjoy market dominance. The Government will thus unbundle PLN's assets in Java-Bali, which \nwill  involve  separating  the  SBUs  into  separate  legal  entities.  The  transmission  SBU  will  be \nseparated and will initially be responsible for transmission, system, and market operations. The \nGovernment  has  assured  ADB  that  these  separate  companies  (including  the  Java-Bali \ntransmission company) will be established by December 2005. \n \n\n4. \n\nCorporate  Governance  \n\nPLN  is  conscious  of  the  acute  need  for  strong  corporate  governance,  given  the \n39. \nGovernment\u2019s  increased  emphasis  on  it  in  the  aftermath  of  the  economic  crisis,19  and  as  a \ncorollary to the reorganization of PLN under the new electricity law.  \n \nThe  April  2001  statement  of  PLN\u2019s  president  commissioner  in  the  2000  annual  report, \n40. \nwhich notes that PLN must \u201cpractice good corporate governance,\u201d has been followed up in 2002 \nin  two  substantive  forms.    First,  as  between  PLN  and  one  of  its  wholly  owned  subsidiaries \nresponsible for more than 50% of power generation in Java-Bali, a pilot project has been started \nwith  the  assistance  of  international  experts.  The  pilot  project  seeks  to  establish  an  internal \ncorporate  governance  framework  designed  for  operational  and  investment  decisions  within  a \ndecentralized structure. The framework will be applied to the operations of the holding company \nand SBUs in the reorganized PLN. \n \n41. \nSecond, in April 2002, PLN began drafting an internal good corporate governance code \nthat  sets  qualitative  standards  for  business  management,  including  tackling  corruption.  The \ngood  corporate  governance  code  will  be  tailored  to  PLN\u2019s  needs  and  allow  refinement  by  the \nGovernment based on international consulting input.20 Deliberations have been held by the PLN \nboard  of  directors,  and  a  task  force  has  been  established  to  draft  the  good  corporate \ngovernance code by October 2002.  \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n42. \nThe  total  project  cost,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies  and  interest  during \nconstruction,  is  estimated  at  $175.0  million,  comprising  foreign  costs  of  $125.9  million  (72%) \nand $49.1 million equivalent of local costs (28%). The project cost includes the estimated costs \nof  core  subprojects  and  noncore  subprojects  and  the  ICT-based  equipment  (Table  1,  2002 \nprices).  \n \n\n                                                 \n19  See the Government\u2019s establishment of the National Committee of Corporate Governance.  \n20  The  Government  has  access  to  such  international  consulting  services  input  under  Loan  1866-INO:  State-Owned \n\nEnterprise Governance and Privatization Program for $400 million, approved on 4 December 2001.  \n\n10\n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nTable 1: Estimated Project Cost \n($ million) \n \n\nTotal Cost \n\n59.6 \n29.4 \n\n75.9 \n40.1 \n\nForeign Cost \n\nLocal Cost \n16.3 \n10.7 \n\nItem \nJava-Bali Power Grid \nInterconnection  of  Power \nGrids \n25.0 \nICT \n1.5 \nConsulting Services \n142.5 \nSubtotal \nTaxa \n14.3 \n1.4 \nFront-End Fee \nPrice Contingencyb \n3.6 \nIDCc \n13.2 \n175.0 \nTotal \nICT = information and communication technology, IDC = interest during construction  \nNote: \na  Value added tax computed as 10% of foreign and local costs.  \nb  Price contingency computed on the basis of 2.5% on base cost. \nc \n\n21.0 \n1.3 \n111.3 \n0.0 \n1.4 \n2.8 \n10.4 \n125.9 \n\n4.0 \n0.2 \n31.2 \n14.3 \n0.0 \n0.8 \n2.8 \n49.1 \n\nIncludes commitment charge. \n\nSource: PLN estimates. \n\n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nindependent  decision  and  not  made  under \n\n43. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $140  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate  \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  a  front-end fee of \n1.00% (the fee will be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe  draft  Loan  and  Project  Implementation  Agreements.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB \nwith (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the \nbasis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  the \nGovernment's  own \ninfluence  of  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The Borrower will be the Government. The proceeds of the \nADB loan will be relent to PLN in dollar and other terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. PLN \nwill bear interest rate variation and foreign exchange risks on the loan.  \n \n44. \nProceeds of the proposed ADB loan will be utilized for (i) foreign currency cost and 45% \nof  local  currency  cost  (other  than  land  and  buildings)  for  power  grid  subprojects,  (ii)  foreign \ncurrency  cost  and  45%  of  local  currency  cost  for  ICT-based  goods  and  services,  (iii)  foreign \ncurrency  cost  and  50%  of  local  currency  cost  for  consulting  services  provided  by  the  ICT \nconsultant; (iv) up-front fee, and (v) interest during construction and commitment charge for the \nADB  loan.  For  contracts  for  civil  works,  disbursement  will  be  limited  to  90%  of  the  contract \nvalue.  The  Government  and  PLN  will  provide  counterpart  funds  to  meet  55%  of  the  local \ncurrency cost of the power grid subprojects, and ICT, which will include cost of land acquisition, \nbuildings,  and  taxes  for  all  subprojects;  and  50%  of  the  local  currency  cost  of  the  ICT \nconsultant. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n \n \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nForeign \n \n125.9 \n0.0 \n125.9 \n\nLocal \n \n14.1 \n35.0 \n49.1 \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment and PLN \nTotal \nPLN = State Electricity Enterprise \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nTotal \n \n140.0 \n35.0 \n175.0 \n\nTotal Cost \n(%) \n80 \n20 \n100 \n\n45. \n  The  Government  has  sought  assistance  to  meet  part  of  the  local  Project  cost.  The \nGovernment  needs  to  support  the  power  sector  during  2003-2004,  i.e.,  till  the  tariff  remains \nbelow  the  economic  level;  whereas  a  deferment  of  the  Project  could  cause  power  supply \ndislocation.  The high ADB cost-sharing ratio is justified given the current fiscal situation of the \nGovernment  and  the  pro-poor  nature  of  the  Project  (para  64).  Although  a  modest  economic \nrecovery has been experienced, the fiscal situation remains under severe stress. \n \n46.  When PLN is unbundled, the assets financed under the loan will need to be transferred \nto  successor  transmission  and  distribution  companies  in  Java-Bali.  To  facilitate  this  transfer, \nADB's  agreement  will  be  sought  and  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  put  in  place  to  ensure \nthat project implementation and operation  continue satisfactorily, including the servicing of debt \nand compliance to other loan conditions. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements   \n\n1. \n\nProject Management and Consultation \n\nDGEEU will be the Executing Agency as it is responsible for approval of electricity tariffs \n47. \nand implementation of power sector restructuring, which are two critical aspects of the Project. \nDGEEU also has administrative control over PLN, which will be the Implementing Agency. PLN \nhas  established  SBUs  at  the  regional  level  to  manage  day-to-day  project  implementation  and \nensure  achievement  of  project  performance  targets.  PLN  will  establish  the  necessary \ncoordinating functions at the head office to facilitate effective operation of SBUs.  \n \n48. \nThe  project  management  will  follow  the  decentralized  setup  of  PLN.  A  sector  project \ndirector  has  been  appointed  at  the  headquarters  to  coordinate  all  the  activities  related  the \nimplementation of the two sector projects.   The sector project director and staff will coordinate \n(i)  project  implementation  and  schedule,  (ii)  procurement,  (iii)  design  and  engineering,  (iv) \nenvironment,  (v)  land  acquisition,  and  (vi)  compensation.  A  subproject  manager  has  been \nappointed  at  each  SBU  and  subproject  teams  will  be  established  to  oversee  individual \nsubproject  implementation.  The  sector  project  implementation  consultant  (PIC),  engaged  by \nPLN  under  the  renewable  energy  development  sector  project,  will  help  implement  all  the \nsubprojects  under  the  two  sector  projects.  21  An  ICT  consultant  will  be  engaged  under  the \nProject to supervise the installation of the computer software and hardware equipment needed \nto operate the competitive electricity market. \n \n\n                                                 \n21  The  Project  and  the  renewable  energy  development  sector  project  will  be  implemented  concurrently.  The \neffectiveness  of  Project  implementation  supervision  will  be  better  with  one  consultant  being  responsible  for  all \nactivities related to power generation and transmission grid. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n2. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\n49. \nPower demand is projected to increase in the major load centers in Java-Bali, and early \ncompletion  of  the  subprojects  will  avoid  deterioration  of  the  quality  and  reliability  of  the  power \nsupply. The Project will be implemented from April 2003 to March 2008.22  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n All procurement to be financed under the Project will be carried out in accordance with \n50. \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement. The following are the  threshold limits of various types of \nprocurement:  (i)  international  competitive  bidding  for  (a)  supply  contracts  estimated  to  cost \n$500,000  or  more;  and  (b)  turnkey  contracts  packages,  $1  million  or  more;  (ii)  international \nshopping for supply contracts, $100,000\u2013500,000; (iii) local competitive bidding for all civil works \ncontracts,  construction  of  transmission  lines,  and  equipment  erection,  from  $100,000  to  $1 \nmillion; and (iv) direct purchase for all contracts, below $100,000. The local competitive bidding \nprocedures  to  be  followed  will  be  subject  to  ADB\u2019s  approval.  The  list  of  contract  packages  for \nthe core subprojects is in Appendix 5, Table A5.1. \n \n51. \nPLN  will  recruit  the  ICT  consultant  using  quality-  and  cost-based selection (QCBS)  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  It  is  estimated  that  48 \nperson-months  of  international  consulting  services  will  be  provided.  An  outline  of  the  TOR  for \nthe consulting services and cost estimate are in Appendix 6.   \n \nPLN  initiated  advance  procurement  action,  and  ADB  reviewed  and  commented  on \n52. \nthe  draft  bidding  documents  for  the  core  subprojects.23  PLN  has  been  informed  that \napproval  for  advance  procurement  action  does  not  commit  ADB  to  approve  the  proposed \nloan,  and  the  contracts  should  be  finalized  only  when  the  loan  is  approved  and  made \neffective.  \n \n\n4. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements   \n\n53. \nLoan funds will be disbursed in accordance with the procedures set out in ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook.  All  four  disbursement  procedures\u2014reimbursement,  replenishment, \ncommitment, and direct payment\u2014are envisaged to be used in this Project. An imprest account \n(the Government term is \"special account\") will be established in Bank Indonesia, with a ceiling \nof  $14.0  million.  The  total  of  any  advances  requested  should  never  exceed  the  estimated \nexpenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. Alternatively, \na more direct mechanism may be used for the fund flow, such as allowing PLN to manage the \nloan  expenditure  through  a  special  account  in  its  own  name.  Such  a  direct  mechanism  would \nrequire a consensus between the  Ministry of Finance and PLN before loan inception.  PLN will \nbe responsible for preparing all the withdrawal applications for authorization by the ministry. The \nstatement-of-account  procedure  can  be  used  for  individual  payments of less than $200,000 in \nseeking  replenishment  and  liquidation  from  the  special  account.  Supporting  documents,  as \ndefined  in  the  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook,  need  to  be  submitted  with  every  withdrawal \napplication for individual expenditure above $200,000. ADB reserves the right to conduct spot or \nrandom checks of expenditures covered by the statement of account, through disbursement or \n\n                                                 \n22 The implementation of subprojects (transmission lines and substations) will be completed by March 2005 and the \n\nimplementation of the ICT category for the electricity market will continue to December 2007. \n\n23  The Special Notice is scheduled for publication in the ADB Business Opportunities in November 2002. \n\n \n\n\f14\n\n \n\nreview  missions.  PLN  will  maintain  comprehensive  project-specific  accounting  records, \nsupporting all transactions, to facilitate any audit review. \n \n\n5. \n\nAccounts, Audit, and Report   \n\n54. \nPLN will submit audited annual financial statements for (i) PLN as an entity, and (ii) the \nProject. The entity and the Project statements will be audited by an independent auditor and in \naccordance  with  auditing  standards  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  financial  statements  (for \nthe entity and Project) will be submitted in English to ADB not later than 6 months after the end \nof  the  financial  year.  The  audit  opinion  will,  among  other  things,  confirm  (i)  the  accounting \nstandards  used  to  prepare  the  statements,  (ii)  that  PLN  has  utilized  all  proceeds  only  for  the \nProject as agreed on between ADB and PLN, (iii) that PLN was in compliance as of the date of \nthe  balance  sheet  with  all  financial  covenants  of  the  Loan  Agreement  between  ADB  and  the \nGovernment,  and  (iv) \ntransaction  documentation  has  been \nmaintained to support claims to ADB. \n \n\nthat  statement-of-account \n\n6. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n55. \nADB staff provided PLN with the draft Project Administration Memorandum, which will be \nused  to  provide  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB,  starting  from  the  first  quarter  after  loan \neffectiveness. These reports will indicate (i) the financial status of the subprojects; (ii) progress \nmade and problems encountered during the period under review; (iii) steps taken or proposed to \nremedy any problems; (iv) the status of implementation and compliance with loan covenants; (v) \nenvironmental, LARP, social assessment, and poverty analysis-related indicators for monitoring \nand evaluation; and (vi) a proposed program of activities, expected disbursement, and progress \nof  subproject  implementation  during  the  following  quarter.  After  project  completion,  PLN  will \nprepare  a  project  completion  report  (PCR)  in  the  form  agreed  on  with  ADB,  within  3  months \nafter loan closure. The PCR will review the planned objectives and achievements of the Project, \nincluding costs and benefits, and performance and contribution of all parties associated with its \nexecution. ADB will review implementation at least once a year. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses \n\n1. \n\nLeast-Cost Option  \n\n \n\n56. \nA  least  cost  analysis  was  carried  out  by  comparing  the  costs  related  to  the  envisaged \nsubprojects and alternate diesel-based power plants. The proposed strengthening of the Java-\nBali power grid and interconnection of power grids in Kalimantan are considered the least-cost \noption to develop efficient and reliable transmission in the subproject areas.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\n57. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  calculated  for  the  transmission \nsubprojects  and  the  ICT-based  equipment  for  the  competitive  electricity  market  (Appendix  7). \nThe EIRR was determined by valuing costs and benefits in economic terms. Domestic prices in \nconstant 2002 value were used in economic evaluation. Capital and O&M costs were adjusted \nto  remove  taxes,  duties,  and  other  transfer  payments.  Local  currency  expenditures  relating \nmostly to nontraded goods are equal  to  their  domestic  value,  and  a  shadow  exchange  rate  of \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n1.05  was  applied  to  calculate  the  economic  prices  of  traded  goods  from  their  financial  prices \n(based on a standard conversion factor of 0.95). Incremental energy available for sale is valued \nin terms of consumer willingness to pay. \n \nThe EIRR for the subprojects in the Java-Bali power grids and the competitive electricity \n58. \nmarket  was  estimated  at  33.2%,  and  for  the  interconnection  of  power  grids  at  22.5%.  The \ninvestments are thus economically viable and the resulting benefits sufficiently high to justify the \ncosts incurred by the subprojects, including capital costs. The EIRR calculation was subject to \nsensitivity analysis to test the effect of possible unfavorable changes in key variables. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nThe  financial  analysis  of  the  core  subprojects  of  the  Project  was  carried  out  based  on \n59. \nreal terms using constant 2002 prices. The financial evaluation assumes that tariffs will be set to \nachieve the full cost recovery and adequate rate of return. The annual energy flows through the \ntransmission system subprojects have been forecast based on the results of network analysis. \nThe  costs  include  capital  investment,  fuel,  O&M,  and  those  for  the  associated  distribution \nsystem.  Revenues  in  the  financial  analysis  were  valued  at  the  average  tariff,  which  was \ncalculated  based  on  the  weighted  average  of  tariffs  for  all  the  customer  groups  (social, \nresidential, commercial, industrial, public service, and street-lighting). An average tariff of $0.06 \nper  kWh  (Rp585  per  kWh)  was  used  during  the  period  of  analysis.  Assuming  the  above,  the \nfinancial internal rate of return  (FIRR)  for  the  core  subprojects  was  estimated  as  8.4-11.9%, \nwhi9ch exceeds the weighted average cost of capital of 4.2%. The robustness of the investment \nwas evaluated by carrying out a sensitivity analysis for changes in major assumptions. Details \nabout the weighted average cost of capital, FIRR, and sensitivity analysis are in Appendix 8.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Beneficiaries \n\nThe  Project  is  justified.  The  subprojects  in  the  Java-Bali  power  grid  will  help  remove \n60. \ntransmission bottlenecks and ensure efficient and reliable power supply. Electricity is in demand \nnot  only  among  rich  and  middle-income  consumers  but  also  among  the  poor  who  require \nelectricity  to  meet  their  basic  needs.  Electricity  is  vital  to  create  jobs,  support  most  economic \nactivities, and thus reduce poverty. The Project will help remove supply bottlenecks in Java-Bali \nand  integrate  medium-sized  power  grids  in  the  outer  islands  to  help  achieve  economies  of \nscale.  The  Project  will  also  develop  electricity  market  facilities  to  establish  and  operate  the \npower generation market in Java-Bali. The Project will help boost economic productivity in the \nsubproject  areas  by  enhancing  energy  efficiency  and  reliability  of  power  supply.  Existing \nindustrial  and  commercial  consumers  (including  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises)  will  be \nable  to  continue  their  operations,  and  some  new  units  will  be  connected  because  of  the \nincreased substation capacity. The labor force, which includes the poor working in the informal \nsectors, will be assured of continued employment. \n \n61. \nICT-based  systems  for  the  competitive  electricity  market  in  Java-Bali  are  essential  for \nthe  ongoing  power  sector  restructuring  program.  Competition  in  power  generation  will \nencourage  efficiency  among  electricity  producers  and  other  power  companies,  lower  the  bulk \nelectricity price and bring it closer to the marginal cost, and thus force down the average retail \nelectricity  price  and  directly  benefit  all  households  connected  to  the  power  grid,  including  the \npoor.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16\n\n \n\nB. \n\nSocial and Poverty Impact \n\n62. \nThe poverty impact ratio (PIR)\u2014the proportion of net economic benefits accruing to the \npoor\u2014was  estimated  for  the  Project  at  15.1%  by  comparing  the  net  economic  benefits  to  the \npoor with the net economic benefits to the economy as a whole. The net project benefit directly \naccruing  to  the  poor  was  estimated  at  Rp1  trillion  during  the  Project,  including  the  economic \nbenefits  from  the  market-based  power  supply  for  the  whole  Java-Bali  power  grid.  The  15% \nshare  of  consumer  surplus  for  the  poor  reflects  the  proportion  of  poor  households  with  PLN \nsupply, but no secondary data exists on indirect benefits to the poor from the net benefits going \nto the commercial and industrial sectors. The analysis concludes that a substantial portion of the \nproject  benefits  will  go  directly  to  the  poor  and  the  Project  will  achieve  its  primary  objective  of \npro-poor  economic  growth.  The  summary  poverty  and  social  strategy  and  analysis  of  the  PIR \nare in Appendix 9. \n \n63. \nThe  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement  signed  in  April  2001  states  that  in  the \nmedium-term,  poverty  reduction  development  priorities  will  focus  on  growth,  human  resource \ndevelopment, and good governance.  \n \n64. \nPoverty  is  significant  in  most  core  subproject  areas  (Table  3).    With  the  exception  of \nSumedang  and  Malang  City,  all  the  other  areas  are  as  poor  or  a  little  better-off than average \nbased on the 2000 National Socioeconomic Survey.  Levels of access to PLN electricity are also \nhigh  in  several  areas,  particularly  around  Bandung,  Sumedang,  and  Malang,  where  access  is \nnow virtually universal even among the poor.  However, Cianjur, Lebak, and Pandeglang have \nrural hinterlands that are more isolated and where population coverage is lower, but which are \nhome  to  many  poor  households.  Improving  capacity  to  transmit  and  distribute  power  more \neffectively in these areas may open up opportunities to extend service to more households.  \n \n\nSubproject Area \n\nPeople Below the \nPoverty Line  \n(no.) \n \n391,000 \n \n561,000 \n102,000 \n \n172,000 \n238,000 \n820,000 \n84,000 \n\nTable 3: Households below the Poverty Line and with Electricity from PLN \n \nHouseholds below \nthe Poverty Line \n(%) \n \n20 \n \n24 \n14 \n \n17 \n23 \n20 \n9 \n\n1.

Dependable  and  quality  electricity \nsupply  will  thus  benefit  poor  households  and  may  encourage  greater  (and  possibly  more \nproductive) use due to reduced risk of damage to appliances and equipment. \n\nHouseholds with \nPLN Electricity \n(%) \n \n77 \n \n98 \n99 \n \n71 \n63 \n96 \n97 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n \n66. \nAlthough formal poverty targeting has not been used, the Project is designed to prevent \npower transmission bottlenecks that could harm the reliability, quality, and quantity of electricity \nsupplied  to  major  load  centers  and  lead  to  brownouts,  interrupt  production  and  commercial \nactivities,  and  reduce  informal  jobs,  particularly  for  the  poor.  Electricity  is  also  consumed  by \nhouseholds,  many  of  which  are  semi-urban  poor  in  the  subproject  areas.  The  brunt  of  supply \nshortages is often borne by such consumers, who tap alternate sources of lighting at a higher \ncost. \n \n67. \nCreation of market facilities for a competitive electricity market in Java-Bali is an integral \npart  of  the  ongoing  power  sector  restructuring  program  and  will  lower  electricity  prices.  An \nefficient  power sector will free resources for other sectors of the economy and allow PLN to use \npublic  funds  to  expand  the  power  supply  in  outer  islands.  More  economic  agents  and \nentrepreneurial  opportunities  will  provide  new  prospects  in  the  power  sector,  while  PLN  will \naddress  the  issues  that  may  arise  when  it  is  restructured.  It  has  prepared  a  social  protection \nplan  based  on  consultation  with  its  employees.  While  PLN  is  unbundled  to  create  functional \ncompanies,  the  social  protection  plan  document  will  evolve  further  with  inputs  from  further \nconsultation, negotiation, legislation, and lessons from other privatization experiences.  \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\n68. \nNo significant technical risks are associated with the proposed investment. The Project \nis  considered  financially  and  economically  sound  and  capable  of  withstanding  reasonable \nchanges  in  major  parameters.  Institutional  risks  are  not  considered  significant  as  PLN has a \ncomprehensive  organizational  structure  in  the  outer  islands.  However,  the  success  of  the \nProject  depends  on  (i)  the  Government's  approval  for  revaluing  PLN\u2019s  assets,  and  a  gradual \nincrease of electricity tariff from 2003; (ii) decentralization of  PLN and empowerment of SBUs; \nand (iii) timely preparation of required documents for subproject approval, efficient procurement, \nand  project  implementation.  The  Government  has  assured  ADB  that  PLN's  assets  will  be \nrevalued  and  the  tariff  increased  on  time.  PLN  has  approved  the  establishment  of  support \nfunctions  for  SBUs.  The  last  condition  for  success  will  be  minimized  through  close  monitoring \nand  ADB  review  missions.  The  Project  is  in  the  infrastructure  sector  with  revenue  in  the \ndomestic currency, exposing the investment to the foreign exchange rate. The ongoing reforms \naim at macroeconomic stabilization. Over the long run, the restructuring of the power sector will \nallow  managing  the  price  risk  through  the  competitive  electricity  market.  Until  this  is  possible, \nthe Government will gradually raise the electricity tariff to an appropriate level and reintroduce \nan automatic tariff adjustment mechanism to maintain financial viability. \n \n69. \nThe timely and successful implementation of the competitive electricity market is subject \nto  the  ongoing  power  sector  reorganization,  under  which  generation,  distribution,  supply,  and \ntransmission will be separated into independent businesses. The Government must maintain its \ncommitment  to  the  restructuring  and  implementation schedule. Although competitive electricity \nmarkets  operate  successfully  in  several  countries,  international  experience  underscores  the \nrisks  related  to  market  dominance  and  limitation  on  bilateral  contracts.  The  design  of  the \ncompetitive  electricity  market  in  Indonesia  takes  into  account  these  factors  and  the  specific \nfeatures  of  the  Java-Bali  power  system.  The  new  electricity  law  requires  competition  in  power \ngeneration  to  start  in  5  years.  Provisions  have  also  been  made  for  retail  competition  but  a \ntimetable  has  not  been  specified  to  allow  for  a  gradual  evolution  of  the  competitive  market \nwithout  raising  concerns  among  the  stakeholders,  particularly  civil  society.  The  Government \nalso  confirmed  that  the  regulatory  body  will  be  established  within  1  year  in  line  with  the \nelectricity  law  to  ensure  timely  operation  of  the  competitive  market  and  an  independent  tariff \n\n \n\n\f18\n\n \n\nregime.  ADB  is  helping  the  Government  through  international  expertise  to  develop  the  market \nrules,  financial  settlement  system,  and  computer  software  specifications  needed  by  a \ncompetitive electricity market (para. 30).  \n \nD. \n\nEnvironment \n\n70. \nThe Project has been classified as category B as the subprojects are small scale, not in \nenvironmentally sensitive areas, and will have limited environmental impacts during construction \nand operation. An IEE was prepared for each core subproject. A sample SIEE is in Appendix 10 \nto  show  the  nature  of  the  Project  and  its  likely  potential  impacts.  The  sample  SIEE  includes \nmitigation  measures  that  need  to  be  adopted  by  the  subproject.  The  IEEs  indicate  that  short-\nterm  interference  in  daily  life  may  be  expected  during  construction  due  to  dust,  road  damage, \nand  noise,  while  no  significantly  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  expected  due  to  project \nimplementation.  \n \n71. \nProject social and environmental impacts are limited to the construction period and can \nbe  mitigated  to  an  acceptable  level  by  implementing  recommended  measures  and  using  the \nbest  engineering  and  environmental  practices  as  stated  in  the  IEE  and  SIEE  of  the  core \nsubproject.  The  Project  has  adequate  provisions  for  environmental  mitigation  and  monitoring \nand their associated costs.  \n \n72. \nADB format for each new 150 kV transmission line and associated substation. \n \nE. \n\nFor  noncore  subprojects,  PLN  will  submit  to  ADB  for  no-objection  an  IEE  and  SIEE  in \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n73. \nAn  initial  social  assessment  and  a  social  analysis  have  been  prepared  for  all \nsubprojects.  No  subproject  is  expected  to  affect  indigenous  communities  or  to  have  specific \nimpacts  on  women  or  other  vulnerable  groups.  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR) \nimpacts vary by subproject type. Subprojects entailing substation or transmission line upgrading \nwill not involve LAR. Subprojects entailing transmission line construction involve only medium-\nimpact  LAR  of  as  land  acquisition  is  limited  to  tower-base  areas,  and  the  houses  in  the \ntransmission lines\u2019 right of way will not have to be cleared. Only subprojects involving substation \nconstruction may have severe impacts. \n \n74. \nThe  compensation  and  rehabilitation  of  families  affected  by  LAR  are  regulated  by  the \ncompensation policy framework and procedural guidelines prepared by PLN for all subprojects. \nSubproject  preparation  and  implementation  will  be  regulated  by  LARPs  that  meet  the \nrequirements of the ADB policy on involuntary resettlement. The LARP for the Barikin-Tanjung \ntransmission  line,  the  only  core  subproject  involving  LAR,  has  been  prepared.  The  LARPs  for \nnoncore  subprojects  involving  LAR  will  be  prepared  during  project  implementation.  For  all \nsubprojects, a LARP will be a condition for award of civil works contract. A summary of LAR is in \nAppendix 11. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nimprovement  program \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  PLN  have  given  the \n\n75. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.   \n  \n76. \nPLN Financial Management. The Government\u2019s relending to PLN of loan proceeds on \nterms  and  conditions  acceptable  to  ADB  is  a  condition  of  loan  effectiveness.  In  addition, the \nGovernment  and  PLN  will  ensure  PLN\u2019s  continuing  compliance  with  financial  management \ntargets  and \nassurances  on  operational  budgets  and  efficiency \ncompliance  with  assurances  on  tariff  levels  for  PLN,  based  on  factors  including  asset \nrevaluation and self-financing ratio. \n \nSector  Project  Criteria.  The  Government  and  PLN  will  ensure  compliance  with \n77. \nsubproject selection criteria for noncore subprojects, including ADB\u2019s approval of commencing \nimplementation  based  on  submission  of  documents  including  (a)  executive  summary  of \nfeasibility  report,  including  cost  estimate,  contract  package  list,  implementation  schedule;  (b) \nsocial  assessment;  (c)  poverty  analysis;  (d)  IEE  and  SIEE  for  selected  subprojects;  and  (e) \nLARP, where applicable, satisfactory to ADB. \n \n78. \nFinancing  Plan.    The  Government  and  PLN  will  ensure  counterpart  funds,  based  on \nannual  budget  appropriation  requested  for  land  acquisition,  building,  taxes,  and  55%  of  local \ncurrency costs for the Java-Bali power grids, interconnection of power grids, and ICT; and 50% \nof the local cost of the consulting services. \n \nProject Implementation. The Government will ensure (i) appropriate security measures \n79. \nwill be put in place at project sites for the PLN staff, contractors, consultants, and ADB staff to \nperform  the  assigned  tasks;  (ii)  PLN  will  streamline  the  procurement  procedures  to  include \nexperts from headquarters, and SBU staff; (iii) timely and full implementation of LARPs; and (iv) \nall necessary action to make available land, rights of way, and other rights in land required for \nthe Project, to prevent project implementation delays. \n \n80. \nthings, independent audits of PLN and project annual financial statements. \n \n81. \nEnvironmental  Safeguards.  The  Government  and  PLN  will  ensure,  amongst  other \nthings,  implementing  measures  identified  in  the  IEE  and  SIEE  for  the  core  subproject,  and \nsimilarly  for  the  noncore  subprojects,  all  in  accordance  with  the  environmental  monitoring \nprogram  and  ADB's  environmental  procedures  requirements  and  guidelines  as  amended  from \ntime to time. \n \nSocial  Safeguards.  The  Government  and  PLN  will  ensure  (i)  preparation  of  plans  to \n82. \naddress  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  in  accordance  with  CPFPG;  (ii)  LARPs  will  be \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB's  policies  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous \npeoples;  and  (iii)  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  relevant  subproject  LARP  will  be  a \ncondition for the award of civil works contracts for that subproject. \n \n83. \nSocial Protection Plan.  Within  12  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  and \nPLN will ensure updating and finalization of a draft social protection plan satisfactory to  ADB to \nreflect the planned corporate reorganization of PLN taking account of the recommendations of \nthe World Bank-funded consultant. \n \n\nPLN  Financial  Governance .  The  Government  and  PLN  will  ensure,  amongst  other \n\n \n\n\f \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n84. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  $140,000,000  to  the  Republic  of \nIndonesia for the Power Transmission Improvement Sector Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility, an amortization period of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, and such other \nterms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nand Project Implementation Agreements presented to the Board. \n\nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n \n\n25 November 2002 \n \n\n20\n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nSECTOR PROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n\nDesign Summary \n\nPerformance Targets \n\nMonitoring Mechanism \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nGoals \n \n?

In 2001, the State Electricity Enterprise  (PLN) served 30 million consumers all over \nthe  archipelago,  and  electricity  sales  totaled  85.5  terawatt-hour  (TWh).    About  56%  of  the \nelectricity was consumed for industry and commerce. PLN operates over 1,100 power grids, the \nlargest being the Java-Bali power grid with a power generation capacity of 18.4 gigawatt (GW). \nHowever, only about 53% of the population is connected to the power grids and so considerable \ngrowth is still needed.  \n \nPLN  has  prepared  a  long-term  power  development  plan  (2002\u20132010).  Based  on  least-\n2. \ncost principles, limited-, low-, medium-, and high-growth scenarios have been considered. The \nlimited-growth scenario is necessary to reflect immediate financial constraints, which may only \npermit completion of the committed projects.   \n \nB. \n\nExisting Power Generation Capacity \n\n3. \nPLN  owns  and  operates  about  4,055  generating  units  with  a  total  capac ity  of  21,000 \nmegawatt (MW). About 74% of the capacity is in Java-Bali, and the rest is scattered throughout \nthe outer islands (Table A2.1).  \n \n\nTable A2.1: Installed Capacity of PLN Power Plants \n(MW) \n \n\nType of Power Plant  Outer Islands \n\nJava-Bali \n\nHydropower \nCombine Cycle \n  Gas Fired \n  Oil Fired \nSteam \n  Gas Fired \n  Oil Fired \n  Coal \nGeothermal \nGas Turbine \nDiesel \n   \nSource: PLN \n\nTotal \n\n \nC. \n\nPrimary Energy Use  \n\n714 \n \n876 \n0 \n \n \n310 \n590 \n20 \n646 \n2,441 \n5,511 \n \n\n2,391 \n \n 3,268 \n2,717 \n \n1,000 \n    800 \n4,200 \n360 \n558 \n109 \n15,492 \n \n\nTotal \n\n3,105 \n \n4,146 \n2,717 \n \n1,000 \n1,110 \n4,790 \n380 \n1,204 \n2,550 \n21,003 \n \n\nTotal  power  generation  in  2001  was  101.6  TWh,  which  included  the  power  purchased \n4. \nfrom  independent  power  producers  (13.3  TWh)  and  from  leased  generating  plants  (0.7 TWh). \nVarious  primary  energy  sources  were  utilized:  coal  (33.5%),  natural  gas  (29%),  fuel  oil  (22%), \nhydropower (12%), and geothermal sources (3.4%). \n  \n\n \n\n\f24\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nD. \n\nOperating Performance \n\n5. \nAverage  transmission  and  distribution  loss  during  1997-2001  was  12.3%,  which  is \nconsiderably lower than in other developing economies.24 The average frequency and duration \nof interruptions reflect the reliability and quality of service provided by a utility to its consumers. \nAlthough performance is  generally  satisfactory,  the  5  year  data  suggests  the  need  of  regular \nmaintenance and upgrading of the distribution networks (Table A2.2). \n \n\nTable A2.2: Losses and Interruptions \n(%) \n\nItem \n\nLosses  \n\nSAIDI \n\nSAIFI \n\n1997 \n\n12.10 \n\n15.15 \n\n12.81 \n\n1998 \n\n12.34 \n\n15.58 \n\n18.68 \n\n1999 \n\n12.22 \n\n14.00 \n\n18.49 \n\n2000 \n\n11.50 \n\n13.90 \n\n18.10 \n\n2001 \n\n13.48 \n\n13.24 \n\n15.12 \n\nSAIDI  =  system  average  interruption  duration  index  (hours  per  customer),  SAIFI  =  system \naverage interruption frequency index (times per customer) \nSource: PLN \n\nForecast of Power Demand  \n\n6. \nPower  demand  cannot  be  forecast  with  complete  certainty.  A  number  of  models  are \navailable to utilities. PLN uses one based on gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate; level of \nelectrification  ratio;  and  efforts  to  replace  captive  power  supply,  which  is  conservatively \nestimated at 10,000 MW. PLN\u2019s forecast considers a GDP growth rate of 3.5\u20136.0% as given by \nthe  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS).  The  high-growth  scenario  would \nrequire prohibitively high capital investment in the power sector and, therefore, only scenarios of \nlimited (financial constraint preventing new commitment), low, and medium growth are analyzed \n(Table A2.3).  \n \n\nTable A2.3: Projected Energy Demand \n(GWh) \n \n\nEnergy \nDemand \n\nJava-Bali \n\n \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLimited \n\n67,927   74,080   76,440   80,430   84,628   84,628  \n\n84,430   84,430  \n\n84,430  \n\n84,430  \n\nLow \n\n67,927   74,080   80,029   85,607   91,862   98,486  \n\n105,449   113,214   121,900   131,334  \n\nMedium \n\n67,927   74,080   82,092   89,272   97,469   106,223  \n\n115,550   125,463   135,973   147,088  \n\nOuter Islands \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLimited \n\n16,592   18,104   16,956   17,669   18,178   18,511  \n\n18,559   18,608  \n\n18,657  \n\n18,708  \n\nLow \n\n16,592   18,104   18,422   20,090   21,910   23,898  \n\n26,067   28,436  \n\n31,022  \n\n33,848  \n\n16,592   18,104   19,337   21,415   23,721   26,278  \n\nMedium \nSource: PLN \n                                                 \n24  These  losses  are  commonly  attributed  to  technical  and  nontechnical  reasons.  Two  major  reasons for technical \nlosses are that (i) small consumers constitute a relatively high portion of all consumers and are supplied through a \nlarge low-voltage distribution network (440 volts), which has high current flows and high heat losses; and (ii) a lack \nof  timely  expansion  and  improvement  of  the  distribution  networks  causes  overloads.  The  nontechnical  reason  is \nillegal electricity consumption, either as an unauthorized connection or tampering of energy meters. \n\n29,116   32,267  \n\n35,739  \n\n39,463  \n\n \n\n \nE. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25\n\nThe  availability  of  funds  will  determine  the  most  likely  scenario,  and  the  present  plans \n7. \nare based on the limited-growth scenario for the Java-Bali power grid. Its energy sales growth \nrate will be 4.2\u20134.6% in 2003\u20132005, less than the growth rate in 1995\u20132001 (8.8%). By 2005, \ncapacity  would  be  fully  utilized  and  the  system  may  not  be  able  to  support  further  demand \ngrowth.  \n \n8. \nUnder  a  conservative  plan  (low  economic  growth)  that  would  be  possible  with \nimprovement  in  financial  performance,  the  national  electricity  sales  growth  is  projected  to  be \nabout  6.9%  per  annum.  The  forecasts  take  into  account  the  impact  of  the  Government\u2019s \neconomic  reform  program  to  reduce  poverty  and  promote  regional  autonomy.  Reforms  will \nincrease  the  electrification  ratio  from  53%  to  75%  by  2010.  Electricity  sales  growth  rate  in  the \nouter islands (7.4%) will be a little higher than in Java-Bali (6.8%). \n \nF. \n\nGeneration Expansion Plan \n\n9. \nThe  installed  generating  capacity  in  Java-Bali  is  18,700  MW,  comprising  PLN-owned \nplants of 15,700 MW and independent power producer (IPP)-owned of 3,000 MW. Due to aging \nof PLN\u2019s power plants, about 1,000 MW are not available. A peak power demand of 13,041 MW \nwas recorded on 13 November 2001. The generation capacity expansion plan is formulated on \na  reserve  margin  criterion25  with  a  loss  of  load  probability  of  1  day  per  year.  Based  on  past \nexperience,  a  reserve  margin  of  25\u201330%  is  required,  and  in  the  low-growth scenario, 11,000 \nMW  of  additional  capacity  will  be  needed  in  Java-Bali  by  2010.  Considering  the  financial \nconstraints (limited-growth scenario), addition of only 3,700 MW is likely by 2006. \n \nIn  the  outer  islands,  about  746  MW  generation  capacity  is  under  construction,  which \n10. \nincludes  hydropower  plants  (546  MW)  and  coal-based  power  plants  (200  MW).  The  power \nsupply situation in most power grids is unsatisfactory, and the required additional capacity in the \nmedium-growth scenario will be from various power plants: gas turbine (1,400 MW); geothermal \n(50  MW);  coal  based  (270  MW);  hydropower  (20  MW);  diesel  based  (390  MW);  and  mini \nhydropower (20 MW). \n \n11. \nprojects.  \n \nG. \n\nAn estimated $5.5 billion will be needed in 2002-2005, excluding the investment in IPP \n\nFunds Needed for Transmission, Substations, and Distribution \n\nTo maintain the reliability and quality of power supply, the transmission and distribution \n12. \nnetworks should also be expanded to (i) prevent overloading of substations, (ii) provide flexibility \nin  operation  through  interconnecting  power  grids,  and  (iii)  evacuate  power  from  new  power \nplants.  \n \n13. \nPLN has prepared an investment plan for 2002-2005 based on (i) energy sales growth \nrate according to the low-growth case for outer islands; (ii) removal of bottlenecks in Java-Bali; \n(iii) operation of IPP power plants; and (iv) interconnections between Java and Sumatra, West \nKalimantan  and  Serawak,  and  Java  and  Bali.  The  plan  indicates  a  requirement  of  about  $5.5 \nbillion, which is the same as the requirement for additional power generation capacity. \n \n\n                                                 \n25  An adequate generation reserve should be provided to anticipate the possibility of forced or planned plant outages, \n\nand also to ensure reliable services. \n\n \n\n\f26\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nH. \n\nPlanning Constraints \n\n14. \nThe  higher  foreign  exchange  rate  since  1997  has  increased  PLN\u2019s  costs,  mainly  to \nservice  foreign  currency-denominated  loans,  and  purchase  natural  gas  and  power  from  IPPs. \nSince  a  corresponding  tariff  increase  would  have  transferred  the  burden  to  consumers  and \nslowed economic recovery, the tariff increase has been gradual. PLN could meet its cash flow \nrequirements for operations but was unable to service the foreign currency-based Government \nloans. Severe constraints were imposed on all new investments. While the demand forecast and \nexpansion-planning  exercise  indicate  a  large  fund  requirement,  the  financial  capacity  of  PLN \ndoes not permit it to raise its borrowings to $11 billion in 4 years.  As long as the electricity tariff \nremains below the economic level, the private sector will also face considerable risk in investing \nin power generation. PLN has taken the following measures to partly address its predicament.  \n \n15. \nEfficiency Improvement. To ensure that consumers do not resist tariff increases, PLN \nmust  achieve  high  industry  standards.  It  involves  all  employees  in  improving  operational \nefficiency and promoting prudent capital expenditure. Since the efficiency improvement program \nstarted in 1999, PLN estimates that it has saved about $60 million in operational expenditure. \n \n16. \nRehabilitation  of  Power  Plants.  PLN  has  focused  on  rehabilitating  inefficient  and \nderated power plants, which provided larger benefits and required less time to implement than \nadding new power generating capacity. The program includes the following:  \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nrehabilitation of seven small hydropower plants in Java (completed in 2000); \nefficiency improvement of Muara Karang steam gas-based units 4 and 5 (2 x 200 \nMW),  under  cooperation  with  the  New  Energy  and  Industrial  Technology \nDevelopment Organization of Japan; and \nefficiency improvement of Gresik steam oil-based units 1 and 2  (2 x 100 MW) by \nconversion  to  gas-based  units,  under  cooperation  with  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency. \n\n \n17. \nExcess  Power  from  Captive  Power  Plants.  PLN  is  investigating  the  possibility  of \ncooperating with owners of captive power plants to help meet power requirements during high-\ndemand  evenings.  Based  on  a  December  2001  survey,  about  200  MW  capacity  may  be \navailable from such power plants in Java in 2002.  \n \n18. \nDemand-Side Management.  PLN  will  launch  a  demand-side management program in \nclose cooperation with customers on voluntary basis. It will include electricity price adjustment \nduring  high-demand  periods,  energy  conservation,  and  voluntary  load  curtailment.  In  the  first \nstage, the proposed program has the potential to reduce the peak demand in Java-Bali by 140 \nMW in 2002. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n27 \n\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS  \n \n\nA. \n\nFinancial Performance of the State Electricity Enterprise  \n\nThe  financial  performance  of  the  State  Electricity  Enterprise  (PLN)  in  1995\u20132001  is \n\nTable A3.1: Past Financial Performance of the State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) \n\n1. \nsummarized in Table A3.1. \n \n\nAverage revenue increase \n\n% \n\n \nItem \n\nEnergy sales  \n\nSales increases  \n\nOperating revenue \nAverage revenues  \n\nOperating expenses  \n\nEBIT \n\nDebt service  \nNet income after tax \n\nInternal sources of funds  \nReturn on assets a \nReturn on equity \n\nOperating ratio \nDebt to debt + equity ratio \n\n \n\nUnit \n \n\nGWh \n\n% \n\nRp billion \nRp/kWh \n\nRp billion \n\nRp billion \n\nRp billion \nRp billion \n\nRp billion \n\n% \n\n% \n\n% \n% \n\n1995 \n\n1996 \n\n1997 \n\n1998 \n\n1999 \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n49,749 \n\n56,932\n\n64,312 \n\n65,144\n\n71,004 \n\n79,165\n\n85,528 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n8,306 \n163.0 \n\n6,537 \n\n1,769 \n\n576 \n1,020 \n\n3.328 \n\n3.7 \n\n \n\n78.7 \n27.7 \n\n5.8 \n\n14.4\n\n9,646\n165.4\n\n1.5\n\n7,713 \n\n1,933 \n\n1,897\n1,178 \n\n4.542\n\n4.7\n\n4.0\n\n80.0\n34.7\n\n2.4 \n\n13.0 \n\n11,126 \n169.1 \n\n1.3\n\n9.0 \n\n11.5\n\n8.0 \n\n14,036\n211.3\n\n15,997 \n220.7 \n\n22,557\n279.7\n\n28,625 \n330.6 \n\n2.2 \n\n24.9\n\n4.4 \n\n26.7\n\n18.2 \n\n9,450 \n\n16,809 \n\n21,503 \n\n27,216 \n\n31,939 \n\n1,676 \n\n(2,773)\n\n(5,506) \n\n(4,659)\n\n(3,315) \n\n3,435  1,602.0\n(9,546)\n(580) \n\n4,043.0  3,894.0\n(11,368)  (24,611)\n\n5.833 \n\n269\n\n1.426 \n\n(7.474)\n\n3.2 \n\n(1.9) \n\n84.9 \n45.3 \n\n1.7 \n\n(13.3)\n\n(40.8)\n\n119.8\n64.6\n\n0.2 \n\n(9.3) \n\n(0.9)\n\n(89.6) \n\n(132.1)\n\n134.4 \n78.5 \n\n0.4 \n\n120.7\n72.0\n\n(1.9)\n\n3,971 \n180 \n\n7,409 \n\n0.4 \n\n0.9 \n\n111.6 \n71.6 \n\n1.9 \n\n79.7 \n\nDebt service coverage ratio \n\ntimes  \n\n \n\n8.0 \n\n33.6\n\n40.8\n\n69.6\n\n12.7 \n\n33.1 \n\nSelf financing ratio (annual) \n% \na Defined as operating income less tax / average net fixed assets in operation. \nSource: State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) \n \nThe lower foreign exchange rate of the rupiah resulting from the 1997 crisis considerably \n2. \nincreased  PLN\u2019s  operating  and  debt  servicing  costs.  The  operating  ratio  (operating  expense \ndivided  by  operating  revenue)  became  more  than  100%,  and  the  debt  service  coverage  ratio \ndropped below 1.0, indicating that PLN could not service all its debt.26 However, the cash flow \nneeded for operations was possible, as PLN did not service the loans that had been relent by \nthe  Government.  The  default  attracted  a  penalty  of  Rp13  trillion  in  2000,  resulting  in  a \ncumulative  loss  that  not  only  wiped  out  the  retained  earnings  from  earlier  years  but  also \nthreatened to make the net value (equity and retained earnings) negative, making the company \ntechnically insolvent.  \n \n3. \nThe  impact  of  higher  foreign  exchange-linked  operating  and  debt  servicing  costs  was \nforeseen  during  the  preparation  of  the  1999  Loan  1673-INO:  Power  Sector  Restructuring \nProgram  (the  Program)  and  during  loan  appraisal.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nacknowledged  the  need  to  restructure  the  high-cost  debt.  At  the  time,  the  Government  faced \neven greater financial stress and could not immediately offer relief to a state-owned enterprise \non a selective basis. In June 2001, the Government as PLN\u2019s shareholder approved a financial \nrestructuring  package  that  implicitly  condoned  PLN\u2019s  failure  to  pay  interest  and  the  principal \n                                                 \n26  The self financing ratio is still indicated as positive because it is calculated from the cash flows, which do not record \n\nthe failure to service Government debt.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\namounts  during  1998-2000,  and  converted  these  accrued  payments  (and  the  penalty  for  the \ndefault) into new long-term debt and equity. This financial package helped improve the balance \nsheet for 31 December 2000 by including (i)  the conversion of Rp15.7 trillion of unpaid interest \nand Rp13.1 trillion of penalties into equity, and (ii) the conversion of unpaid principal amount of \nRp5.3 trillion into a 20-year term loan with an interest rate of 4%. \n \n4. \nHelped  by  the  withdrawal  of  the  default-related  penalty,  debt  restructuring  under  the \nsubsidiary loan agreements, a rising average electricity tariff, the renegotiated power purchase \ncosts,  and  the  government  subsidy  to  compensate  for  the  low  tariff  for  small consumers, PLN \nachieved a net income of Rp180 billion in 2001 compared to a net loss of Rp24.6 trillion in 2000. \nThe  government subsidy  of  Rp6.7 trillion and  the  decrease  in interest and financial charge by \nRp11  trillion  significantly  improved  PLN\u2019s   income  statement.  The  Government  has  already \nraised the tariff for 2002 by 6% per quarter and will raise it further in 2003-2005 so that it reflects \nthe  full  cost  of  supply,  including  a  reasonable  rate  of  return.  PLN  is  continuously  trying  to \nimprove  its  financial position  by,  among  other  things,  (i)  reducing  nontechnical  losses ; and  (ii) \nreducing costs by (a)  renegotiating power purchase costs,  (b) operating power plants using fuel \noil  rather  than  natural  gas,  and  (c)  reducing  fuel  costs  through  contract  amendment.  The \noperating ratio will be substantially improved in 2005, indicating that PLN\u2019s financial health will \nrecover  by  then.  Based  on  the  higher  projected  revenue,  PLN  has  the  capacity  to  borrow  for \nnew investments for next 4\u20135 years. \n \nB. \n\nProjected Financial Performance \n\nThe major assumptions for the financial projections are as follows: \nExchange rate: Rp9,000/$1 \n(i) \nInflation rate: 7.2% annually for local costs and 2.5% annually for foreign costs \n(ii) \n(iii) \nFuel prices: linked to international prices in 2004 onward \n(iv)  Maintenance costs: 1% of average net fixed assets in operation \n(v) \n\nPower purchase: reflecting new agreements with independent power producers \n(IPPs) \nEnergy sales growth (low-growth scenario): increase by 7.6% per annum in 2006 \nonward \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii)  Average tariff: increase of  6% every quarter in 2003 and of 5% every quarter in \n\n2004, no increases 2005 onward \n\n(viii)  Government subsidy: Rp3.2 trillion in 2003, and Rp3.3 trillion in 2004 \nAnnual investment (low-growth scenario): Rp161 trillion in 2003\u20132007 \n(ix) \nAssets revaluation: carried out on 1 January 2002 \n(x) \nCost of borrowing: 7% interest on ADB loans and 6.1% per annum on others \n(xi) \n\nThe actual and projected financial statements for 1999-2008 are summarized in Tables \n\n \n6. \nA3.2\u2013A3.4. \n \n7. \nPLN  has  requested  the  Government  to  revalue  its  assets  based  on  the  principles \nrecommended in the ADB-funded technical assistance.27 The net value of the operating assets \nwill increase to Rp173 trillion. Consequently, as of 31 December 2002, PLN\u2019s balance sheet will \nindicate a revaluation surplus of Rp74.1 trillion and government equity of Rp66 trillion, reducing \nthe debt-equity ratio from 61% to 27%. However, the asset revaluation will attract a tax payment \nof Rp8.7 trillion,  in equal installments for 5 years starting from 2002. Depreciation provision for \n\n                                                 \n27  TA  3027-INO:  Revaluation  of  the  Operating  Assets  of  Perusahaan  Listrik  Negara  (Persero),  for  $940,000, \n\napproved on 8 June 1998; and IN.33-01: TA Completion Report circulated on 9 February 2001.  \n\n5. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nfuture  years  will  need  to  be  about  Rp12.8 trillion higher.  Accounts  payable,  including  arrears \nfrom IPPs, will significantly decrease from Rp19.9 trillion to Rp5.6 trillion due to reduced power \npurchase  costs  as  a  result  of  renegotiations  with  IPPs.  To  continue  meeting  all  costs  and \nprovide  a  reasonable  level  of  cash  balance,  a  72%  increase  in  tariff  will  be  needed  in  2003. \nHowever, the Government plans to implement a more gradual increase of 20% per annum from \n2003 to 2005, which will allow a 68% rate of return starting in 2005.  \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Health of the State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) \n\n8. \nIn  many  ways,  PLN  is  a  well-run  utility:  its  operating  costs are low, transmission and \ndistribution  losses  are  reasonable,  and  revenue  collection  is  good.  The  inadequate  tariff  level, \nhowever, has adversely affected PLN's financial position. Sales revenue is expected to increase \nto  Rp100  trillion  in  2008.7  due to  higher  energy  sales  and  tariff.  The  operating  expenses\u2014\nmainly  fuel  and  power  purchase  costs\u2014will  not  increase  by  as  much,  and  PLN  will  have  a \npositive  operating  income  in  2004,  which  will  increase  gradually  from  2005  onward. Foreign \nborrowings  of  about  Rp74.6  trillion  will  be  needed  in  2003-2007  for  the  investment  program \nunder the low-case scenario, considering the cash shortfall remaining after equity contribution, \noperating income, depreciation, and subsidy payment. The tariff increase during 2003-2005 will \nallow  PLN  to  service  existing  and  future  debt  during  the  next  3\u20134  years.  The  debt  service \ncoverage ratio will increase to 3.4 in 2005, and the self-financing ratio will be 0.7% in 2003, and \n53.9% in 2004. Asset revaluation will significantly improve the ratio of debt to debt plus equity \nfrom  72%  in  2001,  to  27%  in  2002,  which  will  make  room  for  larger  borrowings.  The  average \ncollection date is projected to remain within the normal range of 27-32 days.  \n \nPLN has obtained the Government's approval in principle to seek $804 million in official \n9. \nforeign  loans  during  2002\u20132004  from  ADB,  World  Bank,  Islamic  Development  Bank,  the \ngovernments of Belgium and Denmark,  and Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW); and through \nexport credit. \n \nD. \n\nLoan Covenants \n\nBased  on  the  projected  financial  performance,  the  following  financial  covenants  will  be \n\n10. \nproposed in the loan agreement: \n \n11. \nRevaluation of Assets. The Government will cause PLN to revaluate its assets from 1 \nJanuary 2002, in accordance with the  principles included in the ADB-funded study (footnote 2), \nand approve tax payment in five equal annual installments. \n \n12. \nImplementation  of  Electricity  Tariff  Increases.  The Government  will  cause  PLN  to \nimplement (i) gradual tariff increases in 2003-2004 to reach and economic  tariff  level in 2005; \n(ii) a tariff increase from 1 January 2005, to allow PLN  to maintain a self-financing ratio of not \nless  than  30%  from  2005  onward;  and  (iii)  a  formula-based  automatic  tariff  adjustment \nmechanism  from  1  January  2006,  to  protect  the  level  of  PLN\u2019s  tariffs  in  real  terms  by \ncompensating for changes in (a) the prices and quantities of fuel, (b) foreign exchange rate, and \n(c) domestic prices (inflation). \n \n13. \nOperating  Ratio.  The Government  will  ensure that PLN will maintain  every  fiscal year \nafter  31  December  2004,  a  ratio  of  total  operating  expenses  to  total  operating  revenue  not \nhigher than 85%. \n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nDebt  Service  Coverage  Ratio.  The Government  will  ensure  that  PLN  will  maintain  a \n14. \nratio of gross internal sources of funds for each fiscal year of  not less than 1.5 times the debt \nservice requirements after 31 December 2002. \n \n15. \naverage collection period of not more than 40 days after 31 December 2002. \n \n \n\nAverage  Collection  Period.

Power system expansion has been planned considering (i) \nfuture development of power demand and load, (ii)  the gap between the available dependable \ncapacity and other required capacity, and (iii) closing this gap at the least cost. \n\n \n2. \nThe equalizing discount rate analysis was carried out for power grid interconnection on \nthe outer islands by comparing the selected core subproject with alternate modes of generation. \nSince the power sector in the project areas mostly consumes diesel, diesel power is considered \na  viable  alternate  source.  The  least-cost  analysis  was  conducted  using  2002 domestic market \nprices.  Capital  costs  and  operating  costs,  including  fuel  costs,  were  taken  into  account,  and \ntaxes excluded. The present values of the cost streams of the two options are calculated along \nwith equalizing discount rates for the core subproject as in Table A7.1. The Java-Bali power grid \nsubprojects  are  in  line  with  the  least-cost  power  development  program  of  State  Electricity \nEnterprise (PLN). \n\nTable A7.1: Least Cost Analysis for Core Subproject \n\nNet Present Value  \n(Rp million) \n\nRenewable \nResources-Based \n51,958 \n\nAlternate \nDiesel-Based \n53,928 \n\nEqualizing \nDiscount \nRate \n(%) \n16 \n\n \n\n \n\nCore Subproject \n\n \n\nBarikin-Tanjung  Transmission  Line \n150 kV \nkV = kilovolt \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nB. \n\nGeneral \n\nThe  economic  analysis  was  based  on  a  comparison  of  the  with-  and  without-project \n3. \nscenarios. Without the Project, power transmission systems will continue to deteriorate. With the \nProject,  power  transmission  bottlenecks  will  be  removed  in  Java,  and  power  transmission \nsystems on the outer islands will be interconnected to maintain the quality of power supply and \nimprove  efficiency.  A  wholesale  electricity  market  will  be  established,  and  competitive \ngeneration  tariff  introduced  that  is  economic  and  significantly  determined  by  the  interaction  of \nmarket supply and demand. \n \nThe  economic  analysis  was  conducted  using  domestic  market  prices.  The  economic \n4. \nprice  of  nontraded  goods  is  equal  to  their  domestic  prices,  and  a  shadow  exchange  rate  of \n1.053 (based on the standard conversion factor of 0.95) was applied to calculate the economic \nprice of traded goods. Due to local labor market conditions, an unskilled labor conversion factor \nof  0.75  in  domestic  prices  was  considered.  Based  on  these  assumptions, the main costs and \nbenefits have been broken down into traded goods, nontraded goods, and skilled and unskilled \nlabor; and conversion factors were calculated to value all costs and benefits in economic terms. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nC. \n\nCosts \n\n \n\nAppendix  7 \n\n41 \n\n5. \nThe  main  project  costs  cover  civil  works,  equipment,  incremental  operation  and \nmaintenance,  land  acquisition,  and  resettlement  with  and  without  the  Project.  The  economic \ncosts  were  estimated  from  financial  costs,  including  physical  contingencies.  Price  escalation, \ninterest  during  construction,  and  taxes  are  excluded.  Local  currency  expenditures  relating \nmostly to nontraded goods are equal to their domestic value, and the shadow exchange rate of \n1.05 was applied to calculate the economic prices of traded goods from their financial prices. \n \nD. \n\nBenefits \n\n6. \nEnhanced Java-Bali power transmission systems and a wholesale electricity market will \nintroduce competition in power supply to bring electricity prices closer to marginal costs,  force \ndown  overall  average  electricity  prices,  and  thereby  increase  consumption.  These  benefits \naccrue  to  incremental  energy  consumption  and  are  valued  at  consumer  willingness  to  pay.  In \nthe long term, the electricity retail prices are expected to go down  about $0.02 per kilowatt-hour \n(kWh)  equivalent  under  the  Project.  The  literature  indicates  price  elasticity  of  about  \u20130.3  to \nmeasure  the  economic  benefits  from  incremental  electricity  consumption,  which  suggests  that \nwith  the  price  decrease  by  about  $0.02/kWh  equivalent,  market  demand  for  incremental \nelectricity consumption may go up to about 20%.  \n \n7. \nInterconnection  of  power  transmission  systems  on  the  outer  islands  will  help  boost \neconomic  productivity  of  the  project  areas.  The  Project  viability  is  based  on  the  economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR).  Average  consumer  willingness-to-pay  in  East  and  South \nKalimantan was estimated as Rp1,251 (about $0.14/kWh equivalent) based on the willingness-\nto-pay  for  residential,  commercial, and industrial sectors, as well as their respective shares in \nconsumption of power. The economic benefits were valued by applying the average consumer \nwillingness-to-pay  to  net  energy  sold  to  consumers  due  to  the  enhanced  efficiency  of  power \ntransmission systems in the project areas. \n \n8. \nThe  Project  holds  other  benefits  that  are  not  easily  quantified.  Power  transmission \nsystem  improvement  in  Java-Bali  and  power  grid  interconnection  on  the  outer  islands  will \nenhance  transmission  facilities,  meet  future  demand,  and  promote  balanced  regional \ndevelopment. A wholesale electricity market and competition in the generation sector through a \nsystem  of  marginal  cost  pricing  will  fend  off  inefficiency  in  production  (generation)  and \nconsumption (distribution and large industrial customers). With the wholesale electricity supply \nmarket in place, the power facilities will have to compete on the basis of least cost. Generation \nfacilities  will  be  forced  to  keep  down  their  operating  costs,  otherwise  they  run  the  risk  of  not \nbeing  dispatched  and  being  priced  out  of  the  system  by  more  efficiently  run  facilities.  Power \nfacilities will thus be pressured to minimize their operating costs and, at the same time, become \nmore efficient to improve their heat rates. \n\n \nResults of Economic Analysis \n\nE. \n\nThe  Project  benefits  will  accrue  to  all  energy  consumers  in  the  power  transmission \n9. \nsystems, including the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. The Project will enhance \npower supply quality and ensure sufficient, reliable, and stable supply of power to consumers, \nincluding the poor. A wholesale electricity market and competition in generation are envisioned \nto  bring  electricity  prices  closer  to  marginal  cost  and  force  down  overall  average  electricity \nprices.  In  the  long  run,  sizable  welfare  gains  will  accrue  to  households,  producers,  and  the \neconomy as a whole. \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n10. \nThe Project's EIRR was calculated for 25 years, including 5 years of construction (2003-\n2007) and 20 years of operation (2008-2027) (Table A7.2). The results of the economic analysis \nshow  that  all  the  four  core  subprojects  are  economically  viable  and  the  subproject  benefits \nsufficient to justify subproject costs, including capital costs. The EIRR calculation was subjected \nto sensitivity analysis to test the effect of possible unfavorable changes on key variables. \n \n\nVariables \n\nTable A7.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return and Result of Sensitivity Analysis \n(%) \n \nJava-Bali Power \nTransmission and ICT for \nMarket \n33.2 \n \n31.4 \n31.2 \n30.3 \n29.4 \n27.1 \n\nBase case \nSensitivity Tests \ni.

The  creation  of  market \nfacilities  for  the  bulk  electricity  market  in  Java-Bali is analyzed  on the assumption that  it  will \ncommence operation in 2008.  \n \nB. \n\nCapital Costs and Financial Benefits \n\n2. \nThe  main  project  costs  include  capital  investment,  and  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M). The capital costs for  the  Java-Bali and interconnection power grid subprojects include \ntransmission  lines,  transformers,  capacitors,  switch  gears,  and  telecommunication equipment. \nThe  cost  for  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  buildings,  and  access  roads  are  also  included. \nMarket facility costs are computer hardware and software. The annual capital expenditures are \nbased on the investment program of the State Electricity Enterprise (PLN). All capital costs are \nexpressed in real terms using constant 2002 prices. The  financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nwas calculated on the basis of  the base costs , excluding price contingency and interest during \nconstruction. No residual value of the project was considered. \n \nThe  financial  benefits  for  the  Java-Bali  power  subprojects  were  measured  by  the \n3. \nincremental energy sales and reduction of transmission loss as result of  removing bottlenecks; \nand for the Kalimantan interconnection subproject,  by the average energy transferred from the \nEast to the South Kalimantan system. The forecasted power demand and subproject\u2019s utilization \nfactor  were  also  taken  into  account.  The  financial  benefits  for  the  market  facilities  were \nmeasured  by  the  net  cash  flow,  which  was  the  net  revenue  generated  from  the  system, and \nmarket operation, and deducting the capital and operation costs for establishment and operation \nof the market facilities.   The revenue was computed from the system and market operation fee \nper  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  multiplied  by  the  volume  of  energy  traded  through  the  market.  All \nbenefits are expressed in real terms using constant 2002 prices. \n \nC. \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital and Assumptions \n\nThe FIRR  was compared with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC) of 4.23%, \n\n4. \nwhich was determined based on the following assumptions: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Loan:  $140  million  (80%  of  total  funding), \ninterest rate of 5.6% per annum; \nlocal loan: $17.5 million (10% of total funding), interest rate of 20% per annum; \ngovernment  funds:  $17.5  million  (10%  of  total  funding),  nominal  cost of  10.6% \nper annum; \ntax rate: 30%; \ninflation rate: 7.2% per annum for local cost; \nreal cost: ADB Loan\u20143.92%, local loan\u20146.34%, government funds\u20143.17%; and \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii)  minimum rate test: 4.% \n \n5. \nThe  FIRR  analysis  covers  25  years  of  project  life,  including  5  years  for  project \nimplementation.  The  annual  load  demand  in  the  core  subproject  areas  has  been  forecasted \nbased  on  the  low-case  scenario.  The  average  tariff  level  will  allow  full  cost  recovery  and \nappropriate level of rate of return. The financial benefits consider a constant tariff of $0.06 per \nkilowatt-hour  (kW)  (Rp585/kW),  which  is the  weighted  average  of  tariffs  for  all  the  consumer \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\ncategories. O&M costs are assumed at 2% of capital expenditures.  The power factor and load \nfactor  are  assumed  as  0.85  and  70%,  respectively.  For  the  market  facilities,  the  system  and \nmarket  operation  charges  are  assumed  as  $0.000153/kWh,  and  the  share  of  energy  traded \nthrough the market was estimated at 10% of total energy sales in  the Java-Bali system in 2008, \nto increase by 10% every year until it reaches 60%. O&M costs are assumed at  3.7% of capital \nexpenditures. \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis \n\n6. \nThe FIRR was calculated for the Java-Bali and interconnection power grid subprojects. \nTo  assess  the  results  obtained  in  the  base-case  scenario  and  to  identify  possible  risks,  a \nsensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  on  changes  in  major  key variables.  The  base-case FIRRs \nand results of the sensitivity analysis are in Table A8. \n \n\nTable A8: Financial Internal Rate of Return for Base Case  \nand Result of Sensitivity Analysis  \n(%) \n\n \n\nVariables \n\nMarket Facilities \n\nJava-Bali Power \nGrid \n8.39 \n7.13 \n7.00 \n6.30 \n5.79 \n5.12 \n\nPower Grid \nInterconnection \n8.64 \n7.46 \n7.35 \n7.31 \n6.22 \n6.17 \n\nBase case \nCapital Expenditure (+10%) \nBenefits (-10%) \nPower output (-10%) \nWorst case I b \nWorst case II c \nNote: \na\n  \nb\n   A combination of capital expenditure increase and benefits decrease. \n   A combination of capital expenditure increase and power output decrease in case of Java-Bali and the power grid \ninterconnection  subprojects,  and  a  combination  of  shared  volume  decrease  and  power  output  decrease  in  the \ncase of market facilities.  \n\nIn case of market facilities, the share of energy sales on competitive basis is considered 10% lower. \n\n11.9 \n10.8 \n10.7a \n10.7 \n9.6 \n9.5 \n\nc\n\n \n7. \nThe  result  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  all  categories  achieve  FIRRs of more \nthan  4.23%  of  WACC,  including  the  two  worst-case scenarios.

The Project \nwill contribute to these areas of intervention and is designed to prevent bottlenecks in power transmission that could \nadversely affect the reliability, quality, and quantity of electricity supplied to major load centers. Such constraints in \nelectricity  delivery  lead  to  brownouts,  interrupt  production  and  commercial  activities,  and  reduce  informal  jobs, \nparticularly  for  the  poor.  Electricity  is  also  consumed  by  households,  including  many  semi-urban poor in subproject \nareas.  Such  consumers  often  bear  the  brunt of supply shortages and need to make alternate arrangements for at \nleast  the  essential  services  (lighting)  at  a  higher  cost.  The  ongoing  restructuring  and  introduction  of  a  competitive \nelectricity market will also benefit all consumers by bringing the cost of electricity close to its marginal cost.  \n \nB. \n\nProposed Classification: Others \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nAnalysis: \n \nA  15.1%  poverty  impact  ratio  (PIR)  expressing  the  proportion  of  net  economic  benefits  accruing  to  the  poor  was \nestimated for the Project by comparing the net economic benefits to the poor with the net economic benefits to the \neconomy  as  a  whole.  During  the  operation  of  the  Project,  the  net  project  benefit  directly  accruing  to  the  poor  is \nestimated at Rp1 trillion including the economic benefits from the market-based power supply for the whole Java-Bali \npower grid. The 15% consumer surplus for the poor reflects the proportion of poor households with State Electricity \nEnterprise (PLN) supply, but no secondary data exists on the indirect benefits to the poor from the consumer surplus \ngoing  to  the  commercial  and  industrial  sectors.  The  analysis  concludes  that  a  substantial  portion  of  the  project \nbenefits will go directly to the poor and the Project will achieve its primary objective of pro-poor economic growth. \n \n \nC. \nParticipation Process \nStakeholder analysis prepared  \n \nParticipation strategy: \nThe selection is based on feedback regarding the quality of power supply, obtained from consumers in subproject \nareas.

The \ndomestic  price  numeraire  and  the  discount  rate  of  12%  were  used.  Table  A9  shows  the \nthe \ndistribution  of  project  effects  (economic  minus \nstakeholders.  The  resource  savings  will  initially  accrue  to  PLN  and  the  Government,  then \ntransferred  to  outer  island  consumers  through  budget  allocations  for  rural  electrification  and \ntargeted subsidy for small consumers. The Project will benefit consumers (through a consumer \nsurplus  of  Rp6.6  trillion)  and  labor  (through  jobs).  The  Government,  however,  will  suffer  an \neconomic loss due to inefficient resource use associated with domestic market price distortion \nrelative to world prices. The benefit is high because it includes the economic benefits from the \nmarket-based power supply for the whole Java-Bali power grid. \n \n2. \nThe  net  economic  benefits  (Rp6.3  trillion)  accruing  to  each  stakeholder  were  allocated \nbetween the poor and nonpoor. The marginal government expenditure required for project cost \nfinancing accruing to the poor was estimated using the income share of the poor (around 14%) \nin gross domestic product (GDP); 15% of the consumer surplus is assumed to go to the poor, \nbased  on  the  estimate  of  poor  consumers  in  Project  area.  Based  on  the  projected  rural  labor \nemployed by the Project, 25% of the economic benefits accruing to unskilled labor are assumed \nto go to the poor. The net economic benefit to the poor is estimated at Rp950 billion during the \nProject operation, and the poverty impact ratio is estimated at 15.1%. \n \n\nTable A9: Poverty Impact Ratio of Core Subprojects \n(Rp million) \n \n\n \n \n\nFinancial  Economic  Difference \nPresent  Present \nValues \nValues \n\n82,448  6,702,349  6,619,901    \n    \n \n \n(4,488)   \n(98,358) \n(93,871) \n(12,627) \n(293,900)   \n(306,526) \n(24,049)  6,297,465  6,321,514    \n\n  \n  \n Item \nBenefits  \nCosts \n  Capital Costs  \n  O&M Costs \nNet Present Value \nGains and Losses  \nProportion of poor (%) \nBenefits to poor \nPoverty Impact Ratio (%)  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \n \n \n\nPLN \n \n\nDistribution of Project Effects \nConsumers  Government/  Labor \n\n \n\nEconomy \n\n \n\n \nTotal \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n6,619,901 \n15 \n992,985 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n(4,724) \n(309,368) \n  \n(314,092) \n14 \n(43,973) \n\n \n \n\n  \n  \n  \n224 \n  \n15,481 \n  \n  \n15,705  6,297,465 \n \n3,926  949,572 \n \n\n25 \n\n \n\n(24,049) \n\n14 \n(3,367) \n15.1 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fREPORT OF SUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\nAppendix  10 \n\n47 \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe Power Transmission Improvement Sector Project (the Project) is an environment B \n1. \nproject.  It  includes  subprojects  that  will  add  360  megavolt  amperes  (MVA)  of  transformation \ncapacity to the Java-Bali power sector, and 276 kilometers (km) of 150 kilovolt (kV) transmission \nline to interconnect power grids in outer islands. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was \nprepared  for  the  core  subproject  in  accordance  with  the  Environmental  Assessment \nRequirements  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank.  This  sample  summary  IEE  (SIEE)  includes \nmajor  findings  and  conclusions  on  the  150  kv  Barikin-Tanjung  transmission  line  (58  km)  in \nKalimantan and was prepared for analytical purposes to show the nature of the Project, its likely \npotential impacts, and mitigation measures needed. \n \nB. \n\nDescription of the Core Subproject \n\nThe 58 km Barikin-Tanjung transmission line is in South Kalimantan Province, starting in \n2. \nBarikin  Substation  at  Tower  T-321  and  proceeding  northeast  to  T-530  at  Tanjung  Substation. \nMost of the land traversed by the line\u2019s right-of-way corridor is used for dry rice fields (40.14%), \nunderbrush (17.93%), orchards (7.77%), and other uses. In general, the dry rice fields are used \nto cultivate seasonal crops such as rice, corn, and several kind of fruits and vegetables, while \nthe orchards or market gardens are occupied by annual cropping plants such as rubber, palm \noil, coconut, durian, and others. \n \nThe Project is to proceed in three phases: preconstruction, construction, and operation. \n3. \nDuring  preconstruction,  the  main  activities  will  be  surveying,  site  investigation,  and  land \nacquisition  for  the  209  tower  sites  and  the  substations  in  Barikin  and  Tanjung.  During \nconstruction, the activities will be mobilization of work crews, construction of tower foundations, \ntower erection, and stringing. \n \nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nWith  the  exception  of  the  Meratus  Mountains  in  the  southeast  of  the  island,  and \n4. \nlimestone  outcrops  in  the  west  (the  highest,  Mount  Mulul,  is  2,377  meters  [m]),  much  of \nKalimantan\u2019s  land  area  is  barely  above  sea  level.  Kalimantan's  monsoon  climate  brings  dry \nwinds from the southeast from May to September; and moisture-laden winds from the northwest \nfrom October to March. Most rain falls from November to January, whereas July to September \nremain dry.  \n\n5. \nCompared to other regions, Kalimantan still has a low level of industrialization. Its basic \ninfrastructure\u2014community  services,  health  provision,  piped  water,  and  education\u2014is  limited. \nThe poverty level is also high, associated with low incomes, subsistence agriculture such as rice \nfarming, smallholding rubber and coconut cultivation, and artisanal fishing. \n \nThe economy of Kalimantan is based on exploitation of its rich natural resources. Apart \n6. \nfrom gold and diamond mining, large-scale coal mining began in the late 19th century, followed \nby  a  series  of  oil  booms.  East  Kalimantan  has  produced  oil  since  the  beginning  of  the  20th \ncentury,  and  liquefied  natural  gas  is  an  important  export.  Kalimantan\u2019s  forests  also  provide \nvaluable timber; large-scale lumber operations, which began in 1967, continue today at alarming \nrates.  \n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n7. \nThe  Barikin-Tanjung  transmission  line  will  result  in  limited  negative  impacts  during \nconstruction  and  operation.  Approximately  38  hectares  (ha)  of  plantation  belonging  to  195 \nowners are to be cleared. Affected owners will be compensated for the vegetation cleared. The \ncleared land will be planted with low canopy plant. The total land requirement for the tower sites \nand  substations  was  estimated  to  be  790  ha.  A  compensation  procedure  will  be  followed  and \ndiscussed with landowners and affected persons. \n \n8. \nDuring  the  operational  stage,  electric  and  magnetic  fields  will  result  from  power \ntransmission.  Based  on  PLN  consultation  research,  the  average  electric  and  magnetic \ninductions that resulted from the Java 150 kV transmission line are 193.4 volt per meter (V/m) \nand  2.0  micro-Tesla,  respectively.    These  values  are  below  the  World  Health  Organization \n(WHO) threshold values: 5,000 V/m for the electrical field and 100 micro-Tesla for magnetic field \nas  recommended  in  WHO  Publication  No.  10  on  nonionizing  radiation  protection  for  safety \nthreshold value for humans. Further, the ministerial decree of the minister of mines and energy \nNo. 01.P/47MPE/1992 stipulates minimum clearance between a conductor and ground for 150 \nkV transmission lines to minimize the potential public health hazard of a transmission line. \n \nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\n9. \nThe environmental investigations made clear that only very minor environmental impacts \nare expected. The proposed institutional requirement and environmental monitoring activities for \nthe Project are compiled in Table A10. \n \n\nTable A10: Recommended Activities for Institutional Requirement \nand Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n\nActivities \n\n1 \n\nTraining sessions for key personnel of the \nPLN planning department to address \nbasics of environmental protection; \n- \n-  methodology and procedures of EIAs;  \nenvironment-friendly planning and \n- \nselection of sites and right of way for \nelectrification projects \n\nResponsibility for \nExecution \nEnvironmental expert or \nscientist on behalf of PLN \n\nAssistance or \nApproval by \nInternationally \nexperienced \nconsultant, \nlocal university \n \n\n2  Assistance in detailed project planning \n\n \nactivities, especially for site surveys and \npreparation of project civil works \n\nEnvironmental expert or \nexperienced engineer on \nbehalf of PLN \n\nLocal authorities \n\n3  Conflict management of land acquisition \n\nprocedures \n\n4  Establishment of an environmental \n\nmonitoring program  \n- \n- \n\nfor project construction phase, \nfor the first 2 years from start-up of \nproject operation \n\nSocial development \nexpert on behalf of PLN \nEnvironmental experts \n(e.g., biologist, chemist) \non behalf of PLN \n \n\nLocal authorities \n \nLocal authorities, \nlocal university \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nActivities \n\n5  Supervision of project construction phase to \nensure environment-friendly execution \n\nResponsibility for \nExecution \nEnvironmental expert or \nexperienced engineer on \nbehalf of PLN \n\nAppendix  10 \n\n49 \n\nAssistance or \nApproval by \nIndependent local \nenvironmental expert / \nengineer in \ncollaboration with local \nauthorities \n\nLocal authorities \n\n6  Bimonthly preparation of environmental \n\nstatus reports during project construction  \n\nEnvironmental expert or \nengineer on behalf of PLN \n\n7  Preparation of progress reports of \n\nenvironmental monitoring (two per year) for \nfirst 2 years of project operation \n8  Establishment of an environmental \n\nmanagement program for  \nsubproject selection,  \n- \nenvironmental review of subproject \n- \nimplementation \n\nEnvironmental expert or \nengineer on behalf of PLN   \n\nLocal authorities \n\nEnvironmental expert or \nengineer on behalf of PLN \n\nLocal authorities, \nlocal university \n\nEIA = environmental impact assessment, PLN = State Electricity Enterprise \n \nF.  \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n10. \nThe  IEE  findings  show  that  Barikin-Tanjung  transmission  line,  by  virtue  of  its  limited \nconstruction requirements, will have a neutral, or only very small, influence on the environment. \nStarting  with  these  environmental  impacts,  PLN  will  incorporate  mitigation  proposals  and \nrecommendations for implementation in the later project phases. \n \nG. \n\nConclusions \n\nThe  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  are  limited  and  can  be  mitigated  by \n11. \nimplementing the recommended measures and environmental monitoring program. Appropriate \nbudget  has  been  allocated  in  the  Project  cost  for  this  purpose.  An  environmental  impact \nassessment is not required. \n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \nA. \n\nBackground \n\nSUMMARY OF SOCIAL SAFEGUARD STRATEGY \n\nThe  Power  Transmission  Improvement  Sector  Project  includes  the  implementation  of \n1. \nvarious subprojects in Java-Bali and Kalimantan, involving the construction of new substations \nand transmission lines and upgrading the capacity of some existing ones. Two core subprojects, \nrepresentative of the intervention types and regions, have been prepared. One core subproject \nentails  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  and  compensation  for  right  of  way.  Additional \nsubprojects will  be  identified  after  Loan  approval  and  prepared  during  project  implementation. \nLand impacts are expected to be small or medium.  \n \nB. \n\nGeneral Policy and Procedures for Land Acquisition and Resettlement  \n\n2. \nLAR will be handled  in  accordance  to  national  law  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) involuntary resettlement policy as detailed in the  Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to \nGood  Practice.  LAR  preparation  requires  (i)  a  common  compensation  policy  framework  and \nprocedural  guidelines  (CPFPG)  for  all  subprojects;  and  (ii)  individual  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  plans  (LARPs)  for  subprojects.  The  preparation  of  a  CPFPG,  and  the  needed \nLARP  for  the  core  subproject  was  a  condition  for  project  appraisal.  LARPs  based  on  the \ndetailed  design  and  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  be  a  condition  for  financing  the  noncore \nsubprojects. \n \n3. \nTo meet these requirements State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) has prepared a CPFPG, \nand  one  LARP  for  the  core  subproject.  The  following  summarizes  the  CPFPG  and  core \nsubproject LARP.  \n \n \n4. \nThe  noncore  subprojects  will  be  prepared  after  loan  approval.  Adequate  social \ndevelopment  capacity,  inclusive  of  LARP  and  IPDP  preparation,  will  be  injected  into  the \npostappraisal phases, which will include providing sufficient social development expertise in the \nconsulting  services  for  the  sector  project  implementation  consultant,  funded  under  the \nrenewable energy development sector project. \n \nC. \n\nLand Acquisition And Resettlement  \n\n1. \n\nCompensation Policy Framework and Procedural Guidelines  \n\n5. \nThe  CPFPG  reflect  the  main  project  preparation  and  implementation  principles:  (i) \nnegative  impacts  will  be  minimized;  (ii)  compensation  will  be  sufficient  to  improve  or  at  least \nrestore the preproject income and living standards of affected persons; (iii) affected persons will \nbe fully informed and consulted on compensation options and resettlement planning; (iv) asset \ncompensation  will  be  provided  at  replacement  rates;  and  (v)  lost  asset  compensation, \nreplacement  dwellings,  and  rehabilitation  provisions  and  allowances  will  be  provided  in  full \nbefore  ground  leveling  and  demolition.  ADB  approval  of  a  noncore  subproject  involving  LARP \nwill be subject to ADB's approval of the LARP. \n \n6. \nand rehabilitation subsidies as follows: \n\n \nThe  CPFPG  also  stipulate  eligibility  and  entitlements  for  land,  houses,  income  losses, \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPermanent  agricultural  and  residential  land  losses  will  be  compensated in cash \nat market rates. \nTemporary land losses will be paid in cash at market rates. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n51 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nHouse  and  building  losses  will  be  compensated  in  cash  at  replacement  rates, \nfree of demolition expenses and salvaged materials. \nCrop losses will be paid to the affected persons in cash at market rates. \nRelocation  expenses  covering  transport  costs  will  be  paid  to  the  affected \npersons. \nBusiness loss allowance based on tax declarations will be paid to each affected \npersons for each month of interruption of business activities. \n\nAs for LAR processing procedures, the CPFPG establish the following:  \n(i) \n\nAfter  subproject  identification  and  completion  of  preliminary  design,  PLN  will \ncarry  out  an  ISA  to  determine  preliminary  impact  data  and  the  socioeconomic \nfeatures of the affected persons.  \nIf  through  this  process,  subproject  impacts  are  identified  as  \u201csignificant,\u201d29 a full \nLARP will be prepared.  \nIf,  however,  the  impacts  are  identified  as  less  than  \u201csignificant,\u201d  only  a  short \nLARP will be prepared.30  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n2. \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities \n\n8. \nThe  sector  project  director,  through  the  social  development  unit,  has  the  overall \nsupervision, review, and financial responsibility for LAR. The subproject teams will prepare and \nimplement specific LARPs and share responsibility with local administrations for LAR, including \nasset valuation; consultation; entitlement delivery; and issuance of land acquisition, demolition, \nand building permits. Field tasks such as paying compensation, selecting replacement land, and \nproviding livelihood support will rest with village and local PLN personnel. \n \n\n3. \n\nDisclosure and Public Consultation  \n\nLARP  preparation  will  entail  intense  consultation  with  affected  families  through \n9. \nquestionnaires  and  community  meetings  involving  the  families  and  local  subproject  team  and \ngovernments.  A  booklet  summarizing  the  CPFPG  will  be  sent  to  all  affected  families,  and \nBahasa  Indonesia  CPFPG  and  LARPs  will  be  made  available  in  each  affected  village.  The \nsame  documents  in  English  will  be  posted  on  ADB's  web  site  and  made  available  at  the \nIndonesia Resident Mission in Jakarta.  \n \n\n4. \n\nGrievance Procedures \n\n10. \nGrievances  will  first  be  lodged  with  the  villages.  If  no  settlement  is  reached  within  2 \nweeks,  complaints  can  be  raised  to  the  land  acquisition  committee  for  the  relevant  district \n(established  by  presidential  order).  If  still  unresolved,  outstanding  cases  can  be  sent  to  the \noffice of the head of local government. Final  appeal for unsolved cases will be available in the \nappropriate courts of law. \n\n5. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe  LARP  will  be  internally  and  externally  monitored.  PLN  has  established  a  monthly \n11. \nreporting system involving the social development staff with the sector project director and in the \nregional  subproject  teams.

PLN will report to ADB on the LARP in quarterly progress reports. External monitoring \nreports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  twice  a  year,  detailing  the  progress  in  implementing  each \nLARP  until  its  conclusion.  At  the  end  of  the  implementation  of  subproject,  the  independent \nmonitoring agency will prepare a report evaluating the results of the whole resettlement program \nand assessing affected families rehabilitation and satisfaction. \n \n\n6. \n\nFinances \n\nEach  LARP  will  establish  unit  compensation  rates  for  items  negatively  affected  by  the \n12. \nsubproject and will provide a detailed  budget for LAR compensation. The budget will include (i) \nland compensation, resettlement subsidies, and house improvement or replacement; (ii) income \nrestoration  assistance;  (iii)  relocation  allowances;  (iv)  management  costs;  (v)  monitoring  and \nevaluation; (vi) taxes; and (vii) contingency. Cost estimates will be adjusted annually based on \nthe  inflation  rate  of  the  preceding  year.  Total  cost  of  the  resettlement  program  for  the  core \nsubprojects has been estimated at Rp5.6 billion. Cost estimates for the noncore subprojects will \nbe included in the respective LARPs. \n \nD. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Plans for Core Subproject  \n\n13. \nThe core subproject is the 150 kV Barikin-Tanjung transmission line in Kalimantan and \nrequires a full LARP. The LARP prepared reflects the stipulation of the CPFPG outlined above \nand  provides  information  on  compensation  rates,  consultation  activities,  and  budgets.  This \nsubproject entails the construction of a new transmission line (58 km), expansion of the Barikin \nsubstation, and the construction of the Tanjung substation. A full LARP based on an advanced \nfeasibility  design  survey  has  been  prepared  and  indicates  that  the  subproject  will  acquire  6.1 \nhectare,  of  which  44%  is  farmland.  The  project  will  not  cause building losses or resettlement. \nImpacts  on  trees  are  being  assessed  and  will  be  documented  in  the  final  LARP  based  on \ndetailed  design.  Overall,  the  affected  families  will  be  129  (548  persons).  The  LARP  program \ncosts Rp5.6 billion. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 30 October 2002) \n \n", "Currency Unit \n \nRp1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n \n= \n= \n", "rupiah (Rp) \n \n$0.000109 \nRp9,214 \n", " \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "ADB \nBAPPENAS  -  Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional  \n", "-  Asian Development Bank \n", "(National Development Planning Agency)  \n", "land acquisition and resettlement  \nland acquisition and resettlement plan \n", "-  community development action plan \n-  compensation policy framework and procedural guidelines  \n-  Directorate General for Electricity and Energy Utilization \n-  developing member country \n-  Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat (House of Representatives, or the Parliament)  \n-  economic internal rate of return \n- \nfinancial internal rate of return \n- \ninformation and communication technology \n- \ninitial environmental examination \n- \nindependent power producer \n- \ninitial social assessment \n- \ninformation technology \n-  Japan Bank of International Cooperation \n-  Koperasi Unit Desa (village cooperative)  \n- \n- \n-  London interbank offered rate \n-  Ministry of Cooperatives \n-  Ministry of Finance \n-  nongovernment organization \n-  operation and maintenance \n-  overseas development assistance  \n-  project implementation consultant \n-  Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Enterprise) \n-  poverty impact ratio \n-  power purchase agreement \n-  power transmission improvement \n-  power welfare scheme \n-  quality- and cost-based selection  \n-  strategic business unit \n-  summary initial environmental examination \n- \n- \n-  weighted average cost of capital \n", "technical assistance \nterms of reference \n", "CDAP \nCPFPG \nDGEEU \nDMC \nDPR \nEIRR \nFIRR \nICT \nIEE \nIPP \nISA \nIT \nJBIC \nKUD \nLAR \nLARP \nLIBOR \nMOC \nMOF \nNGO \nO&M \nODA \nPIC \nPLN \nPIR \nPPA \nPTI \nPWS \nQCBS \nSBU \nSIEE \nTA \nTOR \nWACC \n", " \n", " \n", " \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n \n", "cct-km (circuit-kilometers)  \nGWh (gigawatt-hour) \nkm (kilometer) \nkV (kilovolt) \nkWh (kilowatt-hour) \nMVA (megavolt-ampere) \nMW (megawatt) \nTWh (terawatt-hour) \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "unit of transmission line length \nunit of energy, equal to 1 million kWh \nunit of distance \nunit of voltage, equal to 1,000 volts \nunit of energy, equal to 1,000 Wh \nunit of apparent power \nunit of power  \nunit of energy, equal to 1 billion kWh \n", " \n \nNOTE \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "This Report was prepared by a team consisting of A.
