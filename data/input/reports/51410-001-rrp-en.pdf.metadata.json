The focus will be the Zamyn-Uud soum (district), where the busiest international border \nport between Mongolia and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is located and the population \nrelies heavily on border traffic and trade activities.2 The project will support the development of \nan  economic  cooperation  zone  between  Mongolia  and  the  PRC.  It  will  realize  the  untapped \neconomic potential of Mongolia\u2019s existing Zamyn-Uud free zone and its strategic position along \ncorridor 4 under the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC)  program. CAREC \ncorridors link the region\u2019s key economic hubs and connect landlocked CAREC countries such as \nMongolia with markets in Asia, Europe, and rest of the world.3 The project will generate economic \nand employment activities in Zamyn-Uud through (i) construction and operation of infrastructure \nand facilities in the free zone, (ii) promotion of sustainable operations and management of the \nfree zone, and (iii) establishment of a port of entry system within the free zone.4 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nEndowed with considerable mineral resources, Mongolia\u2019s economy is highly dependent \non commodity exports. The mining sector contributes 24% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product \n(GDP), 70% of inward foreign direct investment, and 90% of its exports. Because of its narrow \neconomic  base,  Mongolia  suffers  from  boom-bust  economic  cycles  and  is  vulnerable  to \nfluctuations  in  global  commodity  prices  and  foreign  investment  inflows.  Economic  growth \naveraged 12.3% during the mining industry boom of 2011\u20132014 but plunged to 2.4% in 2015 and \n1.2% in 2016, before picking up in 2017\u20132019.5 The mining industry is capital intensive and only \ncontributes to 4% of employment. \n \nInternational trade plays a critical economic role in Mongolia where the exports-to-GDP \n4. \nratio  stands  at  62%.  Trade  is  conducted  primarily  via  road  and  railway  transport  with  its  two \nneighboring countries (the PRC and the Russian Federation). However, Mongolia\u2019s exports are \nconstrained by the border delays, poor infrastructure, and weak regulatory environment that drive \nup its trade costs. Mongolia ranked 130th out of 160 countries in logistics performance in 2018 \n\n \n\n1  The  project  originally  appeared  as  the  Developing  Cross-Border  Economic  Cooperation  Zone  Project  in  Asian \n\nDevelopment Bank (ADB). 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2019\u20132021. Manila. \n\n2  This document uses the most recent English-language spelling of the district name: Zamyn-Uud. The name is also \n\nsometimes spelled Zamiin-Uud. \n\n3  CAREC Corridor 4 connects Mongolia with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the Russian Federation. It \ncomprises three subcorridors: 4a in the western region of Mongolia, which serves road transit trade between the \nRussian  Federation  and  the  PRC  and  bilateral  trade between  the  PRC  and Mongolia; 4b,  which provides  both a \nhighway and a railway connection between the PRC and the Russian Federation through Ulaanbaatar; and 4c, which \nconnects the eastern region of Mongolia with the PRC by road. The Zamyn-Uud free zone is located in corridor 4b. \n4  A free zone is defined (under Mongolia\u2019s Law of Free Zones, as amended on 12 February 2015) as a part of the \nterritory of Mongolia that is deemed to fall outside the customs territory for the purposes of customs duties and other \ntaxes and adopts special treatment of business activity in such areas as customs and tax exemptions, ease of entry \nand exit customs control and clearance, and registration and employment within the zone.  \n\n5  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Industry  and  Trade,  and  Economic  Analysis  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fand 117th out of 190 on ease of trading across borders in 2019.6 Empirical evidence suggests \nthat a 10% reduction of import time at the border could expand trade and raise the share of trade \nin  Mongolia\u2019s  GDP  by  0.65  percentage  points.7  Trade  facilitation  is  thus  crucial  to  improving \nMongolia\u2019s export competitiveness, growing the economy, and increasing employment.  \n \n5. \nPandemic  impact.  The  unprecedented  disruptions  to  the  global  economy  due  to  the \ncoronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)\u2014particularly  the  economic  slowdown  in  the  PRC\u2014are \nsignificantly affecting Mongolia\u2019s exports and economy. Mongolia\u2019s GDP growth is expected to \nfall  sharply  from  5.1%  in  2019  to  2.1%  in  2020.8  The  COVID-19  outbreak  has  heightened \nMongolia\u2019s  need  to  facilitate  international  trade,  which  will  be  crucial  to  its  post-pandemic \neconomic recovery. An enabling environment is required for the private sector to maximize the \nimpact of the government\u2019s emergency stimulus package and adapt to the rapidly evolving global \neconomic and trade landscape. The development of an economic cooperation zone with project \nsupport  is  important  to  this  effort.  By  providing  the  necessary  infrastructure,  facilities,  and \nsustainable operations and management capacity in the zone, the project is expected to enable \nthe private sector to build and improve production capacity and expand trade activities. In addition, \nthe  travel  restrictions,  border  closures,  and  stricter  border  controls  imposed  worldwide  to  slow \nCOVID-19\u2019s  spread  highlight  the  importance  of  strengthening  the  country\u2019s  resilience  to \ntransboundary health risks. Greater use of technology and stronger systems will equip Mongolia\u2019s \nborder agencies to better manage these risks, especially future pandemics, by enabling them to \nshare information with one another and with their counterparts in neighboring countries. The port-\nof-entry system to be established under the project will support this interagency and cross-border \ninteroperability  and  data  sharing,  particularly  on  customs,  immigration,  and  inspection \ninformation. Improved traceability and coordinated risk management will result, making the cross-\nborder movement of goods and people safer and more efficient.      \n \n6. \nCross-border trade. As a member of CAREC since 2003, Mongolia is positioning itself \nas a transit and trade node between Northeast Asia and Europe. The government recognizes that \ntransforming Mongolia\u2019s inherent constraint as a landlocked country into an opportunity requires \nconcerted  efforts  to  facilitate  trade,  improve  physical  connectivity,  and  enhance  regional \ncooperation and integration (RCI).9 Mongolia will benefit from its connectivity and trade facilitation \nprojects along CAREC corridor 4, which traverses Mongolia\u2019s key border crossing points.10  \n \n7. \nFree  zone  development.  Free  zone  development  is  one  of  Mongolia\u2019s  economic \ndiversification initiatives and will also strengthen Mongolia\u2019s participation in global and regional \nvalue chains.11 Industries established in the zones are expected to generate a variety of exports, \nranging from agricultural and manufacturing products to trade-related services.

The  Office  of  the \nDeputy  Prime  Minister  (ODPM)  has  oversight  over  the  free  zones,  but  each  zone  also  has  a \ngovernor\u2019s office that is responsible for managing its operations (footnote 4). \n \nThe Zamyn-Uud free zone. The Zamyn-Uud free zone is 780 kilometers southeast of \n8. \nUlaanbaatar  and  adjacent  to  the  border  crossing  point  at  Zamyn-Uud.  This  is  the  largest  and \nbusiest  border  crossing  point  on  CAREC  corridor  4  and  where  road,  rail,  and  air  transport \nnetworks meet. It is also the border crossing closest to Tianjin, the gateway port in the PRC for \nMongolia\u2019s shipments to Japan and the Republic of Korea. Under the framework of their 2011 \ncomprehensive strategic partnership, Mongolia and the PRC signed an agreement in June 2019 \nto establish the economic cooperation zone to connect Mongolia\u2019s Zamyn-Uud free zone with the \nPRC\u2019s Erenhot zone located in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.12 As Mongolia\u2019s largest \ntrading partner, the PRC was the recipient of 93% of Mongolia\u2019s exports and the source of 34% \nof Mongolia\u2019s imports in 2018. A substantial portion of this trade goes through the Zamyn-Uud \nborder crossing point.13 Developing the economic cooperation zone will reduce Mongolia\u2019s trade \ncosts and support its economic diversification. It will also benefit the district\u2019s population of 18,930, \nof which about 6,000 are women who cross the border daily to engage in informal trade.14 \n \n9. \nDevelopment challenges and the government\u2019s response. While the Zamyn-Uud free \nzone was established about 17 years ago, it has not become fully operational despite its strategic \nlocation (footnote 3) and investment incentives (footnote 4).15 Several physical and nonphysical \nconstraints  limit  the  zone\u2019s  development.  First,  the  necessary  infrastructure  within  the  zone \nremains  incomplete;  and  gaps are  evident  in  the  water,  wastewater,  heating,  power,  and road \nsystems.16 There is an urgent need to fill the infrastructure gaps and prepare a comprehensive \nfree zone master plan with appropriate zoning for different land uses to attract priority industries \nand  services  to  locate  within  the  zone.17  There  is  also  a  need  for  clear  regulations  for  the \noperations  and  maintenance  of  the  zone  in  order  to  instill  business  confidence  in  long-term \ninvestments. The Zamyn-Uud Free Zone Governor\u2019s Office (ZUFZGO) faces institutional and staff \n\n \n\n12 Joint Communique on Establishing Strategic Partnership Relationship between the PRC and Mongolia, issued on 17 \nJune 2011 in Beijing, PRC, which aims to promote connectivity, access, and economic and social cooperation. The \nagreement  establishing  the  economic  cooperation  zone  includes  provisions  on  investment;  intellectual  property; \nbanking and finance; and areas of cooperation on environment, safety, protection and control, and social services.  \n13 The border crossing point handles traffic of about 3,100 passenger vehicles and 800 lorries per day. During 2015\u2013\n2018,  the  Zamyn-Uud  border  crossing  point  processed  an  annual  average  of  1,600  export  and  37,721  import \ndeclarations  with  a  combined  total  value  of  MNT521.3  million.

Improved coordination among border agencies is crucial to improve trade \ntransactions especially for zone operations.18 \n \n10.  \n  The  government  is  currently  developing  the  Zamyn-Uud  free  zone  through  a  phased \napproach. The initial phase, which will be the focus of the proposed project, will develop about \n300 hectares of the zone. The project will provide infrastructure to service each investor lot within \nthe project area through direct connections for water, wastewater, and heating utilities and power \ntransmission lines. In addition to improving physical infrastructure, the government will address a \nnumber of nonphysical impediments to more efficient trade and investment within the zone. This \nwill  involve  improving  the  transparency  and  predictability  of  the  application  of  laws  and \nregulations, including those governing special treatment of customs duties and employment within \nthe zone (footnote 4). There is a need to strengthen zone operations and management and to \nintegrate the systems maintained by border agencies responsible for customs, inspection, and \nimmigration.  Addressing  these  nonphysical  or  software  constraints,  including  the  use  of \ntechnology, will enable simplified clearance procedures, thereby facilitating movement of goods \nand people while improving surveillance and traceability within the economic cooperation zone.  \n \n11. \nStrategic  fit.

The Government of Mongolia has taken proactive action to \npromote  private  sector  participation  in  free  zone  development.  Interested  investors,  investors\u2019 \nassociations,  chambers  of  commerce,  and  other  stakeholders  were  consulted  during  project \npreparation.26 Under output 2, the proposed project will provide an enabling environment for the \nprivate sector as investors (zone  end-users)  and  explore  the  potential  for  the  private sector to \noperate and manage the free zone. Private sector representatives are also members of the project \nsteering committee (PSC). \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  economic  diversification  and  trade \nlinkages with global and regional value chains enhanced (footnote 20). The project will have the \nfollowing outcome: economic activities and employment in Zamyn-Uud free zone generated.27 \n \n15.  Output  1:  Zamyn-Uud  free  zone  infrastructure  and  facilities  constructed  and \noperational. The project will address infrastructure gaps in the Zamyn-Uud free zone. This output \ncomprises (i) construction within the project area of (a) about 3 kilometers of primary four-lane \nand secondary two-lane roads with sidewalks and streetlights; (b) underground pipes for heating, \nwater supply, and wastewater collection, as well as power supply transmission lines; (c) a solid \nwaste management transfer  station  and a  recycling  center; (d)  a  security  fence in accordance \nwith the specifications of the General Authority of Border Protection; and (e) a gateway complex \nwith a warehouse, control space shed, gender-specific washrooms, and inspection platform; and \n(ii) installation of necessary equipment in the gateway complex, such as cargo and passenger \nautomatic x-ray equipment and radiation detection equipment. \n \n16.  Output  2:  Sustainable  operations  and  management  of  Zamyn-Uud  free  zone \npromoted. This output comprises (i) design of an appropriate public\u2013private partnership model \nto support efficient zone operation and sustainable maintenance arrangements in the Zamyn-Uud \nfree zone; (ii) development of business and market strategies and guidelines with gender equality \nprovisions;  (iii)  gender  awareness  enhancement  and  promotion  of  economic  opportunities  for \nwomen traders in Zamyn-Uud; and (iv) capacity development of the executing and implementing \nagencies for project implementation, monitoring, and evaluation.28  \n \n17.  Output 3: Zamyn-Uud free zone port of entry system established. This output will be \ndelivered  by  using  information  technology  solutions  to  promote  trade  while  ensuring  border \nsecurity,  social  safety,  and  improved  traceability  to  mitigate  transboundary  health  risks.  The \noutput comprises the  development  of (i)  a  passenger  and vehicle inspection  system that uses \ndigital  surveillance  and  facial  biometric  recognition;  and  (ii)  an  integrated  border  management \n\n \n25 ADB. 2010.  Mongolia: Regional Logistics Development Project. Manila. \n26 A market survey was conducted from July 2019 to September 2019 through focused group discussions involving \nseven free zone investors, consultation meetings with the Green Zone investment council (representing 28 investors), \nand questionnaires involving 20 non-investor companies. Interested investors are seeking to either produce goods \n(manufacturing, trade, and food processing) or provide services (travel, logistics and storage services, fuel stations, \nand  construction).  As  of  December  2019,  58  investors had been  granted  lease contracts in  the  Zamyn-Uud  free \nzone. About 5 investors had started construction of their factories.  \n\n27 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n28 The project will determine and establish arrangements for the operation and maintenance of project facilities within \nthe zone. Consideration will be given to outsourcing business-related functions to private entity, introducing value-\nadded services, and funding mechanisms for the maintenance of zone facilities.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fValue Added by ADB \n\ndatabase. The database will promote interagency coordination by linking  the Customs Automated \nInformation System of  Mongolian Customs General Administration (para. 12) with the Inspection \nManagement  System  of  the  General  Agency  of  Specialized  Inspection  and  the  Immigration \nSystem, which is a joint platform shared between the General Authority of Border Protection and \nthe Mongolia Immigration Agency. \n \n18. \nLessons.  Lessons  from  Mongolia\u2019s  past  attempts  to  develop  free  zones  (para.  9)  and \nprevailing international good practices show a need for enabling infrastructure, a sound regulatory \nenvironment,  good  governance,  and  streamlined  procedures.29  Interagency  coordination  and \nstrong partnership with the private sector are also crucial.30 The project reflects these lessons and \nprovides a holistic response to address the free zone\u2019s development needs, i.e., by combining \ninfrastructure (output 1) with capacity development and use of technology (outputs 2 and 3). \n \nC. \n \n19. \nThrough this project, ADB will further strengthen Mongolia\u2019s role in RCI and participation \nin  the  CAREC  program\u2014particularly  the  CAREC  Integrated  Trade  Agenda  2030,  which \nconsolidates and coordinates trade-related initiatives and projects between 11 CAREC member \ncountries and their development partners (footnote 20). By addressing infrastructure gaps within \nthe zone and improving connectivity, ADB will help  Mongolia reduce trade costs. On the non-\nphysical side, ADB\u2019s experience in trade facilitation initiatives will support Mongolia\u2019s efforts to \nstreamline its trade procedures and integrate the inspection and surveillance systems of border \nagencies with the adoption of a single-window system for trade transactions (para. 12).31  \n \nADB  has  also  been  actively  supporting  Mongolian multisectoral  institutions  such  as  the \n20. \nNational Committee on Trade Facilitation and the National Council on Border Development. ADB \nwill  strengthen  coordination  with  the  development  partners  supporting  programs  in  road \ndevelopment, promotion of agricultural exports, and modernization of the standardization system. \nThese  include  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  the  European  Union, \nand the World Bank. ADB will also cooperate with other development partners actively engaged \nin managing transboundary health risks and combating human trafficking and illegal trade.32  \n \nD. \n \n21. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $35.76  million  (Table  1).  Detailed  cost  estimates  by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).33 \n \n22. \nThe government has requested a concessional loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSDR21,996,000 ($30,000,000 equivalent) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance \nthe project.34 The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n \n\n29 ADB. 2018.

Physical  infrastructure  (output  1)  and  use  of  information  and \ncommunication  technology  (output  3)  will  create  time  and  cost  savings  for  industries  in  the \ncooperation zone. The skills training and labor database for Mongolian nationals could help meet \nworkforce demand in both zones, and advisory and coordination will support Mongolia\u2019s bilateral \nagreement with the PRC (output 2). Economic benefits will result when investors begin activities \nin  the  zone.  In  this  regard,  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  combining  public  investments \n(project costs) and private investments (set-up and operational costs using data from a limited \nsurvey extrapolated to the prospective investors). The estimated benefits are: (i) employment, (ii) \ntime  savings  from  movements  of  cargo  and  travelers,  and  (iii)  the  labor  value-added  of \nincremental trade to both the Mongolian economy and regional economic benefits.36 The project \nis found to be economically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of up to 13.2% and an \neconomic net present value of MNT124.2 billion; and to remain economically viable when each \ncost and benefit parameter is separately and adversely varied by 10%.37 \n \nThe financial analysis was conducted in accordance with ADB guidelines.38 By law, the \n26. \nzone\u2019s  revenues  go  to  national  treasury  and  are  not  retained  by  the  ZUFZGO.  The  financial \nanalysis  was  undertaken  based  on  the  incremental  recurrent  cost  of  the  general  government \nsector unit (the ZUFZGO) using 5-year historical performance and 10-year projections. Provisions \nfor (i) asset management of project facilities, and (ii) service-related costs were added to the total \nZUFZGO operating costs beginning in 2026, when the zone will be fully operational.39 Of these \nprovisions, recurrent costs were initially allocated for years 4 and 5 of the project to support early \noperations of the ZUFZGO. The total operating costs for ZUFZGO are projected at MNT5,486 \nmillion  in  2026  and  MNT7,523  million  in  2030.  The  financial  sustainability  risk  is  assessed  as \nsubstantial  because  of  ZUFZGO\u2019s  dependence  on  the  state  budget  and  the  additional  asset \nmanagement and service-related costs that will follow the project.40  \n \n27. \nThe  project\u2019s  financial  sustainability  risk  is  mitigated  by  its  low  fiscal  impact.  The \ngovernment expenditure, including counterpart funds and debt servicing, is calculated at less than \n0.05% of the government\u2019s fiscal budget throughout the 10-year period. Further, based on direct \nand indirect revenues  arising  from the free zone  operations,  a  whole-of-government  cash flow \nanalysis estimates that the zone will generate surpluses for the treasury from the 10th year of full \nzone  operations.  Once  adopted,  the  public\u2013private  partnership  model  developed  under  the \nproject\u2019s output 2 will include arrangements (such as ZUFZGO retaining a portion of the zone\u2019s \nrevenues  for  its  operations  and  maintenance)  that  will  reduce  reliance  on  the  state  budget, \nimprove efficiency, and promote financially sustainable zone management.  \n \n\n \n\n36 Incremental trade is estimated as the value of incremental output, net of raw materials costs, produced by investor \n\ncompanies that are attracted to locate and operate within the zone as a result of the project. \n\n37 The  Economic  Analysis  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB.  2017.

The  project  has  developed  an  EMP  for  the  free  zone  operations,  which \nrecommends  environmentally  suitable  free  zone  operations  such  as  prioritizing  water-saving \nindustries  and  measures  providing  thresholds  for  water  use,  water-saving,  and  waste-water \nrecycling.  The  available  water  resources  are  sufficient  to  support  zone  operations  within  the \nproject area and the local community with the adoption of water-efficiency measures, which are \nincorporated in the project implementation arrangements.41  \n \nC. \n \n29. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines.42 The executing agency has no independent accounting staff or system and is part of \nthe  Cabinet  Secretariat.  Accordingly,  the  assessment  was  undertaken  on  the  Cabinet \nSecretariat\u2019s Finance, Investment and Service Division and the two implementing agencies. The \nfinancial  management  risk  is  assessed  as  substantial.  Both  the  Cabinet  Secretariat  and  the \nZUFZGO  have  weak  in-house  financial  management  capacity  and  no  prior  experience  in \nimplementing  ADB-funded  projects.  This  is mitigated  by  the  extensive  experience  in  externally \nfunded  projects,  including  ADB  operations,  of  the    Ministry  of  Construction  and  Urban \nDevelopment, a key implementing agency, and its qualified and experienced staff accountants. \nThe  financial  management  action  plan,  detailed  in  the  PAM,  includes  the  following  mitigating \nmeasures:  (i)  financial  management  training  for  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies;  (ii) \nrecruitment of a PIU financial specialist with ADB project experience; (iii) the use of appropriate \nfinancial  management  systems,  including  financial  reporting  software;  and  (iv)  closer  ADB \nmonitoring and guidance. \n \nThe project procurement risk assessment, undertaken in accordance with ADB guidelines, \n30. \nassessed the overall procurement risk as medium.43 The key risks include lack of (i) a dedicated \nprocurement unit under the executing and implementing agencies, and (ii) experience with ADB \nproject  procurement  and  implementation  by  the  executing  agency  and  ZUFZGO.  To  mitigate \nthese risks (i) a PIU procurement specialist with ADB experience will be recruited, (ii) high-risk \nand  high-value  contracts  will  be  subject  to  ADB\u2019s  prior  review,  and  (iii)  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies and ADB will jointly undertake regular reviews of the project. Value-for-\nmoney will be achieved by using the lowest-evaluated cost together with appropriate qualification \nand technical requirements as the main evaluation criteria for procurement of goods and works, \nalong with scoring systems that emphasize quality in the case of consulting services. \n \n31. \nNo  significant  integrity  risks  were  identified.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \n\n \n\n41  Overall  water  availability  for  Zamyn-Uud  is  estimated  at  about  2,000  cubic  meters  per  day.  Based  on  potential \nindustrial and commercial use, water demand for the potential 58 investors that signified interest and/or leased land \nis 1,386 cubic meters per day (or 69% of available supply).  \n\n42 ADB.  2005.

The total will grow to 1,900 jobs after 10 years (footnote 37). This will benefit Zamyn-\nUud, where more than 2,000 labor-aged people are unemployed. About 32% of the population \nare women, most of whom are involved in informal trade.44 The project is categorized as effective \ngender  mainstreaming,  and  a  gender  action  plan  was  prepared  to  support  economic \nempowerment of women through (i) promotion of hiring of skilled women within the zone; (ii) pilot \nentrepreneurship training for women traders; (iii) assessment of a potential trader\u2019s market; (iv) \ndevelopment of a database to match investors with job seekers, especially unemployed women; \nand (v) enhanced gender awareness.45 In addition, the project will take an integrated approach to \nprevent human trafficking through (i) a biometric recognition system; and (ii) awareness and anti-\nhuman trafficking campaigns for relevant government agencies, investors, and local communities. \n \nE. \n \n33. \ncategories are as follows.46 \n \n34. \nEnvironment (category B). The initial environmental examination indicates that because \nof  the  nature  and  scale  of  the  project\u2019s  investment  in  civil  works,  adverse  impacts  during \nconstruction will be moderate and temporary and can be mitigated. Once the Zamyn-Uud free \nzone becomes operational, further impacts are expected from the economic activities of investors \ninside the zone and from operations of linked facilities (footnote 16). The EMP for zone operations \nhas been developed to avoid, minimize, and mitigate such impacts (para. 28).47 \n \n35. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). There will be no land acquisition or involuntary \nresettlement resulting from project land use. The Zamyn-Uud free zone is located on state-owned \nspecial purpose land, and civil works under the project will be within the existing right-of-way or \non government land allocated for such purposes under the 2011 free zone master plan. \n \n36. \nproject location is not identified as hosting any ethnic groups.48  \n \nF. \n \n37. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.49 \n \n\nIndigenous peoples (category C).

After the legal amendment, ratification of the bilateral \nagreement with the PRC will be considered. Capacity building and \ninformal dialogue between the two countries will be supported with \navailable technical assistance resources.a \nThe project\u2019s environmental management plan will guide the \nselection and monitoring of industries or sectors in the zone and \npromote water reuse and recycling. This will be complemented by \nsharing of best practices supported by technical assistance. b \nThe first year of project implementation will focus on developing the \ndetailed engineering design and completing procurement. These are \nless sensitive to the impact of COVID-19. The government has \nadopted a comprehensive COVID-19 response plan to address short-\nterm needs as well as boost the economy\u2019s capacity to bounce back \nin the medium term with concerted support from ADB and other \npartners.
