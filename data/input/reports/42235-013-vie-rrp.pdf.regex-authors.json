I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Microfinance Development Program, and (ii) a proposed policy-\nbased loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for subprogram 1.  The report also describes \nproposed administration of technical assistance (TA) for supporting the implementation of the \nProgram, and if the Board approves the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loan, \nI, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. 1  \n \n2.  During the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country programming mission for Viet Nam in \nMay 2008, the Government of Viet Nam requested ADB for a microfinance sector development \nprogram loan. The requested loan was included in ADB's country operations business plan, 2009\u2013\n2011 for Viet Nam2 as well as the project preparatory TA for the program loan.3 The proposed \nprogram will support the government\u2019s policy reform agendas to improve the quality, accessibility, \nefficiency,  and  competitiveness  of  microfinance  in  line  with  the  Viet  Nam  Microfinance \nDevelopment Strategy, 2011\u20132020. The government\u2019s development policy letter is in Appendix 3. \n \n3.  The program will support the development of market-oriented microfinance to increase \naccess to formal financial services for the poor, especially in rural areas. The program will focus on \npolicy  and  regulatory  reforms,  supervisory  capacity  building,  operational  and  institutional \ndevelopment, and financial infrastructure development. Planned policy and regulatory reforms will \nbe  anchored  by  the  integration  of microfinance  into  the formal financial  market,  encouraging \ninvestment in microfinance. Strengthening operational and supervisory capacities will improve the \nsustainability and outreach of microfinance operations. State-owned financial institutions engaged \nin lending to low-income households and microenterprises funded by the government budget will \nbe guided to a reform aiming for self-sustaining financial institutions operating based on market \nprinciples.  Finally,  the  program  seeks  to  develop  financial  infrastructure  supporting  formal \nmicrofinance training, the advocacy of financial literacy on sustainable microfinance and customer \nprotection, and credit information exchange systems.  \n \nII.   THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n4.  Microfinance as a poverty reduction measure. In Viet Nam, about 72% of the population \nlive in rural areas, where agriculture is the economic mainstay (accounting for 54% of the national \nworkforce) and where 94% of the nation\u2019s poor people reside. The government\u2019s national poverty \nreduction program focuses on modernizing agriculture and value-added agroprocessing, promoting \nnonfarm household businesses, and increasing employment opportunities through geographically \ndispersed industrialization and promoting small- and medium-sized enterprises. The results have \nbeen remarkable, with poverty reduced from 58% in 1993 to 12% in 2009, and Viet Nam is poised \nto meet most of its Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Among the major constraints on \nachieving the Goals is the lack of responsive microfinance services. \n \n5.  Fiscal  burden  of  supporting  the  Vietnam  Bank  for  Social  Policies.  The  direct \nintervention of the government in microcredit delivery through the Vietnam Bank for Social Policies \n(VBSP) has crowded out private sector players and hampered the growth of diverse market-\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2008. Country Operations Business Plan. Viet Nam, 2009-2011. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Microfinance Sector \nDevelopment Program. Manila (TA 7499-VIE).  ", "2 \noriented microfinance providers.4 This, in turn, has limited the choices of the vast majority of low-\nincome rural households in accessing a wide range of accommodative financial services including \ncredit, savings, money transfer, and insurance. The VBSP\u2019s state-funded microcredit has marginal \ndirect financial benefit to a borrowing household (estimated at D34,000 per household per month, \nor 0.7% of an average monthly household income) relative to market-based microloans offered by \nprivate microfinance providers. This cannot justify the increasing fiscal burden that results from \nsupporting the VBSP, which was estimated to grow at an annual average rate of 32% from 2003 to \n2009, and stood at D23,580 billion in 2009, or 1.4% of gross domestic product. The fiscal load is \naggravated by population growth, inflation, and a surge in student loans in recent years, expanding \nthe VBSP's social policy lending financed through state-mobilized funds. Under the program, the \nDevelopment  Strategy  for  the  VBSP  towards  2020  (drafted  to  help  the  VBSP  become  a \nsustainable market-oriented financial institution) will be approved for implementation. The strategy \nfocuses on institutional reform, improved banking skills, and awareness raising of stakeholders on \nmarket-oriented microfinance.  \n \n6.  Central  People\u2019s  Credit  Fund.  The  Central  People\u2019s  Credit  Fund  (CCF)  is  an  apex \ninstitution  for  people\u2019s  credit  funds  (PCFs),  which  are  financial  cooperatives  in  Viet  Nam. \nGovernment ownership of the CCF is unique to Viet Nam; elsewhere, apex institutions are wholly \nowned and managed by member primary cooperatives to support \u201cself-help, mutual assistance and \ndemocratic autonomy in the operation of their cooperatives\u201d5 As a result, close to 50% of the CCF \nloan  portfolio  is  outside  the  PCF  network,  with  loans  to  state-owned  enterprises,  small-  and \nmedium-sized enterprises, and entities and individuals who are not PCF members. To achieve its \npotential to become an effective member-based cooperative bank and better serve its member \nPCFs,  the  CCF  is  set to  be transformed  by  the  government  into  a cooperative  bank  widely \nsupported by PCFs with adequate institutional and operational capacities. The program will support \ngovernment efforts to promote greater PCF ownership of the CCF and strengthen the CCF\u2019s \ncapacity to improve its service to PCFs. \n \n7.  People\u2019s credit funds. There were 1.7 million PCF members as of the end of 2010, with \nan average of 1,700 members per PCF. Since 1997, the number of PCF members has increased \nat an average annual rate of 1%, and 10% of all national communes are reached. Given that over \n94% of PCFs are more than 10 years old, the overall membership growth is not remarkable. Aside \nfrom the government policy that limits the number of PCFs to one in each commune, the oligarchic \nownership structure of PCFs has hindered growth of new members that could have strengthened \nthe capital base of PCFs. Typically, PCFs have less than 50 core members from higher-income \nhouseholds, who have the exclusive right to be board members. There is a strong incentive to set \nbarriers to entry for new members, thereby securing a higher return on equity for the original core \nmembers. To deepen financial inclusion by utilizing a viable financial cooperative system, the \nprogram will support a recently launched government initiative to improve the governance structure \nand strengthen institutional and operational capacities of PCFs in a cohesive manner.  \n \n8.  Microfinance institutions. The development of microfinance institutions (MFIs) has been \nconstrained by the lack of the legal and regulatory framework necessary for establishing formal \nMFIs. Since 1991, only one MFI has attained a membership of over 130,000, two have about \n40,000, and three have about 20,000 clients, which in total account for over 60% of the clients of \n                                                \n4  \u201cThe delivery of microfinance services is still widely perceived among government officials and the public as a social \nmission to be financed and carried out by the government rather than as a sustainable financial business geared \ntoward the poor.\u201d B.

To help MFIs grow, the government\u2014with ADB assistance\u2014has prepared the \nlegal and regulatory framework to allow formal MFIs to take deposits under the prudential norms \nand license of the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) (para. 11). So far, two leading MFIs\u2014Tinh Thuong \nOne  Member  Limited  Liability  Microfinance  Institution,  commonly  known  as  TYM  and  M7-\nMicrofinance Institution Limited, commonly known as M7\u2013MFI\u2014have been licensed, while several \nothers are applying for a license. Formalization with the SBV\u2019s license will help MFIs improve their \ngovernance structure and strengthen their overall capacity to offer competitive financial services\u2014\nincluding savings and credit products\u2014against the VBSP, PCFs to be supported by a cooperative \nbank (transformed from the CCF), and the expansion of other credit institutions and banks into \ninformation technology (IT)-enhanced microfinance operators. The program will further promote the \ngrowth  of  formal  MFIs  through  increased  capacity  building  activities  for  both  operators  and \nregulators. \n \n9.  Government commitment to market-oriented sector reform. Recognizing the vital role \nof  microfinance  as  a  potent  tool  to  reduce  poverty,  the  Vietnam  Microfinance  Development \nStrategy, 2011\u20132020 was formulated with ADB assistance6 and approved by the prime minister,7 \nwith the aim of  \n(i)  establishing the legal, policy, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks;  \n(ii)  strengthening policy formulation and regulatory and supervisory capacity;  \n(iii)  increasing the operational capacity of MFIs;  \n(iv)  improving the institutional and financial capacities of the VBSP, and helping to \nimplement  its  development  strategy  toward  self-sustaining  and  market-oriented \noperations;  \n(v)  developing financial infrastructure including training institutes and credit information \nbureaus; and  \n(vi)  promoting a national financial literacy campaign.  \n \n10.  The national microfinance strategy demonstrates government commitment to microfinance \nsector reform, aiming to gradually transform the sector currently dominated by the social protection \nschemes into a robust financial market supported by vibrant operations based on market principles \nto better cater to the diverse needs of clients for safe and accommodative financial services.8 The \ngovernment  has  also  formulated  various  laws  and  regulations  to  support  sector  growth  and \nsustainability, thus providing responsive financial services to the poor and low-income market. \nAmong the most significant landmark legislation promulgated is the Credit Institutions Law, 2010 \n(CIL), which took effect in January 2011. The CIL, for the first time, recognized microfinance as a \nformal  financial  service,  and  mandates  the  SBV  to  impose  prudential  norms  over  financial \ninstitutions engaged in microfinance.9 The CIL is also expected to further broaden, deepen, and \nstrengthen the microfinance sector, supporting the national microfinance strategy. The program will \n                                                \n6  The TA for Preparing the Microfinance Sector Development Program contributed to the formulation of the national \nmicrofinance strategy by completion of a sector assessment and a development plan and by consultation with \nstakeholders through a workshop.  \n7  Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 2195/2011/QD-TTg dated 6 December 2011. \n8  Viet Nam Microfinance Development Strategy, 2011\u20132020 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n9  Under the CIL, MFIs and cooperative credit institutions comprising cooperative banks and PCFs are placed under the \nsupervision and regulation of the SBV. The CIL also covers policy banks (including the VBSP), which will continue to \nimplement state socioeconomic policies on a not-for-profit basis and will remain under the organizational and \noperational control of the government. However, all policy banks are now required to implement internal control and \naudits; develop and issue internal procedures applicable to their operations; and adopt statistical, operational, and \npayment activity reports in accordance with stipulations of the SBV.  \n ", "4 \nsupport the government in implementing the national microfinance strategy and help formulate \ndetailed implementing rules and regulations (IRRs) of CIL provisions relating to microfinance. \n \n11.  ADB assistance. ADB has supported the government\u2019s initiative to establish the formal \nMFI sector with two TA grants supporting the preparation of the microfinance legal framework.10 As \na  result,  in  March  2005,  Decree  No.  28  on  the  organization  and  operation  of  microfinance \ninstitutions in Viet Nam was issued, followed by Decree No. 165 issued in November 2007 to \nsupplement Decree No. 28. In 2009, ADB approved a Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) \ngrant11 to support the implementation of the decrees. The grant provides technical assistance and \nsupplementary matching funds to assist the transformation of semiformal microfinance programs \ninto  formal  regulated  MFIs.  The  program  is  designed  to  further  support  the  government  in \nformulating a policy and regulatory environment supportive  of market-oriented operations and \nprivate sector innovations. Lessons from past assistance by ADB and other development partners \nto the sector in Viet Nam and the region include the importance of (i) integrating microfinance \nregulation in general banking law and harmonizing it with microfinance-specific regulations to \npromote fair competition among diverse financial institutions; and (ii) the government focusing on \ncreating an enabling environment to support private sector development in microfinance rather \nthan being directly involved in microfinance operations. Both of these aspects were bases used in \ndesigning the program. \n \n12.  Link to country partnership strategy. ADB, in its country partnership strategy for Viet \nNam12, supports the Viet Nam Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2011\u20132015, which aims to \ntransform the country into a modern, productive, and equitable economy. ADB\u2019s new country \npartnership strategy will pursue inclusive growth by improving the poor's access to opportunities \nincluding infrastructure, microfinance, rural development, and social services, and also economic \nefficiency  through  support  to  economic  restructuring  and  related  reforms  focusing  on  public \ninvestment planning and financial sector deepening. It is in this context that the program was \nformulated  to  support  government  efforts  in  improving  the  overall  quality  and  capacity  of \nmicrofinance, focusing on an improved policy and regulatory environment, increased operational \nand  supervisory  capacities,  and  financial  infrastructure  development  along  with  the  national \nmicrofinance strategy. The program will address the existing constraints on nationwide access to \nformal  financial  services,  and  thus  (i)  develop  an  equitable  economy  by  promoting  a  robust \nmicrofinance sector with an improved policy and regulatory environment supportive of the growth \nof private sector operations, (ii) promote wide adoption of microfinance best practices, and (iii) \nincrease  financial  infrastructure  development.  It  will  enhance  financial  inclusion  by  improving \naccess to financial services for traditionally underserved poor households, and supporting inclusive \ngrowth in line with ADB\u2019s financial sector operational plan.13 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact will be greater financial inclusion and a deepened finance sector. The outcome \nwill be increased access of poor women and men to sustainable and affordable microfinance \nservices. \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2001.

Output 1: Creating a policy and regulatory environment conducive to an inclusive, \nsustainable,  and  market-oriented  microfinance  sector.  To  support  government  initiatives \ntoward a vibrant microfinance industry in line with the national microfinance strategy and the CIL, \nthe program will seek to encourage diverse financial institutions to contribute toward deepening \nfinancial inclusion. It will finalize the draft IRRs prepared by the SBV to formulate (i) SBV licensing \nrequirements and prudential norms for MFIs based on performance standards, credit classification, \nand provision standards; and (ii) audit and reporting requirements applicable to the VBSP, PCFs, \nand other microfinance operating credit institutions to secure the integrity and transparency of MFI \noperations. The branching guideline has been revised to facilitate the expansion of MFIs' business. \nFurther,  fiscal  incentives  and  regulatory  requirements  for  all  operating  microfinance  credit \ninstitutions will be considered to promote service outreach, especially in rural areas.  \n \n16.  Consumer safeguard measures will be established, promoted, and ensured by formulating \nIRRs of the CIL provisions on consumer protection, which will be disseminated to the public. In \nresponse to the growing needs for microinsurance, greater involvement of credit institutions in the \nprovision of insurance services/products is facilitated and promoted in a prudent manner.  IT-\nenhanced banking service will be facilitated through the issuance of IRRs to reduce transaction \ncosts and expand access to services for microfinance clients in rural and remote areas. The IRRs \nmay include incentives to promote new entry into microfinance through e-banking. To promote \nnational gender equality targets, licensed MFIs will be required by a newly formulated regulation to \nreport gender-specific client data to the SBV. \n \n17.  Output 2: Strengthening the supervisory and regulatory capacities of microfinance \nsector regulators. Because the MFI license applications have only recently emerged, there are \nfew qualified regulators to provide effective supervision of the microfinance sector. The SBV needs \nto increase its regulatory capacity, focusing on the special features of microfinance,14 including the \nwidely  accepted  MFI  performance  standards15 and  proven  best  practices  not  applicable  to \ncommercial banking operations.16 The lack of qualified regulators will be further aggravated as a \ngrowing number of MFIs will be licensed and the number of PCFs will increase in line with the \nexpansion plan; 1,700 PCFs are expected to be operating by 2020, increasing from the current \n1,060. The program will help the government strengthen the overall supervisory and regulatory \ncapacity and oversight authority of the SBV over microfinance credit institutions and that of the \nMinistry  of  Finance  over  the  VBSP.  To  effectively  strengthen  the  oversight  agencies\u2019 \nsupervisory/regulatory  capacity,  the  draft  manual  of  supervision  with  performance  standards \nprepared by an ADB project (footnote 10) will be finalized for actual implementation. \n \n18.  Output  3:  Strengthening  credit  institutions  involved  in  microfinance  to  provide \naffordable  and  sustainable  services to  the  poor.  The development strategy for the VBSP \ntowards 2020 will be approved, aiming to initiate market-oriented reforms for the VBSP to attain \noperational and financial sustainability. This may include redefining the social policy lending of the \n                                                \n14  An issue being addressed by the JFPR grant for Formalizing Microfinance Institutions (footnote 11).  \n15 The MFI performance standards include PEARLS (protection, effective financial structure, asset quality, reports, \nliquidity, signs of growth), PESOS (portfolio quality, efficiency, stability, operations, structure of assets), and other \nwidely accepted standards set by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (for MFIs) and by the World Council of \nCredit Unions (for financial cooperatives).  \n16 Microfinance-specific practices include the means test for credit needs and qualification assessment, and close credit \nmonitoring through group meetings and/or frequent account officer visits to clients. \n ", "6 \nVBSP to achieve a better balance between government objectives and measures to lessen risk \ntaking, and improve the effectiveness of the VBSP\u2019s microfinance products. \n \n19.  In line with the CCF/PCF provisions of the CIL and the approved 10-year development \nstrategy for the CCF/PCF system,17 the program will support the transformation of the CCF into a \ncooperative bank with increased ownership by member PCFs in order to better serve the PCF \nnetwork and reduce its dependence on the government.  \n \n20.  The SBV recognizes the flaws of the oligarchic ownership structure of PCFs and is adopting \nmeasures to correct this by following best cooperative practices. Draft IRRs for ownership and \ngovernance of PCFs, as well as its banking services to nonmembers, will be formulated to promote \nthe growth of active member participation, especially from among low-income households. The \nSBV will finalize IRRs to promote membership expansion of PCFs and effective service delivery. \n \n21.  Output 4: Supporting development of the infrastructure for the microfinance sector. \nAs recognized credit institutions under the CIL, MFIs and PCFs need core banking knowledge \nincluding basic banking principles, financial governance, risk management, prudential standards, \nand IT-enhanced products and services, as well as updated technical know-how on best practices \nfor microfinance and financial cooperative operations. To ensure quality and sustainable capacity \nbuilding services, the program will help the SBV\u2019s Banking Academy18 establish a microfinance \ncenter to provide training, research, consultancy, and other services related to the microfinance \nsector. Training modules will be developed through capacity building needs analysis, and will be \ndesigned  to  combine  classroom  lectures  with  on-the-job/onsite  practical  training  used  by \nparticipating model credit institutions. Expertise will be drawn from microfinance training institutes \n(both at home and overseas), microfinance operating credit institutions, and other national partners \nto ensure optimum coverage of the knowledge areas required for microfinance operations.  \n \n22.  The  VBSP\u2019s  operations  are  conducted  through  savings  and  credit  groups  nationwide \nengaged in savings and credit administration as partners and receiving VBSP services as clients at \nthe same time. A financial literacy program focusing on microfinance will be conducted for the \nVBSP  savings  and  credit  groups,  PCFs,  VBSP  and  CCF  management  and  staff,  concerned \ngovernment agencies, and mass organizations. To support reform processes of the VBSP and the \nPCF/CCF system, the financial literacy program will facilitate understanding on market-oriented \nmicrofinance and its benefits, clients\u2019 rights and responsibilities, customer protection, and other \nsubjects related to sustainable microfinance. \n \n23.  There is strong anecdotal evidence of multiple financing of microborrowers in areas where \nthe VBSP, the Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, PCFs, and MFIs all operate. \nWith the VBSP covering almost all communes, future expansion of PCFs and MFIs and the \npossible entry of commercial banks into the microfinance market using e-banking will inevitably \nincrease the risks of financing duplication and over indebtedness, known as credit pollution. The \nVBSP, PCFs, and MFIs are presently not providing microfinance credit information to the SBV \nCredit Information Center (CIC), a nationwide credit bureau. Their full participation is made difficult \nby the huge volume of microcredit information that cannot be captured by their current systems, \ntheir commune-level operations, and the low level of IT use in their operations. To support effective \nmicrocredit information management, an IT-based credit information exchange system will be \ndeveloped at the CIC.  \n                                                \n17 SBV Decision No. 6136 issued in 2007. \n18 The Banking Academy was organized in 1961 by the SBV to provide professional training and research in the fields of \neconomics, finance, and banking. \n ", "7 \nD.  Development Financing Needs  \n \n24.  The program is a programmatic approach comprising two single-tranche subprograms. \nSubprogram 1 comprises a single tranche loan of SDR25,919,000 covering April 2008\u2013June 2012. \nSubprogram 2, with an indicative amount of $50 million subject to further discussion between ADB \nand  the  government  and  the  availability  of  Asian  Development  Fund  resources,  will  be \nimplemented for July 2012\u2013September 2014. Subprogram 2 will be submitted for Board approval \nupon completion of the policy triggers. The policy matrix given in Appendix 4 indicates the program \nframework including the government actions taken prior to Board consideration for subprogram 1, \nproposed policy actions for subprogram 2, and medium-term direction.  \n \n25.  The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR25,919,000 \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 24\u2013year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. The government will use the local currency counterpart funds generated by the \nloan proceeds to meet program expenditures and associated costs of reform, and will provide the \nnecessary  budget  appropriations  to  finance  the  structural  adjustment  costs  relating  to  the \nimplementation of reforms under the program. \n \n26.  The program programmatic approach will support reforms outlined in the development \npolicy  letter  and  policy  matrix.  The  loan  amount  is  determined  by  the  significance  of  the \nmicrofinance  sector  to  the  overall  economy,  the  expected  development  impact  of  the  policy \npackage, the adjustment costs, and the development financing needs of the government, including \ncosts for (i) developing the formal MFI sector to expand its outreach to clients; (ii) assisting the \nVBSP to achieve operational and financial self-sustainability in line with its development strategy \ntoward  2020;  (iii) initiating  the  transformation  of  the  CCF  into  a  cooperative  bank  and  the \nrestructuring of the CCF/PCF network into a member-based financial cooperative system; and (iv) \nhelping the Banking Academy establish a microfinance center to provide capacity building services \nto the microfinance sector. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n27.  The SBV will be the executing agency. It will establish a steering committee to provide \ngeneral policy direction and overall coordination for implementation of the program. The steering \ncommittee  will  be  chaired  by  the  SBV  deputy  governor,  with  high  officials  representing  the \nconcerned stakeholders including the Ministry of Finance, VBSP, CCF, CIC and the Banking \nAcademy  as  members.  The  SBV  will  also  establish  a  program  management  unit  to  provide \ntechnical support to the steering committee. The unit will oversee loan implementation, including \ntaking and confirming policy actions, coordinating TA activities among implementing agencies, \nundertaking program administration, and communicating with ADB on behalf of the government. \nThe  implementing  agencies  will  be  Ministry  of  Finance,  VBSP,  CCF,  CIC,  and  the  Banking \nAcademy, each of which will be responsible for program reporting and discussing implementing \nissues with the SBV. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1. \n \n ", "8 \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspect   Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2008\u2013September 2014 \nEstimated completion date  30 September 2014 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Steering committee chaired by the SBV deputy governor, with agencies \nand stakeholders representing the Ministry of Finance, VBSP, CCF, CIC \nand the Banking Academy. \n(ii)  Executing agency  SBV \n(iii)  Implementing agencies  MOF, VBSP, CCF, CIC, and Banking Academy \nDisbursement  The loan of $40 million will be disbursed in a single tranche. \nCCF = Central People\u2019s Credit Fund, CIC = Credit Information Center, MOF= Ministry of Finance, SBV = State Bank of \nVietnam, VBSP = Vietnam Bank for Social Policies. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n28.  In connection with the program, the government has requested ADB for policy and advisory \nTA for Supporting Microfinance Development Program.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) in the amount of $500,000 and administered by \nADB.  The SBV, the Ministry of Finance, and the CIC will provide counterpart support in the form of \noffice  space,  counterpart  staff,  and  other  support  facilities.    The  TA  will  (i)  support  the \nimplementation of the program by achieving a medium-term reform agenda in microfinance, and (ii) \nprovide the government with policy advice. The TA scope includes: (i) formulation of draft IRRs of \nthe new CIL provisions on microfinance; (ii) the study and recommendation of fiscal and regulatory \nincentives for microfinance operating credit institutions; (iii) the planning, development, and training \nfor a microfinance credit information exchange system at the CIC; and (iv) review and improvement \nof the current insurance regulations to support the development of microinsurance.  \n \n29.  The executing agency for the TA will be the SBV. The implementing agencies for the TA will \nbe the SBV, the Ministry of Finance, and the CIC. The TA will begin in September 2012 and will be \nimplemented over 18 months ending in February 2014. The TA will provide 10 person-months of \ninternational  consulting  services  and  12  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  The \nconsultants will work on an intermittent basis and will be engaged in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under \nthe TA will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). Equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA expenditures will comply \nwith  JFPR  guidelines.  A  full  description  of  the  TA,  including  implementation  arrangements, \nconsultant  terms  and  conditions,  cost  estimates,  and  financing  plan,  is  included  as  a  linked \ndocument.19  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE  \n \nA.  Programmatic Approach \n \n30.  The mission team has undertaken a due diligence assessment in consultation with the \ngovernment  to  evaluate  the  policy  actions  that  could  trigger  subprogram  1.  In  formulating \nsubprogram 2, the mission team and consultant team will focus on technical viability, economic \n                                                \n19  Policy and Advisory Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nand financial viability and sustainability, prudential requirement and customer protection, poverty \nand social impact, and the safeguard policy aspects.  \n \n31.  Governance and anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the government and the SBV. The government is taking an \nactive approach against corruption, including the enactment of the Anti-Corruption Law, 2005.  \nA legal framework has been established to protect and reward whistle-blowers. \n \nB.  Safeguards \n \n32.  The program is classified category C for all safeguard categories (environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples).  \n \nC.  Gender \n \n33.  The program is categorized as providing some gender benefits. Traditionally, there has \nbeen strong participation of women in the Viet Nam microfinance sector; however, not enough \ngender-related data is available. Improved data collection would ensure that microfinance plays a \nsignificant catalytic role in promoting women\u2019s economic empowerment. The program will formulate \nrules and regulations to require licensed MFIs to report sex-disaggregated microfinance client data.  \n \nD.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n34.  The program assumes political stability in the country and continued adoption of sound \nmacroeconomic  policies.  Despite  the  sound  track  record  of  Viet  Nam,  implementation  of  the \nprogram is still subject to the risks described in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisk  Mitigating Measures \nExogenous,  The government is strengthening its monetary policy framework, expanding the tax \ninternational  base, and strengthening public expenditure management with the assistance of \nfinancial shock  development partners including ADB. ADB and other development partners in Viet Nam, \nand  including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, hold regular consultative \nmacroeconomic  meetings with the government on the macroeconomic policy and the stability and \ninstability  development of the finance sector.  \nPolitical  The government has shown strong commitment to the reform agenda. Government \nresistance and  commitment is also manifested in the scope of legal and regulatory reforms \nvested interest  implemented across the finance sector. The Microfinance Development Program \nagainst the  reduces this risk by focusing policy actions on a small number of important reforms, \nreform  which will have a high impact, with firm and wide support from the government and the \nconcerned stakeholders. \nPoor governance  The government is increasingly adopting a tougher stance on corruption and has \nand corruption  recently taken measures, including enacting the Anti-Corruption Law, 2005 and setting \nup a steering committee against corruption. Results of investigations against corruption \noverseen by the government inspectorate have been disclosed, and a legal framework \nis established to protect and reward whistle-blowers. \nADB = Asian Development Bank.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n35.   The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to all \napplicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, \n ", "10 \nprocurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan agreement. \nThe government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants, which are set forth in the loan \nagreement. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loan would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the \nabsence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, \nI recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the programmatic approach for the Microfinance Development Program, and \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR25,919,000 to the Socialist Republic \nof Viet Nam for subprogram 1 of the Microfinance Development Program, from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 24 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \nBindu Lohani \nVice President \n13 June 2012 \n \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nand Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n \nGreater financial  Rural areas share of  Macroeconomic and \nSBV banking statistics \ninclusion and deepened  total loans outstanding  political stability is \n \nfinance sector   increased to 20% by  maintained. \n \n2014 (2010 baseline: \n  Economic growth \n17%) \n  remains positive in \nSavings mobilized by  SBV banking statistics  2011\u20132014. \nMFIs increased by 20%   \nin 2014 (2010 baseline:    Risk \nD248.65 billion)    Effects of external \n \nshocks are not \nM2:GDP ratio increased  National statistics and \naddressed amicably and \nby 10% in 2014 (2010  IMF reports \nthus affect the overall \nbaseline: 133% of GDP)   \neconomy.  \n \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nNumber of male and  SBV reports \nIncreased access of  The government \nfemale microfinance   \npoor women and men to  remains committed to \nborrowers increased by   \nsustainable and  microfinance \n10% in 2014,   \naffordable microfinance  development. \ndisaggregated by sex   \nservices  \n(2010 baseline:    Coordination among \n12.5 million)    concerned government \n  agencies is maintained \n \nNumber of microfinance  SBV reports  for sector development. \nsavings accounts \nincreased by 10% in    Risk \n2014, disaggregated by    Resistance persists \nsex (2010 baseline:    against reform \n9.7 million)    measures. \n   \nOutputs      Assumption \n     \nAdequate resources are \n1.
