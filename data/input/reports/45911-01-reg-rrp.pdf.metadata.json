ASEAF II\u2019s target size is $180 million, and the fund manager will make growth capital \nand buyout investments in high-potential companies.  \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has had a lengthy relationship with Aureos Capital \n3. \nthat dates back to 1997, and has invested in four of its Asian funds: Aureos South Asia, ASEAF, \nKula Fund I, and Kula Fund II. Aureos is thus well known to ADB, and vice versa. Aureos began \nexploring  a  potential  ADB  investment  in  ASEAF  II  as  soon  as  it  began  fund-raising.  Due  to \nresource constraints and a desire for additional visibility on exits from ASEAF, ADB waited for \nover  a  year  to  begin  processing  the  investment,  but  had  identified  ASEAF  II  as  a  potential \ninvestee throughout that time.  \n \nB. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n4. \nStrategy. ASEAF II will pursue an investment strategy similar to that of ASEAF and the \nAMF  within  the  target  countries.  ASEAF  II  will  seek  to  make  investments  in  the  range  of \n$2 million\u2013$10 million, each in a balanced and diversified portfolio of 20\u201325 established, high-\ngrowth  businesses  with  expected  enterprise  values  of  $20  million\u2013$100 million.  The  fund \nmanager  will  focus  primarily  on  companies  servicing  domestic  demand  and/or  regional \nmarkets,  in  sectors  that  reflect  a  country\u2019s  comparative  advantage. 1\n ASEAF  II\u2019s  overall \nobjective  will  be  to  generate  returns  by  making  minority  or  majority  equity  investments  in \nestablished SMEs led by experienced management teams. The fund manager expects to have \neffective management controls through minority shareholder rights and/or representation on the \nboard of directors, and will have influence over the recruitment of key management staff. The \nfund  manager  anticipates  that  the  majority  of  investments  will  be  held  for  an  average  of  3\u20135 \nyears, in keeping with ASEAF II\u2019s \u201cbuy and build\u201d strategy.  \n \n5. \nDeal sourcing. Investment opportunities will be screened by sector and across markets. \nIn  addition,  analysis  and  assessments  will  be  made  by  reviewing  economic  and  development \ntrends  across  target  countries,  and  engaging  in  proactive  research  and  top\u2013down  analysis. \nInvestment  opportunities  have  been,  and  are  expected  to  continue  to  be,  identified  in  the \n                                                \n1  General  investment  sectors  include  fast-moving  consumer  goods,  retail,  restaurant  chains  and  franchises,  light \nmanufacturing, distribution and logistics, support services, infrastructure, construction materials, business services \nrelated  to  information  technology,  business  process  outsourcing  and  \u201cdefensive\u201d  sectors  such  as  health  care, \neducation, and sanitation.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nfollowing  ways:  (i)  direct  contact  with  business  owners,  (ii)  referrals  from  local  entrepreneurs, \nand  (iii)  referrals  from  local  financial  institutions.  In  Aureos\u2019  experience,  SME  transactions \nthroughout  the  target  region  are  relationship-driven,  therefore  Aureos  commits  extensive \nresources  to  building  and  maintaining  tailored  personal  relationships  with  key  executives, \nbusiness  owners,  and  deal  providers  across the  target  region,  and the team members  have  a \ndeep understanding of the target countries.  \n \n6. \nDeal  structuring.  ASEAF  II  will  employ  a  flexible  approach to  structuring  investments, \nusing a combination of equity, secured and unsecured debt, mezzanine debt, and quasi-equity \ninstruments such as convertible loans and preference shares. Aureos expects to receive up to \n30%\u201340%  of  the  total  portfolio  cost  back  from  its  investments  in  the  form  of  cash  flows,  and \nbelieves  that  ASEAF  II  will  benefit  from  the  generation  of  these  early  returns  in  the  form  of \nscheduled contractual cash flows throughout the investment period, which mitigate currency risk \nand dependency on single liquidity events.  \n \n7. \nValue  addition.  Aureos  believes  that  an  active,  hands-on  approach  is  essential  to  the \ndevelopment  of,  and  the  successful  exit  from,  its  investments  at  enhanced  valuations.  In  that \ncontext,  Aureos  will  focus  on  the  institutional  strengthening  of  portfolio  companies  to  meet \ninternational  standards,  including  strengthening  leadership  in  such  companies  in  the  following \nareas: \n(ii)  growth  strategies; \n(iii) operational  performance  improvements;  (iv) financial  management;  and  (v)  implementation \nof environmental, social, and governance standards. Aureos will seek to add value in particular \nby  helping  companies  with  regional  expansion,  leveraging  their  network  throughout  multiple \ncountries in Southeast Asia.  \n \n8. \nExit. In Aureos\u2019 view, investments in SMEs present a wide range of potential exit routes, \nprincipally  trade  sales  to  strategic  acquirers,  recapitalizations,  and  initial  public  offerings.  As  a \nconsequence  of  these  multiple  potential  exit  routes,  companies  are  not  solely  dependent  on \nactivity  levels  in  the  capital  markets  (although  all  five  main  target  countries  of  ASEAF  II  have \nrelatively  liquid  stock  markets).  Aureos\u2019  experience  demonstrates  that  a  key  determinant  of \ninvestment  viability  is  the  identification  of  an  appropriate  exit  strategy.  As  described  above, \nAureos\u2019 deal structures reduce the dependency on single liquidity events to generate returns, as \na  significant  proportion  of  returns  are  generated  through  contractual  yields  as  well  as \nredemption through regular scheduled capital repayments of the debt portion of the investment.  \n \nC. \n\n(i)  strategy,  management,  and  corporate  governance; \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n1. \n\nSponsor and Ownership \n\nASEAF  II  is  sponsored  by  Aureos  Capital,  a  global  private  equity  manager  with  a         \n\n \n9. \n19-year history of investing in SMEs in emerging markets. Aureos Capital was founded in 2001 \nas a joint venture between CDC Group and Norfund, with the initial mandate to manage out an \nexisting portfolio of 139 investments. In December 2008, Aureos staff completed a management \nbuyout from the two founding shareholders and today retain 100% ownership of Aureos Capital. \nWith over $1.3 billion in funds under management, Aureos has invested in 126 new transactions \nacross  Asia,  Latin  America,  and  Africa,  with  a  current  realized  internal  rate  of  return  (IRR)  of \nover  30%.  The  firm  has  a  robust  infrastructure  for  SME  investing,  covering  over  50  emerging \nmarket  countries,  with  over  90  investment  professionals  with  experience  in  private  equity, \ncommerce,  consulting, \nlocated  across \ninvestment  banking,  and  development \n29 locations  worldwide.  Aureos\u2019  experienced  local  investment  professionals  have  broad  sector \n\nfinance, \n\n\fknowledge  and  strong  cultural  understanding  of  emerging  markets,  with  access  to  deep  local \nand regional networks.  \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernance Structure \n\n \n10.  Management. ASEAF II\u2019s investment team comprises 18 investment professionals with \nextensive  private  equity  and  SME  business  investment  and  operational  experience.  The  five \nsenior  team  members,  all  of  whom  have  worked  together  in  ASEAF,  have  a  deep  skill  set, \nincluding (i) a track record of successful exits in Southeast Asia; (ii) a skills base covering the \nfull  range  of  SME  needs;  (iii)  a  wide  range  of  relevant  commercial  experience  gained  from \ninvestment, financial, and operational roles, ensuring a broad perspective on issues; and (iv) an \nextensive,  high-quality  contact  base  of  industry  executives,  providing  a  substantial  flow  of \ninvestment  opportunities  and  a  source  of  advice  from  sector  experts  at  both  pre-  and  post-\ninvestment stages.  \n \n11. \nCorporate  governance. ASEAF II will establish an advisory committee consisting of at \nleast five members selected from among the larger limited partners. The advisory committee will \nconsult  with  the  fund  manager  as  to  general  policies  and  guidelines  involving  the  changing  of \nauditors and valuation policy, prospective investment sectors, and conflicts of interest. ADB will \nhave a seat on the advisory committee.   \n \n12. \nRisk  management.  For  private  equity  funds,  risk  management  can  be  understood  as \nthe process by which the fund in question selects, analyzes, structures, and exits investments \n(i.e., the investment process and policies that aim to identify risks, balance those risks against \nthe anticipated returns of the investment, and mitigate the risks to the extent possible). Aureos, \nan  established  global  fund  manager,  adheres  to  a  structured,  consultative,  and  accountable \ndecision-making  process.  Once  preliminary  due  diligence  and  pre-screening  have  been \nsatisfactorily  completed,  the  team  proposing  the  investment  will  prepare  a  report  to  the \ninvestment  committee  for  consideration  outlining  the  investment  rationale  and  proposed \nstructure, and will seek approval to conduct further due diligence. Once a transaction has been \nfully  negotiated,  which  may  involve  several  further  investment  committee  meetings,  the \ninvestment  will  be  presented  to  the  investment  committee  for  final  approval.  The  investment \ncommittee of ASEAF II will comprise six senior Aureos investment professionals.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n13. \nADB  proposes  to  make  an  equity  investment  of  up  to  $15  million  in  ASEAF  II,  not  to \nexceed  25%  of  the  aggregate  capital  commitments  to  ASEAF  II,  whichever  is  less,  and  not \nresulting in ADB being the largest investor in ASEAF II. ADB\u2019s equity contribution will be used \nexclusively for investments in ADB\u2019s developing member countries.  \n \n14. \nhave a 5-year investment period, extendable by 1 year.  \n \nB. \n\nASEAF  II  will  have  a  10-year  life,  extendable  by  up  to  two  1-year  extensions,  and  will \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n15.  With regard to private equity fund investments, the term \u201cimplementation arrangements\u201d \nrefers to all processes and mechanisms used for investment performance monitoring, reporting, \nand evaluation. These processes and mechanisms include (i) financial monitoring\u2014receipt and \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nreview by ADB of quarterly unaudited and annual audited reports including financial statements, \na  fund  overview,  and  an  overview  of  the  portfolio  companies\u2019  performance  and  valuation; \n(ii) ADB  representation  on  ASEAF  II\u2019s  advisory  board,  and  attendance  at  advisory  board \nmeetings;  and  (iii)  non-financial  monitoring\u2014receipt  and  review  by  ADB  of  ASEAF  II\u2019s \nenvironmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS)  and  annual  reviews  of  environmental \nand social safeguard issues. \n \nC. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n16. \nADB\u2019s assistance to ASEAF II is justified for a number of reasons: (i) demonstration and \nsignaling  effect,  (ii)  market  development  and  catalytic  effect,  and  (iii)  ADB  portfolio \ndiversification. \n \n17. \nDemonstration and signaling effect. Part of ADB\u2019s role in capital market development \nis an effort to signal to the market its views on appropriate, viable business models. By investing \nin ASEAF II, ADB will send a signal to the market regarding the types of business models that it \nsupports (i.e., funds with local teams and presence, track records, links with a global platform, \nstrong  governance,  and  strong  environmental  and  social  safeguard  standards).  ASEAF  II  is \nbacked  by  a  fund  management  platform  that  is  experienced  with  (i)  development  impact \nreporting,  and  (ii)  development  finance  institution  (DFI)-compliant  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard  standards,  and  that  has  the  opportunity  to  leverage  and  replicate  successful \nexperiences  in  non-Asian  emerging  markets  to  the  benefit  of  its  investees.  ADB\u2019s  support  of \nASEAF II will guide fund managers entering the market toward appropriate and attractive fund \nmodels for the region.  \n \n18.  Market  development  and  catalytic  effect.  The  selection  of  ASEAF  II  results  from  a \nmarket  mapping  exercise  that  identified  Aureos  as  one  of  the  most  reliable  private  equity \noperators in the region. By supporting a reference player, ADB will continue to establish private \nequity in markets where it is still nascent. Also key to ADB\u2019s added value in this transaction is its \ncatalytic effect, i.e., the fact that ADB\u2019s participation will help to attract additional investors and \nthus build deeper, broader, stronger private equity markets in this region. To ensure that ADB\u2019s \ninvestment is indeed \u201ccatalytic\u201d and serves as a genuine incentive to the fund manager to raise \nadditional  capital,  ADB  has  structured  conditionality  into  the  investment,  such  that  $10  million \nwill be committed up front, with an additional $5 million to be committed after ASEAF II achieves \nits minimum target of $150 million. \n \nPortfolio  diversification.  Since  2008,  ADB  has  added  to  its  portfolio  a  significant \n19. \nproportion  of  funds  managed  by  first-time  managers  and/or  focused  on  higher-risk  strategies. \nASEAF II\u2019s introduction into the portfolio will help to rebalance the overall risk profile with a more \nexperienced fund manager  and  lower-risk,  sector-agnostic strategy.  Additionally,  ASEAF  II  will \nprovide exposure to the high-growth markets of Southeast Asia, and will allow ADB to capitalize \non  the  attractive  macroeconomic fundamentals  of  the  region.  Lastly,  analysis  of the  ADB fund \nportfolio  has  demonstrated  that  financially  successful  funds  are  generally  funds  that  achieve \nhigher  development  impact.  Since  Aureos  funds  have  performed  better  than  average,  this \nimplies  that their  development  impact  is generally  robust,  and they  are  anticipated to  maintain \ntheir performance with ASEAF II.  \n \n\n\fIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nThe  impact  will  be  the  increased  availability  of  equity  financing  for  SMEs  in  ADB\u2019s \n20. \nSoutheast  Asian  developing  member  countries,  and  an  increased  contribution  of  SMEs  to \neconomic growth and employment in Southeast Asia.  \n \nThe  output  will  be  the  establishment  and  investment  of  ASEAF  II,  which  will  be \n21. \nconsidered  successful  if  ASEAF  II  achieves  its  minimum  target  size  and  deploys  its  capital \n5 years after initial closing. This output will expand the number of profitable, well-governed, and \nenvironmentally responsible investee companies and SMEs in the target region (outcome). The \nlogic of these links is further developed in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \nB. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nAlignment with Strategy 2020 \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Country Strategies \n\nTwo key drivers of change in ADB\u2019s Strategy 20202\n\nThe  proposed  investment  is  broadly  aligned  with  the  country  strategies,  which  target \n\n22. \n are private sector development and \noperations,  and  good  governance.  ADB  is  dedicated  to  expanding  its  work  with  the  private \nsector  to  generate  greater  economic  growth  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  and  to  deploy  business \nmanagement and technical expertise. Given ASEAF II\u2019s focus on investments into high-growth \nsectors  of  the  real  economy  across  countries  in  the  region,  this  investment  is  closely  aligned \nwith  this  objective.  Additionally,  because  ASEAF  II  will  sit  on  the  boards  of  its  portfolio \ncompanies  and  will  contribute  actively  to  their  governance,  an  investment  in  ASEAF  II  also \nsupports the goal of contributing to good governance in the region.  \n \n \n \n23. \nSME development as a strategic priority.  \n \nIndonesia,  Malaysia,  and  the  Philippines.  In  the  Brunei\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013\n24. \nPhilippines  East  ASEAN  Growth  Area  (EAGA)  Roadmap  to  Development,  subregional \ncooperation  measures  were  identified  to  narrow  the  development  gap  across  and  within  the \nEAGA  member  countries  through  increased  trade,  investment,  and  tourism.  One  primary \nstrategic  objective  articulated  is  to  \u201cpromote  intra-  and  extra-EAGA  trade,  investment  and \ntourism in selected priority sectors \u2026 with particular emphasis on SME development.\u201d3\n Among \nthe  measures  considered  are  (i)  advocacy  for  policies  favorable  to  business  development, \nparticularly for SMEs; and (ii) improvement of the competitiveness of EAGA SMEs in the global \nsupply chain.  \n \nThailand. The Greater Mekong Subregion Program (in which Thailand is a key member) \n25. \nemphasizes  SME  development  as  a  contributing \nto  well-integrated  economic \ndevelopment  in  the  subregion.  In  the  10-year  strategic  framework  for  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion for 2002\u20132012,4\n five development priorities were defined to help achieve its vision of \n                                                \n2   ADB.  2008.

Specific measures include capacity building \nfor SME entrepreneurs, and the development of products and services that could support those \nentrepreneurs in cross-border trade and investment activities. \n \n26. \nViet  Nam.  In  the  country  strategy  and  program  midterm  review  for  2007\u20132010  for \nViet Nam,  the  government  acknowledges  the  importance  of  the  private  sector,  particularly \nSMEs,  in  advancing  the  country\u2019s  development  objectives,  as  well  as  the  importance  of \nimproving  access  to  domestic  financing  for  SMEs.  5 Viet  Nam\u2019s  country  operations  business \nplan  for  2009\u20132011  addresses  some  of  the  regulatory  issues  related  to  SME  development  by \nprioritizing a second phase of its SME Development Program, through which policy reforms will \nbe  supported  to  (i) improve  the  investment  climate  by  strengthening  investor  protection, \nenhancing  the  environment  for  competition  and  innovation,  improving  the  regulatory  review \nprocess,  and  reducing  transaction  costs;  (ii)  improve  trade  policy  and  facilitation;  and \n(iii) improve  macroeconomic  stability  to  support  economic  diversification  and  higher  private \nsector growth. 6\n \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \n\ninvestment\u2019s  potential  environmental  and  social \n\nADB\u2019s investment in ASEAF II is classified as category FI under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \n27. \nStatement  (2009).  The \nimpacts,  risks \nassociated  with  ASEAF  II\u2019s  likely  future  portfolio,  and  its  commitment  and  capacity  for \nenvironmental management have been assessed. Areas where improvements are needed have \nbeen  identified,  and  effective  measures  to  address  them  and  ensure  compliance  with  the \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  have  been  laid  out  in  the  environmental  and  social  management \nsystem  (ESMS)  arrangement.  ASEAF  II  will  be  required  to  ensure  that  its  investments  are  in \ncompliance  with  applicable  national  laws  and  regulations,  apply  ADB\u2019s  prohibited  investment \nactivities list, and establish and maintain an appropriate ESMS to manage the impacts and risks \nadequately, all in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n28.  With respect to gender, ASEAF II will invest in SMEs that may be owned by women, and \nthe investments will facilitate the expansion of those businesses. With respect to job generation, \nwomen may be beneficiaries of the investments. ASEAF II\u2019s investments in SMEs are expected \nto  generate  increased  employment  opportunities.
