The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nKarachi Electric Supply Corporation Limited  \n\n2. \nKESC  is  an  integrated  electric  utility  supplying  power  under  a  monopoly  license  to  a \nservice area of some 6,000 square kilometers in and around Karachi, Pakistan\u2019s largest city and \nindustrial  and  commercial  center.  With  a  population  of  about  16  million  the  city  accounts  for \nabout 15% of Pakistan\u2019s gross domestic product. \n \n3. \nKESC was incorporated as a private limited company in 1913 and subsequently listed on \nthe  Karachi  Stock  Exchange.  In  1952,  the  Government  of  Pakistan  nationalized  KESC  by \nacquiring  a  majority  shareholding.  Over  several  decades,  KESC  has  faced  many  operational \nand financial challenges primarily due to inefficient public sector management (including by the \nmilitary)  and  lack  of  investment,  and  has  been  the  subject  of  numerous  restructuring  efforts, \nwhile remaining in public hands. \n \n4. \nIn 2003, the Government decided to privatize KESC through a transparent, competitive \nbidding  process,  which  was  supported  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  through  the \nEnergy Sector Restructuring Program.1 The privatization process was successfully concluded in \nDecember  2005  when  the  Government  transferred  73%  of  KESC\u2019s  shares  to  a  consortium  of \ninvestors  led  by  KES  Power  Limited  (KES  Power),  60%  owned  by  Al-Jomaih  Holding  (Al \nJomaih), a Saudi industrial group, and 40% by National Industries Holding, a subsidiary of one \nof the largest Kuwaiti industrial and financial conglomerates (together, the sponsors). \n \nThe  new  management  immediately  initiated  efforts  to  improve  the  most  critical  of \n5. \nKESC\u2019s  operations.  These \nin \nimmediate \napproximately  30  megawatts  (MW)  of  additional  generation  capacity  harnessed  through \nefficiency  gains  from  existing  generation  assets.  At  the  same  time,  management  formulated  a \nlong-term  strategy  to  turn  KESC  into  an  efficient,  reliable, customer-responsive,  and  profitable \nentity.  Nevertheless,  as  a  result  of  the  earlier  years  of  neglect  and  lack  of  investment  in \ngeneration and the transmission & distribution (T&D) network, KESC could not keep pace with \ngrowth  in  demand  (since  2000,  electricity  units  billed  have  increased  45%,  while  virtually  no \ninvestment has been made in the T&D network). Therefore, during the peak period of summer \n2006,  when  Karachi  experienced  particularly  extreme  climatic  conditions,  KESC  faced  a  high \ncapacity shortage and was unable to provide reliable electric supply to the city. For hours (and \neven  days,  especially  during  rains),  customers  suffered  blackouts,  sharp  voltage  fluctuations, \nand billing problems. In many cases the load-shedding schedule notified to customers was not \nfollowed.  As  a  result,  KESC  faced  severe  media  criticism  and  high  customer  dissatisfaction, \n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2000.

By  late  2006,  KESC\u2019s  new  turnaround  strategy  was  finalized,  and  is  now  being \nimplemented. It is supported by a program of investments (the investment plan) of some PRs52 \nbillion ($809 million) for FY2007\u2013FY2009, which includes the following main components: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\ngeneration  capacity  additions  of  780MW 2  in  two  new  combined-cycle  power \nplants on existing sites (PRs34 billion/$525 million), \nrehabilitation and improvement of the T&D network (PRs17 billion/$268 million), \nrehabilitation of existing generation facilities (PRs600 million/$10 million), and \nupgrading of commercial systems (PRs400 million/$6 million); \n\n \n7. \nThe  investment  plan  is  to  be  financed  through  shareholders\u2019  contributions,  internally \ngenerated  funds,  a  Government  investment  grant,  long-term  corporate  financing,  and  working \ncapital  facilities.  The  Government  has  asked  ADB  and  the  International  Finance  Corporation \n(IFC) to lead and participate in the long-term financing facility with ADB providing $150 million \nand  IFC  $125  million  (or  their  equivalent  in  local  currency).  Local  commercial  banks  have \ncommitted long term financing of some PRs12.5 billion/$195 million. \n \n8. \nADB and KESC have a long history of cooperation. Through its public sector program, \nADB financed six investment projects with the then state-owned KESC (Appendix 2 provides a \ndetailed description of ADB assistance to KESC). In December 2000, ADB approved the $355 \nmillion  Energy  Sector  Restructuring  Program,  which  set  out,  among  other  things, to  assist  the \nGovernment in privatizing KESC. Furthermore, as a result of close cooperation between ADB\u2019s \nCentral  and  West  Asia  Regional  Department  (CWRD)  and  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment  (PSOD),  the  prospect  of  ADB  providing  postprivatization  financing  to  KESC  has \nbeen  anticipated  for  several  years  (and  was  explicitly  set  out  in  the  privatization  sales \nmemorandum). \n \nThe  Project  received  concept  clearance  on  7  December  2006.  The  Private  Sector \n9. \nOperations  Department  carried  out  its  Due  Diligence  Mission  during  February  2007,  and  held \nseveral  negotiation  and  coordination  meetings  with  KESC  and  cofinanciers  during  January \nthrough March 2007. \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Power Subsector  \n\na. \n\nGrowing Demand-Supply Gap \n\n10. \nPer  capita  power  consumption  in  Pakistan  is  one  of  the  lowest  in  the  world  (413 \nkilowatt-hours (kWh) compared, for example, to the Philippines with 497 kWh and Thailand with \n1,414 kWh). Only 55% of Pakistan\u2019s population has access to electricity from the national grid. \nThe remaining 45% use kerosene, wood, and other biofuels for lighting, cooking, and heating. A \ngrowing  population  and  thriving  economy  means  that  demand  for  electricity  is  on  an  ever-\naccelerating  growth  trajectory.  Pakistan\u2019s  electricity  consumption  increased  at  a  compound \naverage  growth  rate  of 6.8%  from  2001  to  2006,  with  faster  rates  of  growth  registered  among \ncertain  key  (for  a  city  such  as  Karachi)  classes  of  users,  e.g.,  residential,  commercial,  and \n\n                                                 \n2   Rated capacity. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n  \n\nindustrial. Average electricity demand growth for Pakistan has already reached, and is forecast \nto  continue  at,  approximately  8.3%  per  annum  (for  2005\u20132015),  exceeding  recent  economic \ngrowth  rates  of  about  6%.  WAPDA 3 and  KESC  collectively  registered  unit  sales  growth  of \n10.23% in FY2006. Continued strong economic growth is expected to  contribute to higher per \nannum  per  capita  consumption  of  electricity,  which  will  increase  overall  demand  growth \n(Appendix 3 provides details on the power subsector).  \n \n11. \nAt  present,  the  total  installed  power  generating  capacity  in  Pakistan  is  19,252  MW,  of \nwhich  some  15,072  MW  represents  firm  supply.  To  cope  with  expected  growth  in  electricity \ndemand, Pakistan is expected to require about 2,000 MW of new capacity each year to avoid \npower  shortages  that  could  otherwise  amount  to  as  much  as  15%  within  2  years.

According  to  KESC,  demand  for  power  in  the  Karachi  area  has  been \ngrowing at approximately 7%\u20138% per annum over the last few years. This trend is expected to \ncontinue  for  the  foreseeable  future  as  industrial  activity  continues  to  increase  in  tandem  with \nPakistan\u2019s  sustained  economic  growth.  KESC  estimates  peak  plus  latent  demand  for  the \nKarachi  area  of  2,442  MW,  some  16%  of  total  electricity  demand  in  Pakistan4 (Appendix  4 \nprovides details on Karachi\u2019s power subsector).  \n \nIn  addition  to  KESC-supplied  electricity  (KESC\u2019s  own  generation  capacity,  as  well  as \n13. \nelectricity procured by KESC from the National Transmission and Dispatch Corporation [NTDC], \nindependent power producers [IPPs], and other large electricity producers), the power needs of \nKarachi are currently met by self-generation (for example, small to large diesel generation sets). \nMost  industries  have  significant  generation  capacity  of  their  own  and  non-KESC-generated \npower  supply  in  Karachi  is  estimated  to  account  for  200  MW,  or  12.5%  of  total  electricity \navailable to the city and its surroundings. \n \nInterruptions in service, especially unscheduled outages, have occasionally become the \n14. \nsubject  of  public  protest.  Thus,  KESC\u2019s  operating  performance,  in  addition  to  its  impact  on \neconomic  development  in  Karachi  and  Pakistan,  is  of  significant  political  importance.  Not  only \n\n                                                 \n3   WAPDA  supplies  electricity  to  the  National  Transmission  and  Despatch  Corporation  for  distribution  to  the  rest  of \n\nPakistan excluding KESC\u2019s franchise area. \n\n4   Other studies indicate a total (peak + latent) demand of some 3,200 MW. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nshareholders, management, and consumers, but also the national and city governments have a \nvery clear interest in ensuring that KESC succeeds with its turnaround strategy. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nDemand-Supply Gap \n\n15. \nAs  the  single  power  utility  for  Karachi,  KESC  is  expected  to  provide  24-hour  per  day \npower  supply  while  maintaining  high  standards  of  quality,  efficiency,  reliability,  and  safety, \nwhether in peak season or not. The ability to meet demand is essentially impacted by two main \nfactors: (i) access to sufficient electricity generation (within the capacity of the current network \u2500 \n\u201cgrid\u201d demand \u2500 and considering latent demand that will become evident as additional supply is \nmade available), and (ii) having a sufficiently large and reliable network to handle the required \nsupply. KESC\u2019s past demand-supply gap is set out in Table 2: \n \n\nTable 2: KESC Power Demand and Supply Gap for 2001\u20132006  \n(megawatt) \n \n2002 \n\n2001 \n\n2004 \n\n2003 \n\n2005 \n\nItem \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKESC Self-Generation \n\nWAPDA/NTDC \n\nIPPs \n\n859 \n\n203 \n\n210 \n\n939 \n\n149 \n\n230 \n\n949 \n\n1,042 \n\n202 \n\n223 \n\n205 \n\n201 \n\n992 \n\n277 \n\n206 \n\nTotal Supply \n\n1,272 \n\n1,318 \n\n1,374 \n\n1,448 \n\n1,475 \n\n1,600 \n\nTotal Grid Demand  \n\n1,807 \n\n1,916 \n\n2,031 \n\n2,153 \n\n2,282 \n\n2,442 \n\nTotal Latent Demand \n\n39 \n\n61 \n\n95 \n\n161 \n\n201 \n\n222 \n\nTotal Demand \n\n1,846 \n\n1,977 \n\n2,126 \n\n2,314 \n\n2,483 \n\n2,664 \n\n2006 \n\n \n\n964 \n\n436 \n\n200 \n\n574 \n\n752 \n\nUnmet Demand \n\n659 \nE  =  estimated,  IPP  =  independent  power  producer,  KESC  =  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Corporation  Limited,  MW  = \nmegawatt,  NTDC  =  National  Transmission  and  Dispatch  Corporation,  WAPDA  =  Water  and  Power  Development \nAuthority. \nSource: Karachi Electric Supply Corporation Limited, March 2007. \n \n16. \nlast  5  years  \n(Table 2). While grid demand will be substantially met in FY2007, latent demand increases will \nresult in a growing gap. \n \n\nincreasing  demand-supply  gap  over \n\nKESC  has \n\nfaced  an \n\n1,008 \n\n1,064 \n\nthe \n\n866 \n\na. \n\nPower Supply \n\nKESC holds a license to generate electricity, and purchases externally generated power \n\n17. \nfrom NTDC/WAPDA and IPPs. \n \nExternal  Power. External power purchases account for approximately 40% of capacity \n18. \navailable for supply by KESC: 27% from WAPDA/NTDC and 13% from other sources. However, \ngiven the demand-supply gap in Pakistan as a  whole, WAPDA/NTDC is currently under equal \npressure  to supply  electricity  to  the  rest  of  the  country  and  future  supply  is  not  certain.5 While \n\n                                                 \n5   The  WAPDA  successor  distribution  companies\u2014in  the  process  of  being  privatized\u2014have  formalized  power \npurchases  under  power  purchase  agreements  with  WAPDA/NTDC,  which  have  to  be  honored.

KESC has not increased its in-house generation capacity since 1998. \nDue  to  the  poor  maintenance  and  obsolescence  of  the  existing  plants  (the  oldest  plant  still  in \noperation was installed in 1965), KESC\u2019s generation capacity (i) has been derated by 420 MW \n(24%),  and  (ii)  is  only  25%  efficient  (with  economic  and  environmental  consequences).  As  a \nresult, at privatization in late 2005, only 1,336 MW of capacity was available for dispatch. \n \n\nb. \n\nNetwork Capacity and Reliability  \n\n20. \nGiven  the  surging  power  demand,  the  network  needs  continuing  investment.  Over  the \npast 6 years, peak demand has increased by some 25% and units billed have increased by 41%. \nHowever,  transmission  capacity  has  not  increased  at  anywhere  close  to  these  rates.  For \nexample,  against  a  total  requirement  of  12  new  grid  stations,  only  3  were  added  during  that \nperiod. In addition to overloading, the network has suffered from poor maintenance (e.g., lack of \ncable protection leading to feeder tripping) and unplanned network expansion (with no plans for \ncontingent supply in case of failure). A review of the distribution network conducted by the new \nmanagement revealed an enormous number of rundown parts in need of replacement.6 \n \nKESC\u2019s  distribution  license  is  contingent  on  meeting  a  number  of  service  standards \n21. \nstipulated  by  the  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory  Authority  (NEPRA).  The  performance \nstandards are detailed and clear financial penalties are set for noncompliance. Currently, KESC \nhas  a  high  number  of  service  interruptions  and  will  not  be  able  to  meet  the  performance \nstandards; it is operating under a compliance waiver.  \n \n\n2. \n\nNetwork Efficiency \n\nThe  other  key  performance  indicator  is  KESC\u2019s  ability  to  utilize  the  capacity  and \n22. \nreliability of the network to maximize the delivery of electricity as well as collection of revenues \n(based  on  established  tariffs)  earned  for  units  delivered.  KESC\u2019s  T&D  losses  have  increased \nfrom 18% in FY1987, via peaks of 41% in FY2002 and FY2003, to some 35% in 2006 (Table 3). \nThis  was  as  a  result  of  underinvestment  in  the  network,  and  poor  management  systems  and \ncontrols. Nontechnical losses represent approximately half  of the of total T&D losses, and are \ndue  mainly  to  outright  power  theft  (e.g.,  illegal  connections,  meter  tampering,  etc.),  billing \ndiscrepancies, and nonpayment of amounts billed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \npresently  have  a  formal  power  purchase  agreement  with  WAPDA/NTDC.  It  instead  relies  on  preprivatization \narrangements  of  power  allocation  from  WAPDA/NTDC.  In  case  of  emergency  situations  (where  KESC  demand \nexceeds its own and external supply from IPPs), such as the one witnessed in the summer of 2006, the Economic \nCoordination  Council  directs  the  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power  to  provide  surplus  electricity  to  KESC  through \nWAPDA/NTDC. \n\n6   For  example,  the  majority  of  KESC\u2019s  11  kilovolt  underground  feeders  are  made  of  paper-insulated,  lead-covered \ncables, a technology that dates back to the late 1940s before nationalization. As these cables have aged, KESC \nhas faced an increasing array of problems. In the recent monsoon rains of late July to August 2006, parts of the \ncity  remained  flooded  for  days,  which  resulted  in  failure  of  cable  splices  resulting  in  a  cascade  of  faults  and \nblackouts, as well as a small number of fatalities due to contact with conducting pools of water. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3: Network Losses FY2003\u2013FY2006) \n(%) \n\nItem \nTransmission \nDistribution\u2014Technical \nDistribution\u2013Nontechnical\nTotal Loss \nE = estimated, FY = fiscal year. \nSource: Karachi Electric Supply Corporation Limited. 2007. \n\n2003 2004 2005\n5.2 \n5.8\n17.2  15.0 \n14.8  14.0 \n37.8  34.2 \n\n6.0\n17.5\n17.3\n40.8\n\n2006 \n5.2 \n14.8 \n15.0 \n35.0 \n\n3. \n\nSubsidy Dependence/Sustainability without Government Subsidies \n\n23. \nAnother key measure of privatization and turnaround success would be KESC\u2019s financial \nsustainability  (i.e.,  positive  cash  flow  from  operations  or  earnings  before  interest,  taxes, \ndepreciation,  and  amortization  (EBITDA)  without  further  government  subsidies.  In  the  last  4 \nfiscal  years,  the  Government  has  provided  subsidies  to  KESC  of  between  PRs6  billion  and \nPRs11 billion (approximately $90 million to $180 million) per year. Certain subsidies (in various \nforms) continue postprivatization as a function of, for example, (i) transition arrangements under \nthe privatization implementation agreement, and (ii) the Government\u2019s tariff policy. \n \n24. \nTo provide potential investors in KESC\u2019s privatization bidding process with clarity on one \nof  the  most  important  external  factors  affecting  the  earnings  of  KESC,  NEPRA  approved  a \nmultiyear cost-plus-based tariff (with a claw-back mechanism for reduced consumer tariffs in the \ncase of excess returns) for KESC. This tariff structure is valid for 7 years after privatization. The \nintention  was  that  this  tariff  would  be  charged  to  consumers.  The  Government,  however,  has \nuntil  recently  opted  to  block  any  increases  in  consumer  tariffs,  and  has  instead  chosen  to \nreimburse  or  subsidize  KESC  the  difference  between  the  NEPRA-notified  tariff  and  the \nunchanged consumer tariff. This has resulted in a projection of increasing amounts of subsidies \nfrom the Government to KESC. \n \nHowever, a recent7 policy decision to increase consumer electricity tariffs in Pakistan by \n25. \n10% can be seen as a commitment by the Government to minimizing subsidies and rationalizing \nthe power subsector. \n \n26. \nEven with the subsidies, KESC is currently loss-making (Appendix 7 provides historical \nfinancial statements). Unusually, it even has a negative gross margin due to its inability to fully \nbill  and  collect  revenue  for  electricity  units  generated  (this  also  impacts  operating  profit  by \nincreasing bad debt expense provisioning). In FY2006, after receipt of the tariff subsidy, KESC \nincurred  net  cash  outlays  for  operations  of  PRs3.5  billion  ($59  million)  and  EBITDA  was  a \nnegative PRs11.5 billion ($192 million). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n7   February 2007. \n\n\f \n\nItem \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n  \n\nTable 4: Selected Historical Highlights, FY2002\u2013FY2006 \n(PRs million unless specified) \n\nFY2002\n\nFY2003\n\nFY2006\n\n8,709\n6,717\n31,047\n32,463\n0\n3,629\n1,071\n(17,562)\n\nUnits generated (million kWh) \nUnits sold (million kWh) \nTotal revenue \nTotal cost of fuel + power purchased \nLess: tariff adjustment \nOperation and maintenance cost \nProvision for doubtful debts \nNet operating loss  \nFrom the Government under the \nimplementation agreement \nOther subsidies from the Government \nLoss before tax \nNet tax \n(Loss)/profit after taxation \n \n( ) = negative, kWh = kilowatt-hour, PRs = Pakistan rupees. \nSource: Karachi Electric Supply Corporation Limited. \n\n0\n0\n(17,562)\n(154)\n(17,716)\n\n8,908\n7,041\n33,578\n36,633\n0\n3,536\n2,008\n(13,894)\n\n0\n5,751\n(8,143)\n(168)\n(8,311)\n\n \n\n4. \n\nADB Operations  \n\na. \n\nAssistance to the Power Subsector  \n\nFY2004\n \n9,274 \n7,912 \n37,856 \n35,712 \n0 \n3,835 \n2,249 \n(8,299) \n\nFY2005\n \n9,304 \n8,505 \n39,816 \n40,792 \n(1,491) \n4,710 \n2,308 \n(10,376) \n\n0 \n9,572 \n1,273 \n(187) \n1,086 \n \n\n0 \n10,896 \n520 \n(199) \n321 \n \n\n9,130\n9,060\n43,861\n53,208\n(9,482)\n7,351\n3,329\n(14,630)\n\n7,576\n0\n(7,054)\n(137)\n(7,191)\n\n27. \nADB is the major source of external assistance to the energy sector in Pakistan, having \nprovided  about  one  third  of  total  external  financial  resources.  WAPDA  has  been  the  largest \nrecipient  of  ADB\u2019s  power  financing,  receiving  $1,575  million  in  13  loans.  The  balance  of  the \npower financing has been for KESC, primarily for generation expansion projects and to a lesser \ndegree  for  T&D  upgrades,  as  well  as  for  privatization.  ADB\u2019s  nonlending  activities  have  also \nbeen important with a total of $14.2 million for 27 technical assistance (TA) projects. The main \nsubjects  of  the  TAs  include  tariff  rationalization  and  integration,  management  information \nsystems,  power  generation  coordination,  thermal  power  plant  maintenance,  institutional \nstrengthening and restructuring, and privatization. ADB has worked closely with the Government \non  a  road  map  for  change  in  the  power  subsector  and,  based  on  its  results,  ADB\u2019s  indicative \npublic  sector  program  for  power  could  reach  $1.5  billion  during  2006\u20132009  (Appendix  6 \npresents details of ADB lending and nonlending in the power subsector). \n \n\nb. \n\nSector Approach \n\nThe  energy  sector  is  a  core  operation  sector  under  ADB\u2019s  Medium-Term  Strategy  2.8 \n28. \nCatalyzing  investments  through  increased  private  sector  participation  in  ADB\u2019s  developing \nmember countries is identified as one of the five strategic priorities. \n \nADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy9 designates  the  following  as  two  of  the  most  important \n29. \namong  several  operational  priorities:  (i)  reducing  poverty  by,  among  others,  creating  energy \ninfrastructure for sustainable economic growth; and (ii) promoting private sector involvement by \nrestructuring  the  energy  sector  and  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  private  investors.  In \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB. 2006. Medium-Term Strategy II (2006\u20132008). Manila.  \n9   ADB. 2000. Energy 2000: Review of the Energy Sector Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nparticular,  the  strategy  strongly  encourages  ADB  interventions  to  increase  private  sector \nparticipation in the energy sector to take advantage of higher operating efficiencies that private \noperators can achieve and to meet the large capital requirements. \n \n\nc. \n\nPrivate Sector Operations in Energy and Power  \n\n30. \nPSOD has also been closely involved in energy and power in Pakistan, with loans and \ninvestments  to  Fauji  Oil  Terminal  Company,  an  oil  terminal  with  handling  capacity  of  over  10 \nmillion  tons  of  fuel  oil  and  high-speed  diesel;  Kabirwala  Power  Company,  a  151MW  gas-fired \ncombined-cycle power plant and one of the first IPPs under the 1994 Power Policy; and most \nrecently,  the  New  Bong  Escape  Project,  an  84  MW  run-of-river  hydropower  plant  and  the  first \nhydro  IPP  in  Pakistan  under  the  1995  Hydropower  Policy  (Appendix  5).  ADB  has  also \nanticipated  the  sector  privatization  efforts  and  KESC\u2019s  privatization  memorandum  mentioned \nADB\u2019s  potential  interest  in  supporting  the  winning  bidder  with  investment  funding.  Support  for \nenergy-related  projects  is  envisaged  as  a  key  component  of  ADB\u2019s  Pakistan  private  sector \noperations strategy. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n  \n\nThe outcome of the Project will be that satisfied consumers of electricity in Karachi have \n31. \naccess  to  reliable  electricity  supply  of  power  at  reasonable  cost  from  a  financially  sustainable \nKESC  which  is  able  to  create  value  for  its  stakeholders.  These  benefits  will  accrue  to  the  16 \nmillion  inhabitants  (about  10%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  population)  of  Karachi,  Pakistan\u2019s  largest \ncity  and  industrial  core,  accounting  for  more  than  15%  of  national  gross  domestic  product. \nSpecifically, the Project will undertake the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nAddress an immediate energy crisis in Karachi and help address a growing \nenergy  deficit  in  Pakistan.  The  new  investment  will  increase  net  electricity \ngeneration by over 750 MW and will greatly improve the T&D network leading to \nrapidly  reducing  system  losses,  to  meet  ill-serviced  current  demand  and  will \nestablish  the  basis  for  addressing  the  future  needs  of  a  city  whose  energy \ndemands are increasing by more than 8% a year. \n \nIntroduce  greater  efficiency  into  one  of  Pakistan\u2019s  largest  and  least \nefficient power utilities. With the proposed rehabilitation and upgrade, KESC is \naiming  to  reduce  energy  losses  from  the  more  than  the  current,  unacceptably \nhigh,  34%,  and  to  install  new,  efficient  generation  plants.  These  measures  will \nlead  to  significantly  greater  energy  efficiency  with  financial,  economic,  and \nenvironmental benefits. \n \nSupport  private  sector  development.  As  one  of \nlarge-scale \ninfrastructure privatizations in Pakistan, the success or failure of KESC will have \nmajor  implications  for  future  privatizations.  Success  should  help  revive/sustain \nthe political and public will for further large-scale privatization. \n\nfirst \n\nthe \n\n \nB. \n\nThe Turnaround Strategy \n\nThe  Project  is  to  finance  KESC\u2019s  turnaround  strategy,  which  is  designed  to  lead  to \n32. \nimmediate improvements in KESC\u2019s key performance indicators and cash flow. The new KESC \nmanagement  and  Siemens  developed  the  strategy  after  a  thorough  12-month  analysis.  A \ntechnical  committee  of  the  board  of  directors,  headed  by  a  Government  board  representative \nfrom the Ministry of Water and Power, vetted the proposed investments. \n \n33. \n \n\nThe turnaround strategy is based on three core initiatives: \n\nOrganizational  restructuring  and  development,  to  make  the  operations  more \ncustomer-focused while improving collections and administrative losses, will lead \nto better revenue protection and cash-flow generation, while enhancing KESC\u2019s \nmanagement capabilities and increasing customer satisfaction. \nBalancing,  modernizing,  and  replacing  the  T&D  network  will  allow  KESC  to  be \nable to cater for peak capacity demand in the future, and reduce technical losses, \nwhich will lead to lower energy losses and higher billing per units dispatched. \nIncreasing and improving KESC\u2019s generation capacity will increase the revenue \nbase, diversify sources of power for KESC, lower the blended cost of generation, \nand  enhance  the  Karachi  area\u2019s  overall  generation  capacity,  to  cater  for \nincreasing demand. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nC. \n\nSponsors and Management \n\n34. \nThe  sponsors  are  fully  committed  to  success  in  the  turnaround  of  KESC.  Their \nexperience  in  a  variety  of  industries  across  the  Middle  East,  and  corresponding  financial \nstrength, meant that the sponsors were acceptable to the Government as a partner in managing \nthe turnaround of a massively important, but failing, state entity (Appendix 8 provides details on \nthe  shareholders  and  shareholdings).  Siemens  AG  was  appointed  as  a  general  management \ncontractor for KESC under an operation and maintenance (O&M) contract structure.10 \n \n35. \nThe  sponsors  have  recruited  a  team  of  professionals  to  manage  the  commercial \nturnaround,  and  maintain  close  monitoring  and  direction  via  the  chairman  of  the  executive \ncommittee  of  the  board  (who  is  based  at  KESC\u2019s  head  office),  and  have  already  taken \nmeasures to improve performance by replacing the first postprivatization chief executive officer \nwith the experienced and well-respected Syed Mohammad Amjad, a former managing director \nof the Fauji Foundation, the largest industrial conglomerate in Pakistan, and an ADB partner in \nseveral successful projects. The chief operating officer is a senior Siemens secondee, with 25 \nyears  of  power  generation,  transmission,  and  process  automation  experience  in  Pakistan  and \ninternationally  including  Germany.  The  chief  financial  officer  has  more  than  25  years  of \nprofessional experience in financial control, project investment, and general management from \nmajor multinational companies and audit firms in the Canada, Middle East, Pakistan, and United \nKingdom (Appendix 8 includes an organization chart and curricula vitae of key executives). \n \n36. \nSiemens has a 15\u201320 member team, comprised mainly of Pakistani staff, fully integrated \ninto management positions alongside company staff. To avoid potential conflicts of interest and \nimprove  KESC\u2019s  procurement  processes,  KESC  set  up  the  Supply  Chain/Procurement \nCommittee comprised of four board members (none are Siemens staff) to review procurement \ndecisions.  \n \nThe  new  management  has  already  made  progress  in  the  following  key  areas:  (i)  new \n37. \nmanagement information systems are being introduced and should be fully operational by mid-\n2007; (ii) all meter reading is now based on handheld devices, and 6,000 industrial customers \nare serviced by meters that automatically send metering information to central collection points \nvia  the  cellular  phone  network;  (iii)  new  network  management  and  analysis  tools  have  been \nimplemented;  (iv)  70,000  new  connections  have  been  made;  (v)  30  MW  of  lost  generation \ncapacity  has  been  recovered;  (vi)  bill  collection  rates  have  improved;  and  (vii)  estimated  (as \nopposed to metered) billing has been reduced . \n \nD. \n\nThe Investment Plan \n\nThe investment plan includes expanding generation, investing in the T&D network, and \n\n38. \nupgrading commercial systems.  \n \n\n1. \n\nGeneration Expansion \n\na. \n\nRehabilitation of Existing Generation Facilities  \n\n39. \nDue  to  lack  of  maintenance  and  upgrading  over  many  years,  the  total  installed \nnameplate generation of 1,756 MW has declined to 1,336 MW of currently dependable capacity. \n\n                                                 \n11 KESC\u2019s \n\ntwo  assessment \n\nhttp://www.kesc.com.pk/project-disclosure.html \n\nreports  were  disclosed  on  2  February  2007  and  are  available  at      \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n11\n\n  \n\nIn  2006  the  average  load  factor,  i.e.,  the  percent  of  total  capacity  utilization  actually  achieved \n(out  of  dependable  capacity)  was  a  low  71%,  implying  a  net  generation  of  only  949  MW.  The \nrehabilitation program aims to increase power generation capacity from existing plants by some \n220  MW  before  the  summer  of  2007.  Key  areas  for  improvement  are  heat  rate,  auxiliary \nconsumption,  and  load  factor.  Since  privatization,  KESC  has  already  spent  about  PRs300 \nmillion  ($5  million)  on  upgrading  generation,  which  has  resulted  in  an  increase  in  total \ngeneration of approximately 30 MW. \n \n\nb. \n\nGeneration Capacity Addition \n\n40. \nIn  addition  to  upgrading  existing  capacity,  the  investment  plan  envisages  power \ngeneration  capacity  addition  in  two  phases  from  two  new  plants  at  existing  plant  sites.  Phase \none  encompasses  a  220  MW  combined-cycle,  dual  gas/furnace  oil  plant  to  be  constructed  on \nsurplus land within the boundaries of KESC\u2019s existing Korangi Thermal Power Station site, with \nthe first of four gas turbines to be operational by August 2007. The second phase expansion is a \n560 MW combined-cycle, dual-fuel plant on surplus land within the boundaries of BQTPS, with \nthe  first  of  three  gas  turbines  operational  by  July  2008,  and  full  commissioning  by  November \n2009. \n \n\n2. \n\nT&D Network Investment \n\n41. \nThis  investment  will  help  ensure  reliability,  provide  enhanced  capacity utilization,  serve \nas  the  platform  for  growth,  and  introduce  state-of-the-art  planning  software  to  manage  the \nnetwork.  Since  the  privatization  in  November  2005  up  to  June  2006,  KESC  has  invested  an \nadditional  PRs2.2  billion  ($37  million)  on  T&D  upgrades.  This  has  improved  network  reliability \nand  reduced  technical  losses  by  about  2%.  Transmission  capacity  has  increased  by  300 \nmegavolt amperes and distribution capacity by 115 MW. \n \nLoss-reduction  will  not  only  help  add  reliability  to  the  system,  due  to  less  frequent \n42. \noutages,  but  will  also  reduce  KESC\u2019s  supply  requirements,  thereby  improving  its  operating \nmargins as well as energy efficiency.  A more reliable T&D network should ensure that KESC \nwill be able to meet its service standards.  \n \n\n3. \n\nUpgrading of Commercial Systems \n\n43. \nInvestments in the commercial organization entail introducing high quality management \nsystems,  upgrading  commercial  information  technology  infrastructure  (previously  only  a  few \nstand-alone  personal  computers  were  used),  supporting  reorganization  and  training,  hiring \nbetter  qualified  staff,  improving  customer  service  centers,  and  improving  the  image  of  KESC \nthrough a sustained public relations campaign. \n \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nCorporate Governance, Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n44. \nAs  a  publicly  listed  company  regulated  by  the  Securities  Exchange  Commission  of \nPakistan,  KESC  complies  with  the  Karachi  Stock  Exchange\u2019s  listing  regulations,  including  its \nreporting  requirements,  and  with  the  code  of  corporate  governance  contained  in  the  Listing \nRegulations of the Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad Stock Exchanges. KESC\u2019s annual accounts \nare audited by Ford Rhodes Sidat Hyder & Company, a local affiliate of Ernst & Young.  \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n45.  KESC will provide comprehensive annual and quarterly reports, detailing, for example, (i) \nprogress  in  project  implementation,  (ii)  operating  cost  structure  and  performance,  and  (iii) \ncompliance  with  financial  covenants.  The  lenders  will  monitor  KESC\u2019s  progress  vis-\u00e0-vis  its \nbusiness  plan,  annual  budgets,  and  financial  model.  The  Project  will  be  evaluated  on  three \nlevels: (i) the success of the Project itself, (ii) development of the power sector in general, and \n(iii) private sector development. Appendix 1 provides the relevant performance indicators. \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Review \n\n46. \nThe  Project  will  be  reviewed  regularly  as  per  standard  ADB  portfolio  management  and \nproject  evaluation  practice,  including  a  project  completion  report  (following  project  completion \nenvisaged in FY2009) and annual reviews. \n \n\n4. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Safeguard Policy Aspects \n\nKESC has undertaken a social and environmental impact assessment11 for each of the \n47. \npower  plants  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  (BQTPS  and  Korangi  Thermal  Power  Station). \nThe  initial  environment  examination  report  prepared  on  the  basis  of  the  findings  of  the  two \nassessment  reports  concludes  that  the  Project  is  unlikely  to  cause  adverse  significant \nenvironmental or social impacts. Hence, the Project is categorized as B, consistent with the IFC \nclassification. \n \nAn  environment  management  plan  was  prepared  to  ensure  that  environmental \n48. \ndisturbances  associated  with  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  Project  will  be  handled \nconsistent  with  ADB  environmental  guidelines.  KESC  has  also  agreed  to  implement  an  action \nplan  to  ensure  that  the  Project  remains  in  compliance  with  IFC  performance  standards.  ADB \nhas incorporated adherence to the action plan in its loan covenants. ADB will post the summary \ninitial  environment  examination  on  its  website.  The  Project  is  expected  to  improve  KESC\u2019s \nenvironmental, health and safety, and social performance. The gas-fired combined-cycle power \ngeneration  units  are  cleaner  and  more  energy  efficient  than  KESC's  existing  thermal  power \ngeneration plants, and are expected to improve corporate environmental performance.  \n \n49. \nThe plant expansions are planned to be developed within the boundaries of the existing \nthermal power stations, and therefore, no additional land acquisition is required. No outstanding \nclaims  on  the  land  have  been  made.  The  cumulative  thermal  discharges  of  the  capacity \nexpansion at Korangi Thermal Power Station and BQTPS will have no impact on incomes from \nfisheries in the vicinity of the plants; no fishing activity is carried out in the immediate vicinity and \nimpact  area  of  either  plant.  Accordingly  the  Project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  involuntary \nresettlement. No indigenous people were identified within the project-affected communities, and \ntherefore the Project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nNature and Amount \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n13\n\n  \n\nFollowing  the  postprivatization  ownership  and  management  change,  KESC  has  asked \n50. \nADB to take a leading role in funding KESC\u2019s turnaround strategy. This is seen by KESC, the \nGovernment,  and  the  market  as  a  natural  continuation  of  ADB\u2019s  preprivatization  support  for \nKESC\u2019s  transition  from  a  state-owned  enterprise  to  a  private  sector  company.  ADB  has  been \nasked  to  provide  $150,000,000  (or  equivalent  in  Pakistan  rupees)  in  the  form  of  a  senior \ncorporate  loanThe  ADB  loan  will  be  documented  by  a  loan  agreement,  which  will  contain \nstandard  terms,  conditions,  and  covenants  that  apply  to  loans  to  private  sector  borrowers \nwithout government guarantees.  \n \nB. \n\nJustification and Risks \n\n1. \n\nJustification \n\na. \n\nThe Project is Consistent with ADB Strategies \n\nit \n\nin \n\nto \n\nthe  high  priority  attached \n\n51. \nThe  proposed  assistance  to  KESC  is  fully  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  and  sector \nstrategies, as well as the Government\u2019s strategic intentions. ADB\u2019s most recent country strategy \nand program update reports that \u201cADB  views itself as one of Pakistan\u2019s strategic development \npartners  for  infrastructure  development,\u201d  with power  as  one  of  the  main  areas  of  support,  and \nthat \u201cthe emphasis on lending for economic infrastructure will be continued, which is consistent \nthe  Government\u2019s  medium-term  development \nwith \nframework.\u201d12 The report clearly mandates ADB to promote, via investments and loans, the role \nof  the  private  sector  as  a  driver  of  investment,  growth,  and  employment.  Among  ADB\u2019s  focus \nsectors for private sector operations, power and energy infrastructure feature prominently. \n \n52. \nAs part of its public sector program, ADB has a strong energy sector focus in Pakistan. \nWork on the enabling environment, reform, and regulations have created the right conditions for \nfurther  public  sector  investment  as  well  as  increased  private  sector  participation.  In  the  short \nterm,  ADB  is  helping  the  Government  conduct  energy  sector  analyses;  capacity  building;  and \nproject  identification,  development,  and  implementation.  Over  the  medium  term,  ADB  is \nsupporting  larger  infrastructure  development  projects  in  renewable  energy,  and  in  power \ntransmission and distribution. \n \n53. \nADB (through PSOD) is also fully engaged with the private power subsector in Pakistan, \nthrough  loans  and  investments  made  since  1996.  ADB  is  currently  considering  several  other \npower financing opportunities in Pakistan. \n \n\nb. \n\nADB Adds Value to the Project and the Impacts \n\n54. \nCatalytic  Effect.  ADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  financing  strongly  encourages  other \nfinanciers for a number of reasons, not least the perception that an ADB-financed project faces \nreduced  regulatory  risk.  Cofinanciers  typically  view  ADB\u2019s  multilateral  status  as  a  deterrent  to \ngovernments  (or  regulators)  to  alter  contract  structures  or  other  aspects  of  arrangements  for \ncompanies  that  are  dependent  on  exclusive  licensing  (such  as  infrastructure  concessions  and \npublic-private partnerships). Given actions taken by the Government in the power subsector in \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2005. Pakistan: Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008). Manila. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nthe  late  1990s,  this  perceived  reduction  in  regulatory  risk  is  much  in  demand  by  commercial \nlenders. The participation of ADB in the financing has also encouraged local lenders to extend \nthe term of financing that they would otherwise have been prepared to consider. \n \nThe demonstration effect from successfully executed power subsector financing is also \n55. \nlikely  to  lead  to  increased  (currently  limited)  interest  from  international  commercial  lenders  for \nloans  and  investments  in  power  (and  for  privatized  companies  in  Pakistan  generally),  to \ncomplement increasingly constrained domestic liquidity.  \n \n56. \nPrivatization  Program  Demonstration  Effect.  ADB\u2019s  participation  will  also  add  value \nthrough the continuation of ADB\u2019s longstanding commitment to the successful privatization and \nturnaround  of  KESC  in  this  example  of  seamless  interface  between  the  operations  of  CWRD \nand PSOD, and by demonstrating to the Government (and other governments), that large-scale \nmegacity utility privatizations can be successfully structured from the planning stage to a stage \nwhere  operations  are  private  sector-led  and  sustainably  financed.  Recently,  Prime  Minister \nShaukat Aziz termed the successful privatization of KESC \u201ca good sign for the economy that will \npave  the  way  for  the  privatization  of  other  state-owned  units  that  has  been  pending  for  many \nyears\u201d.13 The ADB loan can thus help to ensure a successful outcome at the enterprise, industry, \nand policy levels. \n \nTaking  the  lead  among  the  lenders  on  this  landmark  postprivatization  financing  is  a \n57. \nnatural role for ADB. In fact, if ADB does not rise to the opportunity and challenge of supporting \nKESC  in  this  critical  postprivatization  phase,  this  may  be  badly  received  by  the  market, \ncofinanciers, and the Government; and could quite possibly put in question ADB\u2019s commitment \nto energy sector reform and private sector development in Pakistan. \n \nC. \n\nCompliance with Investment Limitations \n\nThe  proposed  ADB  loan  would  be  ADB\u2019s  seventh  currently  outstanding  private  sector \n58. \nloan  or  investment  in  Pakistan,  represent  5.48%  of  ADB\u2019s  total  private  sector  exposure,  and \nincrease the share of ADB\u2019s private sector exposure (i) in Pakistan from 0.82% to 6.26%, (ii) in \nthe  power  subsector  from  41.07%  to  44.30%,  and  (iii)  in  the  T&D  subsector  from  5.83%  to \n11.00%. The proposed investment complies with ADB\u2019s country and industry exposure limits. \n \n59. \n\nThe proposed ADB loan is in compliance with ADB\u2019s single and group exposure limits.  \n \nAny exposure by ADB in respect of its equity investment in KESC under the subscription \n60. \nright at the time of ADB\u2019s commitment to invest will not exceed the lower of $75 million and 25% \nof the aggregate issued share capital of KESC. \n \nD. \n\nAnticorruption Measures  \n\n61. \nKESC  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and \npolicy  relating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire KESC to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. Such obligations will be contained in the ADB loan documentation. \n\n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2005. ADB News from Pakistan, January-March 2005.

By the time of its privatization in late 2005, KESC \nhad  received  a  total  of  six  sector  loans  from  ADB  (the  last  one  being  the  6th  Power  (Sector) \nProject)  for  approximately  $350  million  (Appendix  3).  Nonfinancial  assistance  was  provided \nthrough technical assistance (five for a total of $ 1.7 million).  \n \n2. \nThe  assistance  came  in  two  main  phases.  During  the  first  (1972\u20131986),  ADB  mainly \nassisted  KESC  with  generation  projects  including  facilities  at  Korangi  Thermal  Power  Station, \nBin Qasim Thermal Power Station, and Sindh Industrial Trading Estate. While KESC generally \nhad sufficient generating capacity in the 1980s, the underinvested transmission and distribution \n(T&D) network could not keep pace with growing demand as consumer numbers increased (by \nabout 4.2 times between 1972 and 1987) and overall energy demand more than doubled. The \nresultant overloading, compounded by the age of the T&D facilities, led to frequent breakdowns, \nload shedding, and a sharp increase in T&D losses. As a result, during the second phase (1987 \nand  onward),  ADB  shifted  its  focus  to  improving  the  T&D  network  as  well  as  more  generally \nimproving  the  financial  health  of  KESC.  Both  the  5th (approved  in  1988)  and  6th  (approved  in \n1991)  power  (sector)  projects  focused  on  reinforcing,  rehabilitating,  and  extending  T&D  of \nKESC. Specifically, the focus of the 6th Power (Sector) Project was to \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\nreinforce and expand the transmission system; \nrehabilitate and expand the distribution system; \nimprove system protection, telecommunications, and load dispatch;  \ncomputerize to improve planning capabilities and increase administrative \nefficiency; \nimplement demand-side management; and \nfacilitate restructuring and privatization of KESC by strengthening its technical \ncapability and financial viability. \n\n \n3. \nADB and the Government agreed on the merits and urgency of privatizing KESC in late \nnineties. Accordingly, privatization of KESC was a core policy action under the ADB-supported \nEnergy  Sector  Restructuring  Program  (2000)  and  was  supported  through  a  $1.0  million \ntechnical  assistance,  Support  for  Privatization  of  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Corporation.  As  ADB \nprepared  KESC  for  privatization,  the  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD)  worked \nclosely  with  the  public  sector  division  responsible.  PSOD\u2019s  possible  interest  in  providing \nfinancial  support \nthe  KESC  privatization \ndocumentation  and  PSOD  had  initiated  discussions  with  potential  bidders.  KESC  shares  were \neventually  offered  for  sale  in  February  2005,  and  by  December  2005  the  Government \nsuccessfully sold 73% of KESC shares  \n \n4. \nADB\u2019s  Medium-Term  Strategy  II  supports  power  reforms  that  lead  to  a  greater  role  for \nthe  private  sector  in  the  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  of  electricity.  Pakistan\u2019s \nEnergy  Sector  Restructuring  Program  promoted  exactly  this  and  resulted  in  one  of  Pakistan\u2019s \nmost  important,  and  challenging  privatizations  to  date.  The  proposed  financing  represents  the \nnext stage. \n\nfor  post-privatization  KESC  was  set  out \n\nin \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nPOWER SUBSECTOR IN PAKISTAN \n\nSector Framework and Reform \n\nA. \n \nThe power subsector in Pakistan, which encompasses the generation, transmission, and \n1. \ndistribution  of  electricity,  is  governed  and  regulated  by  the  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory \nAuthority  (NEPRA)  Act  of  1997.  NEPRA,  which  was  constituted  as  an  independent  entity,  is \nexclusively  empowered  under  the  act  and  related  rules  to  regulate  all  facets  of  the  power \nsubsector  including  the  electricity  tariffs  charge  by  the  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Corporation \n(KESC).  NEPRA  is  thus  empowered  to  (i)  grant  licenses  for  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution;  (ii)  approve  tariffs,  rates,  and  charges  across  the  sector;  (iii)  establish  uniform \nindustry  performance  via  codes  and  standards;  and  (iv)  enforce  these.  NEPRA,  although \nmandated  as  an  independent  entity,  is  governed  by  a  chairperson  and  four  members,  all  of \nwhom are appointed by the Government, with the members recommended by and representing \nprovincial interests. \n \nPower  policies  and  related  legislative  frameworks  are  developed  and  implemented  by \n2. \nthe Government via the Ministry of Water and Power. The Government initiated the process of \npower  reforms  and  restructuring  in  the  early  1990s  on  the  advice  of  the  World  Bank.  The \nrestructuring and reform process, developed in various stages and through different initiatives, \nis  reflected  today  in  various  policies,  such  as  the  Power  Policy  1994,  Hydel  Policy  1995, \nTransmission  Line  Policy  1995,  Power  Policy  1998,  and  Power  Policy  2002.  These  were \ndesigned, to a large extent, to attract private sector participation in a newly restructured power \nsubsector.  In  addition,  the  NEPRA  Act  was  promulgated  to  provide  the  overall  regulatory \numbrella  for  the  sector.  Finally,  the  Government  is  today  undertaking  the  unbundling  of  the \nPakistan Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) into various independent entities. \nThe  broad  objectives  of  all  these  policies  have  been  to  (i)  bring  efficiencies  across  the  entire \nsector  via  competitive  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  with  appropriate  independent \nregulatory  oversight;  (ii)  rationalize  prices  and  subsidies;  and  (iii)  encourage  private  capital \nformation and investment to meet growing electricity demand. The privatization of KESC was a \nkey element in this ongoing program. \n \nThe power subsector, as a result of these policies and reforms, has been, and continues \n3. \nto  be,  in  transition  and  is  today  semiprivatized  and  semideregulated.  The  subsector  has \nhistorically  been  characterized  by  significant  Government  control  through  the  WAPDA  and \nKESC  monopolies  (which  function  as  vertically  integrated  utilities  encompassing  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution) and by significant inefficiency, with losses in excess of 25%, and \nan  inability  to  meet  demand.  This  characterization,  at  least  in  terms  of  outright  Government \ncontrol, has changed over the last decade, and Pakistan today enjoys significant private sector-\nled  generation  through  21  independent  power  producers  (IPPs),  19  of  which  were  sanctioned \nunder  the  Power  Policy  1994,14 and  together  represent  in  excess  of  30%  of  total  generation \ncapacity. Additionally, with the active assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), KESC \nwas privatized in late 2005 and to date remains the only vertically integrated private sector entity \nin  charge  of  the  majority  of  its  generation  and  all  of  its  transmission  and  distribution.  As  of \nDecember  2006,  about  40%  of  Pakistan\u2019s  installed  generation  capacity  was  owned  by  the \nprivate sector. This percent is likely to increase, with planned privatizations of Jamshoro Power \nCompany and secondary public offering of Kot Addu Power Company. The evident success in \nattracting  private  sector  investment  into  power  generation  was  not  without  issues,  and  most \n\n                                                 \n14  \n\nPolicy 1994 and was commissioned in 1997. \n\nHub  Power  Company,  a  1,292  megawatt  power  plant,  was  actually  under  development  prior  to  the  Power \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n21\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nIPPs,  especially  those  under  the  1994  Power  Policy,  ended  up  in  sometimes  acrimonious \ncontract  disputes  with  the  Government  and  WAPDA.  These  disputes  were  largely  driven  by  a \nsignificant capacity overhang in the mid to late 1990s (the exact opposite situation of today) and \nconsequent  tariff  implications.  Notwithstanding  discord,  these  disputes  were  ultimately  settled \namicably  with  minimal  adjustments  to  the  contracts.  In  hindsight,  the  terms  of  the  contracts, \nalthough  renegotiated,  were  ultimately  honored,  which  provides  a  degree  of  comfort  in  the \npresent investment environment. \n \nSignificant  power  reforms  supported  by  the  multilateral  development  banks  are  under \n4. \nway with the aim of unbundling WAPDA\u2019s Power Wing into multiple and discreet generation and \ndistribution units, and by placing WAPDA\u2019s transmission assets into a single corporatized entity, \nthe National Transmission and Dispatch Company Limited (NTDC). NTDC was incorporated in \n1998  and  is  responsible  for  power  transmission  in  all  of  Pakistan,  excluding  areas  served  by \nKESC.  NTDC,  which  operates  transmission  lines  of  66,  132,  220,  and  500  kilovolts  now \nassumes  the  additional  function  of  acting  as  the  single  buyer  of  wholesale  generation  from \nmultiple companies including IPPs in the market (but excluding KESC) for onward transmission \nand  sale  to  eight  distribution  entities.  This  includes  Faisalabad,  Gujranwala,  Hyderabad, \nIslamabad,  Lahore,  Multan,  Peshwar,  and  Quetta  electric  supply  companies,  most  commonly \nknown  as  DISCOs.  In  addition  to  this,  and  primarily  keeping  in  view  its  limited  generation \ncapacity, NTDC sells power to KESC (almost 600 megawatts (MW) were sold to KESC during \nthe peak season of summer 2006). At present a single-buyer, single-seller model is being put in \nplace,  which  the  Government  hopes,  as  more  investment  flows  into  the  power  subsector,  will \nevolve  into  a  multiple-buyer,  multiple-seller  regime,  where  generators  and  distributors  can \ncontract directly. \n \nB. \n\nTariff Structure \n\n5. \nThe  retail  tariff  regime  in  Pakistan  is  class-tiered  (based  on  different  classes  of \nconsumers,  i.e.,  residential,  industrial,  and  commercial)  and  graduated; 15  and  includes \nsignificant  cross  subsidies.  NEPRA  is  responsible  for  determining  tariffs  under  its  Tariff \nStandards  and  Procedures  Rules,  1998,  which  specify  standards  for  setting  tariffs,  and \nprocedures for adjudicating tariffs. These standards are sufficiently broad to allow discretion and \nthus  enable  the  development  of  various  tariff  regimes.  Tariff  determinations  are  based  on  the \nprinciple  of  recovering  prudently  incurred  costs  and  returns  on  the  applicant\u2019s  rate  base, \napplicable  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  They  contain  certain  automatic  quarterly  increases  on \naccount of changes in fuel costs or purchased power costs, as the case may be, in addition to \nmacroeconomic  indexation  of  costs.  NEPRA\u2019s  tariffs  become  effective  once  they  are  officially \nnotified  by  the  Government  in  its  official  gazette.  For  KESC\u2019s  tariffs,  determination  by  NEPRA \nalso  takes  into  account  the  end-consumer  burden,  in  addition  to  the  promised  return  to  new \nshareholders. KESC\u2019s current tariff structure, confirmed at privatization, is valid until 2012 and \nhas  an  element  of  the  Government  subsidy  whereby  end-users  are  charged  an  agreed-upon \ntariff. The Government reimburses KESC the difference between the actual tariff and end-user \ntariff as a subsidy. Table A3.1 provides average end-user tariffs for eight ex-WAPDA DISCOs \nand KESC. \n \n6. \nTo  grant  greater  financial  independence  to  the  newly  formed  generators  and  DISCOs \n(spun out of WAPDA), and to reduce tariff subsidies to WAPDA (in FY2006 WAPDA requested \na  subsidy  of  $1.316  billion),  the  Government  recently  announced  an  unanticipated  10% \nelectricity tariff increase. At present the end tariff charged by the DISCOs is heavily subsidized \n\n                                                 \n15  Tariffs are charged on a slab basis.

This coupled with high transmission and distribution \nlosses  (primarily  on  account  of  underinvestment  in  the  transmission  and  distribution  network, \nresulted in an increasing financial burden for WAPDA as well as for the DISCOs). The gravity of \nthe situation was evidenced in the number of days payable to IPPs (which sell power to WAPDA \nthrough NTDC); this was recently in excess of 2 months. The IPPs and the market welcomed \nthe  recent  tariff  increase;  they  see  this  as  a  first  step  by  the  Government  toward  rendering \nWAPDA solvent in advance of its eventual privatization, which has been on hold since 2000. \n \n\nTable A3.1: Average Electricity Tariffs \n(PRs/kWh) \n \n\nYear \n\n \n\n \n \n\nDISCOs \nKESC \n\n \n\n2001 \n\n2.99 \n4.06 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\nCAGR (%) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.73 \n4.54 \n\n3.95 \n4.72 \n\n3.84 \n5.00 \n\n \n\n\u2500 \n5.43 \n\n \n\n\u2500 \n5.87 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6.6 \n7.6 \n\n\u2500  =  not  available,  CAGR  =  compound  average  growth  rate,  DISCO  =  ex-WAPDA  distribution  company,  KESC  = \nKarachi Electric Supply Corporation, kWh = kilowatt-hour. \n* Up to 30 June 2005 \nSources: KESC and NEPRA annual reports 2005.  \n \nTo  grant  greater  financial  independence  to  the  newly  formed  generators  and  DISCOs \n7. \n(spun out of WAPDA), and to reduce tariff subsidies to WAPDA (in FY2006 WAPDA requested \na  subsidy  of  $1.316  billion),  the  Government  recently  announced  an  unanticipated  10% \nelectricity tariff increase.

This \ngrowth is being driven across all classes of consumers (except bulk supply/other) but especially \nby commercial consumers with a CAGR of 11.3%, agricultural 10.1%, and industrial 7.3. Power \nconsumption  in  Karachi,  Pakistan\u2019s  main  city  for  industrial  growth  contributing  about  15%  of \ngross  domestic  product,  grew  at  a  CAGR  of  7%\u20138%.  Consumption  has  continued  to  grow  on \nthe  back  of  recent  annual  economic  growth  rates  greater  than  7%;  similar  growth  rates  in \nelectricity  demand  are  expected  to  continue  in  the  near  future  based  on  projections  for \ncontinued strong economic growth and higher rates of per capita electricity consumption.

Set  up  in  1994,  PPIB  acts  as  a  one-window  operation  to \nfacilitate private investment in IPPs under the various national power and hydro policies. Given \nthe  enormous  power  requirements  of  the  country  and  support  for  the  private  sector,  PPIB  is \nagain  (as  was  the  case  in  the  mid  and  late  1990s16),  expected  to  play  an  important  part  in \nmobilizing investments into new thermal and hydro generation.  \n \n11. \nOf the 19,450 MW of installed capacity in Pakistan, firm supply at the end of 2006 was \n15,072 MW. By comparison, peak demand for 2006 was 15,483 MW, which resulted in a deficit \nof about 411 MW. Assuming, no additional capacity is added, PPIB has forecast the relationship \nbetween peak demand and firm supply for the next 7 years (Table A3.4). \n                                                 \n16  PPIB facilitated investments in over 15 IPPs with a combined installed capacity of 5,577 MW under the 1994 and \n\n1998 power policies \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nTable A3.4: Firm Supply versus Peak Demand Projections \n(MW) \n \n\nFirm Supplya Peak Demand Surplus/(Deficit) \n\nYear \n\n \n\n \n\n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n\n15,091 \n15,055 \n15,055 \n15,055 \n15,055 \n15,055 \n15,055 \n\n \n\n \n\n16,548 \n17,689 \n19,080 \n20,584 \n22,205 \n23,953 \n25,840 \n\n \n\n \n\n(1,457) \n(2,634) \n(4,028) \n(5,529) \n(7,150) \n(8,899) \n(10,785) \n\n \n\n \n\nMW = megawatt. \na Includes generation capacity of Karachi Electric Supply Corporation Limited. \nSource: Private Power Infrastructure Board. \n\n \n12. \nThis  growing  power  deficit  will  particularly  impact  large  urban  centers  such  as \nFaisalabad,  Karachi,  Lahore,  Rawalpindi,  and  Sialkot.  The  majority  of  Pakistan\u2019s  industrial \nassets,  including  SMEs,  are  situated  in  these  urban  centers  and  contribute  more  than  35%  to \nthe  country\u2019s  gross  domestic  product.  The  urban  center  that  will  be  most  impacted  by  the \nprecarious  power  situation  will  be  Karachi,  home  to  10%  of  the  country\u2019s  population  and  the \nindustrial capital. Power demand in Karachi has been increasing at an average of 8% per year \nsince  2000.  Although  the  city  has  its  own  dedicated  electric  supply  company\u2014KESC\u2014\nnegligible capacity investment in KESC during the last decade of state ownership meant that in \n2006  the  city  faced  a  deficit  of  842  MW  (or  53%  of  total  available  power  supply  including  self \ngeneration).  If  not  urgently  addressed,  KESC\u2019s  existing  capacity  output  will  decrease  due  to \naging machinery.  \n \n13. \nRecognizing the gravity of the situation, the Government, through WAPDA\u2019s power and \nenergy  planning  wings  and  PPIB,  has  developed  several  long-term  electricity  demand  load \nprojections and new supply options. KESC\u2019s new generation additions (to be partly financed by \nthe proposed ADB, International Finance Corporation, and commercial bank loans) have been \nincorporated into these plans. To meet growing demand and to use Pakistan\u2019s significant water \nresources  especially  in  the  northern  part  of  the  country,  WAPDA  has  developed  a  least-cost \ngeneration  expansion  plan,  which  emphasizes  indigenous  sources  of  energy,  primarily  hydro \n(and  in  some  cases  coal),  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  power  policies.  Uncertainty, \nhowever, remains about the pace of this overall generation expansion given numerous delays \nexperienced  to  date.  Investment  in  hydro  IPPs  is  expected  to  gain  momentum  after  the \ndocumentation/arrangements  for  the  New  Bong  Escape  Hydropower  Plant  (partly  financed  by \nADB17),  have  been  finalized/settled;  however  concerns  about  the  speed  of  capacity  addition \nremain.  Table  A3.5  shows  Pakistan\u2019s  power  demand  projections  relative  to  planned  capacity \nadditions  by  WAPDA,  IPPs,  and  KESC.  This  is  estimated  to  represent  the  best-case  scenario \nfrom  a  capacity  addition  point  of  view,  as  it  assumes  that  all  capacity  additions  will  occur  as \nplanned in the next 4 years. \n\n                                                 \n17  ADB.  2005.

Karachi generates about 15% of the national gross domestic \nproduct (GDP), 42% of value added in large-scale manufacturing and 25% of the revenues of \nthe federal Government. The city has an estimated GDP of approximately $17 billion\u2013$19 billion \nand  GDP  per  capita  of  approximately  $1,200.  The  city\u2019s  economy  is  large  and  diverse,  and \nincludes a number of industrial zones producing a variety of goods, from textiles to chemicals, \nsteel,  and  machinery.  Karachi  is  also  the  transport  hub  of  the  nation:  it  contains  the  country\u2019s \ntwo  major  ports:  the  port  of  Karachi  and  Port  Mohammad  Bin  Qasim,  as  well  as  Pakistan\u2019s \nlargest  airport.  The  city  is  expected  to  maintain  its  dominant  role  as  a  major  industrial  and \ncommercial center. \n \nKESC  has  an  exclusive  franchise  license  to  generate,  transmit,  and  distribute  electric \n2. \npower to the city of Karachi. KESC was incorporated in 1913 and operated as a private entity \nuntil 1952, when the Government acquired 73% and took control. For the next three decades, \nthe Government invested (largely through loans from the  Asian Development Bank [ADB] and \nWorld Bank) in setting up generation plants for KESC and selected investments in transmission \nand distribution networks. However, KESC\u2019s generation facilities could not keep pace with the \nincreasing  power  demands  in  the  mid  1990s  because  of  accelerated  economic  growth.  Given \nthe  investor-friendly  power  policies  for  setting  up  independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  in  the \nmid 1990s, two captive IPPs\u2014Tapal and Gul Ahmed\u2014 were set up for KESC; and together with \nWAPDA, have been providing power since 1995.

The ability to meet demand is essentially impacted by two main \nfactors: (i) access to sufficient electricity generation (within the capacity of the current network \nand  bearing  in  mind  latent  demand  that  will  become  evident  as  additional  supply  is  made \navailable), and (ii) having a sufficiently large and reliable network to handle the required supply. \nKESC\u2019s past and present demand-supply gap is provided in Table A4.3. Since 2000, demand in \nKarachi has been increasing at an annual average rate of more than 8%; this is higher than the \noverall increase in Pakistan\u2019s GDP growth of 6% during the same period.  \n \n\nTable A4.3: KESC Power Demand and Supply Gap for 2001\u20132006 \n(MW)  \n\nItem \n\n \nKESC Self-\nGeneration \nWAPDA/NTDC \nIPPs \nTotal Supply \nTotal Grid \nDemand  \nTotal Latent \nDemand \nTotal Demand \nUnmet Demand \n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n859\n\n939\n\n949\n\n1,042\n\n203\n210\n1,272\n1,807\n\n149\n230\n1,318\n1,916\n\n202\n223\n1,374\n2,031\n\n205\n201\n1,448\n2,153\n\n2005 \n \n992 \n\n277 \n206 \n1,475 \n2,282 \n\n2006 \n \n964 \n\n436 \n200 \n1,600 \n2,442 \n\n39\n\n61\n\n95\n\n161\n\n201 \n\n222 \n\n1,846\n574\n\n1,977\n659\n\n2,126\n752\n\n2,314\n866\n\n2,483 \n1,008 \n\n2,664 \n1,064 \n\nElectricity Supply \n\nIPP = independent power producer, KESC = Karachi Electric Supply Corporation Limited, MW = megawatt, NTDC = \nNational Transmission and Dispatch Corporation, WAPDA = Water and Power Development Authority. \nSource: Karachi Electric Supply Corporation Limited, March 2007. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nKESC  has  capacity  to  supply  2,176  MW,  of  which  1,336  MW  (equivalent  to \napproximately  61%)  is  self-owned  generation  while  the  remainder,  approximately  840  MW,  is \nprocured  from  external  sources  (currently  WAPDA,  two  private  IPPs,  and  Karachi  Nuclear \nPower Plant18).  \n \n                                                 \n18  This plant is owned and operated by the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nKESC\u2019s internal generation capacity has not increased since 1998. During 1998\u20132006, \n6. \npeak demand increased more than 60% with most of this additional load being met by external \nsources. KESC\u2019s average load factor from its existing available capacity was 72% in 2006. \n \nKESC\u2019s  transmission  network  comprises  220  kilovolt  (kV),  132  kV,  and  66  kV  circuits; \n7. \nand is connected to the WAPDA system through two 220 kV ties and two single-circuit 132 kV \nties.  These  interconnections  have  a  total  transmission  capacity  of  1,060  MW.  KESC\u2019s \ndistribution network consists of a low voltage 11 kV circuit for medium voltage feeders and 400 \nvolts for all low voltage feeders. The 11 kV distribution network, which consists of 2,200 km of \noverhead  and  4,060  km  of  underground  lines,  has  more  than  850  feeders  and  9,200 \ntransformers. The 11 kV distribution system. The 400 kV systems have 9,583 km of overhead \nlines and 921 km of underground lines. \n \nD. \n \n8. \nKESC\u2019s  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  operations  are  governed  by  licenses \nissued  by  NEPRA.  KESC  has  a  generation  license  for  its  service  area  until  July  2018  and  a \ndistribution license until 2023. KESC\u2019s distribution license is contingent on meeting a number of \nservice  standards  stipulated  by  NEPRA.  The  performance  standards  are  detailed  and  the \nfinancial penalties for noncompliance are clear.  \n \n9. \nIn 2002, and in anticipation of the company\u2019s privatization, NEPRA approved a multiyear \ntariff  for  KESC.  This  tariff  structure  is  based  on  clear  and  established  rules  that  allow  pass \nthrough of uncontrollable costs (power purchase, fuel costs), prudent controllable costs, and a \nreasonable rate of return to the new owners.  \n \n\nRegulation and Tariff \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nPRIVATE SECTOR OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT CURRENT INVESTMENTS/LOANS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR  \n(equivalent $ million) \n \n\nCountry \nPHI \nIND \nIND \nPRC \nPHI \nPHI \nNEP \nNEP \nPAK \nPRC \n\nName of Company \nMirant Navotas Corp.

\n\n \n1. \nIncorporated as a private limited company in 1913, Karachi Electric Supply Corporation \n(KESC) is an integrated electric utility supplying power to the city of Karachi, Pakistan's largest \nindustrial and commercial center. KESC is engaged in generation, transmission, and distribution \nof  electricity  in  a  service  area  that  includes  approximately  6,000  square  kilometers  and  a \npopulation of more than 16 million. In 1952, the Government of Pakistan took control of KESC \nby acquiring a 73% shareholding.  \n \n2. \nThe  KESC  vision  statement  is  \u201cTo  ensure  un-interrupted  power  supply  to  the  valuable \ncustomers  of  the  Metropolis  signifying  a  productive  and  constructive  role  of  KESC  in  socio \neconomic activities and revival of national economy by way of sustainable industrial growth.\u201d \n \n3. \n \n\nKESC states its mission is to \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\ngenerate, transmit, and distribute electricity for the progress and prosperity of the \npeople of the metropolis; \nmeet customer expectations with reliable, stable, and affordable electric power; \nimprove the safety and quality of the work place for its employees; \ndevelop  growth  opportunities  for  KESC,  and  its  employees,  customers,  and \nstakeholders; and \nbe ethical and in compliance with all applicable laws and corporate practices in \nletter and spirit. \n\n \nA. \n\nOwnership Structure and Sponsors \n\n4. \nIn 2000, as a part of the Energy Sector Restructuring Program, supported by the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  the  Government  decided  to  privatize  KESC  through  a  transparent, \ncompetitive bid process and hired PricewaterhouseCoopers as its transaction adviser. Prior to \nprivatization, the Government initiated a capital restructuring where the financial debt of KESC \nwas  swapped  for  equity  by  the  Government.  This  exercise  resulted  in  government  ownership \nincreasing  to  99%.  In  December  2005,  following  a  sale  process  supported  by  ADB  technical \nassistance,  the  Government  transferred  73%  of  its  shares  to  a  consortium  of  investors  led  by \nKES  Power  Limited,  in  turn  owned  by  Al-Jomaih  Power  Limited,  which  forms  part  of  a  Saudi \nindustrial group, and Denham Investment Limited, part of National Industries Group, a Kuwaiti \nindustrial and financial conglomerate.  \n \n5. \nAl  Jomaih  Power  Ltd.  This is  the holding  company  for  the  Al  Jomaih Group  of  Saudi \nArabia  (Al  Jomaih),  which  was  founded  in  1936  and  is  now  a  large  conglomerate  with \noperations throughout the Gulf region. Al Jomaih has sizable investments across a number of \nsectors (soft drinks, automotive, lubricants). Al Jomaih Automotive, a 100% owned subsidiary of \nAl  Jomaih,  operates  the  General  Motors  dealership  in  the  Gulf  region,  one  of  the  largest \nautomotive dealerships in the Middle East. The Al Jomaih and Shell Lubricating Oil Company, a \njoint venture between Al Jomaih (51%) and Royal Dutch Shell (49%) operates a lubricating oil \nproduction  facility  with  a  capacity  of  50,000  tons  per  annum.  In  addition,  Al  Jomaih  owns  soft \ndrink  bottling  operations  (Pepsi  Cola,  Mountain  Dew,  7UP)  with  a  total  production  capacity  of \nmore  than  one  million  cans  per  day.  Al  Jomaih  also  operates  the  Saudi  Arabian  distribution \nnetwork  for  Yokohama  Tires,  and  Perkins  Engines.  Al  Jomaih  is  owned  by  the  heirs  of  the \nfounder, Mohammed Abdullah Al Jomaih. \n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\n     Appendix 8 \n\nDenham  Investments  Ltd.  This  is  the  holding  company  for  the  National  Industries \n6. \nGroup  of  Kuwait  which  has  diversified  operations  in  the  Middle  East,  and  Europe.

Siemens staff \nare fully integrated into KESC\u2019s management team.  \n \nE. \n\nPhysical Infrastructure \n\n23. \nKESC\u2019s  infrastructure  can  be  divided  into  the  three  areas  of:  power  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution networks. The total installed generation capacity of KESC is 1,756 \nMW.  However,  due  to  lack  of  periodic  maintenance  and  upgrading,  generation  capacity  has \ndeclined  to  1,336  MW  (dependable  capacity).  To  meet  additional  demand,  KESC  buys  power \nfrom  WAPDA,  Tapal  and  Gul  Ahmed  IPPs,  and  Karachi  Nuclear  Power  Plant.  KESC\u2019s  self-\ngeneration capacity has not increased since the last capacity addition of 210 MW in 1998.  \n \nKESC\u2019s  transmission  network  comprises  220  kilovolt  (kV),  132  kV,  and  66  kV  circuits; \n24. \nand  is  connected  to  the  WAPDA  system  through  two  220  kV  circuits  and  two  single  132  kV \ncircuits.  These  interconnections  have  a  total  transmission  capacity  of  1,060  MW.  KESC\u2019s \ndistribution network consists of a low voltage 11 kV circuit for medium voltage feeders and 400 \nvolts  for  all  low  voltage  feeders,  as  well  as  more  than  850  feeders  for  the  11  kV  distribution \nnetwork  and  9,200  transformers.  The  11  kV  distribution  system  consists  of  2,200  km  of \noverhead and 4,060 km of underground lines. The 400-volt systems have 9,583 km of overhead \nand 921 km of underground lines.  \n \nF. \n\nHuman Resources  \n\n25. \nAs  of  December  2006,  KESC  employed  more  than  18,000  staff,  with  more  than  1,800 \nworking  in  management.  Fifty-eight  percent  of  the  employees  are  involved  in  network \nmaintenance (T&D), 25% in customer support, 7% in generation, 5% in corporate and finance, \n3%  in  engineering,  and  2%  in  human  resources.  Forty-six  percent  are  permanent  employees \nwith  lifetime  employment  and  pension  benefits  including  guaranteed  postretirement  health \ncoverage;  54%  are  contractual  employees.  KESC\u2019s  new  management  has  maintained  a  very \ngood working relationship with union representatives. Since privatization, no layoffs have been \nannounced; and during the due diligence mission, KESC\u2019s chief human resources officer noted \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\n     Appendix 8 \n\nthe  company\u2019s  plans  to  introduce  performance-driven  management  and  a  reward  culture  by \ninvesting in the current employees. KESC management also confirmed to ADB that no layoffs \nare planned in the foreseeable future. \n \nG. \n\nTurnaround Strategy \n\nThe new owners, in partnership with KESC  management and Siemens, have come up \n\n26. \nwith a three-tier turnaround strategy: \n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nRestructure and develop the organization to make the operation more customer-\nfocused  while  improving  collections  and  administrative  losses.  This  will  lead  to \nbetter  revenue  protection  and  cash-flow  generation,  while  enhancing  KESC\u2019s \nmanagement capabilities and increasing customer satisfaction. \nBalance,  modernize,  and  replace  the  T&D  network  to  be  able  to  cater  for  peak \ncapacity  demand  in  the  future  and  reduce  technical  losses,  which  will  lead  to \nlower energy losses and higher billing per units dispatched. \nIncrease and improve KESC\u2019s generation capacity to increase the revenue base, \ndiversify sources of power for KESC, lower the blended cost of generation, and \nenhance the Karachi area\u2019s overall generation capacity to cater for the increasing \ndemand. \n\n \n27. \nOrganizational  Restructuring  and  Development.  KESC  owners  and  senior \nmanagement  are  committed  to  developing  and  complying  with  industry  best  practices  and \nmanagement standards to ensure KESC\u2019s success. Management has identified and developed \nkey areas that will lead the company to success:  \n \n\nstrategic direction and planning, \ncorporate development,  \ncorporate governance, and \nbest practices and compliance and monitoring. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n \n28. \nThe implementation of these will enable management to distinguish between day-to-day \nmanagement  and  longer  term  strategic  planning.  This  capability  will  help  retain  the  focus  to \nachieve both short-term goals and long-term growth. \n \n29.  With  the  strategic  direction  and  planning,  KESC  has  aligned  its  core  values  with  its \nmission. Accordingly the following core values will guide KESC\u2019s operations: \n \n\nVision   \nAttitude \nLeadership \nUpright  \nExcellence \nSynergy \n\ncustomer oriented, innovative \nproactive, based on commitment, and respect \nbased on integrity, trust, and teamwork \ncredible and reliable \nin customer services with quality \nin team results \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n \n\n30. \nUnder  corporate  development,  KESC  management  is  committed  to  a  corporate \ndevelopment program based on four primary classifications that are subdivided into 15 different \nareas (Table A7.2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable A8.2: KESC Corporate Development Program: Primary Classifications \n\n \n\nKnowledge \n\nAppendix 8     \n\n43\n\nEnterprise \n\nOrganizational Structure \n\nCorporate Culture \n\nExecutive Leadership \n\n \n\nResources \n\nEmployees \n\nCommunication \n\nTechnology \n\nTeamwork \n\nCustomer Knowledge \n\nCompetitive Knowledge \n\nBusiness Knowledge \n\nFinancial Knowledge \n\nDeployment \n\nPlanning Control \n\nMarket Strategy \n\nPlanning Process \n\nPlan Implementation \n\nSource: Karachi Electric Supply Corporation Limited.                   \n\n \n31. \nKESC\u2019s  management  is  very  clear  on  the  turnaround  strategy  and  its  implementation \nand evaluation over time. To reduce the complex set of strategic issues, management mapped \nits  position  on  the  corporate  development  wheel  when  it  took  over  KESC  operations  after \nprivatization. After assessing the situation, management set itself targets and devised methods \nto address them. Within a span of only 6 months, clear improvements have been accomplished \n(Figure A8.3). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFigure A8.3: Corporate Development Program \n\nDecember 2005 \n\nJune 2006 \n\niv.

KESC strongly believes that disclosure and transparency is the \n32. \nkey to good corporate governance. Good governance derives directly from enhanced disclosure \nof existing corporate practices (i.e., greater transparency) and provides KESC stakeholders with \na  fair  and  honest  assessment  of  KESC  performance.  To  ensure  the  applicability  of  good \ncorporate  governance  principles,  KESC  has  devised  a  code  of  principles  that  outlines  each \nsection  of  the  code.  The  KESC  board  of  directors  has  formed  the  following  committees  to \noversee these principles: \n \n\nExecutive/Management Committee, \nInternal Audit Committee,  \nHuman Resource Committee, and \nSupply Chain-Procurement Committee. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n \n33. \nBest Practices Framework, and Compliance and Monitoring. KESC is in the process \nof benchmarking itself against international best practices. This will include internal and external \nbenchmarking  processes.  Internally,  benchmarks  will  be  used  to  identify  business  units, \ndivisions,  and  departments  where  best  practices  exist.  As  best  practices  are  identified  in  one \narea,  they  can  then  be  implemented  across  all  other  areas.  Externally,  benchmarking  will  be \nused as a tool to identify the extent of the deviation from best business practices. This will be \nachieved  by  selecting  a  partner  within  the  benchmarking  network.

Management has devised broad cultural guidelines that each person and group (as \nwell  as  KESC  as  a  corporate  entity)  will  aspire  to  live  by  in  the  discharge  of  their  duties.  The \nnew  management  is  pragmatic  and  recognizes  that  bringing  about  change  will  be  a  gradual \nprocess; it is aware of the time constraints and challenges.  \n \n35. \nBalancing,  Modernizing,  and  Replacing  the  T&D  Network.  Since the privatization in \nNovember  2005  to  June  2006,  KESC  has  already  spent  approximately  PRs1  billion  ($16.6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8     \n\n45\n\nmillion)  on  transmission,  and  approximately  PRs1.2  billion  ($19.9  million)  on  distribution.  This \nhas  improved  network  reliability,  which  has  reduced  technical  losses  by  2%.  Transmission \ncapacity has also increased by 300 megavolt-amperes and distribution capacity by 115 MW. \n \nAbout  PRs16.9  billion  ($268  million)  has  been  allocated  for  rehabilitation  of  the  T&D \n36. \nnetwork  over  the  next  3  years.  This  investment  will  help  ensure  reliability,  provide  enhanced \ncapacity utilization, and serve as the platform for growth.  \n \n37. \ninto two components of rehabilitation of existing facilities and generation capacity addition.  \n \n\nIncreasing  and  Improving  KESC\u2019s  Generation  Capacity. This component is divided \n\nRehabilitation of Existing Generation Facilities  \n\n1. \n \n38. \nThe  rehabilitation  program  aims  to  increase  power  generation  capacity  from  existing \nplants  by  213  MW  before  the  summer  of  2007.  Key  areas  for  improvement  are  heat  rate, \nauxiliary consumption, and load factor.  \n \n39. \nbillion ($10 million). \n \n\nThe total amount allocated for rehabilitation for 2007 and 2008 is approximately PRs0.6 \n\nCapacity Addition \n\n2. \n \n40. \nCapacity addition of 780 MW through two new combined-cycle power generation plants \nis planned under this component. The plants will have a dependable capacity of approximately \n745 MW. The first plant of 220 MW will be built on surplus land within the boundary of Korangi \nThermal Power Station and will cost PRs11.0 billion ($174 million). The plant will consist of four \ngas  turbines  of  50  MW  each  and  a steam  turbine  of  20  MW.  The  plant  will  be set  up  over  18 \nmonths, with the first gas turbine operational in August 2007 and with complete commissioning \nexpected by January 2009. The existing gas pipeline at Korangi Thermal Power Station will be \nsufficient  to  accommodate  the  additional  gas  supply  required  for  this  plant.  A  new  560  MW \n(dependable capacity of 525 MW) plant will be built on surplus land within the boundary of the \nexisting BQTPS site at a cost of $350 million. The plant will consist of three gas turbines of 120 \nMW each and a steam turbine of 200 MW. The first gas turbine is expected to be operational in \nJuly 2008, with complete commissioning expected by November 2009. The existing gas pipeline \nat  BQTPS  can  supply  sufficient  gas  for  the  new  plant.  Both  plants  are  dual  fuel  capable,  i.e., \nboth  can  operate  on  gas  as  well  as  heavy  furnace  oil.  Once  fully  operational,  the  thermal \nefficiency of the new plants is expected to be approximately 50% and both will be built under a \nturnkey,  fixed-price,  lump-sum  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  contract  in  six \nphases from 2007 to 2009. \n \nOn  complete  commissioning  of  both  phases,  KESC\u2019s  generation  capacity  will  increase \n41. \nby almost 44.4%, significantly enhancing its ability to meet demand. The new power plants will \nalso lower KESC\u2019s dependence on (more expensive) external power purchases.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 25 April 2007) \n", "Currency Unit\nPRe1.00\n$1.00\n", "Pakistan rupee/s (PRe/PRs) \n$0.0165 \nPRs60.66 \n", "ADB \nBQTPS \nCAGR \nDSCR \nEBITDA \nEIRR \nIFC \nIPP \nKESC \nKES Power \nKTPS \nLIBOR \nNEPRA \nNTDC \nO&M \nSBP \nTA \nT&D \nWAPDA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "Asian Development Bank \nBin Qasim Thermal Power Station  \ncompound average growth rate \ndebt service cover ratio \nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization \neconomic internal rate of return  \nInternational Finance Corporation \nindependent power producer \nKarachi Electric Supply Corporation Limited \nKES Power Limited \nKorangi Thermal Power Station  \nLondon interbank offered rate \nNational Electric Power Regulatory Authority  \nNational Transmission and Dispatch Corporation \noperation and maintenance \nState Bank of Pakistan \ntechnical assistance \ntransmission and distribution \nWater and Power Development Authority \n", " \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n \n", "km \nkV (kilovolt) \nkWh (kilowatt-hour) \nMVA \nMW (megawatt) \nGWh (gigawatt-hour) \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "kilometer \n1,000 volts \n1,000 watt-hours \nmegavolt amperes \n1 million watts \n1 million kilowatt-hours \n", " \nNOTES \n \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \nKESC\u2019s fiscal year (FY) ends on 30 June.
