I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Global Environment \nFacility (GEF), both to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Shaanxi Weinan Luyang \nIntegrated  Saline  Land  Management  Project. 1  The  report  also  describes  proposed \nadministration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund2 under \nthe Water Financing Partnership Facility for the Management and Protection of Wetlands in \nWeinan City in Shaanxi Province, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.3 \n \n2.  The project is located in Luyanghu, a low-lying waterlogged area 35 kilometers (km) \nnorth  of  Weinan  city,  Shaanxi  province.  The  project  will  support  the  Weinan  municipal \ngovernment  (WMG)  in  reducing  flood  risk,  soil  salinity,  and  waterlogging  for  an  economic \ndevelopment zone and agricultural lands in the Luyanghu area, which will directly benefit rural \ncommunities in the area. The project will also support the WMG in finalizing and implementing a \nmanagement plan for the Luyanghu National Wetland Park (LNWP), in close cooperation with \nthe  local  communities,  which  will  ensure  wetland  conservation  while  creating  new \nnonagricultural livelihood opportunities through tourism and other activities.4  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Government  development  strategy.  In  2009,  the  State  Council  approved  the \nestablishment of the Guanzhong\u2013Tianshui Economic Zone (GTEZ), one of three economic \ndevelopment zones defined in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan for the western region.5  The GTEZ \nwill cover 79,800 square kilometers (km2) in selected cities of Shaanxi and Gansu provinces \nwith construction planned from 2009 to 2020.6 By 2020 the gross domestic product output of the \nGTEZ is expected to reach one-third of the western region. The municipal government of \nWeinan city, which is located in the east of Guanzhong Plain and part of the GTEZ, designated \nthe Luyanghu area as one of the development areas in the GTEZ. The WMG has a long-term \ndevelopment  plan  (2007\u20132025)  for  the  Luyanghu  area  to  attract  high-technology  industrial \ninvestment,  promote  tourism,  and  create  job  opportunities.  In  December  2007,  the  WMG \nestablished the Weinan Luyanghu Modern Industry Development Zone Management Committee \n(WLMIDZMC)  to  coordinate  development  efforts,  and  the  Weinan  Luyang  Construction \nDevelopment Company to be responsible for infrastructure improvement. \n \n4.  Luyanghu  comprises  a  total  watershed  of  1,123  km2  across  Fuping  and  Pucheng \ncounties.  It  is  a  national  poverty  area.  In  2012,  the  population  of  the  project  area  is \napproximately 113,000, mostly rural villagers; approximately 30% of rural households live below \n                                                \n1  The original title was \u2015Shaanxi Weinan Luyang Integrated Saline and Alkaline Land Management Project.\u2016 \n2  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n4  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2010.Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic \nof China for Preparing the Shaanxi Weinan Luyang Integrated Saline and Alkaline Land Management Project. \nManila. \n5  The policy covers (i) six provinces: Gansu, Guizhou, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan; (ii) five autonomous \nregions: Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Xizang (also known as Tibet Autonomous Region), and Xinjiang; and \n(iii) one municipality: Chongqing. In 2009, this region comprised 71.4% of mainland People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s \narea, but only 28.8% of its population and 19.9% of its total economic output.  \n6  ADB also finances the Gansu Tianshui Urban Infrastructure Development Project, which aims to enable Tianshui \ncity to meet urbanization pressures and maximize Guangzhong\u2013Tianshui Economic Zone-related benefits.  ", "2 \nthe Weinan municipal poverty line of CNY2,500. Their 2010 average per capita income was only \nCNY4,372, one-third lower than the Shaanxi provincial average and roughly a quarter of the \naverage annual income of urban residents in the same municipality. Agricultural productivity is \nlow because of poor soil conditions and drainage problems. Local residents grow limited wheat \nand corn crops, with production only half of that in other areas of Weinan city. A small but active \nsalt-harvesting and processing industry continues and needs to be preserved. \n \n5.  Land management. The decades-long poor environmental conditions of the Luyanghu \narea  are  mainly  due  to  long-term  problems  of  saline  soil,  high  groundwater  tables,  poor \ndrainage systems, and subsequent flooding problems. The groundwater table is approximately \n0\u20133 meters below the surface. The salt and mineral content of groundwater and soil is now very \nhigh in certain areas, significantly reducing agricultural productivity. In 1974, to reduce the salt \ncontent and improve agricultural productivity, the government established the Luoxi desalination \ndrainage system, which comprises one main desalination drainage channel, four subcanals, and \nbranch and secondary branch drainage channels. The system serves an area of approximately \n212 km2. Due to insufficient investment, the original design of the desalination system was of \npoor quality, and lack of maintenance made the system ineffective to reduce soil salinity.  \n \n6.  The WMG envisages a balanced approach to promoting and protecting the economic \ndevelopment zone (covering approximately 15 km2), while improving the natural environment \nand supporting rural livelihoods in the surrounding agricultural lands of approximately 186 km2. \nSpecific interventions needed to ensure sustained economic growth include (i) rehabilitation of \nthe Luoxi desalination drainage system to remove salts from the soil, (ii) improvement of flood \nstorage capacity of Luyanghu area to reduce flood risks to local residents and the development \nzone,  and  (iii)  rehabilitation  and  conservation  of  the  remaining  wetland  environment.  The \nShaanxi provincial government (SPG) initiated establishment of the LNWP and prepared a draft \nmaster plan, but no further activities have been carried out.  \n \n7.  Consistency with country partnership strategy. The project supports ADB's country \npartnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  the  PRC,7 which  is  based  on  the  pillars  of  Strategy  2020: \ninclusive growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional cooperation and integration. \nNatural resources and agriculture is a CPS priority sector. ADB provides lending and technical \nassistance to contribute to sound land, water, and natural resources management that also \nsupport rural livelihood improvement. In particular, ADB promotes innovative and demonstration \nprojects where ADB can play a catalytic role in addressing poverty, rising income inequality, and \nwidening regional disparities. The project will support priorities of the PRC's Twelfth Five-Year \nPlan, 2011\u20132015, particularly efforts to move to a greener and more inclusive development path.  \n \n8.  The project complements ongoing support to Shaanxi province, including the Shaanxi \nQinling Biodiversity Conservation and Demonstration Project, and the Forestry and Ecological \nRestoration Project in Three Northwest Provinces.8 These projects demonstrate the important \nrole that ADB plays to introduce innovative and good practices to strengthen sustainable land \nmanagement and biodiversity conservation. ADB also served as the lead GEF agency for the \nPRC\u2013GEF  Partnership  on  Land  Degradation  in  Dryland  Ecosystems,  which  ensured  that \nsignificant institutional capacity has been built in the central government, participating provinces, \nand autonomous regions, including Shaanxi province.

The  current  focus  of  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China \n(government) is to scale up the activities through supportive investment projects.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact will be sustained and inclusive economic growth in Weinan municipality. The \noutcome will be improved natural environment and rural livelihood in Luyanghu area.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n10.  Output  1:  Saline  soils  rehabilitated.  Output  1  will  reduce  soil  salinity  over \napproximately 212 km2 and increase productivity and climate resilience of approximately 186 \nkm2 of agricultural land. It has two components: (i) rehabilitation of Luoxi drainage system, and \n(ii)  support for  improving resilience  to  climate change  of  agro-ecosystems.  Under the first \ncomponent, activities include (i) dredging and rehabilitating approximately 46.9 km of the main \ndesalination  drainage  channels;  (ii)  dredging  approximately  90.3  km  of  the  branch  and \nsecondary  branch  drainage  channels;  (iii) rehabilitating  approximately  450  small  structures, \nincluding approximately 153 bridges, 69 culverts, 54 aqueducts, and 174 flow confluences; (iv) \nconstructing and rehabilitating approximately 35.6 km of rural roads; (v) testing at least 10 \ninnovative and replicable best practices for rehabilitating saline soil approximately over 100 \nhectares (ha), including discussions with farmers on implementation arrangements and support \nfor  implementation  over  the  larger  project  area;  and  (vi)  providing  training  on  saline  land \nmanagement to support expansion to a larger area. Under the second component, support will \nbe provided to (i) reduce the vulnerability of local communities to climate change through \nenhanced provision of regulating ecosystem services, such as water and temperature regulation \nand soil retention, and (ii) local farmers to improve crop productivity in the approximately 186 \nkm2  of  agricultural  areas  where  drainage  will  be  improved.  Activities  to  support  improved \nresilience to climate change include (i) testing of at least two innovative and replicable best \npractices for the establishment of shelter belts (covering approximately 2 ha); (ii) construction of \napproximately 130 ha of greenbelts; and (iii) support for farmers to market their products and \nincrease alternative income generating livelihood. Suitable activities\u2014particularly items (v) and \n(vi) under the first component, and item (iii) under the second component\u2014will also target \nhouseholds headed by women to ensure that they equally benefit from the project.  \n \n11.  Output 2: Flood risk management implemented. Output 2 will improve flood storage \ncapacity of Luyanghu area to reduce flood risks to local residents. It includes (i) construction of \nTianlu lake (approximately 130 ha), connecting Tianjiao lake in the west, a middle main channel, \nand a central main channel; and (ii) construction of approximately 18.6 km of dike with road \naround Tianlu lake. Combined with Tianjiao lake, the project will provide flood storage capacity \nof 5.4 million cubic meters to protect against flood events, with maximum capacity of 12.6 million \ncubic meters to protect against a 50-year flood event. The integrated and innovative approach \ncombining flood risk management with drainage system rehabilitation and wetlands ecosystem \nconservation will contribute to reduced flood risk for the Luyanghu area.  \n \n12.  Output  3:  Wetland  ecosystem  conservation  established.  Output  3  has  two \ncomponents: (i) support for LNWP development; and (ii) promotion of tourism, livelihood, and \nemployment  opportunities  for  local  communities.  The  wetlands  conservation  will  reverse \necosystem degradation caused by agricultural encroachment and other pressures associated \nwith the increasing population within the project area. The first component will (i) rehabilitate \napproximately 860 ha of degraded wetlands; (ii) prepare and support implementation of the \n ", "4 \nLNWP master plan for approximately 1,070 ha; (iii) establish a wetland management training \nfacility; (iv) test at least two innovative and replicable best practices in wetland rehabilitation \n(covering  approximately  10  ha);  and  (v)  train  50  officials  on  wetland  environment  and \nmanagement. The second component will support the development of ecotourism focusing on \nthe ecological values of the wetlands and the cultural heritage of salt harvesting in the area. \nTraining on livelihood skills will be provided for approximately 1,000 villagers, at least 50% will \nbe women, and be primarily targeted at people displaced due to land acquisition.  \n \n13.  Output 4: Capacity development and project implementation support provided. \nOutput  4  has  two  components:  (i)  institutional  strengthening,  and  (ii)  project  management \nsupport during project implementation. The first will support capacity development and training \nof WMG and WLMIDZMC staff in ADB project management procedures, technical design and \nimplementation,  and  safeguard  supervision  and  monitoring.  The  introduction  of  12  GEF-\nfinanced innovative best practices for sustainable land and wetland management, together with \nthe international consulting services, will significantly strengthen WMG capacity. The second \ncomponent will provide overall project implementation support for the WMG and WLMIDZMC, \nincluding implementation of land acquisition and resettlement.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n14.  The project is estimated to cost $165.2 million (Table 1).

International  and  national  consulting  services  will  provide  the  necessary \ntechnical support to ensure that international best practices are integrated into the final detailed \ndesign, and are applied during construction and implementation. The design to rehabilitate the \ndrainage system is consistent with the original layout of the 1974 system, but will correct design \nfeatures that rendered the current system ineffective: the current gradients of the main channels \nare too low and no secondary branch channels or field ditches were provided. The flood control \ninfrastructure is designed to protect against a 10-year flood event over 18,600 ha, and a 50-year \nflood event over 1,500 ha of the industrial and commercial development zone. The wetland \n                                                \n12  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. \n ", "7 \necological conservation activities are based on the WMG\u2019s 2012 draft wetland master plan. GEF \nwill provide international and national consulting services to start implementation and strengthen \nthe master plan. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n20.  The economic analysis indicates that the project is economically viable, with an overall \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  of  15.2%  and  an  economic  net  present  value  of \nCNY233.5 million.  The  rates  of  return  for  individual  outputs  are  14.3%  for  saline  soil \nrehabilitation,  15.6%  for  flood  risk  management,  and  14.2%  for  wetland  ecosystem \nconservation.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  project  is  generally  robust  to  potential \nvariations  in  costs  and  benefits.  The  project  remains  economically  viable  even  with  a \ncombination of a benefit decline of 10.0% and a capital cost increase of 10.0%. In addition, the \nactual economic benefits are likely larger than estimated as some significant types of benefits \nare not quantifiable due to data limitation. Given that the outputs do not generate revenue, \nfinancial analysis focuses on the project\u2019s fiscal impact on governments. The annual counterpart \nfinancing requirement during project implementation, as a ratio of the projected annual revenues \nof the WMG, ranges from 0.1% to 2.1%. Estimated annual loan repayment falls within the range \nof 0.02% to 0.2%. The annual operation and maintenance cost, as a ratio of the projected \nrevenue of WLMIDZMC, ranges from 1.8% to 3.0% during the first 5 years and then falls below \n1.0%. The low ratios indicate acceptable fiscal risk. Assessments of the financial management \nand institutional capacity of the WMG and WLMIDZMC, and the PMO concluded that the \nfinancial  management  systems  satisfy  ADB  requirements  and  identified  areas  that  need \nstrengthening. Capacity development measures are recommended, for the PMO in particular, to \nstrengthen capacity to implement the project in compliance with ADB policies and operational \nand procedural requirements. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n21.  The financial management assessment shows that, with capacity strengthening, the \nfinancial management arrangements  of  the WMG  finance  bureau  and WLMIDZMC  will  be \nsufficient for project implementation in terms of financial and management accounting, reporting, \nauditing, internal controls, and disbursement and cash flow management. The procurement \ncapacity  assessment  indicates  that  the  WMG  and  WLMIDZMC  (i)  have  established \narrangements for handling procurement, including bid document preparation, tender invitation, \nbid evaluation, contract award, construction supervision, and contract performance monitoring; \nand (ii) will engage a professional procurement agency experienced in managing procurement \nprocesses financed by international development institutions. Given the lack of experience in \nmanaging ADB-financed projects and familiarity with ADB policies, guidelines, and procedural \nrequirements, ADB will provide assistance and training in project management for WMG and \nWLMIDZMC staff. \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  WMG.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n23.  Employment,  livelihood,  and  poverty.  The  project  area  has  a  population  of \napproximately 113,000 who will benefit from improved livelihood from employment, capacity \ndevelopment, increased agricultural yield and productivity, and participation. The reduction in \nsoil salinity is expected to increase overall rural production value by up to CNY300 million over \n ", "8 \nthe project life, and the improvement of flood protection to reduce losses due to floods on \nfarmland by around CNY480 million. The project will directly improve agricultural productivity \nand  yields  through  improved  cropping,  farmer  field  schools,  capacity  development,  good \nagricultural practices and other measures. Capacity development on the use of the improved \nsaline soils and sustainable livelihood financed under the GEF grant will help ensure increased \nagricultural productivity from the soil improved by the rehabilitated drainage system, which will \nlead  to  improved  livelihoods  and  increased  income  of  farmers  and  villagers.  Sustainable \nlivelihood activities, e.g., community-based ecotourism, marketing, and improved value-chain for \ncrops  such  as tree  crops,  will focus  on  capacity  development for farmers  and  other  local \nbeneficiaries.  Empowerment  of  women  and  participation  of  rural  poor  and  vulnerable \nhouseholds in project design, and decision making affecting beneficiaries and local communities \nwill  be  ensured  during  project  implementation  through  the  social  and  gender  action  and \nparticipation plan. The project will benefit poor and vulnerable households that will have more \ndiverse,  nonagricultural  livelihoods,  and  improve  their  agriculture-based  livelihoods.  These \nhouseholds will benefit in particular through increased resilience to shocks such as floods. \n \n24.  The GEF grant will finance pilot activities under output 1 to test models for improved soil \nmanagement and utilization, support expansion to the larger area, and establish farmer field \nschools to spread the pilots. Under output 3, wetland ecosystem restoration, the GEF grant will \nfinance testing of options for improved saltpan management, and alternative livelihoods in \nwetlands,  including  community-based  ecotourism  and  alternative  livelihoods  for  local \ncommunities. Under the TA for Mainstreaming Environment for Poverty Reduction, ADB is \ncooperating with local civil society organizations to improve livelihoods by designing and piloting \ncapacity  development  measures  to  improve  employment  prospects  based  on  participatory \nassessment of poor households.13  \n \n25.  Gender.  Gender  design  elements  to  ensure  the  project  achieves  effective  gender \nmainstreaming  are  included  in  the  project  design  and  will  be  implemented  by  the  project \naccordingly. The social and gender action and participation plan contains features to ensure \nproject benefits are accrued by women at least as equally as by men. This will be achieved by \nensuring (i) their participation in project activities and decision making processes relevant to \ntheir communities; (ii) they benefit from employment opportunities created under the project; (iii) \nthey can and will participate in capacity development measures under the project, in particular \nthose  related  to  alternative  livelihood;  and  (iv)  they  are  included  in  capacity  development \nmeasures for project management. Plan implementation will be monitored through the collection \nof sex-disaggregated data on project activities. Selected activities under outputs 1 and 3 will \nensure households headed by women benefit at least equally from employment and training \nopportunities as other households. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n26.  Environment  (category  A).  The  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  report, \nincluding an environmental management plan (EMP) follows ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The EIA is consistent with the domestic EIA, approved on 24 July 2012 by the Shaanxi \nenvironment protection department. Consultations involved key stakeholders, including affected \npeople and local government agencies and the outcomes are integrated in the project design. \nThe draft EIA was publicly disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 8 August 2012. The WMG, through \nthe  PMO,  will  be  responsible  for  implementation  and  compliance  with  the  EMP,  including \ninspection, monitoring, reporting, and initiating corrective actions or measures. The PMO will \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for Mainstreaming Environment for Poverty Reduction. Manila (TA 6422-REG). \n ", "9 \nimplement  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  handle  disputes.  A  capacity  development \nprogram, which includes environmental monitoring, is included in the project activities. \n \n27.  Environmental benefits will be achieved through (i) designation and management of the \nLNWP, (ii) protection of natural wetland habitats, (iii) monitoring and management of migratory \nwater birds and habitats, and (iv) improved local agency capacity for wetland management. \nAdverse project impacts include (i) loss of 110 ha of habitat for some migratory water-bird \npopulations due to construction of Tianlu lake; (ii) risk of eutrophication in Tianlu and Tianjiao \nlakes; and (iii) standard construction impacts, including water, soil, air, and noise pollution. \nMeasures to address these include (i) develop and protect wetland habitats for migratory water \nbirds in the western part of the project area,14 (ii) construct new salt-pan habitat for migratory \nwater birds, (iii) incorporate additional wetland habitat in the LNWP, (iv) develop and implement \na nutrient management plan, and (v) implement standard mitigation and monitoring measures \nduring construction and operation. The EMP will be revised based on the detailed project \ndesign, if necessary. \n \n28.  Indigenous peoples (category C) and involuntary resettlement (category A). No \nethnic minorities and/or indigenous communities are present in the project area (historically \noccupied by Han, the majority of the PRC population). The project will (i) permanently acquire \napproximately 172 ha (up to 115 ha currently used to harvest saltpeter, affecting 45 people and \n57 ha of agricultural land); and (ii) temporarily acquire 514 ha, mainly for soil disposal and \nconstruction facilities. The land acquisition will affect 1,545 people, who will lose an average of \n22% of their farmland (the majority will lose 11%\u201320%, 271 will lose more than 21%). No \nresidential housing will be demolished.  \n \n29.  To mitigate the negative impacts of economic displacements, the resettlement plan \nincludes acceptable compensation standards and entitlements, external and internal monitoring, \nan implementation schedule, and budget. The grievance redress mechanism for involuntary \nresettlement will be combined with that of the EMP (para. 26). During project preparation, major \nefforts were undertaken to reduce permanent land acquisition from over 1,050 ha to the current \nnumber of 172 ha, to reduce the proportion of agricultural land from 50% to around 30%, and to \nimprove  livelihood  restoration  measures  and  provide  replacement  land.  Temporary  land \noccupation was reduced from around 730 ha to below 480 ha, needed mainly to dispose \ntemporarily of spoil from lake excavation and canal dredging. Total land acquisition costs were \nreduced significantly from around 30% to around 6% of the total project costs. The initially \nplanned acquisition of significant areas of agricultural land and saltpans for the establishment of \nwetlands was averted by (i) revising the project scope and design; and (ii) excluding large areas \ninitially planned for future development, and limiting land acquisition to land required strictly for \nproject  use.  The  establishment  of  the  LNWP  under  management  by  the  State  Forestry \nAdministration does not preclude land users from continuing their livelihood activities. According \nto the environmental assessments, the continuation of these activities will not have a negative \nimpact on the wetland, and therefore no access or other livelihood restrictions are envisioned.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.15 The integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n                                                \n14 The attached TA will support the WMG in establishing these mitigation measures (para. 19). \n15 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisk  Mitigating Measures \nTechnical risks as a result of inappropriate  Adopt innovative but proven technologies, implement a nutrient \ndesign, lack of pollution control, capacity  management plan, and provide technical assistance during project \nlimitations, and consideration of climate  design and implementation \nvariability \nFragmented implementation arrangements  Ensure the Weinan municipal government (WMG) assumes the \noversight role to ensure adequate coordination among WMG sector \nagencies, two county governments, and the Weinan Luyanghu \nModern Industry Development Zone Management Committee \n(WLMIDZMC) \nLimited sustainability because of inadequate  WMG and WLMIDZMC assure to budget for adequate operation \nfinancial income and experience in  and maintenance of project facilities. \nmaintaining the drainage and lake area. \nLoss of important habitat (salt pans) for  Construction of new salt pan habitat to maximize habitat for \nmigratory waterbirds  migratory waterbird. \nLack of local community support for  Use a participatory approach for managing the national wetland \nestablishing Luyanghu National Wetland Park  park and provide training on alternative livelihoods \nThe WMG\u2019s unfamiliarity with Asian  Provide training during project implementation to WMG and \nDevelopment Bank policies, procedures, and  WLMIDZMC staff on ADB\u2019s guidelines and policies; ensure early \nrequirements for project implementation  engagement of the procurement agency and project implementation \nconsultant \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n31.  The government and the WMG have assured ADB that implementation of the project will \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan and project agreements.  \n \n32.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the loan and project agreements.  \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n33.
