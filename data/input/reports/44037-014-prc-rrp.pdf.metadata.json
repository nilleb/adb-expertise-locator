The  project  will  support  the  Weinan  municipal \ngovernment  (WMG)  in  reducing  flood  risk,  soil  salinity,  and  waterlogging  for  an  economic \ndevelopment zone and agricultural lands in the Luyanghu area, which will directly benefit rural \ncommunities in the area. The project will also support the WMG in finalizing and implementing a \nmanagement  plan for  the  Luyanghu  National Wetland  Park  (LNWP),  in close  cooperation  with \nthe \nlocal  communities,  which  will  ensure  wetland  conservation  while  creating  new \nnonagricultural livelihood opportunities through tourism and other activities.4  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nGovernment  development  strategy.  In  2009,  the  State  Council  approved  the \nestablishment  of  the  Guanzhong\u2013Tianshui  Economic  Zone  (GTEZ),  one  of  three  economic \ndevelopment zones defined in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan for the western region.5  The GTEZ \nwill  cover  79,800  square  kilometers  (km2)  in  selected  cities  of  Shaanxi  and  Gansu  provinces \nwith construction planned from 2009 to 2020.6 By 2020 the gross domestic product output of the \nGTEZ  is  expected  to  reach  one-third  of  the  western  region.  The  municipal  government  of \nWeinan city, which is located in the east of Guanzhong Plain and part of the GTEZ, designated \nthe Luyanghu area as one of the development areas in the GTEZ. The WMG has a long-term \ndevelopment  plan  (2007\u20132025)  for  the  Luyanghu  area  to  attract  high-technology  industrial \ninvestment,  promote  tourism,  and  create  job  opportunities.  In  December  2007,  the  WMG \nestablished the Weinan Luyanghu Modern Industry Development Zone Management Committee \n(WLMIDZMC)  to  coordinate  development  efforts,  and  the  Weinan  Luyang  Construction \nDevelopment Company to be responsible for infrastructure improvement. \n \nLuyanghu  comprises  a  total  watershed  of  1,123  km2  across  Fuping  and  Pucheng \n4. \ncounties.  It  is  a  national  poverty  area.  In  2012,  the  population  of  the  project  area  is \napproximately 113,000, mostly rural villagers; approximately 30% of rural households live below \n\n                                                \n1  The original title was \u2015Shaanxi Weinan Luyang Integrated Saline and Alkaline Land Management Project.\u2016 \n2   Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n4  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2010.Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic \nof  China  for  Preparing  the  Shaanxi  Weinan  Luyang  Integrated  Saline  and  Alkaline  Land  Management  Project. \nManila. \n\n5  The policy covers (i) six provinces: Gansu, Guizhou, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan; (ii) five autonomous \nregions: Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia,  Xizang (also known as Tibet Autonomous Region), and Xinjiang; and \n(iii) one municipality: Chongqing. In 2009, this region comprised 71.4% of mainland People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s \narea, but only 28.8% of its population and 19.9% of its total economic output.  \n\n6  ADB also finances the Gansu Tianshui Urban Infrastructure Development Project, which aims to enable Tianshui \n\ncity to meet urbanization pressures and maximize Guangzhong\u2013Tianshui Economic Zone-related benefits.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nthe Weinan municipal poverty line of CNY2,500. Their 2010 average per capita income was only \nCNY4,372,  one-third  lower  than  the  Shaanxi  provincial  average  and  roughly  a  quarter  of  the \naverage annual income of urban residents in the same municipality. Agricultural productivity is \nlow because of poor soil conditions and drainage problems. Local residents grow limited wheat \nand corn crops, with production only half of that in other areas of Weinan city. A small but active \nsalt-harvesting and processing industry continues and needs to be preserved. \n \n5. \nLand  management. The decades-long poor environmental conditions of the Luyanghu \narea  are  mainly  due  to  long-term  problems  of  saline  soil,  high  groundwater  tables,  poor \ndrainage systems, and subsequent flooding problems. The groundwater table is approximately \n0\u20133 meters below the surface. The salt and mineral content of groundwater and soil is now very \nhigh in certain areas, significantly reducing agricultural productivity.  In 1974, to reduce the salt \ncontent and improve agricultural productivity, the government established the Luoxi desalination \ndrainage system, which comprises one main desalination drainage channel, four subcanals, and \nbranch and secondary branch drainage channels. The system serves an area of approximately \n212  km2.  Due  to  insufficient  investment,  the  original  design  of  the  desalination  system  was  of \npoor quality, and lack of maintenance made the system ineffective to reduce soil salinity.  \n \n6. \nThe  WMG  envisages  a  balanced  approach  to  promoting  and  protecting  the  economic \ndevelopment  zone  (covering  approximately  15  km2),  while  improving  the  natural  environment \nand supporting rural livelihoods in the surrounding agricultural lands of approximately 186 km2. \nSpecific interventions needed to ensure sustained economic growth include (i) rehabilitation of \nthe Luoxi desalination drainage system to remove salts from the soil, (ii) improvement of flood \nstorage capacity of Luyanghu area to reduce flood risks to local residents and the development \nzone,  and  (iii)  rehabilitation  and  conservation  of  the  remaining  wetland  environment.  The \nShaanxi provincial government (SPG) initiated establishment of the LNWP and prepared a draft \nmaster plan, but no further activities have been carried out.  \n \nConsistency  with  country  partnership  strategy.  The project supports ADB's country \n7. \npartnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  the  PRC, 7  which  is  based  on  the  pillars  of  Strategy  2020: \ninclusive growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional cooperation and integration. \nNatural resources and agriculture is a CPS priority sector. ADB provides lending and technical \nassistance  to  contribute  to  sound  land,  water,  and  natural  resources  management  that  also \nsupport rural livelihood improvement. In particular, ADB promotes innovative and demonstration \nprojects where ADB can play a catalytic role in addressing poverty, rising income inequality, and \nwidening regional  disparities. The  project  will  support  priorities  of the  PRC's Twelfth  Five-Year \nPlan, 2011\u20132015, particularly efforts to move to a greener and more inclusive development path.  \n \n8. \nThe  project  complements  ongoing  support  to  Shaanxi  province,  including  the  Shaanxi \nQinling  Biodiversity  Conservation  and  Demonstration  Project,  and  the  Forestry  and  Ecological \nRestoration  Project  in  Three  Northwest  Provinces.8 These  projects  demonstrate  the  important \nrole that  ADB  plays  to  introduce  innovative  and  good  practices  to  strengthen  sustainable  land \nmanagement  and  biodiversity  conservation.  ADB  also  served  as  the  lead  GEF  agency  for  the \nPRC\u2013GEF  Partnership  on  Land  Degradation  in  Dryland  Ecosystems,  which  ensured  that \nsignificant institutional capacity has been built in the central government, participating provinces, \nand  autonomous  regions,  including  Shaanxi  province.

Output  1  will  reduce  soil  salinity  over \n10. \napproximately  212  km2  and  increase  productivity  and  climate  resilience  of  approximately  186 \nkm2 of agricultural land. It has two components: (i) rehabilitation of Luoxi drainage system, and \n(ii)  support  for  improving  resilience  to  climate  change  of  agro-ecosystems.  Under  the  first \ncomponent, activities include (i) dredging and rehabilitating  approximately 46.9 km of the main \ndesalination  drainage  channels;  (ii)  dredging  approximately  90.3  km  of  the  branch  and \nsecondary  branch  drainage  channels;  (iii) rehabilitating  approximately  450  small  structures, \nincluding approximately 153 bridges, 69 culverts, 54 aqueducts, and 174 flow confluences; (iv) \nconstructing  and  rehabilitating  approximately  35.6 km  of  rural  roads;  (v)  testing  at  least  10 \ninnovative  and  replicable  best  practices  for  rehabilitating  saline  soil  approximately  over  100 \nhectares (ha), including discussions with farmers on implementation arrangements and support \nfor  implementation  over  the  larger  project  area;  and  (vi)  providing  training  on  saline  land \nmanagement to support expansion to a larger area. Under the second component, support will \nbe  provided  to  (i)  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  local  communities  to  climate  change  through \nenhanced provision of regulating ecosystem services, such as water and temperature regulation \nand  soil  retention,  and  (ii)  local  farmers  to  improve  crop  productivity  in  the  approximately  186 \nkm2  of  agricultural  areas  where  drainage  will  be  improved.  Activities  to  support  improved \nresilience  to  climate  change  include  (i) testing  of  at  least  two  innovative  and  replicable  best \npractices for the establishment of shelter belts (covering approximately 2 ha); (ii) construction of \napproximately  130  ha  of  greenbelts;  and  (iii)  support  for  farmers  to  market  their  products  and \nincrease alternative income generating livelihood. Suitable activities\u2014particularly items (v) and \n(vi)  under  the  first  component,  and  item  (iii)  under  the  second  component\u2014will  also  target \nhouseholds headed by women to ensure that they equally benefit from the project.  \n \nOutput  2:  Flood risk  management implemented.  Output 2 will improve flood storage \n11. \ncapacity of Luyanghu area to reduce flood risks to local residents. It includes (i) construction of \nTianlu lake (approximately 130 ha), connecting Tianjiao lake in the west, a middle main channel, \nand  a  central  main  channel;  and  (ii)  construction  of  approximately  18.6  km  of  dike  with  road \naround Tianlu lake. Combined with Tianjiao lake, the project will provide flood storage capacity \nof 5.4 million cubic meters to protect against flood events, with maximum capacity of 12.6 million \ncubic meters to protect against a 50-year flood event. The integrated and innovative approach \ncombining flood risk management with drainage system rehabilitation and wetlands ecosystem \nconservation will contribute to reduced flood risk for the Luyanghu area.  \n \n12. \nOutput  3:  Wetland  ecosystem  conservation  established.  Output  3  has  two \ncomponents:  (i)  support  for  LNWP  development;  and  (ii)  promotion  of  tourism,  livelihood,  and \nemployment  opportunities  for  local  communities.  The  wetlands  conservation  will  reverse \necosystem  degradation  caused  by  agricultural  encroachment  and  other  pressures  associated \nwith  the  increasing  population  within  the  project  area.  The  first  component  will  (i)  rehabilitate \napproximately  860  ha  of  degraded  wetlands;  (ii)  prepare  and  support  implementation  of  the \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nLNWP  master  plan  for  approximately  1,070  ha;  (iii)  establish  a  wetland  management  training \nfacility;  (iv)  test  at  least  two  innovative  and  replicable  best  practices  in  wetland  rehabilitation \n(covering  approximately  10  ha);  and  (v)  train  50  officials  on  wetland  environment  and \nmanagement. The  second  component  will  support  the  development  of ecotourism focusing  on \nthe  ecological  values  of  the  wetlands  and  the  cultural  heritage  of  salt  harvesting  in  the  area. \nTraining on livelihood skills will be provided for approximately 1,000 villagers, at least 50% will \nbe women, and be primarily targeted at people displaced due to land acquisition.  \n \nOutput  4:  Capacity  development  and  project  implementation  support  provided. \n13. \nOutput  4  has  two  components:  (i)  institutional  strengthening,  and  (ii)  project  management \nsupport during project implementation. The first will support capacity development and training \nof WMG  and WLMIDZMC  staff  in  ADB  project  management  procedures,  technical  design  and \nimplementation,  and  safeguard  supervision  and  monitoring.  The  introduction  of  12  GEF-\nfinanced innovative best practices for sustainable land and wetland management, together with \nthe  international  consulting  services,  will  significantly  strengthen  WMG  capacity.  The  second \ncomponent  will  provide  overall  project  implementation  support  for  the WMG  and WLMIDZMC, \nincluding implementation of land acquisition and resettlement.  \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $165.2  million  (Table  1).

The impact will be improved management of wetlands for migratory waterbird populations \nin  Shaanxi  province.  The  outcome  will  be  strengthened  capacity  of  Weinan  municipality  to \nmitigate  impacts  on  migratory  waterbirds  and  their  habitats  in  Luyanghu  area.  The  TA  will \ncontribute to the implementation of output 3 and the preparation of the project\u2019s environmental \nmonitoring  plan.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $450,000,  of  which  $350,000  equivalent  will  be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund 12  under  the  Water  Financing \nPartnership Facility, and administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support \nin  the  form  of  remuneration  and  per  diem  of  counterpart  staff,  miscellaneous  administrative \nsupport, office accommodation, local transport, and other in-kind contributions. ADB will finance \nand  engage  three  consultants  to  support  the  WMG\u2014international  (5  person-months)  and \nnational  (10  person-months)\u2014in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time) using the individual consultant selection method. The TA \nwill be implemented from 1 July 2013 to 31 December 2014. The TA proceeds will be disbursed \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). The TA is described in detail in the PAM. Equipment purchased under the TA \nwill  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from \ntime to time) and transferred to the WMG upon TA completion. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \nDue diligence assessed the project\u2019s technical feasibility and sustainability. The WMG\u2019s \n19. \ndomestic feasibility  study  report  is technically  sound  and  provides  sufficient  information  on  the \ndesign  feasibility.  International  and  national  consulting  services  will  provide  the  necessary \ntechnical support to ensure that international best practices are integrated into the final detailed \ndesign, and are applied during construction and implementation. The design to rehabilitate the \ndrainage system is consistent with the original layout of the 1974 system, but will correct design \nfeatures that rendered the current system ineffective: the current gradients of the main channels \nare too low and no secondary branch channels or field ditches were provided. The flood control \ninfrastructure is designed to protect against a 10-year flood event over 18,600 ha, and a 50-year \nflood  event  over  1,500  ha  of  the  industrial  and  commercial  development  zone.  The  wetland \n\n                                                \n12  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. \n\n \n\n\ffor \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\necological conservation activities are based on the WMG\u2019s 2012 draft wetland master plan. GEF \nwill provide international and national consulting services to start implementation and strengthen \nthe master plan. \n \nB. \n \nThe economic analysis indicates that the project is economically viable, with an overall \n20. \neconomic \ninternal  rate  of  return  of  15.2%  and  an  economic  net  present  value  of \nCNY233.5 million.  The  rates  of  return  for  individual  outputs  are  14.3%  for  saline  soil \nrehabilitation,  15.6% \nfor  wetland  ecosystem \nflood  risk  management,  and  14.2% \nconservation.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  project  is  generally  robust  to  potential \nvariations  in  costs  and  benefits.  The  project  remains  economically  viable  even  with  a \ncombination of a benefit decline of 10.0% and a capital cost increase of 10.0%. In addition, the \nactual  economic  benefits  are  likely  larger  than estimated  as some  significant types  of  benefits \nare  not  quantifiable  due  to  data  limitation.  Given  that  the  outputs  do  not  generate  revenue, \nfinancial analysis focuses on the project\u2019s fiscal impact on governments. The annual counterpart \nfinancing requirement during project implementation, as a ratio of the projected annual revenues \nof the WMG, ranges from 0.1% to 2.1%. Estimated annual loan repayment falls within the range \nof  0.02%  to  0.2%.  The  annual  operation  and  maintenance  cost,  as  a  ratio  of  the  projected \nrevenue of WLMIDZMC, ranges from 1.8% to 3.0% during the first 5 years and then falls below \n1.0%. The low ratios indicate acceptable fiscal risk. Assessments of the financial management \nand  institutional  capacity  of  the  WMG  and  WLMIDZMC,  and  the  PMO  concluded  that  the \nfinancial  management  systems  satisfy  ADB  requirements  and  identified  areas  that  need \nstrengthening. Capacity development measures are recommended, for the PMO in particular, to \nstrengthen  capacity  to  implement  the  project  in compliance  with  ADB  policies  and  operational \nand procedural requirements. \n \nC. \n \n21. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  shows  that,  with  capacity  strengthening,  the \nfinancial  management  arrangements  of  the  WMG  finance  bureau  and  WLMIDZMC  will  be \nsufficient for project implementation in terms of financial and management accounting, reporting, \nauditing,  internal  controls,  and  disbursement  and  cash  flow  management.  The  procurement \ncapacity  assessment \nthe  WMG  and  WLMIDZMC  (i)  have  established \narrangements  for  handling  procurement,  including  bid  document  preparation,  tender  invitation, \nbid evaluation, contract award, construction supervision, and contract performance monitoring; \nand (ii) will engage a professional procurement agency experienced in managing procurement \nprocesses  financed  by  international  development  institutions.  Given  the  lack  of  experience  in \nmanaging  ADB-financed  projects  and  familiarity  with  ADB  policies,  guidelines,  and  procedural \nrequirements,  ADB  will  provide  assistance  and  training  in  project  management  for  WMG  and \nWLMIDZMC staff. \n \n22. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  WMG.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n23. \nEmployment,  livelihood,  and  poverty.  The  project  area  has  a  population  of \napproximately  113,000  who  will  benefit  from  improved  livelihood  from  employment,  capacity \ndevelopment,  increased  agricultural  yield  and  productivity,  and  participation.  The  reduction  in \nsoil salinity is expected to increase overall rural production value by up to CNY300 million over \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nGovernance \n\nindicates \n\nthat \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nincluding  community-based  ecotourism  and  alternative \n\nthe  project  life,  and  the  improvement  of  flood  protection  to  reduce  losses  due  to  floods  on \nfarmland  by  around  CNY480  million.  The  project  will  directly  improve  agricultural  productivity \nand  yields  through  improved  cropping,  farmer  field  schools,  capacity  development,  good \nagricultural  practices  and  other  measures.  Capacity  development  on  the  use  of  the  improved \nsaline soils and sustainable livelihood financed under the GEF grant will help ensure increased \nagricultural productivity from the soil improved by the rehabilitated drainage system, which will \nlead  to  improved  livelihoods  and  increased  income  of  farmers  and  villagers.  Sustainable \nlivelihood activities, e.g., community-based ecotourism, marketing, and improved value-chain for \ncrops  such  as  tree  crops,  will  focus  on  capacity  development  for  farmers  and  other  local \nbeneficiaries.  Empowerment  of  women  and  participation  of  rural  poor  and  vulnerable \nhouseholds in project design, and decision making affecting beneficiaries and local communities \nwill  be  ensured  during  project  implementation  through  the  social  and  gender  action  and \nparticipation  plan.  The  project  will  benefit  poor  and  vulnerable  households  that  will  have  more \ndiverse,  nonagricultural  livelihoods,  and  improve  their  agriculture-based  livelihoods.  These \nhouseholds will benefit in particular through increased resilience to shocks such as floods. \n \nThe GEF grant will finance pilot activities under output 1 to test models for improved soil \n24. \nmanagement  and  utilization,  support  expansion  to  the  larger  area,  and  establish  farmer  field \nschools to spread the pilots. Under output 3, wetland ecosystem restoration, the GEF grant will \nfinance  testing  of  options  for  improved  saltpan  management,  and  alternative  livelihoods  in \nlocal \nwetlands, \ncommunities.  Under  the  TA  for  Mainstreaming  Environment  for  Poverty  Reduction,  ADB  is \ncooperating with local civil society organizations to improve livelihoods by designing and piloting \ncapacity  development  measures  to  improve  employment  prospects  based  on  participatory \nassessment of poor households.13  \n \n25. \nGender.  Gender  design  elements  to  ensure  the  project  achieves  effective  gender \nmainstreaming  are  included  in  the  project  design  and  will  be  implemented  by  the  project \naccordingly.  The  social  and  gender  action  and  participation  plan  contains  features  to  ensure \nproject benefits are accrued by women at least as equally as by men. This will be achieved by \nensuring  (i)  their  participation  in  project  activities  and  decision  making  processes  relevant  to \ntheir communities; (ii) they benefit from employment opportunities created under the project; (iii) \nthey can and will participate in capacity  development measures under the project, in particular \nthose  related  to  alternative  livelihood;  and  (iv)  they  are  included  in  capacity  development \nmeasures for project management. Plan implementation will be monitored through the collection \nof  sex-disaggregated  data  on  project  activities.  Selected  activities  under  outputs  1  and  3  will \nensure  households  headed  by  women  benefit  at  least  equally  from  employment  and  training \nopportunities as other households. \n \nE. \n \n26. \nEnvironment  (category  A).  The  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  report, \nincluding an environmental management plan (EMP) follows ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The EIA is consistent with the domestic EIA, approved on 24 July 2012 by the Shaanxi \nenvironment protection department. Consultations involved key stakeholders, including affected \npeople and  local government  agencies  and  the outcomes  are  integrated  in the  project  design. \nThe draft EIA was publicly disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 8 August 2012. The WMG, through \nthe  PMO,  will  be  responsible  for  implementation  and  compliance  with  the  EMP,  including \ninspection,  monitoring,  reporting,  and  initiating  corrective  actions  or  measures.  The  PMO  will \n\nSafeguards \n\nlivelihoods \n\nfor \n\n                                                \n13 ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for Mainstreaming Environment for Poverty Reduction. Manila (TA 6422-REG). \n\n\fimplement  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  handle  disputes.  A  capacity  development \nprogram, which includes environmental monitoring, is included in the project activities. \n \n27. \nEnvironmental benefits will be achieved through (i) designation and management of the \nLNWP, (ii) protection of natural wetland habitats, (iii) monitoring and management of migratory \nwater  birds  and  habitats,  and  (iv)  improved  local  agency  capacity  for  wetland  management. \nAdverse  project  impacts  include  (i)  loss  of  110  ha  of  habitat  for  some  migratory  water-bird \npopulations  due  to  construction  of  Tianlu  lake;  (ii)  risk  of  eutrophication  in  Tianlu  and Tianjiao \nlakes;  and  (iii)  standard  construction  impacts,  including  water,  soil,  air,  and  noise  pollution. \nMeasures to address these include (i) develop and protect wetland habitats for migratory water \nbirds  in  the  western  part  of  the  project  area,14 (ii)  construct  new  salt-pan  habitat  for  migratory \nwater birds, (iii) incorporate additional wetland habitat in the LNWP, (iv) develop and implement \na  nutrient  management  plan,  and  (v)  implement  standard  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures \nduring  construction  and  operation.  The  EMP  will  be  revised  based  on  the  detailed  project \ndesign, if necessary. \n \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C)  and  involuntary  resettlement  (category  A).  No \n28. \nethnic  minorities  and/or  indigenous  communities  are  present  in  the  project  area  (historically \noccupied by Han, the majority of the PRC population). The project will (i) permanently acquire \napproximately 172 ha (up to 115 ha currently used to harvest saltpeter, affecting 45 people and \n57  ha  of  agricultural  land);  and  (ii)  temporarily  acquire  514 ha,  mainly  for  soil  disposal  and \nconstruction facilities. The land acquisition will affect 1,545 people, who will lose an average of \n22%  of  their  farmland  (the  majority  will  lose  11%\u201320%,  271  will  lose  more  than  21%).  No \nresidential housing will be demolished.  \n \n29. \nTo  mitigate  the  negative  impacts  of  economic  displacements,  the  resettlement  plan \nincludes acceptable compensation standards and entitlements, external and internal monitoring, \nan  implementation  schedule,  and  budget.  The  grievance  redress  mechanism  for  involuntary \nresettlement will be combined with that of the EMP (para. 26). During project preparation, major \nefforts were undertaken to reduce permanent land acquisition from over 1,050 ha to the current \nnumber of 172 ha, to reduce the proportion of agricultural land from 50% to around 30%, and to \nimprove  livelihood  restoration  measures  and  provide  replacement  land.  Temporary  land \noccupation  was  reduced  from  around  730  ha  to  below  480  ha,  needed  mainly  to  dispose \ntemporarily of spoil from lake excavation and canal dredging. Total land acquisition costs were \nreduced  significantly  from  around  30%  to  around  6%  of  the  total  project  costs.  The  initially \nplanned acquisition of significant areas of agricultural land and saltpans for the establishment of \nwetlands was averted by (i) revising the project scope and design; and (ii) excluding large areas \ninitially planned for future development, and limiting land acquisition to land required strictly for \nproject  use.  The  establishment  of  the  LNWP  under  management  by  the  State  Forestry \nAdministration does not preclude land users from continuing their livelihood activities. According \nto the environmental assessments, the continuation of these activities will not have a negative \nimpact on the wetland, and therefore no access or other livelihood restrictions are envisioned.  \n \nF. \n \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.15 The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n                                                \n14 The attached TA will support the WMG in establishing these mitigation measures (para. 19). \n15 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisk \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigating Measures \n\nTechnical risks as a result of inappropriate \ndesign, lack of pollution control, capacity \nlimitations, and consideration of climate \nvariability \n\nFragmented implementation arrangements \n\nLimited sustainability because of inadequate \nfinancial income and experience in \nmaintaining the drainage and lake area. \n\nAdopt innovative but proven technologies, implement a nutrient \nmanagement plan, and provide technical assistance during project \ndesign and implementation \n\nEnsure the Weinan municipal government (WMG) assumes the \noversight role to ensure adequate coordination among WMG sector \nagencies, two county governments, and the Weinan Luyanghu \nModern Industry Development Zone Management Committee \n(WLMIDZMC) \n\nWMG and WLMIDZMC assure to budget for adequate operation \nand maintenance of project facilities. \n\nLoss of important habitat (salt pans) for \nmigratory waterbirds \n\nConstruction of new salt pan habitat to maximize habitat for \nmigratory waterbird. \n\nLack of local community support for \nestablishing Luyanghu National Wetland Park \n\nUse a participatory approach for managing the national wetland \npark and provide training on alternative livelihoods \n\nThe WMG\u2019s unfamiliarity with Asian \nDevelopment Bank policies, procedures, and \nrequirements for project implementation \n\nProvide training during project implementation to WMG and \nWLMIDZMC staff on ADB\u2019s guidelines and policies;
