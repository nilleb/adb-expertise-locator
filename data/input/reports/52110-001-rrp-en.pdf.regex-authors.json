THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Uzbekistan for the Livestock Value Chain Development Project. \n \n2.  The proposed project will support the development of livestock value chains by increasing \nthe outreach of participating financial institutions (PFIs) to livestock farmers and entrepreneurs \nthroughout the country. It will improve access to market-based, long-term finance for producers, \nprocessing enterprises, input suppliers, and service providers in the livestock value chain. The \nproject will help increase livestock productivity, sustainability, processing capacity and utilization; \nas well as marketing of inputs and livestock products. It will facilitate the development of private \nsector  veterinary  practices  to  improve  access  to  clinical  veterinary  services  and  animal \nmanagement and health advice. This will in turn promote long-term economic and environmental \nsustainability and enhance profitability for producers and agribusiness enterprises. Together with \nongoing Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance in horticulture value chain development, the \nproject will help diversify the country\u2019s agriculture from cotton production to high-value agricultural \nproducts that generate better financial and economic returns, and have fewer associated social \nand environmental concerns.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Sector performance. Uzbekistan\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by at least 8.0% \nper year during 2007\u20132014.2 Growth has subsequently slowed\u2014GDP grew by 5.1% in 2018, \nreaching $48.7 billion, with growth projected to rise to 5.2% in 2019 and 5.5% in 2020.3 Lower \ngrowth rates in 2018 reflected weak agricultural performance, the impact of the devaluation of the \nUzbek sum in September 2017, and reduced domestic demand. The generally high growth rates \nsince  2000  have  helped  reduce  poverty\u2014according  to  national  poverty  line  estimates, the \nproportion of people defined as poor declined from 27.5% of the population in 2001 to 11.6% in \n2018.4 However, the unemployment rate has increased from 5.2% in 2016 to 9.3% in 2018.5 In \nline with total GDP growth, agriculture output grew an annual rate of 6.4%\u20137.2% from 2010 to \n2016, but the growth rate fell to 1.2% in 2017 and is estimated at 0.2% in 2018, largely as a result \nof poor rainfall that cut the cereal harvest by 12.5% and broader crop production by 4.5%. When \ncombined with higher rates of growth in other sectors (industry grew by 4.8% and services by \n6.4% in 2017), the low rate of growth in agriculture contributed to the continuing decline in \nagriculture\u2019s contribution to GDP, from 34.4% in 2000 to 19.2% in 2017. Agriculture\u2019s share of \ntotal employment has also declined, although more slowly: in 2000, agriculture accounted for \n36.7% of total employment, which fell to 27.2% in 2017. Agriculture remains an important source \nof employment and income, especially in rural areas, which are home to 49% of the population, \nand 75% of people living below the national poverty line. \n \n4.  Livestock development. In 2016, the livestock subsector accounts for 40% of agriculture \ngross value added, which equates to about 8% of total GDP.6 Within livestock, dairy production \nmakes up 45% of livestock gross value added. Livestock production grew 4.2% in 2017 and 6.5% \n                                                \n1  ADB. Preparing the Livestock Value Chain Development Project. \n2  ADB. 2018.

Tashkent. \n ", "2 \nin 2018, outpacing the growth in agriculture overall. Despite this growth in production, Uzbekistan \nhas a trade deficit in livestock products, although this has improved since 2015.7 In 2017, \nUzbekistan imported $86.4 million in livestock products and exported only $11.2 million, resulting \nin a trade deficit of $75.2 million, down from $123.6 million in 2015. \n \n5.  In 2018, livestock production included 2.42 million tons of meat (live weight), 10.48 million \ntons of milk, 7.36 billion eggs, and 35,000 tons of wool (footnote 6). Most livestock owners and \nproducers are small in scale, accounting for about 90% of total production (95% of milk, 94% of \nmeat, and 55% of eggs). However, productivity on small farms is low. Milk yields, for instance, \naverage 1,300 liters per lactation or about 6 liters per day, compared with an international average \nof 22 liters per day. When combined with poor cooling and distribution infrastructure, this means \nsmall farms are not well integrated into supply chains. A number of key constraints need to be \naddressed for small farms to increase productivity and for the livestock subsector to realize its \npotential. \n \n6.  Limited supply of fodder and feed. The emphasis on cotton and wheat production has \nin the past adversely affected the production of fodder. The area under fodder has historically \nbeen less than 5% of arable land. This severely limits the supply of fodder and is well below the \ncontribution of livestock to agricultural output. The relaxation of production quotas for cotton and \nwheat, and the use of irrigated land for crops other than cotton and wheat, should facilitate an \nincrease in fodder production that will help address current shortages. However, the allocation of \nland remains tightly controlled by local government administrations, and insecurity of land tenure \nis a concern for many farmers. There is also limited knowledge of how to effectively grow, harvest, \nand store feed and fodder, especially silage. \n \n7.  Weak capacity of aggregators and processors. While aggregators and processors play \nan essential role in the livestock supply chain, they lack capacity to expand physical outreach and \nincrease the scale of operations and/or product diversification. The growth of supermarkets in \nmajor urban centers has promoted the development of processing facilities, notably for milk and \nmilk products, although there is limited access to milk supplies, processing and packaging \ntechnology, and inputs. Increasing the productivity and incomes of small farm producers depends \non their links to processing facilities, either directly or\u2014particularly for milk producers\u2014through a \nnetwork of collection centers. However, many producers have no access to local collection points \nand travel long distances each day to deliver milk to processors. As a result, about two-thirds of \nmilk and dairy products are consumed at home, with the rest sold directly to households or at \nlocal markets. \n \n8.  Sporadic support services. Veterinary services are provided through a combination of \npublic and a limited number of private sector services. In the public sector, the State Committee \nfor Veterinary and Livestock Development is largely responsible for the control of major livestock \ndiseases, but lacks sufficient staff and equipment, notably in its laboratories. The government\u2019s \npolicy of shifting veterinary services delivery to the private sector is a positive step, but the \ntransition process lacks definition, and the pace of change is slow. Small livestock owners and/or \nfarmers, who constitute the majority of livestock producers, continue to lack adequate access to \neffective veterinary services. Livestock research and extension services are under-resourced, \nwith the main state providers facing shortages of skilled staff and modern, appropriate laboratory \nand field equipment. \n \n                                                \n7  International Trade Centre. International Trade Statistics 2001\u20132019 (accessed 30 April 2019). Data are based on \nthe 4-digit harmonized system, product codes 01 to 05. Data for 2018 are not available. \n ", "3 \n9.  Limited access to finance. Limited access to both equity and long-term debt finance for \nproducers and enterprises along the livestock value chain is a key constraint to the development \nof the subsector. The credit received by the subsector is disproportionately low compared with its \ncontribution to GDP. Aggregate livestock lending accounted for 1% of banks\u2019 loan portfolios in \n2018, while the subsector contributed about 8% of GDP. The limited assets and financial capacity \nof small farmers limits their access to formal financial institutions, forcing them to self-finance or \ndepend on informal sources. Contract farming arrangements with processors have the potential \nto better integrate such farms into the livestock value chain and could facilitate improvement in \nproductivity, both in individual farms and for the subsector as a whole. However, lack of access \nto long-term debt financing has prohibited processors from expanding business linkages both \nupstream and downstream. The demand for credit in the livestock subsector is estimated at about \n$3.2 billion for 2019\u20132021.8 \n \n10.  Climate change. Uzbekistan has a continental, subtropical climate that is arid, with an \nabundance of heat and sunlight, and sharp day\u2013night and winter\u2013summer temperature variations. \nThe number of cattle has increased by about 2.5 times since 1991, which has implications for \nclimate change. Agriculture accounted for 10.7% of total greenhouse gas emissions in Uzbekistan \nin 2018, with livestock contributing through enteric fermentation and animal manure. Changes in \nthe temperature regime will  place thermal stress on animals, decreasing their immunity to \ndisease, while changes in animals\u2019 usual living environment will lead to physical overheating or \novercooling. Changes in precipitation will reduce moisture availability and lower fodder crop yields \non rain-fed land and fodder phytomass on pastures. Lack of moisture together with increasing \nanthropogenic load will increase pressure on natural pastures and induce degradation and \nabandonment of rain-fed land. Changes in the temperature regime, precipitation amount, and air \nhumidity may stimulate outbursts of plant and animal diseases and the propagation of certain pest \nvarieties. Increasing frequency of droughts will also reduce pasture productivity. Against this \nbackdrop, the project design incorporated appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures to \nminimize risks of reduced productivity and quality of fodder production, pasture management, \nlivestock production, and processing.9 \n \n11.  Government strategy. The government\u2019s development priorities include modernization \nand intensive development of agriculture as important priorities,10 including through (i) continuing \nstructural  reforms  and  production  diversification;  (ii)  mechanization,  improvement  of \ninfrastructure, and development of agribusiness; (iii) more productive land and water use; (iv) \ngreater financial stability of farm entities; and (v) more market-oriented agricultural policies. The \nlivestock subsector is considered a key driver of agricultural and rural development and several \ngovernment initiatives have given impetus to livestock activities.11 Presidential Decree No. UP-\n5696, dated 28 March 2019, acknowledged that the current situation in Uzbekistan\u2019s regions \nrequires the implementation of specific comprehensive measures to support livestock enterprises, \nincrease  feed  supply,  and  improve  breeding  by  developing  artificial  insemination  and \nstrengthening breeding farms. The feed and fodder constraint is to be addressed specifically by \nallocating land from the reserves of district local administrations for the production of fodder crops. \n \n                                                \n8  Estimates provided by the Agency for Implementation of Projects in the Field of Agro-Industry and Food Security, \nbased on submissions by regional administrations. \n9  Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 Government  of  Uzbekistan.  2017.

ADB and development partner assistance. ADB has provided significant support to \nagriculture through policy reforms and irrigation and drainage system rehabilitation. Since 2016, \nthrough PFIs, ADB has supported private sector development in agriculture. The Horticulture \nValue Chain Development Project (including its additional financing) has significantly increased \naccess to medium- and long-term finance for horticulture value chain strengthening.12 As of July \n2019, the loan funds have almost been utilized due to proper project designs and appropriate \nimplementation arrangements. The performance of these projects have been rated as \u201con track\u201d. \nAgriculture  is  also  supported  by  the  World  Bank,  the  International  Fund  for  Agriculture \nDevelopment, the European Commission, and the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD). \nThe World Bank has implemented two rural enterprise support projects that included support for \nsmall food-processing enterprises, poultry production, and fisheries. Together with the European \nCommission, it is helping small farmers and small- and medium-sized enterprises to improve \nlivestock production and supply chain management by improving access to finance and extension \nservices. The International Fund for Agriculture Development has provided support to develop \nrural enterprises and strengthen dairy value chains by providing funds for microfinance loans and \nfield extension support. AFD is preparing a project to enhance financial inclusion in the livestock \nsubsector.  The  project  will  support  livestock  policy  reforms,  institutional  development,  and \nincreased access to finance for small farmers through three financing mechanisms: credit through \nPFIs, and grants and risk-sharing (partial guarantee) for farmers without adequate collateral. \nThere is clear synergy with the AFD-financed project, which will provide access to finance for \nsmall producers to complement contract farming arrangements with processors financed under \nthe proposed project. \n  \n13.  Despite past and ongoing livestock subsector support, there is significant unmet demand \nfor long-term finance by medium and large agribusiness enterprises to invest in expanding \ncapacity and promoting vertical and horizontal integration along the livestock value chain. In \naddition, there is a critical need to enhance public and private veterinary services to undertake \nrisk assessment, risk management, and control of animal diseases. In this context, the project \ndesign  has  been  coordinated  with  key  development  initiatives  of  the  government  and \ndevelopment partners to complement and optimize synergies with past and ongoing efforts.13 \n \n14.  Lessons and ADB\u2019s value addition. The project design reflects lessons from past and \nongoing projects funded by ADB and development partners in agriculture, livestock, and finance. \nKey lessons call for (i) diversifying away from cotton\u2013wheat crop rotation, (ii) investing in modern \nproduction systems, (iii) designing projects based on an analysis of agricultural demand and \nsocioeconomic needs, (iv) focusing on high-impact stakeholder segments that can promote \nmarket linkages, and (v) keeping project implementation arrangements simple. These lessons \nalso emphasize the importance of (i) addressing the entire value chain to ensure cost-efficient \nlogistical capacity, (ii) designing financing programs that are relevant to the size and scope of \npotential sub-borrowers\u2019 demand, and (iii) applying a demand-driven approach to commercial \nfinancing. Together with ADB\u2019s assistance in horticulture value chain development, the project \nwill support the implementation of the government\u2019s agricultural diversification strategy, which will \ngenerate higher financial and economic returns, reduce social costs and the fiscal burden, and \nraise  fewer  social  and  environmental  concerns.  In  addition,  enhancing  public  and  private \nveterinary services will significantly enhance the capacity to assess and manage animal health \nand control diseases, which helps minimize risks to human health. \n \n                                                \n12 ADB Uzbekistan.

Potential for enhancing women\u2019s entrepreneurship. Women have a prominent role in \nagricultural production, but they are mainly engaged in simple, nontechnical work. In 2018, \nwomen accounted for 52.6% of agricultural workers but farms led by women accounted for only \n5.8% of the total. While rural women and female small farmers are an important part of the \nlivestock value chain, they face difficulties in establishing businesses and finding formal jobs \nbecause  of  a  lack  of  professional  skills,  access  to  information,  and  finance;  and  limited \nentrepreneurship  and  leadership  skills.  There  is  significant  potential  for  job  creation  and \nentrepreneurship for women in the livestock subsector if key constraints\u2014such as access to \ninputs, support services, finance, information, and training\u2014are addressed. \n \n16.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and country partnership strategy. The project \nis aligned with the Strategy 2030 operational priority area on promoting rural development and \nfood  security,  which  includes  market  connectivity  and  agricultural  value  chain  linkages, \nagricultural productivity, and food security and safety.14 ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, \n2019\u20132023 for Uzbekistan supports the country\u2019s transformation into a modern industrial and \nservice  economy  through  sustained  and  inclusive  growth,  reduced  poverty,  and  expanded \nregional cooperation.15 The project is in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2019\u20132021.16 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n17.  The impact will be contribution of agriculture to inclusive economic growth, incomes, and \nemployment increased (footnote 10). The outcome will be production and marketing of livestock \nproducts increased.17 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n18.  Output 1: Access to finance in the livestock subsector increased. The project will \nprovide  long-term  funds  to  PFIs  to  extend  sub-loans  to  eligible  sub-borrowers  for  capital \ninvestment. To be eligible, a sub-borrower must be a commercial entity registered under and \ncompliant with Uzbek laws and regulations; must not be a PFI-related party as defined by the \nCentral Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU); and must have a maximum asset value of $50 million \nequivalent at the time of the application for a sub-loan. Investment subprojects will include \nlivestock production, marketing, processing, input supply, and service delivery.18 The project will \nimprove access to market-based bank finance for producers, processing enterprises, input \nsuppliers, and service providers in the livestock value chain. As such, it will help increase livestock \nproductivity and sustainability, processing capacity and utilization, and marketing of inputs and \nlivestock products. \n \n19.  Output 2: Support services to the livestock subsector improved. The project will \nfacilitate the development of private sector veterinary practices to improve access to clinical \nveterinary services and animal management and health advice, including the effective use of \nantimicrobial drugs.19 Specifically, the project will support the Institute of Veterinary Medicine in \nSamarkand province to (i) develop and deliver a continuing education program for veterinarians \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2018.

Manila). \n21 PFIs will determine sub-borrower equity contributions based on the nature of the credit risk, which, depending on \neach PFI\u2019s credit policy, would be 20%\u201330% of the subproject cost. \n22 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \n22.  Climate mitigation is estimated at $6.25 million and climate adaptation is estimated at \n$45.00 million. ADB will finance 100% of mitigation and adaptation costs.23 Key measures include \napplication of hazard analysis and critical control points, and good manufacturing practices in \nsubprojects;  improvement  of  veterinary  services,  diagnostic  laboratory  services;  and  \nestablishment of model farms with demonstration of best practice in livestock production.  \n \n23.  The government will relend the loan proceeds in United States (US) dollars to PFIs through \nsubsidiary loan agreements that satisfy ADB\u2019s eligibility criteria in the PAM and the loan and \nproject agreements.24 The government is expected to relend the loan proceeds to PFIs for 25 \nyears, with a 5-year grace period. The government\u2019s relending rate will be the interest rate \ncharged by ADB for the loan plus a margin to cover administrative costs.25 \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary capital resources (concessional loan)  150.00  63.17 \nSub-borrowers\u2019 equity contributions  56.15  23.65 \nGovernment  31.30  13.18 \nTotal  237.45  100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n24.  PFIs\u2019 sub-loans may be issued in US dollars and/or local currency; and priced by PFIs at \nmarket rates that cover risks related to foreign exchange, credit, maturity, and interest rates. Sub-\nloan repayment may be in US dollars and/or local currency subject to sub-borrowers\u2019 demand \nand subprojects\u2019 revenue streams, as well as specific agreements between PFIs and sub-\nborrowers. Sub-loans extended by PFIs will have a tenor of up to 10 years. PFIs will determine \nthe creditworthiness of sub-borrowers and assume the full credit risk. The maximum sub-loan size \nwill be $5 million based on an assessment of past and prospective demand of PFIs\u2019 clients. \n \n25.  Participating  financial  institutions.  PFIs  were  selected  from  among  the  domestic \ncommercial banks participating in the Horticulture Value Chain Development Project (footnote 12) \nand those that expressed interest in participating in the project. ADB conducted detailed due \ndiligence on the five banks it selected to participate as PFIs (footnote 24). A portion of loan funds \nhas been reserved for competitive withdrawal by these and additional commercial banks that \ncomplete the due diligence process. PFIs for the most part are in compliance with CBU prudential \nregulations  and  meet  ADB\u2019s  eligibility  requirements  for  financial  intermediaries  and  ADB-\ndetermined financial covenants.26 To address areas of minor noncompliance, PFIs will be required \nto satisfy disbursement conditions and to implement action plans for financial covenants. \n \n                                                \n23 Climate finance was calculated based on the estimated demand for sub-loans by financing category. The mitigation \ncost is based on the investment cost of chilling facilities and better practices in animal husbandry, while the adaptation \ncost of $45 million is based on the investment cost of processing facilities.  \n24 Based on each PFI\u2019s absorptive capacity, and subject to review and adjustment during project implementation, the \ntentative allocation of loan proceeds is currently set as follows: Microcreditbank ($10 million), Qishloq Qurilish Bank \n($30 million), Turonbank ($50 million), Uzpromstroybank ($10 million), and Xalq Bank ($30 million). An amount of \n$16 million is reserved for competitive withdrawal and/or new PFI accreditation. \n25 The government will charge the interest on the ADB loan plus 1.0% per year to the PFIs. PFI interest rates carry the \ncost for (i) loan origination, (ii) provision of foreign exchange, and (iii) credit risk and related charges. \n26 ADB. 2003. Financial Intermediation Loans. Operations Manual. OM D6/BP. Manila (para. 8). \n ", "8 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n26.  The Agency for Implementation of Projects in the Field of Agro-industry and Food Security \n(AIFSA) will be the executing agency. It will be responsible for (i) reviewing and monitoring \nsubproject  implementation,  (ii)  overseeing  project  financial  audits,  and  (iii)  implementing \nveterinary services and the capacity development activities of PFIs. AIFSA will recruit technical \nexperts to support PFIs in developing livestock lending credit policies and procedures, credit \nproducts, and outreach strategy. The implementing agencies will be Microcreditbank, Qishloq \nQurilish Bank, Turonbank, Uzpromstroybank, Xalq Bank, and other PFIs meeting the eligibility \nrequirements.27 The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in \ndetail in the PAM. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2020\u2013December 2024 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2024 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2025 \nManagement \n(i) Executing agency  AIFSA \n(ii) Key implementing  PFIs: Microcreditbank, Qishloq Qurilish Bank, Turonbank, \nagencies  Uzpromstroybank, and Xalq Bank \n(iii) Implementation units  Project management office in AIFSA; project implementation units in PFIs \nProcurementa  OCB  1 contract  $300,000 \nRFQ  3 contracts  $117,418 \nConsulting servicesa  QCBS  3 contracts (110 person-months)  $1,534,394 \nLCS  2 contracts (40 person-months)  $172,862 \nDisbursement  Loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and arrangements \nagreed between the Government of Uzbekistan and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AIFSA = Agency for Implementation of Projects in the Field of Agro-industry and \nFood Security, LCS = least-cost selection; OCB = open competitive bidding; PFI = participating financial institution; \nQCBS = quality- and cost-based selection; RFQ = request for quotation. \na  AIFSA will procure goods and consulting services related to capacity development and project management following \nthe ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n27.  By addressing the constraints of limited access to long-term finance and weak veterinary \nservices, the project will help increase productivity in livestock production activities; and improve \nthe  capacity  and  efficiency  of  production,  processing,  and  marketing  enterprises.  This  will \nincrease the volume and enhance the quality of Uzbek livestock produce for domestic and export \nmarkets, and minimize imports. An analysis of indicative investments indicates that livestock \nproduction and agribusiness investments generate financial internal rates of return of 14%\u201332%, \nand their economic internal rates of return are 19%\u201323%, suggesting such investments are viable. \n \n28.  The five proposed PFIs have experience in agricultural lending and have varying levels of \nagricultural  loan  portfolios.  They  have  all  been  assessed  as  financially  sound.  Financial \nprojections for the project implementation period indicate that the PFIs will continue to perform \n                                                \n27 The executing agency and each implementing agency will enter into separate project agreements with ADB. \n ", "9 \nwell and comply with CBU regulations and ADB loan financial covenants. The maximum value of \nproject-financed sub-loans is projected at 0.3%\u201313.1% of PFIs\u2019 gross loan portfolios during \nproject  implementation  in  2020\u20132024.  Borrowing  under the  project  is,  therefore,  within  the \nabsorptive capacity of each PFI.28 \n \nB.  Governance \n \n29.  Each PFI underwent financial and integrity due diligence. The overall pre-mitigation risk \nfor financial management is moderate while the integrity risk is low to medium and the project-\nspecific procurement risk is low. An action plan has been prepared by each PFI to address \nfinancial management issues and these will be implemented by the first quarter of 2020. Financial \nmanagement and procurement capacity assessment of AIFSA, the executing agency, did not \nidentify any issues that would adversely affect its project management role, and no significant \nintegrity risks were identified. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  AIFSA,  and  PFIs.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n30.  The project supports poverty reduction indirectly by enhancing the linkages between small \nproducers  and  markets.  By  providing  increased  and  stable  market  opportunities  for  small \nproducers, the project will help increase job opportunities and rural incomes. Enhancing efficiency \nand downstream functionality in the livestock value chain will bring significant benefits to small \nproducers, the majority of whom are low-income. The project is classified effective gender \nmainstreaming. Two main gender constraints are lack of access to finance for women-owned \nenterprises and limited entrepreneurship. The project gender action plans include increasing PFIs\u2019 \noutreach, ensuring that livestock-related subprojects financed by PFIs\u2019 sub-loans prioritize the \nemployment  of  female  workers,  and  implementing  capacity  and  leadership  development \nactivities.29 ADB conducted due diligence and confirmed that the livestock subsector complies \nwith core labor standards. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n31.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows: financial intermediation (treated as category B) for the environment, \nand category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples.30 Subprojects identified in \nADB\u2019s  Prohibited  Investment  Activities  List  in  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  that  are \nclassified  category  A  for  the  environment,  and  category  A  or  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement or indigenous peoples are not eligible for project financing. In addition, eligible \nsubprojects will comply with applicable national regulations. ADB carried out due diligence of \nPFIs\u2019 environmental and social management systems (ESMSs).31 All PFIs must have an ESMS \nthat satisfies ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement prior to their first sub-loan disbursement. \n \n                                                \n28 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy, and Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n30 ADB.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n33.  The government and AIFSA have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anti-corruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n34.  The government and AIFSA have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the loan and project agreements. As a condition of loan effectiveness, at \nleast three PFIs shall have entered into a project agreement with ADB, and the government and \nAIFSA shall have entered into a tripartite subsidiary loan agreement with such PFIs, in form and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB. Conditions for loan disbursement for relending to a PFI include \nthe execution of a project agreement with ADB and a subsidiary loan agreement with the \ngovernment and AIFSA, and the establishment by each PFI of an ESMS following the Safeguard \nPolicy Statement requirements. \n \nV.
