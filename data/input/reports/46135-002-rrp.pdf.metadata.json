Responding  directly  to  the  needs  of  urban  communities,  it  will \nupgrade  and  expand  the  existing  sewerage  system,  provide  wastewater  treatment  services, \nstrengthen institutional capacity, and assist with development of a new provincial  water supply \nand wastewater utility. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nDjizzak  city  is  the  administrative  and  economic  center  of  Djizzak  Province,  located \nstrategically  between  the  nation\u2019s  capital,  Tashkent,  which  lies  170  kilometers  (km)  to  the \nnortheast,  and  Samarkand,  which  is  90  km  to  the  southwest.  With  an  area  of  over  21,000 \nsquare kilometers, Djizzak Province is an important agro-industrial region, and is rich in mineral \nresources.2 The  province  is  home  to  over  200  industrial  enterprises,  including  over  30  major \nindustries,3 and  had  an  estimated  population  in  excess  of  1.2  million  in  2012.  As  the  primary \nadministrative  and  economic  hub  in  the  province,  Djizzak  city  is  a  key  driver  of  regional \neconomic  growth  and  development.  The  city  is  approximately  11  km  (north\u2013south)  by  10  km \n(east\u2013west),  and  has  good  road  and  rail  networks.  The  city\u2019s  population  was  estimated  at \n163,000 in 2013.4  Growth from population increase and city expansion is anticipated to average \nover 5% per year through 2020. \n \n4. \nThe  city\u2019s  strategic  importance  is  highlighted  by  the  government\u2019s  recent  approval  of  a \nlong-term  development  plan  to  transform  the  city  into  a  regional  administrative,  economic, \nindustrial, and cultural center.5 Under the plan, urbanization will be accelerated, industrial zones \nexpanded,  existing  industries  relocated,  and  residential  areas  developed.  A  special  industrial \nzone (SIZ) is also being developed to encourage foreign direct investment into high-technology \nindustries. 6  These  initiatives  will  dramatically  increase  the  city\u2019s  population, 7  strengthen  its \neconomy,  create  jobs,  and,  as  a  consequence,  increase  household  incomes  and  living \nstandards. \n \n5. \nThe city\u2019s sewerage system lags seriously behind other infrastructure. Although it serves \nless than a quarter of the city\u2019s current population, the system is plagued by frequent overflows \nand  blockages. 8  Originally  constructed  in  1975,  and  with  poor  subsequent  maintenance, \nsections  of  the  131-kilometer  long sewerage  network  have  now  deteriorated  well  beyond  their \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   These include barite, limestone (cement) gypsum, and facing stone. \n3   The province\u2019s industrial production includes the chemical, light industry, food production, agricultural processing, \nengineering, and metalwork industries. The province is also considered a regional leader in the production of alkali \nbatteries, knitted garments, mixed fodder, and flour. \n\n4   Based on the Institute of Forecasting and Macroeconomic Research. \n5   Decree  of  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  No.  266:  Approval  of  the  Master  Plan  of  Development  of  Djizzak  City  by  the \n\nYear 2030, 30 September 2013. \n\n6   Presidential Decree No. 4516: Establishment of a Special Industrial Zone, Djizzak, 18 March 2013. \n7   Current estimates project the population will increase to about 260,000 by 2020, and 310,000 by 2035. \n8   In  2013,  the  system  had  a  roster  of  12,871  domestic  consumers  and  308  consumers  categorized  as  \u201cother\u201d, \nserving  a  population  of  approximately  38,500.  The  network  also  receives  effluents  from  industrial  facilities  within \nthe vicinity of the WWTP and from the Uch-Tepa district center located north of Djizzak city. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \nuseful  life,  resulting  in  extensive  and  frequent  network  malfunctions. 9  Also,  following  the \npermanent breakdown of the system\u2019s wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in 2002 due to weak \ninstitutional  capacity  and  financial  constraints,  untreated  sewage  from  the  entire  network \ncompletely bypasses the WWTP and discharges directly into surface water channels, resulting \nin  serious  environmental  damage  and  threats  to  public  health.  Epidemiological  records  for \nDjizzak reveal increasingly disturbing trends of diseases such as acute intestinal infections and \nviral  hepatitis  that  are  commonly  associated  with  poor  sewerage  and  sanitation.  The  Djizzak \nCity Sewerage Company is responsible for provision of sewerage within the city, but struggles \nto  operate  and  maintain  even  basic  elements  of  the  existing  sewerage  network.  Its  financial \nmanagement  is  not  well  established  and  performance  requires  improvement; 10  revenues \ngenerally cover only salaries and essential network repairs. \n \n6. \nThe  government  plans  to  improve  sanitary  conditions  through  phased  investments  to \nrehabilitate  and  expand  the  sewerage  system  and  reform  the  responsible  institutions.  A  new \nprovincial  water  supply  and  sewerage  enterprise  is  currently  being  created  that  will  own, \nmanage,  and  operate  all  urban  water  supply  and  wastewater  systems  in  Djizzak  Province. \nDjizzak  city\u2019s  existing  water  supply  and  sewerage  companies  will  be  absorbed  as  a  branch \noperation of this provincial administration.11 Overall, the government understands that in parallel \nto  significant  physical \ninstitutional  reform  and  cost-recovery \nimprovements  will  be  essential  to  improve  sector  conditions,  mitigate  acute  public  health  and \nenvironmental impacts in the city, and support planned economic growth. \n \n7. \nThe  project  will  support  the  government\u2019s  development  plans  for  Djizzak  city  by  both \nrevitalizing  and  expanding  the  city\u2019s  sewerage  system  and  providing  substantial  assistance  to \nimplement  the  planned  institutional  reform  process.  It  is  consistent  with  (i)  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  Strategy  2020  midterm  review  action  plan; 12  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  Country \nPartnership  Strategy  for  Uzbekistan,  2012\u20132016; 13  (iii)  ADB\u2019s  Water  Operational  Plan,  by \nsupporting increased investment in wastewater management and sanitation;14 (iv) the Program \nof  Integrated  Development  and  Modernization  of  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Systems  of  the \nRepublic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Years  2009\u20132020;  and  (v)  previous  and  ongoing  ADB \ninterventions in the sector.15 Lessons that have been incorporated in the project design include \n                                                \n9   Sewer network breakdowns increased from 428 (2011) to 503 (2013), corresponding to 3.84 breakdowns per km \nannually;  over  the  same  period,  breakdowns  from  the  four  pump  stations  increased  from  7  to  18  per  year.  In  a \nrecent survey, 40% of consumers reported sewerage breakdowns during the previous year. \n\ninvestments,  widespread \n\n10  The company currently generates a small profit, but this is primarily the result of a dramatic reduction in operating \ncosts caused by its wastewater treatment facility being inoperative, and is not representative of normal operations. \n11 Prime Minister\u2019s decree 3/8960 (March 2014) confirms that provincial water supply and sewerage companies are to \nbe  transformed  into  provincial  water  supply  and  sewerage  enterprises,  which  will  absorb  municipal  water  and \nwastewater  companies  within  their  jurisdictions.  The  name  of  the  provincial  enterprise  for  Djizzak  is  the  Djizzak \nRegional Water Supply and Sewerage Enterprise. \n\n12 ADB. 2014.

Manila; including Loan \n2564-UZB, tranche 1; Loan 2633-UZB, tranche 2; Loan 2825-UZB, tranche 3; and Loan 3064-UZB, tranche 4. The \ncurrent rating of these projects is on-track. \n\n \n\n\f \nthe  need  to  (i)  avoid  project  commencement  delays;  (ii)  provide  early  counterpart  funding;  (iii) \nrecruit qualified consultants in a timely manner; (iv) ensure project management unit (PMU) and \nproject  implementation  unit  (PIU)  staff  salaries  are  competitive  and  include  incentive \nmechanisms; and (v) maintain quality standards for civil works structures. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n3 \n\n8. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  improved  living  standards,  environment,  and  public \nhealth in Djizzak. The outcome of the project will be improved and expanded access to reliable, \nsustainable, and affordable water supply and sanitation services in Djizzak. \n \nC. \n \n9. \n  \n\nThe project will have two outputs: \n\nOutputs \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nOutput 1: Wastewater management system in Djizzak city improved. Output \n1  will  construct  trunk  sewers  (45.80  km  in  length),  a  new  WWTP,  and  one \npumping  station;  rehabilitate  trunk  sewers  (16.75  km)  and  three  pumping \nstations;  procure  equipment;  and  decommission  obsolete  components.  Support \nwill be provided to operate and maintain the new facilities. By project completion, \nthe  system  will  collect  and  treat  30,000  cubic  meters  of  sewage  per  day  from \ndomestic  and  nondomestic  consumers,  including  at  least  85,000  residents  of \nDjizzak city and the Uch-Tepa district center.  \n\nOutput  2:  Institutional  capacity  of  the  Djizzak  Regional  Water  Supply  and \nSewerage Enterprise improved. A transitional support program will support the \nestablishment  and  operations  of  the  Djizzak  Regional  Water  Supply  and \nSewerage Enterprise (DWSE) that will absorb the Djizzak city water supply and \nsewerage companies. The DWSE\u2019s capacity will be further strengthened through \nmanagement support and training. \n\n \nD. \n\n10. \n \n\nItem \nA.  \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n \nThe project is estimated to cost $96.56 million equivalent (Table 1).  \n\n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \n\nBase Costb \n1.  \n\n2.  \n\nWastewater management system in Djizzak city improved (civil works and \nequipment) \nInstitutional capacity of the Djizzak Regional Water Supply and Sewerage \nEnterprise improved (consulting services) \n\nAmounta \n\n  \n\n76.13 \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\n \nContingenciesc \nFinancing Charges During Implementationd \n \n\n \n \nB.  \nC.  \n \na  Includes taxes and duties of $13.660 million to be financed from government resources.  \nb  In 2014 prices. \nc  Physical contingencies computed at 5%.

With  overall  responsibility  to  improve  water  supply  and  wastewater  services,  it  formulates \npolicy,  advises  on  reforms  and  decrees,  and  is  a  focal  execution  agency  for  foreign  investments  in  the  sector. \nUCSA\u2019s  activities  are  financed  by  a  combination  of  government,  utility,  and  development  bank  project  funding. \nUCSA is the executing agency for the projects referenced in footnote 15. \n\n19  The PIU staff will include a director, a wastewater engineer, an accountant, a social and gender specialist, and an \n\nenvironment and social safeguard specialist. This arrangement is similar to the PIU for the ongoing MFF. \n\n20  The Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) details the project \n\nsteering committee\u2019s tasks and responsibilities. \n\n \n\n\fAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)   Key implementing agency \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \nDisbursement  \n\n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nFebruary 2016\u2013April 2021 \n30 April 2021 \n\n5 \n\n$39,000,000 \n\nProject steering committee; chair: Ministry of Financea \nUCSA \nDjizzak Regional Water Supply and Sewerage Enterprise \nPIU, 5 staff \nInternational competitive \nbidding \n\n1 contract \u2013 design and build \n(with extended defect \nnotification period and \noperation maintenance) \n3 contracts \n\n$42,733,000 \n\n$1,802,000 \n\n$2,702,000 \n\n$208,000 \n$3,300,000 \n\n1 contract \n\n3 contracts \n\n5 contracts \nInternational: 85 person-months \nNational: 132 person-months \n\nInternational competitive \nbidding \u2013 works \nNational competitive \nbidding \u2013 works \nNational competitive \nbidding \u2013 equipment \nShopping \nProject development \nconsultant \nQCBS \nDetailed design sewerage \nnetwork consultant \nQCBS \nTransition Support \nProgram \nGovernment financing \nPIU\u2013PMU auditing \nLCS \nRetroactive financing is available for up to 20% of the loan amount of advance \ncontracts for the project development consultant and the detailed design. \nThe ADB loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \n\nInternational: 8 person-months \nNational: 20 person-months \n\nNational: 1,200 person-months \n\nNational: 130 person-months \n\n$800,000 \n\n$294,000 \n\n$2,500,000  \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  LCS  =  least-cost  selection,  PIU  =  project  implementation  unit,  PMU  =  project \nmanagement  unit,  QCBS  =  quality-  and  cost-based  selection,  UCSA  =  Agency  \u201cUzkommunkhizmat\u201d  (Uzbekistan \nCommunal Services Agency). \na The  project  steering  committee  composition  has  not  yet  been  confirmed,  but  it  is  envisioned  to  include \nrepresentatives  of  UCSA,  Djizzak  Regional  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Enterprise,  the  provincial  government \nadministration, the governor\u2019s office, and Djizzak city government. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nA. \n \n16. \nDue diligence undertaken during project preparatory technical assistance confirmed the \ntechnical  viability  of  the  project.  Analysis  of  alternative  technical  options  identified  appropriate \nwastewater  treatment  process  technology  and  sewerage  system  design  in  terms  of  economic \nand safeguards  aspects. The project  option  recommends  construction  of  a new WWTP  with a \ntreatment  capacity  of  30,000  cubic  meters  per  day  and  rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  the \nexisting  sewerage system  in accordance with international  design  and construction  standards. \nThe system will serve domestic and nondomestic consumers, including a population of at least \n85,000. 21 The  project  will  meet  the  government\u2019s  effluent  water  quality  standards,  optimize \n\n                                                \n21  It is anticipated that the project will rehabilitate connections for at least 38,000 people, and add new connections for \n\nat least 47,000 people. Further expansion will be considered based on the city\u2019s needs and financial capacity. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \nelectricity  consumption,   and   improve  the    environment    and   natural   water    bodies   of   the  \nproject  areas.  Operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  equipment,  a  laboratory,  and  specialized \nservice  equipment  will  be  procured.  Support  provided  by  the  project\u2019s  Transition  Support \nProgram will ensure that the DWSE is fully established and operational. \n\n \nEconomic and Financial \n\nB. \n \n17. \nEconomic  analysis.  The  economic  viability  of  the  overall  project  is  assessed  from  a \nnational perspective, based on the benefits of rehabilitating and improving the sewerage system \nfor Djizzak city. The main quantified benefits for the population from improved sanitation include: \nimproved health and reduced infant mortality, time savings, and saved costs of constructing and \nmaintaining alternative sanitation facilities. The project will also support the growth of the SIZ in \nDjizzak by providing essential wastewater collection and treatment facilities, and contributing to \neconomic  benefits.  Additional  benefits  accrue  from  the  use  of  treated  effluent  and  the  greater \npublic  goods  benefits  brought  about  by  an  improved  environment  and  water  resources.  The \nproject is assessed to be economically viable, as the economic internal rate of return of 14.12% \nexceeds  the  assumed  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%.  The  sensitivity  analysis \nshows that the economic internal rate of return is most sensitive to increased capital costs, and \nless sensitive to increased O&M costs and reduced benefits. \n \nFinancial  analysis.  The  financial  analysis  is  conducted  from  the  perspective  of  an \n18. \nindependent, stand-alone entity that is solely responsible for the management and operation of \nsewage  collection  and  treatment  for  Djizzak  city  and  Uch-Tepa  district  center.  Income  and \nexpenditures  over  a  25-year  period  were  estimated  based  on  internationally  acceptable \nparameters  and  a  tariff  regime  appropriate  for  the  customer  base,  differentiating  between \nresidential  households,  nonrevenue-generating \ninstitutions,  commercial  enterprises,  and \nindustrial operations in the SIZ. The analysis shows that the potential tariff revenues will cover \nall direct O&M and depreciation costs from the outset, but continuing government support will be \nneeded to service the ADB loan. The entity\u2019s financial position will improve over time, however, \nas the debt is paid off and depreciation charges diminish. Moreover, absorption of the existing \nDjizzak  City  Sewerage  Company  into  the  DWSE  will  also  improve  the  financial  viability  of  the \nproject. With financial  support  from  the  central  government  and  appropriate  tariff  adjustments, \nthe  project  could  be  financially  viable  and  generate  a  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  2%, \nwhich  is  higher  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  1.60%.  The  sensitivity  analysis \nshows  that  the  financial  performance  is  sensitive  to  increases  in  capital  investment  and  O&M \ncosts, and changes to the future revenue stream. \n \n19.  Managing \nthe  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  risks\u2014such  as  environmental \nmitigation,  monitoring,  and  land  acquisition  impacts 22 \u2014will  require  funding  that  may  not \nnecessarily  accord  with \nland  acquisition \ncompensation will be required following completion of the detailed design, but before the award \nof civil works contracts; it is easier to include this funding in the project costs rather than relying \non the government\u2019s annual budget.   The  government\u2019s  administrative  arrangement  under  the \nresolution  for  land  acquisition  ensures  that  payment  of  compensation  will  be  effective  and \ntransparent,  but  to  ensure  compensation  is  paid  in  accordance  with  the  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement plan (LARP), an independent monitoring agency will be recruited by the PMU, with \ndisbursements  for  land acquisition  costs  based  on  verification  of  payment  by  the  independent \nmonitoring agency. \n \n\nthe  government\u2019s  annual  budget.  Funds \n\nfor \n\n                                                \n22 The  land  is  owned  by  the  government;  compensation  payments  reflect  the  economic  loss  resulting  from \ndiscontinued use of the land by farmers. However, when the LARP is updated, other impacts may be realized.  \n\n \n\n\fC. \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\n7 \n\nProcurement  management  assessments  concluded \n\n20. \nA  financial  management  assessment  has  concluded  that  the  existing  Djizzak  water \nsupply  and  sewerage  companies,  and  the  existing  provincial  water  enterprise,  currently  meet \nADB\u2019s  financial  management  requirements,  although  auditing  functions  need  to  be  improved. \nFinancial  management  is  being  strengthened  through  the  government\u2019s  institutional  reform \ninitiatives,  which    will    result    in    the    creation    of    the    DWSE,    which    will    implement  \nstandardized    reporting  systems  and  improved  financial  management  and  internal  control \nsystems.  The  DWSE  will  be  established  with  assistance  from  the  project\u2019s  Transition  Support \nProgram. \n \n21. \nthat  UCSA  satisfies  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements  for  an  executing  agency.  Its  system  is  adequate  to  (i)  prepare  qualified  bidding \ndocuments;  and  (ii)  conduct  the  procurement  of  civil  works,  goods,  equipment,  and  consulting \nservices.23 The  PMU  will  be  staffed  with experienced  personnel that  have received  training  on \nADB  project  administration  and  implementation.  ADB  will  provide  additional  procurement \noversight.  The  PMU  staff  will  also  be  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  for  Borrowers  on  the \nFinancial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2006),24 Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as \namended from time to time), and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n22. \nwith the government, the Ministry of Finance, and UCSA. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n \n23. \nBased on household budgets survey (Goskomstat), the poverty level in Djizzak province \nwas 27.90%, compared with 23.60% nationally.25 The project will contribute indirectly to poverty \nreduction  in  the  project  area  through  the  provision  of  an  improved  sewerage  system  and \nimplementation  of  sanitation  awareness  and  hygiene-promotion  activities  and  associated \ninstitutional  and  management  strengthening  of  the  utility.  This  will  reduce  health  care \nexpenditures  caused  by  unsanitary  environmental  conditions  and  improve  health  and  well-\nbeing.26 More  than  85,000  persons  will  benefit  from  the  project  investments,  including  through \nimprovements to existing services and provision of expanded access to services.27 \n \n24. \nConstraints related to the lack of sanitation in homes negatively affect the quality of life \nfor  all  family  members,  especially  women.  As  detailed  in  the  project  gender  action  plan,  the \nproject  will  (i)  recruit  a  PMU  and  PIU  social  and  gender  specialist;  (ii)  facilitate  women\u2019s \nparticipation  in  project-associated  activities;  (iii)  provide  employment  opportunities  in  the \nWWTP,  with  jobs  such  as  sanitation  operator  available  to  women  (at  least  50%  of  WWTP \nlaboratory  staff  and  50%  of  customer  care  workers  will  be  women);  (iv)  include  women  in  the \nproject  management  and  implementation  team,  who  will  be  equitably  paid;  (v)  provide  gender \nand  development  awareness  training  for  relevant  organizations;  (vi)  provide  equal  opportunity \n\n                                                \n23  The project's procurement capacity assessment report and recommendation is available on request. \n24  ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n25  Data from the 2007 Household Budgets Survey (Goskomstat), conducted by the State Statistics Committee. \n26  A  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  household  survey  of  280  households  in  Djizzak  (April  2014)  revealed \nthat  almost  two-thirds  (64.3%)  of  households  surveyed  are  not  connected  to  centralized  sewerage.  These \nhouseholds use pit latrines, 44% of which are not concreted (sealed); given that 15% of households use water from \nshallow  wells  for  drinking  and  household  purposes  (often  located  only  a  few  meters  from  unsealed  pit  latrines), \ncross contamination is likely, posing a serious threat of infectious and parasitic diseases. \n\n27 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \nand access to training for female DWSE staff; (vii) establish a gender-sensitive customer care \nand  complaints  unit;  and  (viii)  conduct  gender-sensitive  sanitation  and  hygiene  promotion \ntraining  and  outreach  activities  linked  to  the  sewerage  system  to  reduce  disease  and  the \nassociated burden on women who provide care.28 \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n \n25. \nEnvironmental  safeguards.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environmental \nimpacts in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). An initial environmental \nexamination  was  undertaken  regarding  the  construction  of  the  new  WWTP  and  supporting \nfacilities.  It  assesses  impacts  and  includes  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  to \nminimize  or  avoid  these  impacts.  Public  consultations  were  also  completed  in  Djizzak.  The \nproject  will  not  cause  significant  environmental  impacts,  and  almost  all  environmental \ndisturbances  will  primarily  occur  during  construction.  Most  of  the  impacts  are  temporary  in \nnature, and can be addressed during construction by employing good construction practices. An \nenvironmental monitoring report covering EMP implementation must be submitted biannually to \nADB. \n \n26. \nThe project is considered to be environmentally feasible. The PMU, on behalf of UCSA, \nwill  have  overall  responsibility  for  implementing  the  EMP  throughout  project  preparation  and \nimplementation. The contractor will be responsible for implementing the EMP and mitigating all \nimpacts relating to construction activities. UCSA has limited capacity to address environmental \nconcerns,  and  consequently  the  PMU  team  will  include  an  environment  specialist. 29  The \nsupervision  consultant  will  also  include  an  environment  specialist  on  its  team  to  supervise  the \ncontractor in implementing the EMP during the construction phase. \n \n27. \nSocial safeguards. The project will require the permanent and temporary acquisition of \nland. Permanent acquisition of approximately 30.65 hectares will be required for the WWTP, its \naccess  road,  and  a  new  pumping  station  in  Halkabad,  while  temporary  acquisition  of  43.99 \nhectares  will  be  required  during  reconstruction  of  the  sewerage  network.  On  this  basis,  the \nproject  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). The new WWTP will be constructed on reserve land of the \nDjizzak region, and an involuntary resettlement compliance audit indicates that the land used by \nthe  existing  and  new  facilities  is  not  in  dispute  or  subject  to  current  or  past  claims  by  other \nparties,  with  no  future  claims  expected.  The  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  in  close \nconsultation with affected people. There are 13 households with 132 residents affected by land \nland-for-land \nacquisition;  during  consultation,  all  expressed  a  willingness \ncompensation. \n \n28. \nThe  LARP  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  national  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  LARP  assessment  was  carried  out  from  May  to  July \n2014.  Four  consultations  were  performed  with affected  people and  other relevant  parties such \nas  local  government  agencies  and  local  communities.  Implementation  of  the  LARP,  including \nland acquisition, consultants, and monitoring, will cost approximately $440,000, of which about \n$375,000 is to compensate for permanent and temporary acquisition. In addition, training will be \nprovided  by  the  PDC  on  LARP  implementation.  UCSA  has  experience  in  dealing  with  LARP \n\nto  accept \n\n                                                \n28  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The project is classified effective \n\ngender mainstreaming. \n\n29  The specialist will be responsible for (i) ensuring that all environmental concerns are taken into account during the \ndetailed design, (ii) ensuring that the procurement and contract documents cover all environmental requirements, \n(iii) monitoring EMP implementation being performed by supervision consultants and contractors, and (iv) preparing \nbiannual environmental monitoring reports to be submitted to ADB and UCSA. \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\n \nimplementation;  for  this  project,  a  qualified  resettlement  consultant  will  assist  the  PMU.  The \nconsultant will update the LARP after the detailed design is available, and then submit it to ADB \nfor approval prior to processing of the procurement contract. Compensation to affected farmers \nmust  be  fully  paid  prior  to  the  award  of  the  civil  works  contracts.  In  the  event  that  the  project \nincludes a design-and-build contract, the PMU will issue a notice to proceed with civil works only \nafter  ADB  has  formally  concurred  that  all  compensation  payments  have  been  paid  in  full.  The \nPMU will be responsible for submitting formal reports to ADB,30 and for establishing a grievance \nredress mechanism to address complaints. The poverty and social assessment survey indicates \nthat  there  are  no  communities  or  groups  in  the  project  area  that  maintain  a  particular  culture, \nlanguage,  or  properties.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples  and \nethnic minorities requirements in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). To \ncomply with ADB information disclosure requirements, the initial environmental examination and \nLARP reports were disclosed on the ADB website on 28 August 2014. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n \n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.31 The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs.  \n\nLimited government procurement capacity, \nand procurement delays \n\nGovernment unable to finance and sustain \nproject operation and maintenance over the \nlong term \n \n\nRisks \nNo regular internal audit for PMU; staff \nrecruited  for PIU in  Djizzak may  have  \nlimited experience with ADB financial \nmanagement requirements \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nMitigating Measures \nA  project  management  team,  including  a  qualified  international \nfinancial   management specialist    and   a  qualified  national   financial \nmanagement    specialist,    will    be    recruited    to    provide    necessary \nsupport  and  to  strengthen  internal  control  of  the  PMU,  PIU,  and \nDWSE. \nDWSE has been established to improve water supply and sanitation \nsector management in Djizzak Province. The national government will \nensure  that  DWSE  has  all  necessary  financial  resources  to  operate \nand maintain its assets and meet its debt obligations. Debt service of \nthe loan will be subsidized by the Ministry of Finance. \nA PMU established within UCSA and a PIU established in Djizzak will \nmanage project procurement and implementation, using international \nand  national  specialists.  Advance  action  for  the  recruitment  of  the \nproject  development  consultant  and  individual  consultants  is  also \nproposed. ADB will provide additional procurement oversight. \nThe  national  government\u2019s  recent  legislative  initiatives  clarify  the \nmandates,  responsibilities,  and  relationships  of  national,  provincial, \nand municipal sector institutions. The TSP will assist governments at \nall  levels  to  implement  the  institutional  reform  program  in  Djizzak \nProvince, and develop DWSE. \nThe  project  provides  a  system  for  the  environmental  monitoring \nand   laboratory   testing   of   industrial   effluents,   and   capacity \ndevelopment    to    ensure    the    enforcement    of    standards,    to    be \noperated within an existing environmental regulatory framework. \nThe TSP will provide assistance to DWSE to establish transparent \nbilling and collection systems. \n\nIndustrial units discharge effluent without \npretreatment, negatively impacting the \noperation of the project\u2019s sewerage system \nand wastewater treatment plant \nRevenue generation difficulties resulting \nfrom poor billing and collection, and revenue \nlimitations \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  DWSE =  Djizzak  Regional Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Enterprise,  PIU  = project \nimplementation  unit,  PMU  =  project  management  unit,  TSP  =  Transition  Support  Program,  UCSA  =  Agency \n\u201cUzkommunkhizmat\u201d (Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nDue to institutional capacity limitations, the \nDWSE is not established as a viable, \ncommercially oriented utility with consumer \naccountability and service sustainability \n\n                                                \n30  Including (i) an updated LARP after the detailed design is available, (ii) a report of full compensation payments to \naffected people, (iii) an external monitoring report regarding LARP implementation, and (iv) a verification report on \nLARP implementation by an independent monitoring agency. \n\n31 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the linked document list in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n\nThe government and UCSA have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\n \n30. \nThe government and UCSA have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n31. \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n32. \nIt  will  be  a  condition  for  loan  effectiveness  that  (i)  the  borrower  shall  have  issued  a \nresolution  specifying,  among  other  things,  the  general  project  scope,  the  project\u2019s  exemption \nfrom taxes within the territory of the borrower, the project\u2019s implementation arrangements, and \ngovernment\u2019s  contribution  valued  at  not  less  than  $500,000  to  support  implementation  of  the \ninstitutional reforms component of the project; and (ii) the subsidiary loan agreement (pursuant \nto  which  the  borrower  will  onlend  the  entire  proceeds  of  the  loan  to  UCSA),  in  form  and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, will have been executed and delivered and will be fully effective \nand legally binding upon such parties. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n33. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR53,999,000  to  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Djizzak \nSanitation System Development Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest \ncharge at the rate of 2.0% per annum during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n \n \n \n13 August 2015 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpacts the Project is Aligned with: Improved living standards, environment, and public health in Djizzak (Sector \nStrategy 2020, Development of Strategy, Road Map and Investment Program for the Water Supply and Sanitation \nSector of the Republic of Uzbekistan until 2020). \n\nPerformance Indicators with \nTargets and Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \n\n \nProvincial statistical data \nreports \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nImproved and \nexpanded access to \nreliable, sustainable, \nand affordable water \nsupply and sanitation \nservices in Djizzak \n\nRisks \n\n \nGovernment delays or \ncurtails the implementation \nof development \ninvestments for water \nsupply and sanitation \nservices  \n\nOutputs \n1.
