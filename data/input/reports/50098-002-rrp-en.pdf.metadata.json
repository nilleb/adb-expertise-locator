This  project  aims  to  expand  the  benefits  of  the  GMS \ncorridors to the northwestern provinces, where high poverty incidence is reported, by enhancing \nthe road connectivity between the Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Expressway and the provinces of Lai Chau, \nLao Cai and Yen Bai. The project will improve National Highway 279 and National Highway 32, \nand upgrade Provincial Road 136 and Provincial Road 175 to national highways. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe economic and political reforms under the Doi Moi policy, launched in 1986, resulted \nin rapid economic growth (averaging over 6.5% annually during 1991\u20132017) and development in \nthe past 30 years. This growth has subsequently transformed Viet Nam from one of the world\u2019s \npoorest nations to a lower middle-income country, with a gross domestic product per capita of \n$2,389 in 2017. Viet Nam's poverty rate was 7.0% in 2015, the second lowest among the ASEAN \n(Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations)  countries. 1 Increased  foreign  direct  investment  and \ncloser integration with the global economy have accompanied the increasing market orientation \nof Viet Nam\u2019s economic policy, and the growth in private domestic enterprise.2 \n \n4. \nThe rapid economic growth of Viet Nam is largely because of the development of transport \ninfrastructure.  With  the  rigorous  efforts  of  the  government  and  the  assistance  of  major \ndevelopment  partners  such  as  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency,  and  the  World  Bank,  a  number  of  transport  projects,  mainly  in  the  road \nsubsector,  have  been  completed.  Presently,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  road  network  has  a  total  length  of \n268,787  kilometers  (km)  (0.81  km  per  square  km).  In  the  past  20  years,  the  government  has \nprioritized  the  development  of  major  highways  and  expressways,  including  part  of  the  GMS \nKunming-Haiphong Transport Corridor.3 To date, expansion of the GMS expressway network is \nnearing completion, and the government is increasingly considering the use of the public\u2013private \npartnership modality or the build\u2013operate\u2013transfer modality for further expressway development. \nMoreover, the government\u2019s investment priorities have shifted to the other category roads, which \nwill further spread the benefits of the existing road network throughout the country, especially to \npeople living in less-developed regions. \n \n5. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  Northwest  Region,  a  high  mountainous  region  comprising  the  provinces  of \nDien Bien, Hoa Binh, Lai Chau, Lao Cai, Son La and Yen Bai, lags behind the rest of the country, \nwith  the  highest  poverty  rate  ranging  from  18%  to  45%  in  2016. 4 Over  50%  of  the  region\u2019s \npopulation is made up of ethnic minority groups, including Tay, H'Mong, Thai, Dao, and Muong. \nThe ethnic minorities, who make up only 15% of the country\u2019s population, constituted 73% of the \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB).

Washington, DC. \n\n\fpoor  in  2016.  Industrial  production  in  the  Northwest  Region  is  less  developed  than  in  other \nregions, with many small-scale industrial companies. The major industries include stone, metal \nore exploitation and processing, lime brick, and beer production. There are no large processing \nmanufacturing enterprises in the region. The ethnic minority people in the region live with nomadic \nhabits, and practice self-production and self-consumption. Their average per capita consumption \nremains less than 45% of the Kinh and Hoa (the two majority ethnic groups in Viet Nam). The \npoor,  which  comprised  primarily  of  ethnic  minorities,  are  also  disadvantaged  by  their  low \neducation  attainment  and  financial  capacity;  less  than  60%  of  adults  in  poor  households  have \nprimary  education  or  less,  and  less  than  7%  have  post-secondary  education  (footnote  4).  Key \nfactors  causing  the  high  poverty  and  slow  development  of  the  region  include  the  following:  (i) \npoorly developed infrastructure, particularly the infrastructure linking to markets and services; (ii) \nland  that  is  comparatively  not  well  suited  to  commercial  agriculture;  (iii)  remoteness  from \ncommercial  and  industrial  hubs;  and  (iv)  undeveloped  local  economies  with  limited  nonfarm \nlivelihood opportunities. \n \n6. \nWith  a  relatively  large  area  of  land,  high  mountains,  large  rivers,  fertile  soil,  beautiful \nlandscapes, and a border with the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC), the Northwest Region has great potential for development of agriculture, forestry, \nhydropower,  mining,  tourism,  and  border  trade.  However,  the  underdeveloped  transport \ninfrastructure has hindered the region\u2019s economic development, as it limits access of the local \npopulation to public services and economic opportunities. It also discourages private investment \nin the region. Currently, the region\u2019s overall road density is 0.71 km per square km, 13% less than \nthe country\u2019s average, while the national highway density is 0.051 km per square km, 20% less \nthan country\u2019s average of 0.064 km per square km. Therefore, improved connectivity within the \nregion  and  improved  access  to  the  economic  centers  of  the  country  are  critical  for  the \ndevelopment of the region. \n \n7. \nThe Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Expressway, considered the backbone of the Northwest Region\u2019s \nroad network, is part of the GMS Kunming\u2013Hai Phong Transport Corridor that connects the Ha \nNoi region to Yunnan Province in the PRC and passes through the provinces of Lao Cai and Yen \nBai. This expressway was completed in 2014, but the provinces in the corridors\u2019 proximity have \nnot fully benefited from it, showing a slower pace of development than the rest of the country. \nThis is because the national highway and provincial road networks are largely incomplete, and \nthe condition of the existing roads is generally poor. The existing roads are also prone to natural \ndisasters namely flash floods, landslides, rockfalls and wild fire, of which likelihood and magnitude \nof impacts are increasing due to global warming. The average annual temperature in Viet Nam \nhas  increased  by  0.4oC  since  1960  and  is  projected  to  increase  by  0.8-2.7oC  by  2060.5 The \nclimate change assessment projects that the magnitude of May precipitation will increase possibly \nup to 59-61%, and the magnitude of December precipitation will increase possibly up to 173%-\n208%.6 \n \n8. \nThe  project  will  improve  and  upgrade  two  road  stretches  totaling  198  km  that  connect \nseveral towns and districts in the provinces of Lai Chau, Lao Cai and Yen Bai to the Noi Bai\u2013Lao \nCai  Expressway.  These  road  stretches  will  connect  to  other  main  roads  under  the  Lao  Cai \nprovince transport development master plan to improve network connectivity with the Noi Bai-Lao \nCai  Expressway.7 The  existing roads  pass through  very  difficult  terrain  with  high  mountains  or \n\n                                                \n5   Irish Aid. 20017.

Their conditions are \npoor; the average travel speed is 25 km per hour and several sections are not passable year-\nround. Therefore, a major rehabilitation or improvement is required to accommodate the expected \ntraffic growth due to the current economic development of the region. \n \n9. \nThe improved connectivity will (i) provide reliable access to basic social services such as \neducation, health care, job training, and emergency disaster relief, and (ii) increase economic and \nemployment opportunities for the people of the northwestern provinces, especially the poor ethnic \nminorities.  The  enhanced  connectivity  to  the  Noi  Bai\u2013Lao  Cai  Expressway  will  provide  further \nopportunities of cross-border trade with the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and the PRC. The \nimproved roads will help save travel time and costs, hence reducing fuel consumption and carbon \ndioxide  emissions.  The  improvement  and  upgrade  works  will  ensure  consistency  of  standards \nover  the  entire  road  stretches,  including  climate  resilience  features  namely  slope  protection \nmeasures  in  areas  prone  to  landslides  and  rockfalls,  raising  and/or  reconstructing  highway \nembankments  and  bridges  along  road  sections  prone  to  dangerous  flooding,  and  increasing \ncross-drainage capacity. The project will include awareness campaigns for road safety, HIV/AIDS, \nand  human  trafficking  which  will  enable  the  vulnerable  ethnic  minorities  to  cope  with  possible \nnegative  impacts  of  the  project  roads.  The  government\u2019s  rigorous  efforts  to  enforce  laws  and \nregulations on road safety have resulted in decrease of fatalities caused by road traffic accidents \nfrom more than 11,000 in 2011 to less than 9,000.8 However, creation of road safety awareness \nfor  the  people  in  the  project  area,  especially  the  poor  ethnic  minorities,  is  still  necessary \nconsidering the expected increased traffic speed and volume.  \n \n10. \nThe project supports the government\u2019s implementation of Viet Nam\u2019s national transport \nstrategy 2020 to provide efficient and safe transportation to international and domestic markets, \ntourism destinations, and social services facilities; all project roads are listed under the national \ntransport strategy. 9 The improvement of project roads fits ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nViet Nam, 2016\u20132020. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table 1).10 \n \n\nStrategy 2030 Priority \n1.

The \nimproved roads will make access to economic opportunities and social \nservices including health care, education, and agricultural advice services \npossible and more affordable to the poor. Migration of the workforce to major \ntowns and cities for higher-paying jobs will be easier.  \n\n(ii) Improving education and training. The improved roads will facilitate \n\nestablishment of education institutions and mobilization of professional advice \nservices and production knowhow in the project area. \n\nimproved roads will allow faster and more cheaply transportation of agriculture \nproducts to distant markets, including markets that are currently inaccessible. \n(ii) Increasing agricultural productivity and food security. The improved roads will \nallow easier access to agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, seeds, tools and \nmachinery, innovation, and production knowhow.

Climate  adaptation  measures,  including  reinforced \n11. \nslope  protection,  rockfall  protection  galleries,  and  increased  drainage  capacity,  will  be \nincorporated in the engineering design to improve climate resilience of the project roads. ADB will \nwork closely with the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), who will provide \na grant to finance the  detailed  engineering  design  (DED)  of the  project roads  on  behalf  of the \nGovernment of Australia, as a collaborative cofinancier of ADB. The DFAT grant will also support \nthe awareness campaigns for road safety, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking; and the development \nof an axle load control program to enhance inclusiveness and sustainability of the project. This \ncofinancing was made possible by ADB\u2019s catalytic role. \n \n12. \nLessons  learned.  ADB  has  supported  Viet  Nam  and  its  neighboring  countries  on \nimprovement  of  national  and  regional  connections  mainly  through  the  enhancement  of  GMS \ncorridors,  national  highways,  and  rural  road  networks.  Previous  project  completion  reports \nhighlighted  the  need  for  ADB  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  adequate  road  maintenance \nthrough (i) funds allocation to the Viet Nam National Road Maintenance Fund (NRMF) and (ii) \nmeasures related to enforcement of axle load control. The NRMF is being supported by the World \nBank, and the axle load control program development will be incorporated in the activities under \nthe  DFAT  grant  as  a  part  of  the  detailed  design.  ADB  will  coordinate  with  these  development \npartners to achieve the project impact and facilitate development of the road sector in Viet Nam. \nOther lessons include the need to account for lengthy decision-making processes, significant lead \ntime for  approval  procedures,  and  extensive  administrative  procedures. The  project\u2019s  time  line \nwas prepared to accommodate these constraints. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  economic,  sociocultural,  and \nenvironmental development in lagging and border areas accelerated (footnote 9).

Three  partial \nroad realignments (totaling 15 km) were proposed for bypassing highly populated village centers. \nThese  realignments  were  deemed  necessary  to  avoid  or  minimize  involuntary  resettlement, \nimprove traffic safety, and reduce noise and emissions in these areas. Some improvement works \n(horizontal and vertical curve adjustment, road widening, repaving, slope stabilization, raising of \nembankments, increasing of drainage capacities, and bridge reconstruction) will be included as \npart  of  climate  adaptation  measures.

The  economic  evaluation  of  the  project  was  conducted  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  by  comparing  life  cycle  costs  in  with-  and  without-  project \ncases,15 using  a  9%  discount rate  and the  economic  internal rate  of return  (EIRR)  as  decision \ncriteria  and  using  the  Highway  Development  and  Management  Model  (HDM-4).  The  benefits \nconsidered  in  the  economic  appraisal  are  savings  in  vehicle  operation  costs,  improvements  in \ntravel time, and reduction in accidents. The estimated EIRR for the project is 14.24%, with a net \npresent value of $98.6 million at the discount rate of 9%. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to \ninvestigate the economic viability of the project with the following adverse changes in costs and \nbenefits: (i) capital costs increased by 15%, (ii) vehicle operating cost benefit reduced by 15%, \n(iii)  value  of  time  benefit  reduced  by  15%,  (iv)  benefit  of  reduced  casualties  excluded,  and  (v) \ncapital costs increased by 15% and benefits reduced by 15%. In all scenarios, the EIRR of the \nproject remains above 9%, demonstrating the project\u2019s robustness. The economic viability of the \nproject is most sensitive to a 15% increase in capital costs and a 15% reduction in benefits, which \ndecreases the EIRR to 11.24%. In addition to quantified benefits, the project will have intangible \nbenefits, as it will contribute to the economic growth of the relatively poor populations in the vicinity \nof the project through the provision of improved access to income opportunities, as well as social, \nhealth, and education facilities. Carbon dioxide reduction benefits are calculated as $0.07 million \nper annum as a climate mitigation impact of the project. \n \n22. \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  project  will  not  generate  revenue.  The  government \nestablished the NRMF and local road maintenance funds in 2012 for better management of road \nmaintenance in the country. The NRMF\u2019s revenue comes from road user fees and supplementary \nnational  budget  while  the  local  road  maintenance  funds  come  from  road  user  fees  and \nsupplementary  provincial  budget.  With  the  NRMF,  the  national  road  maintenance  budget \n\n                                                \n14 ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nincreased  from  2013  to  2016,  and  the  per  km  maintenance  cost  for  national  roads  under \nmaintenance increased by about 70% in the same period. This indicates that the budget allocation \nfor  regular  maintenance  of  priority  national  roads  is  adequate. 16  The  MOT  confirmed  that \nprioritized allocation of operation and maintenance budget from the NRMF will be made to the \nproject roads. Provincial Road 175 in Yen Bai Province will be upgraded to a national highway, \nwhich will be maintained using the NRMF budget allocation. Further, with the sustained economic \ngrowth and increase in the number of vehicles, the government plans to gradually expand the \nrevenue  base  of  the  road  user  charges,  aiming  at  full  coverage  of  the  road  maintenance  and \nmajor rehabilitation needs in the long term. The effective utilization of the NRMF for this purpose \nis being supported by the World Bank. \n \nC. \n \n23. \nHaving  undertaken  several  ADB-financed  projects  in  the  past,  the  MOT  has  good \nexperience  and  understanding  of  ADB\u2019s  procurement  and  financial  management  policies  and \nprocedures.  Based  on  the  financial  management  assessment  carried  out  under  the  PPTA \n(footnote 14), the MOT has adequate capacity for procurement and financial management. The \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  and  project  website  will  be  developed  and  included  under  the \ncurrent  website  of  the  PMU2.17 ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  MOT.  The  financial  management  risk  is \nmoderate since the oversight by the MOT finance section has proven effective and the PMU2 has \nits own accounting staff to meet MOT requirements. An external financial auditor will be engaged \nfor the audits of the project financial statements under the project to ensure full compliance with \nADB\u2019s  requirements.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 13). \n \nD. \n \nPoverty  reduction  and  social  benefits  include  indirect  economic  benefits  and  direct \n24. \nbenefits  of  improved  rural  livelihood  productivity  through  the  livelihood  development  program \nintegrated in the RPs as well as enhanced community welfare through improved awareness of \nroad safety, and HIV/AIDS and human trafficking.18 The project design enhances social utility of \nthe roads for poor ethnic minorities, including women and children. Meaningful consultation will \nbe conducted throughout final project design and implementation. The social development and \nmitigation  activities  will  be  carried  out  principally  in  partnership  with  community-based \norganizations. The RPs and EMDPs provide targeted interventions to improving living standards \nof vulnerable people.19 Details of the HIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness program; the \nroad safety awareness program; and the consultation, participation, and communication plan will \nalso be provided for the people in the project area. The project is categorized as having some \ngender  elements.  Key  gender-related  activities  include  (i)  project  detailed  design  and \nimplementation  based  on  gender  and  social  responsiveness,  (ii)  unskilled  jobs  for  women \ngenerated from road construction, (iii) gender-responsive social protection for the labor force, (iv) \nwomen\u2019s  involvement  in  and  benefits  from  road  safety  awareness  and  enforcement,  and  (v) \nmitigation of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking risks because of improved connectivity. \n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n                                                \n16 World Bank.

An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was  prepared \nand  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  in  April  2018.21 Without  mitigation  measures,  the  project\u2019s \nenvironmental  impacts  have  the  potential to  be  significant. It  is  anticipated  that the  project  will \naffect 3 hectares of protected forest, including 1 hectare of protected forest in the Hoang Lien Van \nBan Nature Reserve (HLVBNR). This impact will be fully offset in compliance with the Viet Nam \nForestry Law (2018) and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The project design is consistent with \nthe  HLVBNR  master  plan  (2012). 22 The  project\u2019s  impacts  on  the  HLVBNR  and  its  protection \nobjectives will not be significant. Suitable disposal sites outside HLVBNR will need to be identified \nfor  the  disposal  of  the  estimated  6.3  million  cubic  meters  of  spoil.  Training  will  be  provided  to \nconstruction workers on the HLVBNR\u2019s sensitivities. \n \nOther  anticipated  construction-related  environmental  impacts  include  fugitive  dust, \n27. \nconstruction  noise,  temporary  traffic  disturbance,  and  occupational  and  community  safety  at \nconstruction sites. Adherence to the environmental management plan (EMP) will reduce residual \nimpact significance to an acceptable level. Incremental effects of operational traffic on ambient \nnoise and air quality are expected to be insignificant. The capacity of the PMU2 to oversee the \nEMP  implementation  will  be  strengthened  through  the  training  provided  by  the  construction \nsupervision  consultant  and  external  monitoring  consultant.  Public  consultation  involving  1,100 \npotentially affected people and more than 50 representatives from relevant local authorities was \ncarried out during EIA preparation to inform the project design and environmental assessment \nprocess. A grievance redress mechanism has been defined. \n \n28. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category A). A total of 776,897 square meters of private and \npublic  lands  in  Lai  Chau,  Lao  Cai  and  Yen  Bai  provinces  will  be  acquired,  affecting  957 \nhouseholds (4,370 affected people). Of these, 115 households (454 individuals) will be severely \naffected,  6  households  (28  individuals)  will  experience  physical  displacement,  and  634 \nhouseholds (2,669 individuals) will experience economic displacement because of loss of income \nfrom affected land or business. Three RPs compliant with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \nViet  Nam\u2019s  laws  have  been  prepared  to mitigate  the  impacts,  in  consultation  with  the  affected \nhouseholds.  The  RPs  were  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  23  August  2018.  Mitigation  of \ninvoluntary  resettlement  impacts  includes  compensation  at  replacement  cost  for  affected \nproperty;  assistance  with  resettlement  within  existing  communities;  a  livelihood  development \nprogram;  and  ongoing  meaningful  consultations,  including  detailed  needs  assessment  for \nlivelihood  development.  Details  of  the  grievance  redress  mechanism  are  included  in  the  RPs. \nCapacity building for PMU2 and local authorities will be provided by the supervision consultants. \n \n29. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  B).  Ethnic  minority  peoples  are  the  overwhelming \nmajority in the project areas (70% to 86% of the total population).23 Both positive and negative \nimpacts  have  been  identified.  The  ethnic  minorities  will  be  mainly  affected  by  involuntary  land \nacquisition and resettlement. Other identified risks include HIV transmission, human trafficking, \nand risks associated with road safety. Positive impacts include economic benefits from improved \n                                                \n20 ADB.
