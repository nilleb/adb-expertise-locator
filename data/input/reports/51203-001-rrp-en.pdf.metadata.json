ADB\u2019s  financing  will  meet  DFCC\u2019s  funding  requirements  for  medium-term  funding, \nwhich is in short supply. This will enable the bank to provide longer-tenor MSME loans and help \nthe bank diversify its funding sources. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \nBanking sector overview. The banking sector in Sri Lanka consists of seven licensed \n3. \nspecialized banks (LSBs) and 25 licensed commercial banks (LCBs),1 of which 13 are categorized \nas domestic banks and 12 are foreign banks.2 The banking sector has experienced rapid growth \nsince the end of the civil war in 2009. From 2009 to 2016, gross loans grew at an annual rate of \n19.5%. Total bank deposits grew at a slower pace of 16.0% per annum during the same period. \nThe  banking  sector\u2019s  asset  quality  has  improved  consistently  since  a  peaking  of  the \nnonperforming loan (NPL) ratio in 2013. The gross NPL ratio decreased from 3.2% at the end of \n2015 to 2.6% at the end of 2016 and then increased marginally to 2.7% in Q3 2017. The banking \nsector is sufficiently capitalized, with capital adequacy levels remaining largely stable since 2015. \nAt the end of Q3 2017, the total capital adequacy ratio (CAR) was 15.2%, compared with 15.6% \nat  the  end  of  2016  and  15.4%  at  the  end  of  2015.  In  July  2017,  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka \nintroduced the Basel III regulatory regime. To comply with the new requirements, several banks \nare strengthening capital, primarily via a combination of rights issues, subordinated bonds, and \nmore  conservative  dividend  policies.  Sector  profitability  is  stable  and  has  been  growing \nconsistently since 2009. In 2016, the profit after tax for the sector increased by 19.9% over the \nprevious  year,  driven  by  lower  operating  costs  and  better  asset  quality  and  leading  to  lower \nprovisions. Net profits continued growing by 20.3% in the first 9 months of 2017 (compared to the \ncorresponding period in 2016) because of lower operating costs. \n \n4. \nAccess  to  finance  by  micro,  small,  and medium-sized  enterprises. MSMEs  are  an \nimportant part of the Sri Lankan economy. In 2013, they accounted for 35% of total employment, \n30% of gross domestic product, and 20% of total exports, and they accounted for 99.5% of all \nenterprises in the country.3 Although Sri Lanka has many banks and nonbank financial institutions \n(NBFIs),  access  to  credit  remains  a  major  issue.  A  2011  study  by  the  International  Finance \nCorporation listed difficulties in obtaining bank finance as one of the top five constraints to the \ndevelopment and expansion of MSMEs in Sri Lanka.4 Studies also revealed that the difficulties \nthat small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have in accessing credit in Sri Lanka are the \n\n                                                \n1   The  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  issues  banking  licenses  for  two  categories  of  banks:  LCBs  and  LSBs.  LCBs  are \npermitted to accept demand deposits from the public and can act as authorized dealers in foreign exchange.  LSBs \ncannot do either activity. \n\n2   Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n3   N.  Yoshino  and  F.  Taghizadeh-Hesary.  2017.  Solutions  for  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises\u2019  Difficulties  in \n\nAccessing Finance: Asian Experiences. ADB Institute Working Paper Series. No. 768. Tokyo: ADB Institute. \n4  International Finance Corporation. 2011. Enterprise Surveys: Sri Lanka Country Profile 2011. Washington, DC  \n \n\n\fresult of (i) shortcomings within SMEs, including poor financial literacy, lack of market knowledge, \nand  lack  of  transparency;  (ii)  shortcomings  within  financial  institutions,  including  a  risk-averse \nbanking culture, heavy reliance on collateral, and lack of understanding of genuine SME-oriented \nbanking  practices;  and  (iii)  shortcomings  within  market  infrastructure,  including  insufficient \nmechanisms to improve information asymmetries in SME banking.5 The Government of Sri Lanka \nidentified three major problems affecting MSMEs\u2019 access to finance: (i) unavailability of funds and \nother  credit  instruments;  (ii)  limited  access  to  equity  and  loan  capital;  and  (iii)  financial \nmismanagement.6 As a result, the government has introduced a number of SME finance initiatives \nto  address  these  problems.  Over  the  years,  the  country  has  also  improved  its  market \ninfrastructure for MSME finance, including the establishment of a credit bureau, the introduction \nof  an  electronic  searchable  collateral  registry,  increased  reliability  of  property  rights,  and  a \nfunctioning bankruptcy and insolvency system. Hence, despite challenges in lending to MSMEs, \nmore financial institutions have started to focus on MSME lending and have been expanding their \nnetwork and accessibility throughout the country. \n\n5. \nInvestment rationale. ADB has been active in Sri Lanka in the finance sector providing \ncritically needed medium- and long-tenor funding to a variety of financial institutions. Through its \nnonsovereign  operations,  ADB  has  funded  financial  institutions  that  have  demonstrated  the \ncommitment and ability to serve the needs of the financially excluded, as well as other segments. \nIn 2013, ADB provided a $15 million senior loan to Nations Trust Bank to support SME finance in \nSri Lanka.7 In 2015, ADB approved a project providing senior loans to two NBFIs for MSMEs in \nSri Lanka.8 Given the continued difficulty faced by MSMEs in accessing finance, DFCC has been \nidentified as a good partner to support continued financing of this critical sector. DFCC has been \nfunding  MSMEs  since  it  was  established  in  1955  with  a  mandate  to  spearhead  development \nfinancing in a newly independent nation. It had a broad network of 102 branches and 36 service \noutlets  located  inside  branches  of  Sri  Lanka  Post  across the  country  as  of  2017.  Since  2016, \nDFCC  has  been  actively  targeting  an  emerging subsegment  called  small  business  enterprises \n(SBEs),  which  are  formal  microenterprises.  SBE  financing  is  considered  part  of  the  \u201cmissing \nmiddle,\u201d  as  the  financial  requirements  of  SBEs  are  more  complex  than  loans  provided  by \nmicrofinance institutions and they are considered too risky or costly for commercial banks. DFCC \nhas  good  corporate  governance,  strong  management,  and  satisfactory  financial  performance. \nThrough its nonsovereign operations, ADB has a relationship with DFCC and its former subsidiary \nDFCC  Vardhana Bank  (DVB).  DVB  joined ADB\u2019s  Trade  Finance  Program  in 2004,  and  ADB\u2019s \nBoard also  approved  a $15 million  loan  to  DVB for  housing finance  in 2012.9   DFCC  is  also a \nparticipant in ADB\u2019s Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Line of Credit Project.10  \n \n \n\n                                                \n5   A.

A total of \n$12.5 million has been disbursed to DFCC under this project in 2017 and 2018. \n\n2 \n \n\n \n\n\fBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\nB. \n \n6. \nOverview. The Government of Sri Lanka founded DFCC in 1955, with support from the \nWorld Bank; DFCC was listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange in 1956. Initially established as \nan LSB under Sri Lankan law, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) regulations required DFCC \nto focus on providing long-term finance with tenors of at least 5 years (referred to as development \nfinance, which also included project finance). In 2003, DFCC acquired over 94% of a local LCB, \nwhich  was  subsequently  rebranded  as  DVB.  DVB  operated  as  an  independent  subsidiary  of \nDFCC until it was absorbed by its parent on 1 October 2015. At the time of amalgamation, DVB \nrepresented  just  over  half  of  the  amalgamated  entity\u2019s  total  assets.  The  amalgamated  entity, \nDFCC, became an LCB. The integration of the two entities has since been completed, and DFCC \nshowed significant improvement in its performance in 2016. At the end of 2016, the total assets \nof the bank were SLRs291 billion, and it ranked sixth among all LCBs in Sri Lanka with a market \nshare of 3.7%. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \nC. \n \n7. \nOwnership. DFCC is publicly traded and is listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. As of \n31  December  2017,  the  government  indirectly  controlled  a  35.1%  interest,  held  via  Bank  of \nCeylon\u2019s pension fund (14.4%), Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (10.0%), and the Employees\u2019 \nProvident Fund and the Employees\u2019 Trust Fund (combined 10.7%).11 Other shareholders include \nHatton  National  Bank  (12.2%)  and  five  funds  of  Aberdeen  Asset  Management  PLC  (United \nKingdom) (aggregate 9.5%). Muzaffar Ali Yaseen, a prominent businessman in the textile sector \nin  Sri  Lanka  owns  9.9%.  The  other  shareholders  with  over  5%  stakes  are  Melstacorp  (8.4%), \nRenuka Group (6.1%),  and  Seafeld International  (5.8%).  Melstacorp is  ultimately  controlled  by \nHarry Jayawardena. ADB has conducted integrity due diligence.12 Further information is provided \nin the Integrity and Tax Due Diligence Disclosure.13 \n \n8. \nCorporate  governance.  DFCC  is  a  board-driven  company  with  five  independent \ndirectors, one executive director, and two non-executive directors nominated by shareholders (as \nof  2017).14 C.R.  Jansz,  a  non-executive  director,  has  been  the  chairman  since  August  2014. \nJansz  oversaw  the  merger  between  DFCC  and  DVB  and  has  many  years  of  experience  in \nlogistics, insurance, banking, and finance relating to international trade. The board monitors and \napproves  DFCC\u2019s  major  financial  and  business  strategies  and  policies.  It  oversees  the \nmechanisms for financial control, internal control, and risk management, and it ensures that the \nprocesses  are  in  place  for  strict  compliance  with  applicable  laws.  The  board  has  established \nmultiple committees, including an audit committee, credit approval committee, credit restructure \ncommittee,  human  resources  and  remuneration  committee,  nomination  and  governance \ncommittee, integrated risk management committee, and related party transactions committee. \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n11  Ownership, Management, and Governance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12  ADB. 2003.

In \n\nFebruary 2018, a director appointed by the government filled a vacant board position. \n\n3 \n \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nUse of proceeds. DFCC will use the proceeds of ADB\u2019s debt financing to finance loans \n\n \nA. \n \n9. \nADB will provide a senior loan of up to $50 million for up to 6 years to DFCC to improve \naccess to finance for MSMEs. At least 5% of the ADB loan will be used to support MSMEs owned \nor managed by women,15 and 20% of the proceeds of the ADB loan will be onlent to businesses \nlocated outside Colombo. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nand leases to MSMEs in Sri Lanka. \n \n11. \nReporting arrangements. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department will monitor the \nproject.  DFCC  will,  at  predetermined  regular  intervals  and  as  requested,  provide  ADB  with \nfinancial reports, including (i) quarterly unaudited financial statements; (ii) annual audited financial \nstatements; (iii) quarterly compliance certificates for financial covenants; (iv) annual reporting on \nthe  MSME  loan  portfolios;  and  (v)  annual  reporting  on  environmental  and  social  performance, \nincluding  gender  equality  and  selected  development  indicators  agreed  upon  by  ADB  and  the \nborrower. \n \n12. \nEvaluation. DFCC will prepare monitoring reports and submit them to ADB regularly, and \nat  least  annually.  The  bank  will  submit  the  first  report  no  later  than  12  months  after  the  first \ndisbursement. \n \nC.  \n \n13. \nProvide access to longer-tenor debt in support of micro, small and medium-sized \nenterprises. The ADB 6-year loan will provide critically needed longer-tenor funding to MSMEs \nin Sri Lanka, whose ability to access funds has been constrained by a variety of factors. Longer-\ntenor financing for financial institutions is needed given the country\u2019s low level of finance sector \ndevelopment\u2014including  the  absence  of  a  well-developed  capital  market\u2014which  limits  the \navailability of such funding. ADB\u2019s funding will also help support improved access to finance in \nrural areas, which had a poverty incidence of 82.2% in 2016, as compared with 8.0% in urban \nareas. While DFCC has been successful in gradually increasing its CASA deposits, it still relies \non wholesale borrowing to fund part of its lending operations. The ADB loan will be a long-term \nand stable funding source not readily available from other commercial banks. \n \nGender mainstreaming. Women lack access to finance in Sri Lanka. The International \n14. \nFinance Corporation estimated that women entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka face a credit gap of $350 \nmillion.16 ADB will help strengthen DFCC\u2019s outreach to women entrepreneurs and bolster internal \npolicies  pertaining  to  women.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming  in \ndesign, as it aims to increase the number of SBE women borrowers by 3 times and SME women \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n                                                \n15  At end 2017, 1.09% of the outstanding SME loans were to women; 0.68% of the SME loans disbursement in 2017 \n\nwere to women. \n\n16  Daily  Mirror.  2018.

The output will be an increase in DFCC\u2019s lending capacity to MSMEs, including \n\nOutcome. The project\u2019s outcome will be the sustainability of DFCC\u2019s increased lending \n\n \nA. \n \n15. \nImpacts. The impacts of the project will be (i) the development of mechanisms for easy \nand  affordable  access  to  finance  by  MSMEs;  and  (ii)  the  enhancement  of  access  to  finance, \nparticularly in the MSME sector. \n \n16. \ncapacity to MSMEs. \n \n17. \nbusinesses owned or managed by women and those located outside Colombo. \n \nB. \n \n18. \nAlignment  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  Under  the  Midterm  Review  of \nStrategy  2020,  ADB  aims  to strengthen  its  support  for  the  finance sector  by  (i)  supporting  the \ndevelopment of financial infrastructure, institutions, and products and services; and (ii) promoting \ninclusive  growth. 18 The  proposed  project  supports  the  midterm  review\u2019s  strategic  agenda  of \npromoting  inclusive  economic  growth  by  facilitating  more  inclusive  access  to  economic \nopportunities, including jobs offered by MSMEs. It contributes to private sector development, a \nkey driver of change under the midterm review.
