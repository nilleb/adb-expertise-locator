I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $500 million to Southern Gas Corridor CJSC (SGC) for the Shah Deniz Gas Field \nExpansion Project in Azerbaijan.1 A separate report and recommendation for a partial credit \nguarantee (PCG) with sovereign guarantee of up to $500 million in favor of commercial lenders \nto SGC is being processed concurrently.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n2.  Project identification. The Shah Deniz gas field is one of the world\u2019s largest gas fields, \nwith around 1,000 cubic meters (bcm) of gas reserves. In 1996, the State Oil Company of the \nAzerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) signed the Shah Deniz Production Sharing Agreement (SDPSA) \nwith  six  foreign  oil  and  gas  companies  including  BP  (the  operator)  for  the  exploration, \ndevelopment, and production of natural resources from the Shah Deniz gas field. Construction \nand development of Shah Deniz Stage 1 (SD1) started in 2003 and gas production commenced \nin December 2006. In September 2013, subsequent to the discovery of a new high-pressure \nreservoir within the Shah Deniz gas field, gas sales agreements (GSAs) for the expansion of the \ngas field were signed with nine European energy companies. In December 2013, the SDPSA \npartners announced their investment decision for the development of Shah Deniz Stage 2 \n(SD2). \n \n3.  SGC has a 16.67% interest in the SDPSA.3 SGC approached the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) in January 2016 to partly finance its share of the capital expenditure for the Shah \nDeniz Gas Field Expansion project.4 From initial discussions between ADB and SGC, ADB \ndetermined  that  the  project  possessed  sound  fundamentals,  including  high-quality  project \npreparatory work, an experienced operator, and strong local employment-generation potential. \nThe project is the largest gas field development project to date in Azerbaijan, and will help \nincrease the total gas production in Azerbaijan from 20 bcm per annum in 2015 to 36 bcm per \nannum by 2022. ADB\u2019s familiarity with the project (through its earlier financing to one of the \nother parties to the SDPSA5) and its experience in structuring emerging and frontier market \ntransactions will be crucial for the successful financing of the project and to demonstrate the \nbankability of large-scale financings for future upstream and downstream processing projects in \nAzerbaijan. \n \n4.  Confidential information deleted. \n \n5.  SD2 includes the construction of two new bridge-linked offshore production platforms, 26 \nsubsea wells drilled with two semi-submersible rigs, 500 kilometers of subsea pipelines, and \nexpansion of the onshore gas processing terminal at Sangachal. Gas extracted from SD2 will be \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Partial Credit Guarantee for the Shah Deniz Gas Field Expansion Project in Azerbaijan. Manila. \n3  A 6.7% interest was transferred to SGC by SOCAR in July 2014 under an outright sale and purchase agreement, \nwhile the remaining 10.0% interest will be transferred by SOCAR pursuant to the provisions of a deferred sale and \npurchase agreement. \n4  Capital expenditures for the project are funded by SDPSA partners in proportion to their percent interest in the \nSDPSA. \n5  ADB. 2015.

The SDPSA sets the basic principles, rights and obligations, production sharing, cost \nreimbursement, and other terms and conditions of the Shah Deniz project. A steering committee \nconsisting  of  an  equal  number  of  members  from  each  SDPSA  partner  is  responsible  for \nmanaging  the  consortium.  BP,  designated  as  the  operator  for  the  project  by  the  SDPSA \npartners,  is  responsible  for  construction  and  operation  of  the  Shah  Deniz  gas  field.  The \nremaining SDPSA partners, including SGC, are purely financial investors and are not involved in \nday-to-day operation of the project. Table 1 lists the composition of the SDPSA. \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n7.  Confidential information deleted. \n \n8.  Confidential information deleted. \n \n9.  The sponsors of SGC are the Republic of Azerbaijan and SOCAR. The Azerbaijan \neconomy depends heavily on the hydrocarbon sector, which represented about 31% of the \ngross domestic product and 87% of merchandise exports in 2015.6 The sharp decline in oil \nprices in 2015\u20132016 has led to a significant drop in foreign exchange reserves to $5 billion in \n2016 from a peak of $15 billion in 2014, resulting in a devaluation of the Azerbaijan manat by \n50% against the United States dollar. The Azerbaijan economy is expected to contract by 1% in \n2016. Sustained investment in the expansion of the Shah Deniz gas field and timely completion \nof the project are important to return the Azerbaijan economy to real positive growth in 2017. \nStandard & Poor\u2019s credit rating for Azerbaijan as of July 2016 stood at BB+ with a negative \noutlook.  SOCAR  is  a  vertically  integrated  oil  and  gas  company  active  in  exploration  and \nproduction of oil and gas, production of petroleum products and petrochemicals, and marketing \nand distribution of these products in Azerbaijan and international markets. SOCAR is 100% \nowned by the Republic of Azerbaijan. SOCAR had total revenues of AZN33,103 million in 2015, \nwith an operating income of AZN1,287 million and a loss after tax of AZN1,785 million. As of 31 \nDecember 2015, the total assets of SOCAR were AZN39,954 million and its net worth was \nAZN14,648 million. \n \n10.  Confidential information deleted. \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n11.  Impacts. The successful development of SD2 will lead to the following beyond-project \ndevelopment impacts: \n(i)  The overall Azerbaijan natural gas sector will expand by encouraging foreign \noperators to develop similar gas reserves, bringing in much-needed technical \nknowledge, development experience, and foreign capital. \n(ii)  The  increase  in  gas  production  and  opening  of  the  European  market  to \nAzerbaijan gas exports will improve regional integration and diversify Azerbaijani \nexports of natural gas. \n                                                \n6  Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services. 2016. Azerbaijan Country Rating Update, 29 January. London. ", "  3\n(iii)  The successful experience of foreign commercial banks financing a large project \nin Azerbaijan will help increase foreign direct investment for the development of \nother  upstream  gas  field  development  projects  as  well  as  midstream  and \ndownstream petrochemical projects, which use natural gas as feedstock. \n \n12.  Outcome. The project will result in successful production of natural gas from SD2, with \nfirst  production  estimated  in  2018  and  peak  incremental  production of  16 bcm  per  annum \nachieved by 2022. The increased gas production for the export market will result in increased \nrevenues for the government.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n   \n13.  Outputs. The successful implementation of the project will result in two outputs: (i) the \nenvironmentally safe and technically sound development of the largest proven gas reserve in \nAzerbaijan, and (ii) the creation of over 19,000 temporary jobs during construction and 1,800 \npermanent jobs during operation of the project. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n14.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project supports two of \nthe ten strategic priorities under ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: infrastructure, and \nregional cooperation and integration.7 ADB is committed to be a provider of catalytic solutions to \nupper  middle-income  countries  such  as  Azerbaijan,  which  include  increasing  leveraging \nopportunities with private capital. The project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy, 2014\u20132018 for Azerbaijan, which supports ADB\u2019s participation in the development of \nnatural  resources  in  instances  where  it  would  be  instrumental  in  attracting  third-party \ncommercial sources of credit.8  \n \n15.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations. The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which provides for assistance to gas field development, \nand transportation and distribution of gas.9 The project promotes effective regional cooperation \nin  the  energy  sector  to  strengthen  energy  security  and  is  consistent with  ADB\u2019s  Regional \nCooperation and Integration Strategy as well as the Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation \nand  Integration.10 In  2008,  ADB  endorsed  the  Extractive  Industries  Transparency  Initiative \n(EITI), which encourages governments to disclose their revenues, as well as companies to \npublicize their payments from oil, gas, and mining projects, in order to promote transparency \nand good governance. Azerbaijan has been a member country of the EITI since 2005 and was \nclassified as an EITI-compliant country from 2009 to 2015. In April 2015, Azerbaijan\u2019s EITI \nstatus was downgraded from compliant to candidate based on concerns related to the ability of \ncivil society to participate meaningfully in the EITI process in the country. Azerbaijan is currently \nimplementing corrective actions recommended by the EITI. Notwithstanding Azerbaijan\u2019s EITI \nstatus, the operator of the project, BP, regularly discloses production volumes as well as capital \nand operating expenditure incurred in connection with the project. SOFAZ also discloses the \nrevenue earned from the project along with taxes and other payments received from the SDPSA \npartners. The SDPSA has also been publicly disclosed. \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014.

In August 2015, the ADB Board of Directors approved a loan facility of up \nto $475 million to Lukoil Overseas Shah Deniz to partly fund its share of the capital expenditure \nfor the Shah Deniz Gas Field Expansion Project (footnote 5). In August 2011, the ADB Board of \nDirectors approved financial assistance for the Kandym Gas Field Development Project in \nUzbekistan, comprising a loan of up to $100 million and a partial risk guarantee of up to $200 \nmillion to commercial lenders for development of the Kandym gas field in Uzbekistan.11 ADB\u2019s \ncontinued engagement in oil and gas in the region will help improve standards of corporate \ngovernance and transparency in the sector. \n \nD.

Table 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  Exploration of, development of, and production from the Shah Deniz gas field is being \ncarried out under the SDPSA, which sets the basic principles, rights and obligations, \nproduction sharing, cost reimbursement, and other terms and conditions for the Shah \nDeniz project.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \nThe SDPSA governs the main compensation and cost recovery mechanism, which \ncompensates the SDPSA operator (BP) for all operating costs. The balance of the \nproduction is shared between the Government of Azerbaijan and SDPSA partners \naccording  to  an  industry-typical  R-factor  model,  which  compensates  the  SDPSA \npartners at higher levels when capital expenditure is higher. \nManagement  SGC\u2019s management structure consists of the general assembly of its shareholders, its \nsupervisory board and its general director, who together with other officers of SGC, are \nresponsible for the day-to-day management of SGC. \nImplementation period  Gas production from Shah Deniz Stage 2 is expected to commence in 2018, gradually \nramping up during 2019\u20132021, and stabilizing at 16 bcm per annum from 2022 onward. \nConstruction arrangements \nType of arrangement  A contracts committee and a management committee supervise the procurement of \ngoods and services in line with the provisions of the JOA. BP, as SDPSA operator, will \nconstruct the main offshore works and will subcontract specialized subsea construction \nworks and onshore construction works to a number of contractors. \nContractor  BP,  the  SDPSA  operator,  is  one  of  the  world\u2019s  leading  integrated  oil  and  gas \ncompanies.  BP  has  been  operating  in  Azerbaijan  since  1994  and  has  adequate \nexperience and capability to execute the project. \nOperations arrangements \nRevenue structure  The Consolidated Upstream Purchase Agreement governs the sale of gas by the \n  SDPSA partners to AGSC. BP is appointed as the sellers\u2019 representative and agent for \nthe sale of gas to AGSC. The shareholder composition of AGSC is similar to that of the \nSDPSA.  \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2011.

SGC has signed a \ncrude oil sales agency agreement with SOCAR Marketing and Operations (a wholly \nowned subsidiary of SOCAR) for the sale of condensate from the project. \nTransportation  Natural gas from the project will be delivered to end-use off-takers via three contiguous \narrangements  pipelines: the South Caucasus Pipeline from the Caspian Sea to the Georgia\u2013Turkey \nborder, the Trans Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline from the Georgia\u2013Turkey border to \nthe Turkey\u2013Greece border, and the Trans Adriatic Pipeline from the Turkey\u2013Greece \nborder to Italy. AGSC has entered into gas transportation agreements with the South \nCaucasus Pipeline, the Trans Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline, and the Trans Adriatic \nPipeline. \nOperation and  BP, as SDPSA operator, will be responsible for operation and maintenance activities. \nmaintenance \nPerformance monitoring  Key performance indicators will be reported by SGC and monitored by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank. \nAGSC = Azerbaijan Gas Supply Company, bcm = billion cubic meters, GSA = gas supply agreement, JOA = Joint \nOperating Agreement, SDPSA = Shah Deniz Production Sharing Agreement, SGC = Southern Gas Corridor CJSC, \nSOCAR = State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic. \nSource: SGC. \n \nF.

The proposed ADB assistance to SGC to finance its share of the Shah Deniz Gas Field \nExpansion Project comprises a direct nonsovereign loan of up to $500 million.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n22.  The proposed transaction merits ADB\u2019s assistance for the following reasons: \n(i)  The ADB loan will play a leading catalytic role, as it facilitates the raising of large-\nscale, long-term commercial financing from international banks, which will set a \nprecedent for international banks to participate in upcoming projects in the oil and \ngas sector in the country. \n(ii)  ADB\u2019s participation in the transaction will further improve corporate governance \nand transparency in the oil and gas sector in the country. ADB\u2019s participation in \nthe  transaction  has  prompted  the  disclosure  of  certain  safeguards-related \ndocuments, notably the fishing livelihood management plan. \n(iii)  ADB\u2019s participation in the transaction will help the government to continue the \ndevelopment of one of its largest revenue-generating assets in challenging times \nglobally for oil and gas investments. \n \nC.  Risks \n23.  Confidential information deleted. \n ", "6 \n \n24.  Construction  and  completion  risk.  BP  is  responsible  for  the  construction  of  the \nproject. The construction plan is highly complex, but benefits from BP\u2019s extensive technical \nexperience. Construction is progressing as per schedule with adequate contingencies for any \nincrease  in  project  costs.  However,  challenges  in  project  completion  remain,  and  the \ncomprehensive government guarantee for the tenor of the loan is a useful credit enhancement. \n \n25.

The  SDPSA  operator,  BP,  has  extensive  experience  in  the \ndevelopment and operation of gas fields in Algeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, Indonesia, the United \nKingdom, and the United States. BP has successfully operated SD1 since 2006, which provides \ninvaluable technical knowledge and clear understanding of operational issues. The operating \nand financial strength of BP gives lenders comfort that the operations risk is manageable. \n \n30.  Confidential information deleted. \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n31.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory  A  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been \nidentified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. In line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement requirements for financing of existing facilities, an environmental and social \ncompliance audit for the existing facilities of SD1 and ongoing construction activities as part of \nSD2 was carried out in July 2015 and updated in August 2016. The updated audit did not find \nany noncompliance with ADB policies associated with the ongoing construction activities that \nwould  require  the  establishment  of  a  corrective  action  plan. The  institutional  capacity  and \ncommitment  of  SGC  to  cause  the  operator,  BP,  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n32.  Sangachal  Bay  in  the  Caspian  Sea,  where  the  project  is  located,  contains  key \nbiodiversity areas. According to the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA), the \nShah Deniz contract area, existing terminal boundary, and SD2 expansion area are not located \nin the key biodiversity areas. The SD2 contract area overlaps with the migration routes and \nspawning areas of some fish species. The ESIA indicates that construction impacts are minimal, \nwith fish having previously demonstrated avoidance behaviors. Fishing is the dominant threat to \nfish populations in the Caspian Sea. Existing fish population monitoring programs established \nfor SD1 are satisfactory to ADB and will continue. The contract area may have some overlap \nwith Caspian seal migration pathways. BP engages with and provides support to Caspian Sea \nconservation programs, which provide a whole-of-sea approach to seal conservation. BP has in \nplace an ecological and wildlife management plan. ADB will require the borrower to procure ", "  7\nwithin  its  project  powers,  and  will  monitor  that  the  operator  implements  the  project,  in \ncompliance with the relevant plans and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. \n \n33.  Under the terms of the SDPSA, land for terminal operations and any other facilities \nneeded  are  to  be  acquired  by  SOCAR  and  made  available  to  the  operator.  SOCAR  has \ntransferred all lands required for the SD2 project to the operator. The audit confirmed that no \nresettlement issues, including access rights or temporary usage of lands, existed as a result of \nthe SD1 facilities and the sites proposed for expansion of the terminal as part of SD2. No \nindigenous communities are located in the project influence area, so impacts on indigenous \npeoples are not expected. The operator has prepared and implemented a small-scale fishing \nlivelihood  management  plan  to  address  economic  displacement  impacts  on  48  fishermen \ninvolved  in  small-scale  fishing  activities  resulting  from  SD2  pipeline  installation  works  in \nSangachal  Bay,  owing  to  enforcement  of  a  marine  exclusion  zone  for  9.5  months  from \nDecember 2014 to September 2015. All affected fishermen have resumed their fishing activities \nat the same location, with the exception of six fishermen who voluntarily chose to move to \nanother location about 40 kilometers from Sangachal Bay. These six fishermen have reported \nadditional impacts due to increased transportation costs and lower productivity at the new \nfishing location. The operator is working out arrangements to address these unanticipated \nimpacts  in  consultation  with  the  affected  fishermen.  The  operator  will  monitor  the  fishing \nlivelihood management plan implementation and prepare a closure report once all residual \ngrievances are satisfactorily addressed. \n \n34.  The borrower will be required to procure within its project powers that the operator \ncomplies with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001), will \ntake  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards.12 The \nborrower will report regularly to ADB on the compliance of the operator (and its contractors) with \nsuch laws. Information disclosure and consultations with affected people are expected to be \nconducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n35.  SGC was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.
