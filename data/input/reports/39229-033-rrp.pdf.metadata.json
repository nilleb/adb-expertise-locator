THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) proposed \nloans to Mongolia for the additional financing of the Agriculture and Rural Development Project, \nand (ii) the proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction for Supporting Agriculture Value Chain.1 \n \n2.  The additional financing will primarily help Mongolia increase the value addition on its \nrich  yet  underutilized  livestock  and  other  agricultural  resources  through  (i)  value  chain \ninvestments (VCIs) by agro-enterprises and cooperatives, (ii) capacity strengthening of primary \nproducers  and  processors,  (iii)  improvement  of  marketing  and  technical  capacity  of  agro-\nenterprises and cooperatives, and (iv) development of Mongolian product brand(s). As a result, \nthe additional financing is expected to generate employment opportunities and help diversify the \nMongolian economy, which has been driven by the mining sector. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved on 29 September 2008 a grant of $14.72 \nmillion from its Asian Development Fund (ADF) for the Agriculture and Rural Development \nProject (current project).2 The revised closing date of the current project grant is 31 December \n2015. The current project was supported by associated TA of $2 million from the Japan Special \nFund for Agricultural Marketing and Brand Development. The current project aims at a reliable \nsupply  of  premium-value  agricultural  products  to  niche  markets  by  selected  enterprises.  It \ncomprises two outputs: (i) value chains able to deliver unique, premium-value products to niche \nmarkets; and (ii) fully defined process and institutional arrangements for collaborative brand \ndevelopment and management developed and demonstrated. \n \n4.  Agriculture sector is the backbone of the Mongolian economy and considered a key for \ndiversifying the economy, which relies too heavily on the mining sector. In 2013, Mongolian \nagricultural primary products accounted for 20.1% and processed products for about 11.1% of \nMongolia\u2019s gross domestic product. They are also the second largest export products after \nmineral  products,  accounting  for  8.2%  of  total  exports  by  value  in  2013.3 However,  the \nagriculture sector is mostly concentrated on primary production and forgoing significant value \naddition in agriculture because of limited processing capacity. The bottleneck is lack of long-\nterm financing, which has significantly hindered Mongolian agro-enterprises from making long-\nterm investments to improve their productivity. As a result, Mongolia exports a significant portion \nof its agricultural products (e.g., wool, cashmere, and animal skins) after primary processing \nwhile it imports a substantial volume of processed or final products (e.g., dairy products). It is \ncrucial for Mongolia to capitalize on the rich yet untapped resources of the agriculture sector, \nwhich employed 30% of the labor force in 2013. Development of the agro-processing industry \nwill have a substantial impact on employment, in itself and through its backward linkages, in \nrural areas, where the poor comprised 33.3% of the population in 2012, and consequently \ncontribute to sustainable and equitable development of the nation. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2008.

The current project is considered to be performing \nwell4 based on the five standards stipulated in the relevant section of the operations manual.5 \n \n(i)  Output delivery. The current project made progress toward the outcome and \nlargely accomplished outputs 1 and 2. Against the outcome, the current project \nenabled 12 project participating enterprises (PPEs) to start selling some of their \nproducts to international and domestic premium-value buyers, but establishment \nof business partnerships will take longer. Against output 1, the current project \nfinanced 12 PPEs to develop their respective value chains to deliver higher-value \nproducts.6 Those PPEs have realized noticeable improvements in product quality \nand  productivity,  and  significant  job  creation  directly  at  the  enterprises  and \nindirectly at the producers of raw materials.7 The current project also provided \n(a) equipment and supplies to livestock testing centers and veterinary service \ncenters of six selected provinces; and (b) machinery, equipment, and agricultural \ninputs, as well as training to selected agricultural cooperatives to improve the \nquality and production of raw materials.8 Against output 2, the current project \ndeveloped a framework for brand development, applied it to animal fiber and its \nproducts, and developed a Mongolian brand certification mark, Mongolian Noble \nFiber. The  certification mark  has  been registered  at the  intellectual  property \noffices of Mongolia and 33 selected countries. \n(ii)  Implementation progress. Implementation progress is satisfactory: 98.9% of \ndisbursements and 98.9% of contract awards against 94.8% of elapsed time as \nof 14 August 2015. \n(iii)  Safeguard compliance. Safeguard requirements have been met satisfactorily. \nEnvironmental  and  social  safeguard  screening  procedures  have  been  well \nestablished under the current project and applied to every subproject. \n(iv)  Management of risks. The report and recommendation of the President for the \ncurrent project identified (a) inadequate capacity of the enterprises to implement \ntheir investment plans, (b) delays in procurement processes, (c) delivery delays \nby contractors, and (d) misuse of funds by enterprises. Project implementation \nsupport provided by the project management unit (PMU) successfully managed \nmost of the risks by assisting the PPEs in ensuring that VCI subloan proposals \nare feasible and by closely monitoring the PPEs\u2019 implementation of the proposals. \n(v)  On-track rating. The performance of the current project is rated on track. \n \n6.  Additional financing eligibility criteria met. ADB\u2019s due diligence confirmed that the \nadditional financing meets the eligibility criteria and standards.9 The additional financing is in line \nwith the Government of Mongolia\u2019s action program for 2012\u20132016, which places the highest \npriority on employment generation.10 The additional financing will fully support ADB\u2019s interim \ncountry partnership strategy, 2014\u20132016 for Mongolia, which restores the core sector status of \n                                                \n4  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5  ADB. 2011. Additional Financing. Operations Manual. OM H5/OP. Manila (para. 3). \n6  Against the target of 15, fewer PPEs were assisted because the actual subloan amounts were larger than the \nsubloan amounts estimated during project preparation. \n7  ADB required a VCI proposal as well as financial, environmental, and social due diligence reports for each subloan \nunder the current project, and will continue to do so under the additional financing. \n8  Contract farming between the PPEs and herders for primary livestock-based products (e.g., cashmere, wool, and \nleather) was found difficult because the PPEs and domestic producers are not able to offer competitive prices to \nkeep herders in contracts, as the middlemen usually offer higher prices in bulk purchases. \n9  ADB. 2011.

Additional financing  priority  met.13 The additional financing has a high degree of \nreadiness since implementation capacity is well advanced and safeguard requirements have \nbeen met. The PMU\u2019s capacity for due diligence, including that for safeguards, built during the \ncurrent project, adds a distinctive feature. The subproject selection criteria, approval procedure, \nand monitoring mechanism, established under the current project, will continue to be applied.14 \n \n8.  Changes  in  project  scope.  The  additional  financing  will  assist  the  government  in \nscaling up and modifying the scope of the current project that is performing well. In response to \nthe government request, the project will (i) include additional subsectors,15 (ii) adopt a regular \nonlending modality,16 and (iii) expand the range of subloans by lowering the minimum amount.17 \nThe project will focus not only on export-oriented subsectors, but also on subsectors oriented for \ndomestic markets, smaller-scale agro-enterprises, and cooperatives. Consequently, the focus of \nproject impact and outcome was changed from the promotion of partnerships with premium-\nvalue buyers to economic diversification through higher value addition to agricultural resources. \n \n9.  Lessons from the current project were incorporated in the project design. First, it became \nclear that PPEs do not have sufficient technical and marketing capacity to establish business \nrelationships with buyers of high-value products, particularly international ones. In response, two \nbroad outputs under the current project were articulated into four outputs to factor in capacity \nimprovement of agro-enterprises and primary producers in the project design. Second, the \ncurrent project was implemented with three separate PMUs, according to project component, \nand experienced high costs of operation and difficult coordination between the components. To \naddress such issues, the PMUs will be integrated into a single PMU with three subunits: a VCI \nsubloan processing subunit for output 1 and two technical advisory subunits, one responsible for \noutput 2 and the other for outputs 3 and 4.18 \n   \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2014.

During project implementation, more subsectors and business types \nrelating to agro-processing and agriculture may be added. \n16 Under the current project, the government provides a project participating bank (PPB) with an actual credit transfer \nequivalent to 50% of the subloan amount free of charge as a guarantee. This guarantee mechanism was designed \nto support the PPBs\u2019 lending to the agro-processing industry and served the purpose under the current project \nfinanced by a grant. With additional financing from loans, the government will relend loan proceeds to the PPBs for \nsubsequent onlending to the PPEs. \n17 The additional financing will set the minimum amount at $150,000, instead of $600,000 under the current project. \n18 Under the current project, three PMUs had been set up in different offices for the (i) value chain development \ncomponent, (ii) rural infrastructure and services development component, and (iii) associated TA. \n ", "4 \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n10.  The impacts of the overall project will be (i) competitiveness of the agriculture processing \nindustry enhanced, (ii) private sector-led employment generated, and (iii) SMEs developed. The \noutcome  of  the  overall  project  will  be  value  addition  on  Mongolian  agricultural  resources \nincreased by PPEs. The project is expected to increase primarily the agro-processing capacity \nand secondarily primary agricultural production in Mongolia, and hence increase value addition \nto  agricultural  resources.  The  increased  capacity  will  lead  to  employment  generation,  and \nindirectly  benefit  herders,  farmers,  and  primary  processors  through  the  PPEs\u2019  increased \ndemand for raw materials (footnote 8). \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  The overall project will have the following outputs: (i) VCIs financed, (ii) production \ncapacity of herders and farmers improved, (iii) enterprises\u2019 marketing and technical capacity \nimproved,  and  (iv)  Mongolian  product  brand(s)  developed.  To  ensure  relevance  and \nsustainability, capacity development will be conducted in cooperation with technical agencies, \nuniversities, and business associations in Mongolia. \n \n12.  Output 1: Value chain investments financed. Output 1 comprises (i) preparation of \nthe VCI proposals; (ii) due diligence of the VCI subprojects; (iii) provision of subloans to the \nPPEs19 to improve their value chains and/or enhance their production and productivity; and (iv) \ncapacity  development  of  the  PPEs  and  project  participating  banks  (PPBs)  on  financial \nmanagement,  value  chain  development,  and  social  and  environmental  safeguards.  The \nconsolidated PMU will assist the PPEs in preparing the VCI proposals for subloan application, \nparticularly  in  identifying  areas  for  business  improvement  such  as  marketing,  product \ndevelopment, and quality control. The identified needs will be reflected in the VCI proposals and \nused to tailor activities under outputs 2 and 3. The VCI financing is described in para. 18. \n \n13.  Output  2:  Production  capacity  of  herders  and  farmers  improved.  Output  2 \ncomprises (i) capacity development for herders, farmers, and primary processors of agricultural \nproducts; (ii) provision of veterinary medical supplies, equipment, machinery, material, and \ninputs  for  herders,  farmers,  and  primary  processors  of  agricultural  products;  and  (iii) \nconstruction of a livestock primary processing facility. The project will help herders, farmers, and \nprimary  processors,  including  potential  suppliers  of  raw  materials  and  primary  processed \nproducts to the PPEs, to improve their production capacity and quality control. \n \n14.  Output  3:  Enterprises\u2019  marketing  and  technical  capacity  improved.  Output  3 \ncomprises (i) marketing and technical capacity development to enable the PPEs to produce and \ndeliver  high-value  and/or  quality  products  to  domestic  and  international  markets;  and  (ii) \nprovision of equipment and capacity development to technical and research institutes dealing \nwith food and agriculture products. This output is based on an observation from the current \nproject\u2014that  a  substantial  gap  exists  between  the  capacity  of  the  PPEs  and  the  quality \nstandards that international markets require. In tandem with financial support to the PPEs \n(output 1), strengthening enterprises\u2019 marketing and technical capacity is crucial to realizing \nhigher value addition. The capacity development training will be given not only to the PPEs, but \nalso to other agro-enterprises of interest for a wider impact. The training will help strengthen the \n                                                \n19 PPEs under the current project comprise public limited or limited liability companies. Under the additional financing, \nPPEs will also include cooperatives registered under the Law on Cooperatives. \n ", "5 \nquality-testing capacity of technical institutes, which will help improve and assure the quality of \nMongolian products in the medium term. \n \n15.  Output  4:  Mongolian  product  brand(s)  developed. Output 4 comprises (i) brand \ndevelopment for export-oriented products (e.g., animal fiber and its processed products); and (ii) \npromotion and management of brand(s) developed and/or to be developed. Regarding brand \nmanagement, the project will continue to help the government register the Mongolian Noble \nFiber certification mark with national intellectual property offices of selected countries that are \ncurrent and potential buyers of the Mongolian animal fiber products. Regarding brand promotion \nand management, the project will assist Mongolian agro-enterprises in getting their products \ntested and certified for the certification mark. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n16.  The  additional  financing  is  estimated  to  cost  $61.0  million  (Table  1).

Price contingencies computed for all expenditure categories except value chain investments at \n1.5% for 2016, 1.4% for 2017, and 1.5% for the years 2018\u20132020 on foreign exchange costs; and 9.0% for 2016, \n8.5% for 2017, and 8.0% for the years 2018\u20132020 on local currency costs; includes provision for potential \nexchange rate fluctuation under the assumption of a purchasing power parity exchange rate. \ng  Includes interest and commitment charges. Interests during construction have been computed for (i) ADB\u2019s Asian \nDevelopment Fund loan at 2.0% per annum during the implementation period, and (ii) ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources loan at the 5-year US dollar fixed swap rate plus an effective contractual spread of 0.5% and maturity \npremium of 0.1%. Commitment charges for an ordinary capital resources loan are 0.15% per year to be charged on \nthe undisbursed loan amount. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "6 \n17.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $35  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources (OCR) to help finance the project. The OCR loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, following the straight-line method, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year (the interest and other charges during construction to be \ncapitalized  in  the  loan),  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan \nagreement.20 The average maturity is 15.25 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is \n0.1% per annum. The government has also requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSDR10.719 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (ADF) to help finance the project. The \nADF loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2% \nper annum during the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan agreement.21 \n \n18.  Financing for value chain investment subloans. For output 1 (item i), the government \nwill relend an estimated $41.25 million from the loan proceeds to the PPBs under onlending \nagreements to be entered into between the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the PPBs on terms \nand conditions satisfactory to ADB. The government\u2019s relending to the PPBs will carry interest \nthat reflects the cost of funds plus a minimum spread to cover transaction costs and risks such \nas the foreign exchange risks. The PPBs will then provide subloans to the PPEs under subloan \nagreements to be entered into between the PPBs and the PPEs on terms and conditions \nsatisfactory to ADB and the government. The subloans to the PPEs (VCI subloans) will carry \ninterest that reflects at least the cost of funds plus a minimum spread to cover transaction costs \nand risks, but not less than the interest rate under which ADB provides loans from its OCR.22 \nEach VCI subloan will  be in an amount between $0.15 million and $3.0 million. The VCI \nsubloans will be selected based on the selection criteria and through the selection process in \nthe PAM. No subloan will finance any activities in ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list as \nset forth in Appendix 5 of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS, 2009). Loan guarantees will \nbe provided from ADB loans or existing guarantee schemes outside the project mainly to help \nSMEs and cooperatives with limited financial capacity overcome lack of collaterals.23 Loan \nproceeds for VCI subloans repaid by the initial batch of PPEs as well as the current grant \nproceeds repaid by 12 PPEs will be further revolved for wider impacts on agriculture value chain \ndevelopment.24 The financing plan is in Table 2. \n   \n                                                \n20 Loan Agreement: Ordinary Capital Resources (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Loan Agreement: Asian Development Fund (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Relending terms for financial intermediaries and onlending terms for final borrowers will be decided in reference to \nthose offered for similar financial intermediation loans of other development partners in Mongolia. \n23 The PPEs may also avail of guarantees from an ADB loan for Mongolia\u2019s Supporting the Credit Guarantee System \nfor Economic Diversification and Employment Project, the processing of which will start shortly. \n24 The Japan International Cooperation Agency has demonstrated success in revolving financial intermediary loans \nthrough Mongolian commercial banks. \n ", "7 \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nCurrenta Additional Financing Total\nAmount Share of  Amount Share of  Amount Share of \nSource ($ million) Total (%) ($ million) Total (%) ($ million) Total (%)\nADB ADF Grant 14.72 31.0 0.00 0.0 14.72 13.6\nADB ADF Loan 0.00 0.0 15.00 24.6 15.00 13.8\nADB OCR Loan 0.00 0.0 35.00 57.4 35.00 32.3\nGovernment 1.41 3.0 1.00 1.6 2.41 2.2\nPPBs 11.00 23.2 0.00 0.0 11.00 10.1\nPPEs 20.37 42.9 10.00 16.4 30.37 28.0\nTotal 47.50 100.0 61.00 100.0 108.50 100.0\n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, OCR = ordinary capital resources, PPB = project \nparticipating bank, PPE = project participating enterprise. \nNote: Percentages may not total 100% because of rounding. \na  Refers to the original amount. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  MOF will continue to be the executing agency. The Ministry of Food and Agriculture \n(MOFA) and Ministry of Industry (MOI) will be the implementing agencies. The project steering \ncommittee will continue to oversee project implementation. It will comprise representatives from \nMOF,  which  chairs  the  committee;  MOFA;  MOI;  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  Green \nDevelopment and Tourism; and the Bank of Mongolia. The project director of the PMU will \ncontinue to be the secretary of the project steering committee and also be responsible for \noverall project management. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and \ndescribed in detail in the PAM (footnote 14). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2016\u2013December 2020 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2020 and 30 June 2021 \nand loan closing date \nManagement   \n(i)   Oversight body  Project steering committee \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Finance \n(iii) Implementing agencies  Ministry of Food and Agriculture and Ministry of Industry \nProcurement  National competitive bidding  18 contracts  $2,797,878 \nShopping  3 contracts  $72,920 \nConsulting services  Individual consultant selection  382 person-monthsa  $843,000 \nDisbursement  The Asian Development Fund and ordinary capital resources loan proceeds will be \ndisbursed in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2015, as amended from time to time), and the detailed arrangements \nagreed upon between the government and the Asian Development Bank. \na  Contracts of six of the seven consultants engaged under the current project will be extended while an additional \nconsultant will be recruited for the additional financing. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.33 million, of which $2.00 million will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of office accommodation and other in-kind contributions. MOFA will be the \nexecuting  agency  for  output  2  and  MOI  for  outputs  3  and  4.  The  TA  is  expected  to  be \nimplemented from April 2016 to March 2019. The TA will finance consulting services to improve \n ", "8 \nthe capacity of primary producers and processors, improve the marketing and technical capacity \nof agro-enterprises and cooperatives, and develop the Mongolian product brand(s). The TA will \nbe an integral part of the project since the additional financing needs to cover more and diverse \nsubsectors and business types and, expectedly, smaller agro-enterprises and cooperatives that \nhave limited capacity.25  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  The project design was modified to include output 3 to reduce the gaps between PPEs\u2019 \ntechnical capacity and the quality standards that markets demand, which were observed under \nthe current project. The PMU will be equipped with agribusiness, marketing, and sector experts \nto assist selected PPEs in designing their VCI proposals according to the requirements of target \nmarkets and in overcoming technical deficiencies through the implementation of the VCIs. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  The  economic  and financial  analyses  examined  model  VCI  subprojects from  seven \nsubsectors and an animal skin primary processing subproject (footnote 15). As enterprises and \nfarms will be selected during implementation, necessary information was collected from relevant \nenterprises and farms. The analysis confirmed the financial and economic viability of all the \nsubprojects.26 The sensitivity analysis confirmed that they are, by and large, robust against \ndifferent adverse scenarios. During project implementation, the PPBs will conduct financial due \ndiligence for each subproject. The PMU will continue its own financial due diligence for cross-\nchecking and conduct economic due diligence on selected subprojects.27 The financial due \ndiligence reports of the four PPBs prepared for the current project were updated.28 Those \nreports confirmed that all the PPBs are qualified to continue to participate in the project.29 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n23.  A financial management assessment of MOF and procurement capacity assessments of \nMOFA and MOI confirmed that all three ministries, with the support of the PMU, have adequate \ncapacity for financial management and procurement under the project. The PMU members for \nthe  current  project,  who  are  familiar  with  the  government\u2019s  and  ADB  requirements  on \ndisbursement, procurement, and social and environmental safeguards, will continue project \nimplementation. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained and \ndiscussed with the government and the executing and implementing agencies. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 14). \n \n                                                \n25 While the TA will finance consultants, training for capacity development for agro-enterprises, primary producers, \nand processors under outputs 2 and 3 will be separately financed by the ADF loan due to TA budget constraints. \n26 Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27  As the number of subprojects will be large, economic analysis will focus on the examination of economic viability \nthrough a cost\u2013benefit analysis and on selected subprojects in each subsector and business type. \n28 Khan, Xac, Trade and Development, and Golomt banks, PPBs under the current project, will continue to serve for \nthe project since they (i) substantially meet the Bank of Mongolia\u2019s prudential requirements and (ii) have adequate \nstaff for financial management of the project. \n29 Due  Diligence  Reports  of  Project  Participating  Banks  (not  available  to  the  public  as  per  ADB\u2019s  Public \nCommunications Policy 2011). Other banks and nonbank financial institutions may be considered for participation \nin the project if they pass the financial due diligence. \n ", "9 \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n24.  The overall project (under output 1) will generate 1,800 new jobs, 40% of which will be \nfor women, at the PPEs and their respective supply chains. The project will also have an indirect \nimpact on employment generation by primary product producers and processors in rural areas \nbecause  demand  will  increase  as  the  processing  capacity  increases.  Poor  and  socially \nmarginalized households will potentially benefit from these job opportunities, particularly at the \nPPEs. The overall project will also assist 120 agricultural cooperatives under output 2. Outputs \n2 and 3 will include programs to build primary producers\u2019 capacity and provide training to PPEs\u2019 \nemployees to ensure production efficiency, product quality, and safety. The project is classified \nas effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan was prepared. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n25.  Environment. The project continues to be classified as category B. The current project \nconfirmed mainly positive environmental benefits. For the additional financing, an environmental \nassessment and review framework30 was prepared in compliance with Mongolia\u2019s environmental \nregulations and SPS to guide the executing agency and the PPBs in the preparation of the \nenvironmental assessments of subprojects. The screening procedures in the environmental \nassessment and review framework, which were established under the current project, and \ncomplemented with a brief climate risk assessment, will be applied to screen every subproject \nand exclude all category A subprojects. Based on the proposed activities, no significant adverse \nenvironmental impacts are expected, and climate risk is considered low.31 The impacts will be \nmitigated through the implementation and monitoring of the environmental management plans. \n \n26.  Involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  continues  to  be \nclassified  as  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  Screening \nprocedures for those social safeguards established under the current project will be applied \nunder the  additional financing.  For  involuntary  resettlement,  the  PMU  will  also  assess the \nsocioeconomic  impacts  of  each  subproject  and  take  measures  to  avoid  displacement. \nConstruction activities will take place on enterprise-owned land. Additional land, if needed by \nthe PPEs, will be acquired commercially under willing buyer\u2013willing seller agreements. Land \nacquisition  that  would  cause  involuntary  economic  and  physical  displacement  will  not  be \npermitted. For indigenous peoples, the project is expected to have only positive impacts, if any, \nas  subprojects  will  provide  capacity  development  and  agricultural  machinery,  equipment, \nmaterials, and inputs for project beneficiaries; and provide job opportunities at the PPEs. Given \nthe uncertainty, an ethnic minorities planning framework was prepared.32 If indigenous peoples \ngroups, as defined by SPS, Safeguard Requirement 3, be identified as project beneficiaries or \nimpacted, an ethnic minorities development plan will be prepared for the subproject. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.33 The overall risk rating of the project is \nmoderate. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n                                                \n30 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Most project activities are indoors, except sea buckthorn plantation and bee farming, which are not particularly \nsensitive to climate change impacts. \n32 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework: Ethnic Minority Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n33 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nFluctuations  in  international  market  prices  The  project  will  provide  the  project  participating \nand  the  foreign  exchange  rate  adversely  enterprises  with  advisory  services  and  training  on \naffect  the  sales  and  exports  of  project  marketing so that they can mitigate the impact from such \nparticipating enterprises.  fluctuations on their businesses. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n28.  The government, MOF, MOFA, and MOI have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM (footnote 14) and loan documents.  \n \n29.
