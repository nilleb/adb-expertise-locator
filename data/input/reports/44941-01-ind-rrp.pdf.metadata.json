The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nIdentification and Selection \n\n2. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) supports the Ministry of New \nand Renewable Energy (MNRE) in the formulation and implementation of India\u2019s National Solar \nMission (NSM), announced by the Government of India in January 2010. 1 The NSM intends to \ncommission 20,000 megawatts (MW) in grid-connected solar power generation by 2022 to help \nfill persistent energy shortages with diversified low-carbon power generation, secure its energy \nindependence  using  indigenous  resources,  and  become  a  manufacturing  hub  for  the  solar \nenergy industry in Asia.  \n \n3. \nDuring TA implementation, ADB staff engaged the MNRE in various discussions on how \nto  encourage  private  sector  investment  in  and  financing  of  solar  projects  under  the  NSM \nprogram.  This  included specific  assistance  on  drafting  a  bankable  power  purchase  agreement \n(and a subsequent power sales agreement with the states), transparent eligibility guidelines and \nselection criteria, and an enhanced regulatory framework for green energy. All parties stressed \nthe importance of long-term financing and the impact of its cost on the levelized cost2 of solar \nelectricity. Given the high up-front but low operating cost profile of solar power generation, the \nprofile, tenor, and cost of debt play a significant part in optimizing costs and viability; and have \nbeen the main focus of ADB\u2019s efforts in this area. \n \nAs  the  MNRE  defined  the  details  of  the  NSM  program,  it  became  clear  to  the  project \n4. \nteam  that  the  first  phase  projects  would  be  relatively  small  (2  MW\u201325  MW),  mostly  solar \nphotovoltaic  projects.  Based  on  current  cost  estimates  (about  $3,000\u2013$3,300  per  kilowatt  of \ninstalled  capacity),  the  total  costs  of  such  projects  are  likely  to  be  too  small  for  direct  ADB \nlending.  The  challenge  thus  became  how  to  support  the  financing  of  multiple  \u201csmall\u201d  solar \nprojects  that  would  demonstrate  their  viability  in  the  context  of  India\u2019s  operating  and  climatic \nenvironment.  ADB  discussed  various  financing  structures  and  support  mechanisms  with  local \nand foreign commercial banks. Based on the feedback received from these banks, there is an \nimmediate  window  of  opportunity  for  ADB  to  make  a  real  impact  in  this  nascent  but  critically \nimportant  sector,  by  mobilizing  available  commercial  funds  into  solar  projects  and  building \ncapacity  within  the  local  banks  on  the  technical  and  commercial  risks  of  solar  power  projects. \nThis  iterative  consultation  process  led  to  the  design  of  a  multi-project  partial  credit  guarantee \n(PCG)  facility  structured  to  provide  long-term  financing  and  share  commercial  risks  between \nbanks and ADB for the first wave of solar projects. Commercial risk mitigation and extension of \ndebt tenors are critical to ensure the bankability and viability of, and to lay the groundwork for, a \nsustainable solar program. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to India for Integrated Renewable Energy Development. Manila (TA 7099-IND). \n\nThis ongoing TA will fulfill ADB\u2019s participation requirement for nonsovereign guarantee operations. \n\n2  Levelized cost refers to the present value of the total cost of constructing and operating a generating plant over its \n\neconomic life converted on an annual basis. \n\n\f2  \n \n\n \n\nB. \n\nSector Background \n\n5. \nAs  of  October  2010,  installed  power  generation  capacity  in  India  was  167,278  MW, \n64.9%  of  which  is  fired  from  thermal  sources  (coal  and  gas),  22.3%  from  hydropower,  2.7% \nfrom  nuclear  power,  and  10.0%  from  renewable  energy.  India\u2019s  growth  rates  in  energy \nconsumption  are  much  higher  than  the  gross  domestic  product  growth  rate,  reflecting  an \nincreasing  share  of  energy  investment.  India\u2019s  energy  sector  contributes  about  58%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.3 \n \n6. \nSolar  energy  is  abundant  in  India,  with  high  insolation  measured  at  about  300  sunny \ndays  on  average  per  year4 and  estimated  to  be  5  billion  megawatt-hours  (MWh)  per  year  of \nenergy over India\u2019s land area. Most regions receive 4\u20137 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per square meter \n(m2)  per  day;  the  national  average  is  4.5  kWh/m2/day.  This  rate  of  insolation  is  among  the \nhighest  in  the  world,  comparing  favorably  with  Australia  (4.7  kWh/m2/day)  and  ahead  of  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (3.4 kWh/m2/day) and Western Europe (2.9 kWh/m2/day).5 Effective \nunlocking  of  this  huge  potential,  through  photovoltaic  or  concentrating  solar  thermal  power \ndevelopment,  provides  the  ability  to  generate  power  on  a  distributed  basis  and  enables  rapid \ncapacity addition with relatively short lead times (e.g., less than 1 year). \n \n7. \nFrom an energy independence and security perspective, solar is the most secure of all \nsources  since  it  is  renewable  and  abundantly  available.  Given  the  large  number  of  poor  and \nunserved  people  in  India,  all  efforts  need  to  be  made  to  exploit  this  source  of  energy.  Solar \nprojects can be flexibly sited within high insolation areas to avoid competing for scarce land that \nmay  have  other  productive  uses.  The  acquisition  of  land  has  become  a  major  hurdle  for \ninfrastructure  development  projects  in  India  and  other  developing  member  countries  (DMCs). \nWhile  domestic  coal-based  power  generation  is  the  cheapest  electricity  source  today,  future \nscenarios  suggest  that  this  could  change.  Under  current  electricity  deficit  conditions  and \nlooming domestic coal shortages, peak energy prices could reach Rs8.50 per kWh ($0.18 per \nkWh)  as  the  country  begins  to  partly  rely  on  imported  coal  to  meet  its  energy  demand.  Given \nenergy shortages, India is increasing the use of diesel-based electricity, which is both expensive \n(up to Rs15.00 per kWh) and polluting.  \n \nThe  NSM  is  an  initiative  of  the  central  and  state  governments  to  promote  ecologically \n8. \nsustainable energy growth while addressing India\u2019s energy security challenge. It will constitute a \nmajor  contribution  by  India  to  the  global  effort  to  meet  the  challenges  of  climate  change.  The \nNSM  helps  implement  some  of  India\u2019s  objectives  under  the  National  Action  Plan  on  Climate \nChange, which recognizes that solar energy\u2014because of India\u2019s tropical climate and abundant \nsunshine\u2014has  great  potential  as  a  future  energy  source  and  will  enable  the  decentralized \ndistribution  of  electricity  production.  However,  solar  power  generation  is  the  least  developed \nform of renewable energy in India because of technical and financial challenges (Table 1). \n  \n\n                                                 \n3   Agence France-Presse, 2010.  \n4   Government  of  India,  Ministry  of  Power,  Central  Electricity  Authority.  2010.

One  of  the  objectives  of  the  NSM  is  to  create \nconditions (through a rapid scaling up of capacity, technological innovation, and indigenization) \nthat  will  drive  down  the  capital  costs  of  solar  power  generation  toward  grid  parity.6 The  NSM \naims  to  achieve  grid  parity  (peak  energy)  by  2022  and  parity  with  coal-fired  thermal  power  by \n2030.  As  more  solar  capacity  is  installed  globally,  production  costs  for  panels  and  other \ncomponents  will  decrease  as  a  result  of  economies  of  scale  and  manufacturers  locating \nproduction facilities close to demand in Asia. This cost trajectory will depend on the scale and \npace  of  global  deployment,  technology  development,  and  transfer  of  knowledge.  Once  solar \npower costs approach or reach grid parity, this will facilitate the deployment of smaller and more \ndistributed power generation stations that can serve more remote and nonurban locations where \nIndia\u2019s poor are concentrated. \n \n10. \nThe  objective  of  the  NSM  is  to  establish  India  as  a  global  leader  in  solar  energy  by \ncreating  the  policy  conditions  for  rapid  diffusion  of  technology  and  investment  across  the \ncountry.  The  NSM  will  adopt  a  three-phase  approach,  spanning  the  remaining  period  of  the \nEleventh Five Year Plan, 2007\u201320127 and first year of the 12th plan (1,000-2,000 MW of utility-\nscale capacity by 2013) as phase 1; the remaining 4 years of the 12th plan as phase 2 (4,000\u2013\n10,000 MW added by 2017); and the 13th plan as phase 3 (20,000 MW by 2022). The NSM will \nevaluate  progress  against  plan  milestones  to  review  capacity  and  targets  for  subsequent \nphases based on emerging cost and technology trends, so as to protect the government from \nheavy subsidy exposure in case anticipated cost reductions do not materialize as expected. \n \n11. \nNSM  activities  are  currently  embedded  within  the  existing  framework  of  the  Electricity \nAct,  2003,  but  solar-specific  regulatory  frameworks  and  contractual  arrangements  are  being \nestablished  to  facilitate  its  development.  One  of  the  key  regulatory  drivers  for  promoting  solar \npower is a renewable purchase obligation (RPO) in which a minimum amount of electricity must \nbe  purchased  from  clean  energy  sources  by  power  distribution  companies  (e.g.,  varies  from \n1.0% to 15.0% in Indian states at present). As required by the National Electricity Policy (2005), \nthe National Tariff Policy (2006) was amended by the cabinet in January 2011 to mandate that \nthe state electricity regulators specify a minimum amount of electricity generated by solar power \nthat must be purchased by power distribution companies. The solar power purchase obligation \nfor states will start at 0.25% no later than 2013 and increase up to 3.0% by 2022. \n \n                                                 \n6   Grid  parity  refers  to  the  cost  of  electricity  on  an  Indian  rupee  per  kilowatt  hour  basis,  which  is  equivalent  to  the \n\ncurrent market price for short-term power. \n\n7  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2008. Eleventh Five Year Plan, 2007\u201312. Delhi. \n\n \n\n\f4  \n \n\n \n\nThe  Central  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (CERC)  has  issued  detailed  guidelines \n12. \nfor  determining  feed-in  tariffs  for  solar  power,  taking  into  account  current  cost  and  technology \ntrends. These will be revised on an annual basis for new projects being commissioned (although \npresently fixed until the end of March 2012). This will be complemented by a renewable energy \ncertificate (REC) mechanism to allow utilities and solar power generation companies to buy and \nsell  certificates  to  meet  their  solar  power  purchase  obligations.  In  January  2010,  CERC \nannounced  REC  regulations  that  enable  the  interstate  trading  of  such  certificates  to  meet  the \nRPOs.  This  will  drive  utility-scale  renewable  power  generation,  but  it  is  not  yet  consistently  in \nplace  across  all  states\u2014representing  a  risk  for  solar  project  developers.  The  NSM  offtake \nregime,  with  its  blended  tariff  structure,  is  therefore  critical  in  bridging  the  near-term \ncompetitiveness  of  solar  with  other  renewable  technologies.  Short-term  adoption  is  critical  in \nachieving cost economies of scale and diffusing the technology in the long term. RPOs\u2019 of 1%\u2013\n15% of total power purchases have been established by 18 states based on renewable potential \nin the state. When NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam (NVVN) supplies bundled power to state utilities \nat the rates determined in accordance with CERC regulations, those state utilities will be entitled \nto  use  the  solar  part  of  the  bundled  power  for  meeting  their  RPOs  under  the  Electricity  Act, \n2003.  Further  information  on  India\u2019s  National  Solar  Mission,  power  purchase  schemes,  and \nregulatory framework are in Appendix 2. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 \n\nThe  facility  is  consistent  with  Strategy  2020, 8  which  emphasizes  ADB  support  for \n13. \nenvironmentally  sustainable  development  and  private  sector  development.  The  facility  will \nexpand  ADB\u2019s  promotion  of,  and  investment  in,  sound  environmental  management  while \ncapitalizing  on  its  operational  strength,  such  as  infrastructure  development  and  finance.  The \nstrategy  seeks  to  meet  the  region\u2019s  growing  energy  demand  by  helping  DMCs  to  develop \nenvironmentally  friendly  technologies,  specifically  promoting  energy  efficiency  and  the  use  of \nclean  energy  sources.  One  of  the  key  actions  is  to  mitigate  climate  change  by  moving  DMCs \nonto low-carbon growth paths by (i) improving energy efficiency, (ii) expanding the use of clean \nenergy  sources,  (iii)  reducing  fugitive  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  (iv)  modernizing  public \ntransport  systems,  and  (v)  arresting  deforestation.  In  addition,  one  of  Strategy  2020\u2019s  goals is \nthat  ADB\u2019s  cofinanced  lending  will  increase  at  a  faster  rate  than  ADB\u2019s  stand-alone  financing \noperations, with a long-term objective of total annual direct cofinancing exceeding the value of \nADB\u2019s stand-alone financing. The facility would be consistent with this cofinancing goal. \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with the Country Strategy   \n\n14. \nApproved  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  in  June  2009,  the  India  country  partnership \nstrategy,  2009\u20132012  emphasizes  continued  and  sustained  infrastructure  development  (e.g., \ntransport,  energy,  urban  and  water  resource  management).9 ADB\u2019s  energy  program  in  India \naims  to  enhance  the  impact  of  the  government\u2019s  initiatives  for  demand-  and  supply-related \nprograms.  The  planned  activities  include  (i)  developing  renewable  and  alternative  energy \nsources,  and  clean  generation  technology;  (ii)  reducing  technical  and  commercial  losses  in \ntransmission  and  distribution  networks  and \ninterregional \ntransmission capacity; (iv) bringing demand-side management and energy conservation into the \n\n(iii)  strengthening \n\nfacilities; \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB.  2008.  Strategy  2020:  The  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  2008\u20132020. \n\nManila. \n\n9   ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009\u20132012. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nmainstream;  and  (v) promoting  private  sector  participation,  while  ensuring  environmental \nsustainability,  and  supporting  institutional  strengthening  to  implement  the  reforms  required  by \nthe  Electricity  Act,  2003.  Key  thematic  concerns  include  environmental  sustainability,  private \nsector development, private sector operations, governance, and partnerships.  \n \n15. \nThe  facility  complements  the  current  lending  and  TA  program  by  ADB\u2019s  South  Asia \nDepartment  in  support  of  solar  power  projects  in  India.  There  has  been  close  cooperation \nbetween  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  and  South  Asia  Department  on  the  TA \nprogram  with  the  MNRE.  In  addition,  ADB  is  preparing  a  $100  million  loan  in  support  of  a \n500 MW  solar  park  being  developed  in  the  state  of  Gujarat.  Additional  TA  is  proposed  for  a \nsimilar  solar  park  in  the  state  of  Rajasthan  for  developing  solar  engineering  centers  of \nexcellence in local universities, funding of \u201csmart grid\u201d transmission management systems, and \nvocational educational programs in support of the solar industry in India.  \n \n\n3. \n\nConsistency with the Sector Strategy \n\nUnder  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy,  ADB\u2019s  investments  will  focus  on  energy  efficiency  and \n16. \nrenewable energy projects, as well as the expansion of energy access. Starting in 2013, ADB \nwill increase its target of clean energy investments to $2 billion a year from $1 billion, in a bid to \naccelerate low-carbon growth and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the region. 10  As part of \nthe policy implementation, ADB is emphasizing private sector participation as a tool to enhance \nenergy  sector  efficiency  as  a  result  of  introducing  increased  competition  and  increased \ninvestable resources. The objective is to create a framework that makes investing in the energy \nsector a commercially viable proposition and ADB is committed to facilitate direct private sector \nparticipation. \n \n17. \nThe  facility  is  also  directly  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Asia  Solar  Energy  Initiative  (ASEI)  to \n(i) facilitate  knowledge  sharing  and  transfer  for  solar  power;  (ii)  help  develop,  finance,  and \ncommission 3,000 MW of solar power generation capacity in DMCs by May 2013; and (iii) pilot \ntest innovative financing mechanisms and risk mitigation measures specifically for solar power. \nThe  ASEI  seeks  to  stimulate  solar power  development  in DMCs  with  the  goal  of (i) increasing \neconomies of scale to reduce costs and improve solar energy\u2019s competitiveness within the grid; \n(ii)  exploiting  select  DMCs\u2019  solar  radiation  resources  to  service  their  fast-growing  electricity \ndemand  and  utilize  their  greater  availability  of  land  compared  with  most  developed  countries; \nand (iii) promoting DMCs\u2019 potential to become global and regional manufacturing hubs for solar \ntechnology  goods  and  equipment.  ADB\u2019s  solar  initiatives  in  India  have  been  extensively \ncoordinated with the energy community of practice. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE FACILITY \n\nA. \n\nFacility Description \n\n1. \n\nFacility Rationale and Design \n\nCommercial banks in India typically lend against fixed asset collateral or, if insufficient, \n18. \nagainst  corporate  guarantees  as  opposed  to  the  cash  flow  and  debt  service  capacity  of  the \nproject  (i.e.,  project  financing).  Banks  rely  heavily  on  relationships  with  existing  borrowers  to \ngrow their lending business. This practice makes it difficult for new companies or borrowers to \nobtain financing on reasonable terms or without high collateralization. With solar projects being \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f6  \n \n\n \n\nrelatively small and having some technical risks that cannot be easily mitigated at the present \ntime,  banks  remain  wary  of  lending  to  solar  projects  and/or  lending  beyond  their  existing \ncorporate relationships.   \n \nThe  facility  will  help  close  these  gaps  by  sharing  credit  risks  with  commercial  lenders. \n19. \nSupported by parallel capacity development TA (para. 37), the facility has the twin objective of \n(i) making  limited  recourse  debt  financing  available  on  reasonable  terms  and  conditions,  and \n(ii) extending the tenor of loans to solar projects to recoup the current high capital costs. ADB \nwould issue PCGs to international and local lenders to cover up to 50%11 of any nonpayment by \nthe  borrowers.  The  PCGs  would  cover  any  default  of  scheduled  repayments  of  principal  and \naccrued  interest.  This  is  not  a  \u201cfirst  loss\u201d  guarantee,  which  would  be  paid  prior  to  any  loss \nsharing by the commercial banks; banks will incur losses alongside any ADB claims paid. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Borrowers and Sponsors \n\n20. \nThe projects to be supported under the facility are likely to be financed through special \npurpose vehicle companies (SPVs), established by project sponsors to build, own, and operate \nthe  assets  as  a  stand-alone  independent  power  producer  incorporated  in  India.  Based  on  the \nindicative  pipeline  of  projects  (Appendix  3),  the  SPVs  are  sponsored  by  a  mix  of  local  and \nforeign  investors  with  either  experience  as  power  sector  operators  in  India  or  joint  venture \nconsortia of financial investors and companies with solar power experience outside of India. The \nfacility  will  only  be  eligible  for  lenders  to  those  SPVs  in  which  50%  or  more  of  the  shares  are \nowned by private sector companies and sponsored by investors with acceptable experience and \ncredit quality.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOutcome and Outputs \n\n21. \nThe  outcome  will  be  the  demonstration  of  profitable  and  sustainable  solar  power \ngeneration  plants  under  the  National  Solar  Mission  and/or  state  solar  power  policies.  These \nprojects  will  diversify  the  country\u2019s  energy  mix,  increase  energy  security,  reduce  reliance  on \nfossil  fuels,  lower  imports  and  exposure  to  international  energy  prices  and  exchange  rate \nfluctuations,  and  decrease  the  emission  of  greenhouse  gases  as  well  as  local  pollutants.  The \namount of carbon dioxide emissions reduced is one of the indicators for the outcome, in addition \nto financial and operation indicators.  \n \n22. \nThe  facility  will  support  the  development  of  utility-scale,  grid-connected  solar  power \nprojects  in  India  through  long-term  commercial  financing.  The  facility  will  mobilize  lending  and \ndevelop the capacity of commercial and partner banks to undertake technical due diligence on \nsolar  projects  and  provide  affordable  longer-tenor  loans,  which  are  critical  to  their  viability, \nsustainability, and replicability. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB. \n\n \nDevelopment Impact \n\n23. \nSolar  power  is  most  appropriate  for  off-grid  and  distributed  electricity  generation \nbecause  of  its  modular  scalability  to  meet  small  loads,  ease  of  installation,  and  minimal \n\n                                                 \n11 Sharing  of  the  risks  between  ADB  and  the  commercial  bank  ensures  an  equitable  balance  and  prevents  against \nmoral  hazard.  This  level  of  risk  sharing  is  calculated  on  a  present  value  basis  over  the  life  of  the  loan,  which \nprovides flexibility for guarantees to be structured in different ways (either a constant guarantee scheme or a back-\nended scheme in which coverage is higher in the latter years of the loan) depending on the banks\u2019 preference. The \nnet  present  value  of  the  guaranteed  outstanding  principal  and  accrued  interest  shall  not  exceed  50%  of  the  total \nprincipal of the guaranteed loan. \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\noperating  and  maintenance  costs.  As  the  cost  of  solar  power  equipment  drops  as  a  result  of \neconomies of scale from indigenous production and development of local capacity, solar energy \nwill become more affordable, reliable, and accessible in the remote and underdeveloped areas \nof  India.  In  essence,  demand  from  utility-scale  grid-connected  solar  projects  in  the  first  phase \nwill  lead  to  long-term  cost  reductions  for  solar  power  across  India,  including  for  off-grid \nconsumers who are often bypassed in terms of sharing the benefits of development.  \n \n24. \nSignificant  capacity  beyond  a  pilot  scale  needs  to  be  developed  and  operated  on  a \ncommercial  basis  in  the  DMCs  for  solar  power  technology  to  scale  up.  It  is  expected  that  the \nfacility will directly leverage private sector investment for about 130 MW of projects, which would \nresult  in  205  gigawatt-hours  of  electricity  from  solar  energy  added  to  the  grid  in  India  and \n1.76 million  tons  of  carbon  dioxide\u00a0 abated  during  the  first  10  years  of  operations.  The  facility \nimproves  the  financial  viability  of  solar  projects  by  extending  the  tenor  of  the  loans  without  a \ncommensurate  increase  in  lending  margins.  This  will  alleviate  some  pressure  on  project  cash \nflows to service debt and as a result, improves the returns on the private sector investor\u2019s equity \nto an acceptable level. This effect will generate more investment in this nascent sector. Higher \nreturns on equity on the first projects would, in turn, allow electricity regulators to lower the feed-\nin tariff levels required in the future. \n \n25. \nIn the medium term, commercial banks that finance projects alongside ADB will become \nmore comfortable with solar power and have direct access to performance and operational data \nto  understand  the  risks  better.  This  will  transform  market  risk  perceptions  and  induce  other \nbanks  to  lend  to  the  sector  without  ADB  support  or  (limited)  recourse  to  the  sponsor.  This \nhypothesis  can  be  compared  with  the  evolution  of  the  wind  power  sector  in  India  since  2000. \nBanks initially had similar concerns on wind power resources and the unproven performance of \nwind energy turbines in India. Now with over 14,000 MW of wind power installed in India, local \ncommercial banks are more comfortable with the risks, understand technical parameters better, \nand offer long-term debt financing without recourse to parent companies. The same results can \nbe expected (e.g., longer tenors, lower margins) once there is a track record of solar operations. \nThe target of 4,000 MW of solar power in the second phase of the NSM (2013\u20132015) cannot be \nmet without similar developments in the project finance market. Performance indicators for the \nmedium-term  impacts  include  the  cumulative  solar  capacity  in  the  country  by  2015,  the \npercentage of solar projects financed on a non-recourse basis, and the project margins charged \nas compared with other renewable energy projects.   \n \n26. \nIn  line  with  the  ASEI,  one  of  the  long-term  objectives  is  to  reduce  the  capital  costs  for \nsolar power in DMCs. This can be accomplished in India once the manufacturing of solar power \ncomponents is indigenized and reaches economies of scale. Significant demand from projects \nfor capital equipment, solar panels and modules, and experienced contractors is a prerequisite \nto generate investment in local manufacturing. Based on a much lower cost of labor but strong \nengineering and technology base, there is significant scope for manufacturing cost reductions in \nIndia.  Local  manufacturing  will  reduce  the  price  of  solar  components  and  increase  the \ncompetitiveness  of  solar  power  with  other  sources  of  energy  production.  Establishing  a  large \ncommercial  market  in  DMCs  will  stimulate  global  competition  in  the  sector,  further  lowering \nprices and the cost of electricity production.  \n \nC. \n\nEnvironment and Social Dimensions \n\n \n\nThe facility is classified under category FI for environment, involuntary resettlement, and \n27. \nindigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The partner banks will be \nrequired  to  establish  and  adopt  an  appropriate  environmental  and  social  management  system \n\n \n\n\f8  \n \n\n \n\n(ESMS).  Implementation  of  the  ESMS  will  ensure  that  the  projects  meet  ADB\u2019s  safeguard \nrequirements  on  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  partner \nbanks will appoint suitably qualified officers to oversee environmental and social aspects of the \noperations and the day-to-day implementation of the ESMS.  \n \n28. \nFor  this  type,  size,  and  nature  of  project,  no  significant  environmental  impacts  are \nexpected. The solar power developers are required to implement mitigating measures and good \nconstruction  management  practice.  The  occupational  health  and  safety  performance  of  the \ncontractors and their workers will be closely monitored during construction. ADB will coordinate \nwith the partner banks to ensure that an ESMS satisfactory to ADB has been adopted prior to \nADB issuing a guarantee for the first project. \n\n \n29.  Most  solar  projects  are  being  sited  on  barren  or  unproductive  government  land  in  a \ncoordinated  effort  by  state  governments.  Each  5  MW  solar  power  plant  will  require  about \n12 hectares of land. No physical displacement is expected since lands can be flexibly acquired \nto  avoid  impacts  on  existing  villages  and  communities.  The  solar  power  plants  will  typically \nutilize  the  existing  distribution  substations  and  will  be  connected  to  the  state  electricity  grid.  If \nextensions  of  transmission  lines  are  required,  these  are  expected  to  be  established  along \nexisting  public  road  rights-of-way.  Potential  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  and/or  scheduled \ntribes  will  only  be  ascertained  once  specific  sites  for  each  solar  power  plant  are  identified. \nHowever, since barren and unproductive lands will be used, the impacts on scheduled tribes, if \nany, are unlikely to be significant. \n \n30. \nOther social dimensions (e.g., gender, labor issues) of each solar power project will be \nanalyzed as part of the environmental and social assessment to be undertaken by each SPV in \naccordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement and the ESMS of partner banks. The summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 4 and a summary ESMS is in Appendix 5. \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n31.  With over 700 MW awarded to project sponsors in December 2010 through the National \nSolar  Mission  and  an  additional  965  MW  allocated  by  the  state  government  of  Gujarat \n(Appendix  3),  total  investment  costs  over  the  next  3  years  in  the  sector  are  about  $4.5  billion \nequivalent. Assuming a debt\u2013equity ratio of 70:30 as prescribed by the CERC tariff guidelines, \n$3.2  billion  equivalent  of  debt  financing  will  be  required.  Even  if  only  half  those  projects \nmaterialize  ($1.6  billion  in  debt),  significant  demand  for  financing  from  ADB  and  the  facility  is \nlikely.  The  facility  has  been  conservatively  sized  at  $150  million  to  support  12\u201315  projects \nbetween  2011  and  2014,  which  would  represent  a  reasonable  sample  of  first  projects  to  be \nfinanced.  Should  there  be  additional  demand  for  guarantees  prior  to  the  end  of  the  3-year \navailability period, ADB can propose extending the facility through additional financing. \n \n32. \nThe  estimated  investment  cost  for  projects  to  be  supported  under  the  facility  is \n$429 million equivalent and assumes (i) a project debt\u2013equity ratio of no greater than 70:30; and \n(ii)  a  guaranteed  percentage  of  50%  on  the  total  debt  of  the  projects.  ADB  PCGs  would, \ntherefore, cover up to $300 million equivalent of commercial loans to projects from domestic and \ninternational  commercial  bank  lenders.  The  remainder  of  funding  will  come  from  equity  and \nsubordinated debt (or like instruments). \n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n33. \nThe facility can issue PCGs over a 3-year period following Board approval. PCGs will be \nlimited to a maximum tenor of 15 years (18 years may be considered only in exceptional cases, \nas  determined  by  ADB  in  its  sole  discretion).  Additional  sub-facility  limits  on  partner  banks, \nsponsors, and projects are specified below. Any exceptions or changes to these implementation \narrangements will require the prior approval of the Investment Committee.  \n \n\n1. \n\nSelection and Approval of Partner Commercial Banks \n\n34.  \nLocal and/or foreign partner banks will be selected at ADB\u2019s sole discretion. Initially, no \nmore than five partner banks will be selected. Any additions to the number of proposed partner \nbanks  will  be  submitted to  the  Investment  Committee  for  endorsement  (It  is  proposed  that  the \nboard of directors delegate approval authority for partner banks to the Investment Committee). \nADB  will  require  that  each  prospective  lender  submit  all  documentation  and  information  as \noutlined in the due diligence checklist (Appendix 6). Prospective partner banks will be screened \nand  due  diligence  results  presented  to  the  Investment  Committee  for  approval  based  on  the \nfollowing  factors:  (i)  credit  standing  (at  least  BBB\u2013  equivalent  credit  rating  by  an  international \nrating  agency  or  AA  equivalent  credit  rating  by  a  local  rating  agency);12 (ii)  experience  and \ncapabilities  in  limited  recourse  lending  in  India  and/or  Asia;  (iii)  existing  portfolio  in  the  power \nsector; (iv) willingness and ability to make financial commitments in renewable energy required \nunder the facility; (v) senior management commitment; (vi) staffing, management, and technical \ncapability to implement the facility; and (vii) operating policies, guidelines, and systems in loan \norigination, credit assessment, and loan administration and enforcement. No more than 40% of \nthe entire facility can be consumed by PCGs issued to the same partner bank.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSelection and Approval of Projects \n\nProjects  will  be  identified  and  selected  by  partner  banks  based  on  customary  due \n35. \ndiligence  on  project  preparation,  financial  and  commercial  viability,  adequate  sponsor \ncredentials  and  creditworthiness,  and  overall  project  risk  mitigation.  Projects  will  then  be \nscreened against eligibility criteria (Appendix 7), and banks will need to submit a due diligence \nreport  to  ADB  that  meets  all  the  requirements,  including  the  projects\u2019  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \npolicies on anticorruption, safeguards, integrity, and procurement. Projects must have signed a \nlong-term  power  purchase  agreement  either  with  the  NVVN  (under  the  National  Solar  Mission \nframework) or in compliance with an approved state solar power policy. Individual state policies \nwill  be  reviewed  on  a  case-by-case  basis  before  PCGs  are  issued.13 The  net  present  value  of \nthe outstanding guaranteed principal and accrued guaranteed interest shall not exceed 50% of \nthe total principal of the guaranteed loan. Guarantees with the same sponsor or parent company \nof the SPVs shall be limited to no more than five projects or an aggregate of 30 MW, whichever \nlimit  is  reached  first.  These  limits  will  ensure  a  diversified  portfolio  across  partner  banks, \nsponsors, and projects.  \n \n\n                                                 \n12 International credit ratings to be from Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P), Moody\u2019s, or Fitch Ratings; local credit ratings to be \nfrom CRISIL (an S&P company), Investment Information and Credit Rating Agency (ICRA), or Credit Analysis and \nResearch Limited (CARE). \n\n13 The project team has conducted due diligence on the solar power policy in Gujarat, the regulatory norms, the credit \n\nstanding of the offtaker, and the template form of power purchase agreement.  \n\n \n\n\f10  \n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nReporting and Monitoring \n\n36. \nPartner banks will be required to notify ADB promptly of any loan default. Banks will be \nrequired to continuously monitor the performance of the project loans and submit annual reports \nto  ADB  that  include  information  on  disbursements  and  repayments,  construction  progress, \nproject  operating  performance  (as  against  baseline  conditions),  and  quarterly  and  annual \nfinancial  statements,  the  latter  having  been  audited  in  compliance  with  Indian  national \nstandards.  ADB  will  monitor  the  use  of  the  PCG,  portfolio  quality,  and  compliance  with  ADB \neligibility  requirements.  ADB  will  regularly  monitor  the  credit  quality  of  partner  banks  (through \nexisting credit rating reports), and will conduct a review for any partner banks that are placed on \nnegative  credit  watch  by  major  credit  rating  agencies  or  have  their  credit  rating  downgraded. \nADB will carry out an annual performance review of the facility to assess the average risk rating \nof the portfolio and monitor the performance of the facility against indicators in the design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \n\n4. \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n37. \nADB  is  preparing  separate  parallel  TA  that  will  build  capacity  and  provide  technical \nsupport  to  the  partner  banks  during  the  due  diligence  of  private  sector  solar  power  projects. \nADB  will  engage  international  engineering  consultants  to  provide  expertise  and  hands-on \nsupport to partner banks as they conduct due diligence on individual projects. The consultants \nwill advise the partner banks in the areas of solar technology, insolation and irradiance studies, \nsolar  panel  manufacturers,  and  performance  warranties.  Consultants  will  also  be  engaged  to \nconduct  periodic  training  for  commercial  banks  and  other  stakeholders  in  several  locations \nacross India during the implementation period of the facility. ADB is coordinating the first set of \ntraining sessions with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, part of the US Department of \nEnergy. \n  \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n38. \nThe partner banks will be advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate)  and  Policy  on  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003). \nConsistent with  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  the \nguarantee  and/or  loan  documentation  will  require  the  project  borrowers  to  institute,  maintain, \nand comply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice standards \nfor  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money  laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of \nterrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The  legal \ndocumentation will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these \nundertakings. \n \nF. \n\nProjected Operational and Financial Performance \n\n39.   While  partner  banks  will  be  primarily  responsible  for  carrying  out  due  diligence  on  the \nprojects,  ADB  has  carried  out  financial  and  economic  analysis  of  a  representative  project  to \nassess  its  viability  and  sustainability  under  different  funding  and  operating  scenarios.  These \nresults were used to structure the type and tenor of the guarantee. The financial internal rate of \nreturn of projects under CERC tariffs would be 13.2% and the weighted average cost of capital \nis projected to be 7.8%. The economic internal rate of return would be 20.5%, which is above \nADB\u2019s  standard  discount  rate.  The  economic  and  financial  analysis  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A.  \n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nG. \n\nGuarantee Pricing \n\nThe cost of financing14 is critical to the financial viability of solar power projects (and the \n40. \nunderlying feed-in tariff). Approximately 85% of the total costs (capital and operations) over the \nproject\u2019s economic life are financed up front. This is unlike financing for a thermal power project, \nwhere  only  30%  of  the  total  costs  are  financed  up  front  (the  remainder  are  fuel  and  recurrent \ncosts,  which  are  financed  annually  through  cash  flow  generated  by  operations).  Without  the \nlending  experience  or  installed  capacity  to  prove  performance,  banks  will  assign  high  risk \nratings  to  these  projects  and  commensurate  lending  margins.  The  PCGs  effectively  replace  a \nportion  of  the  project  risk,  as  assessed  by  the  lender,  with  ADB\u2019s  AAA  credit  rating.  This  risk \nmitigation will help reduce loan margins required by the partner commercial banks. The PCGs \ncan incentivize banks to reduce the cost of debt, provided that the PCG fees do not consume \nthe savings created by the guarantee\u2019s risk sharing structure. Guarantee pricing has been set in \nline with market benchmarks, and will vary within a set band based on exposure size and tenor. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n1. \n\nInstrument and Amount \n\n41. \nThe  facility  will  provide  for  ADB  to  issue  PCGs  in  an  aggregate  amount  of  up  to \n$150 million of principal (or its equivalent in Indian rupees or other foreign currency acceptable \nto  ADB15)  in  favor  of  foreign  and  local  commercial  banks  lending  to  solar  power  generation \nprojects in India that meet the minimum eligibility criteria (Appendix 7). Under the facility, ADB \nwill  issue  PCGs  to  guarantee  scheduled  payments  of  principal  and  interest  under  loans  to  be \nprovided by foreign or local commercial banks. The PCGs will be provided without government \ncounter-guarantee.  The  facility  will  partially  cover  payment  default  risk  on  loans  made  by \napproved  partner  banks  to  private  sector  borrowers  in  India  implementing  solar  power \ngeneration  projects  as  awarded  under  the  National  Solar  Mission  or  an  approved  state \ngovernment solar power policy.  \n  \n\n2. \n\nTerms and Conditions \n\n42. \nA guarantee term sheet template has been presented to prospective partner banks and \na summary term sheet template is in Appendix 7. The guarantee agreement to be entered into \nwith  respective  partner  banks  will  ensure  that  the  net  present  value  of  the  outstanding \nguaranteed principal and accrued guaranteed interest shall not exceed 50% of the total principal \nof  the  guaranteed  loan.  The  facility  will  be  available  for  3  years  from  Board  approval,  with \nproject loans having a maximum tenor of up to 15 years (exceptional consideration of tenors of \nup to 18 years subject to agreement by ADB). A guaranteed loan may be made in Indian rupees \nor  any  foreign  currency  that  is  acceptable  to  the  lender  and  ADB.  The  Investment  Committee \ndetermines up-front fees, standby fees, and guarantee fees. \n \n\n3. \n\nCompliance with Investment Limitations  \n\nThe  proposed  facility  will  be  within  the  country,  industry,  group,  and  single  project \n\n43. \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n                                                 \n14  Inclusive of up-front arrangement fees, commitment fees, margins over the cost of funds, and any guarantee fees. \n15 Guarantees  issued  in  currencies  other  than  U.S.  dollars  will  be  adjusted  on  a  quarterly  basis  to  ensure  the \n\nproposed ceiling amount for the Facility limit shall not be breached. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n12  \n \n\n \nB. \n\nJustification for ADB Assistance \n\n44.  While solar power technologies have been commercially proven in developed markets \nsuch as Germany, Spain, and the United States, there was only 11 MW of installed capacity in \nIndia as of December 2010 (mostly installed in 2010). 16  Lenders remain concerned about the \nrisks  of  solar  technology  performance,  unproven  indigenization  of  the  technology  to  India\u2019s \nclimatic conditions, and the nascent stage of regulatory development with respect to renewable \nand  specifically  solar  energy.  ADB\u2019s  participation  as  a  guarantor  will  help  mitigate  risks  and \nleverage  commercial  funds  into  a  new  subsector  in  India.  The  facility  leverages  commercial \nbank  loans  and  builds  capacity  at  the  appropriate  institutions  that  can  apply  such  knowledge \nand lessons to future lending in India.  \n \n45. \n\nADB\u2019s support for the facility is justified based on the following: \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nADB assistance will play a crucial role in helping solar projects close affordable \nlong-term  financing,  which  is  a  necessary  condition  for  the  viability  of  a  solar \nproject. As a result of the recent banking crisis, liquidity remains limited, and local \nbanks  can  rarely  provide  clean  (or  uncovered)  loans  for  more  than  8\u201310  years \nwithout recourse to project sponsors. Tenors required for solar power generation \nprojects  are  typically  longer  than  other  energy  projects.17 ADB\u2019s  PCG  will  share \nproject risks with banks (to reduce the cost of financing) and extend commercial \nbank tenors to fund power generation plants that have high up-front investment \ncosts,  but  no  recurrent  fuel  cost.  Without  the  cover  provided  by  ADB\u2019s  PCG, \nprojects  may  obtain  finance  but  they  will  do  so  with  the  inevitable  condition  of \nhaving  to  seek  refinancing  after  commissioning  when  operational  performance \nhas  been  proven.  This  is  a  cost-inefficient  process  that  can  be  mitigated  more \nappropriately through up-front risk-sharing arrangements. \n\nSponsors or developers of solar power projects expect that ADB\u2019s participation in \nthe  financing  will  trigger  local  and/or  international  bank  participation,  additional \nequity  investment,  and  further  interest  in  the  financing  of  solar  projects.  ADB\u2019s \nPCG  in  particular  encourages  the  commitment  of  local  commercial  banks,  which \nhave little experience in solar energy. \n\nThe facility will play a pioneering role in demonstrating the commercial viability of \ngrid-connected solar photovoltaic technology in India. The projects will be among \nthe  first  grid-connected  power  generation  projects  with  a  commercial  component \nunder  the  NSM  or  state  schemes.  Once  solar  power  performance  under  Indian \nclimatic conditions is proven, this will catalyze the deployment of larger-scale solar \nprojects  (important  to  generate  sufficient  demand  for  local  manufacturing  and \neconomies of scale) and increase foreign private sector investment. \n\n \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\nThe facility directly achieves the strategies outlined by ADB\u2019s energy community of \npractice  in  the  ASEI  for  mainstreaming  solar  projects  through  (i)  supporting  the \n\n                                                 \n16  This figure incorporates recently commissioned solar projects according to project developers and investors.  \n17  In 2010, the ADB Board of Directors approved long-term loans for two solar power generation projects in Thailand. \nADB.  2010.

Manila (loan tenor of 18 years); ADB. 2010. Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans and Technical Assistance for the \nBangchak Solar Power Project in Thailand. Manila (loan tenor of 15 years). \n\n\f \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n13 \n\ndesign of appropriate policy frameworks and institutional capacity development for \nrapid  diffusion  of  solar  energy  technology  for  power  generation;  (ii)  creating \ninnovative financing mechanisms and risk mitigation measures to encourage solar \npower  generation;  and  (iii)  facilitating  the  development  of  large  capacity  solar \nprojects that drive down solar generation costs toward grid parity. \n\nDirect ADB lending to solar projects may not always be practical, given the small \nsize  and  short  development  and  implementation  timetable.  The  central  or  state \ngovernment  issues  a  solar  power  tariff  order  within  the  CERC  guidelines  and \ninvites investors to tender for allocations based on qualifications, ability to acquire \nland  and  close  financing.  Investors  must  then  deposit  funds  (scaled  based  on \nproject capacity) into a government account to secure their performance. They are \ngiven  a  limited  timeline  (90\u2013180  days)  to  acquire  land,  sign  the  power  purchase \nagreement (PPA), and close financing. The investors\u2019 performance funds would be \nforfeited if the deadlines are breached. It has proven difficult on other projects for \nADB to complete its appraisal and process the transaction within this time frame. \nThe  facility  is  designed  to  work  with  partner  commercial  banks  on  a  streamlined \nbasis to meet financial close within the time lines. \n\n \nC. \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\n46. \nThe  facility  involves  risks  with  respect  to  partner  commercial  banks  and,  as  the \nguarantees  will  be  project-specific,  to  the  projects  themselves.  While  not  an  exhaustive  list  of \nrisks, the following key issues have been examined and mitigated as appropriate: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nTechnology risk. Photovoltaic solar panel technologies are still in the innovation \nstage and are rapidly changing, and often owned by companies with limited track \nrecord  and  weaker  credit  quality.    Moreover,  solar  panel  technologies  have \nvarying  track  record  in  terms  of  efficiency  and  degradation  rates.    This  risk  is \nmitigated to some extent by the eligibility criteria established for the selection of \nequipment  manufacturers  based  on  their  operating  track  record  and  installed \ncapacity. ADB consultants under the parallel TA will help validate these risks.  In \naddition,  more  stringent  performance  and  cash  flow  stress  scenarios  will  be \napplied to the base case projections to ascertain debt servicing ability.   \n\nSponsor  risk.    The  projects\u2019  key  risks,  i.e.,  technology,  limited  track  record  of \nequipment  manufacturers,  the  nascent  solar  power  sector  in  India,  substantial \nlong-term exposures, and relatively high leverage (i.e., up to 70% of the project \ncosts), will be partially mitigated by the sponsors\u2019 guarantee for completion of the \nproject.  Given the critical role of the sponsors, certain eligibility criteria related to \nthe  sponsor\u2019s  experience  in  the  sector,  the  sponsor\u2019s  equity  investment  in  the \nproject, and solvency and liquidity ratios have been included in the program.   \n\nOfftaker risk.  Projects will be exposed to nonpayment and/or non-dispatch risk \nfrom  the  SEBs  or  defaults  from  NVVN.  Through  existing  TA  support,  ADB  has \nbeen  advising  MNRE  on  drafting  of  the  NVVN  PPA,  and  based  on  continued \ndialogue  with  banks  and  developers,  the  bankability  of  the  PPA  has  been \nimproved  as  a  result,  including  the security  provisions  and  step-in  rights  for  the \nlenders. There is divergence in the credit profiles of the solar power offtakers for \nthe  projects  being  considered  under  the  proposed  facility.    The  NSM  projects \nbenefit from much lower offtaker risks as NVVN, has a reasonably strong credit \n\n \n\n\f14  \n \n\n \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\nprofile. On the other hand, state government supported solar power projects may \nface  higher  offtaker  risks  given  the  weak  credit  profile  of  the  state  electricity \nboards.  The  PPAs  signed  with  GUVNL  have  a  slightly  different  tariff  structure, \nwhich  somewhat  reduces  the  payment  burden  on  distribution  utilities  and  is \nexpected to reduce the risk of PPA  renegotiation. In addition, the PPA includes \ncompensation payments equivalent to 3 years of revenue in the event of default \nor termination, which may act as a deterrent but may not essentially mitigate the \nunderlying  credit  risks.  In  addition,  the  program  aims  to  diversify  exposures \nacross various offtakers by including exposure limits.  \n\nRegulatory risk. The regulatory environment pertaining to solar power in India is \nstill  evolving  and  may  change  over  the  course  of  the  program  and  adversely \naffect the viability of the projects. The central and state governments have shown \na  significant  commitment  to  promote  electricity  supply  from  renewable  energy \nsources (for energy supply diversification as well as climate change motivations) \nby  introducing  the  RPO  requirement,  the  percentage  of  which  increases  every \nyear.  The  National  Tariff  Policy  was  amended  in  January  2011  to  enact  solar-\nspecific  RPOs  as  well,  demonstrating  the  political  will  to  support  the  National \nSolar  Mission.  Some  state  regulators  introduced  solar  RPO  requirements  even \nbefore the policy was amended. Purchases from solar power are exempted from \nmarket dispatch orders by state regulators (i.e., \u201cmust run\u201d status). That said, it is \nvery likely that comparable solar technology would be more efficient and cheaper \nin the medium-to-long-term.  This would decrease the competitive standing of the \npresent  pipeline  of  projects,  which  require  higher  tariffs  to  recover  the  higher \ntechnology  and  investment  costs.    This  would  thus  expose  the  underlying \nprojects  and  ADB  to  regulatory  risks  as  offtakers  may  seek  to  renegotiate \ncontracts and tariffs.  As the credit profile of most of the state offtakers is already \nstressed  from  under-recovery  of  costs  for  conventional  power,  the  incentive-\nbased  payments  required  to  establish  the  viability  of  solar  photovoltaic  or  solar \nthermal power projects may add to their financial burden and over time, increase \nthe risks of nonpayment under contracted terms.  This is mitigated by the strong \ncommitment  of  the  Government  of  India  to  solar  power  projects  with  the \nintroduction of very robust regulatory framework.    \n\nRisk  sharing  with  partner  banks.    The  project  borrowers  will  ultimately  be \nresponsible for loan repayment. However, there is risk that they will be unable to \nservice the guaranteed loans. By carefully selecting each partner bank, ADB will \nensure that appropriate credit assessment and due diligence is carried out before \nany  guaranteed  loan  is  advanced.  The  proposed  facility  may  provide  a  back-\nended guarantee structure, with ADB providing up to 100% cover to the partner \nbanks on the default risk of the underlying projects. For these projects, there are \nconcerns as it may trigger a sense of complacency in the due diligence, project \nselection  and  exposure  monitoring  activities  of  the  partner  banks  under  the \ncomfort that ADB will eventually absorb all the credit losses in the latter years of \nthe  loan  tenor.  This  concern  is  aggravated  by  the  partner  banks\u2019  limited \nexperience in financing solar power in India and the expectations that over time, \nADB will reduce its involvement in the project assessment process. To align the \ninterests of the partner banks with that of ADB and incentivize the partner banks \nto  exercise  risk  discipline  in  its  approval  and  monitoring  process,  it  was  agreed \nthat  ADB\u2019s  100%  cover  will  be  limited  to  the  tail  end  of  the  loan  and  the \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\nguarantee fee would be structured such that partner banks have an incentive to \nconsider continued financial support to the projects on a stand-alone basis.   \n\nLack  of  technical  expertise  of  partner  banks  in  the  evaluation  of  solar \npower projects.  The potential partner banks\u2019 have limited technical expertise in \nthe evaluation of solar power projects. Although the parallel TA would help build \ntheir internal capacity, these benefits may only  be realized in the medium term, \nwhile the build up of exposure under the facility may occur at a more rapid pace. \nSome foreign banks operating in India may have some experience in the sector; \nhowever,  they  may  not  have  an  in-depth  knowledge  of  the  sponsors  and  the \nregulatory  framework  in  the  country.  To  mitigate  this,  operating  arrangements \nhave been established such that ADB will be actively involved in the selection of \nprojects  by  each  of  the  banks,  and  in  the  initial  transactions,  this  involvement \nwould  be  more  detailed  until  confidence  is  established  with  the  partner  bank\u2019s \nproject selection abilities.  \n\nSelection  of  partner  banks.    ADB  will  rely  on  the  partner  banks  for  the \nselection, structuring, and monitoring of the projects.  Although broad criteria has \nbeen  established  for  the  selection  of  partner  banks,  there  is  a  need  for  ADB  to \nconduct  a  more  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  risk  profile  of  local \ncommercial  banks  (i.e.,  those  without  an  international  credit  rating).    Although \nADB  will  not  be  exposed  to  any  direct  credit  risk  on  the  partner  banks,  any \ndistress in their financial condition would divert resources and may reduce their \noversight over the projects covered under the facility. This aspect is critical given \nthe long-dated maturity and the proposed back-ended guarantee scheme.  This \nrisk  will  be  mitigated  by  the  detailed  evaluation  of  the  credit  profile  of  potential \nlocal  partner  commercial  banks  both  at  the  initial  selection  stage  and  on  an \nannual basis.     \n\n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\n47. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of India will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed facility. \nADB will enter into suitable guarantee agreements and other required legal documents once the \nproposed facility is approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors and the individual partner banks are \napproved by ADB\u2019s Investment Committee. These agreements will be on terms and conditions \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  guarantee  facility  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n48. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nguarantee  facility  for  ADB  to  issue  partial  credit  guarantees  without  government  counter-\nguarantee, in amounts, in aggregate, of up to $150,000,000 (or its equivalent in Indian rupees or \nother  foreign  currency  acceptable  to  ADB)  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  in  favor  of \neligible foreign and local commercial banks lending to solar power generation projects in India, \nwith  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  this \nreport, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n\n \nHaruhiko Kuroda  \n\n \n\n\f16  \n \n\n \n\n \n17 March 2011 \n \n\nPresident  \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n\nData Sources and/or \nReporting Mechanisms \n \nMinistry of New and \nRenewable Energy \nstatistics \n \nDistribution company \ndata and annual reports \n \nSolar industrial \nassociations reports \n \nCompany annual reports \n \nCentral and state \nelectricity regulatory \ncommission orders and \nreports \n\nAppendix 1    17 \n \n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks  \n\nAssumptions \nStable and consistent \nregulatory policies for the \nrenewable energy sector \n \nConsistent policy decisions \nby the government for the \nNational Solar Mission \n \nRisks \nChange of government, \nwhich impacts renewable \nenergy policies \n \nSupply of solar energy \nexceeds RPO requirements \nplus the demand for \nrenewable energy \ncertificates \n \n \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nSuccessful \nimplementation of \nphase 1 of the NSM \n \n \n \nIncreased foreign \ndirect investment by \nthe private sector in \nthe solar energy \nindustry \n \n \n \n \n \nLong-term reduction in \nlevelized cost of solar \nenergy in India \n \n\nOutcome \nSolar power \ngenerating facilities \nunder India's National \nSolar Mission and \nstate power schemes \ninstalled and deliver \nenergy to the grid \n \n\n \nNVVN reports \n \nCarbon market reports \n \nCentral and state \nelectricity regulatory \ncommission reports \n\nAssumptions \nPlants achieve capacity \nutilization factors and \nenergy yields within the \nestimates assumed by \nfinanciers and investors \n \nOfftakers honor the \npayment and tariff \nprovisions in the PPAs and \nthere are no defaults by \nSEBs (either directly or \nthrough NVVN) \n \nRisks \nSolar-specific RPO orders \nare not issued or delayed \n\n \n\nPerformance Targets \nand/or Indicators \n\n \n1,100 MW of solar \ncapacity \ncommissioned by \n2011;

According \n1. \nto the Central Electricity Authority, the energy shortage in 2010\u20132011 is expected to be 10.6% \n(93  terawatt-hours)  and  the  corresponding  peak  load  deficit  is  expected  to  be  12.1%  (the \nequivalent  energy  of  15  gigawatts).1 For  annual  gross  domestic  product  growth  of  8%,  it  is \nestimated  that  India  will  have  to  double  its  current  installed  capacity  to  over  300  gigawatts  by \n2017.2 \n \n2. \nFossil fuels dominate the power generation mix, with coal accounting for over 50% of the \npower  generation  capacity  in  India.  The  total  installed  power  generation  capacity  in  India  in \nOctober 2010 was 167,278 megawatts (MW). Of this, 64.9% was fossil fuel fired power plants \n(coal, gas, and diesel); 22.3% hydropower; 2.7% nuclear power; and 10% renewable energy.3 \nIndia\u2019s energy sector contributes about 58% of the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.4 India \nis  implementing  a  National  Action  Plan  on  Climate  Change  that  suggests  that  15%  of  energy \ncould come from renewable sources by 2020. \n \n3. \nIndia has vast solar energy potential. About 5 billion megawatt-hours (MWh) per year of \nenergy exist over India\u2019s land area, with most regions receiving 4\u20137 kilowatt-hours per square \nmeter  (kWh/per  m2)  per  day,  averaging  4.5 kWh/m2/day  nationally.  This  rate  of  insolation  is \namong the highest in the world, comparing favorably with Australia (4.7 kWh/m2/day) and ahead \nof  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (3.4 kWh/m2/day)  and  Western  Europe  (2.9  kWh/m2/day).5 \nEffective unlocking of this potential will enable rapid capacity addition with relatively short lead \ntimes  (e.g.,  less  than  1  year)  and  no  additional  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Unfortunately,  the \ntotal  costs  (capital  and  operating  costs)  for  solar  power  generation  are  currently  significantly \nhigher that thermal power stations, which are centralized and sized (e.g., 2,000\u20134,000 MW) to \nreap economies of scale. \n \n4. \nThe  Jawaharlal  Nehru  National  Solar  Mission  (NSM),  launched  in  January  2010,  is  an \ninitiative  of  the  central  and  state  governments  to  promote  ecologically  and  economically \nsustainable  growth  in  solar  power  generation  by  creating  an  enabling  policy  and  regulatory \nframework. The NSM is one of eight national missions outlined in the National Action Plan on \nClimate Change.6 \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe  objective  of  the  NSM  is  to  establish  India  as  a  global  leader  in  solar  energy  by \ncreating  the  policy  conditions  for  its  diffusion  across  the  country  as  quickly  as  possible.  The \nimmediate aim of the mission is to focus on setting up an enabling environment for penetration \nof  solar  technology  in  the  country  both  at  centralized  (utility-scale,  grid-connected)  and \ndecentralized  (off-grid,  rural  electricity  supply)  levels.  The  mission  will  adopt  a  three-phase \n\nObjectives and Targets \n\n                                                 \n1   2011, Load Generation Balance Report 2010-11, Central Electricity Authority, Ministry of Power. \n2   2009, Powering India: The Road to 2017, McKinsey & Company. \n3   2010, Monthly Power Sector Report: October 2010, Central Electricity Authority, Ministry of Power. \n4   2010, Agence France-Presse, Quoting a report from the Ministry of Environment, Government of India. \n5   2009,  Development  Challenges  for  Large  Scale  on-grid  Solar  PV  Implementations,  Singapore,  Conergy \n\n(Referencing International Energy Agency Greenhouse Gas R&D Program, Gloucestershire, UK. 2003) \n\n6   The  other  seven  national  missions  cover  enhanced  energy  efficiency,  sustainable  habitat,  water,  sustaining  the \n\nHimalayan ecosystem, green India, sustainable agriculture, and strategic knowledge for climate change. \n\n \n\n\f20    Appendix 2 \n\napproach, spanning the remaining period of the Eleventh Five Year Plan, 2007\u201320127 and the \nfirst year of  the 12th plan (up to 2012-13) as phase 1, the remaining 4 years of the 12th plan \n(2013\u20132017)  as  phase  2,  and  the  13th  plan  (2017\u20132022)  as  phase  3.

Jawaharlal  Nehru  National  Solar  Mission: Towards  Building  Solar \nIndia. \n \nC. \n \n6. \nTo achieve the NSM objective, it is critical to create a policy and regulatory environment \nthat  provides  a  predictable  incentive  structure  that  enables  rapid  and  large-scale  capital \ninvestment in solar energy applications and encourages technological innovation and lowering \nof costs. NSM activities are currently embedded within the existing framework of the Electricity \nAct,  2003;  National  Electricity  Policy,  2005;  and  the  National  Tariff  Policy,  2006  (and  as \namended  in  December  2010).  However,  in  the  long  run,  sector-specific  legal  and  regulatory \nframeworks will be established for the development of solar power. \n \n\n1.  \n\nElectricity Act, 2003 \n\n \n7. \nThe Electricity Act, 2003 has been a major step toward liberalizing the power market in \nIndia  along  the  value  chain,  encouraging  competition  and  attracting  private  investment.  Under \nthe  act\u2019s  part  VII  section  61(h),  the  promotion  of  cogeneration  and  electricity  generation  from \nrenewable  sources  is  identified  as  a  consideration  in  the  establishment  of  tariff  regulations, \nallowing the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) to establish a preferential tariff \nfor renewable energy.8 Further, the \u201copen access\u201d provision allows licensed renewable energy \npower generators access to transmission lines and distribution systems and only requires that \nthe generators pay a wheeling charge for the use of the transmission lines and a fee to the load \ndispatch center. \n \n\n2. \n\nNational Electricity Policy, 2005 \n\n \n8. \nThe  National  Electricity  Policy,  2005,  stipulates  the  need  for  increasing  the  share  of \nelectricity  from  nonconventional  sources  and  allows  for  the  state  electricity  regulatory \ncommissions (SERCs) to establish a preferential tariff for electricity generated from renewable \nsources  to  enable  them  to  be  cost-competitive.9 Section  5.12.3  of  the  policy  encourages  the \ndevelopment of cogeneration facilities and allows for SERCs to promote arrangements between \n\n                                                 \n7  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2008.

The objective of this \npolicy  is  to  enable  renewable  energy  technologies  to  compete  with  conventional  sources. \nSection  6.4  of  the  National  Tariff  Policy  calls  for  the  relevant  commission  to  establish \npreferential  tariffs  with  distribution  companies  for  the  purchase  of  electricity  from  non-\nconventional technologies.10 The National Tariff Policy mandates that each SERC specify RPOs \nby distribution companies in a time-bound manner. Given the magnitude and importance of the \nactivities  under  the  NSM,  solar-specific  amendments  have  been  made  to  these  RPOs.  In \nJanuary 2011, the union cabinet approved the proposal from the Ministry of Power to amend the \nNational Tariff Policy to fix a percentage of energy purchase from solar power under the RPOs. \nThe solar power purchase obligation for the states will start at 0.25% (by 2013) and increase up \nto 3% by 2022. \n \n\n4. \n\nRenewable Purchase Obligations \n\n \n10. \nAs of December 2010, 18 states have established RPOs or have draft regulations under \nconsideration  (Table  A2.2)  with  RPO  requirements  ranging  from  1%  to  15%  of  total  electricity \ngeneration.  Solar  RPOs  have  also  been  specified  in  most  cases,  and  it  is  expected  that  the \nstate  level  tariff  orders  will  be  modified  to  conform  to  the  minimum  solar  power  purchase \nobligations specified by the Ministry of Power. \n \n\nTable A2.2: State Renewable Purchase Obligations \n \n\nState \nAndhra Pradesh \n\nOrder date \n6 Jul 10 \n\nRPO (per annum) \n5% \n\nSolar RPO (per annum) \n0.25% \n\nBihar \n\n2 Aug 10 \n\n1.5% (for FY2011, 2.5% for FY2012, \n4.0% for FY2013) \n\n0.25% (for FY2011, 0.5% for FY2012, \n0.75% for FY2013) \n\nChhattisgarh \n\n9 Nov 10 \n\n5%  (for  FY2011,  5.25%  for  FY2012, \n5.5% for FY2013) \n\n0.25% (for FY2011-FY2013) \n\nGujarat \n\n17 Apr 10 \n\n5% (for FY2011, 6% for FY2012, 7% \nfor FY2013) \n\n0.25% \nFY2013) \n\n(0.5% \n\nin  FY2012;  1% \n\nin \n\nHaryana \n\nHimachal \nPradesh \n\n8 Jul 10 \n\n1% \n\n0.25% (for FY2011; 3% for FY2022) \n\n12 Mar 10 \n\n10.1%  (annual  increase  of  1%  until \nFY2013) \n\n0.1% (until FY2013) \n\nKarnataka \n\n11 Feb 08 \n\n10% \n\nKerala \n\n23 Nov 10 \n\nMadhya Pradesh \n\n7 Nov 08 \n\n10% \n\nMaharashtra \n\n3 Mar 10 \n\n3% \n(for  FY2010,  with  annual \nincrease  of  0.3%  until  a  maximum \nRPO of 10%) \n\n0.25% \n\n \n\n \n\n6%  (annual  increase  of  1%  until \nfor  FY2015  and \nFY2014;  9% \n\n0.25% (for FY2011\u2013FY2013; 0.5% for \nFY2014\u2013FY2016) \n\n                                                 \n10 Ministry of Power. 2010.

In some states (such \nas Delhi), the potential for harnessing renewable energy compared with the demand for energy \nis very small. In other states such as Tamil Nadu (wind), Rajasthan (solar) or Himachal Pradesh \n(hydro),  it  is  very  high.  This  variability  offers  opportunities  for  interstate  trading  in  the  form  of \nrenewable energy credits (RECs). \n \n12. \nIn  January  2010,  CERC  announced  the  terms  and  conditions  for  a  tradable  REC \nprogram. Under this program, the renewable energy generators will have two options: (i) sell the \nrenewable  energy  at  a  preferential  tariff  fixed  by  the  concerned  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission,  or  (ii)  sell  the  electricity  generated  and  the  environmental  attributes  associated \nwith the generation, separately.11 On choosing the second option, the environmental attributes \ncan  be  exchanged  in  the  form  of  a  REC.  The  price  of  the  electricity  component  would  be \nequivalent to the weighted average purchase cost to the distribution company, including short-\nterm power purchase but excluding renewable power purchase cost. CERC will issue the RECs \nand the value of one REC will be equivalent to 1 MWh of electricity delivered to the grid from \nrenewable energy sources. \n\n\u00a0\n13. \nThe RECs can be traded only on power exchanges approved by CERC within the band \nof a floor price and a ceiling price to be determined by CERC. The floor price is determined by \n\n                                                 \n11  CERC. 2010. \u201cCERC Announces Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Regulation\u2014A Step Forward for Green \n\nEnergy Promotion.\u201d Press Release (18 January). \n\n\fAppendix 2      23 \n\nkeeping  in  view  the  minimum  requirements  for  ensuring  the  viability  of  the  renewable  energy \nprojects set up to meet the RPO targets. This viability requirement covers loan repayment and \ninterest  charges,  operation  and  maintenance  expenses,  and  fuel  expenses  in  the  case  of \nbiomass and cogeneration projects. The ceiling price is derived based on the highest difference \nbetween the cost of generation for the renewable energy technologies and/or renewable energy \ntariff  and  the  average  power  purchase  cost  for  the  respective  states.  Based  on  the  above \nprinciples, CERC has specified the following floor and ceiling prices for the RECs (Table A2.3). \nThese prices shall remain valid up to FY2012. \n\n\u00a0\nTable A2.3: Floor and Forbearance Prices for Renewable Energy Certificates \n(Rs/MWh) \n\nApplicable Renewable Energy Certificate \nSolar  \nNon-solar  \nMWh = megawatt-hour, Rs = Indian rupees. \nSource: Central Electricity Regulatory Commission. 2010.

In  February  2010,  CERC  announced  a  feed-in  tariff  for  FY2011  of  Rs17.9  per \nkWh for photovoltaic and Rs15.3 per kWh for concentrated solar power, and declared that the \nPPAs would have a validity of 25 years. When NVVN supplies bundled power to state utilities at \nthe rates determined in accordance with CERC regulations, those state utilities will be entitled to \nuse the solar part of the bundled power for meeting their RPOs under the Electricity Act, 2003. \n \n\n                                                 \n12 NTPC is a regulated central power utility, majority owned by the Government of India. While 85% of the capacity of \nits power plants is contracted through long-term PPAs, 15% is reserved  by the Ministry of Power to be allocated \nand  sold  by  the  NTPC  to  energy-deficient  states  on  an  annual  basis.

In Gujarat, the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission devised a \nsolar  power  procurement  tariff  regime.  Under  this  regime,  Gujarat  Urja  Vikas  Nigam  Limited \n(GUVNL) will enter into 25-year power purchase agreements with private developers for offtake \nof solar power. The tariff will be fixed at Rs15 per kWh for the first 12 years and Rs5 per kWh for \nthe  remaining  13  years.  The  GUVNL  PPA  includes  several  notable  aspects,  including \ntermination payments under certain events of default. \n \nD. \n \n16. \nIt  is  envisaged  that  the  NSM  will  be  implemented  by  an  autonomous  Solar  Energy \nAuthority embedded within the existing structure of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. \nThe  authority  secretariat  will  monitor  technology  developments,  review  and  adjust  incentives, \nmanage funding requirements, and execute pilot projects.

\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n \n\nSolar Power Generation Guarantee Facility \n \nPrivate Sector Operations Department \nInfrastructure Finance Division 1 \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. \n\nLinks to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\nThe India country partnership strategy, 2009\u20132012 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will continue to emphasize \ninfrastructure development (e.g., transport, energy, urban, and water resource management). ADB\u2019s energy program \nin  India  aims  to  enhance  the  impact  of  the  government\u2019s  initiatives  for  demand-  and  supply-related  programs.  The \nplanned activities include (i) developing renewable and alternative energy sources, and clean generation technology; \n(ii) reducing technical and commercial losses in transmission and distribution networks and facilities; (iii) strengthening \ninterregional  transmission  capacity;  (iv)  bringing  demand-side  management  and  energy  conservation  into  the \nmainstream; and (v) promoting private sector participation, while ensuring environmental sustainability, and supporting \ninstitutional  strengthening  to  implement  the  reforms  required  by  the  Electricity  Act,  2003.  The  project  is  also  directly \naligned with ADB\u2019s Asia Solar Energy Initiative (ASEI) to (i) facilitate knowledge sharing and transfer for solar power; \n(ii)  help  develop,  finance,  and  commission  3,000  megawatts  (MW)  of  solar  power  generation  capacity  in  developing \nmember  countries  (DMCs)by  March  2013;  and  (iii)  pilot  test  innovative  financing  mechanisms  and  risk  mitigation \nmeasures specifically for solar power. The ASEI seeks to stimulate solar power development in DMCs in Asia with the \ngoal of (i) increasing economies of scale to reduce costs and improve solar energy\u2019s competitiveness within the grid; \n(ii) exploit select DMCs\u2019 solar radiation resources, service their fast growing electricity demand, and utilize their greater \navailability of land compared with most developed countries; and, (iii) promote DMCs\u2019 potential to become global and \nregional manufacturing hubs for solar technology goods and equipment. \n \nThe  guarantee  facility  will  mobilize  commercial  financing  to  an  estimated  150  MW  of  solar  power,  which  will  help \ndiversify  the  country\u2019s  energy  mix.  The  facility  will  provide  credit  guarantees  in  favor  of  commercial  banks  that  will \nextend  credit  to  multiple  special  purpose  companies  that  intend  to  develop  small-scale  solar  power  generation \nprojects.  The  projects  will  increase  the  reliability  and  availability  of  electricity  in  areas  where  it  is  located.  This  will \nincrease economic growth through increased commercial and/or enterprise activities, and more opportunities can be \ntapped from this development at state, local, and community level. \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\nTargeting Classification: General Intervention \n\nKey issues. The projects that will be covered under the guarantee facility will indirectly contribute to poverty reduction. \nThe  projects  will  contribute  to  the  country\u2019s  poverty  reduction  effort  on  three  main  fronts:  (i)  the  operation  of  the \nprojects will add needed electricity to the grid for use by the state population and promote economic activities; as the \nprojects  operate,  they  contribute  to  the  state  tax  system,  where  tax  revenue  can  be  streamed  to  promote  poverty \nreduction  activities;  (ii)  the  projects  will  tap  a  renewable  energy  source,  thereby  displacing  potential  reliance  on \nimported  fuel  sources  and  will  create  outright  savings  and  foreign  exchange  savings  that  could  be  utilized  for  other \nproductive purposes; and (iii) during its construction, operation, and maintenance phases, the project will provide job \nopportunities to local communities and promote economic activities in the vicinity.  \n\nDesign\u00a0 features.\u00a0 The guarantee facility will provide credit guarantees in favor of commercial banks that will extend credit \nto independent power producer borrowers that intend to develop small-scale solar power generation projects. Projects \nwill include solar power generation facilities in India with an installed capacity of not less than 2 MW and not more than \n25 MW that are connected to the relevant state electricity grid. Projects that will be guaranteed by the facility will have \na direct and material impact to poverty reduction efforts. \n\n \n\n\f30    Appendix 4 \n\nA. \n\nFindings of Social Analysis \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nLand  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement.  Most  solar  projects  are  being  sited  on  barren  or  unproductive \ngovernment  land  in  a  coordinated  effort  by  state  governments.  A  5  MW  solar  power  plant  will  require  about \n12 hectares  of  land.  No  physical  displacement  is  expected  since  lands  can  be  flexibly  acquired  to  avoid  impacts  on \nexisting villages and communities. Partner banks extending credit to special purpose vehicles (SPVs) for developing \nsolar  power  projects  will  be  assisted  in  establishing  their  own  environmental  and  social  management  systems \n(ESMSs) to ensure that projects are screened for involuntary resettlement impacts and relevant plans are prepared in \naccordance with national laws and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). For some projects where land has been \nacquired through expropriation or purchased through negotiations, the ESMS for each commercial bank or lender will \nrequire  a  social  compliance  audit,  including  on-site  assessment,  to  (i)  identify  past  or  present  concerns  related  to \nimpacts  on  the  involuntary  resettlement,  and  tribal  communities  that  may  be  considered  indigenous  peoples; \n(ii) determine  whether  actions  were  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  principles  and  requirements  and  to  identify \nand plan measures to address outstanding compliance issues.  \n \nImpact on indigenous peoples and/or scheduled tribes. Potential impacts to indigenous peoples and/or scheduled \ntribes  can  only  be  ascertained  once  specific  sites  for  projects  are  located.  All  mitigating  measures  that  will  address \ndirect and indirect impacts on indigenous peoples/scheduled tribes will be addressed following the ESMS.  \n \nLabor, gender, and other social issues. No significant issues pertaining to labor, gender, and other social issues are \nexpected. The construction phase of projects is relatively short compared with other power generation infrastructure. \nInflux of population as a result of the project is unlikely. Social dimensions of each solar power project will be analyzed \nas part of the environmental and social assessment to be undertaken by each SPV in accordance with the Safeguard \nPolicy Statement and agreed  ESMS. The ESMS of each  partner bank  will contain requirements for SPVs to include \ncompliance with core labor standards in the bidding documents for civil works contracts. \n \nEach  partner  bank  will  establish  an  ESMS  following  the  ESMS  arrangements  and  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement. \nThe  ESMS  satisfactory  to  ADB  shall  be  adopted  and  established  by  each  partner  bank  prior  to  ADB  issuing  a \nguarantee for the first project.  \nB. \n\nConsultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation (C&P) process during project preparation. \n\nConsultations  were  conducted  with  other  international  financial  institutions  and  other  international  and  local \ncommercial banks that may be interested in becoming a partner bank. During project design, the levels of participation \nwill  mainly  include  information  sharing  and  consultation,  and  the  requirements  to  undertake  such  activities  will  be \ndetailed  in  the  ESMS.  If  social  safeguard  plans  are  required  for  a  project,  another  meaningful  consultation  will  be \nundertaken to ensure that the contents of such plans, including grievance redress mechanism, are understood by the \naffected persons or communities. State mandated public hearings for projects may be initiated by state agencies. It is \nalso envisaged that stakeholders\u2019 engagement  will be ongoing during the entire  life of a project,  which may become \npart of a project company\u2019s corporate social responsibility program. \n \n\n2.  What level of C&P is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n   \n\n Information sharing  \n\n Consultation   \n\n Collaborative decision making   \n\n Empowerment \n\n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared for project implementation? \n\n Yes \n\n No  \n\nDetails of the projects\u2019 consultation and participation activities will be detailed in the environmental assessment reports \nthat will be prepared.  \nC. \n\nGender and Development         Gender Mainstreaming Category: Some gender benefits \n\n1.   Key  issues.  Solar  power  projects  have  the  potential  to  engage  or  employ  local  women  on  tasks  such  as \ninstallation of solar panels, operation, and maintenance. In  general terms, the positive economic impact of the new \nenergy source will have a ripple effect on women who run small and medium-sized enterprises. \n\n2.   Key actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access \nto and use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n   \n\n Gender action plan   \n\n Other actions or measures \n\n  \n\n No action or measure \n\nGender  considerations,  particularly  related  to  job  opportunities,  will  be  further  clarified  during  consultation  activities \nand  will  be  incorporated  in  the  overall  project  design,  as  appropriate.  Employee  engagement  (including  contractors) \nwill  include  gender  non-discrimination  and  equal  opportunity  for  qualified  locals.  This  item  shall  be  defined  in  the \nESMS.  \n\n \n\n\fIssue \nInvoluntary resettlement \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \nLimited.

It  also \ndiscusses  the  nature  of  the  projects  that  may  be  financed  by  the  partner  banks  using  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s funds.1 \n \nB. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Management Policy and Applicable Requirements \n\n1. \n\nPolicy \n\n \n2. \nThe  environmental  and  social  management  policy  of  [name  of  partner  bank]  was \napproved  by  the  Board  of  Directors  (or  signed  by  ...........  [the  President],  or  indicate  other \nposition/designation) on \u2026\u2026\u2026. [date/month/year] and states that: \n \n3. \n\nThe objectives of the environmental and social management system are: \n(i) \n\nTo avoid, and when avoidance is not possible, to minimize and mitigate adverse \nimpacts of projects on the environment and affected people; and \nTo maximize opportunities for environmental and social benefits. \n\n(ii) \n\n \n4. \n[Name  of  partner  bank]  continually  endeavors  to  ensure  and  enhance  effective \nenvironmental and social management practices in all its activities, products, and services with \na special focus on the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nEnsuring  that  applicable  environmental  and  social  safeguard  requirements,  as \ndefined below are met for all projects;2  \nFinancing  projects  only  when  they  are  expected  to  be  designed,  constructed, \noperated,  and  maintained  in  a  manner  consistent  with  applicable  environmental \nand social safeguard requirements, as defined below;  \nIntegrating  environmental  and  social  risk  into  its  internal  risk  management \nanalysis; \nEnsuring  appropriate  consultation  and  transparency  in  its  project  company\u2019s \nactivities; \n\n(v)  Working  together  with  project  companies  to  put  into  practice  applicable \n\nenvironmental and social safeguard requirements; and \nPromoting projects with environmental and social benefits. \n\n(vi) \n\nThis policy will be communicated to all staff and operational employees of the company. \n\n2. \n\nApplicable Environmental and Social Safeguard Requirements \n\n[Name of partner bank] will ensure that:   \n(i) \n\nAll  projects  using  ADB  funds  are  screened  against  the  prohibited  investment \nactivities list of the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009); \n\n                                                 \n1  This is a template which will be modified with each partner bank under the facility. \n2   The  term  \u201cprojects\u201d  is  used  in  this  document  to  mean  business  activities  financed  in  part  and  in  full  by  [name  of \n\nbank/lender] using ADB funds.  \n\n \n5. \n \n\n \n\n6. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5      33 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nAll projects using ADB funds with potential significant environmental and/or social \nimpacts are reviewed and evaluated against safeguard requirements 1\u20133 of the \nADB Safeguard Policy Statement; and \nAll  projects  are  reviewed  and  evaluated  against  the  national  laws,  regulations, \nand standards on environment, health, safety, involuntary resettlement and land \nacquisition, indigenous peoples, and physical cultural resources. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Management Procedures \n\n1. \n\nScreening and Categorization \n\n7. \nAt  an  initial  stage  of  identifying  a  project,  the  environmental  and  social  safeguard \nmanager3 (or other designated staff) of the partner bank will apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment \nactivities  list.  If  the  project  involves  a  prohibited  activity,  the  special  purpose  vehicle  company \n(SPV) will be informed that the project will not be considered. Otherwise, the environmental and \nsocial safeguard manager (or other designated staff) will indicate the applicable environmental \nand social safeguard requirements for the project. \n \n8. \nAt the project identification stage, the environmental and social safeguard manager (or \nother  designated  officer)  will  work  with  the  SPV 4 to  make  a  rapid  assessment  of  the  likely \nenvironmental  and  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  and  effects  on  indigenous  peoples.  The \nenvironmental  assessment  checklist  and  social  safeguard  screening  checklist  are  designed  to \nguide the deal team of the partner bank in the rapid assessment of impacts. The checklists are \nused to determine the significance of potential environmental and/or social impacts associated \nwith the project.  \n \n9. \nOnce the checklists and the verification work are completed by the deal team of [name \nof partner bank], the project will be classified as one of the following categories: category A (with \npotential  significant  environmental  and/or  social  impacts),  category  B  (with  less  significant \nenvironmental and/or social impacts), or category C (with minimal or no impacts).  \n \n10. \nThe  deal  team  of  [name  of  partner  bank]  will  take  care  to  assure  that  the  SPV  is  fully \naware of the applicable requirements as summarized in Table A5 that the project is expected to \ncomply with. For projects with potential significant environmental and/or social impacts, the deal \nteam  will  advise  the  SPV  that  (i)  safeguard  requirements  1\u20133  of  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  will apply, including preparation of an environmental impact assessment report and \nan  environmental  management  plan,  a  resettlement  plan,  and/or  an  indigenous  peoples  plan; \nand  (ii)  the  SPV  shall  submit  these  reports  to  [name  of  partner  bank]  for  review.  [Name  of \nbank/lender] will also submit these reports to ADB for review.  \n\n                                                 \n3   The  environmental  and  social  safeguard  manager  (or  other  designated  staff)  can  be  a  full-time  officer  or  a \n\nconsultant of [name of guaranteed lender].  \n\n4   The SPVs will be sponsored by consortia of reputable and creditworthy Indian power developers and solar power \nsystem  integrators,  which  have  established  track  records  in  developing  and/or  commissioning  solar  power \ngeneration facilities. \n\n \n\n \nC. \n\n \n\n\f34     Appendix 5  \n\n \n\nCategory  \n(Risk Rating) \nCategory A (with \npotential significant \nimpacts) \n\n \nTable A5: Safeguard Requirements \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \nSafeguards  \n\nEnvironmental  \nSafeguards  \n\nComply with \n(i) safeguard \nrequirement 1 of the \nADB Safeguard Policy \nStatement, including \nenvironmental impact \nassessment preparation \nand submission; and \n(ii) national laws \n\nComply with \n(i) safeguard \nrequirement 2 of the \nADB Safeguard Policy \nStatement, including \nresettlement plan \npreparation and \nsubmission; and \n(ii) national laws \n\nCategory B (with less \nsignificant impacts) \n\nComply with national \nlaws and ADB\u2019s PIAL \n\nComply with national \nlaws and ADB\u2019s PIAL \n\nCategory C (with \nminimal or no impacts)  \n\nComply with national \nlaws and ADB\u2019s PIAL \n\nComply with national \nlaws and ADB\u2019s PIAL \n\nIndigenous People \nSafeguards \n\nComply with \n(i) safeguard \nrequirement 3 of the \nADB Safeguard Policy \nStatement, including \nindigenous peoples plan \npreparation and \nsubmission; and \n(ii) national laws \n \nComply with national \nlaws and ADB\u2019s PIAL \n \nComply with national \nlaws and ADB\u2019s PIAL \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Assessment, Planning, and Management \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, PIAL = prohibited investment activities list.  \nSource: ADB. 2009.

Each  SPV  will  establish  a \ngrievance mechanism, which will be described in the safeguard plans.  \n \n\n3. \n\nDue Diligence of Partner Banks \n\n15. \nThe environmental and social safeguard manager (or other designated staff) of the deal \nteam  of  [name  of  partner  bank]  will  undertake  environmental  and  social  due  diligence. \nDepending on the complexity of the project, due diligence can be a desk review (for category C \nprojects),  based  on  a  site  visit  (for  category  B  projects),  or  a  full-scale  review  conducted  by \nqualified  staff  in  charge  of  environmental  and  social  safeguards,  or  by  consultant(s)  (for \ncategory  A  projects).  The  SPV  must  provide  all  requested  information  to  the  deal  team,  and \nshould be able to demonstrate responsiveness with regard to the applicable environmental and \nsocial  safeguard  requirements.  A  due  diligence  report  will  be  prepared  for  category  A  and  B \nprojects  and  the  results  of  the  due  diligence  will  be  reflected  in  the  report  to  the  approving \ncommittee of [name of partner bank], which will take into account these issues in approving the \nproject.  \n \n16. \nFor  a  project  using  ADB  funds  and  likely  to  be  classified  category  A  for  any  of  its \nenvironment,  involuntary  resettlement,  or  indigenous  peoples  impacts,  [name  of  partner  bank] \nwill refer the project to ADB and provide a copy of the due diligence report to ADB, and submit \nthe draft environmental impact assessment report, resettlement plan, and/or indigenous peoples \nplan to ADB for review and clearance before the project is approved by [name of partner bank].  \n \nFor  partially  existing  and/or  constructed  and  operational  projects  and  for  which  land \n17. \nacquisition  is  ongoing  or  has  been  completed  by  the  local  government  or  purchased  through \nnegotiated settlements, the partner bank will require the SPV to conduct an environmental and \nsocial  compliance  audit,  including  on-site  assessment,  to  identify  past  or  present  concerns \nrelated to environmental, land acquisition, and involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples \nimpacts. Where noncompliance is identified, the audit report and the corrective action plan will \nbe prepared by the SPV and submitted to the partner bank prior to approval of the project. The \nenvironment and social compliance audit report, including corrective action plan, if any, will be \nmade  available  to  the  public  through  the  ADB  website  in  accordance  with  ADB  information \ndisclosure requirements. \n \n18. \nAll project loan agreements will contain appropriate environmental and social covenants \nrequiring  the  project  to  be  in  compliance  in  all  material  respects  with  the  applicable \nenvironmental and social safeguard requirements as defined herein. \n \n\n4. \n\nCompliance Monitoring and Reporting \n\n19. \nAfter  a  category  A  or  B  project  is  approved,  the  environmental  and  social  safeguard \nmanager (or other designated staff) (i) communicates with the project and confirms from time to \ntime that the SPV is undertaking the obligations of compliance with all applicable environmental \nand social safeguard requirements; and (ii) [name of partner bank] will promptly report to ADB \nany actual or potential breach of the compliance requirements after becoming aware of it. For a \ncategory A project, the environmental and social safeguard manager (or other designated staff) \nwill visit the site to monitor the implementation of environmental management plan, resettlement \nplan, and/or indigenous peoples plan.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36     Appendix 5  \n\n \n\nfor  performance  will  be \n\nthe  ongoing  compliance  against \n\nEnvironmental  and  social  performance  will  be  evaluated  on  an  annual  basis.
