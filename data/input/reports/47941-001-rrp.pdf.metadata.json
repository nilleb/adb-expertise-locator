The  focus  is  to  add  capacity  and  infuse  efficiency  in \norder to enhance trade volumes.  \n   \n3. \nAccording  to  the  Maritime  Agenda,  an  investment  of  Rs1,094  billion  will  be  required  in \nmajor  ports  and  Rs1,679  billion  in  non-major  ports  to  create  additional  capacity.  The  private \nsector is expected to fund 66.0% of the projects in major ports and 96.1% in non-major ports in \nthree  phases  until  2020.6 In  addition to  capacity  investment,  private  sector  participation  in  port \noperation  and  management  (O&M)  service  is  expected  to  lead  to  improved  efficiency,  reduce \nturnaround time (average time spent by a ship from its entry into port waters until its departure), \nand  make  Indian  ports  more  competitive  through  the  introduction  of  the  latest  technology  and \nbetter  management  practices.  Providers  of  specialized  maritime  services  such  as  OSL  can \nbenefit from this drive to improve O&M efficiency at newly developed or expanded ports.7 \n\n                                                 \n1  The World Bank.

The  company  has  sound  commercial,  technical,  and \nfinancial fundamentals, and a proven record that has increased its market share by consistently \ndelivering quality of service and value to its customers.  \n \n5. \nOSL  approached  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  long-term  financing  for  its \ngrowth  in  domestic  and  international  markets.  With  ADB  assistance,  OSL  aims  to  bring  more \nefficient O&M services to ports. This will not only help in providing safe and efficient operations \nbut  also  reduce  turnaround  time\u2014eventually  enhancing India\u2019s  port competitiveness  to  handle \nhigher cargo and export volumes.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n6. \nThe proposed financing will support funding of OSL\u2019s capital expenditure (CAPEX) plan \nuntil 2016. All vessels are expected to be sourced from the international market. The acquisition \nprocess  will  be  sequenced  to  ensure  full  vessel  utilization  and  is  scheduled  to  be  completed \nwithin  24  months.  These  vessels  will  enhance  the  efficiency  of  ports  where  OSL  operates \nthrough more competitive and efficiently run harbor towage, mooring, and pilotage operations.  \n   \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower  \n\n7. \nOSL and its subsidies and joint venture companies (the OSL group) are engaged in the \nacquisition  of  marine  vessels  and  the  provision  of  such  vessels  for  comprehensive  port \nmanagement services across major, non-major, and captive ports in India. OSL\u2019s fleet includes \n78  tugs,  10  pilot  launches,  five  mooring  launches,  six  dredgers,  and  five  barges.  OSL\u2019s  port \nmanagement  services  can  be  broken  down  into four  segments: (i)  port management  services, \nincluding pilotage, harbor towage, and O&M of port marine crafts; ship traffic management and \ncommunications;  mooring  of  ships  and  upkeep  of  mooring  equipment;  upkeep  of  navigational \naids;  and  maintenance  of  navigational  channels;  (ii)  ship-to-ship  transfer  operations  of  crude \nand/or cargo at open sea resulting from ports\u2019 lack of capacity to berth large vessels because of \ndraft restrictions; (iii) cargo lighterage operations necessitated to resolve issues of  congestion \nor draft restriction at ports; and (iv) maintenance and environmental dredging.  \n \n \n8. \nOSL  has  an  ICRA  rating  of  A+  (stable)  on  its  term  loans,  cash  credit,  and  non-fund \nbased  limits.8 According  to  the  most  recent  assessment  by  ICRA  Limited  (ICRA),  the  stable \nrating reflects OSL\u2019s long record, considerable experience, and very strong market position; the \nmedium-to-long tenure of its customer contracts; presence of take-or-pay provisions, resulting in \nassured revenue streams; a good record in securing repeat business; a healthy bidding success \nrate  for  new  contracts;  and  sound  profitability  and  liquidity  profile.  OSL  has  enjoyed  robust \nfinancial performance over the past 3 years with strong liquidity, asset turnover (indication of its \nability  to  roll  over  contracts),  coverage,  and  leverage  ratios.  ICRA  also  forecasts  that  OSL\u2019s \nratings will be strengthened by the favorable long-term demand outlook for port O&M services, \ndriven by the large-scale ongoing and proposed port developments in India. \n   \n \n\n                                                 \n8  ICRA.  2013.  Ocean  Sparkle  Limited.  Delhi.  http://www.icra.in/Files/Reports/Rationale/Ocean%20Sparkle_r_ \n19092013.pdf  ICRA  Limited  was  set  up  in  1991  by  leading  financial  institutions  in  India  as  an  independent  and \nprofessional investment information and credit rating agency. \n\n\f3 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact  \n\nThe development impact includes the growth of private sector participation in India\u2019s port \n9. \noperations through facilitating new investment in the sector, which will help to foster confidence \namong  potential  investors  and  lenders  and  promote  private  sector  investment  in  India\u2019s  port \nsector. The increase in global competitiveness has  placed tremendous demands on improving \nand  optimizing  maritime  infrastructure.  The  proposed  financing  will  help  to  increase  the \ncompetitiveness  of  major  and  non-major  ports,  and  bring  growth  and  opportunities  to  the \nsurrounding  areas  by  catalyzing  and  strengthening  the  private  sector  development  of  India\u2019s \nport operations and maritime infrastructure.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n10. \nThe financing of OSL\u2019s growth will contribute to increasing efficiency and safety in port \noperations  by  supporting  private  sector  expansion  in  port  O&M  services.  OSL  will  apply \ninternational  standards  in  its  port  operations  and  make  the  necessary  investments  to  reduce \ncosts  and  delays  in  major  ports,  which  is  a  major  concern  for  the  growth  of  Indian  ports.  The \nproject    endeavors  to    reduce  in  turnaround  time  at  OSL-operated  ports  from  3.75 days  in \nFY2013  to  3.40  days  in  FY2018,  as  Indian  ports  have  scope  for  improvement  compared  with \nother Asian ports.9 This will eventually lead to an increase in the total volume of cargo handled \nand a reduction in the number of pre- and post-berthing accidents.10 \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n11.   Successful  implementation  will  result  in  the  capacity  expansion  of  port  operations \nOctober  2016.  The  project  will  ensure  that  environment  and  safeguards  standards  are  well \nmaintained and fully met. OSL\u2019s expansion  has potential to create 250 direct jobs in addition to \nother indirect employment opportunities in the ports O&M sector.  \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\nThe proposed financing is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 and the Midterm Review \n12. \nof  Strategy  2020  as  it  (i)  promotes  export-led  growth  through  infrastructure  investment, \n(ii) enhances connectivity and regional integration, and (iii) promotes private sector participation \nin  the  ports  sector  in  Asia.  11 The  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  India,  2013\u20122017 \nhighlights  transport  and  finance  for  infrastructure  as  two  of  the  seven  core  areas  under \ninfrastructure  development  that  support  faster  growth  in  India.  The  project  is  also  aligned  with \nthe  CPS  priority  areas,  specifically  with  regard  to  port  development  and  support  for  the \ninfrastructure sector through nonsovereign operations.12  \n \n\n                                                 \n9 Turnaround times at major Asian ports are Taipei,China (0.71 days); Hong Kong, China (0.72 days); and Singapore \n\n(1.16 days). In India, the average turnaround time at major ports is just below 4 days as of FY2014. \n\n10 C. Ducruet and O. Merk. 2013. Examining container vessel turnaround times across the world.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f4      \n\n \n\n2. \n\n Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\nThe  project  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative, 13  which \n13. \nacknowledges  under  the  regional  cooperation  and  integration  section  the  importance  of \naddressing  trade  growth  constraints,  such  as  indirect  costs  associated  with  unreliable  transit \ntimes, border crossing delays, and handling costs resulting from poor terminal infrastructure.  \n \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\nTable 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements.14 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\n14. \n \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nArrangements \nOSL operates under mid-long term contracts with the port trusts. The tariff at major \nports is regulated by the TAMP. Indian ports levy two types of tariffs: (i) vessel tariffs \n(covering  port  dues,  berth  hire,  pilotage,  lighterage,  and  towage),  and  from  which \nports  pay  specialized  O&M  operators  such  as  OSL;  and  (ii)  cargo  tariffs  (covering \ncargo handling and wharfage). The general framework affecting competition in ports \nO&M in India, as elsewhere, is governed by cabotage laws of the Directorate General \nof  Shipping,  under  which  country  flag  vessels get  first preference  in  the ports  O&M \nsector.  However,  this  is  being  relaxed\u2014opening  up  the  ports  and  shipping  sector, \nincreasing competition, and bringing more sector efficiency. \n2014\u20132016 \nOSL  provides  comprehensive  port  O&M  services  and  operates  independently  or \n(keeping  in  view  tender  requirements,  and  or  legal  or  tax  concerns)  through  its \nsubsidiaries and joint ventures. All OSL port O&M operations are carried out in-house \nby  its  team  of  tug  masters,  pilots,  and  mooring  crew,  all  of  whom  are  required  to \npossess the necessary sea qualifications and/or licenses from government and state \nauthorities  in  addition  to  substantial  seafaring  experience.  Additionally,  OSL  owns \nand operates its own training center with a  simulator, which allows its key technical \nstaff to experience real-time situations and various scenarios that may occur during \noperations. Technical staff are also sent overseas on specialist courses, particularly \nrelated to engine and other machinery maintenance. \nOperation and maintenance of its vessels are carried out by OSL\u2019s own staff.  \nKey performance indicators, including output and outcome indicators, will be reported \nby OSL and monitored by ADB.   \n\nImplementation period \nOperations arrangements \n\nOperation and maintenance \nPerformance monitoring \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  IFC  =  International  Finance  Corporation,  O&M  =  operation  and  maintenance, \nOSL = Ocean Sparkle Limited, TAMP = Tariff Authority of Major Ports. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Ocean Sparkle Limited. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nADB  will  provide  a  corporate  finance  loan  of  up  to  $40  million  in  US  dollars  or  Indian \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n15. \nrupees, or a combination thereof.   \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n16. \nADB\u2019s  participation  will  provide  long-term  US  dollar  and  Indian  rupee  loans  presently \nunavailable in the market because of asset liability mismatches.

To date, ADB has supported policy \nreforms  in  the  sector  through  various  loans  and  technical  assistance  projects,  including  those \nthat  directly  led  to  greater  private  sector  port  involvement  and  investment.  The  proposed \nfinancing  by  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations\u2015the  first  in  India\u2019s  port  sector\u2015complements \nADB\u2019s  public  sector  operations  in  South  Asia,  such  as the  Colombo  Port  Expansion  Project  in \nSri Lanka, which enhances transshipment capacity available for feeder ports in India.15 \n \nBy  adopting  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  OSL  will  strengthen  its \n18. \nenvironment,  occupational,  health,  safety,  and  social  systems.  OSL  considers  this  a  key \nprerequisite  to  entry  in  the  offshore  and  other  Asian  markets,  which  place  a  premium  on \nadherence to best safeguard and safety practices. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n19. \nThe proposed assistance to OSL is classified under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009)  as  general  corporate  finance.  The  loan  is  classified  category  B  for  environment  as  the \nproject\u2019s  potential  environmental  risks  are  not  significant.  OSL\u2019s  environmental  and  social \nmanagement  system  (ESMS)  includes  an  integrated  (safety  and  quality)  management  system \n(IMS)  based  on  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  9001:2000  and  ISO \n14001:2004 standards, and Occupational Health & Safety Advisory Services (OHSAS) 18001. A \ncorporate  audit  was  conducted  on  its  ESMS  and  current  operations.  No  major  environmental \nissues  are  associated  with  the  audited  facilities  and  its  activities.  The  audit  noted  room  for \nimprovement  with  respect  to  OSL\u2019s  accident  classification  and  management  system.  OSL \nmanagement has committed to adopt the audit\u2019s recommendations. ADB is satisfied that OSL\u2019s \nESMS is adequate to comply with the Safeguard Policy Statement requirements, and the client \nhas the capacity to manage the environmental risks. \n \n20. \nThe project is classified category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples \nimpacts  since  OSL\u2019s  operations  are  not  expected  to  entail  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  or \nimpacts  on  indigenous  peoples.  OSL  services  are  provided  within  the  boundaries  of  the  port  \nlimits. OSL is provided office space by the port authorities, while crew is accommodated on the \nvessels.  The  audit  confirmed  that  none  of  the  OSL  operations  have  triggered  resettlement  to \ndate or have the potential for land acquisition or impacts on indigenous peoples. OSL will submit \nannual  reports  to  ADB  on  the  implementation  of  its  ESMS,  including  the  implementation  of \ncorrective actions required by its auditors.  \n \n21. \nOther social dimensions.
