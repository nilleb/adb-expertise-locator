THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the South Asia Subregional \nEconomic Cooperation Road Connectivity Project.1 \n \n2.  The  project  will  promote  regional  connectivity  with  neighboring  countries  through \ninvestments in road construction, a land port and a custom station that will facilitate cross-\nborder trade. The project will also improve Bhutan\u2019s national road network in remote areas in \nthe southeastern part of Bhutan near the border with India, providing people in that region with \nbetter access to economic opportunities and social services. The project will thereby support \nefficient and safe transport of goods within Bhutan and to and from neighboring countries. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Landlocked  Bhutan  faces  unique  development  challenges  and  opportunities.  The \ncountry\u2019s small population of about 720,000 is dispersed throughout its mostly mountainous \nterrain.2 The country is also vulnerable to moderate-to-high seismic risks. This and formidable \nweather conditions make it difficult to achieve economy of scale in delivering services and costly \nto build and maintain vital infrastructure, particularly roads. Bordered by India in the east, west, \nand south, Bhutan is heavily reliant on its much larger neighbor for international trade. India \naccounts for 84% of its exports, including electricity; and 73% of its imports.3 However, Bhutan\u2019s \ninadequate cross-border road network and infrastructure are hampering its international trade \nand logistics. It is important to lower high transport costs and improve poor accessibility, to spur \nthe country\u2019s economic and social development.  \n \n4.  Roads are the main mode of passenger and freight transport within the country and with \nneighboring states in India. The current network comprises about 10,577 kilometers (km) of \nroads,  divided  into  six  major  classes:  (i)  2,438  km  of  national  highways,  (ii)  6  km  of \nexpressways, (iii) 1,178 km of feeder roads, (iv) 350 km of urban roads, (v) 5,375 km of farm \nroads, and (vi) 1,230 km of access roads. Of this network, 93% of all national highways, 90% of \nurban roads, and 20% of feeder and access roads are sealed. However, use of the sealed \nnetwork becomes difficult during the rainy season because narrow roads along steep hillsides \nare prone to landslides. The feeder and farm road network expanded significantly since 2000, \nand 201 of the country\u2019s 205 blocks of villages were connected by motorable roads in 2013. \nHowever, an estimated 20% of rural people still need to travel more than 1 hour to have access \nto essential services. Connecting people to the national highway network will further improve \nthis accessibility. \n \n5.  The national highways are the main arteries in the road network. The Northern East\u2013\nWest Highway (553 km) passes through the center of the country and links Thimphu, which is \nthe capital city of Bhutan, with the central and eastern regions. Several north\u2013south national \nhighways run between points on the border with India and the Northern East-West Highway. \nThese include the main access highway between Thimphu and Phuentsholing, the largest \nborder city with India. The Southern East\u2013West Highway (SEWH) will run for 717 km along the \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 ADB. 2013. Basic Statistics 2013. Manila. \n3 Bhutan\u2019s international sea trade currently moves through Kolkata Port in India. Chittagong Port in Bangladesh is \nexpected to become an alternative port in the future. ", "2 \nborder with India in the south when it is complete, but only 185 km has been built so far. \nAnother 194 km is under construction. Completion of the SEWH is critical. Transport between \neast and west in the country\u2019s south now often involves roundabout routes, either further south \nvia India or through a long indirect journey using the Northern East\u2013West Highway to the north. \nThis constrains economic and social development in the southeastern parts of Bhutan that are \npoorer than most other regions, as well as in places along the border with India that have \nindustrial  estates  and  cross-border  facilities.  Building  a  national  highway  connection  to \nNganglam and Samdrup Jongkhar is important to developing southeastern Bhutan. \n \n6.  The main crossing points between Bhutan and India are at Phuentsholing, Gelephu, \nNganglam, and Samdrup Jongkhar. These border crossings connect Bhutan\u2019s main north\u2013south \nhighways with India\u2019s national highway network. Phuentsholing, in the west, is the busiest, \naccounting for 40% of the passenger vehicles, 55% of the trucks, and 28% of the buses \ncrossing between Bhutan and India each day. The inadequacy of the border facilities in dealing \nwith this traffic causes heavy congestion in the city and is a constraint on trade through the city. \nAbout 26% of the cross-border traffic at Phuentsholing carries materials and products to and \nfrom the  Pasakha  industrial  estate,  located 15 km to the  east.  Provision  of  direct  access \nbetween the Pasakha industrial estate and India, a mini dry port in Phuentsholing, and a bypass \nroad between a mini dry port and a national highway will reduce the transport costs for this \nfreight and increase the movement of goods, which  would in turn improve Bhutan\u2019s trade \ncompetitiveness. \n \n7.  The government\u2019s strategic thrusts under the country\u2019s 11th five-year plan for 2013\u2013\n2018  are inclusive social development, accelerated green economic development, and strategic \ninfrastructure development. 4 The main aim in the transport sector is to ensure safe, efficient, \nand reliable services. Improving efficiency in the sector will boost domestic and cross-border \ntrade and allow better delivery and wider coverage of basic social services. The government \nalso plans to promote eco-friendly transport. This will include the introduction of clean-energy \nvehicles. \n \n8.   The five-year plan\u2019s top priority is to finish the construction and upgrading of the entire \nlength of the SEWH by the end of the plan period, which will cost almost $122 million, or about \n54% of the capital expenditures in the road sector under the plan. Together with planned \nimprovement of the border trade facilities, this will remove the inefficiencies at international land \nborder crossings, improve domestic and international trade, and make the country\u2019s remote \nsoutheastern communities more accessible.  \n  \n9.  In 2001, ADB supported the establishment of the South Asia Subregional Economic \nCooperation  (SASEC)  between  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  and  Nepal.  During  a  series  of \nmeetings of the SASEC transport working group, the members made it a priority for Bhutan to \ndevelop a mini dry port in Phuentsholing and a direct access road between the Pasakha \nindustrial  estate  and  India.  The  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  Road \nConnectivity Project will improve one of the most important segments of the SASEC corridor 2 \nand is one of the projects aimed at strengthening road connectivity along SASEC corridors 4 \nand 8 and in adjoining areas. ADB-supported SASEC road connectivity investment program for \nIndia includes 126 km of Asian Highway 48, which connects Jaigaon City on India\u2019s border with \n                                                \n4 Government of Bhutan.

Thimphu. \n ", "3 \nBhutan with Changrabandha City on its border with Bangladesh.5 To enhance the effectiveness \nof transport infrastructure initiatives in the SASEC subregion, ADB is implementing a trade \nfacilitation program loan and grant project and four technical assistance projects in Bangladesh, \nBhutan, and Nepal.6 These will support efficient, secure cross-border trade processes in the \nsubregion  and  include  the  development  of  modern,  effective  customs  administration  and \nstreamlined, transparent trade procedures. These projects will help Bhutan comply with the \nRevised Kyoto Convention standards to simplify and harmonize customs procedures. \n \n10.  Bhutan has depended on external assistance to develop its road network, mainly from \nADB, the World Bank, and the governments of Austria, India, Japan, the Netherlands, and \nSwitzerland. ADB\u2019s contribution so far has been 7 loans and grants and 17 technical assistance \nprojects, including 7 to prepare projects. The 2013 validation report by ADB\u2019s Independent \nEvaluation Department on the final review of the country partnership strategy for 2010\u20132012 \nstated that ADB contributed to inclusive social development through interventions that enhance \nrural connectivity.7  The report also identified a need for ADB to explore further technical support \nto strengthen the capacity of implementing agencies in the road sector. ADB\u2019s 2013 project \ncompletion report on its Road Network Project in Bhutan saw a need to provide continuous on-\nthe-job training opportunities and to institutionalize the use of the road asset management \nsystem. 8 Among the improvements required, the government must equip its officials with the \npractical skills needed to design roads with the necessary climate resilience and road safety \nstandards and to maintain them once they are built.  \n \n11.  The project and its outcome are consistent with the strategic objective set in ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 to assist the government in achieving broad-based \neconomic  growth  by  enhancing  the  main  road  network.9 The  project  also  supports  the \ngovernment\u2019s  plans  to  boost  international  and  regional  trade  and  to  promote  eco-friendly \ntransport on a pilot basis. The project is included in the Bhutan country operations business plan, \n2014\u20132016 and in the Regional Operations Business Plan: South Asia, 2014\u20132016.10 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The project\u2019s impact will be improved cross-border movement of goods between Bhutan \nand  neighboring  countries.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  road  connectivity  and  transport \nefficiency in the project areas in Bhutan. \n \nC.        Outputs \n13.  The  outputs  will  be  (i)  the  construction  of  roads  and  the  establishment  of  trade \ninfrastructure; (ii) the improvement of road construction and maintenance capacity; and (iii) the \n                                                \n5ADB. 2014.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n19.  Engineering.  The  engineering  design  is  based  on  site  condition  surveys  and  field \ninvestigations. It will optimize the construction works for economy and use proven technology \nand standard materials compatible with local conditions. Measures to support road safety and \nclimate resilience have been incorporated in the design for the new section of the SEWH. 13 \n \n20.  Operation  and  maintenance.  Four  agencies will  be  involved  in  the operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of the infrastructure to be constructed under the project: the Department of \nTrade for the mini dry port, the Department of Revenue and Customs for the mini dry port and \nthe Alay land custom station, Phuentsholing Thromde for the bypass road, and the Department \nof Roads (DOR) for the new section of the SEWH and the Pasakha access road. Efficient \ncustom clearance processes are being supported by an ADB-funded project (footnote 7) and \nassociated technical  assistance  projects (footnote  8)  that  will  build  institutional  capacity  to \npromote sustainability. To ensure that the road component remains sustainable, consultants \nrecruited under the project will help develop the skills and ability of the DOR and Phuentsholing \nThromde to manage the road assets and oversee the road safety and climate-resilience aspects \nof the project throughout construction. This will provide on-the-job training to a sizable number \nof government officials and thereby institutionalize the skills required in this areas.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  The economic assessment was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects.14 By constructing a new section of the SEWH and the Pasakha \naccess road, the project will reduce the travel time and vehicle operating costs of road users. \nConstruction of the mini dry port, land custom station, and the bypass road, in conjunction with \nthe opening of the Pasakha access road, will ease the traffic in Phuentsholing. The economic \ninternal rate of return for the project investment is estimated at 15.4%. Sensitivity analysis \nshowed that the project would remain economically viable in the event of a 10% increase in \ncost, a 10% reduction in benefits, or a 1-year delay in project completion. In the unlikely event \nthat all three of these risks occurred together, the economic internal rate of return would be \n11.7%, close to the 12.0% benchmark. \n \n22.  The financial sustainability of the O&M was assessed for each subproject. This showed \nthat expected revenues from the mini dry port will cover the O&M cost. Incremental recurrent \ncosts associated with the new section of the SEWH and the Pasakha access road to be built \nunder the project were estimated at 3.0% of the DOR\u2019s current O&M budget and at 0.2% of the \noverall DOR budget on an annual basis.  Recurrent costs associated with the bypass road to be \nconstructed in Phuentsholing were estimated to be 2% of its current budget. Since Bhutan\u2019s \ngovernment has committed to provide adequate funding for the O&M of the project roads, it is \nreasonable to expect that funds will be available to meet these costs. \n \nC.

The DOR has experience in ADB-financed projects as an executing agency \nand an implementing agency. Phuentsholing Thromde has not yet been an executing agency for \nan ADB-financed project. However, the Phuentsholing Thromde\u2019s technical staff are engineers \nwho have been assigned to it by the Department of Engineering Services, which has been the \nexecuting agency for infrastructure improvement projects financed by ADB.  \n \n24.  Financial management. An assessment of the accounting systems, financial reporting, \nand external audit procedures of the DOR and Phuentsholing Thromde concluded that their \nfinancial  management  systems  are  satisfactory.  The  accounting  and  reporting  process  in \nfinance and accounting manuals developed by the Ministry of Finance will be followed. The \nDOR and Phuentsholing Thromde use the government\u2019s standardized budget and accounting \nsystem, which has been computerized since 2003, produces satisfactory financial reports, and \nensures availability of data. Each project implementation unit of the DOR and Phuentsholing \nThromde will include a suitably qualified accountant. Each will maintain its separate project \nrecords and accounts to identify financing resources received and expenditures made for the \nproject and ensure an adequate audit trail. The Royal Audit Authority of Bhutan, an independent \nand nonpartisan institution authorized to perform audits on government agencies, will audit \nproject financial statements annually in accordance with international auditing standards.  \n \n25.  Procurement. The overall risk related to the procurement capacity of the DOR and \nPhuentsholing  Thromde  has  been  assessed  as  low.  Both  have  implemented  ADB-funded \nprojects and have procured works and consulting services under ADB guidelines. The Public \nProcurement Policy Division under the Ministry of Finance oversees public procurement under \nthe government\u2019s Procurement Rules and Regulations (2009). The division is mandated to \nrecommend reforms of the procurement policy or laws to the government, prepare standard \nbidding  documents,  issue  technical  guidelines  and  manuals  on  procurement,  liaise  with \ngovernment organizations to develop human resources and professionalism in procurement. \nThe  regulations  recognize  that  the  rules  and  procedures  on  procurement  of  development \npartners may prevail in projects funded by development partners.  \n \n26.  Anticorruption.    The  Anti-Corruption  Commission  is  empowered  under  the  Anti-\nCorruption Act of Bhutan of 2006 with the authority to prevent and combat corruption and to \ninvestigate acts of corruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government, the DOR, and Phuentsholing Thromde. The \nspecific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project \nadministration manual.15 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  Poverty reduction and social impact. Remoteness is the major cause of poverty in \nBhutan. The SEWH subproject will have direct benefits for the local population in the remote \nparts of the project area, including the poor and such vulnerable groups as households headed \nby  women.  The  SEWH  subproject  will  provide  improved  access  for  five  villages  that  are \ncurrently not connected by motorable roads. It is expected to improve the quality of life and \nbring new economic opportunities by giving these villages (i) easier access to external markets, \n(ii) increased retailing opportunities, and (iii) easier access to health care centers and education \nfacilities. People in the immediate and wider project influence area are expected to increase \ntheir incomes through sales of local produce at the roadside of the SEWH. The subproject will \nthereby significantly reduce poverty and improve livelihoods in the two beneficiary districts of \n                                                \n15 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nPema Gatshel and Samdrup Jongkhar.16  \n \n28.  Gender. A majority of the women respondents in a survey undertaken during the project \npreparation felt that the SEWH subproject would benefit them because it will enable them to \ntransport their yield to market and increase their incomes. The survey revealed no significant \ndiscrimination against women in Bhutan and indicated that rural women are becoming more \ninfluential in household decision making. It also revealed that women are frequently taking on \nadditional work to ensure a comfortable lifestyle for their families. Women may also benefit more \nthan men from the increased access to schools that the new road will provide. Women-only \nfacilities will be provided at the mini dry port subproject. The SEWH subproject will be built with \nsoft shoulders to provide walkways for pedestrians and small rest areas and platforms for selling \nlocal produce at suitable locations after consulting with the local communities. At least 50% of \nthose employed by the DOR for post-construction maintenance of the highway will be women. \nThe capacity building for the DOR and Phuentsholing Thromde will help mainstream gender-\nsensitive design in future projects. \n \n29.  HIV/AIDS,  human  trafficking,  and  labor.  The  National  Sexually  Transmitted \nDisease/AIDS Control Program is a multisector initiative involving all sections of society in \nBhutan and has been operating since 1988, assisted by bilateral and multilateral development \nagencies  and  the  United  Nations.  The  government  has  been  successful  in  carrying  out \nawareness campaigns and providing free health care to minimize the spread of HIV/AIDS in \nBhutan. The social assessments undertaken in the project area did reveal significant risks of \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking. However, the DOR will conduct sessions in the five newly \nconnected project villages to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, and health and \nhygiene matters. The DOR and Phuentsholing Thromde will also ensure that all civil works \ncontractors disseminate information to their workers at project sites on the risks of sexually \ntransmitted infections. Contracts for all subprojects will include specific clauses making this a \nrequirement, and compliance will be strictly monitored during implementation by the DOR and \nPhuentsholing Thromde, with the support of construction supervision consultants. The bidding \ndocuments  contain  provisions  requiring  that the  contractors  ensure that  all  the  civil  works \ncomply with core labor standards, including those banning child labor; bonded labor; work \ndiscrimination based on gender, race, and ethnicity; and restrictions on freedom of association \nand collective bargaining. \n  \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project is classified under \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) as category A for involuntary resettlement. The \nproject  was  designed  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement.  Two \nresettlement  plans  and  one  land  acquisition  due  diligence  report  have  been  prepared  in \naccordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement and Bhutan\u2019s Government Land Act 1979 \n(amended in 2007). A total of 25.73 hectare of private land will be required for the project, of \nwhich 25.42 hectare will be acquired for the SEWH subproject and 0.01 hectare for the Pasakha \naccess  road,  using  the  land-for-land  or  cash-for-land  compensation  methods.  Another  0.3 \nhectare will be donated voluntarily for the bypass subproject. A total of 206 households and 12 \nstructures will be affected. Eight households will be displaced physically, and 206 households \nwill experience economic displacement. Of the latter, 50 households will lose 10% or more of \ntheir productive assets. The displaced households will be entitled to compensation for the loss \nof land and structures at replacement cost or to a substitute plot of similar quality, as well as \n                                                \n16 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nshifting costs and other income restoration assistance. Resettlement is estimated to cost about \n$0.6 million. Both the DOR and Phuentsholing Thromde are experienced in land acquisition and \nland pooling and are currently implementing ADB-financed projects. The preparatory study did \nnot identify any impact on indigenous peoples, and the project is category C in this regard. \n \n31.  Environment. The project is classified as category A for the environment. The new \nsection of the SEWH is category A, since 50.0 km of its overall 68.3 km of new road will be built \nthrough  dense  forests  and  critical  wildlife  habitat  areas.  The  subprojects  to  construct  the \nPasakha access road, the bypass road, the land customs station, and the mini dry port are \ncategory B. The activities for the eco-friendly transport promotion output, which involve only \ndesign  and  procurement  activities,  are  classified  as  category  C.  An  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA) has been prepared for the new section of the SEWH. The draft EIA was \ndisclosed on the ADB website on 2 December 2013. Three initial environmental examination \nreports have been prepared for the other four subprojects and disclosed on the ADB website. \nThese assessment reports were prepared in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement \nrequirements. Significant environmental issues are expected to arise from the building of the \nnew stretch of the SEWH: the construction will pass through elephant corridors, involve the \nremoval of a large number of trees and vegetation, increase the risks of poaching and illegal \ntrade of wildlife by improving access to these areas, and present long-term issues of noise and \npollution. The detailed design adjusted the road alignment to avoid passing through some \ncritical  wildlife  habitat  areas.  In  sections  where  this  was  unavoidable,  measures  and \nrecommended mitigation actions have been incorporated in the engineering designs to facilitate \nelephant movement across the road and ensure no net loss of biodiversity. Measures to control \nthe illegal trade of wildlife products in the project area are also included in the environmental \nmanagement plan. Other typical environmental impacts of road construction are air, dust, and \nnoise pollution; soil erosion and siltation; the generation of construction waste and waste from \nconstruction camps; and occupational health and safety issues. Steps to mitigate these impacts \nhave been included in the environmental management plan to be attached to the bidding \ndocuments. Meaningful consultations were held with persons who will be affected during various \nstages of the project, as well as with such other key stakeholders as the Wildlife Conservation \nDivision of the Department of Forests, the local governments in the project area, and the \nNational Environment Commission. Concerns of affected persons and stakeholders will be \naddressed during project implementation through a grievance redress mechanism proposed in \nthe EIA. \n \n32.  The  environmental  capacity  of  the  DOR  and  Phuentsholing  Thromde  will  be \nstrengthened during project implementation. An environmental focal person will be appointed in \nthe project implementation unit of each subproject. These focal persons will be supported by an \nenvironmental specialist engaged as part of the project consulting services. A wildlife specialist \nwill  be  appointed  to  act  as  a  technical  advisor  and  external  monitor  for  the  biodiversity \nenhancement  activities  of  the  SEWH  subproject.  The  project  will  further  enhance  the \nenvironmental capacity of the DOR and Phuentsholing Thromde through the procurement of \nequipment and training in collecting air, noise, and water quality data. Technical guidance and \non-the-job training will be provided by the environmental specialist and wildlife specialist or ADB \nduring project implementation, as necessary. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.17 The integrated benefits and impacts are \n                                                \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nCoordination between the relevant  A steering committee representing all the project-related government \nministries and project executing  institutions will be formed for project implementation, and regular \nagencies could be inadequate.  meetings will be held twice a year. \nProject  implementation  could  be  Detailed designs for the national highway section and the Pasakha \ndelayed.  access road subprojects have been completed, and advance \ncontracting is being conducted.
