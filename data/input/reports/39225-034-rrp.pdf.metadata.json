The  project  will  also  improve  Bhutan\u2019s  national  road  network  in  remote  areas  in \nthe southeastern part of Bhutan near the border with India, providing people in that region with \nbetter  access  to  economic  opportunities  and  social  services.  The  project  will  thereby  support \nefficient and safe transport of goods within Bhutan and to and from neighboring countries. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nLandlocked  Bhutan  faces  unique  development  challenges  and  opportunities.  The \n3. \ncountry\u2019s  small  population  of  about  720,000  is  dispersed  throughout  its  mostly  mountainous \nterrain.2 The  country  is  also  vulnerable  to  moderate-to-high  seismic  risks.  This  and  formidable \nweather conditions make it difficult to achieve economy of scale in delivering services and costly \nto build and maintain vital infrastructure, particularly roads. Bordered by India in the east, west, \nand  south,  Bhutan  is  heavily  reliant  on  its  much  larger  neighbor  for  international  trade.  India \naccounts for 84% of its exports, including electricity; and 73% of its imports.3 However, Bhutan\u2019s \ninadequate  cross-border  road  network  and  infrastructure  are  hampering  its  international  trade \nand logistics. It is important to lower high transport costs and improve poor accessibility, to spur \nthe country\u2019s economic and social development.  \n \nRoads are the main mode of passenger and freight transport within the country and with \n4. \nneighboring  states  in  India.  The  current  network  comprises  about  10,577  kilometers  (km)  of \nroads,  divided  into  six  major  classes:  (i)  2,438  km  of  national  highways,  (ii)  6  km  of \nexpressways,  (iii)  1,178  km  of feeder  roads,  (iv) 350  km  of  urban roads, (v)  5,375 km  of farm \nroads, and (vi) 1,230 km of access roads. Of this network, 93% of all national highways, 90% of \nurban  roads,  and  20%  of  feeder  and  access  roads  are  sealed.  However,  use  of  the  sealed \nnetwork  becomes  difficult  during  the  rainy  season  because  narrow  roads  along  steep  hillsides \nare  prone  to  landslides. The feeder  and farm  road  network  expanded  significantly  since  2000, \nand  201  of  the  country\u2019s  205  blocks  of  villages  were  connected  by  motorable  roads  in  2013. \nHowever, an estimated 20% of rural people still need to travel more than 1 hour to have access \nto  essential  services.  Connecting  people  to  the  national  highway  network  will  further  improve \nthis accessibility. \n \n5. \nThe  national  highways  are  the  main  arteries  in  the  road  network.  The  Northern  East\u2013\nWest Highway (553 km) passes through the center of the country and links Thimphu, which is \nthe  capital  city  of  Bhutan,  with  the  central  and  eastern  regions.  Several  north\u2013south  national \nhighways  run  between  points  on  the  border  with  India  and  the  Northern  East-West  Highway. \nThese  include  the  main  access  highway  between  Thimphu  and  Phuentsholing,  the  largest \nborder city with India. The Southern East\u2013West Highway (SEWH) will run for 717 km along the \n\n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 ADB. 2013. Basic Statistics 2013. Manila. \n3 Bhutan\u2019s  international  sea  trade  currently  moves  through  Kolkata  Port  in  India.  Chittagong  Port  in  Bangladesh  is \n\nexpected to become an alternative port in the future. \n\n\f2 \n\nborder  with  India  in  the  south  when  it  is  complete,  but  only  185  km  has  been  built  so  far. \nAnother  194 km  is  under  construction.  Completion  of the  SEWH  is  critical. Transport  between \neast and west in the country\u2019s south now often involves roundabout routes, either further south \nvia India or through a long indirect journey using the Northern East\u2013West Highway to the north. \nThis constrains economic and social development in the southeastern parts of Bhutan that are \npoorer  than  most  other  regions,  as  well  as  in  places  along  the  border  with  India  that  have \nindustrial  estates  and  cross-border  facilities.  Building  a  national  highway  connection  to \nNganglam and Samdrup Jongkhar is important to developing southeastern Bhutan. \n\n \n6. \nThe  main  crossing  points  between  Bhutan  and  India  are  at  Phuentsholing,  Gelephu, \nNganglam, and Samdrup Jongkhar. These border crossings connect Bhutan\u2019s main north\u2013south \nhighways  with  India\u2019s  national  highway  network.  Phuentsholing,  in  the  west,  is  the  busiest, \naccounting  for  40%  of  the  passenger  vehicles,  55%  of  the  trucks,  and  28%  of  the  buses \ncrossing between Bhutan and India each day. The inadequacy of the border facilities in dealing \nwith this traffic causes heavy congestion in the city and is a constraint on trade through the city. \nAbout  26%  of  the  cross-border  traffic  at  Phuentsholing  carries  materials  and  products  to  and \nfrom  the  Pasakha  industrial  estate,  located  15  km  to  the  east.  Provision  of  direct  access \nbetween the Pasakha industrial estate and India, a mini dry port in Phuentsholing, and a bypass \nroad  between  a  mini  dry  port  and  a  national  highway  will  reduce  the  transport  costs  for  this \nfreight  and  increase  the  movement  of  goods,  which  would  in  turn  improve  Bhutan\u2019s  trade \ncompetitiveness. \n \n7. \nThe  government\u2019s  strategic  thrusts  under  the  country\u2019s  11th  five-year  plan  for  2013\u2013\n2018  are inclusive social development, accelerated green economic development, and strategic \ninfrastructure  development.  4 The  main  aim  in  the  transport  sector  is  to  ensure  safe,  efficient, \nand  reliable  services.  Improving  efficiency  in  the  sector  will  boost  domestic  and  cross-border \ntrade  and  allow  better  delivery  and  wider  coverage  of  basic  social  services.  The  government \nalso  plans  to  promote  eco-friendly  transport.  This  will  include  the  introduction  of  clean-energy \nvehicles. \n \n8. \n The five-year plan\u2019s top priority is to finish the construction and upgrading of the entire \nlength of the SEWH by the end of the plan period, which will cost almost $122 million, or about \n54%  of  the  capital  expenditures  in  the  road  sector  under  the  plan.  Together  with  planned \nimprovement of the border trade facilities, this will remove the inefficiencies at international land \nborder  crossings,  improve  domestic  and  international  trade,  and  make  the  country\u2019s  remote \nsoutheastern communities more accessible.  \n  \n9. \nIn  2001,  ADB  supported  the  establishment  of  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic \nCooperation  (SASEC)  between  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  and  Nepal.  During  a  series  of \nmeetings of the SASEC transport working group, the members made it a priority for Bhutan to \ndevelop  a  mini  dry  port  in  Phuentsholing  and  a  direct  access  road  between  the  Pasakha \nindustrial  estate  and  India.  The  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  Road \nConnectivity Project will improve one of the most important segments of the SASEC corridor 2 \nand  is  one  of  the  projects  aimed  at  strengthening  road  connectivity  along  SASEC  corridors  4 \nand 8 and in adjoining areas. ADB-supported SASEC road connectivity investment program for \nIndia includes 126 km of Asian Highway 48, which connects Jaigaon City on India\u2019s border with \n\n                                                \n4 Government  of  Bhutan.

Thimphu. \n\n \n\n\fBhutan with Changrabandha City on its border with Bangladesh.5 To enhance the effectiveness \nof  transport  infrastructure  initiatives  in  the  SASEC  subregion,  ADB  is  implementing  a  trade \nfacilitation program loan and grant project and four technical assistance projects in Bangladesh, \nBhutan,  and  Nepal.6 These  will  support  efficient,  secure  cross-border  trade  processes  in  the \nsubregion  and  include  the  development  of  modern,  effective  customs  administration  and \nstreamlined,  transparent  trade  procedures.  These  projects  will  help  Bhutan  comply  with  the \nRevised Kyoto Convention standards to simplify and harmonize customs procedures. \n \nBhutan  has  depended  on  external  assistance  to  develop  its  road  network,  mainly  from \n10. \nADB,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  governments  of  Austria,  India,  Japan,  the  Netherlands,  and \nSwitzerland. ADB\u2019s contribution so far has been 7 loans and grants and 17 technical assistance \nprojects,  including  7  to  prepare  projects.  The  2013  validation  report  by  ADB\u2019s  Independent \nEvaluation  Department  on  the  final  review  of  the  country  partnership  strategy  for  2010\u20132012 \nstated that ADB contributed to inclusive social development through interventions that enhance \nrural connectivity.7  The report also identified a need for ADB to explore further technical support \nto  strengthen  the  capacity  of  implementing  agencies  in  the  road  sector.  ADB\u2019s  2013  project \ncompletion report on its Road Network Project in Bhutan saw a need to provide continuous on-\nthe-job  training  opportunities  and  to  institutionalize  the  use  of  the  road  asset  management \nsystem.  8 Among  the  improvements  required,  the  government  must  equip  its  officials  with  the \npractical  skills  needed  to  design  roads  with  the  necessary  climate  resilience  and  road  safety \nstandards and to maintain them once they are built.  \n \n11. \nThe  project  and  its  outcome  are  consistent  with  the  strategic  objective  set  in  ADB\u2019s \ncountry  partnership  strategy,  2014\u20132018  to  assist  the  government  in  achieving  broad-based \neconomic  growth  by  enhancing  the  main  road  network. 9  The  project  also  supports  the \ngovernment\u2019s  plans  to  boost  international  and  regional  trade  and  to  promote  eco-friendly \ntransport on a pilot basis. The project is included in the Bhutan country operations business plan, \n2014\u20132016 and in the Regional Operations Business Plan: South Asia, 2014\u20132016.10 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n12. \nThe project\u2019s impact will be improved cross-border movement of goods between Bhutan \nand  neighboring  countries.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  road  connectivity  and  transport \nefficiency in the project areas in Bhutan. \n \nC.

It  will  optimize  the  construction  works  for  economy  and  use  proven  technology \nand  standard  materials  compatible  with  local  conditions.  Measures  to  support  road  safety  and \nclimate resilience have been incorporated in the design for the new section of the SEWH. 13 \n \nOperation  and  maintenance.  Four  agencies  will  be  involved  in  the  operation  and \n20. \nmaintenance (O&M) of the infrastructure to be constructed under the project: the Department of \nTrade for the mini dry port, the Department of Revenue and Customs for the mini dry port and \nthe Alay land custom station, Phuentsholing Thromde for the bypass road, and the Department \nof  Roads  (DOR)  for  the  new  section  of  the  SEWH  and  the  Pasakha  access  road.  Efficient \ncustom  clearance  processes  are  being  supported  by  an  ADB-funded  project  (footnote  7)  and \nassociated  technical  assistance  projects  (footnote  8)  that  will  build  institutional  capacity  to \npromote  sustainability.  To  ensure  that  the  road  component  remains  sustainable,  consultants \nrecruited under the project will help develop the skills and ability of the DOR and Phuentsholing \nThromde to manage the road assets and oversee the road safety and climate-resilience aspects \nof the project throughout construction. This will provide on-the-job training to a sizable number \nof government officials and thereby institutionalize the skills required in this areas.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nThe economic assessment was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects.14 By constructing a new section of the SEWH and the Pasakha \naccess  road,  the  project  will  reduce  the  travel  time  and  vehicle  operating  costs  of  road  users. \nConstruction of the mini dry port, land custom station, and the bypass road, in conjunction with \nthe  opening  of  the  Pasakha access road,  will  ease  the traffic  in  Phuentsholing. The economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  for  the  project  investment  is  estimated  at  15.4%.  Sensitivity  analysis \nshowed  that  the  project  would  remain  economically  viable  in  the  event  of  a  10%  increase  in \ncost, a 10% reduction in benefits, or a 1-year delay in project completion. In the unlikely event \nthat  all  three  of  these  risks  occurred  together,  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  would  be \n11.7%, close to the 12.0% benchmark. \n \n22. \nThe financial sustainability of the O&M was assessed for each subproject. This showed \nthat  expected  revenues  from  the  mini  dry  port  will  cover  the  O&M  cost.  Incremental  recurrent \ncosts  associated  with  the  new  section  of  the  SEWH  and  the  Pasakha  access  road  to  be  built \nunder the project were estimated at 3.0% of the DOR\u2019s current O&M budget and at 0.2% of the \noverall DOR budget on an annual basis.  Recurrent costs associated with the bypass road to be \nconstructed  in  Phuentsholing  were  estimated  to  be  2%  of  its  current  budget.  Since  Bhutan\u2019s \ngovernment has committed to provide adequate funding for the O&M of the project roads, it is \nreasonable to expect that funds will be available to meet these costs. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n23. \nInstitutional  capacity.  The  DOR  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  project\u2019s  SEWH \nand  Pasakha  access  road  components,  and  Phuentsholing  Thromde  will  be  the  executing \n\n                                                \n13 ADB.  2013.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fagency for establishing the mini dry port, the Alay land custom station, and the bypass road in \nPhuentsholing City. The DOR has experience in ADB-financed projects as an executing agency \nand an implementing agency. Phuentsholing Thromde has not yet been an executing agency for \nan ADB-financed project. However, the Phuentsholing Thromde\u2019s technical staff are engineers \nwho have been assigned to it by the Department of Engineering Services, which has been the \nexecuting agency for infrastructure improvement projects financed by ADB.  \n \n24. \nFinancial management. An assessment of the accounting systems, financial reporting, \nand  external  audit  procedures  of  the  DOR  and  Phuentsholing  Thromde  concluded  that  their \nfinancial  management  systems  are  satisfactory.  The  accounting  and  reporting  process  in \nfinance  and  accounting  manuals  developed  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  followed.  The \nDOR  and  Phuentsholing  Thromde  use  the  government\u2019s  standardized  budget  and  accounting \nsystem, which has been computerized since 2003, produces satisfactory financial reports, and \nensures  availability  of  data.  Each  project  implementation  unit  of  the  DOR  and  Phuentsholing \nThromde  will  include  a  suitably  qualified  accountant.  Each  will  maintain  its  separate  project \nrecords  and  accounts  to  identify  financing  resources  received  and  expenditures  made  for  the \nproject and ensure an adequate audit trail. The Royal Audit Authority of Bhutan, an independent \nand  nonpartisan  institution  authorized  to  perform  audits  on  government  agencies,  will  audit \nproject financial statements annually in accordance with international auditing standards.  \n \nProcurement.  The  overall  risk  related  to  the  procurement  capacity  of  the  DOR  and \n25. \nPhuentsholing  Thromde  has  been  assessed  as  low.  Both  have  implemented  ADB-funded \nprojects  and  have  procured  works  and  consulting  services  under  ADB  guidelines.  The  Public \nProcurement Policy Division under the Ministry of Finance oversees public procurement under \nthe  government\u2019s  Procurement  Rules  and  Regulations  (2009).  The  division  is  mandated  to \nrecommend  reforms  of  the  procurement  policy  or  laws  to  the  government,  prepare  standard \nbidding  documents,  issue  technical  guidelines  and  manuals  on  procurement,  liaise  with \ngovernment  organizations  to  develop  human  resources  and  professionalism  in  procurement. \nThe  regulations  recognize  that  the  rules  and  procedures  on  procurement  of  development \npartners may prevail in projects funded by development partners.  \n \n26. \nAnticorruption.    The  Anti-Corruption  Commission  is  empowered  under  the  Anti-\nCorruption  Act  of  Bhutan  of  2006  with  the  authority  to  prevent  and  combat  corruption  and  to \ninvestigate  acts  of  corruption.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  the  DOR,  and  Phuentsholing  Thromde.  The \nspecific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project \nadministration manual.15 \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nPoverty  reduction  and  social  impact.  Remoteness  is  the  major  cause  of  poverty  in \n27. \nBhutan.  The  SEWH  subproject  will  have  direct  benefits  for  the  local  population  in  the  remote \nparts of the project area, including the poor and such vulnerable groups as households headed \nby  women.  The  SEWH  subproject  will  provide  improved  access  for  five  villages  that  are \ncurrently  not  connected  by  motorable  roads.  It  is  expected  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  and \nbring new economic opportunities by giving these villages (i) easier access to external markets, \n(ii) increased retailing opportunities, and (iii) easier access to health care centers and education \nfacilities.  People  in  the  immediate  and  wider  project  influence  area  are  expected  to  increase \ntheir incomes through sales of local produce at the roadside of the SEWH. The subproject will \nthereby  significantly  reduce  poverty  and  improve  livelihoods  in  the  two  beneficiary  districts  of \n                                                \n15 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fHIV/AIDS,  human  trafficking,  and \n\nPema Gatshel and Samdrup Jongkhar.16  \n \n28. \nGender. A majority of the women respondents in a survey undertaken during the project \npreparation  felt  that  the  SEWH  subproject  would  benefit  them  because  it  will  enable  them  to \ntransport  their  yield  to  market  and  increase  their  incomes.  The  survey  revealed  no  significant \ndiscrimination  against  women  in  Bhutan  and  indicated  that  rural  women  are  becoming  more \ninfluential  in  household  decision  making.  It  also  revealed  that  women  are  frequently  taking  on \nadditional work to ensure a comfortable lifestyle for their families. Women may also benefit more \nthan  men  from  the  increased  access  to  schools  that  the  new  road  will  provide.  Women-only \nfacilities will be provided at the mini dry port subproject. The SEWH subproject will be built with \nsoft shoulders to provide walkways for pedestrians and small rest areas and platforms for selling \nlocal produce at suitable locations after consulting with the local communities. At least 50% of \nthose employed by the DOR for post-construction maintenance of the highway  will be women. \nThe  capacity  building  for  the  DOR  and  Phuentsholing  Thromde  will  help  mainstream  gender-\nsensitive design in future projects. \n \nlabor.  The  National  Sexually  Transmitted \n29. \nDisease/AIDS  Control  Program  is  a  multisector  initiative  involving  all  sections  of  society  in \nBhutan and has been operating since 1988, assisted by bilateral and multilateral development \nagencies  and  the  United  Nations.  The  government  has  been  successful  in  carrying  out \nawareness  campaigns  and  providing  free  health  care  to  minimize  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  in \nBhutan.  The  social  assessments  undertaken  in  the  project  area  did  reveal  significant  risks  of \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking.  However,  the  DOR  will  conduct  sessions  in  the  five  newly \nconnected  project  villages  to  raise  awareness  of  HIV/AIDS,  human  trafficking,  and  health  and \nhygiene  matters.  The  DOR  and  Phuentsholing  Thromde  will  also  ensure  that  all  civil  works \ncontractors  disseminate  information  to  their  workers  at  project  sites  on  the  risks  of  sexually \ntransmitted  infections.  Contracts  for  all  subprojects  will  include  specific  clauses  making  this  a \nrequirement,  and  compliance  will  be  strictly  monitored  during  implementation  by  the  DOR  and \nPhuentsholing  Thromde,  with  the  support  of  construction  supervision  consultants.  The  bidding \ndocuments  contain  provisions  requiring  that  the  contractors  ensure  that  all  the  civil  works \ncomply  with  core  labor  standards,  including  those  banning  child  labor;  bonded  labor;  work \ndiscrimination based on gender, race, and ethnicity; and restrictions on freedom of association \nand collective bargaining. \n  \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  under \n30. \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  as  category  A  for  involuntary  resettlement.  The \nproject  was  designed  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement.  Two \nresettlement  plans  and  one  land  acquisition  due  diligence  report  have  been  prepared  in \naccordance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  Bhutan\u2019s  Government  Land  Act  1979 \n(amended  in  2007).  A  total  of  25.73  hectare  of  private  land  will  be  required  for  the  project,  of \nwhich 25.42 hectare will be acquired for the SEWH subproject and 0.01 hectare for the Pasakha \naccess  road,  using  the  land-for-land  or  cash-for-land  compensation  methods.  Another  0.3 \nhectare will be donated voluntarily for the bypass subproject. A total of 206 households and 12 \nstructures  will  be  affected.  Eight  households  will  be  displaced  physically,  and  206  households \nwill  experience  economic  displacement.  Of  the  latter,  50  households  will  lose  10%  or  more  of \ntheir productive assets. The displaced households will be entitled to compensation for the loss \nof  land  and  structures  at  replacement  cost  or  to  a  substitute  plot  of  similar  quality,  as  well  as \n\n                                                \n16 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fshifting costs and other income restoration assistance. Resettlement is estimated to cost about \n$0.6 million. Both the DOR and Phuentsholing Thromde are experienced in land acquisition and \nland pooling and are currently implementing ADB-financed projects. The preparatory study did \nnot identify any impact on indigenous peoples, and the project is category C in this regard. \n\n \n31. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  A  for  the  environment.  The  new \nsection of the SEWH is category A, since 50.0 km of its overall 68.3 km of new road will be built \nthrough  dense  forests  and  critical  wildlife  habitat  areas.  The  subprojects  to  construct  the \nPasakha  access  road,  the  bypass  road,  the  land  customs  station,  and  the  mini  dry  port  are \ncategory  B.  The  activities  for  the  eco-friendly  transport  promotion  output,  which  involve  only \ndesign  and  procurement  activities,  are  classified  as  category  C.  An  environmental  impact \nassessment  (EIA)  has  been  prepared  for  the  new  section  of  the  SEWH.  The  draft  EIA  was \ndisclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  2  December  2013.  Three  initial  environmental  examination \nreports  have  been  prepared for the  other four  subprojects  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website. \nThese  assessment reports  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nrequirements.  Significant  environmental  issues  are  expected  to  arise  from  the  building  of  the \nnew  stretch  of  the  SEWH:  the  construction  will  pass  through  elephant  corridors,  involve  the \nremoval  of  a  large  number  of  trees  and  vegetation,  increase  the  risks  of  poaching  and  illegal \ntrade of wildlife by improving access to these areas, and present long-term issues of noise and \npollution.  The  detailed  design  adjusted  the  road  alignment  to  avoid  passing  through  some \ncritical  wildlife  habitat  areas.  In  sections  where  this  was  unavoidable,  measures  and \nrecommended mitigation actions have been incorporated in the engineering designs to facilitate \nelephant movement across the road and ensure no net loss of biodiversity. Measures to control \nthe  illegal  trade  of  wildlife  products  in  the  project  area  are  also  included  in  the  environmental \nmanagement  plan.  Other  typical  environmental  impacts  of  road construction  are  air,  dust,  and \nnoise pollution; soil erosion and siltation; the generation of construction waste and waste from \nconstruction camps; and occupational health and safety issues. Steps to mitigate these impacts \nhave  been  included  in  the  environmental  management  plan  to  be  attached  to  the  bidding \ndocuments. Meaningful consultations were held with persons who will be affected during various \nstages of the project, as well as with such other key stakeholders as the Wildlife Conservation \nDivision  of  the  Department  of  Forests,  the  local  governments  in  the  project  area,  and  the \nNational  Environment  Commission.  Concerns  of  affected  persons  and  stakeholders  will  be \naddressed during project implementation through a grievance redress mechanism proposed in \nthe EIA. \n \n32. \nthe  DOR  and  Phuentsholing  Thromde  will  be \nstrengthened during project implementation. An environmental focal person will be appointed in \nthe project implementation unit of each subproject. These focal persons will be supported by an \nenvironmental specialist engaged as part of the project consulting services. A wildlife specialist \nwill  be  appointed  to  act  as  a  technical  advisor  and  external  monitor  for  the  biodiversity \nenhancement  activities  of  the  SEWH  subproject.  The  project  will  further  enhance  the \nenvironmental  capacity  of  the  DOR  and  Phuentsholing  Thromde  through  the  procurement  of \nequipment and training in collecting air, noise, and water quality data. Technical guidance and \non-the-job training will be provided by the environmental specialist and wildlife specialist or ADB \nduring project implementation, as necessary. \n \nF. \n\nThe  environmental  capacity  of \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33.
