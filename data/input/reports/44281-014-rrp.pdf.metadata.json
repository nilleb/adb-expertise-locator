The additional scope will result in \nthe overall project rehabilitating 37.5 km of paved roads and 8.5 km of unpaved feeder roads on \nSouth  Tarawa.2 The  additional  road  sections  will  complement  the  current  project  by  ensuring \nconsistent road quality throughout the entire South Tarawa road network. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nBackground.  Kiribati  is  a  small,  remote  country  consisting  of  33  of  dispersed  islands \nover 3.5 million square km of ocean. Tarawa, the capital of Kiribati, has a population of 56,300 \n(55%  of  the  total  country  population)  and  an  average  population  density  of  4,000  persons  per \nsquare  km.3 The  communities  on  this  island  are  linked  to  each  other,  and  the  international \nairport,  by  a  single  main  paved  road  and  three  causeways  that  run  from  east  to  west.  Urban \ndevelopment along the main road corridor, particularly in the far west in the main urban center \nof Betio, provides opportunities for cash employment and access to essential social services. \n \n4. \nCurrent  project. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a project ADF loan on \n20  December  2010  in  the  amount  of  SDR7,621,000  ($12  million)  for  the  Road  Rehabilitation \nProject. In 2015, ADB provided additional financing in the form of an ADF grant in the amount of \n$2.4  million.  The  current  project  (i.e.,  the  original  project  and  the  first  additional  financing) \nsought to significantly improve people\u2019s lives by rehabilitating the South Tarawa road network, \nwhich in 2010 was acknowledged to have served its economic life. The road network serves the \nhabitable  part  of  the  atoll,  which  is  generally  no  more  than  100  meters  wide,  with  most  of  the \npopulation living, working, or studying in buildings that line both sides of the road. \n \n5. \nThere is strong collaboration between the cofinanciers and the government to deliver the \nproject, with project cofinancing at $66.16 million inclusive of ADB\u2019s share. The current project \nhas  received  $26.97  million  of  cofinancing  from  the  World  Bank,  $15.21  million  from  the \nGovernment  of  Australia  through  the  Pacific  Region  Infrastructure  Facility,  and  $3.65  million \nfrom the Government of Australia through the Australia\u2013Pacific Islands Partnership Trust Fund.4 \nThe government\u2019s contribution has increased from $1.05 million in 2010 to $5.93 million in 2015. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB.  2010.

Manila. \n\n3  Government of Kiribati. 2016. 2015 Population and Housing Census Preliminary Report. Tarawa. \n4  On  31  January  2011,  the  World  Bank  increased  its  financing  from  $16  million  to  $20  million.  In  addition  the \nGovernment of Australia through the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility increased its financing from $4.61 million \nto $5.79 million as a result of including an additional 5 km of paved road and 2 km of unpaved road. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe  current  project  is  in  line  with  the  development  objectives  set  out  in  the  Kiribati \n6. \nDevelopment  Plan,  2016\u20132019,  which  seeks  to  (i)  achieve  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction;  and  (ii)  create  a  sustainable  environment,  and  sustainable  governance  and \ninfrastructure.5 The  additional  financing  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business \nplan, 2017\u20132019 for Kiribati; ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020, which serves as the country \npartnership  strategy;  and  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020.6 The  current  project  also \nsupports  the  government\u2019s  efforts  in  the  draft  Transport  Sector  Development  Plan  2016  to  (i) \nserve mobility and accessibility needs; and (ii) provide reliable, safe, and economically efficient \ntransport  as  priorities  for  improving  economic  development.7 South  Tarawa  has  41.6  km  of \npaved roads and approximately 40 km of unpaved roads that support access to most areas in \nBetio,  Bairiki,  Bikenibeu,  and  Buota.  Prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  project,  inadequate \nroutine  road  and  drainage  maintenance,  prolonged  wet  weather,  and  heavy  traffic  volumes \ncontributed to the rapid deterioration of the road network in South Tarawa. \n \n7. \nThe first additional financing, approved in 2015 (footnote 2), was necessary to help meet \nthe financing gap identified with the civil works contract due to (i) underestimated base costs at \nthe design stage, (ii) implementation delays that further introduced material escalation costs, (iii) \nexchange rate fluctuations effects, and (iv) increased transport costs.8 The government and the \ncontractor agreed on overall costs for the current work scope totaling A$59 million inclusive of \nall  claims,  variations,  currency  fluctuations,  and  extensions.  The  request  for  the  second \nadditional financing is to scale up the road network links by constructing an additional 7.8 km of \npaved main roads and 0.5 km of unpaved feeder roads to cover additional geographic areas in \nBetio and Bairiki that will be linked to the current project. \n \nCurrent project performance. Progress on project implementation since the civil works \n8. \ncontractor  mobilized  in  July  2013,  has  advanced  satisfactorily  despite  the  initial  procurement \ndelays. As of October 2016, physical progress is at 96% with 97% elapsed time. As of the third \nquarter  of  2016,  the  current  project  was  classified  as  performing  well.  The  following  aspects \nhave been assessed:  \n\n(i) \n\nDelivery of expected outputs. \n(a) \n\nOutput  1.  Coastal  protection  works;  35.7  km  of  pavements  with  road \nsafety features, including speed bumps, street lighting, and road signage; \nand  more  than  50  km  of  footpaths  are  complete.  Extreme  weather \ndamaged  the  Betio  causeway  rock  armor,  resulting  in  deletion  of  the \ncauseway  pavement  works. 9 The  road  sector  reforms  are  progressing \nwell with the completion of the road safety action plan and the preparation \nof draft traffic legislation. \n\n                                                 \n5  Government of Kiribati. 2016.

The contract was signed on 12 February 2013 and the start date was 1 July 2013. The procurement \ncontract summary sheet created at the time of contract award was for $7.59 million, to align with ADB\u2019s allocation \nof the loan proceeds. \n\n9   On  26  July  2016,  the  government  signed  a  grant  agreement  with  the  Government  of  Japan,  through  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, for the reconstruction of Nippon causeway project for $35.8 million. The current \nproject\u2019s  civil  works  contractor  has  completed  pavement  of  0.4  km  along  the  western  approach  of  the  Betio \n(Nippon) causeway and carried out repair works to keep the length of the causeway accessible. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fis \n\nfor \n\nfinalizing  contracts \n\nOutput  2.

The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Utilities  (MPWU) \nrecruited a technical advisor to monitor project implementation. In addition, \nthe  Kiribati  Fiduciary  Services  Unit  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and \nEconomic  Development  provides  project  coordination  and  fiduciary  and \nprocurement support. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nSatisfactory  implementation  progress.  The  World  Bank  administers  the \nongoing  jointly  funded  civil  works  contract.  The  contract  for  the  design  and \nsupervision consultant, fully funded by ADB, was awarded on 2 December 2010 \nfor  $2.15  million.  As  of  September  2016,  the  total  contract  amount  was  $5.76 \nmillion,  including  variations  related  to  additional  design  inputs,  additional \nconstruction  supervision  inputs,  and  environmental  monitoring.  As  of  October \n2016, ADB had disbursed 96% of ADF loan funds ($10.83 million) and 100% of \nADF grant funds ($2.4 million). \nSatisfactory  compliance  with  safeguard  policy  requirements.  Compliance \nwith World Bank, ADB, and national safeguard policy requirements and plans is \nsatisfactory. No major issues have arisen to date.10 \nSuccessful  management  of  risks. The project has successfully managed and \nmitigated  the  risks  identified  during  processing  and  implementation.  Regular \ncoordination meetings with the Public Utilities Board and project stakeholders will \ncontinue to take place to monitor and address any implementation risks. \nOn  track  rating.  The  project  is  rated  on  track  and  has  performed  consistently \nwell since November 2014. \n\n \n9. \nProposed additional scope. This second proposal for additional financing is to scale up \nthe road network links by rehabilitating an additional 7.8 km of paved main roads and 0.5 km of \nunpaved feeder roads to cover the additional geographic areas in Betio and Bairiki that will be \nlinked to the current project. The additional scope and associated costs is considered necessary \nto ensure that the project development objectives are met. The provision of additional financing \nwould  also  enable  the  existing  civil  works  contractor  to  undertake  the  remaining  works  in  a \ntimely  and  cost-effective  manner,  as the time  and  cost to mobilize  a  new  contractor  in  Kiribati \nare significant. \n \n10. \nThe  road  sections  in  Betio  and  Bairiki  road  sections,  proposed  for  the  additional \nfinancing,  were  in  good  condition  at  the  project  scoping  stage  in  2010.  Since  then,  poor \ndrainage, inadequate road maintenance, and extreme wet weather during 2015 and early 2016 \nhave  caused  these  road  sections  to  deteriorate  to  very  poor  condition.  The  government, \ntherefore, decided to improve these road sections to enhance access to employment, markets, \nand services. \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n10 The cofinanciers entered into a Memorandum of Understanding dated 5 March 2012, which provides guidance on \nthe  cofinanciers  cooperation,  coordination  and  sharing  of  information,  particularly  on  the  review  of  procurement \nprocesses, as well as safeguard requirements to ensure mutual agreement on project-related matters. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fRetroactive  financing. In June 2016, Cabinet approved the MPWU submission for the \n11. \nadditional work and authorized the use of its own funds as bridge financing to cover costs until \nadditional  financing  from  a  donor  was  confirmed.  Following  Cabinet\u2019s  decision,  the  Ministry  of \nFinance and Economic Development requested ADB that $9 million of the Asian Development \nFund (ADF) grant resources be brought forward from 2017\u20132018 to 2016 to provide additional \nfinancing for the rehabilitation of the damaged road sections in Betio and Bairiki. As the current \nproject  implementation  was  near  completion,  the  government  authorized  the  additional  works \nusing  its  own funds,  before  ADB  could confirm the  ability  to  bring forward  the  ADF  resources. \nThe  government  decision  was  made  on  the  consideration  that  a  delayed  instruction  to  the \ncontractor would have resulted in demobilization and a lack of in-country resources capable of \nconstructing  the  important  road  network  links.  The  government  considers  the  additional  road \nsections  as  high-priority  roads  as  these  are  part  of  an  essential  road  link  that  completes  the \nroad network around Betio and Bairiki. Works commenced in June 2016 and are expected to be \nfully completed by December 2016. Currently, government has disbursed about A$9.5 million of \nits own funds and expects further payments to be made for the remaining period. Subsequently, \nthe  government  requested  ADB  to  support  the  works  with  additional  financing  and  requested \napproval for 100% retroactive financing. \n \n12.  With  only  4%  of the  total  37.7 km  of the  original  paved  road  and  unpaved feeder road \nconstruction remaining, the volume of the additional work, is less than the ongoing contract, and \nits  accomplishment  will  ensure  the  overall  road  network  improvement  in  the  area.  The \ngovernment,  ADB,  and  cofinanciers  are  satisfied  with  the  very  high  quality  of  the  works  and \ntimeliness  of  implementation.  The  project  team  has  assessed  the  additional  sections  and \nconfirms that rehabilitating these sections will achieve a consistent road quality throughout the \nentire  South  Tarawa  road  network  completed  under  the  current  project.  Further,  the  project \nteam has assessed that the works are in full compliance with ADB procurement and safeguard \nguidelines and confirms that all current contract obligations remain. The works are ongoing and \nphysical  completion  is  expected  by  February  2017.  For  this  reason,  the  team  deems  that  the \ngovernment's request for 100% retroactive financing can be supported.  \n\n \n13. \nUnder  ADB\u2019s  Cost  Sharing  and  Eligibility  of  Expenditures,  retroactive  financing  is \npermitted  only  if,  among  other  factors,  (i)  it  is  specifically  agreed  by  ADB  and  the  recipient  of \ngrant financing in the grant agreement, and (ii) the amount to be retroactively financed does not \nexceed 20% of the grant.11 For the reason set out in paras. 11-12 above, the project team seeks \na  waiver  from  ADB\u2019s  Board  on  the  20%  ceiling  for  retroactive  financing  and  requests  that  the \nBoard approve retroactive financing for 100% of the grant amount. \n \n14. \nThe  current  project  is  eligible  for  additional  financing  because  (i)  it  remains  technically \nfeasible, economically viable, and financially sound; (ii) the government includes the investment \nas  high  priority  in  the  Kiribati  Development  Plan  (footnote  5);  (iii)  the  additional  financing  is \nconsistent  with  the  project\u2019s  development  objectives;  and  (iv)  the  overall  project  is  consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s current country partnership strategy.12 The current project is rated as performing well. \nThe safeguard categorization of the overall project remains unchanged. Additional financing of \nthe  current  project  is  the  most  efficient  way  for  ADB  to  maintain  support  for  achieving  the \ngovernment\u2019s objective in the road transport sector and is a suitable modality to make sure that \n(i) the overall project is successfully completed, (ii) the targets and indicators of the design and \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2012.

The  impact  will  be  an  improvement  in  socioeconomic  conditions  for  the  people  of \nSouth  Tarawa.  The  outcome  will  be  their  access  to  a  safe,  sustainable,  and  well-maintained \nroad network. \n \nC. \n \nOutput  1  under  the  current  project  is  that  the  government  rehabilitates  and  upgrades \n16. \n29.7 km of paved main roads and 8.0 km of unpaved feeder roads of the road network on South \nTarawa.  The  additional  financing  will  expand  the  output  1  core  indicators  by  constructing  an \nadditional 7.8 km of the main road in Betio and 0.5 km of selected feeder road, increasing the \ntotal rehabilitated and upgraded roads to 37.5 km of paved main roads and 8.5 km of unpaved \nfeeder  roads.  Outputs  2  and  3  will  remain  unchanged.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework \nhas been revised (Appendix 1). \n \nD. \n \n17. \nThe  additional  grant  of  $9  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (ADF)  together \nwith the government\u2019s additional contribution will increase the investment in the current project \nby 15%.

Project  preparation \nincluded  a  comprehensive  road  safety  audit  of  all  of  South  Tarawa\u2019s  roads,  and  the \nrecommendations  have  informed  the  detailed  engineering  design.15 The  project  team  confirms \nquality  tests  demonstrate  the  results  met  or  exceeded  specifications.  The  additional  scope \nincluding  road  designs,  safety  features,  pavement  surfacing,  and  costs  have  been  verified  by \nthe  consulting  engineer.  The  MPWU  continues  to  monitor  works  and  will  issue  instructions for \nremedial works, where required. The road runs near the edge of the lagoon for most of its length. \nA rise in sea level, extreme annual cycles of spring tides, and increased erosion are the most \nsignificant threats to its sustainability. Within the town areas of Betio and Bairiki, the additional \nscope  will  make  use  of  existing  drainage  features  (i.e.,  soak  pits  installed  by  the  MPWU  and \ndrains  installed  during  the  previous  Government  of  Japan-financed  road  improvements),  with \nsome  works  proposed  to  improve  drainage.  This  will  include  cleaning  out  of  existing  drainage \nand,  where  practicable  (in  terms  of  site  constraints  and  associated  costs),  landscape  areas \nadjacent to the road to minimize roadway inundation. \n \nB. \n \nThe additional financing will fund the rehabilitation of missing links of the road network in \n21. \nhigh traffic areas. The preliminary economic analysis  yielded an overall  economic internal rate \nof  return  of  35.6%  (from  40.3%  in  the  original  appraisal).  The  project  remains  economically \nviable.16 Such high returns reflect the significant transport cost savings from the 6,000 vehicles \nper  day  utilizing  a  much-improved  road  pavement.  Consideration  of  unquantified  road  safety, \nhealth  benefits,  and  potential  decongestion  on  the  main  road  in  Betio  further  bolsters  the \neconomic viability of the project. \n \n22. \nthe  MPWU,  a \nnoncommercial  unit  that  receives  annual  allocations  for  operation  and  maintenance  of \ninfrastructure  assets.

Report of the Road Safety Audit of Roads on Tarawa Island, Republic of Kiribati. Consultant\u2019s \n\nreport. Sydney. \n\n16 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nGovernance \n\nmanagement reforms are refocusing scarce resources toward funding of essential government \nfunctions  and  services,  including  infrastructure  operation  and  maintenance.  These  would, \ntherefore, facilitate consistently adequate allocations to the MPWU for routine and periodic road \nmaintenance. Government allocations are likely to be funded through the Revenue Equalization \nReserve Fund, which should provide adequate operation and maintenance funding and support \nthe sustainability of infrastructure assets. \n \nC. \n \n23. \nFinancial  management. A public expenditure and financial accountability assessment, \nconducted  in  Kiribati  in 2010,  indicated  that  public financial  management  is  weakened  by (i)  a \nlack  of  fiscal  discipline,  (ii)  non-retirement  of  advances,  (iii)  lack  of  financial  reconciliation \nbetween the executing agency\u2014the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MFED)\u2014\nand the line ministries, (iv) lack of effective expenditure commitment controls, and (v) outdated \nlegislation  and  regulations.17 Since  then,  development  partners,  including  ADB,  have  assisted \nthe government in designing and implementing the Kiribati Public Financial Management Plan, \n2011\u20132014.18 Improvements  in  public  financial  management  have  been  noted  by  the  project \nteam,  and  the  government  plans  to  update  the  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability \nassessment in 2017. \n \nThe  financial  management  arrangements  for  the  current  project  will  continue  for  the \n24. \nadditional  financing.  In  February  2016,  the  World  Bank  carried  out  an  implementation  review \nthat included assessing the financial management arrangements in the MFED and MPWU. The \nreview was satisfactory, and ADB is comfortable with the World Bank's assessment. The MFED \nwill  continue  to  be  responsible  for  the  overall  financial  management  of  the  project.  A  full-time \nqualified project accountant continues to handle all financial management activities. The project \nwill  continue  to  use  direct  payment  and  reimbursement  disbursement  procedures,  and  all \nrequired audits will be carried out. Currently, no audited project financial statements are overdue, \nand  no  financial  management  issues  are  pending.  Of  the  four  audited  project  financial \nstatements  received,  two  were  submitted  early  and  two  were  submitted  after  the  deadline.  All \naudit reports were issued with unqualified opinions. \n \nD. \n \n25. \nThe project will directly benefit the entire population of 56,300 (51.5% female and 48.5% \nmale) of Tarawa, for whom the road is a vital shared communal asset (footnote 3). As the lone \nvehicular  transport  route  on  the  atoll,  the  road  provides  access  to  vital  infrastructure,  social \nservices,  and  economic  opportunities.  It  sustains  economic  development,  links  communities, \nand is also the main thoroughfare for pedestrians. It will reduce roadside dust and improve air \nquality,  leaving  homes,  shops,  and  vehicles  cleaner;  and  reduce  damage  to  mechanical \nequipment. New footpaths will improve pedestrian safety and reduce reliance and spending on \nvehicle transport while encouraging nonmotorized transport. \n \n26. \nThe  current  project  diligently  carries  out  a  HIV/AIDS  information  and  education \ncampaign  for  the  contractor\u2019s  employees,  subcontractors,  consultants,  and  communities  near \nthe project site. \n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \n\n                                                 \n17 Government of Kiribati. 2010.

The  current  project  is  classified  category  B,  and  the  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP)  prepared  was  updated  to  reflect  ongoing  impacts.  The  project  is \ncurrently  operating  under  the  revised  version  6  of  the  EMP  approved  in  December  2015.  The \nresulting  contractor\u2019s  EMP  (revision  N)  was  accepted  in  August  2015.  The  main  potential \nimpacts  are  (i)  disturbance  from  dust  arising  from  loading,  unloading,  and  transportation  of \nconstruction  materials; (ii)  noise;  (iii)  erosion  and  sedimentation from  exposed  surfaces  during \nconstruction,  which may  affect  the  lagoon  environment;  (iv) risks from  the  use  and  disposal of \nhazardous  materials  such  as  used  fuel  and  lubricants;  and  (v)  greater  risk  of  accidents  from \nmore  vehicle  movements.  Detailed  mitigation  measures  were  incorporated  in  the  project,  as \noutlined  in  the  EMP.  An  international  environment  specialist  and  a  national  environment \ninspector were engaged during the construction phase to monitor compliance with the EMP and \nreport  to  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  Land  and  Agricultural  Development.  The  environmental \nclassification for the additional financing is classified categorized C. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples. The project is classified category \n28. \nB,  and  the  resettlement  plan  has  been  updated  to  reflect  anticipated  impacts  and  provide \nguidelines  for  any  unanticipated  impacts.  The  additional  financing  is  classified  categorized  C \nsince no buildings are to be relocated and no economic crops are affected under the project. To \nthe extent possible, the roads to be rehabilitated will follow the current road alignment, and any \nresettlement  or  compensation  for  economic  loss  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the \nupdated  resettlement  plan.  To  date,  compensation  for  loss  of  land  and  assets,  mainly  for  the \nloss of fruit-bearing trees, has been paid to 97% of affected persons (327 in total). An escrow \naccount  has  been  established  for  the  compensation  of  the  remaining  13  affected  persons  as \nsoon  as the  pending  court  cases  are  resolved  and  affected  persons  are traced. The  project  is \nclassified  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples,  and  no  indigenous  peoples,  as  defined  under \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), are expected to be affected by the overall project. \n \nF. \n \n29. \nNo  significant  issues  are  expected  to  arise  in  implementing  the  overall  project.

Hence  the  total  paved  road at the  time  should  have shown  29.7 km \n(=32.5km - 2.8 km) not 32.5 km. As part of the additional financing, the overall project indicator for Output 1 is 37.5 \nkm paved roads and 8.5 km unpaved feeder roads. \na  Government of Kiribati. 2016.
