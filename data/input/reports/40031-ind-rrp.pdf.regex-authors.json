An overall initial environmental \nAssessment  examination (IEE) of the Rajasthan Urban Sector Development \nInvestment  Program  (the  Investment  Program)  and  IEEs  of \nsubprojects in the sample urban local bodies (ULBs) have been \ndone.  (The  draft  summary  IEE  is  in  Appendix  11).  An \nenvironmental assessment and review framework (Supplementary \nAppendix  K)  has  been  prepared  to  guide  the  environmental \nassessment  of  subprojects  during  the  implementation  of  the \nInvestment Program. \n   \nInvestment Program  The  Investment  Program  is  designed  to  improve  the  urban \nDescription  environment  and  promote  ongoing  reforms  for  sustainable, \nefficient,  and  responsive  urban  service  delivery  in  15  initially \nidentified ULBs of Rajasthan with economic growth and tourism \npotential. The physical investments include improvements in water \nsupply, wastewater management, solid waste management, urban \ndrainage,  urban  transport  and  roads,  social  infrastructure,  and \ninfrastructure  support  for  cultural  heritage.  Coupled  with  the \nphysical  improvements  is  a  capacity  development  program  to \nenable the ULBs to implement the ongoing urban institutional, \nfinancial, and service delivery reforms.   \n   \nMultitranche Financing  The Government of India has requested the Asian Development \nFacility   Bank (ADB) for financing for the Investment Program through a \nmultitranche  financing  facility.  The  Facility,  amounting  to \n$273 million over 7 years, will finance infrastructure investments \nand  capacity  development  in  support  of  the  ongoing  urban \ninstitutional, financial, and service delivery reforms.  \n   ", "ii   \nRationale  Urban development for economic growth is a universal strategy of \nthe Government of India as its 10th Five-Year Plan [FYP], 2002\u2013\n2007,  and  11th  FYP,  2007\u20132012,  show.  The  strategy  is \nspearheaded  by  such  urban  development  schemes  as  the \nJawaharlal  Nehru  National  Urban  Renewal  Mission  and  its \nsubcomponent the Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for \nSmall  and  Medium  Towns.  Apart  from  supporting  the \nGovernment\u2019s priority of planned development of urban centers in \nthe  country,  the  Investment  Program  is  also  aligned  with  the \nobjectives of fostering economic growth and reducing poverty in \nRajasthan. The fast-growing sectors in Rajasthan are mostly in \nurban areas, where productivity is 3.5 times higher than in rural \nareas.  \n   \nThe  emphasis  on  urban  development  in  Rajasthan,  financial \nreforms and the passage of the 74th Constitutional Amendment \nAct in 1992, which laid the basis for decentralization in the urban \nsector, have made some improvements, but large inefficiencies in \nservice delivery, low investment in wider service coverage, and \npoor maintenance persist. \n \nThe Investment Program and its road map are guided by the 10th \nFYP 2002\u20132007 and 11th FYP 2007\u20132012 of the Government of \nIndia.  (See  the  Framework  Financing  Agreement  for  the \nInvestment Program, Schedule 1) The Investment Program links \ncapital investments to reforms for sustainable impact. It targets \nmedium-size towns with economic growth and tourism potentials, \nwhile maintaining regional balance.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Investment Program will increase economic growth, reduce \npoverty, and sustain improvements in the urban environment and \nthe quality of life in the 15 initially identified ULBs in Rajasthan. It \nis expected to improve access to sustainable urban infrastructure \nand services for 1.6 million people in the Investment Program \nULBs, and to strengthen the capacity of these ULBs to manage \nurban services in a sustainable manner by the end of the Program \n(2014). \n   \nInvestment Program  The  Investment  Program  is  estimated  to  cost  $390  million, \nInvestment Plan   including taxes and duties of $36.5 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  Amount  Share  \nSource  ($ million)    (%) \nAsian Development Bank  273.0    70 \nGovernment of Rajasthan and other \n  agencies  117.0    30 \n  Total    390.0    100 \n   Source: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n   \n ", "  iii\nFacility Amount and  A $273 million lending facility from the ordinary capital resources \nTerms   of ADB will be provided to the Government of India. The final \nterms and conditions will be determined for each loan, according \nto the policies of ADB. Financing under each loan will be provided \nunder ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based facility. \nThe  Government  can  choose  a  currency  (from  among  eligible \ncurrencies) and an interest rate regime most suitable for each \nloan.  ADB  also  provides  flexibility  in  repayment  and  interest \nswaps  during  the  financing  period.  Moreover,  repayment \nschedules that match the needs of each batch of subprojects with \ntheir cost recovery and sustainability profiles can be structured for \neach loan. \n \nThe Government of India will pass down the total loan amounts to \nthe state of Rajasthan on the same terms as those of the ADB \nloans.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  December  2014  (the  last  periodic  financing  request  to  be \nsubmitted no later than by 2010). \n   \nEstimated Investment  June 2014. \nProgram Completion \nDate \n   \nExecuting Agency   The state government of Rajasthan acting through its Local Self \nGovernment Department (LSGD) under the Urban Governance \nDepartment of Rajasthan. \n   \nImplementation  A state-level empowered committee will monitor the use of the \nArrangements  Facility. The LSGD will manage the Investment Program in the \nULBs through an investment program management unit (IPMU), \nwhich  will  (i)  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  Investment \nProgram, (ii) review subprojects submitted by ULBs and periodic \nfinancing  requests  submitted  to  the  Department  of  Economic \nAffairs,  (iii)  report  to  ADB  on  the  progress  of  the  Investment \nProgram, and (iv) assist the ULBs in implementation. The IPMU \nwill be assisted by investment program management consultants \n(IPMCs) in managing the Investment Program and ensuring the \ntechnical quality of design and construction.  \n \n  Fifteen investment program implementation units (IPIUs) will be \nestablished at ULB level, and a full-time IPIU representative will \nbe appointed in each Investment Program ULB. The IPIUs will \ncarry  out  the  daily  implementation  activities  of  the  Investment \nProgram. The IPMU and IPIUs will be assisted by design and \nsupervision  consultants  (DSCs)  in  preparing  the  design \ndocuments, managing the tendering of contracts, and supervising \nthe  construction  as  well  as  the  overall  management  of  the \nInvestment Program by the IPMCs.  \n \n ", "iv   \n  A work finalization committee, chaired by the principal secretary \nfor urban governance, will review the subproject appraisal reports \nand give its final endorsement before the reports are submitted to \nADB. City-level committees under the various district collectors \nwill  review  the  activities  in  the  Investment  Program,  suggest \nimprovements, and guide the IPIUs in making the improvements.  \n   \nProcurement  All goods and services to be financed by the loans under the \nFacility  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Civil works \ncontracts  of  at  least  $10  million  will  be  procured  through \ninternational competitive bidding; all other such contracts will be \nprocured  through  national  competitive  bidding.  As  far  as \npracticable,  goods  will  be  procured  in  packages  of  more  than \n$1 million each to be suitable for international competitive bidding \nor  limited  international  bidding.  Minor  goods  costing  less  than \n$100,000 will be purchased through shopping. The feasibility of \ncommunity contracting will be examined on a case-to-case basis \nfor slum upgrading and low-cost sanitation and other community \nworks valued at less than $100,000.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants will be hired for the Investment Program according to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). A national consulting firm will be contracted to \nprovide IPMCs for 443 person-months and three national firms to \nprovide  DSCs  for  1,464  person-months,  through  ADB\u2019s \nquality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) procedures under the \naforementioned guidelines.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Investment Program will benefit about 1.6 million people in 15 \nBeneficiaries  initially identified ULBs by improving the urban environment and, \nhence,  the  health,  living  conditions,  and  productivity  of  the \nresidents.  Better  urban  infrastructure  and  services  will  lead  to \neconomic  benefits  from  enhanced  productivity  and  urban \nefficiency for the participating ULBs, and will promote investments \nin  the  state.  The  interventions  will  benefit  the  poor.  Close  to \n200,000  slum  residents  will  benefit  directly  from  the  slum \nimprovement  subcomponent.  Improvements  in  other  town-wide \ninfrastructure, e.g., drainage, will also have a profound impact on \nthe poor, most of whom live on hazardous land prone to flooding. \nFurther, the Investment Program will ensure sustainable urban \ndevelopment  by  supporting  urban  reforms  and  capacity \ndevelopment for better urban governance and improved service \ndelivery.  \n   \n ", "  v\nRisks and Assumptions  This is a low risk project. The effectiveness of the infrastructure to \nbe developed under the Investment Program will depend on the \nlevel of ownership and commitment shown by the state and the \nInvestment  Program  ULBs.  The  state  and  the  ULBs  must  be \ncommitted  to  institutional  change  and  financial  reforms, \nparticularly cost recovery and the long-term sustainability of the \nassets  and  services.  There  must  be  sustained  political  will  to \nincrease tariffs and impose service charges or property taxes in \norder to achieve cost recovery within a reasonable time. Another \ndownside risk is that the Investment Program ULBs do not have \nenough revenues to properly manage and maintain the existing \nand newly acquired assets and may be forced to minimize costs \nthrough inappropriate operations.  \n \nVarious measures designed into the Investment Program address \nthese potential risks. Civic awareness programs are expected to \nstimulate  demand  for  better  services  and  willingness  to  pay. \nIncentive to implement ongoing reforms will be further reinforced \nthrough  capacity  development  and  ADB\u2019s  continued  policy \ndialogue during the implementation of the Investment Program.  \n \nThe state government and the ULBs are committed to maximizing \nlocal  revenue  and  providing  an  adequate  operation  and \nmaintenance budget for asset sustainability. The government is \nnow preparing a transition plan for urban services (from its line \nagencies to the ULBs), and has put in place enhanced revenue \naugmentation  measures  such  as  infrastructure  development \ntasks. The ULBs should thus be able to assume responsibility for \nurban service provision in a phased manner as the assets are \ntransferred and the ULBs gain the resources and revenues to \nadequately manage them. \n   \n ", "72o  00\u2019E 77o  00\u2019E 75 o 00'E HIMACHAL 85 o 00'E\nPRADESH\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\nPAKISTAN PUNJAB UTTARAKHAND\nINDIA PUNJAB HARYANA ARUNCHAL\nDELHI NEPAL PRADESH\nRAJASTHAN Jaipur SIKKIMBHUTAN\nURBAN SECTOR DEVELOPMENT R A J A S T H A N  PURTATDAERSH B I H A R MEGHAA LSA SY AA M\n25 o 00'N 25 o 00'N\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM Hanumangarh G U J A R A T M A D H Y A JHARKHANDBWENEGBSATALNGLATRDIPEUSMRHIAZORAM\nP R A D E S H\nHANUMANGARH CHHATTISGARH\nO R I S S A\nGulf  of Cambay M A H A R A S H T R A\nP A K I S T A N B a y  o f\n B e n g a l\nHARYANA\nA N D H R A\nP R A D E S H\nGOA\nRATANGARH\nBIKANER CHURU A r a b i a n KARNATAKA\n28o  00'N Bikaner Churu 28o  00'N S e a TAMIL\nRatangarh 10 o 00'N KERALA  NADU 10 o 00'N\nNAWALGARH Alwar SRI LANKA\nNawalgarh\nJAISALMER ALWAR 75 o 00'E 85 o 00'E\nJaisalmer NAGAUR Bharatpur UTTAR  PRADESH\nJAIPUR BHARATPUR\nJODHPUR Nagaur\nJaipur Bari\nBARI\nAjmer SAWAI N\nJodhpur MALPURA MADHOPUR\nMalpura\nAJMER Sawai Madhopur\n0 50 100\nBarmer\nPali\nKilometers\nPALI SHAHPURA\nKOTA\nSirohi\nBARMER Shahpura National Capital\nKota Baran State Capital\nSIROHI\nNATHDWARA BHILWARA City/Town\nABU Bhilwara BARAN Airport\nAbu\nNational Road\nUdaipur\nJhalawar Other Road\nJHALAWAR Railway\nUDAIPUR River\n24o  00'N District Boundary 24o  00'N\nDungarpur\nState Boundary\nDUNGARPUR RATLAM\nG  U  J  A  R  A  T MADHYA   PRADESH International Boundary\nRatlam Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n0\n7\n-0\n8\n5\n4 H 72o  00\u2019E 77o  00\u2019E\nR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (the Facility) to India for the Rajasthan Urban Sector Development \nInvestment Program (the Investment Program).1  \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis  \n2.  Rajasthan is India\u2019s largest state, with an area of 350,000 square kilometers and a \npopulation  of  56.5  million  (2001  census).  The  Aravalli  mountain  range  runs  southwest  to \nnortheast across the state, dividing it into two distinct geographical regions\u2014the Thar Desert \ncovering more than 60% of the state, leaving Rajasthan acutely deficient in water supply, and \nthe fertile eastern region. The distribution of the state\u2019s urban centers is related to climate, water \nresources, and soil fertility, with the northeast region more sparsely populated than the eastern \nregion. Rajasthan\u2019s towns and cities have always been among the best planned in India, but \nrapid population growth over the last four decades has brought urban decline.  \n \n3.  The state has an urban population of around 13.2 million, 23.4% of its total population \n(2001 census). Though lower than the national average of 27.8%, this proportion is expected to \nreach 26.1% (22.8 million) by 2021. The urban population grew rapidly in the 1990s, by 2.7% \nper  year,  because  of  high  natural  growth  rates  and  rural  migration.  Population  growth  is \nprojected to slow down but to remain high. In the 15 initially identified Investment Program \ntowns,2 or urban local bodies (the Investment Program ULBs), the population is expected to \ngrow by 2\u20137% per year over the next 10 years.  \n \n4.  Rajasthan\u2019s natural beauty and rich history\u2014about 80% of Indian heritage properties are \nin the state\u2014make it a favorite tourist destination and one of India\u2019s fastest growing. It received \nabout 17 million tourists in 2004, and this number is expected to grow to almost 20 million by \n2010. The tourism sector, directly or indirectly, employs 15 million, or 24% of the state\u2019s total \npopulation. But the sector accounted for just 14% of gross state domestic product (GSDP) in \n2003\u20132004,  compared  with  21%  in  Kerala,  the  second-biggest  tourism  state.  To  increase \neconomic growth and employment opportunities, Rajasthan needs to establish comparative \nadvantage in the tourism sector not only through proper planning and developmental controls \nbut also through better public infrastructure and an enabling environment for private investment \nin the sector.  \n \n5.  The state\u2019s economy grew by an average of 6.2% per year in 1980\u20132000, one of the \nfastest among the Indian states. Since 2000, however, annual growth rates have fluctuated \nsignificantly. The growth rates of 9.4% in 2003, -6.5% in 2004, and 1.5%3 in 2005 indicate \nincreasing economic volatility. In addition, severe droughts diminished the agriculture and allied \nsectors, and the investment rate averaged less than 16% of GSDP, well below India\u2019s average \nrate of 23%. While growth has picked up more recently, to 5% in 2005\u20132006 and 8.5% in 2006\u2013\n2007,  and  it  is  the  state\u2019s  utmost  agenda  to  restore  economic  growth  and  closing  the \ndevelopment gap.  \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework for the Investment Program is in Appendix 1.  \n2  The population of the Investment Program ULBs in 2006 was as follows: Jhalawar 48,054 (in 2001), Jhalrapatan \n30,103 (in 2001), Jaisalmer 69.894, Baran-Chhabra 96,798, Barmer 92,203, Bharatpur 229,807, Bundi 94,593, \nAlwar 286,853, Chittaurgarh 105,212, Rajsamand 59,391, Dhaulpur 110,157, Karauli 75,133, Churu 108,014, \nNagaur 100,077, Sawai-Madhopur 113,545, and Sikar 199,084. \n3  Gross state product growth rate is at 1993/94 constant price. The figures are from the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s \ndatabase. ", "2     \n \n6.  According to the income poverty standards of the Government of India and the state of \nRajasthan, 15% of the population is living below the poverty line (2001 census). Unlike other \nstates, Rajasthan has a higher percentage of households living below the poverty line in the \nurban areas (20%) than in the countryside (14%). Moreover, even a marginally higher poverty \ncutoff would raise the poverty level significantly, since a large part of the population is clustered \njust above the poverty line.4 More than 20% of the urban population lives in slum areas.  \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n7.  The  ADB  supported  project  Rajasthan  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Project \n(RUIDP)5 has  provided  significant  improvements  in  provision  of  basic  urban  services,  and \nprovided capacity development to ULBs to manage urban services in six ULBs. The availability \nof adequate urban services in other urban centers however, are still inadequate because of \npopulation pressures, the influx of tourists, and the generally poor management and operation \nof public services common to many cities in India\u2014plus lack of funds. The Investment Program \nroad map indicates that 80% of the urban population in the state has access to piped water. But \nmost of these (80%) receive less than 80 liters per capita per day (lpcd) of potable water,6 \nagainst the 100\u2013175 lpcd prescribed by the Indian Bureau of Standards.7 The rest get their \ndrinking water through hand pumps (10%) or from tube wells and open wells (10%).  \n \n8.  About  70%  of  urban  households  have  access  to  in-house  sanitation,  while  24% \n(predominantly from poor households) defecate in the open. Only 11 of 222 towns in the state \nhave partial sewerage. Inadequate sanitation, with wastewater percolating into the soil and \noverflowing into drains and streams, presents environmental and health risks. The absence of \nsewerage facilities has led to contamination of surface water in and around towns, and open \ndrains in particular contain high risk of waterborne diseases. Less than 50% of solid waste is \ncollected, house-to-house services reach only 35% of households, waste is unsegregated, \ndustbins and other storage are insufficient, waste is handled manually when transported, and \ncrude open dumping has taken the place of engineered sanitary landfills and proper waste \nmanagement facilities in more than 80% of the towns. A substantial proportion of households \nregularly dump their waste onto the nearest open space or into drains. Equipment use is \ngenerally inefficient, and no records are kept of waste collected, transported, and disposed of. \nThese practices impact the health of the urban population in the state need to be addressed.  \n \n9.  Urban roads in all the Investment Program ULBs are in poor condition, and the road \nnetwork and parking spaces cannot sustain the traffic volume, which has grown significantly in \nthe  last  decade.  Frequent  traffic  congestion  is  worsened  by  bad  roads  and  ineffective \nmanagement and enforcement. In Jaisalmer, an Investment Program ULB, for lack of parking \nspaces, passengers board and alight from vehicles at intersections, causing serious traffic \ncongestion. \n \n10.  Urban Institutional Framework. The analysis of the urban institutional framework made \nin the Investment Program road map suggests that weak urban management is responsible for \npoor  performance  in  urban  planning  and  provision  of  infrastructure  and  services  in  the \nInvestment  Program ULBs. Dedicated urban local authorities are still at an early stage of \n                                                 \n4  A cutoff 10% higher would increase urban poverty by some 34% and rural poverty by around 29% at the aggregate \nnational level.  \n5   ADB. 1998.

The ULBs covered under this project are \nAjmer, Bikaner, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota and Udaipur. \n6  Per capita water supply in the 222 towns in the state varies as follows: 40% get less than 60 liters per capita per \nday (lpcd); 36%, 60\u201380 lpcd; 14%, 80\u2013100 lpcd; and only 10% receive more than 100 lpcd.  \n7  Depending on the size of the town.  \n ", "  3   \ndevelopment,  and  urban  management  is  constrained  by  the  multiplicity  of  institutions  with \noverlapping responsibilities. The functions of the ULBs are largely confined to solid waste \nmanagement and minor roads. The ULBs have no control over the important basic services of \nwater supply and sanitation.8 Water supply and sanitation services are provided by the Public \nHealth Engineering Department (PHED) of the state. Town planning and land development are \nassigned to state authorities as well as to the ULBs.  \n \n11.  Institutional Finances. All the Investment Program ULBs are supported by the state. \nThe main local revenues are from infrastructure development taxes and rental income from \nmunicipal properties. Water charges are levied in all Investment Program ULBs and collection \nefficiency is relatively high, at around 80%. However, the charges are far below the operating \ncost (about 23% below) because of low tariffs and the high level of unaccounted-for water \n(around 40\u201350%). Power supply costs, which make up a significant portion of the cost of water \nsupply operations, are paid by PHED.  \n \n12.  Lack of adequate revenue sources is affecting the operation and maintenance of urban \nservices by the ULBs. ULBs financial resources are mainly spend on salaries and administration \nrelated expenses (for instance 80% in Alwar, 76% in Jaisalmer, and 81% in Jhalawar and \nJhalapatan), leaving limited resources for operation and maintenance. \n  \n13.  Government of Rajasthan (GoR) has recognized that urban development accelerates \nthe state\u2019s growth hence urban development has assumed a high priority. This can be seen by a \nsignificantly large allocation for urban development in its last budget (2005\u20132006). Capital \nexpenditure, estimated at 4.5% of GSDP in 2005\u20132006, is directed to the sectors, water supply \nand  sanitation,  and  urban  development,  sectors  that  were  relatively  neglected  in  budget \nallocations during the 1990s. The change in emphasis, together with the financial sector reforms \nnow being undertaken by the state government and the passage of the 74th Constitutional \nAmendment Act in 1992, which laid out the basis for decentralization in the urban sector has \nbrought about some improvements, but inefficiencies in service delivery, inadequate investment \nto expand service coverage, and lack of maintenance of assets persists. The urban sector is \nanalyzed in greater detail in Appendix 2. \n \n14.  External Assistance. ADB has extended 31 technical assistance (TA) grants totaling \n$17.0 million to India\u2019s urban sector since 1993, and has approved $3.17 billion in loans for 13 \nprojects. The strategic thrust of ADB\u2019s assistance for the urban sector in India has been poverty \nreduction through shared growth, social development, and good governance. These objectives \nhave  been  translated  into  actions  by  mostly  integrated  urban  infrastructure  and  services \nprojects. Appendix 2 gives an overview of external assistance to Rajasthan.  \n \n15.  Lessons  Learned.  ADB\u2019s experience in the urban sector in India9 and its recently \ncompleted urban sector study10 show the inherent complexity of urban sector projects and the \nneed  for  close  coordination  between  agencies,  enhanced  institutional  capacity,  and  public \nsupport in their implementation. Important lessons learned from ADB\u2019s experience with urban \ndevelopment projects in India, and with RUIDP in particular, have been incorporated into the \ndesign  of  the  proposed  Investment  Program.  The  key  lessons  learned  and  the  measures \n                                                 \n8  PHED is now transferring the responsibility for maintaining drainage to the ULBs while retaining ownership of the \nassets. \n9  ADB. 2006. Special Evaluation Study on Urban Sector Strategy and Operations. Manila.  \n10 Self-evaluations  in  three  project  completion  reports  on  5  of  the  13  projects  approved  for  India\u2019s  urban \nsector,indicated that project performance was highly successful in one project (Loan 1416\u2013Karnataka Urban \nInfrastructure Development Project) and successful in the other four projects (Loans 1415\u2013Karnataka Urban \nInfrastructure Development Project, 1549 and 1550\u2013Housing Finance Project, and 1560\u2013Provincial Towns Basic \nUrban Services). \n ", "4     \nidentified and introduced are summarized in Appendix 3. An update on the status of the RUIDP \nloan covenants is in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n16.  Investment Program Rationale. The rationale for the Investment Program, apart from \nthe national priority of planned development of major urban centers in the country, is economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction in Rajasthan. The fastest-growing sectors in the state are mostly \nin the urban areas, where productivity is 3.5 times higher than in the countryside. Hence, the \nInvestment Program is designed to assist the state in improving urban infrastructure in 15 \nmedium-sized ULBs, which were strategically selected to maximize the Investment Program\u2019s \ncontribution to the state\u2019s overall economic growth, while maintaining regional balance. \n \n17.  A road map for the Investment Program including the investment needs of the urban \nsector has been prepared (see the Framework Financing Agreement [FFA] for the Investment \nProgram, Schedule 1). In line with the policies of the Government of India and the government \nof Rajasthan, it envisages a gradual transition to a more efficient and accountable system of \nurban infrastructure provision and service delivery. Fifteen ULBs in Rajasthan have initially been \nidentified for assistance with their municipal functions (delivery of basic urban services) in the \nInvestment Program, as mandated by the 74th Constitution Amendment Act of India.11 The \nInvestment Program will initially focus on investments in priority subsectors, namely, urban \nwater  supply,  sewerage  and  sanitation,  solid  waste  management,  drainage,  transport  and \nroads,  slum  improvement,  and  supporting  infrastructure  for  cultural  heritage.  The  capacity \ndevelopment  subcomponent  will  comprise  institutional  strengthening  (computerization  and \nsupport for accounting reforms), training, and capacity development, directly and through the \nCity Managers\u2019 Association and the Rajasthan Institute of Local Self Governance, as well as a \ncommunity  action  participation  program.  The  state  government  and  the  ULBs  will  also  be \nassisted in strengthening the reforms already initiated by the government of Rajasthan and the \nGovernment of India, such as those in (i) urban finance and governance reforms, for more \nsustainable service delivery; and (ii) sustainable revenue generation through rationalized user \ncharges and urban-based taxes.  \n \n18.  The Investment Program is applying a sector loan approach to allow more flexible \ninvestment decisions based on priorities (and constraints) within a sector policy and master plan \nframework, and ensure investments that are linked to reforms through subproject criteria.12 The \nsector loan approach is based on the following: (i) systematic analysis by the state government \nof the main problems in its urban areas, and the recommendations outlined in its 11th Five-Year \nPlan (FYP), master plans, and city development plans; (ii) the fact that the Executing Agency \n(EA), the Local Self Government Department (LSGD), is also now implementing the state\u2019s solid \nwaste management action plan and Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and \nMedium  Towns,  and  that  the  investment  program  will  be  implemented  by  an  investment \nprogram implementation unit (IPMU), which is an expansion of the existing project management \nunit for RUIDP; and (iii) policies like the draft Water Policy (2006), the Municipal Bill (2006), and \nthe draft Urban Housing and Habitat Policy (2007), are currently under finalization.  \n \n19.  Three sample ULBs were selected for detailed feasibility studies, namely, Alwar, the \nlargest  ULB  among  the  15  initially  identified  Investment  Program  ULBs  and  one  of  the \nfastest-growing cities in Rajasthan; Jaisalmer, a border town of significant tourism and strategic \nimportance; and Jhalawar-Jhalrapatan, the smallest among the Investment Program ULBs. The \nthree ULBs represent the various topographies and different economic and growth conditions \nwithin the state, and include 22% of the total population of the Investment Program ULBs. \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2006.

THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n20.  The Investment Program is expected to increase economic growth, reduce poverty, and \nsustain improvements in the urban environment and in the quality of life in the 15 Investment \nProgram ULBs in Rajasthan. The expected outcome will be increased access to sustainable \nurban infrastructure and services for 1.6 million people in the Investment program ULBs, and \nimproved capacity of the Investment Program ULBs to manage urban services in a sustainable \nway. \nB.  Outputs  \n21.  The Investment Program outputs are grouped into two parts. Part A will improve (i) water \nsupply systems in Investment Program ULBs by rehabilitating, strengthening, and expanding \nnetworks and constructing new supply systems; (ii) sewerage and drainage by constructing new \nsystems and extending existing ones; (iii) solid waste collection, processing and treatment, and \ndisposal by developing sanitary landfill sites; (iv) road rehabilitation and road safety; (v) social \ninfrastructure, such as slum improvements and other municipal facilities that may be prioritized \nas  the  master  plans  are  updated  and  finalized;  and  (vi)  infrastructure  support  for  cultural \nheritage, such as access roads and sanitation facilities. The outputs in Part B will involve \n(i) capacity building and institutional development to make the state system more responsive, \nempower local government, improve the financial performance of the local bodies and service \nproviders,  and  improve  urban  services  overall  for  citizens;  and  (ii) management  and \nimplementation support for the implementation of the Investment Program.  \n1.  Part A: Urban Infrastructure Improvements \n22.  Water Supply. Investments in this component are aimed at improving the quality and \nquantity of water supply\u2014to 135 lpcd of potable water on average to consumers\u2014through \nsource  augmentation,  improvements  in  water  treatment  facilities,  distribution  system \nrehabilitation, monitoring, and loss reduction. Further, piped water supply service coverage will \nbe increased to 90% on average in the Investment Program ULBs, and unaccounted-for water \nreduced to 20% of total supply throughout the system over the Investment Program period. The \ninvestments will consist of: (i) immediate rehabilitation of water supply systems in all Investment \nProgram ULBs to optimize efficiency and minimize losses, and implementation of a long-term \nprogram of leak detection and repair; (ii) source augmentation and improvement or provision of \nwater treatment facilities; (iii) provision of universal household connections and metering, and \nbulk  metering;  (iv) replacement  of  inefficient  pumping  machinery,  among  other  energy \nconservation and demand management measures, to reduce the operation and maintenance \n(O&M)  costs  of  the  water  supply  systems  and  improve  system  efficiency;  and \n(v) implementation  of  awareness  campaigns  and  water  conservation  measures,  such  as \nrainwater harvesting. \n \n23.  Wastewater Management. The wastewater management improvements are aimed at \ndeveloping appropriate sewerage and sanitation systems for the safe disposal of sewage, on \nthe  basis  of  a  sewage  flow  equivalent  to  80%  of  net  water  supply  to  households,  and \nmaximizing sewerage system coverage by optimizing flushing velocities or providing appropriate \nlow-cost sanitation facilities; and identifying least-cost options for establishing the sewerage \nsystem and the sewage treatment plant, and appropriate options for water recycling and reuse.  \n \n24.  Solid  Waste  Management.  A  door-to-door  waste  collection  system  for  the  entire \nmunicipal area of the Investment Program ULBs will be developed and appropriate segregation \n ", "6     \nand treatment facilities provided for the municipal waste collected. The investments will include \nthe following: (i) implementation of a public awareness campaign and installation of household \nwaste collection equipment to maximize recycling and waste segregation at source; (ii) provision \nof waste collection and safe transport services; (iii) improvement of street sweeping and drain \nde-silting services; and (iv) construction of safe solid waste processing and disposal facilities, \nsuch as sanitary landfills and composting plants, preferably on a public-private partnership \n(PPP) model, to minimize the waste to be landfilled. \n \n25.  Urban Drainage. The urban drainage improvements are aimed at eliminating public \nhealth and flooding risks and pollution of surface waters by constructing adequate storm-water \ndrainage facilities for the Investment Program ULBs. Investments in this subcomponent will \ninclude (i) preparation of comprehensive drainage master plans for the Investment Program \nULBs; (ii)  construction of roadside and outfall drains to carry storm-water runoffs into natural \nchannels  or  groundwater  recharging  areas;  and  (iii)  provision  of  adequate  equipment  and \nresources to maintain the drains. Investments will be based on the drainage master plans of the \nULBs or give priority to densely populated areas with poor drainage and recurrent flooding \nproblems, and to slums. \n \n26.  Urban Transport and Roads. The urban transport improvements will decongest the city \ncenters, smooth traffic flow through the ULBs, and increase road capacity to ensure effective \ntraffic  management  and  transportation  in  the  Investment  Program  ULBs.  Investments  will \ninclude (i) development of traffic management plans; (ii) construction of roads and bridges in \npriority  and  congested  areas  in  the  cities;  (iii)  construction  of  parking  spaces  and  public \ntransport terminals, as identified in the traffic management plan of the ULBs; and (iv) upgrading \nof roads and pedestrian facilities.  \n \n27.  Social Infrastructure. This component is aimed at improving the quality of life in poor \nsettlements of the Investment Program ULBs, and providing the necessary facilities and support \nto the ULBs in responding to emergency needs, such as firefighting. The investment will include \nthe improvement of slum infrastructure to make up for deficiencies in water, sanitation, road, \nstreetlight, and drainage services, as well as in community and town hall, rainwater harvesting, \nand other minor community infrastructure.  \n \n28.  Support  Infrastructure  for  Cultural  Heritage.  This  component  will  provide \ninfrastructure support for identified cultural heritage sites and monuments in the Investment \nProgram ULBs.  \n2.  Part B: Capacity Development and Investment Program Management  \n29.  Capacity Development. A three-pronged approach will be taken in this component, \nwhich will involve assisting Rajasthan and the Investment Program ULBs in strengthening the \nreforms  already  begun  by  the  state,  such  as  (i)  computerization,  tax  assessment,  and \ninfrastructure  mapping  with  the  help  of  a  geographic  information  system;  (ii)  transition  to \ndouble-entry accounting through the computerization of accounting and financial management \nfunctions, in line with Rajasthan\u2019s ongoing State Urban Agenda for Rajasthan program; and \n(iii) training of Investment Program ULBs and line department staff of the state in Investment \nProgram  implementation,  urban  service  management,  and  urban  governance,  by  training \ninstitutions  like  the  Rajasthan  Institute  of  Local  Self  Government.  This  component  of  the \nInvestment Program is aimed at institutionalizing a system that will facilitate the transfer of \nurban service management responsibilities to the ULBs and enable the ULBs to plan, provide, \nand sustain the provision of urban services.  \n \n ", "  7   \n30.  At the LSGD, particularly its Directorate of Local Bodies, and at the Town Planning \nDepartment, this component will improve and strengthen internal systems and procedures, and \nthe monitoring of ULB performance. In the Investment Program ULBs, the capacity development \ncomponent will enhance urban planning, asset inventory and management, accounting, and \nfinancial management, and thus help ensure sustainable service provision, besides providing \ntraining in project development, design, and implementation, and in basic service delivery, to \nmunicipal staff.  \n \n31.  The capacity development program will also include a community action participation \nprogram (CAPP) to support the implementation and heighten the positive impact of physical \nimprovements under the Investment Program. The CAPP will include capacity development in \nthe  communities,  particularly  for  stakeholders  in  slum  areas  and  community-based \norganizations. More specifically, the CAPP will focus on (i) disseminating information on the \nInvestment Program, (ii) educating people about the connection between the environment and \nhealth  and  their  role  in  solid  waste  management,  and  (iii)  raising  awareness  of  the  cost \nimplications of improved services. The activities in this component will also encourage the \nparticipation of urban residents, including the women, the poor, slum communities, and other \nvulnerable groups, during Investment Program implementation, and ensure equal sharing of \nbenefits among them.  \n  \n32.  Investment Program Management. The investments in this component will support the \ncosts  of  Investment  Program  management  and  implementation,  including  the  incremental \nadministrative costs associated with IPMU and the investment program implementation units \n(IPIUs), mainly in equipment and logistics. This component will also fund the costs of the \nconsulting services to these units to assist them in managing the Investment Program and in \nundertaking detailed design and construction supervision during the Investment Program. \nC.  Special Features  \n33.  Investment Program Preparation. The Investment Program was prepared jointly by the \ngovernment of Rajasthan and ADB. The state government used consultants already hired for \nRUIDP to carry out urgent preparatory work. ADB used the bridging TA (footnote 11) to mobilize \nconsultants to assist the state government in preparing the Investment Program. Further, the \nULBs  that  could  qualify  for  funding  under  the  Program,  the  district  collectorates,  and  the \nconcerned state agencies also provided necessary support in collecting data and preparing the \nProgram. This joint and multifaceted preparatory approach shortened the preparation period of \nthe Investment Program by almost half.  \n \n34.  Bridging Technical Assistance. Grant funding under the bridging TA will support the \nstate  government  in  capacity  development  and  preparation,  and  will  jump-start  the \nimplementation of the Investment Program as soon as the Facility becomes available. The \nactivities include (i) preparation of infrastructure base maps for all the Investment Program \nULBs; (ii) conduct of the necessary survey, data collection, and studies to complete the detailed \ndesign  of  the  identified  subprojects  in  the  three  sample  ULBs;  (iii)  detailed  design  of  the \nsubprojects in the sample ULBs; (iv) assistance in the preparation of bid documents for the \nidentified  subprojects;  and  (v)  support  to  the  EA  in  updating  the  resettlement  plans  and \nenvironmental assessment documents for the sample subprojects. Furthermore, the bridging TA \nwill allow the EA to use the clean development mechanism (CDM) for solid waste management \nsubprojects.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  under  this  cluster  TA  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix B.  \n \n35.  Public-Private Partnership (PPP). PPP will be promoted to assist the ULBs in capacity \ndevelopment and in the transition period before their takeover of responsibilities from the state \n ", "8     \nentities. As part of the wider stakeholder consultation process, a workshop with local private \nsector representatives was held during the Appraisal Mission to explore opportunities for PPP \nand  seek  feedback  from  the  private  sector.  The  private  sector  partners  at  the  workshop \ndiscussed their preferred contract packaging arrangements and modalities, and the risks they \nperceived in maximizing PPP in the Investment Program. The Investment Program will dovetail \nwith ADB\u2019s existing technical assistance13 in preparing and developing potential PPP contracts \nfor identified subprojects. With the private sector feedback in mind, PPP modalities such as \nbuild-operate-transfer or extended (5-year) operation and maintenance contracts for sewage \ntreatment plants (packaged for a few ULBs) and solid waste management facilities will be \nexplored further and developed as appropriate for identified subprojects.14  \n \n36.  Good Governance. The Investment Program will strengthen good governance in the \nULBs.  It  will  (i)  improve  financial  management  systems  for  greater  service  accountability; \n(ii) provide training to improve the management of urban services and urban governance; and \n(iii) strengthen local stakeholders\u2019 participation in the planning and implementation of urban \nprojects, to enhance the accountability of ULBs to their citizens.  \n \n37.  Multitranche Financing Facility. The Facility will allow flexibility in making investment \ndecisions according to the needs and constraints of the Investment Program ULBs within a \nsector road map, and not according to predefined investment requirements in the conventional \nform of assistance. It will further allow the implementation of the Investment Program on the \nbasis  of  the  readiness  of  individual  subprojects.  The  Investment  Program  will  support  the \nimplementation of the ongoing institutional and financial reforms, thus building a long-term \npartnership  between  ADB,  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  Government  of  India  and  the  state \ngovernment of Rajasthan, on the other. Further, the Facility will promote engagement in building \nthe  capacity  of  urban  institutions  and  local  bodies  and  defining  proper  incentives  for \nperformance improvements, with individual loans being linked to certain reform targets over a \nrealistic time frame.  \n \n38.  Lessons Learned. The Investment Program incorporates lessons learned from previous \nurban sector projects in India, particularly in Rajasthan. These include the need to (i) assess \ncarefully  the  absorptive  capacity  of  the  Implementing  Agency  and  the  ULBs;  (ii)  select \ncomponents on the basis of extensive consultations with stakeholders; (iii) design tranches with \nULBs\u2019 priorities and demands in mind; and (iv) deal with areas of institutional and financial \nreform that were not addressed in previous interventions of ADB and other donor partners. \nD.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n39.  The cost of the investment plan for the Investment Program ULBs for the next 10 years \nis estimated at $450 million, of which $390 million is the estimated cost of the Investment \nProgram, as summarized in Table 1 below. Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and \nfinancier are provided in Appendix 4.  \n \n \n                                                 \n13 ADB.  2006.

Under this TA, a PPP cell \nhas been established in Rajasthan (September 2007). \n14 For instance, all sewage treatment plant (STP) construction and operation could be carried out under either \nperformance-based management contracts or 3- to 5-year extended operation and maintenance contracts (the \ndefault contractual mode for STPs), facilitating operator training and enabling the Investment Program ULBs to \nmanage the facilities and services. Similarly, the contracts for the construction and operation of all solid waste \nmanagement facilities under the Investment Program will be either build-operate-transfer or extended (5\u201310 years) \noperation and maintenance contracts. \n ", "  9   \nTable 1: Cost Estimates for the Investment Program \nAmount  Share \nComponent      ($ million)  (%) \nA.

Investment Program Management  \n42.  The  EA  for  the  Investment  Program  will  be  the  LSGD,  which  is  under  the  Urban \nGovernance  Department  (UGD)  of  Rajasthan.  The  UGD,  through  its  Urban  Development \nDepartment (UDD), is already implementing the RUIDP. Since the LSGD, and not UDD, has \njurisdiction over smaller towns, the IPMU will be established under the LSGD, which will be \nresponsible for the overall implementation and management of the Investment Program.  \n \n43.  A state-level and interministerial empowered committee (EC) has already been formed \nto provide policy guidance and coordination for all ULBs and subprojects, and decide on \nmatters  related  to  the  Investment  Program.  The  EC  is  chaired  by  the  minister  of  urban \ndevelopment and local self governance, and its members will include ministers, directors, and \nrepresentatives of other relevant government ministries and departments.16 A work finalization \ncommittee (WFC)17 chaired by the principal secretary for urban governance has also been \nformed. The WFC will review subproject appraisal reports and give its final endorsement before \ntheir submission to ADB.  \n \n44.  The IPMU18 will be the Implementing Agency for the Investment Program and individual \nprojects therein. Its staff will be seconded from the line agencies of the state government \nresponsible for managing the urban facilities and services under the Investment Program, such \nas PHED, PWD, and the Tourism Department, and from the Investment Program ULBs. The \nIPMU will be headed by a project director. The project director will manage the Investment \nProgram and will coordinate with and report to the EC, the state government, and ADB on the \nProgram. The IPMU will be assisted by investment program management consultants (IPMCs) \nin  managing  the  Investment  Program  and  ensuring  the  technical  quality  of  design  and \nconstruction.  \n \n45.  Under the IPMU, fifteen IPIUs will be established at the zonal and subdivision levels. \nThat will also be project implementation units for individual project as applicable. A full-time \nIPIU representative will be appointed in each Investment Program ULB. These IPIUs will be \n                                                 \n16 The empowered committee chaired by the minister, urban development and local self governance, has the \nfollowing members: additional chief secretary, infrastructure; principal secretary, finance and planning; principal \nsecretary, urban governance; principal secretary, art and culture; secretary, tourism; secretary, public health \nengineering; secretary, local self government; and project director, RUIDP (member secretary). \n17 The WFC includes the LSGD secretary, RUIDP project director and additional project director, concerned district \ncollectors, local bodies director, additional commissioner for tourism, archaeology director, medical and health \ndirector, PHED chief engineer, PWD chief engineer, chief town planner (from the town planning department), and \nsuperintending engineer (from the RUIDP project implementation unit concerned).  \n18 Since  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  of  RUIDP  is  already  successfully  implementing  RUIDP,  as \ndemonstrated by the successful rating of the RUIDP in ADB\u2019s Loan Financial Information System report, the \ngovernment of Rajasthan has decided to reconstitute the PMU of RUIDP into the IPMU for the Investment \nProgram, to include a broader range of skills and representation from the Investment Program ULBs. \n ", "  11   \nestablished in all ULBs and will carry out the daily implementation activities of the Investment \nProgram.  Further,  the  IPMU  and  IPIUs  will  be  assisted  by  three  design  and  supervision \nconsultants (DSCs) in preparing the design documents, managing the tendering of contracts, \nand supervising the construction works.  \n \n46.  City-level committees19 (CLCs) have been established under the chairmanship of district \ncollectors. The CLCs will meet at least quarterly or more often, if required, to review project \nactivities, identify needed improvements, and guide the IPIUs in improving project performance. \nAlso joining the CLC will be representatives from the Department of Irrigation, in ULBs where \nwater  source  augmentation  subprojects  are  proposed,  and  representatives  from  the \nArchaeological Survey of India or of the Department of Archaeology Museum of the state \n(whichever has the appropriate jurisdiction) and the Department of Tourism, wherever heritage \nand tourism subprojects are proposed. The Investment Program implementation arrangements \nare in Appendix 5.  \n2.  Subproject Selection Criteria  \n47.  While the subprojects of the Investment Program have generally been defined at this \nstage, the long-term nature of the Investment Program implies that certain adjustments may \nneed to be made during implementation as the needs and priorities of the ULBs change over \ntime. Such adjustments will have to be systematic, should not contradict the overall objectives \nand  principles,  and  require  due  diligence  on  all  aspects  and  safeguards.  The  subproject \nselection criteria, comprising the technical, environmental, social, institutional, economic, and \nfinancial criteria that will be considered in the ADB approval of PFRs are in Appendix 6. Fifteen \nULBs  with  an  estimated  total  population  of  around  1.6  million  (2001  census)  have  been \nidentified  initially  for  inclusion  in  the  Investment  Program.  All  these  ULBs  are  district \nheadquarters or ULBs with significant tourism and cultural heritage importance. The selection \ncriteria of any other ULBs eligible for inclusion in the Investment Program are in Appendix 6. \n3.  Approval Procedures for Subprojects and Tranches \n48.  For subprojects to be included in the first PFR, subproject preparation and appraisal \nhave been completed. For subprojects under the subsequent loans of the Investment Program, \nan approval procedure, as outlined in Appendix 6, has been agreed on. After ADB\u2019s approval, \nand subject to any modifications and measures required by ADB, the IPMU will prepare PFRs \nfor ADB\u2019s financing. The PFRs will be formally submitted to ADB for further processing by the \nGovernment  of  India.  Each  PFR  will  contain  the  following:  (i)  required  loan  amount; \n(ii) subprojects and components to be financed under the loan; (iii) cost estimates and financing \nplan;  (iv) implementation  arrangements;  (v)  confirmation  of  the  continuing  validity  of  and \nadherence to the provisions of the FFA; (vi) confirmation of compliance with the provisions \nunder  previous  loan  agreements  and  project  agreements,  as  appropriate;  and  (vii) other \ninformation required under the facility administration memorandum to be prepared and agreed \non by ADB and the Government of India, to facilitate the implementation and processing of the \nFacility.  \n                                                 \n19 The CLCs will be chaired by the district collectors and members of parliament, members of the legislative \nassembly; mayor; chairman and vice chairman of the municipal council; chairman/secretary, urban improvement \ntrust:  superintending  engineer,  public  health  engineering  department;  superintending  engineer,  public  works \ndepartment; commissioner, municipal council; principal medical officer, medical and health; senior town planner, \ntown planning department; superintending engineer, RUIDP project implementation unit; and representatives of \nlocal nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations as its members. \n ", "12    \n4.  Implementation Period \n49.  The Investment Program will be implemented in three or more tranches over 7 years \n(2007\u20132014). The tranches will be based on the readiness of subprojects, in terms of their \ntechnical,  environmental,  and  social  safeguards,  due  diligence,  and  land  acquisition \nrequirements,  as  well  as  on  the  intended  phasing  of  the  urban  improvement  works,  the \ninstitutional capacity of the implementing agencies, and the subproject selection criteria. The \nimplementation period for each tranche or loan is not more than 5 years. The implementation \nschedule of the Investment Program under each of the loans is in Appendix 7. The recruitment \nof IPMCs and DSCs and the construction of civil works and the purchase of equipment under \nthe first loan, in particular civil works of fully appraised subprojects for the three ULBs (Alwar, \nJaisalmer, and Jhalawar-Jhalarapatan), are expected to start immediately after the first loan \ntakes effect, through advance procurement actions and retroactive financing. \n5.  Procurement  \n50.  All goods and services to be financed by the loans under the Facility will be procured \naccording to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Civil works \ncontracts costing at least $10 million will be procured through international competitive bidding; \nall  other  such  contracts  that  cost  less  than  $10  million  will  be  procured  through  national \ncompetitive bidding (NCB). As far as practicable, goods will be procured in packages of more \nthan $1 million to be suitable for international competitive bidding. Otherwise, goods costing less \nthan $1 million per contract will be procured through NCB or limited international bidding, and \nmiscellaneous minor goods costing less than $100,000 through shopping. The feasibility of \ncommunity contracting will be examined individually for slum upgrading and low-cost sanitation \nand other community works costing up to $100,000. All NCB procurement under the loans \nshould comply with the procurement procedures agreed on for the Facility and use the standard \nbidding documents approved by ADB. The government of Rajasthan has modified the standard \nNCB bidding documents used under RUIDP, which were reviewed and accepted by ADB in \n2004, to ensure consistency with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto time) and to incorporate lessons learned from the RUIDP implementation. These bidding \ndocuments have been reviewed and modified as necessary by ADB for consistency with the \nupdated ADB requirements.  \n \n51.  The procurement plan in Appendix 8, which details indicative packages to be funded by \nthe first loan under the Facility, will be updated annually by the Executing Agency for approval \nby ADB. The design of the contract packages incorporates lessons learned from ADB\u2019s past \nurban projects in India. For instance, the procurement of similar equipment, such as bulk water \nmeters, pump machineries, and solid waste equipment, will be centralized and the equipment \nwill then be distributed by the IPMU to the IPIUs for installation in the ULBs. Additionally, \ncontract packages like the design and construction of sewage treatment plants have been \ncombined for neighboring ULBs to increase the contract size and contractor participation. Cost \nestimates will be based on the indices that will be used in updating the Investment Program.  \n  \n6.  Consulting Services  \n52.  Consultants  will  be  hired  for  the  projects  under  the  Facility  according  to  ADB\u2019s  \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). ADB\u2019s quality- and \ncost-based selection (QCBS) procedures under the aforementioned guidelines will be used in \nhiring a national consulting firm (443 person-months) to provide IPMCs, and three national firms \nto provide DSCs for 1,464 person-months. The IPMCs will be based in Jaipur and will assist the \nIPMU in managing the Investment Program and ensuring the technical quality of design and \n ", "  13   \nconstruction.  The  three  DSCs  will  assist  the  IPMU  and  IPIUs  in  preparing  the  design \ndocuments, managing the tendering of contracts, and supervising the construction works, and \nwill be individually located in three head offices, as follows: (i) head office at Bharatpur and \nsub-headquarters at Alwar, Bharatpur, Dhaulpur, Karauli, and Sawai Madhopur; (ii) head office \nat Nagaur and sub-headquarters at Barmer, Churu, Jaisalmer, Nagaur, and Sikar; and (iii) head \noffice  at  Jhalawar  and  sub-headquarters  at  Baran-Chhabra,  Bundi,  Chittaurgarh, \nJhalawar-Jhalrapatan, and Rajsamand. Outline terms of reference for the consulting packages \nare in Supplementary Appendix C. \n7.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n53.  Under each loan of the Facility, advance contracting of civil works and equipment and \nmaterials, and recruitment of consulting services, may be requested, subject to their eligibility \nunder the agreed procedures and guidelines. Except as otherwise agreed on with ADB, the \nexpenditures incurred for this purpose will qualify for retroactive financing of up to 20% of the \nproposed amount of the loans under the Facility, for eligible expenditures incurred before each \nloan takes effect, but not earlier than 12 months before the loan agreement is signed. The \nGovernment and state government of Rajasthan have been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of \nadvance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance relevant projects \nunder the Facility.   \n8.  Disbursement Arrangement \n54.  Disbursements of each loan proceeds under the Facility will conform to ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Each PFR will result in a \nseparate loan agreement, which will describe the detailed disbursement arrangements agreed \non by the Government of India, the government of Rajasthan, and ADB. Each loan under the \nFacility will have its own imprest account in the Reserve Bank of India for the use of IPMU, to \nensure the timely release of loan proceeds and speed up implementation. The amount in the \nimprest  accounts  and  the  SGIAs  at  any  given  time  should  be  equivalent  to  6  months  of \nestimated expenditures or 10% of the related loan amount, whichever is less. The said imprest \naccount will be established, managed, and liquidated according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook. Individual payments under the statement-of-expenditures procedures will for eligible \nexpenditures not exceed the equivalent of $100,000 per payment.  \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n55.  The  Government  of  India  and  the  government  of  Rajasthan  will  have  the  detailed \nconsolidated Investment Program accounts maintained by the IPMU audited by independent \nauditors whose qualifications, experience, and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB. The \naudited accounts will be submitted to ADB within 9 months of the end of the fiscal year. The \nannual audit report will include the audit of the central imprest account and the statement-of-\nexpenditures (SOE) procedure, and will specifically include a separate audit opinion on the use \nof loan proceeds, and compliance with SOE procedures. The government of Rajasthan has \nbeen made aware of ADB\u2019s policy on delayed submission, and its requirements for satisfactory \nand acceptable-quality audited accounts.  \n \n56.  The IPMU must provide ADB with quarterly progress reports on the implementation of \neach project within 45 days of the end of each quarter. The progress reports will cover the \nprogress made during the period under review, any changes in the implementation schedule, \nproblems or difficulties met and remedial actions taken, and work to be done and subprojects or \ncomponents  proposed  for  financing  in  the  coming  quarter.  The  reports  will  also  include  a \n ", "14    \nsummary financial account for each implementing agency, expenditures to date, and a report on \nbenefit monitoring. On the basis of the quarterly progress reports, ADB will prepare annual \nimplementation progress reports to be submitted to the Board each December. The IPMU will \nsubmit to ADB a project completion report within 3 months of the physical completion of the \nsubprojects financed under each loan, and a facility completion report within 3 months of the \nphysical completion of all supported activities and subprojects under the Facility. These reports \nwill describe the details of implementation, costs, monitoring and evaluation results, problems \nencountered and actions taken, and other relevant information that ADB may request.  \n10.  Anticorruption Policy and Governance Measures  \n57.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to inspect, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Investment Program. In this \nregard,  investigation,  if  any,  of  government  officials  would  be  requested  by  ADB  to  be \nundertaken  by  the  Government.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the \nInvestment  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the \nInvestment Program will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the \nrecords and accounts of the EA, the IPMU, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Investment Program. The government of Rajasthan will \ndisclose procurement under the Investment Program, as well as the criteria for subproject \nselection, and the results of the selection will be posted on the Investment Program office \nbulletin board and website.  \n \n58.  The adoption of the PPP modality, which would bring in competent private parties who \nwill be held accountable for clearly identified outputs in a comprehensive manner, is expected to \nfurther mitigate the risks of corruption. The introduction of e-governance in the Investment \nProgram  ULBs  will  streamline  systems  and  procedures  and  provide  access  to  a  robust \nmanagement information system with information on the ULBs\u2019 financial management practices \nand fiscal status. Rajasthan will ensure strict adherence to such project-specific anticorruption \nmeasures. \n \n11.  Investment Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n59.  The IPMU will ensure that an investment program performance management system \n(IPPMS) satisfactory to ADB is established within 3 months of the time the first loan under the \nFacility takes effect. The IPPMS will monitor and evaluate the performance of the Investment \nProgram,  as  well  as  of  subprojects  under  each  loan,  including  key  impact  and  outcome \nindicators and associated assumptions with corresponding target dates. For subprojects under \nthe PPP modalities, such as performance-based management contracts, or extended O&M \ncontracts, as applicable, key performance indicators satisfactory to ADB will be developed when \nrequests for proposals and draft contract documents are prepared for each subproject.  \n \n12.  Investment Program Review  \n60.  Investment Program Review. After a review of the quarterly progress reports, ADB will \nmeet with representatives of the government of Rajasthan as required to discuss the progress \nof the Investment Program under each loan, any changes in the implementation arrangements, \nor remedial measures that are needed to achieve the overall objectives of specific subprojects \nand components and of the overall Investment Program.  \n ", "  15   \n \n61.  In addition to regular reviews, including a midterm review for each loan, a detailed \nmidterm review of the Facility will be done 4 years after the first loan takes effect. The midterm \nreview for each loan under the Facility will be done in accordance with the implementation \nperiod  of  each  loan.  The  midterm  reviews  will  evaluate  in  detail  the  scope  of  the \nFacility/projects,  implementation  arrangements,  any  outstanding  issues,  environment  and \nresettlement as well as other safeguard issues, achievement of scheduled targets, contract \nmanagement progress, and other issues, as appropriate.  \nIV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impact  \n1.  Economic Analysis \n62.  The  economic  analysis  has  reviewed  (i)  the  economic  rationale  for  government \ninvolvement in the Investment Program, (ii) the goals of the Program, (iii) sector development \nplans, (iv) associated economic policies, (v) government capacity, (vi) the fiscal impact of the \nProgram, (vii) the economic risks associated with the Program, (viii) government commitment to \nthe Program, (ix) coordination of foreign aid, and (x) the conditions attached to the loan. The \neconomic rationale for government involvement is sound, as the Investment Program supports \nonly the basic urban services with monopolistic conditions, externality management, and impact \non  income  distribution.  The  goals  of  the  Investment  Program  are  consistent  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s goals of enhancing economic growth and reducing poverty, as clearly reflected in \nthe 10th FYP and other policy documents. The strategy of the Investment Program, which \ncombines  physical  investments  with  support  for  ongoing  urban  institutional  and  financial \nreforms,  conforms  fully  to  the  Government\u2019s  core  objective  of  linking  funding  to  improved \ninstitutional performance, as clearly stipulated in the 10th FYP and the recent Jawaharlal Nehru \nNational urban Renewal Mission Program. The scope of investments under the Investment \nProgram is based on growth strategies, city development plans prepared for some of the \nInvestment  Program  ULBs,  available  master  plans,  state  plans,  extensive  consultations \nreflecting  the  priorities  of  all  stakeholders,  demand  projections,  and  assessment  of  the \ninstitutional absorptive capacity to develop and sustain infrastructure assets.  \n \n63.  Each  urban  infrastructure  sector  supported  under  the  Investment  Program  has  its \nsector-specific goal, as stated in the Government of India\u2019s and the state government\u2019s sector \npolicy and guidelines, within the overall framework of the draft Rajasthan Urban Housing and \nHabitat Policy, 2007. Each Investment Program ULB must prepare a city-level infrastructure \nplan which proposes the most cost-effective way of meeting the sector goals and identifies \nsubprojects  to  be  undertaken  under  the  Investment  Program.  The  economic  subproject \nselection criteria under the Investment Program ensure that these identified subprojects are \neconomically viable, mostly by demonstrating an economic internal rate of return of not less \nthan 12%. The economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix D.   \n2.  Financial Analysis  \n64.  The financial analysis has appraised the sustainability and viability of the subprojects \nproposed  under  the  Investment  Program,  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and \nAnalysis of Projects, 2005. For revenue-generating sectors\u2014water supply, sewerage, and solid \nwaste management\u2014incremental revenue and cost due to the subprojects were estimated on a \n ", "16    \nwith- and without- project basis.20 Tariff revisions for water supply, and solid waste management \nare proposed to meet the Investment Program\u2019s institutional and financial reform action plan \nwhich is in accordance with the mandatory reforms under India\u2019s JNNURM signed in 2006. The \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) for water supply subprojects ranges from 8% to 14.5%, for \nsewerage subprojects from 1.2 to 11.8%, and for solid waste management subprojects from \n8.4% to 20%. Hence, except for the sewerage subproject in Alwar, all the subprojects have \nFIRRs above the weighted average cost of capital of 2.97%. The sensitivity analysis shows \nFIRRs that are generally robust and most sensitive to changes in revenues.  \n \n65.  For non-revenue-generating sectors\u2014urban drainage, urban transport and roads, social \ninfrastructure, and heritage support infrastructure\u2014the analysis focused on the capacity of the \nInvestment  Program  ULBs  to  sustain  the  assets  created  under  the  Program  by  providing \nfinancial resources for maintenance and debt service, if any. Financial projections of cash flow \nwere made over a 15-year period for the Investment Program ULBs, incorporating the impact of \nthe subprojects as well as the proposed reform. As part of the reform, the state abolished the \npoorly performing property tax in January 2007 and has substituted it with a broad based \ninfrastructure development tax to raise the financial resources of the ULBs which are dependent \non the state\u2019s grant and transfer. For the three sample Investment Program ULBs, the financial \nprojections show that the ULBs can absorb the investment in appraised subprojects, as they are \nexpected to have a revenue account surplus by 2013\u20132014 and a positive close balance for the \nrevenue account by the end of the projection period. The financial analysis is in Supplementary \nAppendix  E,  and  the  financial  management  assessment  of  the  EA  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix F. \n3.  Poverty Reduction and Social Development \n66.  The  Investment  Program  will  widen  access  to  better-quality,  sustainable  urban \ninfrastructure  and services in  the Investment  Program  ULBs.  Basic needs  provision, living \nconditions, and public health will all improve. There will also be broader benefits, including \neconomic growth and employment generation. Safe drinking water is a basic need that is not \neasily accessible to a significant number of poor people in the ULBs. According to baseline \nsurveys,21 piped water is accessible through household connections to 19% of those living in the \nslums of Jhalawar, and to 39% of those in slums in Alwar. Better access to water of better \nquality will also ease the burden of water collection (1 hour per day) on vulnerable segments of \nthe population, particularly for women. Low water connection fees (paid in installments) and \nlifeline tariffs will make drinking water more affordable to the poor. None of the slum areas in the \nthree sample ULBs have underground sewerage systems; only 7% of the households in those \nareas  reportedly  have  individual  toilets,  and  more  than  70%  resort  to  open  defecation. \nSewerage  networks  will  reach  the  boundaries  of  slum  areas  and  give  a  large  number  of \nhouseholds access to low-cost toilets. The collection and disposal of waste is highly irregular. In \nthe slum areas, more than 75% of the households dispose of waste along nearby roads. \nImprovements in sewage treatment, sanitation, and solid waste management will improve public \nhealth and reduce the burden of disease, treatment costs, and productivity losses, particularly \namong the poor. The urban road and cultural heritage components will benefit poor households \nthrough employment generation and access. The impact of improved urban services on the \nurban  poor  will be  monitored  closely  during project implementation.  The summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 9.  \n \n                                                 \n20 Since the Investment Program uses a phased approach, and not all the sector investment is included in the first \nloan,  the  appraisal  is  limited  to  those  subprojects  that  have  already  been  identified  and  are  ready  for \nimplementation. \n21 Baseline surveys were conducted in the three sample towns, namely, Alwar, Jaisalmer, and Jhalawar.  \n ", "  17   \n67.  Community  development  is  a  key  objective  of  the  slum  improvement  component. \nCommunity  development  programs  in  poor  communities,  to  be  implemented  through \nnongovernment organizations, will focus on health and environmental sanitation awareness, \nlow-cost sanitation infrastructure, and the organization of self-help groups. The Investment \nProgram is expected to benefit women by reducing their burden of water collection, improving \nhealth benefits, and increasing employment opportunities.  \n4.  Social and Environmental Safeguards \n68.  Social. The Facility is designed to minimize land acquisition and resettlement impact. \nSubprojects involving rehabilitation will be accommodated within the existing facilities\u2019 premises \nand will not involve land acquisition and resettlement. Subprojects involving the construction of \nwater supply and sanitation and sewerage systems, drainage and landslip protection, and solid \nwaste management improvements are proposed on vacant government land wherever possible. \nThe overall impact will be further minimized through careful subproject siting and alignment \nduring detailed design and subproject implementation. A resettlement framework (RF) was \nprepared on the basis of national laws; the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (amended in 1984); the \nNational Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation for Project Affected Persons, 2003; and \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). To guide the implementation of subprojects, the \nRF outlines the objectives, policy, principles, and procedures for land acquisition (if required), \ncompensation, and other assistance measures for affected persons. The implementation of the \nresettlement plans will be monitored by the IPIU with assistance from the IPMU (for internal \nmonitoring)  and  an  independent  agency  appointed  by  the  EA  (for  external  monitoring).  A \nsummary  of  the  RF  is  in  Appendix  10  and  a  full  RF  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  G. \nResettlement plans (RPs) will be prepared for Facility subprojects on the basis of the RF. \nSubprojects with significant22 impact require full RPs, while subprojects with insignificant impact \nwill require short RPs. The RPs will ensure that the socioeconomic conditions, needs, and \npriorities  of  vulnerable  groups  are  identified  and  that  the  process  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement does not disadvantage these groups. Short RPs have already been prepared for \ntranche 1 subprojects (Supplementary Appendix H). \n  \n69.  In  all  cities,  initial  screening  shows  no  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  (IPs). \nEnvironmental and public health benefits will accrue to the whole population covered by the \nProgram. The likelihood of subprojects affecting IPs is small, and any likely impact is addressed \nin the RPs. Further, subproject design prioritizes rehabilitation over the construction of basic \nsocial  infrastructure,  thus  avoiding  land  acquisition  and  consequent  resettlement,  and \nsubproject siting in built-up areas. An indigenous peoples development framework has been \nformulated (see Supplementary Appendix I) to ensure that appropriate indigenous peoples \ndevelopment plans or specific actions are prepared to enable equal sharing of Investment \nProgram benefits in future subprojects with impact on indigenous peoples. \n \n70.  Environmental. The Facility is designed to maximize environmental and public health \nbenefits. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) conducted for the Program show that net \nenvironmental benefits are positive and large including: more and better-quality drinking water \nfrom water supply subprojects; better public health, particularly fewer waterborne diseases \nthrough water supply, sewerage, drainage, and solid waste management investments; improved \naesthetics as a result of the sewerage, drainage, and solid waste management works; reduced \nflooding  through  drainage  improvements;  reduced  exposure  to  suspended  particulates  and \nnoise pollution through the urban transport and road components; and social benefits from the \nslum improvement and civic infrastructure outputs. Any negative impact during construction and \n                                                 \n22 Resettlement is significant when it has a major impact on 200 or more people. Major impact is defined as physical \ndisplacement from housing or loss of 10% or more of productive, income-generating assets. \n ", "18    \noperation  will  not  be  significant  because  larger  facilities  will  be  built  in  low-density  and \nnonsensitive areas, the works are generally small in scale and quickly constructed, and simple \ntechnologies with low maintenance requirements will have preference (Appendix 11; IEEs for \ntranche 1 subprojects in Supplementary Appendix J). \n \n71.  The  environmental  subproject  selection  criteria  ensure  that  the  projects  under  the \nFacility  will  have  no  significant  negative  environmental  impact,  and  no  impact  on \nenvironmentally sensitive areas. Subprojects with significant and permanent impact will be \nrejected. The potential negative environmental impact is mostly localized and temporary, and \ncan largely be avoided through proper subproject design (particularly in siting), or mitigated \nthrough  proper  mitigation  measures  and  environmental  management.  The  environmental \nassessment and review framework, which will ensure the compliance of future subprojects with \nthe environmental guidelines and requirements of the Government of India and the government \nof Rajasthan, and with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and guidelines, is in Supplementary \nAppendix K. \nB.  Risks \n72.  The effectiveness of the infrastructure to be developed under the Investment Program \ndepends on the ownership and commitment of the state of Rajasthan and the Investment \nProgram ULBs. The State and the ULBs must be committed to institutional change and financial \nreforms, and particularly to cost recovery and the long-term sustainability of the assets and \nservices. There must be sustained political will to increase tariffs and implement service charges \nor property taxes in order to achieve cost recovery within a reasonable time. Therefore, a key \nrisk is that the Investment Program ULBs will not have enough revenues to manage and \nmaintain the existing and newly acquired assets properly and may be forced to minimize costs \nthrough inappropriate operations. The government of Rajasthan and the ULBs are committed to \nmaximizing local revenue and providing an adequate operation and maintenance budget for \nasset sustainability. The government of Rajasthan has prepared a transition plan for transfer of \nassets from PHED to ULBs, and has introduced an infrastructure development tax. The ULBs \nare thus expected to take over the responsibilities for urban service provision gradually as the \nassets are transferred to them and they obtain the resources and revenues to adequately \nmanage the assets. \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n73.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government of India and the government of \nRajasthan have given the following assurances, which have been incorporated in the FFA, and \nwill be incorporated in the individual loan agreements as applicable, subject to any amendment \nto be mutually agreed on by the Government of India, government of Rajasthan and ADB. \n \n(i)  The government of Rajasthan will make available sufficient counterpart funds \nfrom  its  budget  for  each  fiscal  year,  in  a  timely  manner,  for  the  efficient \nimplementation of the Investment Program and the Facility toward its contribution \nand that of the ULBs.  \n(ii)  The government of Rajasthan will ensure adequate funds toward the operation \nand maintenance of the facilities created under the Facility through budgetary \nallocations  or  other  means,  to  be  provided  to  the  Executing  Agency,  the \nappropriate ULB, or line agencies during and after subproject completion. \n(iii)  The Government of India will make available to the government of Rajasthan the \nproceeds of the financing provided by ADB.  \n ", "  19   \n(iv)  The government of Rajasthan will on-lend the loan proceeds to the ULBs under \nthe appropriate on-lending arrangements. \n(v)  The  government  of  Rajasthan  will  ensure  that  for  each  of  the  Investment \nProgram  ULBs,  the  institutional  and  financial  improvement  action  plan \n(Appendix 12 of the RRP) is implemented on schedule.  \n(vi)  The government of Rajasthan will ensure that the contractual documents under \nany  PPP  modality,  in  particular  extended  O&M,  build-operate-transfer,  or \nperformance-based management contracts, as applicable, are provided to ADB \nfor prior review and approval in order to be used under the individual subprojects. \n(vii)  The government of Rajasthan will ensure that all ULBs and subprojects therein \nare selected, processed, and implemented in accordance with Appendix 6 of the \nRRP and schedule 5 of the FFA (on safeguard compliances) as further detailed \nin the FFA.   \n(viii)  The  government  of  Rajasthan  will  ensure  that  90%  customer  metering  is \nachieved in the relevant ULBs within 3 years of the completion of water supply \nsubprojects in the ULBs concerned.  \n(ix)  The government of Rajasthan will ensure that the PHED/ULB sets up a separate \naccounting system for water supply and sewerage for the ULB before the start of \nworks on any water supply subproject in the ULB. \n(x)  For urban transport and road subprojects, prior to commencement of civil works, \nthe ULB will have prepared a city wide traffic and transportation plan.  \n(xi)  The government of Rajasthan will ensure that domestic waste is segregated from \nindustrial,  medical,  and  hazardous  waste  in  ULBs  where  solid  waste \nmanagement subprojects are being implemented under the Facility, to be treated \nseparately  according  to  the  prescribed  system  in  the  Municipal  Solid  Waste \nManagement and Handling Rules, 2000 of the Government of India.   \n(xii)  The government of Rajasthan will ensure that civil works contracts under the \nFacility  follow  all  applicable  labor  laws  of  the  Government  of  India  and  the \ngovernment of Rajasthan and that these further include provisions to the effect \nthat  contractors;  (i)  carry  out  HIV/AIDS  awareness  programs  for  labor;  and \ndisseminate information at worksites on risks of sexually transmitted diseases \nand HIV/AIDS as part of health and safety measures for those employed during \nconstruction;  and  (ii)  follow  and  implement  all  statutory  provisions  on  labor \n(including not employing or using children as labor, equal pay for equal work), \nhealth, safety, welfare, sanitation, and working condition. Such contracts shall \nalso include clauses for termination by the government of Rajasthan or the EA in \ncase of any breach of the stated provisions by the contractors.  \n(xiii)  Approval of the second PFR that may be submitted by India would be subject to \nreview by ADB of the progress in implementing the water tariff reform in those \nULBs  that  have  introduced  the  revised  water  tariffs  in  September  2007, \naccording to the institutional and financial improvement action plan (Appendix 12 \nof the RRP).  \n \nVI.

Urban Development and Current Sector Performance \n \n1.  Formed only in 1956, Rajasthan had a late start in development and with relatively slow \ngrowth in the 1960s and 1970s lagged further behind the other Indian states. But Rajasthan \nstarted to close the development gap in the 1980s, and growth rates accelerated sharply, \nreaching 6.2% in 1980\u20132000, one of the highest among Indian states; poverty fell significantly, \nfrom 27% in 1994 to 15% in 2000, and several human development indicators1 showed notable \nimprovements. The high growth rates were driven by rapid growth in industry and services, \nwhich created a  more diversified economy  and lowered volatility;  investments in irrigation, \nelectricity, and road connectivity; and an increase in human capital. Since then, however, the \nstate\u2019s growth performance has faltered, threatening the progress made over the last 7 years. \nSince 2000, annual growth rates have fluctuated significantly, from 9.4% in 2003 to -6.5% in \n2004 and 1.5% in 2005, indicating increasing economic volatility. Three droughts in the past 5 \nyears, rapidly depleting groundwater levels, and falling investment rates have all contributed to \ndecelerating growth. While the growth rate has picked up in recent years, to 5% in 2006 and 8% \nin 2007, the state is determined to revive growth and close the development gap.  \n \n2.  The level of urbanization (24% in the 2001 census) in the state is less than that of India \nas a whole (28%), but the urban population grew rapidly in the 1990s (2.7%) because of high \nnatural  growth  rates  and  rural  migration.  The  2001  census  of  India  expected  the  level  of \nurbanization to increase to 26% by 2012, and the 222 urban towns in the state to increase to \n230 by 2012. The majority of the urban population (57%) is concentrated in 20 towns, each with \na population of more than 100,000. Future population growth rates are projected to decline but \nwill remain high. The population of the 15 initially identified urban local bodies (ULBs) to be \nfunded under the Investment Program ranges from 75,133 (Karauli) to 286,853 (Alwar).2 From \nthe 2001 census figures, population growth in the Investment Program ULBs is expected to \nrange from 2% to 7% per year over the next decade. As population shifts from rural to urban \nareas in pursuit of economic opportunities, more and more slums are emerging in the urban \nareas: more than 20% of the urban population currently lives in slums. A survey conducted in \nthree Investment Program ULBs3 showed that the percentage of slum population ranged from \n4% in Jhalawar-Jhalapatan and 7% in Alwar to 27% in Jaisalmer.  \n  \n3.  An assessment of urban infrastructure and service conditions undertaken during the \npreparation of the Investment Program road map indicated that urban services, including water \nsupply, sanitation, drainage, solid waste management, urban transport, and roads, are grossly \ninadequate in the towns. According to the state\u2019s water policy, the goal is to provide the entire \npopulation with potable water supply within 150 meters from their premises within the next 10 \nyears. The guidelines of the Government of India\u2019s Central Public Health Environmental and \nEngineering  Organization  on  the  Ministry  of  Urban  Development  prescribe  a  water  supply \nservice level of 100\u2013175 liters per capita per day (lpcd)4 depending on the size of the towns, \nwith continuous supply, adequate water pressure, and satisfactory water quality. According to \nthe 2001 census, about 20% of urban households have no water supply within their premises, \n                                                 \n1  The human development index for Rajasthan improved from 0.347 in 1991 (11th rank) to 0.424 in 2001 (9th rank). \nAlthough Rajasthan has ranked steadily higher over the last three decades, its present rank is still below the \nnational Index value and quite low among the major states of India.   \n2  The population of the Investment Program towns in 2006 was as follows: Alwar 286,853, Barab-Chhabra 96,798, \nBarmer 92,203, Bharatpur 229,807, Bundi 94,593, Chittaurgarh 105,212, Churu 108,014, Dhaulpur 110,157, \nJaisalmer 69,894, Jhalawar 48,054 (in 2001), Jhalapatan 30,103 (in 2001), Karauli 75,133, Nagaur 100,077, \nRajsamand 59,391, Sawai-Madhopur 113,545, and Sikar 199,084.  \n3  Alwar, Jaisalmer, and Jhalawar-Jhalapatan. \n4  Per capita water supply in the 222 towns in the state varies as follows: 40% receive less than 60 liters per capita \nper day (lpcd), 36% receive 60\u201380 lpcd, 14% receive 80\u2013100 lpcd, and only 10% receive more than 100 lpcd.  \n ", " 26  Appendix 2 \nand 80% of the population with access to piped water receives less than 80 lpcd. The rest get \ntheir drinking water through hand-pumps (10%), and from tube wells and open wells (10%). \nDuring the 7 years of Investment Program implementation, the specific target for the Program \nULBs is an increase in piped water supply coverage to 90% of the 1.4 million or so households \nin the 15 Program ULBs and a reduction of unaccounted-for water to 20% of total supply in all \nparts of the system.  \n \n4.  Under the wastewater management and sanitation policy of the state, the goal is to \nprovide the entire population with basic sanitation facilities within their premises within 10 years. \nCurrently, about 70% of urban households have access to in-house sanitation facilities, while \n24% (predominantly from poor households) resort to open defecation.  \n \n5.  In urban drainage, the goal of the state is to minimize flood risks, surface water pollution, \nand  damage  to  urban  roads  through  the  development  of  adequate  storm-water  drainage \nfacilities in the cities and towns. Each ULB is required to prepare a comprehensive drainage \nmaster plan that shows the optimal design and network and identifies the priority areas, with the \nnumber  of  beneficiaries,  the  probability  of  flooding,  and  the  proportion  of  slum  and  poor \nresidents. According to the 2001 census, 56% of the urban population has access to open \ndrainage, and only 24% to closed drainage.  \n \n6.  In  solid  waste  management,  the  goal  is  to  have  all  properties  covered  by  waste \ncollection services and to meet the provisions of Municipal Solid Waste Rules (MSWR), 2000, of \nIndia,  which  prescribes  compliance  criteria  for  the  collection,  segregation,  storage, \ntransportation, and disposal of municipal solid waste. The state also declared a policy for the \nmanagement of solid waste and biomedical waste, consistent with the MSWR. At present, less \nthan 50% of solid waste is collected, house-to-house services are available to only 35% of \nhouseholds, and there is little or no provision for the collection and disposal of hazardous waste. \nMore  than  80%  of  the  towns  do  not  have  engineered  sanitary  landfills  and  proper  waste \nmanagement facilities.  \n \n7.  In transport and roads, the policy of the state is to improve operational efficiencies \nthrough the construction of new roads and roads over bridges at crucial traffic points, the \nupgrading of selected roads and pedestrian facilities, and the provision of parking spaces and \npublic transport terminals as identified in the traffic management plan of the ULBs. Urban roads \nin the state are in poor condition. The road network and parking spaces are insufficient to meet \nthe traffic volume, which has increased significantly in the last decade. The growth in road \nnetwork  capacity  is  not  commensurate  with  increased  traffic  demand;  the  roads  are  often \ncongested with traffic. The congestion is worsened by poor road conditions and the absence of \neffective management and enforcement measures.  \n \nB.  Urban Institutional Framework  \n \n8.  The  Urban  Governance  Department  (UGD)  oversees  urban  development  and  local \nself-governance in the state\u2019s ULBs. The UGD comprises: (i) the Urban Development and \nHousing Department (UDHD), which oversees the functions of the Chief Town Planner\u2019s Office, \nJaipur Development Authority, Rajasthan Housing Board, and nine urban improvement trusts; \nand (ii) the Local Self Government Department (LSGD), which oversees the functions of the \nDirectorate of Local Bodies (DLB), three municipal corporations, 11 municipal councils, 39 \nmunicipal boards (category 2), 58 municipal boards (category 3), and 72 municipal boards \n(category 4). The DLB is the municipal administration arm of the LSGD and it oversees the \nadministrative functions related to local self-governance, as well as the Integrated Housing and \nSlum Development Investment Program and the solid waste management action plan, among \nothers.

Weak  urban  management  systems  are  responsible  for  poor  performance  in  urban \nplanning and provision of services. The development of dedicated urban local authorities is still \nat  an  early  stage,  and  effective  urban  management  is  constrained  by  the  multiplicity  of \ninstitutions  with  overlapping  responsibilities.  The  functions/responsibilities  of  the  ULBs  are \ngenerally confined to solid waste management and minor roads. The ULBs have no control over \nthe important basic services of water supply and sanitation. Water supply and sanitation is \nprovided by the government of Rajasthan (GoR)\u2019s State Public Health Engineering Department \n(PHED). Town planning and land development is a function assigned to the State authorities as \nwell as to the ULBs. These functions, currently under the Government of Rajasthan are being \ndevolved to the ULBs.  \n \nC.  Government Policies  \n \n1.  National \n10.  The 10th Five-Year Plan (FYP) for 2002\u20132007 of the Government of India recognizes \nthat the quality of urban governance and service delivery systems has a vital effect on the pace \nof urban development. The 10th FYP supports a two-pronged approach, which links funds for \ncapital investments to urban governance, finance, and service delivery reforms. The 10th FYP\u2019s \nmain reference for reform is the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1994, which creates an \nenabling framework for ULBs to play a pivotal role in urban service delivery and to be equipped \nwith  the  necessary  financial  and  administrative  powers  and  capacities.  With  the  recently \nannounced  Jawarharlal  Nehru  National  Urban  Renewal  Mission  (JNNURM)  and  its \nsubcomponent the Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns \n(UIDSSMT),  the  Government  of  India  has  reaffirmed  its  commitment  to  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment by setting aside sizable funds for fast-track investments in cities, subject to the \nimplementation of a range of reforms in those cities. JNNURM and UIDSSMT reiterate the need \nfor the states to empower ULBs to reform the levy of user charges, enhance property tax, \nrationalize establishment costs, and improve financial management systems. It also advocates \nbalancing asset creation with asset management, incorporating private sector efficiencies into \nservice delivery, and making service providers financially sustainable. \n \n11.  The Government of India has also taken an integrated approach to poverty alleviation by \ncombining the National Slum Development Investment Program and Valmiki Ambedkar Awas \nYojana (VAMBAY) under the subcomponent the Integrated Housing and Slum Development \nInvestment Program, providing shelters and basic urban facilities in selected slum areas. \n \n2.  Rajasthan \n12.  The 11th FYP (2007\u20132012) of the state projected an 8% growth rate for the economy \nand focused on four basic themes: high growth, equitable growth, human development, and \nreforms.  With  80%  of plan  allocation  targeting  social  expenditure,  the  11th  FYP  aimed  at \nreducing poverty by improving access to education, health care, potable water, and sanitation. It \nalso focused on good governance as a crosscutting issue and recognized the declining role of \ngovernment  in  the  provision  of  services,  with  emphasis  on  developing  private  enterprise \nparticipation in public service delivery and providing an improved regulatory environment. The \n10th  FYP  program  for  urban  development  comprised  the  planning  and  monitoring  of \ndevelopment works under the national capital region, the Integrated Development of Small and \nMedium Towns program, housing (particularly for the economically weaker groups), poverty \nalleviation programs, and the Rajasthan Urban Infrastructure Development Project. The Public \n ", "Appendix 2  29 \n \nHealth Engineering Department (PHED) had a budget of Rs5,558 million for the 10th FYP \nperiod, and spent Rs9,173 million.5  \n \n13.  The state government\u2019s 11th FYP, for 2007\u20132012, gives emphasis to addressing the \nneeds of the rapidly developing urban population, in particular to strengthening and managing \nurban infrastructure, and implementing urban governance reforms. It identifies the key problems \nin the urban area as (i) poor infrastructure; (ii) need for development in slum areas; (iii) poor \nmanagement  of  cultural  heritage;  (iv)  growing  urban  poverty;  (v)  increase  in  pollution  and \ndepletion in groundwater resources; (vi) lack of financial resources for the ULBs; (vii) congestion \nin class 1 urban towns; and (viii) lack of a comprehensive legal framework for the planning, \ndevelopment, and implementation of projects and schemes. It provides for the following:  \n \n(i)  Urban  development.  Urban  development  and  local  self-government  with  an \noutlay of Rs1,517 million\u2014for urban planning, promotion of centrally sponsored \nschemes with emphasis on poverty alleviation, institutional and financial reforms \nthrough  the  State  Urban  Agenda  for  Rajasthan  program,  implementation  of \nlegislative  and  regulatory  frameworks,  training  and  capacity  building,  and \npromotion of public-private partnership frameworks including citizen participation \nin urban development. \n \n(ii)  Water supply. Water supply with an outlay of Rs40,767 million\u2014for water supply \nsystems  benchmarking,  tariff  restructuring,  continuous  water  supply  and \nconsumer metering, water recycling/reuse and conservation, more reliable water \nsupply  and  increased  customer  satisfaction,  and  institutional  and  financial \nreforms leading to better service delivery.  \n \n3.  Ongoing Sector Reforms  \n \n14.  In  accordance  with  urban  policy  framework  of  the  Government  of  India  and  the \ngovernment of Rajasthan, key urban sector reforms are already being initiated by the state, \nincluding land and regulatory reforms,6 and accounting reforms including (i) the adoption of the \nGovernment of India\u2019s National Accounting Manual and the announcement of the State Policy \non Accounting Reforms, 2004; (ii) the scheduled conversion of the accounting systems of 183 \nULBs  to  double-entry  accounting;  and  (iii)  the  launch  of  the  E-Nagar  Mitra  Project,7  an \ne-governance  and  accounting  reform  initiative.  Financial  reforms  include  (i) substitution  of \nproperty tax and land bank management; (ii) revenue-enhancing measures; (iii) promotion of \npublic-private  partnerships  and  citizen  participation  in  urban  development,8  addressing  the \nneeded professionalization of services; and (iv) provision of access for ULBs to institutional \nfinance through the Rajasthan Urban Development Fund (RUDF).9 \n                                                 \n5  The state suffered a drought during the 10th FYP period (from 2002 to 2004) but the PHED undertook significant \nefforts to provide water to all urban centers. Major projects comprised water supply reorganization, rehabilitation, \nand augmentation in almost 50% of the urban centers. \n6  The following bills are being considered: (i) Rajasthan Municipalities Bill, 2005; (ii) Rajasthan Prevention of \nDefacement of Properties Bill, 2006; and (iii) Rajasthan Heritage Conservation Bill, 2006.  \n7  Recognizing the success of Lok Mitra (one-stop utility service payment in urban centers of Jaipur, Ajmer, Bikaner, \nand Udaipur) and Jan Mitra (rural service delivery system), the IT Department is now designing an ambitious \nproject called E-Nagar Mitra. This project seeks to integrate the features of Lok Mitra and Jan Mitra, and will bring \ntogether various services offered by different departments and provide a unified e-services platform, minimizing the \ninteraction points for citizens. More than 60 departmental services will be provided through the project\u2019s counters. \n8  A  subgroup  on  urban  governance  in  the  Economic  Policy  and  Reform  Council  is  currently  reviewing: \n(i) public-private partnerships and citizen participation in urban development; (ii) the solid waste management \naction plan; and (iii) housing policy and institutional finance. \n9  The  government  of  Rajasthan,  through  the  Local  Self  Government  Department,  established  the  RUDF  in \nNovember 2006 to address the need to attract large fund flows into the urban development sector. RUDF is \npositioned to facilitate the development and financing of urban infrastructure in the state\u2019s ULBs. Created under the \n ", " 30  Appendix 2 \n \n15.  The state government has also been building partnerships with the private sector and \ncivil society, particularly through the Economic Policy and Reforms Council (EPRC) set up in \n2004.  The  EPRC,  comprising  the  chief  executive  officers  of  leading  corporations,  human \nresource  development  specialists,  and  economists,  has  prepared  an  important  agenda  of \nreforms. The reforms are intended to attract private investment, enhance the capabilities of the \nlabor  force  through  human  development,  build  infrastructure,  and  improve  fiscal  health  to \nprovide  resources  for  development.  Although  the  government  of  Rajasthan  has  begun \nimplementing several of these reforms, much remains to be done and there is a need to set \npriorities. \n \nD.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s overall strategic direction in India has been to assist the country in promoting \nefficient and sustainable economic growth to increase employment opportunities and reduce \npoverty. By supporting the development of urban infrastructure, providing long-term funds for \nhousing finance, and developing sustainable mechanisms for the delivery of social services, \nADB is increasingly integrating social welfare concerns into its strategy. Through its technical \nassistance and lending investment programs, ADB also promotes policy reform measures to \naddress the legal, institutional, and financial problems facing India\u2019s urban sector. These reform \nmeasures will liberalize India\u2019s land and housing markets to attract more private investments. \nADB\u2019s urban sector assistance emphasizes capacity building and institutional strengthening \ninitiatives to promote sustainable urban management. \n \n17.  Over the medium term, ADB\u2019s urban sector strategy for India calls for continued support \nfor integrated urban development projects in an effort to improve the urban environment and \nliving conditions, especially of the urban poor, and to strengthen the capacity of ULBs to \nimplement projects and deliver services. Further, urban projects in India are demand-driven, \nwith  key  criteria  being the  ULBs\u2019 willingness to  initiate  policy  reform  measures as  part  of \nADB-financed projects. The absorptive capacity of ULBs is reflected in the overall design of \nintegrated urban development projects. The strategy also emphasizes the importance of using \nprojects as a means of gaining valuable local experience for improving project implementation \nand  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  capabilities.  Thus,  to  the  extent  possible,  project \nexecution  should  be  through  existing  institutions,  particularly  ULBs.  ADB-funded  integrated \nurban development projects are also used to introduce and implement different cost recovery \nmechanisms and privatization measures, especially for water supply subprojects, to ensure \nfinancial sustainability. ADB\u2019s sector strategy gives importance to incorporating in investment \nprograms appropriately designed plans for building community awareness and participation. \nInnovative approaches to community and beneficiary participation, particularly by low-income \nhouseholds, are recognized as essential for sustainable and replicable projects. The focus on \nthe urban poor goes beyond infrastructure: a holistic approach to meeting their needs and \nempowering them to improve their own living conditions is prescribed, including the use of self-\nhelp schemes and the careful application of cross-subsidies. \n \nE.  External Assistance to the Urban Sector in Rajasthan \n \n18.  There have so far been only a few large-scale external assistance projects in the urban \nsector of Rajasthan. The ongoing ADB-financed project, the Rajasthan Urban Infrastructure \n                                                                                                                                                          \nIndian Trust Act, 1882, RUDF was formed with an initial Rs50 million and is currently managed by the Rajasthan \nUrban Infrastructure Finance and Development Corporation, an asset management company and a state-owned \npublic sector unit.  \n ", "Appendix 2  31 \n \nDevelopment Project (RUIDP),10 is the first major external assistance to Rajasthan. Its objective \nis to optimize social and economic development in urban Rajasthan by facilitating policy reforms \nthat  will  strengthen  urban  management,  and  by  supporting  priority  investments  in  urban \ninfrastructure and services to meet basic human needs, improve the quality of life, and stimulate \nsustainable  social  and  economic  development.  Policy  reforms  include  (i)  local  resource \ngeneration and improved municipal management, (ii) improved cost recovery for water supply, \n(iii) capacity building for municipal government, (iv) establishment of an urban infrastructure \ndevelopment and finance facility, and (v) community participation. Additionally, RUIDP covers \nthe provision of urban services in water supply and sanitation, solid waste and wastewater \nmanagement,  slum  and  environmental  improvement,  transport,  heritage  conservation, \nstrengthening of firefighting services, and other civic services. RUIDP is being implemented in \nsix ULBs\u2014Jaipur, Ajmer, Udaipur, Kota, Bikaner, and Jodhpur\u2014and has earned a satisfactory \nrating  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Financial  Information  System11  report.  ADB  also  provided  technical \nassistance12 for the preparation of the proposed Investment Program and the detailed design of \nsome subprojects to jump-start the implementation of the Investment Program. \n \n19.  The Rajasthan Health Systems Development Project (RHSDP)13 funded by the World \nBank involves the upgrading and renovation of district hospitals, public health centers, and \ndivisional  headquarters  hospitals;  the  provision  of  medical  equipment;  training  for  medical \nofficials; and an information, education, and communication program. The RHSDP is being \nimplemented in all the districts of Rajasthan. It is being implemented in the ULBs of Tonk, \nBaran,  Jhalawar,  Dausa,  Dhaulpur,  Churu,  and  Bundi.  The  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation is supporting the Jaipur Water Supply from Bisalpur Dam Project,14 which involves \nthe main lines, pumping stations, reservoirs, and water supply systems of Jaipur city, among \nother  things.  The  European  Commission  is  supporting  the  European  Commission  State \nPartnership Program (ECSPP).15 The ECSPP is focused on water management including the \nmanagement of surface water and groundwater. ADB is providing technical assistance16 to India \nfor  mainstreaming  Public-Private  Partnership  (PPP)  at  central  and  state  levels.  The  TA  is \nmobilizing  existing  resources  in  the  Government  in  support  of  PPP  in  infrastructure \ndevelopment. Under this TA, a PPP cell has been established in Rajasthan. \n                                                 \n10 The total project cost is $250 million.

Compared with other infrastructure sectors in India, the urban sector provides a unique \nopportunity for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to make a direct contribution to achieving \nthe  Millennium  Development  Goals  through  extensive  improvements  in  basic  urban  social \nservices to urban dwellers, including the urban poor. Besides their most evident impact\u2014\nimproved living conditions and quality of life for urban dwellers\u2014such projects have longer-term \neconomic benefits arising from the overall improvement in living conditions.  \n \n2.  To the state executing agencies, ADB assistance is much more than filling the gap in \nfunding for the construction or rehabilitation of urban infrastructure. The assistance gives the \nstate governments the opportunity to (i) get long-term capacity development support during \nproject  implementation  (5\u20137  years);  (ii)  apply  more  transparency  and  higher  standards  in \nprocurement;  and  (iii)  focus  on  adequate  operation  and  maintenance  of  urban  services, \nensuring the sustainability of urban projects.  \n \n3.  The goal of improving basic urban services has been translated into actions through \nmostly  integrated  urban  projects  combining  infrastructure  development  and  environmental \nimprovements  with  targeted  poverty  reduction,  urban  institutional  reforms,  and  capacity \ndevelopment. Despite the noble goal, however, the implementation of urban projects has not \nbeen without problems. In fact, significant delays have been common because integrated urban \ndevelopment  projects  are  inherently  complex  and  their  implementation  requires  close \ncoordination between several agencies, enhanced institutional capacity, and public support. The \nresulting  time  and  cost  overruns  have  been  found  to  be  too  costly,  despite  the  proven \nadvantage  of  the  integrated  design  of  urban  projects.  As  a  result,  a  new  framework  was \ndeveloped  and  agreed  for  stronger  ownership  of  the  projects  by  the  state  and  municipal \ngovernments at an early stage of project design and implementation. The new framework \nincludes up-front capacity development of implementing agencies and institutional strengthening \nof state line departments to reduce start-up delays and strengthen the focus on integrating \nlessons  learned  from  earlier  urban  development  projects.  The  key  lessons  learned  and \nmeasures included in the Investment Program design are summarized below.  \n \n4.  Longer-Term Assistance. It is difficult to achieve the intended impact, especially in \nurban governance and management improvement, through a single intervention. ADB projects \nhave been instrumental in building stronger state nodal agencies in the urban sector. For \nexample, the Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation, an executing \nagency  for  two  ADB-financed  projects,  emerged  as  a  nodal  agency  for  the  development, \nfinancing, and implementation of urban projects. It prepared the third loan from ADB without \nproject preparatory technical assistance. Similarly, the project management unit of Rajasthan \nUrban Infrastructure Development Project (RUIDP) I can now carry out most of the advance \nactions for the Investment Program without detailed supervision from ADB. To be effective, ADB \nassistance should be made over a longer term, through successive loans to the beneficiary \nstate.  \n  \n5.  Start-Up Delays. As indicated earlier, there were abnormal delays in initial activities by \nthe executing agencies (EAs) during the project start-up period. It was apparent that the support \nof consultants would be required not just during detailed engineering design and supervision but \nalso  during  project  preparation.  Earlier,  in  the  absence  of  retroactive  financing,  state \ngovernments  had  to  wait  for  the  loans  to  be  signed  and  take  effect  before  mobilizing \nconsultants. For this very reason, under RUIDP, it took 18 months to appoint loan consultants \nafter loan signing. Such initial delays in the appointment of consultants considerably affects \nsubsequent  project  implementation  since  the  preparation  of  generic  prequalification  and \nstandard bidding documents, detailed engineering surveys, and preparation of specific tender \ndocuments take place only after the loan consultants are in place. As a result, in the case of \n ", "Appendix 3  33 \n \nRUIDP, it took another year after the appointment of the consultants, or more than 2.5 years \nafter the loan was signed, to award the first major civil works contract.  \n \n6.  To overcome these start-up delays, extensive discussions and reviews were carried out \nin 2003\u20132004 for urban sector projects in India. On the borrower\u2019s side, it was agreed that a \ndedicated  project  management  unit  would  be  set  up  during  project  appraisal.  Unlike \nexperienced national agencies such as the National Highway Authority of India or other central \npublic sector undertakings, state governments and local urban bodies do not have dedicated \nproject management units at the time of project appraisal. ADB for its part agreed to provide \nsupport to the EAs in: (i) establishing project management and implementation units far ahead \nof loan effectiveness; (ii) strengthening the managerial and institutional capabilities of such \nunits; (iii) assisting in the preparation of tender documents, the selection of consultants, and the \nprequalification of contractors; (iv) familiarizing project staff with ADB policies and procedures; \nand (v) ensuring a strong sense of ownership by the state and municipal governments, and \npromoting public participation. Therefore, a bridging technical assistance (TA), advance actions, \nand  the  strengthening  of  institutions  responsible  for  project  implementation  have  been \nincorporated in the Investment Program to avoid start-up delays.  \n \n7.  Project Readiness. Project readiness, in terms of not only the advance setting up and \nstaffing of the project management unit and project implementation units but also actions toward \nthe attainment of land and regulatory clearances for the sites, is very important for the speedy \nimplementation of projects. Of particular concern is land acquisition, which is normally the \nprimary cause of delay in implementing urban infrastructure projects. Under  RUIDP, great \ndifficulties  in  land  acquisition  were  experienced  during  implementation,  particularly  for  the \nsewage treatment plants (STPs). For instance, due to legal issues related to land acquisition, \nthe  STP  in  Udaipur  had  to  be  dropped  from  the  project.  Similarly,  the  implementation  of \nactivities in Ajmer was substantially delayed by land acquisition for the STP. Similarly, the \nprocess of obtaining statutory and other approvals from concerned authorities, such as the \npollution control boards and national highway or railway authorities, causes delays and hence \nneeds to begin before loan approval. Such actions have already started for the subprojects and \nsites  under  the  first  tranche  of  the  Investment  Program,  and  the  investment  program \nmanagement unit (IPMU) has been established as well. During preparation of the RUSDIP, the \nauthorities have displayed a considerable sense of ownership and reform momentum.  \n \n8.  Change in Scope. Urban development projects often undergo changes in scope to \nrespond to the evolving needs of the urban communities. Changes in scope, processing, and \npreparation in earlier projects in Rajasthan and Karnataka, particularly in the assessment of \ncompliance with safeguards, further delayed project implementation. Therefore, the scope of \neach  loan  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be  well  defined  in  close  consultation  with \nstakeholders.  \n \n9.  Tariff  Reforms.  Even  small  changes  generally  take  years  to  incorporate  in  tariff \nstructures and reforms, and there is a need for modest but focused incremental reforms. In \nparticular, policy changes such as increases in water supply and sewerage tariffs are likely to be \nmore acceptable if these are preceded by infrastructure development, improvement of services, \nand extensive stakeholder consultations. Under the Investment Program, the rationalization of \ntariffs  is  proposed  to  be  introduced  in  accordance  with  JNNURM  principles.  Additional \nawareness-raising campaigns will be undertaken and extensive stakeholder consultations will \ncontinue during the implementation of the Program.  \n \n10.  Market-Based  Cost  Estimates  and  Minimization  of  Contract  Packages.  Cost \nestimates in urban projects are generally based on the standard schedule of rates (SOR). The \nSOR, normally developed for much smaller works and not updated regularly, is therefore an \ninadequate foundation for estimating costs for large-scale urban infrastructure projects. As was \n ", " 34  Appendix 3 \nfound in RUIDP as well as other urban development projects, the prices obtained through \ncompetitive bidding can be significantly different from the cost estimates (by 35\u201375% in many \ncases), necessitating negotiation, cancellation and re-bidding, and repackaging. Therefore, it is \nproposed that a basic schedule of rates (BSR) based on the index of basic materials like \ncement, steel, and pipes, be prepared for the Investment Program. The BSR, to be updated \nevery  6  months  to  reflect  market fluctuations  and  inflation,  will  be used  in  preparing  cost \nestimates  for  the  subprojects  under  the  Program.  This  mechanism  of  reflecting  the  cost \nestimates on updated market based rates will facilitate implementation and the management of \ncontracts by reducing bid processing delays and the variations that are often observed in the \nimplementation of urban projects. Similarly, to minimize the number of contracts and maximize \ncontractor and market participation, measures such as combining the procurement of similar \nequipment (for example, bulk water meters, pump machineries, solid waste equipment) will be \ncentralized, and contract packages, such as the design and construction of sewage treatment \nplants, will be combined for neighboring urban local bodies (ULBs) eligible for funding under the \nInvestment Program. \n \n11.  Capacity Building of ULBs to Manage the Assets. Capacity building and staffing of \nULBs with enough resources to run and maintain the completed project facilities generally \nreceived limited attention. To address this issue and maximize the sustainability of assets \ncreated under the Investment Program, a draft institutional and capacity development plan \n(Supplementary Appendix N) has been prepared by the bridging TA consultants, and will be \nfurther developed by the IPMU with the support of loan consultants. Furthermore, the design of \nthe implementation structure of the Investment Program took into careful consideration the \nnumber of subsectors and subprojects, and the absorptive as well as implementation capacity of \nthe EA and the ULBs. \n \n12.  Focus on Stakeholder Involvement. Under RUIDP, the community action participation \nprogram (CAPP), which was to promote community awareness and the involvement of local \ncommunities in the project, did not start when the project was first implemented. Therefore, the \ncommunities did not participate in the planning, and felt excluded from the project benefits. \nFurthermore, community awareness activities should have focused more on advocacy, i.e., on \npayment  for  improved  service  facilities,  to  ensure  that  urban  dwellers  understood  the \nimportance of user charges for the sustainability of project activities. Finally, in RUIDP the \ncommunity  infrastructure  improvements  proposed  by  local  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs) took too long to be approved, such that most were never approved. The Investment \nProgram  design  includes  the  implementation  of  CAPP  activities  at  the  start  of  Program \nimplementation,  extensive  awareness-raising  activities  and  emphasis  has  been  placed  on \nsimplified procedures.  \n \n ", "     \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES, BY EXPENDITURE CATEGORY AND FINANCIER  \n($ million) \n        ADB    Government of Rajasthan \n        Foreign  Local        Foreign  Local     \nItem    Total  Exchange  Currency  Total  %    Exchange  Currency  Total  % \nA.

Selection of Urban Local Bodies \n \n1.  The basic principle for the selection of urban local bodies (ULBs) should be their potential to \nbecome an engine of growth in their district. There are 32 districts in the state of Rajasthan. The \noperational selection criteria used in the selection of ULBs for funding under the Rajasthan Urban \nSector Development Investment Program (the Investment Program) are as follows: \n \n(i)  The ULB contributes to the subproject no less than 10% of the related cost on \naverage. \n(ii)  The ULB is either the district headquarters of a district or a town with tourism \nimportance, which has been identified as such in the state\u2019s tourism policy or has \nmore than 50,000 tourist visitors yearly. \n(iii)  The population of the ULB is more than 50,000, except for twin towns sharing \nresources and management responsibilities for their urban services. \n(iv)  The ULB has signed a memorandum of understanding with the state government on \nthe implementation of the institutional and financial improvement action plan as \noutlined in Appendix 13.  \n \n2.  On the basis of the above criteria, 15 ULBs were initially selected for support under the \nInvestment Program, which include 4 municipal councils and 12 municipal boards of category 2.1 \nOther ULBs that meet the above selection criteria may be subsequently included in the Investment \nProgram if additional financial resources become available through budget savings. \n \nB.  Selection of Subprojects \n \n3.  The state, through the Executing Agency, will ensure that civil works for all subprojects will \nbe  synchronized  with  civil  works  for  sewerage,  water  supply  pipe  laying,  and  drainage  as \nappropriate. \n \n4.  In accordance with the objectives and targets set under the Investment Program, the \nsubprojects  eligible  for  financing  under  the  Investment  Program  will  have  the  following \ncomponents:2 (i) water supply; (ii) environmental sanitation, including wastewater management, \nsolid  waste  management,  and  urban  drainage;  (iii)  urban  transport  and  roads;  (iv)  social \ninfrastructure, including slum Improvements; and (v) infrastructure support for cultural heritage.  \n \n5.  Each ULB will prepare a city-level investment plan (CLIP), which may include all or some of \nthe foregoing components. The CLIP will be based on the following, among others: the current \nlevel of services, the needs and preferences of stakeholders, the financial and institutional capacity \nof the ULB, and the norms and standards prescribed by the state government and the Government \nof India. In selecting subprojects for each ULB, the following aspects should be checked and \nensured by Rajasthan\u2019s work finalization committee: \n \n(i)  The works proposed under the Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small \nand Medium Towns or any other scheme of the Government of India, and state \nschemes containing grant funding, should not be included under the Investment \nProgram. \n                                                 \n1  Municipal boards in ULBs with a population of 20,001\u2013100,000; municipal councils in ULBs with a population or more \nthan 100,000. \n2  The Facility will also cover implementation support, capacity development, and a community action participation \nprogram. There are no selection criteria for this institution-building component.  \n ", " 38  Appendix 6 \n(ii)  The line agencies or responsible authorities must have agreed to take over the \noperation and maintenance (O&M) assets created under the Investment Program, \nand to allocate an adequate budget for them. \n(iii)  The concerned line agencies must provide hindrance-free land to the Implementing \nAgency for the execution of works. \n(iv)  The proposed investment plans under the City Development Plan must demonstrate \nthat the ULB can mobilize the financial resources required for the O&M of all the \nassets under the ULB\u2019s mandate created under the Investment Program. \n(v)  The total cost of all the subprojects in each ULB should not exceed $250 per person \nbut can be higher in ULBs of tourism importance with a low population. \n(vi)  All subprojects must have prepared resettlement plans, if required, in accordance \nwith the resettlement framework of the Investment Program. \n(vii)  All subprojects must meet the environmental subproject selection guidelines (Annex \n1)  and  have  prepared  initial  environmental  examinations  and  environmental \nmonitoring  plans  with  adequate  budgets  in  accordance  with  the  environmental \nassessment and review framework of the Investment Program. \n(viii)  All  subprojects  must  have  prepared  indigenous  peoples  development  plans,  if \nrequired, in accordance with the indigenous peoples development framework of the \nInvestment Program. \n(ix)  Proposals related to the provision of urban services in notified slum areas must \npertain to areas (a) where residents have secure tenure; and (b) where natural \nhazards  such  as  landslides  or  flooding,  which  would  make  the  areas  more \nvulnerable, are unlikely. \n(x)  All  subprojects  must  have  been  selected  after  a  least-cost  analysis  of  options \nacceptable to ADB.  \n \nC.

Urban Transport and Roads \n10.  For urban transport and roads subprojects to be eligible for financing under the Investment \nProgram, the following criteria must be met. \n \n(i)  Roadworks are limited to major entry roads to the town, or roads that connect to \nmajor  highways,  arterial  roads,  bus  terminals,  railway  stations,  and  bypasses. \nNational highways are excluded. Internal roads are also not eligible. \n(ii)  The subprojects must be in line with the national urban transport policy of the \nGovernment of India. \n(iii)  Roads to be upgraded or built and junctions to be improved are those with an \naverage vehicle flow (AVF) of at least 3,000 vehicles a day, according to a traffic \nsurvey. But upgrading to concrete roads or construction of such roads may be \nallowed in areas that could be waterlogged or that have weak soil. \n(iv)  One bus stand per town may be included, on the basis of a needs analysis. \n(v)  Bridges will be included only if the demand for them is substantiated through a traffic \nsurvey, which shows an AVF of at least 3,000 vehicles a day. \n(vi)  Road widening involving land acquisition or resettlement will not be covered by the \nProgram, except as otherwise accepted by ADB and the government of Rajasthan \nand subject to compliance with the applicable safeguard policies and frameworks of \nADB and the laws and regulations of the Government of India and the government \nof Rajasthan. \n(vii)  Urban road and bridge civil works should have EIRRs of at least 12%. \n(viii)  Parking  lots  can  be  included  only  if  the  ULB\u2019s  traffic  plans  or  surveys  show \nsignificant congestion problems due to parking, and if the projected financial returns \nof the parking lot exceed 4%. \n(ix)  Subprojects  are  limited  to  those  that  were  included  in  the  citywide  traffic  and \ntransportation plan prepared either as part of the CLIP or separately by the ULBs. \n ", " 40  Appendix 6 \n6.

Approval Procedures for Subproject Selection \n \n13.  All subprojects will be prepared and processed according to the following procedure. With \nassistance from the Investment Program Management Unit or other agencies of the LSGD, the \nInvestment Program ULBs will prepare a CLIP, which identifies the gaps between current and \ntargeted levels of urban infrastructure, estimates the interventions required to fill the gaps, and \nproposes subprojects under each of the components of the Investment Program. The CLIP will be \nsent to city-level committee of the ULB, and then to the empowered committee, for approval. The \nIPMU,  with  the  assistance  of  investment  program  management  consultant  and  design  and \nsupervision consultant, will be responsible for the detailed appraisal of the subprojects and will \nensure that all the subprojects proposed for funding meet the selection criteria described above. \nOn the basis of the CLIP the IPMU will prepare a summary of the subproject appraisal report that \nwill include the rationale for each subproject, its scope and components, a technical description \nand analysis, the cost estimates and financing plan, an environmental assessment, a resettlement \nplan,  an  indigenous  peoples  development  plan  (if  applicable),  and  the  implementation \narrangements, along with financial, economic, and institutional analyses. The subproject appraisal \nreports will be sent to the work finalization committee formed for the Investment Program and \nheaded by the principal secretary of the Department of Urban Governance, for approval. After that, \nthe subproject appraisal reports will be sent to ADB for review and approval in a format agreed on \nby  the  state  government  and  ADB.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national priority in    Yes  Is the sector identified as a   Yes \ncountry poverty analysis?      national priority in country   \n      No  poverty partnership agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reducing poverty in India/Rajasthan:  \n \nWith a population of over 56 million (2001 census) Rajasthan is India\u2019s eighth-largest state. The population growth rate \nin Rajasthan was 28% in 1991\u20132001, higher than the national growth rate of 21.3% during the same period. The \nurbanization level in the state increased from 17.6% in the 1971 census to 23.4% (13.2 million) of the total population in \nthe 2001 census, slightly lower than the national average of 27.8%, and it is expected to reach 26.1% (22.8 million) by \n2021. The population living below the poverty line has decreased significantly, from 27.4% in 1994, to 15.2% in 2000. \nAccording to a recent survey by the government of Rajasthan, the percentage of the population living below the poverty \nline (BPL) increased slightly to 19% in 2004. In contrast to the national trend, Rajasthan\u2019s urban poverty level is higher \nthan the rural poverty level. In 1994, the rural poor constituted 26.4% and the urban poor 30.4%, and in 2000 the rural \npoor made up 13.7% and the urban poor 19.8%. Higher urban poverty rates and an expanding urban population may, \nin the coming years, lead to an urban crisis already compounded by lack of water and a stagnant manufacturing \nindustry. It is also important to note that a large group of people remain just above the statistical cut-off poverty line. A \nrecent report by The World Bank observes that raising the relevant income poverty line by 10% would raise the urban \npoverty level by 34% and rural poverty by 20% at the aggregate national level.  \n \nAdditionally, income poverty does not accurately reflect all the dimensions of poverty in Rajasthan. The transient nature \nof poverty in Rajasthan, due to natural disasters, makes the condition of the poor particularly precarious. Frequent \ndrought and the resulting large-scale out-migration in search of employment have a severe impact on the poor that is \nnot reflected in a quantitative assessment. Furthermore, income poverty hides many other dimensions of human \nsuffering, which are accentuated by ecological factors and inadequate provisioning of basic amenities.  \n \nThe slowdown in growth since the end of the 1990s is threatening the state\u2019s prospects for achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals  (MDGs).  Rajasthan  seems  on  the  way  to  achieving  the  goals  for  primary  education  and \nenvironmental sustainability, if growth rates and other conditions remain favorable, but the state is unlikely to succeed \nin achieving the goals of reducing infant and child mortality and providing reproductive health services for all. The state \nhas made remarkable progress in primary education: the primary gross enrollment ratio increased from 89% in 1993 to \n97% in 2002 and to more than 100% in 2004. On the other hand, health indicators are behind those for the rest of \nIndia, as highlighted by the fact the underweight children per 1,000 and under-5 mortality per 1,000 actually increased, \nrather than decreased, in the 1990s. Since human development/social indicators are closely correlated with income, \neconomic recovery is highly relevant to the achievement of the MDGs.  \n \nThe Rajasthan Urban Sector Development Investment Program is expected to address basic needs deficiencies \nthroughout 15 medium-sized cities and boost the regional economy through improved urban services. Direct benefits \nwill be sustained improvements in basic services in all Investment Program ULBs. The Investment Program will have a \npositive impact on the poor. Safe drinking water is a basic need that is inaccessible to a significant number of the poor \nin Rajasthan. The Program and the facilities to be built or improved under it will reduce the burden of water collection \non vulnerable segments of the population such as women. Free water connections and lifeline tariffs will ensure that \nthe poor can afford clean drinking water. Improvements in the quality of water, sewage treatment, sanitation, and solid \nwaste management will lead to public health improvements and hence to reductions in the burden of diseases, \ntreatment cost, and productive losses, whose impact is felt by the poor in particular. Women, especially poor women, \nwill benefit from the reduction in the time and energy spent in fetching and storing water, and in the work burden \nassociated with cleaning and family health care. The spin-offs are expected to be economic growth and direct \nemployment in unskilled or construction work under the Investment Program. \n \n ", "46  Appendix 9 \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Poverty Classification: Targeted intervention (MDGs) \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nA baseline socioeconomic survey was conducted in three of the Investment Program towns (Alwar, Jaisalmer and \nJhalawar-Jhalapatan). The poverty analysis was drawn from primary and secondary data. Primary data collection relied \non both a quantitative (1,650 sample households) survey and qualitative participatory exercises with slum dwellers and \nstakeholders throughout the cities. \n \nEven though progress in access to improved water and sanitation in urban areas is on track in Rajasthan in terms of \nachieving the MDGs, significant urban population growth rates and unequal distribution of basic urban services in urban \nareas may cause a setback in achieving the MDGs. According to the baseline socioeconomic survey, the population \nliving below the poverty line (BPL) was 18% in Alwar, 8% in Jaisalmer, and 25.9% in Jhalawar-Jhalapatan. The slum \npopulation ranged from4.1% in Jhalawar-Jhalapatan and 6.8% in Alwar, to 26.5% in Jaisalmer. The survey identified \nthe poor quality of urban environmental infrastructure and a gap in basic urban services, particularly for the poor living \nin slum areas.   \n \nThe social and poverty analysis showed widespread deficiencies in basic urban services in the three cities. Around \n76% of households in slums in Jaisalmer do not have access to water service connections. Although public stand posts \nexist, issues of water pressure and frequency and duration of supply are major issues for the poor. The survey revealed \nthat in Jaisalmer, water is supplied through the stand posts only once or twice a week. In summer, slum dwellers have \nto look for drinking water in other colonies with no certainty of getting it. More than 70% of slum households in the three \ntowns do not have private toilets and 60% practice open defecation. Drainage systems do not exist in Jhalawar and \nJhalapatan, while in Alwar drainage systems are availably only in a limited area. In Jaisalmer, only 2% of poor \nhouseholds reportedly have drainage connections. Lack of drainage, resulting in regular waterlogging and flooding \nduring rains, was reported by 24% slum dwellers in Jhalawar, and for 62% of the slum population in all three towns \nsolid waste is not collected regularly. Solid waste disposal is usually on nearby roads or roadside drains because of \npoor municipal waste collection and disposal. With this low access to basic services, waterborne diseases such as \ndiarrhea, enteric fever, and viral hepatitis are significant in the towns. The prevalence of diarrhea among the poor is \n41% in Jaisalmer and 46% in Alwar. Deficiencies in environmental sanitation are the cause of waterborne diseases, a \nmajor contributor to high levels of morbidity and mortality. Thus, the control of these diseases needs to be addressed \nthrough improved sanitation and supply of safe drinking water.  \n \nThe provision of good-quality and sustainable services to promote economic development and reduce poverty will rely \non support from the Investment Program in building the capacity of the urban local bodies to plan and manage more \neffectively. The Investment Program will improve capacity to plan, develop, and operate pro-poor urban infrastructure \nand services on the basis of an improved understanding of poverty and processes of participatory planning and \ndevelopment.  \n \nPoverty and social analysis using a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques is required to gauge post\u2013\nInvestment Program benefits in terms of improved access to basic services by the poor. The baseline survey will serve \nas the benchmark against which post\u2013Investment Program impact on the poor may be measured. Benefits to poor \nhouseholds, benefits to women, and increased participation and capacity building of the poor including women are \nsome of the issues that must be monitored and measured during and after implementation. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nExtensive consultations have been undertaken with stakeholders including: beneficiary communities and affected \nhouseholds  (among  these,  vulnerable  households  such  as  poor  households  and  those  headed  by  women  or \nindigenous  persons),  NGOs  and  community-based  organizations  (CBOs),  self-help  groups  (SHGs),  elected \nrepresentatives (such as municipal board members), urban local bodies (ULBs), administrative departments, state \ngovernments, and the central Government. Consultation workshops, meetings, focus group discussions, and structured \ninterviews were undertaken with stakeholders.  \n \nA stakeholder analysis was specifically undertaken for the slum upgrading subprojects and other subprojects aimed at \nbenefiting the poor. Key stakeholders identified were poor communities, slum dwellers, NGOs, self-help groups, the \nstate government, and ULBs. The perceptions of the poor were obtained through FGDs, individual interviews, and \ngroup meetings. These perceptions were considered in the Investment Program design.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nExtensive information dissemination and consultations have been undertaken to ensure stakeholder participation in the \n ", "Appendix 9  47\n \nInvestment  Program  design.  During  Investment  Program  preparation,  it  was  noted  that  a  key  factor  in  the \nnonperformance of many poverty reduction investment programs was lack of participation from the poor. A major \nfeature of the capacity development subcomponent of the Investment Program is enabling the municipal bodies to take \na  more  participatory  approach  to  urban  development.  This  will  start  with  the  detailed  planning,  design,  and \nimplementation of the Investment Program. Implementation support includes the provision of social and community \ndevelopment experts within the IPMU and IPIUs and the conduct of community awareness programs by NGOs: (i) to \nexplain the Investment Program activities; (ii) to serve as a continuing consultation mechanism, particularly for service \ncharges and fees; (iii) to launch community education programs in health and hygiene and water use management; and \n(iv) to provide a channel of communication on concerns and complaints, for issues arising during construction, such as \ndisruption or damage caused. Ongoing consultation and participatory monitoring will help ensure that the Investment \nProgram meets the needs of the community. The consultations can take the form of annual surveys by consumer \ncategory,  combined  with  community  forums  or  focus  group  discussions.  The  media  for  this  public  information \nmechanism will include local television, radio, newsletters, websites, and community meetings. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize beneficial impacts on women: \nPrimary and secondary information has been analyzed to assess the status of women in Investment Program ULBs. \nWhile there are significant differences in the status of women in the different Investment Program ULBs, the trends are \ncommon. In terms of education the female literacy rate is lower the rate for men. Social, economic, and cultural barriers \nprevent poor women from obtaining easy access to health services and care, even when good-quality health services \nare geographically within reach.  \n \nThe lack of basic urban infrastructure and services affects women more than men. Because of women\u2019s primary role in \nmanaging the household, the burden of water collection falls on them. During Investment Program preparation it was \nnoted that water collection takes 3\u20134 hours per day for women. This reduces the time they have to engage in \nproductive activities that would increase household income and improve women\u2019s position within the households. Lack \nof clean water supply also burdens women, who handle water more than men. Women have higher exposure to \ndiseases from contaminated water in the process of collecting water, and using water in cooking and washing. A \nreduction in diseases, aside from reducing the costs of treatment and productivity losses, also reduces the burden of \ncaring for sick household members which, is often a role taken on by women in the household. The lack of toilet \nfacilities also has a large impact on women in terms of privacy. The Investment Program responds to these issues in \nthe design of its subprojects.  \n  \n \nE.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Investment Program will optimize social and economic development in 15 selected \ntowns1 in Rajasthan through investments in urban infrastructure (water supply, wastewater \nmanagement, solid waste management, urban drainage, urban transport and roads), social \ninfrastructure, and infrastructure support for cultural heritage. The Investment Program will also \nprovide policy reforms to strengthen urban governance, management, and support for urban \ninfrastructure and services.2 \n \n2.  The Investment Program is designed to minimize land acquisition and resettlement \nimpact. Subprojects involving rehabilitation will be accommodated within the existing facilities\u2019 \npremises  and  will  not  involve  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Subprojects  involving  the \nconstruction of water supply systems, sewerage systems, solid waste management systems, \nurban drainage, and transport and road facilities are proposed on vacant government land \nwherever possible. The overall impact will be further minimized through careful subproject siting \nand alignment during detailed design and subproject implementation. Short resettlement plans \n(RPs) were prepared for sample subprojects in three towns (Supplementary Appendix H).3 \n \nB.  Resettlement Framework and Policy \n \n3.  This summary provides highlights of the resettlement framework (RF). The RF outlines \nthe objectives, policy principles, and procedures for land acquisition (if required), compensation, \nand other assistance measures for affected persons (APs). The RF is based on national laws \nincluding  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,  1894  (amended  in  1984);  and  the  National  Policy  on \nResettlement and Rehabilitation for Project Affected Persons, 2003 (NRRP). It is also based on \nthe Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The RF \ncompares these documents and addresses gaps.  \n \n4.  The core involuntary resettlement principles for the Investment Program are: (i) land \nacquisition and other involuntary resettlement impact will be avoided or minimized by exploring \nall viable alternative subproject designs; (ii) where such impact is unavoidable, time-bound RPs \nwill be prepared and APs will be assisted in improving or at least regaining their standard of \nliving before the Program; (iii) APs will be consulted on compensation, will be informed about \nresettlement plans and arrangements, and will participate in the planning and implementation of \nsubprojects; (iv) vulnerable groups will be provided special assistance;4 (v) APs including non-\ntitled  persons  (e.g.,  informal  dwellers/squatters  and  encroachers)  will  be  paid \ncompensation/assistance  at  replacement  rates  for  the  assets  acquired  from  them;  (vi) \ncompensation and resettlement assistance will be provided before the contractor takes physical \nacquisition of the land and before the start of construction; (vii) incomes will be restored and \nrehabilitated;  and  (viii) appropriate  grievance  redress  mechanisms  will  be  established.  The \nentitlement matrix for the Program, based on the above principles, is given in Table A10.1. \n                                                 \n1   Particularly district headquarters and towns with significant tourism potential. \n2   The assistance will be based on the state-level framework for urban reforms, and institutional and governance \nreforms recommended by the Government of India through the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission \nand the Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns. \n3   The sample subprojects are in Alwar, Jaisalmer, and Jhalawar. \n4   Including poor households, as well as households headed by women, the elderly, the disabled, and members of \nscheduled tribes, which are considered vulnerable on the basis of the indigenous peoples development framework \nagreed on by the state government and ADB. \n ", " \n5\nTable A10.1: Entitlement Matrix  0\n \n \nItem  Type of    \n \nNo.  Loss  Application  Entitled Persons  Compensation Policy  Implementation Issues  Responsible Agency   A\np\n1  Loss of  Agricultural  Legal titleholders   \u2022 Compensation at replacement value  \u2022  If land-for-land option  The valuation committee will  p\ne\nprivate land  land,  or land-for-land option where  is offered, titles will be  determine replacement value.  n\nd\nhomestead  feasible.a  in the name of original  IPMU will ensure the  ix\nland, or vacant  \u2022 Fees, taxes, and other charges  landowners.e   provision of notice.

Medium-term income restoration activities \nsuch as provision of longer-term training will also be provided. \n \nC.  Resettlement Plan Preparation Procedure \n \n6.  RPs for subprojects will be prepared as follows: (i) the IPIU, with guidance from the \ninvestment program management unit (IPMU), will undertake socioeconomic surveys for each \nidentified subproject, on the basis of the preliminary technical design; (ii) if the impact is found to \nbe significant,5 full RPs will be prepared for the subproject, and if not, short RPs will be required; \nand (iii) RPs will include measures to ensure that the socioeconomic conditions, needs, and \npriorities  of  vulnerable  groups  are  identified  and  that  the  process  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  does  not  disadvantage  vulnerable  groups.  The  consultants  will  include  SDSs \nfamiliar with ADB\u2019s policy and procedures for the preparation of subproject RPs. The RPs will \ncomply with national and state polices, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and other \nsocial safeguard guidelines, and the RF. The RPs for sample subprojects will be used as \nmodels  for  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  other  subproject  RPs.  The  approval  of \nsubproject RPs by ADB and compensation before displacement will be conditions for the civil \nworks contract.  \n \n7.  The Executing Agency (EA) through the IPMU will ensure that the RF is closely followed \nwhen  an  RP  is  formulated  for  a  subproject.  The  EA  will  further  ensure  that  adequate \nresettlement budgets are delivered on time to IPMUs and IPIUs, and that NGOs are involved, \nfor the timely implementation of RPs. \n \nD.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n8.  The  Local  Self-Government  Department  (LSGD)  is  the  EA  responsible  for  overall \ntechnical supervision and execution of all subprojects funded under the Investment Program. \nThe Implementing Agency (IA) is the project management unit for the ongoing Rajasthan Urban \nInfrastructure  Development  Project  (RUIDP),  which  will  be  expanded  into  the  IPMU,  to \ncoordinate the construction of subprojects and ensure consistency across the towns.6 The IPMU \nwill be assisted by: investment program management consultants (IPMCs), who will manage the \nInvestment Program and ensure the technical quality of the design and construction; and by \ndesign and supervision consultants (DSCs), who will design the infrastructure, manage the \ntendering of contracts, and supervise construction.  \n \n9.  IPIUs will be established in fifteen zones across the state to manage the implementation \nof subprojects in their area.7 They will appoint construction contractors to build elements of the \n                                                 \n5  Resettlement is significant when 200 or more people experience \u201cmajor impact\u201d\u2014defined as involving the physical \ndisplacement of APs from housing or the loss of 10% or more of their productive, income-generating assets. \n6  An interministerial empowered committee (EC) will provide LSGD with central policy guidance and coordination. It \nwill be chaired by the minister of urban development and local self government, and its members will include \nministers, directors, and representatives of other relevant government ministries and departments. \n7 City-level committees (CLCs) have been set up to monitor project implementation in each town. Chaired by the \ndistrict collector, the CLCs will have following members: representatives of ULBs, state government agencies, the \nIPIU, CBOs, and NGOs.

Once the infrastructure begins to \noperate, responsibility will be transferred to the appropriate state or local government agency, \nwhich will be given training, support, and financial assistance through the Investment Program \nwhere necessary to enable it to fulfill its responsibilities. The agency will hire local operation and \nmaintenance contractors to maintain and repair the infrastructure as required. \n \n10.  Resettlement issues will be coordinated by a social development specialist (SDS) within \nthe IPMU, who will ensure that all subprojects comply with involuntary resettlement safeguards. \nA resettlement specialist with the IPMC team will assist the SDS. Domestic SDSs will be \nappointed to assist the IPIUs in updating the RP in the detailed design stage, and in preparing \nRPs for new subprojects, where required for compliance with the policies of the Government \nand ADB.

Information was and continues to be disseminated to APs. Local language \nversions of the RF and sample subproject RPs will be made available in relevant government \nagencies in each town, and in IPIU and IPMU offices. The RF and sample subproject RPs will \nbe disclosed on ADB\u2019s website and the IPMU websites. The finalized RPs will also be disclosed \non ADB\u2019s website, IPMU websites, and IPIU or town websites, and information dissemination \nand consultation will continue throughout Investment Program implementation.

Grievances of APs will first be brought to the attention of the implementing NGO or SDS. \nGrievances not redressed by the NGO or SDS will be brought to the city-level committees \n(CLCs) set up to monitor project implementation in each town. The CLC, acting as a grievance \nredress committee, is chaired by the district collector and consists of representatives from the \nULB,  state  government  agencies,  IPIU,  community-based  organizations,  and  NGOs.  As \ngrievance redress committee, the CLC will meet every month, determine the merit of each \ngrievance, and resolve grievances within a month of receiving the complaint, failing which the \ngrievance will be addressed by the interministerial empowered committee. Further grievances \nwill be referred by APs to the appropriate courts of law. Records will be kept of all grievances \nreceived including: contact details of the complainant, the date of receipt of the complaint, the \nnature of the grievance, the corrective actions agreed on and the date these were carried out, \nand the final outcome. \n \nF.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n13.  RP implementation will be closely monitored to provide the IPMU with an effective basis \nfor assessing resettlement progress and identifying potential difficulties and problems. Internal \nmonitoring will be undertaken by the IPIU with assistance from the IPMU. Internal monitoring will \ninvolve: (i) administrative monitoring to ensure that implementation is on schedule and problems \nare dealt with on a timely basis; (ii) socioeconomic monitoring during and after any resettlement \nimpact,  using  baseline  information  established  through  the  socioeconomic  survey  of  APs \nundertaken during subproject preparation; and (iii) overall monitoring to assess AP status. Job \ncharts will be given to the SDS. The job charts will indicate the targets to be achieved during the \nmonth. Monthly progress reports will be prepared and submitted to the IPMU, showing actual \nachievements  against  the  targets  fixed  in  the  respective  job  charts  and  the  reasons  for \nshortfalls, if any. The IPIU will be responsible for managing and maintaining AP databases, \ndocumenting the results of the AP census, and verifying asset and socioeconomic survey data, \nwhich will be used as the baseline for assessing RP implementation impact. The EA will appoint \nan independent agency to undertake external monitoring to document: (i) restoration of income \nlevels;  (ii)  changes  and  shifts  in  occupation  pattern;  (iii)  changes  in  AP  type  of  housing; \n(iv) assessment of APs\u2019 access to amenities, such as water, electricity, and transportation; and \n(v) performance of NGOs, IPIU, and IPMU in resettlement implementation. The independent \nagency will monitor subprojects twice a year and submit reports directly to the EA (IPMU). The \nEA in turn will submit all external monitoring reports to ADB for review.  \n \nG.  Resettlement Budget \n \n14.  Detailed budget estimates for involuntary resettlement will be prepared for each RP, by \nthe  IPMU.  It  will  be  included  in  the  overall  subproject  estimate.  The  budget  will  include \n(i) detailed costs  of  land  acquisition,  relocation,  and  livelihood  and  income  restoration  and \nimprovement;  (ii)  administrative  and  implementation  costs;8  (iii)  source  of  funding;  (iv) \narrangements for approval; and (v) the flow of funds and contingency arrangements. Overall \ncosts are estimated at Rs132 million. All land acquisition funds will be provided by the EA.

The Investment Program will optimize social and economic development in 15 selected \ntowns1  in  Rajasthan  through  investments  in  urban  infrastructure  (water  supply,  wastewater \nmanagement, solid waste management, urban drainage, and urban transport and roads), social \ninfrastructure, and infrastructure support for cultural heritage. The Investment Program will also \nprovide  policy  reforms  to  strengthen  urban  governance,  management,  and  support  for  urban \ninfrastructure and services.2 Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) for sample subprojects3 \n(Supplementary Appendix J) and an overall summary IEE were prepared. The IEEs were based on \nfield surveys, secondary information, and discussions with stakeholders. Salient points from the \nIEEs are summarized below. \n \nB.  Environmental Impact Forecasting and Mitigation \n \n2.  The Investment Program is designed to maximize environmental and public health benefits. \nIEEs conducted for the Investment Program show that net subproject environmental benefits are \npositive and large including: increases in quantity and improvements in quality of drinking water \nfrom water supply subprojects; better public health, particularly reduction in waterborne diseases \nthrough  water  supply,  sewerage,  drainage,  solid  waste  management  investments;  improved \naesthetics  from  sewerage,  drainage,  and  solid  waste  management  works;  reduced  flooding \nthrough drainage improvement; reduced exposure to suspended particulates and to noise pollution \nthrough urban transport and road components; and social benefits from slum improvement and \ncivic  infrastructure  outputs.  The  potential  negative  subproject  impact  during  construction  and \noperation  will  not  be  significant  because  larger  facilities  will  be  located  in  low-density  and \nnonsensitive areas, the works will be small in scale and the construction period short, and simple \ntechnologies will low maintenance requirements will be preferred. The Investment Program does \nnot have any cumulative impact but is designed to support the state government in developing the \ncovered sectors. In the longer term (beyond the Investment Program period), sector-wide positive \nimpact is envisioned. \n \n3.  Environmental subproject selection guidelines ensure that the Investment Program will not \nhave any significant negative environmental impact and no impact on environmentally sensitive \nareas. Subprojects with potentially significant and permanent impact will not be allowed. The \npotential negative impact and mitigation measures are summarized in the table below. \n \nC.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n4.  The Local Self Government Department (LSGD) is the Executing Agency (EA) responsible \nfor overall technical supervision and execution of all subprojects funded under the Investment \nProgram, and it will carry out the mitigation measures assigned to it as part of its management of \nthe Investment Program. The Implementing Agency (IA) is the project management unit (PMU) of \nthe  ongoing  RUIDP,  which  will  be  expanded  into  the  investment  program  management  unit \n(IPMU), to coordinate the construction of subprojects and ensure consistency across the towns.4 \n                                                 \n1  Particularly district headquarters and towns with significant tourism potential. \n2  The assistance will be based on the state-level framework for urban reforms, and institutional and governance reforms \nrecommended by the Government of India through the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission and the \nUrban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns. \n3  The sample subprojects are in urban transport and roads (Alwar), sewerage and sanitation (Alwar, Jaisalmer), solid \nwaste management (Alwar, Jaisalmer, Jhalawar-Jhalrapatan), water supply (Alwar, Jaisalmer, Jhalawar-Jhalrapatan), \nand urban drainage (Jaisalmer, Jhalawar-Jhalrapatan). \n4   An interministerial empowered committee (EC) will provide LSGD with central policy guidance and coordination. The \nEC will be chaired by the minister of urban development and local self government, and its members will include \nministers, directors, and representatives of other relevant government ministries and departments. ", "60  Appendix 11 \nThe IPMU will be assisted by: investment program management consultants, who will manage the \nInvestment Program and assure technical quality of the design and construction; and design and \nsupervision  consultants  (DSCs),  who  will  design  the  infrastructure,  manage  the  tendering  of \ncontracts, and supervise construction.

Investment program implementation units (IPIUs) will be established in seven zones across \nthe state to manage the implementation of subprojects in their area.5 They will appoint construction \ncontractors (CCs) to build elements of the infrastructure in a particular town (supervised by DSCs), \nand CCs will be required by their contracts to implement all specified mitigation, monitoring, and \nreporting assigned to CCs as presented in subproject IEEs. Once the infrastructure begins to \noperate, responsibility will be transferred to the appropriate state or local government agency, \nwhich will be given training, support, and financial assistance through Rajasthan Urban Sector \nDevelopment Investment Program where necessary to enable it to fulfill its responsibilities. They \nwill employ local operation and maintenance contractors to maintain and repair the infrastructure \nas required. \n \n6.  Environmental issues during the Investment Program period will be coordinated by an \nenvironmental  specialist  within  the  IPMU,  who  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects  comply  with \nenvironmental  safeguards.  An  environmental  monitoring  specialist  with  the  IPMC  team  will \nimplement the environmental monitoring plan from each IEE. The implementation will involve \nobservations and surveys throughout construction to ensure that mitigation measures are provided \nand  the  environment  is  protected  as  intended.  Domestic  environmental  consultants  will  be \nappointed to assist the IPIUs in updating the IEEs in the detailed design stage, and in preparing \nIEEs or Environmental Impact Assessments for new subprojects, where required to comply with \nthe policies of the Government of India and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The IPMU will \nalso appoint consultants to conduct surveys of the long-term impact of the infrastructure.

Chaired by the \ndistrict collector, each committee will draw its members from the urban local bodies (ULBs), state government \nagencies, the IPIU, community based organizations, and nongovernment organizations. \n6  During implementation the contractor will submit to the IPIU monthly progress reports, which include a section on EMP \nimplementation. The IPIU will submit reports to the IPMU for review. The IPMU will review the progress reports to \nensure that the all mitigation measures are properly implemented. The IPMU will consolidate the monthly reports and \nsubmit quarterly reports to ADB for review. ", "Appendix 11  63\nD.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n \n7.  The primary stakeholders7 are: residents, shopkeepers, and businesspeople who live and \nwork near the construction sites; custodians and users of socially and culturally important buildings \nin  these  areas;  state  and  local  authorities  responsible  for  the  conservation  of  historical  and \narchaeological sites and artifacts; state and local tourism authorities; and the urban local bodies \n(ULBs).  The  secondary  stakeholders8  are:  LSGD,  other  relevant  government  institutions, \nnongovernment organization and community-based organizations working in affected communities, \nother community representatives (prominent citizens, religious leaders, elders), the beneficiary \ncommunity in general, and ADB. \n \n8.  Stakeholders were involved in developing the IEEs through face-to-face discussions on-site \nand public meetings in three towns.9 Views expressed were incorporated into the IEEs and the \nplanning and development of the Investment Program. All IEEs and other relevant documents will \nbe made available at public locations in the towns and will be disclosed to a wider audience via the \nADB  website.  The  consultation  process  will  be  continued  and  expanded  during  Investment \nProgram implementation, when LSGD will appoint a nationally recognized NGO to handle this key \nelement to ensure that stakeholders participate fully in subproject execution. \n \nE.  Findings, Recommendations, and Conclusion \n \n9.  The IEEs show that the sample subprojects will result in large net environmental benefits, \nand that any adverse environmental impact will be largely temporary and localized and can be \naddressed  through  subproject  design  and  mitigation  measures.  No  further  assessment  of \nenvironmental impact is required for the sample subprojects.  \n \nF.  Environmental Selection Guidelines and Environmental Review Procedures \n \n10.  To  ensure  compliance  with  the  environmental  guidelines  and  requirements  of  the \nGovernment of India and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), environmental subproject selection \ncriteria  and  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  to  guide  the \nimplementation of future subprojects have been developed. A summary of the environmental \nsubproject selection guidelines is provided in Appendix 15. \n \n11.  The full EARF, based on provisions of the environmental policies and legislative provisions \nof the Government of India and the government of Rajasthan, and the Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines of ADB, is provided in Supplementary Appendix K.

Ensure that no wastewater is discharged into a watercourse, where it could be a hazard to downstream \nusers (e.g., a waterway that is a source of water for domestic or municipal supply). \n8.  Include measures to ensure the safe disposal of sewage sludge without causing an environmental \nhazard, and if possible to promote its safe and beneficial use as an agricultural fertilizer. \n9.  Locate sewerage pipelines within the ROW of roads wherever feasible, to reduce the need to acquire \nnew land. \n10. Ensure that routes of sewage mains do not require the acquisition of a significant proportion (more than \n10%) of the total landholding of individual farmers. \n11. Ensure  that  communities  that  relinquish  land  needed  for  sewerage  mains  or  other  facilities  are \nconnected to the new sewerage system as part of the scheme. \n12. Avoid locating sewage pumping stations and wet wells within 200 m of any inhabited areas, or within \n500 m of sensitive sites such as hospitals, schools, and temples, to minimize the nuisance impact from \nodor, rodents, etc. \nSolid Waste  1.  Comply  with  all  requirements  of  relevant  national  laws  including  the  Municipal  Solid  Wastes \nManagement  (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000; the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974; the \nAir (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981; and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.   \n2.  Locate landfill sites at least 500 m (at least 1 km where possible) from any inhabited areas, in locations \nwhere no urban expansion is expected in the next 20 years, so that people are not affected by odor or \nother nuisance from the site. \n3.  Locate landfills on sites where there is no risk of flooding or other hazards that might impair the \nfunctioning of the site and present a risk of damage to the site or its environs. \n4.  Locate landfill sites adjacent to STPs whenever possible so that leachate can be collected and treated. \n5.  Consult the relevant national or local archaeological agencies regarding the archaeological potential of \nproposed landfill sites, to ensure that these are located in areas where there is a low risk of chance \nfinds. \n6.  Provide a properly engineered and managed sanitary landfill site that is sealed to prevent leaching of \ncontaminants into surface or groundwater. Refuse must be compacted and covered each day, and there \nmust be a separate concreted area for the safe disposal of hazardous waste. \n7.  Provide a composting facility for the beneficial use of biodegradable wastes such as vegetable peelings \nand agricultural waste. \n8.  Include a public education and information element to inform communities of their responsibility to place \ntheir waste at collection points, and to segregate waste that is suitable for recycling. \nUrban  1.  Continue the established practice of burying new main and secondary drains within existing roads as far \nDrainage  as possible, to avoid the need to acquire new land. \n2.  Locate new tertiary drains within the ROW at the side of roads wherever feasible, again to avoid the \nneed to acquire new land. \nUrban  1.  Develop road improvement schemes (road widening, bridge construction, etc.) only where the need is \nTransport  clearly demonstrated by appropriate traffic and hazard studies. \nand Roads  2.  Prioritize the widening of existing roads over the construction of new roads, and widen roads within the \nexisting ROW to avoid the need to acquire new land. \n3.  Exclude from the Investment Program road construction or road widening projects that involve land \nacquisition or resettlement, except as otherwise agreed on by ADB and the government of Rajasthan \nand  subject  to  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  the  related \nframeworks. \n4.  Provide new or improved drainage to remove the increased runoff caused by increasing the road \nsurface area. \n5.  Retain mature roadside trees, and if any trees have to be removed, plant two new trees for every one \nthat is lost. \n6.  Include tree planting alongside elevated bridges to provide a natural barrier to noise and visual impact, \nand include additional man-made barriers if necessary. \n7.  Consult the relevant national or local archaeological agencies regarding the archaeological potential of \nproposed sites of any new roads, bridges, or car parks, to ensure that these are located in areas where \nthere is a low risk of chance finds. \nArt, Cultural  Ensure that cultural heritage projects \nHeritage,  1.  are consistent with: (i) the heritage conservation and development plan of the Government of India; (ii) a \nand Tourism  cultural heritage management framework to be developed for the project and agreed on by the state \ngovernment and ADB; (iii) a site-specific archaeological and historic site management plan to be \ndeveloped for the subproject by relevant specialists (archaeologists and conservation architects) in \n ", "Appendix 14  69\nconsultation with national and state government specialists, local and international NGOs and experts, \nand local communities. \n2.  prioritize noninvasive preservation work to retard deterioration, stabilize the site, and maintain current \nstates, over works involving restoration or reconstruction. \n3.  exclude adaptation (site modification for compatible use). \n4.  follow ADB\u2019s environmental assessment procedures, including classifying any subproject with significant \nimpact on cultural heritage sites as environment category A (could have significant negative impact).     \nEnsure that heritage and tourism subprojects \n1.  are proposed or requested by the relevant heritage and tourism authorities and identified as a priority in \nthe authorities\u2019 development plans. \n2.  (if within or near designated sites of cultural or historical importance) are designed and constructed in \nconsultation  with  the  relevant  national  or  local  archaeological  agencies  whose  approval  will  be \nrequested,  and  which  will  be  asked  to  assess  the  risk  of  the  work  damaging  known  or  as  yet \nundiscovered artifacts, and to assist in developing and applying the necessary safeguards to protect \nthese areas from damage during construction. \n3.  do not involve reconstruction or adaptation on cultural heritage sites. The only allowed processes are \npreservation, restoration, and maintenance. \nFire Services  1.  Consider only projects proposed or requested by the relevant agencies. \n2.  Prioritize improvements within the boundary of existing firefighting facilities. \n3.  Where new facilities are required, locate these on vacant government land.  \n4.  Avoid land acquisition by installing fire hydrants on government land and ROWs where feasible. \n5.  Ensure that water and waste disposal systems in constructed facilities are designed to national and \ninternational standards. \nAC = asbestos concrete, ADB = Asian Development Bank, EIA = environmental impact assessment, km = kilometer, m = meter, NGO \n= nongovernment organization, ROW = right-of-way, STP = sewage treatment plant, WTP = water treatment plant. \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20071009115112+08'00'", "Author": "CEO", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "rrp: india 40031,indian urban sector development, rajasthan investment program,", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20071102141656+08'00'", "Title": "Rajasthan Urban Sector Development Investment Program"}, "author_page": " \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government of India ends on 31 March. \u201cFY\u201d before a \ncalendar year denotes the year in which the fiscal year ends, e.g., FY2005 ends \non 31 March 2005. \n(ii)  In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n \n \nVice President  L.
