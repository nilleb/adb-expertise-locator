However,  the  recession  highlighted  the  adverse  impact  on \nincomes  and  poverty,  as  well  as  the  importance  of  robust  financial  systems  in  a  volatile \neconomic  environment.  Although  Georgia  is  a  lower  middle-income  country,  poverty  remains \nhigh at 25% as of 2010 and in rural areas the incidence of poverty may be as high as 60%.2 \n \nExposure  to  the  macroeconomic  shocks  and  financial  crises  undermined  public \n3. \nconfidence in Georgia\u2019s banking sector since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Private credit to \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  averaged  31%  (2008\u20132010),  indicating  a  depth  of  financial \nintermediation far below other middle-income peers.3 Access to financial services is moderate in \nGeorgia,  but  highly  concentrated  in  the  capital  Tbilisi,  where  78%  of  bank  lending  is  being \nextended.  Georgia\u2019s  regions,4 which  account  for  about  half  the  population,  lag  far  behind  the \ncapital  in  accessing  finance,  receiving  only  22%  of  bank  lending. 5 Compared  with  emerging \nmarkets  in  Eastern  Europe  the  efficiency  and  stability  of  financial  intermediation  are  low,  as \nwitnessed by high lending\u2013deposit rate spreads and high defaults in 2008 and 2009. Supporting \noutreach of financial services to the regions and overall stability of the financial sector will have \nmajor  qualitative  impacts  on  the  economy  and  people,  by  stimulating  rural  income  and \nemployment, and supporting critical risk diversification in a volatile macroeconomic environment. \n \n4. \nAlthough  rural  economic  activity  contributes  only  17%  to  GDP,  it  supports  half  of  the \npopulation and 65% of employment, of which farms employ 53% and nonfarm enterprises 12% \n(footnote  2). The quality  of growth is  particularly significant  in  rural  areas,  as  it  provides major \nbenefits  for  low-income  families  and  stimulates  demand  for  goods  and  services  produced  by \nmicro,  small,  and  medium  sized  enterprises  (MSMEs), 6  which  represent  the  bulk  of  rural \nactivities.  The  government  has  recognized  that  its  liberal  economic  policies  have  led  to  a \nconcentration of activity in the capital, leaving rural areas behind. Stimulating economic activity \nand income generation in the regions has become a government priority, and it is pursuing rural \ninvestments in infrastructure, agriculture, and agribusiness.7 An increase in international tourism \npoints to the potential for additional income and employment opportunities in this sector. \n \nMSMEs in Georgia are a critical contributor to income and employment, with 42% of the \n5. \nlabor  force  being  employed  by  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs),  and  many  more \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1 \n2  World Bank. 2009.

Only a few are medium-sized, according to \nthe  European  Union  threshold  for  large enterprises  above  250  employees and business  turnover  of  greater  than \nGEL100 million equivalent. Georgia is part of the European Union neighborhood region.  \n\n7  International Monetary Fund. 2012. Georgia.

However, MSMEs and farmers have consistently \nlacked  access  to  finance  because  of  traditional  security-based  lending  processes  that  ignore \ntheir information availability.8 The senior loan to TBC, Georgia\u2019s second largest bank in terms of \nassets  (GEL3.6  billion  as  of  30  June  2012),  aims  to  support  inclusive  financial  growth  and \ndeepen  access  to  finance,  by  extending  funding  to  TBC  for  onlending  to  MSMEs  operating \nexclusively in rural regions outside the capital and supporting TBC as a systemically important \nbank.9 This  is  consistent  with  the  effort  of  the  National  Bank  of  Georgia  (NBG)  to  promote \nfinancial stability and access to finance.  \n \n6. \nIn  April  2012,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  entered  into  discussions  with  TBC \nsenior management and designed a loan targeted to support MSMEs in Georgia\u2019s rural regions. \nTBC  is  considered  a  good  candidate  for  ADB  funding,  given  its  recent  acquisition  of  Bank \nConstanta,10 and its rural staffing and branch expansion plans. This gives TBC a strong regional \nplatform  to  target  and  service  MSMEs  operating  outside  the  capital.  TBC  also  supports  high \nprudential  standards  for  Georgia\u2019s  banking  industry,  and  the  implementation  within  TBC  of \nenhanced systems of governance, capital, and risk management consistent with the introduction \nof  Basel  II  and  Basel  III  regulatory  frameworks.  TBC\u2019s  substantial  improvements  in  its \ngovernance  and  financial  performance  since  2009  have  been  recognized  internationally,  as \nevidenced  through  credit  rating  upgrades  to  B1  by  Moody\u2019s  and  BB\u2013  by  Fitch  in  June  2012. \nTBC also received Euromoney awards in 2011 and 2012 as the best bank in Georgia. \n \nB. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n7. \nTBC is the second largest bank in Georgia, and is systemically important with a market \nshare of 28% of loans and 32% of deposits at 30 September 2012. It has a strong franchise with \ncorporate,  SME,  and  retail  clients.  Its  unique  strength  lies  in  its  business  sophistication  and \noutreach  through  cost-effective  distribution  channels.  TBC  plans  to  diversify  its  portfolio  by \nexpanding  its  loan  book  in  the  regions,  thereby  reducing  the  concentration  risk  to  large  single \nand group borrowers. The acquisition of Bank Constanta has helped TBC to obtain a stronger \nrural  footprint  through  Bank  Constanta\u2019s  extensive  regional  branch  network  of  44  branches, \nincreasing  TBC\u2019s  branches  to  101  as  of  mid-November  2012.  Moreover,  TBC  plans  to \nstrengthen  services  to  MSMEs  through  dedicated  regional  branch  units,  and  product  cross-\nselling to small and rural enterprises through Bank Constanta and TBC channels. \n \n8. \nIn October  2012, TBC  revised  its  business  targets  based  on  the  anticipated  slowing of \nthe  Georgian  economy  and  that  of  its  trading  partners,  reflecting  a  more  moderate  growth \ntrajectory.  TBC  expects  its  annual  business  growth  to  remain  above  market  growth.  Given  its \nnew  focus  on  expanding  outside  Tbilisi,  TBC  projects  its  regional  GLP  to  grow  above  its \naverage growth. \n \n9. \nTBC\u2019s diversification is closely associated with its efforts to establish an internal capital \nadequacy  assessment  process  (ICAAP) 11  to  enhance  its  solvency  management  and  risk \nmanagement  through  enhanced  stress  testing  and  forecasting  capabilities  in  accordance  with \n\n                                                \n8  The depth of financial services offered in rural areas is very low. Because of the informal nature of their business \nand the lack or limitation of financial documentation and property titles, limited fixed assets, and high reliance on \ncash flow revenues, potential borrowers do not meet standard requirements for obtaining bank credit. Banks need \nto adapt their lending processes and build their expertise in cash flow-based lending. \n\n9  Diversification  of  sources  of  growth  is  essential  for  Georgia.  In  2010,  for  instance,  73%  of  Georgia\u2019s  registered \n\nenterprises\u2019 business turnover was concentrated in the capital region. \n\n10 In April 2011, TBC acquired 83% ownership in Bank Constanta, the largest microfinance institution in Georgia. \n11 ICAAP  describes  a  bank\u2019s  internal  management  processes  required  under  Pillar  2  of  the  Basel  II  regulatory \n\nframework.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n\nBasel II requirements becoming effective in 2013. \n \nC. \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n10. \nOwnership.  TBC  was  established  in  1992  by  Georgian  entrepreneurs,  M.  Khazaradze \nand  B.  Japaridze,  which  own  27.74%  of  shares.  Since  2001,  international  financial  institutions \n(IFIs) have significant shareholdings. In November 2012 IFIs hold 54.15% of issued shares: the \nInternational  Finance  Corporation  (19.80%),  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment  (19.80%),  German  development  cooperation  through  DEG  (11.32%),  and  the \nDevelopment  Finance  Company  of  the  Netherlands  (FMO)  (3.23%).  Other  shareholders  are \nJP Morgan  (5.34%),  Ashmore  (4.52%),  TBC  management,  and  individuals  who  hold  8.25%  of \nthe shares. \n \n11.  Management.  The  management  board  is  composed  of  seven  senior  executives \nincluding  the  chief  executive  officer,  chief  operating  officer,  chief  financial  officer,  chief  risk \nofficer, and three business heads. All have professional backgrounds and most have been with \nTBC for more than 10 years. The chief financial officer and the head of corporate finance have \ninternational banking experience. With three of the seven management board members, women \nare  well  represented.  The  management  board  sets  TBC\u2019s  strategic  targets,  and  prepares  risk \nlimits  and  credit  policies  for  approval  by  the  supervisory  board.  The  management  board \nmembers are experienced bankers who are well qualified to lead TBC. \n \n12. \nGovernance.  TBC  is  governed  by  a  two-tier  board  structure  consisting  of  the \nsupervisory  board  and  the  management  board.  The  supervisory  board  is  responsible  for \noverseeing  the  implementation  of  key  policies,  approving  strategic  and  business  targets,  and \nappointing  management  and  monitoring  their  performance.  IFI  shareholders  nominate  four  of \nthe  seven  supervisory  board  members,  who  are  currently  all  senior  professionals  with \ninternational  banking  experience.  The  other  three  supervisory  board  members,  including  the \nchairperson,  are  well-known  Georgian  entrepreneurs.  There  are  currently  no  independent \ndirectors, and the incumbent chairperson, M. Khazaradze, has held the position for 20 years. \n \n13. \nIn anticipation of the introduction of Basel II, TBC is preparing to establish a new credit \nrisk  committee  under  the  supervisory  board  in  2013.  The  shareholders  have  also  determined \nthat the supervisory  board  will  be  supported  by  (i)  a new  remuneration  committee responsible \nfor management  board  remuneration  policies,  (ii)  a new  nomination  committee responsible for \nmanagement  board  appointments,  and  (iii)  an  enhanced  audit  committee  that  will  cover  ethics \nand control within TBC. TBC\u2019s governance draws strength from its IFI shareholders. \n \n14. \ntime chairperson and two members, one of which is an IFI-appointed supervisory board member. \nTBC\u2019s Audit Department is staffed by experienced auditors and reports to the audit committee. \nUsual  observations  identify  and  help  address  (i)  fraud,  (ii)  system  deficiencies,  and  (iii) \ncompliance  issues.  Audit  observations  have  not  identified  any  major  accounting,  operational, \nand  compliance  risks.  External  audit  assignments  are  carried  out  by  large  international  firms, \nwith  TBC  currently  using  PricewaterhouseCoopers.  TBC\u2019s  anti-money-laundering  unit  has  10 \nstaff  checking  transactions  above  GEL30,000.  The  anti-money-laundering  unit  identifies \nsuspicious  transactions  by  scanning  information  by  source  of  wealth,  politically  exposed \npersons, and watch lists. It reports to the NBG Financial Investigation Unit.12 \n \n                                                \n12 Georgia participates in the Financial Action Task Force. Its compliance is monitored by MONEYVAL, the Council of \nEurope  Committee  of  Experts  on  the  Evaluation  of  Anti-Money  Laundering  Measures  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism. \n\nThe audit committee directly reports to the supervisory board and is composed of its full-\n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nD. \n\n \nE. \n\nUnique Features \n\nFinancial Performance CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nThe  proposed  objectives  of  the  loan  will  be  supported  by  technical  assistance  (TA) \n15. \nresources. First, resources will be made available to TBC under ADB\u2019s ongoing TA for Capacity \nBuilding  for  Financial  Institutions,  Phase  2  to  improve  TBC\u2019s  risk  management  and  lending \npractices,  including  its  business  expansion  to  rural  regions  within  Georgia.  13 Second,  ADB \nhas\u2014as  an  integral  part  of  its  support\u2014approved  TA  for  NBG  to  support  the  review, \nimprovement,  and  supervision  of  ICAAPs  across  Georgia\u2019s  banking  system,  which  is  set  to \ncommence  in  early  2013. 14  This  is  in  line  with  NBG\u2019s  efforts  to  improve  financial  sector \nresilience.  Providing  lender-of-last-resort  facilities,  and  improving  asset  liability  management, \nincluding stress testing, are important focus areas to ensure adequate solvency and liquidity of \nbanks.  ADB  has  been  supporting  NBG  since  2009  to  (i)  help  restructure  its  supervision \ndepartment,  by  integrating  on-  and  off-site  supervision  through  a  group  approach  and \nestablishing  a  systemic  risk  team;  (ii)  introduce  a  risk-based  approach  to  regulation  and \nsupervision of financial institutions and incorporate macro-prudential and systemic risks; and (iii) \nstrengthen its  risk  assessment  capabilities.  In  2011,  NBG  established a new  capital  adequacy \nregulation that complies with the Basel II and Basel III frameworks and requires banks\u2019 gradual \nICAAP implementation in 2013, forming the cornerstone for customized bank risk assessments \nand related capital requirements. While most of the banks are on track to comply with the new \nBasel II requirements, implementing the ICAAP under pillar 2 for the first time is challenging for \nbanks and supervisors. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nThe proposed ADB assistance consists of a senior loan facility of up to $50 million with a \n16. \ntenor  of  5  years.  The  proceeds  will  be  used  to  diversify  TBC\u2019s  high  exposure  to  Tbilisi  by \n(i) increasing  lending  to  enterprises  exclusively  in  the  underserved  rural  regions;  (ii)  providing \nenhanced  access  to  longer-term  finance  for  the  MSME  segment,15 which  is  critical  to  support \nincome  and  employment;  and  (iii)  gradually  funding  smaller  entities,  thereby  providing  greater \ndiversification  of  TBC\u2019s  loan  book,  and  reducing  TBC\u2019s  exposure  to  its  large  borrowers  and \ngroups.  The  senior  loan  will  be  available  to  TBC  for  onlending  to  MSMEs  sourced  through \nTBC\u2019s retail, SMEs, and corporate platforms, as well as Bank Constanta\u2019s microfinance lending \nplatform.

TBC  will  also  provide  quarterly  financial  statements \nand compliance certificates for agreed covenants. Reporting requirements also include (i) status \nupdates  for  introducing  and  maintaining  the  Basel  regulatory  framework;  (ii)  updates  on \ngovernance, safeguards, and social protection compliance; and (iii) updates on TBC\u2019s business \n\n                                                \n13 ADB. 2010.

Georgia\u2019s  capital  markets  are  nascent,  and  public  confidence  in  the  financial \nsector  is  only  gradually  being  restored.  Commercial  bank  funding  is  also  not  readily  available \ngiven current market conditions in Europe. Finally, IFIs that are funding Georgian banks are now \noperating  within  tight  country  and  sector  exposure  limits\u2014increasing  the  importance  of  ADB\u2019s \nengagement. ADB will provide term financing and assist to build public confidence in the banks. \n \n19. \nThrough close on-site monitoring and dialogue with TBC management, ADB will support \nTBC\u2019s  adherence  to  high  corporate  governance  and  social,  environmental,  and  fiduciary \nstandards, while enhancing standards for risk management. \n \n20. \nADB has been responsive to the needs of TBC. Additional TA will be available for TBC \nunder ADB\u2019s ongoing TA for Capacity Building for Financial Institutions, Phase 2 (footnote 21). \nThrough the semiannual consultation process between TBC and ADB, areas for deployment of \nTA  can  be  identified,  and  may  include  further  assistance  to  improve  risk  management  in  line \nwith Basel II and III, and enhance TBC\u2019s origination and monitoring standards for MSME clients \nusing enhanced cash flow analysis. \n \nD. \n\nRisks  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nImpact. The impacts of the investment are (i) improved access to financial services  for \n21. \nMSMEs,  and  (ii)  enhanced  resilience  of  Georgia\u2019s  banking  system.  More  prudent  financial \nintermediation  by  banks  is  expected  to  lead  to  greater  consumer  confidence.  This  will  be \nreflected by an increase in bank deposits and loans, as well as an increase in the private credit \nto GDP ratio. \n \n22. \nOutcome. The outcome of the investment is that TBC remains profitable and becomes a \nmore  resilient  bank,  prudently  serving  the  diverse  needs  of  Georgia\u2019s  economy.  TBC  is \nexpected  to  set  an  example  for  other  banks  in  the  industry  and  position  itself  to  be  able  to \nwithstand  possible  future  financial  stress  by  putting  in  place  advanced  approaches  for \nmaintaining  capital  adequacy,  improving  its  risk  management  capability  to  exceed  minimum \nrequirements of Basel II, and improving efficiencies. \n \n23. \nOutputs.  The  output  of  the  investment  is  that  TBC  will  improve  its  service  outreach  to \nMSMEs, especially in the regions, and diversify its credit risk exposure by (i) reducing borrower, \nsector,  and  regional  concentration;  and  (ii)  ensuring  adequate  investment  is  made  in  human \nresources, processes, and systems. \n\nB. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n24. \nUnder  Strategy  2020,  ADB  aims  to  strengthen  its  support  for  the  financial  sector  by \nsupporting  the  development  of  financial  infrastructure,  institutions,  and  products  and  services, \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fand  by  promoting  inclusive  growth. 16 This  loan  will  help  TBC  to  reach  down  the  market  to \nMSMEs in rural regions and is consistent with the Government of Georgia\u2019s efforts to invest in \nthe  rural  regions,  particularly  in  the  areas  of  infrastructure,  agriculture,  and  agribusiness  after \nyears of neglect that led to a concentration of activities in the capital. Strategy 2020\u2019s target on \npoverty  reduction  through  private  sector  development  will  be  supported  via  TBC\u2019s  new \nemphasis on activities outside the capital, where poverty is highest. \n\nADB\u2019s \n\ninterim  operational  strategy,  2008\u20132009 \n\n25. \nfinancial \nintermediation  as  a  priority  for  private  sector  development,  noting  that  sustaining  growth  will \nrequire broadening access to finance. 17 It highlights that agriculture and SMEs have inadequate \naccess  to  financial  services,  and  that  lending  support  via  financial  institutions  presents  the \ngreatest  opportunity  for  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations.  The  recent  crisis  highlighted  the \nimportance of resilient banking systems to protect against adverse impacts on its population. \n\nfor  Georgia \n\nidentified \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n26. \nFinancial  sector  development  is  a  key  focus  of  ADB  assistance  as  set  out  in  ADB\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Development Strategy18 and Enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy,19 which note \neconomic growth, stimulated by private sector investment, as a key factor in reducing poverty. \nThese strategies  also  note  the  importance  of  generating  jobs,  with  private  sector  employment \nbeing  the  major  source  of  income  for  workers  and  their  families.  The  Private  Sector \nDevelopment  Strategy  emphasizes  ADB\u2019s  role  in  strengthening  the  financial  sectors  in  its \ndeveloping member countries. It provides that SME beneficiaries of financial intermediation are \nimportant  employers  and  providers  of  income  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction.  Support  of \nfinancial intermediaries is also important to instill confidence and restore the financial sector in \ncrisis-hit  countries. The  loan is  consistent  with ADB\u2019s  financial  sector  operational  plan and the \n2007 report of the Working Group on Rural Poverty,20 which underscores the importance of rural \nfinance, and promotes financial inclusion of underserved poor households, farmers, and SMEs. \n \nADB has approved three nonsovereign loans to banks in Georgia,  all of which targeted \n27. \nSMEs. 21 The  first  loan  to  BOG  was  made  immediately  after  Georgia  joined  ADB.  Although \nBOG\u2019s  performance  was  adversely  affected  by  the  2008  crisis,  it  has  made  an  impressive \nrecovery since 2010 and ADB\u2019s loan has been repaid. ADB provided a second loan to BOG as \na  response  to  the  2008  crisis,  which  was  critical  in  stabilizing  BOG\u2019s  access  to  funding  and \nmaintaining  its  outreach  to  SMEs.  While  higher  deposit  mobilization  and  international  capital \nmarket  resources  would  be  desirable,  public  confidence  in  banks  is  only  gradually  improving \nfrom low levels, and international investors remain risk averse given global economic conditions. \nAs a result, IFI funding to solvent Georgian banks remains essential for Georgia\u2019s transition to \nan inclusive financial system. Building on the previous interventions, the loan to TBC would take \nADB\u2019s financing downstream to MSMEs operating in the underserved rural regions. \n\n                                                \n16 ADB.  2008.

Subloans  under  environment \ncategory A, and social safeguards categories A and B will not be financed under the senior loan. \nThe subloans\u2019 potential environment and social impacts, its risks associated with TBC\u2019s existing \nand  likely  future  portfolio,  and  TBC\u2019s  commitment  and  capacity  for  environmental  and  social \nmanagement, have been assessed. The existing environmental and social management system \n(ESMS)  established  by  TBC  and  the  agreed modifications  with  ADB  are  deemed  adequate  to \ncomply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  TBC  will  ensure  that  investments  using  ADB \nfunds  do  not  involve business  activities on  ADB\u2019s  prohibited  investment activities list. TBC  will \nenhance  its  existing  ESMS  to  implement  the  modifications  agreed  with  ADB  before  the  first \ndisbursement for subloan financing. The ESMS will include provisions requiring TBC to comply \nwith  national  labor  laws  and  to  take  specific  measures  in  relation  to  the  internationally \nrecognized core labor standards, in compliance with ADB\u2019s social protection strategy.22 \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n29. \nTBC was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe proposed senior loan is within the medium-term country, industry, group, and single \n\n30. \ninvestment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank 23  the \n31. \nGovernment of Georgia\u2019s no objection to the proposed assistance to TBC will be obtained.
