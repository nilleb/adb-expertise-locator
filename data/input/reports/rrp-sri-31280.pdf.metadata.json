This will be \nachieved through a series of interventions over the period 2002-2008. The \nproposed Project will be the first in the series of interventions, supporting \nthe  first  stage  of  the  reform  program  and  financing  improvement  of \nprovincial  roads.  Technical  assistance  (TA)  will  also  be  provided  to \nprepare the second intervention in the sector. \n \nEfficient  transport  contributes  to  the  expansion  of  economic  opportunities \nand the reduction of poverty. The overall contribution of road infrastructure \nrequires  institutional  arrangements  and  capacity  that  support  strategic \nmanagement of the sector, planning and management of investments and \nmaintenance,  and  competitive  provision  of  civil  works  and  of  engineering \nand related services. Sustained institutional reforms are needed to enable \nthe Road Development Authority (RDA) and provincial councils to perform \ntheir strategic, planning, and management roles, and to establish a strong, \ncompetitive  private  sector.  A  further  determinant  of  transport  efficiency  is \nthe performance of transport services that make use of road infrastructure. \nThere  is  a  need  to  improve  the  regulatory  framework  for  bus  services  to \nrealize  the  potential  contribution  of  the  private  sector  while  safeguarding \nthe  interests  of  passengers.  There  is  also  a  need  for  investment  in \nimprovement of the road network, both to expand capacity in response to \nrising  traffic  on  the  national  highway  network  and  to  address  poor  road \nconditions on parts of the provincial road network. \n \nThe  overall  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  advance  policy  and  institutional \nreforms to create an enabling environment for the efficient and sustainable \ndevelopment of the road sector with substantial participation of the private \nsector.  The  medium-term  policy  framework  developed  and  agreed  upon \nwith  the  Government  will  serve  as  a  roadmap  for  future  lending  to  Sri \nLanka\u2019s road sector. \n \nThe  proposed  Project  and  its  attached  TAs  are  designed  to  achieve  two \nspecific  objectives:  The  first  is  to  improve  transport  efficiency  by  (i) \nstrengthening  the  performance  of  the  road  sector institutions responsible \nfor  the  national  and  provincial  road  networks,  (ii)  improving  road \nmaintenance  and  road  maintenance  funding,  (iii)  developing  streamlined \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nmaintenance  and  road  maintenance  funding,  (iii)  developing  streamlined \nregulatory and other arrangements for buses and other transport services \nusing  roads,  and  (iv)  upgrading  and  increasing  the  capacity  of  priority \nroads.  The  second  objective  is  to  increase  private  sector  participation  in \nthe road sector by (i) increased outsourcing of road works and engineering \nservices,  and  (ii)  exploring  opportunities  for  private  operation  of  bus \nservices. \n \nThe  reform  program  components  will  establish  the  transfer  of  national \nroad  provision  to  the  private  sector  in  stages;  strengthen  the  capacity  of \nRDA  to  perform  its  role  of  planning,  managing,  and  maintaining  the \nnational  road  asset  base;  and  establish  basic  road  provision  capacity  in \nfour  provincial  councils.  The  investment  components  will  improve  about \n980  kilometers  (km)  of  provincial  roads  in  North  Central,  North  Western, \nUva, and Western provinces.  \n\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $92.5 million equivalent. The \nforeign exchange cost is $32.8 million, and $59.7 million equivalent is the \nlocal currency cost.  \n\n \nSource \n\nADB \nOPEC Fund \nGovernment \n\n     Total \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \nTotal Cost \n\n($million) \n \nPercent \n\n24.3 \n8.5 \n0.0 \n\n32.8 \n\n32.2 \n0.0 \n27.5 \n\n59.7 \n\n56.5 \n8.5 \n27.5 \n\n92.5 \n\n61.1 \n9.2 \n29.7 \n\n100.0 \n\n \nThe equivalent in various currencies of special drawing rights 42.75 million \n($56.5 million equivalent) from the Special Funds resources of ADB.

The \nreforms of provincial road provision and the provincial roads improvement \nwill  be  executed  by  the  project  coordination  unit  of  MHAPCLG  and \nimplemented by provincial-level project implementing units.  \n \nAll  civil  works  contract  packages  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  following  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures. \n \nInternational  and  domestic  consultants  will  be  required  to  support  the \nreform  program,  for  construction  supervision  for  the  provincial  roads \nimprovement,  and \nthe  national  highways \ndevelopment. The consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  arrangements  satisfactory  to \nADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  overall  performance  of  the  road  sector, \ncontributing  to  transport  efficiency.  This  will  improve  the  returns  and \nsustainability  of  existing  and  future  investments  in  the  sector,  and \ncontribute to growth of a wide range of other economic activities that make \nuse of road transport services. Improved access to economic opportunities \nand  services  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction.  The  beneficiaries  of  the \nProject  will  be  people,  companies,  and  government  and  nongovernment \nagencies throughout the country that make use of road transport services \ndirectly or indirectly.  \n \nThe  main  quantifiable  benefits  of  the  provincial  roads  improvement  will \nconsist of savings in transport operating costs. The beneficiaries will  be (i) \ncommunities  in  the  project  areas,  (ii)  transport  operators,  and  (iii) \ncompanies  and  employees  that  operate  in  or  serve  these  communities. \nThe proportion of poor among the project beneficiaries is 38%, higher than \ntheir  proportion  in  the  overall  population of the country (30%). Access to \nimproved  bus  and  road  freight  services  will  help  to  reduce  poverty  by \nenabling growth in poor peoples\u2019 incomes and employment, reducing the \ncost  of  transport  services,  supporting  improved  school  attendance,  and \nimproving access to social services. The overall economic internal rate of \nreturn  is  26.1%.    The  poverty  impact  ratios  of  representative  roads  for \nUva,  North  Western,  and  North  Central  provinces  are  estimated  to  be \nmore than 0.5, well above the poor's share of national income. \n \nThe  major  risks  for  the  project  are  (i)  that  the  reform  will  not  be \nimplemented  in  full,  leading  to  improvements  in  sector  performance  less \nthan  intended;  (ii)  inadequate  post  project  road  maintenance;  and  (iii) \nlimited experience and capacity of contractors. These have been mitigated \nin the design of the project in accordance with the agreed upon medium-\nterm  program,  with  milestones  that  have  to  be  met  for  future  ADB \ninvolvement  in  the  sector.  The  reform  program  will  improve  planning, \nexecution,  and  financing  of  road  maintenance.  Sufficient  provision  has \nbeen  made  for  the  project  implementation  consultant  to  supervise \ncontractors and provide assistance and training to build up their skills and \ncapacity. \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nTechnical \nAssistance \n\ninvestment  program \n\n  \nIn conjunction with the Project, two TAs are proposed for (i) conducting a \nfeasibility  study  of  national  highways  development,  and  (ii)  developing  a \nreform  and \ntransport  services \nimprovement. The estimated total cost of the TAs is $1,680,000, of which \nADB will finance $1,350,000 on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund \nfunded by the Government of Japan. The TA consultants will be recruited \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.  \n\nfor  passenger \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 1 \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Road Sector Development Project \n(the Project),1 and (ii) proposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a loan \nto  be  provided  by  the  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  Fund  for  International \nDevelopment  (OPEC  Fund)  for  the  Project.  The  report  also  describes  two  proposed  technical \nassistance  (TA)  grants  for  national  highways  (NHs)  development  and  for  passenger  transport \nservices  improvement,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TAs. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nSri Lanka has a road network of about 83,690 kilometers (km), comprising about 11,460 \nkm of NHs (Classes A and B), 13,880 km of provincial roads (PRs, Classes C, D, and E),2 and \n58,350  km  of  local  authority  roads.  Road  transport  accounts  for  about  92%  of  passenger  and \nfreight land transport. Vehicle ownership and road traffic have grown rapidly. The total number \nof registered vehicles was about 1.4 million in 1997, increasing at 6% per annum. Of the total of \n67  billion  passenger-km  of  travel  in  2000,  33.6  billion  were  on  private  buses,  19.7  billion  on \npublic buses, 3.2 billion on railways, and 10.5 billion on private vehicles.  \n \n3. \nWhile  the  road  network  is  extensive,  most  roads  were  built  more  than  50  years  ago. \nRoad  maintenance,  rehabilitation,  and  new  construction  have  not  kept  abreast  of  the  rapid \ngrowth in demand for transport. Traffic levels now exceed the design capacity of many roads. \nDue  to  neglect  of  road  maintenance,  road  conditions  are  often  poor.  Uncontrolled  roadside \ndevelopment has also reduced the capacity of the network. This has negative consequences for \nroad user costs, road safety, and the quality and frequency of transport services, and limits the \ncontribution of roads to national development, economic growth, and poverty reduction.  \n \n4. \nThe  public  sector  retains  most  of  the  responsibilities  for  the  provision  of  NHs.  This \nincludes not only planning and managing the road network, but also designing and supervising \nthe  road  works.  The  role  of  the  domestic  private  sector  in  road  contracting  and  engineering \nservices is underdeveloped compared with other ADB developing member countries. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Transport,  Highways  and  Civil  Aviation  (MTHCA)  has  overall \n5. \nresponsibility for policies and programs concerning national transport. The Ministry of Highways \n(MOH)  has  overall  responsibility  for  programs  and  projects  for  NHs.  The  Road  Development \nAuthority  (RDA),3  a  statutory  institution  assigned  to  MOH,  is  responsible  for  planning  and \nmanaging  the  development  of  NHs,  and  for  maintenance.  Although  having  the  structure  of  a \ncommercial  organization,  with  a  chairman,  general  manager,  and  a  board  of  directors,  in \npractice  RDA  operates  as  a  government  department  under  MOH,  with  relatively  limited \nautonomy.  Most  of  RDA\u2019s  engineering,  construction  and  maintenance  works  is  carried  out  by \nthe  Road  Construction  and  Development  Company  (RCDC),  owned  by  RDA,  on  the  basis  of \nwork orders with remuneration based on highways schedule of rates plus overhead markups.  \n                                                 \n1   The Project framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n2   Class  A  roads  are  mainly  NHs  connecting  different  provinces.  Class  B  roads  are  mainly  NHs  within  a  province. \nClass C roads are mainly surfaced PRs connecting towns and villages. Class D roads are mainly other surfaced \nPRs. Class E roads are mainly unsurfaced or gravel PRs. \n\n3   Established by the Road Development Authority Act, No. 73 of 1981. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nincluding  assigning  responsibility \n\nFollowing  the  13th  Amendment  to  the  Constitution,  1989,  responsibility  for  PRs  was \n6. \ndevolved from RDA to the Ministry of Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government \n(MHAPCLG).  However,  provincial councils were not given guidance on appropriate institutional \narrangements for carrying out road responsibilities. Several different structures were adopted for \nto  provincial \nprovincial  road  administrations  (PRAs), \nengineering  or  public  works  departments,  creating  a  separate  highway  department  under  the \ncouncil,  and  establishing  a  separate  provincial  road  development  authority.  There  is  a  lack  of \nprofessional  and  technical  expertise,  particularly  in  planning,  programming,  design,  contract \nadministration,  and  quality  control.  The  performance  of  road  responsibilities  at  the  provincial \nlevel has therefore remained weak, and the condition of the PR network has deteriorated. \n \n7. \nIn 1999, a survey of PRs conducted in North Central, North Western, Uva, and Western \nprovinces found that the network was generally in poor condition, with a wide range of width and \ngeometric standards. Potholes and breakup of bitumen surfacing were the most common form \nof  deterioration,  and  in  most  cases  reconstruction  or  overlay  was  needed.  It  was  evident  that \nrelatively little rehabilitation and periodic maintenance had been carried out in the previous 10 \nyears.  The  survey  found  that  (i)  11%  of  the  network  was  in  good  or  very  good  condition  and \nwould  not  need  rehabilitation  for  some  years;  (ii)  15%  was  in  fair  condition  and  likely  to  need \nresurfacing  within  the  next  5  years;  (iii)  54%  was  in  poor  condition  and  needed  major \nrehabilitation  to  return  the  roads  to  a  maintainable  condition  and  provide  all-weather \nserviceability; and (iv) 20% was in very poor condition, requiring reconstruction.  \n \n8. \nFreight services in Sri Lanka are operated by the private sector and are not controlled. \nThere  are  associations  and  cooperatives  that  represent  freight  operators.  The  freight  haulage \nmarket is highly competitive. Haulage rates vary for different commodities. The rates on roads in \npoor condition are about 20% higher than on roads in good condition. \n \n9. \nPassenger bus services are the leading form of public transport in Sri Lanka and perform \nan important role in providing transport for poor people and those living in remote areas, and in \nenabling  them  to  have  access  to  economic  opportunities  and  services.  In  2000,  there  were \n16,167  licensed  private  buses  and  5,894  public  buses.  Private  services  met  63%  of  the \npassenger-km and public services met 37%. The standard of bus services is generally low, with \nproblems in terms of service coverage, quality of service, safety, and reliability.  \n \n10. \nThere  have  been  numerous  changes  in  responsibilities  for  bus  services.  Bus  services \nwere operated by the private companies, which were nationalized and consolidated into a single \npublic  company,  the  Ceylon  Transport  Board,  in  1958.  In  1978,  this  was  dissolved  and  its \nfunctions  were  divided  among  nine  regional  transport  boards  and  the  Sri  Lanka  Central \nTransport  Board.  In  1979, to supplement the services, private bus services were reintroduced \nand  route  associations  were  established,  which  were  disbanded  by  the  late  1980s.  In  1991,  a \nNational  Transport  Commission  was  established  to  formulate  policy  and  disburse  subsidies. \nProvincial  transport  commissions  were  also  established  to  regulate  intraprovincial  services.  In \nthe  early  1990s,  the  regional  transport  boards  were  transformed  into  93  peoplized  bus \ncompanies,  under  which  the  Government  provided  employees  with  50%  shares  of  the mobile \nassets. These were reconsolidated into 11 regional transport companies in 1997.  \n \n11. \nNeither private nor public bus services have achieved efficiency and good service for a \nsustained  period.  Changes  in  policy  and  institutional  arrangements  sometimes  led  to  a \ntemporary improvement in service, but was generally followed by declining service performance, \nnecessitating  further  change.  Nationalization,  route  associations,  and  the  establishment  of \ntransport commis sions, as well as resumption of private services and successive restructurings \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 3 \n\n1. \n\nNational Highways Provision \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities5 \n\nof  public  services,  were  responses  to  deteriorating  service  coverage,  frequency,  comfort,  and \nsafety, and growing operating deficits, linked to inefficiency and poor management. \n \n12. \nThe  road  accident  fatality  rate  was  about  18  per  10,000  vehicles,  compared  with  less \nthan  10  per  10,000  vehicles  in  some  industrialized  countries  in  Asia,  and  1-2  per  10,000 \nvehicles  in  industrialized  countries.  In  1998,  there  were  2,000  fatalities,  of  whom  42%  were \npedestrians. Efforts to improve road safety are still at an early stage. The National Road Safety \nSecretariat was established in 1997 to implement the road safety action plan developed under \nADB projects.4 In 1998, the Road Safety Council was established under the Motor Traffic Act to \nguide national policies and actions on road safety.  \n \nB. \n \n \n \n13. \nThe  existing  institutional  arrangements  have  led  to  problems  of  inefficiency,  lack  of \ncapacity, and inadequate maintenance. A series of interconnected weaknesses in RDA includes \n(i) lack of capacity to systematically plan, program, and prioritize road development options; (ii) \nlack  of  preconstruction  processes  needed  for  advance  preparation  and  planning  of  complex \nprojects;  (iii)  lack  of  experience  in  use  of  employer-contractor  contracts  needed  for  effective \nmanagement and control of civil works construction; (iv) lack of systems for road maintenance \nmanagement,  including  planning,  budgeting,  programming,  and  controlling;  (v)  absence  of  a \ntechnical audit function; and (vi) inadequate level of road maintenance funding.  \n \nAn  underlying  cause  of  many  of  these  problems  was  RDA\u2019s  reliance  on  RCDC.  The \n14. \nautomatic use of RCDC to execute most domestically funded road works meant there was no \npipeline  of  domestic  work  to  support  the  development  of  domestic  private  sector capacity in \nroad contracting and engineering services. As RCDC performed both design and construction, \nand contracts were not used, there was little incentive for RDA to improve its competence and \ncapacity  in  highway  planning,  management,  and  engineering.  Additionally,  since  much  of \nRCDC\u2019s capacity was taken up with minor works for RDA that were better suited to small-scale \ncontractors, and it was not afforded the full autonomy of a private company, RCDC was unable \nto realize its potential for undertaking larger scale, equipment-intensive operations.  \n \n15.  Weaknesses in the approach to funding provision of roads have meant that road assets \nare  not  adequately  maintained  and  there  has  not  been  enough  investment  in  capacity \nexpansion. Although road user charges generate substantial government revenues, more than \nhalf  of  these  are  spent  outside  the  road  sector.  The  amount  assigned  to  road  maintenance  is \nmuch  too  low  compared  with  levels  generally  recommended  for  other  developing  countries. \nRoads do not receive maintenance when needed. Many deteriorate to the extent that they can \nbe  restored  to  good  condition  only  by  undertaking  major  rehabilitation  works  at  much  greater \ncost.  An  ADB-funded  TA6  is  to  improve  the  maintenance  budgeting  and  expenditure  control \nsystem, with a view to determining the full extent of funding shortfalls.  \n \nEconomic growth has led to increased demand for travel over longer distances, causing \n16. \nrising  congestion  on  NHs.

This  includes  construction  of the \nADB-financed  Colombo-Matara  highway,  Colombo-Katunayake  Expressway,  Colombo  Outer \nCircular  Road,  Colombo-Kandy  highway,  and  Katunayake-Padeniya-Anuradhapura  highway. \nThis  program  will  require  a  doubling  or  trebling  of  domestic  road  provision  capacity, and will \ngreatly  increase  the  road  asset  base  to  be  sustained  through  maintenance.  To  carry  out  this \nprogram,  the  existing  problems  of  inefficiency,  lack  of  capacity,  and  inadequate  maintenance \nneed to be overcome through implementation of institutional and policy reform.  \n \n \n \n17. \nSince the PR networks are already extensive, the main role of PRAs is to maintain the \nexisting road asset base. However, PRAs have few of the planning and other skills needed to \nperform this role effectively and efficiently. None of the PRAs keep inventories of road condition, \nand none have objective systems for selecting periodic and routine maintenance. Their capacity \nis  mainly  confined  to  performing  public  works,  on  a  fairly small scale, often using direct labor. \nThey also lack expertise and experience in use of the private sector for execution of civil works \nand engineering and technical services, and there is lack of coordination among the PRAs. \n \n18. \nThe  annual  budgets  for  provincial  roads  are  funded  mainly  from  central  government \nallocations,  supplemented  by  revenues  raised  by  provincial  councils.  The  existing  level  of \nfunding is insufficient for councils to adequately maintain their road networks. There is a need to \nincrease  the  level  of  road  budgets,  and  assign  more  to  road  maintenance.  Since  the \nGovernment\u2019s  capacity  for  increasing  provincial  roads  budget  may  be  limited,  PRAs  may  also \nneed to develop a range of levels of service on different roads in their networks, with a view to \nmaking best use of scarce budget resources. \n \n19. \nis \nimplementing  an  institutional  development  program  (IDP)  to  (i)  establish  capacity  for  efficient \nand effective management of the road network; and (ii) develop the institutional, financial, and \nprivate  sector  contracting  resources  needed  for  sustainable  road  maintenance.  This  has  been \nimplemented  with  a  view  to  being  used  as  a  model  for  replication  in  other  provinces,  and \nprovided  the  basis  for  the  IDP  developed  under  the  ADB-funded  TA8  for  North  Central,  North \nWestern, Western, and Uva provinces, and under the United Nations Development Programme-\nfunded  Mid-Country  Rural  Roads  Network  Feasibility  Study  for  Central  and  Sabaragamuwa \nprovinces.  \n\nthe  ongoing  ADB-funded  project,7 \n\nthe  Southern  Provincial  Council \n\nUnder \n\n3. \n\nTransport Services \n\n20. \nThe  performance  of  the  bus  transport  services  has  been  influenced  by  the  inability  to \nestablish  and  implement  a  sound  policy  and  regulatory  framework  for  both  public  and  private \noperators. The Government has controlled fares and service parameters have limited the scope \nfor  increased  efficiency.  Fare  increases  have  been  infrequent,  and  have  not  kept  pace  with \ninflation.9 This has deterred investment and discouraged larger professional firms from entering \nthe industry, leaving the majority of services in the hands of small-scale, owner-operators who \nlack  management  expertise  and  capital.  The  fare  structure  has  led  to  overcrowding  on  more \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB. 1997. RRP for the Southern Provincial Roads Improvement.

Regulatory enforcement has been hampered by \nlack of capacity and by problems of corruption in the issuance of route permits and monitoring. \n \n21. \nPublic  bus  services  have  become  a  substantial  financial  burden.  The  annual  operating \nlosses of the regional companies rose from SLRs1.1 billion ($18 million equivalent) in 1997 to \nSLRs1.7  billion  ($25  million  equivalent)  in  1999.  To  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  state-owned \nbus companies, reduce its financial burden, and attract management expertise, the Government \nhas  recently  initiated  a  public-private  partnerships  program.  Proposals  have  been  invited  from \nprivate firms take over 39% of the equity of these companies together with management control. \nThe first sale of equity interest in six public bus companies was completed in late October 2002. \nDespite these efforts, an overall strategy for the efficient, equitable, and sustainable delivery of \npassenger  transport  services  by  both  private  and  public  operators  needs  to  be  developed. \nMTHCA  therefore  wishes  to  elaborate  a  program  of  transport  service  reforms,  including  (i) \nstrengthen  policy  to  realize  the  potential  contribution  of  the  private  operators  and  to  limit  the \nneed for public services, (ii) review mechanisms for meeting minimum service obligations, (iii) \ndevelop  a  staged  program  for  implementation  of  the  revised  policy,  (iv)  establish  regulatory \ncompetencies  through  institutional  strengthening and capacity building, and (v) restructure the \ncentral transport board to reduce operating losses. \n \n22.  MTHCA  has  identified  further  dimensions  of  passenger  transport  services  requiring \nimprovement. Bus terminals in towns are poorly managed and as a result are often congested \nand inefficient. Most roads were designed without making provision for bus stops, with the result \nthat stopping buses interfere with traffic flows and create road safety hazards. There may also \nbe scope for encouraging a wider range of passenger service alternatives, from premium quality \nservices  to  basic  or  informal  services,  and  improvement  of  passenger  service  connections, \nincluding transfers between bus services and intermodal connections. Some bus terminals have \nbeen upgraded,  10 and motor vehicle registration and inspections systems are being upgraded \nunder the ADB-funded Southern Transport Development Project (STDP). \n  \n\n4. \n\nGovernment Sector Objectives and Plans \n\nThe Government\u2019s Framework for Poverty Reduction11 establishes a strategy for poverty \n23. \nreduction:  (i)  creating  opportunities  for  the  poor  to  participate  in  economic  growth,  (ii) \nstrengthening  the  social  protection  system,  and  (iii)  empowering  the  poor  and  strengthening \ngovernance.  One  of  the  main  challenges  for  creating  opportunities  for  the  poor  will  be  to \neffectively link poor regions to rapidly growing domestic and international markets. Building up \nthe  NH  system  and  an  integrated  road  network,  and  enhancing  the  performance  of  the  bus \nsystem have been identified as priority transport and communications initiatives. There is also a \nneed for institutional and policy reform to improve the performance of the road sector, including \nincreasing private sector participation and improving road maintenance. \n \n\n5. \n\nExternal Assistance and ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n\n24. \nSince 1980, ADB has provided eight loans totaling $351 million for the road sector, the \nmost recent being for the STDP in 1999. The principal bilateral sources of external assistance \nhave  been  Japan,  Republic  of  Korea,  Sweden,  and  Kuwait.  The  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme is the largest multilateral grant provider. Among the multilaterals, ADB is the largest \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1992. RRP for the Urban Development Sector. Manila; and ADB. 1998.

External assistance to the road sector is in Appendix 3. \n \nADB's  country  strategy  for  Sri  Lanka  focuses  on  contributing  to  sustainable  poverty \n25. \nthe \nreduction.  Under \nGovernment and ADB, high priority is accorded to broad-based rural development. The strategy \nis to support growth in  productive employment opportunities and rural incomes through faster \nand  broad-based  economic  growth.  At  the  High  Level  Forum  on  23  March  2001,  the \nGovernment and ADB concluded that ADB support for the road sector is important for poverty \nreduction.  Improved  sector  performance  will  facilitate  economic  growth,  raising  incomes  and \ncreating employment, and thereby reducing poverty.  Strategic investments are also needed to \nlink  less  developed  regions  to  markets  and  service  centers.  ADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  is  to  bring \nabout overall improvements in sector performance by supporting institutional and policy reforms, \nstrengthening  private  sector  participation,  and  financing  strategic  investments  in  the  network. \nADB has for some years been the lead donor in the road sector, and will continue in this role. \n \n\n6. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n26. \nADB-assisted  roads  projects  in  Sri  Lanka  have  experienced  implementation  delays. \nThese have been due mainly to (i) cumbersome Government procurement procedures, affecting \nprojects in all sectors; (ii) lack of institutional capacity in RDA for preconstruction processes and \nconstruction  supervision,  including  land  acquisition  and  resettlement;  and  (iii)  lack  of  capacity \nand  inexperience  of  the  domestic  private  sector  in  road  construction  and  engineering  and \nrelated services.  \n \nIn  2000,  as  a  result  of  ADB-financed  TA, 12 the Government simplified its procurement \n27. \nprocedures  for  externally  funded  projects,  introduced  a  system  of  monitoring  procurement \nperformance,  and  established  the  Procurement  Support  Bureau  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance, \nwhich is reducing the time for procurement and is increasing transparency.  \n \n28. \nDuring the 1990s, ADB helped the Government to start the process of opening up road \nprovision to the private sector, including through use of local competitive bidding (LCB) in ADB-\nfinanced  projects,  training  and  capacity  building  to  support  private  contractors,  and  studies to \naddress  key  constraints  to  private  sector  participation.  As  result  some  domestic  building \ncontractors  have  successfully  ventured  into  road  construction.13  However,  for  private  sector \nparticipation  to  be  sustained,  and  to  enable  further  consolidation  and  development  of  the \nindustry, a pipeline of road construction work is needed, which depends on RDA assigning more \nof its annual consolidated fund (CF)-financed road works to be executed by contractors.  \n \n29. \nLand acquisition and resettlement (LAR) weaknesses can lead to project implementation \nproblems and delays, as experienced under previous loans. These have been improved under \nthe latest approved project, however, the process is still need to be further streamlined. \n \n30. \nInadequate  postproject  maintenance  experienced  in  the  early  ADB  endeavors  is  being \naddressed under current ADB projects. However, the Government has difficulties in complying \nwith  covenants  related  to  broader  budget  allocation  for  road  maintenance.  There  is  a  need  to \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB. 1997. TA to Sri Lanka for the Establishment of Sri Lanka Tender Support Bureau. Manila \n13  In  1994,  RCDC  initiated  training  and  developing  domestic  private  contractors  by  engaging  13  contractors  on  a \nsubcontract basis to perform a large road project in Colombo, but had to be discontinued in 1995 because changes \nin Government\u2019s general procurement regulations prevented RCDC from continuing to engage subcontractors. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 7 \n\naddress the broader lack of maintenance issue for the overall sector through a reform program \nto improve the planning, execution, and financing of road maintenance. \n \n31. \nAn  overall  lesson  from  past  experience  in  the  road  sector  is  that  institutional  reform \ninitiatives need to be addressed in a comprehensive but gradual manner, and to be sustained if \nthey  are  to  produce  lasting  improvements.  This  is  difficult  to achieve through a single project. \nThe  programmatic  approach  therefore  brings  together  ADB\u2019s  next  interventions  for  the  road \nsector,  creating  the  opportunity  to  link  financing  of  successive  projects  to  implementation  of  a \ncommon medium-term reform agenda.  \n \n\n7. \n\nMedium-Term Sector Framework Approach \n\nto \n\nfocus  on \n\nimproving  overall  sector  performance \n\nIn 2000, ADB revised its operational strategy for the road sector in Sri Lanka, and with \n32. \nthe  Government  decided \nthrough \nimplementation of institutional and sector reform. ADB-financed TA14 had identified inefficiency \nin  the  sector  and  inadequate  maintenance,  which  were  linked  to  lack  of  capacity,  lack  of \ncompetition,  and  outmoded  business  processes.  Through  subsequent  policy  dialogues,  the \nGovernment  asked  ADB  for  assistance  in  implementing  sector  reforms  using  a  medium-term \nsector approach,15 with processing of loans linked to successive accomplishment of milestones \nin the reform program. This approach is supported by other external agencies assisting the road \nsector,  notably  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  and  the  Swedish \nInternational Development Cooperation Agency.  \n \n33. \nThe  TA  (footnote  14)  was  used  to  initiate  extensive  policy  dialogue  with  the  main  road \nsector stakeholders. The Government and ADB identified the need to augment the consultation \nprocess for the TA. An ownership team and 10 consultative teams were established involving a \nbroad  cross-section  of  stakeholders  in  the  reengineering  process,  including  MTHCA,  MOH, \nRDA, RCDC, MHAPCLG, provincial councils, private contractors, consulting firms, and others. \n \n34. \nA  high-level  seminar  on  road  sector  development  established  an  initial  consensus  on \nobjectives, scope, and the overall focus of the reform program.16 Subsequently, the scope and \nsequencing of the medium-term program of sector reforms was agreed upon. The medium-term \nprogram consists of (i) reengineering central government road sector institutions and building up \nprivate  sector  participation,  (ii)  strengthening  the  road  function  of  provincial  councils,  (iii) \nimproving  passenger \nin  road \nimprovement, and (v) road safety improvement. The road sector policy matrix is in Appendix 4. \n \n35. \nThe  reform  program  will  build  upon  past  ADB  support  for  reform  in  the  road  sector, \ndevelop additional reforms, and provide sustained support to bring to a conclusion each of the \nmain  reform  activities.  The  extended  time  frame  and  the  approach  of  implementing  reforms \ngradually in stages reflect the need for (i) an inclusive, nationallyowned process of change, (ii) \ncapacity  to  be  built  up  to  support  new  institutional  arrangements,  and  (iii)  the  Government  to \nretain capacity to continue to meet its responsibilities throughout implementation of the program. \nAdequate progress of the sector framework is required for processing future projects. \n \n36. \n The medium-term framework for road sector lending is summarized in Appendix 5.  The \nplan  tentatively  envisages  that  ADB  will  provide  three  project  loans  and  several  TAs.  Each \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 1998.

As  the  first  project,  the \nproposed Project will commence the transfer of provision of national roads to the private sector \nin  stages;  strengthen  the  capacity  of  RDA  to  perform  its  role  of  planning,  managing,  and \nmaintaining  the  national  road  asset  base;  and  establish  basic  road  provision  capacity  in  four \nprovincial councils. The investment component will finance improvement of PRs. Two attached \nTAs  will  be  used  to  prepare  feasibility  studies  for  NH  development  and  provide  support  to the \nGovernment\u2019s objectives to improve passenger transport services. \n \nThe  possible  second  project,  intended  for  2004,  may  support  further  reform  of  road \n37. \nprovision and road maintenance funding, and implement reform milestones of transport services \nand other aspects of that provision of passenger transport services.  Its investment component \nmay  finance  improvement  of  NHs,  transport  services,  and  road  safety.  The  possible  third \nproject,  intended  for  2006,  may  complete  the  reform  of  road  provision.  Its  investment \ncomponent may finance road network development and road safety improvement. \n \n38. \nImplementation  of  the  sector  framework  is  intended  to  have  the  following  outcomes  (i) \nRDA  will  have  strong  core  competencies  in  the  engineering,  strategic  planning,  and \nmanagement of the NH network; (ii) a strong domestic private sector capacity in road provision \nwill  have  been  established,  and  most  of  RDA\u2019s  domestically  financed  road  works  and \nengineering  services  will  be  carried  out  by  the  domestic  private  sector  on  the  basis  of \ncompetition; (iii) the role of RCDC in road provision will have been reduced substantially; (iv) the \ncapacity of PRAs in Uva, North Western, North Central, and Western provinces will have been \nimproved;  (v)  RDA  and  the  PRAs  will  have  established  objective  systems  for  selecting  road \nmaintenance work on the basis of economic returns, and capacity for operating these systems \nused for annual programming; (vi) RDA and the PRAs will have sufficient maintenance budgets \nto  ensure  that  roads  are  adequately  maintained  on  a  sustainable  basis;  (vii)  the efficiency of \ntransport services will have improved; and (viii) road safety will have improved. \n \nThe Government has demonstrated its commitment to the reform program by performing \n39. \na  number  of  actions:  (i)  Cabinet  approved  plans  for  increasing  domestic  private  sector \nparticipation in road works and decreasing the role of RCDC; (ii) contracting out packages of a \ncombined  value  of  SLRs1  billion;  (iii)  training  and  piloting  the  improved  road  maintenance \nbudgeting  and  expenditure  control;  (iv)  establishment  of  a  Public-Private  Partnership  Task \nForce to provide a forum for regular client-contractor dialogue, a Reform Implementation Unit in \nRDA, and a dedicated road agency in each project province.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\nThe  main  objective  is  to  improve  transport  efficiency,  contributing  to  the  expansion  of \n40. \neconomic opportunities and the reduction of poverty by (i) strengthening national and provincial \nroads  institutions  to  perform  their  core  role  of  strategic  management  and  planning  of  the  road \nnetwork;  (ii)  developing  strong,  competitive  domestic  capacity  for  road  construction  and \nengineering services; (iii) planning, executing, and financing road maintenance on a sustainable \nbasis; and (iv) upgrading and increasing the capacity of priority roads. The Project will also (i) \nincrease  private  sector  participation  in  the  road  sector  by  outsourcing  construction  and \nmaintenance works and engineering services, and  exploring opportunities for private operation \nof bus services; and (ii) improve the governance of the road sector by increasing transparency.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 9 \n\nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nReform Program \n\na. \n\nReform of National Highways Provision \n\n41. \nTwo sets of reforms are needed to improve the performance of NH provision: (i) transfer \nmost  road  construction  and  engineering  activities  to  be  carried  out  by  the  domestic  private \nsector on the basis of competition, with a commensurate decrease in the role of RCDC;17 and \n(ii) strengthen the performance and capacity of public sector institutions, notably RDA, through \nimplementation  of  the  agreed  upon  reengineering  action  plan  (REAPs).  These  reforms  are \ninterdependent and will be implemented in parallel. A summary of the REAPs is in Appendix 6.  \n \n42. \nPrivate Sector Participation. The arrangements are in Appendix 7. RDA will increase \nthe proportion of domestic financing under CF civil works and engineering for road construction \nand  maintenance  works  contracted  out  to  the  domestic  private  sector.  There  will  be  a \ncommensurate reduction in work performed by RCDC. Since RCDC presently accounts for the \nmajority of domestic capacity and existing private sector capacity is limited, responsibilities will \nbe transferred in stages. For civil works over SLRs2.5 million per contract, which constitute the \nmajority  of  RDA  expenditure  on  works,  RDA  will  contract  out  SLRs1  billion  in  2002,  SLRs1.5 \nbillion in 2003, SLRs2 billion in 2004, 50% in 2006, and 75% in 2008.  \n \n43. \nRCDC will have an important role to play in reform implementation during the first 3-year \ntransitional period to build up private sector capacity and mitigate the possible risks of contractor \nfailure  through  subcontracting  arrangements,  on-the-job supervision, and training; supplement \ntheir  equipment  and  other  inputs;  and  guarantee  the  performance  of  the  works  to  RDA. \nThereafter, all contractors will be engaged directly by RDA on the basis of competitive bidding. \nBy that time RDA will establish a strong contract management system. \n \n44. \nRDA  will  consolidate  CF  expenditures  on  small  works  into  larger  and  more  efficient \npackages.  For  the  duration  of  the  reform  program,  the  annual  total  expenditure  (in  nominal \nterms) on packages under SLRs2.5 million will not be increased beyond the 2000 level.  \n \n45. \nREAPs for development of the private sector and RCDC include (i) developing options to \novercome  plant  availability  constraints;  (ii)  establishment  of  an  Aggregate  Supply  Information \nUnit  in  RDA;  (iii)  contractor  training  through  the  Institute  of  Construction  Training  and \nDevelopment,  and  (iv)  support  for  RCDC  and  RDA  staff  to  set  up  independent,  private \nconsulting  engineering  firms  capable  of  preparing  feasibility  studies,  detailed  design,  and \nbidding  documents;  and  assisting  in  the  procurement  process,  contract  management, \nconstruction  supervision,  and  TA  to  the  private  contractors.  Initially,  three  teams  will  be \nestablished: the design team, supervision team, and TA team. \n \n46. \nReengineering  RDA.  REAPs  for  reengineering  RDA  include  (i)  strengthening  of \nplanning and programming, (ii) strengthening of preconstruction processes, (iii) strengthening of \nconstruction  management,  (iv)  strengthening  of  road  maintenance  management,  (v) \nestablishment  of  technical  audit,  (vi)  road  maintenance  funding;  and  (vii)  improving  the  LAR \nprocess.  These  will  focus  on  progressively  reforming  RDA\u2019s  business  processes  and \nstrengthening its capacity to enable it to effectively and efficiently manage the NH system.  \n\n                                                 \n17 As Sri Lanka\u2019s highway network will be significantly expanded in the coming years (para. 16), there will be enough \n\ndemand to absorb the existing labor force in the road industry.  \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nREAPs  to  strengthen  planning  and  programming  will  develop  the  capacity  of  RDA's \n47. \nPlanning  Division  to  identify,  formulate,  and  evaluate  projects  systematically  and  establish a \nformal  process  of  developing  multi-year  highway  development  programs.  A  5-year investment \nplan and a 20-year investment plan will be published by the end of 2003 and 2004, respectively. \n \n48. \nREAPs for strengthening preconstruction processes and construction management will \nestablish the work processes and capacity to enable RDA to change from relying on RCDC to \nexecute  works  to  using  the  domestic  private  sector  under  contract,  focusing  on  project \npreparation and supervision competencies. In 2003, RDA will revise preconstruction processes, \nincluding  associated  manuals  and  technical  information,  and  complete  training  of  staff.  These \nwill be introduced on a pilot basis by the end of 2004, and fully applied by the end of 2005. \n \nUniform, internationally proven processes for the management of construction contracts \n49. \nwill  be  introduced.  In  2003,  RDA  will  have  prepared,  tested,  and  approved  the  improved \nconstruction  management  procedures,  including  procedures  for  quality  control,  scheduling \npayments, monitoring payments, variations, and dispute resolution, which will thereby improve \nquality  control,  payment  procedures,  and  decision  making.  These  will  be  introduced  on  a  pilot \nbasis by the end of 2004, and fully applied by the end of 2005. \n \n50. \nThe  REAP  for  strengthening  road  maintenance  management  will  establish  objective \nsystems  for  planning  and  programming  road  maintenance  works  on  the  basis  of economic \nreturns.  RDA  has  established  a  Maintenance  Management  Unit  responsible  for  planning, \nmanaging, and monitoring maintenance program. In 2003, this unit will develop and implement \na pavement management system for planning periodic maintenance, and establish a permanent \ncapacity  to  operate  the  system.  Based  on  that,  starting  for  2005,  RDA  will  prepare  an  annual \nperiodic  maintenance  plan.  In  2003,  a  routine  maintenance  management  system  will  also  be \nestablished for estimating the workload, budgeting,  and monitoring of routine maintenance, to \nbe applied in 2004 onward. \n \n51. \nThe REAP on road maintenance funding will streamline the road maintenance financing \nsystem  and  implement  a  strategy  for  increasing  road  maintenance financing. The streamlined \nroad maintenance budgeting and expenditure control is being implemented on a pilot basis, and \nwill  be  fully  implemented  under  the  Project.  In  2003,  the  Government  will  (i)  assess  ways  of \novercoming the shortfall between the required maintenance financing needs and the amount of \nmaintenance  allocations  provided,  (ii)  formulate  financing  mechanism  to  reduce  the  shortfall, \nand  (iii)  assess  the  amount  that  could  be  raised  under  different  options  including  fuel  levy.  By \nmid-2004, a sustainable road maintenance financing mechanism to ensure adequate allocations \nwill  be  proposed,  and  targets  for  progressively  increasing  maintenance  budgets  to  the  levels \nrequired to sustain the country\u2019s road assets will be agreed upon, to be applied starting in 2005. \n \nThrough  the  REAP  for  technical  audit,  RDA  will  establish  a  technical  audit  capacity  to \n52. \nsupport  management  control  over  technical  performance.  By  the  end  of  2003,  technical  audit \nprocedures and guidelines will have been developed and tested. \n \nThe  REAP  for  LAR  will  streamline  the  LAR  system  and  implement  a  strategy  for \n53.  \nensuring  that  the  process  will  be  carried  out  effectively  and  efficiently  in  accordance with the \nNational  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy.  The  plan  consists  of  institutional  strengthening, \nstreamlining procedures, and capacity building. RDA will establish a Social Impact Division and \nrecruit  a  sociologist/resettlement  specialist  to  head  the  division.  The  division  will  consist  of \nappropriately  skilled  staff,  redeployed  from  within  RDA  or  seconded  from  other  agencies.  By \nJune 2003, standard procedures as remedial measures of LAR problems will be introduced, and \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 11 \n\nremedial  measures  of  resettlement  plan  and  resettlement  implementation  problems  will  be \nproposed  to  be  approved  by  an  interministerial  committee18  and  to  be  adopted  by  December \n2003. The approved procedures will be tested in preparing a resettlement plan for the national \nhighways  development  project.  The  effectiveness  of  the  streamlined  procedures  will  be \nevaluated, and further improvements will be recommended as necessary by the end of 2004. \n \n\nb. \n\nStrengthening Provincial Road Provision \n\nThrough  an \n\nIDP  the  Project  will  transform  the  PRAs 19  into  professional  road \n54. \ninfrastructure managers with a focus on maintaining the PR network efficiently and effectively. \nThe  PRAs  will  be  responsible  for  the  planning  and  programming  of  the  road  maintenance \nbudget,  preliminary  and  detailed  design  of  works,  contract  preparation  and  tendering  out \nmaintenance and upgrading works, as well as implementation and contract management. The \nnew structures will divide responsibilities between headquarters and divisional level branches of \nthe agencies. Planning, programming, designing, and procurement functions will be centralized \nat  the  headquarters,  while  part  of  procurement,  implementation  and  contract  management \nfunctions  will  be  devolved  to  the  divisional  level.  All  road  works, except for emergency works, \nwill  be  carried  out  by  contracting  out.  The  IDP  will  also  include  upgrading  PRA  offices  and \nprocuring equipment consistent with the agreed upon functions.  \n \n55.  Modern  road  management  as  well  as  office  management  practices  will  need  to  be \nintroduced.  This  will  include  the  introduction  of  appropriate  information  and  communication \ntechnology tools such as the Road Economic Decision Model, developed by the World Bank, to \ncarry  out  the  planning  and  programming  functions,  appropriate  engineering  software  to  aid  in \ncarrying  out  detailed  design  work,  the  road  maintenance  budgeting  and  expenditure  control \nmodule for financial management, as well as appropriate project management and monitoring \nsoftware. This will involve providing long-term advisory support to the PRAs, consisting of both \ninternational and domestic supervisory staff, and short-term specialist inputs.  \n \n56. \nObjective road maintenance estimates will be prepared for each province. In the interim \nperiod, for FY2004 the Government has agreed to allocate a road maintenance budget of 10% \nmore than in FY1999.  By the end of 2004, assisted by the reform consultant, the Government \nwill  propose  a  road  maintenance  financing  mechanism  that  can  ensure  adequate  and \nsustainable financial allocations (para. 51), to be applied starting in 2005. \n \n57. \nA performance-based maintenance contract will be implemented starting in FY2005 for \nthe 20% of the PR network in maintainable condition. The contracts will be for a period of 5-7 \nyears and will be structured such that the capital expenditure is front-loaded while the payments \nare made in equal annual payments, starting with periodic maintenance in the first year followed \nby routine maintenance in the subsequent years of the contract period. The procurement of the \nthird phase civil works will be contingent on the achievement of the agreed upon milestones in \nthe IDP including road maintenance funding and implementation. \n \n\n2. \n\nInvestment Components \n\n58. \nThe proposed Project will include (i) civil works for rehabilitation of roads and bridges of \nabout  980  km  or  12%  of  the  PR  network  in  North  Central,  North Western, Uva, and Western \n\n                                                 \n18 Chaired by the Secretary of MOH, and members from MHAPCLG, Ministry of Land, Central Environmental Agency, \n\nRDA, Survey Department, Government Printer, Valuation Department, and Attorney General's Department. \n\n19 The project provinces consist of Western, North Western, North Central, and Uva provinces. \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nprovinces; (ii) improvement of about 40 km of community access roads; (iii) consulting services \nfor construction supervision and for detailed design of NH development. \n \n59. \nThe provincial roads improvement (PRI) component will rehabilitate existing roads in the \nproject provinces to maintainable standard. The roads will be widened to maximum 6.7 meters \nwhere  possible  and  the  pavement  will  be  strengthened.  Bridges,  drainage  structures,  and \nculverts  will  also  be  improved  and  replaced  as  necessary.  The  roads  were  determined  from \ndetailed  screening  based  on  road  condition,  traffic,  economic  viability,  economic  development \npotential,  and  social  factors,  taking  into  account  of  the  practicalities of combining road links in \npackages  to  be  implemented  economically.  The  community  access  roads  will  be  determined \nduring implementation based on the criteria of (i) connecting community or agricultural centers \nto  the  main  project  roads;  (ii)  covering  footpaths,  simple  bridges,  and  drainage;  and  (iii) \nmaximum 1 km length for each package to be included in the main civil works contracts. \n \nC. \n \nThe  estimated  total  cost  is  $92.5  million  equivalent  inclusive of taxes, duties, interest \n60. \nduring construction, and physical and price contingencies (Table 1). Foreign exchange costs are \nestimated  at  $32.8  million  (35.5%).  Local  currency  costs  are  estimated  at  $59.7  million \nequivalent (64.5%).

This  loan  will  be \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 13 \n\nadministered by ADB. As shown in Table 2, ADB will provide a loan of $56.5 million equivalent, \nor  61.1%  of  the  total  project  cost,  from  its  Special  Funds  resources,  to  finance  74.1%  of  the \nforeign  exchange  costs  and  54.1%  of  the  local  currency  costs.  The  ADB  loan  will  have  an \namortization period of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest rate of 1.0% \nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  thereafter.  The  Government  will  finance  29.7%  of  the  total \nproject cost, in local currency.20   \n\nSource \nADB \nOPEC Fund \nGovernment a \nTotal \na  \n\nIncluding taxes and duties. \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n24.3 \n8.5  \n0.0 \n32.8 \n\nLocal  \nCurrency \n32.2 \n0.0 \n27.5 \n59.7 \n\n \nTotal \n56.5 \n8.5 \n27.5 \n92.5 \n\n \n% \n61.1 \n9.2 \n29.7 \n100.0 \n\n \n62. \nBecause  of  the  constraints  imposed  by  recent  macroeconomic  imbalances,  the \nbudgetary  burden  of  the  civil  conflict,  and  uncertain  medium-term  economic  prospects,  the \nGovernment  has  been  unable  to  finance  a  substantial  portion  of  its  investment  program.  The \nsituation has been exacerbated by the global economic slowdown, adverse weather conditions, \nand  the  negative  effect  of  the  attack  on  Colombo  international  airport  in  July  2001.  An \nagreement on a permanent ceasefire was signed in February 2002. Two rounds of peace-talks \nwere  successfully  concluded  in  September  and  November  2002.  The  Government  is  currently \nimplementing an economic reform program to stabilize macroeconomic and reduce the budget \ndeficit, but it is likely to still have difficulties for some years.21 Therefore, providing financing for \nlocal currency costs is considered justified under ADB\u2019s local currency financing policy. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nAs shown in Appendix 9, monitoring of overall implementation performance and use of \n63. \nloan funds will be the responsibility of the project steering committee, chaired by the secretary of \nMHAPCLG,  and  with  representation  from  Ministry  of  Finance,  MTHCA,  MOH,  RDA,  External \nResources  Department,  National  Planning  Department,  regional  development  ministries,  the \nproject provincial councils, PRAs, and project implementation consultant. \n \n\na. \n\nNational Highway Provision   \n\n64.  MTHCA will be the Executing Agency for the NH provision. The chairperson of RDA will \nbe  responsible  for  implementation  activities,  reporting  to  the  secretary  of  MTHCA  through  the \nsecretary of MOH. A reform implementation unit (RIU) has been established in RDA, which will \ncoordinate implementation of the reform program and assist the directors of the RDA operating \n                                                 \n20 As requested by the Government, JBIC is considering parallel cofinancing to improve PRs and strengthen PRAs in \nSabaragamuwa and Central provinces. ADB and JBIC have extensively coordinated respective scope, financing, \nand  implementation  arrangements.  Both  confirmed  synergistic  and  balanced  development  impacts  of  the \nsimultaneous and well-coordinated interventions. JBIC is currently conducting its due diligence, to be completed by \nthe  end  of  2002,  of  its  loan  in  the  amount  of  about  $80  million,  based  on  the  UNDP-funded  feasibility  study \n(para.19). \n\n21ADB  is  supporting  public  sector  resource  management  through  TAs  for  the  Strengthening  Public  Expenditure \n\nManagement System , 1999, and for the Public Sector Resources Management, 2002. \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\ndivisions  in  its  implementation.  RDA,  in  consultation  with  MTHCA  and  MOH,  has  appointed  a \nfull-time  director  as  head  of  RIU  with  sufficient  capability  and  experience  to  be  effective  in \ndealing  with  the  senior  management  of  RDA  and  RCDC.  RDA  will  establish  implementation \nunits in its operating divisions to carry out the REAPs. A reform consultant is being appointed to \nassist RIU and the RDA implementation units. RDA will also be responsible for the design of NH \ndevelopment.  \n \n65. \nA  reform  program  steering  committee  (RPSC),  comprising  representatives  from  the \npublic  and  private  sectors,  will  be  established  to  oversee  the  reform  program  and  facilitate \ncoordination between the government agencies and the private sector. Chaired by the secretary \nof  MTHCA,  the  RPSC  will  include  representatives  of  MOH,  RDA,  RCDC,  External  Resources \nDepartment,  the  Institute  of  Construction  Training  and  Development  (ICTAD),  the  Contractors\u2019 \nAssociation,  the  Consultants\u2019  Association,  and  ADB\u2019s  Sri  Lanka  Resident  Mission.  A  Public-\nPrivate  Partnership  Task  Force,  chaired  by  the  chairperson  of  RDA,  has  been  established  to \nprovide a forum for regular client-contractor dialogue.  \n \n\nb. \n\nProvincial Road Provision and Provincial Roads Improvement \n\n66. \nThe  Executing  Agency  for  the  reform  of  PR  provision  and  the  PRI  component  will  be \nMHAPCLG,  which  will  be  responsible  for  overall  coordination  of  project  implementation \nincluding provision of policy guidance, and interagency coordination. A project coordination unit \n(PCU)  will  be  established,  responsible  for  planning,  management,  consultant  selection, \nprocurement, supervision, and coordination. The PCU, reporting to the secretary, headed by a \nsuitably qualified project director, will be supported by a technical specialist, an accountant, an \nengineer, and supporting staff.  \n \n67. \nThrough  previous  projects  and  TAs,  MHAPCLG  has  obtained  relevant  experience  and \nestablished  implementation  capacity,  and  will  be  further  augmented  through  the  consulting \nservices for supervision and IDP.  \n \n68. \nIn  each  of  the  4  PRAs,  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  established,  to  be \nresponsible for implementation of the Project in their respective provinces under the direction of \nthe  PCU,  and  in  consultation  with  MHAPCLG  for  important  policy  or  implementation  issues. \nPIUs  will  be  responsible  for  procurement  and  project  management,  including  (i)  procurement \nand  contract  award,  (ii)  monitoring  the  progress  of  day-to-day  project  implementation,  (iii) \npreparing  withdrawal  applications,  (iv)  preparing  progress  reports,  and  (v)  maintaining  project \naccounts and complete loan financial records for auditing. A project manager, who is currently \nresponsible  for  the  respective  PRA,  will  be  assigned,  and  will  be  supported  by  a  group  of \nprofessional and support staff with expertise and experience in procurement, accounting, road \nand structural engineering, construction supervision, and contract administration. Monitoring of \nperformance  and  use  of  funds  at  the  provincial  level  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  project \nmonitoring committee in each province, chaired by the chief secretary of the provincial council \nand with representation from the PRA and the implementation consultant. \n \n\n2. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\n69. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  6  years  inclusive  of  preconstruction \nactivities,  reflecting  the  time  required  for  specification  and  packaging  of  civil  works  contracts, \nand  the  approach  to  implementation,  which  will  support  capacity  building  within  the  PRA  and \namong  domestic  private  contractors,  with  support  from  the  implementation  consultant.  The \nscheduled completion date for the civil works is December 2007 (Appendix 10).  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n 15 \n\n3. \n\nProcurement of Civil Works and Equipment \n\n70. \nProcurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor  Procurement  and  the  Government\u2019s  tender  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. The civil works \ncontracts will be mainly for low-value rehabilitation works spread over a wide geographical area, \nand  are  unlikely  to  be  attractive  to  foreign  contractors.  Therefore,  civil  works  contracts,  with \neach  contract  valued  at  a  maximum  of  $2.0  million  equivalent,  will  be  procured  under  LCB \nprocedures. Supply contracts with values of $100,000-500,000 and for less than $100,000 will \nbe procured through international shopping and direct purchase arrangements respectively.  \n \n71. \nBidders will be prequalified by applying a single stage, two-envelope bidding procedure. \nEligible  bidders  will  be  either  domestic  private  sector  companies  appropriately  registered  with \nICTAD  or  foreign  companies  in  civil  works  from  ADB's  member  countries.  RCDC  and  other \nstate-owned  company  will  not  be  eligible  to  bid.  This  restriction  reflects  the  emphasis  of  the \nProject  on  establishing  a  competitive  domestic  private  sector  capacity  in  the  road  sector.  The \nprevious  ADB-funded  projects  in  Sri  Lanka  have  demonstrated that domestic contractors are \ncapable  of  successfully  performing  provincial  road  improvement  contracts  of  this  value  with \nextensive capacity-building support from a supervision consultant. \n \nCivil  works  contracts  are  indicated  for  52  road  and  19  bridge  contract  packages \n72. \n(Appendix 11) based on their geographical location and convenience for contractors to mobilize \nand  organize  their  works,  and  will  be  implemented  in  three  phases.  The  equipment  for  the \nreform  program  and  IDP  (Appendix  12)  will  be  procured  using  international  shopping  or  direct \npurchase  procedures.  Supply  contracts  for  equipment  will  be  packaged  based  on  technical \nrequirements  of  the  equipment  and  will  be  finalized  during  project  implementation. Civil works \nfor office upgrading have an estimated value of less than $100,000 per province. These will be \nprocured using government procurement procedures and will be fully Government-financed.  \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n73. \nThree  consulting  services  packages  will  be  required  under  the  loan,  each  requiring  an \ninternational  consulting  firm  in  association  with  domestic  consultants.  All  consultants  will  be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  using  a quality and \ncost-based selection method and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic consultants. ADB has approved advance action for recruitment of consultants, without \ncommitting approval of the Project or financing of the action. \n \n74. \nTo support the reform of NH provision, about 60 and 130 person-months of international \nand  domestic  consultants,  respectively,  will  be  required.  The  consultants  will  assist  RDA  to \nimplement  the  REAPs;  provide  training  to  RDA  staff  in  the  application  of  new  procedures  and \nsystems; and assist the RDA RIU to monitor and evaluate progress, as outlined in Appendix 13. \n \n75. \nA project implementation consultant will be required for (i) support to the PCU and PIUs \nin implementation of the PRI, (ii) IDP to strengthen the capability of the PRAs, and (iii) project \nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation.  About  295  and  1,850  person-months of international \nand  domestic  consulting  services,  respectively,  plus  supporting  staff  will  be  provided.  The \nconsultants will also provide on-the-job training to the counterpart staff (Appendix 14). \n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nThe consulting services for NH  development  will  conduct  detailed  design  of  the  roads \n76. \nselected for improvement by the ADB-funded TA feasibility study on NH development attached \nto the Project. Outline terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n77. \nLoan disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, as \namended  from  time  to  time,  and  detailed  arrangements  between  the  Government  and  ADB. \nTwo  imprest  accounts  will  be  established  at  the  Central  Bank,  one  is  with  RDA  with  an  initial \nadvance  of  $200,000,  and  the  other  is  with  MHAPCLG  with  an  initial  amount  of  $3.2  million. \nSecond  generation  imprest  accounts  will  be  given  to  the  PRAs,  with  an  initial  advance  of \n$800,000  each.  MHAPCLG  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  PRAs'  accounts,  including \nmonthly  reconciliation  of  the  accounts  and  preparation  of  the  withdrawal  applications  for \nliquidation/replenishment of the imprest account. Statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures \nwill be used for individual payment of less than $100,000.  \n \n\n6. \n\nProject Performance Management System \n\n78. \nThe Executing Agencies will monitor the preparation and implementation of the Project \nin accordance with the implementation schedule and the time-bound reform milestones, and will \nkeep ADB informed of any significant deviations resulting in the milestones not being met.  \n \n\na.  \n\nAccounts and Audit \n\n \n\nb. \n\nReports \n\nThe  Executing  Agencies  and  PIUs  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts \n79. \nadequate  to  identify  the  financing  resources  received  and  expenditures  made  on  the  Project. \nThese Project accounts and related financial statements will be audited annually in accordance \nwith  sound  auditing  standards  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  Government  will  submit \nannual audited reports and related financial statements to ADB within 9 months after the end of \neach  fiscal  year.  The  audit  of  the  imprest  account  and  SOE  can  be  carried  out  as  part  of  the \nregular annual audit. The auditor\u2019s opinion of that part of the examination relating to the imprest \naccount and SOE should be separately set out in the auditor\u2019s report. \n \n \n \n80. \nThe  Executing  Agencies  will  submit  to  ADB  and  the  OPEC  Fund  monthly  progress \nreports on their respective components in such forms and detail as required, based on which, \nwith  assistance  from  the  consultants,  the  overall  Project  performance  report  will  be  submitted \nquarterly  by  the  PSC.  The  RPSC  will  provide  independent  verification  of  the  progress  in \nimplementation  of  the  reform  program,  including  achievement  of  the  milestones.  The  quarterly \nreport is an executive summary of the detailed reports, including basic data, utilization of funds, \nachievement of immediate development objectives, compliance with covenants, implementation \nprogress, and major issues and problems. Initially, a baseline for performance monitoring will be \nestablished  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Project  Performance  Management  System  Handbook, \nbased on the key indicators and targets outlined in the project framework.  \n \n81.  Within  3  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  Government  will  furnish  to \nADB  a  project  completion  report  providing  a  detailed evaluation of the project design, costs, \ncontractors\u2019 and consultants\u2019 performance, social and economic impact, economic rate of return, \nand other details as may be requested by ADB.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 17 \n\n82.  With assistance from the reform consultants, support will be provided for promoting high \nstandards of transparency and cost-effectiveness in procurement by RDA: (i) establishing of an \nRDA  website  supporting  the  introduction  of  e-procurement  activities  by  the  end  of  2003, \nincluding provision of information about upcoming tenders, and disclosure of tender awards; and \n(ii)  conducting  an  evaluation  in  2004  of  the  transparency,  efficiency,  and  cost  effectiveness  of \nRDA\u2019s arrangements and procedures for procuring civil works from the private sector, and their \nadequacy for supporting development of a competitive domestic road contracting industry.  \n\n \n\nc. \n\nProject Review \n\n83. \nIn addition to regular reviews by ADB staff, a detailed midterm review of the  Project will \nbe carried out around June 2004. The Government will submit to ADB a detailed progress report \non  the  implementation  and  achievements  of  the  reform  program,  and  accomplishment  of  the \nreform implementation milestones, 2 months prior to the midterm review.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n84. \nA  project  preparatory  TA  for  $850,000  for  the  National  Highways  Development \n(Appendix 15) will be provided covering the feasibility study for development of priority NHs for \ninclusion  as  an  investment  component  for  possible  future  ADB  financing.  The  medium-term \nhighway development plan (para. 47) will provide basis for selecting the NHs under the TA.  \n \n85. \nA TA for $500,000 for Passenger Transport Services Improvement (Appendix 16) will be \nprovided  to  (i)  formulate  institutional  and  policy  reforms  needed  to  secure  the  efficient, \nequitable,  and  sustainable  delivery  of  passenger  transport  services  by  both  private  and  public \noperators;  (ii)  assist  in  the  implementation  of  the  current  Government  initiative  to  introduce \npublic-private  partnerships  in  the  state-owned  bus  sector;  and  (iii)  prepare  complementary \npriority investments in the passenger bus sector. The TA will develop a program of institutional \nand  policy  reform  measures  for  improving  transport  services  using  roads,  including  regulatory \nissues  relating  to  the  operation  of  buses,  and  management  of  bus  stations  and  bus  stands. \nThese will take into account their overall importance to providing the general public with efficient \ntransport  services,  the  potential  contribution  to  poverty  reduction,  the  scope  for  increased \nprivate  sector  participation,  and  opportunity  to  introduce  innovations  to  improve  transparency \nand governance in general. \n \n86. \nBoth  TAs  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Special  Fund  funded  by  the \nGovernment  of  Japan.  Each  TA  will  be  carried  out  by  a  team  of  domestic  and  international \nconsultants, to be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts \n\n87. \nThe  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  be  people,  companies,  and  government  and \nnongovernment  agencies  throughout  the  country  that  use  road  transport  services  directly  or \nindirectly. The beneficiaries of the investment component will be (i) communities served by the \nproject  roads  that  will  benefit  from  improved,  lower  cost,  and  faster  transport  services, and \nthereby  obtain  improved  access  to  economic  opportunities  and  social  services,  and  reduced \nisolation  or  remoteness  from  other  parts  of  the  country;  (ii)  transport  operators  serving  these \ncommunities; and (iii) companies and employees operating or serving these communities. \n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n1. \n\nPolicy and Institutional Aspects \n\n88. \nThe Project and TAs will improve the overall performance of the road sector, contributing \nto  transport  efficiency.  This  will  improve  the  returns  and  sustainability  of  existing  and  future \ninvestments  in  the  sector,  and  contribute  to  the  growth  of  a  wide  range  of  other  economic \nactivities  that  make  use  of  road  transport  services.  Access  to  improved  bus  and  road  freight \nservices  will  help  to  reduce  poverty  by  enabling  growth  in  poor  peoples\u2019  incomes  and \nemployment, reducing transport services costs, and improving access to social services.  \n \n89. \nThe  Project  will  open  up  the  market  for  road  provision  works  for  private  sector \ndevelopment. This will include increasing the proportion of civil works and engineering assigned \nto  the  domestic  private  sector.  The  Project  will  also  address  issues  of  plant  availability, \naggregate supply, contractor training, and establishment of private consulting engineering firms. \nReflecting  the  emphasis  of  the  Project  on  establishing  a  competitive  domestic  private  sector \ncapacity, all civil works will be designed for LCB contracts, and no state-owned agencies will be \neligible to bid. Bus regulation, efficiency of bus operators, and management of bus stations and \nbus stands will also be addressed under the proposed TA. \n \n90. \nOverall, the Project will develop a program of institutional and policy reform for improving \nthe  efficiency  of  road  sector  institutions  including  government  agencies,  the  private  sector \ncontracting industry, and transport services operators. This will provide the general public with \nefficient transport, the potential contribution to poverty reduction, the scope for increased private \nsector participation, and innovations to improve transparency and governance in general. \n \n\n2. \n\nTechnical Aspects \n\n91. \nThe  PRI  will  involve  rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  about  980  km  of  roads  in  the \nproject  provinces  to  maintainable  standard  roads.  The  existing  roads  will  be  widened  where \npossible; the pavement will be strengthened; and bridges, culverts, and drainage structures will \nalso be improved and replaced as necessary.  These will improve the capacity, safety, and level \nof service of the roads. Also, a sustainable road maintenance funding scheme developed under \nthe Project will ensure that the existing roads reach their design life.  \n \n\n3. \n\nSocial Aspects \n\n92. \nLack of capacity and poor condition of roads are among the main constraints preventing \npoor  people  from  gaining  access  to  economic  opportunities  and  good  quality  services.  The \nProject  will  improve  the  overall  performance  of  the  road  sector,  thereby  alleviating  these \nconstraints and contributing to poverty reduction. \n \nThe  Project  roads  serve  communities  located  away  from  the  centers  of  economic \n93. \nactivity, which have high poverty levels due to a lack of available economic opportunities, poor \neducational attainment, and social problems. Estimated poverty rates in these areas (38%) are \nabove the national rates (30%). The poor earn low incomes because they are engaged in poorly \nremunerated  activities  (farm  labor)  or  are  unemployed.  Improvements  in  PRs  will  open  up  the \ncommunities to a range of new opportunities that will help to reduce poverty. The availability and \nfrequency  of  bus  and  road  freight  services  will  increase,  and  the  travel  time  and  cost for the \nservices  will  decrease.  The  contributions  to  poverty  reduction  include  (i)  improved  access  for \nfarmers  to  higher  price  urban  markets  and  to  produce  higher  value,  perishable  products;  (ii) \nincreased  access  to  employment  opportunities  outside  the  community;  (iii)  lower  cost  of \ntransport services; and (iv) improved access to education and other social services. The poverty \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 19 \n\nimpact ratios of representative roads for Uva, North Western, and North Central provinces are \nestimated to be more than 0.5, well above the poor's share of national income.  \n \n94. \nThe  PRI  does  not  require  LAR.  No  new  roads  will  be  developed.  The  works  were \ndesigned,  using  engineering  solutions,  to  ensure  that  improvements  will  be  within  the  existing \nright-of-way and to avoid resumption of right-of-way if this would cause displacement.  \n \n95. \nThe  Project  will  generate  direct  and  indirect  employment  opportunities  in  the  private \nsector.  However,  there  will  be  a  gradual  reduction  of  casual  labor  within  RCDC  and  RDA.  A \ntransition  plan  is  being  prepared  that  may  include  (i)  freezing  recruitment,  (ii)  early  retirement \npackages,  and  (iii)  incentives  to  private  contractors  to  hire  them.  The  Government  will  ensure \nthat the mechanisms of casual labor reduction comply with all applicable labor laws in Sri Lanka \nand take into account ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy. \n \n\n4. \n\nEconomic Aspects \n\nThe overall improvement in the performance of the roads sector will increase transport \n96. \nefficiency. This will improve the returns and sustainability of existing and future investments in \nthe sector, and contribute to growth of a wide range of other economic activities that use road \ntransport services. Without  the  improvements,  traffic  will  incur  high  transport  operating  costs \ndue to poor road conditions. With the improvements, these costs will be reduced.   \n \n97. \nThe  economic  analysis  (Appendix  18)  of  the  PRI  considers  the  estimated costs and \nbenefits over the construction period and 20 years of operation. The estimated costs consist of \ninvestment costs and incremental operating costs. The estimated benefits are savings in vehicle \noperating  costs  and  passenger  time.  The  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  the \noverall Project is 26.1%, or 23.1% for North Central, 21.1% for North Western, 17.8% for Uva, \nand 36.6% for Western provinces. The switching value is 123% for costs and 55% for benefits. \nSensitivity tests carried out to examine the impact of higher investment costs and lower benefits \nall show an acceptable estimated economic internal rate of return.  \n \n\n5. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\n98. \nThe  PRI  is  classified  as  an  environmental  category  B  project.  The initial environmental \nexamination  (IEE),  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  environmental  guidelines,  confirmed \nthat  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  expected  and  that  a  detailed \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  is  not  required.  A  supplementary  study  examined  possible \nimpacts  on  Sri  Lankan  elephants,  and  found  them  insignificant.  The  PIUs  will  implement \nenvironmental management and monitoring plans for the road improvements. A Summary IEE \noutlines  the  measures  to  be  incorporated  in  civil  works  contracts  and  to  form  part  of  the \nconstruction  supervision  team\u2019s  duties  to  mitigate  environmental  impacts  during  construction. \nAn  environmental  expert  will  be  hired  under  the  consultant  to  strengthen  the  PRAs  in \nenvironmental assessment and mitigation. RDA capacity in preconstruction processes, including \nin environmental impact assessment, will be strengthened as necessary. \n \nB. \n\nProject Risks \n\n99. \nThe significant risk for the Project is that the reform program will not be implemented in \nfull, leading to improvements in sector performance being less than intended. This risk has been \nmitigated  in  the  design  of  the  Project  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  upon  medium-term \nprogram, with milestones that have to be met for future ADB involvement in the sector.  \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n100.  A risk for road investments under the Project is that operation and maintenance will be \ninadequate. This risk will be addressed directly through the reform program elements to improve \nthe planning, execution, and financing of road maintenance. These will include (i) strengthening \nof  road  maintenance  management  and  establishing  objective  systems  for  planning  and \nprogramming road maintenance works on the basis of economic returns; (ii) road maintenance \nworks  to  be  undertaken  by  the  private  sector  on  the  basis  of  competition;  and  (iii)  road \nmaintenance  budgeting  and  expenditure  control,  and  mechanism \nincreasing  road \nmaintenance funding to the levels required to sustain the country\u2019s road assets. \n \n101.  The  economic  analysis  of  the  provincial  road  improvements  suggests  there  are  no \nsignificant  economic  risks.  As  is  generally  expected  in  the  case  for  road  rehabilitation  and \nimprovement works of this kind, the estimated economic returns are high.  \n \n102.  The main implementation risks for the provincial road improvements concern the limited \nexperience  and  capacity  of  contractors.  These  are  mitigated  by  the  relatively  simple  nature  of \nthe  works.  Sufficient  provision  has  been  made  for  the  project  implementation  consultant  to \nsupervise contractors and provide assistance and training to build up their skills and capacity. \n \n103.  The risk of inadequate counterpart funding has been addressed by gaining government \ncommitment to include the Project in its core projects starting in FY2003 to ensure that budget \nallocations for it will be protected. \n \n\nfor \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n104.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, which will be incorporated into the legal documents: \n \n\nCounterpart  funds.    The  Government  will  ensure  the  timely  and  adequate \nprovision of counterpart funds for the Project. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nEnvironmental.  The Government will ensure that the Project complies with the \nADB  environmental  guidelines,  and  all  environmental  mitigation  measures \nidentified in the Summary IEE are incorporated in the design, and followed during \nthe construction, operation, and maintenance of the Project. \n\nPrivate  sector  participation.    The  Government  will  ensure  that  consolidated \nfund-financed road works over SLRs2.5 million per contract will be contracted out \nto the domestic private sector in Sri Lanka in the amount of (a) SLRs1.5 billion in \nFY2003, (b) SLRs2.0 billion in FY2004, (c) no less than 50% of such contracts in \nFY2006, and (d) no less than 75% of such contracts in FY2008. \n\n(iv) \n\nReengineering RDA \n\n(a)  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the  RDA  annual  expenditure  on  contracts \nunder SLRs2.5 million during FY2002-FY2008 is not above the FY2000 level.  \n\n(b)  RDA  will  publish  a  medium-term  highway  development  plan  by  December \n\n2003 and a long-term highway development plan by December 2004. \n\n(c)  RDA will approve revised preconstruction processes by December 2003 and \napply  them  by  December  2005,  and  improve  construction  management \n\n\f \n\n \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n 21 \n\nprocedures to be applied on a pilot basis by December 2004 and apply them \nto all RDA construction projects by December 2005.       \n\n(d)  RDA  will,  by  December  2003,  develop  pavement  management  and  routine \nmaintenance management systems, and apply them starting in FY2004. \n\n(e)  The  Government  will  implement  streamlined  road  maintenance  budgeting \nand expenditure control procedures starting in 2003; formulate and propose a \nfinancing mechanism for sustainable road maintenance for ADB approval by \nJune 2004; and apply the approved mechanism commencing in FY2005. \n\n(f)  RDA will establish a technical audit unit, and develop and test technical audit \n\nprocedures by December 2003. \n\n(g)  The  Government  will  establish  an  interministerial  committee  and  a  Social \nImpact  Division  within  RDA  in  2003,  and  develop  and  approve  streamlined \nprocedures and strategies for improving LAR in the road sector in accordance \nwith  the  National  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy, by December 2003.     \n\nStrengthening  provincial  road  administration.    The  Government  will  ensure \nthat in the project provinces (a) the provincial councils will establish a dedicated \nroad agency by December 2003; (b) in FY2004 the road maintenance budget will \nbe allocated 10% more than in FY1999; (c) all routine and periodic maintenance \nwill be contracted out starting in FY2003; (d) PRAs will implement performance-\nbased maintenance contracts for at least 20% of the maintainable road length in \nFY2005;  and  (e)  the  approved  road  maintenance  financing  mechanism  shall  be \napplied commencing in FY2005.    \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n105. \nADB and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 42,750,000 to \nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Road Sector Development \nProject,  with  a  term  of  32  years  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  an \ninterest  charge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreements \npresented to the Board; and \n\nthe administration by ADB of a loan not exceeding the equivalent of $8.5 million \nto  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Road  Sector \nDevelopment  Project  to  be  provided  by  the  OPEC  Fund  for  International \nDevelopment  under  the  terms  of  a  Letter  of  Cooperation  to  be  entered  into \nbetween ADB and the OPEC Fund for International Development. \n\n25 November 2002 \n\n \n \nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n\n\f2\n2\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n \n\ni\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n\nDESIGN SUMMARY \n\nPROJECT TARGETS \n\nPROJECT MONITORING \nMECHANISM \n\nRISKS/ \nASSUMPTIONS \n\n \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\n \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\n \n\nGoal \n \nEconomic growth and poverty reduction in Project target \nareas \n\nPurpose \n\nImprovement of transport efficiency by  \n\n\u2022  Strengthening national and provincial road institutions \nto  perform  their  core  role  of  strategic  management \nand planning of the road network; \n\n\u2022  Developing strong, competitive domestic capacity for \n\nroad construction and engineering services; and \n\n\u2022  Investing in priority road improvements  \n \n\nIncreased per capita income in provinces and districts  \nImproved rural income and employment rates at \ndistrict, village, and household levels  \n\n\u2022  Reduced number of poor people in the project areas  \n\u2022 \nIncreased number of business enterprises registered \nwith local government \n\n\u2022  National and local \n\nstatistics \nSocioeconomic and \nhousehold surveys \nProject Performance \nAudit Report \n\nImproved road planning, programming, contract \nmanagement and implementation, land acquisition \nand resettlement, and road maintenance system \nIncreased proportion of RDA carried out by domestic \nprivate sector  \nImproved quality and cost effectiveness of road \nconstruction and maintenance works  \n\n\u2022  At least 40% of provincial roads in Project areas in \n\n\u2022 \n\nmaintainable standard \nIncreased freight and passenger flows and access to \neconomic and social services in the project areas \n\u2022  Reduced travel time and improved transport services \n\nin Project areas \n\n\u2022  Published road \n\ndevelopment strategies, \nplans, and programs  \n\u2022  Monitoring by Public-\n\nPrivate Partnership Task \nForce \n\n\u2022  PPMS surveys \n\u2022  Project completion report \n\u2022  Progress reports  \n\u2022  Review missions  \n\nComponents/Outputs  \n\n1.

Since  RCDC \npresently accounts for the majority of domestic capacity, and private sector capacity is limited, it \nwill  be  necessary  to  transfer  responsibility  for  road  provision  work  from  RCDC  to  the  private \nsector, and to do so in stages. This will be accomplished over a period of 7 years (from 2002 to \n2008). By the end of that period, RCDC will be performing about 25% of the work financed from \nthe  Consolidated  Fund,  and  the  private  sector  will  be  performing  about  75%.  RCDC  will  be \nprovided  with  the  full  autonomy  of  a  private  company  to  enable  it  to  realize  its  potential  for \nundertaking larger scale, equipment-intensive operations. \n \n2. \nTo  build  up  private  sector  capacity  and  mitigate  the  possible  risks  of  contractor  failure, \ntransitional  arrangements  will  be  adopted  for  engaging  private  contractors  during  the  first  3 \nyears. RCDC will engage private contractors on a subcontract basis, and in doing so will build \nup the capacity of the contractors through on-the-job supervision and training; supplement their \nequipment and other inputs; and guarantee the performance of the works to RDA. \n \n3. \nconstruction and maintenance works over SLRs2.5 million financed from the consolidated fund: \n \n\nThe  following  arrangements  will  be  adopted  for  the  private  sector  share  of  RDA \n\nIn 2002, RDA will assign SLRs1 billion of works to be carried out by the private \nsector,  with  RCDC  as  the  prime  contractor  and  20  qualified  local  private \ncontractors as subcontractors. The subcontractors will be assigned equal shares \nof the work, to be remunerated on the basis of the Highways Standard Rates.  \n\nIn 2003, RDA will assign SLRs1.5 billion of works to be carried out by the private \nsector.  The  10  most  successful  contractors  from  the  first  year  will  graduate  to \nworking under direct contract for RDA, using simplified procurement procedures, \nto carry out SLRs1 billion of works. The remaining SLRs0.5 billion works will be \nexecuted by the other 10 contractors, subcontracting through RCDC.  \n\nIn 2004, RDA will assign SLRs2 billion of works to be carried out by the private \nsector. The 10 subcontractors from the second year will graduate and, together \nwith the 10 graduated after the first year, will be engaged directly by RDA to carry \nout  SLRs1.5  billion  of  works,  using  simplified  procurement  procedures.  The \nremaining  SLRs0.5  billion  will  be  executed  by  10  additional  contractors  to  be \nengaged as subcontractors with RCDC as prime contractor. \n\nAt the end of 2005, the role of RCDC as an intermediary will come to an end. All \nwork by the private sector will be arranged through contracts between RDA and \nprivate contractors, which will be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding.  \n\nBy  2006,  the  private  sector  will  undertake  at  least  50%  of  this  work  (by  value), \nand by 2008, the private sector will undertake at least 75%. \n\n \nFor the duration of the reform program to be supported by the Asian Development Bank, \n4. \nthe total RDA annual expenditure on works under SLRs2.5 million will not be increased. RCDC \nand RDA will gradually reduce their casual labor, with no new recruitment.  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($ million)\n\nForeign\n\nLocal\n\nTotal\n\nFX\n\nLC\n\nFX\n\nLC\n\nLC\n\nADB \n\nOPEC\n\nGOSL\n\n% % Total\nBase \nCosts\n\nFX\n\nB.

An efficient road network, linking villages, \ntowns, and cities will provide stronger linkages between remote and poor regions and more developed markets. \nRemoval  of  the  physical  bottlenecks  in  the  road  network  and  improvement  of  the  policy  and  institution  will \nimprove the overall performance of the road sector, thereby alleviating these constraints and reducing poverty. \n \nB. \nThe proportion of poor among the project beneficiaries in 3 provinces will be significantly larger (52%, 47%, and \n55%) than their proportion in the overall population in the country (31%), the exception being Western Province \n(23%). However, the absolute number of the poor among beneficiaries in Western Province is more than 30% \nof the total poor beneficiaries. The Project is expected to (i) improve access for farmers to higher price urban \nmarkets  and  to  support  production  of  higher  value,  perishable  products;  (ii)  increase  access  to  employment \nopportunities outside the community; (iii) lower cost of transport services; and (iv) improve access to education, \nhealth, and other social services. \n \nC. \n\nProposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\nParticipation Process \n\u2022  Stakeholder analysis prepared:  \n\nYes. The policy and institutional reform program was developed based on the stakeholder analysis prepared \nunder TA 3110-SRI: Reengineering Road Sector Institution.  \n\n\u2022  Participation strategy: \n\n \n\nYes. The reform program was developed through stakeholder participation including government agencies to \nbe reformed, the private sector, chamber of commerce, civil society, the contractors association, the engineers \nassociation, and labor unions. Selection of the roads to be improved was based on social requirements, road \nconditions,  and  economic  importance.  Community  consultations  were  carried  out  to  determine  selection \npriority, including engineering solutions to exclude all resettlement impacts. Based on technical requirements, \nopportunities for local communities to work on the civil works, particularly earthworks, will be incorporated. \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \nInvestment component: Engineering solutions resulted in \navoiding all resettlement impacts. \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  Reform component: Strengthen Road Development \n\nAuthority and provincial councils in land acquisition and \nresettlement process \n\nEarthworks are a significant component of the civil works. The \nExecuting Agency will ensure that women and men are given \nequal opportunities for employment on the Project. Contractors \nwill be required to ensure equal payment for equal work. \nThese will be monitored by the supervision consultant. \nAccompanying technical assistance will be provided for \npassenger transport improvement, and the impact of the \nProject in reducing transport costs will be monitored. \nA transition plan is being prepared to gradually reduce casual \nlabor without layoffs. This may include freezing recruitment \nand an early retirement package. \nNone \n\nNone \n\n \nOutput \nPrepared \n\n\u2022  Not \n\napplicable \n\u2022  Action plan \n\nA specific \nclause will be \nincluded in \nbidding \ndocuments. \nYes \n\nUnder \npreparation \n\nNone \n\nNone \n\nPotential Issues \n\nD. \n \n \nSubject \nResettlement  None  \n\nSignificant,  \nNot Significant, \nUncertain, None \n\nGender \n\nNone \n\nAffordability \n\nNot known \n\nLabor \n\nNot significant \n\nNone \n\nNone \n\nIndigenous  \nPeople \nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 18 \n\n61 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nMethodology \n\nRoad Selection \n\nTraffic Forecasts \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  provincial  roads  improvements  compared  the  costs  and \n1. \nbenefits  of  the  with-  and  without-the-Project  scenarios.  In  the  without  case,  traffic  would \nexperience  high  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOC)  due  to  poor  road  conditions.  In  the  with  case, \nVOC would be lower as a result of road improvements. The analysis period covered 20 years of \noperation after completion of civil works. No residual value was allowed at the end of the period. \nCosts and benefits in financial prices were adjusted to economic prices by deducting taxes and \nduties and by applying a standard conversion factor of 0.785 to nontraded goods.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nA  survey  was  carried  out  on  more  than  2,000  provincial  roads  in  North  Central,  North \nWestern,  Uva,  and  Western  provinces,  covering  a  combined  length  of  about  5,100  kilometers \n(km). A simplified economic evaluation was carried out for the purpose of preliminary screening \nof candidate roads. The candidate road improvements were then ranked in order of estimated \neconomic  returns.  Drawing  upon  the  social  indicators  obtained  for  each  road,  a  social \ndevelopment  factor  was  calculated  for  each  candidate  road,  and  this  was  used  to  produce  a \nsocial  ranking.  A  combined  economic  and  social  ranking  was  then  prepared  and  used  for \nselecting roads for improvement in each of the four provinces. Based on this ranking, 175 road \nsections in 52 groups were selected for improvement, covering about 1,000 km.  \n \nC. \n \n3. \nAfter selection of the priority roads for improvement, the preliminary traffic counts were \nsupplemented by conducting a 2-day  12-hour count, from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm, on each of the \nselected  roads,  using  the  same  vehicle  categories  as  the  earlier  counts.  It  shows  that \nmotorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles had the highest prevalence among vehicle categories. \nVans and pick-ups were the four-wheeled vehicle types with the highest prevalence. \n \nThe  annual  growth  rate  for  motorized  traffic  was  assumed  to  be  4%  over  the  analysis \n4. \nperiod, based on the assumption that the average annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth \nrates  will  be  3-6%  in  2001-2006,  at  2.5-5.5%  in  2007-2015,  and  2-5%  in  2016-2020.  Overall \ngrowth  in  traffic  was  assumed  to  be  approximately  1.1  times  the  forecast  growth  in  GDP. \nNonmotorized traffic was assigned an annual growth rate of 2% throughout the plan period. The \ntraffic forecasts conservatively assumed that there would be no generated traffic. \n \nD. \n \n5. \nBased  on  the  results  of  the  road  condition  survey,  a  treatment  was  selected  for  each \nroad.  The  treatment  options  for  asphalt  roads  were  granular  overlay  and  double  bituminous \nsurface  treatment  (DBST),  or  reconstruction  with  granular  base  and  DBST.  The  options  for \ngravel roads were upgraded gravel or granular overlay and DBST. The costs were determined \nusing unit rates published by the Road Development Authority, and took into account terrain and \na \u201cprovincial factor\u201d to reflect such factors as remoteness, material haul distance, and contractor \navailability. The costs included provision for side drainage, bridge and culvert maintenance, and \nroad widening where appropriate. Standard costs were developed for roads of 3 meters (m) 4 \nm, and 4.5 m width, with initial condition of good, fair, and poor.  \n \n\nConstruction and Maintenance Costs \n\n \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 18 \n\nVehicle Operating Costs \n\nMaintenance costs were calculated using the World Bank\u2019s Highway Development and \n6. \nManagement model (HDM-4). Unit prices for treatments were SLRs250 per square meter (m2) \nfor patching, SLRs40 per m2 for crack sealing, and SLRs27, 000 per km for grading. \n \nE. \n \n7. \nHDM-4 was used to estimate VOC for traffic in each vehicle category on each selected \nroad in the with and without cases. Estimates of the value of time (VOT) for passengers on work \ntrips  were  also  prepared.  Table  A18.1  provides  an  illustration  of  the  differences  in  VOC  and \nVOT in the with and without cases for roads currently in poor condition. Improved road surface \nand increased running speeds are forecast to reduce VOC by more than one third.  \n \n\nTable A18.1: Vehicle Operating Costs and Value of Time With and Without the Project \n(SLRs per km, Economic Prices) \n\n \n \n\n \n  Item \n\nBus \n\nWith\n-out  With \n\nCar/Jeep \nWith\n-out  With \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMotorcycle/\n3-wheeler \nWith\n-out  With \n\nPickup/Light \nTruck \n\nWith-\nout  With \n \n\n \n\nTruck \n\nWith\n-out  With \n\nVan/Minibus \nWith\n-out  With \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nVehicle Operating Cost \n\nBefore improvement  18.3  18.3  12.0  12.0 \n9.3 \n3 years after \n9.4 \n8 years after \n9.5 \n13 years after \n9.6 \n18 years after \n \n\n20.7  12.1  13.4 \n20.6  12.4  13.4 \n20.7  12.6  13.4 \n20.7  13.0  13.4 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nValue of Time \n\nBefore improvement \n3 years after \n8 years after \n13 years after \n18 years after \n\n8.5 \n10.1 \n10.1 \n10.1 \n10.1 \n\n8.5 \n6.4 \n6.4 \n6.4 \n6.5 \n\n2.5 \n3.0 \n3.0 \n3.1 \n3.1 \n\n2.5 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n\n \n5% \n\n \n\n3.8 \n4.3 \n4.3 \n4.3 \n4.3 \n \n\n1.3 \n1.6 \n1.6 \n1.6 \n1.6 \n\n \n\n3.8 \n2.5 \n2.6 \n2.6 \n2.7 \n \n\n1.3 \n0.9 \n0.9 \n0.9 \n0.9 \n\n12.5 \n14.3 \n14.3 \n14.3 \n14.3 \n \n\n0.9 \n1.1 \n1.1 \n1.1 \n1.1 \n\n12.5  22.7  22.7  16.7  16.7 \n25.3  16.0  19.1  10.6 \n8.4 \n25.3  16.3  19.1  10.8 \n8.5 \n25.3  16.6  19.1  11.0 \n8.7 \n8.9 \n25.3  17.2  19.1  11.4 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.9 \n0.7 \n0.7 \n0.7 \n0.7 \n\n0.5 \n0.6 \n0.6 \n0.6 \n0.6 \n\n0.5 \n0.4 \n0.4 \n0.4 \n0.4 \n\n7.9 \n9.7 \n9.7 \n9.7 \n9.7 \n\n7.9 \n5.0 \n5.0 \n5.0 \n5.1 \n\n \n4% \n\n \n60% \n\n \n5% \n\n \n6% \n\n \n20% \n\nBenefits and Beneficiaries \n\nApproximate Share    \nof total capital \n \nF. \n \n8. \nThe quantified benefits of the project were savings in VOC and savings in VOT due to \nimprovement of road conditions. The main beneficiaries of the proposed improvements will be \nroad  users,  benefiting  from  lower  road  user  costs  and  higher  vehicle  speeds.  They  will  also \nbenefit  from  more  reliable  road  access  and  more  comfortable  journeys.  The  beneficiaries will \ninclude  vehicle  owners,  passengers,  consignors  of  freight,  consumers,  and  other  transport \nusers. Since most of the population served by provincial roads make use of road transport, the \nbenefits are likely to be spread over a large section of the community. Most vehicles operating \nin the project area do so on a commercial basis; very few are used for personal transport. The \ndistribution  of  benefits  among  beneficiaries  will  depend  largely  on  the  degree  to  which  VOC \nsavings are passed on to passengers, consignors of freight, and consumers of goods. Since the \nroad  haulage  industry  is  characterized  by  a  high  level  of  competition,  it  may  be  expected  that \nmuch of reduction in VOC will be quickly passed on to customers through lower freight rates. In \nthe  case  of  passenger  services,  until  such  time  as  the  present  controls  on  bus  fares  are \nchanged to support a more competitive market for bus services, the benefits of lower VOC will \nonly be passed on gradually to customers.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 18 \n\n63 \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\nG. \n \n9. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  proposed  provincial  road \nimprovements  was  estimated  on  the  basis  of  the  projected  streams  of  annual  costs  and \nbenefits.  The  estimated  overall  EIRR  was  26.1%.  The  estimated  EIRRs  for  the  proposed \nimprovements in each province were 23.1% for North Central, 21.1% for North Western, 17.8% \nfor  Uva,  and  36.6%  for  Western  Province.  The  majority  of  estimated  benefits  were  for  VOC \nsavings.  VOT  savings  were  relatively  small.  The  calculation  of  the  overall  EIRR  is  shown in \nTable  A18.2.  The  estimated  EIRRs  of  individual  selected  roads  were  generally  well  above  the \nEIRR threshold of 12%.

The  sensitivity \nanalysis is shown in Table A18.4. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1   The switching value shows the percentage increase in a cost variable (or decline in a benefit variable) required for \nthe net present value (NPV) to become zero, which is the same as the EIRR decreasing to the cutoff level of 12%. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 18 \n\nTable A18.3: Estimated EIRRs for Sample of Selected Roads \n \n\n \nRoad Section \n\n \nAlisthana -  Thuruwila \nAmbalammulla - Katunayake \nAnuradhapura - Arippu  \nBadagamuwa - Wellawa  \nBalaharuwa  - Hambegamuwa  \nBathalagoda - Pangolla  \nDachchadamana - Puhudivulwewa \nDambagalla - Mariarawa  \nDiulwewa - Galadenigama  \nDodangoda -  Thebuwana \nGanewatta - Nagollagama  \nHendiyapola - Deduruoya   \nHokandara - Kottawa \nHomagama -  Talagala \nKerawalapitiya - Mahabage \nKothalawala   \nKudaoya - Balaharuwa  \nMailagastenna-Thoranakapolla-Kottagoda \nMalwana  - Samanabedde \nMapakada - Keselpotha  \n \n\n \nRoad Section \n\n \nEIRR (%) \n \n \n29.0 \nMedirigiriya - Chaittya   \n26.0  Meegoda - Gehenuwala - Artigala \n42.0  Melsiripura - Rambe   \n33.3  Munagama - Millewa \n34.4  Muppana - Medgama \n19.9  Nawagmuwa - Koratota \n12.3  Nawinna - Rajamahawihara  \n19.0  Oruwela - Mullegama \n37.3  Palliyawatte -  Dikkowita \n22.8  Pelanwatta - Kosgahahena \n25.5  Raigama  - Anguruwatot a \n54.7  Seepukulama-Galenbindunuwewa \n78.0  Thalawa  - Siyambalangamuwa  \n\n127.5  Thotawathta  - Ambalanduwa \n\n75.1  Thumbowila - Wewala \n36.2  Udahamulla -  Thalapathpitiya \n22.4  Urulemulla -  Thalawatta \n45.1  Welikemulla-Medagama-Wevelhinna \n44.8  Yakalla - Mukalanyaya  \n25.3  Yangalmodera - Morawalapitiya  \n\nTable A18.4: EIRR Sensitivity Analysis \n\n20% Increase in Project Costs \n\n20% Reduction in Benefits \n\n20% Increase in Project Costs and 20% Reduction in Project Benefits \n \n\n \nEIRR (%) \n \n85.2 \n37.1 \n25.9 \n28.0 \n40.3 \n59.0 \n59.2 \n29.5 \n59.7 \n45.7 \n30.6 \n28.6 \n20.5 \n91.2 \n78.1 \n150.2 \n13.0 \n15.8 \n17.8 \n22.7 \n\nEIRR (%) \n\n26.1 \n\n24.0 \n\n20.3 \n\n18.3 \n\n22.4 \n\n21.6 \n\n18.2 \n\n \n \nScenario \n\nBase case \n\n1 year delay \n\n2 year delay \n\n3 year delay \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 November 2002) \n", "Currency Unit  \nSLRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Sri Lanka rupee/s (SLRe/SLRs) \n$0.0104 \nSLRs96.30 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nconsolidated fund \nexecuting agency \nfiscal year \nimprest account \nInstitute of Construction Training and Development \ninstitutional development program \ninitial environmental examination \nkilometer \nland acquisition and resettlement \nlocal competitive bidding \nMinistry of Highways \nMinistry of Transport, Highways and Civil Aviation \nMinistry of Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government \nnational highway \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \nproject implementation unit \nproject coordination unit \nprovincial road \nprovincial road administration \nprovincial road improvement \nproject steering committee \nRoad Construction and Development Company \nRoad Development Authority \nre-engineering action plan \nreform implementation unit \nreform program steering committee \nstatement of expenditures \ntechnical assistance \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n", " \nADB \n \nCF \n \nEA \n \nFY \nIA \n \nICTAD  \n \nIDP \n \nIEE \n \nkm \n \nLAR \nLCB \n \n \nMOH \nMTHCA \nMHAPCLG \nNH \n \nOPEC   \n \nPIU \n \nPCU \n \nPR \n \nPRA \n \nPRI \nPSC \n \nRCDC   \n \nRDA \nREAP   \nRIU \n \nRPSC   \n \nSOE \nTA \n \n \n", " \n", " \n(i) \n(ii) \n", "NOTES \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n", " \nThis Report was prepared by a team consisting of S.
