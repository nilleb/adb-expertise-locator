This will be \nachieved through a series of interventions over the period 2002-2008. The \nproposed Project will be the first in the series of interventions, supporting \nthe  first  stage  of  the  reform  program  and  financing  improvement  of \nprovincial  roads.  Technical  assistance  (TA)  will  also  be  provided  to \nprepare the second intervention in the sector. \n \nRationale  Efficient transport contributes to the expansion of economic opportunities \nand the reduction of poverty. The overall contribution of road infrastructure \nrequires  institutional  arrangements  and  capacity  that  support  strategic \nmanagement of the sector, planning and management of investments and \nmaintenance, and competitive provision of civil works and of engineering \nand related services. Sustained institutional reforms are needed to enable \nthe Road Development Authority (RDA) and provincial councils to perform \ntheir strategic, planning, and management roles, and to establish a strong, \ncompetitive private sector. A further determinant of transport efficiency is \nthe performance of transport services that make use of road infrastructure. \nThere is a need to improve the regulatory framework for bus services to \nrealize the potential contribution of the private sector while safeguarding \nthe  interests  of  passengers.  There  is  also  a  need  for  investment  in \nimprovement of the road network, both to expand capacity in response to \nrising traffic on the national highway network and to address poor road \nconditions on parts of the provincial road network. \n \nObjectives and  The overall objective of the Project is to advance policy and institutional \nScope  reforms to create an enabling environment for the efficient and sustainable \ndevelopment of the road sector with substantial participation of the private \nsector. The medium-term policy framework developed and agreed upon \nwith the Government will serve as a roadmap for future lending to Sri \nLanka\u2019s road sector. \n \nThe proposed Project and its attached TAs are designed to achieve two \nspecific  objectives:  The  first  is  to  improve  transport  efficiency  by  (i) \nstrengthening the performance of the road sector institutions responsible \nfor  the  national  and  provincial  road  networks,  (ii)  improving  road \nmaintenance and road maintenance funding, (iii) developing streamlined ", "ii   \nmaintenance and road maintenance funding, (iii) developing streamlined \nregulatory and other arrangements for buses and other transport services \nusing roads, and  (iv) upgrading and increasing the capacity of priority \nroads. The second objective is to increase private sector participation in \nthe road sector by (i) increased outsourcing of road works and engineering \nservices,  and  (ii)  exploring  opportunities  for  private  operation  of  bus \nservices. \n \nThe reform program components will establish the transfer of national \nroad provision to the private sector in stages; strengthen the capacity of \nRDA  to  perform  its  role  of  planning,  managing,  and  maintaining  the \nnational road asset base; and establish basic road provision capacity in \nfour provincial councils. The investment components will improve about \n980 kilometers (km) of provincial roads in North Central, North Western, \nUva, and Western provinces.  \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $92.5 million equivalent. The \nforeign exchange cost is $32.8 million, and $59.7 million equivalent is the \nlocal currency cost.  \nFinancing Plan  ($million) \n     \nForeign  Local \nSource  Total Cost  Percent \nExchange  Currency \nADB  24.3  32.2  56.5  61.1 \nOPEC Fund  8.5  0.0  8.5  9.2 \nGovernment  0.0  27.5  27.5  29.7 \n     Total  32.8  59.7  92.5  100.0 \n \nLoan Amount and  The equivalent in various currencies of special drawing rights 42.75 million \nTerms  ($56.5 million equivalent) from the Special Funds resources of ADB. The \n  repayment period of the proposed ADB loan will be 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1% during the grace \nperiod,  and  1.5%  thereafter.  The  OPEC  Fund  for  International \nDevelopment has agreed to cofinance the proposed ADB loan with an \n$8.5 million equivalent loan to be administered by ADB. \n \nPeriod of  Until 30 June 2008  \nUtilization  \nEstimated Project  31 December 2007 \nCompletion Date \nExecuting  Ministry of Transport, Highways and Civil Aviation (MTHCA) and Ministry \nAgencies  of Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government (MHAPCLG). \n \nImplementation  The project steering committee, chaired by the Secretary of MHAPCLG, \nArrangements  will oversee the overall implementation of the Project. The reform program \nsteering committee, chaired by the Secretary of MTHCA, will oversee \nimplementation  of  the  reform  program.  The  reforms  of  national  road \nprovision will be implemented by Ministry of Highways and RDA. The ", "  iii \nprovision will be implemented by Ministry of Highways and RDA. The \nreforms of provincial road provision and the provincial roads improvement \nwill  be  executed  by  the  project  coordination  unit  of  MHAPCLG  and \nimplemented by provincial-level project implementing units.  \n \nProcurement  All civil works contract packages will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  following local competitive bidding \nprocedures. \n \nConsulting  International and domestic consultants will be required to support the \nServices  reform  program,  for  construction  supervision  for  the  provincial  roads \nimprovement,  and  for  detailed  design  of  the  national  highways \ndevelopment. The consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and arrangements satisfactory to \nADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. \n \nProject Benefits   The  Project  will  improve  the  overall  performance  of  the  road  sector, \nand Beneficiaries  contributing  to  transport  efficiency.  This  will  improve  the  returns  and \nsustainability  of  existing  and  future  investments  in  the  sector,  and \ncontribute to growth of a wide range of other economic activities that make \nuse of road transport services. Improved access to economic opportunities \nand services will contribute to poverty reduction. The beneficiaries of the \nProject will be people, companies, and government and nongovernment \nagencies throughout the country that make use of road transport services \ndirectly or indirectly.  \n \nThe main quantifiable benefits of the provincial roads improvement will \nconsist of savings in transport operating costs. The beneficiaries will be (i) \ncommunities  in  the  project  areas,  (ii)  transport  operators,  and  (iii) \ncompanies and employees that operate in or serve these communities. \nThe proportion of poor among the project beneficiaries is 38%, higher than \ntheir proportion in the overall population of the country (30%). Access to \nimproved bus and road freight services will help to reduce poverty by \nenabling growth in poor peoples\u2019 incomes and employment, reducing the \ncost of transport services, supporting improved school attendance, and \nimproving access to social services. The overall economic internal rate of \nreturn is 26.1%.  The poverty impact ratios of representative roads for \nUva, North Western, and North Central provinces are estimated to be \nmore than 0.5, well above the poor's share of national income. \n \nRisks and  The  major  risks  for  the  project  are  (i)  that  the  reform  will  not  be \nAssumptions  implemented in full, leading to improvements in sector performance less \nthan intended; (ii) inadequate post project road maintenance; and (iii) \nlimited experience and capacity of contractors. These have been mitigated \nin the design of the project in accordance with the agreed upon medium-\nterm  program,  with  milestones  that  have  to  be  met  for  future  ADB \ninvolvement in the sector. The reform program will improve planning, \nexecution, and financing of road maintenance. Sufficient provision has \nbeen  made  for  the  project  implementation  consultant  to  supervise \ncontractors and provide assistance and training to build up their skills and \ncapacity. ", "iv   \n  \nTechnical  In conjunction with the Project, two TAs are proposed for (i) conducting a \nAssistance  feasibility study of national highways development, and (ii) developing a \nreform  and  investment  program  for  passenger  transport  services \nimprovement. The estimated total cost of the TAs is $1,680,000, of which \nADB will finance $1,350,000 on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund \nfunded by the Government of Japan. The TA consultants will be recruited \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Road Sector Development Project \n(the Project),1 and (ii) proposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a loan \nto be provided by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Fund for International \nDevelopment (OPEC Fund) for the Project. The report also describes two proposed technical \nassistance (TA) grants for national highways (NHs) development and for passenger transport \nservices  improvement,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TAs. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Sri Lanka has a road network of about 83,690 kilometers (km), comprising about 11,460 \nkm of NHs (Classes A and B), 13,880 km of provincial roads (PRs, Classes C, D, and E),2 and \n58,350 km of local authority roads. Road transport accounts for about 92% of passenger and \nfreight land transport. Vehicle ownership and road traffic have grown rapidly. The total number \nof registered vehicles was about 1.4 million in 1997, increasing at 6% per annum. Of the total of \n67 billion passenger-km of travel in 2000, 33.6 billion were on private buses, 19.7 billion on \npublic buses, 3.2 billion on railways, and 10.5 billion on private vehicles.  \n \n3.  While the road network is extensive, most roads were built more than 50 years ago. \nRoad maintenance, rehabilitation, and new construction have not kept abreast of the rapid \ngrowth in demand for transport. Traffic levels now exceed the design capacity of many roads. \nDue to neglect of road maintenance, road conditions are often poor. Uncontrolled roadside \ndevelopment has also reduced the capacity of the network. This has negative consequences for \nroad user costs, road safety, and the quality and frequency of transport services, and limits the \ncontribution of roads to national development, economic growth, and poverty reduction.  \n \n4.  The public sector retains most of the responsibilities for the provision of NHs. This \nincludes not only planning and managing the road network, but also designing and supervising \nthe road works. The role of the domestic private sector  in road contracting and engineering \nservices is underdeveloped compared with other ADB developing member countries. \n \n5.  The  Ministry  of  Transport,  Highways  and  Civil  Aviation  (MTHCA)  has  overall \nresponsibility for policies and programs concerning national transport. The Ministry of Highways \n(MOH) has overall responsibility for programs and projects for NHs. The Road Development \nAuthority (RDA),3 a statutory institution assigned to MOH, is responsible for planning and \nmanaging the development of NHs, and for maintenance. Although having the structure of a \ncommercial  organization,  with  a  chairman,  general  manager,  and  a  board  of  directors,  in \npractice  RDA  operates  as  a  government  department  under  MOH,  with  relatively  limited \nautonomy. Most of RDA\u2019s engineering, construction and maintenance works is carried out by \nthe Road Construction and Development Company (RCDC), owned by RDA, on the basis of \nwork orders with remuneration based on highways schedule of rates plus overhead markups.  \n                                                 \n1  The Project framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n2  Class A roads are mainly NHs connecting different provinces. Class B roads are mainly NHs within a province. \nClass C roads are mainly surfaced PRs connecting towns and villages. Class D roads are mainly other surfaced \nPRs. Class E roads are mainly unsurfaced or gravel PRs. \n3  Established by the Road Development Authority Act, No. 73 of 1981. ", "2   \n6.  Following the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, 1989, responsibility for PRs was \ndevolved from RDA to the Ministry of Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government \n(MHAPCLG). However, provincial councils were not given guidance on appropriate institutional \narrangements for carrying out road responsibilities. Several different structures were adopted for \nprovincial  road  administrations  (PRAs),  including  assigning  responsibility  to  provincial \nengineering or public works departments, creating a separate highway department under the \ncouncil, and establishing a separate provincial road development authority. There is a lack of \nprofessional and technical expertise, particularly in planning, programming, design, contract \nadministration, and quality control. The performance of road responsibilities at the provincial \nlevel has therefore remained weak, and the condition of the PR network has deteriorated. \n \n7.  In 1999, a survey of PRs conducted in North Central, North Western, Uva, and Western \nprovinces found that the network was generally in poor condition, with a wide range of width and \ngeometric standards. Potholes and breakup of bitumen surfacing were the most common form \nof deterioration, and in most cases reconstruction or overlay was needed. It was evident that \nrelatively little rehabilitation and periodic maintenance had been carried out in the previous 10 \nyears. The survey found that (i) 11% of the network was in good or very good condition and \nwould not need rehabilitation for some years; (ii) 15% was in fair condition and likely to need \nresurfacing  within  the  next  5  years;  (iii)  54%  was  in  poor  condition  and  needed  major \nrehabilitation  to  return  the  roads  to  a  maintainable  condition  and  provide  all-weather \nserviceability; and (iv) 20% was in very poor condition, requiring reconstruction.  \n \n8.  Freight services in Sri Lanka are operated by the private sector and are not controlled. \nThere are associations and cooperatives that represent freight operators. The freight haulage \nmarket is highly competitive. Haulage rates vary for different commodities. The rates on roads in \npoor condition are about 20% higher than on roads in good condition. \n \n9.  Passenger bus services are the leading form of public transport in Sri Lanka and perform \nan important role in providing transport for poor people and those living in remote areas, and in \nenabling them to have access to economic opportunities and services. In 2000, there were \n16,167  licensed  private  buses  and  5,894  public  buses.  Private  services  met  63%  of  the \npassenger-km and public services met 37%. The standard of bus services is generally low, with \nproblems in terms of service coverage, quality of service, safety, and reliability.  \n \n10.  There have been numerous changes in responsibilities for bus services. Bus services \nwere operated by the private companies, which were nationalized and consolidated into a single \npublic company, the Ceylon Transport Board, in 1958. In 1978, this was dissolved and its \nfunctions  were  divided  among  nine  regional  transport  boards  and  the  Sri  Lanka  Central \nTransport Board. In 1979, to supplement the services, private bus services were reintroduced \nand route associations were established, which were disbanded by the late 1980s. In 1991, a \nNational Transport Commission was established to formulate policy and disburse subsidies. \nProvincial transport commissions were also established to regulate intraprovincial services. In \nthe  early  1990s,  the  regional  transport  boards  were  transformed  into  93  peoplized  bus \ncompanies, under which the Government provided employees with 50% shares of the mobile \nassets. These were reconsolidated into 11 regional transport companies in 1997.  \n \n11.  Neither private nor public bus services have achieved efficiency and good service for a \nsustained  period.  Changes  in  policy  and  institutional  arrangements  sometimes  led  to  a \ntemporary improvement in service, but was generally followed by declining service performance, \nnecessitating  further  change.  Nationalization,  route  associations,  and  the  establishment  of \ntransport commissions, as well as resumption of private services and successive restructurings ", "     3 \nof public services, were responses to deteriorating service coverage, frequency, comfort, and \nsafety, and growing operating deficits, linked to inefficiency and poor management. \n \n12.  The road accident fatality rate was about 18 per 10,000 vehicles, compared with less \nthan 10 per 10,000 vehicles in some industrialized countries in Asia, and 1-2 per 10,000 \nvehicles in industrialized countries. In 1998, there were 2,000 fatalities, of whom 42% were \npedestrians. Efforts to improve road safety are still at an early stage. The National Road Safety \nSecretariat was established in 1997 to implement the road safety action plan developed under \nADB projects.4 In 1998, the Road Safety Council was established under the Motor Traffic Act to \nguide national policies and actions on road safety.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities5 \n \n  1.  National Highways Provision \n \n13.  The existing institutional arrangements have led to problems of inefficiency, lack of \ncapacity, and inadequate maintenance. A series of interconnected weaknesses in RDA includes \n(i) lack of capacity to systematically plan, program, and prioritize road development options; (ii) \nlack of preconstruction processes needed for advance preparation and planning of complex \nprojects; (iii) lack of experience in use of employer-contractor contracts needed for effective \nmanagement and control of civil works construction; (iv) lack of systems for road maintenance \nmanagement, including planning, budgeting, programming, and controlling; (v) absence of a \ntechnical audit function; and (vi) inadequate level of road maintenance funding.  \n \n14.  An underlying cause of many of these problems was RDA\u2019s reliance on RCDC. The \nautomatic use of RCDC to execute most domestically funded road works meant there was no \npipeline of domestic work to support the development of domestic private sector capacity in \nroad contracting and engineering services. As RCDC performed both design and construction, \nand contracts were not used, there was little incentive for RDA to improve its competence and \ncapacity  in  highway  planning,  management,  and  engineering.  Additionally,  since  much  of \nRCDC\u2019s capacity was taken up with minor works for RDA that were better suited to small-scale \ncontractors, and it was not afforded the full autonomy of a private company, RCDC was unable \nto realize its potential for undertaking larger scale, equipment-intensive operations.  \n \n15.  Weaknesses in the approach to funding provision of roads have meant that road assets \nare  not  adequately  maintained  and  there  has  not  been  enough  investment  in  capacity \nexpansion. Although road user charges generate substantial government revenues, more than \nhalf of these are spent outside the road sector. The amount assigned to road maintenance is \nmuch too low compared with levels generally recommended for other developing countries. \nRoads do not receive maintenance when needed. Many deteriorate to the extent that they can \nbe restored to good condition only by undertaking major rehabilitation works at much greater \ncost. An ADB-funded TA6 is to improve the maintenance budgeting and expenditure control \nsystem, with a view to determining the full extent of funding shortfalls.  \n \n16.  Economic growth has led to increased demand for travel over longer distances, causing \nrising congestion on NHs. To address this problem, and to realize the potential for express \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1994. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Sri \nLanka (RRP) for the Third Road Improvement Project. Manila; and ADB. 1999. RRP for the Southern Transport \nDevelopment Project. Manila \n5  Problems analyses are presented in Appendix 2. \n6  ADB. 2001. TA to Sri Lanka for Road Maintenance Budgeting and Expenditure Control. Manila ", "4   \nhighways to accelerate economic growth, the Government is planning a major program of \ninvestment in capacity expansion over the next 10-15 years. This includes construction of the \nADB-financed Colombo-Matara highway, Colombo-Katunayake Expressway, Colombo Outer \nCircular Road, Colombo-Kandy highway, and Katunayake-Padeniya-Anuradhapura highway. \nThis program will require a doubling or trebling of domestic road provision capacity, and will \ngreatly increase the road asset base to be sustained through maintenance. To carry out this \nprogram, the existing problems of inefficiency, lack of capacity, and inadequate maintenance \nneed to be overcome through implementation of institutional and policy reform.  \n \n  2.  Provincial Roads \n \n17.  Since the PR networks are already extensive, the main role of PRAs is to maintain the \nexisting road asset base. However, PRAs have few of the planning and other skills needed to \nperform this role effectively and efficiently. None of the PRAs keep inventories of road condition, \nand none have objective systems for selecting periodic and routine maintenance. Their capacity \nis mainly confined to performing public works, on a fairly small scale, often using direct labor. \nThey also lack expertise and experience in use of the private sector for execution of civil works \nand engineering and technical services, and there is lack of coordination among the PRAs. \n \n18.  The annual budgets for provincial roads are funded mainly from central government \nallocations, supplemented by revenues raised by provincial councils. The existing level of \nfunding is insufficient for councils to adequately maintain their road networks. There is a need to \nincrease  the  level  of  road  budgets,  and  assign  more  to  road  maintenance.  Since  the \nGovernment\u2019s capacity for increasing provincial roads budget may be limited, PRAs may also \nneed to develop a range of levels of service on different roads in their networks, with a view to \nmaking best use of scarce budget resources. \n \n19.  Under  the  ongoing  ADB-funded  project,7  the  Southern  Provincial  Council  is \nimplementing an institutional development program (IDP) to (i) establish capacity for efficient \nand effective management of the road network; and (ii) develop the institutional, financial, and \nprivate sector contracting resources needed for sustainable road maintenance. This has been \nimplemented with a view to being used as a model for replication in other provinces, and \nprovided the basis for the IDP developed under the ADB-funded TA8 for North Central, North \nWestern, Western, and Uva provinces, and under the United Nations Development Programme-\nfunded Mid-Country Rural Roads Network Feasibility Study for Central and Sabaragamuwa \nprovinces.  \n3.  Transport Services \n20.  The performance of the bus transport services has been influenced by the inability to \nestablish and implement a sound policy and regulatory framework for both public and private \noperators. The Government has controlled fares and service parameters have limited the scope \nfor increased efficiency. Fare increases have been infrequent, and have not kept pace with \ninflation.9 This has deterred investment and discouraged larger professional firms from entering \nthe industry, leaving the majority of services in the hands of small-scale, owner-operators who \nlack management expertise and capital. The fare structure has led to overcrowding on more \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1997. RRP for the Southern Provincial Roads Improvement. Manila \n8  ADB. 1997.

Regulatory enforcement has been hampered by \nlack of capacity and by problems of corruption in the issuance of route permits and monitoring. \n \n21.  Public bus services have become a substantial financial burden. The annual operating \nlosses of the regional companies rose from SLRs1.1 billion ($18 million equivalent) in 1997 to \nSLRs1.7 billion ($25 million equivalent) in 1999. To improve the efficiency of the state-owned \nbus companies, reduce its financial burden, and attract management expertise, the Government \nhas recently initiated a public-private partnerships program. Proposals have been invited from \nprivate firms take over 39% of the equity of these companies together with management control. \nThe first sale of equity interest in six public bus companies was completed in late October 2002. \nDespite these efforts, an overall strategy for the efficient, equitable, and sustainable delivery of \npassenger transport services by both private and public operators needs to be developed. \nMTHCA therefore wishes to elaborate a program of transport service reforms, including (i) \nstrengthen policy to realize the potential contribution of the private operators and to limit the \nneed for public services, (ii) review mechanisms for meeting minimum service obligations, (iii) \ndevelop a staged program for implementation of the revised policy, (iv) establish regulatory \ncompetencies through institutional strengthening and capacity building, and (v) restructure the \ncentral transport board to reduce operating losses. \n \n22.  MTHCA has identified further dimensions of passenger transport services requiring \nimprovement. Bus terminals in towns are poorly managed and as a result are often congested \nand inefficient. Most roads were designed without making provision for bus stops, with the result \nthat stopping buses interfere with traffic flows and create road safety hazards. There may also \nbe scope for encouraging a wider range of passenger service alternatives, from premium quality \nservices to basic or informal services, and improvement of passenger service connections, \nincluding transfers between bus services and intermodal connections. Some bus terminals have \nbeen upgraded, 10 and motor vehicle registration and inspections systems are being upgraded \nunder the ADB-funded Southern Transport Development Project (STDP). \n  \n4.  Government Sector Objectives and Plans \n23.  The Government\u2019s Framework for Poverty Reduction11 establishes a strategy for poverty \nreduction:  (i)  creating  opportunities  for  the  poor  to  participate  in  economic  growth,  (ii) \nstrengthening the social protection system, and (iii) empowering the poor and strengthening \ngovernance. One of the main challenges for creating opportunities for the poor will be to \neffectively link poor regions to rapidly growing domestic and international markets. Building up \nthe NH system and an integrated  road network, and enhancing the performance of the bus \nsystem have been identified as priority transport and communications initiatives. There is also a \nneed for institutional and policy reform to improve the performance of the road sector, including \nincreasing private sector participation and improving road maintenance. \n \n5.  External Assistance and ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n24.  Since 1980, ADB has provided eight loans totaling $351 million for the road sector, the \nmost recent being for the STDP in 1999. The principal bilateral sources of external assistance \nhave been Japan, Republic of Korea, Sweden, and Kuwait. The United Nations Development \nProgramme is the largest multilateral grant provider. Among the multilaterals, ADB is the largest \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1992. RRP for the Urban Development Sector. Manila; and ADB. 1998.

", "6   \nprovider and has coordinated its support with other external agencies to ensure efficiency in \nroad development. External assistance to the road sector is in Appendix 3. \n \n25.  ADB's country strategy for Sri Lanka focuses on contributing to sustainable poverty \nreduction.  Under  the  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement  (2002)  between  the \nGovernment and ADB, high priority is accorded to broad-based rural development. The strategy \nis to support growth in productive employment opportunities and rural incomes through faster \nand  broad-based  economic  growth.  At  the  High  Level  Forum  on  23  March  2001,  the \nGovernment and ADB concluded that ADB support for the road sector is important for poverty \nreduction. Improved sector performance will facilitate economic growth, raising incomes and \ncreating employment, and thereby reducing poverty. Strategic investments are also needed to \nlink less developed regions to markets and service centers. ADB\u2019s sector strategy is to bring \nabout overall improvements in sector performance by supporting institutional and policy reforms, \nstrengthening private sector participation, and financing strategic investments in the network. \nADB has for some years been the lead donor in the road sector, and will continue in this role. \n \n6.  Lessons Learned \n26.  ADB-assisted roads projects in Sri Lanka have experienced implementation delays. \nThese have been due mainly to (i) cumbersome Government procurement procedures, affecting \nprojects in all sectors; (ii) lack of institutional capacity in RDA for preconstruction processes and \nconstruction supervision, including land acquisition and resettlement; and (iii) lack of capacity \nand inexperience of the domestic private sector in road construction and engineering and \nrelated services.  \n \n27.  In 2000, as a result of ADB-financed TA,12 the Government simplified its procurement \nprocedures for externally funded projects, introduced a system of monitoring procurement \nperformance, and established the Procurement Support Bureau in the Ministry of Finance, \nwhich is reducing the time for procurement and is increasing transparency.  \n \n28.  During the 1990s, ADB helped the Government to start the process of opening up road \nprovision to the private sector, including through use of local competitive bidding (LCB) in ADB-\nfinanced projects, training and capacity building to support private contractors, and studies to \naddress  key  constraints  to  private  sector  participation.  As  result  some  domestic  building \ncontractors have successfully ventured into road construction.13 However, for private sector \nparticipation to be sustained, and to enable further consolidation and development of the \nindustry, a pipeline of road construction work is needed, which depends on RDA assigning more \nof its annual consolidated fund (CF)-financed road works to be executed by contractors.  \n \n29.  Land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) weaknesses can lead to project implementation \nproblems and delays, as experienced under previous loans. These have been improved under \nthe latest approved project, however, the process is still need to be further streamlined. \n \n30.  Inadequate postproject maintenance experienced in the early ADB endeavors is being \naddressed under current ADB projects. However, the Government has difficulties in complying \nwith covenants related to broader budget allocation for road maintenance. There is a need to \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 1997. TA to Sri Lanka for the Establishment of Sri Lanka Tender Support Bureau. Manila \n13  In 1994, RCDC initiated training and developing domestic private contractors by engaging 13 contractors on a \nsubcontract basis to perform a large road project in Colombo, but had to be discontinued in 1995 because changes \nin Government\u2019s general procurement regulations prevented RCDC from continuing to engage subcontractors. ", "     7 \naddress the broader lack of maintenance issue for the overall sector through a reform program \nto improve the planning, execution, and financing of road maintenance. \n \n31.  An overall lesson from past experience in the road sector is that institutional reform \ninitiatives need to be addressed in a comprehensive but gradual manner, and to be sustained if \nthey are to produce lasting improvements. This is difficult to achieve through a single project. \nThe programmatic approach therefore brings together ADB\u2019s next interventions for the road \nsector, creating the opportunity to link financing of successive projects to implementation of a \ncommon medium-term reform agenda.  \n \n7.  Medium-Term Sector Framework Approach \n32.  In 2000, ADB revised its operational strategy for the road sector in Sri Lanka, and with \nthe  Government  decided  to  focus  on  improving  overall  sector  performance  through \nimplementation of institutional and sector reform. ADB-financed TA14 had identified inefficiency \nin the sector and inadequate maintenance, which were linked to lack of capacity, lack of \ncompetition, and outmoded business processes. Through subsequent policy dialogues, the \nGovernment asked ADB for assistance in implementing sector reforms using a medium-term \nsector approach,15 with processing of loans linked to successive accomplishment of milestones \nin the reform program. This approach is supported by other external agencies assisting the road \nsector,  notably  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  and  the  Swedish \nInternational Development Cooperation Agency.  \n \n33.  The TA (footnote 14) was used to initiate extensive policy dialogue with the main road \nsector stakeholders. The Government and ADB identified the need to augment the consultation \nprocess for the TA. An ownership team and 10 consultative teams were established involving a \nbroad cross-section of stakeholders in the reengineering process, including MTHCA, MOH, \nRDA, RCDC, MHAPCLG, provincial councils, private contractors, consulting firms, and others. \n \n34.  A high-level seminar on road sector development established an initial consensus on \nobjectives, scope, and the overall focus of the reform program.16 Subsequently, the scope and \nsequencing of the medium-term program of sector reforms was agreed upon. The medium-term \nprogram consists of (i) reengineering central government road sector institutions and building up \nprivate  sector  participation,  (ii)  strengthening  the  road  function  of  provincial  councils,  (iii) \nimproving  passenger  transport  services,  (iv)  support  for  priority  investments  in  road \nimprovement, and (v) road safety improvement. The road sector policy matrix is in Appendix 4. \n \n35.  The reform program will build upon past ADB support for reform in the road sector, \ndevelop additional reforms, and provide sustained support to bring to a conclusion each of the \nmain reform activities. The extended time frame and the approach of implementing reforms \ngradually in stages reflect the need for (i) an inclusive, nationallyowned process of change, (ii) \ncapacity to be built up to support new institutional arrangements, and (iii) the Government to \nretain capacity to continue to meet its responsibilities throughout implementation of the program. \nAdequate progress of the sector framework is required for processing future projects. \n \n36.   The medium-term framework for road sector lending is summarized in Appendix 5. The \nplan tentatively envisages that ADB will provide three project loans and several TAs. Each \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 1998. TA to Sri Lanka for the Re-engineering of Road Sector Institutions.

As the first project, the \nproposed Project will commence the transfer of provision of national roads to the private sector \nin stages; strengthen the capacity of RDA to perform its role of planning, managing, and \nmaintaining the national road asset base; and establish basic road provision capacity in four \nprovincial councils. The investment component will finance improvement of PRs. Two attached \nTAs will be used to prepare feasibility studies for NH development and provide support to the \nGovernment\u2019s objectives to improve passenger transport services. \n \n37.  The possible second project, intended for 2004, may support further reform of road \nprovision and road maintenance funding, and implement reform milestones of transport services \nand other aspects of that provision of passenger transport services. Its investment component \nmay finance improvement of NHs, transport services, and road safety. The possible third \nproject,  intended  for  2006,  may  complete  the  reform  of  road  provision.  Its  investment \ncomponent may finance road network development and road safety improvement. \n \n38.  Implementation of the sector framework is intended to have the following outcomes (i) \nRDA  will  have  strong  core  competencies  in  the  engineering,  strategic  planning,  and \nmanagement of the NH network; (ii) a strong domestic private sector capacity in road provision \nwill  have  been  established,  and  most  of  RDA\u2019s  domestically  financed  road  works  and \nengineering  services  will  be  carried  out  by  the  domestic  private  sector  on  the  basis  of \ncompetition; (iii) the role of RCDC in road provision will have been reduced substantially; (iv) the \ncapacity of PRAs in Uva, North Western, North Central, and Western provinces will have been \nimproved; (v) RDA and the PRAs will have established objective systems for selecting road \nmaintenance work on the basis of economic returns, and capacity for operating these systems \nused for annual programming; (vi) RDA and the PRAs will have sufficient maintenance budgets \nto ensure that roads are adequately maintained on a sustainable basis; (vii) the efficiency of \ntransport services will have improved; and (viii) road safety will have improved. \n \n39.  The Government has demonstrated its commitment to the reform program by performing \na  number  of  actions:  (i)  Cabinet  approved  plans  for  increasing  domestic  private  sector \nparticipation in road works and decreasing the role of RCDC; (ii) contracting out packages of a \ncombined value of SLRs1 billion; (iii) training and piloting the improved road maintenance \nbudgeting and expenditure control; (iv) establishment of a Public-Private Partnership Task \nForce to provide a forum for regular client-contractor dialogue, a Reform Implementation Unit in \nRDA, and a dedicated road agency in each project province.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n40.  The main objective is to improve transport efficiency, contributing to the expansion of \neconomic opportunities and the reduction of poverty by (i) strengthening national and provincial \nroads institutions to perform their core role of strategic management and planning of the road \nnetwork;  (ii)  developing  strong,  competitive  domestic  capacity  for  road  construction  and \nengineering services; (iii) planning, executing, and financing road maintenance on a sustainable \nbasis; and (iv) upgrading and increasing the capacity of priority roads. The Project will also (i) \nincrease  private  sector  participation  in  the  road  sector  by  outsourcing  construction  and \nmaintenance works and engineering services, and exploring opportunities for private operation \nof bus services; and (ii) improve the governance of the road sector by increasing transparency.  \n ", "     9 \nB.  Components and Outputs \n1.  Reform Program \na.  Reform of National Highways Provision \n41.  Two sets of reforms are needed to improve the performance of NH provision: (i) transfer \nmost road construction and engineering activities to be carried out by the domestic private \nsector on the basis of competition, with a commensurate decrease in the role of RCDC;17 and \n(ii) strengthen the performance and capacity of public sector institutions, notably RDA, through \nimplementation of the agreed upon reengineering action plan (REAPs). These reforms are \ninterdependent and will be implemented in parallel. A summary of the REAPs is in Appendix 6.  \n \n42.  Private Sector Participation. The arrangements are in Appendix 7. RDA will increase \nthe proportion of domestic financing under CF civil works and engineering for road construction \nand  maintenance  works  contracted  out  to  the  domestic  private  sector.  There  will  be  a \ncommensurate reduction in work performed by RCDC. Since RCDC presently accounts for the \nmajority of domestic capacity and existing private sector capacity is limited, responsibilities will \nbe transferred in stages. For civil works over SLRs2.5 million per contract, which constitute the \nmajority of RDA expenditure on works, RDA will contract out SLRs1 billion in 2002, SLRs1.5 \nbillion in 2003, SLRs2 billion in 2004, 50% in 2006, and 75% in 2008.  \n \n43.  RCDC will have an important role to play in reform implementation during the first 3-year \ntransitional period to build up private sector capacity and mitigate the possible risks of contractor \nfailure through subcontracting arrangements, on-the-job supervision, and training; supplement \ntheir  equipment  and  other  inputs;  and  guarantee  the  performance  of  the  works  to  RDA. \nThereafter, all contractors will be engaged directly by RDA on the basis of competitive bidding. \nBy that time RDA will establish a strong contract management system. \n \n44.  RDA will consolidate CF expenditures on small works into larger and more efficient \npackages. For the duration of the reform program, the annual total expenditure (in nominal \nterms) on packages under SLRs2.5 million will not be increased beyond the 2000 level.  \n \n45.  REAPs for development of the private sector and RCDC include (i) developing options to \novercome plant availability constraints; (ii) establishment of an Aggregate Supply Information \nUnit  in  RDA;  (iii)  contractor  training  through  the  Institute  of  Construction  Training  and \nDevelopment,  and  (iv)  support  for  RCDC  and  RDA  staff  to  set  up  independent,  private \nconsulting  engineering  firms  capable  of  preparing  feasibility  studies,  detailed  design, and \nbidding  documents;  and  assisting  in  the  procurement  process,  contract  management, \nconstruction  supervision,  and  TA  to  the  private  contractors.  Initially,  three  teams  will  be \nestablished: the design team, supervision team, and TA team. \n \n46.  Reengineering  RDA.  REAPs  for  reengineering  RDA  include  (i)  strengthening  of \nplanning and programming, (ii) strengthening of preconstruction processes, (iii) strengthening of \nconstruction  management,  (iv)  strengthening  of  road  maintenance  management,  (v) \nestablishment of technical audit, (vi) road maintenance funding; and (vii) improving the LAR \nprocess.  These  will  focus  on  progressively  reforming  RDA\u2019s  business  processes  and \nstrengthening its capacity to enable it to effectively and efficiently manage the NH system.  \n                                                 \n17 As Sri Lanka\u2019s highway network will be significantly expanded in the coming years (para. 16), there will be enough \ndemand to absorb the existing labor force in the road industry.  ", "10   \n47.  REAPs to strengthen planning and programming will develop the capacity of RDA's \nPlanning Division to identify, formulate, and evaluate projects systematically and establish a \nformal process of developing multi-year highway development programs. A 5-year investment \nplan and a 20-year investment plan will be published by the end of 2003 and 2004, respectively. \n \n48.  REAPs for strengthening preconstruction processes and construction management will \nestablish the work processes and capacity to enable RDA to change from relying on RCDC to \nexecute  works  to  using  the  domestic  private  sector  under  contract,  focusing  on  project \npreparation and supervision competencies. In 2003, RDA will revise preconstruction processes, \nincluding associated manuals and technical information, and complete training of staff. These \nwill be introduced on a pilot basis by the end of 2004, and fully applied by the end of 2005. \n \n49.  Uniform, internationally proven processes for the management of construction contracts \nwill be introduced. In 2003, RDA will have prepared, tested, and approved the improved \nconstruction  management  procedures,  including  procedures  for  quality  control,  scheduling \npayments, monitoring payments, variations, and dispute resolution, which will thereby improve \nquality control, payment procedures, and decision making. These will be introduced on a pilot \nbasis by the end of 2004, and fully applied by the end of 2005. \n \n50.  The REAP for strengthening road maintenance management will establish objective \nsystems for planning and programming road maintenance works on the basis of economic \nreturns.  RDA  has  established  a  Maintenance  Management  Unit  responsible  for  planning, \nmanaging, and monitoring maintenance program. In 2003, this unit will develop and implement \na pavement management system for planning periodic maintenance, and establish a permanent \ncapacity to operate the system. Based on that, starting for 2005, RDA will prepare an annual \nperiodic maintenance plan. In 2003, a routine maintenance management system will also be \nestablished for estimating the workload, budgeting, and monitoring of routine maintenance, to \nbe applied in 2004 onward. \n \n51.  The REAP on road maintenance funding will streamline the road maintenance financing \nsystem and implement a strategy for increasing road maintenance financing. The streamlined \nroad maintenance budgeting and expenditure control is being implemented on a pilot basis, and \nwill be fully implemented under the Project. In 2003, the Government will (i) assess ways of \novercoming the shortfall between the required maintenance financing needs and the amount of \nmaintenance allocations provided, (ii) formulate financing mechanism to reduce the shortfall, \nand (iii) assess the amount that could be raised under different options including fuel levy. By \nmid-2004, a sustainable road maintenance financing mechanism to ensure adequate allocations \nwill be proposed, and targets for progressively increasing maintenance budgets to the levels \nrequired to sustain the country\u2019s road assets will be agreed upon, to be applied starting in 2005. \n \n52.  Through the REAP for technical audit, RDA will establish a technical audit capacity to \nsupport management control over technical performance. By the end of 2003, technical audit \nprocedures and guidelines will have been developed and tested. \n \n53.   The  REAP  for  LAR  will  streamline  the  LAR  system  and  implement  a  strategy  for \nensuring that the process will be carried out effectively and efficiently in accordance with the \nNational  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy.  The  plan  consists  of  institutional  strengthening, \nstreamlining procedures, and capacity building. RDA will establish a Social Impact Division and \nrecruit a sociologist/resettlement specialist to head the division. The division will consist of \nappropriately skilled staff, redeployed from within RDA or seconded from other agencies. By \nJune 2003, standard procedures as remedial measures of LAR problems will be introduced, and ", "     11 \nremedial measures of resettlement plan and resettlement implementation problems will be \nproposed to be approved by an interministerial committee18 and to be adopted by December \n2003. The approved procedures will be tested in preparing a resettlement plan for the national \nhighways  development  project.  The  effectiveness  of  the  streamlined  procedures  will  be \nevaluated, and further improvements will be recommended as necessary by the end of 2004. \n \nb.  Strengthening Provincial Road Provision \n54.  Through  an  IDP  the  Project  will  transform  the  PRAs19  into  professional  road \ninfrastructure managers with a focus on maintaining the PR network efficiently and effectively. \nThe PRAs will be responsible for the planning and programming of the road maintenance \nbudget,  preliminary  and  detailed  design  of  works,  contract  preparation  and  tendering  out \nmaintenance and upgrading works, as well as implementation and contract management. The \nnew structures will divide responsibilities between headquarters and divisional level branches of \nthe agencies. Planning, programming, designing, and procurement functions will be centralized \nat the headquarters, while part of procurement, implementation and contract management \nfunctions will be devolved to the divisional level. All road works, except for emergency works, \nwill be carried out by contracting out. The IDP will also include upgrading PRA offices and \nprocuring equipment consistent with the agreed upon functions.  \n \n55.  Modern road management as well as office management practices will need to be \nintroduced. This will include the introduction of appropriate information and communication \ntechnology tools such as the Road Economic Decision Model, developed by the World Bank, to \ncarry out the planning and programming functions, appropriate engineering software to aid in \ncarrying out detailed design work, the road maintenance budgeting and expenditure control \nmodule for financial management, as well as appropriate project management and monitoring \nsoftware. This will involve providing long-term advisory support to the PRAs, consisting of both \ninternational and domestic supervisory staff, and short-term specialist inputs.  \n \n56.  Objective road maintenance estimates will be prepared for each province. In the interim \nperiod, for FY2004 the Government has agreed to allocate a road maintenance budget of 10% \nmore than in FY1999. By the end of 2004, assisted by the reform consultant, the Government \nwill  propose  a  road  maintenance  financing  mechanism  that  can  ensure  adequate  and \nsustainable financial allocations (para. 51), to be applied starting in 2005. \n \n57.  A performance-based maintenance contract will be implemented starting in FY2005 for \nthe 20% of the PR network in maintainable condition. The contracts will be for a period of 5-7 \nyears and will be structured such that the capital expenditure is front-loaded while the payments \nare made in equal annual payments, starting with periodic maintenance in the first year followed \nby routine maintenance in the subsequent years of the contract period. The procurement of the \nthird phase civil works will be contingent on the achievement of the agreed upon milestones in \nthe IDP including road maintenance funding and implementation. \n \n2.  Investment Components \n58.  The proposed Project will include (i) civil works for rehabilitation of roads and bridges of \nabout 980 km or 12% of the PR network in North Central, North Western, Uva, and Western \n                                                 \n18 Chaired by the Secretary of MOH, and members from MHAPCLG, Ministry of Land, Central Environmental Agency, \nRDA, Survey Department, Government Printer, Valuation Department, and Attorney General's Department. \n19 The project provinces consist of Western, North Western, North Central, and Uva provinces. ", "12   \nprovinces; (ii) improvement of about 40 km of community access roads; (iii) consulting services \nfor construction supervision and for detailed design of NH development. \n \n59.  The provincial roads improvement (PRI) component will rehabilitate existing roads in the \nproject provinces to maintainable standard. The roads will be widened to maximum 6.7 meters \nwhere possible and the pavement will be strengthened. Bridges, drainage structures, and \nculverts will also be improved and replaced as necessary. The roads were determined from \ndetailed screening based on road condition, traffic, economic viability, economic development \npotential, and social factors, taking into account of the practicalities of combining road links in \npackages to be implemented economically. The community access roads will be determined \nduring implementation based on the criteria of (i) connecting community or agricultural centers \nto  the  main  project  roads;  (ii)  covering  footpaths,  simple  bridges,  and  drainage;  and  (iii) \nmaximum 1 km length for each package to be included in the main civil works contracts. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates \n \n60.  The estimated total cost is $92.5 million equivalent inclusive of taxes, duties, interest \nduring construction, and physical and price contingencies (Table 1). Foreign exchange costs are \nestimated  at  $32.8  million  (35.5%).  Local  currency  costs  are  estimated  at  $59.7  million \nequivalent (64.5%).

This loan will be ", "     13 \nadministered by ADB. As shown in Table 2, ADB will provide a loan of $56.5 million equivalent, \nor 61.1% of the total project cost, from its Special Funds resources, to finance 74.1% of the \nforeign exchange costs and 54.1% of the local currency costs. The ADB loan will have an \namortization period of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest rate of 1.0% \nduring the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The Government will finance 29.7% of the total \nproject cost, in local currency.20   \nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \nForeign  Local      \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Total  % \nADB  24.3  32.2  56.5  61.1 \nOPEC Fund  8.5   0.0  8.5  9.2 \nGovernment a  0.0  27.5  27.5  29.7 \nTotal  32.8  59.7  92.5  100.0 \na  \nIncluding taxes and duties. \n \n62.  Because  of  the  constraints  imposed  by  recent  macroeconomic  imbalances,  the \nbudgetary burden of the civil conflict, and uncertain medium-term economic prospects, the \nGovernment has been unable to finance a substantial portion of its investment program. The \nsituation has been exacerbated by the global economic slowdown, adverse weather conditions, \nand  the  negative  effect  of  the  attack  on  Colombo  international  airport  in  July  2001.  An \nagreement on a permanent ceasefire was signed in February 2002. Two rounds of peace-talks \nwere successfully concluded in September and November 2002. The Government is currently \nimplementing an economic reform program to stabilize macroeconomic and reduce the budget \ndeficit, but it is likely to still have difficulties for some years.21 Therefore, providing financing for \nlocal currency costs is considered justified under ADB\u2019s local currency financing policy. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n63.  As shown in Appendix 9, monitoring of overall implementation performance and use of \nloan funds will be the responsibility of the project steering committee, chaired by the secretary of \nMHAPCLG, and with representation from Ministry of Finance, MTHCA, MOH, RDA, External \nResources Department, National Planning Department, regional development ministries, the \nproject provincial councils, PRAs, and project implementation consultant. \n \na.  National Highway Provision   \n64.  MTHCA will be the Executing Agency for the NH provision. The chairperson of RDA will \nbe responsible for implementation activities, reporting to the secretary of MTHCA through the \nsecretary of MOH. A reform implementation unit (RIU) has been established in RDA, which will \ncoordinate implementation of the reform program and assist the directors of the RDA operating \n                                                 \n20 As requested by the Government, JBIC is considering parallel cofinancing to improve PRs and strengthen PRAs in \nSabaragamuwa and Central provinces. ADB and JBIC have extensively coordinated respective scope, financing, \nand  implementation  arrangements.  Both  confirmed  synergistic  and  balanced  development  impacts  of  the \nsimultaneous and well-coordinated interventions. JBIC is currently conducting its due diligence, to be completed by \nthe end of 2002, of its loan in the amount of about $80 million, based on the UNDP-funded feasibility study \n(para.19). \n21ADB is supporting public sector resource management through TAs for the Strengthening Public Expenditure \nManagement System, 1999, and for the Public Sector Resources Management, 2002. ", "14   \ndivisions in its implementation. RDA, in consultation with MTHCA  and MOH, has appointed a \nfull-time director as head of RIU with sufficient capability and experience to be effective in \ndealing with the senior management of RDA and RCDC. RDA will establish implementation \nunits in its operating divisions to carry out the REAPs. A reform consultant is being appointed to \nassist RIU and the RDA implementation units. RDA will also be responsible for the design of NH \ndevelopment.  \n \n65.  A reform program steering committee (RPSC), comprising representatives from the \npublic and private sectors, will be established to oversee the reform program and facilitate \ncoordination between the government agencies and the private sector. Chaired by the secretary \nof MTHCA, the RPSC will include representatives of MOH, RDA, RCDC, External Resources \nDepartment, the Institute of Construction Training and Development (ICTAD), the Contractors\u2019 \nAssociation, the Consultants\u2019 Association, and ADB\u2019s Sri Lanka Resident Mission. A Public-\nPrivate Partnership Task Force, chaired by the chairperson of RDA, has been established to \nprovide a forum for regular client-contractor dialogue.  \n \nb.  Provincial Road Provision and Provincial Roads Improvement \n66.  The Executing Agency for the reform of PR provision and the PRI component will be \nMHAPCLG,  which  will  be  responsible  for  overall  coordination  of  project  implementation \nincluding provision of policy guidance, and interagency coordination. A project coordination unit \n(PCU)  will  be  established,  responsible  for  planning,  management,  consultant  selection, \nprocurement, supervision, and coordination. The PCU, reporting to the secretary, headed by a \nsuitably qualified project director, will be supported by a technical specialist, an accountant, an \nengineer, and supporting staff.  \n \n67.  Through previous projects and TAs, MHAPCLG has obtained relevant experience and \nestablished implementation capacity, and will be further augmented through the consulting \nservices for supervision and IDP.  \n \n68.  In each of the 4 PRAs, a project implementation unit (PIU) will be established, to be \nresponsible for implementation of the Project in their respective provinces under the direction of \nthe PCU, and in consultation with MHAPCLG for important policy or implementation issues. \nPIUs will be responsible for procurement and project management, including (i) procurement \nand contract award, (ii) monitoring the progress of day-to-day project  implementation, (iii) \npreparing withdrawal applications, (iv) preparing progress reports, and (v) maintaining project \naccounts and complete loan financial records for auditing. A project manager, who is currently \nresponsible for the respective PRA, will be assigned, and will be supported by a group of \nprofessional and support staff with expertise and experience in procurement, accounting, road \nand structural engineering, construction supervision, and contract administration. Monitoring of \nperformance and use of funds at the provincial level will be the responsibility of the project \nmonitoring committee in each province, chaired by the chief secretary of the provincial council \nand with representation from the PRA and the implementation consultant. \n \n2.  Period of Implementation \n69.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 6 years inclusive of preconstruction \nactivities, reflecting the time required for specification and packaging of civil works contracts, \nand the approach to implementation, which will support capacity building within the PRA and \namong domestic private contractors, with support from the implementation consultant. The \nscheduled completion date for the civil works is December 2007 (Appendix 10).  ", "     15 \n \n3.  Procurement of Civil Works and Equipment \n70.  Procurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement and the Government\u2019s tender procedures acceptable to ADB. The civil works \ncontracts will be mainly for low-value rehabilitation works spread over a wide geographical area, \nand are unlikely to be attractive to foreign contractors. Therefore, civil works contracts, with \neach contract valued at a maximum of $2.0 million equivalent, will be procured under LCB \nprocedures. Supply contracts with values of $100,000-500,000 and for less than $100,000 will \nbe procured through international shopping and direct purchase arrangements respectively.  \n \n71.  Bidders will be prequalified by applying a single stage, two-envelope bidding procedure. \nEligible bidders will be either domestic private sector companies appropriately registered with \nICTAD or foreign companies in civil works from ADB's member countries. RCDC and other \nstate-owned company will not be eligible to bid. This restriction reflects the emphasis of the \nProject on establishing a competitive domestic private sector capacity in the road sector. The \nprevious ADB-funded projects in Sri Lanka have demonstrated that domestic contractors are \ncapable of successfully performing provincial road improvement contracts of this value with \nextensive capacity-building support from a supervision consultant. \n \n72.  Civil  works  contracts  are  indicated  for  52  road  and  19  bridge  contract  packages \n(Appendix 11) based on their geographical location and convenience for contractors to mobilize \nand organize their works, and will be implemented in three phases. The equipment for the \nreform program and IDP (Appendix 12) will be procured using international shopping or direct \npurchase procedures. Supply contracts for equipment will be packaged based on technical \nrequirements of the equipment and will be finalized during project implementation. Civil works \nfor office upgrading have an estimated value of less than $100,000 per province. These will be \nprocured using government procurement procedures and will be fully Government-financed.  \n4.  Consulting Services \n73.  Three consulting services packages will be required under the loan, each requiring an \ninternational consulting firm in association with domestic consultants. All consultants will be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using a quality and \ncost-based selection method and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic consultants. ADB has approved advance action for recruitment of consultants, without \ncommitting approval of the Project or financing of the action. \n \n74.  To support the reform of NH provision, about 60 and 130 person-months of international \nand domestic consultants, respectively, will be required. The consultants will assist RDA to \nimplement the REAPs; provide training to RDA staff in the application of new procedures and \nsystems; and assist the RDA RIU to monitor and evaluate progress, as outlined in Appendix 13. \n \n75.  A project implementation consultant will be required for (i) support to the PCU and PIUs \nin implementation of the PRI, (ii) IDP to strengthen the capability of the PRAs, and (iii) project \nperformance monitoring and evaluation. About 295 and 1,850 person-months of international \nand domestic consulting services, respectively, plus supporting staff will be provided. The \nconsultants will also provide on-the-job training to the counterpart staff (Appendix 14). \n ", "16   \n76.  The consulting services for NH  development will conduct detailed design of the roads \nselected for improvement by the ADB-funded TA feasibility study on NH development attached \nto the Project. Outline terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n77.  Loan disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, as \namended from time to time, and detailed arrangements between the Government and ADB. \nTwo imprest accounts will be established at the Central Bank, one is with RDA with an initial \nadvance of $200,000, and the other is with MHAPCLG with an initial amount of $3.2 million. \nSecond generation imprest accounts will be given to the PRAs, with an initial advance of \n$800,000  each.  MHAPCLG  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  PRAs'  accounts,  including \nmonthly  reconciliation  of  the  accounts  and  preparation  of  the  withdrawal  applications  for \nliquidation/replenishment of the imprest account. Statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures \nwill be used for individual payment of less than $100,000.  \n \n6.  Project Performance Management System \n78.  The Executing Agencies will monitor the preparation and implementation of the Project \nin accordance with the implementation schedule and the time-bound reform milestones, and will \nkeep ADB informed of any significant deviations resulting in the milestones not being met.  \n \na.   Accounts and Audit \n79.  The  Executing  Agencies  and  PIUs  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts \nadequate to identify the financing resources received and expenditures made on the Project. \nThese Project accounts and related financial statements will be audited annually in accordance \nwith sound auditing standards by auditors acceptable to ADB. The Government will submit \nannual audited reports and related financial statements to ADB within 9 months after the end of \neach fiscal year. The audit of the imprest account and SOE can be carried out as part of the \nregular annual audit. The auditor\u2019s opinion of that part of the examination relating to the imprest \naccount and SOE should be separately set out in the auditor\u2019s report. \n \n    b.  Reports \n \n80.  The Executing Agencies will submit to ADB and the OPEC Fund monthly progress \nreports on their respective components in such forms and detail as required, based on which, \nwith assistance from the consultants, the overall Project performance report will be submitted \nquarterly by the PSC. The RPSC will provide independent verification of the progress in \nimplementation of the reform program, including achievement of the milestones. The quarterly \nreport is an executive summary of the detailed reports, including basic data, utilization of funds, \nachievement of immediate development objectives, compliance with covenants, implementation \nprogress, and major issues and problems. Initially, a baseline for performance monitoring will be \nestablished in accordance with ADB's  Project Performance Management System Handbook, \nbased on the key indicators and targets outlined in the project framework.  \n \n81.  Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the Government will furnish to \nADB a project completion report providing a detailed evaluation of the project design, costs, \ncontractors\u2019 and consultants\u2019 performance, social and economic impact, economic rate of return, \nand other details as may be requested by ADB.  \n ", "     17 \n82.  With assistance from the reform consultants, support will be provided for promoting high \nstandards of transparency and cost-effectiveness in procurement by RDA: (i) establishing of an \nRDA  website  supporting  the  introduction  of  e-procurement  activities  by  the  end  of  2003, \nincluding provision of information about upcoming tenders, and disclosure of tender awards; and \n(ii) conducting an evaluation in 2004 of the transparency, efficiency, and cost effectiveness of \nRDA\u2019s arrangements and procedures for procuring civil works from the private sector, and their \nadequacy for supporting development of a competitive domestic road contracting industry.  \n  c.  Project Review \n83.  In addition to regular reviews by ADB staff, a detailed midterm review of the Project will \nbe carried out around June 2004. The Government will submit to ADB a detailed progress report \non the implementation and achievements of the reform program, and accomplishment of the \nreform implementation milestones, 2 months prior to the midterm review.  \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n84.  A  project  preparatory  TA  for  $850,000  for  the  National  Highways  Development \n(Appendix 15) will be provided covering the feasibility study for development of priority NHs for \ninclusion as an investment component for possible future ADB financing. The medium-term \nhighway development plan (para. 47) will provide basis for selecting the NHs under the TA.  \n \n85.  A TA for $500,000 for Passenger Transport Services Improvement (Appendix 16) will be \nprovided  to  (i)  formulate  institutional  and  policy  reforms  needed  to  secure  the  efficient, \nequitable, and sustainable delivery of passenger transport services by both private and public \noperators; (ii) assist in the implementation of the current Government initiative to introduce \npublic-private  partnerships  in  the  state-owned bus sector; and (iii) prepare complementary \npriority investments in the passenger bus sector. The TA will develop a program of institutional \nand policy reform measures for improving transport services using roads, including regulatory \nissues relating to the operation of buses, and management of bus stations and bus stands. \nThese will take into account their overall importance to providing the general public with efficient \ntransport services, the potential contribution to poverty reduction, the scope for increased \nprivate sector participation, and opportunity to introduce innovations to improve transparency \nand governance in general. \n \n86.  Both TAs will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. Each TA will be carried out by a team of domestic and international \nconsultants, to be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n87.  The  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  be  people,  companies,  and  government  and \nnongovernment agencies throughout the country that use road transport services directly or \nindirectly. The beneficiaries of the investment component will be (i) communities served by the \nproject roads that will benefit from improved, lower cost, and faster transport services, and \nthereby obtain improved access to economic opportunities and social services, and reduced \nisolation or remoteness from other parts of the country; (ii) transport operators serving these \ncommunities; and (iii) companies and employees operating or serving these communities. \n ", "18   \n1.  Policy and Institutional Aspects \n88.  The Project and TAs will improve the overall performance of the road sector, contributing \nto transport efficiency. This will improve the returns and sustainability of existing and future \ninvestments in the sector, and contribute to the growth of a wide range of other economic \nactivities that make use of road transport services. Access to improved bus and road freight \nservices  will  help  to  reduce  poverty  by  enabling  growth  in  poor  peoples\u2019  incomes  and \nemployment, reducing transport services costs, and improving access to social services.  \n \n89.  The  Project  will  open  up  the  market  for  road  provision  works  for  private  sector \ndevelopment. This will include increasing the proportion of civil works and engineering assigned \nto  the  domestic  private  sector.  The  Project  will  also  address  issues  of  plant  availability, \naggregate supply, contractor training, and establishment of private consulting engineering firms. \nReflecting the emphasis of the Project on establishing a competitive domestic private sector \ncapacity, all civil works will be designed for LCB contracts, and no state-owned agencies will be \neligible to bid. Bus regulation, efficiency of bus operators, and management of bus stations and \nbus stands will also be addressed under the proposed TA. \n \n90.  Overall, the Project will develop a program of institutional and policy reform for improving \nthe efficiency of road sector institutions including government agencies, the private sector \ncontracting industry, and transport services operators. This will provide the general public with \nefficient transport, the potential contribution to poverty reduction, the scope for increased private \nsector participation, and innovations to improve transparency and governance in general. \n \n2.  Technical Aspects \n91.  The PRI will involve rehabilitation and improvement of about 980 km of roads in the \nproject provinces to maintainable standard roads. The existing roads will be widened where \npossible; the pavement will be strengthened; and bridges, culverts, and drainage structures will \nalso be improved and replaced as necessary. These will improve the capacity, safety, and level \nof service of the roads. Also, a sustainable road maintenance funding scheme developed under \nthe Project will ensure that the existing roads reach their design life.  \n \n3.  Social Aspects \n92.  Lack of capacity and poor condition of roads are among the main constraints preventing \npoor people from gaining access to economic opportunities and good quality services. The \nProject  will  improve  the  overall  performance  of  the  road  sector,  thereby  alleviating  these \nconstraints and contributing to poverty reduction. \n \n93.  The  Project  roads  serve  communities  located  away  from  the  centers  of  economic \nactivity, which have high poverty levels due to a lack of available economic opportunities, poor \neducational attainment, and social problems. Estimated poverty rates in these areas (38%) are \nabove the national rates (30%). The poor earn low incomes because they are engaged in poorly \nremunerated activities (farm labor) or are unemployed. Improvements in PRs will open up the \ncommunities to a range of new opportunities that will help to reduce poverty. The availability and \nfrequency of bus and road freight services will increase, and the travel time and cost for the \nservices will decrease. The contributions to poverty reduction include (i) improved access for \nfarmers to higher price urban markets and to produce higher value, perishable products; (ii) \nincreased  access  to  employment  opportunities  outside  the  community;  (iii)  lower  cost  of \ntransport services; and (iv) improved access to education and other social services. The poverty ", "     19 \nimpact ratios of representative roads for Uva, North Western, and North Central provinces are \nestimated to be more than 0.5, well above the poor's share of national income.  \n \n94.  The PRI does not require LAR. No new roads will be developed. The works were \ndesigned, using engineering solutions, to ensure that improvements will be within the existing \nright-of-way and to avoid resumption of right-of-way if this would cause displacement.  \n \n95.  The Project will generate direct and indirect employment opportunities in the private \nsector. However, there will be a gradual reduction of casual labor within RCDC and RDA. A \ntransition plan is being prepared that may include (i) freezing recruitment, (ii) early retirement \npackages, and (iii) incentives to private contractors to hire them. The Government will ensure \nthat the mechanisms of casual labor reduction comply with all applicable labor laws in Sri Lanka \nand take into account ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy. \n \n4.  Economic Aspects \n96.  The overall improvement in the performance of the roads sector will increase transport \nefficiency. This will improve the returns and sustainability of existing and future investments in \nthe sector, and contribute to growth of a wide range of other economic activities that use road \ntransport services. Without  the improvements, traffic will incur high transport operating costs \ndue to poor road conditions. With the improvements, these costs will be reduced.   \n \n97.  The economic analysis (Appendix 18) of the PRI considers the estimated costs and \nbenefits over the construction period and 20 years of operation. The estimated costs consist of \ninvestment costs and incremental operating costs. The estimated benefits are savings in vehicle \noperating costs and passenger time. The estimated economic internal rate of return of the \noverall Project is 26.1%, or 23.1% for North Central, 21.1% for North Western, 17.8% for Uva, \nand 36.6% for Western provinces. The switching value is 123% for costs and 55% for benefits. \nSensitivity tests carried out to examine the impact of higher investment costs and lower benefits \nall show an acceptable estimated economic internal rate of return.  \n \n5.  Environmental Aspects \n98.  The PRI is classified as an environmental category B project. The initial environmental \nexamination (IEE), prepared in accordance with the ADB environmental guidelines, confirmed \nthat  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  expected  and  that  a  detailed \nenvironmental impact assessment is not required. A supplementary study examined possible \nimpacts  on  Sri  Lankan  elephants,  and  found  them  insignificant.  The  PIUs  will  implement \nenvironmental management and monitoring plans for the road improvements. A Summary IEE \noutlines the measures to be incorporated in civil  works contracts and to form part of the \nconstruction supervision team\u2019s duties to mitigate environmental impacts during construction. \nAn  environmental  expert  will  be  hired  under  the  consultant  to  strengthen  the  PRAs  in \nenvironmental assessment and mitigation. RDA capacity in preconstruction processes, including \nin environmental impact assessment, will be strengthened as necessary. \n \nB.  Project Risks \n99.  The significant risk for the Project is that the reform program will not be implemented in \nfull, leading to improvements in sector performance being less than intended. This risk has been \nmitigated  in  the  design  of  the  Project  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  upon  medium-term \nprogram, with milestones that have to be met for future ADB involvement in the sector.  ", "20   \n \n100.  A risk for road investments under the Project is that operation and maintenance will be \ninadequate. This risk will be addressed directly through the reform program elements to improve \nthe planning, execution, and financing of road maintenance. These will include (i) strengthening \nof  road  maintenance  management  and  establishing  objective  systems  for  planning  and \nprogramming road maintenance works on the basis of economic returns; (ii) road maintenance \nworks  to  be  undertaken  by  the  private  sector  on  the  basis  of  competition;  and  (iii)  road \nmaintenance  budgeting  and  expenditure  control,  and  mechanism  for  increasing  road \nmaintenance funding to the levels required to sustain the country\u2019s road assets. \n \n101.  The economic analysis of the provincial road improvements suggests there are no \nsignificant economic risks. As is generally expected in the case for road rehabilitation and \nimprovement works of this kind, the estimated economic returns are high.  \n \n102.  The main implementation risks for the provincial road improvements concern the limited \nexperience and capacity of contractors. These are mitigated by the relatively simple nature of \nthe works. Sufficient provision has been made for the project implementation consultant to \nsupervise contractors and provide assistance and training to build up their skills and capacity. \n \n103.  The risk of inadequate counterpart funding has been addressed by gaining government \ncommitment to include the Project in its core projects starting in FY2003 to ensure that budget \nallocations for it will be protected. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n104.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, which will be incorporated into the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Counterpart funds.  The Government will ensure the timely and adequate \nprovision of counterpart funds for the Project. \n(ii)  Environmental.  The Government will ensure that the Project complies with the \nADB  environmental  guidelines,  and  all  environmental  mitigation  measures \nidentified in the Summary IEE are incorporated in the design, and followed during \nthe construction, operation, and maintenance of the Project. \n(iii)  Private sector participation.  The Government will ensure that consolidated \nfund-financed road works over SLRs2.5 million per contract will be contracted out \nto the domestic private sector in Sri Lanka in the amount of (a) SLRs1.5 billion in \nFY2003, (b) SLRs2.0 billion in FY2004, (c) no less than 50% of such contracts in \nFY2006, and (d) no less than 75% of such contracts in FY2008. \n(iv)  Reengineering RDA \n(a) the Government will ensure that the RDA annual expenditure on contracts \nunder SLRs2.5 million during FY2002-FY2008 is not above the FY2000 level.  \n(b) RDA will publish a medium-term highway development plan by December \n2003 and a long-term highway development plan by December 2004. \n(c) RDA will approve revised preconstruction processes by December 2003 and \napply  them  by  December  2005,  and  improve  construction  management ", "     21 \nprocedures to be applied on a pilot basis by December 2004 and apply them \nto all RDA construction projects by December 2005.       \n(d)  RDA will, by December 2003, develop pavement management and routine \nmaintenance management systems, and apply them starting in FY2004. \n(e) The Government will implement streamlined road maintenance budgeting \nand expenditure control procedures starting in 2003; formulate and propose a \nfinancing mechanism for sustainable road maintenance for ADB approval by \nJune 2004; and apply the approved mechanism commencing in FY2005. \n(f)  RDA will establish a technical audit unit, and develop and test technical audit \nprocedures by December 2003. \n(g) The Government will establish an interministerial committee and a Social \nImpact Division within RDA in 2003, and develop and approve streamlined \nprocedures and strategies for improving LAR in the road sector in accordance \nwith  the  National  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy, by December 2003.     \n \n(v)  Strengthening provincial road administration.

The changes in the role of the Road Construction and Development Company (RCDC), \nand  the  development  of  private  sector  participation,  are  intended  to  establish  a  strong, \ncompetitive domestic private sector capacity to perform most of the civil works and related \nservices for highways administered by the Road Development Authority (RDA). Since RCDC \npresently accounts for the majority of domestic capacity, and private sector capacity is limited, it \nwill be necessary to transfer responsibility for road provision work from RCDC to the private \nsector, and to do so in stages. This will be accomplished over a period of 7 years (from 2002 to \n2008). By the end of that period, RCDC will be performing about 25% of the work financed from \nthe Consolidated Fund, and the private sector will be performing about 75%. RCDC will be \nprovided with the full autonomy of a private company to enable it to realize its potential for \nundertaking larger scale, equipment-intensive operations. \n \n2.  To build up private sector capacity and mitigate the possible risks of contractor failure, \ntransitional arrangements will be adopted for engaging private contractors during  the first 3 \nyears. RCDC will engage private contractors on a subcontract basis, and in doing so will build \nup the capacity of the contractors through on-the-job supervision and training; supplement their \nequipment and other inputs; and guarantee the performance of the works to RDA. \n \n3.  The  following  arrangements  will  be  adopted  for  the  private  sector  share  of  RDA \nconstruction and maintenance works over SLRs2.5 million financed from the consolidated fund: \n \n(i)  In 2002, RDA will assign SLRs1 billion of works to be carried out by the private \nsector,  with  RCDC  as  the  prime  contractor  and  20  qualified  local  private \ncontractors as subcontractors. The subcontractors will be assigned equal shares \nof the work, to be remunerated on the basis of the Highways Standard Rates.  \n \n(ii)  In 2003, RDA will assign SLRs1.5 billion of works to be carried out by the private \nsector. The 10 most successful contractors from the first year will graduate to \nworking under direct contract for RDA, using simplified procurement procedures, \nto carry out SLRs1 billion of works. The remaining SLRs0.5 billion works will be \nexecuted by the other 10 contractors, subcontracting through RCDC.  \n \n(iii)  In 2004, RDA will assign SLRs2 billion of works to be carried out by the private \nsector. The 10 subcontractors from the second year will graduate and, together \nwith the 10 graduated after the first year, will be engaged directly by RDA to carry \nout  SLRs1.5  billion  of  works,  using  simplified  procurement  procedures.  The \nremaining SLRs0.5 billion will be executed by 10 additional contractors to be \nengaged as subcontractors with RCDC as prime contractor. \n \n(iv)  At the end of 2005, the role of RCDC as an intermediary will come to an end. All \nwork by the private sector will be arranged through contracts between RDA and \nprivate contractors, which will be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding.  \n \n(v)  By 2006, the private sector will undertake at least 50% of this work (by value), \nand by 2008, the private sector will undertake at least 75%. \n \n4.  For the duration of the reform program to be supported by the Asian Development Bank, \nthe total RDA annual expenditure on works under SLRs2.5 million will not be increased. RCDC \nand RDA will gradually reduce their casual labor, with no new recruitment.  \n ", "DETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($ million)\nADB  OPEC GOSL % % Total\nBase \nForeign Local Total FX LC FX LC LC FX Costs\nA.

An efficient road network, linking villages, \ntowns, and cities will provide stronger linkages between remote and poor regions and more developed markets. \nRemoval of the physical bottlenecks in the road network and improvement of the policy and institution will \nimprove the overall performance of the road sector, thereby alleviating these constraints and reducing poverty. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \nThe proportion of poor among the project beneficiaries in 3 provinces will be significantly larger (52%, 47%, and \n55%) than their proportion in the overall population in the country (31%), the exception being Western Province \n(23%). However, the absolute number of the poor among beneficiaries in Western Province is more than 30% \nof the total poor beneficiaries. The Project is expected to (i) improve access for farmers to higher price urban \nmarkets and to support production of higher value, perishable products; (ii) increase access to employment \nopportunities outside the community; (iii) lower cost of transport services; and (iv) improve access to education, \nhealth, and other social services. \n \nC.

The policy and institutional reform program was developed based on the stakeholder analysis prepared \nunder TA 3110-SRI: Reengineering Road Sector Institution.  \n\u2022  Participation strategy:   \nYes. The reform program was developed through stakeholder participation including government agencies to \nbe reformed, the private sector, chamber of commerce, civil society, the contractors association, the engineers \nassociation, and labor unions. Selection of the roads to be improved was based on social requirements, road \nconditions,  and  economic  importance.

Methodology \n \n1.  The economic analysis of the provincial roads improvements compared the costs and \nbenefits  of  the  with-  and  without-the-Project  scenarios.  In  the  without  case,  traffic  would \nexperience high vehicle operating costs (VOC) due to poor road conditions. In the with case, \nVOC would be lower as a result of road improvements. The analysis period covered 20 years of \noperation after completion of civil works. No residual value was allowed at the end of the period. \nCosts and benefits in financial prices were adjusted to economic prices by deducting taxes and \nduties and by applying a standard conversion factor of 0.785 to nontraded goods.  \n \nB.  Road Selection \n \n2.  A survey was carried out on more than 2,000 provincial roads in North Central, North \nWestern, Uva, and Western provinces, covering a combined length of about 5,100 kilometers \n(km). A simplified economic evaluation was carried out for the purpose of preliminary screening \nof candidate roads. The candidate road improvements were then ranked in order of estimated \neconomic  returns.  Drawing  upon  the  social  indicators  obtained  for  each  road,  a  social \ndevelopment factor was calculated for each candidate road, and this was used to produce a \nsocial ranking. A combined economic and social ranking was then prepared and used for \nselecting roads for improvement in each of the four provinces. Based on this ranking, 175 road \nsections in 52 groups were selected for improvement, covering about 1,000 km.  \n \nC.  Traffic Forecasts \n \n3.  After selection of the priority roads for improvement, the preliminary traffic counts were \nsupplemented by conducting a 2-day 12-hour count, from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm, on each of the \nselected  roads,  using  the  same  vehicle  categories  as  the  earlier  counts.  It  shows  that \nmotorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles had the highest prevalence among vehicle categories. \nVans and pick-ups were the four-wheeled vehicle types with the highest prevalence. \n \n4.  The annual growth rate for motorized traffic was assumed to be 4% over the analysis \nperiod, based on the assumption that the average annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth \nrates will be 3-6% in 2001-2006, at 2.5-5.5% in 2007-2015, and 2-5% in 2016-2020.  Overall \ngrowth in traffic was assumed to be approximately 1.1 times the forecast growth in GDP. \nNonmotorized traffic was assigned an annual growth rate of 2% throughout the plan period. The \ntraffic forecasts conservatively assumed that there would be no generated traffic. \n \nD.  Construction and Maintenance Costs \n \n5.  Based on the results of the road condition survey, a treatment was selected for each \nroad. The treatment options for asphalt roads were granular overlay and double bituminous \nsurface treatment (DBST), or reconstruction with granular base and DBST. The options for \ngravel roads were upgraded gravel or granular overlay and DBST. The costs were determined \nusing unit rates published by the Road Development Authority, and took into account terrain and \na \u201cprovincial factor\u201d to reflect such factors as remoteness, material haul distance, and contractor \navailability. The costs included provision for side drainage, bridge and culvert maintenance, and \nroad widening where appropriate. Standard costs were developed for roads of 3 meters (m) 4 \nm, and 4.5 m width, with initial condition of good, fair, and poor.  \n \n ", "62  Appendix 18 \n6.  Maintenance costs were calculated using the World Bank\u2019s Highway Development and \nManagement model (HDM-4). Unit prices for treatments were SLRs250 per square meter (m2) \nfor patching, SLRs40 per m2 for crack sealing, and SLRs27, 000 per km for grading. \n \nE.  Vehicle Operating Costs \n \n7.  HDM-4 was used to estimate VOC for traffic in each vehicle category on each selected \nroad in the with and without cases. Estimates of the value of time (VOT) for passengers on work \ntrips were also prepared. Table A18.1 provides an illustration of the differences in VOC and \nVOT in the with and without cases for roads currently in poor condition. Improved road surface \nand increased running speeds are forecast to reduce VOC by more than one third.  \n \nTable A18.1: Vehicle Operating Costs and Value of Time With and Without the Project \n(SLRs per km, Economic Prices) \n \n  Motorcycle/ Pickup/Light \nBus  Car/Jeep  3-wheeler  Truck  Truck  Van/Minibus \n  With With With With- With With\n  Item  -out  With  -out  With  -out  With  out  With  -out  With  -out  With \n                       \nVehicle Operating Cost \nBefore improvement  18.3  18.3  12.0  12.0  3.8  3.8  12.5  12.5  22.7  22.7  16.7  16.7 \n3 years after  20.7  12.1  13.4  9.3  4.3  2.5  14.3  8.4  25.3  16.0  19.1  10.6 \n8 years after  20.6  12.4  13.4  9.4  4.3  2.6  14.3  8.5  25.3  16.3  19.1  10.8 \n13 years after  20.7  12.6  13.4  9.5  4.3  2.6  14.3  8.7  25.3  16.6  19.1  11.0 \n18 years after  20.7  13.0  13.4  9.6  4.3  2.7  14.3  8.9  25.3  17.2  19.1  11.4 \n                       \nValue of Time \nBefore improvement  8.5  8.5  2.5  2.5  1.3  1.3  0.9  0.9  0.5  0.5  7.9  7.9 \n3 years after  10.1  6.4  3.0  2.0  1.6  0.9  1.1  0.7  0.6  0.4  9.7  5.0 \n8 years after  10.1  6.4  3.0  2.0  1.6  0.9  1.1  0.7  0.6  0.4  9.7  5.0 \n13 years after  10.1  6.4  3.1  2.0  1.6  0.9  1.1  0.7  0.6  0.4  9.7  5.0 \n18 years after  10.1  6.5  3.1  2.0  1.6  0.9  1.1  0.7  0.6  0.4  9.7  5.1 \n           \nApproximate Share    \n4%  5%  60%  5%  6%  20% \nof total capital \n \nF.  Benefits and Beneficiaries \n \n8.  The quantified benefits of the project were savings in VOC and savings in VOT due to \nimprovement of road conditions. The main beneficiaries of the proposed improvements will be \nroad users, benefiting from lower road user costs and higher vehicle speeds. They will also \nbenefit from more reliable road access and more comfortable journeys. The beneficiaries will \ninclude vehicle owners, passengers, consignors of freight, consumers, and other transport \nusers. Since most of the population served by provincial roads make use of road transport, the \nbenefits are likely to be spread over a large section of the community. Most vehicles operating \nin the project area do so on a commercial basis; very few are used for personal transport. The \ndistribution of benefits among beneficiaries will depend largely on the degree to which VOC \nsavings are passed on to passengers, consignors of freight, and consumers of goods. Since the \nroad haulage industry is characterized by a high level of competition, it may be expected that \nmuch of reduction in VOC will be quickly passed on to customers through lower freight rates. In \nthe case of passenger services, until such time as the present controls on bus fares are \nchanged to support a more competitive market for bus services, the benefits of lower VOC will \nonly be passed on gradually to customers.  \n \n ", "    Appendix 18  63 \nG.  Economic Evaluation \n \n9.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  proposed  provincial  road \nimprovements  was  estimated  on  the  basis  of  the  projected  streams  of  annual  costs  and \nbenefits. The estimated overall EIRR was 26.1%. The estimated EIRRs for the proposed \nimprovements in each province were 23.1% for North Central, 21.1% for North Western, 17.8% \nfor Uva, and 36.6% for Western Province. The majority of estimated benefits were for VOC \nsavings. VOT savings were relatively small. The calculation of the overall EIRR is shown in \nTable A18.2. The estimated EIRRs of individual selected roads were generally well above the \nEIRR threshold of 12%.

The sensitivity \nanalysis is shown in Table A18.4. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The switching value shows the percentage increase in a cost variable (or decline in a benefit variable) required for \nthe net present value (NPV) to become zero, which is the same as the EIRR decreasing to the cutoff level of 12%. \n ", "64  Appendix 18 \nTable A18.3: Estimated EIRRs for Sample of Selected Roads \n \n       \nRoad Section  EIRR (%)  Road Section  EIRR (%) \n       \nAlisthana - Thuruwila  29.0  Medirigiriya - Chaittya    85.2 \nAmbalammulla - Katunayake  26.0  Meegoda - Gehenuwala - Artigala  37.1 \nAnuradhapura - Arippu   42.0  Melsiripura - Rambe   25.9 \nBadagamuwa - Wellawa   33.3  Munagama - Millewa  28.0 \nBalaharuwa - Hambegamuwa   34.4  Muppana - Medgama  40.3 \nBathalagoda - Pangolla   19.9  Nawagmuwa - Koratota  59.0 \nDachchadamana - Puhudivulwewa  12.3  Nawinna - Rajamahawihara   59.2 \nDambagalla - Mariarawa   19.0  Oruwela - Mullegama  29.5 \nDiulwewa - Galadenigama   37.3  Palliyawatte - Dikkowita  59.7 \nDodangoda - Thebuwana  22.8  Pelanwatta - Kosgahahena  45.7 \nGanewatta - Nagollagama   25.5  Raigama - Anguruwatota  30.6 \nHendiyapola - Deduruoya   54.7  Seepukulama-Galenbindunuwewa  28.6 \nHokandara - Kottawa  78.0  Thalawa - Siyambalangamuwa   20.5 \nHomagama - Talagala  127.5  Thotawathta - Ambalanduwa  91.2 \nKerawalapitiya - Mahabage  75.1  Thumbowila - Wewala  78.1 \nKothalawala    36.2  Udahamulla - Thalapathpitiya  150.2 \nKudaoya - Balaharuwa   22.4  Urulemulla - Thalawatta  13.0 \nMailagastenna-Thoranakapolla-Kottagoda  45.1  Welikemulla-Medagama-Wevelhinna  15.8 \nMalwana - Samanabedde  44.8  Yakalla - Mukalanyaya   17.8 \nMapakada - Keselpotha   25.3  Yangalmodera - Morawalapitiya   22.7 \n \nTable A18.4: EIRR Sensitivity Analysis \n \n \nScenario  EIRR (%) \nBase case  26.1 \n1 year delay  24.0 \n2 year delay  20.3 \n3 year delay  18.3 \n20% Increase in Project Costs  22.4 \n20% Reduction in Benefits  21.6 \n20% Increase in Project Costs and 20% Reduction in Project Benefits  18.2 \n \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R327-02 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20021202111857Z", "Title": "R327-02", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 4.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20030205151924+08'00'"}}
