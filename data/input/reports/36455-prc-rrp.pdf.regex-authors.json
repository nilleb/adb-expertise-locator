An environmental impact assessment was undertaken, \nAssessment  and the summary was circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors and \nuploaded to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) website on 3 May \n2007. \n   \nProject Description  The Project is located in Yunnan Province, one of the poorest areas \nin the PRC. It has one of the lowest levels of per capita gross \ndomestic product in the PRC, at only 56% of the national average in \n2006.  The  Project  is  designed  to  promote  inclusive  sustainable \neconomic growth in central Yunnan, preparing it to cope with an \nincreasingly important role in regional cooperation and trade with \nGreater Mekong Subregion (GMS) countries. \n \nThe  Project  will  develop  an  integrated  road  transport  network  in \ncentral  Yunnan  by  (i)  constructing  a  64-kilometer  (km)  Wuding\u2013\nKunming Expressway and associated facilities, (ii) upgrading local \nroads in the project area with a total length of 190 km, (iii) improving \ntraffic  safety  on  the  local  road  network  in  the  project  area,  and \n(iv) strengthening the technical and management capacity of Yunnan \nProvincial  Communications  Department  (YPCD),  its  related \nagencies, and Wukun Expressway Company Limited (WKEC). \n \nRationale  The Project reflects ADB\u2019s transport sector strategy, which focuses \non  (i) financing  new  roads  that  connect  major  growth  centers, \nsupported by a system of local roads; (ii) promoting road safety, \ncutting  vehicle  emissions,  and  raising  energy  efficiency; \n(iii) improving  the  commercial  orientation  and  efficiency  of \nexpressway  organizations;  and  (iv)  strengthening  regional \ncooperation in transport. The Project was formulated in line with the \nPRC Western Region Development Strategy, which aims to reduce \ndevelopment disparities between the western and coastal regions.  \n \nUnderdeveloped roads and associated high transportation costs are \nmajor barriers to the reduction of poverty in Yunnan. Rural poverty \nincidence  is  high  in  the  project  area,  particularly  in  the  minority \ncounties. Existing transport infrastructure is congested, creating high \ntransport  costs  for  producers  and  consumers.  This  transport \nbottleneck needs to be removed to facilitate the movement of goods \nand people within Yunnan, between Yunnan and other parts of the \nPRC, and between the PRC and GMS countries. \n ", "ii \n  The  Project  will  improve  an  important  section  from  Wuding  to \nKunming of the Chengdu\u2013Kunming corridor, a high priority western \ndevelopment corridor in the PRC. The Project will be the fourth road \nproject  for  ADB  financing  in  Yunnan,  and  will  complement  ADB \nassistance in developing the Chengdu\u2013Kunming corridor and three \nGMS corridors: (i) North\u2013South Economic Corridor to Bangkok (via \nnorthern Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic), (ii) Eastern Corridor to \nHa  Noi/Hai  Phong  in  Viet  Nam,  and  (iii) Northern  Corridor  to \nNanning/Fangcheng in Guangxi (Map 1). \n \nThe Project will support a local road safety enhancement program to \nestablish an efficient and sustainable mechanism to manage road \nsafety. Its findings will be used to develop policy and strategies to \nreduce traffic accidents on local roads. It will be the first ADB loan to \nassess and finance the local road safety issues in the PRC. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  of  the  Project  is  a  well-functioning  integrated  road \ntransport system in Yunnan Province and the rest of the GMS. This \nwill  be  achieved  by  developing  an  efficient,  safe,  and \nenvironmentally sustainable regional transport system to facilitate \nthe movement of goods and people within Yunnan, and between the \nPRC and GMS countries.   \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $745  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $31 million. Of the $200 million ADB \nloan,  $6  million  will  finance  the  local  road  safety  enhancement \ncomponent.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nSource   Amount\nAsian Development Bank   200.0  \nDomestic Bank Loans  211.5 \nMinistry of Communications   98.6 \nYunnan Provincial Government   234.9 \n    Total      745.0 \n \n   \n  A loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. The loan will have a 24-year term including a grace \nperiod of 4 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% \nper annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nLoan and Project Agreements. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  available  by  the  PRC \nTerms  Government to Yunnan Provincial Government (YPG) on the same \nterms and conditions as ADB loan. YPG will apply $6 million to local \nroad  safety  enhancement  program,  and  onlend  $194  million  to \nWKEC on the same financial terms and conditions as those of the \nADB loan. WKEC will bear the interest rate variation and foreign \nexchange risks.  \n   \n ", "  iii \nPeriod of Utilization  30 June 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project   \nCompletion Date  31 December 2012 \n   \nExecuting Agency  Yunnan Provincial Communications Department (YPCD) \n   \nImplementation  YPCD will be responsible for overall implementation of the Project. \nArrangements  WKEC will be responsible for the expressway and capacity building \ncomponents.  YPCD  through  the  project  management  office  will \nimplement  the  local  road  improvement  and  local  road  safety \nenhancement components. \n   \nProcurement  Goods  and  works  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). Contracts and mode of procurement envisaged \nunder  the  Project  are  indicated  in  the  procurement  plan.  ADB \napproved advance contracting on 16 May 2007. \n   \nConsulting Services  The  ADB  loan  will  finance  36  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services for supervising construction; providing advice on \nhighway  design,  bridge,  tunnel,  road  safety,  and  the  intelligent \ntransport system. The international consultants will be recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time). \n \nThe Project will also finance national consulting services for the local \nroad safety strategy study at an estimated cost of no more than \n$100,000. The national consultants will be recruited in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. In addition, YPCD \nwill engage and finance 5,500 person-months of national consulting \nservices.  All  national  consultants  not  financed  by  ADB  will  be \nrecruited in accordance with government procedures acceptable to \nADB. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project was identified as a high priority project under the GMS \nBeneficiaries  Transport Sector Strategy, which was endorsed by the six GMS \ngovernments  in  2006.  The  Project  will  help  operationalize  the \nstrategic priority of strengthening connectivity and facilitating cross-\nborder movement and tourism under ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation \nStrategy and Program for the GMS. It will have a significant positive \nimpact on the economic development of the GMS. \n \nThe  expressway  will  reduce  travel  time  between  Wuding  and \nKunming by at least 1 hour and shorten the travel distance by 20 km. \nImproved  local  roads  will  link  villages  to  the  road  network  and \nnational highways, and hence to the national and regional economy. \nImproved local road safety will reduce traffic accidents. A developed \nand efficient transport network will integrate poor isolated regions \nwith the centers of economic growth. \n \n ", "iv \n  The Project will directly benefit about 1.93 million people living in the \nproject area, of whom 61% live in rural areas. Some 25% of rural \npeople live on less than $1 per person per day. The Project will also \nbenefit other people living in Yunnan and neighboring provinces, as \nwell as GMS countries. \n \nThe Project will directly benefit road users (e.g., passengers, traders, \ntransport providers, and bus and truck operators), as well as labor, \nthe local economy, and the private sector. It will help reduce traffic \naccidents, vehicle emissions, and traffic noise in the corridor. The \nProject will also boost tourism. Rural households will be important \nbeneficiaries\u2014from  increased  incomes  through  better  access  to \nroads, services, markets, and other off-farm opportunities. \n \nThe  Project  is  economically  and  financially  justifiable  and \nsustainable. The economic internal rate of return for the Project is \nestimated  at  17.1%.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the \nexpressway  component  is  4.3%,  which  is  higher  than  the  real \nweighted average cost of capital.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Overall, the project risk is rated modest. The Project is formulated to \nreduce technical, financial, safety, and social risks. These have been \nassessed and mitigating measures have been provided.  \n \nThe  main  technical  risks  are  associated  with  the  construction  of \ntunnels and bridges. To avoid delays in construction and increased \ncost, the Project will ensure (i) selection of competent contractors by \nthorough prequalification, (ii) engineering design based on sufficient \ngeological  investigations,  and  (iii)  adequate  quality  and  safety \nassurance.  The  financial  risks  associated  with  construction  and \noperation  of  the  expressway  will  depend  on  the  level  and \ncomposition of traffic, construction costs, ability of the commercial \nmanagement, and appropriate tolls. To mitigate the financial risks, \nWKEC  will  build  up  a  commercial  business  environment  for \noperations,  the  Project  will  receive  substantial  equity  from  the \nGovernment, and an appropriate toll structure will be adopted. The \nsocial risks include resettlement and HIV/AIDS infection. Appropriate \nmitigation measures are in place in the resettlement plan. HIV/AIDS \nissues  are  addressed  under  stand-alone  technical  assistance \nFighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific.  \n \nThe  preparation  team  worked  closely  with  YPCD  to  ensure  that \nmitigation measures are in place. YPCD has experience, and has \nshown  satisfactory  performance,  in  implementing  internationally \nfinanced projects. \n \n ", "Map 1\n98 o 00'E 108 o 00'E\nNorth-South\nCorridor Northern\nCorridor Guilin\nI N D I A\nMyitkyina Dali\nHexian\n24 o 00'N\nKunming\nChuxiong Wuzhou\nRuili Baise GUANGXI ZHUANG\n24 o 00'N Tamu Yuxi AUTONOMOUS REGION\nYUNNAN PROVINCE\nPEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\nHS Tonzang Muse Mengzi Yulin\nEDALGNA Chindwin R.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Central Yunnan Roads Development Project. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The PRC has made remarkable progress in economic growth and poverty reduction \nsince 1978. Its record of 30 years with more than 9% average annual growth has led millions of \npeople out of poverty. However, many people remain poor, and millions more have low incomes \nor  are  living  just  above  the  poverty  line.1 Moreover,  the  distribution  of  income  is  highly \nimbalanced between eastern coastal and interior provinces, and between urban and rural areas. \nPoverty is more widespread in the western region.2 Infrastructure bottlenecks and lack of access \nto outside markets are the major constraints on the reduction of poverty. Thus, developing \neconomic infrastructure in key corridors to connect the western and coastal regions is essential \nto promote trade and reduce regional development disparities in the long run. \n \n3.  Yunnan  is  the  sixth  largest  province  in  PRC.  It  is  located  on  the  most  southwest \nboundary of the PRC, neighboring Guizhou and Guangxi to the east, Chongqing and Sichuan in \nthe  north,  Tibet  Autonomous  Region  and  Myanmar  to  the  west,  and  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  and  Viet  Nam  to  the  south.  Yunnan  encompasses \n394,000 square kilometers and 94% of the total provincial area is covered by mountains and \nhills, with terrain ranging from tropical rainforest to high mountains. Yunnan has a population of \n44 million, of which 36% are minority nationalities. Its geographical, environmental, and cultural \ndiversity has made it an extremely popular tourist attraction.  \n \n4.  Like other parts of the PRC, Yunnan\u2019s economy has grown rapidly. Nevertheless, it still \nlags the coastal provinces and the country as a whole. Yunnan is one of the least-developed \nprovinces, with a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita ranked 29th among all the provinces, \nahead of only Guizhou and Gansu. GDP per capita in 2006 was about 56% of the national \naverage. The lack of an efficient and effective transport system is an important constraint for the \nsustainable  growth  of  Yunnan.  The  proposed  Project  forms  the  last  missing  link  in  the \nChengdu\u2013Kunming corridor connecting two growth centers\u2014Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, \nand  Kunming,  the  capital  of  Yunnan  Province\u2014in  southwestern  PRC.  Together,  the  two \nprovinces (Yunnan and Sichuan) have a population of 126 million, about 10% of the country\u2019s \ntotal.  Support  for  developing  the  proposed  corridor  will  extend  the  benefits  of  increased \naccessibility to the western region, where average incomes are the lowest in the PRC. \n \n5.  More than 90% of the poor in the PRC live in rural areas. Roads are usually the only \nmode of transport that can help the poor reach markets and services. Recognizing the role of \nrural roads in reducing poverty, the Government has accelerated rural road improvement to \n                                                 \n1  The World Bank recently published a revision of the PRC\u2019s purchasing power parity (PPP) estimates. These \nrevised estimates decrease the estimated size of the PRC economy in PPP terms, but do not significantly change \nreal economic growth rates. The World Bank predicts that, under its new PPP estimates, the PRC\u2019s $1 per day \n(PPP) poverty rate will go up modestly. See World Bank. Quarterly Update February 2008.

Manila.  \n ", "2 \nclose the development gap between urban and rural areas.3 During the 10th Five-Year Plan \n(FYP) 2001\u20132005, investment in rural roads totaled CNY418 billion, three times that in the \nprevious 5 years. In accordance with the Rural Road Construction Program approved by the \nState Council in February 2005, improvement of rural roads will be carried out nationwide within \nthe next 20 years. In the 11th FYP 2006\u20132010, CNY100 billion of central government funding is \nallocated  for  new  rural  road  projects  and  CNY40  billion  for  the  accessibility  program, \nrepresenting  18%  of  the  total  budget  of  CNY800  billion.  By  2010,  it  is  expected  that  all \ntownships in the western region will be accessible to a paved road network. \n \n6.  The Yunnan Rural Road 11th FYP is to construct and upgrade 53,300 kilometers (km) of \na  rural  road  accessibility  program.  To  achieve  this,  Yunnan  Provincial  Communications \nDepartment (YPCD) envisages investment in rural roads to reach about CNY16.8 billion from \n2006  to  2010.  Of  this,  the  Ministry  of  Communications  (MOC)  will  provide  CNY9 billion, \nrepresenting 54% of the total investment; YPCD will provide CNY3.5 billion, 21% of the total; \nand the remainder will be raised by lower levels of government. The overall objective is to \nprovide paved roads to all the townships by 2010, and paved roads to all the administrative \nvillages by 2020. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Challenges \n \n7.  Despite rapid economic growth, the PRC has suffered from imbalanced growth among \nthe provinces. In 2006, the GDP per capita of the western provinces was about half of the \nnational average and only one third of that in the eastern coastal region. The road network still \ndoes not provide adequate access to the poorer inland region; vast distances and difficult \nmountainous terrain isolate it from local, regional, and national markets. Most exports and \nimports  reach  major  markets  through  other  provinces,  meaning  that  regional  transport \ndevelopment is an important determinant of growth and development.  \n \n8.  Yunnan has made significant progress in poverty reduction since the 1980s as a result \nof economic growth and concentrated development efforts. Nevertheless, it remains one of the \nmost underdeveloped regions in the PRC. Currently, Yunnan has 73 national poverty-stricken \ncounties, accounting for 45% of the total counties in the province. Yunnan has a population of \n44 million, of which 84% are rural. Annual per capita rural income was CNY2,250 in 2006, which \nis one of the lowest levels in the PRC. More than 6.7 million people are poor, defined as living \nbelow the Government low-income line of CNY958 per capita per year (which is below the \ninternational poverty line of $1 per person per day). Rural poverty incidence in Yunnan is 20%. \n \n9.  Road transportation is the main mode in Yunnan\u2019s transportation system. In 2006, road \ntraffic in Yunnan accounted for 79% of total passenger traffic in passenger kilometers (km) and \n60% of total freight traffic in ton-kms. From 1990 to 2006, road passenger traffic grew by 9.3% \nand  freight  traffic  increased  by  6.3%  annually.  However,  road  infrastructure  is  still \nunderdeveloped. Based on MOC\u2019s statistical yearbook, class II and above roads comprised 3% \nof all roads in 2006, significantly lower than the national average (10% of the road network). \nUnclassified roads comprised 50% of the road network in 2006, much higher than the national \naverage (34% of the road network). Less than 17% of the total road length in the province was \npaved;  the remaining  83%  (165,425  km)  was  unpaved,  although  14,000 km  of this  had  a \nmacadam (stone-set) surface. Of the total 13,198 administrative villages, about 50% did not \n                                                 \n3  In 2007, the annual per capita net income of rural households was CNY4,140 ($591), while the annual per capita \ndisposable  income  of  urban  households  was  CNY13,786  ($1,969).  Engel  coefficients  in  rural  and  urban \nhouseholds were 43.1% and 36.3%, respectively. \n ", "3 \nhave all-weather road access at the end of 2006. Poor roads have led to inadequate and costly \ntransport services in Yunnan. About 6,500 administrative villages have no direct access to \nlicensed bus services as bus operators are unwilling to use poor roads because of high costs \nand danger. Transport demand is usually met by various informal transport services such as \nbicycles,  dual-purpose  pickups,  and  agricultural  tractors.  During  the  11th  FYP  2006\u20132010, \nYPCD formulated plans to provide sealed roads and organized bus services to all townships. \n \n10.  The project area includes one district and four counties, of which two are nationally \ndesignated poverty counties.4 About 25% of rural residents are poor and the highest rural \npoverty incidence is 37% in Wuding County. Furthermore, because of mountainous terrain, \nmost of the rural population is scattered in 6,996 natural villages that lack basic infrastructure, \nespecially  roads.  Poor  roads  and  associated  high  transportation  costs  are  a  significant \nconstraint to promoting higher value cash crops. The project preparation survey revealed that \nvillagers are aware of the clear linkages between road access and poverty. The villages along \nthe road plant vegetables and fruits, and it is easier for them to transport to Kunming market, \nwhile remote villages mainly plant potatoes and corn. Without good access to markets, villages \nare unable to integrate into the market economy, their income level remains low, and economic \ngrowth is not achievable or sustainable. The counties with the greatest accessibility problems \nalso  have  limited  financial  resources,  so  they  need  the  most  support  from  national  and \nprovincial governments. An important aim of the Project is to reach out to the poor remote \nvillages through improved rural transport and associated services. \n \n11.  The  PRC  faces  great  challenges  in  road  safety.  During  2000\u20132005,  around \n600,000 people were killed and over 3 million injured in road traffic accidents in the PRC, \nequivalent to 1 fatality every 5 minutes. These had serious social and economic implications. It \nis estimated that road accidents in the PRC have impacted on the lives of more than 20 million \npeople, either as victims of accidents or as family members of those involved in the accidents. A \nroad accident can take a family from self-sufficiency to poverty especially if the victim is the \nfamily\u2019s main breadwinner, as it is often the case. The Government is committed to improving \nroad safety. It created a 17-ministry committee5 under the State Council and introduced the first \nRoad Traffic Safety Law in the PRC, which took effect on 1 May 2004. Since then, MOC has \nbeen implementing the National Highway Safety Enhancement Project, aiming to eliminate road \nsafety risks and save lives on national highways. The road safety situation had improved \nsteadily but it remains challenging as the level of motorization increases. Road safety risks on \nlow-grade roads remains severe because most of them were built at a time when few resources \nwere used for road safety facilities. In the project area, safety is of great concern to villagers. \nComments received during field surveys centered on the need to install \u201cGo Slow\u201d signs at the \nentrance to villages located along national highway (NH) 108. Other concerns were that poor \nroad conditions undermined safety, such as roads with sharp turns, steep grades, and poor line \nof sight. Good practice and policies must be in place at present in order to reduce the number of \nfatalities and injuries on the roads before vehicle fleet expand.  \n \n12.  National highway (NH) 108, which runs parallel to the project expressway, is mainly \ncomposed of class II roads with insufficient shoulders, poor alignment, and limited capacity. It \nwas congested at peak hours, with average daily traffic of about 6,000 vehicles in 2005. The \naverage travel speed is less than 40 km per hour. Traffic congestion is growing and will exceed \nthe road\u2019s capacity by 2012, and several sections are already approaching their capacity. The \nroad is dangerous as it has many road side frictions caused by the high incidence of slow-\n                                                 \n4  The project area is defined as Wuhua district; and Fumin, Wuding, Luquan, and Lufeng counties (Map 3). \n5  The committee includes MOC, Ministry of Public Security, National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry \nof Construction, Ministry of Agriculture, National Quality Control Bureau, and National Safety Bureau.  \n ", "4 \nmoving traffic and substantial ribbon development on most of its length. The Project will help to \nease severe congestion, reduce accidents and traffic-induced air pollution in the corridor. \n \n  2.  Government and Asian Development Bank Strategies \n \n13.  The  Government\u2019s  11th  FYP,  2006\u20132010,  concentrates  on  an  all-inclusive  and \nsustainable growth strategy, with increased focus on environmental protection, and a strong \ncommitment to raising living standards in rural areas, especially in western provinces. The \nGovernment pledges to promote a \u201charmonious society\u201d by raising public spending on rural \ninfrastructure and services in the west. Road development is one of the priorities of the 11th FYP \nfor developing the service sector and reducing poverty; it is also important for integrating the \ndomestic economy and balancing regional development. To reduce regional disparities, the \nGovernment aims to link the western region with central and eastern regions, provide western \nregion access to trade outlets at sea and land ports, and promote regional cooperation with \nneighboring countries. \n \n14.  The strategy for the PRC road sector of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) gives high \npriority to removing infrastructure constraints, and supporting policy and institutional reforms. \nADB supports (i) financing new roads that connect major growth centers, supported by a system \nof local roads; (ii) developing and improving urban transport and rural roads; (iii) promoting road \nsafety, cutting vehicle emissions, and raising energy efficiency; (iv) improving the commercial \norientation  and  efficiency  of  expressway  organizations;  and  (v)  strengthening  regional \ncooperation in transport. ADB assistance for roads targets the poor western provinces and \nregional economic corridors. The Project is consistent with PRC development priorities and ADB \nstrategy. The road sector policy reform matrix is in Appendix 2. \n \n  3.  Opportunities \n \n15.  Yunnan  has  great  potential  to  foster  sustainable  economic  growth  and  social \ndevelopment. The Government is committed to the development of transportation to strengthen \nits competitiveness of west region and regional integration. The provincial social and economic \ndevelopment plan for the 11th FYP emphasized the development of infrastructure and further \nreform and opening up to improve people\u2019s living standard. Some targets have been set for the \nprovince, e.g., GDP will grow at 8.5% annually on average; energy consumption will decrease \nby 12% by the end of 2010 compared with 2005; disposable income of urban residents and pure \nincome of rural residents will increase by 6% annually. The 11th FYP of YPCD has brought it \nforward,  and  underlined  the  need  for  (i) improved  high-grade  access  to  key  cities  and \ninternational ports; (ii) improved local road access to markets and services; and (iii) improved \nroad operation and maintenance, safety, and transport services.  \n \n16.  Over the past 15 years, transportation has been improved to strengthen economic and \ntrade cooperation among Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS)6 countries. However, more needs \nto be done to reach poor areas and link rural residents with growth centers and neighboring \ncountries. Because of its geographic location, Yunnan has advantages in border trade with \nGMS countries. The Wuding\u2013Kunming Expressway is an important section of the Chengdu \n(Sichuan)  to  Kunming  (Yunnan)  national  high-priority  western  development  corridor.  It  will \nsupport three GMS corridors: (i) North\u2013South Economic Corridor to Bangkok (via northern Lao \nPDR), (ii) Eastern Corridor to Ha Noi/Hai Phong in Viet Nam, and (iii) Northern Corridor to \nNanning/Fangcheng in Guangxi (Map 1).  \n \n                                                 \n6  The GMS comprises Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, and PRC. With ADB assistance, the six \nmember countries launched the GMS Program in 1992. \n ", "5 \n17.  ADB  has  provided  support  in  financing  three  transport  projects7 in  the  Chengdu\u2013\nKunming\u2013Hai Phong corridor to spread economic and social benefits to the poor region (Map 2). \nBy  2012,  when  the  Chengdu\u2013Kunming  and  Kunming\u2013Hai  Phong  Transport  Corridor  is \ncompleted, cars, buses, and trucks will be able to speed people and goods between northern \nViet Nam and southern PRC, opening the prospect of a significant new economic development \nzone in Asia. The corridor, one of the strategic transport corridors that integrate the economies \nof northern Viet Nam with southwest PRC, is seen by the PRC and Viet Nam governments as a \nvital  spur  to  the  region\u2019s  growth,  lifting  the  pace  of  development.  The  corridor  will  help \nimplement Viet Nam\u2019s socioeconomic development plan in its poor northern provinces. It will \nalso assist PRC in carrying out its strategy to \"open up\" the west.  \n \n18.  Yunnan Province abounds in natural resources. It has over 600 rivers and lakes that \nprovide  an  annual  water  supply  of  200  billion  cubic  meters,  as  well  as  abundant  mineral \nresources. Yunnan\u2019s reserves of aluminum, lead, zinc, and tin are the largest in PRC. There are \nalso major reserves of copper and nickel. The province is also famous as the kingdom of \nanimals and plants. It is a major tourist attraction both for domestic and international visitors.8 \nOver the years, the economic structure of Yunnan Province has significantly improved with rapid \ngrowth. In 1990, primary industry accounted for 43% of Yunnan\u2019s GDP, but by 2006 this had \nfallen to 19%. Secondary industry accounted for 43% of GDP in 2006, more than the level of \n40% in 1990. Tertiary industry contributed 38% of GDP in 2006 compared with only 17% in \n1990.  Agriculture  has  been  experiencing  a  gradual  evolution  from  subsistence  farming  to \ncommercial production. Yunnan\u2019s five pillar industries are tourism; foodstuffs (tobacco, sugar, \nand tea); development of bio-resources; mining; and hydroelectric industry. Horticulture, natural \nmedicines, biotechnology, and cash crops have become new economic growth points. Improved \ntransport infrastructure will be a catalyst for investment in the project area. It will increase the \nproduction  and  export  of  mineral  products,  reduce  the  transport  cost  for  cash  crops,  and \npromote tourism.  \n \n19.  External assistance to the PRC road sector has come mainly from ADB, Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation, and World Bank. Since 1991, ADB has extended 37 loans totaling \n$7.5 billion  to  finance  5,206  km  of  expressways  and  11,004  km  of  associated  local  road \nnetworks. Project completion reports prepared for 20 road projects conclude that 19 were \n\u201chighly successful\u201d or \u201cgenerally successful\u201d and 1 \u201cpartly successful\u201d.9 ADB has also supplied \n68 technical assistance (TA) projects totaling $36.6 million to the road sector. The advisory TA \nprojects have addressed policy and institutional issues, including highway planning, road safety, \nsocioeconomic  assessment,  transport  pricing,  and  mobilization  of  nongovernment  financial \nresources. The World Bank has provided about $7.1 billion and the Japan Bank for International \nCooperation about \u00a5219 billion to finance road investments (Appendix 3). ADB coordinates with \nthese  organizations  to  ensure  that  each  major  development  partner  focuses  on  different \ncorridors, and information related to policy advice is shared across the development community. \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2002.

Tourism income reached CNY50 billion or 12.5% of the total \nprovincial GDP in 2006. \n9  The \u201cpartly successful\u201d rating is mainly due to inadequate safety facilities and enforcement. Remedial actions were \ntaken to rectify the issues. The Project was subsequently rated \u201csuccessful\u201d in the project performance audit report. \n ", "6 \n4.  Lessons \n \n20.  The evaluation of ADB assistance for roads and railways in the PRC10 concludes that \nADB\u2019s program for roads was successful overall, and ADB has the potential to formulate new \nfocus and priorities to continue playing a significant role in the road sector. Under the Project, \nADB  formulated  the  following  new  foci  at  the  project  level:  (i)  increasing  private  sector \nparticipation in investment, provision of services, and operations; (ii) greater involvement in road \nsafety  issues;  (iii)  improving  axle  load  enforcement;  (iv)  improving  vehicle  emissions;  and \n(v) rationalizing and reforming transport services. \n \n21.  YPCD has experience in implementing internationally financed projects without major \nproblems. Of the three ADB financed road projects, two have been completed, and one is under \nimplementation. The two completed projects were rated \u201chighly successful\u201d11 and \u201csuccessful\u201d 12 \nrespectively. Lessons from previous road projects in Yunnan and elsewhere in the PRC suggest \nthe need for, among others, (i) adequate and timely funding for land acquisition and resettlement, \nand closer supervision of its implementation; (ii) conducting sufficient geological investigations for \nprojects located in difficult, mountainous terrain to ensure assessment of designs and costs; \n(iii) formulating a well-prepared design and monitoring framework with baseline and target values \nestablished at the outset of the project; (iv) strengthening local communications bureaus for road \nmaintenance; (v) integrating the local road component into expressway development to enhance \nthe  poverty  impact;  and  (vi)  separating  expressway  construction  and  operations  from  the \nprovincial government function to improve corporate governance. \n \n22.  These lessons guided the design of the Project. Under the proposed Project, YPCD has \nagreed to (i) provide more attention and resources to land acquisition and resettlement and \ncloser supervision of its implementation; (ii) ensure that supplemental geological investigations \nwill be carried out during the detailed design stage, especially in the tunnel and bridge portions \nof the proposed highway; (iii) contribute, in a more proactive manner, to a design and monitoring \nframework with baseline and target values; and (iv) implement the new provincial rural road \nmaintenance reform. Due attention has been given to the local road improvement component to \nensure its timely implementation. The project company will be the implementing agency to \nimplement the project expressway.  \n \n5.  Policy Dialogue \n \n23.  Developing  an  Integrated  Corporatization  Approach. The dialogue on institutional \narrangements with YPCD helped raise awareness of the importance of developing an integrated \ncorporatization approach. In May 2006, a separate corporate entity, Yunnan Provincial Highway \nDevelopment and Investment Company Limited (YHIC) was established by Yunnan Provincial \nGovernment (YPG). YHIC was incorporated under the new Company Law of the PRC with initial \nequity capital of CNY5 billion, legally separated from YPCD. The primary objective of YHIC is to \nconstruct, develop, maintain, and operate toll roads in Yunnan. YPG authorized YHIC rights to \n(i) collect tolls from road users; (ii) retain toll and non-toll revenue in the business; (iii) maintain \nfull financial accounts of its assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses; and (iv) engage in \ndeveloping and operating other infrastructure projects such as toll roads, bridges, tunnels, and \nancillary facilities along toll roads. The establishment of YHIC opened the way for diversified \nfinancing, as it can tap possible capital markets and invite private equity investment in YHIC. \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2007.

YPG  plans  to  construct  and  upgrade \napproximately 800 km of expressways at the estimated cost of CNY40 billion, according to the \n11th FYP. YPG has been exploring options to finance part of the investment requirements from \nprivate sources because of limited public financing. Establishment of YHIC in 2006 facilitated \nprivate sector participation on a strategic basis. YHIC has since been making extensive efforts \nto engage the private sector and is now in the process of engaging strategic investors for the \nKunming\u2013Shilin expressway. YHIC will explore various options with potential private investors in \nclose consultation with ADB. At least 6 months prior to the opening of the project expressway, \nYHIC will analyze the feasibility of accessing financing from financial markets for future road \nsector investments, and possible private sector participation in operation and maintenance \n(O&M) of the project expressway. It will report its conclusions to ADB. \n \n25.  Supporting  Asset-Backed  Securitization  Initiative.  ADB  has  been  exploring \nalternative ways for funding expressway projects, particularly in western regions of the PRC, to \nprovide additional options for provincial governments. YPCD and YHIC showed a strong interest \nin  pursuing  a  proposal  for  ADB  to  facilitate  private  sector  funding.  One  option  is  through \nissuance of asset-backed securities (ABS) against future net toll revenues,13 with the possible \nbacking of an ADB partial credit guarantee. ADB has financed three toll road projects in Yunnan, \ntwo of which are completed and operational. These projects are generating toll revenues, which \ncan  serve  as  collateral  for  YHIC  to  issue  ABS  to  private  investors  to  finance  future  road \ninvestments in Yunnan. Structured finance, such as ABS against future net toll revenues, is an \nefficient alternative for infrastructure finance. ABS will be a useful tool for YHIC to raise long-\nterm  financing  efficiently  from  the  capital  market,  and  correspondingly  streamline  the  debt \nstructure  to  reduce  funding  requirements  from  banks.  It will  also  be  a  good  fixed  income \ninvestment  tool  for  institutional  investors  in  the  capital  market,  and  its  development  will \ncontribute to overall balanced development of capital markets in the PRC. In the long run, it will \nbe beneficial to the development of local authority capacity to finance infrastructure, and to the \ndevelopment of ABS market.  \n \n26.  China  Securities  Regulatory  Commission  (CSRC)  piloted  10  ABS  issuances  raising \nCNY26 billion under the collective asset management plan structure since August 2005. There \nhave  been  no  new  ABS  issuances  after  September  2006.  To  expand  the  scope  of  the \nregulations and establish a well-structured legal framework, some fundamental issues remain to \nbe addressed. Specifically, any future legislation will need to address the issues of true sale and \nbankruptcy-remote status. CSRC considers future toll road projects in Yunnan good candidates \nfor pilot testing, and ADB involvement will have demonstration effects to push forward legal and \nregulatory reforms. The major challenges are (i) fragmented regulatory authorities;14 (ii) lack of \nthe bankruptcy-remote status of a special purpose vehicle to the overall structuring of an asset-\nsecuritization transaction; (iii) no agreed timetable given by CSRC for relaunching the ABS \nproducts; (iv) a more volatile stock market; (v) a small investor base for such instruments, and \nregulatory  restrictions  on  some  institutional  investors  (e.g.,  insurance  companies)  for  ABS \ninvestments; and (vi) the need to restructure YHIC\u2019s existing debts to free up cash flows and \npledged collaterals. \n27.  For the potential ABS transaction, external credit enhancement options15 should be \nconsidered to achieve the maximum support for the transaction\u2019s objectives. For external credit \nenhancement, ADB has a unique advantage to provide a partial credit guarantee to attract \n                                                 \n13  Net revenues arrived at after meeting debt servicing, O&M costs, dividends, and necessary periodic capital costs. \n14  Since 2005, there have been two major types of securitization transactions in the PRC, all on an experimental \nbasis, carried out under the supervision of two sets of regulatory authorities: (i) CSRC, and (ii) People\u2019s Bank of \nChina (PBOC) and China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC).  \n15  This refers to credit support provided to a securitization from a third party, \u201cexternal\u201d to the transaction, in a manner \nsuch that the credit rating of the securitization is enhanced. \n ", "8 \ninstitutional investors. Moreover, ADB has been assisting the central bank, People\u2019s Bank of \nChina (PBOC), and legislators to improve the legal framework.16 A small-scale TA project17 has \nbeen developed to support the ABS initiative in Yunnan to (i) study and prepare the suggested \nprivate sector financing through an ABS proposal with ADB\u2019s partial credit guarantee, (ii) review \nthe legal and regulatory framework, and (iii) help structure the appropriate financing instrument \nfor  CSRC  consideration.  YHIC  is  committed  to  (i) pursuing  this  financing  scheme  for  the \nconstruction of future roads; and (ii) coordinating with relevant government agencies to facilitate \nthe structuring process, including domestic approval procedures. \n \n6.  Rationale for ADB Support \n \n28.  Constraints and Opportunities. Rural poverty incidence is high in the project area. \nRoads and transport services are underdeveloped, which is a major constraint on poverty \nreduction. The existing national highway is poor, dangerous, and congested and winds through \ntowns, creating high transport costs for producers and consumers. This transport bottleneck \nneeds to be removed to facilitate moving goods and people between rural and urban areas, and \nbetween Yunnan and neighboring provinces. At the national level, the Project will contribute to \nattain the full benefits of network integration by connecting two growth centers (Kunming and \nChengdu) in southwest PRC. At the regional level, the Project was identified as a high priority \nproject under the GMS Transport Sector Strategy,18 endorsed by the six GMS governments in \nVientiane, Lao PDR in 2006. It will support three GMS transport corridors (para. 16) and was \nincluded as a loan project for 2008 in ADB\u2019s GMS regional cooperation operations business \nplan  (2008\u20132010).19 The  Project  helps  operationalize  the  strategic  thrust  for  strengthening \nconnectivity and facilitating cross-border movement and tourism with Viet Nam under ADB\u2019s \nregional cooperation strategy and program for the GMS.20 \n  \n29.  Value Added by ADB. Over the past 15 years, ADB has become Yunnan Province\u2019s \nlong-term development partner. YPG has requested the continued support of ADB to help it \ndevelop vital transport infrastructure while strengthening its relevant institutions. In addition to \nfinancing, ADB involvement will contribute to (i) institutional strengthening activities to promote \nsound corporate governance and private sector participation, (ii) continued strengthening of \nYPCD to manage the road network effectively, and (iii) management of sector externalities \n(safety, environment, and social safeguard issues). ADB also contributed to the integrated \ndesign of the Project by working closely with YPCD and Yunnan Provincial Public Security \nDepartment (YPSD) on the design of local road safety enhancement, which will be an integral \npart of the Project. Overall, ADB\u2019s involvement accelerates institutional and policy reforms to \nprivate sector participation and road safety enhancement. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n30.  The  impact  of  the  Project  is  a  well-functioning  integrated  road  transport  system  in \nYunnan Province and the rest of the GMS. This will be achieved by developing an efficient, safe, \nand environmentally sustainable regional transport system to facilitate the movement of goods \nand people within Yunnan, and between the PRC and GMS countries. \n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2005.

Strengthening  of  the  technical  and  management  capacity  of \nYPCD, its related agencies, and Wukun Expressway Company Limited (WKEC). \n \nC.  Special Features \n32.  Enhancing Road Safety. Road safety is a serious issue in the PRC, including Yunnan. \nIn 2006, there were 378,781 traffic accidents with 89,455 fatalities and 431,139 injuries. The \nPRC recorded 6.2 road accident fatalities per 10,000 vehicles in 2006, much higher than the \ndeveloped countries (1-2 deaths per 10,000 vehicles). Ministry of Public Security, MOC, National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission, Ministry of Construction, and Ministry of Agriculture are \nthe key road safety related agencies in the PRC. In the past, lack of cooperation and discussion \nbetween ministries hampered efficient road safety improvement. The Government established \nthe first national interministerial road safety committee in 2003. The first Road Traffic Safety \nLaw in the PRC took effect on 1 May 2004. The Government is paying growing attention to road \nsafety and formulated a National Science and Technology Action Plan for Road Safety on \n20 February  2008.  The  action  plan  set  measurable  targets  to  reduce  the  number  of  road \nfatalities, severe road accidents, and the rate of fatalities per 10,000 motor vehicles to levels in \nother  middle-income  countries.  The  action  plan  will  be  implemented  jointly  by  Ministry  of \nScience and Technology, Ministry of Public Security, and MOC. Dedicated resources will be \nallocated to implement the action plan. \n \n33.  There were 5,425 traffic accidents, 2,323 fatalities, and 6,248 injuries in Yunnan Province \nin 2007. Yunnan recorded 7.2 road accident fatalities per 10,000 motor vehicles in 2006, higher \nthan the national average of 6.2. The main reasons cited for road traffic accidents in Yunnan are \nimproper driving, poor road safety facilities, inadequate traffic management, poor road safety \nbehavior of road users, and vehicle mechanical failures. Careful analysis of all road accidents \nhas shown that accidents are often the result of a combination of several factors, rather than a \nsingle main cause. Therefore, it is vital to enhance safety facilities and establish better road \nmanagement system. YPG recognizes the urgency of this issue and is willing to work with ADB \nto formulate solutions. A road safety interagency committee will be established in Yunnan to \nfacilitate the project implementation. \n \n34.  ADB is committed to increasing its attention and expanding its role to road traffic safety. \nA Local Road Safety Enhancement Program (the Program) has been integrated to the Project.  \nThe Program will: (i) formulate a local road traffic safety strategy, (ii) strengthen interagency \ncollaboration and partnership, (iii) include road safety audits in road building and upgrading \nprojects, (iv) formulate low-cost safety remedial measures and design, (v) improve hazardous \nspots  on  existing  local  roads,  and  (vi)  conduct  training.  The  total  cost  of  the  Program  is \nestimated at CNY106 million, of which 40% ($6 million) will be financed by ADB.21 This is the \nfirst ADB loan to assess and address the local road safety issues in PRC. It aims to establish an \nefficient and sustainable mechanism for managing road safety. The findings will be used to \n                                                 \n21  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Road Safety Improvement. Manila. \n ", "10 \ndevelop policy and strategies to reduce road traffic accidents on local roads. The sponsorship \nand support from ADB are highly appreciated by the government and local people in Yunnan. \nFurther details on local road safety enhancement program are in Appendix 4.  \n \n35.  Introducing  Weight-Based  Tolls. In May 2004, an interministerial committee22 was \nestablished to develop and implement special measures to enforce regulations nationwide on \noverloaded trucks, including putting in place axle load limits on the roads. To control overloaded \nvehicles, YPCD will implement weight-based tolls before opening the project expressway. The \nprinciple behind weight-based tolling is that goods-carrying vehicles pay a rate per ton-km \nbased on the weight class of the vehicle plus a penalty rate per excess tonnage. Experiences \nfrom other provinces show that this is an effective way to manage overloaded vehicles if \ncomplemented with rigorous control measures. For example, after introducing weight-based \ntolls, overloaded vehicles were reduced from 40% to 17% in Shandong Province. \n \n36.  Improving Rural Road Maintenance. Adequate maintenance is crucial to ensure the \nsustainability of rural roads. There have been problems with rural road maintenance resulting \nfrom underfunding of maintenance activities, inadequate engineering standards, inappropriate \ndesign, and poor axle load control. To improve rural road maintenance, the State Council issued \na new policy for financing and management of rural road maintenance in October 2005. In July \n2007, YPG issued a Rural Road Maintenance Policy Reform Announcement. In line with this \npolicy,  YPG  established  an  annual  subsidy  mechanism  for  rural  road  maintenance  of \nCNY7,000/km for county roads, CNY3,500/km for township roads, and CNY1,000/km for village \nroads. YPCD has implemented the new policy since 1 January 2008. Given the asset base size \nof Yunnan rural road network, substantial benefits will be obtained from a more scientific and \ncost-effective approach to road maintenance expenditure allocation, including the prioritization \nof works and the evaluation of alternative interventions based on a life-cycle analysis of costs \nand benefits. The Project will provide training on operating the Highway Development and \nManagement  (HDM-IV)  system  to  enhance  YPCD  and  its  local  communications  bureaus\u2019 \ncapacity of maintenance planning and prioritization (Appendix 5).  \n \n37.  Promoting Rural Transport Services. Poor road condition is a key factor restraining \nroad transport services development. Road transport authorities tend not to issue bus route \nlicenses on unclassified roads. To serve the needs of the majority of rural residents, Yunnan \nTransport  Administration  Bureau  agreed  to  organize  safety  inspection  and  management, \ntogether with traffic police and road administration agencies, to carry out field surveys on \nunclassified roads to determine the possibility of service. Passenger transport vehicles will be \nallowed to provide service on unclassified roads after comprehensive evaluation and approval, \nand  with  special  administrative  dispensation.  Variations  in  demand  and  different  types  of \noperation will also be considered. This will allow some flexibility for operators to adjust their \nservices in line with passenger needs, and use their vehicles and drivers more productively. \nSome of the recommendations of ADB\u2019s Sustainable Rural Transport Services TA23 will be \nadopted in the project area (Appendix 5). \n \n38.  Controlling  Vehicle  Emissions.  The  Government  has  pledged  to  lower  energy \nconsumption per unit of GDP by 20% and cut emissions of major pollutants by 10% during the \n11th  FYP  (2006-2010).  It  has  taken  several  steps  to  control  emissions\u2014expanding  public \ntransportation, imposing regulations on the automobile industry, requiring an annual vehicle test, \n                                                 \n22The  interministerial  committee  is  coordinated  by  MOC  and  includes  Ministry  of  Public  Security,  National   \nDevelopment and Reform Commission, National Quality Control Bureau, National Safety Bureau, National Industry \nand Commerce Bureau, and the State Council\u2019s Law and Regulation Office. \n23 ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Sustainable Rural Transport Services. \nManila (TA 4806-PRC). \n ", "11 \nand improving the vehicle inspection and maintenance program. The new measures included \nusing taxation policies as a tool to achieve its energy efficiency goals, such as raising taxes on \nbig cars, 24 and offering tax incentives for manufacturers of more environment-friendly cars. \nYunnan follows national vehicle emission control strategies. By 2012, before the project road \nopens, Yunnan is expected to have adopted stricter emission standards for both new and used \nvehicles. The Project will significantly contribute to control of vehicle emissions because it offers \nbetter road roughness value, lower congestion, and more efficient operation. In the first year of \nthe project operation, fuel savings are expected to be 25% lower than without the Project. The \nStrategic Vehicle Emission Reduction Plan is in Appendix 6. \n \n39.  Regional Cooperation and Integration. Yunnan Province is strategically located in the \nPRC\u2019s southern border with the other GMS countries. Kunming is recognized as the northern \nterminal  of  the  three  GMS  corridors  (Map  1).  To  facilitate  trade  with  GMS  countries,  an \nexpressway link is being developed between Kunming and Hekou, the border town with Viet Nam. \nThe first section between Kunming and Shilin is under operation while Shilin to Mengzi is under \npreparation and Mengzi to Hekou being constructed. On the Viet Nam side, Lao Cai (border \nprovince with Yunnan)\u2013Ha Noi are being developed as highway with ADB support (Map 2). The \nProject, which starts in Kunming and extends northward to Chengdu via Wuding, is envisaged to \nserve as an important trade link between the PRC and other GMS countries by 2015. \n \n40.  Trade volume between the PRC and Viet Nam has increased dramatically with annual \nincreases of 25% in volume and 30% in value recorded in recent years. In 2005, the PRC was \nViet Nam\u2019s second largest trading partner. Hekou has handled the largest volume of cross-\nborder trade in Yunnan since 2003. The annual trade volume in Hekou reached 2.3 million tons \nin 2007\u20141.69 million tons by road and 0.57 million tons by rail\u2014with a value of $1.1 billion, and \nit has potential to grow in the foreseeable future. The main commodities carried by road are \nagricultural products, machinery, and mining equipment. Imports from Viet Nam have increased \nfaster than exports.  \n \n41.  To help reduce nonphysical barriers to the cross-border movement of goods and people \nalong GMS road corridors, ADB has been supporting implementation of the GMS Cross-Border \nTransport Agreement (CBTA). The CBTA is a multilateral instrument for facilitation of the cross- \nborder  transport  of  goods  and  people.  Leaders  from  the  six  GMS  countries  committed  to \nexpedite implementation of the CBTA at their third GMS Summit held in Vientiane, Lao PDR on \n30\u201331 March 2008. Subsequently, some GMS governments, including the PRC and Viet Nam \nratified the 20 implementing annexes of the CBTA, thus providing the legal basis for the CBTA\u2019s \nfull implementation. Pilot implementation of the CBTA has also taken place at some of the \nborder crossing points, including the Hekou\u2013Lao Cai border crossing along the GMS Eastern \nCorridor (Map 1). With the ratification of the CBTA\u2019s implementing annexes by the PRC and Viet \nNam, the ministries of transport of the two countries are discussing the expansion of the current \nlimited exchange of traffic rights arrangements25 governed by an existing bilateral road transport \nagreement, to cover the entire corridor from Kunming to Ha Noi and further to Hai Phong. \nFurther details on regional cooperation in the GMS are in Appendix 7. \n \n42.  Intelligent Transport System. An intelligent transport system  (ITS)26 on expressways \nis being introduced in accordance with the national ITS architecture prepared by the National \n                                                 \n24 Effective 1 September 2008, owners of vehicles with engines above 4-liter will pay 40% tax (double the previous \ntax rate). The tax for vehicles with engines between 3-4 liters will be up from 15%-25%.  \n25 Starting in November 2006, PRC trucks can be operated beyond the border into Viet Nam\u2019s northern Province, and \nVietnamese trucks are allowed to operate in Hekou County under a bilateral road transport agreement. \n26  The application of information technology to transport is referred to as ITS, which provides the ability to gather, \norganize, analyze, use, and share information about transport systems and their efficient use. \n ", "12 \nITS Center. Yunnan has built up some of the ITS capacities under previous projects. The ITS \napplications were discussed and it was recommended that YPCD considers inclusion of the \nfollowing  features  in  the  design  of  electrical  and  mechanical  work:  (i)  traveler  information \nservices  to  facilitate  traveler  decision  making  before  and  during  a  trip,  and  (ii)  traffic \nmanagement service to manage traffic flow and safety on project expressway. \n \n43.  Two specific proposals will be implemented under the Project: (i) developing electronic \ntoll collection services to allow automatic electronic payment of tolls and fees on the expressway, \nsuch as allowing road users to use their integrated circuit cards or saving cards to pay the toll; \nand  (ii)  enhancing  safety  measures  including  an  emergency  phone  and  video  monitoring \nthroughout  the  whole  section.  To  enhance  safety,  the  following  measures  will  be  put  into \nservice: (i) lighting transition adjusted with daylight in tunnel; (ii) incident detection via closed \ncircuit television with full tunnel coverage; (iii) fire detection using video, sensors, fire alarms, \netc.; (iv) communication with users via loudspeakers, variable message sign, and lane signals; \nand (v) an emergency response system. It was agreed that use of the ITS be built into the \nProject through procurement of electrical and mechanical work. \n \n44.  Technical Assistance. Two TA projects are being implemented on a stand-alone basis \nin conjunction with the Project. A HIV/AIDS Prevention TA for the Transport Sector financed \nunder  a  regional  TA27 will  help  create  awareness  among  construction  workers  and  local \nresidents on HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases, as well as strengthening YPCD\u2019s \nability to execute efficient disease prevention programs on its projects. A small-scale TA, on \nAsset-Backed Securitization for Expressway Financing and Corporate Debt Restructuring in \nYunnan Province (footnote 17), will help to broaden long-term financing sources through wider \nselection of fixed-income investment tools for YPG to tap into capital markets. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n45.  The  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $745  million,  including  taxes  and \ncontingencies (Table 1).

The Government has requested a loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 4 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. The \nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The ADB loan will finance 27% of the total project cost. The \nremaining cost will be financed by MOC, YPG, and cofinancing through loans from the Industrial \nand Commercial Bank of China, which has appraised the Project and provided a commitment \nletter to YPCD (Table 2). MOC and YPG have made budgetary provisions for the counterpart \nfunds. The PRC will be the borrower of the loan. The ADB loan proceeds will be made available \nto YPG on the same terms and conditions as ADB loan. The Government shall cause YPG to \n(i) apply a portion of the proceeds of the Loan in an amount of $6,000,000 for Component C \n(para. 31); and (ii) onlend a portion of the proceeds of the Loan in an amount of $194,000,000 to \nWKEC under an Onlending Agreement upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Amounts         % \nAsian Development Bank  200.0  27 \nDomestic Bank Loans a  211.5  28 \nMinistry of Communications    98.6  13 \nYunnan Provincial Government  234.9  32 \nTotal  745.0  100 \na  15-year terms with 5-year grace period at the commercial rate. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n47.  Project  Management.  YPCD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  responsible  for  overall \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  Project  activities  will  be  implemented  by  the  Implementing \nAgency, WKEC, which was established in March 2007 as a subsidiary of YHIC. The project \nmanagement  office  (PMO)  established  within  YPCD  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project \nimplementation. Under the overall direction of the PMO, (i) WKEC will be responsible for direct \nimplementation of Components A and D of the Project; and (ii) YPCD, through the PMO, will be \nresponsible for direct implementation of Component B and Component C of the Project. The \nPMO will coordinate and oversee project implementation, submit progress, audit and other \nreports  to  ADB,  and  coordinate  with  ADB  review  missions.  Organization  charts  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix A.  \n \n48.  Implementation  Period.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  about  4  years  from \nJanuary 2009 to December 2012. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n49.  Procurement. All ADB-financed procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The expressway works will be divided into 18 packages, \n15 of which will be financed by ADB and procured under international competitive bidding \nprocedures. ADB-financed equipment will be procured under international competitive bidding \nprocedures. All other packages\u2014including equipment for tolling, telecommunications, traffic \nmonitoring and lighting, landscaping works, buildings, and ancillary facilities\u2014will be financed by \n ", "14 \nthe Government and procured under national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures. Various \nthresholds for procurement and the contract packages are set out in the procurement plan in \nAppendix 10. \n \n50.  All road safety enhancement works estimated to cost $200,000 or more will be procured \nthrough  NCB  procedures  in  accordance  with  the  PRC  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law,  1999, \nincluding clarifications agreed with ADB. All local road safety enhancement contracts expected \nto cost less than $200,000 will be procured using shopping procedures. Given the nature of the \nlocal road safety enhancement works, force account may be employed for works valued at less \nthan $100,000 when size and location make it unsuitable to adopt shopping procedures (this \nmay include work such as warning posters and signs on local roads, minor poster painting \nworks, and other small and remote scattered works). \n \n51.  Consulting  Services.  The  Project  will  finance  36  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  services,  including  15  person-months  for  the  team  leader  of  the  international \nconsultants; 6 person-months each for (i) bridge, and (ii) tunnel specialists; and 3 person-\nmonths each for (i) road safety, (ii) highway design, and (iii) ITS specialists. A program for \noverseas training, including 85 person-months, will be included in the Project. A consulting firm \nwill be engaged based on a full technical proposal through the quality- and cost-based selection \n(80% quality and 20% cost) procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The Project will also provide $100,000 to \nfinance a local road traffic safety strategy study. Given the very small contract values and the \nintensive relevant experience of the national firm28 proposed by YPCD in the areas of the study, \nthe firm will be selected using the single source selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. In addition, YPCD will engage and entirely finance \n5,500 person-months of national consultants. The national consultants, not financed by ADB, \nwill be recruited in accordance with government procedures acceptable to ADB. The chief \nsupervision engineer will be responsible for overall project supervision, assisted by two deputies, \none of whom will be the team leader of the international consultants. Outline terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n52.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing. Given the high priority accorded to \nthe Project, the Government requested ADB to approve advance contracting for civil works. The \nadvance contracting was approved by ADB on 16 May 2007, and covered the prequalification of \ncontractors, bidding, bid evaluation, and contract awards. The advance contracting will be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The Government also requested \nADB to approve retroactive financing and ADB advised that retroactive financing for eligible \nexpenditures should not exceed $20 million incurred before loan effectiveness, but not earlier \nthan 12 months before the signing of the Loan Agreement. The Government has been advised \nthat approval of the advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to \nfinancing the Project. \n \n53.  Anticorruption Policy. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  central  and  local  government  officials.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  the \n                                                 \n28  Yunnan Provincial Traffic Science Research Institute. \n ", "15 \nimplementing agency, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey relate to the Project. \n \n54.  YPCD and WKEC will ensure, during project implementation, that (i) officials from the \nDiscipline  and  Inspection  Bureau  will  monitor  bidding,  construction,  and  operations;  (ii) an \ninternal audit unit will be established in WKEC; (iii) a two-contract system will be adopted where \nthe winner of a civil works contract will also sign an anticorruption contract with the employer; \n(iv) periodic inspection of contractors will be undertaken to ensure that fund withdrawal and \nsettlement procedures are followed; and (v) the status of procurements and awards of contracts \nwill be published on YPCD\u2019s website in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. YPCD \nand WKEC will initiate liaison meetings with relevant agencies, as needed, to discuss any \nwarnings about, or information on, any corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices. \n \n55.  Disbursement Arrangements. All disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \nSince  most  payments  will  be  made  for  large  contracts,  direct  payment  and  commitment \nprocedures will be used to withdraw the loan funds. If the government funds are used first for \neligible  expenditures,  ADB\u2019s  reimbursement  procedure  will  be  used.  The  statement  of \nexpenditures procedure may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures in respect of \nindividual payments not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the Government and \nADB. \n \n56.  Accounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  YPCD  and  WKEC  will  maintain  separate \naccounts for the Project and related financial statements, and will have them audited annually in \naccordance with appropriate auditing standards consistently applied by independent auditors, \nwhose qualifications, experience, and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB. YPCD and \nWKEC will submit to ADB within 6 months of the end of each related fiscal year, certified copies \nof audited project accounts and financial statements, and an auditor\u2019s report on the Project, in \nboth English and Chinese. A separate audit opinion on the use of statement of expenditures, if \nany, will be included as part of the auditor\u2019s report. During project implementation, YPCD and \nWKEC  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports.  YPCD  and  WKEC  will  provide  ADB  with  a \ncompletion report within 3 months of the end of the Project. \n \n57.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. Project performance management \nsystem (PPMS) indicators, their relevance, and monitoring practicalities were confirmed and \nagreed with YPCD during project preparation. Baseline socioeconomic and transport indicators \nare also updated. The key indicators and assumptions outlined in the design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1) and monitoring of socioeconomic and poverty impacts (Supplementary \nAppendix C) will form the core data required for this assessment. The socioeconomic data \ninclude macro-level indicators and micro-level indicators for 2006. The micro-level data refer to \nsix  representative  townships  in  the  project  area,  and  six  sample  villages  (one  from  each \ntownship). YPCD will measure the indicators and report the key findings to ADB on project \ninception, at completion, and 3 years thereafter. It was agreed that a qualified local institute will \nbe engaged by WKEC to carry out the social monitoring. \n \n58.  Project Review. ADB and the Government will review project implementation jointly at \nleast once a year. In addition, ADB and the Government will undertake a comprehensive \nmidterm review 2 years after the start of project implementation. This will include a detailed \nreview of the scope, implementation arrangements, resettlement, achievement of scheduled \ntargets, and progress on the local road safety, private finance, and capacity building measures. \nFeedback from the PPMS activities will be analyzed. \n ", "16 \n59.  Institutional  Strengthening. In addition to the two stand-alone TAs (para. 44), the \nProject also provides for institutional development and capacity building to ensure effective \nimplementation  of  the  Project  and  sustainable  O&M  of  the  project  facilities.  The  capacity \nbuilding  component  of  $2  million  will  finance  project  supervision  consulting  services  and \n85 person-months international training during the project implementation. This will help YPCD, \nits related agencies, and WKEC to (i) become efficient in road planning, design, operation and \nmanagement; (ii) develop and implement a corporate development plan; (iii) develop sound \nO&M plans and adopt good practices; (iv) strengthen road safety and environmental protection; \nand (v) improve the efficiency of road transport services. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Traffic Forecast \n60.  The project expressway is an important section of the Chengdu\u2013Kunming corridor, one \nof the eight western development corridors. The traffic volume on the project expressway is \nexpected to grow from 8,150 passenger car units (pcu) per day in 2013 to 22,350 pcu per day in \n2023 and 42,670 pcu per day in 2032. The traffic forecast is in Appendix 11. \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n61.  The  project\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  estimated  by  comparing \nscenarios with and without the Project. The project\u2019s economic costs reflect (i) the capital cost of \nconstruction including physical contingencies, land acquisition, and resettlement; (ii) O&M costs, \nwhich  include  replacing  depreciated  equipment  and  periodic  maintenance;  and \n(iii) environmental mitigation costs. The economic benefits are (i) savings in vehicle operating \ncosts as a result of reduced road length, and improved traffic and road conditions; (ii) time \nsavings for road users; (iii) savings in road accident costs as a result of fewer accidents; and \n(iv) benefits from generated traffic. The Project is economically viable. The EIRR for the whole \nProject  is  17.1%.  The  EIRR  is  16.9%  for  the  expressway  and  23.5%  for  the  local  road \ncomponent. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the project\u2019s economic viability. The \neconomic analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \nC.  Financial Analysis and Projections \n62.  The proposed toll rates29 for the project expressway are considered reasonable to attract \nsufficient traffic to meet the criteria for the economic and financial internal rates of return. \nFinancial projections have been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects (2005). Projected financial statements indicate that its \ninternal financial revenues will be sufficient to cover O&M costs and debt service from the eighth \nyear of full operation. The expressway financial internal rate of return is estimated at about 4.3% \nafter taxes\u2014better than the weighted average cost of capital of 3.5%, net of taxes. Sensitivity \nanalysis indicates that the financial internal rate of return is adequate under adverse conditions. \nThe Project is considered financially viable and sustainable. Financial management assessment \nfound that the Project meets the financial management requirements, and can provide accurate \nand timely information on its status in the reporting format agreed with ADB (Appendix 13 and \nSupplementary Appendix D). \n \n                                                 \n29 The proposed toll rates are CNY0.40\u2013CNY2.03 per vehicle-km. Under the Yunnan provincial \u201cgreen passage\u201d \nregulations, local vehicles carrying fresh agricultural produce or livestock are exempt from tolls. \n ", "17 \nD.  Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n63.  Socioeconomic Profile. The project area includes a diverse range of social groups, \npoor and nonpoor, Han and ethnic minorities, urban and rural populations. Out of the five project \ncounties and districts, two are nationally identified poverty counties. Of the 1.93 million residents \nin the project area, 61% live in rural areas and about 478,000 or 25% belong to ethnic minority \ngroups.30 Of the rural population, 290,000 or 25% are poor. The poverty incidence rises to 37% \nin Wuding at the northern end of the project area. In addition, 26,700 urban residents or 10% \nare poor. Poverty in the project area is due to low education levels and limited technical skills, \nremote and isolated locations, limited farmland, disease, and disability. Since the poor are less \neducated,  they  are  less  likely  to  gain  employment  opportunities.  Poor  education,  limited \ntechnical skills, and limited migrant employment caused by remoteness have a direct linkage \nwith road access. \n \n64.  Social Benefits. Construction of the expressway will shorten travel distance and travel \ntime, and expand the capacity to transport agricultural produce more efficiently to Kunming \n(especially high value crops such as fruit, vegetables, and other cash crops). The expressway \nwill promote industrial development in Fumin, Luquan, and Wuding counties. Localized off-farm \njob opportunities will be available for local people, especially the poor. Improving local roads \nand transport services will be of direct benefit in providing improved access to markets and \nservices for the poor. Some 345,500 people will benefit from improved local roads, of which \n83,000 are classified as poor, and 115,000 as ethnic minorities. Improved road access will help \nfarmers purchase agricultural inputs in a cheaper and more timely manner, thus helping to \nimprove crop yields and facilitate the provision of agricultural extension services. Upgrading \nlocal roads will improve accessibility, making it easier for villagers to seek off-farm employment. \nThere  will  be  improved  (quicker,  smoother,  and  cheaper)  access  to  schools,  health  care \nservices, and local markets. In addition, construction and operation of the project roads will \ngenerate significant employment benefits for people along the alignment, including the provision \nof services to labor construction sites. The project local safety enhancement program will help \nreduce traffic accidents. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 14. \n \n65.  Ethnic Minorities and Gender Development. This is an indigenous peoples category A \nproject.  Ethnic  minorities  in  the  project  area comprise  25%  of  the beneficiaries.  Mitigation \nmeasures will address potential social risks, including resettlement, environmental disturbance, \nand  transmissible  diseases;  these  risks  are  mainly  focused  along  the  project  expressway \ncorridor.  Enhancement  measures  (such  as  local  roads,  local  road  safety,  small  business \ndevelopment, tourism promotion, and skills training) have been targeted in poor counties in the \nproject area, which have high concentrations of ethnic minorities and poverty villages, especially \nthe Miao and Lisu nationalities. Special measures will be targeted at women. The summary \nethnic minority development plan (EMDP) is in Appendix 15. \n \n66.  HIV/AIDS  Prevention.  Yunnan  Province  has  a  large  number  of  HIV/AIDS  cases, \naccounting for one quarter of the nation\u2019s total. The HIV/AIDS incidence appears to be very low \nin rural parts of the project area. However, improved transport and greater population mobility \nhas an impact on the spread of HIV/AIDS in and out of the province. During construction, a \nlarge number of construction workers will be engaged on the various worksites. Many resident \ncommunities near the construction sites might have increased risk of HIV/AIDS transmission. \nDuring operation, the Project will likely increase the migration of poor and seasonal workers to \nKunming, where there is higher risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. Separate measures to prevent \nHIV/AIDS  and  other  communicable  diseases  are  included  in  the  project  design.  Health, \nawareness, screening, and treatment requirements are stipulated in the ADB standard contract \n                                                 \n30 With the inclusion of the local road safety enhancement component, the Project will benefit more people.  \n ", "18 \nbidding document and compliance will be monitored regularly. A separate TA (footnote 27) will \ndevelop measures and tools to address HIV/AIDS issues in the transport sector and support \nimplementation of effective HIV prevention measures for transport projects in Yunnan and \nGuangxi. YPCD will implement the TA in Yunnan. The TA will involve (i) operational support for \nintegrated HIV prevention in transport projects, (ii) implementation of prevention measures to \nmitigate the risks of spreading HIV/AIDS among construction workers and communities near the \nproject\u2019s construction sites, (iii) capacity building of YPCD for systematic integration of HIV/AIDS \nprevention  programs  into  transport  projects;  and  (iv) development  of  a  monitoring  and \nevaluation system (Supplementary Appendix E). \n \n67.  Small Business Development. Given the close proximity to Kunming, the project area \nhas potential for small businesses to grow rapidly. Improved transportation links with Kunming \nwill stimulate the demand for goods and services in towns along the expressway corridor. \nPotential small business development includes (i) agricultural trading and agro-industry such as \norganic  vegetables,  chicken,  pork,  and  herbs;  (ii)  tourism  resorts,  services,  and  local \nhandicrafts; (iii) road passenger and freight transport services; and (iv) commercial services \nsuch as restaurants and shops. In Fumin County, the Rural Credit Cooperative has been \nsuccessful in supporting small business development. Close to the Fumin Interchange, ADB \nrequested that consideration be given to the inclusion of a local product market to provide the \nopportunity for the local community to sell local products and produce, and thus contribute to the \nlocal economy. YPCD agreed to consider the proposal at the detailed design stage. \n \n68.  Stakeholder Consultations. Over 2,430 people were interviewed during preparation of \nthe feasibility study, environmental assessment, social assessment, resettlement planning, and \nEMDP consultations. For the assessments on environment, resettlement, and ethnic minorities, \nconsultations were held with representatives of affected counties, townships, and villages. Both \nrural and urban people were familiar with the Project, and public support for it was high. The \nconsultation and participation process has influenced the project design and alignment, and the \nformulation of the environmental management plan (EMP), resettlement plan, and EMDP. To \nensure equal benefit from the Project, the poor, ethnic minority groups, and other vulnerable \ngroups  (such  as  women)  were  consulted  separately.  Their  needs  and  comments  were \nconsidered in the design of project components such as the local road improvement and the \nlocal road traffic safety enhancement programs (Supplementary Appendix F). \n \nE.  Environmental Assessment \n69.  This is an environmental category A project. The environmental impact assessment \n(EIA) for the expressway was prepared by YPCD and approved by the Ministry of Environmental \nProtection  in  April  2007.  A  major  environmental  issue  is  erosion  control.  A  soil  erosion \nprevention plan was prepared and approved by the Ministry of Water Resources in December \n2006. A summary initial environmental examination for the local roads was conducted during \nproject preparation, which concluded that this component would not require an EIA, given that \nthe civil works are for pavement, drainage installation, and slope protections. On the basis of the \nEIA, social erosion prevention plan and the field survey, a summary EIA has been prepared and \nendorsed by YPCD, circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, and made public through ADB\u2019s \nwebsite on 3 May 2007. The EIA and summary EIA assessed the environmental impact of the \nProject  and  prescribed  environmental  protection  and  mitigation  measures  costing \nCNY57.6 million. To ensure that all the potential adverse environmental impacts of the Project \nare mitigated, YPCD will implement the environmental management plan as specified in the EIA \nand summary EIA. The EMP will be incorporated in the bidding documents and contracts for \ncivil works; it will be monitored and reported on to ADB semiannually. \n \n ", "19 \nF.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n70.  This  is  an  involuntary  resettlement  category  A  project.  YPCD  has  prepared  a \nresettlement plan for the expressway and a short resettlement plan for the seven local roads. \nThe  land  use  pre-examination  was  approved  by  the  Ministry  of  Land  and  Resources  on \n24 January 2008. The Project will require the permanent acquisition of 400 hectares of land; \nabout  7,600  people  will  be  partially  affected.  The  Project  will  also  temporarily  occupy \n27 hectares of land during construction activities. Land acquisition and resettlement impacts \nwere minimized by aligning the expressway away from towns, village centers, and paddy lands, \nwhere possible; the urban section will be elevated to reduce impacts and disturbance. YPCD \nwill prepare and submit an updated resettlement plan to ADB prior to commencement of civil \nworks.  There  are  183,445 square  meters  of  buildings  to be  demolished,  most  of  which  is \nstorehouse, factory field, workshop, and shops in the urban section. There are 219 households \nwith 1,251 persons to be relocated. The seven local roads for upgrading include roads only \nrequire resurfacing within the existing alignment, so no resettlement will be necessary, but the \nshort resettlement plan will provide the basis for due diligence. The summary resettlement plan \nis in Appendix 16. \n \nG.  Risks \n71.  Overall, the project risk is rated modest. The project design has considered potential \ntechnical,  financial,  and  social  risks.  The  main  technical  risks  are  associated  with  the \nconstruction of tunnels and bridges. To avoid delays in construction and increased cost, the \nProject  will  ensure  (i)  selection  of  competent  contractors  by  thorough  prequalification, \n(ii) engineering design based on sufficient geological investigations, and (iii) adequate quality \nand safety assurance. The financial risks associated with construction and operation of the \nexpressway will depend on the level and composition of traffic, construction costs, ability of the \ncommercial management, and appropriate tolls. To mitigate the financial risks, WKEC will build \nup a commercial business environment for operations, the Project will receive substantial equity \nfrom the Government, and an appropriate toll structure will be adopted. Social risks include \nresettlement  and  HIV/AIDS  infection.  Appropriate  mitigation  measures  are  in  place  in  the \nresettlement plan. Measures to address HIV/AIDS issues are included in the project design and \nwill be supported by a stand-alone TA for preventing HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific. \n \n72.  The preparation team worked closely with YPCD to ensure that mitigation measures are \nin  place.  YPCD  has  experience  and  has  shown  satisfactory  performance  in  implementing \ninternationally  financed  projects.  YPCD  demonstrated  high  ownership  in  preparing  and \ncommitting to implement these action plans; and these risks will be closely monitored by YPCD, \nWKEC, local government agencies, external monitors, and ADB during project implementation. \n \nV.

Overview \n \n1.  Road traffic safety is a serious issue in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). In 2006, \nthere were 378,781 traffic accidents with 89,455 fatalities and 431,139 injuries, which meant \nmore than 240 lives were lost and more than 1,100 people were injured on the PRC\u2019s road \nevery day. It was estimated that the total economic cost of traffic accidents is approximately \n1.5\u20133.0% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. Beyond the enormous economic loss, poor \nroad safety has a substantial social impact. It is estimated that road accidents in the PRC have \nimpacted on the lives of more than 20 million people, either as victims of accidents or as family \nmembers of those involved in the accidents. Victims\u2019 families suffer from an increased burden of \ncare while facing reduced income and higher medical expenses. Consequently, loss of labor \nand increased medical costs often lead to poverty for affected families.  \n \n2.  In relation to traffic flow and vehicle ownership, road traffic accident rates in the PRC are \nvery high compared with accident rates in developed countries. Although the accident rate per \nhead  of  population  is relatively  low,  this  reflects  the low  vehicle  ownership  rates  and  low \nmotorization in the PRC. Comparing the fatality rate per 10,000 vehicles, the rate for the PRC \noverall and Yunnan is particularly high\u2014almost eight times higher than figures for Japan and \nthe United Kingdom. This indicates the scale of the problem, which is likely to emerge with \nincreased vehicle ownership and mobility. Good practice and policies must be in place at \npresent in order to reduce the number of fatalities and injuries on the roads before vehicle fleet \nexpand. An overall comparison of accident data is given in Table A4.1. \n \nTable A4.1: Comparative Accident Data of the PRC and Other Countries (2005) \n  Total Road  No. of Motor    Fatalities \n  Network Length  Vehicles  No. of Road  per 10,000 \nCountry  (km)  (million)  Fatalities  vehicles \nPRC  3,345,185  126.40  98,738  7.6 \nYunnan  167,637  3.28  2,901  8.8 \nJapan  1,192,972  82.82  7,931  1.0 \nAustralia  810,624  13.92  1,627  1.2 \nUS  6,430,351  245.64  43,443  1.8 \nUK  398,350  33.28  3,201  1.0 \nkm = kilometer, no. = number, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, UK = United Kingdom, US = United States. \nSource: International Traffic Safety Data and Ministry of Public Security of the PRC. \n \n3.  Most fatalities occur in nonurban areas. Based on information provided by Yunnan \nProvincial Public Security Department (YPSD), the total number of nonurban highway accidents \nin 2007 was 3,112\u2014with 1,901 fatalities and 3,835 injuries\u2014accounting for 57% of the total \naccidents, 82% of total fatalities, and 62% of total injuries. On a per vehicle-kilometer (km) basis, \nexpressways are the safest road category because of the separation of traffic in opposing \ndirections, access control, and restrictions on slow-moving vehicles. However, when accidents \noccur on expressways, the outcome can be more serious (with higher fatality rates per accident) \nbecause of increased speeds. This issue has been addressed separately.1 Of the total road \naccidents in 2007, 61% of accidents occurred on the low class roads (class III/IV/unclassified) \nwith 1,076 fatalities and 2,383 injuries. Of the 103 serious accidents in Yunnan in 2005 that \ncaused  more  than  3  fatalities,  61  happened  along  the  low  class  roads\u2014causing  about \n240 fatalities and 140 injuries in total. The Project will prioritize low class roads. An analysis of \nnonurban road accidents by road classification is given in Table A4.2. \n \n                                                 \n1  It was agreed that a road safety audit will be carried out during final design, construction, and before opening the \nexpressway. Provision of escape lanes on long down gradients will be considered during the final design stage. \n ", "34  Appendix 4 \nTable A4.2: Analysis of Nonurban Road Accidents by Road Classification (2007) \n  Length     No. of    No. of    No. of   \nItem  (km)      %  Accidents      %  Fatalities      %  Injuries      % \nExpressway  1,549  0.8  403  12.9  299  15.7  483  12.6 \nClass I  279  0.1  198  6.4  87  4.6  249  6.5 \nClass II  3,696  1.9  614  19.7  439  23.1  720  18.8 \nClass III  9,513  4.8  891  28.6  577  30.4  998  26.0 \nClass IV  84,797  42.7  570  18.3  352  18.5  784  20.4 \nBelow Class  98,662  49.7  436  14.0  147  7.7  601  15.7 \n  Total (nonurban)  198,500  100.0  3,112  100.0  1,901  100.0  3,835  100.0 \nkm = kilometer, no = number \na  Analysis excludes accidents on urban roads. \nSource: Yunnan Provincial Public Security Department  \n \nB.  Causes of Road Accidents \n \n4.  The major direct reasons cited for road traffic accidents in Yunnan are improper driving, \npoor road conditions, inadequate traffic management, poor road safety behavior of road users, \nand  vehicle  mechanical  failures.  Careful  analysis  of  all  road  accidents  have  shown  that \naccidents are often the result of a combination of several factors, rather than a single main \ncause. Improper driving is often compounded by poor road conditions. Lack of basic road safety \nfacilities often contribute to conditions where driver error occurs. In 2005, 17 serious accidents \ncaused more than 5 fatalities in Yunnan, 7 of which were caused by vehicles leaving the road \nand falling down a steep slope or cliff with 44 fatalities and 28 injuries. Road condition is one of \nthe most important factors that increases the risk and severity of accidents. \n \n5.  Yunnan Province has a total of 198,500 km of road, 97% of which are low class roads \n(class III and below). Most of the low-grade roads were built at a time when few resources were \nused for road safety facilities. Moreover, 94% of the total provincial area is mountains and hills. \nPoor roads undermined safety, such as roads with sharp turns and steep grades, poor sight \ndistance, and roadside hazards. It is vital to enhance safety facilities and establish better \nmanagement mechanism. In 2003, about 3,500 km road sections were identified by YPSD as \n\u201cblackspots or black segments\u201d2 on national highways.  \n \nC.  ADB and Government Strategy \n \n6.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been implementing a series of road safety \ninitiatives and strategies in the PRC to highlight and address the growing road safety problem. It \nhas funded advisory technical assistances3 to provide guidance on the national road safety \nstrategy and strengthen capacity building in traffic safety. In addition, road safety audits have \nbeen incorporated in all road transport projects financed by ADB. \n \n7.  The PRC Government is taking steps to address road safety issues. In the past, lack of \ncooperation and discussion between ministries hampered efficient road safety improvement. \nThe establishment of the first national interagency road safety committee in 2003 involving \nmultiple ministries, and the introduction of the first Road Traffic Safety Law in the PRC which \ntook  effect  on  1  May  2004  are  important  steps  in  the  coordination  of  road  safety.  The \nGovernment is paying growing attention to road safety and formulated a National Science and \nTechnology Action Plan for Road Safety on 20 February 2008. The action plan set measurable \ntargets including (i) reducing the number of road fatalities, (ii) reducing severe road accidents, \n                                                 \n2  The \u201cblackspots\u201d and \u201cblack segments\u201d were identified based on the number of accidents, deaths, injured persons, \nand economic loss.  \n3  ADB. 1999.

Dedicated resources will be allocated to address road safety. \n \nD.  The Proposed Local Road Safety Enhancement Program \n \n8.  Objective. Yunnan provincial government recognizes the urgency of this issue and is \nwilling to work with ADB to formulate solutions. A Local Road Safety Enhancement Program \n(the Program) has been incorporated as a component of the Project financed by ADB. The \noutcome of this Program is to establish an efficient and sustainable road safety mechanism for \nmanaging  road  safety.  The  Program  will  (i)  formulate  a  local  road  traffic  safety  strategy, \n(ii) strengthen interagency collaboration and partnership, (iii) include road safety audits in road \nbuilding and upgrading projects, (iv) formulate low-cost safety remedial measures and design, \n(v) improve hazardous spots on existing local roads, and (vi) conduct training.  \n \n9.  Institutional. Yunnan Provincial Communications Department (YPCD) and YPSD are \nthe main agencies involved in the road safety. YPCD is responsible for all aspects of road safety \nrelated measures, while the Traffic Police General Team of YPSD handles driver and pedestrian \neducation, law enforcement, traffic surveillance, and administration. It was agreed that a road \nsafety  interagency  committee  will  be  established  in  Yunnan  to  facilitate  the  project \nimplementation.  \n \n10.  Proposed Program. Experience has shown that, to be effective, joint action is required \nby the traffic police and Communications Department. The Program consists of (i) a study to \nformulate policy and strategies, (ii) a pilot program for treatment of blackspots, and (iii) provision \nof  institutional  strengthening  and  training.  The  Program  will  strengthen  partnership  and \ncollaboration  at  both  the  provincial  and  low  government  level.  Specifically,  the  Program \nincludes:  \n \n(i)  analyzing the factors contributing to accidents on roads, including factors and \ninteractions between road users, vehicles, and road conditions; \n(ii)  identifying the most dangerous local roads based on the number of accidents, \ndeaths,  injuries,  and  economic  loss;  making  proposals  to  reduce  accidents \nthrough the \u201cblack segments\u201d and \u201cblackspots\u201d treatments on these roads; \n(iii)  determining low-cost improvements in geometric alignments to provide better \nsight  distances  and  curves,  drainage,  and  skid-resistant  pavements;  and \nestablishing better maintenance systems;  \n(iv)  identifying the improvements required on roads through cities, townships, and \nvillages,  such  as  intersection  changes,  traffic  controls,  barriers,  signs,  and \nmarkings; \n(v)  formulating a strategy to strengthen traffic safety on local roads by harmonizing \nregulations, treatment standards, and procedures;  \n(vi)  preparing and implementing the road safety action plan for 4 years, 2009\u20132012;  \n(vii)  monitoring progress  each  year,  setting  new  goals,  and  amending  plans  and \nimplementation as required; and  \n(viii)  institutional strengthening and training. \n \n11.  Funding. The Program focuses on the safety enhancement of the local roads network \ncomprising mostly class III, IV, and unclassified roads. It was agreed that YPCD will allocate \nCNY64 million in counterpart funds from 2009 to 2012 to this Program. The total cost of the \ncomponent is estimated at CNY106 million ($14.8 million), of which $6 million will be financed \nby ADB (Table A4.3). \n \n ", "36  Appendix 4 \n \nTable A4.3: Local Road Safety Enhancement Project Cost Estimates \n(CNY million) \nYear  YPCD  ADB  Total  ADB Percentage \n2009  16.0  0.0  16.0  0 \n2010  16.0  14.0  30.0  47 \n2011  16.0  14.0  30.0  47 \n2012  16.0  14.0  30.0  47 \nTotal  64.0  42.0  106.0  40 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, YPCD = Yunnan Provincial Communications Department. \n    Sources: YPCD and ADB estimates. \n \n12.

Yunnan Road Network \n \n1.  Yunnan Province has a total of 198,500 kilometers (km) of road, of which less than 3% \n(5,500 km) is class II or above. Most of the roads in the province are class IV (84,800 km, \n42.7%) and unclassified (98,700 km, 49.7%). Less than 17% of the total road length in the \nprovince is paved; the remaining 83% (165,425 km) is unpaved, although 14,000 km of this has \na macadam (stone-set) surface.

The composition of Yunnan Road network is summarized in Table A5.1. \n \nTable A5.1: Composition of Yunnan Road Network (2006) \nBy Classification (Standard)    By Road Type (Function) \nItem  Length (km)     %    Item  Length (km)  % \nExpressway  1,549  0.8    National  7,260  3.7 \nClass I  279  0.1    Provincial  9,308  4.7 \nClass II  3,696  1.9    County  48,317  24.3 \nClass III  9,513  4.8    Township  97,848  49.3 \nClass IV  84,797  42.7    Village  31,115  15.7 \n  Subtotal  99,834  50.3    Special  4,652  2.3 \nUnclassified  98,666  49.7         \nTotal  198,500  100.0    Total  198,500  100 \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Yunnan Provincial Communications Department Yearbook. \n \nB.  Rural Road Improvement \n \n2.  The Project will improve seven rural road sections totaling 190 km in the project area \n(Table A5.2). These were selected based on a set of criteria: population served, socioeconomic \ncharacteristics of the area (including poverty indices and incidence of minority populations), \neconomic potential (both agricultural and nonfarm activities), access to basic services, etc. They \nwill connect remote townships and minority villages to national highway 108 and/or the project \nexpressway. More than 345,500 people will benefit directly from the improvement. The project \nlocal roads serve to demonstrate proper construction planning and implementation methods in \nan environmentally and socially sound manner. Yunnan Provincial Communications Department \n(YPCD)  and  local  governments  ensured  that  the  project\u2019s  local  road  improvement  will  be \ncompleted by 2012. With these seven roads, YPCD will demonstrate that its current 11th Five-\nYear Plan (FYP, 2006-2010) for local roads is being well-implemented to ensure that transport \nbenefits reach rural people, even in remote poverty areas. \n \n3.  The seven rural roads will be upgraded to all-weather links from unclassified to class IV. \nThese local roads would only require improving the subgrade and pavement within the existing \nright-of-way, so there would be no land acquisition or resettlement. A short resettlement plan \nand a summary initial environmental examination was prepared by YPCD and approved by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) in May 2007. The benefits of local road improvement to local \nvillagers were clearly evident and highly appreciated. These benefits will be monitored as part of \nthe social monitoring. \n \nC.  Rural Bus Service Access \n \n4.  There are a total of 1,313 townships and 13,198 administrative villages in Yunnan. \nBased on data provided by YPCD, 93% of townships and 50% of administrative villages have a \nbus service; the rest rely on informal bus services, whose services are unreliable, erratic, and \npotentially  unsafe.  Poor  road  condition  is  a  key  factor  restraining  road  transport  services \ndevelopment. \n ", "38  Appendix 5 \n5.  YPCD committed those administrative villages without basic all-weather access will be \nprioritized and upgraded in its 11th FYP. Road transport authorities tend not to issue bus route \nlicenses on unclassified roads. Yunnan Transport Administration Bureau agreed that some of \nthe recommendations of ADB technical assistance (TA) for sustainable rural transport services \nwill be adopted in the project area. To serve the needs of the majority of rural residents, Yunnan \nTransport  Administration  Bureau  agreed  to  organize  safety  inspection  and  management, \ntogether with traffic police and road administration agencies, to carry out field surveys on \nunclassified roads to determine the possibility of service. Passenger transport vehicles will be \nallowed to provide service on unclassified roads after comprehensive evaluation and approval, \nand with special administrative dispensation.  \n \n6.  Consideration will be given to variations in demand and different types of operation: \n(i) varying daily, weekly, and market-day schedules for routes that are not suitable for regular \ndaily  operation;  (ii)  extending  or  adjusting  existing  routes  on  a  more  flexible  basis;  and \n(iii) allowing flexible operations in a specified region, recycling operations, rolling-up departures, \non-call operations, or bundling profitable and unprofitable routes, and integrating rural transport \nand municipal public transport services. This will allow some flexibility for operators to adjust \ntheir services in line with passenger needs and use their vehicles and drivers more productively. \n \nD.  Rural Road Maintenance \n \n7.  Adequate maintenance is crucial to ensure the sustainability of rural roads. County \ngovernments are responsible for rural road maintenance, and the quality of rural roads is \nperiodically  checked  by  the  city  and  provincial  highway  administration.  There  have  been \nproblems with rural road maintenance resulting from poor road quality, insufficient funding and \ninadequate planning, limited implementation capacity, and lack of market-oriented approaches \nand framework. To improve rural road maintenance, the State Council issued a new policy for \nfinancing and management of rural road maintenance in October 2005. Yunnan provincial \ngovernment issued a Rural Road Maintenance Policy Reform Announcement in 2007. In line \nwith this policy, YPCD established an annual subsidy mechanism for rural road maintenance of \nCNY7,000/km for county roads, CNY3,500/km for township roads, and CNY1,000/km for village \nroads. YPCD has implemented the new policy throughout the province from 1 January 2008. \n \n8.  Given an asset base size of the Yunnan Rural Road Network, substantial benefits can \nbe obtained from a more scientific and cost-effective approach to road maintenance expenditure \nallocation. To manage maintenance effectively, a comprehensive inventory database system \ncomprising  all  key  parameters  needs  to  be  assembled.  The  key  parameters  include  road \ncondition (surface type, roughness, surface distress, etc.); construction and maintenance history \ndata; and traffic volumes (including proportions of heavy trucks and likely growth rates). \n \n9.  The evaluation and prioritization of maintenance requires a comprehensive analysis of \nthe overall life-cycle costs and benefits of the potential improvement and investment options. \nThis can be best achieved through the operation of the Highway Development and Management \n(HDM-IV)  system  capable  of  predicting  pavement  deterioration  and  performance;  and \ncomparing this with maintenance costs, improvement costs, and overall vehicle operating cost \nacross  the  network.  The  Project  will  provide  training  on  operating  an  HDM-IV  evaluation \nprogram to enhance YPCD\u2019s maintenance planning and prioritization capacity. \n \n \n ", " \nTable A5.2: Local Road Improvement under the Project \n \n                     \nSub-      Investment    Objective of Road  Population  Poverty  Minority  Estimated  Estimated \nproject  Road Name,  Length  Cost  Cost/km  Improvement  Served  Incidence  Share  Traffic  EIRR \nNo.  County  (km)  (CNY  (CNY  (thousand  (< 944  (% of  (passenger  (%) \nmillion)  million)  persons)  CNY/year)  population) car unit  \nper day) \n1  Shalaqing\u2013 51.0  14.3  0.28  all-weather connection to  50.0  38%  64%  150  23.4 \nDongpo, Wuding  NH108 for 2 townships \nCounty   \n \n2  Chadian\u2013Fawo,  45.0  22.5  0.50  all-weather connection to  56.0  58%  58%  200  24.7 \nWuding County  NH108 for 3 townships \n \n3  Jiuchang\u2013Maojie,  33.3  13.3  0.40  all-weather access for  102.2  23%  23%  400  28.8 \nWuding County  three townships and \nconnections to Wuding\u2013\nKunming Expressway \n \n4  Kuinan-Maiyidian,  10.0  3.9  0.39  all-weather link from  18.7  5%  9%  450  29.0 \nFumin County  remote township to \nNH108/Wuding\u2013\nKunming Expressway \n \n5  Dongyuan\u2013 22.0  39.2  1.78  all-weather connection to  45.4  6%  9%  150  20.4 \nSandan, Fumin  NH108/Wuding\u2013\nCounty  Kunming Expressway for \n4 townships, linkage \nWuhua District and \nFumin County \n \n6  Wagong\u2013Kunxiao  7.2  5.3  0.74  all-weather section of  26.8  7%  10%  50  26.5 \nRoad, Wuhua  Sandan connector, \nDistrict  linkage between Wuhua \nDistrict and Fumin \nCounty \n  A\np\n7  Changpo\u2013 21.5  6.5  0.30  all-weather linkage  46.4  5%  40%  500  22.6  p\ne\nMaomaoqing\u2013 between Anning City and  n\nd\nTuomu, Xishan  Xishan District of  ix\nDistrict  Kunming City,    5\n2 townships \n \n  Total  190.0  105.0      345.5          3\n9\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return.   \nSources: Project preparation consultants and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "40  Appendix 6 \nSTRATEGIC VEHICLE EMISSION REDUCTION PLAN \n \nA.  Overview \n \n1.  Increasing the number of vehicles and vehicle-kilometers traveled has raised concern \nabout local air pollution and global warming. Major vehicle emission are carbon monoxide (CO), \ncarbon  dioxide  (CO ),  hydrocarbon  (HC),  nitrogen  oxide  (NOx),  sulfur  oxide  (SOx),  and \n2\nsuspended particulate matter (SPM). These emissions cause local air pollution and health \nissues, and CO  increases global warming and causes climate change. Improvement of traffic \n2\nefficiency and vehicle quality could decrease all vehicle emissions. The major pollutants to be \nmeasured by the Project are CO, CO , HC, SOx, NOx, and SPM. The amount of reduction of \n2\nCO, CO , HC, NOx, and SPM at project level were assessed. \n2\n \nB.  Project Benefits \n \n2.  Reduction of CO, CO HC, NOx, and SPM was estimated by comparing the case with \n2, \nand without the Project. Without the Project, traffic would continue to use the existing road, \nwhich will be more congested; engines will consume more fuel and produce more pollutants by \ndecelerating, accelerating, and driving at very slow speed. With the Project, traffic will benefit \nfrom a shorter distance, optimal alignment, and less congestion. Vehicles will operate efficiently \nat high speed with less stop-and-go, which will result in lower fuel consumption and less \nemission of pollutants. The estimation of vehicle emissions is based on the relationship of fuel \nconsumption, emission of pollutants, and vehicle average speed. \n \n3.  For the first operating year, fuel conservation for passenger and freight vehicles in the \ncorridor is estimated at more than 6,000 ton of oil equivalent (toe) with a total saving of \n726,000 toe over the 20-year forecast period, or 25% lower than without the Project. In addition, \nit will result in the reduction of 22,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO ) pollutant emission, with a \n2\ntotal reduction of 2.3 million tons of CO  over the 20-year forecast period. Yunnan Provincial \n2\nEnvironmental Protection Bureau will monitor emissions on project roads (Table A6.1). \n \nTable A6.1: Estimated Vehicle Emission Reduction in the Project Corridor \n(ton of oil equivalent) \nItem/Year                       2013                       2032  2012\u20132032 \nFuel Savings  6,000  61,000  726,000 \nReduced CO  Emission  22,000  231,000  2,300,000 \n2\n  CO  = carbon dioxide. \n2\n  Sources: Yunnan Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n4.

Overview \n \n1.  The Central Yunnan Roads Development Project (the Project) has been identified as a \npriority project in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Plan of Action (2008\u20132012), which was \nendorsed by the governments of the six GMS countries at the Third GMS Summit in Vientiane, \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR) on 30\u201331 March 2008. The Project will contribute to \nexpanded trade and economic exchange between Yunnan and its GMS neighbors. Yunnan lies \nat the focal point of trade and commerce in the southwest People\u2019s Republic of China and is the \nnatural conduit for business with GMS countries. Export and import trade has grown rapidly in \nrecent years between Yunnan Province and other countries (see Table A7). With average \nannual growth rates of 20% for total trade with the world as well as with the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations countries during 2000\u20132006, the GMS countries have accounted for a \nsteady 20\u201330% share of total value. Trade with Viet Nam has increased most dramatically since \n2000 and now comprises over half of the cross-border trade with neighboring countries. Trade \nwith Lao PDR has grown rapidly in recent years (albeit from a small base) reflecting the \nimproved road connections and increased interaction between GMS countries.  \n \nTable A7: Yunnan Total Export-Import Trade, 2000\u20132006  \n($ million) \n  Year \nRegion       2000        2001       2002       2003       2004       2005        2006 \nTotal (All Countries)  1,812.8  1,989.1  2,226.4  2,667.7  3,747.8  4,738.2  6,231.7 \nTotal (Asia)  1,249.7  1,430.9  1,583.4  1,836.3  2,432.1  3,068.8  3,589.3 \nASEAN  628.1  708.8  824.0  1013.0  1,276.7  1,556.9  2,174.5 \nGMS  514.7  573.9  630.8  822.9  1,054.4  1,150.3  1,403.0 \nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations, GMS = Greater Mekong Subregion. \nSources: Yunnan Statistical Yearbooks. \n \n2.  Trade between Yunnan Province and Viet Nam is growing rapidly, with annual increases \nof 25% in volume and 30% in value recorded in recent years. Hekou has handled the largest \nvolume of cross-border trade in Yunnan since 2003. In 2007, the total volume amounted to \n2.25 million tons\u20141.69 million tons by road and 0.57 million tons by rail\u2014with a value of \n$1.1 billion. The volume carried by rail has been relatively constant (three trains per day) \nbecause of capacity constraints, whereas the road-based volume has increased by around 45% \nin the past year. The main commodities carried by road are agricultural products, machinery, \nand mining equipment. Imports have increased faster than exports. \n \n3.  A new cross-border bridge over the Hong He (Red River) is presently under construction. \nA major new customs checking and transshipment facility is being developed. Discussions are \nongoing between the People\u2019s Republic of China and Viet Nam to extend customs clearance \nhours from 15 hours opening to 24 hours. Starting November 2006, PRC trucks have been able \nto be operated beyond the border into Viet Nam\u2019s Northern Province, and Vietnamese trucks \ncan be operated into Hekou County under a bilateral road transport agreement. \n \n4.  Kunming is recognized as the northern terminal of the three GMS corridors: North\u2013South \nEconomic Corridor to Bangkok (via Northern Lao PDR); Eastern Corridor to Ha Noi/Hai Phong \nin Viet Nam; and Northern Corridor to Nanning/Fangcheng in Guangxi (Map 1).

The  GMS  governments  have  recognized  that  providing  subregional  physical \ninfrastructure is a necessary but not sufficient condition for increased connectivity among the six \nGMS countries. Mitigating nonphysical barriers to the cross-border movement of goods and \npeople is important to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and maximize the economic benefits of \nimproved subregional transport infrastructure. Nonphysical barriers impeding the free movement \nof  vehicles,  goods,  and  people  across  international  borders  in  the  subregion  include \n(i) restrictions  on  the  entry  of  motor  vehicles,  often  causing  costly  and  time-consuming \ntransshipment; (ii) different standards pertaining to vehicle size, weight, and safety requirements, \nand driver qualifications; (iii) inconsistent and difficult formalities related to customs procedures, \ninspections, clearances, and assessment of duties; and (iv) restrictive visa requirements. To \nmitigate nonphysical barriers to the cross-border movement of goods and people in the GMS, \nthe six countries have negotiated, signed, and ratified a cross-border transport agreement \n(CBTA)  framework  agreement  in  2003.  Full  implementation  of  the  CBTA  is  targeted  to \ncommence in 2010.  \n \n7.  The  GMS  CBTA  is  a  multilateral  instrument  for  the  facilitation  of  the  cross-border \ntransport of goods and people. Formulated under the auspices of a series of ADB technical \nassistance projects, the CBTA provides a practical approach to streamline regulations and \nreduce nonphysical barriers in the GMS. It incorporates the principles of bilateral or multilateral \nactions, and flexibility in recognition of differences in procedures in each of the GMS countries.  \n \n8.  The CBTA covers all the relevant aspects of cross-border transport facilitation in one \ndocument.  These  include  (i)  single-stop/single-window  customs  inspection;  (ii)  cross-border \nmovement of persons (i.e., visas for persons engaged in transport operations); (iii) transit traffic \nregimes, including exemptions from physical customs inspection, bond deposit, escort, and \nagriculture and veterinary inspection; (iv) requirements that road vehicles will have to meet to be \neligible for cross-border traffic; (v) exchange of commercial traffic rights; and (vi) infrastructure, \nincluding road and bridge design standards, road signs, and signals. The CBTA will apply to \nselected and mutually agreed routes and points of entry and exit in the signatory countries. Pilot \nimplementation of the CBTA commenced at some of the border crossing points, including the \nHekou\u2013Lao Cai border crossing along the GMS Eastern Corridor. With the ratification of the \nCBTA\u2019s implementing annexes by the PRC and Viet Nam, the ministries of transport of the two \ncountries  are  discussing  the  expansion  of  the  current  limited  exchange  of  traffic  rights \narrangements governed by an existing bilateral road transport agreement, to cover the entire \ncorridor from Kunming to Ha Noi and further to Hai Phong. \n ", "DETAILED COST ESTIMATES BY FINANCIER 4\n4\n($ million)\nADB Domestic Bank Loans Provincial and Central  A            \nCost  Cost Government  p\nItem    p\n (CNY million) ($ million) % of Cost  % of Cost  % of Cost  e\n$a Categoryb $ Category $ Category nd\nix\nA.

The  Project  is  located  in  the  mountainous  area  of  central  Yunnan  Province.  The \nWuding\u2013Kunming Expressway (WKE) constitutes a 64-kilometer (km) access-controlled four-\nlane expressway with a design speed of 80\u2013100 km/hour. The WKE provides five interchanges \nto connect other parts of the road network and provide services to local population. Compared \nwith the parallel existing national highway (NH108), the WKE will be about 20 km shorter and \noffer time savings of at least 1 hour. \n \n2.  The WKE is the last missing link in the Chengdu\u2013Kunming corridor, a priority Western \nDevelopment Corridor in the People\u2019s Republic of China. The total length of the Chengdu\u2013\nKunming corridor is 805 km\u2014213 km in Yunnan and 592 km in Sichuan. It connects two \ngrowing centers (Chengdu and Kunming) through underdeveloped areas in southern Sichuan \nand central Yunnan.1 With the completion of the Western Development Corridor and National \nHighway Trunk system by the end of 11th Five-Year Plan, Kunming\u2019s role as a growth pole on \nthe north\u2013south corridor will be strengthened. By 2015, the Kunming\u2013Ha Noi\u2013Hai Phong section \nof the Greater Mekong Subregion Corridor will be completed. Regional economic and trade \ngrowth will hence be a significant driver of interprovincial and international traffic with the \nGreater Mekong Subregion. \n \n3.  The WKE will be built parallel to the existing NH108, which was class IV but the section \nbetween Kunming to Wuding was upgraded to class II in 1998. The pavement is generally fair \nbut the road alignment is very poor, with sharp curves and steep grades. Its technical standard \nconfines the average speed on the road and road capacity. Average daily traffic in 2005 was \nabout 6,000 vehicles and the average speed on the road was less than 40 km/hour. The \nexisting road cannot meet the rapidly increasing traffic demand. \n \n4.  Estimated  traffic  on  the  project  road  is  based  on  routine  traffic  counts  and  the \ncomprehensive origin and destination surveys carried out in January 2005 and calibrated and \nupdated by project preparatory technical assistance consultants at six selected observation \nstations on the NH108 and other roads. According to the surveys, daily traffic in 2006 was about \n5,500\u201311,000 passenger car units (pcu) by road sections\u201456% passenger vehicles and 44% \nfreight vehicles. \n \n5.  Traffic forecasts have been based on an analysis of economic growth, population, and \nvehicle ownership. A traffic demand model was made on the basis of a conventional growth \nmodel. Traffic demand was projected separately for passenger and freight vehicles for 2013, \n2023, and 2032\u2014from origin and destination matrixes and demand elasticity of 1.0 and 0.9. \nAverage traffic growth rates in the project corridor are estimated to be 8% per year (2006\u20132013), \n7% per year (2013\u20132023), and 6% per year (2023\u20132032). \n \n6.  The traffic forecasts also allow for potential generated and diverted traffic as a result of \n(i)  additional  traffic  generated  by  the  Project  because  of  lower  trip  costs  in  the  corridor, \n(ii) potential  diverted  traffic  from  other  road  networks  because  of  the  corridor  capacity \nenhancement;  and  (iii)  non-model  local  intrazonal  traffic  in  the  existing  road  networks. \nGenerated traffic is estimated using price elasticity of minus 0.3 for passenger traffic and minus \n0.2 for freight traffic, and is projected to be 11.4% of normal passenger traffic and 9.8% of \nnormal freight traffic in 2013. \n                                                 \n1  In Yunnan, the WKE will connect the expressway from Yongren (Yunnan border) to Wuding (149 km, completed in \n2007). In Sichuan, it will further connect from the border to Chengdu (total 592 km). Chengdu\u2013Ya\u2019an (130 km) is \nfunctioning well; Ya\u2019an\u2013Xichang (245 km) is to be completed by 2010; Xichuang\u2013Panzhihua (160 km) opened to \ntraffic in 2006; and Panzhihua to Yunnan border (57 km) was completed in 2007. \n ", "  Appendix 11  49 \n7.  Traffic is assigned between every pair of traffic zones. Vehicles moving from one zone to \nanother make a choice of link paths based on their perceptions of generalized costs of travel on \nthe WKE and its parallel route\u2014a function of travel time, distance, associated toll cost, and \naffected by road conditions and traffic congestion. The diverted traffic from existing roads is \ncalculated using the Asian Development Bank\u2019s toll diversion model. The results of the analysis \nindicate that an average of 59% of vehicles may be diverted to the expressway in 2013. The \ntraffic diversion rate is expected to increase to 79% by 2023 and stabilize thereafter. \n \n8.  Ramp-up, a phenomenon on several recently opened expressways, is when traffic does \nnot transfer immediately from the existing road to the expressway, but takes a few years for the \nfull potential traffic to be realized. To estimate this effect, the following assumptions are made: \n75% of the expected flow for 2013 and 90% for 2014. The resulting traffic projection, by section, \nis summarized in Table A11. The forecast traffic volume on the WKE is expected grow from an \naverage of 8,150 pcu in 2013 to 22,350 pcu in 2023, to reach 42,670 pcu in 2032. \n \nTable A11: Average Annual Daily Traffic on Project Corridor by Sections \n(passenger car units) \n  Wuding\u2013 Fumin\u2013 Wuguishan\u2013 Weighted \nItem  Fumin  Wuguishan  Xiaotun  Average \nA.

General. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project, as the indicator of \neconomic analysis, was estimated by comparing the situation with and without the Project. \nWithout the Project, traffic will continue to use the existing road network, national highway (NH) \n108, which will be more congested and expensive to maintain because of rapidly increasing \ntraffic volume\u2014causing delays and resulting in increased travel time, vehicle operating cost \n(VOC), and road accidents. With the Project, traffic will benefit from faster, cheaper, and safer \ntravel because of a rapid reduction of congestion along the corridor. Some additional trips will \nbe generated as the economy responds to lower transport costs and better services. Some \ntraffic will be diverted from other road networks in the corridor. \n \n2.  Assumptions.  The  economic  analysis  incorporates  4  years  of  implementation  and \n20 years of operation. Economic evaluation was undertaken using 2008 prices, expressed in \nyuan  (CNY),  using  the  domestic  price  numeraire  with  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of \n1.013 for foreign exchange effects. Unskilled labor is valued using a shadow wage rate factor of \n0.7, considering the low productivity and unemployment in the area. The economic costs of the \nexpressway  include  (i)  capital  costs,  including  physical  contingency,  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, and environmental mitigation costs; and (ii) operation and maintenance (O&M), \nincluding replacing depreciated equipment and periodic maintenance. The economic costs were \nderived from financial costs by (i) excluding taxes and duties, (ii) converting the cost of imported \nitems to domestic prices using the shadow exchange rate factor, and (iii) converting unskilled \nlabor costs using the shadow wage rate. Using the domestic price numeraire, a conversion \nfactor of 0.962 was used for project capital cost. The economic benefits include (i) savings in \nVOC resulting from reduced travel distance and improved road conditions, (ii) savings in the \nvalue  of  passenger  time  tied  up  in  transit,  (iii) savings  resulting  from  fewer  accidents, \n(iv) benefits to generated traffic, and (v) savings in capital and O&M costs for NH108. \n \n3.  Expressway  Component.  The  project  expressway  will  shorten  the  route  by \n20 kilometers. The calculations of VOC savings allow for differences in roughness, terrain, \nspeed, and congestion; as well as a changing vehicle mix for both passenger and freight \nvehicles, and improvements in vehicle performance. The typical economic VOCs are shown in \nTable A12.1. Travel time savings are valued for passengers in vehicles only, as the time of crew \nmembers is valued in the vehicle operations cost. The time values of passengers are valued at \n25\u201375% of the average wage of passengers on the project expressway. The values used per \nperson-hour are CNY5.83 for car passengers and CNY1.17 for bus passengers. The economic \ncosts of accidents are estimated in terms of direct property damage and forgone income on the \nbasis of national data for 2006. The average economic cost of an accident is estimated at \nCNY108,800 on expressways and CNY84,000 on national highways. The benefits of generated \ntraffic are estimated at half the VOC and time savings of normal traffic as a proxy for willingness \nto pay. In addition, savings in capital and O&M costs for NH108 are calculated on the basis of \nmaintaining a volume-to-capacity ratio of 1.0 without the Project. The EIRR for the expressway \ncomponent is estimated at 16.9%, indicating that the Project is economically viable, with a net \npresent value of CNY2,130.5 million. \n \n4.  Local Road Component. The local roads for upgrading under the Project were chosen \nbased on the effect on overall road network efficiency and benefit-cost analysis, economic \ndevelopment potential, and population density. The local road costs include capital costs and \nO&M costs. The principal benefits of the local road improvement are identified as (i) VOC \nsavings (Table A12.1), (ii) benefits to generated traffic, and (iii) savings in O&M costs. The rural \nroads have a combined EIRR of 23.5% per annum with a net present value of CNY105.6 million. \n ", "  Appendix 12  51 \nTable A12.1: Estimated Economic Vehicle Operating Cost, 2013 \n(CNY per kilometer, 2008 prices) \nVehicle  Expressway  Existing Road \nCar  1.37  1.61 \nMedium-Sized Bus  2.19  2.84 \nSmall Truck  1.45  1.95 \nMedium-Sized Truck  2.04  2.70 \nHeavy Truck  2.31  2.95 \nArticulated Truck  3.00  3.75 \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Yunnan Provincial Communications Department. \n \n5.  The Whole Project. The Project as a whole generates an estimated EIRR of 17.1% \n(Table A12.2). The EIRR is 16.9% for the expressway and 23.5% for local roads. The VOC \nsavings from the expressway are the major economic benefit (69.2%) followed by passenger \ntime savings (17.8%). Avoided accident costs, savings to generated traffic, and other benefits \nare all relatively small. The benefits of the local roads, while important to the communities \nconcerned, account for 3.6% of the total benefits. The results of sensitivity analysis confirm the \nrobustness of the project\u2019s economic viability (Table A12.3). The capital cost would have to be \n76% higher than estimated for the EIRR to fall to the cutoff rate of 12%. Considering the \nexperience of the Asian Development Bank in the People\u2019s Republic of China, such an increase \nin capital cost is unlikely. A distribution analysis was conducted to determine the project effects \nfor various beneficiaries, including road users, labor, and government. Road users will receive \nthe largest share of net benefit, accounting for 84% (51% for passenger traffic and 33% for \nfreight traffic) of the total net benefits.  \n \nTable A12.2: Sensitivity Analysis \n    NPV    \nItem  EIRR (%)  (CNY million)  Switching Valuea (%) \n1.

The financial analysis of the Project was undertaken in accordance with the Guidelines \nfor the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects (2005) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). To ensure financial sustainability, the financial analysis measured the project\u2019s ability to \ngenerate  sufficient  revenues  from  operations  to  meet  all  costs,  including  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M),  financial  costs,  depreciation,  and  a  reasonable  rate  of  return  on \ninvestment.  \n \nA.  Financial Projections \n \n2.  A flat set of toll charges per kilometer (km) will apply to the entire expressway. Base year \ntolls at 2008 prices are shown in Table A13.1. The toll charges are assumed to increase once \nevery 5 years to keep up with inflation. Under current Yunnan \u201cgreen passage\u201d regulations, to \nreduce the burden for the poor, local vehicles carrying fresh agricultural produce or livestock are \nexempted from tolls. Poor communities will benefit from the exemption. It is assumed that 10% \nof such vehicles are exempted from tolls. Other income (from fuel sales, rental income, etc.) \namounts to 5% of toll revenue. \n \nTable A13.1: Base Year Tolls at 2008 Prices  \n(CNY per vehicle-km) \nVehicle Class  1  2  3  4  5  6 \nPassenger vehicles  \u226410 seats    10\u201330 seats  >30  seats     \nGoods vehicles  \u22641 ton  1\u20133 ton    3\u20136 ton  6-9 tons  > 9  tons \nToll rate   0.40  0.62  0.76  1.10  1.66  2.03 \n  Sources: Yunnan Provincial Communications Department and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n3.  Annual  incremental  O&M  costs  were  calculated  at  2008  prices  as  follows:  (i)  toll \noperation cost was estimated at CNY800,000 per toll plaza; labor costs will rise at a growth rate \nof 3% in real terms; (ii) routine maintenance cost was estimated at CNY80,000 per km, and it \nwill  increase  at  a  growth  rate  of  3%  in  real  terms.  Tunnel  O&M  cost  was  estimated  at \nCNY600,000 per km for an extra-long tunnel, CNY300,000 per km for a long tunnel, and \nCNY200,000 per km for a medium or short tunnel; and (iii) environmental monitoring costs at \nCNY500,000 per annum. All incremental O&M costs are projected to increase annually in line \nwith domestic inflation rates. In addition, periodic maintenance cost would be required after \n10 years of operation at a cost of CNY1.4 million per km in 2008 prices. \n \n4.  The Project will be funded at 45% by equity or grants, 55% by long-term loans. The \ndomestic bank loans will be repayable over 15 years, including a 5-year grace period at the \ncommercial rate. For the ADB loan, a 24-year maturity is assumed, including a 4-year grace \nperiod, a US dollar London interbank offered rate-based loan plus a lending spread of 0.2% and \ncommitment charge of 0.15%. Applicable business taxes at a rate of 5.6% are charged on \nrevenue. Corporate income tax at 25% is paid on income after deducting business taxes, \ndepreciation  and  interest  charges,  operating  expenses,  and  any  prior  year  losses  carried \nforward. Projected financial statements are in Table A13.2. The forecast revenue under the \nbase  assumptions  are  sufficient  to  cover  annual  recurrent  costs,  depreciation,  and  debt \nrepayments on the ADB and domestic bank loans from the expressway operation from the \neighth year of full operation. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis \n \n5.  The major assumptions used for calculation of the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nare as follows: (i) all calculations are made in 2008 prices, covering 2008 to 2032; (ii) capital \ncosts include all incremental capital expenditures related to the construction and equipment for \n ", "54  Appendix 13 \nthe expressway, but exclude price contingencies and interest during construction; (iii) O&M \ncosts  include  all  annual  incremental  expenses  incurred  in  operating  the  expressway,  but \nexclude depreciation and debt repayment provisions; (iv) operating revenues from toll used in \nfinancial projections are also adjusted to 2008 prices; and (v) the residual value equal to un-\ndepreciated value of capital investment is included as a benefit of the FIRR calculation. \n \n6.  The estimated weighted average cost of capital, after tax, in real terms was calculated \nusing estimated capital mix and costs of funds. Costs have been considered as follows: (i) the \napplicable 10-year fixed swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s spread is used for ADB debt, \n(ii) the estimated interest costs of 7% per annum are used for the domestic loan funds, and \n(iii) the cost of equity was assumed to be 8%. The cost of debt is adjusted to reflect the impact \nof income tax of 25%. The nominal cost of debt is converted to the real cost of debt by applying \ndomestic (for domestic currency denominated debt) and international average inflation rates (for \nforeign currency denominated debt). The FIRR computed on an after-tax basis, is 4.3%. This \ncompares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital, also computed on an after-tax \nbasis, of 3.5% (Table A13.3). The Project is considered both financially viable and sustainable. \nThe sensitivity analysis is shown in Table A13.4. \n \nC.  Impact of Toll Rate \n \n7.  The toll rate setting needs to satisfy two criteria: (i) generates enough revenue to obtain \na higher financial return on investment, and (ii) does not deter potential users and compromise \neconomic objectives. These criteria can be contradictory. The analysis for this Project shows \nthat overall average revenue from tolls will be about CNY0.72 per passenger car unit (pcu)/km, \nwhich should generate sufficient funds to service the loan while involving little sacrifice of the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR). The sensitivity test for the toll rate, taking into account \ntraffic elasticity to tolls, shows that even at a toll of CNY0.90/pcu/km, the FIRR would reach \n4.8% but the EIRR would remain in an acceptable range (15.6%). Beyond the toll rate of \nCNY0.90/pcu/km, the EIRR would fall rapidly while the FIRR levels off. Beyond the toll rate of \nCNY1.08/pcu/km, both the EIRR and FIRR fall rapidly (Figure A13). \n \nFigure A13: Sensitivity of EIRR, FIRR, WACC, to the Toll Rates\n20.0%\n18.0%\nC 16.0%\nC\nA 14.0%\nW\nd

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \nThe proposed Project involves the construction of an expressway of 64 kilometers (km) from Wuding county of Chuxiong Yi \nAutonomous Prefecture to Wuhua District of Kunming Municipality in Yunnan Province, upgrading 190 km of local roads and \ntraffic safety on local road network. The Project is included in the PRC\u2019s Western Development Strategy and will facilitate \n(i) economic growth via interprovincial trade between Yunnan and Sichuan provinces and international trade in Greater \nMekong Subregion, (ii) travel time reduction to the major cities from rural towns, (iii) industrial development and urbanization \nin  Fumin  county,  and  (iv)  poverty  reduction  through  induced  agricultural  commercialization  and  nonfarm  employment \nopportunities. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe proposed Project will directly benefit 1.93 million local residents, of which 24.9% are poor and 24.8% comprise ethnic \nminorities (including Yi, Bai, Miao, Lisu, Dai, Hui, and Hani). The northern part of the project area includes Wuding and \nLuquan, two national poverty counties. Poverty in the project area is due to low education levels and limited technical skills, \nremote and isolated locations, limited farmland, disease, and disability. Since the poor are less educated, they are less likely \nto gain employment opportunities. Poor education, limited technical skills, and limited migrant employment caused by \nremoteness have a direct linkage with road access. \n2. Design Features.  \nImprove Road Conditions at Township Level. The Project will involve 190 km of local road improvement, out of which \n130 km are in Wuding county. This will benefit 8 townships in Wuding, 3 townships in Fumin, 1 township in Wuhua, and \n2 townships in Anning and Xishan. Together with Kunming Municipality and Chuxiong Prefecture road development programs \nin Luquan and Lufeng county, the project area will have improved paved road access to all townships and all-weather roads to \nall administrative villages by 2010. The proposed expressway and local roads will play a key role in solving traffic bottlenecks \nand contribute to the strengthening of the road networks. The direct beneficiaries of the local roads will be 345,500 people, of \nwhich 24% are poor and 33% are ethnic minorities. \nFacilitate Economic Growth in the Project Area. The project area is very close to Kunming, rich in agriculture products, \nhydropower (Luquan and Lufeng), coal mining (Lufeng), tourism, and the cement industry. The Project will speed up industrial \ndevelopment in Fumin, which will be more integrated into Kunming City urban and industrial development plans, and in the \nlonger term will similarly benefit Wuding and Luquan counties. With training and other support, such as microcredit, at least \none third of rural families will benefit from off-farm jobs.  \nCreate Employment Opportunity under the Project. It is estimated that a total of 393,134 person-months of unskilled \nworkers are required under the Project and each worker is estimated to earn CNY450 per month. Out of the unskilled \nworkforce, 70% of work will be prioritized for local people, particularly the poor and ethnic minorities. Assuming each \nhousehold  has  one  person  who  works  for  4  months  each  year,  the  Project  will  directly  benefit  approximately \n17,200 households each year. Annual net additional income from this employment is approximately CNY1,800 per household. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nA poverty and social assessment has been prepared for the Project. This includes a poverty profile of beneficiaries and \nclientele groups, and a social assessment. The beneficiaries of the Project have been identified through survey, consultative \nfieldwork, and secondary sources. The construction of the expressway will shorten the travel distance and travel time, and \nexpand the capacity to transport agricultural produce to Kunming more efficiently, especially high value crops such as fruit, \nvegetables, and other cash crops. The expressway will promote industrial development in Fumin, Wuding, and Luquan \ncounties. Localized off-farm job opportunities will be available for local people, especially the poor. Upgrading of local roads \nwill be of more direct benefit in providing improved access for the poor to markets and services. Some 345,500 people will \nbenefit from improved local roads, of which 83,000 are classified poor and 115,000 minorities. Improved road access will \nassist farmers to purchase agricultural inputs in a cheaper and timelier manner, help improve crop yields, and facilitate the \nprovision of agricultural extension services. Improved access as a result of upgrading local roads will also encourage more \npeople to take advantage of off-farm labor. There will be improved (quicker, smoother, and cheaper) access to schools, health \ncare services, and local markets. In addition, the expressway construction and operation will generate significant employment \nbenefits for people along the alignment, including the provision of services to labor construction sites.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 14  59 \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Stakeholder consultation and analysis was done through three major methods during project preparation which sampled \nthe  rural  and  urban  population,  bus  passengers,  transport  operators,  enterprises,  and  local  governments  as  project \nstakeholders. Positive and negative effects on these groups caused by the Project were analyzed by the social survey. Some \n2,430 people  from  different  stakeholders  were  consulted  during  project  preparation.  To  finalize  the  alignment,  local \ngovernment officials and villagers were consulted to minimize losses of high-quality land and structures, and to consider local \npreferences  for  interchanges.  Many  changes  were  made  based  on  the  consultation.  Project  information  related  to \nresettlement and environment will be further disclosed before the Project starts. Local people will have an opportunity to \nparticipate in the project construction. A clearance form will be prepared for the village leaders to sign before the construction \ncompany demobilizes. Details of consultation and participation plans for implementation are included in the resettlement plans \nand ethnic minority development plan. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n   Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nThe resettlement and ethnic minority safeguard processes include consultation and participation of the community as a key \nstep in identification of impacts and mitigation measures. Ongoing participation of beneficiaries in the project development will \nbe offered through use of local people, especially the poor and women, during civil works.   \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \n \nImproved local roads, traffic safety and transport services will benefit women in particular. The poverty and social assessment \nindicated that women strongly support the Project and anticipate benefits such as an improved living environment, new \nemployment opportunities, information on outside markets, skills training, and reduced travel time. Project assurances \nprioritize women for employment and skills training.  While women stand to be beneficiaries of the Project, they are also likely \nto be more exposed to the risk of communicable diseases; for this reason, the project will give special attention to women for \nHIV/AIDS prevention.   \n \nIII.

The  proposed  expressway  connects  to  the  ending  point  of  the  Yongren  (Yunnan \nborder)\u2013Wuding Expressway in Wuding County of Chuxiong Yi Minority Autonomous Prefecture, \nand passes through Fumin County and Wuhua District of Kunming Municipality, linking with \nKunming Northwest Ring Road before entering Kunming City. The expressway is 64 kilometers \n(km) long, with 4.2 km of connector roads. The Project will also include upgrading 190 km of \nlocal roads in Wuding, Fumin, Xishan, and Wuhua counties/districts. \n \n2.  The expressway will affect 21 villages and 8 townships. The field survey indicated that \nthe project expressway and connector roads will require 400 hectares of land to be permanently \nacquired, of which 32.8% is paddy, 26.8% dry land, 2.3% vegetable plot, 3.0% orchard, 8.5% \nforestland, 20.9% shrubbery land, 2.1% barren, and 3.6% house plot. Based on the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) standard for impact assessment, the equivalent of 1,524 persons \nwould lose all their land and agricultural livelihoods. However, since the expressway will cross \nmany parcels of scattered farmland, it is estimated that the average loss of land per household \nwould  be  20%,  which  means  the  number  of  partially  affected  people  would  be  about \n7,600 persons.  The  Project  will  also  temporarily  occupy  27  hectares  during  construction \nactivities. There are 183,445 square meters of buildings to be demolished, most of which is \nstorehouse, factory, workshop, and shops in the urban section. There are 219 households with \n1,251 persons  to  be  relocated;  50 enterprises  will  also  be  affected.  The  exact  number  of \naffected enterprises and workers has not been calculated yet, pending detailed design. About \n18% of the affected people are ethnic minorities and about 11% are poor or vulnerable. The \nupgrading of the seven local roads will require no land acquisition or displacement of housing; a \nshort resettlement plan has been prepared to address any temporary impacts.  \n \n3.  The two resettlement plans were prepared by the Yunnan Provincial Communications \nDepartment (YPCD). The expressway resettlement plan is based on the feasibility study, draft \npreliminary design, and socioeconomic surveys of resettlement covering 302 households and \n15 village-level interviews. Consultations were conducted with the affected people, and their \ncomments and suggestions were reviewed to ensure that any concerns were addressed. After \nthe preliminary and detailed design approval by YPCD, a detailed survey will determine the \nprecise number of people and assets affected. Changes and related cost adjustments will be \nincluded in an updated resettlement plan and submitted to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfor approval prior to the commencement of civil works. \n \n4.  The resettlement plans are based on the Land Administration Law, 2004; Forest Law \n1998; Regulations on Administration of Dismantlement of Urban Housing, 2001, and related \npolicies; Decision to Deepen Reform and Strictly Enforce Land Administration (Document [2004] \nNo.28); Circular on Strengthening the Land Control (Document [2006] No.31); and related \npolicies of Yunnan Province. The resettlement plans were prepared in compliance with ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). Based on the \nabove policies and through consultation with local governments and  affected persons, the \nresettlement principles for the Project are established as follows: \n \n(i)  that compensation and entitlements provided to affected persons are adequate to \nat  least  maintain  their  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  standard  of  living,  with  prospect  of \nimprovement; \n(ii)  all affected persons, titled or non-titled landholdings, are taken into account for \ncompensation and resettlement assistance; \n(iii)  where requested by affected persons, ensure per capita minimum  cultivated \nlandholding in post-resettlement period to maintain livelihood standards; \n ", "  Appendix 16  65 \n \n(iv)  where land is not sufficient to maintain livelihood, compensation in cash or kind \nfor replacement land or other income-generating activities will be provided for; \n(v)  all affected persons will be adequately informed of eligibility, compensation rates \nand standards, livelihood and income restoration plans, project timing, and will be \ninvolved in resettlement plan implementation; \n(vi)  no  land  acquisition  will  take  place  prior  to  satisfactory  compensation  for \nresettlement of affected persons; \n(vii)  the  executing  agency  and  independent  and/or  third  party  will  monitor \ncompensation and resettlement operations; \n(viii)  vulnerable groups should receive special assistance or treatment to ensure they \nare better off; \n(ix)  resettlement  affected  people  should  have  opportunities  to  benefit  from  the \nProject; and \n(x)  the resettlement plan should be combined with the overall county/city/district or \ntownship planning. \n \n5.  Based on these principles, YPCD will ensure that the resettlement entitlements are \nprovided to the affected persons prior to ground clearance and commencement of demolition. \nLand  compensation  and  resettlement  subsidies  will  be  paid  to  affected  village  groups  or \nindividuals. Housing compensation and compensation for young crops and other assets will be \nprovided  directly  to  people  losing  those  assets.  YPCD  will  be  responsible  for  general \nadministration  of  the  Project.  A  project  resettlement  office  has  been  set  up  within  Wukun \nExpressway  Company  Limited  to  coordinate,  monitor,  and  supervise  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. Project resettlement offices will be established in each affected district, county, \nand township level. Resettlement and land acquisition costs for the Project are estimated at \nCNY337.2  million.  Some  adjustments  in  the  budget  are  expected,  following  the  detailed \nmeasurement survey. \n \n6.  At various stages, affected people have been consulted about the likely impacts of the \nProject.  The  stakeholders  consulted  include  (i)  heads  of  households  that  will  be  affected, \n(ii) village heads and villagers\u2019 representatives, (iii) local government agencies and departments, \nand  (iv)  women  and  vulnerable  groups.  Consultation  will  continue  throughout  the \nimplementation period. YPCD organized public consultation meetings in the affected villages. \nKey findings indicated full support for the Project. Some of the concerns raised have been \naddressed by adjusting the design and improving compensation entitlements and resettlement \nmeasures. Those affected were provided with a Resettlement Information Booklet on 26 April \n2007.  In  the  case  of  grievances,  all  complaints  will  be  processed  based  on  Government \nRegulation No. 431 on Grievance and Redress (May 2005). \n \n7.  The resettlement plans include internal and external monitoring systems. The Project \nResettlement Office and local resettlement offices will be responsible for internal monitoring to \nensure the timely and satisfactory implementation of land acquisition and resettlement activities \naccording to the resettlement plans. Progress reporting will be quarterly and a resettlement \ncompletion report will be prepared by Wukun Expressway Company Limited. The reports will be \nsent to ADB in a timely manner to keep ADB closely informed of progress and any substantive \nchanges. An independent institute or organization will be contracted to carry out the external \nmonitoring and evaluation. The tasks include (i) verifying the compensation payments and \ndisbursement  procedures;  (ii)  assessing  the  grievance  procedure;  (iii)  determining  affected \npersons\u2019 satisfaction with the entitlements and compensation; and (iv) assessing the efficiency, \neffectiveness,  impact,  and  sustainability  of  the  resettlement  to  draw  lessons  for  future \nresettlement implementation, formulation, and planning. The external monitoring and evaluation \nreports will be sent to YPCD and ADB. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080904124843+08'00'", "Author": "LPC", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "central yunnan roads development, yunnan provincial government, road transport system, yunnan regional transport system, road safety enhancement program, rural road construction, adb project 36455", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20080926112058+08'00'", "Title": "Central Yunnan Roads Development Project"}, "author_page": " \nVOC  \u2013  vehicle operating cost \nWACC  \u2013  weighted average cost of capital \nWKEC  \u2013  Wukun Expressway Company Limited \nYDRC  \u2013  Yunnan Development and Reform Commission \nYEPB  \u2013  Yunnan Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau \nYHIC  \u2013  Yunnan Provincial Highway Development and Investment Company \nLimited \nYPCD  \u2013  Yunnan Provincial Communications Department \nYPG  \u2013  Yunnan Provincial Government \nYPSD  \u2013  Yunnan Provincial Public Security Department \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December. \nFY before  a  calendar  year  denotes  the  year  in  which  the  fiscal  year  ends, \ne.g., FY2008 ends on 31 December 2008. \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nVice-President  C.
