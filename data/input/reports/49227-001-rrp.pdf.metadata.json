The report also describes technical assistance (TA) of up to $1,050,000 for Financial \nInclusion  for  Micro  and  Small  Business  Growth  in  Georgia,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES \n\n \nA. \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\nAlthough  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  at  an  annual  average  of  5.8%  from \n2. \n2010  to  2014,  Georgia  is  exposed  to  high  market  volatility  because  of  its  small  market  size; \ndependence  on  imports  of  goods  and  capital,  as  well  as  remittances;  and  exposure  to \nfluctuating demand from its trade partners. The current recession and political instability in the \nRussian  Federation  and  Ukraine,  coupled  with  the  economic  volatility  of  South  Caucasus \ncountries, have lowered Georgia\u2019s 2015 growth target to 2%. As a result of the trade deficit and \nreduced foreign  currency  inflows,  the  lari  depreciated  by  36%  against  the  dollar  in the  market \nfrom October 2014 to October 2015. This depreciation stands in contrast to the stability of the \nlari  during  2012  \u2013  2014  and  threatens  the  use  of  lari.  The  share  of  deposits  denominated  in \nforeign  currency  was  66%  in  March  2015.  Reducing  the  dollarization  of  the  economy,  a  long-\nterm objective of the government, is essential for reducing market risks. \n \nAlthough  43%  of  Georgians  live  in  rural  areas  and  27%  live  in  regional  towns,  these \n3. \nregions  contribute  only  28%  to  business  turnover.2 As  75%  of  farms  engage  in  subsistence \nfarming,  agriculture  contributes  only  10%  of  GDP  (2014).  About  23%  are  small  family  farms \nbetween  1  hectare  and  5  hectares,  providing  limited  opportunities  for  serving  urban  markets; \nonly  11,200  or  2%  of  farms  have  the  scale  for  commercial  operations.  Hence,  many  self-\nemployed  farmers  are  trapped  in  low-productivity  farms,  which  explains  the  high  rural  poverty \nheadcount  of  27.1%  (2013).  However,  agriculture\u2019s  potential  for  income  and  employment \ngeneration is large. Georgia benefits from diverse climate zones, which provide opportunities for \nexport expansion and import substitution. Improving infrastructure, storage, processing and the \nquality of products requires capital, but only 4.4% of business loans go to agriculture. \n \n4. \nGeorgia has only about 40,000 active enterprises. Its unrecorded economy is estimated \nat 14% of GDP (2014). About 2,100 small and medium-sized companies employ the bulk of the \nenterprise  workforce  (57%),  or  20%  of  the  total  workforce.  Since  2010,  annual  employment \ngrowth  in  such  entities  has  averaged  9.8%\u2014far  outpacing  smaller  units,  which  grew  at  only \n4.1%  per  year.  However,  low-productivity  sectors,  such  as  wholesale,  retail,  construction  and \nservices,  generate  75%  of  value-added  output  in  2014.  A  World  Economic  Forum  survey \nidentified  the  major  obstacles  to  business  growth  as  inadequately  qualified  management  and \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  National Statistical Office Georgia. Preliminary Results of the Census 2014, and GeoStat Database. \n\nhttp://www.geostat.ge/?action=page&p_id=32&lang=eng. (accessed 16 June 2015). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n \n\nworkforce  and  limited  access  to  finance.  Although  the  regulatory  framework  of  the  finance \nsector  is  robust,  the  penetration  of  banking  is  low  by  international  standards,  pointing  to  the \nneed  for  leaner,  business-friendly  lending  processes.3 On  the  demand  side,  many  clients  are \nunable to articulate their business plans and improve their marketing and staff performance. \n \n5. \nDespite recent efforts to revive agriculture and improve the income of the poor through \nsocial  transfer  programs,  21%  of  Georgians  lived  below  the  national  poverty  line  in  2013.4 \nGeorgia  relies  heavily  on  private  investments  to  maintain  and  generate  employment  and \ndepends  on  the  finance  sector  to  fund  its  investment  and  working  capital  needs.  With  the \ncontinued high incidence of poverty in rural regions and secondary towns, a dual-track approach \nis needed to simultaneously (i) boost microbusinesses and farmers in order to stabilize incomes \nof the poor and (ii) help small businesses become the drivers of income and employment.  \n\n \n6. \nFinance sector assets totaled GEL22.2 billion or 71% of GDP in 2014. Banks held 93.2% \nof the assets, dwarfing nonbank financial institutions (6.8%). From 2010 to 2014, the compound \nannual  growth  rate  (CAGR)  of  bank  loans  to  the  private  sector  was  19.8%.  The  depth  of  the \nfinancial  system  also  improved,  with  private  sector  credit  increasing  from  29.3%  of  GDP  to \n43.6% from 2010 to 2014.5 However, the high share of retail credit (50%) obscures the modest \npenetration of private enterprise credit, which is equivalent to only 20% of GDP. The market is \nconcentrated  in  Tbilisi,  which  receives  78%  of  loans.  Although  services  to  the  regions  are \nimproving, many small businesses and farms remain underserved. \n \nThe bank regulatory framework has helped improve the sector\u2019s resilience since 2009.6 \n7. \nInternal  capital  adequacy  assessment  programs,  supported  by  ongoing  TA  financed  from  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  became  mandatory  for  banks  in  2014  and  include \nimprovement of the banks\u2019 forecasting and regulatory oversight. As Georgia is moving towards \nBasel III capital adequacy regulation in 2018, cyclical buffers for market volatility and structural \nbuffers  for  three  systemically  important  banks  (including  TBC),  as  well  as  the  alignment  of \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards  and national accounting standards are expected.. \nBanking  regulation  is  conservative  compared  with  regional  peers  and  includes  higher  capital \nsurcharges  and  liquidity  reserves  for  foreign  currency  loans  and  deposits,  especially  of \nnonresidents.7  \n \n8. \nThe  differential  between  loans  and  deposits  priced  in  local  and  foreign  currencies  has \nincreased  since  2012,  because  of  the  higher  demand  for  lari  during  the  period  of  stable \nexchange  rates  that  ended  in  October  2014.  Since  March  2014,  international  financial \ninstitutions (IFIs), including ADB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and \nthe International Finance Corporation issued lari-denominated bonds, supported by the National \nBank  of  Georgia  (NBG)  and  the  government.  The  recent  large  depreciation  in  the  market  has \nresulted in higher dollarization and limits banks\u2019 ability to lend in lari. \n \n\n                                                \n3   World Economic Forum. 2014.

Manila. \n\n\fSince 2007, ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department has been active in Georgia\u2019s \n9. \nfinance  sector  by  providing  loans  to  banks  that  have  primarily  supported  small  and  medium-\nsized enterprises (SMEs) in the capital. To improve outreach to the regions (outside the capital) \nand diversify risk, ADB provided a loan and TA to TBC in 2013, which\u2014backed by ADB\u2019s first \nlari bond issue\u2014was converted into a lari loan in February 2015.8 TBC\u2019s full integration of Bank \nConstanta, its microfinance arm, provides opportunities to improve services to rural customers. \nTBC, Credo, and FBG offer alternative approaches to serving the target market. TBC\u2019s loans to \nmicro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) average $42,600 (August 2015). Credo, \nthrough  its  village  lending model,  provides  microloans  averaging  $800  per  loan.  FBG, through \nits farm household service model, provides loans with an average of $1,038 per loan.  \n \n10. \nCompetition  among  lenders  that  use  alternative  strategies  and  distribution  channels \nbenefit  the  financing  for  micro  and  small  enterprises  (MSEs),  as  well  as  small  farmers.  Since \n2013,  ADB  has  had  a  close  relationship  and  extensive  dialogue  with  TBC,  which  has \ndemonstrated  sound  financial  performance,  an  improving  risk  profile  and  good  corporate \ngovernance. TBC has proven its commitment to reach out to small businesses through lending \nand  knowledge  services  supported  under  ADB\u2019s  TA.  ADB  also  has  a  relationship  with  FINCA \nMicrofinance Holding, the owner of FBG and FINCA Azerbaijan.9 The loan to Credo builds upon \nADB\u2019s  relationship  with  Access  Microfinance  Holding  (AMH),  which  includes  investments  in \nAzerbaijan (footnote 11) and Tajikistan. In addition, reputable IFIs are substantial shareholders \nof  the  holdings,  bringing  their  sound  credit  culture,  responsible  finance  policies,  and  quality \nservice to low-income segments. \n \nB. \n\nCredo Microfinance Organization \n\ninvestment \n\ntwo  microfinance \n\nfunds  (MIFs)  managed  by  Triodos \n\n11. \nOwnership  and  business  strategy.

Credo benefits from its shareholders\u2019 high integrity and \nresponsible finance standards  and  AMH\u2019s  hands-on knowledge transfer. With 67%  of  loans to \nagriculture, Credo has a strong rural footprint and is now seeking to provide banking services to \nSMEs.  \n \n12.  Management and board. Credo is governed by the meeting of shareholders and a two-\ntier board comprising a board of directors (BOD) and the senior management team. The BOD \noversees  Credo\u2019s  operations  and  risks.  All  current  BOD  members  are  bankers  with  extensive \ninternational  MSME  banking  and  BOD  experience.

FBG\u2019s \nhigh  standard  of  governance  was  shaped  by  its  parent  transferring  knowledge  and  providing \noversight. With 38% of its loans in agriculture, FBG has a strong rural footprint.  \n \n18.  Management  and  board.  FBG has a two-tier board, comprising a BOD and a board of \nmanagement  (BOM).  FINCA  Microfinance  Holdings  nominates  FBG\u2019s  five-member  BOD  all  of \nwhich are bankers with extensive international microfinance and  BOD backgrounds. The BOM \nis led by an experienced chief executive officer chosen from the FINCA network.

With an average loan size of GEL2,483 ($1,038) and \n20. \nan  average  tenor  of  2  years,  FBG\u2019s  loan  book  is  highly  granular,  well-diversified,  and  quickly \nliquidating.  In  addition  to  agriculture,  FBG  lends  to  the  trade  (29%),  services  (24%)  and \nproduction sectors (12%). With 84% of its loans outside Tbilisi, it has a strong regional footprint. \nFBG\u2019s asset quality is sound with a portfolio at risk ratio (more than 30 days) of 2.2% (2014). Its \nloan loss provisions are prudent exceeding NPLs (2014). \n \n21. \nEarnings  and  profitability. FBG\u2019s net income reached GEL5.0 million ($2.8 million) in \n2014. FBG plans to increase its profitability through greater selectivity of quality microenterprise \ncustomers and the introduction of lending to small business customers with higher margins. \n \n22. \nFunding  and  liquidity.  FBG  sources  its  funding  primarily  through  IFIs  and  MIFs. \nAlthough not internationally rated,  FBG has established a good track record of borrowing from \nIFIs and MIFs because of its development orientation, sound lending process, and asset quality.  \n \nD. \n\nTBC Bank \n\n23. \nOwnership  and  strategy.    As  Georgia\u2019s  second-largest  bank  with  market  shares  of \n27.7%  for  loans  and  28.4%  for  retail  deposits  in  2014,  TBC  is  a  systemically  important  bank. \n\n\fEstablished  in  1992,  TBC  carried  out  an  initial  public  offering  (IPO)  on  the  London  Stock \nExchange  in  June  2014.  The  two  Georgian  founders  own  22.42%,  while  IFIs  hold  23%.  TBC \nhas  a  strong  franchise  in  the  micro,  SME,  retail,  and  corporate  segments.  Its  unique  strength \nlies  in  its  business  sophistication  and  outreach  through  cost-effective  electronic  distribution \nchannels.  With  the  full  integration  of  Bank  Constanta,  TBC  improved  its  rural  presence  and \nmaximized  synergies  using  retail  and  MSME  lending  processes  for  Constanta  clients  and \nbranches. \n \n24.  Management.  TBC\u2019s  board  of  management  comprises  the  chief  executive  officer,  the \nchief operating officer, the chief financial officer, the chief risk officer, and three business heads. \n \n25. \nCapital  adequacy.  TBC\u2019s  regulatory  capital  adequacy  ratio  reached  15.0%  in  2014. \nTBC raised capital through retained earnings, facilitated by a conservative dividend policy and \nthe issuance of new shares and subordinated debt.  \n \nLoan portfolio and asset quality. In 2014, TBC\u2019s gross loan portfolio reached GEL3.7 \n26. \nbillion,  of  which  agriculture  represents  7.2%.  TBC  has  improved  its  risk  profile  since  2012  by \nreducing its high corporate exposure concentration and by diversifying into micro and SME loan \nsegments (14% of loans) and retail (45%). The net NPL (classified loans net of provisions) ratio \ndropped from 3.0% to 1.9% during the same period.   \n \n27. \nEarnings  and  profitability.  TBC  is  highly  profitable.  Net  income  increased  by  28%  to \nGEL157.5  million  in  2014  because  of  robust  loan  growth  and  a  stable  net  interest  margin  of \n8.5%,  while  its  ROA  improved  to  3.3%  (from  3.1%  in  2013).  Return  on  equity  decreased  to \n18.4%, from 18.7% in 2013, because of the IPO-funded capital increase. \n \nFunding  and  liquidity.  As  the  retail  deposit  market  leader,  TBC  sourced  75%  of  its \n28. \nfunding  (2014)  through  deposits.  It  supplements  the  remainder  through  IFI  term  loans  and \ndomestic  borrowings. TBC\u2019s funding  is  highly  dollarized.  The  Basel III  net  stable funding ratio, \nwhich measures the stability of funding of maturities above 1 year, was 115% at the end of 2014, \ncomfortably above NBG\u2019s prudential requirement of 100%. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nThe  ADB  transactions  will  support  financial  inclusion  for  MSMEs  and  farmers.  The \n29. \nproposed ADB assistance comprises (i) a senior loan for Credo of up to $23 million (or its lari \nequivalent) with a 4-year tenor; (ii) a subordinated loan for TBC of up to $50 million (or its euro \nor lari equivalent) with a 10-year bullet maturity; (iii) a senior loan for TBC of up to $50 million (or \nits euro or lari equivalent) with a tenor of up to 6.5 years; (iv) a senior loan for FBG of up to $7 \nmillion  (or  its  lari  equivalent)  with  a  4-year  tenor;  and  (v)  a  TA  grant  of  up  to  $1.05  million  to \nsupport  (a)  TBC\u2019s  MSME  Academy  services;  and  (b)  each  of  the  three  banks\u2019  efficiency \nimprovements  and  the  development  of  loan  and  assistance  to  skills  improvement  to  MSMEs \nand  farmers,  including  branchless  banking  and  associated  financial  literacy  programs  to  their \ncustomers. \n \nB. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n30. \nCredo,  FBG,  and  TBC  will  provide  annual  audited  financial  statements,  quarterly \nfinancial  statements,  and  compliance  certificates  for  loan  covenants.  Reporting  will  include \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\nupdates  on  (i)  financial,  solvency,  and  profitability  metrics;  (ii)  governance,  safeguards,  and \nsocial protection compliance; and (iii) business performance and utilization of the ADB loans. \n \nC. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n31. \nEconomic  diversification  and  widening  access  to  finance.  The  loans  will  support \ndiversification  into  rural  areas  and  secondary  towns  and  will  improve  access  to  working  and \nfixed  investment  capital for  MSMEs  and farms. The  long tenor  of the  ADB  loans will  allow  the \nborrowers  to  increase  investment  loans  with  longer  tenors  and  enable  funding  several  loan \ncycles  to  the  target  group,  thereby  enhancing  the  impact  of  the  transactions.  The  concurrent \nsupport  of  three  lenders  will  foster  competition  to  the  benefit  of  the  target  group,  improving \nincomes and reducing poverty in the regions. \n \n32. \nBoosting local currency use and leveraging lending to micro, small, and medium-\nsized  enterprises.  The senior loans to the three lenders will enhance term lending to MSMEs \nand  farmers.  The  subordinated  loan  to  TBC  will  help  TBC  maintain  its  capital  adequacy  and \nfurther  leverage  lending  to  MSMEs  by  a  factor  of  at  least  5.  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment  is  also  working  closely  with  ADB\u2019s  Treasury  Department  to  secure  lari  funding \nthrough ADB lari bonds (depending on market conditions) following the successful launch of the \nfirst ADB lari bond. ADB loans will also help lengthen the tenor for MSME loans through long-\nterm  funding  that  cannot  be  raised  through  deposits  and  domestic  borrowings.  ADB\u2019s \ncontribution also helps diversify the borrowers\u2019 funding sources and boost market confidence. \n \n33. \nLeveraging micro and small enterprise finance networks. ADB\u2019s relationship with the \ninternational AMH and FINCA networks and TBC will deepen through collaboration and develop \nbusiness for financial inclusion in the South Caucasus and Central Asia. \n \n34. \nTechnical assistance. The TA will help (i) TBC expand its advisory services to MSMEs; \n(ii)  Credo,  FBG,  and  TBC  improve  their  respective  MSME  finance  product  offerings;  and  (iii) \nCredo,  FBG,  and  TBC  increase  their  respective  outreach  to,  and  financial  literacy  in,  remote \nvillages to address possible over-indebtedness of households. \n \nD. \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n35. \nThe  capacity  development  technical  assistance  is  estimated  to  cost  $6.10 million,  of \nwhich  $1.05  million  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special \nFund  (TASF-V).  Credo,  FBG,  and  TBC  will  each  provide  matching  funding  of  their  respective \ncomponents.  To  ensure  adequate  management,  accountability,  ownership  of  the  beneficiary \ninstitutions  over  the  execution  of  the  services,  and  a  timely  response to  local  needs  identified \nduring implementation, the administration (selection and execution) will be delegated to Credo, \nTBC,  and  FBG  to  be  carried  out  in  accordance with ADB  policies  and  established  commercial \npractices  acceptable to  ADB.  The  role  of  ADB  will  be  to  monitor  the  compliance  of  consultant \nselection,  procurement,  and  the  use  of  funds  with  ADB  policies,  and  to  track  outputs  for \ndevelopment effectiveness.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n36. \nThe development impact will be improved competitiveness and increased availability of \ncredit  to  farmers  and  MSMEs.  The  outcome  will  be  sustainable  improvement  in  financial \n\n\fAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nservicing of MSMEs and farmers in the regions. The institutions are expected to set examples \nfor  other  financial  institutions  on  how  to  deepen  their  outreach,  while  retaining  good  asset \nquality  and  funding  private  enterprise  activities  that  generate  jobs.  The  outputs  will  be  the \nexpanded  capacity  of  Credo,  FBG,  and  TBC  to  provide  financing  to  MSMEs  and  farmers  in \nGeorgia by offering a wider product range customized to their needs.  \n \nB. \n \nConsistency with  ADB  strategy and country strategy. Under the Midterm Review of \n37. \nStrategy  2020,  ADB  aims  to  strengthen  its  support  for  the  finance  sector  by  assisting  the \ndevelopment  of  financial  infrastructure,  institutions,  and  products  and  services;  and  by \npromoting  inclusive  growth. 10  The  borrowers\u2019  emphasis  on  funding  segments  where  the \npotential for employment and income generation is high will support inclusive growth. The ADB \nloans will help the borrowers provide loans to MSMEs in order to realize their investment needs. \nThis  is  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  promote  growth  in  rural  areas  and  ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for Georgia, 2014\u20132018.11 \n \n38. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  ADB  plays  a \ntangible role in supporting the deepening of financial services in Georgia. Since 2007, ADB has \nprovided nonsovereign loans of $125 million to banks, comprising two loans to Bank of Georgia \nand one loan to TBC, as well as TA to NBG and TBC. Bank of Georgia and TBC also benefit \nfrom ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program, with an exposure limit of $30 million. The loans to TBC will \nbuild  on  the  ongoing  loan;  the  loans  to  FBG  and  Credo  will  be  the  first.  ADB  nonsovereign \nefforts align with efforts to develop the local currency bond market, as well as sovereign support \nfor capital markets, including contractual savings under a program approved in 2014.12 Staff of \nthe ADB Central and West Asia Department participated in processing the transactions. \n \n39. \nLessons  from  previous  operations.  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  loan  and  TA  to  TBC  helped \nstreamline TBC\u2019s lending process for small business borrowers and improve the awareness and \nbusiness  skills  of  SME  business  owners  through  targeted  advisory  sessions.  Since  mid-2013, \nmore  than  3,000  entrepreneurs  have  benefited  from  the  TA.  A  second  phase  will  widen  the \nscope  to  targeted  one-on-one  business  advisory  sessions  to  SMEs  and  basic  training  for \nmicroenterprises. The provision of capital for investment and knowledge services through banks \nprovides opportunities for SMEs to overcome obstacles of growth through a graduation process \nwhereby entrepreneurs learn to identify and realize market opportunities. \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n40. \nADB\u2019s  loans  are  classified  category  FI  for  TBC,  Credo,  and  FBG  for  impacts  on  the \nenvironment,  and  category  FI  treated  as  C  for  impacts  on  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous peoples. ADB\u2019s loans will not finance subloans classified as environment category A \nand  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  safeguards  categories  A  and  B.  The \nborrowers\u2019  business  activities  have  minimal  or  no  adverse  environmental  impacts  and  are \n                                                \n10  ADB. 2014.

The  borrowers \nwill  (i)  apply  ADB's  prohibited  investment  activities  list,  (ii)  ensure that  investments  using  ADB \nfunds abide by applicable national laws and regulations, and (iv) comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009).  The  borrowers  will  confirm  this  in  their  periodic  report  to  ADB.  The \nTBC  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS)  complies  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. Given the small average size and caps on subloans, the ESMSs of Credo and \nFBG are adequate. FBG and Credo will improve their ESMSs before introducing small business \nlending  to  satisfy  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements.  All  transactions  are \nclassified  as  having  some  gender  elements.  Credo,  FBG,  and  TBC  will  comply  with  national \nlabor  laws,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy,13 and  will  take  measures  to  comply \nwith the internationally recognized  core labor standards. The borrowers will report regularly on \ntheir  compliance  with  such  laws  and  the  measures  taken.  Information  disclosure  and \nconsultation with affected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nB. \n \nCredo, FBG, and TBC were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international \n41. \npractice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB \nwill  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance. \n \nC. \n \n42. \ninvestment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n \n43. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter), 14  ADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the \nGovernment of Georgia has no objection to the proposed assistance to Credo, FBG, and TBC. \nADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, \nfollowing approval of the proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \n\nThe  proposed  loans  are  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nAssurances \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n44. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the (i) loan of up to \n$23,000,000  or  its  lari  equivalent  to  Credo  Microfinance  Organization,  (ii)  loan  of  up  to \n$7,000,000  or  its  lari  equivalent  to  FINCA  Bank  Georgia,  (iii)  subordinated  loan  of  up  to \n$50,000,000 or its euro or lari equivalents to TBC Bank; and (iv) loan of up to $50,000,000 or its \neuro  or  lari  equivalents  to  TBC  Bank,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  for  the  Financial \n\n                                                \n13  ADB. 2003.
