Environmental  implications  were  reviewed  and  no \nadverse environmental impacts identified. \n \nThe  program  loan  will  support  implementation  of  the  Poverty \nReduction  Program  outlined  under  the  development  partner-\nfunded Sixth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 6), as part \nof  the  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  (SEDP)  2006\u20132010  of \nthe  Government  of  Viet  Nam  (the  Government).  The  SEDP \nprovides a medium-term framework for this 5-year cycle of PRSC \noperations  that  comprises  poverty  reduction  policies,  programs, \nand  actions  with  specific  targets  for  development  outcomes  by \n2010.  \n \nThe  official  development  assistance  (ODA)  community  in  Viet \nNam  considers  the  PRSC  to  be  an  important  instrument  for \nsupporting  SEDP  implementation.  As  a  multisector  instrument \ncovering a range of issues related to poverty reduction, the PRSC \nframework  provides  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  with  an \nopportunity  to (i) advance and widen the national policy dialogue \nin  a  well-coordinated  and  comprehensive  manner,  (ii)  provide \nlending and nonlending assistance in coordination with other ODA \npartners,  and  (iii)  ensure  that  key  policy  issues  affecting  ADB \noperations  in  Viet  Nam  are  addressed  in  the  policy  dialogue \nbetween  the  Government  and  the  ODA  community  to  help \nachieve the common goal of poverty reduction and growth.  \n \nIn addition to ADB, the World Bank and other major ODA partners \nintend  to  contribute  both  financial  and  intellectual  resources  to \nPRSC  6.  ODA  partners  include  Australia,  Canada,  Denmark,  the \nthe \nEuropean  Commission,  Germany, \nNetherlands,  Spain,  and  the  United  Kingdom.  Switzerland,  while \nnot a financing partner, provided financial support for coordinating \nthe  process.  The  International  Monetary  Fund,  France,  and  the \nUnited  Nations  Development  Programme  participated  in  the \nPRSC policy dialogue.  \n \n\nIreland, \n\nJapan, \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProgram Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\nThe current cycle of PRSCs is a vehicle for the donor community \nto  stay  engaged  with  Viet  Nam,  and  has  delivered  outstanding \nperformance in terms of economic growth and poverty reduction in \nthe  previous  cycle.  The  PRSC  is  the  only  instrument  that  allows \ndonors to actively engage in supporting a comprehensive, cross-\ncutting  reform  agenda  in  Viet  Nam.  The  coherence  of  the \ncomprehensive reform program under the PRSCs, particularly the \nfundamental governance reforms, helps ensure  the effectiveness \nof sectoral interventions by ADB and other donors. Both economic \ngrowth and changes in the social environment have occurred at a \nrapid  pace  in  recent  years,  and  active  and  frequent  engagement \nthrough PRSCs should help improve the content of specific policy \nactions, ensure their timely adoption, and assist in monitoring the \nimpact of the overall program on broader development outcomes.   \n \nADB  has  been  actively  involved  in  formulating  PRSC  6,  and  has \npromoted  policy  dialogue  on  similar  issues  through  its  program \nlending activities and sector policy reforms. PRSC 6 complements \nADB\u2019s support of Viet Nam\u2019s policy and institutional reforms.  \n \nThe  proposed  loan  adheres  to  ADB\u2019s  recent  efforts  to  adopt \nprogram-based  and  sector  approaches  in  its  lending  operations, \nso  as  to  reduce  transaction  costs,  both  for  developing  member \ncountries and its own operations. The approach is consistent with \nADB\u2019s  reform  agenda, \nframework,  and \nmedium-term strategies I and II, and will directly help fulfill ADB\u2019s \nobligations to the Rome Declaration on harmonizing procedures of \nmultilateral  development  banks  (2003)  and  the  Paris  Declaration \non Aid Effectiveness (2005). \n \nThe  expected  impact  of  the  proposed  loan  is  to  reduce  poverty \nand  sustain  high  economic  growth  in  Viet  Nam.  The  proposed \nloan  will  help  fund  PRSC  6  and  thereby  (i)  reduce  structural \nweaknesses  and  improve  the  business  environment,  (ii)  promote \nsocial inclusion, (iii) protect natural resources, and (iv) modernize \ngovernance. \n \nSome  of  the  reforms  supported  by  the  PRSC  process  entail \nsubstantial  costs  to  be  financed  by  the  state.  Policy  measures \nsupported by the PRSC operations require additional spending.  \n \nThe  estimated  cost  of  some  specific  PRSC-related  measures  for \nthe  PRSC  6  implementation  period  is  approximately  $1,420 \nmillion, i.e.,  (i)  health care  funds  for  the poor\u2014about  $90  million, \n(ii) \nthe \nGovernment  budget\u2014about  $540  million,  (iii)  social  safety  net \n(SOE) \nprogram \nworkers\u2014about  $100  million,  and  (iv)  state-owned  commercial \nbank (SOCB) recapitalization\u2014about $690 million.  \n \n\nincreased  spending  on  education  proportional \n\nretrenched  state-owned  enterprise \n\nlong-term  strategic \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nto \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\n         iii \n\nA total of about $354 million for PRSC 6 operations is expected to \nbe  funded  through  ODA  resources.  The  World  Bank  has  already \napproved a $175 million credit from the International Development \nAssociation  to  support  PRSC  6.  Financing  partners  providing \nparallel  concessional  loans  include  ADB  ($15  million),  the  Japan \nBank for International Cooperation (\u00a53.5 billion), and Germany (\u20ac6 \nmillion).  Financing  partners  providing  grants  include  Agencia \nEspa\u00f1ola  de  Cooperaci\u00f3n  Internacional  (\u20ac5  million),  Australian \nAgency  for  International  Development  (A$10  million),  Canadian \nInternational  Development  Agency  (Can$7.5  million),  Danish \nInternational  Development  Agency  (DKr61  million),  European \nCommission  (\u20ac20  million),  Ireland  (\u20ac7.5  million),  Netherlands \nMinistry  of  Development  Cooperation  (\u20ac12  million),  and  United \nKingdom\u2019s  Department \n(\u20a420 \nmillion).  Swiss  Development  Cooperation,  while  not  a  financing \npartner  of  PRSC  6,  provided  financial  support  for  coordination  of \nthe process. \n \n\nInternational  Development \n\nfor \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  equivalent  to  $15  million  in  special  drawing  rights  from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  will  be  provided.  The  loan  will \nhave  a  24-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an \ninterest rate of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% during the \namortization period, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  loan  proceeds  may  be  used  to \nfinance eligible imports incurred within 180 days prior to the date \nof  loan  effectiveness.  The  loan  reflects  ADB\u2019s  support  for \nimplementation of the SEDP following the policy framework of the \nPRSC 6 program. The loan will contribute to financing adjustment \ncosts  resulting  from  implementation  of  the  policy  matrix  and  will \nsupport and  facilitate the Government\u2019s continued and deepened \nreform program for poverty reduction. \n \nThe loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon declaration of \nloan effectiveness. \n \nThe loan will be fully utilized by 31 December 2008. \n \nThe State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) will be the Executing Agency. \nSBV works in close collaboration with the World Bank to prepare \nand implement the PRSCs. \n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nDisbursement \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n \n\n \n\nimplementing \n\nin  developing  and \n\nThe Steering Committee was established in June 2007 to advise \nthe \nthe  Prime  Minister \nComprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  and \nPoverty  Reduction  Support  Credits  in  consistence  with  the \npurposes  of  the  Scioeconomic  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010., \nSuch committee is chaired by the deputy prime minister in charge \nof  economic  reforms,  and  consists  of  representatives  from \nrelevant line ministries and government agencies. An SBV deputy \ngovernor  and  a  vice  minister  of  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and \nInvestment  act  as  the  standing  vice  chairpersons.  To  represent \nPRSC  policy  reform  areas,  the  steering  committee  has  several \nrepresentatives from key economic ministries (e.g., the ministries \nof  agriculture  and  rural  development;  education  and  training; \nfinance;  foreign  affairs;  justice;  industry  and  trade;  and  labor, \ninvalids,  and  social  affairs;  and),  as  well  as  the  Office  of  the \nGovernment. \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  sources.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements  for  Program  Loans,  the  proceeds  of  the  program \nloan will be disbursed to Viet Nam as the Borrower.  \n \nNo supporting import documentation will be required, provided the \nvalue of Viet Nam\u2019s total imports minus imports from nonmember \ncountries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed  under  other \nofficial  development  assistance  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the \namount  of  the  loan  expected  to  be  disbursed.  The  Government \nwill  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  its  withdrawal \nrequest.  Otherwise, \nimport  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures  will  be  required.  ADB  will  have  the  right  to  audit  the \nuse of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower's \ncertification.  As  such,  the  procedures  for  procurement  and \ndisbursement of funds, and the use of counterpart funds, are felt \nto be satisfactory. \n \n\n\f         v \n\nthe \n\ninclude \n\nloan  will \n\nThe  proposed  loan  will  benefit  the  Vietnamese  people  in  four \nways. First, through policy actions designed to facilitate business \ndevelopment, \nincrease  efficiency,  accelerate \neconomic  growth,  and  create  jobs.  These  policy  actions  will  help \nimprove the regulatory framework for private sector development, \nand  enhance  transparency  and  accountability  in  SOE  operations \nand in banking. Second, policy actions addressing social inclusion \nwill  result  in  benefits  that  include  improved  quality  of  education, \nimproved access of the poor to health services, a reformed social \nprotection  system,  and  promotion  of  gender  equality.  Third, \nthrough policy actions addressing natural resources, the loan will \nhelp  secure  land  ownership  and  address  the  resettlement  and \ncompensation  process,  as  well  as  promoting  more  sustainable \nmanagement  of  natural  resources.  Fourth,  through  policy  actions \nincreased \naddressing  modern  governance,  benefits \ntransparency  and accountability of  public finances, and improved \nlegal  transparency  and  accessibility.  These  will  be  achieved \nthrough better coordination of plans and budgets, adoption of the \nmedium-term  expenditure  framework,  and  greater  accountability \nin public finance and public administration.  \n \nThere  are  three  potential  risks  associated  with  imbalances  that \nmay emerge as Viet Nam achieves greater global integration and \nmarket-orientation.  \n \nThe first potential risk is the vulnerability that stems from possible \nturbulence in the financial sector. The supervisory and regulatory \ncapacity  of  monetary  authorities  has  not  kept  pace  with  the \nexpansion  of  capital  markets.  The  second  risk  relates  to  the \nmassive  inflows  of  foreign  direct  investment  and  increased \ncompetition  in  formerly  protected  sectors.  This  change  may  test \nthe ability of Viet Nam to preserve social inclusion, and may cause \nsome  groups  to  lose  in  the  short  term.  The  third  possible  risk \ninvolves  potential  corruption  and  social  strife  related  to  rapid \nurbanization and infrastructure development.  \n \nThe Government is aware of  the potential risks, and will mitigate \nthese by considering and implementing appropriate measures and \nproactive programs during program implementation.  \n \nADB,  along  with  other  PRSC  financing  partners,  has  conducted \nanalytical  studies  to  help  policymakers  formulate  and  execute \nmitigating  and  corrective  measures  in  anticipation  of  these \npotential \nrisks.  These  corrective  measures  have  been \nincorporated  in  the  series  of  PRSCs,  which  include  this  program \nloan. \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n1. \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Support  the  Implementation  of  the  Poverty \nReduction Program IV (SIPRP IV). The program loan follows a program-based approach and is \npart  of  the  Sixth  Poverty  Reduction  Support  Credit  (PRSC  6),  jointly  processed  by  several \ndevelopment  partners,  in  support  of  implementation  by  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  (the \nGovernment)  of  the  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  (SEDP)  2006\u20132010.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework for the program loan is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\n2. \nOver the last 20 years, Viet Nam\u2019s economy has been  transformed significantly. It has \nbecome  one  of  the  fastest-growing  economies  in  Asia,  recording  average  annual  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth of 7.5% over the last decade. GDP per capita increased from \n$288  in  1993  to  $716  in  2006,  with  marginal  increase  in  inequality.  At  the  same  time,  the \npoverty incidence in the country declined sharply, from about 58.0% in 1993, to 28.9% in 2002, \nand 19.5% in 2004 (see Table A2.1 in Appendix 2).  \n \n3. \nEconomic  growth  in  Viet  Nam  has  been  largely  equitable.  Expenditure  inequality  (as \nmeasured  by  Gini  coefficient)  has  increased  only  marginally  during  the  1990s.  Nonetheless, \nsome  groups  have  benefited  less  and  are  vulnerable  to  social  and  economic  marginalization. \nThese  include  people  living  with  low  levels  of  human  capital,  ethnic  minorities,  and  to  some \nextent,  women.  Social  indicators  (such  as  school  enrollment  and  health  care)  are  lower  for \nthese groups. Low-income households face a vicious cycle of remaining poor due to difficulties \nin accessing health and education services, especially if user fees are involved.1 There are also \nconsiderable  disparities  in  poverty  and  poverty  reduction  across  regions.  The  northern \nmountains,  the  north  central  coast,  and  the  central  highlands  all  have  high  poverty  incidence \nrates (over 30%), which are substantially higher than in other regions. These regions are home \nto nearly 57% of the total poor population.2  \n \n4. \nThe  impressive  outcomes  of  simultaneous  continuing  high  economic  growth  and  rapid \npoverty  reduction  were  achieved  through  a  combination  of  sustained  business-led  growth  in \neconomic output and employment and government-led targeted poverty reduction interventions. \nThe  latter  include,  for  example,  programs  focusing  on  (i)  hunger  eradication  and  poverty \nreduction (Program 143); (ii) socioeconomic development in communes with extreme difficulties \n(Program 135); (iii) heath care for the poor (Program 139); (iv) compensation for job losses due \nto state enterprise reform (Social  Safety Net Fund); (v)  schooling at all levels, including adult-\nand-non-formal,  and  life-long  learning  (Education  for  All);  and  (vi)  helping    ethnic  minorities \ncatch up with the overall socioeconomic development (Advancing Ethnic Minorities). Viet Nam\u2019s \ntransition from central planning to a socialist-oriented market economic system has involved the \nliberalization of markets, recognition of private property rights, and a gradual opening up of the \neconomy  to  external  markets  for  trade  and  investment.  The  growth  of  the  private  sector  has \nbeen a significant feature of economic development. The structure of the economy is changing \nmarkedly, with a steady increase in the industrial and service sectors. Greater diversification in \nindustrial production and services is laying  the  foundations  for sustained growth in output and \nemployment. \n\n                                                 \n1 Asian Development Bank. 2006.

Hanoi: The National Political Publisher.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Objectives, Strategies, and Plans \n\nThe Government of Viet Nam is committed to poverty reduction and considers it to be an \n5. \noverarching  objective  in  its  national  socioeconomic  development  process.  Evidence  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment includes a series of strategic plans and documents, including the 10-\nYear Socioeconomic Development Strategy 2001\u20132010, the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction \nand  Growth  Strategy  (CPRGS)  2002\u20132006,  the  5-Year  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan \n(SEDP)  2001\u20132005,  and  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  The  SEDP  2006\u20132010  is  considered  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nnational strategy for poverty reduction and growth, which articulates the vision for Viet Nam to \nattain middle-income status by 2010. The SEDP is recognized as a blueprint for development, \nbecause  it  is  based  on  empirical  analysis  and  broad  consultation,  and  identifies  clear \ndevelopment  outcomes,  specifies  policies  to  attain  its  goals,  and  aligns  public  resources  to \nimplement these policies.  \n \nViet  Nam\u2019s  development  strategy  is  embodied  in  the  SEDP  2006\u20132010,  which  was \n6. \nendorsed by the National Assembly in June 2006. The SEDP is expected to be Viet Nam\u2019s new \nnational  strategy  for  poverty  reduction  and  growth.  Reducing  poverty  incidence  to  10\u201311%  by \n2010  is  an  overarching  goal  of  the  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  Its  aims  include,  among  others,  to  (i) \naccelerate  and  sustain  economic  growth  and  development;  (ii)  significantly  improve  people\u2019s \nmaterial,  cultural,  and  spiritual  life;  (iii)  create  the  foundations  to  boost  industrialization  and \nmodernization  and  to  gradually  develop  a  knowledge-based  economy;  and  (iv)  enhance  Viet \nNam\u2019s  status  in  the  region  and  the  world.  The  SEDP  has  a  strong  results-orientation,  with \nperformance  indicators  that  include  the  Viet  Nam  Development  Goals  (VDGs)  and  the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). The SEDP was prepared in an intensively participatory \nand  consultative  manner  with  substantive  inputs  from  a  broad  range  of  interest  groups.  The \nmain targets are specified to ensure sustainable development across the economy, society, and \nenvironment.  \n \n7. \nIn  the SEDP,  the  Government embraces reform actions  that  fall broadly into  four  main \nareas: (i) the promotion of growth and transition to a market economy; (ii) reducing poverty and \nensuring social inclusion; (iii) managing the environment and natural resources in a sustainable \nmanner;  and  (iv)  building  institutions  that  can  support  the  strategy.  The  first  three  pillars  are \nexplicitly  listed  in  the  SEDP,  while  the  fourth  is  introduced  in  the  monitoring  and  evaluation \n(M&E) framework. The fourth pillar is recognized as the foundation for making progress on the \nfirst  three.  Intended  reform  actions  under  the  four  pillars  will  be  carried  out  with  the  goal  of \nachieving middle-income status by end-2010. The Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank \nand  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  have  helped  develop  the  results-\nframework  and  M&E  framework  of  the  Government\u2019s  SEDP  in  close  collaboration  with  other \ndevelopment  partners.  Appendix  2  presents  details  on  the  SEDP  in  the  context  of  PRSC \noperations.  \n \n8. \nThe Government and development partners realize that the impressive gains in poverty \nreduction  realized  to  date  remain  fragile.  In  addition,  achieving  further  poverty  reductions  will \nbecome  increasingly  difficult,  as  gains  will  be  harder  to  realize  among  more  marginalized \ngroups. Providing services to rural poor and ethnic minorities who live in remote areas requires \nmore marginal resources. To help the poor in mountainous areas increase land use productivity, \nespecially productivity of forest land, the Government revised the Law on Forest Protection and \nDevelopment  in  2004  and  issued  the  related  Forest  Development  Strategy  (2006\u20132010)  in \nFebruary  2007,  providing  guidance  on  moving  toward  more  social  and  community-based \nforestry. The strategy recognizes the forest-use rights of households and communities and their \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nownership  of  plantation  forests.  The  issuance  of  such  strategies  is  one  of  the  policy  actions \nproposed in this program loan.  \n  \n9. \nAn  additional  factor  complicating  future  poverty  reduction  is  the  large  number  of  the \nnear-poor. A significant proportion of the population was just below the poverty line in 1993, and \nhad barely moved above the poverty line by 1998; they remain vulnerable to shocks that could \npush  them  back  below  the  poverty  line.  Future  challenges  include  (i)  allocating  additional \nresources, (ii) the ability to mobilize external resources, (iii) improved targeting of resources, (iv) \nenhanced  efficiency  by  making  social  services  more  demand  driven,  and  (v)  improved \nmonitoring systems that ensure benefits actually reach the poor. \n \n10. \nViet  Nam  became  a  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  member  in  January  2007,  and \nfurther  integration  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economy  into  the  global  and  regional  economy  will  help \nstimulate  structural  reforms  and  open  access  to  markets,  capital  and  technology,  resulting  in \nhigher economic productivity. Globalization and regional integration bring opportunities but also \nchallenges,  including  for  groups  employed  by  enterprises  that  are  no  longer  competitive,  and \nwhich consequently lose their jobs. The SEDP 2006\u20132010 has shifted the focus of priority areas \nfrom  basic  structural  reforms  to  more  complex  issues\u2014including  building  inclusive  and \nfinancially viable social insurance systems\u2014so as to respond to the needs of those negatively \nimpacted  by  global  integration  in  the  short  term.  The  National  Assembly  passed  the  Social \nInsurance Law in November 2006, which is one of the policy actions under this program loan. \nOther  priorities  of  the  SEDP  2006\u20132010,  which  are  also  priorities  of  the  PRSC  operations, \ninclude  (i)  strengthening  the  supervision  of  financial  markets,  (ii)  regulating  access  to  and \npricing  of  infrastructure  services,  (iii)  managing  natural  resources  and  protecting  environment, \nand (iv) increasing transparency and accountability at all levels.  \n \nB. \n \n11. \nViet Nam is one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia, recording an average annual \ngrowth  in  GDP  of  about  7.5%  over  the  last  decade.  Underpinned  by  rapid  growth  in  private \ninvestment,  strong  consumption  and  robust  exports,  GDP  growth  accelerated  to  8%  for  2006 \nand  an  estimated  8.3%  for  2007,3 above  its  trend  rate  of  the  last  10  years.  Demand  for  the \ncountry\u2019s  exports  of  commodities,  crude  oil,  and  manufactures  was  strong,  and  private \ninvestment  and  private  consumption  also  recorded  robust  growth.  Growth \nin  private \nconsumption  was  supported  by  rising  incomes  and  inward  remittances  of  about  $4  billion  in \n2006.    Increasing  consumption  is  partly  a  result  of  favorable  demographics,  as  Viet  Nam  has \none of youngest populations in Asia, with more than 65% of  the population below 30 years of \nage. Retail sales of goods and services increased by 20.9% in 2006 (about 13% after adjusting \nfor inflation), higher than the 16.9% average recorded over the previous 5 years.  \n \n12. \nExports  performed  strongly  in  2006,  rising  by  23.0%  in  nominal  US  dollar  terms, \ncompared  with  average  annual  growth  of  17%  from  2001\u20132005.  The  ratio  of  exports  to  GDP \nincreased  from  about  55%  in  2000  to  66%  in  2006,  indicating  the  openness  of  the  economy \neven before Viet Nam joined the  WTO in January 2007. The structure  of exports is becoming \nmore diversified; while unprocessed commodities such as crude oil, rice, marine products, and \nagriculture  products  remain  important,  the  share  of  manufactured  products  is  rising.  Robust \ndomestic demand, particularly from investment projects, caused imports to grow by 33.3%. As a \nconsequence, the trade deficit was estimated at $4.5 billion, equivalent to 8.7% of GDP in 2006. \nVigorous  expansion  in  both  private  remittances  and  tourism  receipts  helped  limit  the  current \n\nRecent Economic Performance \n\n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2007.

Buoyant foreign direct investment (FDI) \ninflows supported the balance of payments, resulting in a rise in gross international reserves to \n$11.5 billion, equivalent to 3.5 months of imports in 2006.  \n \n13. \nFrom the production side, the industry and services sectors contributed more than 90% \nof total GDP growth in 2006. Industry expanded by a robust 10.4%, slightly below the pace in \n2005. The services sector, supported by buoyant performance in trade, tourism, transportation, \ntelecommunications,  and  financial  services,  grew  by  an  estimated  8.2%,  higher  than  the \naverage of 2001\u20132005. Inflation remained high, exceeding 7% on average during 2006 for the \nthird year in a row. The high inflation rate was mainly a result of a jump in food prices caused by \nstrong  demand.  However,  the  inflation  rate  is  projected  to  decrease  in  2007  and  2008  due  to \nreduced tariff rates following WTO accession, and expected reductions in crude oil prices in the \nworld market.  \n \nThe overall fiscal deficit remained high in 2006 at 5.0% of GDP, slightly above the 4.8% \n14. \naverage  of  the  last  five  years  so  as  to  finance  the  required  infrastructure  investment.  Fiscal \nrevenues surpassed the planned target by 10%. Total revenue (excluding grants) stands at 24% \nof GDP. This increase was attributable to higher oil revenues (accounting for about 29% of total \nrevenue),  improvements  in  tax  administration,  and  the  growing  number  of  tax-paying \nbusinesses in the formal sector. Off-budget expenditures rose from 1.2% of GDP in 2004 to an \nestimated  2%  of  GDP  in  2006.  These  are  mainly  used  for  investment  in  infrastructure  and \neducation. Investment in infrastructure now exceeds 9% of GDP and is expected to reach 11% \nin  coming  years.  Off-budget  expenditures  are  subject  to  the  same  scrutiny  by  the  National \nAssembly as is budgetary spending.  \n \n15. \n Viet  Nam  is  a  moderately-indebted  country.  At  the  end  of  2006,  public  and  publicly-\nguaranteed  debt  was  an  estimated  45.5%  of  GDP  in  nominal  terms.  External  debt  was \nestimated at around 32% of GDP. In 2006, total debt servicing is estimated at 5.6%, down from \n6.7% in 2004. Viet Nam\u2019s external debt indicators remained below the applicable threshold.  \n \n\nTable 1: Major Economic Indicators, 2004\u20132008 \n(%) \n\nItem \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n \n2007e \n\n \n2008e \n\n \n\n \n\nGDP growth \nGross domestic investment/GDP \nInflation rate (average for the year)\nMoney supply (M2) growth \nFiscal balance/GDP \nMerchandise export growth \nMerchandise import growth \nCurrent account balance/GDP \nDebt service ratio \n(#) = negative, e = estimate, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: General Statistics Office, State Bank of Viet Nam, Ministry of Finance, International Monetary Fund, Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) estimates. \nADB. 2007.

In net present value \nterms, the debt increases from 28% of GDP in 2004 to about 29% of GDP and stabilizes over \nthe long term. The main risk to medium-term debt sustainability stems from contingent liabilities \nassociated  with  reform  of  state-owned  commercial  banks  (SOCBs).  Given  the  uncertainty \nsurrounding bank balance sheets, the debt sustainability assessment considers two alternative \nreform  scenarios,  associated  with  contingent  liabilities  of  8%  and  20%  of  GDP.  In  these  two \nscenarios, the net present value of public debt reaches peaks of 35% and 49% of GDP before \ndeclining  to  30%  and  33%  over  the  long  term.  The  assessment  will  be  updated  in  the  third \nquarter  of  2006  to  reflect  the  impact  of  the  investment  program  contemplated  in  the  SEDP \n2006\u20132010. In addition, IMF has provided a letter of assessment (Appendix 3).  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n1. \n\nProgress in Reducing Poverty \n\n17. \nIn aggregate terms Viet Nam\u2019s rapid progress in reducing poverty is unprecedented. No \nother country has reduced poverty incidence so much in such a short time.4 Data from the four \nViet Nam Household Living Standards Surveys (VHLSSs) conducted in 1993, 1998, 2002, and \n2004  reveal  that  Viet  Nam  has  achieved  remarkable  success  in  poverty  reduction  during  the \nperiod  of  1993\u20132004;  the  poverty  rate,  as  measured  by  per  capita  consumption,  has  dropped \nalmost  39  percentage  points  over  this  11-year  period.  The  poverty  rate  in  2004  was  one-third \nthe  1993  rate,  meaning  Viet  Nam  outperformed  the  United  Nations\u2019  Millennium  Development \nGoal  of  halving  extreme  poverty  over  a  25-year  period  (1990  to  2015).  The  pace  at  which \npoverty rates have fallen has accelerated remarkably over the last few years. The poverty gap5 \nindicates that those who are still in poverty are becoming less poor. In 1993, consumption of the \naverage poor person was equal to 68% of the poverty line; by 2004, it had climbed to 76%. The \nremarkable performance in terms of income and expenditure is also supported by outstanding \nsocial indicators: improvements in the net enrollment rate, health insurance coverage, access to \nelectricity, clean water, sanitation, and possession of numerous durable goods reflect significant \nimprovements in people\u2019s wellbeing. During this period relative inequality, as measured by the \nGini index for per capita expenditures, has shown a modest increase, from 0.33 in 1993 to 0.37 \nin 2004. This is comparable to other countries at a similar level of development.  \n \n18.  When poverty and inequality are examined at  disaggregate levels, however, significant \nvariation  in  progress  in  poverty  reduction  can  be  seen  across  different  segments  of  society. \nAlthough declines in poverty  have  been achieved  in all major segments of society, the rate of \ndecline has been slower in (i) rural areas than in urban areas, (ii) among most ethnic minority \ngroups in comparison to the majority group, and (iii) in some regions than in others. Poverty has \nbecome  largely  a  rural  phenomenon.  Three  out  of  eight  regions6 of  the  country  have  suffered \n\n                                                 \n4  Between 1990 and 2004, the percentage of the population living in poverty in Viet Nam fell by roughly 3 percentage \npoints per year, or twice the rate of the People\u2019s Republic of China (when measured by the benchmark of $1 per \nday, adjusted by purchasing power parity).  \n\n5  The poverty gap measures the depth of poverty. It shows the shortfall from the poverty line of expenditure by the \n\npoor, expressed as an average of all people in the population.  \n\n6  The eight regions of Viet Nam comprise the northeast, the northwest, Red River Delta, north central coast, south \ncentral  coast,  central  highlands,  southeast,  and  the  Mekong  River  Delta.  The  first  two  regions  combined  are \nconsidered the northern mountainous region.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nmost, with high poverty incidence and a poverty rate (in 2004) over 30%. In addition, the rate of \npoverty  reduction  has  varied  considerably  across  regions  from  1993  to  2004.  The  pace  of \npoverty  reduction  has  been  slowest  in  the  northwest,  and  this  region  remains  the  country\u2019s \npoorest, with a persistently high poverty incidence of 59%. The 2004 survey suggests that the \nnorth  central  coast  has  the  largest  pocket  of  poverty,  followed  by  the  northeast,  the  Mekong \nRiver Delta and the Red River Delta. Progress in poverty reduction among ethnic minorities is \nrelatively limited. During the 11-year period, the poverty rate for ethnic minorities fell from 86% \nto 61%, while the poverty rate for the majority Kinh-Hoa group fell from 54% to 14%. There is \nalso  significant  underperformance  by  ethnic  minorities  compared  to  the  majority  group  with \nregard  to  social  indicators.  Regional  and  ethnic  disparities  may  be  explained  by  the \ndisadvantaged living position of those involved, and a lack of regional convergence (footnote 2). \n \n19. \nAn understanding of the factors responsible for past achievements in poverty reduction \nwould  provide  guidance  for  future  policy  interventions.  There  is  consensus  that  poverty \nreduction  has  been  underpinned  by  rapid,  stable  and  inclusive  economic  growth.7 A  series  of \nfar-reaching  market  reforms  undertaken  in  the  1990s  and  early  2000s  has  resulted  in \nimprovements  in  the  geographic  and  occupational  mobility  of  labor,  enabling  people  to  take \nadvantage  of  better  income-generating  opportunities.  The  relatively  pro-poor  pattern  of  public \ninvestments and budget transfers, including national poverty-targeting programs (i.e., Program \n135 and Program 143) has led to improved access by the poor to education, health care, and \ninfrastructure.  Another  important  element  of  the  rapid  poverty  reduction  has  been  the \nredistribution of agricultural land to rural households. The allocation of land-use right certificates \n(LUCs) to lowland rural households amounted to a massive and egalitarian transfer of wealth. \nThis  resulted  in  a  dramatic  increase  in  agricultural  production  and  exports,  and  effectively \nhelped  millions  of  households  escape  poverty.  The  three  preceding  loans  (SIPRP  I,  II  and  III \nunder  the  PRSC  3\u20135  framework)  have  included  these  critical  policy  reforms.  Political  stability \nand  broad-based  growth  in  economic  output  and  employment  also  underpinned  poverty \nreduction. \n  \n20. \nThere  are  also  reasons  to  believe  that  Viet  Nam\u2019s  future  experience  with  poverty  may \ndiffer  somewhat  from  what  has  occurred  in  the  past.  The  current  distribution  of  incomes  and \nexpenditures  implies  that  a  higher  growth  rate  is  required  to  achieve  a  one-percentage-point \ndrop in poverty.  This calls for  further  strengthening of  the  existing national  targeting programs \non  poverty  reduction.  In  addition,  the  relatively  large  number  of  non-poor  people  whose \nconsumption is just above the poverty line level implies that protecting vulnerable people from \nfalling back into poverty is becoming increasingly important for the reduction of overall poverty. \nParticularly, vulnerable groups are now facing various shocks\u2014including communicable disease \noutbreaks,  natural disasters, and sharp dips in global agricultural commodity prices\u2014and may \nface these again in the future. The persistently high poverty incidence and depth among ethnic \nminority groups and some lagging regions is a big challenge for Viet Nam in the next five years. \nIn addition, new forms of poverty will emerge, caused in part by the process of urbanization. \n \n In light of these challenges, sustaining rapid poverty reduction over the next five years \n21. \nwill  require  a  combination  of  policy  measures,  including  an  acceleration  of  market-oriented \nreforms, and in particular an emphasis on development of the private sector to achieve higher \nefficiency. This would permit more rapid growth within resource constraints, as growth continues \nto be a main driver of poverty reduction. Innovative measures should also be used to enhance \n\n                                                 \n7   The  elasticity  of  poverty  reduction  has  been  higher  than  one,  e.g.,  a  per  capita  growth  rate  of  about  6%  was \nassociated  with  a  reduction  in  poverty  of  about  7%  for  1993\u20132002  (Vietnam  Development  Report  2004  and \nVietnam Poverty Update Report 2006).  \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\n2.  \n\nThe Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010  \n\nparticipation by the poor in economic growth. In addition, priority should be given to revamping \nand  strengthening  social  protection  mechanisms,  including  universal  systems  that  can  better \nprotect  the  poor  and  vulnerable  from  adverse  shocks,  in  light  of  intensified  international \nintegration.  \n \n22. \nVarious additional measures are required in addition to the current schemes supporting \nethnic  minorities.  These  include  (i)  more  unified  control  over  forest  land  under  the  district  and \ncommune authorities and (ii) improved transparency and equity in allocation of forest land and \nproduct usage rights. There is also a need for other innovative measures and interventions that \nbetter address the needs of the most disadvantaged ethnic minority groups and better take into \naccount their specific habits, customs, and culture.  \n \n \n \nThe  SEDP  was  finalized  and  approved  by  the  National  Assembly  in  June  2006.  The \n23. \nSEDP  was  prepared  with  support  of  the  development  assistance  community,  including  ADB, \nand  in  consultation  with  stakeholders  and  civil  society  (Appendix  2).  Implementation  of  the \nSEDP  policy  reform  agenda  has  been  undertaken  largely  through  the  Government\u2019s  own \nresources, supplemented by pooling of ODA grant and lending resources under the PRSC 6\u201310 \nframework. The PRSC framework was prepared by development partners in close consultation \nwith government agencies. SEDP 2006\u20132010 includes open discussions about disadvantaged \ngroups  and  regions  and  about  the  challenges  presented  by  the  emergence  of  a  growing  gap \nbetween  socioeconomic  groups.  Issues  of  social  inclusion  are  no  longer  restricted  to  the \ndiscussion of targeted programs but are instead tackled in the sectoral sections of the plan.  \n \n24. \nThe  Government  has  well-established  coordinating,  monitoring,  and  oversight \narrangements for poverty reduction programs funded by various ODA resources. The Steering \nCommittee  was  established  in  June  2007  to  advise  the  Prime  Minister  on  the  developing  and \nimplementing  of  the  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  and  Poverty \nReduction  Support  Credits  in  accordance  to  the  purposes  of  the  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  Such \nsteering committee is chaired by a deputy prime minister, with an SBV deputy governor and a \nvice minister of the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) as standing vice chairpersons. Its \nmembers  come  from  all  concerned  government  ministries  and  agencies.  The  steering \ncommittee guides implementation of the poverty reduction programs during PRSCs 6\u201310.8 The \nGovernment  undertakes  detailed  reviews  of  implementation  progress  of  the  PRSC  reform \nagenda, and discusses findings and emerging issues with its development assistance partners, \nusually at annual consultative group meetings.  \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1.  \n\nProblem/Constraints Analysis \n\n \n \nThe list of policy reforms considered by the SEDP 2006\u20132010 is remarkably broad. As \n25. \nthis program loan and its subsequent loans will support implementation of the SEDP, it is critical \nto prioritize and sequence those reforms. Supporting the PRSC reform agenda, which is based \non  the  SEDP  reform  agenda,  does  not  entail  favoring  one  of  the  four  pillars  over  the  others. \nInstead, balanced progress in all four pillars is critical for successful SEDP implementation. The \n\n                                                 \n8  This new steering committee was established to replace the original National Steering Committee, established in \n2002 for the purpose of implementing the poverty reduction programs under the CPRGS during the implementation \nof PRSCs 1\u20135. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nprioritization and sequencing exercise should be carried out so as to be selective within each of \nthe pillars. \n\n26. \nPRSC financing partners recognize that some of the needed reforms will be challenging, \nrequiring  attention  to  their  content  and  timeliness.  In  addition,  the  more  complex  post-WTO \naccession  requires  strong  cross-sectoral  coordination  to  implement  WTO  commitments  from \nboth  compliance  and  development  standpoints.  To  ensure  the  SEDP  is  a  sound  plan  that \ndelivers  growth  while  reducing  poverty,  the  Government  needs  to  continue  its  prudent \nmacroeconomic management and implement state sector reform without unnecessary delays.  \n \nThe policy actions under this PRSC were derived from a joint-donor analysis included in \n27. \nthe Viet Nam Development Report (VDR) 2007 that was published in December 2006.9 A small-\nscale technical assistance (TA) project (Support to the Implementation of the Poverty Reduction \nProgram  II),  approved  on  9  June  2005,  assisted  in  improving  the  quality  of  formulation  and \nimplementation  of  this  program  loan,  as  well  as  the  preceding  three  loans.  This  TA  provided \nresources to enhance the program\u2019s compliance with safeguard policies. Through this TA, ADB \nalso provided funding to organize a consultative workshop for the preparation of the VDR 2007 \n(in  November  2006),  as  well  as  a  PRSC  process  review  workshop  (the  PRSC  Stocktaking \nWorkshop held in October 2005). The policy actions under the subsequent PRSCs will also be \nrefined  based  on  results  from  subsequent  analytical  VDRs  that  will  be  published  annually  for \ndissemination at year-end consultative group meetings. Repeating the analytical and dialoguing \nprocess undertaken in the PRSC series will help ensure the content and timing of the numerous \nreforms that spread across multiple sectors is appropriate. The active engagement will provide \nthe  opportunity  for  all  stakeholders  to  identify  policy  actions  that  are  (i)  consistent  with \nnationally-owned  development  strategies  and  plans,  (ii)  sensible  from  an  economic  point  of \nview, (iii) capable of making a considerable difference in practice, and (iv) sufficiently specific to \nbe adopted and implemented relatively quickly. \n \n\n2. \n\nCountry Strategy and Program of the Asian Development Bank \n\n \nADB\u2019s goal is to help the Government reduce poverty incidence to 10\u201311% by 2010, in \n28. \nline  with  the  Government\u2019s  vision  in  the  SEDP.  The  results-based  approach  adopted  by  the \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  for  Viet  Nam  2007\u20132010 10 is  directly  linked  to \nsupporting the SEDP\u2019s targeted outcomes. The CSP indicates that Viet Nam is now facing the \nchallenge of improving its efficiency, as the investment to GDP ratio is already high by regional \nand  international  standards.  This  will  require  better  management  of  public  expenditure  and \nresources, including sustained efforts to control corruption. Increasing the private sector share \nof  total  investment  by  creating  an  enabling  environment  and  providing  infrastructure  will  also \nhelp increase investment efficiency and accelerate job creation.  \n \n ADB\u2019s country poverty assessment,11 which provided analytical inputs to the preparation \n29. \nof both the CSP and the previous PRSC, indicated that although economic growth in Viet Nam \nhas  benefited  most  of  society,  some  groups  have  benefited  less  than  others.

VDRs  serve  to  coordinate  views  on  what  the  reform \nchallenges are and how to address them, and have a considerable impact on the policy debate and the research \nagenda at the country level. The recent VDRs were prepared in partnership by PRSC cofinanciers, including ADB, \nwith substantive inputs on Viet Nam\u2019s development goals from Vietnamese policymakers and academics.  \n\n10  ADB. 2006.

The CSP identifies the key strategies \nfor  reaching  the  poor  in  the  coming  years  by  (i)  mobilizing  and  allocating  more  resources,  (ii) \nimproving the targeting of resources, (iii) enhancing efficiency by making social services more \ndemand-driven,  and  (iv)  improving  monitoring  systems  to  ensure  that  benefits  reach  the  poor. \nAchieving  further  reductions  in  poverty  is  expected  to  be  more  challenging,  requiring  targeted \nefforts to reach more remote rural areas.  \n \n \n \n\nLessons  \n\n3. \n\na. \n\nLending Modality \n\n30. \nAccording  to  the  2001  special  evaluation  report  on  program  lending  by  the  Operations \nEvaluation  Department  (OED),  the  program\u2019s  lending  modality  is  a  welcome  alternative  to \ntypical  program  loans,  which  are  generally  limited  to  two-tranche  programs.  The  report \nrecommended that multiple and floating tranches could effectively provide flexibility in meeting \nand  preserving  incentives  for  policy  changes,  in  remaining  engaged,  and  in  adopting  a  long-\nterm outlook.12 The innovative lending modality for the PRSCs is also referred to in the recent \nOED study Good Practices for the Evaluation of Policy-Based Lending by Multilateral Banks.13  \n \n31.  While this program loan is processed as a single-tranche program loan, it is actually part \nof  a  multiple-tranche  program  loan  series  (PRSCs  6\u201310)  supporting  implementation  of  the \nSEDP  2006\u20132010.  The  lending  modality  for  the  PRSCs  is  (i)  based  in  part  on  past \nachievements,  in  that  all  policy  actions  have  been  achieved  before  loan  approval,  with  loan \nproceeds  to  be  disbursed  immediately  upon  loan  effectiveness,  to  finance  adjustment  costs \narising  from  agreed  reforms;  and  (ii)  forward-looking,  in  that  each  annual  PRSC  contains \nagreements on policy triggers considered a critical bridge between the current and next PRSC. \nPolicy triggers are policy reforming trends that are expected to evolve substantively during the \nsubsequent PRSC. Policy triggers are not intended to be stated in the manner of conventional \npolicy conditions, thus allowing for refinement of exact progress, according to the Government\u2019s \nreadiness to embark on such reform. (Appendix 2 indicates the policy areas considered critical \nfor the next PRSC operation by PRSC stakeholders.) \n \n32. \nThe  PRSCs  complement  rather  than  replace  other  initiatives  of  ADB,  the  World  Bank, \nand  other  development  partners.  They  complement  other  analytical  studies,  policy  dialogues, \nand  programs  and  projects,  and  vice  versa.  Following  ADB\u2019s  participation  as  one  of  the \nfinancing partners to PRSCs 3, 4 and 5 in the first 5-year PRSC cycle, ADB has confirmed its \nplan to participate in the current cycle. The program loans to support PRSCs 6\u201310 are included \nin  the  country  strategy  and  program  for  2007\u20132010.  The  coexistence  of  ADB  sector-specific \nprogram  loans  and  the  PRSCs  is  seen  as  leveraging  ADB\u2019s  development  efforts  in  Viet  Nam \nwith  other  stakeholders.  PRSC  operations  also  provide  a  complementary  forum  to  aid \nharmonization in the country\u2019s development agenda.  \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2001.

(Available: \n\nhttp://www.adb.org/Evaluation/r-pbl.pdf.) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nb. \n\nLessons from Previous PRSC Cycles \n\nThe  main  contribution  of  PRSCs  has  been  their  ability  to  serve  as  a  platform  for  a \n33. \ncontinued  policy  dialogue  with  key  government  counterparts  on  a  broad  range  of  issues. \nHowever,  given  the  encompassing  nature  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  reform  program  generally,  and  of  the \nCPRGS agenda in particular, progress was not even across all policy areas.  Identifying strong \nand weak areas in policy making is essential to ensure the sustainability of this effort over time. \nStarting  with  PRSC  3,  a  set  of  indicators  covering  a  broad  range  of  policy  areas  was  used  to \nassess progress, but these indicators may need revision. Both the previous 5-year plan and the \nCPRGS lacked a monitoring and evaluation framework, with indicators instead derived from the \ntext of those documents and from other relevant sectoral strategies and policy statements. \n \n34. \nOverall, progress was slower in those policy areas characterized by limited political will, \nconflicting institutional responsibilities or insufficient analysis. The speed at which progress was \nmade  across  policy  areas  within  each  pillar  depended  on  the  political  will  to  implement  the \nreforms.  The  contrast  between  the  rapid  progress  achieved  in  integrating  with  the  world \neconomy and the slow pace of reform in the banking sector is revealing in this respect. To some \nextent,  this  contrast  may  reflect  a  deliberate  choice,  in  which  rapid  movement  towards  WTO \naccession  would  make  inevitable  the  need  for  subsequent  banking  sector  reforms.  In  other \ncases  (e.g.,  water)  limited  progress  reflects  institutional  overlap  and  unclear  delineation  of \nresponsibility  across  several  ministries  or  agencies.  In  the  case  of  corruption,  there  is  an \nundeniable  commitment  to  battle  corruption,  but  it  is  recent,  and  in  such  instances  progress \nmade on inputs (such as laws, or coordinating bodies) may take considerable time to translate \ninto progress on outputs and outcomes. Specifics aside, when policy areas are classified on the \nbasis  of  progress  the  results  are  consistent  with  the  ratings  prepared  for  the  country \nperformance  assessment  (CPA).  Those  ratings  are  above  the  regional  average  in  relation  to \nmacroeconomic  management  and  social  inclusion,  and  below  the  average  in  relation  to  the \nfinancial sector, labor and social protection, and transparency and anticorruption. \n\n35. \nIdentification  and  sequencing  of  a  comprehensive  PRSC  reform  agenda  covering  the \nmedium term requires strong analytical work. The VDR 2007, co-signed by 16 donors, provides \nthe  main  analytical  underpinnings  for  the  current  5-year  PRSC  cycle.  The  preparation  of  this \nreport,  entitled  Aiming  High,  started  shortly  after  approval  of  the  SEDP  by  the  National \nAssembly. The report was submitted to the consultative group meeting of December, 2006 as a \ncontribution by the international community to implementation of the SEDP. The report built on \nthe analytical work done over the previous PRSC cycle on structural reforms (as summarized in \nthe  VDR  2006,  Business),  institutional  modernization  (VDR  2005,  Governance)  and  on  social \ninclusion  (VDR  2004,  Poverty).  ADB  has  actively  participated  in  formulating  VDR  2007  by \ncontributing extensive written inputs and comments. Lessons from previous PRSCs and similar \nprograms  suggest  that  conducting  joint  analytical  work  between  development  partners  is \nimportant, along with wide consultation with academia, civil society, and the Government. The \ndevelopment partners and academia can assist the Government in terms of analytical tools and \nsharing  of  international  experience.  The  multiple-tranche  program  loan  approach  could  be \neffective in  providing flexibility in meeting and preserving incentives for policy changes, and in \nmaintaining  ongoing  engagement,  with  a  longer-term  outlook  than  the  usual  two-tranche \nprogram loan.  \n \n\nc. \n\nAsian Development Bank Policy-Based Lending \n\n36. \nLessons from the experience of previous program loans and postevaluation studies are \nthat  (i)  continued  government  ownership  and  commitment  are  fundamental  to  achieving \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\ndevelopment outcomes; (ii) monitoring and evaluation should be based on both process (inputs \nand outputs) and outcome indicators; (iii) outcome indicators will depend on successful follow-\non actions, as (a)  passage of a decree or law alone will not produce any meaningful results if \nthe  law  is  not  brought  into  effect  (which  requires  regulations,  circulars,  etc.),  and  (b)  properly \nenforced (requiring institutional capabilities); and (iv) sector or subsector-based program loans \nhave limited scope to address economy-wide policy and institutional issues. \n \n\n4. \n\nJustification for the Sixth Poverty Reduction Support Credit  \n\nthe  business  environment,  (ii)  making  development  socially \n\n \n37. \nPRSC  6  addresses  three  key  areas  of  macro  policy  and  institutional  reforms  for  (i) \nsupporting  the  transition  to  a  market  economy  by  removing  structural  weaknesses  and \nimproving \ninclusive  and \nenvironmentally friendly, and (iii) modernizing governance and the public administration system. \nThe  policy  actions  identified  in  the  PRSC  6  policy  matrix  are  built  on  the  reform  measures \nachieved  under  previous  PRSCs.  The  preparation  of  PRSC  6  was  built  on  the  strong \ncommitment by the ODA community to (i) support Viet Nam\u2019s reform agenda through nationwide \nimplementation  of  the  SEDP,  and  (ii)  galvanize  interest  for  the  reform  program  among \nstakeholders.  Development  partners  have  increasingly  united  around  the  PRSC  as  an \ninstrument for policy dialogue. They have been actively involved in supporting implementation of \nthe reform agenda, analytical work, technical assistance, project lending, and program lending \nor  grant  support.  The  rationale  for  providing  financial  support  under  PRSC  6  comes  from  the \nexternal financing needed to cover the cost of reform adjustments. The policy actions supported \nby  the  PRSC  process\u2014including  recapitalization  of  SOCBs,  operation  of  a  safety  net  for \nworkers  who  become  redundant  as  a  result  of  SOE  restructuring,  expansion  of  budget \nappropriations  for  the  education  sector,  and  creation  of  provincial  health  care  funds  for  the \npoor\u2014entail a substantial additional cost to the Government.  \n \n38. \nJustification  for  PRSC  6  is  grounded  on  three  criteria:  (i)  prudent  macroeconomic \nmanagement to ensure that progress on the long-term reform agenda will not be undermined by \nshort-term instability; (ii) the Government\u2019s own assessment of progress accomplished in SEDP \nimplementation; and (iii) the strategic reform actions for PRSC 6, which were identified based on \nanalytical input, and have been complied with.  \n \n39. \nIMF\u2019s  assessment  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economic  performance  confirms  the  country\u2019s \nimpressive overall record of economic performance in 2006 and broadly favorable prospects for \n2007  (Appendix  3).  Based  on  the  joint  assessment  by  the  World  Bank  and  IMF,  the  SEDP  is \nfiscally  sustainable,  despite  the  high  level  of  investment  associated  with  the  development  of \nlarge-scale  infrastructure.  The  baseline  scenario  of  the  most  recent  debt  sustainability \nassessment (DSA) is broadly in line with the investment and growth outlook of the SEDP. The \nDSA estimates that public and publicly-guaranteed debt will increase from nearly 44% of GDP in \n2005 to about 51% by 2011. This increase is still considered manageable, as more than half will \nremain  on  highly  concessional  terms.  In  addition,  external  debt  (both  public  and  private)  is \nprojected to decline from over 32% to under 31% of GDP. Viet Nam should thus remain at low \nrisk of external debt distress.14   \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n14  World  Bank.  2007.  International  Development  Association  Program  Document  for  a  Proposed  Credit  to  the \n\nSocialist Republic of Vietnam for a Sixth Poverty Reduction Support Operation. Washington, DC (23 May).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n5. \n\nRationale for the Proposed Program Loan \n\n \n40. \nThe ODA community in Viet Nam considers the PRSC to be an important instrument for \nsupporting  SEDP  implementation.  As  a  multisector  instrument  covering  a  range  of  issues \nrelated  to  poverty  reduction,  the  PRSC  framework  provides  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to  (i) \nadvance  and  widen  the  national  policy  dialogue  in  a  well-coordinated  and  comprehensive \nmanner; (ii) provide lending and nonlending assistance in coordination with other ODA partners; \nand (iii) ensure that key policy issues affecting ADB operations in Viet Nam are addressed in the \npolicy dialogue between the Government and the ODA community, to help achieve the common \ngoal of poverty reduction and growth. \n \n41. \nEleven  major  ODA  partners  have  planned  to  provide  financial  assistance  under  the \nPRSC 6 framework (Appendix 5). All financing partners participated in PRSC 6 preparation and \nare  actively  involved  in  those  policy  areas  where  they  have  strengths.  Given  the  many  active \ndevelopment partners in Viet Nam, several financing partners are involved in the same reform \nsectors.  However,  certain  financing  partners  may  have  greater  comparative  advantage  in  a \nsubsector than others. For example, within the financial sector, the World Bank and Japan Bank \nfor  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  specialize  in  banking  reforms,  while  ADB  specializes  in \nnonbanking reforms. ADB has participated in policy dialogue related to many reform sectors in \ncomparison  with  other  development  partners.  PRSC  6,  which  has  a  national  economy-wide \nreform  agenda,  complements  these  ADB-assisted  activities  (Appendix  2,  Figure  A2.1).  In \naddition,  ADB  staff  have  actively  participated  in  PRSC  policy  dialogue  with  other  financing \npartners, thus ensuring synergy between the PRSC multisector policy actions and ADB sector-\nbased programs and projects. This allows ADB to verify that PRSC 6 conditions do not conflict \nwith  policy  conditions  under  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  sector  loans.  In  fact,  ADB\u2019s  participation  in  this \ndialogue enables it to influence the reform agenda in a way  that complements ADB\u2019s ongoing \nsector loans, because the PRSC provides a clear picture of ADB\u2019s intervention as part of and in \nrelation to the aggregated efforts of all of Viet Nam\u2019s development partners.  \n \n42. \nThe proposed program is expected to lead to substantial improvements in development \noutcomes. The current PRSC cycle covers the same 5-year implementation period as that of the \nSEDP. The targeted development outcomes under this PRSC cycle have been clearly identified \n(Appendix  6),  as  the  PRSC  process  has  been  supported  by  a  series  of  comprehensive \nanalytical reports underlining the formulation and implementation of previous PRSCs under the \npast  5-year  cycle.  The  analytical  reports  have  helped  both  the  Government  and  development \npartners strategically identify and adjust policy actions adopted under the program. These major \nanalytical  reports  include  the  annual  VDRs,  which  provide  crucial  information  and  analysis \nregarding focal issues relevant to the Government\u2019s reform agenda.  \n \n43. \nTo  reduce  the  transaction  costs  of  this  rather  complex  operation  for  both  the \nGovernment and the participating development partners, the proposed loan pursues a program-\nbased approach. This approach is in line with ADB\u2019s recent move and practices toward adopting \nprogram-based and sector approaches in its lending operations to reduce transaction costs for \nits  developing  member  countries  as  well  as  for  its  own  operations.  The  approach  is  not  only \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  reform  agenda,15 Long-Term  Strategic  Framework,16 and  Medium-Term \nStrategy  II, 17 but  also  will  directly  help  fulfill  ADB\u2019s  obligations  to  the  Rome  Declaration  on \n\n                                                 \n15  President Chino\u2019s memo of 25 August 2004 entitled Today: Achieving Results Together.  \n16 ADB.  2001.

VDR  2007,  which  is  an  analytical  report  underlining  the  design  of \nPRSCs 6\u201310, was jointly prepared by 16 development partners and finalized in December 2006. \nAll  PRSC  6  financing  partners  participated  in  the  drafting  of  the  VDR  2007.  ADB  staff  have \nactively  participated  in  several  rounds  of  policy  dialogue  to  refine  the  program  loan\u2019s  policy \nmatrix along with other donors and the Government.  \n \n45. \nADB\u2019s  own  projects  and  studies  have  contributed  to  several  of  the  policy  actions \nincluded  in  the  program  loan\u2019s  policy  matrix  (Appendix  4)  including,  among  others,  the  use  of \nshare  auctions  as  the  main  mechanisms  for  equitization  (Financial  Sector  Program  Loan  II \n(FSPL  II)  and  the  preparatory  TA  for  preparing  FSPL  III);  reduction  of  processing  time  and \nrationalization  of  fee  structures  for  business  registration  (Small  and  Medium  Enterprise \nDevelopment  Program  Loan  (SDPL)  and  the  preparatory  TA  for  preparing  SDPL  II; \nestablishment  of  consultative  mechanisms  to  streamline  licenses  (SDPL);  clarification  of \ncontract specifications, investor qualifications and treatment of proposals for build-own-transfer \nproject (a sector study on public-private partnership); adoption of the human immunodeficiency \nvirus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome  law  and  preparation  of  action  plans  to  scale-up \nharm  reduction,  fight  stigma  and  discrimination  (Health  Care  in  the  Central  Highland  Loan); \nunification of legal frameworks to address gender disparities and increase women\u2019s participation \nin  decision  making  (TA  Supporting  the  Preparation  of  the  Law  and  Gender  Equality);  and \ndisclosure  of  the  results  of  inspections  against  corruption  for  cases  overseen  by  the \nGovernment Inspectorate (TA Capacity Building Support to Government Inspectorate).  \n \nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe program loan aims to provide support to Viet Nam\u2019s policy and institutional reforms \n46. \nthat  seek  to  maintain  high  growth  and  reduce  poverty.  The  outcomes  envisaged  include \nnumerous  development  targets  that  reduce  structural  weaknesses,  promote  socially  inclusive \ndevelopment,  protect  natural  resources,  and  modernize  governance  and  public  administration \n(Appendix  1)  by  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  program  under  the  policy \nframework of PRSC 6. To reduce poverty and sustain rapid economic growth, the program loan \nwill  strengthen  Viet  Nam\u2019s  reform  program  through  40  policy  actions,  12  of  which  are  tranche \nrelease  conditions  for  the  loan.  The  policy  matrix  is  presented  in  Appendix  4  and  the \ndevelopment  policy  letter  in  Appendix  7.  Supplementary  Appendix  B  provides  additional \ninformation on supporting documents demonstrating that all of the policy actions have already \nbeen complied with. The program\u2019s Summary Poverty Impact Assessment elaborates the effect \nof this program loan to the poor, and is presented in Appendix 8. The policy matrix comprises \npolicy measures that can be categorized into four reform pillars: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPillar  I:  business  development.  Promote  global  integration  to  improve  the \neconomy\u2019s  efficiency  and  resource  allocation,  enhance  transparency  and \naccountability  in  state  and  financial  sectors,  and  strengthen  the  regulatory \nframework  for  private  sector  and  infrastructure  development  to  create  an \nenabling business environment and improved livelihoods for the poor.  \nPillar  II:  social  inclusion.  Advance  human  development  by  upgrading  the \nquality  of  education,  promoting  inclusive  education  for  disadvantaged  children, \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nimproving access by the poor to health services, helping secure social protection \nfor the population, and promoting gender equality.   \nPillar  III:  natural  resources.  Encourage  important  policy  measures  leading  to \nmore  sustainable  management  of  natural  resources,  including  the  protection  of \nland, forests, water and the environment.  \nPillar IV: modern governance. Increase transparency and accountability of the  \nplanning  process,  public  financial  management,  and  public  administration, \nimprove  legal  transparency  and  accessibility  as  part  of  a  broader  effort  to  build \nmodern governance; and fight corruption.  \n\n \nThe possible approaches to mitigate potential risks in attaining the program\u2019s outcomes include \n(i)  upgrading  of  policies  related  to  the  banking  sector,  the  securities  market  and  the \nmanagement of public debt; (ii) improving data availability and analytical work on issues arising \nfrom  rural-urban  disparities;  and  (iii)  making  rapid  improvements  in  transparency  at  various \nlevels. The potential risks and their mitigating measures will be discussed in detail in Section V \n(Program Benefits, Impacts, Assumptions, and Risks).  \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n47. \nThe program loan\u2019s outputs include (i) policy advisory services by all PRSC participants \nto  assist  the  Government  in  formulating  and  implementing  the  reform  policies;  (ii)  laws, \nregulations,  and  policies  that  are  conducive  to  reforms  under  the  program  framework;  (iii) \namendment or strengthening of laws, regulations, and policies; (iv) action plans and strategies \nthat  are  strategically  important  for  attaining  targeted  development  outcomes;  and  (v)  self-\nassessments and sector studies that are of strategic importance. These were achieved through \n40 policy actions in the program\u2019s policy matrix. The following paragraphs will elaborate in detail \ncertain  outputs  achieved  under  the  reform  program  through  the  strategic  and  critical  policy \nactions under the program framework.  \n \n1. \n \n \n \n48. \nGlobal  Integration.  The  most  important  PRSC  6  policy  actions  in  relation  to  global \nintegration  were  the  granting  of  trading  and  distribution  rights  to  all  foreign  firms,  in  line  with \ninternational  commitments,  and  the  issuance  of  regulations  and  adequate  enforcement \nmechanisms  to  guide  the  intellectual  property  law.  The  trend  in  the  area  of  global  integration \nhas shifted from reducing barriers to trade in goods towards increased competition in services \nand considerable legal reform. This trend was boosted (on a multilateral as opposed to bilateral \nbasis) through Viet Nam\u2019s WTO accession in January 2007.  \n\nPillar I: Business Development  \n\n49. \nSOE Reform. Significant progress in SOE reform occurred between mid-2006 and mid-\n2007,  in  the  form  of  additional  divestiture  and  better  performance  monitoring.  The  number  of \nsectors in which 100%  state  ownership  is  to be retained  was further  reduced (from 29  to 19), \nand  the  remaining  activities  are  primarily  strategic  in  nature.  This  should  lead  to  more  SOEs \nbeing  divested,  with  share  auctions  now  utilized  as  the  main  mechanism  for  equitization,  and \nthe participation of foreign strategic investors allowed. Although the state still retains a share of \nthe  capital  in  many  sectors  and  enterprises,  additional  steps  have  been  taken  to  ensure  that \nthese  are  managed  efficiently.  All  SOEs  are  now  classified  according  to  their  performance\u2014 \nbased on their  turnover, profitability, servicing of debts and  compliance with  the law\u2014with  the \nclassification  results  published.  In  addition,  the  exercise  of  ownership  rights  on  behalf  of  the \nstate  is  being  transferred  from  line  ministries  and  provincial  governments  to  the  State  Capital \nInvestment Corporation (SCIC), a for-profit organization under the Prime Minister. This transfer \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\nof ownership should resolve the conflict of interest that ministries and provinces formerly faced \nwhen  formulating  and  implementing  policies  that  affected  the  enterprises  they  ran.  This  also \nenables  a  shift  away  from  administrative  management  towards  commercially  oriented \nmanagement  of  SOEs.  Corporate  governance  at  the  equitized  SOEs  is  also  expected  to  be \nimproved.  The  former  holdings  of  line  ministries  and  agencies  in  nearly  200  equitized  SOEs \nwere  transferred  to  SCIC.  This  has  resulted  in  improved  corporate  governance,  as  SCIC \noperation is more commercially oriented. By 2006, the number of equitized SOEs totaled 3,060. \nThere were over 2,100 remaining SOEs, including 335 public utility companies and 295 public \nfarms. The Government plans to equitize 1,500 additional SOEs by end-2010. The Government \nalso  accelerated  the  equitization  of  over  71  general  corporations,  with  20  scheduled  to  be \nequitized  in  2007.  A  number  of  large  general  corporations\u2014including  four  state-owned \ncommercial banks, telecommunication companies such as Viet Nam Mobile Telecom Services \nCompany (MobiFone), VinaPhone Telecoms Operator Service Company (VinaFone), and Hanoi \nand  Saigon  Brewery  Companies\u2014are  preparing  their  initial  public  offerings  (IPOs).  Overall, \nequitization  helps improve  the performance of enterprises.  A survey of 550 equitized SOEs  in \n2005 showed that 90 percent of the companies reported improved financial performance, with \nincreases  in  sales  of  13%  and  profit  increases  of  nearly  10%.  Salaries  of  employees  in  those \ncompanies also increased.18  \n \n50. \nThe Government has requested ADB to provide assistance in (i) accelerating the pace of \nSOE  reform,  including  equitization  and  listing  on  the  stock  exchange;  and  (ii)  promoting \ndevelopment  of  a  market-based  and  internationally  competitive  corporate  sector  by  providing \nlong-term finance. A preparatory TA project and two subsequent program loans on SOE reform \n(SOE  Reform  and  Corporate  Governance  Facilities  I  and  II)  are  included  in  Viet  Nam  CSP \n2007\u20132010.  \n\nFinancial  Sector  Reform. An important policy action under the previous program loan \n51. \nwas adoption of the ambitious banking reform strategy, which established a deadline of 2010 for \nequitization  of  state-owned  commercial  banks.  This  program  loan  now  focuses  on  the \nimplementation of a strategy aiming to strengthen the commercial orientation of SOCBs, which \nstill dominate the market, based on the assumption that regulation and technical upgrades alone \nwould  not  be  sufficient  to  overcome  the  interference  of  non-commercial  objectives  in  lending \ndecisions,  especially  at  the  provincial  level.  Introducing  private  capital  in  SOCBs,  with  the \nparticipation of strategic foreign investors with recognized resources and expertise, was seen as \nnecessary to accomplish this transformation. The program loan\u2019s policy actions under PRSC 6 \nprepared  the  ground  for  the  equitization  of  two  SOCBs,  including  one  of  the  largest,  over  the \nnext  year.  The  equity  stake  allowed  to  foreign  strategic  investors  was  increased,  while  all \nSOCBs were required to disclose their financial statements in line with internationally accepted \nstandards.  \n\n52. \nPrivate  Sector  Development.  Policies  to  support  the  development  of  the  already \nvibrant  private  sector  remain  centered  around  the  removal  of  administrative  barriers  to  entry. \nThrough  this  program  loan,  processing  time  was  reduced  and  the  fee  structure  for  business \nregistration  was  rationalized.  The  authority  to  issue  investment  certificates  was  clarified,  more \ndetails  were  provided  on  sectors  where  investment  is  conditional,  and  the  documentation  for \ninvestment registration or evaluation was standardized. A consultative mechanism to streamline \nlicenses  and  oversee  the  implementation  of  a  new  investment-enterprise  regime  was \nestablished, and guidelines and options were issued for foreign investors to transition to such   a \n\n                                                 \n18 National Assembly. 2006. SOE Reform Report to the National Assembly 2006. Hanoi. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nregime. The single-window mechanism for businesses was adopted in selected provinces and \ncovers registration, tax, and seal formalities. A monitoring mechanism to assess the constraints \nfaced  by  businesses  was  set  up  in  parallel,  under  the  form  of  an  investment  climate  module \nattached to the enterprise survey, which is conducted every two years. The sample used for this \nmodule is representative at the provincial level, facilitating comparisons of business friendliness \nacross local authorities. \n\n53. \nInfrastructure.  Mechanisms  are  being  set  up  to  increase  the  efficiency  of  public \nresources and the volume of private funding. In relation to public resources, the decentralization \nof investment ownership should lead to a better integration of capital and recurrent budgets in \nthe road transport sector. About 40 projects will be transferred to the Viet Nam Roads Authority, \nwhich previously was responsible only for the maintenance budget. The transfer of investment \nownership is expected to strengthen the Ministry of Transport\u2019s oversight function by separating \nits former dual role as project owner and supervisor. The adoption of wastewater charges based \non  cost  recovery  should  also  contribute  to  the  sustainability  of  investments  in  water  and \nsanitation.  This  measure  is  accompanied  by  appropriate  caps  to  protect  the  poor.  The \nmobilization  of  private  funding  for  infrastructure  projects  should  be  facilitated  by  the  newly \nissued  build-operate-transfer  decree,  which  clarifies  contract  specifications, \ninvestor \nqualifications and treatment of unsolicited proposals. \n\nPillar II: Social Inclusion  \n\n \n2. \n \nEducation.  The  government  strategy  expanded  coverage  of  high-quality  schooling  at \n54. \nlower levels with competition and incentives for excellence at higher levels. While the coverage \nof primary education has continued to expand, quality remains an issue, with children in poorer \nareas being at a disadvantage. Fundamental quality standard levels for schools were introduced \nunder  the  previous  PRSC  cycle,  and  a  key  policy  action  under  this  program  loan  extends \nperformance standards for primary teachers nationwide. The implementation of such standards \nwill rely on evidence-based assessments of teacher performance, as opposed to diplomas and \nseniority. In addition, transparent criteria for university admission quotas have been adopted on \na pilot basis. \n\n55. \nHealth.  A  fundamental  transformation  in  the  government\u2019s  approach  to  HIV/AIDS  has \ntaken  place  in  recent  years  and  is  now  being  consolidated.  Risky  behaviors\u2014including  the \npractice  of  commercial  sex  and  the  use  of  intravenous  drugs\u2014were  traditionally  labeled  as \n\u201csocial  evils\u201d,  often  resulting  in  stigma  and  discrimination  for  the  affected  populations.  That \napproach  changed  considerably  under  the  previous  cycle,  with  a  new  strategy  emphasizing \nprevention  and  treatment  over  repression.  This  public  health  approach  is  reflected  in  the \nHIV/AIDS law passed in June 2006 and the subsequent preparation of a comprehensive set of \naction  plans  to  expand  harm  reduction.  These  action  plans  foresee  the  introduction  of  needle \nexchange and methadone substitution programs.  Meanwhile, an effort  was undertaken across \nthe  health  sector  as  a  whole  to  improve  the  budgetary  balance  between  health  infrastructure, \nhuman resources, subsidies and preventive care.  \n\n56. \nSocial Protection. The pension program design was improved, extending coverage and \nmake  its  compulsory  component  financially  viable.  Until  the  mid-1990s,  only  public  sector \nworkers  were  entitled  to  old-age,  disability  and  survivor  benefits,  under  a  non-contributory \nprogram  funded  out  of  general  government  resources.  This  program  was  subsequently \nextended  on  a  contributory  basis  to  all  formal  sector  workers,  but  old-age  pension  benefits \nremained determined by average salaries in the years preceding retirement. The period covered \nby this credit saw the passing of the first-ever Social Insurance Law, which determines pension \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nbenefits  for  private  sector  workers  on  the  basis  of  their  average  salary  over  all  the  years  in \nwhich they contributed. In a rapidly growing economy, this average salary is substantially lower \nthan the salary in the years preceding retirement, so the law dramatically improved the financial \nviability of the system. It also introduced a voluntary pension program for farmers and informal \nsector  workers,  making  it  possible  to  gradually  extend  the  coverage  of  the  social  insurance \nsystem.  This  voluntary  program  is  currently  in  its  design  phase.  However,  current  pension \nformulas retain shortcomings despite the system\u2019s stronger financial viability and its potentially \nbroader  coverage.  Under  the  new  law,  there  are  considerable  gaps  between  the  level  of \nbenefits for men and women, and for public and private sector workers. In addition, benefits are \nfar  removed  from  the  actuarial  benchmark,  which  encourages  relatively  short  contribution \nperiods and underreporting of earnings.   \n\n57. \nGender.  While  gender  equality  indicators  are  better  in  Viet  Nam  than  in  many  other \ndeveloping countries, steps are being taken to narrow the remaining gaps. The passing of a law \non  gender equality, a policy action  taken under  this program loan, is an important  step in  this \ndirection. It is recognized that regulation alone is not sufficient, as abuses are often unreported \nand enforcement capacities limited, but the new law does serve to unify the legal framework to \naddress gender disparities and increases women\u2019s participation in decision making. \n\n3. \n\nPillar III: Natural Resources  \n \n\n58. \nLand  and  Forest.  Two  main  issues  stand  out  in  relation  to  land.  First,  forest \nmanagement remains largely under the control of state forestry enterprises (SFEs), which has \nresulted in a mixing of commercial and protective functions. There is a risk, however, that SFE \nrestructuring could lead to encroachment upon forest land by outsiders, to the detriment of local \npopulations, especially ethnic minorities, whose livelihoods depend to a large extent on the use \nof  forests  as  a  public  good.  To  address  this  risk,  the  government  issued  the  National  Forest \nDevelopment  Strategy,  which  is  designed  to  strengthen  linkages  between  the  protective  and \neconomic functions of forests, and to promote ownership by local households and communities. \nThe strategy addresses revisions to the 5 million hectare Forest Plan, and aims to improve the \nbalance  between  forest  protection  and  multi-purpose  forestation,  and  promotes  policies  that \nencourage farmers to live with the forests.  \n\n59. \nThe  second  critical  issue  faced  by  Viet  Nam  in  relation  to  land  management  concerns \nland conversion, reclamation and resettlement in the context of rapid urbanization. Close to one \nmillion people may be moving every year to urban and peri-urban areas, and there is extensive \nclearing of land for infrastructure development or to host industrial parks. Lack of transparency \nin reclamation and conversion plans may result in sizeable capital gains for those with access to \nthe  relevant  information,  while  insufficient  compensation  for  affected  populations  is  leading  to \nrecurrent  social  unrest.  The  Land  Law,  approved  under  the  previous  PRSC  series,  paved  the \nway for the use of market prices as the basis for compensation. But gaps remained in relation to \nland occupants lacking appropriate tenure documentation, which is common, as the transfer of \nland  to  households  and  firms  is  still  ongoing  in  Viet  Nam.  Under  PRSC  6,  resettlement  and \ncompensation procedures have been clarified for those cases where occupants lack a land use \nright certificate (LUC), and mechanisms have been set up to handle complaints. \n\n60. \nEnvironment.  Development  sustainability  also  depends  on  the  appropriate  control  of \npollution  and  environmental  damage  resulting  from  both  public  and  private  sector  business \nactivities.  Considerable  progress  was  made  during  the  previous  cycle  on  the  use  of \nenvironmental  impact  assessments  for  large  investment  projects.  This  program  loan  now \nrequires  both  mandatory  consultation  with  communities  where  projects  are  to  be  located  and \nincorporation of local feedback when reporting back to the relevant authorities. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n4. \n\nPillar IV: Modern Governance \n\n \n61. \nPlanning Process. The transformation of planning processes\u2014from the direct allocation \nof resources to the strategic steering of the economy\u2014has continued during the current 5-year \nperiod of the SEDP 2006-2010. In the command and control economy, the MPI would play the \nrole  of  an  arbiter  in  the  selection  of  investment  projects  submitted  by  various  government \nbodies.  With  investment  decisions  devolved  to  the  National  Assembly  and  People\u2019s  Councils, \nthe  role  of  MPI  has  shifted  towards  the  allocation  of  the  budget  envelope  available  for  capital \nexpenditures.  Norms  were  adopted  to  allocate  state  capital  expenditures  transparently  across \nprovinces,  using  criteria  such  as  population,  poverty  and  ethnicity,  and  served  to  make \nconsiderably  more  resources  available  to  poorer  provinces.  In  addition,  regulations  were \nadopted for the preparation of regional development plans, specifying responsibilities, requiring \ndisclosure,  and  requiring  that  infrastructure  master  plans  be  based  on  broader  regional \ndevelopment  plans.  As  a  result,  issues  such  as  comparative  advantage,  land  use  and \npopulation flows are expected to gain importance in determining infrastructure network layouts. \n\n62. \nPublic  Financial  Management.  Public  financial  management  reform  has  focused  on \nstrengthening  systems  and  increasing  transparency.  The  State  Audit  of  Viet  Nam  (SAV)  was \nestablished  as  a  specialized  agency  under  the  National  Assembly  towards  the  end  of  the \nprevious  cycle,  resulting  in  the  first-ever  disclosure  of  the  SAV  audit  results  and  annual  audit \nplan.  In  addition,  a  report  on  budget  execution  for  the  current  year  and  the  budget  plan  for \nforthcoming  year  were  both  published;  these  will  be  published  annually  in  the  future. \nRegulations  were  also  issued  requiring  periodic  disclosure  of  the  amount  and  composition  of \nexternal  public  debt,  signaling  an  increased  emphasis  on  the  management  of  resources  and \nliabilities, as compared to the previous focus on public expenditures. In addition, a regulation to \nguide the establishment and issuance of benchmark government bonds was implemented, and \nthe  administrative  procedures  for  all  taxes  were  consolidated  into  a  single  law,  modernizing \nassessment and enforcement methods. \n\n63. \nLegal  Development.  Increased  oversight  of  government  actions  at  both  national  and \nlocal levels has been a common theme underlying the legal reforms adopted under this program \nloan. The National Assembly has become increasingly active in its supervisory role, especially \nsince  the  passing  of  the  Budget  Law  of  2002.  This  trend  was  reinforced  recently  with  the \nestablishment of separate legal, judicial, economic, and budget committees, which are expected \nto include a greater proportion of permanent members than in the past. A key new task of the \njudiciary  committee  will  be  overseeing  the  Government\u2019s  anticorruption  activities.  A  separate \nlegislative committee will be in a better position to ensure consistency between different laws, \nimprove the quality of their drafting, and coordinate the assessments and recommendations of \nthe various National Assembly committees on proposed legislation. A similar trend is noticeable \nat  local  levels.  A  new  ordinance  on  grassroots  democracy  strengthens  information  disclosure, \npublic  participation,  and  accountability  of  officials  in  the  preparation  and  implementation  of \ncommune-level  policies.  Recent  legal  developments  have  also  aimed  at  promoting  access  to \njustice and  recognizing civil society organizations. Under this operation, legal aid mechanisms \nfor  marginalized  and  vulnerable  groups  were  simplified  and  broadened,  and  policies  adopted \nencouraging the participation of non-state establishments in the delivery of public services. \n\n64. \nFighting  Corruption.  The  Government  is  now  moving  to  implement  its  anticorruption \nprogram. Key laws and regulations have been passed, including the pivotal Anticorruption Law. \nThe  current  challenge\u2014of  translating  resolve  into  action\u2014has  been  addressed  in  part  by \nseveral measures adopted during the period covered by this credit. These include establishment \nof a steering committee against corruption, headed by the Prime Minister, which has the power \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\nto  suspend  high-level  officials  if  they  are  suspected  of  wrongdoing.  It  is  already  engaged  in \ninvestigating  some  high-profile  cases,  and  the  findings  are  to  be  made  public.  In  addition,  the \noffice  of  the  national  steering  committee  was  set  up  under  the  Anticorruption  Law  as  an \nindependent  entity,  which  does  not  belong  to  the  existing  government  agency  system.  The \nresults  of  corruption  investigations  in  cases  overseen  by  the  Government  Inspectorate  were \ndisclosed, and a legal  framework  established  to protect and reward corruption-related whistle-\nblowing.  \n\nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\nAn  environmental  assessment  has  been  prepared  for  the  policy  matrix  of  the  program \n65. \nloan  in  keeping  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  the  environmental  safeguard \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines.19  \n \nOn  balance,  the  reforms  proposed  as  part  of  this  program  loan  are  expected  to  have \n66. \nwide-reaching  positive  impacts  on  socioeconomic  conditions  throughout  Viet  Nam  and  will \nassist the Government fulfill its development objectives as outlined in the SEDP. The majority of \nthe proposed reforms are likely to have either a positive impact or no impact. Where possible, \nenhancement  measures  have  been  developed  for  integration  into  the  reform  process  to \noptimize the predicted positive impacts. Two series of reforms\u2014those relating to (i) an increase \nin granting of trading and distribution rights to foreign firms, and (ii) to increased private sector \ndevelopment\u2014have been identified as having an unknown impact, because of their potential to \nresult in both positive and negative effects. Mitigation measures have been developed to offset \nany  potential  adverse  impacts  and  maximize  their  positive  impacts.  No  reforms  have  been \nidentified as having a negative impact. \n \n67.  Monitoring relating to environmental issues will be integrated into the overall monitoring \nprogram developed for PRSC operations; a series of suggested environment-related monitoring \nindicators has been developed for this purpose.  \n \nThe program loan will not have any impact on involuntary resettlement or on indigenous \n68. \npeople,  as  it  has  no  investment  component.  None  of  the  policy  actions  associated  with  this \nprogram will trigger any activities related to indigenous people during the implementation period. \nThe  current  PRSC  cycle  recognizes  the  potential  risk  of  income  disparity  between  urban  and \nrural  as  well  as  the  Kinh  majority  and  ethnic  minorities,  as  did  PRSC  5.  The  Government  is \naware  of  this  potential  risk  and  commits  to  formulating  and  implementing  preventative  and \nmitigating measures. This potential risk is not viewed as being likely to damage Viet Nam\u2019s track \nrecord  on  these  issues  during  the  short  program  implementation  period.  A  social  and  poverty \nimpact  assessment  was  undertaken  in  relation  to  the  program  loan  (see  Appendix  8).  The \nassessment  concludes  that  the  activities  will  have  no  adverse  impacts  on  indigenous  people, \nand no gender implications.  \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n69. \nA  total  of  about  $354  million  for  PRSC  6  operations  is  expected  to  be  funded  through \nODA  resources.  The  World  Bank  has  already  approved  a  $175  million  credit  from  the \nInternational  Development  Association  to  support  PRSC  6.  Financing  partners  providing \nconcessional  loans  include  ADB  ($15  million),  JBIC  (\u00a53.5  billion),  and  Germany  (\u20ac6  million). \nFinancing partners providing grants include Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Cooperaci\u00f3n Internacional (\u20ac5 \n\n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nmillion),  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID,  A$10  million),  Canadian \nInternational Development Agency (Can$7.5 million), Danish International Development Agency \n(DKr61  million),  European  Commission  (EC,  \u20ac20  million),  Ireland  (\u20ac7.5  million),  Netherlands \nMinistry  of  Development  Cooperation  (\u20ac12  million),  and  United  Kingdom\u2019s  Department  for \nInternational  Development  (DFID,  \u20a420  million).  Swiss  Development  Cooperation,  while  not  a \nfinancing partner, provided financial support for coordination of the process.  \n \n70. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $15  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources as ADB\u2019s support to SEDP implementation following the policy framework of PRSC 6. \nThe  program  loan  would  contribute  to  financing  the  costs  of  adjustment  resulting  from \nimplementation of the policy matrix, particularly the prior actions for PRSC 6, and to supporting \nand  facilitating  the  Government\u2019s  continued  and  deepened  reform  program  for  poverty \nreduction. The loan will be disbursed upon declaration of loan effectiveness. \n \nThe loan will have a 24-year term including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of \n71. \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The loan proceeds may be used to finance \neligible imports incurred within 180 days prior to the date of loan effectiveness. The loan closing \ndate will be 31 December 2008. \n \n72. \nSome of the reforms supported by PRSC 6 entail substantial cost to the Government to \nfinance.  Policy  measures  supported  by  the  PRSC  operations,  such  as  the  safety  net  for \nredundant SOE workers, recapitalization of SOCBs, provincial healthcare for the poor, and the \nincreased education budget allocation require additional spending. These are costly and specific \nto the PRSCs. The cost of adjustment of the PRSCs is therefore greater than the cost of these \nclearly PRSC-specific items, which is estimated to range from more than $300 million to more \nthan  $700  million  per  year  from  2002  to  2006.  The  estimated  cost  of  some  specific  PRSC-\nrelated measures for the PRSC 6 implementation period is approximately $1,420 million, i.e., (i) \nhealth  care  funds  for  the  poor,  about  $90  million;  (ii)  increased  spending  on  education \nproportional to the Government budget, about $540 million; (iii) social safety net program for the \nretrenched SOE workers, about $100 million; and (iv) SOCB recapitalization, about $690 million.  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n73. \nSBV, as the Executing Agency, will be responsible for overall program implementation, \nincluding  administration  and  disbursement  of  loan  proceeds,  maintenance  of  accounts,  and \npreparation of semiannual progress reports on program implementation. The program is being \nimplemented  through  all  line  ministries  and  government  agencies  in  accordance  with  the  loan \nagreement.  While  the  ODA  funds  raised  through  the  PRSC  process  provide  resources  to  the \nstate budget to implement the reforms, the PRSC operations have also served as an effective \ncoordination device between the Government and the many development partners. On behalf of \nthe  Government,  SBV  coordinated  the  overall  processing  of  PRSC  6.  The  World  Bank \ncoordinated  the  process  for  the  development  partners.  The  number  of  financing  partners  has \nsteadily increased, from 4 in PRSC 1 (approved in 2002) to 11 for PRSC 6. The development \npartners  have  participated  in  the  PRSC  process  by  forming  working  groups  with  the \nGovernment  that  cover  all  economic  policy  areas.  Staff  of  ADB\u2019s  Viet  Nam  Resident  Mission \nhave  actively  participated  in  several  other  working  groups  including  the  small-  and  medium-\nsized  enterprise  (SME)  development  partnership,  financial  sector  partnership,  and  public \nadministrative reform partnership. Given the comprehensive nature of the PRSC reform process \n\n\f \n\n21 \n\nand the ever-growing number of financing partners, in January 2005 SBV established a program \ncoordination  unit,  comprised  of  competent  staff.  The  unit  deals  with  the  program  agenda, \nincluding  monitoring  and  reporting,  awareness  raising,  capacity  building,  and  reform  outcome \ndissemination.  It  has  frequently  interacted  with  the  World  Bank  and  the  financing  partners  of \nPRSC 6, including ADB. \n \nThe Steering Committee was established in June 2007  to  advise the  Prime  Minister  in \n74. \ndeveloping and implementing the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy and \nPoverty Reduction Support Credits in consistence with the purposes of the SEDP 2006\u20132010. \nSuch steering committee is chaired by the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reforms, \nand consists of representatives from relevant line ministries and government agencies. An SBV \ndeputy  governor  and  a  vice  minister  of  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  act  as  the \nstanding vice chairpersons. To represent PRSC policy reform areas, the steering committee has \nseveral representatives from key economic ministries (e.g., the ministries of agriculture and rural \ndevelopment;  education  and  training;  finance;  foreign  affairs;  justice;  industry  and  trade;  and \nlabor, invalids, and social affairs; and), as well as the Office of the Government.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe program period is from 30 June 2007 to 31 December 2008. \n\n75. \n \n\n3. \n\nDisbursement and Procurement  \n\n76. \nThe loan will be disbursed in a single tranche, contingent upon loan effectiveness. The \nloan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  for  a  broad  range  of  imports,  subject  to  a  negative  list  of \nineligible  items  (Appendix  9).  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB \nmember  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans,20 the proceeds of the program loan \nwill  be  disbursed  to  Viet  Nam  as  the  Borrower.  No  supporting  import  documentation  will  be \nrequired,  provided  the  value  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember \ncountries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is \nequal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed. The Government will \ncertify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  its  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import \ndocumentation under existing procedures will be required. ADB will have the right to audit  the \nuse  of  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Borrower's  certification.  As  such,  the \nprocedures for procurement and disbursement of funds, and the use of counterpart funds, are \nfelt to be satisfactory. \n \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n77. \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  program.  To  support  these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan agreement.  \n\n                                                 \n20 ADB. 1998.

A first \ncountry  financial  accountability  assessment  (CFAA)21 was  undertaken  in  2000\u20132001.  A  public \nexpenditure  review-integrated  fiduciary  assessment  (PER-IFA) 22  carried  out  in  2004  and \nthe \npublished \nrecommendations  of  the  2001-CFAA  and  also  suggested  reforms  in  other  areas.  The \ngovernment  has  made  steady progress in implementing  the 2004 PER-IFA recommendations. \nMajor developments in public financial management include empowering the National Assembly \nwith  increased  government  accountability  for  the  use  of  public  resources;  increasing \ntransparency  for  all  agencies  using  budget  resources,  including  SOEs,  public  investment \nprojects and statutory funds; establishing the SAV as a technically independent unit under the \nNational  Assembly;  and  gradual  integration  of  capital  and  recurrent  expenditures  through \nforward-looking  budgets  and  resource  allocation  norms.  Twenty-six  national  private  sector \naccounting  and  37  auditing  standards  consistent  with  international  practice  have  been  issued. \nThe government is currently making a major investment in a new and integrated Treasury and \nBudget Management Information System (TABMIS). Progress is being made in developing new \nbusiness processes for TABMIS, including (i) a unified Chart of Accounts, (ii) further integration \nof  recurrent  and  capital  budget  execution  processes,  (iii)  clarification  of  issues  related  to \nreporting  ODA  on  budget,  and  (iv)  development  of  standard  reports  to  strengthen  budget \nexecution. \n \n79. \nThe World Bank and MOF commenced preparation of the CFAA Update in April 2007 in \nconsultation  with  and  with  the  participation  of  many  other  development  partners,  including \nADB,23 AusAID,  Canada,  Denmark,  DFID,  EC,  France,  Germany,  Ireland,  and  Sweden.  The \nfinal  report  will  be  available  in  late  2007.  The  update  will  provide  an  assessment  of  public \nfinancial  management  by  examining  budget  development,  budget  execution  and  accounting, \ninternal and external reporting, internal controls, internal and external auditing, monitoring and \nlegislative  oversight  and  scrutiny,  financial  management  capacity  and  financial  accountability \nrisks.  \n \n80. \nThe  fiduciary  risks  of  the  current  public  financial  management  systems,  (budgeting, \naccounting, reporting and auditing) are assessed as moderate. Since the IMF does not currently \nhave  a  program  in  Viet  Nam,  it  is  not  possible  to  rely  on  its  assessment  of  the  control \nenvironment of the SBV. However, the enactment of the Audit Law of 2005 helps address the \nissues related to audit and accounting arrangements. The Audit Law has established the SAV \nas an independent institution reporting to the National Assembly, with the auditor general being \nappointed and dismissed by the National Assembly. Audit reports were made public for the first \ntime in 2006. The SBV will be subject to auditing by SAV on an annual basis. \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe  Government  will  prepare  and  provide  progress  reports  on  the  program  loan.  ADB \n81. \nwill  participate  in  all  joint  assessments  by  the  Government  and  development  partners  on  the \n\n                                                 \n21  World Bank. 2001.

The  SEDP  M&E  framework  was  developed  by  MPI,  with  support  from  ADB,  World \nBank  and  UNDP,  and  in  close  consultation  with  line  ministries.  Some  indicators  in  the \nframework  are common with the National Statistics Indicator System (NSIS) developed by  the \nGeneral  Statistics  Office  (GSO);  others,  although  not  included  in  the  NSIS,  can  be  calculated \nfrom  Viet  Nam  Household  Living  Standards  Survey  data.  Data  for  a  few  others,  e.g.  for \nassessing satisfaction with government services, will have to be collected.  \n \nPRSC  6  will  continue  to  build  on  its  successes  in  the  previous  5-year  PRSC  cycle  in \n83. \nstreamlining  numerous  ongoing  M&E  initiatives.  Key  sources  of  monitoring  information  for \npoverty  and  program  outcomes  include  the  proposed  biannual  household  living  standard \nsurvey,  periodic  participatory  poverty  assessments,  small  business  registration  survey,  public \nexpenditure  tracking  survey,  as  well  as  quarterly  progress  reports  from  the  relevant  sector \nministries and committees implementing the reform program. In some areas the set of indicators \nproposed  in  the  VDR  goes  beyond  the  SEDP  M&E  framework;  this  is  the  case  in  relation  to \ngovernance, where monitoring experience is limited and there is less experience in the use of \nenterprise  and  household  surveys,  as  opposed  to  administrative  self-reporting.  However, \nbecause  reliable  data  need  to  be  collected  from  surveys  and  other  sources  with  demanding \nimplementation  requirements,  the  monitoring  of  progress  towards  development  outcomes \ncannot  be  conducted  on  an  annual  basis.  It  is  expected  that  the  new  PRSC  cycle  will  involve \nsome annual monitoring but only two in-depth assessments, towards the middle and at the end \nof the cycle. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n84. \nFirst,  through  policy  actions  designed  to  facilitate  business  development,  the  loan  will \nincrease efficiency, accelerate economic growth, and create jobs. These policy actions will help \nimprove  the  regulatory  framework  for  private  sector  development,  and  enhance  transparency \nand accountability in SOE operations and in banking. Second, policy actions addressing social \ninclusion  will  result  in  benefits  that  include  improved  quality  of  education,  improved  access  of \nthe  poor  to  health  services,  a  reformed  social  protection  system,  and  promotion  of  gender \nequality.  Third,  through  policy  actions  addressing  natural  resources,  the  loan  will  help  secure \nland ownership and address the resettlement and compensation process, as well as promoting \nmore sustainable management of natural resources. Fourth, through policy actions addressing \nmodern  governance,  benefits  include  increased  transparency  and  accountability  of  public \nfinances,  and  improved  legal  transparency  and  accessibility.  These  will  be  achieved  through \nbetter coordination of plans and budgets, adoption of the medium-term expenditure framework, \nand greater accountability in public finance and public administration. \n   \n85. \nThree  potential  risks  are  associated  with  emerging  imbalances  accompanying  Viet \nNam\u2019s  entry  into  a  new  phase  of  development,  with  greater  global  integration  and  a  more \nmarket-oriented  economy.  The  first  potential  risk  is  the  vulnerability  that  stems  from  possible \nturbulence  in  the  financial  sector,  as  the  supervisory  and  regulatory  capacity  of  monetary \nauthorities  has  not  matched  the  expansion  in  capital  markets.  The  second  risk  relates  to  the \nmassive  inflows  of  FDI  and  increased  competition  in  formerly  protected  sectors.  This  change \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nmay  test  the  ability  of  Viet  Nam  to  preserve  social  inclusion,  and  may  cause  some  groups  to \nlose  in  the  short  term.  The  third  possible  risk  involves  potential  corruption  and  social  strife \nrelated to rapid urbanization and infrastructure development. \n \n86. \nThrough  appropriate  measures  and  proactive  programs  undertaken  during  program \nimplementation, the Government will take steps to mitigate potential risks. ADB, along with other \nPRSC financing partners, has conducted analytical studies to help policymakers formulate and \nexecute  mitigating  and  corrective  measures  in  anticipation  of  these  potential  risks.  These \ncorrective measures have been included in the proposed series of PRSCs, which includes this \nprogram loan.  The  first  risk\u2014related  to  imbalance in  the  financial sector\u2014could be addressed \nby  rapid  upgrading  of  policies  related  to  the  banking  sector,  the  securities  market  and  the \nmanagement of public debt, all of which are part of the proposed reform program. The second \nrisk\u2014related  to  social  inclusion  and  environmental  sustainability\u2014could  be  mitigated  by  the \nstrong commitment of the Government to keep growth inclusive and sustainable. This risk could \nalso  be  addressed  through  improvements  in  data  availability  and  analytical  work  on  issues \narising  from  rural-urban  disparities,  which  are  included  as  part  of  the  PRSC  process.  Rapid \nfeedback  channels  from  affected  stakeholders,  inclusive  policies  in  the  social  sectors,  and \ntransparent  mechanisms  to  transfer  resources  to  poorer  regions  are  among  the  mitigating \nmeasures supported by the proposed series of operations. The third risk\u2014related to corruption \nand  social  strife  caused  by  rapid  urbanization  and  infrastructure  development\u2014could  be \naddressed  by  making  rapid  progress  in  transparency  at  various  levels,  including  in  regional \nplanning, infrastructure master plans, land use and appropriate taxation, and monitoring of the \nassets of relevant civil servants.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  SBV  have  given  the \n\n87. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nSuch measures and actions will continue  to be in effect  for  the  sustainability of \nthe poverty reduction program under the SEDP and PRSC frameworks. \nAdequate and timely counterpart funds will be provided for the implementation of \nthe poverty reduction program under PRSC 6. \n\n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n88. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  9,793,000  to  the \nSocialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Support  the  Implementation  of  the  Poverty  Reduction \nProgram IV from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 24 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n\nLiqun Jin \nVice President (Operations 1) \n\n \n7 September 2007  \n\n\f \n\n \nDesign Summary \n\nImpact \nReduced poverty and \nhigh economic growth \nsustained \n\nOutcome  \nAttainment of \ndevelopment outcomes \nspecified under the four \npillars of the PRSC \nframework: business \ndevelopment, social \ninclusion, natural \nresources, and modern \ngovernance \n1.

Viet Nam has been among the fastest-growing economies in the world \nfor  almost  two  decades.  There  was  a  considerable  acceleration  of  reforms  around  2001, \njustifying  the  first  5-year  PRSC  cycle,  and  then  again  in  2006.  The  former  involved  (i)  the \npassing of an enterprise law that greatly facilitated business registration and operation, (ii) the \nsigning of a bilateral trade agreement with the United States that strengthened global integration \nand  resulted  in  important  legal  improvements,  and  (iii)  the  adoption  of  the  first  serious  steps \ntowards  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE)  divestiture  and  the  strengthening  of  public  financial \nmanagement.  Emerging  from  massive  poverty  less  than  two  decades  ago,  Viet  Nam  is  now \naiming to attain middle-income status by 2010.  \n \n2. \nThe  new  socioeconomic  development  plan  (SEDP)  2006\u20132010  articulates  the  aim  to \nattain  middle-income  status  by  2010,  reflecting  the  transition  towards  strategic  planning  for  a \nmarket economy. The SEDP, approved by the National Assembly in June 2006, illustrates the \ndepth  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  transition.  Unlike  previous  5-year  plans,  which  focused  on  quantitative \ntargets  as  if  the  state  was  still  in  charge  of  producing  most  goods  and  services,  the  SEDP \nemphasizes  development  outcomes  and  the  policy  reforms  needed  to  attain  them.  It  relies  on \ndata  analysis  rather \nits  diagnosis  and \nrecommendations.  It has also led to the adoption of a  framework  to  monitor progress towards \nattaining development outcomes.  \n \n3. \nThe official development assistance (ODA) community has aligned its efforts behind the \nSEDP, while acknowledging that other key documents will shape reforms in the coming years. \nSuch  alignment  is  a  testament  to  the  strong  ownership  of  the  reform  program  by  the \nGovernment of Viet Nam (the Government). It also reflects satisfaction with the process through \nwhich  the  SEDP  was  prepared.  Above  all,  the  SEDP  is  seen  as  both  a  credible  and  a \nsustainable strategy to foster economic growth and poverty reduction. It is credible because of \nthe ambitious policy reforms it proposes, which are organized around three pillars: (i) supporting \nbusiness development, (ii) keeping growth inclusive, and (iii) better managing natural resources. \nA  fourth,  underlying  pillar  concerns  the  need  to  modernize  institutions  so  as  to  deliver  on  the \nother  three  fronts.  The  SEDP  is  seen  as  sustainable  because  it  should  lead  to  manageable \nlevels of public debt by 2010. \n \n4. \nUnlike  the  previous  SEDP,  the  new  SEDP  is  focused  and  clearly  defines  development \ntargets,  identifies  appropriate  policies  to  attain  those  targets,  and  aligns  resources  to  those \npolicies.  The  country\u2019s  development  goals,  which  are  a  local  version  of  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, are among the key targets pursued in the SEDP (Table A2.1); this parallels \nhow  key  targets  were  pursued  in  the  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy \n(CPRGS) that governed the previous PRSC cycle.  \n \n5. \nThe SEDP provides a framework for poverty reduction policies, programs, and actions in \nViet  Nam  (Figure  A2.1).

The PRSC policy actions are aimed at \nidentifying  a  coherent  sequence  of  key  measures  in  each  area  over  the  medium  term. \nIdentification  of  the  policy  actions  needed  to  attain  the  development  outcomes  documented  in \nthe  SEDP  has  been  strongly  influenced  by  the  progress  reports  of  the  implementation  of  the \nprevious National Poverty Reduction Strategy, namely the CPRGS, and analytical work carried \nout  by  the  development  partners.  The  annual  Viet  Nam  Development  Reports  (VDRs)\u2014which \nare  prepared  in  partnership  by  the  World  Bank  and  other  development  partners,  including  the \nAsian Development bank (ADB)\u2014 have played a very important role in this respect. In addition \nto  the  CPRGS  and  PRSC-related  studies  and  reports,  sector  work  reports  and  assessments \ndone under each development partner\u2019s sector-based programs and projects also provide input \nto ensure the complementarity and efficiency of the PRSC reform agenda. Table A2.2 illustrates \nthe timing and relation of the strategy, implementation, analyses, and sector work.  \n \n\n3. \n\nContribution: Financial and Intellectual \n\n \n7. \nThe  ODA  community  in  Viet  Nam  considers  the  PRSC  an  important  instrument  for \nsupporting  SEDP  implementation.  ADB  and  other  major  ODA  partners\u2014including  Australia, \nCanada,  Denmark,  European  Commission,  Germany,  Ireland,  Japan,  Netherlands,  Spain,  and \nthe  United  Kingdom\u2014have  joined  with  the  World  Bank  and  contributed  both  financial  and \nintellectual resources to PRSC 6. Switzerland, while not a financing partner to PRSC 6, partially \nfunds  the  PRSC  Program  Coordination  Unit,  which  is  responsible  for  coordinating  the  PRSC \nprocess between government agencies and development partners. The International Monetary \nFund (IMF), France, and United Nations Development Programme, as well as the United States \nAgency  for  International development, also  participate in  policy dialogue to provide intellectual \ncontributions to the PRSC process.  \n \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n8. \nIn  addition  to  providing  resources  to  fill  the  Government\u2019s  financing  gap  for  the \ncomprehensive  reform  agenda,  PRSC  operations  have  served  as  an  effective  coordination \ndevice,  supported  by  an  increasingly  large  number  of  development  partners.  The  steering \ncommittee  for  the  PRSCs  has  been  led  by  the  deputy  prime  minister  in  charge  of  economic \nreforms,  and  brings  together  representatives  from  all  relevant  line  ministries  and  government \nagencies.  On  the  development  partners\u2019  side,  PRSC  operations  have  been  cofinanced  by \nseveral  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies,  either  through  grants  or  parallel  lending.  More \nimportantly,  the  process  saw  a  transition  in  the  role  of  financing  partners,  from  providers  of  \nfinance  to  partners  substantially interests and technical capacity on the ground. The number \nof development partners participating in this process has increased from 4 in PRSC 1 to 11 in \nPRSC  6.  All  development  engaged  in  the  preparation  of  operations  and  policy  dialogue  with \ngovernment.  This  dialogue  is  organized  by  policy  areas,  in    which    development    partners \nengages electively,  based  on  their partners who seriously consider the possibility of partnering \nin  this  process  are  invited  to  participate  in  the  preparation  of  PRSC  operations,  even  if  they \ncannot  commit  to  cofinance  them  in  the  short term.

The PRSC group dominates the development assistance landscape in \nViet  Nam  related  to  the  education  and  health  sectors,  environmental  sustainability,  land \nmanagement,  legal  development,  and  public  financial  management;  these  were  all  part  of \nPRSC 2, while PRSC 3 and 4 further broadened sectoral coverage. \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe  World  Bank  and  other  PRSC  financing  parters,  except  for  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational  Cooperation  (JBIC)  and  ADB,  consider  PRSCs  to  be  budget  support  operations. \nFor  ADB,  the  program  loan  that  cofinances  PRSC  6  is  considered  a  sector-wide  approach \nprogram,  with  loan  proceeds  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  financing  gap,  which  is  caused  by \nthe Government\u2019s engagement in reform endeavors covered by the program. The proceeds are \nin  foreign  exchange,  with  the  loan  agreement  governing  the  use  of  the  proceeds  to  purchase \nimport  goods.  The  justification  for  providing  lending  assistance  for  the  PRSC  is  based  on \nsatisfactory financial management arrangements for the program, which are ultimately related to \nthe  Government\u2019s  public  financial  management.  The  following  paragraphs  offer  an  analysis  of \nViet Nam\u2019s fiscal stance and public financial management, which is presented in addition to the \nexplanation in section IV E.4 Financial Accountability and Fiduciary Assessment (paras. 78\u201380 \nin the main text).   \n \n\n1. \n\nOverall Fiscal Trend \n\n \n10. \nViet  Nam  has  been  widely  acknowledged  for  its  fiscal  prudence,  with  relatively  small \nbudget deficits and a relatively small stock of both domestic and external debt. Viet Nam\u2019s fiscal \nstance has remained extremely prudent, with the budget deficit averaging less than 2% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) over the period 1999\u20132003 and the stock of debt remaining under 40% \nof  GDP.  The  country  has  received  increasingly  solid  grades  from  international  organizations, \nforeign governments and sovereign risk rating agencies.  \n \nThe investment to GDP ratio increased from 28.3% in 1997 to 35.1% in 2003 and 41% in \n11. \n2006.  The  share  of  the  public  sector  in  GDP  has  averaged  56%,  that  of  the  domestic  private \nsector 24%, and of the foreign invested private sector 20%. High levels of investment, especially \nin  the  public  sector,  have  had  an  important  impact  on  infrastructure  development,  economic \ntransformation  and  implementation  of  national  poverty  reduction  programs.  Concerns  persist \nabout  the  quality  of  investments,  in  the  sense  that  more  growth  and  poverty  reduction  could \nhave been attained from the same level of investment.  \n \nStrong  economic  growth  was  accompanied  by  strong  growth  in  government  revenues. \n12. \nTable A2.3 below illustrates the fiscal trend. In nominal terms, government revenue and grants \nincreased by an average of over 14% per  year  between 1999 and 2006. Revenue and  grants \nrose  from  around  20%  of  GDP  in  2000  to  over  28%  in  2006.  Revenues  from  consumption  of \npetroleum products and production of crude oil increased from 4.1% of GDP in 1998 to 6.5% in \n2003 and 8.6% in 2006, and account for the largest part of the revenue increase. The share of \nsuch revenues as a percentage of total revenue and grants rose from 20% in 1998 to 22.4% in \n2003 and 30% in 2006. As a consequence, the public budget has become more vulnerable to oil \nprice shocks. Although the oil production outlook for the years ahead appears to be quite robust, \ncrude oil exports cannot be relied upon as a source of revenues in the very long term. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nTable A2.3: Overview of Fiscal Trends (1999\u20132006) \n(percentage of GDP) \n\n \n\nItem \nTotal Revenue and \nGrants \n  Tax revenue \n  Grants \n \nTotal Expenditure \n  Current Expenditure \n  Capital Expenditure \nDeficit \n\n1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004  2005  2006\n\n19.6  20.5  21.4  22.7  23.1  26.6  25.9  28.0 \n15.1  14.8  15.7  16.8  16.7  19.3  23.5  26.0 \n  0.3 \n  0.6 \n \n \n\n  0.3 \n \n\n  0.5 \n \n\n  0.3 \n \n\n  0.4 \n \n\n  0.4 \n \n\n  0.4 \n \n\n21.2  22.6  24.2  24.1  25.1  29.9  28.3  31.3 \n13.8  15.9  15.9  15.7  16.8  15.0  18.4  19.3 \n  8.4 \n  7.4 \n  9.1 \n  9.2 \n  (1.4)   (2.0)   (1.1)    (1.6)    (1.8)\n  (1.6)\n\n  6.7 \n  (2.0)\n\n  8.3 \n  (2.8)\n\n  8.5 \n\n  8.3 \n\n         ( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \n         Source: Ministry of Finance. \n \n13. \nTo  strengthen  revenues  as  well  as  to  encourage  domestic  and  foreign  investment,  the \nGovernment  has  lightened  the  tax  burden  through  reduction  of  tax  rates  in  many  areas.  The \nenterprise  income  tax  rate  has  been  reduced  from  32%  to  28%,  and  the  number  of  VAT  tax \nrates has been cut from 4 to 3, with the highest rate (of 20%) abolished. The National Assembly \nhas decided to eliminate overseas profit remittance tax and surtax on enterprise income. Most \nnotably,  in  2002,  the  agricultural  land  use  tax  was  reduced  by  50%;  nearly  all  farmers  have \nbeen  exempted  from  such  taxes  since  2003,  meaning  that  approximately  75%  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s \npopulation now pays no direct taxes.  \n \nThe  Government  developed  a  strategy  for  reform  of  the  tax  system  to  the  year  2010. \n14. \nThe  strategy  includes  revision  of  current  tax  policies  and  reform  of  the  tax  administration \nsystem.  Indirect  tax  revenues  currently  account  for  a  substantial  share  (41%)  of  overall  tax \ncollections, and this is expected to increase to 56% in 2010. Direct tax revenues, which account  \nfor 21% of  total revenues, would increase to 24% given the government\u2019s continued policy on \ninvestment  incentives.  Various  fees  are  to  be  rationalized.  With  regards  to  tax  administration, \ntax self assessment will be further expanded, with the General Department of Taxation adopting \na  functionally-based  organizational  structure  focusing  on  taxpayer  education  and  service,  tax \naudit and inspection, and computerization of tax administration.  \n \n15. \n1999  marked  a  turning  point  in  the  size  of  overall  government  spending.  After  steadily \ndeclining as a ratio of GDP in the preceding years, government spending (excluding onlending, \ncarry-over,  and  expenditure  from  retained  revenue)  has  recovered  during  the  period  1999\u2013\n2006.  From  a  low  of  21%  of  GDP  in  1999,  it  reached  24.1%  in  2002,  28%  in  2005,  and  had \nincreased to over 31% in 2006. Between 1999 and 2006, total government spending rose at the \nremarkable  average  annual  rate  of  16  percent  in  nominal  terms,  with  capital  expenditure \ngrowing  at  some  20%.  As  a  share  of  GDP,  current  expenditure  rose  from  13.8%  in  1999  to \n19.3% in 2006, while capital expenditure rose from 5.7% to 9.1% over the same period. Capital \nexpenditure has averaged 30% of total expenditure over the last three years. \n \nThe  net  result  of  these  revenue  and  expenditure  trends  has  been  a  budget  deficit  that \n16. \nhas remained manageable, ranging between 1.1% and 2.8% over  the period 1999\u20132006. The \nNational  Assembly  has  been  prudent  in  stipulating  that  the  budget  deficit  plus  amortization \nshould  not  exceed  5%  of  GDP.  The  revenues  collected  by  the  government  fully  financed \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n39 \n\nrecurrent expenditure and partly financed capital expenditure. Thus, borrowing was undertaken \nonly to finance, and was always less than, capital expenditure.  \n \n17. \nBy the end of 2006, the government debt that is attributable to budgetary expenditures, \nincluding  ODA  onlending,  stands  at  around  37%  of  GDP.  However,  to  get  a  more  complete \npicture  of  the  wider  public  debt  position  it  is  important  to  add  items  that  are  currently  not \nreflected in the budget. Two such items are bonds issued to finance certain infrastructure and \neducation  projects  and  the  recapitalization  costs  of  state-owned  commercial  banks  (SOCBs). \nTheir  inclusion  in  public  debt  numbers  is  likely  to  raise  its  level  by  about  3  percentage  points. \nThis is by no means an alarming level, but it would be prudent to be watchful of these trends. \n \n\n2. \n\nFiscal Transparency \n\n \n18. \nFiscal  transparency  plays  an  important  role  in  ensuring  fiscal  sustainability.  Fiscal \ntransparency  enables  accountability  to  citizens  regarding  the  use  of  government  finances  and \nthe  quality  of  fiscal  management,  and  facilitates  the  monitoring  conducted  by  government \nagencies,  social  organizations  and  grassroot  communities  of  the  allocation  and  spending  of \npublic  resources  by  national  and  subnational  governments.  As  well  as  encouraging \nsustainability, this can enhance the effectiveness of public financial management. \n \n19. \nViet  Nam  has  made  continuous  efforts  since  1997  to  enhance  fiscal  transparency  and \npublicity. These efforts have followed two tracks. The first is announcement of policies regarding \nallocation  norms,  expenditure  norms,  fiscal  assignments  and  monitoring  arrangements.  The \nsecond  is  the  publication  and  dissemination  of  figures,  data  and  materials  relating  to  annual \nbudget  planning  and  final  accounts  of  the  state  budget  at  all  levels  of  government  and  at \nspending unit level.  \n \n20. \nIn  1998  the  budget  revenue  and  expenditure  figures  were  published  in  the  General \nStatistics  Office\u2019s  Statistical  Yearbook  for  the  first  time.  In  the  same  year,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  State \nBudget revenues and expenditures were published in the IMF\u2019s Government Finance Statistics \nYearbook, also for the first time. Decision 192 on Fiscal Transparency was issued by the Prime \nMinister  in  2004,  specifying  the  rules  of  fiscal  transparency  and  publication.  The  requirements \nfor disclosure have been substantially increased. In particular, allocation norms approved by the \nNational  Assembly  and  the  people\u2019s  councils  must  be  publicized  at  each  budget  level. \nOrganizations  funded  from  the  state  budget  must  disclose  their  state  budget  support,  budget \nplans  and  final  accounts,  and  the  methods  used  to  determine  their  state  budget  support.  For \nstate  capital  investment  projects,  annual  budget  allocations,  budget  plans,  final  accounts  and \nbidding results for procurements must be disclosed. \n \n\n3. \n\nPro-Poor Public Expenditures \n\n \n21. \nViet Nam is committed to a strategy of poverty reduction. Astonishing progress has been \nmade.  Over  the  period  1993\u20132002,  the  proportion  of  people  below  the  poverty  line  has  fallen \nfrom 58% to 29%, and the Government estimates that the proportion fell to 26% in 2004. Thus, \nViet Nam has lifted approximately 25 million people out of poverty in less than a decade. Public \nexpenditure allocation has played an important role in this achievement.  \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nTable A2.4: Budget for National Targeted Programs  \n(D billion) \n \n\nNational Targeted Program \n\n2004  2005  2006 \n\nPoverty Reduction and Employment Creation \nP\nSafe Water and Sanitation in Rural Areas \n\nPopulation and Family Planning Program \n\nDangerous Social Diseases and HIV/AIDS  \n\nPrevention Program \n\n782\n\n255\n\n440\n\n508\n\n818 \n\n925 \n\n300 \n\n353 \n\n450 \n\n572 \n\n685 \n\n910 \n\nCultural Program \n\n232\n\n320 \n\n370 \n\nEducation and Training Program \n\n1,299 1,770  2,970 \n\nProgram 135 (Infrastructure Development in Difficult \n\n1,366 1,625  1,816 \n\nCommunes) \n\nFive Million Hectare Afforestation Program \n\n476\n\n550 \n\n610 \n\nTotal \n\n5,358 6,518  8,526 \n\n              Source: Ministry of Finance. \n \n22. \nAssessing  the  extent  to  which  public  spending  is  resulting  in  a  transfer  of  resources \ntowards  poor  households  requires  consideration  of  both  the  composition  of  public expenditure \nand the effectiveness of public spending within each sector. It is clear, however, that pro-poor \nbudget  allocations  are  an  important  step  towards  pro-poor  service  delivery.  The  Government \nhas  three  important  tools  for  public  spending  and  poverty  reduction  allocation.  The  first  is \nbudget transfers, with statistics showing that poor provinces generally received substantial net \ntransfers per capita from the central level. The second is the allocation of state investment, with \nevidence indicating that investment-related resources are skewed toward the richest programs. \nIt can be argued that capital expenditures are more \u201cpro-growth\u201d, and that in the long term, the \nresulting  economic  growth  will  benefit  the  poor.  The  third  are  National  Target  Programs.  The \nbudget  for  targeted  programs  increased  at  an  average  rate  of  25%  over  the  last  three  years, \nhigher  than  the  16%  growth  in  total  expenditure,  reflecting  the  fact  that  more  resources  have \nbeen allocated for pro-poor programs.  \n \n\n4. \n\nTowards PRSC 7 \n\n \n23. \nLooking forward, the World Bank and PRSC stakeholders have considered several key \nreform policies for PRSC 7 in support of the Government\u2019s implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010. \nThese key policies are distilled from SEDP 2006\u20132010, the joint-donor annual analytical report, \nVDR  2007,  and  continuing  policy  dialogue  during  the  loan  fact-finding  (upgraded  to  appraisal) \nmission.  These  key  or  priority  policies,  referred  as  triggers  by  the  World  Bank\u2019s  program \ndocument, are not binding conditions, but rather  serve as a guide to focus the policy dialogue \ntowards PRSC 7.  \n \n24. \nThe  key  policies  that  PRSC  stakeholders  will  focus  on  in  the  coming  year  include \npolicies related to early warning mechanisms to address impacts of World Trade Organization \naccession;  the  lending  policy  of  economic  groups;  participation  of  strategic  partners  in  the \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n41 \n\nequitization of SOCBs;  cost norms systems in the civil works market; tuition fees at secondary \nand  tertiary  levels;  health  insurance  premiums;  voluntary  pension  program  for  farmers  and \ninformal  sector;  guidelines  for  the  Gender  Equality  Law;  forest  development;  integrated  river \nbasin management and the national sanitation strategy; criteria for selecting public investment \nprojects; disclosure of State Audit of Viet Nam reports; and asset declaration by senior officials.  \n \nThe World Bank will assess progress on these key policies towards the end of 2007 in \n25. \norder to launch formal preparation for PRSC 7. Given that these key policies spread across all \nfour pillars of the program, uneven progress may be expected. As a result, such assessment will \nbe holistic, recognizing that some triggers may not be fully met, while the expected targets may \nbe exceeded in other areas.  \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND LETTER OF ASSESSMENT 1 \n\n \n1.       Vietnam\u2019s  economic  performance  has  remained  strong  during  the  first  few  months  of \n2007.  Exports  have  continued  to  grow  briskly,  investment  and  consumption  growth  have \nremained  strong,  and  industrial production has continued  to  expand  at double-digit  rates.  With \nmarket  sentiment  bolstered  by  Vietnam\u2019s  much-awaited  accession  to  the  WTO  on  January  11, \nforeign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio capital inflows have been particularly buoyant, and \nthe overall balance of payments has recorded a sizable surplus. \n\n2.       Growing  access  to  foreign  markets  and  capital  has  created  new  opportunities  for  cost-\neffective  financing  of  Vietnam\u2019s  large  investment  requirements,  but  has  also  created  new \nchallenges. The Ho Chi Minh City Stock Market Price Index rose by 144.5 percent in 2006, and \nby  another  50  percent  in  the  first  two  months  of  2007,  before  retreating  somewhat  in  recent \nmonths.  With  the  number  of  listed  companies  rising  from  41  at  end-2005  to  nearly  200,  the \nmarket\u2019s total capitalization soared from less that VND 10 trillion (1.2 percent of GDP) at end-\n2005 to VND 320 trillion (28 \u00bd percent of GDP) as of mid-May 2007. This unprecedented boom \nin stock prices has reduced the cost of capital for firms, boosted the wealth and consumption of \ndomestic  investors,  and  increased  Vietnam\u2019s  appeal  to  foreign  investors.  At  the  same  time, \nhowever,  the  need  to  contain  the  attendant  risks  to  the  financial  system  has  heightened  the \nurgency  of  policy  measures  to  protect  macroeconomic  stability,  enhance  financial  system \nsurveillance, and improve the governance of state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) and state-\nowned enterprises (SOE). \n\n(i)  Short-Term Outlook and Risks \n\n3.       The prospects for 2007 remain broadly favorable. GDP is projected to continue to expand \nat an annual rate of around 8 percent, led by sustained export and investment growth. While a \npick-up in imports is projected to shift the trade balance back into a deficit, this is likely to be \nmore than financed by continued strong receipts from remittances and capital inflows.  \n\n4.       However,  the  outlook  is  not  without  risks.  Inflation  remains  stubbornly  high,  with  the \ntwelve-month  rate  estimated  to  have  risen  back  above  7  percent  since  April  2007.  Welcome \nadjustments  in  electricity  and  petroleum  prices,  together  with  a  resurfacing  of  food  supply \nshocks, have contributed to the recent uptick in prices. However, large increases in the prices of \nmajor nonfood items also seem to point to growing demand pressures, which may become more \ndifficult  to  contain  as  growing  capital  inflows  complicate  monetary  management.  The  risk  of \nrising inflation could be heightened if a large positive fiscal impulse were to further add to the \ndemand pressures in 2007.  \n\n                                                 \n1  Per  ADB\u2019s  request,  on  8  August  2007  the  Asia  and  Pacific  Department  of  the  International  Monetary \nFund  (IMF)  provided  this  statement,  which  updates  the  IMF  staff\u2019s  assessment  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  current \neconomic situation provided to the Consultative Group (CG) Meeting held in Hanoi on 14-15 December \n2006. The IMF noted that this letter is identical to the IMF staff statement presented at the midterm CG \nmeeting in Halong on 1 June 2007, and has also been used by the World Bank for the PRSC operation \nconsidered by the World Bank's Board of Directors on 21 June 2007. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n43 \n\n5.       Over  the  medium  term,  a  slowdown  in  the  global  economy  or  a  tightening  of  global \nliquidity conditions could expose vulnerabilities in the balance sheets of financial institutions and \nlarge  SOEs,  which  may  have  made  sub-optimal  investment  decisions  during  the  period  of \nbooming  demand.  The  resulting  contingent  government  liabilities,  together  with  continued \nreliance on the state sector to finance the bulk of the country\u2019s huge infrastructure needs, could \neventually threaten debt sustainability. \n\n(ii) Fiscal Policy and Reforms   \n\n6.       The  risk  of  inflation  and  the  need  to  protect  medium-term  debt  sustainability  call  for  a \nmore cautious  fiscal stance. The estimated fiscal deficit recorded a welcome decrease in 2006, \nbut the 2007 Budget appears to be set on an expansionary course. Current expenditure is to be \nboosted by a sharp increase in social expenditures in 2007, after having been fueled largely by \nincreasing  wages  and  oil  subsidies  in  2005\u201306.  While  a  large  oil  revenue  windfall  helped  to \ncontain the overall deficit (based on the Fund\u2019s definition, which includes on-lending through the \nVietnam Development Bank (VDB) and off-budget investment) to less than 4 percent of GDP in \n2006,  full  implementation  of  the  investment  plans  envisaged  in  the  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Program  (SEDP)  for  2006\u20132010  could  raise  the  deficit  to  7 percent  of  GDP  in \n2007. The non-oil deficit would rise from 13\u00bd percent of GDP in 2006 to 15\u00bd percent of GDP \nin  2007,  while  the  public  debt  stock  would  rise  from  about  44 percent  of  GDP  at  end-2006  to \naround  46  percent  of  GDP  by  end-2007.  While  the  concessional  terms  on  most  external  debt, \nwhich  still  accounts  for  more  than  half  of  total  public  debt,  would  help  keep  the  debt  service \nburden  manageable,  growing  recourse  to  market-based  financing  through  the  capital  markets \ncould make the fiscal position more vulnerable to changes in market sentiment. \n\n7.       Given the projected leveling off of oil receipts, the containment of the fiscal deficit will \nrequire a concerted effort to boost non-oil revenues and curb expenditure growth. The reduction \nin import tariff rates associated with WTO accession, and the constraints posed by planned tax \nreforms, call for an accelerated effort to improve tax administration. On the expenditure side, we \nwelcome  the  recent  progress  toward  adjusting  domestic  oil  prices,  and  support  the  authorities\u2019 \ndecision to remove remaining controls over oil prices by the end of 2008. To curb pressures on \nthe  government\u2019s  wage  bill  and  slow  the  growth  of  its  pension  liabilities,  we  encourage  the \nauthorities to discontinue the indexation of public wages and pensions to the common minimum \nwage, and adopt instead a more differentiated and merit-based structure of salary increases in the \ncontext  of  civil  service  reform.  Slowing  the  growth  of  public  investment  is  likely  to  be  a \nchallenge,  given  the  urgent  need  to  ease  the  country\u2019s  serious  infrastructure  bottlenecks.  To \nensure  continued  development  of  essential  public  infrastructure,  more  proactive  steps  to \nencourage private participation could be considered. Projects still funded through the issuance of \ninvestment bonds or on-lending should be subject to rigorous screening and monitoring, and the \ncredit  appraisal  and  risk  management  capacities  of  the  Vietnam  Development  Bank  (VDB) \nstrengthened. Effective enforcement of the new laws to curb corruption and prevent the waste of \npublic funds would need to be an integral part of this effort. \n\n(iii) Monetary Policy and Exchange System Reform \n\n8.       A more restrained monetary policy will likely be required to contain inflation, and limit \nthe  potential  expansion  of  nonperforming  loans  (NPLs).  Credit  growth  has  showed  signs  of \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nreacceleration in recent months, with the rate of growth of credit to the economy rising from 23 \npercent in the year to September 2006 to about 29 percent in the year to February 2007. While \nthe authorities\u2019 monetary program for 2007 envisages a slowing of credit growth to 20 percent \nby year-end, the achievement of this objective is threatened by ample excess bank liquidity. The \nauthorities\u2019 recent efforts to introduce prudential restraints on commercial bank lending for stock \nmarket purchases are welcome steps, which should help reduce banks\u2019 exposure to stock market \nrisks and guard against a potentially costly boom-bust cycle in stock prices. The authorities also \nneed  to  take  more  pro-active  measures  to  mop  up  excess  liquidity,  including  by  allowing  the \nState Bank of Vietnam (SBV) to exercise adequate autonomy in the issuance of SBV bills.  \n\n9.       Vietnam\u2019s  rapid  integration  into  the  global  economy  calls  for  continued  efforts  to \nincrease  exchange  rate  flexibility.  The  authorities  have  recently  taken  welcome  steps  in  this \ndirection. In January 2007, the trading band of the dong vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. dollar was widened \nfrom +/-0.25 percent to +/-0.5 percent around the daily reference rate set by the SBV, and the \ndong  temporarily  appreciated  as  the  pace  of  inflows  peaked  in  January-February  2007.  In  the \nface  of  continuing  large  foreign  exchange  inflows,  further  steps  to  increase  exchange  rate \nflexibility would serve to stem inflationary pressures while decreasing the need for sterilization. \nA  more  flexible  exchange  rate  policy  could  also  mitigate  the  potential  disruptive  effects  of  a \npossible  future  reversal  of  capital  inflows  by  encouraging  economic  agents  to  better  hedge \nexchange rate risks and allowing the exchange rate to play a greater role as a shock absorber.   \n \nBank Reform and Financial Sector Supervision \n \n10.       Bank  reform  remains  key  to  improving  the  allocation  of  saving  and  investment  and \nprotecting financial stability. The growing possibilities for financing through the capital market, \nincreasing  competition  from  joint-stock  banks,  and  the  new  regime  of  liberal  entry  of  fully \nforeign-owned  banks,  have  increased  the  urgency  of  SOCB  reform.  In  this  context,  the \ngovernment\u2019s  renewed  commitment  to  proceed  with  the  equitization  of  the  main  SOCBs  is \nwelcome,  as  is  the  recent  increase  in  the  ceiling  for  participation  by  individual  strategic \ninvestors.  We  also  welcome  the  recent  adoption  of  an  SOCB  recapitalization  plan,  and  look \nforward  to  the  upcoming  publication  of  financial  reports  of  the  SOCBs  based  on  International \nAccounting Standards. These steps need to be backed by timely action to improve the corporate \ngovernance of SOCBs, including by providing their managers with adequate autonomy to make \nlending decisions based on purely commercial criteria.  \n  \n11.       The growing scope for securities market operations and portfolio capital movements also \ncalls  for  further  steps  to  strengthen  prudential  regulation  of  bank  and  nonbank  financial \ninstitutions. We  support the  authorities\u2019  medium-term  plans to  convert  the  SBV  into a  modern \ncentral bank, and to grant it adequate authority and independence to carry out an anti-inflationary \nmonetary policy and effective financial sector supervision. In the meantime, it is important that \nthe  SBV,  the  State  Securities  Commission  (SSC),  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  improve  the \ntracking  of  vulnerabilities  associated  with  stock  market-related  risks  and  capital  movements. \nGiven  the  risks posed by  related  transactions  among banks,  their  securities  company  affiliates, \nand  the  buyers  or  issuers  of  securities,  a  concerted  effort  is  required  to  regulate  stock  market-\nrelated  credit  and  discourage  insider  trading.  Controls  also  need  to  be  put  in  place  to  prohibit \nrelated-party transactions within economic groups involved in a mix of industrial operations and \nfinancial services. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n45 \n\n \nState-Owned Enterprise Reform and Private Sector Development \n \n12.       The  authorities\u2019  plans  to  restructure  and  equitize  SOEs  are  welcome.  However,  it  will \nalso be important that SOE managers be granted clear incentives and full autonomy to make their \nown  pricing  and  investment  decisions  on  commercial  principles,  and  the  entry  of  foreign \nstrategic  investors  should  be  encouraged  to  facilitate  the  needed  improvement  in  SOE \ngovernance.  The  mandates  of  economic  groups  of  wholly  state-owned  enterprises,  and  their \nrelations  with  government,  should  be  clearly  defined,  and  regulatory  safeguards  established, \nwhere needed, to ensure that their market power will not be used to undermine competition. \n \n13.       A more transparent and market-friendly legal and regulatory framework would be key to \nenabling Vietnam to capitalize on its growing appeal to foreign investors. We welcome plans to \nalign energy prices with world market conditions, and urge the authorities to also remove other \nremaining  price  controls  that  discourage  private  investment.  To  further  level  the  playing  field, \nsimplify rules and regulations, and improve the business climate, we encourage the authorities to \nswiftly  adopt  pending  legislation  and  associated  implementing  decrees  and  circulars  in  full \nconformity with Vietnam\u2019s WTO commitments. \n \n14.       The  quality,  timeliness,  and  dissemination  of  macroeconomic  statistics  and  Financial \nStability Indicators will also need to be improved to support informed policy decisions and build \nenduring  investor  confidence.  In  this  regard,  we  support  the  authorities\u2019  ongoing  efforts  to \ndevelop better measures of core inflation and look forward to the issuance of the government\u2019s \nfirst  semi-annual  Debt  Bulletin.  More  transparent  accounting,  reporting,  and  monitoring  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s extra-budgetary operations and all publicly-funded projects would also be helpful \nin reassuring donors that their assistance is being put to the best use. \n \nConcluding Remarks \n \n15.       Vietnam\u2019s  historic  accession  to  the  WTO  attests  to  its  impressive  economic  progress \nsince  the  launching  of  the  policy  of  Doi  Moi  some  twenty  years  ago.  In  the  coming  years, \ndeepening economic and financial integration should facilitate achievement of the government\u2019s \nambitious objectives to lift Vietnam from the ranks of low-income countries by 2010 and join the \nranks of industrial countries by 2020. However, growing exposure to global markets has made it \nall the more important that macroeconomic policies be kept on a sound footing and the pace of \nmarket-oriented reforms accelerated. We have no doubt that, with the continued good judgment \nof  its leadership, Vietnam will successfully meet these challenges, and we wish the authorities \nevery success in these endeavors. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nSector \n\nGlobal \nintegration  \n\nState \nsector \nreform \n\nPOLICY MATRIX AND COMPLIANCE STATUS \n \nTable A4.1:  Policy Matrix \n \n\nPolicy Actions  \n\nPillar I: Business Development \n\n1.

This period has also seen considerable progress in social indicators, with Viet \nNam  now  being  on  a  solid  track  to  attain  or  exceed  most  if  not  all  of  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Over these five years, considerable progress was made in public financial \nmanagement, public administration reform and the strengthening of governance more broadly. \n \nThese successes reflect the reform drive of our government, as expresses among others in the \nComprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  (CPRGS).  The  CPRGS,  which  was \nsupported by the Asian Development Bank and many other donors, jointly with other plans and \nstrategic  documents  of  our  government,  served  as  the  basis  for  a  continuous  policy  dialogue \nacross a range of policy areas. PRSC operations provided an effective platform to conduct such \ndialogue,  refine  the  content  and  articulation  of  policy  reforms  and  channel  resources  to  our \nbudget  to  finance  their  implementation.  The  usefulness  of  this  approach  is  confirmed  by  the \nincreasingly  large  number  of  donors  participating  in  PRSCs.  The  commitment  of  our \ngovernment to the process is reflected in the timely completion of the annual operations in the \ncycles. \n \nBuilding on the successes of economic reforms over the previous five years, Viet Nam\u2019s Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan (SEDP) for 2006-2010 was approved by the National Assembly on \nJune  29  2006.  In  October  2006,  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors  of  the  Asian  Development \nBank  approved  the  Country  Strategy  and  Program  2007-2010  based  on  the  approved  SEDP \n2006-2010. \n \nA key goal of the SEDP is to sustain rapid economic growth so that Viet Nam can move out of \nlow  income  status  by  2010  and  lay  the  foundations  to  become  an  industrial  country  by  2020. \nThe  SEDP  affirms  that  rapid  growth  should  go  hand  in  hand  with  improved  sustainability,  and \nimproved  quality  and  competitiveness  of  the  economy.  Importance  is  attached  to  in-depth \ndevelopment  while  wider  development  should  not  be  forgotten.  Economic  growth  should  be \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nlinked  with  poverty  reduction,  cultural  development,  comprehensive  human  development, \nexercise of democracy and social equity. The SEDP also aims to narrow the development gaps \namong regions, step by step, while preserving and improving the environment. We would like to \ndraw your attention to the Chapter IV of the SEDP which provides the Development Orientation \nof various sectors over the period 2006-2010. \n \nOverall, the objectives, tasks and solutions of the SEDP can be mapped on to three pillars (a) \nbusiness development (b) natural resources and the environment and (c) social equity. Chapter \nIV  highlights  the  goals,  tasks,  and  solutions  for  achieving  agricultural  development,  industrial \nmodernization,  and  services  sector  growth.  Chapter  VII  of  the  SEDP  identifies  the  roles  of \nvarious  sectors  in  business  development,  including  the  role  of  the  private  sector  as  a  driving \nforce.  We aim  to create  favorable conditions for  the development of  the private sector  without \nlimiting its scales, fields or regions. Chapter IV.B details the goals, tasks, and solutions for the \nsocial sectors, while Chapter IV.C identifies goals and policies for the sustainable development \nof natural resources and protection of the environment. \n \nIn  order  to  achieve  the  objectives  of  economic  growth,  business  development,  environment \nsustainability  and  social  equity  we  need  to  improve  the  institutional  framework  of  the  socialist \noriented  market  economy  in  a  comprehensive  manner.  The  measures  to  this  effect  are \nespecially  highlighted  in  Chapter  IX.  The  chapter  emphasizes  legal  reforms  for  supporting  a \nmarket  economy,  the  importance  of  improving  the  quality  of  public  administration,  and \nstrengthening the fight against corruption. \n \nThe  government\u2019s  resolution  No.  3/22006/NQ-CP  identifies  the  tasks  of  various  ministries  and \nagencies  for  implementing  the  SEDP  and  the  state  budget  during  this  year.  This  resolution \naffirms our commitment to successfully achieving the targets identified in the SEDP. \n \nThe tasks listed in this resolution bear a close resemblance with the policy actions and triggers \nidentified in the proposed credit. Jointly with the following operations in the series, the proposed \nseries effectively supports the implementation of the reform agenda outlined in the SEDP. The \nproposed credit also contributes to harmonization, in the spirit of the Hanoi Core Statement of \nAid  Effectiveness.  Our  government  appreciates  the  technical  inputs  provided  through  this \nprocess,  as  well  as  the  resources  to  implement  policy  reforms  and  the  reduced  transaction \ncosts in conducting the policy dialogue with the donor community.  \n \nOur  government  therefore  requests  the  Association\u2019s  assistance  through  this  sixth  PRSC,  in \nrecognition  for  the  progress  made  in  the  implementation  of  our  development  strategy.  We \nrecognize that many difficult challenges lie ahead, but we are confident that we will be able to \novercome them. We hope that we will count on the support of the Association during this five-\nyear  cycle,  as  we  make  progress  to  implement  the  reform  program,  with  the  ambition  of \nbecoming a middle-income country by the end of the decade. \n \nWe look forward to your continued support. \n \n \nYours sincerely, \n \n \nNguyen Van Giau \nGovernor  \nState Bank of Viet Nam \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n59           \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY STRATEGY AND ASSESSMENT \n \n\nTable A8.1: \n\nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam:  \n \nThe  program  loan  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  supporting  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  5-year \nsocioeconomic development plan (SEDP), covering 2006\u20132010. The program loan in the form of a poverty reduction \nsupport credit (PRSC) is a multisector instrument covering a range of issues in a broad-based reform agenda related \nto  poverty  reduction  through  four  main  reform  areas:  (i)  business  development,  (ii)  social  inclusion,  (iii)  natural \nresources,  and  (iii)  modern  governance.  The  SEDP  2006\u20132010  clearly  spells  out  the  Government\u2019s  priorities.  It \ncontains a long list of policy actions to be adopted in a 5-year cycle through support by PRSCs 6\u201310. The SEDP is \nregarded as the national poverty reduction strategy, which aims to reduce poverty and improve social service delivery \nand other social indicators in a sustainable, equitable, and cost-effective manner. The program loan, which follows the \nPRSC  6  policy  framework,  calls  for  further  acceleration  of  policy  changes  and  reforms  that  (i)  increase  efficiency, \ntransparency, and accountability; and (ii) stimulate growth, thereby reducing poverty and improving social services to \npoor  people.  The  SEDP  and  the  program  loan  are  thus  consistent  with  the  poverty  reduction  strategy,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) country strategy and program for Viet Nam 2007\u20132010,1 and the attainment of the Viet Nam \nDevelopment Goals (the country\u2019s version of the Millennium Development Goals). \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nB. \n \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe  SEDP  2006\u20132010  presents  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  poverty  in  Viet  Nam.  The  text  includes  candid \ndiscussions  and  reflects  wide  stakeholder  consultation  regarding  disadvantaged  groups.  A  comprehensive  poverty \nupdate was also carried out by the Vietnamese Academy on Social Sciences2 in early 2007, based on the household \nsurvey  of  2004.  ADB,  jointly  with  other  academic  and  government  institutions,  also  carried  out  analysis  regarding \npoverty as background to the preparation of PRSC 6.3  ADB also prepared the country poverty assessment to provide \nanalytical  inputs  to  the  preparation  of  PRSC  6  and  the  country  strategy  and  program  2007\u20132010.  The  Government \nhas  allowed  for  the  collection  of  more  reliable  data  through  biannual  household  surveys,  building  on  the  already-\nimproved  2004  survey  quality.  Monitoring  of  progress  towards  development  outcomes  cannot  be  conducted  on  an \nannual basis, however. \n \nThe  comprehensive  Viet  Nam  Development  Report  2007,  Aiming  High,  preparation  of  which  began  shortly  after \napproval  of  the  SEDP  by  the  National  Assembly,  was  co-signed  by  16  donors,  and  provides  the  main  analytical \nunderpinning for the new PRSC cycles. A background, independent evaluation of the first series of PRSCs was also \ncommissioned as part of the report.     \n\nViet Nam\u2019s economic performance over the last 5 years has been strong, particularly in relation to poverty reduction. \nProgress in poverty reduction has been slower for Viet Nam\u2019s ethnic minorities, among whom the poverty incidence \nreached 61% in 2004, compared to 14% for the majority Kinh-Hoa group. The main perceived causes of poverty are (i) \npoor infrastructure; (ii) poor factor markets; (iii) ineffectiveness of Government policies and programs at the grassroots \nlevel;  (iv)  lack  of  transparency  and  accountability;  (v)  lack  of  participation  by  people  in  decision  making;  (vi)  weak \ncapacity  of  local  government  staff:  (vii)  lack  of  land,  capital  and  labor;  (viii)  poor  health;  and  (ix)  harsh  climatic \nconditions.  Challenges  remain  regarding  (i) the quality of growth,  (ii) participation of the poor in the growth process, \n(iii) insurance  and  the  social  protection  system,   (iv)  poverty  reduction  for  ethnic  minorities  in  lagging regions,   \n\n \n\nHanoi. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Thus, a careful approach (in terms of planning, delivery \nand  transfers)  will  be  required.  This  is  reflected  in  the  implementation  of  the  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  With  a  sound  and \nsustainable strategy at hand, the challenge now lies in implementation.  \n \nThe Government is aware of the challenges it faces, and prepared an explicit section on ethnic support in the SEDP \n2006\u20132010. The Government also has preferential and special programs for the poor and special programs for ethnic \npeople in these regions, e.g., the comprehensive Hunger Eradication and Poverty Reduction Program 2006-2010 and \nother targeted programs, such as Program 135, which are in place and have generally benefited the poor. Features \nthat  will  increase  the  effectiveness  of  the  two  programs  designed  for  2006\u20132010  include  further  decentralization,  a \nfocus on capacity building, and participation by affected people in planning, monitoring and evaluation.  \n\nB. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nPRSCs retain good policy lending practices with stakeholder engagement. Policy dialogues between donors and the \nGovernment  are  broad  in  nature,  encompassing  all  major  policy  areas.  The  Government  took  strong  ownership  in \nseeking  the  views  and  perspectives  of  other  related  line  ministries  and  development  partners,  and  the  civil  society, \nwith respect to the lessons from, advantages of and challenges for the PRSCs.4 The PRSCs are found to be relevant \nin that they align with objectives of SEDP 2006\u20132010. The Government and development partners both support the \nongoing  government  reforms,  while  stakeholders\u2019  perspectives  have  been  well  captured  in  the  policy  action \nnegotiation process for PRSC 6.   \n\n \n\n  No \n\n  Yes   \n\nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nFormulation  of  the  SEDP  and  PRSCs  (and  thus  the  program  loan)  involved  comprehensive  consultations  and \ndiscussions with a wide range of stakeholders. The process leading to the preparation of the SEDP 2006\u20132010 had \nimportant  strengths  compared  to  preceding  processes.  There  was  a  serious  effort  to  collect  inputs  from  different \ngroups of the Vietnamese society. In addition to internal discussions within government, consultation workshops were \nheld with local officials, groups of academics, the domestic business sector, international and local nongovernmental \norganizations (NGOs), people living with disabilities (PWD), overseas Vietnamese, women and women\u2019s groups, and \ndonors.  A  series  of  participatory  research  exercises  involving  local  experts  and  international  NGOs  also  helped  to \ngather feedback from poor communities in 17 sites across the country. The draft SEDP was declassified for the first \ntime ever, and was discussed by the National Assembly in November 2005, a departure from previous practice that \nscheduled National Assembly discussions after the Party Congress. The SEDP 2006\u20132010 is also accompanied by a \nresults framework based on stakeholder consultations.   \n\nD. \n\nGender Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe SEDP and PRSC 6 support actions to benefit women. The Government is committed to gender equality through \npolicies  and  actions  that  will  require  gender-sensitive  implementation  of  the  program  loan.  The  National  Assembly \npassed the Law on Gender Equality in November 2006, which relates to equal rights for women in labor, employment, \neducation, and health care. Increases in the number of woman candidates for leadership positions at all levels and in \nall  sectors  and  strengthening  of  the  mechanisms  for  the  advancement  of  women  are  also  required.  The  new  law \nunifies  a  legal  framework  to  address  gender  disparities  and  increase women\u2019s  participation  in  decision making. The \nGovernment has signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) \nand  successfully  presented  its  fourth  and  fifth  report  to  the  CEDAW  committee  in  January  2007.  The  National \nCommittee  for  the  Advancement  of  Women  comprises  18  members  at  the  deputy-minister  level  from  key  ministries \nand central organizations. The national strategy for the advancement of women in Viet Nam approved the Third Action \nPlan For Womens Advancement to 2010.  While gender equality indicators are better in Viet Nam than in many other \ndeveloping countries, steps are being taken to narrow the remaining gaps. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \nA  social  and  poverty  impact  assessment  of  the  program  loan  was  prepared  and  finalized  in  February  2006  for  the \npreceding loan to cofinance PRSC 5. The assessment includes an assessment on gender, as well as the impact of the \nprogram loan on gender development. From the assessment, the overall impact on gender is expected to be positive. \n \n\n   Yes \n\n   No \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB. 2006.

In 2006, \nADB and the Committee for Ethnic Minorities completed a \njoint northern mountainous areas situational analysis that \nreviews resettlement policies in the region. These studies \nwere used as inputs for the preparation of PRSCs 6\u201310. \n\nthrough \n\nTargeted programs are already in place to assist the poor \nin need of social services. Early in 2006, the Government \napproved a second phase for the Hunger Eradication and \nPoverty Reduction Program and Program 135 (relating to \nsocioeconomic  development  in  communes  with  extreme \ndifficulties) \n2010.  The  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme  and  some  other  development \npartners  are  supporting  the  Government  in  developing \nthe  Government\u2019s \nclearer  guidelines \ncapacity  at  all  levels  to  better  undertake  these  targeted \nprograms.  Development  partners  have  coordinated  as \nenvisaged  in  the  Hanoi  Core  Statement  (June  2005)  to \ndevelop  a  plan  to  ensure  readiness  and  synergy  of \nnumerous projects supporting  the Government\u2019s targeted \nprograms. \n\nincrease \n\nthat \n\nThe problems of labor redundancy in rural areas and lack \nof  off-farm  work  are  slowly  being  resolved  through \neconomic restructuring. However, according to studies on \nWorld  Trade  Organization  accession  by  the  World  Bank \nand  Vietnamese  Academy  of  Social  Science,  this  will \nhave little impact on labor redundancy and  the challenge \nof  acquiring  more  highly  skilled \nin  several \ncompetitive  export  sectors.  Urban  labor  and  the  labor \nmarket  become  unstable,  especially  when  faced  with \nmigrants.  Negative  labor  impacts  will  be  minimized  by \nsome  government  measures,  such  as  the  creation  of  an \nenvironment  conducive  to  and  market  for  labor  export, \npromotion  of  vocational  training,  and  development  of  a \nviable voluntary  social  insurance system. The  labor  code \nwas revised in early 2007. Although the Social Insurance \nLaw  was  passed  in  2006,  the  unemployment  insurance \nprogram will not be formally launched until 2010.   \n\nlabor \n\nAlthough  the  record  on  poverty  reduction  has  been \nimpressive, a potential risk exists in the medium- to long- \nterm  for  increased  disparities  between  the  majority  Kinh \nand  ethnic  minorities.

The \nstrategy  addresses  revisions  to  the  5  million  hectare \nForest  Plan,  and  aims  to  improve  the  balance  between \nforest protection, multi-purpose forestation and policies to \nencourage farmers to live with the forests.  \nBased on the Grassroots Democracy Ordinance, issued in \n2007,  effective  grassroots  democracy  requires  increased \nparticipation by ethnic people. Public administrative reform \nis resulting in the training and retraining of local groups of \nethnic  minorities,  while  other  programs  in  education  and \nhealth  address  access  to  social  services  by  ethnic \nminorities.  Through  the  country\u2019s  decentralization  policy \nand  promotion  of  grassroots  democracy, \nindigenous \npeoples  can  better  influence  spending  decisions  for \nallocated funds and ensure these meet their needs.   \n\nfunctions  of \n\nillustrate \n\nThe  Government  is  responding  to  the  evolving  HIV/AIDS \nepidemic.

The poor who moved out of \npoverty also moved out of farming \n\u2022 Some reform measures could have \nadverse social impacts and result in \ndistress land sales. \n\u2022 The poor and middle poor should \nbenefit from jobs and credit \nopportunities offered by local \nenterprises and by expanding \nhousehold businesses.  \n\nregistration of LUCs, and \nimproved tenure rights to \nforestland will improve access to \nland and security.  \n\u2022 As the land market develops, \nhouseholds could gradually be \nforced to sell some land.  \n\u2022 Equitization and restructuring \nof state-owned forest enterprises \nmay lead to encroachment on \nforest land by outsiders. \n \nIndirect Short Term \n\u2022 The policy to encourage labor \nmigration to specific regions (like \nCentral Highlands) during 1980s \nfor economic purpose and the \nresulted free movement of labor \nover the last 10 years have made \nhill-tribe ethnic minority people \nbecome vulnerable to retain their \ntraditional livelihood.

The \nEducation for All \nProgram is already in \nplace. \n\u2022 A multisector action \nprogram to implement an \nHIV/AIDS strategy has \nbeen adopted, and a \npublic health program to \ntackle the HIV/AIDs \nepidemic is proposed. \n \n \n\n \n\u2022  Programs that directly \ntransfer resources are \nalready in place (e.g., the \nSocial Safety Net Fund, \nheath care funds for the \npoor, HEPRP, Education \nfor All). \n\u2022 Budget allocations that \nredress regional \ninequalities, population \ndistribution, and ethnic \nminority percentages are \nneeded. The new \nProgram 135 and \nHEPRP follow the \nincome distribution \nprinciple, using the \npoverty rate. The \nallocation of state capital \nexpenditures also uses \nspecific criteria, including \nthe poverty rate and \nethnicity.   \n\u2022 Budget transfers from \nthe provinces that benefit \nthose who are adversely \naffected will reduce gaps \nbetween provinces and \nsupport social inclusion. \n \n\n\fAppendix 8         67 \n\n \n\nInformation Basis and Crucial Assumptions: \n \nThe  program  loan  will  support  the  provision  of  reforms  and  policies  that  will  stimulate  and  promote  sustainable, \nequitable  growth,  as  stipulated  in  the  Sixth  Poverty  Reduction  Support  Credit  (PRSC  6)  documents,  in  four  main \nareas.  \nFirst,  it  will  promote  business  development.  Under  PRSC  6  the  most  important  priority  actions  in  relation  to  global \nintegration were the granting of trading and distribution rights to all foreign firms in line with international commitments \nand  issuance  of  regulations  to  guide  the  intellectual  property  law,  with  enforcement  mechanisms.  SOE  reform  was \naccelerated by divestiture of SOEs and SOCBs, through established use of share auctions and a sound mechanism of \nequitization allowing participation by foreign strategic investors. Banking reform is ongoing, with (i) the introduction of \nprivate capital in SOCBs, (ii) elimination of non-commercial objectives as a consideration in lending decisions, and (iii) \nrequirements  that  financial  statements  be  disclosed  in  line  with  international  standards.  Private  sector  growth  will  \nimprove  with  removal  of  administrative  barriers  and  reform  of  the  business  registration  process.  The  increase  in \nefficiency  of  public  resource  in  providing  infrastructure  coupled  with  the  increase  in  volume  of  private  funding  in \ninfrastructure enable for businesses to continue to grow and generate sustainable economic growth.  \nSecond, it will (i) reduce poverty and ensure social inclusion through an expanded budget appropriation; (ii) establish \nquality  standards  for  education;  (iii)    provide  resources  to  cover  the  health  care  costs  of  the  poor;  (iv)  establish \nmechanisms  to  complete  the  transfer  of  land-use  rights  to  households,  and  (v)  protect  property  and  resources,  \nespecially in upland and ethnic minority areas. The pension program was improved but will still need to implement the \nSocial  Insurance  Law  to  (i)  cover  informal  sector  workers  and  farmers  under  a  voluntary  pension  program,  and  (ii) \nincrease  the  financial  viability  of  the  system.  The  Law  on  Gender  Equality  needs  to  be  put  into  practice,  with  clear \nguidelines and enforcement capacities. \nThird,  it  will  address  the  management  of  the  environment  and  natural  resources  in  a  sustainable  manner.  Rapid \nurbanization  and  infrastructure  growth  require  improvements  in  land  management  and  proper  urban  planning. \nMeasures  to  improve  environmental  and  water  resources  management  will  also  be  required  through  compulsory \nparticipatory environment impact assessments for large projects.  \nFourth,  it  will  build  institutions  that  can  support  the  SEDP  implementation  through  increased  transparency  and \naccountability  of  public  finances,  promotion  of  simplified  administrative  procedures,  reduction  of  corruption,  and \nrevamping of planning processes as part of a broader effort to build modern governance.  \nViet  Nam\u2019s  economic  performance  was  remarkable  over  the  last  five  years.  Poverty  reduction  has  been  more  rapid \nthan  in  other  countries  in  the  region,  although  progress  in  poverty  reduction  has  been  slower  for  Viet  Nam\u2019s  ethnic \nminorities. Inadequate progress on enhancing budget transparency and tackling corruption is associated with fiduciary \nrisk. At the same time, fast integration with the world economy may lead to increased inequality, at least temporarily, \nas the benefits accrue to specific regions. Growth in Viet Nam could become less inclusive in the years to come. \nPRSC  is  a  vehicle  for  the  Asian  Development  Bank  to  work  together  and  more  broadly  with  other  members  of  the \nofficial development assistance community, in delivering economic growth and poverty reduction. Active engagement \nwill  strengthen  the  coherence  of  the  program,  especially  in  providing  an  exceptional  window  for  high-level  policy \naccess, and not just as an aid instrument. The reforms will result in increased private investment and exports, which \nwill lead to additional job creation. Further decentralization of public administration, leading to better service delivery to \nthe poor and increased local beneficiary participation, are other expected benefits.  \nStrong  direct  and  indirect  benefits  are  expected  to  reach  the  poor  through  improved  service  delivery,  decentralized \nplanning, and promotion of beneficiary participation. The Government has implemented several special programs and \npolicies to (i) ensure the poor have access to jobs, basic health services, education, and infrastructure, especially in \nthe mountainous regions and in poor urban areas; and (ii) enhance the well-being of ethnic minorities. Decentralization \nshould  make  local  government  more  accountable  to  the  poorest  for  their  participation  in  decision  making  on \ndevelopment programs and delivery of services. Measures have been implemented to ensure participation by the poor \nin the planning and decision-making process, and efforts to increase their participation will have positive impacts that \ninclude  (i)  increased  efficiency  of  small  infrastructure  planning  in  selected  projects  run  by  the  Government  or \nsupported  by  ODA  funds;  and  (ii)  enhanced  ownership  of  the  government  through  budget  support,  mobilization  and \nincrease budget transparency as required by the Budget Law.  \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n           \n\nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \n \n\nimported  goods  (excluding  any  duties  or \n\nThe proceeds of the loan will be utilized to finance foreign exchange expenditures for the \n1. \nreasonable  cost  of \ntaxes)  required  during \nimplementation  of  the  program  loan  for  Support  the  Implementation  of  the  Poverty  Reduction \nProgram.
