Initial  environmental  examinations  were  undertaken \nfor sample subprojects.  \n \nThe  Western  Basins  Water  Resources  Management  Project  (the \nProject)  will  support  infrastructure  development,  strengthening  of \nfor  water \nframeworks,  and  capacity  development \ninstitutional \nresources  management  and  irrigated  agriculture  in  the  western \nbasins of Afghanistan (Badghis, Ghowr, and Herat provinces), mainly \ncomprising the Hari Rud River Basin, which includes Herat, and the \nfour  components:  (i) \nMurghab  River  Basin.  The  Project  has \nintegrated  water \n(ii)  water \nresources  management \nresources  and  irrigation  development,  (iii)  agriculture  and  livelihood \nservices, and (iv) capacity development and project management. \n \nThe IWRM component will support technical studies for surface and \ngroundwater  to  improve  the  knowledge  base  to  manage  water \nresources  in  the  Hari  Rud  River  Basin.  The  Project  also  seeks  to \nstrengthen the institutional frameworks and capacity for surface water \nallocation  and  groundwater  management  as  a  part  of  river  basin \nmanagement.  It  will  support  the  eventual  formation  of  a  river  basin \nauthority  in  line  with  the  water  resources  policy  of  the  Ministry  of \nEnergy  and  Water  (MEW).  The  Project  will  support  development  of \nplanning  and  management  options  through  the  river  basin  authority \nto  allocate  water  resources  efficiently  and  equitably  for  basin \ndevelopment. \n \nThe  water  resources  and  irrigation  development  component  will \nprovide  for  the  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  (R&U)  of  55,000  to \n65,000  hectares  (ha)  of  traditional  irrigation  systems.  Traditional \nirrigation makes up over 80% of the irrigated area in Afghanistan; the \nsystems were developed by communities as long as 700 years ago. \nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  entire  systems  and  enhance  system \nintakes improving their capture efficiency and increasing late season \nwater  supplies.  The  Project  will  also  provide  capacity  development \nfor   MEW   staff   (the Irrigation Department)  as  well   as for  mirabs,\n \n\n(IWRM), \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\nProject Description \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nRationale \n\n \n\niii\n\ntrials.  The  Project  will  provide \n\nwho  are  the  traditional  community  managers  of  irrigation  systems \nand responsible for overseeing system management and operation \nand maintenance (O&M). The Project will also support development \nof small-scale water resources infrastructure. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  agriculture  and  livelihood  services  component  will \nensure  that  the  improved  water  supply  from  the  irrigation  system \nR&U is used most effectively to increase the productivity of irrigated \nagriculture  and  that  project  benefits  are  equitably  distributed.  This \ncomponent  will  also  ensure  that  farmers  have  viable  alternatives  to \npoppy production, although poppy is not widely grown in the western \nbasins. On-farm water management training will be given for farmers \nand mirabs. Agricultural extension will be provided to improve wheat \nyields  (the  primary  staple  crop  grown  by  most  farmers)  and  to \nstimulate second season, higher value horticulture crops. The Project \nwill  support  farmer  training,  demonstration  plots,  and  community-\nincome-generating \ndeveloped \nopportunities  targeted  at  women  and  the  landless  through  training, \nstart-up materials, and ongoing technical support. Possible activities \nwill  include  mulberry  and  sericulture  (silkworm  raising),  poultry \nraising, and livestock programs. \n \nGiven  Afghanistan\u2019s  severe  capacity  constraints,  the  Project  will \nfeature  an  important  and  cross-cutting  capacity  development \ncomponent. The Project will provide training, equipment, and other \nresource  materials \nfarmers,  and \nparticipants in the livelihoods services activities. Both domestic and \ninternational education will be supported through the Project. \n \nWater \nirrigated  agriculture  are \nfundamental  to  the  well-being  of  the  national  economy,  the  rural \nsector,  and  poverty  reduction.  Irrigated  agriculture  produces  up  to \n80% of total agricultural output, with agriculture comprising between \n50% and 60% of the national economy and employing up to 80% of \nthe  country\u2019s  population.  Farmers  throughout  the  country  have \ncited \nthe  primary  constraint  to \nagricultural  productivity.  A  drought  in  2004  caused  the    projected \n16% annual   growth  in  gross    domestic  product  to  be  revised\n \n \n\nresources  management  and \n\nfor  ministry  staff,  mirabs, \n\nirrigation  water  as \n\nlack  of \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe  productivity  of \n\nirrigated  agriculture \n\ndownward  to  8%  and  resulted  in  some  2.5  million  Afghans \nexperiencing  food  insecurity.  Developing  water  resources  and \nimproving \nthus  are \nparamount  to  sustaining  economic  growth  and  addressing  rural \npoverty.  Agriculture  uses  95%  of  developed  water  supplies,  so \nenhancement  of  irrigated  agriculture  must  be  pursued  in  parallel \nwith strengthening water resources management. \n \nDecades of civil unrest have impeded maintenance and repairs to the \nexisting  irrigation  systems  of  the  western  basins,  and  they  are  in \nurgent  need  of  assistance,  with  the  entire  canal  networks  needing \nR&U. The irrigation systems can also be rationalized to operate more \nefficiently and increase the total irrigated area. Canal intakes can be \nupgraded  to  increase  capture  of  low  season  flows  and  to  prevent \nflood  damage  and  sediment  deposition.  Because  of  the  degraded \ncondition  of  systems,  cropping  intensity  in  the  western  basins  was \nonly 40% at the end of the severe drought from 1999 to 2001. Mirabs \nand communities have traditionally provided management and O&M \nfor the systems. However, given the extremely dilapidated condition \nof  the  irrigation  systems,  additional  resources  and  technical  support \nare  needed  beyond  what the  mirabs and community can  provide  to \n(i)  return  the  systems  to  good  condition  to  ensure  that  communities \ncan  sustain  their  operation,  and  (ii)  enhance  their  performance  for \nmore productive irrigated agriculture. R&U of the systems will provide \nmore  reliable  water  supply  thereby  increasing  the  irrigated  area, \nimproving  yields  for  first  season  crops,  and  providing  for  more \nopportunities and better yields for second season crops.  \n \nImproving  the  management  of  surface  water,  groundwater,  and \nwater  quality  in  the  Hari  Rud  River  Basin  is  critical  to  agricultural \nintensification  and  economic  growth.  Although  traditional  water \nallocations among irrigation systems exist, these allocations need to \nbe  rationalized.  Significant  groundwater  potential  exists,  but \navailable  information  is  inadequate  to  manage  its  sustainable \nexploitation.  An  improved  institutional  framework  and  capacity \ndevelopment are also required to manage such activities. \n \nFarmers  have  been  living  with  uncertain  water  supply  and  thus \nengaging  in  relatively  low  productivity  agriculture  for  centuries. \nWheat  is  mainly  planted  in  the  winter  or  spring  and  is  the  primary \nirrigated  crop  taken  in  the  spring.  Yields  of  irrigated  wheat  are \ntypically  low  at  2.0  tons/ha  in  the  Hari  Rud  River  Valley,  although \nrainfed yields are even lower at less than 1 ton/ha. Limited summer \ncrops  are  taken  when  and  where  water  is  available;  in  upstream \nareas rice is taken as a second crop in addition to vegetables. The \noutput of   vineyards   and  orchards  has   declined   due  to neglect \nduring  the  civil  unrest as  well  as  recent drought.  With  improved \n \n \n\n\f \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \n\nv\n\nirrigation  systems  and  water  supply,  significant  opportunities  exist \nfor  farmers  to  improve  agricultural  productivity  through  better  on-\nfarm  water  management  with  better  agricultural  practices  from \nextension activities. \n \nIn  summary,  the  western  basins  have  significant  potential  for \nagriculture \nirrigation \nsystems,  and  exploitation  of  groundwater.  However,  farmers  need \nassistance  to  manage  water  most  effectively  and  agricultural \nsupport take advantage of cropping opportunities. \n \n\nthrough  R&U  of  existing \n\nintensification \n\nimproved \n\nThe  Project  will  improve  rural  livelihoods  through  strengthened \nIWRM, \nirrigation  service  delivery,  and  enhanced \nagricultural  practices  to  increase  the  productivity  of  irrigated \nagriculture  in  the  western  basins.  The  primary  project  impacts \ninclude  (i)  improved  IWRM  and  water  management,  (ii)  R&U  and \ndevelopment  of  irrigation  and  water  resources  infrastructure,  (iii) \nenhanced  support  for  improved  agricultural  productivity  and  rural \nlivelihoods,  and \n(iv)  developed  capacity  and  strengthened \ninstitutional frameworks for IWRM and irrigated agriculture. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $87.6  million  equivalent \nincluding  taxes  and  duties  at  $4.8  million  and  interest  during \nimplementation  at  $1.9  million.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is \nestimated  at  $34.3  million  and  the  local  currency  cost  at  $53.3 \nmillion equivalent. \n \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank Loan \nAsian Development Bank Grant \nProject Participantsa \nGovernmentb \nTotal \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n29.7 \n4.6 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n34.3 \n\n30.8 \n9.9 \n7.8 \n4.8 \n53.3 \n\nTotal \nCost \n60.5 \n14.5 \n7.8 \n4.8 \n87.6 \n\n($ million) \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\na  Contribution of communities for labor. \nb  Local taxes and duties. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nA  loan  of  $60.5  million  and  a  grant  of  $14.5  million  (total  $75.0 \nmillion  equivalent)  will  be  provided  from  the  Special  Funds \nresources  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  loan  will \nhave  a  40-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  10  years,  and \ninterest rate of 1%. \n\n \n\n\fThe ADB funding will finance $34.3 million of the foreign exchange \ncost and $40.7 million of the local currency cost. The community \nwill  fund  $7.8  million  equivalent  of  the  local  costs  through  in-kind \nlabor.  The  Government  is  not  required  to  directly  contribute  to  the \nproject  cost  but  will  provide  $4.8  million  for  taxes  and  duties.  The \nADB  ADF  grant  will  be  used  to  support  (i)  the  mirab  development \nand O&M subcomponent of the project, and (ii) the agricultural and \nlivelihood services component, which provide critical value addition \nto development impact and poverty reduction as part of the Project. \n \n30 September 2016 \n \n31 March 2013 \n\nfrom \n\ntechnical  officers \n\nto  provide  policy  guidance  and \n\n \nMinistry of Finance  \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The \nimplementing  agencies  will  be  MEW;  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Animal \nHusbandry,  and  Food;  and  Ministry  of  Mines  and  Industry.  Two \nproject committees will be formed: (i) a project steering committee in \nKabul,  co-chaired  by  either  the  minister  or  deputy  minister  of  MEW \nand  MOF, \nreview  project \nperformance; and (ii) a project implementation committee, chaired by \na  representative  from  the  governor\u2019s  office  in  Herat  and  comprising \nhigh-ranking \nline  agencies,  provincial \nauthorities,  project  consultants,  and  development  partners.  The \ncommittee  will  coordinate  project  implementation  and  technical \nissues.  MEW  will  establish  a  project  management  unit  (PMU)  in \nHerat  to  direct  all  project  activities  and  reporting.  The  PMU  will \ninclude  project  consultants  and  staff  of  MEW  and  the  ministries  of \nagriculture,  animal  husbandry,  and  food;  finance;  and  mines  and \nindustry. The PMU will be housed within the MEW office in Herat and \nwill serve as the base for project activities in the lower Hari Rud River \nBasin.  In  addition,  the  PMU  will  oversee  all  financial  management, \ncontracting,  reporting,  and  safeguard  issues.  A  project  office  with  a \ndeputy  project  director  will  be  opened  in  Obe,  Herat  Province,  for \nactivities in the upper Hari Rud River Basin and possibly in Badghis \nProvince for the Murghab Basin. The PMU will maintain an office in \nKabul  with  a  deputy  project  director  to  coordinate  project  activities \nwith MEW headquarters until such capacity exists within MEW. \n \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n \n\n\fProcurement \n\n \n\n \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\nvii\n\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \n\nProcurement  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  and  grant  proceeds  will \nbe \nfor  Procurement. \nInternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  will  be  used  for \nprocuring  civil  works  costing  over  $1  million;  local  competitive \nbidding (LCB) procedures for works estimated to cost $1 million or \nless; and direct purchase/single tender procedures may be allowed \nfor  civil  works  costing  $100,000  or  less.  LCB  civil  works  will  be \nprocured  from  prequalified  bidders  based  on  the  Government\u2019s \nexisting  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Subprojects  works \ninvolving  numerous  structures  or  activities  may  be  bundled  into \ncontract packages for procurement through ICB or LCB. Civil works \nless  than  $500,000  may  be  completed  through  in-kind  contribution \nfrom local communities. Vehicles, equipment, and materials will be \nprocured  under  ICB  procedures  where  the  estimated  cost  is  more \nthan $500,000, by international shopping where the estimated cost \nis  between  $300,000  and  $500,000;  and  through  LCB  procedures \nacceptable to ADB where the estimated cost is $300,000 equivalent \nor  less.  Small  or  off-the-shelf  goods  and  materials  valued  at  less \nthan  $100,000  may  be  procured  using  direct  purchase \narrangements. \n \nRetroactive approval procedures will be adopted for LCB civil works \ncontracts.  For  the  first  six  contract  packages  under  LCB  and \ninternational  shopping,  the  PMU  will  submit  the  procurement \ndocuments and bid evaluation for ADB review and approval before \nawarding  the  contract.  If  ADB  finds  the  documents  and  evaluation \nsatisfactory,  procurement  and  contract  award  for  subsequent \ncontract packages can take place without prior ADB approval. The \nPMU  will  retain  a  record  of  all  procurement  documentation, \nincluding  copies  of  the  signed  contract  and  the  bid  evaluation \nreport, for inspection during ADB project supervision missions or on \nrequest.  The  procurement  processes  and  contract  awards  will  be \naudited  annually  as  part  of  the  performance  audit.  If  any  contract \naward  is  found  unacceptable,  ADB  may  refuse  to  finance  the \ncontract. \n \nThe  Project  will  require  an  estimated  892  person-months  of \nconsulting services: 468 international and 424 domestic. This input \nreflects the support required to implement the Project as well as to \nprovide  necessary \ncapacity  development.  Nongovernment \norganizations  will  be  contracted  as  needed  to  support  project \nactivities  through  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Consultants  will \nbe  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nselecting  domestic  consultants.  Consulting  firms  will  be  recruited \nthrough full or simplified technical proposals using quality and cost-\nbased  selection  procedures.  To  the  extent  possible,  prequalified \nnongovernment  organizations  will  be  contracted  on  the  basis  of \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n\n \n\n\fviii \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nThe  project  benefits  include  (i)  improved  management  of  water \nresources  in  the  western  basins  for  sustainable  economic  growth; \n(ii) increased irrigated area for spring season wheat; (iii) increased \ncropping  intensity  for  second  season  horticulture;  (iv)  increased \nyields for wheat, fodder, and horticulture; (v) improved livelihoods to \nreduce  the  risk  of  poppy  cultivation;  (vi)  more  secure  irrigation \nsystems with reduced risk of structural failure; (vii) improved water \nresources  management  and  efficiency  at  all  levels;  and  (viii) \ncapacity  development  for  ministry  staff,  mirabs,  farmers,  and  other \nproject  stakeholders.  About  400,000  persons  (about  20%  of  the \nwestern  basins\u2019  population)  are  expected  to  benefit  from  Project; \nabout 80% of these are classified as poor or very poor. In addition, \nmany project participants will be landless sharecroppers. \n \nThe Project as a whole yields an economic internal rate of return of \n17%;  irrigation  subprojects  developed  during  project  preparation \nhad returns from 12% to 22%. For the average poor farmer whose \nlandholding  is  0.8  ha,  the  net  increase  in  annual  income  is \nestimated  to  be  $234  or  a  117%  rise  mainly  from  improved  wheat \nproduction.  For  many  families,  the  incremental  production  will  be \nconsumed  directly  and  thus  will  significantly  improve  household \nfood security and nutrition. \n \nSecurity. The overall political and security situation in Afghanistan \nremains not fully stable, although the majority of the western basins \nis  one  of  the  most  secure  areas  in  the  country.  The  Project  will \nrequire  vigilant  monitoring  and  close  coordination  with  the  United \nNations and local authorities to ensure project-related security. \n \nContracting of Civil Works. Due to the prolonged civil unrest and \nstagnation  of  construction  in  the  area,  concern  exists  that  local \ncontracting  capacity  will  not  be  adequate  to  execute  civil  works \nwithin the time frame, costs, and required standards for the Project. \nThe  Project  will  use  a  variety  of  contracting  and  procurement \nmethods  including  ICB  packages  to  attract  contractors

\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan, \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Western Basins Water \nResources Management Project (the Project). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nWater resources management and irrigated agriculture are fundamental to the well-being of \n2. \nthe  national  economy,  the  rural  sector,  and  poverty  reduction  in  Afghanistan.  Irrigated  agriculture \nproduces up to 80% of agricultural output with agriculture comprising between 50% and 60% of the \nnational  economy  and  employing  about  80%  of  the  population.  Farmers  throughout  the  country \nhave cited lack of irrigation water as the primary constraint to agricultural productivity, and deficit \nrainfall in 2004 caused the projected 16% annual growth in gross domestic product to be revised \ndownward  to  8%  and  resulted  in  2.5  million  Afghans  facing  food  insecurity.  Developing  water \nresources  and  improving  the  productivity  of  irrigated  agriculture  is  paramount  to  promoting \nAfghanistan\u2019s economic growth and addressing rural poverty(Appendix 2). Agriculture uses 95% of \ndeveloped water supplies, so enhancement of irrigated agriculture must be pursued in parallel with \nstrengthening water resources management.1 \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nThe Western Basins. Badghis, Ghowr, and Herat provinces comprise the western basins. \nWith the exception of Herat City, the districts in the western basins are nearly 100% rural with over \n2 million people. Up to 30% of rural households are landless, up to 80% consider themselves poor \nor  very  poor,  and  the  average  farm  size  is  less  than  1  hectare  (ha).  The  Hari  Rud  and  Murghab \nRivers are the largest in western Afghanistan; together their basins cover 78,000 square kilometers \n(12%  of  Afghanistan).  The  two  rivers  provide  3  billion  cubic  meters  of  annual  water  runoff,  split \nalmost equally between the two basins, and flow into Turkmenistan with the Hari Rud River Basin \nfirst  traveling  along  the  border  with  Iran.  The  Hari  Rud  River  Basin  is  far  more  developed  and \nincludes  Herat  City.  Runoff  comes  from  snowmelt  with  high  flood  flows  from  March  to  June  and \nvery low flows from August to February. For irrigation, discharge is excess in the spring and deficit \nin the summer. Farmers have adapted their irrigation and agricultural practices to this flood regime. \nThe  Hari  Rud  River  Basin  has  significant  groundwater  potential,  which  has  been  largely \nunexploited.  Installation  of  shallow  and  deep  wells  is  increasing  and  will  accelerate  as  incomes \nrise.  Although  the  use  of  groundwater  offers  tremendous  opportunity,  insufficient  information \ncurrently exists to quantify the impact of its development and to manage it. \n \n4. \nIrrigated  Agriculture.  The  Hari  Rud  River  Basin  contains  some  of  the  most  extensive \nirrigated  areas  in  Afghanistan.  Local  communities  developed  the  irrigation  systems  to  provide \nwater for irrigation, livestock, and domestic use over 500 years ago, and they have sophisticated \nwater  allocation  methods.  The  western  basins  have  about  300,000  ha  of  irrigated  area,  of  which \n170,000 ha are intensively irrigated with 110,000 ha (63% of intensive irrigation) found in the lower \nHari Rud River Basin.2 Most of the intermittently irrigated areas are located in the upper Hari Rud \nRiver  Basin  (62%).  Smaller  systems  are  scattered  in  the  upper  Hari  Rud  and  Murghab  River \nBasins. System size is mainly a function of water availability (accessibility and reliability) and land \nsuitability (soil type and topography).  \n                                                 \n1   The Project was prepared under TA 4420-AFG (Asian Development Bank. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Islamic \nRepublic  of  Afghanistan  for  Preparing  the  Western  Basins  Water  Resources  Management  and  Irrigated  Agriculture \nDevelopment Project. Manila) cofinanced by the Government of Canada. \n\n2  Statistics used for Afghanistan are uncertain. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n5. \nWheat  is  the  primary  crop  grown  in  irrigated  areas  and  is  taken  as  the  first  season  crop. \nFodder is the next most common crop, accounting for 10% of irrigated areas. In areas with secure \nwater  supply,  higher  value  second  season  or  perennial  crops  are  grown  including  rice,  orchards, \nvineyards,  and  vegetables.  In  rainfed  areas,  opportunistic  crops  of  winter  wheat  and  fodder  are \ngrown with little opportunity for anything else. Wheat yields are low in irrigated areas in the western \nbasins,  with  an  average  of  about  2  tons  per  ha  (t/ha),  and  even  lower  in  rainfed  areas.  The  low \nyields  are  related  to  insecurity  of  water  supply,  which  directly  limits  yields,  and  also  provides  a \ndisincentive  for  farmers  to  invest  in  inputs.  Currently,  very  little  poppy  is  grown  in  the  western \nbasins and improving productivity of irrigated agriculture and enhancing livelihood opportunities will \nensure poppy cultivation remains limited. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n\nMinistry  of  Energy  and  Water.  The  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Water\u2019s  (MEW\u2019s)  Irrigation \n6. \nDepartment is responsible for irrigation development and managing the country\u2019s water resources. \nGiven the past 30 years of civil unrest, the capacity of the MEW is limited, especially in provinces \nand  districts  where  few  trained  or  experienced  technical  staff  are  available.  As  of  mid-2005,  the \nIrrigation  Department  in  Herat  had  a  technical  staff  of  four  engineers,  all  with  limited  experience \nand  training.  The  department  lacks  trained  administrative  and  management  staff,  has  little \nequipment  such  as  computers  or  vehicles,  and  has  essentially  no  operational  capacity  outside \nHerat  in  the  western  basins.  Rehabilitation  and  upgrading  (R&U)  of  irrigation  systems  and \ndevelopment of water resources in the western basins have tremendous potential to stimulate the \nlocal economy and improve rural livelihoods, yet this requires signification additional capacity and \nsound management to ensure sustainability and maximum development impact. \n \nIrrigation Infrastructure. The irrigation systems of the western basins are in urgent need \n7. \nof  assistance,  with  entire  canal  networks  requiring  major  R&U  due  to decades  of civil  unrest  that \nhave  impeded  routine  maintenance  and  repair.  The  deterioration  of  system  infrastructure  is \nexacerbated  by  the  area\u2019s  flood  hydrology,  which  creates  a  constant  need  to  protect  and \nrehabilitate  canal  intakes,  canals,  and  adjacent  farmland  against  floods,  erosion,  and  sediment \ndeposition.  Because  of  the  traditional  nature  of  the  irrigation  systems,  few  modern  control \nstructures exist, and current water distribution is achieved through rudimentary diversion structures \nthat  are  often  temporary  and  makeshift  leading  to  inefficiencies.  These  irrigation  systems  can  be \nrationalized to operate much more efficiently and to increase the irrigated area. Canal intakes can \nbe  upgraded  for  greater  capture  of  low  season  flows  and  to  prevent  flood  damage  and  sediment \ndeposition.  As  a  result  of  unreliable  supply  of  water  and  the  degraded  condition  of  irrigation \nsystems, cropping intensity in the western basins was only 40% at the end of the severe drought \nfrom  1999  to  2001.  R&U  of  the  systems,  especially  the  intakes,  will  provide  more  reliable  water \nsupply,  increase  conveyance  efficiency,  and  improve  water  control  and  management,  thus \nincreasing  irrigation  intensity,  improving  yields  for  first  season  crops,  and  providing  more \nopportunities for second season and perennial crops. About 30 primary irrigation systems exist in \nthe lower Hari Rud River Basin with an average size of about 2,000 ha and many smaller schemes \nare found throughout the basin. \n \n8. \nTraditional Irrigation Management. Traditional irrigation systems (all surface irrigation in \nthe  western  basins  is  traditional)  comprise  over  80%  of  the  irrigated  area  in  Afghanistan  and \ncommunities continue to be responsible for management, and operation and maintenance (O&M). \nLocal communities select  mirabs3 who manage  the system, water distribution, and O&M with the \nsupport  of  community  labor.  Mirabs  may  serve  for  many  years  and  the  position  may  be  passed \nfrom generation to generation. A hierarchy usually exists with one senior mirab responsible for the \n                                                 \n3  Mirabs are community water managers responsible for traditional irrigation schemes. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\nentire irrigation system and other lower-level mirabs responsible for distributaries and minor canals. \nThe  role  of  the  mirab  may  require  full-time  service  for  a  large  portion  of  the  year,  with  mirabs \nusually receiving an in-kind fee from each year\u2019s harvest. The mirabs receive no formal assistance \nfrom  the  Government,  although  they  may  collaborate  with  the  Irrigation  Department  or  other \nauthorities  on  an  ad-hoc  basis  to  execute  O&M  or  other  rehabilitation  projects.  The financial  and \nother resources at their disposal are meager. O&M is provided by community labor with hundreds \nor  thousands  of  men  in  labor  gangs  undertaking  annual  irrigation  system  maintenance.  Although \nthis  management  system  has  worked  well  for  generations,  the  extremely  dilapidated  condition  of \nthe  irrigation  systems  necessitates  additional  resources  and  technical  support  to  the  mirabs  and \ncommunities  in  order  to  (i)  return  the  systems  to  good  operating  condition  to  ensure  that \ncommunities can sustain their performance, and (ii) enhance their performance for more productive \nirrigated agriculture. Women play no direct role in irrigated agriculture and have very limited control \nover water or other productive resources due to the conservative patriarchal society. Women are \ntraditionally  consigned  to  household  tasks  and  may  be  involved  with  home  gardens  or  livestock \nactivities. \n \n9. \nThe  mirabs  would  benefit  from  training  in  areas  of  basic  engineering  to  support  O&M, \nimproved  water  management,  and  introduction  of  more  efficient  irrigation  technologies  and \nmethods.  Strengthening  the  mirabs  by  improving  accountability  and  transparency,  developing \nbusiness and financial management capacity, and establishing their legal status will help them to \nmobilize  additional  resources  and  to  become  more  effective  in  their  tasks.  However,  the  mirabs \nhave provided robust irrigation management and O&M for centuries, and any proposed technical or \ninstitutional  changes  to  traditional  irrigation  systems  must  explicitly  recognize  and  accommodate \nthe mirab system to ensure success. \n \n10.  Water  Resources  Management.  The  policy  framework  for  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement  (IWRM)  and  irrigation  is  being  developed.  The  Strategic  Framework  for  the  Water \nSector  was  finalized  in  May  2004  and  approved  by  the  Cabinet;  it  is  consistent  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) water policy.4 In 2004, the Government also issued water resources and \nirrigation policies. The objective of the irrigation policy is to develop and manage irrigation systems \ncost-effectively;  ensure  technical,  social,  institutional,  and  environmental  sustainability;  and \npromote user participation in local water management to ensure an overall increase in production \nand productivity of agriculture. MEW is currently drafting a revised water law that will be approved \nin  2006.  Although  the  policy  framework  is  being  established  with  external  funding  support, \ndeveloping  implementation  arrangements  and  the  capacity,  especially  at  the  regional  level,  to \napply  the  policies  pose  a  challenge.  MEW  staff  currently  do  not  have  adequate  skills,  and  basic \nhydrological  data  has  not  been  collected  for  the  past  25  years.5  The  Irrigation  Department  has \ndynamic  leadership  and  is  committed  to  capacity  development  and  modern  water  management; \nhowever, establishing effective water management institutions requires a long-term commitment. \n \n11. \nRiver Basin Management. Developing optimum approaches to river basin management is \nimportant  to  maximize  investment  benefits  and  assess  equity  trade-offs.  Water  allocation  options \nneed  to  be  evaluated  and  agreements  reached  regarding  the  sharing  of  water  among  irrigation \nschemes  and  water  users.  MEW  has  committed  to  develop  river  basin  authorities  (RBAs)  to \nmanage  Afghanistan\u2019s  water  resources.  Adopting  a  river  basin  approach  is  essential  for  the  Hari \nRud  River  Basin  due  to  substantial  investments,  including  development  of  the  Salma  Dam  being \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB. 2001.

The RBA \ncan  provide  a  vehicle  to  develop  consensus  to  manage  water  allocation,  but  the  institutional \nframework and capacity need development. \n \n12. \nADB Framework and Rationale. ADB has provided strong support to irrigated agriculture \nand  water  resources  using  ADB\u2019s  three-pronged  approach  for  Afghanistan\u2019s  reconstruction:  build \ncapacity, establish an appropriate institutional framework, and rehabilitate essential infrastructure. \nADB\u2019s  Agriculture  Sector  Program7  loan  provides  the  policy  framework  to  manage  and  develop \nagriculture  and  natural  resources,  and  to  guide  ADB  sectoral  interventions.  The  Project  was \ndeveloped  within  and  supports  this  policy  framework.  ADB\u2019s  other  sector  interventions  include  (i) \nEmergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Project,8  (ii)  Balkh  River  Integrated \nWater Resources Management Project,9 (iii) component 1B.1 of the Technical Assistance (TA) for \nWater  Resources  Management  and  Planning,10  and  (iv)  the  forthcoming  advisory  TA  (December \n2005), Capacity Building for Water Resources Management (Appendix 3).11 \n \nLessons  Learned.  ADB,  European  Commission,  United  States  Agency  for  International \n13. \nDevelopment,  World  Bank,  and  other  development  partners  have  irrigation  and  water  resources \nprograms in Afghanistan that provide the following lessons: (i) MEW capacity is limited in both skills \nand  availability  of  personnel;  (ii)  contracting  procedures  and  the  contracting  industry  is \nunderdeveloped  in  parts  of  the  country;  (iii)  although  capacity  development  is  critical  to  ensure \nproject  sustainability,  ample  resources  are  required  in  the  short  term  to  ensure  project \nimplementation;  and  (iv)  continuous  dialogue  with  MEW  in  Kabul  is  necessary  to  ensure  project \ncoordination (Appendix 4). Experience in Afghanistan has demonstrated the importance of quickly \ndelivering  project  benefits,  while  the  preparation  of  more  complex  activities  ensues.  ADB\u2019s \nexperience with irrigation and water resources has demonstrated the importance of a participatory \napproach to project implementation. Given the strong tradition of community irrigation management \nin Afghanistan, lessons from ADB\u2019s Bali Irrigation Project12 demonstrate the importance of explicitly \nworking  within  and  strengthening  traditional  irrigation  management  when  introducing  any  project \nintervention. If this is not done, not only is project success jeopardized, but the traditional systems \nthemselves may be weakened, lowering overall sector performance. \n \n\n                                                 \n6 The Salma Dam is a multipurpose project financed by the Government of India to be built approximately 160 kilometers \n\neast of Herat City. \n\n7   ADB. 2004.

The primary project impacts include (i) improved \nIWRM  and  water  management,  (ii)  R&U  and  development  of  irrigation  and  water  resources \ninfrastructure,  (iii)  support  for  improved  agricultural  productivity  and  rural  livelihoods,  and  (iv) \nirrigated \ncapacity  development  and  strengthened \nagriculture.  The  Project  has  four  components:  (i)  IWRM,  (ii)  water  resources  and  irrigation \ndevelopment,  (iii)  agriculture  and  livelihood  services,  and  (iv)  capacity  development  and  project \nmanagement.  \n \nB. \n\nIWRM  and \n\nframeworks \n\ninstitutional \n\nOutputs \n\nfor \n\n1. \n\nIntegrated Water Resources Management  \n\nImproving  IWRM  in  the  Hari  Rud  River  Basin  is  critical  to  its  development  due  to  the \n15. \nimportance of water to basin livelihoods, deficiencies in data to support decision making, and lack \nof existing capacity for effective management. The IWRM component has three subcomponents: (i) \ntechnical investigations and studies, (ii) water allocation and planning, and (iii) IWRM institutional \nand capacity development.13 \n \n16. \nTechnical Investigations and Studies. Technical activities in support of IWRM and basin \nmanagement  will  include  (i)  surface  water  investigations,  (ii)  groundwater  investigations,  and  (iii) \nestablishment  of  basin  management  information  systems.  The  Project  will  review  ongoing  hydro-\nmeteorological programs to identify additional data requirements for improved basin management \nand  project  implementation.  It  will  develop  and  apply  methodologies  and  procedures  to  prepare \ninventories  of  surface  water  sources  and  their  catchments,  abstractions  from  the  Hari  Rud  River \nBasin, and irrigated areas to provide the basis for the basin simulation modeling. The Project will \nprovide  equipment  and  establish  monitoring  procedures  for  surface  water  quality  consistent  with \ninternational protocols and standards. \n \nThe  Project  will  establish  a  groundwater  exploration  and  monitoring  network  based  on  an \n17. \ninventory  of  existing  groundwater  wells,  springs,  and  karez;14  and  by  installing  monitoring  wells \nthroughout the Hari Rud River Basin. This will support development of an integrated groundwater \nand surface water model for assessing sustainable groundwater yields and conjunctive use and to \nmaintain  karez  and  spring  flows.  Alternative  irrigation  technologies  such  as  drip,  sprinkler,  and \nplastic piping will be installed on plots associated with monitoring wells and at commercial farms to \ndemonstrate water-efficient irrigation options. \n \nThe  Project  will  support  establishment  of  information  systems  to  manage  technical  and \n18. \nadministrative  data  for  management  of  basin  resources  (including  surface  and  groundwater). \nGeographic  information  system  activities  started  during  project  preparation  will  be  expanded  to \nintegrate basin information including (i) water resources infrastructure, (ii) surface and groundwater \ninformation,  (iii)  environmental  data,  and  (iv)  land-use  data.  This  will  support  watershed \n\n                                                 \n13  IWRM activities will be fully established within the Hari Rud River Basin. They will be initiated within the Murghab River \nBasin  to  the  degree  necessary.  Given  the  limited  development  and  lack  of  infrastructure,  the  need  for  formal  basin \nmanagement is less imperative in the Murghab River Basin. \n\n14  A karez is an indigenous water supply system that captures subsurface flow by tunneling horizontal shafts into the side \n\nof hills or mountains. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nmanagement and basin planning. The Project will develop communications mechanisms to support \nbasin management objectives. \n \n19.  Water  Allocation  Planning.  The  Project  will  undertake  water  allocation  planning  studies \nthat  will  incorporate  additional  data  and  assessments  as  they  become  available  through  the \nProject. Project specialists will work with MEW and other stakeholders to define options for water \nallocation. Outcomes from the studies will support both technical options to optimize water use and \ndefine  institutional  and  management  options  to  allocate  water.  The  Project  will  support \ndevelopment of basin master plans. \n \n20. \nIWRM Institutional and Capacity Development. Optimizing the use of Hari Rud water and \nfacilitating  agreements  among  basin  water  users  has  significant  productivity  and  equity \nimplications.  Within  1  year,  the  Project  will  help  MEW  establish  a  management  cell  in  Herat, \nsupported  by  a  basin  water  committee  (BWC)  with  representation  from  MEW,  MMI,  Ministry  of \nFinance  (MOF),  Ministry  of  Rural  Reconstruction  and  Development  (MRRD),  provincial  and \nmunicipal  authorities,  mirabs,  and  other  stakeholders  to  advise,  plan,  and  execute  the  technical \nand  institutional  functions  for  basin  management.  With  project  support,  MEW  will  evaluate \ninstitutional arrangements, supported by staffing, physical plant, and resources to develop an RBA. \nThe BWC will develop a system of surface water entitlements based on traditional allocations and \nregister  the  entitlements  by  the  end  of  the  Project.  The  Project  will  develop  a  groundwater \nregulatory  framework  consistent  with  Government  policy  by  the  end  of  the  Project  to  manage \nsustainable development of basin groundwater and to protect karez and spring water supplies. \n \n21. \nCapacity development and expertise for technical and institutional aspects of IWRM will be \nsupported to ensure that basin management can be sustained after the Project. MEW staff will be \ntrained  for  technical  and  planning  functions  to  serve  as  a  secretariat  to  the  BWC  and  eventual \nRBA. The IWRM component will include a public awareness subcomponent to (i) inform residents \nof  water  and  basin  issues,  (ii)  promote  efficient  water  resource  management  and  use,  and  (iii) \ncommunicate basin objectives to water users. \n \n\n2. \n\nWater Resources and Irrigation Development \n\n22. \nThe  Project  will  support  R&U  of  irrigation,  strengthening  of  irrigation  service  delivery  and \naccountability consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy (footnote 4), and development of water resources \nthrough four subcomponents: (i) irrigation R&U in the Hari Rud River Basin, (ii) irrigation R&U in the \nMurghab  Basin,  (iii)  water  resources  development,  and  (iv)  mirab  development  and  O&M.  The \nProject  will  ensure  that  traditional  allocations  and  distribution  methods  are  preserved  during  the \nR&U unless otherwise supported by the community. R&U and development of all subprojects will \nbe  fully  participatory  with  mirabs  and  the  community  involved  in  the  identification,  design, \nmanagement,  and  O&M  of  the  civil  works.  The  community  will  provide  in-kind  contribution  to \nsubprojects as well as agree to abstain from poppy cultivation and to sustain O&M. Women will be \nconsulted  and  confirm  the  positioning  and  design  of  nonirrigation  infrastructure  such  as  bridges. \nDue  to  Afghanistan\u2019s  limited  capacity,  evolving  policy  framework,  and  weak  investment  planning, \nan  ADB  sector  loan  is  not  possible.  However,  given  the  number  of  irrigation  schemes  requiring \nR&U in the western basins and the need for flexibility with project implementation in Afghanistan, a \nsector-like  approach  will  be  used  for  subproject  selection  based  on  criteria  with  an  indicative \ninvestment plan to be refined during the Project (Appendix 5). \n \n23. \nIrrigation  R&U  in  the  Hari  Rud  River  Basin.  The  subprojects  for  irrigation  schemes \nprepared  during  the  project  preparatory  TA  provide  a  representative  sample  of  the  Project\u2019s  R&U \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n7\n\nactivities.15 The following are indicative types of R&U interventions to be financed under the Project: \n(i) improved intakes for greater capture efficiency, (ii) rehabilitated and improved control structures, \n(iii) bifurcations and drop structures, (iv) siphons, (v) aqueducts, (vi) cross drainages, (vii) canal R&U \nand  rationalization,  (viii)  river  training  and  bank  protection,  (ix)  vehicle  and  pedestrian  bridges  and \nimproved access to canals for nonirrigation water needs, and (x) drainage. \n \n24. \nHistorically,  the  design  and  management  of  traditional  irrigation  systems  have  worked \nadequately; however, more efficient irrigation management control and water conveyance options \nexist.  The  Project  will  work  with  mirabs  and  communities  to  demonstrate  options  to  enhance \nsystem  performance  including  (i)  improved  intakes,  control  structures,  and  canal  profiles;  (ii) \nenhanced flexibility of irrigation deliveries to meet demand; and (iii) better distribution and rotation \nscheduling. The Project will demonstrate the benefits of improved operational options while training \nmirabs and communities, so they can adopt and benefit from new technologies and management \ntechniques.  However,  community  acceptance  is  necessary  before  any  technical  or  management \nchanges  will  be  undertaken  through  the  Project.  Long-term  capacity  development  will  also \nempower mirabs and communities to execute ongoing system improvements themselves. \n \nIn  year  1,  project  interventions  will  commence  with  detailed  design  and  contracting  of  the \n25. \nthree core subprojects prepared during the TA and will be expanded to other systems throughout \nthe  Hari  Rud  River  Basin.  During  years  1  to  3,  the  Project  will  survey  and  inventory  the  larger \nsystems in the Hari Rud River Basin to facilitate prescreening of subprojects for R&U as well as to \nprovide  data  for  the  surface  water  investigations  in  component  one.  Following  the  surveys  and \ncommunity consultations, final subproject selection will take place followed by detailed design and \nconstruction. An estimated 45,000 ha will receive R&U. \n \nIrrigation  R&U  in  the  Murghab  River  Basin.  By  year  2  of  the  Project,  a  detailed \n26. \ninvestigation  of  the  Murghab  River  Basin  will  be  initiated  to  prioritize  investment  options  and \ndevelop an implementation strategy. This investment plan will be finalized by year 5. The technical \ninterventions in the Murghab River Basin will be similar to the Hari Rud. The Murghab River Basin \nmay offer more opportunities to develop new irrigation and water resources infrastructure since it is \nless developed than the Hari Rud River Basin. An estimated 10,000 ha will receive R&U. \n \n27.  Water  Resources  Development.  A  number  of  possible  subprojects  were  identified  that \nhave  potentially  large  benefits  for  communities  such  as  new  irrigated  areas,  flood  control,  water \nsupply,  and  small  storage  works.  The  Project  will  provide  expertise  to  investigate  and  develop \nthese subprojects. An investment plan for subprojects under this subcomponent will be started in \nyear 2 and be completed by year 5. The Project will produce designs, contract packages, and work \nplans.  Emphasis  on  a  participatory  process  and  the  terms  of  community  participation  will  be  the \nsame under this subcomponent as with irrigation R&U.16 \n \n28.  Mirab  Development  and  O&M.  Strengthening  mirabs  and  communities  is  necessary  to \nimprove  irrigation  management  and  ensure  effective  and  sustainable  O&M.  However,  project \nactivities must not erode the effectiveness or legitimacy of the existing institutions. The Project will \npromote institutional strengthening with the following objectives: (i) increase capacity for O&M, (ii) \nprovide technically enhanced irrigation systems; (iii) improve agricultural productivity, (iv) increase \naccess to resources for system management and O&M (moving from an informal in-kind payment \nsystem to a fee-for-service approach), and (v) strengthen the legal status of mirabs. Although the \nmirabs  and  communities  already  serve  as  an  autonomous  irrigation  service  provider,  the  Project \n\n                                                 \n15  The three subprojects include rehabilitation of the Jui Nau Canal, and Sari Pul and Yahia Abad systems.  \n16  If viable subprojects cannot be identified, funds in this subcomponent will be used for additional irrigation R&U up to \n\n6,500 ha equivalent works. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nwill work to enhance the transparency, equity of water distribution, and accountability of irrigation \nservice  provision.  The  Project  will  establish  a  core  technical  training  program  and  assistance \npackage for the mirabs to accompany the physical rehabilitation; it will include training for (i) O&M \nand  minor  repairs,  (ii)  water  distribution  and  management,  (iii)  improved  structures  and  basic \nirrigation  system  design  principles,  (iv)  irrigation  and  crop  scheduling,  and  (v)  system  monitoring \nand evaluation (M&E). In addition to the core program, mirabs and communities that complete the \ntraining will receive equipment for minor O&M and improved mobility and communications. Support \nwill also be available for initial incremental O&M expenditures and to strengthen mirab institutions \nwhile they develop O&M and financial plans. \n \n29. \nThe  Project  will  support  development  and  adoption  of  a  stronger  institutional  and  legal \nframework  to  underpin  the  mirabs  based  on  traditional  practices.  The  process  will  be  gradual  and \nundertaken only with the consent of the mirabs and communities.17 Actions will strengthen individual \nsystem development, yet will seek to federate mirab institutions and include their formal participation \nin river basin management. The Project will support development of enabling policies and training as \nneeded and desired by mirabs and communities to address (i) election procedures, (ii) bylaws and \nrules  for  differing  mirab  levels  within  a  federated  structure,  (iii)  methodologies  for  defining  and \nmanaging irrigation service collections and payment, (iv) financial auditing, and (v) dispute resolution. \nExperience from international best practice with water user associations will help provide benchmarks \nand lessons for mirabs to adopt these more formalized procedures, as well as to ensure mirabs can \nprovide sustainable and accountable irrigation management. The Project will provide mirab training \nfor (i) financial management, (ii) business planning and marketing, and (iii) literacy. \n \n30. \nAfter  training,  the  Project  will  offer  on-demand  technical  and  institutional  development \nassistance  to  meet  individual  community  needs  since  capacity  development  and  institutional \ngrowth  are  long-term  activities.  These  services  will  help  farmers  with  O&M  problems  as  well  as \nencourage  new  technical  and  management  strategies  after  initial  R&U  and  basic  training.  The \nservice  will  provide  backstopping  as  mirabs  take  on  a  broader  and  more  intensive  scope  of \nactivities. The project approach is to be flexible and iterative. The primary objective is to ensure the \nmirabs and communities maintain governance and authority over system O&M and management, \nwhile  capacity,  institutions,  and  the  systems  improve.  Outputs  from  the  mirab  development  and \nO&M subcomponent will include a (i) mirab capacity development program; (ii) policies, rules, and \nregulations  to  help  strengthen  the  institutional  framework  for  mirabs;  and  (iii)  ongoing  technical \nsupport to assist the mirabs.18 \n \n\n3. \n\nAgriculture and Livelihood Services \n\nThe  agriculture  and  livelihood  services  component  will  (i)  assist  farmers  in  exploiting \n31. \nopportunities from a more reliable water supply, (ii) ensure that farmers have viable alternatives to \npoppy cultivation, and (iii) ensure equity in project benefits. The agriculture and livelihood services \ncomponent  has  three  subcomponents:  (i)  on-farm  water  management  (OFWM),  (ii)  enhanced \ncropping opportunities, and (iii) poverty and gender livelihood opportunities. In year 1, MAAHF, with \nproject support, will conduct a farm survey in the Hari Rud River Basin project area to analyze (i) \ncurrent  cropping  practices,  (ii)  yield  information,  (iii)  farm  budgets,  (iv)  irrigated  agriculture \npractices, (v) land tenure arrangements, (vi) on-farm irrigation practices, (vii) input and marketing \ninformation,  (viii)  women\u2019s  participation  in  rural  households,  and  (ix)  constraints  to  irrigated \nagriculture,  among  others.  This  information  will  be  essential  to  (i)  develop  the  OFWM  program \n\n                                                 \n17  The  National  Water  Law,  which  is  currently  being  revised,  provides  for  the  development  of  legally  established  water \nuser  associations.  Project  activities  will  be  consistent  with  national  policy;  however,  the  project  approach  will  be  to \nallow mirabs and communities to determine their institutional and financial arrangements.  \n\n18  Indirect outputs will include O&M plans, irrigation schedules, and financial management and business plans. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n9\n\nsubcomponent  and  options  for  system  scheduling,  (ii)  identify  promising  options  and  delivery \nmechanisms for the enhanced cropping opportunities subcomponent, (iii) provide accurate baseline \ninformation for project M&E, (iv) stimulate awareness and provide information to farmers about the \nProject, and (v) assess demand for irrigation water. \n \nOn-Farm  Water  Management.  The  OFWM  subcomponent  provides  the  link  in  water \n32. \nmanagement between the canal and field, and will provide the following: (i) improved conveyance \nand  application  within  the  farm  field;  (ii)  crop  water  requirements  and  the  application  implications \nunder a more reliable water supply; (iii) linkages to overall scheduling; (iv) options and technology \nto  enhance  demand  responsiveness  and  flexibility  of  irrigation;  and  (v)  orchard,  vineyard,  and \nvegetable water management. MAAHF has responsibility for OFWM and will lead implementation \nwith project support. Subcomponent activities will be closely integrated with the mirab development \nprogram  and  offered  to  farmers  in  subproject  areas.  The  Project  will  provide  (i)  mobilization, \ntraining, and resource materials; (ii) technical and management demonstration activities with land \nleveling, furrow strips, farm storage, and other activities; and (iii) extension and support services. \n \n33. \nEnhanced Cropping Opportunities. System rehabilitation and improved management will \nprovide  more  reliable  irrigation  supply  that  will  provide  opportunities  for  farmers  to  (i)  increase \nwheat yields and cropping intensity, (ii) take advantage of second season or perennial crops, and \n(iii) diversify into higher value cropping. The subcomponent will target horticulture crops including \nsecond  season  vegetables,  orchard  and  vineyard  production,  and  fodder  to  increase  livestock \nproduction which is vital to rural communities in the project area. Improved wheat production will be \ngiven emphasis since it is the most prevalent crop and will benefit the greatest number and poorest \nfarmers. The Project will provide information on input usage and other productive investments that \nfarmers may be more willing to make due to improved water supply, as well as provide training for \nmarketing and processing. The services will be offered to farmers, nurseries, and seed growers in \nsubproject  areas.  Activities  will  include  (i)  training  and  resources  materials,  (ii)  demonstration \nactivities,  (iii)  farmer  extension,  and  (iv)  community-developed  trial  proposals.  Subcomponent \nactivities will be coordinated with the OFWM activities and the mirab training to (i) help mirabs and \ncommunities  develop  improved  water  and  cropping  scheduling,  (ii)  improve  water  use  efficiency, \nand (iii) maximize crop productivity. \n \n34. \nLivelihood Opportunities for Women and the Landless. This subcomponent will provide \nopportunities for poor individuals who do not own land and for women in subproject areas, targeting \nhouseholds  headed  by  women.  The  Project  will  provide  assistance  for  rural  income-generating \nactivities.  MAAHF,  with  project  and  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  support,  will  develop  a \nmenu  of  options  for  delivery  to  communities.  Some  activities  already  have  a  history  and  proven \nsuccess  in  Afghanistan  and  include  (i)  mulberry  and  sericulture  (silkworm  raising),  (ii)  poultry \nproduction, and (iii) livestock assistance. The Project will provide (i) training, (ii) start-up materials, \nand (iii) extension and technical support services. \n \n\n4. \n\nCapacity Development and Project Management \n\n35. \nCapacity  Development.  Although  capacity  development  is  integral  for  all  project \ncomponents,  capacity  development  is  a  specific  subcomponent  to  ensure  it  is  appropriately \nresourced and managed in a coherent fashion. Capacity development activities will be provided for \n(i) MEW, MAAHF, and future RBA staff from the project area; (ii) select MEW staff from Kabul and \nother regions; (iii) trainers and NGOs that will deliver project services; (iv) mirabs; and (v) project \nparticipants. The capacity development subcomponent will provide the following: (i) formal training \nand educational courses of varying lengths in Afghanistan and abroad,19 (ii) on-the-job training, (iii) \n                                                 \n19  Up to 30 people are expected to be supported for international graduate training. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\ninstitutional  strengthening  and  policy  development,  and  (iv)  physical  resources  and  equipment  to \nenhance capability and effectiveness. Initial domestic training will be provided for MEW and project \nstaff to ensure adequate skill levels to take advantage of more advanced training. Initial training will \nalso serve as a screening opportunity to select more qualified candidates for international training. \nHerat  University  will  help  facilitate,  participate,  and  provide  some  of  the  capacity  development \nactivities.  Capacity  development  not  only  includes  training,  but  is  much  broader  to  include \ninstitutional  strengthening;  policy  development;  structuring  incentives;  and  helping  to  clarify  the \nlong-term  roles,  responsibilities,  and  authorities  of \nthe  mirabs,  MEW,  and  other  sector \nstakeholders.  The  Project  will  work  to  define  the  most  effective  irrigation  sector  institutional \narrangements  including  a  provisional  long-term  staffing  plan  for  MEW,  and  provide  capacity \ndevelopment  to  support  the  various  roles  for  sector  stakeholders.  As  capacity  is  developed, \nnational ministry staff will play a more active role in project activities. \n \nProject  Management.  This  subcomponent  will  support  the  establishment  of  a  project \n36. \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  that  will  be  staffed  with  ministry/project  professional  and  technical  staff, \ninternational and domestic consultants, supporting NGO staff, and administrative and support staff. \nThe PMU will be responsible for (i) direction and coordination of project activities; (ii) procurement, \naccounting,  and  financial  control;  (iii)  environment,  social  assessment,  and  resettlement;  and  (iv) \nM&E. The Project will include management and liaison staff in Kabul. \n \nC. \n\nAsian Development Fund IX Grant Component \n\n37. \nAfghanistan is a postconflict country where average per capita gross national income is less \nthan $1.00 a day. Providing grant assistance is essential to assist Afghanistan make the transition \nfrom postconflict to peace and stability. The Asian Development Fund (ADF) support for the ADB \ncontribution to the Project is a blend of $14.5 million grant and $60.5 million loan. The use of the \ngrant financing is vital to the redevelopment of irrigated agriculture and the national economy, and \nis  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  in  that  it  supports  natural  resource \nmanagement  and  relies  on  building  capacity,  establishing  appropriate  policy  and  institutional \nframeworks,  and  rehabilitating  essential  infrastructure.  The  Project  first  appeared  in  the  country \nstrategy  and  program  in  2003.  Specifically,  the  grant  will  be  used  to  support  the  agricultural  and \nlivelihood  services  component,  and  the  mirab  development  and  O&M  subcomponent,  which \nprovide critical value addition to development impact and poverty reduction as part of the Project. \nThe  grant  funds  will  be  managed  with  the  same  oversight  as  the  ADB  loan  funds,  and  separate \nM&E of grant funded activities will be undertaken. \n \nD. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n38. \nIntegrated Basin Approach. The Project takes an integrated approach. Components 1, 2, \nand 3, work together to improve water management from the basin to the farm by (i) creating an \nimproved knowledge base for optimal resource management, (ii) improving technical options and \ninfrastructure,  and  (iii)  strengthening  management  and  institutional  frameworks  at  all  levels.  The \nProject  addresses  management  of  surface  water,  groundwater,  and  water  quality  to  ensure \nsustainable  development.  The  integrated  approach  will  achieve  higher  agricultural  productivity, \nimproved water use efficiency and distribution equity, and sustainable water resource utilization.  \n \nCapacity Building and Effective Implementation. Capacity building is integral to achieve \n39. \nand  sustain  project  outcomes  and  is  essential  to  ensure  Afghanistan\u2019s  development.  The  Project \nexplicitly addresses capacity development with both formal and informal training, TA, and provision \nof  necessary  resources  for  project  stakeholders.  However  effective  capacity  development  of \ntechnical  skills  to  implement  the  Project  will  take  time,  and  given  that  project  activities  must \ncommence upon loan effectiveness to ensure that early benefits are realized, resources will initially \nneed  to  be  contracted  locally  and/or  regionally  to  support  technical  services  and  implementation. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n11\n\nThese  locally  or  regionally  procured  services  will  be  phased  out  as  capacity  develops  and  MEW \ncan assume a greater share of project responsibilities. \n \n40. \nAlternative  Livelihoods.  The  Project  provides  support  for  alternative  livelihoods  by \nproviding  TA  to  the  landless  and  women,  enabling  them  to  successfully  engage  in  income-\ngenerating activities. Although poppy is not currently cultivated in most of the project area, project \nactivities  will  provide  farmers  with  viable  livelihood  opportunities  to  ensure  they  do  not  become \ninvolved in poppy production in the future. \n \nSpecial  Terms.  Substantial  continued  aid  assistance  will  be  required  for  the  recurrent \n41. \nbudget  over  the  medium  term.  Recurrent  Government  expenditures  for  FY2005  amount  to  $609 \nmillion,  while  revenues  are  expected  to  amount  to  about  $256  million,  which  means  that  almost \n60%  of  recurrent  expenditures  will  have  to  be  financed  by  foreign  assistance.  The  capital  and \ndevelopment  budget  for  FY2005  of  $4,068  million  is  to  be  financed  entirely  by  external  funding \nagencies. A recent International Monetary Fund report expressed serious concern about the fiscal \nsustainability of the Government payroll and security expenditures, and highlighted the importance \nof  continued  assistance  from  external  funding  agencies.20  The  ADF  lending  terms  from  the  ADB \nBoard of Directors, while generous, are not sufficient for sustainable development of Afghanistan. \nThe Government requested more concessional funding for its transition and reconstruction phase. \nThis loan is proposed to be made on the following concessional terms: (i) grandfathering pre-1999 \nADF lending terms so that the loan has a 40-year maturity including a 10-year grace period, with a \n1% interest charge throughout this period, and (ii) capitalizing interest during the grace period.21 \n \nE. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nThe total project cost is estimated at $87.6 million equivalent inclusive of taxes, and duties \n42. \nat $4.8 million, and interest during implementation at $1.9 million (Table 1). The foreign exchange \ncost (including interest) is estimated at $34.3 million, and the local currency cost at $53.3 million \nequivalent (Appendix 6 and Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n\n($ million) \nForeign \nExchange \n\nItem \n\nTotal Cost \n\nSubtotal (Base Costs)a \n\n1.

Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan Afghanistan for the Postconflict \nMultisector Program. Manila). \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nF. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n43. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $60.5  million  and  a  grant  of  $14.5  million  (total \n$75.0 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the Project. The loan \nwill have a 40-year term, including a grace period  of 10 years, and an interest charge of 1% per \nannum.  The  total  amount  of  the  interest  charge  during  the  grace  period  will  be  capitalized  and \ncharged  to  the  loan  account.  The  ADB  loan  and  grant  will  finance  $34.3  million  of  the  foreign \nexchange costs and $40.7 million of the local currency costs (Table 2). The community will fund $7.8 \nmillion  equivalent  of  the  local  costs  through  in-kind  labor.  Under  ADB\u2019s  special  lending  terms,  the \nGovernment is exempt from directly contributing to the project financing exclusive of local taxes and \nduties, which will be paid by the Government.22 The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n29.7 \n4.6 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n34.3 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n30.8 \n9.9 \n7.8 \n4.8 \n53.3 \n\nTotal \nCost \n60.5 \n14.5 \n7.8 \n4.8 \n87.6 \n\n \nPercent \n69 \n17 \n  9 \n  5 \n100 \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank Loan \nAsian Development Bank Grant \nProject Participantsa \nGovernmentb \n \na  Contribution of communities for labor. \nb  Local taxes and duties. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTotal \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n44. \nExecuting Agency. The MOF will be the Executing Agency for the Project. MEW (Irrigation \nDepartment), MAAHF, and MMI are the implementing agencies. MEW (Irrigation Department) will \nbe  responsible  for  irrigation  and  water  resources  management  and  development.  MAAHF  will  be \ninvolved  in  the  delivery  of  the  agricultural  support  services.  MMI  will  collaborate  with  MEW  in \ncarrying  out  groundwater  activities.  MEW,  MAAHF,  and  MMI  have  few  staff,  most  with  limited \ncapacity and their ability to support the Project is minimal. However, the Project will require about \n75 technical and professional staff. Both MEW and MAAHF have agreed to work with ADB and the \nproject  consultants  to  identify  and  depute  professional  and  technical  staff  to  not  only  support  the \nProject,  but  to  establish  and  sustain  the  Irrigation  Department  and  the  RBA  after  project \ncompletion.  If  staff  cannot  be  identified  and  deputed,  they  will  be  recruited  and  hired  under  the \nProject and by year 3 of the Project, MEW and MAAHF have agreed to sanction the posts and take \nthe staff on as permanent employees. The Project will train the staff for assignment to MEW and \nRBA staff positions in Herat or locations determined by the Government after project completion. \n \n45.  MEW will establish a PMU within 3 months of effectiveness in Herat with representation from \nMAAHA,  MEW,  MMI, MOF, and the project consultants.23 The PMU will be housed within  MEW in \n\n                                                 \n22  Cofinancing  is  currently  being  pursued  with  the  Government  of  Canada  for  a  $15  million  grant  and  with  the  Islamic \nDevelopment  Bank  for  a  $10  million  interest  free  loan.  Once  this  or  other  cofinancing  is  confirmed,  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds loan resources will be canceled and an equal amount substituted with cofinancing funds. The Government has \nbeen consulted and confirmed this arrangement. \n\n23  By project completion, the PMU will have been mainstreamed, and the Project will have established capacity and an \norganizational structure within the Irrigation Department in Herat to effectively execute its long-term role in the sector, \nwhich will be better defined through the Project.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n13\n\nHerat, which will also serve as the base for project activities in the lower Hari Rud River Basin. By \nyear 1, the PMU will establish (i) a project office in Obe, Herat Province, for project activities and civil \nworks in the upper  Hari Rud  River Basin,24 and (ii) a project office in Kabul to coordinate activities \nwith  MOF  and  MEW  until  MEW  has  sufficient  capacity  to  do  this.  MEW  will  appoint  a  dedicated \nproject director in Herat within 3 months of effectiveness as well as deputy project directors in Obe \nand  Kabul  within  3  months  of  the  opening  of  those  offices.25  The  project  director  will  report  to  the \nMEW deputy minister. The PMU will provide overall interagency coordination for project activities and \nwill be responsible for consultants/NGO recruitment, procurement, financial management, reporting, \nsafeguard compliance with ADB policies, and M&E. Apart from the project director and two deputy \nproject directors, the Project is expected to have about 30 professional staff, 43 technical staff, and \n54 support staff unless otherwise agreed by ADB and the project steering committee. \n \n46. \nProject  Committees.  A  project  steering  committee  (PSC),  co-chaired  by  the  minister  or \ndeputy minister of MEW and MOF with deputy ministerial representation from MAAHF, the Ministry \nof  Foreign  Affairs,  MMI,  MRRD,  and  other  relevant  ministries,  will  be  formed  and  meet  at  least \nyearly or more frequently at the request of the chair to provide policy guidance and review project \nperformance.  A  project  implementation  committee  (PIC)  chaired  by  a  representative  of  the \ngovernor\u2019s office in Herat and comprising high-ranking technical officers from MEW, MAAHF, MMI, \nMOF, MRRD, Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs, other provincial authorities (including representatives of \nthe  governors\u2019  offices  of  Bhadghis  and  Ghowr  once  subprojects  are  located  there),  project \nconsultants,  and  development  partners  will  be  formed  within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness  to \ncoordinate project implementation and technical issues. The PIC will be based in Herat. The PIC \nwill have the project director as its secretary and will meet at least bimonthly or at the request of \nthe secretariat or chair. The PIC will have overall responsibility for resettlement, although the PMU \nwill  manage  the  day-to-day  activities  and  development  and  implementation  of  any  resettlement \nplans. The PIC will have responsibility for subproject selection from potential subprojects that meet \nthe selection criteria. Evaluation of candidate subprojects will be supported by the PMU. ADB will \nreview and approve selection of the first five subprojects, and if satisfactory to ADB, prior approval \nby ADB will not be required except for subprojects expected to cost more than $3 million. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n47. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  7  years  (2006/2013).  The  first  year  will  be  largely \ndevoted  to  start-up  activities,  including  staffing  the  PMU,  procurement  of  goods  and  services \n(consultants,  office  facilities,  office  equipment,  etc),  and  various  other  preparatory  tasks. \nConstruction  of  subprojects  prepared  under  the  TA  will  be  initiated  in  year  1,  while  other \nsubprojects will be prepared in years 1 to 3 with construction commencing immediately thereafter. \nExperience from these early subprojects will serve as a basis to refine procedures and processes \nfor executing subsequent subprojects (Appendix 7). \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n48. \nProcurement  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  costing  over  $1  million  will  be \nprocured under international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Civil works packages estimated \nto  cost  less  than  $1  million  will  be  procured  from  among  prequalified  bidders  under  local \ncompetitive bidding (LCB) based on the Government\u2019s existing procedures for prequalification and \naward  of  contracts  acceptable  to  ADB.  Rehabilitation  works  involving  numerous  structures  or \n\n                                                 \n24  The Project will support construction of MEW office facilities in Obe and Herat. A project office may also be opened in \n\nBadghis Province for the Murghab Basin. \n\n25  Qualifications of the project director and the deputies will be acceptable to ADB. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nactivities  on  subprojects  may  be  bundled  into  contract  packages  for  procurement  either  through \nICB or LCB. Civil works less than $500,000 may be done through community in-kind contribution to \nsubprojects to be coordinated through the PMU and MEW. Vehicles, equipment, and materials will \nbe  procured  under  ICB  procedures  where  the  estimated  cost  is  more  than  $500,000,  by \ninternational shopping where the estimated cost is between $300,000 and $500,000, and through \nLCB  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  where  the  estimated  cost  is  $300,000  equivalent  or  less. \nContractors will be encouraged to hire local laborers from subproject areas. Small or off-the-shelf \ngoods  and  materials  and  civil  works  valued  at  less  than  $100,000  may  be  procured  using  direct \npurchase arrangements (Appendix 8). \n \n49. \nTo  support  timely  contract  approvals  while  ensuring  sound  practice  and  accountability, \nretroactive approval procedures will be adopted for LCB civil works contracts following award of the \ninitial  three  contracts.  For  the  first  three  contract  packages  under  LCB,  the  PMU  will  submit  the \nprocurement  documents  and  bid  evaluation  for  ADB  review  and  approval  before  awarding  the \ncontracts. If ADB finds the documents and evaluation satisfactory, procurement and contract award \nfor subsequent contract packages can take place in the absence of prior ADB approval. MEW and \nthe  PMU  will  retain  a  record  of  all  procurement  documentation,  including  copies  of  the  signed \ncontract  and  the  bid  evaluation  report,  for  inspection  during  subsequent  ADB  project  supervision \nmissions or on request. The procurement processes and contract awards will be audited annually \nas part of the performance audit. If any contract award is found unacceptable, ADB may refuse to \nfinance the contract. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting and Nongovernment Organization Services \n\n50. \nTo  ensure  successful  implementation,  consulting  services  are  required  in  all  areas  of \nexpertise  related  to  the  Project.  The  high  input  of  consulting  services  is  considered  necessary  in \nview of the minimal capacity and expertise currently available within MEW, MAAHF, and MMI. The \nProject will require an estimated 892 person-months of consulting services: 468 international and \n424  domestic  (Appendix  9  and  Supplementary  Appendix  B).  This  input  reflects  the  support \nnecessary  for  capacity  development  as  well  as  to  implement  the  Project.  Consultants  will  be \nselected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.    NGO  services  are \nneeded  to  support  project  activities  related  to  agriculture  and  livelihood  services,  mirab \ndevelopment,  and  other  activities  necessary  for  implementation  of  the  Project.  To  the  extent \npossible,  prequalified  NGOs  will  be  contracted  on  the  basis  of  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nWhere  the  number  of  qualified  NGOs  is  limited,  direct  negotiation  may  be  applied  with  the  prior \napproval  of  ADB.  Provision  of  the  capacity-building  package  will  be  contracted  to  a  prequalified \nfirm,  institution,  or  university.  Consulting  firms  will  be  recruited  through  full  or  simplified  technical \nproposals, as appropriate, using quality- and cost-based selection procedures. \n \n \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with MOF. Consistent with its \n51. \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to \ninvestigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the \nProject.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  will  include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of MOF and \nall contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. All \nexternal costs related to the audits and investigations will be borne by the Project. \n \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n5. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n52. \nLoan  and  grant  disbursements  and  maintenance  of  an  imprest  account  will  be  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook  (January 2001), as amended from time to \ntime and detailed arrangements agreed upon between ADB and the Government. MOF will open \nand maintain the imprest account in the Da Afghanistan Bank. The initial amount to be deposited \ninto  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  6  months  expenditures  or  10%  of  the \nproject loan and grant amount, whichever is lower. For individual payments not exceeding $50,000, \nMOF will adopt the statement of expenditure procedure for claiming reimbursement and liquidating \nadvances  provided  into  the  imprest  account.  Direct  payment  procedures  may  be  used  for  large \nturnkey contracts and consulting services. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n53.  MOF, MEW, and the PMU will maintain separate records and accounts in accordance with \ngenerally  accepted  accounting  principles,  consistently  applied,  and  adequate  to  identify  (i)  goods \nand  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  (ii)  expenditures  incurred  for  the  Project  and \nsubprojects, (iii) use of ADF grant funds, and (iv) any Government expenditures. The account and \nrelated financial statements will be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards \nby  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  PMU  will  submit  to  ADB,  through  MOF, \nconsolidated  annual  audited  reports  and  related  financial  statements  from  the  Project  within  6 \nmonths  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year.  The  audit  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of \nexpenditures will be carried out as part of the regular annual audit. The auditor\u2019s assessment of the \nexamination  relating  to  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditures  should  be  separately \nset out in the auditor\u2019s report. In addition, ADB may conduct spot audits and random checks on the \nflow  of  funds  and  their  use  at  any  time  during  project  implementation  and  the  Government  has \npledged its cooperation in these efforts. For sound financial management, the Project includes 14 \nperson-months for an international financial management specialist and 36 person-months for an \ninternational  procurement  specialist.  The  Project  will  train  a  local  procurement  officer,  financial \ncontroller, and four accountants who will be stationed in the PMU. \n \n54.  MEW and the PMU will prepare monthly financial statements and quarterly progress reports \nthat detail the (i) physical and financial progress of activities against the targets, (ii) progress on the \ninstitutional and capacity aspects, (iii) issues affecting project implementation and their corrective \nmeasures,  and  (iv)  other  agreed  upon  monitoring  parameters.  MEW  and  the  PMU  will  prepare  a \ncomprehensive annual report and submit all reports to ADB through MOF not later than 2 months \nafter the reporting period. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the Government \nwill  submit  a  comprehensive  project  completion  report  in  ADB\u2019s  standard  format  with  additional \ndetails as may be requested by ADB. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n55.  Within  4  months  of  loan  and  grant  effectiveness,  MEW  and  the  PMU  will  establish \nperformance  M&E  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  M&E  parameters  will  be  developed  as  a \npart of the project administration memorandum with assistance from ADB. The M&E system will be \ndeveloped  in  accordance  with  ADB's  project  performance  management  system.  Baseline \ninformation  will  be  collected  as  part  of  the  subproject  feasibility  assessment  process.  Thereafter, \nsurveys  will  be  conducted  regularly.  The  scope  of  the  survey,  quantity  and  quality  of  data,  and \nfrequency of collection will be guided by project management needs for progressive feedback on \nimplementation  status  and  early  warning  on  situations  that  might  jeopardize  development \nobjectives.  Subproject  monitoring  will  be  conducted  by  the  PMU,  MEW,  mirabs,  and  others  as \nneeded, and will be reviewed closely by ADB. \n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n56. \nDuring  the  initial  3  years  of  the  Project,  ADB  will  carry  out  at  least  semiannual  reviews  to  (i) \ndetermine  if  implementation  arrangements  are  in  place  and  appropriate,  (ii)  assess  progress  in \ncapacity  development,  (iii)  review  subproject  selection  and  implementation,  (iv)  ensure  ADB \nsafeguards,  and  (v)  assess  any  unforeseen  impacts.  By  December  2009,  ADB  and  the \nGovernment  will  undertake  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  to  identify  any  problems  in \nimplementation arrangements and define needed changes to achieve the project objectives. Two \nmonths  before  the  midterm  review,  the  PMU  will  submit  a  detailed  progress  report  on  project \nimplementation  to  ADB.  Terms  of  reference  for  the  review  will  be  included  in  the  project \nadministration memorandum to be prepared during ADB\u2019s inception mission for the Project. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits  \n\n57. \nEconomic  and  Financial  Benefits.  The  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  will  result  from \nthe  irrigation  system  R&U  investments  to  improve  yields,  expand  irrigated  areas,  and  increase \ncropping intensity. The economic returns are based on the analysis of 3 irrigation R&U subprojects \nprepared  under  the  TA.  The  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the  irrigation  diversion \nschemes analyzed over 20 years are 12%, 20%, and 22% when all project management costs are \nincluded.26 The benefits for the irrigation schemes are based purely on productivity increases and \ndo not include benefits of improved mobility and market access from bridges and flood protection \nof canals.27 The assumed benefits from the irrigation R&U and agricultural support services include \nan increase in wheat yields of about 40% from low baseline yields of 2.0 t/ha to about 2.8 t/ha.28 \nThe  area  of  horticultural  activities  increased  from  a  low  base  of  about  5%  cropping  intensity  to \nabout  20%  cropping  intensity  with  yield  increases  of  around  20%.  Based  on  the  subprojects \nprepared, the assumed cost was about $650/ha for the R&U works, agricultural support services, \nand mirab development assistance. The Project will complete R&U of about 45,000 ha in the Hari \nRud River Basin, 10,000 ha in the Murghab Basin, and an additional 6,500 ha equivalent in water \nresources development. The EIRR of the overall Project is 17%.29 \n \n58. \nHousehold  budgets  were  prepared  for  various  incomes  groups  for  the  subprojects.  In  the \nJui Nau Canal subproject, the smallest farmers (assumed 0.8 ha landholding) realized an increase \nin  net  income  of  $234  or  a  117%  rise  in  household  earnings.  In  many  cases,  much  of  the  net \nincrease  will  be  consumed,  thus  improving  food  security  and  nutrition  (Appendix  10).  The \nincremental recurrent costs for O&M are estimated to be about $2.6/ha per year. This represents \nabout  a  25%  increase  in  the  current  community  O&M  contribution.  Even  for  poor  farmers,  this \namount lies well within their ability to pay to ensure financial sustainability and cost recovery. Given \nthe average family size of seven and average landholding (or area farmed by sharecroppers) at 1 \n\n                                                 \n26  Some flood protection interventions  were investigated during  the TA but failed to exhibit economically viable returns. \nFlood protection benefits must be based on properly derived probabilities and damage functions; this being the case, \neconomically attractive flood control subprojects may exist in the western basins and must be evaluated on a case-by-\ncase basis during project implementation. \n\n27 The irrigation R&U activities will have an element of flood control works, which will yield substantial benefits. In most \nsystems,  main  canals  are  threatened  due  to  flooding  at  the  intake,  cross  drainage,  or  rivers,  and  if  this  occurs  at  a \ncritical structure, a substantial portion of the downstream crops could be lost for the season. The project analysis does \nnot quantify these benefits or include them into the economic or financial analysis. \n\n28 Irrigated wheat yields in Afghanistan range from 1.5 t/ha to 3.5 t/ha and higher in areas with good water supply. The \n\nnational average in 2003 was about 2.9 t/ha. \n\n29  The  analysis  does  not  include  pure  capacity-building  activities,  but  does  include  all  of  the  IWRM  activity  costs  in \n\ncomponent 1, which do not yield quantified benefits.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n17\n\nha or less, at least 400,000 people will directly benefit from the Project or about 20% of the western \nbasin\u2019s population. \n \nB. \n\nSocial and Other Benefits and Impacts \n\nSocial Impacts. In the districts where project preparation took place, approximately 54% of \n59. \nthe population classed themselves as very poor, 30% as poor, 16% as well-off, and none as rich. \nGiven that average landholdings are less than 1 ha and up to 30% of the population is landless and \nmany  sharecrop,  the  Project  will  have  a  large  impact  on  reducing  poverty  and  improving  food \nsecurity.  For  some  farmers,  the  Project  will  provide  increased  opportunities  for  perennial  crops, \nsecond  season  vegetables,  and  rice  cultivation  with  substantial  income  impacts.  The  shift  from \ngrain production to higher value cropping will be consistent with expected changes in food demand \nand  consumption.  The  improvement  and  change  in  production  will  be  achieved  through  the \nirrigation R&U, and through increasing the capacity of farmers, which will allow them to make better \nproduction  decisions  as  irrigated  agriculture  continues  to  develop  and  intensify  in  the  western \nbasins.  Marginalized  members  of  society  will  benefit  through  labor  opportunities  provided  by \nsecond  season  cropping;  and  the  income-generating  opportunities  in  component  3  are  targeted \nspecifically at the women and the landless.  \n \n60. \nIWRM  and  Improved  Water  Use  Efficiency.  The  Project  will  support  (i)  increased  water \nuse  efficiency  in  terms  of  productivity  and  returns  per  unit  volume  of  water,  (ii)  development  of \nimproved intakes and capture efficiency for improved water supply, and (iii) greater efficiency and \nequity  of  water  distribution  within  irrigation  systems.  Physical  improvements  to  the  irrigation \nsystems  will  be  augmented  by  institutional  strengthening  through  the  RBA  at  the  basin  level  and \nthrough  stronger  mirabs  and  MEW  for  better  management  and  O&M  at  the  system  level.  Even \nthough the Project does not quantify financial or economic benefits from the IWRM component, it \nwill  provide  long-term  benefits  from  equitably  and  efficiently  managing  and  allocating  surface \nwater.  Sustainable  groundwater  management  will  be  especially  important  as  pumped  water  use \nwill  continue  to  grow,  and  water  quality  concerns  will  increase  with  population  and  economic \ngrowth. In an arid environment where water is essential to livelihoods, the IWRM activities will be \nabsolutely essential to maintain and sustain regional economic growth. \n \n61. \nResettlement.  Project  interventions  will  primarily  consist  of  R&U  of  traditional  irrigation \nsystems and small water resources development subprojects. Although a resettlement framework \nwas developed, the subprojects prepared during the TA did not indicate that resettlement activities \nwould be necessary. The most likely resettlement actions will be temporary compensation during \nconstruction;  however,  mirabs  and  communities  will  be  consulted  extensively  during  subproject \npreparation to develop a construction plan that minimizes disruptions. The majority of construction \nactivities  will  be  executed  when  the  irrigation  systems  are  not  in  use.  A  resettlement  framework \nwas  prepared  and  in  the  event  of  resettlement  impacts,  resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  in \naccordance  with  the  resettlement  framework.  Procedures  and  consultant  support  to  develop \nresettlement  plans  are  provided  through  the  Project  and  will  be  in  place  8  months  after  loan \neffectiveness. Any necessary resettlement activities will include external monitoring (Appendix 11, \nand Supplementary Appendix C). \n \nEnvironmental Impacts. Environmental impacts from the Project are not anticipated to be \n62. \nsignificant  and  should  not  impact  downstream  users.  The  TA  prepared  an  initial  environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  for  each  of  the  three  subprojects  and  for  the  entire  Project  (Appendix  12  and \nSupplementary  Appendix  D).  The  IEE  for  the  subprojects  did  not  predict  impacts  of  significance \neither during R&U or after subproject completion. The IEE for the entire Project concluded that all \nthe  components  should  provide  environmental  benefits  in  the  medium-  to  long-term  except  for \nR&U,  which  is  not  anticipated  to  create  any  negative  impacts.  The  IEE  for  the  Jui  Nau  canal \nsubproject, along with the environmental assessment review procedures, provide an environmental \nframework to guide the PMU and the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), which will \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nsupport  environmental  activities  through  the  Project.  An  IEE  will  be  carried  out  for  all  new \nsubprojects and mitigating measures implemented if needed. An environmental monitoring plan will \nbe  prepared  for  each  subproject,  with  the  participation  of  MEW,  PMU,  NEPA,  mirabs,  and  the \ncommunity.  The  Project  has  a  budget  dedicated  to  support  development  of  environmental \nmonitoring  plans  and  will  provide  consultant  support  to  (i)  develop  capacity  for  the  NEPA,  MEW, \nand  mirabs;  and  (ii)  prepare  IEEs  and  environmental  monitoring  plans  (Supplementary  Appendix \nE). \n \n63. \nCapacity  Development.  Although  no  quantified  economic  benefits  or  costs  are  attributed \nto capacity development, it will have a significant impact in terms of sustainability of project benefits \nand  the  redevelopment  of  irrigated  agriculture  in  Afghanistan.  MEW  staff  trained  locally  and \ninternationally are expected to continue the R&U activities as well as contribute to development of \nnew  irrigation.  Mirabs,  ministry  staff,  and  farmers  trained  under  the  Project  will  provide  a \npermanent resource to foster agricultural and economic growth in the western basins. Professional \nand technical MEW staff having been trained, and gaining experience under the Project, will also \nserve as a core of institutional expertise benefiting water resource development and management \nactivities throughout Afghanistan in the years to come. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\n64. \nSecurity.  The  overall  political  and  security  situation  remains  unsettled  in  Afghanistan \nalthough the western region is one of the most secure areas in the country. Careful monitoring and \ncoordination  with  Government  authorities  and  the  United  Nations  will  be  needed.  ADB\u2019s  ongoing \nSecurity of ADB Financed Projects TA30 will provide advice to ensure a safe work environment for \non-site personnel. Under the prevailing conditions, however, the security risks cannot be mitigated \ncompletely,  and  minor  delays  in  project  implementation  may  be  inevitable  despite  risk-mitigating \nmeasures should security problems arise. \n \n65. \nContracting  of  Civil  Works.  Due  to  the  long  period  of  civil  unrest  and  stagnation  of \nconstruction in the project area, a risk exists that the capacity of local contractors is inadequate to \nimplement the project civil works within the time frame and costs and to required quality standards. \nThe Project will use a variety of contracting methods including ICB for large contract packages to \nensure international or regional contractors with experience are able to complete a large number of \nworks in a timely manner and ensuring quality. The larger international contractor will subcontract \nportions of the work to local contractors thus developing their capacity through project experience. \nThe  Project  will  also  use  local  contractors,  selected  through  LCB,  and  employing  the  following \nsafeguards:  (i)  training  for  contractors  on  best  practice  and  ADB  procedures;  (ii)  strict \nprequalification criteria with a test period; and (iii) contracts with penalties for late performance that \nwill  be  enforced.  Local  contracting  capacity  is  expected  to  become  sufficient  as  the  Project \ndevelops. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  The  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n66. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe  PMU  will  be  established  by  the  Government,  and  appointment  of  the  project \ndirector in Herat within 3 months of loan and grant effectiveness. Within 1 year of loan \nand  grant  effectiveness,  the  PMU  shall  establish  (i)  a  project  office  in  Obe,  Herat \n\n                                                 \n30  ADB.  2004.

Deputy  directors  in  Obe  and \nKabul will be appointed within 3 months of the opening of those offices. \nWithin  1  year  of  loan  and  grant  effectiveness,  MEW  will  set  up  a  cell  supported  by  a \nBWC  comprising  representatives  from  MEW,  MOF,  MMI,  MAAHF,  MRRD,  provincial \nand municipal authorities, mirabs and other stakeholders to plan and execute technical \nfunctions associated with the IWRM component. \n\n(iii)  Within  6  years  of  loan  and  grant  effectiveness,  MEW  will  establish  and  develop  the \nRBA,  funded  with  an  adequate  flow  of  resources  to  support  its  sustainability  in \nperpetuity. Within 5 years of loan and grant effectiveness, MEW with PMU support will \ncomplete a study and propose a funding mechanism to support the RBA based on cost \nrecovery from all Hari Rud River Basin water users. \nThe  Government  will  form  a  project  steering  committee  (PSC),  co-chaired  by  the \nminister  or  deputy  minister  of  MEW  and  MOF  with  deputy  ministerial  representation \nfrom MAAHF, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, MMI, MRRD, and other relevant ministries \nthat will meet at least yearly or more frequently at the request of the chair to provide \npolicy guidance and review project performance. \n\n(iv) \n\n(vi) \n\n(v)  Within  3  months  of  loan  and  grant effectiveness,  a  project implementation  committee \n(PIC) chaired by a representative of the governor\u2019s office in Herat and comprising high-\nranking technical officers from MEW, MAAHF, MMI, MOF, MRRD, Ministry of Women\u2019s \nAffairs, other provincial authorities (including representatives of the governors\u2019 offices \nof  Bhadgis  and  Ghowr  once  subprojects  are  located  there),  project  consultants,  and \ndevelopment  partners  will  be  formed  to  coordinate  project  implementation  and \ntechnical issues. \nThe Government will depute staff to the Project in accordance with levels and positions \nagreed  with  ADB  and  the  PSC.  If  staff  cannot  be  deputed,  local  staff  will  be  hired \nthrough the Project who will become MEW, and MAAHF staff under posts sanctioned \nby  the  Government  by  year  3  of  the  Project.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  staff \nhired  for  the  Project  and  who  receive  international  training  through  the  Project  will \nremain  through  the  Project\u2019s  duration  and  remain  with  MEW,  and  MAAHF  for  an \nadequate period of time to ensure the sustainability of project benefits. \nThe Government will ensure that all subprojects meet, to the satisfaction of ADB, the \nagreed  selection  criteria  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  that  all  subprojects \nare properly monitored to the satisfaction of ADB. \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  The Government will ensure that, to the extent possible, subprojects will not entail any \nland  acquisition  and/or  involuntary  resettlement.  In  the  event  land  acquisition  and/or \ninvoluntary  resettlement  are  unavoidable  for  any  subproject,  then  the  Government  will \nensure  that  a  resettlement  plan  is  prepared  in  accordance  with  (a)  the  Government\u2019s \napplicable laws and regulations; (b) ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), as \namended from time to time; and (c) the agreed resettlement framework; and is based on \ndetailed  design.  The  resettlement  plans  will  be  disclosed  to  those  affected  and  project \nreporting will provide information on resettlement activities. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  adequate  environmental  mitigation  measures,  in \naccordance  with  (a)  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002);  and  (b)  the  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental  laws  and  regulations  are  incorporated  into  all  subproject  designs,  and \nthat \nimplementation.  The \nGovernment will ensure that all subprojects for which an IEE is required include such \nIEE in the subproject proposal. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  subprojects  will  not  negatively  affect  indigenous \npeoples.  In  the  event  of  involvement  of  indigenous  people  in  any  of  the  subprojects, \nthe  Government  will  take  all  necessary  actions  required  under  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998). \n\nincorporated  during  subproject \n\nthese  measures  are \n\n(x) \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\nThe Government will ensure that a specific plan for local consultations with civil works \ncontractors to address safety, social, and cultural issues during project implementation \nwill be included in the bidding documents. The Government will further ensure that civil \nworks  contractors  provide  men  and  women  equal  employment  opportunities  without \nany  differentiation  of  wages  for  equal  work.  The  mechanisms  for  maximizing  local \nemployment benefits will be included in the project design and bidding documents. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment  (1998),  (a)  project  interventions  take  into  account  different  impacts  and \nneeds  of  women  and  men;  (b)  special  features  are  built  into  subprojects  to  facilitate \nand  encourage  women\u2019s  participation  and  to  ensure  tangible  benefits  to  women;  and \n(c)  project  reporting  reflects  gender-specific  issues  and  gender  disaggregated  data, \nwhere applicable. \n\n(xiii)  The  Government  will  provide  adequate  security  for  the  smooth  and  uninterrupted \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  The  Government  will  be  responsible  for  removal  of \nmines and unexploded ordnance as necessary in subproject areas. \n\n(xiv)  The Government will work with the local communities to ensure that poppy cultivation \n\ndoes not take place in the subproject areas. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan and grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement \n\n67. \nof ADB and recommend that the Board approve the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  42,446,000  to  the \nIslamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Western Basins Water Resources Management \nProject  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1% \nper annum during the grace period and thereafter; a term of 40 years, including a grace \nperiod  of  10  years  during  which  time  the  total  amount  of  interest  charged  will  be \ncapitalized; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft Financing Agreement presented to the Board; \nin respect of such loan, a variation from the existing loan terms under ADF resources \non an exceptional basis; and  \nthe  grant  not  exceeding  $14,500,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  the \nWestern  Basins  Water  Resources  Management  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources  on  the  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those \nset forth in the draft Financing Agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n29 November 2005 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21\n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\nAssumptions \nStrengthened integrated water \nresource management (IWRM), \nimproved irrigation service \ndelivery, and enhanced \nagricultural practices to \nincrease the productivity of \nirrigated agriculture will improve \nrural livelihoods. \nRisks \n1.

Agriculture makes up about 50%  and 60% of Afghanistan's gross domestic  product (GDP) \nand  employs  about  80%  of  the  population.  Irrigated  Agriculture  is  responsible  for  up  to  80%  of  all  agricultural \nproduction in some years. Afghanistan has about 2.5\u20133.0 million hectares (ha) of agricultural land with some irrigation \nfacilities  out  of  the  total  arable  area  of  about  8  million  ha.1  However,  much  of  this  land  receives  only  intermittent \nirrigation and in some years may receive no irrigation at all due to poor condition of systems and variable rainfall. The \nNational Vulnerability Survey indicated that lack of irrigation water was the number one constraint to agriculture across \nthe county at 31%.2 Rainfed agriculture takes place on about 4.5\u20135.0 million ha but is unreliable for productivity due to \nvariability in rainfall including recurrent drought. \n \nUntil  2003,  Afghanistan  had  not  been  self-sufficient  in  cereal  production  since  1976.  From  1978  though  the  1980s, \nproduction  steadily  fell  due  to  civil  unrest  and  associated  deterioration  of  the  agricultural  sector  and  food  insecurity \nwas widespread. In 1990, production was only 60% of previous levels, yet the sector recovered throughout the 1990s \ndue to improved security and better rainfall. However, a chronic drought from 1999 to 2001 devastated the agricultural \nsector  with  a  near  total  failure  of  rainfed  farming.  Many  traditionally  irrigated  lands  were  deprived  of  water,  which \ndestroyed long-standing orchards and vineyard in many areas. Livestock was significantly impacted with substantially \nreduced  herds  with  a  corresponding  drop  in  rural  assets  and  wealth,  especially  affecting  the  landless  and  nomadic \nherdsmen. By 2004, 70% of all rural households had still not fully recovered income or asset losses from the drought \nfrom 1999 to 2001. As a drought coping strategy, 40% of rural families decreased food consumption from levels that \nwere  already  deficient  for  adequate  nutrition,  and  many  were  forced  to  sell  land  for  income  rendering  them \npermanently worse off and more prone to poverty. \n \nIncreased security and better rains in 2002 and 2003 improved agricultural performance with a record cereal harvest \nof  about  5.4  million  tons  in  2003.  Favorable  conditions  benefited  other  crops  as  well  as  livestock,  and  the  strong \nrecovery  of  the  agricultural  sector  was  driving  economic  growth.  In  2004,  however,  another  deficit  rainfall  year \nbrought  about  drought  conditions  that  were  estimated  to  have  caused  a  20\u201325%  decline  in  cereal  production. \nBecause of the drought conditions, an estimated 16% GDP growth for 2003\u201304 was revised downwards to 8%, and \nan additional 2.5 million Afghans were faced with food insecurity. The recurrent droughts are not only detrimental to \nagricultural production but seriously impact drinking water supplies and health in many rural communities. To ensure \nfood  security,  reduce  rural  poverty,  and  ensure  national  economic  growth,  development  of  water  resources  and \nimproving irrigated agriculture are essential since the productivity and reliability of rainfed farming does not provide a \nsustainable basis to achieve these. \n\n \nIn December 2001, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and World \nBank  jointly  undertook  a  preliminary  needs  assessment  study  of  various  sectors.  The  assessment  recognized  the \nneed for a comprehensive approach to water resources management, irrigation, and ensuring women and vulnerable \ngroups benefit from rural recovery initiatives.3 The National Development Framework4 was finalized by the Afghanistan \nInterim  Administration  in  April  2002.  Its  development  strategy  is  based  on  three  pillars:  (i)  humanitarian  and  human \nand social capital, (ii) physical reconstruction and natural resources including emphasis on water resources, and (iii) \nprivate  sector  development.  In  March  2004,  Securing  Afghanistan\u2019s  Future  was  formulated  jointly  between  the \nGovernment of Afghanistan, ADB, United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan, UNDP, and World Bank for an \ninternational conference held in Berlin. This document set out the plans for the future of Afghanistan over the coming \n10\u201320  years,  in  line  with  the  Afghanistan  National  Development  Framework,  including  emphasis  on  development  of \nwater resources and irrigation infrastructure and associated natural resource management, particularly the need for a \ncomprehensive approach to water management through basin management. The Afghanistan National Development \nStrategy  that  is  currently  under  preparation  also  highlights  the  development  of  water  resources  and  irrigated \nagriculture  as  key  development  elements  to  poverty  reduction  and  growth  of  the  national  economy.  Afghanistan\u2019s \ndevelopment  strategies  have  all  linked  the  importance  of  infrastructure  development  and  strengthening  institutional \nframework for water resources and irrigated agriculture as key objective\u2019s to reduce poverty. \n\n                                                 \n1  Statistics on the extent of irrigation, land-use, and other agricultural information are uncertain. \n2  World Food Program, and Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development. 2004.

Poverty Analysis                                                      Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nA.  \nInternationally, poverty levels are indicated by several means such as the rates for child mortality, maternal mortality, \naccess  to  water  and  sanitation  facilities,  adult  literacy  (particularly  in  females),  caloric  intake,  and  economic \nmeasurement.  The  gross  national  income  for  Afghanistan  is  estimated  at  $250.00  per  capita  per  year  and \napproximately  53%  of  the  population  is  classified  as  living  below  the  poverty  line.  About  half  the  rural  population  in \nAfghanistan  lack  regular  consumption  of  an  adequate  diet  (2,100  calories  per  day).  The  poorest  20%  of  the  rural \npopulation  experience  food  insecurity  in  years  of  good  harvest,  and  70%  of  children  do  not  receive  sufficient  food \nintake for normal development. Health indicators5 of poverty reveal that Afghanistan has an infant mortality rate of a \nhigh 165/1,000 and ranks the 4th highest under-5 infant mortality rate at 257 deaths/1,000. This compares with under-\n5 mortality rate ranking for Pakistan at 46th; Iran at 79th; and Tajikistan at 39th.   \n \nA  participatory  poverty  analysis  was  conducted  in  selected  communities  within  the  Hari  Rud  River  Basin.  Where \nagriculture and livestock were essential parts of the local economy. Over half of the villages surveyed perceived their \ncommunities  consisted  of  at  least  50%,  and  up  to  90%  in  some  cases,  of  households  living  below  a  poverty  line, \nbased upon their own characteristics of very poor, poor, and well-off. Characteristics of the very poor included being \nan  unskilled  laborer  (many  working  outside  of  the  community  but  within  Afghanistan),  suffering  ill-health,  being \nlandless,  or  sharecropping.  Vulnerability  was  defined  by  communities  as  households  headed  by  women  or  being \nelderly and given the years of fighting, many vulnerable households existed. In most communities surveyed, a majority \nof the households were classed as poor in which they had less than 2 ha landholding and were semiskilled with many \nreceiving  remittance  from  family  members,  mostly  working  in  Iran.  Based  on  primary  survey  data  covering  Herat \nProvince,  approximately  54%  of  the  population  are  classed  as  very  poor,  30%  are  poor,  and  16%  are  well-off.  In \naddition, data indicates that within the project area over 98% of the population has poor access to sanitation facilities \nand over 60% lack safe water supplies. \n \nB. \nThe  Western  Basins  Water  Resources  Management  Project  (the  Project)  supports  the  following:  (i)  improved  water \nresources  management  from  the  farm  to  the  river  basin  level;  (ii)  improved  irrigation  system  infrastructure  and  \nmanagement and agricultural support service resulting in increased area and yields for first season wheat crops; (iii) \nincreased  area  and  yields  of  second  season,  high  value,  diversified  horticulture  and  perennial  crops;  and  increased \narea  and  yields  of  fodder;  (iv)  income  generating  opportunities  for  the  landless  and  women;  and  (v)  capacity \ndevelopment  to  sustain  Project  benefits  and  to  continue  redevelopment  of  the  water  resources  and  irrigated \nagriculture  in  Afghanistan. The Project  will  enhance poverty  reduction and benefit rural  communities in the following \nmanner: \n\nImpact \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nImproved  irrigation  and  agricultural  support  services  will  increase  the  staple  crop  of  wheat \nproduction  improving  general  nutrition  and  food  security  especially  for  poor  farmers.  Increased \nsecond  season  cropping  will  also  support  better  nutrition  and  food  security.  Increased  fodder \nproduction will improve livestock production, which is critical for maintenance of rural wealth. \nAll types of enhanced agricultural production will increase incomes. Poor households are anticipated \nto have an increase of incomes of $234 or 117%. As noted, much of the productivity increase will be \nconsumed by poorer households. \nThe  increased  agricultural  production,  especially  second  season  cropping,  will  result  in  increased \ndemand for unskilled and semiskilled labor particularly from lower income groups and the landless.  \nThe Project will provide interventions that reduce risk of flooding and the impacts of drought, which \nwill mitigate significant poverty shocks. Many poor are living on marginal land washes that are prone \nto floods causing crop loss and erosion. Drought is the most pervasive poverty shock in Afghanistan \nand reducing drought impacts will have a significant impact on poverty reduction. These actions will \nprevent people from falling to poverty and needing to sell productive assets to get out of poverty. \nProject interventions will help provide viable alternatives to poppy cultivation especially for the poor \nwho have fewer options. \nThe  Project  will  provide  income  generating  opportunities  for  the  landless  and  women  who  do  not \nhave access to productive assets. The Project will provide resources and capacity development so \nthese marginalized members of society can develop skills and asset to sustain improved livelihoods. \nImproved water flow rates, canal access, and groundwater management will improve the access to \nand  the  quality  of  potable  water  sources  contributing  to  improved  human  health  throughout  the \nproject  area.  Positive  impacts  on  health  will  lead  to  more  productive  labor  and  potential  for \n\n                                                 \n5   United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. 2005.

Capacity \ndevelopment for farmers will improve their skills for more productive agriculture, which they can use \nand adapt long after the Project closes. \n\n \nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n    \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nA participatory survey,  and secondary  data  collection approach  was used to collect  qualitative and quantitative  data \ncovering  a  stratified  selection  of  communities  in  a  core  subproject  areas  during  the  Project  preparation  to  assess \npoverty  and  social  issues,  potential  positive  and  negative  social  impacts,  resettlement  and  land  acquisition \nrequirements,  and  stakeholder  views.  Women,  men,  and  children  (men  and  women  in  separate  groups);  different \nwealth  groups;  Government  and  ministry;  community \nleaders;  agriculture  and  nonagriculture  sector;  and \nnongovernment organizations and businesses were all consulted. Consultation measures included: direct observation, \nkey  subproject  settlement  scoping  surveys,  participatory  poverty  analysis,  household  key  informant  surveys, \nconsultation  and  qualitative  data  collection  (focus  group  discussions  and  community  mapping),  water  vulnerability \nscoring  and  ranking,  problem  and  solution  discussion,  and  key  informant  interviews.  A  participation  consultation \nstrategy was prepared as a part of the Project\u2019s implementation procedures. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n\n  \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nWomen  in  Afghanistan  play  a  far  less  prominent  role  to  males  in  social  and  economic  decision  making.  They  have \nbeen traditionally confined to household activities including taking care of children, home gardens, and some livestock \nactivities.  Women\u2019s  awareness  of  the  role  and  function  of  water  management  is  very  limited,  and  they  do  not  see \nthemselves as playing a part in water management decision making. Male stakeholders have limited perception of the \nrelevance  of  women\u2019s  involvement  in  agricultural  activities  or  natural  resource  use.  Women  landowners  are  not \nnormally involved in making decisions concerning use of their land, nor accessing revenues resulting from use of that \nland.  Women  landowners  are  not  normally  included  in  interactions  with  external  agencies.  Women  often  do  not \nparticipate  in  activity  discussions  as  social  restrictions  prevent  them  from  sitting  and  discussing  matters  with  men. \nWomen  cannot  be  grouped  as  a  single  element,  but  will  have  different  stakeholder  perspectives  as  much  as  men. \nInstitutional policies and practices constrain women\u2019s participation in project activities and are not supportive of their \nrole  in  the  agriculture  sector.  Women  experience  multiple  time  constraints  due  to  multiple  task  responsibilities  in \ndifferent  ways  than  men,  thus  having  implications  for  participation.  Both  men  and  women  feel  women  need  more \nsupport than they are currently receiving in order to successfully participate in natural resource management activities. \n \nThe Project\u2019s gender development activities to benefit women and men include the following: \n\n\u2022 \n\nInvolvement  in  subproject  development.  Ensure  that  women  are  able  to  participate  in  the  positioning  and \ndesign  of  non-irrigation-related,  micro-infrastructure  and  are  included  in  the  subproject  rehabilitation  and \nupgrading.  Women  village  members  will  be  consulted  and  confirm  the  positioning  and  design  of  bridges  for \naccess to basic service and for other non-irrigation-related infrastructure developed with subprojects. This might \nalso  include  micro-infrastructure  to  support  and  enhance  access  to  irrigation  water  for  households  or  other \nnonirrigation  uses. Every subproject  will include consultation  with  women in the subproject area that  will be a \npart of the overall subproject development process and facilitated by the Project\u2019s gender specialists. \n\n\u2022  Diversification  of  income  sources.  This  will  be  accomplished  through  income  generation  opportunities  and \nappropriate skills development for women supported by the agricultural and livelihoods services component.  \n\u2022  Strengthening  of  the  asset  base.

Irrigated agriculture produces up to 80% \nof agricultural output, makes up 50\u201360% of the total national economy, and employs around 80% \nof  the  population.  Deficit  rainfall  in  2004  had  a  devastating  impact  on  the  economy  when  the \nexpected 16% annual gross domestic product growth was revised downward to 8% and 2.5 million \nAfghans  were  faced  with  food  insecurity.  In  the  National  Vulnerability  Risk  Assessment,  farmers \nthroughout  the  country  cited  lack  of  irrigation  water  as  the  number  one  constraint  to  agriculture.1 \nAgriculture  uses  95%  of  developed  water  supplies,  thus  improvement  of  irrigated  agriculture  and \nstrengthening of water resources management must be pursued in parallel to sustain Afghanistan\u2019s \neconomic growth and address rural poverty. \n \n2. \nThe Western Basins. Badghis, Ghowr, and Herat provinces comprise the western basins. \nWith the exception of Herat City, the second largest city in Afghanistan, most of the districts in the \nwestern  basins  are  nearly  100%  rural.  The  area  has  about  2  million  people,  or  8%  of  the \nAfghanistan\u2019s population, with Pashtuns and Tajiks being the most common ethnic groups. Up to \n30% of rural households are landless, the average farm size is no more than 1 hectare (ha), and \nincreasing numbers of the poorest households are farming on marginal land and in washes where \nrisk  of  drought  and  floods  is  high.  These  poorest  households  are  highly  vulnerable  to  livelihood \nshocks and thus have the most limited options to resist opium poppy cultivation in desperate times. \nPopulation growth will continue at nearly 2% per annum over the next 10 years; the area is a home \nto many returning refugees. Yet in spite of the challenges facing the western basins, the area has \nsome  of  the  greatest  potential  for  economic  growth  through  intensification  of  irrigated  agriculture \nand related services and industries. \n \n3. \nThe  Hari  Rud  and  Murghab  rivers  are  the  largest  in  western  Afghanistan;  together  their \nbasins cover 78,000 square kilometers (km) (over 12% of Afghanistan). They provide 3 billion cubic \nmeters of annual water runoff, split almost equally between the two basins, although the Hari Rud \nRiver  Basin  is  far  more  developed.  The  rivers  flow  west  from  Afghanistan  and  drain  into \nTurkmenistan,  with  the  Hari  Rud  first  passing  along  the  border  with  Iran.  The  majority  of  runoff \ncomes from snowmelt with high flood flows from March to June and very low flows from August to \nFebruary. Since most irrigation systems are river diversions, this means that discharge is excess in \nthe spring and deficit in the summer to meet crop water requirements, and farmers have adapted \ntheir irrigation and agricultural practices to this flood-flow water regime. The Salma Dam, which is a \nproposed  multipurpose  facility  to  be  constructed  160  km  east  of  Herat  and  financed  by  the \nGovernment of India, should mitigate spring floods and enhance dry season flows. \n \n\n1. \n\nIrrigation \n\nIrrigation in Afghanistan. Of the total land area of 65 million ha, only about 8 million ha is \n4. \nsuitable  for  cultivation.  Hydrologic  conditions  confine  most  surface  irrigation  to  the  major  river \nvalleys with seven provinces providing nearly one third the total irrigated area. Total irrigated area \nis  about  2.5\u20133.0  million  ha,  although  in  many  years  many  areas  may  only  have  intermittent \nirrigation.2 The country has five basic types of irrigation systems: (i) arhad or Persian wheel (about \n\n                                                 \n1  World  Food  Program,  and  Ministry  of  Rural  Rehabilitation  and  Development.  2004.  National  Risk  and  Vulnerability \n\nAssessment. Kabul. \n\n2  Data is uncertain for most statistics in Afghanistan.  \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n1%), (ii) karez3 (about 5\u201310 %), (iii) traditional surface water systems (about 80\u201390%), (iv) modern \nor  formal  surface  water  systems  (about  10%),  and  (v)  pump  systems  (unknown).  The  scale  and \ntechnical  characteristics  of  each  system  type  have  different  management  implications.  The  vast \nmajority  of  irrigation  is  traditional.  Of  the  irrigated  area,  only  about  1.7  million  ha  (55%)  is  in  the \nfunctional command of gravity systems. \n \n5. \nThe  Irrigation  Department.  Historically,  the  Government  has  played  a  limited  role  in \ndeveloping  and  managing  irrigation  systems,  and  the  majority  of  irrigation  has  always  been \ntraditional. The capacity of the Irrigation Department was significantly diminished during the recent \ncivil  unrest  leaving  few  qualified  engineers  or  other  staff.  Limited  resources  have  rendered  the \nIrrigation Department a moribund agency with no field activities taking place and provincial offices \nfalling  into  dysfunction.  In  the  post-Taliban  period,  the  Irrigation  Department  moved  to  the  newly \ncreated  Ministry  of  Irrigation,  Water  Resources,  and  Environment.  In  December  2004  after  the \npresidential  election  of  Hamid  Karzai,  the  ministries  were  reshuffled  and  consolidated,  and  the \nIrrigation Department (including water resources management responsibility) moved to the Ministry \nof  Energy  and  Water  (MEW).4  The  task  of  rebuilding  and  developing  irrigation  and strengthening \nwater  resources  management  is  enormous;  however,  the  Irrigation  Department  has  dynamic \nleadership  and  is  committed  to  capacity  development.  Crafting  an  effective  institution  will  take  a \nlong-term commitment. \n \n6. \nTraditional  Irrigation  Systems.  Traditional  irrigation  systems  are  the  most  common  type \nof  irrigation  system  in  Afghanistan  and  are  based  on  gravity  surface  water  diversion  systems  or \nspring fed.5 They generally have few formal control structures and use earthen canals that rely on \nbrush, log, mud, stone, and some masonry water control structures. Intake structures are usually \nnot  engineered  or  permanent,  and  rely  on  brush,  logs,  rock,  and  makeshift  gabions.  Given  the \nannual flood hydrology and the fact that river channels often shift laterally and have lowering bed \nlevels,  intake  structures  need  to  be  rebuilt  on  a  frequent  basis.  Large  traditional  systems  may \nsupply  thousands  of  hectares  and  have  hundreds  of  kilometers  of  canals.  In  general,  the  size  of \nthe  traditional  irrigation  systems  increases  as  one  moves  down  the  river  valleys  and  out  into  the \nplains since the topography is more favorable for development, the land is more fertile, and flows \ngenerally larger. Larger systems have main, secondary, and smaller canals; may include numerous \nvillages in their command area; and may supply water for domestic use, livestock, and municipal \nsupply.  Average  irrigation  efficiency  is  considered  to  be  about  25\u201330%  due  to  high  conveyance \nlosses  in  traditional  schemes  and  high  on-farm  distribution  losses  due  to  poor  command  area \ndevelopment. \n \n7. \nIrrigated Agriculture in the Western Basins. About 18% of Afghanistan\u2019s irrigation is in the \nwestern  basins;  the  lower  Hari  Rud  River  Basin  contains  nearly  10%  of  the  country\u2019s  functional \ncommand  areas  although  it  comprises  only  3%  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  surface  area.  Local  communities \ndeveloped some canals over 500 years ago with a few able to irrigate up to 5000\u201310,000 ha. The \nsystems have sophisticated water allocation practices based on irrigated area and location within the \ncanal command. The western basins have 302,000 ha of irrigation, of which 173,000 ha (57%) are \nintensively irrigated and of this 109,000 ha (63% of intensive irrigation) are found in the lower Hari \nRud River Basin (Herat Province) (Table A3). Most of the intermittent irrigated lands were also in the \nHari  Rud  River  Basin  (62%)  with  the  majority  also  in  the  lower  Hari  Rud  River  Basin.  The  existing \n\n                                                 \n3   A karez is an indigenous water supply system that captures subsurface flow by tunneling horizontal shafts into the side \n\nof hills or mountains. \n\n4  The ministry was dissolved and environment was made an autonomous agency. \n5  Artesian  springs  are  common  in  many  areas  and  a  vital  source  of  surface  water  that  supplies  about  5\u20137%  of  all \nirrigation.  Although  the  water  source  is  different  from  surface  diversions  of  traditional  systems,  the  distribution  and \nsystem management are similar.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n31\n\nland in farms is about 170,000 ha; about 110,000 ha have functional gravity command systems. In \nthe long irrigation history of the lower Hari Rud River Basin, virtually all land that could be irrigated by \ngravity flow has already been brought into command, and the opportunities for new gravity schemes \non uncommitted land are very limited. Although less developed, the incised river valleys of the upper \nHari Rud River Basin and Murghab River Basin may limit the opportunities for new gravity schemes. \n \n\nTable A3: Irrigated Area by Subbasin within the Western Basin \n\n \nSubbasin \nBala Murghab \nKuchk wa Kashan \nRud \nLower Hari Rud \nUpper Hari Rud \nTotal \n \n\nIntensive \n\nhectares \n28,566 \n10,924 \n\n108,633 \n25,281 \n173,404 \n\n% \n16 \n6 \n\n63 \n15 \n57 \n\nIntermittent \n% \n27 \n10 \n\nhectares\n34,192 \n13,398 \n\nTotal \n\nhectares \n62,758 \n24,322 \n\n% \n21 \n8 \n\n57,043 \n23,717 \n128,350 \n\n44 \n18 \n43 \n\n165,676 \n48,998 \n301,754 \n\n55 \n16 \n100 \n\nNote: The Kuchk wa Kash Rud is a small, separate basin with little flow compared with the others. \nSource: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 1997. \n\n \n8. \nCondition  of  Irrigation  Infrastructure.  About  one  third  of  Afghanistan's  villages  were \ndamaged  or  destroyed  during  the  first  10  years  of  war  (1979/89),  and  the  impact  on  irrigation \ninfrastructure stems partly from direct combat damage. However, degradation is mainly due to the \nexodus of farmers and dereliction of operation and maintenance (O&M). After the war in the 1990s, \nsome communities were able to rehabilitate small traditional irrigation systems. In larger and more \ncomplex  schemes  with  intakes  from  bigger  rivers,  greater  problems  were  encountered  including \ncomplete  sedimentation  of  larger  canals  and  dilapidation  of  major  structures  and  canals.6  An \nestimated 10% of systems were directly affected by combat, while another 40%, particularly large-\nscale schemes, were damaged due to lack of O&M and uncontrolled flows entering the systems. In \nsome areas, access to irrigation water may have been reduced by more than 50% since the pre-\nwar  era,  and  irrigated  area  has  declined  by  as  much  as  33%.  In  addition  to  the  need  for \nrehabilitation,  many  of  the  traditional  schemes  would  benefit  from  upgrading  including  improved \nriver intakes, rationalization of canal networks, improved structures for water control and regulation, \nimproved cross drainage, canal protection, and other improvements consistent with modern design \nand  construction.  This  will  increase  water  use  efficiency;  improve  control  over  water  distribution; \nand reduce annual maintenance needs.7 Intensive irrigation as a proportion of functional command \nshrunk alarmingly in the western basins between 1995 and 2003, from 57% to less than 30%, as a \nresult  of  the  prolonged  drought.  Significant  investment  in  rehabilitation  is  needed  and  would  yield \nsubstantial returns by bringing abandoned irrigated land back into intensive irrigation and improving \nwater supply reliability throughout the systems. \n \nTraditional  Irrigation  Management  under  the  Mirabs.8  In  traditional  systems,  ongoing \n9. \ncommunity  management  continues  to  be  responsible  for  most  system  O&M  and  management. \nCommunities select mirabs who are the local water masters responsible for managing the system, \nincluding  water  allocation  and  O&M  with  the  support  of  community  labor.  In  larger  irrigation \n\n                                                 \n6  Unexploded  ordnance  and  land  mines  also  pose  challenges  for  irrigation  development  and  rehabilitation  in  many \n\nareas. \n\n7  The last decades of civil unrest were particularly devastating for the karez with many falling into disservice due to the \ndisruption of traditional community O&M. The recent influx of groundwater pumps has also desiccated karez flows and \nwithout adequate groundwater management, this trend is likely to continue. This trend has significant equity concerns \nsince karez water, which is traditionally a community resource, is being usurped for private use by individuals who can \nafford pumps and their operation. \n\n8   Mirabs are traditionally community water managers responsible for traditional irrigation schemes. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nsystems,  a  mirab  bashi  is  selected  with  responsibility  for  the  entire  irrigation  system  starting  with \nthe intake for the primary canal. Additional mirabs are selected to manage the distribution from the \nsecondary  canals,  while  a  chak  bashi  is  selected  at  the  tertiary  level.  In  some  instances,  a \ntimekeeper (saatchi) or assistants may be selected to oversee rotation.9 \n \nA village shura (council) usually selects the mirab for a 1-year term although no term limit \n10. \nexists, and in many cases, the mirab will serve the majority of his lifetime and sometimes pass the \nposition on to his children, so long as the community is satisfied with performance. The mirab's role \nmay require full-time service during a large portion of the year, and in-kind fee is received from the \nharvest.  The  mirabs  receive  no  formal  assistance  from  the  Government  although  they  may \ncollaborate with the Irrigation Department or other authorities to help execute projects. Generally, \nthe  financial  and  other  resources  at  their  disposal  are  meager,  and  O&M  support  is  provided \nentirely  by  the  community.  Mirabs  are  usually  still  able  to  mobilize  significant  community  labor, \nsometimes hundreds or thousands of men in labor gangs, using manual methods for O&M in most \nsystems. \n \n11. \nDispute  resolution  within  the  irrigation  network  is  addressed  by  the  mirabs,  yet  concerns \nmay  be  referred  to  the  shura  for  decision  and  possible  sanction.  At  the  community  level, \nenforcement appears to be addressed through public reprimands with shame as the main coercive \nmeasure. In some instances, however, mirabs or irrigators may bring issues to the attention of the \nIrrigation  Department  or  other  district  or  provincial  authorities,  including  the  governor's  office,  for \nassistance to resolve a situation, especially allocation conflicts between different irrigation systems. \nIn these cases, the mirabs act as system advocates. \n \n12. \nthe \ninstitutional  structure  for  community  management  has  degraded  during  the  last  30  years  of  civil \nunrest. In some communities, mirabs have difficulty enforcing the water allocation schedules. The \nrise of local commanders in the rural power vacuum created after the fall of the Taliban along with \nthe  influx  of  weapons  over  the  last  two  decades  has  made  it  difficult  to  stop  unauthorized \nabstractions of irrigation water in some areas. Upstream users are more emboldened to take water \nbeyond their share and mirabs, even with the backing of provincial officials, have little recourse to \naddress  the  situation.  The  return  of  authority  to  local  government  officials  and  the  rule  of  law \nsupported through the demilitarization and demobilization of former combatants will be necessary \nto  fully  restore  irrigation  management  to  mirabs  and  the community.  Fortunately,  the  condition  of \nthe mirab institutions in the lower Hari Rud River Basin is robust, and most of the mirabs are well-\nestablished  and  have  good  relations  with  MEW  and  provincial  officials.  Community  support  is \nstrong as witnessed by the thousands of laborers participating in canal maintenance during 2004 \nand  2005  in  the  western  basins  observed  by  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  missions  and \ntechnical assistance consultants. \n \n13. \nTraditional  Water  Allocation.  Traditional  irrigation  in  Afghanistan  has  a  water  allocation \nsystem  based  on  irrigated  area  that  dates  back  several  centuries.  In  Northern  Afghanistan,  the \npaikal is the basic unit for water allocation, and it corresponds to both a unit of land as well as the \nmeasure of a flow of water for irrigation.10 Paikal land also refers to the agricultural land type (i.e., \nirrigated  land),  and  historically  specific  taxes  were  paid  on  paikal  land.  The  taxes  paid \ncorresponded  to  the  size  of  the  landholding,  and  accordingly  the  water  allocation  was  also \n\nCurrent  State  of  Traditional  Management.  Like \n\ninfrastructure, \n\nthe  physical \n\n                                                 \n9  The  discussion  presents  a  generalized  view  based  mainly  on  northern  and  western  areas,  and  actual  arrangements \nand  terminology  differ  from  system  to  system.  In  some  areas,  the  term  wakil  is  used  to  refer  to  the  mirab  bashi,  or \nwakil will sometimes assist the mirab with defining allocation and distribution.  \n\n10 Paikal is used in northern Afghanistan, while in the west the basic unit for land and water is the juftgau, yet the concept \n\nand allocation methods are the same. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n33\n\ncontingent  on  the  paikal  tax  paid.  A  paikal  does  not  always  appear  to  be  uniform,  but  is  usually \nbetween 350 to about 500 jeribs of land (one jerib equals 1,953 square meters), and its size may \ndepend on whether it is located in the head or the tail of the irrigation system. A paikal is converted \nto a unit water allocation through a corresponding unit-width that allows the water to pass through \na control structure to the corresponding irrigated area within the irrigation system, which is called a \npaikal width. \n \n14.  Water allocation is thus proportional among different off-takes from a river as well as within \nthe system at canal structures; each with a prescribed allocation that corresponds to the area to be \nirrigated and a width of intake or division structure. The allocation system is based on continuous \nflow and does not account for changes of level in the river or in the canal, so volume of delivery is \nnot  constant,  yet  is  roughly  proportional.  As  one  moves  down  the  canal  system,  rotation  is \npracticed in some systems with complex distribution schedules that involve hourly rotations on as \nhigh as a monthly rotation cycle in some lower level canals. In northern Afghanistan, current paikal \nallocations were formalized into law in 1925 and 1926, although the canals and practices date back \nseveral  centuries  commensurate  with  the  irrigation  systems.  Strict  adherence  to  the  traditional \nallocation system has weakened in some cases, and even when the paikal system is adhered to it \nis  still  imprecise.  However,  all  mirabs  and  irrigated  landholders  are  aware  of  the  system  and  at \nleast  superficially  acknowledge  the  system  and  their  particular  paikal  allocations  and  rotations. \nMost  importantly,  most  Afghan  farmers  understand  how  the  system  works  and  irrigate  with  the \nexpectation of a limited allocation. \n \n\n2. \n\nAgriculture \n\n15. \nAgriculture  has  always  been  vital  to  the  national  economy  and  plays  a  central  role  in \nAfghanistan\u2019s  redevelopment  efforts  and  poverty  reduction.  Agriculture,  however,  suffered  during \nthe last 25 years due to deterioration of supporting infrastructure, including irrigation and prolonged \ndroughts. Afghans are assiduous farmers, and with recent stability complemented by better rains, \nthe  agriculture  sector  is  rebounding.  Farmers  have  access  to  improved  seed  as  well  as  fertilizer \nwhere  water  supplies  are  reliable;  however,  inadequate  knowledge  of  improved  agricultural \nproduction  processes,  lack  of  assured  and  timely  irrigation,  weak  institutional  capacity  of  the \nprivate  and  public  sectors,  and  lack  of  credit  and  access  to  markets  pose  constraints  in  some \nlocations.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Animal  Husbandry,  and  Food  (MAAHF)  is  the  Government \nagency responsible for agricultural development. ADB\u2019s Agriculture Sector Program loan11 provides \nguiding  policy  principles  that  were  discussed  in  detail  with  the  Government  and  lays  out  a  road \nmap to sector reform and growth. \n \nAgriculture in the Western Basins. Although a large ministry, MAAHF has weak capacity \n16. \nin Kabul and in the provinces. The MAAHF office in Herat does have a staff of over 400 employees \nincluding  officers  in  the  16  districts  of  the  province.  However,  the  office  has  fewer  than  100 \ntechnical  staff  and  their  competence  is  low.  MAAHF  resources  to  support  extension  work, \ntransport, or research are limited or nonexistent. Much of the support to MAAHF, including vehicles \nand equipment, has been provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \nwhich  has  been  operating  in  Afghanistan  continually  through  the  Taliban  time.  Nongovernment \norganizations also provide some agricultural support services. \n \n17. \nThe western basins, especially the Hari Rud River Basin, have an agricultural history dating \nback centuries with traditional irrigation. Agriculture is based on a wheat and opportunistic summer \ncrop/fallow  rotation  with  increasing  importance  of  rice,  vegetables,  and  fruit  where  water  is \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\navailable.  During  the  period  of  civil  unrest,  horticulture  declined  due  to  lack  of  investment  and \ndrought. Dried fruits, such as raisins and apricots, and nuts, including almond and pistachios, have \ndiminished  in  importance,  partly  due  to  international  competition.  The  disruption  of  conflict  and \nreduced investment in these longer term crops has reduced volumes quantity and competitiveness. \nDespite  this,  vegetable  production  is  now  increasing  close  to  population  centers  and  new  high-\nvalue  crops  such  as  saffron  are  slowly  emerging.  A  strong  agricultural  base  still  exists,  but \nproductivity is low and farmers need improved irrigation as well as extension services to help them \ntake advantage of higher value opportunities.  \n \nLocal  Agriculture  Demand.  Substantial  unmet  demand  currently  exists  for  food  in  the \n18. \nwestern  basins,  and  given  population  and  income  growth,  the  vast  majority  of  additional  food \nproduced through the intensification of agriculture in the western basins will be consumed locally. \nRainfall is insufficient and unreliable, so improved irrigated agriculture or imports must provide the \nincremental  volume,  quality,  and  diversity  of  regional  and  national  production.  The  expected \nincremental  annual  demand  for  vegetables  and  potatoes  is  expected  to  exceed  30,000  tons  by \n2015, which could be met locally through increased production from improved irrigation. Regional \ndemand  for  an  incremental  90,000  tons  of  wheat  is  unlikely  to  be  fully  satisfied  from  local \nproduction,  so  increases  in  wheat  production  will  have  a  strong  local  market.  Some  of  the \nincremental  productivity  will  be  consumed  within  households  and  therefore  help  improve  food \nsecurity. Economic growth by 2015 is estimated to cause a 30% increase in per capita demand for \nfood, which will strengthen demand for higher value crops. \n \n\n3. \n\nWater Resources Management \n\n19. \nPolicy Framework. The Irrigation Department is responsible for integrated water resources \nmanagement  (IWRM),  and  the  policy  framework  for  IWRM  and  irrigated  agriculture  is  emerging. \nThe Strategic Framework for the Water Sector, approved by the Cabinet in May 2004, commits to \nthe  following  six  principles  which  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Water  Policy  (i)  decentralization  of \nplanning, development, and management of water resources to river basins; (ii) delivery of water \nservices  by  autonomous  and  accountable  institutions;  (iii)  sustainable  water  use  within  a \ntransparent policy framework; (iv) participatory and consultative processes; (v) a program of long-\nterm capacity building, budget support, and research; and (vi) equitable treatment of international \nwaters.  In  accordance  with  these  principles,  the  Government  issued  policies  on  water  resources \nand  irrigation  during  2004.  The  specific  objectives  of  the  irrigation  policy  are  \u201cto  develop  and \nmanage irrigation systems cost-effectively; ensure technical, social, institutional, and environmental \nsustainability;  and  promote  user  participation  in  local  water  management  that  can  ensure  overall \nincrease in production and productivity of agriculture.\" Based on the principles found in the various \npolicies,  MEW  is  currently  drafting  a  revised  water  law  that  was  last  amended  in  1981.  Although \nthe policy framework is being established with external assistance, developing the implementation \narrangements as well as the capacity (both human and technical) especially at the provincial and \nregional level to realize the policies poses a long-term challenge. \n \n20. \nGroundwater.  Groundwater  falls  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Ministry  of  Mines  and \nIndustry,  and  a  groundwater  management  strategy  is  currently  under  preparation  through  ADB\u2019s \nAgriculture Sector Program loan (footnote 9). However, applying and implementing the strategy in \na particular groundwater basin and developing a management plan will require time and capacity. \nInitial  assessments  indicate  that  the  Hari  Rud  River  Basin  has  significant  groundwater  potential \neven though it has remained largely unexploited. Both shallow and deep wells are increasing in the \narea  and  this  trend  is  expected  to  accelerate  as  incomes  rise.  Although  offering  tremendous \nopportunity,  insufficient  information  exists  regarding  sustainable  groundwater  yields.  Once  this \ninformation  is  known,  a  basin  management  plan  can  be  developed  to  support  sustainable \ndevelopment of groundwater. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n35\n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO AFGHANISTAN FOR  \nWATER RESOURCES AND IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE \n \n \nDuration \n\nSource \n\n2003\u20132004 Asian Development Bank  Grant \n\n0.7 \n\nType  Amount \n($ million) \n\nProject \n\n1.

While  the  core  subprojects  prepared  under  the \nproject preparatory technical assistance (TA)1  focused on irrigation rehabilitation and upgrading \n(R&U),  some  subprojects  executed  under  the  Western  Basins  Water  Resources  Management \nProject  (the  Project)  are  expected  to  include  a  wider  range  and  type  of  works.  These  may \ninclude  (i)  weirs  for  control  of  diversions  of  ephemeral  flows  and  increased  groundwater \nrecharge, (ii) other flood control activities, (iii) small storages for domestic and irrigation supply \npurposes,  and  (iv)  development  of  groundwater  resources  through  infiltration  galleries  or \npumping technology among others. \n \n2. \nOverall  Rationale  and  Spatial  Disposition  of  Additional  Investments.  In  selecting \nadditional  candidate  subprojects,  the  following  rationale  will  be  applied:  (i)  Irrigation  system \nrehabilitation is based on unit area (irrigable) cost of roughly from $300 to $700 per hectare (ha), \nalthough  a  12%  internal  rate  of  return  is  the  defining  economic  criterion.  (ii)  Approximately  $3.5 \nmillion is to be invested in nonirrigation works, flood protection, small storage, and weirs. If these \nsubprojects  are  not  viable,  funds  will  be  reinvested  in  irrigation  R&U.  (iii)  Irrigation  system  R&U \nwithin  subbasins  are  to  be  roughly  pro  rata  by  irrigation  command  area  per  subbasin \n(requirements may also be included for district distribution) divided at about 80% to Hari Rud and \n20% to Murghab River Basin, subject to confirmation after investigation. Based on these criteria, \nan  estimated  45,000  ha  will  receive  R&U  under  the  Project,  of  which  approximately  15\u201325 \nschemes will be in the Hari Rud River Basin for about 55,000 ha and an additional 3\u201310 schemes \nin the Murghab River Basin for about 10,000 ha. This is approximately 50% of the area intensively \nirrigated in western basins.  \n \nB. \n\nCriteria to Screen New Investments  \n\n3. \nBased on the experience in the selection of the TA subprojects, and to facilitate timely \nacceptance or rejection of potential new subprojects, screening criteria (Table A5.1) will be used \nfor  subprojects.  They  will  be  refined  as  the  Project  progresses.  Given  the  poor  quality  of  the \npresent  data  as  well  as  difficulty  in  defining  absolute  development  objectives  to  prioritize \nsubprojects  (i.e.,  equity,  efficiency,  poverty),  an  exclusionary  approach  will  be  used  versus  a \nranking  or  weighting  system.  Many  of  the  irrigation  schemes  and  potential  water  resources \ndevelopment  subprojects  will  meet  the  criteria  (Table  A5.1).  Selection  of  subprojects  will  be \nundertaken  by  the  project  implementation  committee  with  the  support  from  the  project \nmanagement unit. Selection of the first five subprojects will be approved by Asian Development \nBank (ADB), and if found acceptable, further subproject selection will not require ADB approval \nexcept those over $3 million. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Plan \n\nThe  identification  of  new  subprojects  will  initially  focus  on  systems  within  the  Hari  Rud \n4. \nRiver Basin. This approach is based on the support from the project management unit, rationale \nof proximity, extension of lessons learned from core subprojects, and the distribution of systems \nwithin the project area.

The Hari Rud River Basin has more than 180 existing canal irrigation \nsystems, of which 135 are in the lower Hari Rud River Basin; 25 of these (with combined area of \n64,000  ha)  are  larger  than  1,000  ha.  Ten  systems  in  the  upper  Hari  Rud  River  Basin  (with \ncombined irrigated area of 11,000 ha) are larger than 500 ha. \n \n\nTable A5.1: Subproject Selection Criteria Checklist \n\nCriterion \nEconomic and Financial \nThe subproject has at least 12% economic internal rate of return. \nThe projected incremental increases in farm income exceed the projected incremental increase in \nannual recurrent costs (such as agricultural inputs, maintenance and repair of the irrigation \ninfrastructure, etc.). \nThe subproject will have adequate financial benefits to ensure the subprojects financial sustainability. \nTechnical \nThe site is suitable for the rehabilitation and upgrading or construction of new irrigation infrastructure \nusing technologically appropriate structures and technology. \nThe soils and topography are suitable for constructing irrigation works and supporting irrigated \nagriculture, including adequate natural drainage, and not subject to the risk of excessive settlement, \npoor stability, or severe erosion. \nThe subproject has a size and scale such that the participating farmers are generally capable of \nindependently operating and maintaining the systems when construction activities are complete. \nThe seasonal water supply is reliable enough to satisfy farmers\u2019 risk tolerance. \nSocial \nCommunities have pledged to abstain from poppy cultivation. \nThe intended communities have indicated enthusiasm for the subproject and a willingness to operate and \nmanage it in a cohesive fashion as demonstrated through willingness to contribute materials or in-kind labor to \nthe subproject development and through willingness to commit to execution of an operation and maintenance \nplan. \nThe community have an adequate decision making structure for identifying needs, accessing resources, and \ndistributing benefits in an equitable manner to all members of the irrigation community. \nThe subproject will have a positive impact on a significant portion of the local community. \nThe subproject will not negatively affect communities not involved in execution of the subproject. \nResettlement or compensation impacts are acceptable to the community and in accordance with ADB \nsafeguards. \nAgriculture  \nThe subproject has the technical potential to produce higher yields through improved irrigation facilities \nand cultivation practices, and has suitable terrain and soils. \nThe subproject provides the opportunity for an increase in cropping intensity. \nThe subproject provides the possibility for co-implementation of other Project components: including on-\nfarm water management techniques, agricultural support services, and innovative irrigation technology.  \nEnvironment \nThe subproject will not have a significant negative effect on established water or land users in the watershed. \nThe subproject is clear of encroachment or negative impacts upon existing or proposed protected areas \n(parks, reserves), historical, cultural, or religious sites. \nThe subproject is to be clear of encroachment or negative impacts upon any existing biodiversity sites \nand/or endangered species of flora and fauna. \nThe subproject is free from any significant negative effects on surface water hydrology and/or natural \ndrainage. \nThe subproject is free from any significant other negative environmental effects such as catchment \ndegradation, increased silt loads, water pollution, etc. \nSecurity \nThe subproject is free from any known exceptional security risks (e.g., mines, unexploded ordnance, and \nactive armed conflicts). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n\nYes  No \n\n \n\u221a \n\u221a \n\n\u221a \n \n\u221a \n\n\u221a \n\n\u221a \n\n\u221a \n \n\u221a \n\u221a \n\n\u221a \n\n\u221a \n\u221a \n\u221a \n\n \n\u221a \n\n\u221a \n\u221a \n\n \n\u221a \n\u221a \n\n\u221a \n\n\u221a \n\n\u221a \n\n \n\u221a \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n5. \nTable A5.2 lists the 25 irrigation canals in the lower Hari Rud River Basin with a command \narea greater than 1,000 ha.2 This does not include the three subprojects prepared during the TA. \nThese  canals  may  be  considered,  due  to  size  and  value  of  investment,  primary  candidates  for \nextension  of  irrigation  rehabilitation  works  in  the  lower  Hari  Rud  River  Basin.

The Project will also include income-generating activities for women and the \nlandless. The following analysis is based on the interventions proposed under the Project. \n \n2. \nProject  Costs.  The  total  project  financial  cost  is  estimated  at  $87.6  million,  including \ncontingencies, taxes and duties, and interest during implementation. The base cost (excluding \ntaxes and duties) for component 2, which includes irrigation R&U for the Hari Rud River Basin \nand  Murghab  River  Basin,  the  water  resources  and  development  subcomponent,  and  mirab \ncapacity  development  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  is  $52.7  million.  The  assumed \ninvestment  costs  for  irrigation  R&U  are  about  $565  per  irrigable  ha  based  on  the  estimated \nsubproject R&U costs. The base cost for component 1, integrated water resources management \nis $7.9 million; component 3, agriculture and livelihood services $8.5 million; and component 4, \ncapacity development and project management $8.6 million.  \n \n3. \nIntegrated  Water  Resources  Management.  Although  quantifiable  benefits  are  not \nattributed  to  this  component,  the  activities  will  provide  support  for  surface  and  groundwater \nmanagement  that  are  essential  for  long-term  development  and  economic  sustainability  of \nirrigated  agriculture  in  the  Hari  Rud  River  Basin  and  Murghab  River  Basin.  Improved  surface \nwater allocation will not only ensure maximum productivity, but also equity among upstream and \ndownstream water users. \n \n4. \nCapacity Development. Capacity development will help ensure long-term sustainability of \nproject  benefits  and  help  Afghanistan\u2019s  long-term  redevelopment;  however,  these  costs  are \nexcluded from the project analysis. Improved capacity of MEW will facilitate further irrigation R&U in \nthe region and throughout Afghanistan to extend project benefits. \n \nA. \n \nEconomic  and  financial  analyses  were  carried  out  for  three  core  subprojects  prepared \n5. \nunder  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  assess  economic  viability  and  the \nfinancial  impact  on  households.  Economic  analysis  of  the  overall  Project  is  also  presented. \nSensitivity  analysis  on  the  subprojects  and  the  Project  as  a  whole  were  conducted.  Farm \nbudgets  for  various  wealth  groups  were  estimated  to  assess  project  impacts  on  farm \nhouseholds.  With-project  and  without-project  scenarios  were  simulated  to  determine  the \nincremental project benefits. \n \nCosts. Project financial costs were estimated in afghanis (AFs) using prices prevailing in \n6. \nthe first half of 2005, and expressed in constant prices over the project implementation period of \n7  years.  Financial  prices  were  derived  from  local  sources  and  include  taxes  and  duties. \nEconomic prices were derived based on the following criteria: (i) a domestic price numeraire; (ii) \nvalues expressed in constant 2005 prices to exclude inflation; (iii) a standard conversion factor \nof 0.9 for nontraded goods and services; (iv) a shadow value of 0.6 for unskilled and agricultural \nlabor to take account of the labor surplus in rural areas; (v) border parity pricing with standard \nmethods to derive farm-gate input/output prices for major tradable commodities and goods; and \n\nMethodology and Main Assumptions \n\n                                                 \n1   The  Project  also  provides  funds  for  an  additional  6,500  ha  of  R&U  of  irrigated  areas  or  an  equivalent  benefit  in \n\nwater resources subprojects.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n45\n\nSubproject Overview \n\n(vi)  transfer  payments,  such  as  taxes  and  subsidies  being  excluded  in  calculating  economic \nvalues. \n \n7. \nThe  main  agricultural  inputs  are  labor,  seeds,  fertilizer,  and  animal  and  mechanical \npower.  The  prevailing  wage  rate  of  AF65  a  day  is  adjusted  by  the  opportunity  cost  of  labor. \nSeeds are valued at their border price equivalent adjusted by a 20% premium to reflect storage \ncosts and higher quality. Animal and mechanical power is valued at financial prices adjusted by \nthe  standard  conversion  factor.  The  economic  prices  of  the  main  tradable  agricultural  outputs \n(rice, wheat) and inputs (fertilizers) are based on import price equivalents since the prospect of \ndomestic  cultivation/manufacture  for  export  is  limited.  Afghanistan  might  possibly  produce \ntemporary  wheat surpluses in a good year, but it is currently importing and the implications of \npotential exports have been discounted. Raisins have been valued at their export-equivalent to \nrepresent a possible export opportunity. For nontraded commodities (most vegetables, grapes, \netc.)  the  local  financial  price  is  adjusted  by  the  standard  conversion  factor  to  reach  the \neconomic price. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nSubprojects.  For  the  three  irrigation  diversion  subprojects,  the  economic  and  financial \nanalysis  is  based  on  costs  including  investment  costs  for  R&U,  agricultural  and  livelihood \nsupport  services,  management  and  O&M,  and  an  allocation  for  management  overheads. \nAgricultural  benefits  are  derived  from  crop  budgets,  incorporating  expected  changes  in  yields, \ncropping patterns, and the extension of the irrigated area.2 The R&U costs for each subproject \nwere estimated based on the design of the proposed structures and R&U works prepared during \nthe  TA.  In  addition  to  R&U,  costs  for  agricultural  and  livelihood  support  services  are  included \nand distributed based on a per ha basis. Management overheads are derived and allocated on \na per hectare basis for both the subprojects and the overall project costing. \n \n9. \nOverview of Subproject Costs. Costs for R&U among the subprojects (Jui Nau, Sare \nPul,  and  Yahia  Abad)  varied  from  just  over  $1,000  to  about  $360  per  ha  depending  on  the \nrequired works. Differing costs were more a function of the systems design and layout than of \nthe condition of the systems since all systems are extremely deteriorated and need R&U. The \narea of R&U in the subprojects varied from 900 to 5,200 ha. \n \nSubproject  Returns  and  Sensitivity  Analysis.  The  expected  internal  rate  of  return \n10. \n(EIRR)  from  the  subprojects,  based  on  a  20-year  life,  varies  from  21%  to  15%.3  Sensitivity \nanalysis  was  carried  out  to  test  the  impact  of  changes  and  main  risks:  (i)  a  20%  increase  or \ndecrease  of  investment  costs,  (ii)  a  20%  increase  or  decrease  in  recurrent  costs  (i.e., \nmanagement  O&M),  (iii)  a  20%  increase  or  decrease  in  benefits,  (iv)  a  20%  increase  or \ndecrease in implementation management costs, or (v) an increase (25 years) or decrease (15 \nyears) in project life. Table A10 presents the findings from the analysis and sensitivity tests of \nthe  diversion  subprojects.  The  Sari  Pul  irrigation  diversion  system  has  the  weakest  financial \nreturns  but  also  the  highest  investment  costs  at  $1,006/ha.  The  most  robust  subproject  is  the \nYahia Abad subproject, which is viable except with a 20% reduction in benefits.  \n \n\n                                                 \n2  The irrigation diversion subprojects also include some works for flood control to protect the irrigation systems but \n\nthese benefits are not included in the analysis. \n\n3  Flood  protection  benefits  varied  widely  with  assumed  probabilities  and  damage  functions;  economically  attractive \nflood  control  subprojects  may  exist  in  the  western  basins,  but  they  will  require  evaluation  on  an  individual  basis \nbefore being included as a subproject. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nTable A10: Subproject Economic Internal Rate of Return (%) and Sensitivity Tests \n\nScenario \nNo management cost \nBase with management \n+20% investment cost \n-20% investment cost \n+20% recurrent cost \n-20% recurrent costs \n+20% benefits \n-20% benefits \n+20% management cost \n-20% management cost \n15-year project life \n25-year project life \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nJui Nau \n32 \n21 \n18 \n23 \n21 \n21 \n32 \n10 \n19 \n22 \n19 \n21 \n\nSare Pul \n21 \n15 \n12 \n17 \n14 \n15 \n24 \n6 \n14 \n16 \n12 \n16 \n\nYahia Abad \n28 \n19 \n16 \n22 \n18 \n19 \n32 \n7 \n17 \n20 \n17 \n19 \n\nThe Jui Nau Canal Irrigation Scheme \n\n \nC. \n \n11. \nSubproject Overview. The Jui Nau is typical of the larger irrigation systems in the lower \nHari Rud River Basin and provides an excellent example of the type and range of R&U activities \nto be executed under the Project. The Jui Nau main canal is 32 km and has five branch canals \nthat vary in length from 2.2 to 8.5 km for a total length of 22 km. All of the system\u2019s canals are \nseverely degraded and have poor profiles. The main canal has 101 discharge points; 45 occur \nat  17  major  bifurcations,  which  account  for  nearly  70%  of  total  discharge.  The  condition  of \ndischarge  points  is  very  poor  with  need  for  R&U  of  structure  and  improved  design.  In  some \ncases, the downstream sections and adjacent banks are severely undercut and eroded. Major \nstructures  in  the  system  include  (i)  a  main  canal  1.5  km  inverted  siphon;  (ii)  a  25  meter  (m) \naqueduct where failure is imminent; (iii) two flood spillways; and (iv) 84 foot and vehicle bridges \nthat cross the main canal and vary widely in dimension, construction, and condition. The canal \nprovides  domestic  and  livestock  water  supply;  however,  these  uses  are  not  included  in  the \nanalysis. \n \n12. \nSubproject  Cost.  The  total  area  within  the  canal  network  is  about  7,500  ha  however, \nonly  about  5,200  ha  are  irrigable,  and  usually  about  3,300  ha  are  irrigated  for  a  spring  wheat \ncrop with much less irrigated for summer crops.4 The total estimated cost of the R&U is about \n$1.8 million: (i) 45% for canal R&U, (ii) 23% to protect the canal network from flood damage, (iii) \n14% for upgrading intakes, (iv) 10% for bridges, and (v) 8% for R&U of minor and major control \nand conveyance structures. The cost is $355 per ha of R&U based on the 5,200 ha of irrigable \narea  plus  $55  for  survey  and  design.  An  additional  $90  per  ha  is  the  estimated  cost  of  the \nagricultural support service, livelihood service, and income-generating activities, and training for \nthe farmers and the mirabs to accompany the irrigation R&U.5 \n \n13. \nSubproject  Benefits.  The  present  cropping  pattern  in  the  Jui  Nau  is  dominated  by \nwheat planted in the spring. Of the remainder of the cropped area, feed and fodder, orchards, \nand  vineyards  account  for  10  to  20%;  and  vegetables,  cotton,  and  maize  make  up  the \nremainder.  A  small  percentage  of  less  than  5%  is  cropped  in  the  summer.  The  Project  will \nprovide  the  following  (i)  R&U  to  improve  the  equity  and  efficiency  of  water  distribution,  (ii) \nimproved water management through capacity development of the mirabs and communities, (iii) \nagricultural  support  services  and  capacity  development  for  farmers  to  improve  agricultural \n\n                                                 \n4  As with all of the traditional irrigation systems, they have no plans or design as they were built by communities and \n\nevolved over the centuries; so exact measurements or a \u201cdesign command area\u201d do not exist. \n\n5  Some of the training activities under the project analysis are included under capacity development and their costs \n\nexcluded from analysis of the overall Project. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n47\n\npractices,  and  (iv)  improved  irrigation  system  intakes.  The  improved  intakes  with  infiltration \ngalleries  will  increase  water  capture  efficiency  and  provide  more  reliable  summer  flows  with \nabout  40%  more  water  entering  the  system;  nearly  60%  of  this  water  will  benefit  tail-end \nfarmers. The cropped area for wheat is anticipated to increase from 3,300 ha to 4,100 ha in an \naverage  season  although  will  be  much  higher  in  years  of  good  rainfall.  Wheat  yields  are \nassumed to increase from a low base of 2.0 tons per ha (t/ha) to 2.8 t/ha.6 Of the incremental \n800  ha  that  will  receive  irrigation  (3,300\u20134,100)  in  the  without-project  situation,  one  half  is \nassumed  to  be  fallow  land  and  the  other  half  rainfed  wheat,  with  yields  of  1.0  t/ha  or  less. \nHowever,  in  dry  years,  the  yield  is  much  lower  or  nothing  at  all.  Given  the  increased  summer \nflows and growing demand in the basin, second season cropping for vegetables is anticipated to \nincrease  from  100  ha  to  500  ha  or  about  10%  of  the  irrigable  area  with  average  yields \nincreasing from 8.0 to 9.5 t/ha. Vineyard area is anticipated to increase from an existing 50 ha to \n130 ha with yields rising from 6.5 to 8.0 t/ha. \n \n14. \nStructural Failure. In addition to the yield increases, the civil works for Jui Nau provide \nflood protection for system structures and provide benefits through mitigation of risk of structural \nfailure. This risk is beyond normal deterioration due to lack of O&M since catastrophic incidents \nare possible with or without O&M. In the case of the Jui Nau, several failures are possible: (i) \nthe  loss  of  the  spring  intake  and/or major  breach  or  loss  of the  main  canal  at  the  head  of  the \nsystem, which could result in a total loss in spring value-added from irrigation; (ii) the loss of the \nsiphon that traverses a major wash and could affect 75% of the irrigable area; (iii) the loss of the \naqueduct, which is imminent, and would affect about 60% of the irrigable area; and (iv) the loss \nof the main canal where it parallels a major wash, which would impact about 60% of the system. \nLoss  of  a  major  structure  or  a  substantial  portion  of  the  main  canal  could  result  in  the  loss  of \nboth spring and summer irrigation benefits and perennial crops such as vineyards.  \n \n15. \nThe  loss  from  the  wheat  crop  is  greater  than  the  other  crops  due  to  the  much  greater \nextent of wheat cultivation even if irrigation is lost throughout the year. As the Project supports \nincreased summer cropping and improved yields, the loss potential also increases from system \nfailure. Although these benefits are not included in the EIRR of the overall project assessment, \nthey  provide  strong  support  for  project  interventions.7  Similar  risks  of  failure  posed  by  the  Jui \nNau are found in most of the schemes in the Hari Rud River Basin due to the intake technology, \nthe flood hydrology, and lack of flood protection improvements. \n  \n16. \nFarmer Financial Benefits. About 7,000 families live in the total command area with a \ntotal farm area of 5,210 ha.8 Land ownership is heavily skewed, with about 15% of families who \nare self-classified as the \u201cmedium\u201d wealth group farming nearly 40% of the area in small farms \nof about 2 ha. Another 40% of the farmed area is held by \u201cpoor\u201d and \u201cvery poor\u201d families in very \nsmall  holdings  of  less  than  1  ha.  Landlords  rent  out  the  remaining  20%  for  sharecropping  to \npoor,  very  poor,  and  landless  families.9  Landless  families in  the  subproject  area,  number  over \n3,000  although  not  all  are  engaged  in  farming  activities.  The  poor  farmer  has  an  average \nlandholding  of  about  0.8  ha.  The  incremental  benefits  to  the  poor  farmer  are  primarily  from \nwheat production, and in some cases vegetables. The net margin to the poor farmer will be an \nannual  increase  income  from  AF8,564  ($200)  to  about  AF18,555  ($434)  or  a  gain  of  $234, \n\n                                                 \n6   The  assumed  yield  increases  are  modest  given  the  current  low  baseline. The  national  average  yield  for  irrigated \n\nwheat in 2003 was 2.8 t/ha with many districts having yields of 3.0 to 3.7 t/ha. \n\n7  In the case of the Jui Nau, the failure of the intake leading to 100% loss of wheat crop with a 1 in 5 year probability \nwould lead to about 25% EIRR, if prevented through project activities. In the case of the loss of the aqueduct and \n50% of the cropped area for the entire year based on a 1 in 10 year probability would lead to an EIRR about 30% if \nprevented by the Project. \n\n8  As with all statistics in Afghanistan, a great deal of uncertainty exists. \n9  Income  classification  is  based  on  the  National  Risk  and  Vulnerability  Assessment,  World  Food  Program  and \nMinistry  of  Rural  Rehabilitation  and  Development,  2004.  Figures  should  be  seen  as  indicative  since  data  in \nAfghanistan is sparse and of questionable reliability. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nabout 117%. In many cases, a large portion of the increased grain production will be consumed, \nwhich will provide a large benefit for food security and better nutrition in the region. \n \n17. \nRecurrent and Incremental O&M Costs in the Jui Nau. O&M costs for the subproject \nhave traditionally been borne by the community, and the communities are expected to continue \nto carry out the majority of the O&M after R&U in the subproject area. In the case of the Jui Nau \nsubproject, which  is  typical  of  most  O&M  arrangements  in  traditional  irrigation  schemes,  O&M \ncosts  include  (i)  a  current  in-kind  management  fee  for  the  mirab,  (ii)  labor  donated  by  the \ncommunity  for  annual  O&M,  and  (iii)  incremental  costs  to  maintain  the  system  after  R&U  is \ncompleted  under  the  Project.  Currently,  a  farmer  pays  about  AF45  (a  little  over  $1)  per  ha \nthrough an in-kind wheat contribution by both active and absentee landlords at the end of the \nirrigation season. The contribution is in relation to their water allocation, which depends on their \nirrigated  landholding.  Based  on  the  typical  area  of  responsibility  for  a  mirab,  this  amounts  to \nabout  $225  per  mirab.10  The  fees  are  generally  considered  to  be  low,  and  mirabs  themselves \nare generally farmers or have other means of income. \n \n18. \nThe largest O&M cost is the annual desilting of the canals while the irrigation system is \nclosed prior to the spring season. In the Jui Nau, main canal maintenance is organized within \nsystem sections; upper (head), middle, and lower (tail). Landowners are required to supply their \nown or hired labor at the rate of 4 labor units per zoj (water allocation unit). The desilting takes \nabout 30 days with a workforce of about 1,000 laborers. Approximately 90,000 cubic meters of \nsediment  is  removed  from  the  main  canal  at  an  equivalent  cost  of  $40,000  to  $50,000.  Illegal \nbridges  are  also  removed  along  other  minor  repairs.  Individual  communities  maintain  branch \nand lower canals and their structures in addition to main canal desilting. About $9 to $11 per ha \nis being supplied by farmers, which is equivalent to about 7\u201310 days of labor. This is in addition \nto the little over $1 management fee that is being paid to the mirabs. \n \n19. \nIncremental  O&M.  The  R&U  under  the  Project  implies  incremental  maintenance  costs \nabove  current  desilting  requirements;  primarily  to  maintain  the  improved  intakes  and  the \ninfiltration  galleries.  It  also  includes  works  to  maintain  the  bifurcations  and  other  improved \ncontrol structures that will be a part of the R&U. These incremental costs will be about $2.6/ha \nper year, which represents about a 25% increase in the O&M contribution currently being made \nby the community. Given the net margins anticipated from the Project, even for the poor farmer, \nthis represents a little over 1% of the incremental income generated from the financial returns of \nthe  Project,  and  well  within  the  ability  of  the  farmer  to  pay.  The  project  approach  will  be  to \nprovide  flexibility  so  the  mirabs  and  communities  have  the  options  to  accomplish  O&M; \nhowever,  a  community  agreement(s)  will  be  created  for  each  subproject  to  define  the \ncommunity\u2019s responsibilities and commitment to execute O&M and management. \n \n20. \nEconomic Return and Sensitivity. Sensitivity was conducted for the subproject (Table \nA10).  The  scheme  is  relatively  robust.  Management  costs  for  the  Project  and  recurrent \nmanagement and O&M costs have the least amount of influence on the subproject causing at \nmost  a  1%  positive  or  negative  change  in  subproject  returns.  Investment  cost  also  has  little \nimpact and a 20% increase only causes the scheme to lose 3% on EIRR. The switching value is \nan  increase  of  120%.  The  scheme  is  most  susceptible  to  a  reduction  in  benefits;  a  20% \ndecrease reduces the EIRR to 10%. The switching value is a 16% reduction in benefits. \n \nD. \n\nOverall Project Economic and Sensitivity Analysis \n\n21. \nAgricultural Benefits. The overall project benefits are based on the aggregate total of \nthe  subproject  benefits  from  the  TA  subprojects.  The  benefits  include  the  following:  (i)  an \nincrease  in  wheat  yields  by  about  40%  from  a  low  baseline  yield  from  1.7  to  2.0  t  ha,  (ii)  an \n                                                 \n10  In larger systems such as the Jui Nau, the mirab structure is a federated system that has one mirab, responsible for \n\nthe entire system, with two tiers of mirabs managing the canal network below. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n49\n\nincrease in cropped area for wheat ranging from about 20 to 45% depending on the system, (iii) \nan increase in cropped area for rice of about 30% to 40% in some of the upstream systems, (iv) \nincreases  in  rice  yields  of  30  to  40%,  (v)  an  increase  in  vegetable  cropping  of  about  300%  to \n500%  from  the  improved  water  availability  due  to  enhanced  intakes  and  agriculture  support \nservices, (vi) increases in vegetable yields of around 18%, and (vii) increases in vineyards and \ntheir yields. Based on the assumed costs, the Project will provide R&U for about 55,000 ha of \nwhich approximately 15 to 25 schemes will be in the Hari Rud River Basin for about 45,000 ha \nand an additional 3\u201310 schemes in the Murghab River Basin for about 10,000 ha. In addition, \nthe  water  resources  development  subcomponent  can  provide  an  equivalent  of  6,500  ha  in \nirrigation  R&U  or  will  be  used  for  other  water  resources  projects.  The  buildup  of  benefits  is \nassumed to take place over 5 years.  \n \n22. \nEconomic  Analysis.  Overall,  the  Project  has  an  EIRR  of  17%.  Sensitivity  analysis  to \ntest  the  effects  of  changes  in  the  main  parameters  affecting  economic  returns  reveals  the \nfollowing results. A 20% increase in invest costs only caused the EIRR to drop to 15% and the \nswitching value for this parameter was 71% or about $785 per ha based on the assumed R&U \ncost. The recurrent costs had negligible impact when raised or lowered by 20% with the EIRR \nremaining  at  17%.  Similarly,  the  management  fee  only  resulted  in  a  change  to  15%  or  19% \nwhen the management fees were raised or lowered by 20%. The most sensitive parameter that \nnegatively impacted project returns was a 20% decrease in benefits, which dropped the EIRR to \n8%. This finding highlights the importance agricultural support services and O&M.  \n \n23. \nProject  Beneficiaries  and  Poverty  Impact.  Based  on  social  data  gathered  during \ndevelopment  of  the  subprojects  and  basic  demographic  information  in  the  project  area,  the \nProject will have a substantial impact on poverty. The average family size in the project area is \nabout seven persons (footnote 9). Farm holdings vary with slightly larger holdings in the upper \nHari Rud than in the lower Hari Rud River Basin, although far less irrigated area is found in the \nupper Hari Rud River Basin. Regardless of the difference, holdings are very small with medium \nwealth farmers holding around 2.5 ha, while in the lower Hari Rud River Basin the holdings for \nmedium income farmers are 1.8 ha. Poor farmers in both areas hold about 0.75 ha, while very \npoor farmers may have 0.2 ha. Sharecroppers typically farm no larger than 1 ha and comprise \naround  25\u201330%  of  the  farmers  in  a  given  system.  The  vast  majority  of  farmers  fall  into  the \nlandless,  poor,  or  very  poor  category,  so  that  at  least  75%  of  the  farmers  fall  into  the  poor  or \nvery poor group. For the project area, the average landholding is assumed to be no larger than \n1 ha and in many cases much smaller. Given the average family size and that the Project will \nrehabilitate 55,000 ha of irrigated land, the Project is anticipated to have the potential to reach at \nleast  400,000  to  500,000  people  in  the  western  basin  or  20%  to  25%  of  the  population;  and \noverwhelming majority of these people will be poor.  \n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \nA. \n\nBackground to Framework \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n\n1. \nAlthough  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  activities  are  not  anticipated  under  the  Western \nBasin  Water  Resource  Management  Project  (the  Project),  a  resettlement  framework  has  been \nprepared to mitigate any project-related resettlement impacts. The framework is based on the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Involuntary  Resettlement,  the  Afghan  Constitution  of  2004,  and  the \nAfghan Land Acquisition Law of 2000. The ADB policy states that  \n \n\nThe  involuntary  resettlement  policy  objectives  are  (i)  to  avoid  involuntary  resettlement \nwherever  feasible;  (ii)  to  minimize  resettlement  where  population  displacement  is \nunavoidable  by  choosing  alternative  viable  project  options;  and  (iii)  where  involuntary \nresettlement  is  unavoidable,  to  ensure  that  affected  people  receive  assistance,  preferably \nunder  the  project,  so  that  they  will  be  at  least  as  well  off  as  they  would  have  been  in  the \nabsence of the project. \n\n \nThis policy has been followed in the framework, especially in those matters where insufficient or no \nprovision is made in the laws of Afghanistan.  \n \n\n1. \n\nAfghan Land Acquisition Law of 2000 \n\n2. \nThe  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  (the  Government)  currently  has  no  formal  national \ncompensation  and  resettlement  policy  in  place.  The  current  policy  approach  is  reflected  in  the \nConstitution of Afghanistan 2004 and the Land Acquisition Law of 2000. This law provides that land \nacquisition for public use will only occur with prior and fair replacement at current market rates upon \napproval by the Cabinet. Part 2 of the law prescribes that replacements will be provided for (i) land \ncost, (ii) cost of all buildings on the land, (iii) cost of fruit trees, and (iv) other valuable plants on the \nland.  It  also  provides  that  at  the  landowner\u2019s  option,  cropland  of  a  similar  value,  and  a  house  of \nsuitable standards  may be  provided instead of monetary compensation.  A further  article provides \nfor compensation to be paid for the input costs of unharvested crops. The law requires notification \nof amounts of compensation to be made 3 months in advance. This allows time for those affected \nto  dispute  any  amount  to  a  compensation  committee  (CC),  which  has  been  sanctioned  by  the \nMinistry of Energy and Water (MEW), or to follow the complaints and disputes procedures outlined \nhere. \n \n3. \nArticle  10  of  Land  Acquisition  Law  provides  for  the  compensation  for  all  land  to  be \ndetermined by the Cabinet, taking into account land quality and location, and this responsibility can \nbe delegated to a ministry. In the past, this has been implemented by the Cabinet setting a range of \ncompensation  levels  for  different  classes  and  locations  of  land  with  the  CC  being  left  to  decide \nactual  amounts  for  each  individual  parcel.  Article  11  provides  for  the  assessment  of  costs  (not \nvalues)  of  buildings  for  compensation  purposes  to  be  based  on  a  table  of  building  prices  to  be \nproduced by the local authority. Landowners are permitted to salvage and remove materials from \nbuildings  in  addition  to  being  paid  compensation  or  being  supplied  with  replacement  land  and \nhousing.  The  replacement  costs  of  fruit  trees  are  to  be  decided  by  the  local  authority  and  the \nMinistry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Food (MAAHF). \n \n4. \nThe  Land  Acquisition  Law  makes  no  specific  provision  for  restoration  of  income  of  for \ncompensation for temporary use of land, yet the law does not appear to preclude the Government \nfrom  recognizing  and  making  compensation  or  rehabilitation  payments  for  additional  eligibilities. \nThe Land Acquisition Law makes no provision for compensation or rehabilitation assistance being \npaid to squatters or those without legal ownership documentation. However, it does not define legal \nownership  documents.  In  Afghanistan,  unregistered  written  deeds  of  sale  and  purchase  of  land \nhave been the most common form of ownership documentation for over 50 years and have come to  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n51\n\nbe accepted by the courts and land administration officials if they are supported by testimony. Other \nrecognized  documents  are  unregistered  wills  or  statements  from  neighbors  and  elders  of  the \nrelevant  village  or  town  that  the  purported  owner  has  inherited  the  land  in  accordance  with  the \nShari\u2019a law. Water rights allocations recorded by MEW in Herat and records of land tax payments in \nrespect  of  unregistered  land  held  by  the  Taxation  Department  are  also  accepted  as  evidence  of \nland ownership.  \n \n5. \nAs a result of the foregoing, the law will need to be supplemented in each resettlement plan \nby making provision for compensation to be paid to all occupants of land or replacement land to be \nmade  available.  Rehabilitation  assistance  must  also  be  made  available  to  all  those  affected  in \naccordance  with  the  entitlement  matrix  regardless  of  the  legality  of  their  occupation  of  land \n(Supplementary Appendix C. As the capacity among local officials in all departments in the project \narea to carry out the implementation of resettlement plans is limited, the project management unit \n(PMU) and consultants will train local officials involved with implementation of the Project. \n \n\n2. \n\nLand Ownership   \n\nAs  noted,  land  ownership  and  leasehold  tenures  are  sometimes  not  evidenced  by \n6. \nregistered  legal  documents,  accepted  methods  of  establishing  ownership  will  enable  the  actual \nownership and lawful occupation of any affected land to be established. Time and effort in following \nalternative procedures to confirm actual ownership and lawful occupation of land and buildings will \nbe accommodated in the time frames prescribed in each resettlement plan. The CC and PMU will \nensure  that  sufficient  resources  are  available  to  assist  those  affected,  who  may  not  have  official \nlegal  documents  of  ownership  for  all  or  part  of  their  affected  land,  to  prepare  whatever  other \nevidence of ownership may be available to them. \n \n\n3. \n\nEntitlements \n\n7. \nCompensation, rehabilitation assistance, and other allowances for losses are shown in the \nentitlement matrix. To ensure that compensation rates are equivalent to current replacement costs, \nthe headman, representatives of those affected, and other district officials must be consulted by the \nCC and the PMU before deciding compensation. Current market prices for property will be used. \n \nB. \n\nImplementation \n\n1. \n\nPreparation of Subproject Resettlement Plans \n\n8. \nSubproject  Preparation  Identification.  The  initial  social  assessment  (ISA)  carried  out \nduring the identification stage will determine the expected resettlement impact for each subproject. \nScoping  and  preparation  for  land  acquisition,  compensation,  and  resettlement  and  rehabilitation \nassistance  will  be  part  of  the  ISA.  The  following  defines  the  procedures:  (i)  Based  on  the \npreliminary subproject design, identify the impact class of the subproject: (a) no project impacts; (b) \nnonsignificant  project  impacts,  including  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  that  are  deemed \nsignificant  but  still  require  a  short  resettlement  plan;  and  (c)  significant  project  impacts\u2014200  or \nmore  persons  will  be  physically  displaced  for  housing  or  lose  more  than  10%  of  their  productive \nassets  (income  generating).  (ii)  In  further  refining  of  the  subproject  physical  design,  consultation \nmust be undertaken with potential officials representing those affected, PMU, and MEW to avoid or \nminimize  adverse  project  affects  as  much  as  possible.  (iii)  In  the  case  or  impacts,  carry  out  a \nsocioeconomic  survey  of  potential  people  affected  as  part  of  the  ISA.  This  should  include  the \nsocioeconomic  data  of  those  affected  and  measurement  of  type  and  level  of  loss.  The  follow-up \ncensus  survey  carried  out  after  detail  designs  are  available  will  establish  the  cut-off  date  for  the \neligibility of entitlement. It must be carried out with representation of relevant local authorities. (iv) In \nparallel  with  the  census  survey  of  people  affected,  consultation  must  be  continued  with  those \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\naffected  to  identify  their  preferences  and  any  special  needs  that  the  resettlement  plan  needs  to \naddress.  In  addition,  information  on  market  prices  for  land,  crops,  and  other  assets  must  be \ncollected.  (v)  Prepare  a  resettlement  plan  (a  short  plan  would  be  prepared  in  the  case  of  a \nsubproject  with  nonsignificant  impact  and  a  full  plan  for  a  project  with  significant  impacts).  The \nentitlement  matrix  must be used for  each subproject by specifying in detail the number of people \naffected, area of land affected, number of other assets affected, and compensation amount for each \ncategory.  Resettlement  plans  should  include  an  inventory  of  those  affected  and  a  list  of  their \nentitlements, and other relevant detailed information. (vi) Present the draft resettlement plan at the \npublic  meeting  for  the  subproject.  Any  comments  made  during  the  meeting  must  be  documented \nand addressed or incorporated in the draft resettlement plan. \n \n9. \nSubproject Appraisal. The two principal issues to be addressed in the assessment of each \nsubproject are (i) whether or not, at the public hearing on the subproject proposal, the subproject \nwas  shown  to  have  no  significant  negative  social  impact  and  the  meeting  accepted  this;  and  (ii) \nwhether or not adequate measures have been set out in the subproject feasibility study to prevent \nor resolve any impact or conflict identified. If either the short or full resettlement plan is prepared, it \nmust  be  submitted  to  the  PMU  and  MEW  as  part  of  the  social  assessment,  together  with  other \nstudies carried out for the subproject. All resettlement plans and associated reports will be sent to \nADB  for  review  and  approval.  If  the  ISA  and  resettlement  survey  for  subprojects  identify  new \ncategories of affected people and types of loss not represented in the entitlement matrix, it will be \nrevised accordingly by the PMU and CC and approved by MEW and ADB. \n \n\n2. \n\nOrganizational Framework for Implementation of Resettlement Plans  \n\n10.  MEW  will  establish  a  project  implementation  committee  (PIC),  which  will  have  overall \nresponsibility for executing resettlement plans and the payment of compensation and rehabilitation \nassistance by the CC to all those affected. However, the PMU will be responsible for oversight of \nsubproject  resettlement  plans  and  implementing  and  monitoring  day-to-day  activities  including \ncoordination  with  civil  works,  financial  management  regarding  resettlement,  and  reporting  to  the \nPIC. The PMU will contract suitable individuals, firms, or nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to \ncarry  out  the  preparation  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  of  any  resettlement  plan.  The \nProject will support an input from an international resettlement specialist to recruit local assistance \nto  execute  resettlement  activities  and  refine  resettlement  procedures.  The  PMU  will  work  closely \nwith local authorities in preparing, implementing, and monitoring all land acquisition, compensation, \nand  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  assistance  work.  MEW  in  Herat  will  work  with  the  PMU  to  (i) \nprepare the resettlement plan and its budget; (ii) establish CCs; and (iii) issue guidelines to mitigate \nadverse  project  affects,  including  land  acquisition,  compensation,  structures,  crops  and  other \nassets, resettlement activities, and rehabilitation assistance. The PIC will designate representatives \nfor the CC, identify and retain needed NGO support, and establish all necessary procedures within \n8 months of loan effectiveness. \n \nCompensation  Committee.  A  CC  will  be  established  for  each  subproject  that  includes \n11. \nresettlement,  and  will  include  representatives  from  the  district  governor\u2019s  office  (preferable  the \ndistrict governor or deputy district governor), the village headmen, two representatives from the PIC \nincluding  one  of  whom  is  a  representative  of  the  provincial  governors  office;  a  mirab1,  or  other \ncommunity  irrigation  official;  those  affected;  and  the  PMU.  In  subprojects  where  more  than  one \nvillage  is  involved  in  resettlement  activities,  a  separate  CC  should  be  created  for  each  village \nalthough representation from the district, PIC, and PMU may be the same. The district governor's \n\n                                                 \n1   Mirabs are the traditionally selected community members who are responsible for the management and operations \n\nand maintenance of the irrigation systems. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n53\n\noffice will chair the compensation committee.  A standing CC can  be  established in  each  relevant \ndistrict  comprising  all  of  the  above-listed  members  except  the  landowner  or  representative  of  the \nlandowner concerned in each case. The same representatives of the PMU and provincial officials \nshould be members of each standing compensation committee.  \n \nPublic  Information,  Consultation,  and  Participation.  The  PMU,  in  conjunction  with \n12. \ndistrict  and  village  authorities  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  potential  people  affected  are \nproperly and timely informed of the subproject activities intended to be carried out. Information \nto  be  disseminated  should  include  the  type,  timing,  and  scope  of  work  to  be  implemented; \npotential  impacts;  bases  of  assessing  compensation;  and  rehabilitation  assistance  and \nschedules. The PMU will publish information in Dari (with an English translation to be held by \nthe  PMU  and  included  in  its  report  to  ADB)  summarizing  the  entitlements  to  compensation, \nresettlement, and rehabilitation assistance as well as the procedures for making and resolving \ncomplaints  and  disputes.  The  PMU  will  distribute  the  information  to  all  potentially  affected \npeople  and  to  relevant  provincial  and  district  officials  for  their  information  and  use.  Using  the \ninformation,  the  PMU  will  ensure  that  all  entitlements  and  provisions  for  resolving  complaints \nand disputes are effectively disclosed to and carefully discussed with potential affected people \nincluding (i) entitlements to compensation, (ii) resettlement rehabilitation assistance as well as \nthe system and procedures for making complaints, (iii) initiating disputes, and (iv) obtaining fair \nand impartial consideration and resolution of such issues. \n \n13. \nInformation dissemination will be assisted by the use of posters in public places, government \noffices,  shops,  and  other  places  frequented  by  potential  people  affected.  Public  and  small  group \nmeetings will be the most important feature of the information dissemination process due to the high \nlevel of illiteracy in the subproject areas. During the subproject feasibility ISA, extensive meetings with \npotentially  affected  communities  will  be  carried  out  to  identify  their  needs  and  preferences  for \ncompensation  and  rehabilitation  and  incorporated  into  the  final  resettlement  plan  if  feasible. \nConsultations  with  key  stakeholders  during  the  ISA  will  ensure  a  general  understanding  among \npeople potentially affected regarding the principles of compensation and rehabilitation. Resettlement \nplans and the framework will be disclosed and information made available in accordance with ADB\u2019s \npublic communications policy effective 1 September 2005. \n \nGrievances  and  Disputes.  ADB  policy  mandates  that  grievance  redress  mechanisms  for \n14. \naffected  people  are  to  be  established  under  the  resettlement  plan  unless  sufficient  procedures  are \navailable under the current law. Where those affected are a vulnerable group, resettlement planning \ndecisions  must  be  preceded  by  a  social  preparation  phase  to  enhance  their  participation  in \nnegotiation,  planning,  and  implementation.  Mechanisms  for  resolving  grievances  are  either  local \ncommittees  established  for  that  purpose  or  existing  formal  avenues  of  complaint  to  superior \nauthorities or to the courts. Under the Project, an affected person may make a grievance to the village \nheadman, or to the office of the provincial or district governor, the PMU, or MEW verbally or in written \nform.  A  meeting  to  address  the  grievance  will  be  convened  between  the  person  and  a  grievance \nredress committee that will comprise the district governor offices, village headman, mirab, and other \nrepresentatives from the CC present as observers. A representative from the PMU and MEW must be \npresent to cooperate with the grievance redress committee by providing all relevant information and \nto ensure impartial consideration of the grievance. If the grievance redress committee cannot address \nthe person\u2019s concerns to his or her satisfaction within 3 weeks from the receipt of the grievance, the \nmatter can be taken to the district court or the provincial governor or deputy governor. If an application \nis made to the district court and satisfactory resolution is not achieved, the next level of appeal must \nbe the provincial court; not the provincial governor\u2019s office. \n \n15. \nThe district and provincial hearings of applications and disputes are of an inquisitorial nature \nas opposed to purely adversarial proceedings. Appeals from district courts are heard anew with any \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nadditional  evidence  or  arguments  being  considered.  Affected  people  will  be  exempted  from  all \nadministrative  and  legal  fees  incurred  in  pursuing  grievances  under  the  grievance  redress \nprocedure. If such fees are payable by law or regulation then they are to be met by the PMU as part \nof the costs of implementing the resettlement plan.  \n \nImplementation.  Detailed  schedules  for  resettlement  implementation  will  be  included  as \n16. \npart of the resettlement plan and specific tasks will be enumerated with timelines. The time frame \nmay vary depending on the scope of impact and the number of people affected. \n \nBudget and Support. Although resettlement compensation is not widely envisioned under \n17. \nthe Project, $225,000, about 0.6% of the estimated total cost of civil works, has been budgeted as \nthe  provision  for  compensation  that  the  Government  may  need  to  pay  for  compensation.  The \nProject  is  has  also  set  aside  money  to  support  consultants  and  NGOs  to  support  preparation  of \nresettlement plans and M&E. The PMU and compensation committee must ensure that the costs of \nland  acquisition  compensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  assistance  are  included  in  the \noverall  subproject  cost  estimate  and  its  periodic  plans  are  presented  to  the  PIC  and  MEW. \nRehabilitation  assistance,  survey,  staff  training,  and  external  monitoring  may  be  financed  by  the \nproject funds with ADB approval.  \n \n\n3. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n18.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  The  PMU  with  the  assistance  of  consultants,  NGOs,  and  in \ncollaboration  with  CCs  will  oversee  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  resettlement  plans.  The \nPMU  will  supervise  the  compensation,  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  assistance,  and  prepare \nmonthly  monitoring  reports  throughout  preparation  and  execution  of  the  resettlement  plan  and \ninclude their findings in its quarterly progress reporting. If significant problems are encountered, the \nPMU will notify ADB. The PMU will prepare a standard subproject reporting to monitoring and track \nprogress  with  resettlement  plan  implementation.  In  addition  to  internal  monitoring,  the  PMU  will \nengage a qualified independent external monitor to review and evaluate the subproject resettlement \nplan implementation. The independent monitor will carry out field visits and consultation with those \naffected  with  support  and  cooperation  of  MEW,  MAAHF,  compensation  committee,  and  local \nofficials as required. Monitoring reports will be prepared bimonthly for each subproject and will be \npresented to the PIC for review and provide a basis for any necessary remedial action to ensure \neffective and timely implementation of the resettlement plan. All monitoring and evaluation reports \nwill be sent to ADB for review. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n55\n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\n \nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe Western Basins Water Resources Management Project (the Project) will operate in the \n1. \nmajor river basins in the western Afghanistan provinces of Herat, Ghowr, and Badghis. The Project \nwill target irrigation, agricultural support, and capacity building activities in about 55,000 to 65,000 \nhectares (ha) in the target basins and provide assistance to develop the capacities of stakeholders \nto manage the basins. Engineering activities will be combined with agricultural support services and \ncapacity-building  activities  aimed  at  enhancing  land  productivity  and  environmental  quality.  The \nProject  takes  a  sector  approach  to  improving  basinwide  water  resources  management  and  core \nsubproject selection. Using this approach, the Project first prepared criteria for selecting and costing \nan  initial  set  of  core  subprojects  consisting  of  existing  irrigation  systems  for  rehabilitation  and \nupgrading (R&U). \n \nB. \n\nDescription of the Project  \n\n2. \nThe  Project  consists  of  four  components:  (i)  integrated  water  resource  management,  (ii) \nwater resources and irrigation development, (iii) agricultural and livelihood services, and (iv) project \nmanagement and capacity building. The Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) is the Implementing \nAgency and the Ministry of Finance is the Executing Agency. An initial environmental examination \n(IEE) was conducted in accordance with Asian Develoment Bank (ADB) Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines.1  In  addition,  the  environmental  screening  process  followed  the  checklist  format  for \nirrigation projects set forth in ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Agricultural And Natural \nResources Development Projects.2 \n \n3. \nThe Jui Nau subproject is focused on the R&U of the Jui Nau irrigation system, and works \nshould be completed by year 3 of the Project. The Jui Nau is typical of the larger irrigation systems \nin the lower Hari Rud in terms of water supply and rehabilitation issues, and serves as an example \nof the type and range of rehabilitation measures required for these systems. It is located close to \nheart city. The principal objective of the subproject is the improvement of water availability, efficiency \nof  use,  and  equity  of  distribution  for  improved  agricultural  productivity.  It  comprises  two  principle \nelements:  (i)  development  of  canal  infrastructure  and  associated  system  management,  and  (ii) \nprovision  of  agricultural  and  livelihood  services.  In  addition  to  improved  water  management  an \nadditional  benefit  is  that  by  rehabilitating  permanent  structures,  operation  and  maintenance  costs \nwill  be  reduced.  The  area  involves  7,000  plus  stakeholder  households  with  an  average  of  seven \npeople per family. Key features of the subproject are summarized in Table A12.1. \n \n4. \nGeneral  Criteria.  The  selection  criteria  for  subprojects  evolved  during  the  course  of  the \nproject preparatory technical assistance (TA).3 The final general selection criteria are summarized \nas (i) location within the lower Hari Rud, i.e., within the principal zone of irrigation development and \nwithin the zone of water and land availability; (ii) spatial distribution of works, both on the left and \nright banks as well as in the upper and lower reaches of the lower Hari Rud; (iii) systems that can \ndemonstrate a range of irrigation and water resource works (flood protection, etc.), and associated \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2003.

Based  on  experiences  with  comparable  rehabilitation  works,  the \n5. \nProject used the following environmental criteria for scheme selection to quickly exclude subprojects \nthat are unacceptable. The following criteria will be used to exclude subprojects that would (i) result \nin  water  rights  conflicts  that  cannot  be  resolved  with  downstream  water  users,  (ii)  be  in  an  area \nwhere  unexploded  ordnance  cannot  be  cleared,  (iii)  have  adverse  environmental  impacts  and \nviolate  any  of  ADB's  environmental  safeguard  policies,  and  (iv)  have  adverse  social  effects  and \nviolate ADB's social safeguard policies. \n \n\nTable A12.2: Irrigation Subproject Initial Selection Criteria \n\nItem \n\nCriteria/Indicator \n\n1  Will the proposed subproject have a significant negative effect on other \n\nYes  No \n \n\n \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\nestablished water or land users in the watershed?    \nIs the proposed subproject clear of encroachment or negative impacts \nupon existing or proposed protected areas (parks, reserves), historical, \ncultural, or religious sites? \nIs the proposed subproject clear of encroachment or negative impacts \nupon any and all existing biodiversity sites and/or endangered species of \nflora and fauna? \nIs the proposed subproject free from any significant negative effects to \nsurface water hydrology and/or natural drainage in the area? \n\n5  Will the proposed subproject be free from any other significant negative \n\nenvironmental effects such as river basin degradation, increased silt loads, \nwater pollution, etc.? \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n     Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n57\n\nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n6. \nPrimary  data  was  collected  by  personal  observation  of  the  river,  intakes,  canals,  and \nstructures and of the areas surrounding the subproject area. Observations in the field were made \nwith international consultants, national consultants, and Government officials in order that a range of \nopinions could be obtained. Primary data was also collected from reports and field work of other TA \nconsultants. Secondary data was obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations library in Kabul, which serves as the library for MEW. Secondary data was also obtained \nfrom  aid  agency  reports,  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  reports,  and  the  internet.  Anecdotal \ndata  was  provided  through  consultations  and  interviews  with  farmers,  Government  officials,  NGO \nstaff, and stakeholders. \n \nThe lower Hari Rud River Basin surrounding the subproject area is relatively barren with little \n7. \nvegetation  outside  the  subproject  area.  Although  it  has  low  rainfall,  erosion  exists  in  some  areas \nbecause the hillsides are almost bare of vegetation and the numerous washes (intermittent, flash \nflood,  streams)  erode  the  hillsides.  High  population  growth  combined  with  high  poverty  is \naccelerating  soil  erosion,  biodiversity  loss,  water  pollution,  and  dust  storms.  The  fuel  crisis  in  the \nsubproject area has resulted in people not only cutting trees and shrubs but in digging out the root \nsystems so that there is no regrowth. The subproject area has been farmed for over 300 years.  \n \nExcept for summer sand and dust storms, the air quality is good. The climate is arid, with \n8. \ncold  winters  and  hot,  dry  summers.  The  average  rainfall  at  Herat  is  estimated  to  be  about  310 \nmillimeters. The main source of surface and groundwater in the basin is snow melt, which is spread \nover  about  2  months  (February/March\u2013April).  The  flow  in  the  Hari  Rud  and  Murghab  rivers  is \nsufficient to sustain irrigation from February through mid-June and sometimes into later months in a \ngood precipitation year.  \n \n9. \nElevations  within  the  subproject  area  average  about  1,000  meters  mean  sea  level  with \nrelatively even relief after being irrigated for over 300 years. The subproject\u2019s landform is primarily \nriver valley where the soils are deep silt loams and fine sandy loams underlain by conglomerate or \ngravel. In depressions or in areas where drainage is impeded and a high water table occurs, salinity \nproblems may occur but none were observed. Soils are low in available phosphate, nitrogen, and \norganic matter. The subproject area is geologically and seismologically stable. \n \n10. \nBiodiversity is very limited after years of conflict and severe drought, with few visible species. \nWithin the Jui Nau irrigation system, trees growing around homes and along the canals and rivers, \nprovide scattered vegetation clumps supporting some habitat for wildlife. More trees will be planted \nas wind breaks to minimize sand and dust storms.   \n \n11. \nNo mineral development or tourism facilities are within the subproject area. Outside of Herat, \nthere  is  no  electricity  grid.  Health  services  are  sparse,  with  a  doctor  to  people  ratio  of  1/6,637  in \nHerat. The subproject area has no protected areas, or cultural or historical sites. All parts of the Jui \nNau system are away from the historic city of Herat. Recently, urban expansion has encroached on \nsome  of  the  lower  reaches  of  the  main  canal.  Some  ruins  of  water  cisterns  and  bathhouses  are \nabout  150  to  300  meters  south  of  this  portion  of  the  main  canal.  These  ruins  are  not  within  the \nsubproject  area.  However,  to  ensure  that  no  buried  ruins  are  within  the  construction  zone,  the \nproject  design  requires  that  prior  to  construction  an  archeological  reconnaissance  be  made.  All \npotential environmental impacts are positive. Mobility for people and animals will be improved in the \nsubproject through the improvement of bridges.  \n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nD. \n\nForecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n12. \nThe methodology for screening subproject activities by implementation activity was done in \nconsultation  with  the  National  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (NEPA)  professionals.  Potential \nimpacts  were  initially  assessed  using  the  checklist  provided  for  irrigation  projects  in  the  ADB \nEnvironmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Agricultural  and  Natural  Resources  Development  Projects \n(Supplementary  Appendix  D).  While  conducting  the  public  consultations,  the  NEPA  professionals \nreviewed project activities and visited the project areas (except Obe because of security concerns). \nThey used the rapid environmental assessment checklist to evaluate the subproject. They found no \nsignificant impacts. The project strategy of rehabilitating and expanding existing systems to improve \nthe  reliability  of  diversions  and  efficiency  of  water  use,  combined  with  groundwater  resource \nevaluation  and  use,  and  institutional  development  is  expected  to  result  in  positive  environmental \nimpacts. \n \n13. \nPotential  Environmental  Concerns  from  Project  Location.  Possible  concerns  from \nproject  location  include  water-use  conflicts  and  quality  deterioration  in  areas  of  water  scarcity, \nparticularly in the dry season. However, an analysis of groundwater recharge and of its return to the \nriver  that  will  result  from  the  increase  in  water  diverted  indicates  that  the  gross  volume  of  water \navailable downriver  of Jui  Nau  through  groundwater seepage  into the river  will increase  by  about \n44%,  thus  reducing  water  scarcity  and  conflicts.  Groundwater  activities  will  be  monitored  by  the \nenvironmental  monitoring  unit.  Unexploded  ordnance  and  land  mines  are  concerns  throughout \nAfghanistan,  yet  in  the  case  of  the  Jui  Nau,  these  do  not  appear  to  pose  threats.4  No  negative \nimpacts are related to the location.  \n \nPotential Environmental Concerns from Project Design. Design considerations relate to \n14. \nensuring  that  structures  are  designed  for  ease  of  farmer  operation.  This  has  been  ensured  with \nappropriate  design  standards.  Ease  of  use  will  be  monitored  by  the  Project\u2019s  environmental \nmonitoring unit and MEW. Thus no negative impacts are due to project design.  \n \n15. \nPotential  Environmental  Concerns  from  Project  Construction.  Temporary  negative \nimpacts are related to noise, dust, silt, and temporary interference with irrigation. This latter concern \nwill be mitigated by scheduling construction in the off-season. When closing a canal is necessary, \nfarmers  have  agreed  to  dig  temporary  canals.  All  construction  contracts  will  require  qualified \npersonnel  and  proper  equipment,  and  organization  to  ensure  the  implementation  of  good \nengineering  practices  and  the  use  environment-friendly  products.  Thus  no  long  term  negative \nimpacts are due to project construction. \n \n16. \nPotential Environmental Concerns from Project Operations. Water and soil quality may \nbe affected as a result of using more agrichemicals in selected subprojects. The potential negative \neffects  will  be  ameliorated  by  extension  and  awareness  services  provided  by  the  Project  and  the \nMinistry  of  Agriculture,  Animal  Husbandry,  and  Food.  Given  that  each  subproject  is  small  and \nconfined to existing agricultural lands, cumulative impacts will be small. The Project is not anticpated \nto result in any major downstream impacts. \n \n\n                                                 \n4   In areas where unexploded ordnance or mines are perceived to cause a threat, the Government will be responsible \n\nfor securing the area before any project activities can take place. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n59\n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan  \n\n17.  Methodology.  All  relevant  laws,  regulations,  and  pending  legislation  will  need  to  be \nreviewed.  During  this  review,  consultations  and  interviews  with  relevant  Government  agencies, \ninternational  organizations,  NGOs,  and  individuals  will  be  held  to  obtain  a  range  of  ideas  and  to \nobtain  additional  source  material.  After  the  legislative,  regulatory,  and  source  material  review  is \ncomplete, a second set of meetings should be held to discuss the knowledge gained. \n \nBased  on  the  IEEs,  stakeholder  consultation,  and  the  ADB  and  NEPA  guidelines  and \n18. \nrequirements,  a  project-specific  set  of  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  were \nprepared. An environmental management plan (EMP) was prepared to ensure that the Project has \nno  future  significant  negative  environmental  problems.  The  plan  is  an  intrinsic  part  of  all  project \ncomponents.  Initially,  the  EMP  will  focus  on  monitoring  water  quantity,  soil  and  water  quality, \nconstruction activities, and biodiversity as a function of land cover. As implementation proceeds the \nEMP will be refined, based on public consultations, ongoing data collection, and the monitoring of \ndesigns  and  construction  activities.  Satellite imagery  will  be used  to  monitor land use and  hillside \nerosion. The EMP will also provide training. In the case of the Jui Nau subproject about $10,470 is \nprovided  for  environmental  management  to  cover  the  costs  of  IEE  and  planning  activities  31.2%, \nmitigation management and training 14.9%, consultants 27.5%, and equipment 26.4%. (a draft EMP \nis presented with the IEE in Supplementary Appendix D, and environmental assessment and review \nprocedures are included in Supplementary Appendix E). \n \n19. \nInitially soil and water samples will be taken at larger than 2,000 ha subproject intakes and \nat no less than one canal tail within the system. The sampling network will be refined as knowledge \nis  gained  about  the  spatial  variation  of  environmental  variables.  Environmental  activities  will  be \ndescribed in project reports and specific reports will be prepared for sampling results and training \nactivities. IEs and a summary IEE will be reported. The Project will have an ongoing series of new \nsubprojects, MEW officials supported by project staff will prepare an IEE for each. To assist these \nlocal  officials  and  staff  to  prepare  the  IEEs  and  to  undertake  the  EMP,  the  Project  will  field  an \nenvironment specialist for 12 person-months over the first 4 years of the Project. The specialist will \nbe  responsible  for  building  local  capacity,  working  with  Herat  officials  and  staff  to  design \nenvironmental studies and the M&E program, use and refining subproject environmental screening \ncriteria; and conducting IEEs for proposed subprojects. \n \n20. \nEnvironmental  monitoring  is  integrated  into  the  project  monitoring  and  evaluation  program \nand will be put into effect by the project environmental unit staff with consultant support. The Project \nhas over $400,000 to support environmental activities and ensure monitoring and any mitigation is \nadequate. Monitoring is necessary to ensure that (i) the quality of water resources is not degraded, \nand  (ii)  the  quantity  of  water  available  to  tail  end  users  within  systems  and  to  down  river  users \nbetween  systems  is  not  decreased.  Resource  requirements  and  costs  include  the  provision  for \nNEPA and for local staff to prepare IEE\u2019s in project years 4 through 7. \n \nF. \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\nStakeholder consultations were conducted individually and jointly by the TA team members \n21. \nincluding  the  on-farm  irrigation  engineer,  irrigation  engineer,  gender  specialist,  watershed \nmanagement  specialist,  and  social  specialist  and  were  held  at  subproject,  district,  and  national \nlevels. After the completion of the draft final report and its presentation in Kabul, a final series of on-\nsite subproject public consultations were conducted by the project environmental specialist and the \ntwo  NEPA  officials.  Stakeholders  were  notified  1  week  in  advance  with  written  invitations  sent  to \nrelevant  NGOs.  These  consultations  were  held  at  the  district  headquarters  of  Injil  District  for \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nstakeholders from the Jui Nau on 26 June 2005. The proceedings of the consultation in Injil for the \nJui Nau were videotaped and televised on Herat television\u2019s evening news. This informed a larger \naudience about proposed project activities. \n \nThe  issues  raised  were  the  (i)  project  objectives;  (ii)  types  of  rehabilitation  for  each \n22. \nsubproject  and  the  associated  extension  activities;  (iii)  potential  environmental  impacts,  especially \nthose related to downstream water use and historic structures; (iv) proposed strengthening of the \nmirab system;  and  (v)  proposed  mitigation  measures.  The  attending  stakeholders  were  asked  for \ntheir views and opinions. They raised no additional environmental considerations and indicated that \nthey did not consider the environmental issues discussed to be problems. They were unanimous in \nfavoring  the  interventions.  Information  on  the  number  and  categories  of  stakeholders  present  are \npresented  in  the  IEE  (Supplementary  Appendix  D).  Project  staff  will  undertake  future  public \nconsultations and disclosures. These will describe and discuss project components and activities, \nincluding  the  potential  to  improve  soil  and  water  conditions  in  the  project  areas.  The  first  formal \nconsultations are to take place before the design phase. \n \nG. \n\nConclusions \n\n23. \nThe  IEEs  find  that  the  Project  provides  for  environment-friendly  irrigation  interventions \nand  contributes  to  improving  living  conditions.  The  findings  of  this  IEE  are  that  a  follow-up \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  or  further  detailed  environmental  impact  study  is  not \nrequired. The identified potential adverse effects will be addressed through proper site location, \nplanning,  design,  implementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance,  while  incorporating \nmitigation measures. The screening of future subprojects will be done in accordance with NEPA \nregulations  and  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures.  Monitoring  will  be \ncarried out throughout the subproject life to ensure that the guidelines are adhered to and that \nadequate  capacity  development  is  provided  for  all  stakeholders.  Although  an  environmental \nimpact  assessment  is  not  necessary,  the  fielding  of  an  environmental  specialist  is  required  to \nprovide  support  to  the  project  environmental  monitoring  unit,  assist  with  the  environmental \nscreening of future subprojects and the preparation of the required IEEs, and train communities \nin the early detection of environmental degradation. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 24 November 2005) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "Afghanistan Afghani (AF) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "AF1.00\n$1.00\n", "$ 0.0234 \nAF42.79 \n", " \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB  \nADF \nBWC \nEIRR \nEMP \nICB  \nIEE  \nISA \nIWRM  \nLCB  \nM&E  \nMAAHF \nMEW   \nMMI  \nMOF \nMRRD \nNEPA \nNGO \nO&M  \nOFWM \nPIC \nPMU \nPSC \nR&U  \nRBA  \nTA  \nUNDP \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank  \nAsian Development Fund \nbasin water committee \neconomic internal rate of return  \nenvironmental management plan \ninternational competitive bidding  \ninitial environmental examination  \ninitial social assessment \nintegrated water resource management \nlocal competitive bidding  \nmonitoring and evaluation  \nMinistry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Food \nMinistry of Energy and Water \nMinistry of Mines and Industry  \nMinistry of Finance \nMinistry of Rural Reconstruction and Development \nNational Environmental Protection Agency \nnongovernment organization  \noperation and maintenance  \non-farm water management \nproject implementation committee \nproject management unit \nproject steering committee \nrehabilitation and upgrading \nriver basin authority \ntechnical assistance  \nUnited Nations Development Programme \n", "NOTES \n", "The fiscal year of the Government ends on 31 March. \n In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n \n", " \n", "Vice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam member \n", "L.
