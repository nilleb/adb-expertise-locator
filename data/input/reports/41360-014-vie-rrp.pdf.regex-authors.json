I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for subprogram 2 of the Second Small and \nMedium-Sized Enterprises Development Program. 1  \n \n2.  Subprogram 2 seeks to assist the government in achieving sustainable high economic \ngrowth in Viet Nam by supporting the development and competitiveness of small and medium-\nsized  enterprises  (SMEs).  Subprogram  2  will  support  the  government\u2019s  reform  efforts  by  \n(i)  enhancing  the  policy  and  planning  framework  for  SME  development,  (ii)  improving  the \nefficiency  of  administrative  systems  in  support  of  SME  development  and  operations,  \n(iii)  strengthening  the regulatory framework for  competition  policy,  and  (iv)  enhancing  SME \naccess to finance.2 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Increasing contribution to economic growth. Healthy levels of private investment will \ncontinue to be essential to achieve the 7%\u20138% rate of annual economic growth and the 8 million \nnew  jobs  targeted  under  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Strategy,  2011\u20132020. \nIncreasingly, such contribution is expected to come from the domestic private sector, largely \ncomposed of SMEs.3The government has assisted the development of SMEs with a combination \nof  landmark  policy  reforms  since  2000.  As  a  result,  by  the  end  of  2011,  nearly  550,000 \nenterprises were registered in Viet Nam, up from 14,500 in 2000. SMEs represented 97% of the \ncountry\u2019s total number of firms, and 46% of gross domestic product (GDP). The domestic private \nsector accounted for 59% of total employment in 2011, up from 29% in 2000. By industry, the \nwholesale and retail, and vehicle repair subsectors account for nearly 40% of active enterprises, \nfollowed by manufacturing (18%) and construction (16%).   \n  \n4.  The large increase in the number of private sector companies since the approval of the \nEnterprise Law in 2000 has been followed by sustained increases in the average dimension and \nproductivity of the firms.4 From 2000 to 2010, the average capital per firm increased sixfold, and \nthe average net revenue per employee tripled. In addition, the contribution of SMEs to tax \nrevenue has become increasingly important. By the end of 2010, of the 336,000 enterprises \npaying taxes in Viet Nam, of which 318,000 were private enterprises, 13,000 were foreign-owned \nenterprises and about 5,000 were state-owned enterprises (SOEs).5 While the government\u2019s \nachievements are impressive, more needs to be done to foster greater SME development. SMEs \nface challenges from a variety of sources including a complex bureaucracy, regulatory hurdles, \nand lack of financing. ADB continued commitment to financial sector and SOE reforms address \nsome of the key remaining challenges to private sector (see para. 28). \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to Viet Nam for Supporting the Second Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises \nDevelopment Program. Manila (TA 8184-VIE). The technical assistance provides support to the implementation of \nthe post-program partnership framework agreed with the government. \n3  According to Viet Nam\u2019s definition (Decree 56/2009), SMEs comprise all companies with less than D100 billion \n($5 million) chartered capital and 10\u2013300 workers. For the trade and services sector, the thresholds are lower           \n(10\u2013100 employees, and less than D50 billion in capital). \n4  The government aims to increase the number of operating SMEs to 600,000 by 31 December 2015 and over the \n5-year period, SMEs are expected to create 3.5\u20134.0 million jobs. \n5  Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2012. White Paper on Small and Medium Sized Enterprises in Viet Nam 2011. \nHa Noi. ", "2 \n5.   Improving stakeholder dialogue and the statistical base for policy formulation. The \ninvolvement of the private sector and other relevant stakeholders in designing and executing \nSME policies has been inadequate as the existing consultative framework is limited and largely \nad hoc. Stakeholders\u2019 participation in the evaluation of past policies, the formulation of new \nstrategic plans, and the improvement of the statistical base for policy formulation has been \nlimited until the publication of the first SME White Paper in 2011.  \n \n6.   Simplifying administrative procedures. Although great progress has been achieved \nsince 2000 in simplifying administrative procedures for the registration of enterprises, important \nadministrative  burdens  remain.  The  total  number  of  regulations  in  Viet Nam  that  affect \nbusinesses  increased  dramatically  from  2005  to  2009.  As  a  result, the  government  started \nimplementation  of  Project  30,  specifically  aimed  at  the  simplification  of  close  to  4,800 \nadministrative  procedures  at  the  national  and  local  levels  of  business  operations.6  The \nsimplification  of  administrative  procedures  has  been  shown  to  particularly  benefit  women \nentrepreneurs with lower average skills, representing a critical gender mainstreaming strategy.   \n \n7.   Reducing  tax  and  compliance  costs.  The  administrative  burden  imposed  on \nbusinesses translates into high tax compliance costs. On average, a company has to spend \n941 hours per year complying with tax payments, which ranks Viet Nam 138 out of 183 countries \nin the Doing Business Report 2013.7 In addition, despite recent improvements, the number of \ndocuments required to process imports in Viet Nam is still above regional averages and the cost \nto import goods has steadily increased. Until 2012, private businesses have been submitting \nmonthly value-added tax (VAT) declarations. Filing customs declarations could take close to a \nday as the declarations have to be handed in personally. In addition, inadequate communication \nbetween  the  Treasury  and  commercial  banks  prevents  the  prompt  release  of  goods  from \ncustoms after dues have been paid. \n \n8.  Improving the quality of legal texts and SME access to legal services. A large \nnumber  of  regulations  for  business  development  currently  being  applied  contain  numerous \ninconsistencies. Further, clear guidance for the preparation of regulatory impact assessments \n(RIAs) is required to better identify the benefits and costs associated with the enactment of \nproposed regulations, and to filter out inefficient or rent-seeking practices. Increasingly, SMEs \nhave  been  highlighting  limited  access  to  legal  services  as  an  important  constraint  to  their \ndevelopment.  \n \n9.  Review of the 5-year-old competition policy framework required. The framework \nexhibits weaknesses in the indicators used to identify dominant market position, and the system \nof penalties and enforcement measures are not strong enough to stop violations effectively. \nViet Nam\u2019s experience with the full application of the Competition Law, 2005 is limited, thus \noutreach and education are key priorities. In addition, the Enterprise Law, 2005 requires the \nincorporation of critical underdeveloped provisions, such as corporate governance practices and \nelimination of limitations  on registration of foreign businesses. Improvements to competition \npolicy will assist in increasing the average size of SMEs, which has been shown to assist female \nemployment growth. 8  \n                                                \n6  Master Plan to Simplify Administrative Procedures in the fields of State Governance for 2007\u20132010 (Project 30). \n7  World Bank. 2013. Doing Business Report 2013: Smarter Regulations for Small and Medium-Size Enterprises. \nWashington DC. \n8  Women represented 43% of the labor force in medium-sized enterprises, and 40% in small enterprises (Central \nInstitute for Economic Management (CIEM). 2013. Characteristics of the Vietnamese Business Environment. \nHa Noi).  \n ", "  3 \n10.  Limited access to capital. The rapid growth of Viet Nam\u2019s financial sector has not \nbenefited all segments of the economy equally. In fact, access to finance continues to be cited as \na major constraint for 45% of small firms, a percentage significantly higher than for larger \nenterprises. A government survey reports that 65% of enterprises in the manufacturing sector \ndepend on retained earnings to finance investment, with a very small group, estimated at 5%\u2013\n10% of SMEs, obtaining credit from banks. Women entrepreneurs represented 34% of the loan \napplications in 2009, and continue to face greater limitations in access to credit in the absence of \nland use certificates. Overall, the SME sector accounts for about 30% of total credit as of the end \nof 2012, which is relatively low compared with its GDP contribution of 46%. Compounding the \ntraditional challenges in obtaining and using collateral, the current regulatory framework limits \nnoncollateral forms of debt financing such as leasing.  \n \n11.   The government\u2019s reform agenda. Eliminating constraints for the further development \nof the SME sector remains a key pillar of the Socio-Economic Development Strategy, 2011\u2013\n2020,  and  the  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (SEDP),  2011\u20132015.  The  government\u2019s \nstrategic policy framework for SME development is contained in the Small and Medium-Sized \nDevelopment Plan, 2011\u20132015. SME growth continues to be critical to overcome the structural \ngrowth limitations created by the predominance of SOEs in Viet Nam\u2019s economy. SOEs still \ncapture a priority share of available financial resources for  investment from public sources, \ndespite evidence of low returns on capital and modest employment creation. The potential of the \nSME sector for employment creation suggests the need to assist improved access to finance and \nland, while continuously improving the regulatory framework for their operations. In addition, \nfuture productivity growth in Viet Nam will largely depend on the technological and skills upgrade \nof the domestic private sector.    \n \n12.   Reform sequence. Subprogram 1 supported the implementation of numerous milestones \nin strategic policy reforms for SME development such as the publication of the White Paper on \nSmall and Medium Sized Enterprises in Viet Nam 2011, which was the basis for formulation of \nthe SME Development Plan, 2011\u20132015 in subprogram 2. Subprogram 1 provided support to the \nissuance of Decree 56/2009, which redefined the government\u2019s support for SME development \nand identified the roles of government agencies in implementing SME development policies. In \nsubprogram 2, key provisions of the decree have been supported, such as initiatives for the \nprovision of legal services for SMEs. Subprogram 1 also supported the establishment of a \nnational  web-based  system  for  business  registration,  while  subprogram  2  assisted  its \nimplementation at the provincial level and its integration with tax information systems. With a \nview toward improving access to finance, subprogram 1 supported the establishment of the \ncredit guarantee scheme within Viet Nam Development Bank (VDB), and the issuance of initial \nregulations  governing  leasing  and  equity  finance  options  through  the  market  for  unlisted \ncompanies in Ha Noi Stock Exchange (HNX). Under subprogram 2, the government improved \nthe credit guarantee scheme to ensure a more efficient distribution of credit risk, and integrated \nleasing practices into the Law on Credit Institutions, 2010 lending it consistency. Since the start \nof Asian Development Bank (ADB) support to SME development in Viet Nam, over 300,000 new \nenterprises have been registered, contributing some 60% of total private sector employment in \n2012 (from 53% in 2007). Partly as a result of the new national web-based business registration \nsystem, the cost of starting a business has been reduced by almost 10% since 2007, and the \ndays required to process a business application have been reduced by 30%. The share of SMEs \nin outstanding loans from commercial banks has almost doubled from 15% to nearly 30% in \n2012, and their contribution to investment is now close to 65% of the total. \n \n13.   Lessons.  ADB  has  provided  direct  assistance  to  the  government  to  support  SME  \n ", "4 \ndevelopment through a combination  of  policy-based cluster loan and technical assistance.9  An \nimportant lesson learned is that SME development will largely depend on a series of parallel \nreforms in the country\u2019s financial and economic structure.  In recognition of this fact, ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2012\u20132015 and the country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014 \nidentify private sector development as a key priority for sustainable and inclusive economic \ngrowth.10 Within this framework, ADB has been supporting economic reforms and private sector \ndevelopment through a number of programs focused on SOE restructuring, development of \nmicrofinance, and financial sector reforms. Continued support and engagement in these sectors \nwill be essential to continuing progress in the SME sector. ADB loans have been processed as \nclusters to ensure a medium-term focus, while reforms have been consistently assisted through \nregular technical assistance.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.   The impact of subprogram 2 will be to increase the contribution of SMEs and the private \nsector  in  achieving  sustainable  high  economic  growth.  The  outcome  will  be  an  improved \nbusiness environment to support more competitive SMEs and the private sector. Subprogram 2 \nincludes 32 reform actions (11 policy triggers and 21 milestones) that the government completed \nfrom 2010 to 2013. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  Subprogram 2 is structured around four major outputs covering key areas of reform: \n(i) enhancing  the  policy  and  planning  framework  for  SME  development,  (ii)  improving  the \nefficiency  of  administrative  systems  in  support  of  SME  development  and  operations,  \n(iii)  strengthening  the regulatory framework for  competition  policy,  and  (iv)  enhancing  SME \naccess  to  finance.  The  reform  actions  defined  for  subprogram  2  are  drawn  from  strategic \nplanning documents including the SEDP, 2011\u20132015, and have been widely discussed with the \ngovernment agencies and other relevant stakeholders. In addition to the policy triggers agreed \nfor subprogram 2, progress has been achieved in areas initially not covered in the policy matrix \nbut of critical importance for SME development. These include progress on the simplification of \nadministrative procedures, measures aimed at reducing tax compliance costs of SMEs, and \npreparation  of  the  first  draft  of  the  amendments  to  the  Enterprise  Law,  2005.  In  addition, \nprogress toward amendment of the Competition Law is reflected in the policy matrix.  \n \n1.  Enhancing the Policy and Planning Framework for SME Development \n \n16.  The government, through the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), has continued to \nimprove  the  policy  and  planning  framework  for  SME  development,  while  furthering  the \nmainstreaming of gender issues. The government issued the SEDP, 2011\u20132015 and launched \nspecific programs to support the development of female entrepreneurs\u2019 skills. The government \nconducted regular consultations during the formulation of subprogram 2 with a wide range of \nstakeholders, including representatives from women entrepreneurs. The government has also \nimproved the statistical base for SME policy formulation and  now publishes size-disaggregated \ndata on SMEs, as well as SME sex-disaggregated data by relevant categories. \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2004.

Improving the Efficiency of Administrative Systems in Support of SME \nDevelopment and Operations  \n \n17.  The  government  has  accomplished  a  substantial  simplification  of  administrative \nprocedures affecting private sector operations. It has established the Administrative Procedures \nControl Agency (APCA) as a permanent agency under Decision 74/2010 with a mandate to \nreview, simplify, and ensure consistency within the administrative procedures of all government \nagencies at both national and provincial levels. The APCA has coordinated with the relevant \nministries and government agencies to simplify administrative procedures affecting businesses at \nnational and provincial levels. As a result of these sustained efforts, the Prime Minister has \nratified 25 resolutions that will allow the simplification of 4,800 administrative procedures. Under \nthis initiative, 3,800 administrative procedures have already been simplified. Progress in this area \nhas been reflected in a new trigger in the policy matrix. In addition, the APCA has conducted \nRIAs of 2,800 of these 4,800 administrative procedures.  \n \n18.  The government has improved the efficiency of the national business registration system \nby intensifying efforts to build the capacity of provincial business registration offices. In addition, \nit has further simplified business registration procedures by establishing the legal validity of web-\nbased registrations, and streamlined the issuance of enterprise codes. These codes are unique \nto each business entity and are used for both business and tax purposes. \n \n19.  With the approval of the Medium Term Plan for Customs Modernization, 2011\u20132015 by \nthe  Prime  Minister,  the  government  continues  to  simplify  the  tax  and  customs  procedures \napplicable to SMEs, thereby reducing their compliance costs. The Customs General Department \nunder  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  is  leading  the  implementation  of  the  \ne-customs system for commercial imports and exports. The implementation of e-filing reduces \nthe time to file a customs declaration from up to a full day to just minutes. Important progress has \nalso been achieved in the simplification of the tax payment system for customs through Decision \n85/2011. This allows for speedy release of goods from customs via a pilot program wherein the \npayment  of  duties  is  coursed  through  commercial  banks  and  reported  to  the  Treasury \nDepartment by way of an enhanced information exchange system.  \n \n20.  The government, through amendment to the Law on Tax Administration, 2006 has also \nachieved a comparable reduction in tax compliance costs for SMEs by limiting the frequency of \nVAT declarations from a monthly to quarterly basis. This important progress has been reflected \nin a new trigger in the policy matrix.   \n \n3.  Strengthening the Regulatory Framework for Competition Policy \n \n21.  The government, particularly the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) and the Central Institute for \nEconomic Management (CIEM), have strived to improve the quality of new legal documents and \nto extend legal protection to private businesses in the country. The MOJ has issued guidelines to \nconduct RIAs, with the aim of harmonizing practices across government agencies.  \n \n22.  In response to demands from SMEs to improve the access to and quality of legal services, \nthe  government  has  continued  to  implement  Decree  66/2008  to  ensure  that  the  rights  of \nenterprises to conduct business are protected. Program 585 on SME Access to Legal Services \nwas  approved  in  2010,  which  established  a  specialized  division  within  the  Civil  Economic \nLegislation  Department  of  the  MOJ.  The  SME  Legal  Services  Division  has  organized  an \nimportant number of events across the country through the provincial branches of the MOJ to \ndisseminate laws pertaining to SME development. Despite its financial constraints, the division \nhas  been  able  to  conduct  32  round  table  discussions  on  business  legislation  with \n ", "6 \n6,000 participating  SMEs;  and  50  training  courses  on  business  legislation,  training  some \n10,000 SME participants. The division, together with the staff of the provincial governments, has \nprovided training to 7,600 legal representatives of SMEs on contractual issues since its creation \nin 2010. About half of these participants are women. \n \n23.  The  government,  through  the  Viet  Nam  Competition  Authority  (VCA),  has  made \nsubstantial progress toward amendment of the Competition Law and its implementing regulations. \nThe VCA has published the 5-year Review Report on Viet Nam Competition Legislation, which \ntogether with the results of an ongoing survey of 500 enterprises and professionals, will serve as \nthe basis for the proposed amendments to the law. The policy matrix reflects current progress, \nas well as the need to address the RIA for the amended law in 2014. The government also \ncompleted drafting of the amendments to the Enterprise Law in February 2013, representing an \nimportant new trigger in the policy matrix. The amendments to the law incorporate aspects of \ngood corporate governance. The proposed amended law is expected to be submitted to the \nNational Assembly in last quarter of 2013.  \n \n24.  The government has completed a review of the implementation of the unemployment \ninsurance scheme, covering important aspects of the scheme that are applicable to SMEs. As a \nresult, the  deadline to apply  for  unemployment  benefits  has  been  extended  and  expanded \nadvisory services are provided for beneficiaries actively looking for jobs.  Recommendations \nunder  consideration  include  requests  to  extend  coverage  of  the  scheme  to  smaller  private \ncompanies (with 10 employees or less) and for employees with contracts beyond 3 months. In \naddition, the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) has been publishing sex-\ndisaggregated labor market data through its annual Employment Trends publication and website, \ncontributing to efficient policy formulation that mainstreams gender dimensions. \n \n4.  Enhancing SME Access to Finance \n \n25.  The government has taken initiatives to increase the availability of credit to SMEs through \nthe implementation of a number of reforms. A new draft decree on the activities of financing and \nleasing  companies  has  been  submitted  for  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  approval.  The  decree \nconsolidates earlier regulations to provide consistency with the recent Law on Credit Institutions. \nThe draft decree provides further clarity as to the liabilities and obligations of leasing companies \nand client enterprises. In addition, the government has identified SMEs as a priority sector for \ncredit growth in 2011\u20132013 and has issued guidelines to provide favorable credit terms from \nfinancial institutions to SMEs. Training initiatives for financial institutions have been implemented \nto create specialized SME knowledge and thus facilitate access to finance. \n \n26.  The  government  has  revised  the  legal  framework  for  the  credit  guarantee  scheme, \nensuring a more balanced credit risk and collateral sharing with participating commercial banks. \nDecision 3/2011 establishes a maximum guarantee through VDB of 85% of the total project \ncapital.  \n \n27.  The development of sources of equity financing has progressed with the steady growth of \nthe  unlisted  public  companies  market  (UPCoM).  HNX  has  produced  an  assessment  of \nconstraints  to  UPCoM  development  and  a  series  of  recommendations  for  its  reform.  The \nproposal has been submitted to the State Securities Commission and will effectively replace \nDecision 108 on the organization and operations of the UPCoM.11  \n                                                \n11 The HNX report and assessment were assisted by the work conducted under ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Third Financial Sector Program\u2014Subprogram II. Manila.  \n(TA 7464-VIE). ", "  7 \n28.  Subprogram 2 successfully concludes a medium-term program of assistance to support \nSME development in Viet Nam. The maturity of the sector and the assessment of structural \nchallenges to private sector development advise shifting, in terms of future direct ADB support, \nfrom policy-based loans to more targeted approaches that include both project and policy-based \nlending. Areas for continued policy dialogue include land reforms, SME access to legal services, \nand  public\u2013private  partnership  potential  for  SMEs.12  Further  success  in  private  sector \ndevelopment in Viet Nam will largely depend on progress in key structural reforms, such as \nfinancial sector or SOE reforms, where ADB has active programs of assistance. Sustained \nsupport to policy dialogue for SME development and specific project initiatives from development \npartners, including World Bank and JICA will continue to anchor reform efforts. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n29.  Subprogram 2 is estimated to cost $50 million. The loan size is based on the financing \nneeds of Viet Nam, the strength of the policy reform package, and its development impact. \nViet Nam\u2019s gross financing needs remain high. In 2013, with a budget deficit target of 4.8%, the \ngovernment will need to borrow D162 trillion ($7.8 billion). In 2012, deficit financing was obtained \nfrom domestic sources (44%) and external sources (56%), of which about 84% was official \ndevelopment assistance. Assuming a similar distribution for 2013, the government will borrow an \nestimated  $3.7  billion  through  official  development  assistance  to  close  the  budget  gap.  A \nsummary of the expected costs and benefits of the proposed reforms is provided in para. 33, \nwhile the program impact assessment provides additional details. Viet Nam\u2019s public debt is \ncurrently at sustainable levels. The present value of government and government-guaranteed \nexternal debt is estimated at about 27% of GDP,13 which is lower than the 50% of GDP threshold \nof the International Monetary Fund for external debt sustainability. More than 80% of government \nand government-guaranteed external debt is long-term concessional financing obtained from \nofficial creditors. \n \n30.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR33,000,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance subprogram 2. The loan \nwill have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan  agreement.  The  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.14 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n31.  Implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1. The MPI will be the executing \nagency and will be responsible for the overall implementation of subprogram 2. The Enterprise \nDevelopment Agency (EDA), MOF, MOJ, State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), Ministry of Industry and \nTrade (MOIT), Office of the Government (OOG), and MOLISA will be the implementing agencies \nand will all be responsible for the day-to-day implementation of subprogram 2. The EDA will be \nresponsible  for  coordinating  and  monitoring  implementation  of  the  policy  actions  under \nsubprogram 2. The interministerial program steering committee established under subprogram 1, \nchaired  by  the  deputy  minister  or  a  designated  substitute  of  the  MPI,  and  comprising \nrepresentatives  from  the  EDA,  MOF,  MOJ,  SBV,  MOIT,  OOG,  and  MOLISA,  will  meet \nsemiannually, and if needed, on an ad hoc basis to monitor progress of the program, in particular, \nthe post-program policy partnership framework; and to provide guidance and direction to the \n                                                \n12  All these areas are currently supported under ADB technical assistance (footnote 2).  \n13  Macroeconomic and Debt Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  ADB. 1998.

DUE DILIGENCE \n32.  Subprogram 2 has benefited from a rich array of recent studies by ADB and other \ndevelopment partners. The studies include the governance risk assessment prepared for the \nADB country partnership strategy, the World Bank\u2019s country gender assessment, and others. In \naddition,  the  program  impact  assessment  and  the  macroeconomic  and  debt  management \nassessment carried out for subprogram 2 are presented as supplementary documents.  \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n33.  The impact assessment of subprogram 2 estimates that the policy reforms carried out \nunder subprogram 2 add about $900 million to the economy, equivalent to 0.6% of GDP.15 The \nbenefits arise from improved allocative and operational efficiencies at the regional government \nlevel.  These  include  the  simplification  of  administrative  procedures  ,  the  reduction  in  tax \ncompliance costs from reductions in the frequency of VAT declarations, and the simplification of \ncustoms and tax payment procedures. The costs of the policy reforms in terms of government \nadministrative costs and fiscal costs of implementing such reforms amount to about $465 million, \nor  0.3%  of  GDP.  The  costs  include  implementation  of  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise \nDevelopment  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  implementation  of  the  Medium-Term  Plan  for  Customs \nModernization, and the cost of establishment of the forthcoming SME Development Fund. The \nreforms articulated in Subprogram 2 are expected to provide a net benefit to the economy.  \n \nB.   Governance \n \n34.  The government\u2019s public financial management reforms are at an early stage but steady \nprogress is being made in improving macro-fiscal discipline, strategic allocation of resources, \nand efficiency of service delivery. In spite of good tax collection ratios (about 26% of GDP), the \ndetermination of actual budget deficits is compromised by the application of standards different \nfrom the Global Financial Statistics in the government\u2019s official accounts. Further efficiency of \nbudgetary allocations (and on service delivery) requires better linkages between medium-term \n                                                \n15 Summary  Program  Impact  Assessment  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  The \nmethodology used   assists in minimizing adjustment costs from reforms, justifying the proposed regulatory reforms \non the basis of the expected net benefits.  ", "  9 \nplanning and budgeting and between capital and recurrent expenditures. The government is \nreviewing the 2002 Budget Law to deepen implementation of the medium-term expenditure \nframework and performance-based budgeting, and to improve budget execution, monitoring, and \nimplementation.  The  treasury  and  budget  management  information  system  is  strengthening \ngovernment budget reporting and accounting. Tax management and customs modernization \nreforms are under way, increasing the transparency of administrative procedures and reducing \ncompliance costs for taxpayers. The government has approved the National External Debt and \nPublic Debt Strategy, 2011\u20132020. As a result, aggregate public debt information has been \npublished recently for the first time. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and the MPI. The government is taking concrete \nsteps to battle corruption and has adopted several legal reforms, including implementation of the \nAnti-Corruption Law, 2005. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n35.  Subprogram  2  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  through  its  support  for  the \ngovernment\u2019s SEDP, 2011\u20132015, which (i) specifies support for the development of SMEs in \nremote  and  socioeconomically  disadvantaged  areas;  (ii)  prioritizes  SMEs  owned  by  ethnic \nminorities  and  women;  and  (iii)  targets  350,000  new  SMEs  to  be  established,  generating \n3.5\u20134.0 million new jobs during the same period, some of which will be in the disadvantaged \nareas. The policy reforms proposed will strengthen the regulatory business environment and \nreduce the administrative costs of doing business, making it easier for enterprises to enter the \nmarket and become more competitive. SME development has the greatest impact on new jobs \ncreation, raising incomes and making more resources available for social protection.16  \n \n36.   Subprogram 2 has been categorized \u201ceffective gender mainstreaming.\u201d It will strengthen \nthe  institutional  framework  for  SME  policy  making,  leading  to  the  development  of  gender-\nresponsive policy and regulations to support the development of women entrepreneurs and the \ngrowth  of  SMEs  owned  by  women.  Subprogram  2  will  facilitate  the  collection  of  sex-\ndisaggregated data on SMEs, and will increase women entrepreneurs\u2019 access to credit and \nfinancial  services.  The policies  supported  by  subprogram  2  have  identified  specific  targets, \nincluding an increase in the amount of women entrepreneurs to 26% by 2013 and 35% by 2020, \nand an explicit commitment to collect SME composition data that is sex-disaggregated. The \nSEDP, 2011\u20132015 includes provisions for specific programs to upgrade the capacity of SMEs \nowned by women and to provide access to credit to 286,000 women entrepreneurs. The SEDP \nalso calls for the provision of training to women provincial registrars covering the new business \nregistration system, and directs the General Statistics Office to publish data on women directors \nand firm owners disaggregated by enterprise, ethnicity, age group, and education level. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n37.   Subprogram  2  is  categorized  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n38.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.17  \n \n                                                \n16 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWeak institutional coordination among government  The Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2011\u20132015 \nagencies may jeopardize the effective implementation of  defines a clear role of the Council for Development of \nSME policies  SMEs in its implementation, as well as the responsibilities \nof the major associated agencies \nLow capacity of the EDA at the Ministry of Planning and  Support to operations of the EDA is provided under \nInvestment for subprogram 2 implementation, as EDA  current technical assistance; improved development \ncapacities are overstretched, slowing down the pace of  partner coordination will be necessary \nimplementation \nSlow pace of implementation of parallel reform  ADB\u2019s initiatives of assistance to SOE restructuring and \ninitiatives such as SOE restructuring; financial sector  financial sector reforms can improve the competitiveness \nreforms; and land law reforms  of the private sector and its access to credit. \nDelays in the amendments of key legislation for private  The upcoming Economic Management Competitiveness \nsector development, including in the review and  and Credit Program loan, with ADB support, will provide \namendment of the Enterprise Law and the Law on  continuity to the still unfinished policy dialogue on key \nCompetition  legislation \nLack of skills and experience to run internationally  An upcoming SME survey on entrepreneurship will inform \ncompetitive medium-sized and large firms  ADB\u2019s vocational training programs and suggest future \ninitiatives in the area \nGlobal economic crisis may jeopardize SME  A potential slump in exports caused by the downturn in \ndevelopment strategy, because of the focus on the  consumption in Europe and its possible effect on other \nintegration of SMEs into global production chains  developed countries may jeopardize the prospects of \nSMEs.
