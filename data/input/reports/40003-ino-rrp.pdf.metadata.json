Significant disparities exist in achievements across regions and \nin  many  areas, \nincome  groups.  While  solid  progress \naccelerated  improvements  are  needed  to  meet  the  international  and \nnational  MDG  targets.  Poverty  levels  increased  in  2006,  reversing \nprevious  gains,  with  almost  40  million  (17.7%)  poor,  and  49%  of  the \npopulation living on less than $2 a day. This is far from the MDG target \nof  reducing  the  proportion  of  people  below  the  poverty  line  to  7.6%  of \nthe  population  by  2015.  Progress  toward  some  of  the  health-related \ntargets \nis  particularly  off-track.  Maternal  mortality  rates  remain \nstubbornly high, malnutrition and child mortality rates are higher than in \nmany  neighboring  countries,  and  about  582,000  new  cases  of \ntuberculosis are recorded every  year. The infant mortality rate is three \ntimes higher for the poorest 20% of the population than for the richest \n20%,  and  about  half  of  the  children  from  the  poorest  quintile  of \nhouseholds  do  not  enroll  in  junior  secondary  school.  The  poor  suffer \ndisproportionately from a lack of access to quality education and health \nservices and have lower health and education outcomes.  \n\ninitiated \n\nThe Government has gradually increased social sector expenditures to \nmeet its ambitious poverty reduction and MDG-related targets. Several \ncritical  measures  were \nto  expand  and  reorient  public \nexpenditures  towards  the  education  and  health  sectors,  improve  the \nefficiency  of  health  services  for  the  poor,  and  expand  access,  equity \nand  quality  of  basic  education.  A  significant  portion  of  the  savings \ngenerated  by  removal  of  the  fuel  subsidy  was  utilized  to  mitigate \nimpacts on the poor through the Fuel Subsidy Reduction Compensation \nProgram  (PKPS-BBM)  launched  in  2005.  The  PKPS-BBM  Program \nthe  poor,  operational \nprovided  unconditional  cash \n\ntransfers \n\nto \n\n\fii\n\nImpact and \nOutcome\n\nassistance  to  schools  (BOS),  and  a  basic  healthcare  and  insurance \nprogram  (ASKESKIN)  for  the  poor  and  quasi-poor.  The  Government \nhas  also  initiated  critical  policy  actions  to  expand  and  improve  social \nsector delivery at the decentralized district level.  \n\nThe proposed PRMAP fits within the context of Indonesia entering into \na  second  generation  of  fiscal  reforms  and  reorientation  of  fiscal \nresources to accelerate attainment of the MDGs and achievement of its \npoverty reduction and social development goals. The proposed PRMAP \nhas  thus  been  designed  to  recognize  and  support  government  reform \nefforts  to  develop  and  implement  MDG-related  policy  actions,  while \nestablishing  a  flexible  policy  framework  to  deepen  and  expand  the \nreforms  in  the  medium  term.  The  policy  dialogue  has  resulted  in  the \ndesign  and  development  of  the  PRMAP  as  a  program  cluster  of  three \nconsecutive  subprograms,  each  of  them  supported  with  a  single \ntranche loan release. \n\ntowards  achieving \n\nthe  MDGs  (\u201cMDG  acceleration\u201d) \n\nImpacts  and  outcome.  The  PRMAP  impacts  will  be  to  accelerate \nprogress \nin \neducation  (MDG  2),  and  health  (MDGs  4,  5,  6)  and  contribute  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction (MDG 1) and gender equality (MDG 3) \nagenda.  The  program\u2019s  outcome  is  improved  access,  equity,  and \nquality  of  service  delivery  in  the  education  and  health  sectors  to \naccelerate  progress  toward  the  MDGs.  It  will  be  implemented  in \naccordance  with  national  priorities  as  reflected  in  the  current  medium \nterm development plan. The program will assist the Government in the \nongoing  re-orientation  of  fiscal  expenditures  to  the  social  sectors  and \nthe  reduction  of  regional  disparities.  PRMAP  will  include  three  main \npillars with the following policy outputs: \n\n(i) Cross-sectoral  reforms.  The  PRMAP  support  will  result  in:  (a)  an \nincreased budget allocation for health and education, especially focused \non  MDG-related  programs;  (b)  improved  performance  incentives  and \ngeographical resource allocation to districts for education and health; (c) \na uniform system for targeting the poor to achieve health and education-\nrelated  MDGs;  (d)  gender  equity  in  health  and  education  services;  and \n(e) a planning framework for MDG acceleration. \n\nin  under-served  areas, \n\n(ii)  Policy  reforms  in  the  education  sector  for  MDG  acceleration.\nThe  PRMAP  will  lead  to:  (a)  improved  access  to  junior  secondary \nimproved  operations  and \nschools \nmaintenance  (O&M)  support  for  smaller/remote  schools,  (c)  increased \naffordability  of  education  by  poor  students/households,  (d)  enhanced \nquality  and  equitable  deployment  of  teachers,  (e)  education  service \ndelivery  that  meets  minimum  service  standards  (MSSs),  (f)  improved \nplanning  and  implementation  of  education  services,  and  (g)  greater \ntransparency of education outcomes to enhance accountability. \n\n(b) \n\n(iii)  Policy  reforms  in  the  health  sector  for  MDG  acceleration. \nProgram  support  will  result  in  (a)  increased  public  financing  of  MDG-\nrelated  health  programs,  (b) better  targeting  of  public  financing  for \nhealth  services  for  the  poor,  (c)  improved  effectiveness  of  maternal \n\n\fCost  Estimates  and \nFinancing Plan \n\nProgram Loan \nAmount and Terms \n\nProgram Period and \nTranching\n\niii\n\nneonatal  and  child  health  (MNCH)  care  and  reproductive  health  (RH) \nservice  delivery  through  influencing  provider  behavior,  (d)  improved \neffectiveness  of  communicable  disease  control \nthrough \nintegrated  programs,  (e)  improved  performance  and  monitoring  for \nhealth-related MDGs, and (f) improved financial information with regard \nto MDG-related health expenditures. \n\n(CDC) \n\nIndonesia  faces  large  financing  requirements  to  support  its  ambitious \npoverty reduction MDG agenda over the medium term. For Subprogram \n1  (SP1),  the  Government  has  requested  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of \n$400 million. For subsequent Subprograms, the Government envisages \nsupport from ADB of $200 million each.  \n\nThe SP1 loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nhave  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  an  interest \nrate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per \nannum;  conversion  options  that  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with \nthe  draft  loan  agreement,  the  loan  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  conversion \nguidelines;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft \nprogram loan agreement.\n\nSP1  has  been  implemented  from  1  April  2005  to  31  March  2007.  All \nactions included in the policy matrix under SP1 have been taken during \nthese  2  years.  The  program  period  for  Subprogram  2  (SP2)  is  from  1 \nApril  2007  to  31  March  2009  and  Subprogram  3  (SP3)  will  be \nimplemented from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2011. The loans supporting \nthe subprograms of PRMAP will be disbursed in a single tranche upon \ndeclaration of loan effectiveness. \n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with \nthe provisions of ADB\u2019s simplified disbursement procedures for program \nloans,1  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Borrower.  No \nsupporting  import  documentation  will  be  required  if  the  value  of \nIndonesia\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries, \nineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan disbursed \nduring  the  given  year.  The  Government  will  certify  its  compliance  with \nthis \nimport \ndocumentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required.  ADB \nreserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  verify  the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n\nrequest.

It  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  sustain  the  reforms \nintroduced under SP1 and to refine and achieve the policy reforms under \nSP2. The TA includes three components: (i) cross-sectoral policy reforms, \n(ii)  reforms  in  the  education  sector,  and  (iii)  reforms  in  the  health  sector. \nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $2,700,000, of which $1,500,000 \nwill  be  provided  as  a  grant  from  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special \nFund, $1,000,000 will be cofinanced on a parallel basis by grants from \nthe  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  and  the  rest  by \nthe Government. \n\nThe key benefits expected from PRMAP are (i) the acceleration of the \nMDGs  and  sustained  progress  in  meeting  the  medium-term  poverty \nreduction and social development objectives, (ii) ongoing re-orientation \nof  public  expenditure  to  the  social  sectors,  (iii)  reduction  of  regional \ndisparities,  and  (iv)  increased  access  to  better  quality  and  more \naccountable education and health services.  \n\nThe  primary  beneficiaries  will  mainly  be  the  poor  and  women  and \nchildren  who  lack  access  to  quality  education  and  health  services. \nImproved access and equity of social services will contribute to reducing \nsharp  regional  and  socioeconomic  differences;  reducing  maternal  and \ninfant  and  child  mortality  rates;  and  improving  control  of  communicable \ndiseases  such  as  HIV/AIDS,  malaria  and  tuberculosis.  Better  physical \naccess to schools, the removal of fees, and enhanced quality is likely to \nresult  in  improved  participation  and  transition  rates  to  junior  secondary \neducation.  \n\nAccelerating  progress  towards  the  achievement  of  the  MDGs  will \ndirectly benefit women. The policy measures will lead to improvements \nin  (i)  girls  access  to  junior  secondary  education  through  integrated \nschools  and  scholarship  schemes,  and  (ii)  women\u2019s  access \nto \naffordable maternal and reproductive health services through increased \nfinancing and technical improvements to the ASKESKIN program.  \n\nImproved access to basic education will increase productivity and personal \nincome  of  poor  families  in  the  long  run.  Access  to  affordable  health \nservices and to health insurance will increase productivity and protect the \npoor  from  catastrophic  health  risks,  which  can  plunge  them  into  deeper \npoverty.  The  PRMAP  will  contribute  to  the  development  of  human \nresources  to  better  equip  the  population  to  take  advantage  of  the \nopportunities  generated  by  economic  growth.  It  will  also  have  a  positive \nimpact on employment by increasing the number of healthcare providers \n(e.g., midwives) and improving recruitment and deployment of teachers.  \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions\n\nThe PRMAP is subject to the following risks: \n\n(i)\n\nLimited impact on education and health outcomes. Increased \ncentral  government  budget  allocations  for  education  and  health \nmay encourage local governments to reduce their own allocations. \nThe  introduction  of  performance-based  allocation  mechanisms \nand improved systems for monitoring outcomes will mitigate these \nrisks.\n\n\fv\n\n(ii) Corruption and poor governance. PRMAP may face constraints \nin  the  form  of  weak  governance  and  corruption.  However,  the \nGovernment  has  considerably  strengthened  its  anti-corruption \nefforts over recent years.\n\n(iii)  Resistance to the policy reforms by local governments.  Lack\nof  clarity  about  the  reform-related  roles  and  obligations  of  local \ngovernment  involved  in  social  services  delivery,  combined  with  a \nlack  of  capacity  could  pose  obstacles  for  reform  implementation. \nThere is also a risk that local governments do not support reforms \nthat increase accountability and impose further monitoring of their \npolicies  and  actions.  Recent  steps  taken  to  clarify  roles  and \nthrough  development  of  minimum  services \nresponsibilities \nstandards,  and  current  support  provided  by  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment  partners  to  a  number  of  districts  for  capacity \ndevelopment, are expected to reduce these risks.  \n\n(iv)  External  and  domestic  economic  shocks.  Increased  oil  prices \nor  other  adverse  regional  or  domestic  events  that  have  a \ncontagion effect could reduce the fiscal space available for reform \nimplementation.  To  date,  Government  efforts  to  balance  the \nbudget  and  improve  economic  management  have  reduced  this \nrisk.\n\n(v)  Government  commitment  to  the  MDGs.  A  lack  of  government \ncommitment  could  reduce  the  momentum  for  policy  reforms \nfocused  on  accelerated  achievement  of  the  MDGs.  However, \nGovernment  actions  indicate  strong  commitment  to  the  poverty \nreduction and MDG acceleration agenda in the medium term.  \n\n\f\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nprogram  cluster  for  the  Poverty  Reduction  and  Millennium  Development  Goals  Acceleration \nProgram  (PRMAP)  to  the  Government  of  Indonesia,  comprising  (i)  a  first  subprogram  and  a \nproposed  two  subsequent  subprograms,  (ii)  a  proposed  loan  for  subprogram  1  of  the  PRMAP,1\nand (iii) proposed technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening Social Services Delivery. \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM AND MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\n2. \nOver  the  past  2  years,  the  Government  of  Indonesia  (the  Government)  has  made \nimpressive progress in macroeconomic management, and succeeded in returning the economy \nto an economic growth path. During this period the Government consolidated gains made over \nthe  past  few  years  and  instituted wide-ranging  structural reforms  in  various  sectors  to  remove \ndistortions that led to the 1997 financial crisis. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rose \nfrom  the  post-crisis  level  of  0.8%  (in  1998)  to  2\u20133%  during  2000\u20132002,  and  reached  5.5%  in \n2006.  Fiscal  consolidation  has  been  the  central  feature  of  the  Government\u2019s  macroeconomic \nmanagement.  Since  the  Asian  financial  crisis  of  1997,  the  Government\u2019s  principal  focus  has \nbeen  on  recouping  the  massive  cost  of  financial  sector  restructuring,  estimated  at  upwards  of \n$75 billion, or over a third of Indonesia\u2019s annual GDP.  \n\nEconomic  vulnerability  to  external  shocks  has  been  decreasing  due  to  sound  debt \n3. \nmanagement.  The  central  government  budget  deficit  has  been  reduced  from  2.8%  to  0.9%  of \nGDP over the 2000\u20132006 period, while the government debt-to-GDP ratio decreased from 90% \nto 39.6% over the same period, heading towards the target of 30% by 2010. In 2006, Indonesia \nprepaid $7.6 billion owed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Foreign exchange reserves, \nsupported by returning capital inflows, rose sharply in 2006, from $24.7 billion to $42.6 billion. \nThe ratio of total external debt to GDP fell from 46.7% in 2005 to 34.0% in 2006. However, there \nare still some debt concerns, due to the fact that around 20% of all tax revenue is needed to pay \npublic debt services. Increased public spending will lead to a rise in the budget deficit from the \ninitial estimate of 0.9% to 1.6% of GDP for 2007. The Jakarta floods in 2007, mudflows in East \nJava,  earthquake  damage  in  East  Sumatra  and  rice  purchases  for  buffer  stocks  to  stabilize \nprices will contribute to this increase.  \n\n4. \nIn  2005,  the  Government  addressed  one  of  the  most  critical  distortions  by  increasing \ndomestic  fuel-oil  prices  by  29%  in  March  and  subsequently  by  126%  in  October.  This  move \nsaved about $5 billion in 2005 and $10 billion in 2006 that would otherwise have been spent on \nunproductive  fuel  subsidies,  which  were  largely  regressive  and  benefited  mainly  the  middle \nclasses.  Due  to  fuel  price  increases,  inflation  accelerated  to  over  18%  in  October  2005.  The \ncentral bank raised interest rates from 8% to 9.75% between October 2005 to December 2006 \nto  counter  the  upward  pressure  on  prices.  High  interest  rates  and  inflation  have  had  negative \nconsequences  on  the  poor  and  near-poor.  In  September  2006,  the  Central  Board  of  Statistics \n(BPS)  reported  an  increase  from  16.0%  to  17.7%  in  the  poverty  head  count  index  between \nFebruary 2005 and March 2006.\n\nWhile the Government  has largely managed to attain its goal of fiscal prudence, in the \n5. \npast  it  has  not  been  able  to  maintain  its  development  expenditures\u2014particularly  on  education \nand  health\u2014at  the  scale  needed  to  accelerate  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction  and  social \ndevelopment  in  parity  with  its  regional  neighbors.  From  1985  to  2001,  health  sector  funding \naveraged less than 3% of total public expenditure and about 0.5% of GDP, which is much lower \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n\f2\n\nthan  the  average  for  ASEAN  countries  of  2.5%  of  GDP.  In  2001,  public  expenditure  on \neducation was only 2.4% of GDP, one of the lowest rates among similar countries in the region. \nThe  past  low  level  of  financing  has  constrained  delivery  of  the  quality  basic  social  services \nrequired to meet the economy\u2019s human capital development needs.  \n\n6. \nMindful  of  the  need  to  transform  economic  growth  into  sustainable  broad-based \ndevelopment, the Government has been gradually increasing public expenditures for the social \nsectors  and  providing  additional  funds  to  local  governments  for  health  and  education.  The \nGovernment has acknowledged that increases in overall social sector expenditures are required if \nits ambitious targets relating to poverty reduction and accelerated achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) (\u201cMDG acceleration\u201d) are to be achieved. The 2007 Indonesia Public \nExpenditure Review (PER)2 showed that total public education and health expenditures increased \nsignificantly from 2001 to 2006. During this period, education expenditures increased from 11.4% \nto  17.2%  of  overall  national  expenditure,  while  health  expenditures  rose  from  2.6%  to  4.5%; \nmeasured  as  a  share  of  GDP,  education  expenditures  rose  from  2.4%  to  3.6%,  and  health \nexpenditures  from  0.55%  to  0.95%.  Despite  significant  increases,  Indonesia  still  spends \nsignificantly less than its neighbors on education and health. Annual expenditures on the order of \n4% of GDP in both the health and education sectors are required to achieve basic improvements \nin human development and achievement of the MDGs.  \n\nDebt  management  and  steady  economic  growth  combined  with  the  creation  of  additional \n7. \nfiscal  space  has  provided  the  confidence  to  increase  public  expenditures  for  tackling  poverty \nreduction and investing in health and education. A significant portion of the savings generated by \nremoval of the fuel subsidy was utilized to mitigate the impacts of the fuel price increases on the \npoor. In 2005, the Government launched a Fuel Subsidy Reduction Compensation Program (PKPS-\nBBM) focused on the poor. This released funds for pro-poor social expenditures. The PKPS-BBM \nincluded  four  different  sub-programs:  (i)  unconditional  cash  transfers  to  the  poor,  (ii)  operational \nassistance  to  schools  (bantuan  operational  sekolah,  [BOS]),  (iii)  basic  health  care  and  health \ninsurance (ASKESKIN program) for the poor and quasi-poor, and (iv) a rural infrastructure program. \n\n8. \nWhile increased investments in the social sectors are critical, the Government has been \nacutely  aware  of  other  constraints  that  impede  efficient  public  expenditure  management, \nincluding  (i)  limited  capacity  at  the  district  level  to  design  and  deliver  education  and  health \nexpenditure  programs,  resulting  from  the  rapid  pace  at  which  decentralization  reforms  were \nintroduced;  and  (ii)  political  and  regional  autonomy  considerations,  which  had  to  be  balanced \nwith the devolution of resources and responsibilities for education and health service delivery to \nthe districts to ensure that national policy objectives, such as the attainment of the MDGs, are \nachieved. Fundamental challenges have emerged in relation to the lack of clarity on functional \nassignments,  financial  management,  accountability,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the \nefficiency of public social expenditure programs. In light of these constraints, the Government, \nwith the support of ADB and other development partners, has adopted comprehensive reforms \nto  strengthen  the  overall  policy,  legal  and  regulatory  framework  relating  to  local  government \nfinance.\n\nIn  2005, the  Government  requested  that  ADB  provide  a  program  loan  to  support  its \n9.\npoverty reduction and social development objectives over the medium term. The program would \nbe designed to support the education and health reform agenda and improve the effectiveness \nof  public  expenditure  programs  targeted  at  accelerating  achievement  of  the  health-  and \neducation-related  MDGs.  Since  early  2005,  ADB  has  been  engaged  in  an  MDG-related  policy \n\n                                                \n2   World  Bank,  BAPPENAS,  and  MOF.  2007.  Indonesia  Spending  for  Development:  Public  Expenditure  Review. \n\nWashington, DC. \n\n\f3\n\ndialogue  with  the  Government  and  other  relevant  development  partners.  ADB  has  prepared \nassessments  of  the  education  and  health  sectors,  identified  constraints,  and  discussed  key \nsector  issues  and  related  medium-term  reforms  for  the  attainment  of  the  MDGs  with  relevant \nministries.  Policy  dialogue  was  conducted  through  several  consultations;  pre-fact-finding,  fact-\nfinding, and appraisal missions; and ongoing policy dialogue by Indonesia Resident Mission and \nADB teams working on health and education projects. During this period, the Government has \ntaken  initial  critical  steps  and  instituted  a  range  of  policy  actions  to  set  the  pace  for  reforms \naimed  at  accelerating  achievement  of  the  MDGs.  The  Government  requested  that  ADB  work \ntowards  a  medium-term  commitment  of  resources  to  support  the  MDG  acceleration  program, \nwith particular attention to the health and education sectors.  \n\n10.\nIndonesia is entering into a second generation of fiscal reforms and reorientation of fiscal \nresources, aimed at achievement of the MDGs within a stable macroeconomic framework, and \nthe  proposed  PRMAP  fits  within  this  context,  which  is  characterized  by  the  Government\u2019s \nobjectives of: (i) enhancing the quantity and quality of social public expenditures; (ii) improving \nlocal  government  accountability  without  stifling  basic  regional  autonomy  principles;  and  (iii) \nadopting sound and sustainable resource allocation mechanisms to target poverty reduction and \nMDG  acceleration,  especially  in  lagging  areas.  Viewed  within  the  above  macroeconomic \ncontext,  Indonesia  is  emerging  as  a  middle-income  country  that  seeks  flexible  financing \narrangements  to  support  its  development  objectives.  As  a  result,  the  proposed  PRMAP  has \nbeen designed to recognize and support Government reform efforts to develop and implement \npolicy  actions  leading  to  MDG  acceleration,  while  establishing  a  flexible  policy  framework  to \ndeepen  and  expand  the  reforms  in  the  medium  term.  The  policy  dialogue  has  resulted  in  the \ndesign and development of the PRMAP as a program cluster of three consecutive subprograms \n(SP),  each  supported  with  a  single  tranche  loan  release.  Subject  to  satisfactory  progress,  the \nthree subprograms will be phased at intervals of about 2 years. \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTORS \n\n11. \nAt  the  Millennium  Summit  in  September  2000,  the  Government  committed  to  meeting \nthe  MDGs  by  2015,  and  the  Government  reiterated  this  commitment  and  presented  the \ncountry\u2019s  2005  MDG  progress  report3  at  the  UN  General  Assembly  in  September  2005.  The \nPresident of Indonesia renewed and reinforced Indonesia\u2019s commitment to the MDGs during the \nstate address for the presentation of the 2007 budget. Special attention was given to issues of \npoverty,  education  and  health.  The  Government\u2019s  Medium  Term  Development  Plan  for  2005\u2013\n2009  (RPJM)  and  its  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (SNPK),  are characterized  by  a \nstrong  focus  on  policies  and  programs  for  social  justice,  equity  and  quality  of  basic  social \nservices, especially health and education. \n\nThe RPJM, which presents the Government medium-term vision, lays out an ambitious \n12. \npoverty reduction and social development agenda. The RPJM identifies the advancement of the \nwelfare  of  the  people  as  one  its  three  pillars  and  includes  targets  for  poverty  reduction  at  the \nnational level, reduction of inter-regional differences, and improvement of human capital through \nincreased access to and quality of education and health services. The RPJM sets social targets \nfor  2009,  some  of  which  are  more  ambitious  than  the  MDGs,  including:  (i)  halving  the  2004 \nnational  poverty  rate  (from  16.6%  to  8.2%);  (ii)  providing  9  years  of  compulsory,  quality  basic \neducation; (iii) reducing illiteracy to 5%; (iv) reducing child mortality to 26 per 1,000 live births; \nand (v) achieving a decline in maternal mortality to 226 per 100,000 live births. It is recognized \n\n                                                \n3   The 2007 MDG report for Indonesia is under preparation. \n\n\f4\n\nthat a major expansion of the budget allocation for social services is required to increase service \ncoverage and improve quality, particularly for health services (there is a constitutional obligation \nto allocate 20% of the total Government budget for education services).4\n\nThe MDGs form an overarching framework that places basic human rights and poverty \n13. \nat  the  center  of  the  development  agenda.  Indonesia\u2019s  progress  towards  meeting  the  MDG \ntargets  has  been  mixed.  While  the  country  has  made  good  progress  overall,  progress  toward \nseveral targets is slow. Despite the Government\u2019s efforts, vast differences exist across regions \nand districts and between rural and urban areas, as well as between income groups; there are \nalso some persistent gender disparities. A recent study to assess MDG progress in Asia and the \nPacific classified Indonesia as one of the countries of greatest concern, both with respect to the \nlevel of deprivation and the level of progress towards the MDGs.5 Indonesia\u2019s performance and \nprogress  on  the  MDGs  is  provided  below.6  A  summary  of  key  indicators  measuring  progress \ntoward the MDGs and targets is presented in Appendix 2. \n\nEradicating  Extreme  Poverty  (MDG  1).  Significant  progress  has  been  achieved  in \n14.\nreducing  income  poverty.  Despite  the  setback  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  income  poverty \ndeclined  steadily  from  the  1999  level  of  23.4%  to  16%  in  February  2005,  comparable  to  pre-\ncrisis  levels.  However,  by  March  2006,  an  additional  4  million  people  fell  into  poverty,  largely \ndue  to  the  removal  of  fuel  subsidies  and  increases  in  the  price  of  rice,  resulting  in  a  poverty \nincidence  of  about  17.7%;  this  is  far  from  the  MDG  target  of  7.6%  by  2015,7  or  the \nGovernment\u2019s  target  of  8.2%  by  2009.  This  level  of  poverty  incidence  translates  to  almost  40 \nmillion poor people, with many more (about 49% of the population) living on less than $2 a day, \nand vast regional differences. While four provinces have less than 10% of their population under \nthe poverty line (with Jakarta at 3.4%), at least 14 provinces have poverty levels of more than \n20% (with Papua at about 50%).  \n\nAchieving  Universal  Basic Education  (MDG  2).  Indonesia\u2019s  performance  relative  to \n15.\nthe education-related MDG has been mixed. It has made good progress towards meeting some \nof the intermediate targets at the national level, however regional disparities are still significant. \nThe Government is aiming beyond the standard MDG 2, as it has included both primary (1 to 6) \nand junior secondary (7 to 9) education levels in its universal basic education target. While the \nprimary  school  gross  enrolment  rate  (GER)  achieved  universal  coverage  by  the  early  1980s, \nand stayed high despite the financial crisis of the late 1990s, the net enrolment rate (NER) has \nmade only small steady increases (from 91.5% in 1995 to 94.0% in 2005). The GER for junior \nsecondary rose from 65.7% in 1995 to 85.2% in 2005, while the NER rose from 51% in 1995 to \n63.7%  in  2005.8  The  Government  target  is  to  raise  the  GER  in  junior  secondary  education  to \n95% by 2008.\n\n16.\nDespite the impressive GERs and NERs, disparities in access to education continue to \nexist (i) within provinces, (ii) between rural and urban areas, and (iii) between the rich and poor. \nThe  NER  for  junior  secondary  school  in  2006  ranged  from  43.3%  in  Nusa  Tenggara  Timur \n(NTT)  to  77.4%  in  D.I  Yogyakarta,  although  these  have  been  narrowing  over  the  last  decade. \n                                                \n4  Amended 1945 Constitution (Amendment 4, 2002) Article 31. \n5  ADB,  UNDP,  UNESCAP.  2006.  The  Millennium  Development  Goals:  Progress  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  2006.\n\nManila.  \n\n6   The analysis does not include MDGs 7 and 8, which are not supported by PRMAP. \n7  Poverty incidence in 1990, using the national poverty line, was 15.1%. In order to reach the MDG target of halving \n\npoverty between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people below the poverty line should be 7.6% by 2015.  \n\n8  Differences  in  the  GER  and  NER  indicate  that  the  school  system  is  catering  to  underage  and  over  age  children \nwithin  the  school  population,  indicating  system  inefficiencies.  Similarly,  gains  in  NERs  have  begun  to  stagnate \nindicating  access barriers  and constraints. While the  NER is a good measure of entry  into school, one of  its key \nlimitations is that it does not capture the level of school attendance or completion.\n\n\f5\n\nWhile  the  gap  in  the  NER  at  the  primary  level  between  the  rich  and  poor  is  very  small,  this \nwidens at the junior secondary level. In 2002, only 45.5% of children from the poorest income \nquintile enrolled in junior secondary education, compared with 76.9% of children from the richest \nquintile, indicating that access constraints to education are significantly poverty-related. \n\n17.\nFurthermore,  not  all  Indonesian  children  enrolled  in  school  complete  basic  education \nwithin the required 9 years. Around 686,000 children drop out of primary school annually, and \nchildren  who  fail  to  complete  primary  education  are  especially  at  risk  of  becoming  illiterate \nadults. In 2004/2005, the primary to junior secondary transition rate stood at 82.6%, with 17.4% \nof  students  who  completed  primary  education  not  continuing  on  to  junior  secondary.  Despite \nsteady achievements in increasing school enrolment, Indonesia\u2019s national average educational \nattainment is low compared to neighboring countries. In 2003, Indonesians aged 15 years and \nabove  had  an  average  of  7.44  years  of  schooling;  only  36.2%  had  an  education  equal  to  or \nabove the junior secondary level. \n\n18. \nPromoting Gender Equality and Empowering Women (MDG 3). Indonesia is on track \nto eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education by 2015. The  gender gap in \nterms of the NER at the national level has been eliminated at the primary level, and reversed for \nthe  junior  secondary  level.  At  the  senior  secondary  level  in  2003,  the  female  NER  of  37.7% \nlagged slightly behind the male rate of 38.8%. While the gender gap in adult literacy rates has \nbeen narrowing steadily, the literacy rate of women (86%) is still lower than that of men (94%). \nWomen have a mean of 6.5 years of schooling, while the mean for men is 7.6 years.9\n\nReducing Child Mortality (MDG 4). Indonesia is currently on track to achieve the MDG \n19.\ntarget  of  reducing  the  under-5  mortality  rate  by  two  thirds  between  1990  and  2015.  Between \n1990  and  2004  under-5  mortality  decreased  from  97  per  1,000  live  births  to  38,  which  is  still \nhigher than similar countries in the region, but close to the MDG target of 32.3. There are still \nsharp regional and socioeconomic differences in child mortality rates, however, ranging from 23 \ndeaths per 1,000 births in Yogyakarta to 103 in West Nusa Tenggara. The differences between \nthe rich and poor in the under-5 mortality rate are still some of the sharpest observed in Asia, \nwith  about  20  deaths  per  1000  births  among  the  richest  quintile,  compared  with  75  deaths \namong the poorest quintile. \n\nImprove  Maternal  Health  (MDG  5).  Although  considerable  progress  has  been  made \n20.\ntoward  achieving  the  target  of  reducing  by  three  fourths  the  maternal  mortality  ratio  (MMR), \nprogress  to  date  has  not  been  sufficiently  rapid  to  indicate  achievement  of  this  target.  The \nestimated MMR has declined from 390 to 307 per 100,000 live births between 1994 and 2002, \nwhich  is  very  far  from  the  2015  MDG  target  of  102.  During  the  period  1992  to  2002,  the \nproportion  of  births  assisted  by  skilled  health  personnel  (an  important  MDG  5  intermediate \nindicator) has increased from 40.7% to 72.0%, but is still far from the government target of 90% \nby 2010. Sharp socioeconomic differences remain, with only 48% of poor women delivering with \na trained provider, compared with 90% of wealthy women; regional disparities are also marked, \nwith  just  35%  of  women  delivering  with  a  trained  provider  in  NTT,  compared  with  96%  in \nJakarta.\n\nCombat HIVAIDS, Malaria, and Other Diseases (MDG 6). Indonesia is not on track to \n21.\nachieve the MDG targets for HIV/AIDS and malaria, although is on track for tuberculosis (TB). \nThe HIV/AIDS epidemic is concentrated in a few high-prevalence groups (i.e., commercial sex \nworkers  and  injecting  drug  users).  It  is  estimated  that  about  193,000  Indonesians  lived  with \nHIV/AIDS  and  about  5,500  died  of  AIDS  in  2006,  while  about  18,000  are  orphans  due  to  the \n\n                                                \n9  ADB. 2006. Indonesia: Country Gender Assessment. Manila. \n\n\f6\n\ndisease. The incidence of condom use with high-risk partners is still low, while comprehensive \ncorrect knowledge about HIV/AIDS is still limited to the better educated.  \n\n22. \nNearly one-half of Indonesia\u2019s population lives in malaria-endemic areas, and about 30 \nmillion cases are expected to occur every year. Although bed net coverage is reasonably high, \nuse  of  insecticide-treated  bed  nets  and  indoor  spraying  are  still  limited.  Unless  funding  for \nmalaria  control  is  increased  significantly  in  the  future,  it  is  unlikely  that  malaria  incidence  will \nhave  begun  to  decrease  by  2015.  Indonesia\u2019s  estimated  TB  prevalence  rate  remains  high,  at \n125  per  100,000  people.  Although  the  directly  observed  treatment\u2014short  course  (DOTS) \ntreatment success rate has increased sharply during the past few years, reaching 57% in 2005, \nit is still far from the Government target of 85%. \n\nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities10\n\n1. \n\nIssues \n\na. \n\nCross-Sectoral Issues \n\nThe  MDGs  will  not  be  achieved  unless  the  poor  have  better  access  to,  and  utilize, \n23. \naffordable and good quality health and education services. Policies and programs are needed \nthat: (i) increase and better target budgetary allocations for health and education services at the \ndistrict level; (ii) improve the quality and efficiency of these services; (iii) improve public sector \ngovernance;  (iv)  monitor  and  evaluate  outcomes;  and  (v)  develop  efficient  and  transparent \naccountability  mechanisms  between  national  and  regional  governments,  service  providers, \nusers and communities to improve performance.  \n\nDecentralization  has  posed  considerable  challenges  to  the  delivery  of  education  and \n24. \nhealth  services,  resulting  in  significant  differences  in  outcomes  and  performance  across  local \ngovernments.  Basic  education  and  health  services  are  obligatory  functions  of  the  district \ngovernment.11 However, the central government still has a key role in the allocation of resources \nand  the  development  of  policies,  legislation  and  guidelines.  In  principle,  the  switch  to  a \ndecentralized system for the provision of social services should positively affect access, equity \nand  effectiveness  of  service  delivery.  However,  devolving  the  responsibility  for  education  and \nhealth care to the districts has reduced the Government\u2019s capacity to implement and monitor its \nnational policy objectives, including the achievement of the MDGs. Disparities among districts in \ncapacity and per-capita health and education expenditure has led to critical gaps in access and \nquality  of  service  provision  in  some  districts.  Improvements  in  the  mechanisms  for  allocating \nfunds  to  the  provinces  and  districts  are  required  to  (i)  better  target  poorly  performing  districts \nthat  need  additional  assistance  (so-called  \u201cMDG-deficit  districts\u201d);  and  (ii)  encourage  local \ngovernments to improve performance in the health and education sectors, so as to achieve the \nMDGs.  \n\nNeed to Improve Fund Allocation for MDG-Deficit Districts. Local governments have \n25.\nbeen granted substantial fiscal autonomy through the introduction of an intergovernmental fiscal \ntransfer system that includes elements of revenue sharing, a general development fund (Dana \nAlokasi  Umum,  or  DAU),12  and  a  special  development  fund  (Dana  Alokasi  Khusus,  or  DAK). \n                                                \n10 Appendix  3  includes  a  summary  sector  analysis  for  the  health  and  education  sectors,  and  Supplementary \n\nAppendices A and B include detailed analyses. \n\n11 Law  32  of  2004  gives  provincial  governors  responsibility  for  assessing  district  budgets  to  ensure  that  districts \ncomply  with  their  obligatory  functions.  However,  the  districts  retain  the  main  responsibility  for  the  provision  of \neducation  and  health  services.  The  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  (MOHA)  is  preparing,  in  2007,  a  new  government \nregulation that will further clarify the roles and responsibilities of each level of government. \n\n12 DAU  represents  about  80%  of  local  government  revenues  and  is  largely  allocated  for  salaries  of  health  and \neducation staff devolved to the districts. The Government is discussing different options for the reform of the DAU \n\n\f7\n\nAlthough these mechanisms are meant to assist local governments without sufficient resources \nof their own, the current distribution criteria do not allow a focus on the poorest districts, or those \nnot on track to achieve the MDGs. For example, the DAK allocation for education is not linked to \nenrolment rates in primary or junior secondary schools, and the DAK allocation for health is not \nrelated to the use of skilled health personnel.  \n\nUneven Performance by Districts in the Delivery of Health and Education Services.\n26.\nThe  PER  estimated  that  70%  of  education  and  health  expenditures  are  made  at  the  sub-\nnational  level,  mostly  by  district  governments.13  In  most  districts  the  majority  of  the  budget  for \nthese sectors is allocated for salary and benefits, and the percentage allocated to development \nexpenditures  and  other  recurrent  activities,  including  maintenance  and  operations,  has  been \nhistorically very small. Furthermore, there are significant disparities between districts in the per \ncapita public expenditures for health and education,14 which translate into inequalities in service \nprovision across districts. Many districts need to improve their planning and budgeting systems, \nfiduciary  controls,  and  education  and  health  expenditure  monitoring  to  make  them  more \nefficient,  transparent  and  better  targeted  to  the  poor.  An  increased  resource  allocation  to  the \nsocial  sectors  is  required  to  improve  health  and  education  outcomes  and  performance, \nparticularly  by  poor  and  MDG-deficit  districts.  Current  transfers  from  the  Government  to  the \ndistricts are not linked to outcomes or performance.  \n\nThe Reform of the DAK Offers an Opportunity to Provide Additional Resources to \n27.\ndistricts for MDG Programs and to Improve Performance. The purpose of the DAK is to (i) \naddress  basic  services  that  have  not  met  certain  standards,  and  (ii)  support  areas  requiring \naccelerated  development.  DAK  allocations  are  earmarked  by  the  Government  to  specific \nsectors and districts. Each year, Parliament establishes the total DAK amount, with the overall \nlevel  of  DAK  resources  allocated  to  each  of  the  sectors  agreed  upon  by  the  (i)  Ministry  of \nFinance  (MOF),  (ii)  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  (MOHA),  (iii)  National  Development  Planning \nAgency  (BAPPENAS),  and  (iv)  the  respective  line  ministries.  Subsequently,  the  line  ministries \nearmark  these  resources  to  specific  uses  in  particular  local  governments  within  their  sectors. \nFor FY2007, DAK allocations are broken down into seven different sectors, with education and \nhealth jointly representing more than 50% of the total DAK.15 The allocation of DAK resources \nfor  health  and  education  to  specific  districts  is not  linked  to  performance  or  progress  on  MDG \nachievement. There is also a high degree of unpredictability regarding the flow of funds, due to \nannual  modifications  of  the  allocation  criteria,  which  distorts  district-level  plans  and  budgets. \nFurthermore,  the  DAK  has  remained  basically  undeveloped  until  recently,  comprising  a  small \npercentage  of  all  central  government  transfers  to  districts,  and  of  all  capital  development \nresources.  However,  with  the  significant  increases  in  DAK  financing  for  2005\u20132007,  there  are \nplans to introduce performance criteria for DAK allocations. The expansion and development of \nDAK  into  a  more  efficient  mechanism  for  funding  social  sectors  also  offers  an  opportunity  to \ndirect increased resources to MDG-deficit districts.  \n\n                                                \n\nin 2008 to transform it into a more efficient instrument to provide additional funds to the poorest districts. The Local \nGovernment  Finance  and  Governance  Reform  II  program,  currently  under  preparation  by  ADB,  is  expected  to \nsupport the Government in these reforms. \n\n13 In  2004,  districts  spent  about  63%  of  the  total  national  education  budget  and  49%  of  the  total  national  health \n\nbudget, while the provinces spend about 6% and 18% respectively for education and health. \n\n14 There is a positive relationship between the level of district revenue and  education and health expenditures, with \nhardly any variation in the share of district spending on health, at about 8%, and small variations for education, at \naround 33%. This translates into significant discrepancies in per capita allocations.  \n\n15 Districts  must  provide  matching  funds  of  10%  equivalent  of  the  central  government  contribution  (except  for  the \npoorest districts) from their own local budgets; they receive quarterly payments after they have demonstrated that \nthey have spent the funds from the previous quarter. \n\n\f8\n\nLack of a Uniform System for Targeting the Poor. A good quality targeting system is \n28.\nfundamental  to  making  health  and  education  programs  for  the  poor  and  near-poor  more \nefficient,  and  requires  accurate  identification  of  the  poor.  Despite  government  efforts,  a  recent \nreview of the targeting performance of past programs16 revealed that only 12% of households in \nthe  poorest  quintile  were  covered  by  scholarship  programs,  while  22%  had  access  to  health \ncards. Similarly, only 40% of the benefits of scholarship programs went to the poorest quintile, \nand  just  31%  of  the  health  cards  were  distributed  to  them.  Both  the  BOS  and  ASKESKIN \nprograms  have  also  identified  the  difficulty  of  accurately  targeting  the  poor.  The  use  by  each \nprogram  of  different  registries  of  the  poor  and  different  targeting  criteria17  has  significantly \ncontributed  to  this.  Developing  a  uniform  database  of  the  poor  and  effective  targeting \nmechanisms,  while  providing  some  allowance  for  local  flexibility,  is  crucial  for  delivery  of \neducation and health programs aimed to address gaps and disparities. \n\n29. \nGender Equality and Empowerment of Women is central to accelerating achievement \nof  all  the  MDGs.  Without  direct  improvements  in  women\u2019s  health,  education,  access  to  formal \nemployment  and  decision-making,  the  MDGs  are  unlikely  to  be  met.  A  recent  household  risk \nand vulnerability assessment18 shows that poor and near-poor households in Indonesia headed \nby  females  have  higher  maternal  mortality,  greater  risk  of  experiencing  health  shocks,  less \naccess to pre-natal care, lower levels of school attendance and a higher incidence of child labor. \nMDG  3  (promoting  gender  equality  and  empowerment  of  women)  and  MDG  5  (improving \nmaternal mortality) focus directly on women. MDG 2 (focusing on education), MDG 4 (relating to \nchild  mortality)  and  MDG  6  (on  communicable  disease  control  [CDC],  and  especially  the \nHIV/AIDS  target),  cannot  be  met  without  significant  economic  and  social  improvements  in  the \nlives of women and girls. The achievement of  MDG 3 depends on the extent to which actions \ntaken to achieve all the other goals are designed to promote equality between men and women \nand girls and boys. In other words, the achievement of MDG 3 requires both direct actions and a \nfocus  on  the  interdependence  among  all  the  goals.  As  a  crosscutting  theme,  gender  equality \nand women\u2019s empowerment needs to be integrated and mainstreamed across all MDG-related \npolicies,  sectors  and  programs.  Sex-disaggregated  indicators  are  required  for  (i)  measuring \nprogress and (ii) improved monitoring of both MDG 3 and the gender equity aspects of all the \nother goals. \n\nFemale  Illiteracy.  About  12.8  million  Indonesians  (8.17%  of  the  population)  aged  15 \n30.\nyears and above are illiterate. Two-thirds are women from remote or isolated areas with limited \naccess  to  educational  opportunities.  In  2005,  12.5%  of  females  aged  10  and  above  could  not \nread and write, as compared with 5.7% of men. While gender parity in literacy rates has been \nachieved  for  those  aged  15\u201324,  improving  the  literacy  levels  of  females,  especially  those  of \nreproductive  age,  remains  a  challenge.  Improved  female  literacy  has  implications  for  all  the \nhealth  and  education-related  MDGs.  Literate  mothers  are  more  likely  to  access  and  utilize \neducation and health services for children. Literate females have fewer children and engage in \nbetter  birth-spacing  practices,  reducing  the  risk  of  maternal  mortality.  There  is  a  strong \ncorrelation between a mother\u2019s literacy level and the life expectancy of a child at birth.  \n\nLack of a Planning Framework for MDG Acceleration. The lack of a comprehensive \n31.\nroadmap for accelerating achievement of the MDGs has made it difficult for the Government to \n\n                                                \n16 Social  Safety  Net  Program  for  the  Health  Sector  (JPSBK)  and  Scholarships  (BKM)  program  for  the  education \n\nsector.\n\n17 World  Bank.  2006.  Making  the  New  Indonesia  Work  for  the  Poor.  Washington,  DC  (page  207).  Targeting  of \nscholarships  was  determined  by  school  principals  and  school  committees,  while  the  health  cards  introduced  in \n1998 were targeted by district health offices through community identification of the poor. \n\n18 World Bank. 2006. Making the New Indonesia Work for the Poor. Washington, DC. \n\n\f9\n\nmeasure and regularly and accurately report results relating to MDG targets and deficit districts. \nThe division of responsibilities among different government agencies has constrained analyses, \nand  the  design  and  implementation  of  policy  actions  to  accelerate  achievement  of  the  MDGs. \nThe  failure  to  identify  appropriate  MDG-related  indicators  and  collect  accurate  data  are \nconstraints to the identification of MDG-deficit regions and districts and allocation of resources \nbased on needs and performance across sectors and regions. The lack of a comprehensive and \nregular  mechanism  for  the  compilation,  processing  and  analysis  of  MDG-related  data  has \ncontributed to gaps and weaknesses in the preparation of MDG reports. The central and local \ngovernments\u2019  lack  of  guidelines  and  knowledge  regarding  the  implications  of  adopting  MDG \ntargets has made it difficult to mainstream MDGs in the preparation of the annual and medium-\nterm  plans  and  budgets  of  the  ministries  and  districts,  and  in  the  poverty  reduction  strategies \nprepared  by  some  regional  governments.  A  comprehensive  roadmap  is  needed  to  accelerate \nachievement  of  the  MDGs  by  holistically  addressing  the  challenges  and  identifying  practical \nsolutions and priority sectors and areas. \n\nb. \n\nEducation Sector \n\nUnequal  Access  to  Basic  Education.  There  are  about  1.8  million  children  in  the \n32.\ncountry aged 13\u201315 who lack access to basic education. Achievement of the education-related \nMDG  targets  depends  upon  a  steady  increase  in  both  net  enrolment  and  completion  rates  at \nboth  the  primary  and  junior  secondary  levels.  More  critically,  it  depends  upon  increasing  the \ntransition rate from primary to junior secondary schools. Key factors affecting net enrolment and \ntransition  rates  include  (i)  substantial  cost  barriers  (e.g.  fees,  transport  cost,  textbooks, \nstationary, and uniforms); (ii) uneven coverage of facilities within and between districts; and (iii) \nperceptions about the relevance of the curriculum and future employability of school graduates. \n\n33. \nPoverty  is  a  major  barrier  to  completion  of  basic  education,  particularly  for  junior \nsecondary schools. Children from poor families either fail to enroll or drop out early, due to the \nphysical distance from educational facilities19 and cost of education, including uniforms, books, \nstationary  and  \u201cinformal\u201d  fees.  Financial  contributions  are  still  required,  and  can  take  creative \nforms, such as fines imposed on students, and regular requests for voluntary contributions and \n\u201cseat  fees\u201d.  In  2004,  about  44%  of  the  households  in  the  poorest  quintile  who  had  children \nenrolled  at  the  junior  secondary  level  reported  difficulties  in  financing  schools  fees;  they  paid \nabout  7%  of  total  household  expenditures  for  each  enrolled  student.  In  some  cases,  the \nopportunity  cost  of  school  attendance  is  too  high,  as  the  children  have  to  contribute  to \nhousehold income.\n\nSignificant disparities exist in the level of funding received by schools, and in spending \n34. \nper  student  across  districts.  In  2005,  the  Government  increased  the  funding  provisions  for \nschool  operations  and  maintenance  (O&M),  through  the  establishment  of  BOS,  based  on \nstudent  head  counts  for  all  schools.  BOS  is  addressing  some  of  these  disparities,  including \nindirectly reducing the need for parental contributions to school operating costs through informal \n\u201dfees\u201d. There are also infrastructure development needs, as the large number of primary schools \nbuilt  in  the 1970s  need  rehabilitation,  while  expansion  and rehabilitation  is  also  needed  at  the \njunior  secondary  level.20  Reducing  urban-rural  disparities  within  districts  and  income-related \ndisparities at the post primary level poses a significant challenge to achievement of the goal of \nuniversal basic education.  \n\n                                                \n19 There  are  significant  regional  disparities  in  the  average  distance  to  junior  secondary  schools,  which  ranges  from \n1.9 km in Java to 16.6 km in Papua. On average, transportation is an important cost for junior secondary students \nin the two poorest quintiles, and represents 17% of their total expenses for education; school fees account for 32% \nof education expenses. \n\n20 A survey from MONE in 2004 concluded that 27.3% of the classrooms in secondary schools were damaged. \n\n\f10\n\n35. \nAdoption  of  the  primary  and  junior  secondary  integrated  school  construction  strategy \nconstitutes  an  effective  approach  to  reducing  current  access  barriers,  especially  those  of \ndistance to school and related costs. A clearly defined implementation plan, including targeting \nand  eligibility  criteria  for  integrated  school  construction,  especially  in  under-served  areas,  is \ncritical if access policy targets are to be achieved. The introduction of the BOS also represents a \ncost-effective  strategy  for  indirectly  reducing  access-related  cost  barriers  and  maintaining \noperations.  However,  the  current  BOS  funding  levels  and  allocation  guidelines  are  not \nsufficiently robust. In the case of very poor families, BOS funding may be insufficient to sustain \ndemand  and  additional  scholarships  or  a  conditional  cash  transfer  (CCT)  scheme  will  be \nrequired.\n\n36. \nQuality,  Efficiency,  and  Effectiveness.  While  the  country\u2019s  education  and  training \nsystems  are  making  adjustments  to  respond  effectively  to  emerging  demographic  and  labor \nmarket  demands,  Indonesia\u2019s  national  average  educational  attainment  is  low  compared  to \nneighboring  countries.  In  2006,  pass  rates  in  junior  secondary  examinations  averaged  92% \n(ranging  from  65%  to  98%).  Student  examination  performance  varies  widely  across  districts, \nwith  pass  rates  in  poorer,  rural  and  remote  areas  consistently  below  average.  Education \noutcomes,  as  measured  by  international  programs  that  assess  student  skills  and  learning \nachievement across countries, confirm the low quality of education.21\n\nA  number  of  factors  contribute  to  low  and  uneven  quality  and  standards.  In  many \n37. \nschools and districts, public spending on education frequently covers only teacher salaries, with \nnon-personnel  operational  spending  accounting  for  as  little  as  5%\u201310%  of  spending  in  many \ndistricts.  Consequently,  there  are  frequent  shortages  of  funds  for  instructional  materials,  staff \ndevelopment  and  routine  maintenance  of  school  buildings.  Regional  differences  are \nexacerbated  by  the  wide  variation  in  provincial  and  district  local  revenues  and  expenditure \ncapacity, often resulting in wide variations in education standards between better and less well-\noff provinces and districts. \n\n38. \nThe  development  of  national  education  standards  and  progressive  application  of \nminimum  service  standards  (MSSs)  that  define  the  \u201cquality  and  quantity\u201d  of  critical  education \nservices,  linked  to  clearly  defined  responsibilities  at  provincial,  district  and  school  levels,  are \nrequired  to  improve  the  quality  of  basic  education.  Developing  a  small  number  of  measurable \nand  achievable  MSSs  on  critical  aspects  such  as  teacher  training  and  certification,  school \nfacilities  and  learning  materials  can  help  anchor  the  Government\u2019s  decentralized  strategy  to \nimprove access to and quality of education. The MSSs could also be used as a key criterion for \nbudget  prioritization  and  allocation,  and  the  indicators  selected  for  this  purpose  should  be \nclosely linked to the attainment of MDG 2. \n\n39.\nAnother  key  constraint  to  quality  improvement  is  the  significant  proportion  of  under-\nqualified teaching staff at all levels. In 2006, it was estimated that only 16.4% of primary school \nteachers and 59.1% of junior secondary teachers were qualified. Significant problems that need \nto be addressed to improve the quality of education services include (i) inequitable deployment \nof existing teachers within districts; (ii) teacher absenteeism (estimated at about 19%); and (iii) \nweak  expertise  of  teachers  in  priority  subject  areas,  such  as  math  and  science.  Special \nincentive programs need to be developed to attract teachers to remote areas. \n\n                                                \n21 In  2003,  the  Trends  in  International  Mathematics  and  Science  Study  (TIMSS),  and  the  Program  for  International \nStudent Assessment (PISA) revealed deficiencies in the standard of education among 12-year-olds and 15-year-\nolds, respectively.  \n\n\f11\n\nThe  challenge  is  to  adopt  and  implement  a  systemic  approach  to  addressing  these \n40. \nconstraints.  Strategic  options  to  improve  teacher  recruitment,  qualifications,  and  incentives  for \ndeployment  to  rural  schools,  including  madrasah,  are  currently  being  reviewed.  Alternative \napproaches  to  expanding  cost  effective  teacher  upgrading  systems  are  also  being  explored, \nwhile  national  standards  and  MSSs  for  priority  standards  are  under  preparation.  While  the \ndevelopment of MSSs provides an important basis for defining service standards, any definition \nof  performance  needs  to  make  the  link  between  service  delivery  and  the  quality  of  education \noutcomes at the district and school level. \n\nGovernance,  Transparency,  and  Accountability.  Although  both  the  Ministry  of \n41.\nNational Education (MONE) and the Ministry of Religious Affairs (MORA) are governed by the \nNational  Education  Law  of  2003,  each  ministry  has  formulated  separate  education  strategic \nplans22  with  different  financial  strategies,  due  to  their  different  roles  under  the  decentralized \nadministration.  Better  alignment  of  these  plans,  strategies  and  operations  in  support  of \neducation  service  delivery  at  the  district  level  is  needed.  Fragmentation  of  education  planning \nand  financial  management  systems  has  created  a  number  of  constraints  for  districts  and \nschools. The current system of multiple financial allocations\u2014by MONE, MORA, provinces, and \ndistricts\u2014makes  it  difficult  to  capture  all  financial  resources  received  by  each  school,  and \ncomplicates  the  preparation  by  districts  of  local  education  plans  and  budgets,  as  the  districts\u2019  \ntotal funding cannot be accurately predicted. Disparate policy objectives and priorities, financial \nmanagement systems, and reporting add to the confusion at the local level.  \n\n42. \nTo  balance  national  and  local  priorities,  mechanisms  for  coordination  of  local-level \nbudgeting,  planning  and  allocation  from  multiple  sources  need  to  be  improved,  as  does  the \nreliability and predictability of central-local funding transfers; to enable multi-year planning, the \ncriteria for such transfers need to be made more transparent. At the institutional level, there are \ntremendous  opportunities \nthrough  organizational \nrestructuring  and  retraining  at  all  levels  of  government,  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s \ndecentralization  policies  aimed  at  improving  the  planning,  financing  and  implementation  of \neducation  services.  While  the  role  of  MONE  as  a  policy-making,  standard-setting,  and \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  agency  is  now  being  articulated,  the  ministry  has  not  transformed \nitself sufficiently to be effective in this new role.  \n\nfor  enhancement  of  service  delivery \n\ntransparency  of  education  outcomes \n\nIncreased  resource  allocation  for  the  education  sector  should  be  accompanied  by \n43. \nimproved  governance,  to  ensure  accountability  in  the  use  of  these  resources,  and  to  reduce \ncorruption.  Greater \nthe \naccountability  of  schools  and  districts.  At  the  community  level,  the  role  and  effectiveness  of \neducation  boards  and  school  committees  as  governance  bodies  distinct  from  management \nstructures  is  still  evolving.  Most  of  these  committees  in  MONE-managed  schools  meet \ninfrequently\u2014only  about  20%  meet  at  least  once  a  month\u2014and  women\u2019s  participation  is  low. \nThe  situation  in  madrasah  is  reportedly  more  encouraging,  due  to  their  longer  tradition  of \ncommunity participation in school affairs.  \n\nis  required \n\nincrease \n\nto \n\nc. \n\nHealth Sector \n\nLimited  Access  to  MNCH  and  CDC  Health  Services  for  the  Poor  and  Women. \n44.\nIndonesia\u2019s  health  sector  has  been  under-funded  for  many  years,  resulting  in  the  gradual \nerosion  of  the  public  health  system  as  a  provider  of  both  preventive  and  curative  health \nservices.  Despite  significant  health  budget  increases  in  2003  and  2004,  Indonesia  remains \n\n                                                \n22 MONE. 2005. Medium Term Plan 2005\u20132009. Jakarta; and MORA. 2004. Madrasah Sector Assessment. Jakarta.\n\n\f12\n\nbehind  other  countries  in  the  region  with  similar  level  of  development.23  The  central  budget \nallocation  to  critical  MDG-related  MNCH  and  CDC  services  has  been  low,  and  a  significant \nportion of health subsidies have not benefited the poor. De-concentrated expenditure provided \nby MOH to the regions, which in 2004 represented about 33% of total public health expenditure, \ndid  not  particularly  target  the  poor  or  MDG-deficit  districts.  Furthermore,  some  local \ngovernments,  particularly  those  with  weak  fiscal  capacity,  allocate  insufficient  resources  for \nimproving MNCH and CDC services. Limited health-sector spending has resulted in low health \nfacility  density,  insufficient  funds  for  O&M,  limited  availability  of  drugs,  and  low  retention  of \npublic health staff.  \n\n45. \nPublic health services are underutilized, in particular by the poor and by women, due to: \n(i)  the  poor  quality  of  care  in  government  health  facilities;  (ii)  the  frequent  absence  of  health \nstaff; (iii) limited availability of drugs and supplies; (iv) high direct and indirect service costs; and \n(v)  the  low  density  of  government  health  facilities,  which  increases  the  distance  traveled  to \naccess  care.  Most  infant  deaths  occur  during  the  first  month  after  birth,  due  mainly  to  poor \nmaternal  health  and  nutrition,  the  poor  quality  of  MNCH  services,  and  the  healthcare-seeking \nbehavior  of  pregnant  women  and  their  families.  Only  14%  of  mothers  practice  exclusive \nbreastfeeding during the first 6 months after birth. While immunization rates of 12 to 23 month-\nold children increased in 2004 to about 90%, immunization dropout rates tend to be high among \nchildren from poorer households. Limited use of health services for prenatal and postnatal care, \nfamily  planning,  and  CDC  (for  diseases  such  as  malaria,  HIV/AIDS  and  TB)  affects  progress \ntowards achieving the health-related MDGs.  \n\nA significant reduction in maternal mortality24 requires a strategic focus on increasing the \n46. \npercentage  of  facility-based  deliveries  and  births  attended  by  skilled  midwives,  developing  an \nefficient  referral  system,  and  increasing  the  use  of  contraceptives.25  Only  72%  of  births  are \nattended  by  skilled  personnel,  compared  with  99%  in  Thailand  and  97%  in  Malaysia.  Women \nthat  deliver  in  health  facilities  have  better  access  to  emergency  or  referral  care  in  case  of \ncomplications. However, a majority of deliveries still occur in the home (about 60%). Access to \nhealth  facilities  or  professionally  trained  health  personnel  varies  between  regions  and  across \nsocioeconomic groups. Average distance to a midwife ranges from 12\u201330 km in Papua to 1.5 \nkm in Java and Bali.\n\n47. \nHIV/AIDS,  malaria,  and  TB  are  important  communicable  diseases  in  Indonesia,  which \naffect both child and maternal health. The current challenge is to reduce the current HIV epidemic \nin high-risk groups and to prevent its further spread into the general population. A major barrier to \nmalaria control is the cost of accessing impregnated bed nets. In Indonesia, CDC programs have \nbeen  organized  vertically,  resulting  in  fragmented  service  delivery.  Comprehensive  strategies \npromoting integrated health services that allow for sharing of resources or pooling of funds can \nsupport the containment and reversal of the TB and HIV/AIDS epidemics.  \n\n48. \nEven when MNCH and CDC services are locally available, many of the poor still suffer \nfrom  access  constraints  due  to  the  high  costs  of  health  care.  Out  of  pocket  expenditures\u2014 \nincluding user fees, the cost of drugs, and transportation\u2014are estimated to equal some 70% of \n\n                                                \n23 The  Philippines  spends  about  6%  of  the  total  government  budget  and  about  3.2%  of  its  GDP,  while  Thailand \n\nspends 13.6% of its budget and 3.3% of its GDP. \n\n24 The  main  causes  of  maternal  death  include  hemorrhaging  (25\u201345%),  eclampsia  (13%),  abortion  complications \n(11%), and post-natal infections (10%). Underlying factors that also contribute to maternal death include: (i) poor \nmaternal  nutrition,  such  as  iron-deficiency  anemia,  vitamin  A  deficiency,  and  protein-energy  malnutrition;  and  (ii) \ninfectious diseases, such as malaria, TB, hepatitis and HIV/AIDS. \n\n25 The  Government\u2019s  continuing  policy  has  limitations,  as  contraceptives  are  not  available  to  unmarried  women \n\nthrough public channels.  \n\n\f13\n\ntotal  health  expenditures.  The  opportunity  cost  for  women  is  higher  due  to  the  time  spent  on \nobtaining cost-effective health care for themselves and their children. Low education and lack of \ninformation  about  available  options  also  limits  utilization  of  health  services  by  the  poor  and \nwomen.\n\n49. \nThe  ASKESKIN  program  addresses  some  of  these  constraints  by  removing  the  cost \nbarriers to accessing health services by the poor and near-poor, especially women. The program \nhas  two  components.  The  first  component  provides  free  healthcare  services  at  public  health \ncenters (puskesmas) and the second provides inpatient treatment in \u201cthird class\u201d hospitals for the \npoor.  The  program  is  demand-oriented  and  responds  to  utilization  rates  of  health  services. \nASKESKIN benefits are comprehensive (including generic drugs), and there are no deductibles or \nco-payments.  In  spite  of  the  initial  success  of  ASKESKIN,  further  information  and  evaluation  of \nprogram impacts are required on (i) utilization rates of health services by type of service, profile of \nusers,  and  amounts  expended  by  districts  to  complement  the  program;  and  (ii)  opportunities  to \nprovide feedback to providers on the quality of care rendered through services delivered.  \n\nPoor Quality, Efficiency, and Effectiveness of Health Service Delivery. Government \n50.\nhealth  providers  often  lack  incentives  to  work  in  remote  areas  and  to  provide  services  in \nsufficient  quantity  and  quality,  especially  for  the  poor.  It  is  reported  that  government  health \nworkers are frequently  absent from their posts.26 The national aggregate ratios of doctors and \nmidwives to the population are below the 2010 Healthy Indonesia targets, and much lower than \nfound  in  other  countries  in  the  region.  There  are  only  13  doctors  and  200  midwives  for  every \n100,000 people. There are also significant variations in the distribution of health personnel per \ncapita between regions. For example, there are 30\u201340 doctors per 100,000 population in North \nSulawesi  and  Bali,  compared  with  just  6  per  100,000  in  Lampung  and  East  Java.  Some \nprovinces  only  have  20  midwives  per  100,000  people.27  MOH  has  implemented  several \nprograms  in  the  past  to  improve  the  distribution  of  doctors  and  midwives  to  remote  and \nunderserved areas. However, these programs have faced challenges in retaining and motivating \nhealth  service  providers.  They  have  also  failed  to  significantly  improve  the  distribution  or \nretention  of  providers  in  poor  or  remote  areas  due  to  insufficient  incentives  and  resulting  low \nlevels of remuneration, poor housing, and a lack of water and sanitation facilities. \n\n51. \nThe ASKESKIN program has the potential to modify its reimbursement methods to better \nmotivate  providers  to  deliver  key  MDG-related  services.  Under  this  program,  MOH  has \ncontracted  PT  Askes,  a  parastatal,  to  reimburse  hospitals  on  a  fee-for-services  basis  for  both \ninpatient  and  outpatient  care.  The  program  also  reimburses  community  health  centers,  mainly \non  a  capitation  basis,  without  any  performance-based  incentives.28  As  a  third-party,  PT  Askes \ncould  provide  a  higher  capitation  to  facilities  that  increase  their  productivity  or  achieve  other \nperformance  targets,  especially  those  linked  to  MDG-related  health  services.  Public-private \npartnerships  to  better  manage  health  services  could  also  help  motivate  providers  through \nperformance-based initiatives, and yield improved access to affordable and quality health care, \nespecially by the poor and women. \n\nPoor Performance and Accountability of Local Governments and Health Providers. \n52.\nMOH issued a decree in 2003 pertaining to 26 types of MSSs, and including 54 indicators, which \n\n                                                \n26 Choudhury, Nazmul, Jeffrey Hammer, Michael Kremer, Karthik Muralidharan, and F. Halsey Rogers. 2005. Missing \nin Action: Teacher and Health Worker Absence in Developing Countries. Journal of Economic Perspectives 20 (1): \n91\u2013116. It was reported that about 40% of government health staff in community health centers were absent from \nfacilities for reasons other than off-site duties. \n\n27 World  Bank.  2007.

Significant  challenges  have  been  encountered  in \nimplementing the MSSs at the local level, however, due to the (i) excessive number of services \ncovered,  (ii)  type  of  indicators  used,  (iii)  level  at  which  the  standards  are  set,  (iv)  lack  of  clarity \nabout  the  obligatory  functions  of  each  level  of  government,  and  (v)  lack  of  guidelines  for  local \ngovernments on how to implement the MSSs. The enactment of Government Regulation No. 65 in \n2005,  establishing  guidelines  for  the  development  and  implementation  of  MSSs,  and  the \nsubsequent MOHA regulation in 2007 providing guidance to line ministries, are positive steps to \nsolve  some  of  these  problems.  But  much  work  still  needs  to  be  done  to  refine  and  reduce  the \nnumber  of  health-related  MSSs,  so  as  to  clearly  define  the  \u201cquantity  and  quality\u201d  of  health \nservices, and the roles and responsibilities of the various levels of government. \n\nProviding  increased  public  funding  for  health  is  a  necessary  step  to  improve  MDG-\n53. \nrelated  performance.  But  improvements  are  needed  in  the  way  additional  resources  are \nchanneled to poor and under-performing localities, and to the poor themselves. One method is \nto  channel  additional  resources  through  demand-side  mechanisms  that  target  the  poor,  while \nstrengthening accountability between the service provider and client, so as to reduce the large \ndifferentials  in  most  MDG-related  impact  and  intermediate  indicators,  both  across  regions  and \nbetween  socioeconomic  groups.  The  recently  established  ASKESKIN  program  moves  in  the \nright direction, because it: (i) targets the poor with substantial additional resources; (ii) channels \nthe  resources  to  a  third-party  payer  (PT  Askes),  rather  than  directly  to  providers;  and  (iii) \nexpands  the  range  of  providers  eligible  for  reimbursement  to  the  non-governmental  sector, \nincluding village midwives.  \n\nTransparency, Monitoring and Evaluation. Health care in Indonesia is provided by a \n54.\ncomplex  combination  of  government  and  private  sector  entities.  Very  little  information  is \ncurrently available at the provincial and central levels on the use of local government resources \nin  the  health  sector,  including  resources  provided  by  MOH. In  such  an  environment,  policy \nmakers need reliable information on the sources and uses of funds to enable (i) better planning, \n(ii)  more  accurate  financial  projections  of  health  sector  requirements,  and  identification  of \nopportunities for improvement. The establishment of a national health accounts (NHAs) program \nwould facilitate analysis and tracking of public health expenditures.  \n\n2. \n\nLessons Identified \n\n55. \nRecent  evaluations  and  lessons  from  ADB,  the  World  Bank  and  other  development \npartners  active  in  program  lending,  including  for  social  sectors,29  have  recommended  that:  (i) \npolicy frameworks should not be complex or unrealistic, as this makes them difficult to implement; \n(ii) the program should focus on a few key policy outputs; (iii) the design of policy initiatives should \nbe robust yet flexible enough to withstand a change in government; (iv) policy actions should be \nspecific,  measurable,  and  linked  to  policy  outputs  and  outcomes;  (v)  programmatic  approaches \nand  program  clusters  spread  along  a  medium-term  framework  can  be  effective  in  tackling  (a) \ncomplex  policy  reform  areas  and  (b)  overcoming  a  scarcity  of  information;  (vi)  reforms  must  be \nphased  and  fully  aligned  with  the  country\u2019s  broader  medium-term  development  agenda;  (vii) \n\n                                                \n29 The  relevant  evaluation  studies  include,  among  others:  (i)  ADB.  2001.

Lessons  identified  from  social  sector  programs  loans  are  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. \n\n\f15\n\ndevelopment  partners  should  work  in  a  harmonized  and  coordinated  manner  on  policy  advice; \nand (viii) a well-defined monitoring and evaluation system, including specific timeframes, must be \nestablished. \n\nReforms in the social sectors are complex, as there are important political and economic \n56. \nconsiderations,  and  responsibilities  are  divided  across  a  number  of  line  ministries,  agencies, \nand  national  and  local  government  jurisdictions.  The  evaluation  findings  for  ADB\u2019s  health  and \nnutrition and social protection sector development programs in Indonesia, which were rated as \nsuccessful, recognized the complexity of the reforms. A study of the World Bank\u2019s experience \nwith social sector program lending revealed that while the overall effectiveness and outcomes of \nsocial  development  projects  compares  favorably  with  other  sectors,  providing  integrated \nattention to social development themes under program lending led to better implementation and \nmore  sustainable  social  benefits.  However,  reforms  may  take  time  and  must  be  undertaken \nwithin a medium-term framework.\n\n57. \nThe  Government  has  made  accelerated  achievement  of  the  MDGs  a  key  pillar  of  its \nagenda,  and  has  demonstrated  to  continue  undertaking  the  necessary  reforms.  The  PRMAP  is \nfully anchored in the Government\u2019s RPJM, meaning there is strong ownership by the relevant line \nministries  and  the  oversight  agencies  (e.g.  BAPPENAS,  the  Coordinating  Ministry  of  Social \nWelfare  [Menko  Kesra],  and  MOF).  The  reform  agenda  is  broad  and  challenging  as  it  covers \nseveral social sectors, emphasizing the need for flexibility in reform implementation. Based on the \nabove considerations, a program cluster modality is proposed for the PRMAP. \n\n3. \n\nCoordination with the Development Partners \n\nPRMAP  has  been  designed  in  close  coordination  with  several  development  partners. \n58. \nThe  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  has  provided  direct  support, \nactively  participated  in  the  design  of  the  program,  and  will  cofinance  the  TA  supporting  it. \nCoordination has been undertaken with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in \npreparing common approaches to support the Government in establishing a national framework \nfor MDG acceleration. Separate meetings were conducted with the main development partners \nworking in the education and health sectors, particularly the World Bank, to ensure coordination \nand  complementarity  of  approaches  and  avoid  duplication  of  efforts.  The  IMF  was  also \nconsulted on the macroeconomic impacts of PRMAP. The design of the PRMAP policy reforms \nwas shared and discussed on several occasions with the education sector working group, and \nwith  relevant  development  partners  in  the  health  sector  to  ensure  complementarity  and \nagreement,  and  avoid  duplication.30  The  development  partners  coordination  matrix,  outlining \nsupport in areas related to the PRMAP, is in Appendix 4. The list of external assistance to the \nhealth and education sectors is presented in Supplementary Appendix D. \n\n4. \n\nADB Strategy \n\n59. \nADB committed to the MDGs in 2002. ADB\u2019s Enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy and \nthe  Medium-Term  Strategy  II  for  2006\u20132008  provide  the  broad  framework  for  ADB\u2019s \nengagement and support to MDG acceleration and attainment in the region. At an operational \nlevel, ADB is committed to assisting its developing member countries integrate the MDGs into \n\n                                                \n30 ADB,  World  Bank,  AusAID,  Government  of  the  Netherlands,  and  European  Commission  are  the  principal \ndevelopment  partners  in  the  education  sector  while  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  fur  Technishe \nZusammenarbeit  (GTZ),  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO),  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment  (USAID),  AusAID,  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  and  the  Joint  United  Nations \nProgramme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) are the main partners in the health sector. \n\n\f16\n\ntheir national poverty reduction strategies and to monitor their progress.31 In 2004, ADB, UNDP \nand the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific embarked on \na  regional  partnership  to  support  monitoring  of  MDG  progress,  raise  awareness,  develop \ncapacity  and  improve  policies  and  institutions  related  to  achievement  of  the  MDGs.  Several \nregional reports32 and technical papers have been produced, improvements have been made to \nthe  MDG  database,  and  dissemination  and  advocacy  activities  have  been  conducted.  ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and program (CSP) for Indonesia 2006\u2013200933 identifies MDG acceleration as \none of its five strategic areas of engagement. PRMAP will be a key input to the realization of this \nstrategy  and  the  achievement  of  the  objectives  under  Pillar  II:  Social  development,34  by \nsupporting improvement of the quantity and quality of social service delivery. \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM\n\nImpacts and Outcome. The PRMAP impacts will be to accelerate progress in achieving \n60.\nthe MDGs in education (MDG 2), and health (MDGs 4, 5, 6), and contribute to the Government\u2019s \npoverty  reduction  (MDG  1)  and  gender  equality  (MDG  3)  agendas.  The  program\u2019s  outcome  is \nimproved access, equity, and quality of service delivery in the education and health sectors to \naccelerate  progress  toward  the  MDGs.  It  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s national priorities, as reflected in the existing RPJM. 35\n\nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n61. \nThe  program  will  assist  the  Government  in  reorienting  fiscal  expenditures  to  the  social \nsectors  and  undertaking  much-needed  policy  reforms  related  to  three  key  areas:  access  and \nequity, quality, and governance. PRMAP will include three main pillars with the following policy \noutputs:\n\nCross-Sectoral  Reforms.  PRMAP  will  support  and  enhance  strategic  government-led \n62.\nreform initiatives, which will result in: (i) increased budget allocations for health and education, \nfocused  on  MDG-related  programs;  (ii)  improved  performance  incentives  and  geographical \nresource  allocations  to  districts  for  education  and  health;  (iii)  a  uniform  system  for  targeting \nMDG-related health and education services to the poor households; (iv) gender equity in access \nto health and education services; and (v) a planning framework for MDG acceleration. \n\nPolicy Reforms in the Education Sector for MDG Acceleration. PRMAP will support \n63.\nthe Government\u2019s objective of universal basic education leading to: (i) improved access to junior \nsecondary  schools  in  under-served  areas;  (ii)  improved  O&M  support  for  smaller/remote \nschools;  (iii)  increased  affordability  of  education  by  poor  students  and/or  households;  (iv) \nenhanced  quality  and  equitable  deployment  of  teachers;  (v)  education  service  delivery  that \nmeets MSSs; (vi) improved planning and implementation of education services; and (vii) greater \ntransparency of education outcomes to enhance accountability. \n\n                                                \n31 ADB.  2004.

The  PRMAP  supports \n64.\nthe Government\u2019s reform agenda, which seeks to expand and improve the equity and quality of \nMDG-related  health  services  for  the  poor,  in  order  to  (i)  increase  public  financing  for  MDG-\nrelated  health  programs,  (ii) improve  targeting  of  public  health  financing  for  the  poor,  (iii) \nimprove effectiveness of MNCH and reproductive health service delivery by influencing provider \nbehavior,  (iv)  improve  effectiveness  of  CDC  through  integrated  programs,  (v)  improve \nmonitoring  of  MDG-related  health  performance,  and  (vi)  improve  information  with  regard  to \nMDG-related health expenditures.\n\n1. \n\nCross-Sectoral Policy Reforms \n\nPolicy Objective (PO) 1: Increased Budget Allocation for MDG-Related Health and \n65.\nEducation.  The  Government  has  recognized  the  need  to  increase  overall  social  sector \nexpenditures  if  it  is  to  achieve  its  ambitious  poverty  reduction  and  MDG  acceleration  targets. \nThe  2007  PER  showed  that  health  and  education  expenditures  have  increased  significantly. \nBetween  2004  and  2006,  real  national  public  expenditure36  on  education  increased  by  53% \n(from  Rp49.8  trillion  [$  5.5  billion]  to  Rp76.2  trillion  [$8.3  billion],  while  expenditure  on  health \nincreased by 50% (from Rp13.2 trillion [$1.4 billion] to Rp19.8 trillion [$2.2 billion]). During the \nsame period spending on education as a percentage of total public expenditure increased from \n14.2% to 17.2%, while health spending increased from 3.8% to 4.5%. As a percentage of GDP, \nspending  on  education  increased  from  2.8%  to  3.6%  of  GDP,  and  on  health  from  0.73%  to \n0.95%.  Between  2005  and  2006,  most  of  the  increases  from  the  central  government  budget \nwere allocated to programs that benefit the poor, such as the BOS, which increased from Rp5.1 \ntrillion ($543 million) to Rp10.2 trillion ($1.1  billion), and the ASKESKIN, which increased from \nRp2.3  trillion  ($245  million)  to  Rp3.6  trillion  ($383  million).  These  programs  represented  about \n25%  of  the  overall  central  education  and  health  budgets.  The  budget  allocations  for  these  or \nsimilar  programs  are  expected  to  be  sustained  in  the  coming  years;  projected  2007  public \nexpenditures  on  education  and  health  will  represent  about  3.9%  and  1.09%  of  GDP, \nrespectively.\n\n2004 \n63.1 \n49.8 \n(8.4) \n14.2 \n2.8 \n\nTable 1: National Public Expenditurea\n(Rp trillion) \n2001 \n40.5 \n40.5 \n40.3 \n11.4 \n2.4 \n\nEducation \nNominal Expenditures \nReal Expenditures (2001 prices) \nAnnual Growth of Real Expenditures (%) \nAs % of Total National Expenditures \nAs % of GDP \nHealth  \nNominal Expenditures \nReal Expenditures (2001 prices) \nAnnual Growth of Real Expenditures (%) \nAs % of Total National Expenditures \nAs % of GDP \nGDP = gross domestic product, Rp = rupiah. \na  National public expenditures includes spending by central, provincial and district governments. \nb  Preliminary result and estimates of subnational allocations. \nc  Estimates based on the approved Government budget for 2007. \nSource: World Bank, Ministry of Finance, and Badan Perancanaan Pembangunan Nasional; World Bank. 2007. \nIndonesia Public Expenditure Review.

The Government has significantly increased the size and \n                                                \n36 Includes central, provincial, and district government expenditures. \n\n\f18\n\nscope of the DAK targeted for the health and education sectors. From 2004 to 2007, the total \nDAK allocation for education and health increased sevenfold, with DAK allocations for education \nincreasing from $71 million to $569 million, and health allocations increasing from $50 million to \n$370  million.  These  increases  will  provide  additional  resources  to  specific  districts  for  the \nrehabilitation  of  schools  and  health  centers  and  the  purchase  of  equipment  and  facilities,  and \nare expected to contribute to increased access and quality of services. The modification of the \nDAK technical criteria for education and health in 2006 offers an opportunity to attract and retain \neducation and health personnel to remote areas, as districts are now allowed to use DAK funds \nfor (i) the procurement of medical and non-medical equipment in health clinics and furniture in \nschools; (ii) the construction and rehabilitation of water and sanitation facilities; and (iii) housing \nfor school teachers, doctors, nurses, and midwives. \n\nProblems remain with the existing DAK allocation formula, however. The current system \n67. \ndoes  not  provide  operational  expenditures  for  health  and  education,  or  incentives  for  the \ndistricts to improve their performance in service delivery, both of which are keys to accelerating \nMDG attainment. Improvements are also necessary in the horizontal distribution of resources, to \nensure districts most in need are targeted. In addition, significant efforts are required to improve \nmonitoring systems to track the use of the DAK at the district level.  \n\n68. \nReform  of  the  DAK  is  under  way  to  transform  it  into  a  more  relevant  instrument  for \nearmarking funds to specific districts with insufficient health and education resources. Measures \nfor  the  improvement  of  the  DAK  are  included  in  the  National  Action  Plan  on  Fiscal \nDecentralization.  MOF  and  BAPPENAS,  in  coordination  with  the  Regional  Autonomy  Advisory \nCouncil, are formulating recommendations to strengthen the DAK framework, improve the fund \ndistribution  criteria  among  districts,  and  promote  accountability.  The  recommendations  will \ninclude  suggestions  for  vertical  and  horizontal  allocation  and  development  of  conditions  to \nsuccessfully  support  achievement  of  the  MDGs  at  the  local  government  level.  MOHA  is  also \npreparing  a  regulation  on  performance  evaluation  of  local  governments,  which  could  include \nfinancial incentives to reward or penalize local governments based on performance. MONE and \nMOH,  in  coordination  with  MOF,  will  assess  options  for  including  mechanisms  in  the  DAK \ntechnical guidelines to allocate resources more equitably to districts, and to include incentives to \ndistricts  to  improve  performance  relative  to  MDG-related  indicators.  PRMAP  will  support \ninitiatives seeking to increase access and equity, and the implementation of performance-based \nallocation of resources at national and district levels, in order to improve accountability in health \nand education program implementation. \n\nPO 3: Establishment of a Uniformed System for Targeting the Poor. BAPPENAS, with \n69.\nthe BPS, MOH, and MONE, has prepared guidelines for the establishment of a mass database of \npoor  and  near-poor  households  for  a  new  poverty  reduction  program,  the  Program  Keluarga \nHarapan (PKH), which plans to provide conditional cash transfers (CCTs) to 500,000 households \nin its initial phase in 2007.37 The database will improve the previous one developed for the former \nunconditional  cash  transfers  program  that  used  a  combination  of  geographic  and  household \ntargeting  techniques.  The  focus  of  the  PKH  on  poverty  reduction  and  on  improving  access  to \nMDG-related  health  and  education  services  fosters  dialogue  among  the  key  stakeholders\u2014\nBAPPENAS,  BPS,  MONE,  MORA  and  MOH\u2014and  raises  the  possibility  that  MOH,  MONE  and \nMORA  may  adopt  a  uniform  targeting  system  for  improving  access  by  the  poor  to  other  MDG-\nrelated  education  and  health  initiatives.  Establishment  of  a  uniform  targeting  system  will  help \nimprove  coverage  of  MDG-related  health  and  education  programs  for  the  poor  and  reduce \n\n                                                \n37 To cover selected sub-districts in seven provinces in its pilot phase, the Government has allocated about $1 billion \nfor this program in 2007. The program will provide cash transfers to the poor, conditional on families enrolling and \nkeeping children in schools and utilizing health services, vaccinations, and other MNCH programs.  \n\n\f19\n\nleakages  to  the  non-poor.  Although  the  initial  costs  of  developing  a  uniform  database  may  be \nsignificant,  in  the  longer  term  it  will  provide  savings  by  avoiding  duplication  of  effort  by  multiple \nagencies, and improving transparency.  \n\nPO 4: Achievement of Gender Equity in Access to Health and Education Services. \n70.\nThe  PRMAP  supports  the  Government\u2019s  gender  mainstreaming  efforts  pursuant  to  Presidential \nInstruction  No.  9/2000  and  subsequent  health  and  education  ministerial  regulations  and  sector \naction  plans.  In  2006,  BAPPENAS  completed  an  evaluation  on  the  status  of  gender \nmainstreaming  in  nine  sectors,  including  health  and  education.38  Recommendations  focused  on \nstrengthening policies, institutional frameworks, information systems and human resources within \neach of the sectors to support gender equity. MOH has responded to the evaluation by issuing a \nMinisterial Decree, which outlines steps to be taken to improve gender mainstreaming within the \nministry, including the appointment of directors for gender mainstreaming under each directorate. \nMONE, in its commitment to implement Education for All, includes a chapter on gender equality,39\nand  the  topic  is  featured  in  other  sections  on  formal  and  non-formal  education.  A  joint \nmemorandum  of  understanding  was  signed  in  2006  between  MONE,  the  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s \nEmpowerment (MOWE), and MOHA to increase efforts to lower adult illiteracy rates, particularly \nfor females. The RPJM includes a commitment to lower illiteracy rates to 5% by 2009. This policy \naction  builds  on  the  National  Literacy  Movement  for  Indonesia,  launched  by  the  President  in \nDecember  2004,  which  seeks  to  strengthen  cooperation  on  literacy  within  communities  and \nbetween various levels of government, and promote the importance of literacy through awareness \nprograms. \n\n71. \nDespite  Government  efforts  to  mainstream  gender,  the  lack  of  information  on  gender-\nrelated  MDGs  remains  a  challenge.  Sex-disaggregated  key  health  and  education  indicators  are \nneeded  to  better  monitor  progress  on  the  gender-related  MDGs,  and  to  target  resources  more \nefficiently for accelerated attainment of the MDGs. Some health and education indicators that are \nalready disaggregated by sex may require additional proxy indicators to improve monitoring and \nreporting  (e.g.,  immunization  coverage  or  percentage  of  births  attended  by  skilled  personnel). \nAdditional indicators could be considered, such as: (i) primary completion rates for boys and girls \n(MDG  2);  (ii)  under-5  mortality  rates  for  girls  and  boys  (MDG  4);  and  (iii)  percentage  of  all \nreproductive-age  women  and  their  sexual  partners  using  modern  contraceptives  (MDG  6). \nInclusion of an agreed set of sex-disaggregated indicators in the medium-term development plans \nof  MONE,  MORA  and  MOH  would  help  mainstream  gender  issues  relating  to  health  and \neducation in the planning and budgeting processes.  \n\nPO 5: A Planning Framework for MDG Acceleration is Established. The RPJM and \n72.\nthe  SNPK  include  the  MDGs  as  a  key  element,  and  recognize  the  need  for  mainstreaming \nMDGs  at  the  local  government  level.  The  Government  presented  the  2005  MDG  Progress \nReport  at  the  UN  General  Assembly  in  September  2005.  Guidelines  need  to  be  developed  to \nassist local governments and sector agencies, such as education and health, to mainstream the \nMDGs  in  their  development  and  sector  plans  and  budgets.  Plans  for  the  preparation  of  a \ncomprehensive  roadmap  for  MDG  acceleration  could  include  strategies  for:  (i)  developing  a \nflexible  institutional  framework  for  the  accelerated  achievement  of  the  MDGs  involving  key \ncentral  government  ministries  and  local  governments;  (ii)  increasing  political  and  public \nawareness about the MDGs; (iii) involving civil society, private sector and research institutions in \nefforts  to  attain  the  MDGs;  (iv)  improving  data  collection,  processing  and  monitoring \nmechanisms,  and  reporting  of  MDG-related  indicators;  (v)  assessing  cost  and  budget \n\n                                                \n38 MONE. 2005.

Jakarta.\n\n\f20\n\nimplications  for  the  achievement  of  the  MDGs;  and  (vi)  developing  sectoral  policies  for \nconsideration by government ministries in their medium-term development plans. \n\n2. \n\nEducation Sector Reforms \n\nThe  PRMAP  supports  education  policy  reforms  to  address  key  access,  equity  and \n73. \nquality constraints as outlined in MONE\u2019s medium term plan (2005\u20132009) and MORA\u2019s strategic \nplan.  The  plans  respond  to  the  priorities  outlined  in  the  RPJM,  the  SNPK,  and  Indonesia\u2019s \ninternational commitments. The MONE and MORA plans organize education strategies, targets, \nand programs under three main policies: (i) expansion of access and equity; (ii) improvement of \nquality,  efficiency,  and  effectiveness;  and  (iii)  improvement  of  governance,  transparency,  and \naccountability.  Major  priorities  include  (i)  achieving  the  goal  of  universal  access  to  9  years  of \nbasic  education  by  2009;  (ii)  expanding  gross  enrolment  rates  in  senior  secondary  education; \n(iii)  raising  education  standards  and  relevance  at  all  levels,  including  through  efficient  teacher \npreparation  and  deployment;  (iv)  strengthening  results-oriented  education  governance  and \nmanagement  systems,  especially  at  district  and  school/institutional  levels;  and  (v)  improved \nresults orientation of sector planning and monitoring systems.\n\na. \n\nExpand  Equitable  Access  to  Basic  Education  Particularly  for  the \nPoor\n\nThe Government\u2019s key strategies for enabling equitable access to basic education include \n74. \n(i)  an  expanded  junior  secondary  school  construction  program  in  under-served  areas;  (ii) \nreduction of direct and indirect cost barriers through the expansion of school operational budgets; \nand (iii) expansion of primary and junior secondary school programs for school dropouts. \n\nPO  6: Improved  Access  to  Junior  Secondary  Education  in  Underserved  Areas.  A \n75.\nnumber  of  challenges  need  to  be  addressed  to  reduce  access  barriers.  A  priority  is  the \nconstruction  of  new  junior  secondary  schools  and/or  madrasah,  especially  in  districts  with  low \nenrolment.  The  introduction  of  one-roof  schools  (combined  primary  and  junior  secondary \nschools  on  the  same  site)  is  designed  to  reduce  primary  grade  dropout  and  repetition,  and \nincrease  transition  rates  to  junior  secondary  education.  Implementation  of  these  initiatives  will \nreduce  the  distance  to  junior  secondary  schools  and  consequent  travel  costs,  which  are \nimportant  obstacles  for  the  poor.  Between  2005  and  2007  MONE  and  MORA  allocated  Rp \n4.252  billion  ($465  million)  for  the  establishment  of  2,416  integrated  schools,  and  the \nconstruction  of  1,345  new  junior  secondary  schools  and  32,921  new  classrooms  in  existing \njunior  secondary  schools.  This  initiative  is  also  expected  to  have  a  positive  impact  on \nmaintaining  or  increasing  the  number  of  girls  attending  junior  secondary  schools  and/or \nmadrasah in regions where female enrolment is low. MORA continues to invest in the poorest \ncommunity-run schools. \n\n76.  While  considerable  investments  are  planned  by  both  MONE  and  MORA  for  school \ninfrastructure,  improved  targeting  and  utilization  of  facilities  is  also  required.  Under  SP2,  local \ngovernments  will  undertake  participatory  school  mapping  with  local  communities  to  better \nunderstand  and  respond  to  demand-side  issues.  Participatory  school  mapping  is  a  departure \nfrom purely technical, geographic information system- (GIS) based school mapping. While GIS-\nmapping  can  accurately  identify  the  optimum  location  of  schools,  based  on  demographic  and \nspatial data, it may not alert governments to the underlying socioeconomic factors that prevent \nchildren  from  attending  school,  despite  the  provision  of  physical  facilities.  Increasing  the  local \nownership  of  and  stake  in  school  construction  and  rehabilitation  will  lower  construction  costs, \nand  improve  utilization  of  facilities.  This  will  yield  better  returns  on  the  investments  made  in \nschool infrastructure development under SP3. \n\n\f21\n\nPO 7: Improved O&M Support for Smaller and Remote Schools and Elimination of \n77.\nFees. The introduction of the BOS in 2005 and its expansion in 2006 and 2007 provides funds \nto  cover  school  O&M  and  indirectly  eliminate  school  fees.  All  public  and  private  schools  are \neligible for the program. The BOS program provides block grants to schools based on student \nhead  counts.  It  has  covered  about 29.5  million students  at the  primary  and  11.7  million  at  the \njunior  secondary  level.  The  program  provides  about  $25  per  year  for  primary  school  students \nand $35 per year for junior secondary students. The provision of funds based on student head \ncount  provides  incentives  to  schools  to  expand  their  coverage  area  and  overall  student \nnumbers. The program has been successful in improving the predictability of school financing, \nand  providing  reliable  support  to  schools.  Its  simple  design  has  rendered  the  program  highly \ntransparent, at least down to the school management level. \n\nBOS does need some improvement and refinement, however, if it is to be transformed \n78. \ninto a more targeted and efficient instrument, particularly for small, remote schools and for those \nwith many poor students. A key policy action under SP2 will be a comprehensive review of the \nallocation  policy  and  financing  and  implementation  of  BOS  and  other  O&M  support  programs. \nThe review will consider whether any special assistance programs need to be developed for the \npoorest districts, taking into account (i) regional differences in costs; (ii) school size differences \nin fixed and variable costs; (iii) the indirect impacts of BOS in decreasing school fees or other \ncontributions  from  the  poor;  (iv)  the  costs  associated  with  meeting  priority  MSSs,  such  as  for \nlearning  materials  and  teacher  training;  and  (v)  findings  from  internal  audit  reports.  While  the \nGovernment recognizes that a more pro-poor allocation policy for O&M assistance needs to be \ndeveloped for smaller, more remote or poorer schools, preferential allocations under BOS need \nto be closely monitored and supported under SP2. Under SP3, it is expected that a revised BOS \nallocation policy for poor and remote districts will be implemented. \n\nPO 8: Increased Affordability of Education by Poor Students/Households. In 2006, \n79.\ntransition scholarships were introduced to improve NERs in junior secondary schools and help \npoor primary school graduates meet the costs of entering junior secondary. About 147,000 poor \nstudents  received  scholarships.  Under  SP2,  scholarships  will  be  expanded  to  enable  poor \nstudents meet the direct and opportunity costs of education. Plans are underway to pilot a CCT \nscheme  to  improve  demand  for  education  and  increase  primary  to  junior  secondary  transition \nand  retention  rates  among  the  poor.  Under  SP3,  these  financial  support  programs  to  improve \nenrollments and retention of students will be evaluated to improve the design and targeting of \npro-poor programs.\n\nb. \n\nImprove Basic Education Quality, Efficiency, and Effectiveness \n\n80. \nKey  government  strategies  to  improve  quality,  relevance  and  effectiveness  include  (i) \nintroduction  and  implementation  of  new  teacher  professionalism  and  quality  assurance \nstandards,  through  new  legislation  and  organizational  reform  at  central,  provincial  and  district \nlevels; (ii) review of teacher utilization and deployment norms, incorporating potential measures \nto  increase  non-salary  operational  spending,  especially  on  instructional  materials  and  school \nmaintenance;  and  (iii)  expansion  of  education  standards-setting  and  monitoring  systems \nthrough the establishment of the Board of National Education Standards (BSNP). \n\nPO  9: Enhanced  Quality  and  Equitable  Deployment  of  Teachers.  Law  14  on \n81.\nTeachers  and  Lectures  was  approved  in  December  2005.  The  Law  makes  provision  for  a \ndoubling  by  2015  of  teacher  remuneration  through  professional  incentive  awards.  Teachers \nworking in remote areas will also receive a special allowance. Two regulations to implement the \nprovisions of the law for the professional development and incentive structures for teachers and \nlecturers are currently under preparation. The legislation includes a strategy for providing salary \n\n\f22\n\nand  non-salary  incentives  to  boost  the  deployment  of  teachers  to  under-served  areas.  It  also \nincludes  measures  related  to  management  and  quality  assurance  of  teachers  and  other \neducational  personnel,  including  school  directors,  and  for  strengthening  teacher  performance \nmonitoring and quality assurance systems. Given the scale of teacher upgrading required, the \ndesign  of  cost-efficient and  sustainable  professional  development  programs  and  incentives  for \ndeployment  in  under-served  areas  are  an  urgent  priority  and  will  be  developed  under  SP2. \nUnder SP3, both MONE and MORA will publish a report on teacher deployment to under-served \nareas.\n\nPO  10: Education  Service  Delivery  Meeting  MSSs.  A  number  of  key  regulatory \n82.\nactions have recently been taken to set the foundation for education reform, which will lead to \nincreased accountability of district governments and schools to deliver higher quality education. \nAn  independent  BSNP  was  established  in  mid-2005  through  issuance  of  Regulation  19/2005. \nBSNP  has  developed  legislation  on  \u201cStandards  on  Content\u201d  (Regulation  No  22/2006),  and \n\u201cStandards on Competence\u201d (Regulation No 22/2006). Regulation No. 24/2006 has been issued \nto  clarify  the  roles  of  different  levels  of  government  in  the  implementation  of  these  standards. \nThe development, approval and monitoring of national education standards in eight key areas is \nexpected  to  be  completed  under  SP2.  With  TA  support  from  ADB  and  the  European \nCommission, MONE is also planning to develop MSSs for critical national standards relevant to \nthe achievement of the education-related MDGs, to be applied at the district level. Under SP3, it \nis expected that MSSs in at least two categories of national standards, especially those related \nto teachers, facilities, and learning materials, will be implemented by selected districts.40\n\nc. \n\nGovernance, Transparency, and Accountability. \n\nPO  11:\n\nImproved  Planning  and  Implementation  of  Education  Services.  The \n83.\nGovernment  has  demonstrated  high-level  leadership  and  ownership  of  the  education  reform \nprogram.  A  joint  plan  for  the  achievement  of  9-year  basic  education  (Grand  Design  for  Basic \nEducation [2006\u20132009]) was completed by MONE and MORA in August 2006. Under SP2, an \nassessment  of  sector  performance,  including  the  roles  of  different  levels  of  government  in \ndelivering education services and progress toward the MDGs, will be undertaken in preparation \nfor the 2010\u20132015 Strategic Plan for the Education Sector. To accelerate the attainment of the \nMDGs, specific attention will be paid to the assessment of pro-poor programs for education and \npossibilities  for  improvement  and  expansion.  Some  analytical  work  will  also  be  undertaken  to \nassess  whether  it  is  possible  to  adopt  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework  to  help  improve \nthe  predictability  of  sector  financing  in  terms  of  size,  flow,  and  the  use  of  educational \nexpenditures over the medium term. Under SP3, it is expected that a medium-term development \nplan will be approved to provide good quality services in under-served areas.  \n\nPO 12: Greater Transparency of Education Outcomes to Enhance Accountability. \n84.\nIncreased  financing  of  education  sector  reforms  naturally  calls  for  greater  efforts  to  boost \ngovernance, transparency and accountability for outcomes (e.g. through the results of national \nexams,  which  MONE  and  MORA  now  publish).  The  Center  for  Educational  Assessment  has \nused the results of the junior secondary level national exams, as well as results of the Program \nfor  International  Student  Assessment,  and  Trends  in  International  Mathematics  and  Science \nStudies, to inform government policies for improving accountability and the education quality. A \nwell  designed  and  reliable  survey  of  communities  will  be  conducted  under  SP2  to  obtain \nfeedback  on  both  the  positive  and  negative  aspects  of  basic  education  service  delivery.  A \ncitizen report card survey will also be undertaken in three districts under SP2. \n\n                                                \n40 A  regulation  instructing  line  ministries  in  the  preparation  of  MSSs  was  issued  by  MOHA  in  2007.  The  Ministry  is \nalso preparing legislation to guide local governments in the implementation of MSSs developed by line ministries.  \n\n\f23\n\nThe  technical  guidelines  for  ministerial  decree  No.  044/u/2002  will  be  reviewed  to \n85. \nincrease  the  proportion  of  females  participating  in  school  committees  and  district  education \nboards to at least 40%, to ensure the increase of the role of women in  the governance of the \neducation system. At the national level, the ministry of education has established a number of \nmeasurable anti-corruption performance indicators in the education medium-term plan41 with the \nsummary of the results to be published on their websites under SP3.  \n\n3. \n\nHealth Sector Reforms  \n\nHealth  sector  reforms  supported  under  PRMAP  include  (i)  expanding  access  to  health \n86. \nservices, especially for the poor and women; (ii) improving quality, efficiency, and effectiveness \nof health services; and (iii) enhancing governance in health service delivery. \n\na. \n\nExpand  Access  to  Health  Services,  especially  for  the  Poor  and \nWomen\n\n87. \nPO 13: Increased Central Budget for MDG-Related Health Programs. Between 2005 \nand 2007, MOH increased its budget allocation for MDG-related health programs by more than \n50%.  In  2007,  more  than  20%  of  the  MOH  budget  is  expected  to  be  allocated  for  MNCH  and \nCDC programs. Even with these increases, however, the country\u2019s budget allocations in these \nareas  remain  far  below  those  of  other  countries  in  the  region.\nIn  the  coming  years,  the \nGovernment  will  need  to  increase  budgetary  allocations  for  health,  and  the  MOH  will  need  to \nimprove budget targeting for (i) MDG-related health programs, such as MNCH and CDC; and (ii) \nregions  with  poorer  health  outcomes.  During  SP2  and  SP3,  MOH  is  planning  to  increase  its \nbudget  allocation  for  programs  that  would  accelerate  meeting  the  health-related  MDG  targets. \nInvestments  in  preventive  care  services  and  communicable  diseases,  such  as  HIV/AIDS  and \nmalaria, must be prioritized. These actions are expected to disproportionately benefit the poor, \nwho utilize public sector health services for reproductive and child health care, and suffer from \ncommunicable diseases. \n\nPO 14: Improved Targeting of Public Financing for Health Services for the Poor. In\n88.\n2005,  the  Government  introduced  a  new  healthcare  scheme,  the  ASKESKIN  program,  which \naimed  to:  (i)  improve  targeting  of  budget  resources  to  health  services  utilized  by  the  poor,  (ii) \nincrease  financing  for  O&M  expenses  of  public  sector  health  facilities,  and  (iii)  increase \nefficiency  of  funds  management  through  contracting  PT  Askes  to  independently  manage  the \nfunds  and  provider  contracts.  Sixty  million  poor  people  were  entitled  to  ASKESKIN  benefits, \nincluding  primary,  secondary  and  tertiary  care  if  provided  by  public  clinics  and  hospitals.  The \npoor receive free services on presentation of a health (ASKESKIN) card, or a letter from local \nauthorities indicating their poverty status. ASKESKIN\u2019s design has evolved since 2005 with the \naim  of  increasing  access  by  the  poor  to  priority  health  services  by  allowing  reimbursement  of \nservices  provided  by  eligible  non-government  providers  (i.e.  midwives  and  select  private \nhospitals).42 The program provides allocations to public clinics, utilizing a formula to favor those \nclinics with a higher proportion of the poor within their target areas, and those in remote areas.  \n\n89.  While the ASKESKIN program has removed some of the key cost barriers preventing the \npoor  from  accessing  health  services,  the  program  has  limitations,  because  it  covers  only \nmedical care costs, and not non-medical service costs, such as transportation, inpatient meals, \nand contraceptives. The Government recognizes that there is scope to improve and refine the \neffectiveness of this program, and is planning under SP2 to conduct a comprehensive analysis \n\n                                                \n41 These include targets for: (i) number of corruption charges, (ii) amount of funds subject to corruption investigation, \n\nand (iii) amount of funds subject to being reclaimed. \n\n42 The poor use private service providers, especially midwives, in 57% of cases. \n\n\f24\n\nof options for the revision of the ASKESKIN program design and implementation modalities. The \nevaluation  will  take  into  account  previous  assessments,43  feedback  related  to  recent  program \nadjustments,  and  the  longer-term  development  of  a  national  health  insurance  policy.  Under \nSP3, MOH will utilize the analysis to revise the program\u2019s design and implementation strategy, \nin  order  to:  i)  improve  targeting  of  benefits  to  the  poor;  ii)  increase  access  and  utilization  of \nprimary  care  services;  iii)  improve  integration  of  primary  care  services  delivery  (e.g.,  family \nplanning,  antenatal,  delivery  and  postnatal  MNCH  services);  and  iv)  increase  program \nmanagement  efficiency  to  increase  incentives  for  health  service  providers.  The  ASKESKIN \nprogram  could  also  modify  its  reimbursement  methods  to  better  motivate  providers  to  deliver \nkey MDG-related services.  \n\nb.  \n\nImprove Quality and Efficiency of Health Services \n\nPO  15:  Improved  Effectiveness  of  MNCH/RH  Services  through  Influencing \n90.\nProvider  Behavior.  In  May  2006,  the  Government  modified  the  program  for  recruiting  and \ncontracting temporary doctors and midwives by including additional financial incentives to attract \nthem to remote areas. The program will provide an additional monthly salary of  Rp.7.5 million \n($828)  to  specialist  doctors;  Rp.  5  million  ($552)  to  doctors,  and  Rp.  2.5  million  ($276)  to \nmidwives  working  in  remote  areas.  The  program  is  expected  to  improve  the  quality  of  MNCH \nservices. Provider payment mechanisms introduced through ASKESKIN that influence financial \nincentives  will  also  affect  provider  location  choices  and  influence  provision  behavior.  Since \n2006,  district  governments  can  also  use  DAK  funds  to  construct  water  and  sanitation  facilities \nand housing for doctors, nurses and midwives in remote areas, so as to attract and retain health \npersonnel. These actions are expected to increase the availability and quality of MNCH services \nin remote areas. \n\n91. \nA  systematic  review  of  provider  payment  modalities  in  Indonesia  is  needed  to  inform \nevidence-based policy development with respect to improving availability of health personnel in \nremote  and  underserved  areas.  Under  SP2,  MOH  plans  to  commission  an  assessment  to \ncomprehensively  document  all  the  methods  used  to  attract  and  retain  health  personnel  in \nremote and underserved areas. The assessment will analyze how the different alternatives have \ninfluenced the distribution of health personnel, and the provision of health services and health \noutcomes, with particular attention to increasing provision of integrated primary health services \nfor  women  and  children.  In  the  process,  MOH  will  be  improving  its  database  on  health \npersonnel. During SP3, MOH will utilize the findings and recommendations of the assessment in \nrevising provider payment mechanisms.  \n\nPO  16:  Improved  Effectiveness  of  CDC  through  Integrated  Programs.  The\n92.\nGovernment is developing comprehensive strategies for CDC (especially for HIV/AIDS, malaria \nand  TB),  including  elaboration  of  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  various  ministries,  and \nmechanisms  for  coordination  of  efforts  across  ministries.  In  2006,  MOH  developed  a  National \nPolicy and Strategy for Reproductive Health that elaborates the efforts of relevant ministries to \nimprove  reproductive  health  access  and  outcomes.  This  policy  integrates  various  elements  of \nreproductive  health  under  one  coordinating  strategy,  including  maternal  health,  child  health, \nfamily planning, and prevention and treatment of sexually-transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS. \nIn  addition,  MOH  is  developing  more  detailed  ministerial-level  strategies  to  strengthen  CDC, \nincluding  provision  of  integrated  preventive  and  curative  health  care  at  the  community  and \nhealth-center level. For example, MOH has endorsed national guidelines for mitigating TB that \n                                                \n43 An  initial  rapid  assessment  of  the  program  in  six  provinces  was  undertaken  by  the  Government  between  March \nand  June  2006,  with  ADB  and  World  Bank  support.  The  assessment  identified  the  need  to  improve  targeting  of \nbeneficiaries,  provide  public  information  about  the  program  among  the  poor  to  increase  demand  for  health \nservices, develop a complaint resolution mechanism, and strengthen M&E. \n\n\f25\n\nspecify strategies and plans for TB control for the period 2006 to 2010, including guidelines for \ndevelopment  of  public-private  partnerships  in  TB  case  detection  and  treatment.  MOH  is  also \nsupporting provision of information, education, and communication activities through the Center \nfor  Health  Promotion,  so  as  to  enhance  the  knowledge,  attitudes  and  practices  of  individuals, \nhouseholds and communities to prevent the contraction and spread of communicable diseases. \n\n93. \nDuring  SP2,  the  National  AIDS  Commission  has  finalized  the  national  strategy  for \nHIV/AIDS  mitigation  for  2008  to  2012,  including  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  all  relevant \nministries, the private sector and civil society. In support of national efforts to mitigate HIV/AIDS, \nMOH  will  approve  the  Strategic  Plan  for  HIV/AIDS  Mitigation  in  Indonesia,  2008  to  2012,  that \nintegrates  HIV/AIDS  control  efforts  in  all  relevant  MOH  programs.  HIV/AIDS  strategies  will \nreflect surveys findings related to the distribution of the disease and existing evaluations related \nto  the  effectiveness  of  current  HIV/AIDS  strategies  and  programs.  In  addition  to  surveillance, \nvoluntary testing and treatment, national and MOH strategies will include actions to strengthen \nthe knowledge, attitudes and practices of individuals, households and communities in relation to \nHIV/AIDS  prevention.  HIV/AIDS  strategies  will  be  coordinated  with  TB  control  efforts.  Under \nSP3, MOH will complete and present to the National AIDS Commission an analysis of the costs \nand available sources of financing for the MOH component of the Government\u2019s response to the \nHIV/AIDS epidemic. 44\n\nPO  17:  Improved  Monitoring  of  MDG-Related  Health  Performance.  MOH  has \n94.\nprepared a revised list of district MSSs and indicators. The list contains 8 types of MSSs with 28 \nindicators.  The  need  to  monitor  local  government  progress  and  performance  in  achieving  the \nMDGs were key criteria in developing the revised list of indicators. Of the 28 indicators, 10 refer \ndirectly  to  MNCH  services,  while  several  others  monitor  CDC-related  aspects,  such  as  TB \ndetection  rates,  cases of  diarrhea  treated,  or  the  number  of  villages  in  the  district  that  receive \ntimely disease outbreaks response.  \n\n95.  MOH  plans  to  refine  the  health-related  MSSs  and  endorse  them  through  a  ministerial \ndecree. The MSSs prepared by MOH will be first reviewed by the National Consultative Team,45\nand  submitted  for  approval  to  the  Regional  Autonomy  Advisory  Council.  The  updated  MSSs \ndecree  will  include  health-related  MDGs  and  identify  intermediate  indicators  for  child  nutrition, \nmaternal and child health, HIV/AIDS, and TB. To the extent appropriate and feasible, MOH will \nidentify  intermediate  indicators  that  are  harmonized  with  health-related  MDG  indicators.  MOH \nwill  undertake  to  modify  their  health  information  system  to  track  the  performance  of  MSSs \nindicators and link the allocation of human, material and financial resources to performance at \nthe  national  and  sub-national  levels.  These  actions  will  benefit  strategy  development  and \nresource management related to achievement of the health-related MDGs. The introduction of \nperformance-based contracts, and incentives for public and private sector service providers to \nbetter  manage  district  level  health  services,  based  on  a  short  list  of  measurable  MSSs,  could \nincrease  their  motivation  and  yield  improved  access  to  affordable  and  quality  health  care, \nespecially by the poor and women. \n\n                                                \n44 A recent survey, which focused in particular on two high-risk groups (intravenous drug users and commercial sex \nworkers and their partners), was undertaken to estimate the distribution of HIV/AIDS. The Coordinating Ministry for \nPeople\u2019s Welfare (Menko Kestra) issued a Ministerial Decree in 2007 to coordinate multisectoral efforts to reduce \nHIV/AIDS transmission by use of intravenous drugs. The MOH has issued a Ministerial Decree on the Appointment \nof  Referral  Hospitals  for  HIV/AIDS  and  Service  Standards  that  details  standards  required  for  select  public  and \nprivate sector hospitals to provide HIV/AIDS testing and treatment services. \n\n45 Consisting  of  ministers,  directors  general  and  related  directors  under  Bappenas,  MOF,  MOHA,  and  the  state \n\napparatus minister. \n\n\f26\n\n \n\nc. \n\nEnhance Governance in Health Service Delivery \n\nPO  18:  Improved  Financial  Information  with  Regard  to  MDG-Related  Health \n96.\nExpenditures. The  PER,  carried  out  by  BAPPENAS  and  MOF  with  World  Bank  support, \nprovides  an  analysis  of  overall  health  expenditures  by  central,  provincial  and  district \ngovernments.  It  presents  a  review  of  health  financing  issues  that  contributes  to  the \nunderstanding  of  MDG-related  expenditures.  However,  the  PER  did  not  include  detailed \nanalysis  of  public  sector  health  expenditure  by  program,  especially  at  the  national  and  sub-\nnational levels, as such information is not readily available.  \n\n97. \nTo  improve  the  completeness,  quality  of  information  and  analysis  of  total  and  public \nexpenditures  for  health  under  SP2,  BAPPENAS  will  lead  efforts  to  develop  a  plan  for \ninstitutionalization  of  a NHAs  program,  including  specification  of  the  responsible  agencies  and \nterms  of  reference  for  conduct  of  the  NHAs;  the  plan  will  be  used  by  the  Government  to \nestablish  the  program.  NHAs  detail  how  resources  are  used,  and  if  implemented  on  a  regular \nbasis, can track health expenditure trends. NHAs can also be used to make financial projections \nof health system requirements and identify opportunities for improvement. Health accounts can \nhelp track use of resources to achieve the MDGs and other global initiatives. Under SP3, NHAs \nwill be produced for at least one year between 2008 and 2010, based on the plan developed. \nMOH  is  also  planning  to  retrospectively  analyze  public  expenditure  for  health  for  the  period \n2003 to 2006, based on the initial analysis prepared by the PER. These actions will contribute to \nimproving  the  transparency  of  health  expenditures  and  programmatic  and  geographic \nallocations. Such information will improve the targeting of public expenditures to health-related \nMDG programs and to districts with poor performance with respect to the MDG indicators. \n\nC. \n\nLinkages with Other Assistance \n\n98. \nThe  design  and  implementation  of  the  PRMAP  have  been  closely  coordinated  with \nongoing  ADB  programs  and  projects.  ADB\u2019s  Development  Policy  Support  Programs  I  and  II \nincluded several crosscutting reforms that are related to social sector services delivery.46 These \nprograms have focused on (i) creating fiscal space for further investment in social sectors; (ii) \nthe  improvement  of  budget  and  financial  reporting  and  accounting  mechanisms  to  improve \ngovernance  and  reduce  corruption;  (iii)  the  reform  of  the  civil  service,  through  the  design  of  a \nnew job classification and remuneration policy; (iv) the development of a program for conditional \ncash transfers to the poor, and monitoring of the effectiveness and fiduciary assessment of this \nprogram.  The  Local  Government  Finance  and  Governance  Reform  Sector  Development \nProgram47  supported  measures  that  had  positive  impacts  on  the  financing  of  decentralized \nsocial  service  delivery,  such  as  (i)  the  revised  Law  on  Fiscal  Balance  and  its  implementing \nregulations; and (ii) the clarification of the roles and responsibilities of each level of government \nfor social services, such as the establishment of the Regional Autonomy Advisory Council and \npreparation  of  the  National  Action  Plan  for  Fiscal  Decentralization.  PRMAP  will  build  on  these \nreforms  by  supporting  the  reform  of  DAK,  the  development  of  MSSs  for  the  education  and \nhealth sectors, and the improvement of incentives for teachers and health personnel. \n\n                                                \n46 ADB  has  adopted  a  dual-track  approach  to  enhance  the  linkage  and  synergy  between  cross-cutting \nmacroeconomic  reforms  and  deeper  sector-level  reforms.  This  dual-track  approach  is  outlined  in  ADB.  2005. \nReport  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the  Republic  of \nIndonesia for the Development Policy Support Program. Manila (Loan 2228-INO, para. 7).  \n\n47 ADB.  2005.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loans  to  the \nRepublic  of  Indonesia  for  Local  Government  Finance  and  Governance  Reform  Sector  Development  Program.\nManila.  \n\n\f27\n\nSeveral other ADB projects complement PRMAP in key sectors relevant for achievement \n99. \nof the MDGs. The Decentralized Health Services I and II48 projects support the strengthening of \ndistrict  capacity  in  planning,  performance-based  budgeting  for  the  health  sector,  and  the \ndevelopment of incentive schemes for redistributing staff to remote and underserved areas in 200 \ndistricts. The Decentralized Basic Education Project49 provides support to schools and districts for \nthe preparation of school development plans, and for developing and improving the functioning of \nschool  committees.  It  also  supports  capacity-building  activities  at  the  district  level  to  improve \nplanning,  management  and  budgeting  of  education  services.  The  Madrasah  Education  Support \nproject50 will provide quality education services for the poor in underserved areas. The Community \nWater Services and Health Project,51 which supports access to safe drinking water and sanitation, \nwill  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  reduction  of  child  mortality  rates  in  rural  areas.  The  Nutrition \nImprovement  Through  Community  Empowerment  Project52  will  contribute  to  improved  maternal \nand child health through promotion of better nutrition, breast-feeding, and other community-based \ninitiatives. TA will also be provided to develop and implement MSSs in the education sector at the \ndistrict  level. The  PRMAP reforms will enhance  the sustainability of these projects and assist  in \nthe development of an improved policy framework for implementing them. \n\nD. \n\nImportant Features \n\n100.  PRMAP\u2019s overall design directly supports the Government\u2019s medium-term development \nvision,  as  articulated  in  the  RPJM,  and  the  medium-term  plans  for  the  health  and  education \nsectors. It is anchored in the Government\u2019s policy reform agenda and actions and emphasizes \ngovernment leadership and ownership. The program recognizes recent key policy actions, while \nestablishing  a  medium-term  framework  to  continue  the  complex  reform  process  at  a  flexible \npace. The design of PRMAP as a program cluster consisting of three subprograms provides the \nflexibility  needed  by  an  emerging  middle-income  country  such  as  Indonesia,  which  is \nundergoing  a  governance  and  fiscal  transition,  to  build  consensus  for  reforms  among \nstakeholders with competing interests. \n\n101.  The  PRMAP  is  the  first  program  loan  from  ADB  focused  on  the  MDGs.  The  program \ntackles the multidimensional aspects of poverty with particular attention to non-income MDGs, \nespecially  the  lack  of  access  by  the  poor  to  quality  health  and  education  services.  It  also \nrecognizes  cross-sectoral  linkages  and  supports  the  development  of  interagency  networks  to \ndevelop and implement a complex reform agenda. PRMAP complements other interventions by \nADB  and  its  development  partners  through  projects  and  programs  for  specific  sectors  and \nmultisectoral  development  policy  loans.  It  will  provide  an  overall  framework  and  develop  a \nroadmap for the accelerated achievement of the MDGs. \n\n                                                \n48 ADB.  2000.

Manila. \n\n\f28\n\n The program and the supporting TA will strengthen capacity in the Government\u2019s education \n102. \nand health ministries with respect to strategic, policy oversight, M&E and supervisory functions. It \nwill  also  assist  the  Government  in  developing  incentive  mechanisms  for  local  governments  to \nimprove efficiency and accountability. This approach aims at addressing the challenge of improving \nhealth and education public service delivery within a progressively decentralized framework, while \nensuring rapid acceleration of progress towards meeting the MDG targets. \n\nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n103.  The  PRMAP  adopts  a  program  cluster  approach  with  three  back-to-back  subprograms, \neach supported by a single-tranche loan and a specific loan agreement. Intervals of about 2 years \neach are envisaged between the subprograms. Thus, subject to adequate progress and approval \nof  Subprogram  1  (SP1)  around  October  2007,  Subprogram  2  (SP  2)  could  be  considered  for \napproval in 2009, and Subprogram 3 (SP 3) in 2011.  \n\n104.  For SP1, the Government has requested a loan from ADB of $400 million, to support the \nreforms and policy actions outlined in the development policy letter and policy matrix. The loan \nsize has been determined by the strength of the policy package and its development impact, the \nimportance  of  the  sectors  covered  and  investment  needs  in  the  education  and  health  sectors. \nSome  adjustment  cost  arising  from  the  establishment  of  new  programs,  such  as  BOS  or \nASKESKIN, the implementation of surveys and development of a database to identify the poor, \nand  the  preparation  of  MSSs  for  education  and  health  services  were  also  considered.  The \nreform agenda for SP2, and especially for SP3, will be refined to reflect the progress made and \nevolving circumstances. The Government envisages support from ADB of $200 million each for \nSP2 and SP3. The amounts will be reconfirmed during the PRMAP review and the processing \nof each subprogram.  \n\n105. \nIn terms of overall financing requirements in 2007, the Government has requested $2.1 \nbillion53  in  program  loans  from  ADB,  Japan  and  the  World  Bank.  This  reflects  a  significantly \nhigher fiscal deficit of around 1.6% of GDP, due to increased spending in health and education \nand  other  investment  and  reconstruction  efforts.  In  2007,  total  national  expenditures  for  the \neducation  sector  are  expected  to  increase  by  approximately  $1.928  billion  and  for  the  health \nsector  by  $778  million.  The  central  government  has  allocated  an  additional  $852  million  for \neducation and $406 million for health, with the remaining funds provided by local governments. \nWithout  PRMAP  support,  sustaining  these  necessary  increases  in  education  and  health \nexpenditures may not be possible.  \n\n106.  The  program  loan  of  $400  million  for  SP1  will  be  funded  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources, and will have (i) a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; (ii) an interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility;  (iii)  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum;  (iv)  conversion  options  that  may  be \nexercised  in  accordance  with  the  draft  loan  agreement,  the  loan  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s \nconversion guidelines; and (v) such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft program \nloan agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  this  choice  was  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on or any communication or advice from ADB.  \n\n                                                \n53 This  comprises  (i)  from  ADB,  $400  million  for  the  PRMAP,  $200  million  for  the  Development  Policy  Support \nProgram 3, and $300 for the Capital Market Development Cluster Program; (ii) from the World Bank, $600 million \nthrough  its  Development  Policy  Loan  4  and  $200  million  for  the  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development \nProgram; and (iii) from the Government of Japan, $200 million through cofinancing of the Development Policy Loan \n4 and the $200 million Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program. \n\n\f29\n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n107. A  Program  Steering  Committee  (PSC)  and  a  program  technical  committee  will  be \nestablished to oversee implementation of the program cluster. Both committees will be chaired \nby  Deputy  Human  Resources  and  Cultural  Affairs,  BAPPENAS,  and  include  representatives \nfrom  all  relevant  ministries  (MOF,  MOH,  MONE,  MORA,  MOWE,MOHA  and  BPS)  with \nresponsibilities related to the attainment of the MDGs. BAPPENAS will be the executing agency \nfor  coordinating  the  implementation  of  the  PRMAP  and  will  establish  an  executive  secretariat. \nThe line ministries responsible for the various sectors will be the implementing agencies and will \nestablish sectoral technical committees and secretariats for the education and health sectors.  \n\n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n108.  The  implementation  period  for  SP1  is  from  1  April  2005  to  31  March  2007.  All  actions \nincluded  in  the  policy  matrix  under  SP1  have  been  implemented  during  this  time  frame.  The \nprogram period for SP2 is from 1 April 2007 to 30 March 2009, while that of SP3 will cover the \nperiod from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2011. The timeframe of SP1 and SP2 is consistent with \nthe  implementation  period  of  the  RPJM  and  the  recently  approved  education  and  health \nmedium-term development plans. This time frame is also consistent with the ADB CSP 2006\u2013\n2009, which includes MDG acceleration as one of its core areas of support. SP3 will build on the \nresults of SP1 and SP2 and will be revised to support the new RPJM, which is to be prepared \nby  the  Government  in  2009.  The  duration  of  the  program  loan  is  considered  appropriate  to \nreach the policy reform objectives of PRMAP. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement   \n\n109.\nThe proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to the Borrower in accordance with \nthe provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements \nfor  Program  Loans.54  The  SP1  loan  of  $400  million  will  be  released  in  a  single  tranche  upon \nloan  effectiveness.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs \n(excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries, \nexcluding the items specified in the list of ineligible items (Appendix 7) and imports financed by \nthe  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nother  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources. \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,  the \nproceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Borrower.  No  supporting  import \ndocumentation  will  be  required,  if  the  value  of  Indonesia\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan disbursed during the given year. \nThe  Government  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  its  withdrawal  request. \nOtherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required.  The  PRMAP  will \nprovide for retroactive financing for expenditures incurred by the Government 180 days prior to \nloan  effectiveness.  The  Borrower  has  been  informed  that  the  approval  in  principle  of  the \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance this program.  \n\nIn  accordance  with \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption \n\n110.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  all  relevant  ADB  guidelines,  including  the  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time), and the loan regulations, was specifically brought to the notice of \n\n                                                \n54 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n\n\f30\n\nthe  Government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Program  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Program.  The  Government  has \nconsiderably  strengthened  its  anticorruption  efforts  since  late  2004.  The  reforms  adopted  as \npart  of  PRMAP  will  reduce  the  risk  of  corruption  in  the  health  and  education  sectors  by \nincreasing government transparency in the allocation of resources and improving accountability \nby service providers, local governments and central government ministries. Some of the reforms \ncontributing  to  the  reduction  of  corruption  include:  (i)  the  publication  of  the  summaries  of  the \nMONE  and  MORA  inspectors  general  audit  reports  in  their  websites;  (ii)  socialization  of \nASKESKIN programs to communities to inform them on available services and entitlements; (iii) \nincreased  transparency  in  the  allocation  of  DAK  funds  for  health  and  education;  (iv) \nstrengthening  of  the  schools  committees  with  increased  women\u2019s  participation;  and  (v) \nincreased availability and transparency on health expenditures though the preparation of NHAs.  \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n111.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s  certification  for  the  withdrawal  application.  Prior  to  the  withdrawal,  the \nGovernment will open a deposit account at Bank Indonesia to receive the loan proceeds. The \naccount will be managed, operated, and liquidated on terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n\n6. \n\nPerformance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n\n112.  MOF and BAPPENAS will be continuously monitoring implementation of the PRMAP and its \nimpact. Reporting on progress will be made by the line ministries, as implementing agencies, to the \nPSC through regular quarterly meetings. BAPPENAS will submit to ADB semi-annual reports until \nthe completion of the program cluster. With ADB TA support, the line ministries reporting system on \nprogress will be strengthened and technical coordination will be provided to resolve problems and \nfacilitate implementation of pending or delayed actions. ADB will be closely involved in the process \nthrough  TA  as  well  as  policy  dialogue,  and  its  inputs  will  be  conveyed  to  the  Government. \nBAPPENAS  and  ADB  will  jointly  assess  the  impact  and  evaluate  the  benefits  of  SP1  within  12 \nmonths  after  completion.  Findings  from  the  consultations  and  reviews  will  be  utilized  in  ensuring \ncontinuity and sustained progress of SP1 reforms under SP2 and SP3. \n\nV. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n113.  The  impact  of  the  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  to  strengthen  social  service \ndelivery at the national level through the implementation of national policy reforms in health and \neducation. The TA outcome will be to sustain the reforms introduced under SP1, and refine and \nassist the Government to achieve the national policy reforms included under SP2. It will support \nBAPPENAS,  MONE,  MORA,  MOH,  and  MOWE  to  implement  these  reforms.  The  TA  is \ndesigned  to  be  flexible,  allowing  the  Government  to  develop  outputs,  terms  of  reference,  and \nbudgets for individual components based on current needs and demand. The TA will coordinate \nand  complement  ADB  and  other  donor-supported  decentralized  programs  in  poverty,  gender, \neducation  and  health,  to  ensure  that  lessons  can  be  applied  to  the  TA  for  accelerating  MDG \nachievement in a holistic way. \n\n\f31\n\n114.  The  TA  will  result  in  10  outputs  grouped  under  three  components.  Component  1  will \nsupport  cross-sectoral  policy  reforms  by  assisting  Government  agencies  to:  (i)  develop \nrecommendations  for  strengthening  the  DAK  technical  guidelines  for  the  education  and  health \nsectors, (ii) finalize a list of selected sex-disaggregated MDG health and education indicators, and \n(iii)  develop  a  national  MDG  roadmap,  and  prepare  guidelines  on  mainstreaming  MDGs  into \ndistrict  medium-term  development  plans  and  poverty  reduction  strategies.  Component  2  will \nsupport reforms in the education sector by: (i) assessing the effectiveness of different strategies \nand programs in meeting the basic education objectives of the Grand Design for Basic Education \nand assisting these ministries in the development of policy proposals, and (ii) demonstrating the \nuse  of  the  \u201cCitizens  Report  Card\u201d  (CRC)  for  education,  used  for  surveying  parents  on  their \nsatisfaction  with  service  delivery  to  improve  accountability  and  education  quality.  Component  3 \nwill  support  reforms  in  the  health  sector  by:  (i)  reviewing  and  improving  the  criteria  used  for \ncentrally  provided  budget  allocations  for  MNCH  and  CDC  activities;  (ii)  supporting  analysis  and \ndevelopment  of  recommendations  for  the  revision  of  the  ASKESKIN  program  design  and \nimplementation modalities; (iii) preparing an evaluation of (a) contract provider payment-schemes, \nincluding in particular their impact on the distribution of providers in poor and remote areas, and \n(b) utilization of MNCH and CDC services, particularly by women; (iv) assisting in the revision of a \nministerial  regulation  regarding  health-related  MSSs;  and  (v)  contributing  to  developing  a  NHAs \nprogram.  \n\n115.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  in  parallel  with  the  PRMAP  and  will  cover  a  period  of  20 \nmonths,  from  1  January  2008  to  31  August  2009.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at \n$2,700,000. ADB will finance $1,500,000 from its TA funding program, and the Government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  amount  of  $200,000  equivalent.  AusAID  will  provide  about \n$1,000,000  parallel  cofinancing  to  support  health  sector  reforms.  BAPPENAS  will  be  the \nexecuting  agency  and  the  line  ministries  responsible  for  the  various  sectors  will  act  as  the \nimplementing agencies. The PSC established for PRMAP will also coordinate implementation of \nthe TA. A team of international specialists (46 person-months) and national experts (31 person-\nmonths), supported by ADB, will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants, following the quality- and cost-based selection method and using a full technical \nproposal. A team of international specialists (total 30 person-months) and national experts (40 \nperson-months),  supported  by  AusAID  on  a  parallel  basis,  will  be  recruited  on  an  individual \nbasis. The TA is presented in Appendix 8. The terms of reference for consulting services are in \nSupplementary Appendix E. \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nExpected Impacts \n\n116.  The key benefits expected from PRMAP are (i) the acceleration of the attainment of the \nMDGs; (ii) sustained progress in meeting the Government\u2019s medium-term poverty reduction and \nsocial  development  objectives,  as  articulated  in  the  RPJM,  the  SNPK,  and  the  national  sector \nstrategies  for  the  health  and  education  sectors;  (iii)  reorientation  of  public  expenditure  to  the \nsocial sectors; (iv) an improved decentralization framework for provision of social services; (v) \nreduction of regional disparities; and (vi) increased access to and enhanced quality, efficiency, \nand accountability of education and health services for the poor. \n\nInstitutional  Impacts.  The  PRMAP  will  strengthen  the  institutional  framework  for  the \n117.\nsocial  sectors  and  assist  in  developing  inter-sectoral  linkages  and  networks  to  overcome \ntraditional  institutional  barriers  across  ministries,  and  between  central  and  local  government \nagencies.  Within  the  education  sector,  institutional  coordination  between  MONE  and  MORA  will \nimprove due to the preparation of a joint strategic plan (the Grand Design for Basic Education). In \nthe health sector the role of PT Askes as a provider of health insurance will be enhanced. At the \n\n\f32\n\ndistrict  level,  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  local  governments  with  respect  to  social  sector \ndelivery  will  be  clarified.  The  increased  role  of  women  in  district  education  boards  and  school \ncommittees is expected to increase institutional capacity at the community level. \n\n118. Policy  Impacts.  PRMAP  will  assist  in  raising  public  awareness  regarding  the  MDGs, \npromote study and debate around the development challenges facing the country, forge stronger \nalliances  among  diverse  groups,  renew  political  commitment  and  help  the  Government  and  its \ndevelopment  partners  create  deeper  and  better-financed  partnerships.  It  will  help  focus  the \nnational debate on specific development priorities related to the poor and vulnerable, which in turn \nwill  trigger  action  in  terms  of  policy  reforms,  institutional  change  and  resource  allocation.  The \nprogram  will  also  provide  for  policy  continuity  and  consistency  in  areas  in  which  ADB  has  been \nactively involved. \n\n119. Social Impacts. The PRMAP supports improved access and equity of social services for \nthe poor and women. The program will contribute to reducing sharp regional and socioeconomic \ndifferentials in selected education and health indicators. It will also contribute to a reduction in \nmaternal mortality by improving access to comprehensive emergency obstetric care, antenatal \ncare,  and  family  planning  services,  and  lower  infant  and  child  mortality  rates  by  increasing \nimmunization coverage. Improved CDC (targeting, for example, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB) will \nalso contribute to lowering maternal and child mortality. In education, better access to schools \nand  the  removal  of  fees  will  likely  result  in  improved  transition  rates  to  junior  secondary \neducation.  Higher  enrollment  and  transition  rates  will  result  in  reduced  child  labor  as  children \ndelay their entrance to the labor market to obtain more education. A summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 9. \n\n120. Gender  Impacts.  Accelerating  progress  towards  the  achievement  of  the  MDGs  will \ndirectly benefit women through the promotion of gender equity. An increased focus on achieving \nthe  MDGs  requires  designing  interventions  that  target  improvements  in  women\u2019s  health  and \neducation  (e.g.,  achieving  universal  primary  education,  reaching  gender  parity  in  primary  and \nsecondary education, reducing maternal and infant mortality, and reducing HIV/AIDS). The policy \nmeasures  under  PRMAP  will  improve  (i)  girls  access  to  junior  secondary  education  through, \namong  others,  integrated  schools  and  scholarship  schemes;  and  (ii)  access  by  females  to \naffordable  maternal  and  reproductive  health  services  through  increased  financing  and  technical \nimprovements to the ASKESKIN program. PRMAP also supports policy changes to increase the \nproportion of female representatives on district education boards and school committees to 40%. \nImproved and more efficient delivery of basic education and health services will result in reducing \nthe  opportunity  cost  of  women\u2019s  time,  improving  the  health  and  nutrition  status  of  families, \nlowering fertility, and reducing future gender disparities. \n\n121. Economic  and  Poverty  Impacts.  The  nature  of  PRMAP,  as  a  policy  reform  program, \ndoes not lend itself to a quantitative financial and economic analysis. Nevertheless, it is evident \nthat major economic benefits will accrue to the entire population through measures that aim to \nexpand the scope and improve access to and the quality and governance of basic social sector \nservices, particularly for the poor. Improved access to basic education will increase productivity \nand personal income of poor families in the long run. Access to affordable health services and \nto health insurance will increase productivity and protect the poor from catastrophic health risks, \nwhich can exacerbate poverty. PRMAP will contribute to the development of human resources \nto better equip the population to seize the opportunities generated by rapid economic growth. It \nwill  also  have  a  positive  impact  on  employment  by  increasing  the  number  of  healthcare \nproviders  (e.g.,  midwives)  through  improved  reimbursement  procedures  of  the  ASKESKIN \nprogram and improving recruitment and deployment of teachers. The introduction of MSSs and \n\n\f33\n\nperformance-based  allocation  of  resources  will  make  social  services  more  responsive  to  local \npreferences, and service providers more accountable to their clients, increasing efficiency. \n\n122. Social and Environmental Safeguards. A desk review was undertaken to assess the \nimpact  of  the  PRMAP  policy  measures  and  the  TA  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  the \nenvironment, and ethnic groups, in accordance with ADB\u2019s social and environmental safeguard \npolicies (i.e., the Involuntary Resettlement Policy [1995], Policy on Indigenous Peoples [1998], \nand Environment Policy [2002]). The PRMAP and TA are unlikely to have any adverse impacts \non ethnic groups, resettlement or environment.  \n\nB. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n123.  The PRMAP is subject to the following risks: \n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nincreased \n\nLimited  impact  on  education  and  health  outcomes.  Overall  increased  public \nexpenditure  in  the  sectors  may  have  limited  effect  in  improving  education \noutcomes  if  the  funds  are  not  utilized  efficiently  or  fail  to  reach  the  intended \nbeneficiaries.  Increased  budget  allocation  for  education  and  health  from  the \nGovernment may encourage local governments to reduce their own allocations. \nThe  introduction  of  performance-based  allocation  mechanisms  and  improved \nsystems for monitoring outcomes will mitigate these risks. \nCorruption and poor governance. PRMAP may face constraints in the form of \nweak  governance  and  corruption.  However,  the  Government  has  considerably \nstrengthened its anti-corruption efforts in recent years. The profile and visibility of \nthe  anti-corruption  commission  and  other  law  enforcement  agencies  have  now \nbeen considerably enhanced to deal with corruption. The strengthening of school \ncommittees  and \ntransparency  and  accountability  mechanisms \nintroduced  under  the  ASKESKIN  program  will  improve  governance  in  the \neducation and health sectors. \nResistance  to  the  policy  reforms  by  local  governments  and  lack  of \ncapacity. Lack of clarity about the obligations of each level of government in the \ndelivery  of  social  services  could  pose  obstacles  for  the  implementation  of  the \nreforms  at \nthese \nresponsibilities  through  the  establishment  of  minimum  services  standards  is \nexpected to mitigate this risk. There is also a risk that local governments will fail \nto  support  reforms  that  increase  their  accountability  and  impose  further \nmonitoring of their policies and actions. Lack of capacity by local governments to \nimplement reforms is also a risk. Current support provided to districts by ongoing \nADB  projects  to  improve  capacity  for  implementation  of  health  and  education \nprograms is expected to reduce these risks. \nExternal  and  domestic  economic  shocks  may  affect  the  sustainability  of \nthe  reforms:  Increased  oil  prices  or  other  adverse  regional  or  domestic  events \nthat  have  a  contagion  effect  could  reduce  the  fiscal  space  available  for  the \nimplementation  of  the  reforms.  Efforts  taken  by  the  Government  to  balance  the \nbudget and improve economic management have reduced this risk. \nGovernment  commitment  to  MDGs.  A  lack  of  government  commitment  could \nreduce the momentum for policy reforms focused on accelerated achievement of \nthe MDGs. However, Government actions indicate strong commitment to poverty \nreduction and the MDG acceleration agenda in the medium term.  \n\nlevel.  Recent  steps \n\nfurther  clarify \n\ntaken \n\nlocal \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n\f34\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standards  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n124. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n\nCounterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the program loan will be used \nto finance the development needs as outlined under the PRMAP implementation \narrangements. \n\nThe policies and actions taken prior to the date of the PRMAP loan agreement, \nas  described  in  the  development  policy  letter  (including  the  policy  matrix),  will \ncontinue to be in effect for the duration of the PRMAP and subsequently. \n\nB. \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\n125.

\nIndonesia\u2019s performance relative to the education-related Millennium Development Goal \n(MDG)  2  of  universal  basic  education  by  2015  is  mixed,  although  it  has  made  good  progress \nwith respect to some intermediate indicators at the national level. Indonesia, which has one of \nthe  largest school-going  populations  in  the  world  (Table  A3.1),  has  been  more  ambitious  than \nmost  countries  striving  to  meet  the  international  target  of  universal  basic  education.  Indonesia \nhas defined basic education as including a total of 9 years: 6 years of primary education (7\u201312 \nyear  olds)  and  3  years  of  junior  secondary  education  (13\u201315  year  olds).  In  an  impressive \nachievement,  access  to  education,  as  measured  by  gross  enrolment  rates  (GERs)  and  net \nenrolment rates (NERs), has improved nationally at all levels. In 2005, the GER and NER at the \nprimary level were 114.6% and 94.0% respectively, while those for junior secondary level were \n82.9% and 63.7% (Table A3.2). These enrolment rates, especially at the primary level, compare \nfavorably with enrolment rates in East Asian countries with much higher per capita incomes.  \n\nTable A3.1: Population of School Aged Children\n(million)\n\nNational \nPopulation \n\n220  \n\nPopulation 0\u20136 \nYears Old \n\n28.5 \n\nPopulation \n7\u201312 (Primary) \n\nPopulation 13\u201315 \n(Junior Secondary) \n\nPopulation 16\u201318 \nSenior Secondary  \n\n25.60 \n\n13.03 \n\n12.66 \n\nSource: Ministry of National Education. 2005.

Additionally,  even  if  a  cohort  analysis  of  those  that \ncomplete basic education is undertaken, focusing on those who remain in school and complete \na certain level of education fails to take into account overall system inefficiencies resulting from \nrepetition and dropouts. Moreover, a recent study1 shows that even in those countries that are \non  track  to meet  the  MDGs,  the  majority  of  youth  do  not meet  minimal  competency  levels,  let \nalone the level of competency required in a globalized environment. \n\n                                                \n1  Filmer,  Dan,  Amer  Hasan,  and  Lant  Pritchett.  2006.

Despite  impressive  GERs  and  NERs,  only \n3. \nabout half of Indonesian children enrolled in school complete basic education within the required \n9  years.  A  recent  study2  shows  that  the  dropout  rate  for  primary  school  level  students  was \n1.68%  in  secular  schools  and  2.26%  for  madrasah.  At  the  junior  secondary  level,  the  rates \nincreased  to  2.65%  and  3.55%  for  secular  and  religious  schools,  respectively.  GER-\ndisaggregated  data  reveal  higher  dropout  rates  for  male  students  as  the  level  of  education \nincreases; dropout rates for male students are higher than for females, particularly at the junior \nsecondary level.

Key factors affecting enrolment and transition rates include substantial cost barriers (e.g. \nfees,  transport  cost,  textbooks,  stationary,  and  uniforms),  uneven  coverage  of  facilities,  and \nperceptions about the relevance of the curriculum and future employability of school graduates.  \n\nTable A3.4: NER by Income Quintile \n\nQ1(poorest)  Q2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ5( richest) Q5/Q1\n\n \n\n86.7 \n90.3 \n91.4 \n\n \n\n90.7 \n93.0 \n93.6 \n\n92.5\n93.4\n93.8\n\n93.3\n93.5\n93.2\n\n \n93.0 \n92.4 \n91.4 \n \n72.5 \n75.1 \n76.9 \n\n \n1.07 \n1.02 \n1.00 \n \n3.21 \n1.99 \n1.69 \n\n61.3\n69.2\n72.0\nSource: Ministry of Education. 2004.

Existing urban-rural disparities within districts and income-\nrelated  disparities  at  the  post\u2013primary  levels  pose  significant  challenges  to  the  attainment  of \nMDG  2.  Children  who  do  not  complete  primary  education  are  especially  at  risk  of  becoming \nilliterate adults. \n\n6. \nIndonesia is on track to meet the MDG 3 target of eliminating gender disparity in primary \nand secondary education by 2015. An impressive achievement for Indonesia is that the gender \ngap  in  terms  of  NER  has  been  eliminated  at  the  primary  level  and  reversed  for  the  junior \nsecondary levels,4 where there were more girls enrolled than boys (64.5% vs. 62.6%) in 2003 \n(Table  3.5).  At  the  senior  secondary  level,  the  NER  for  girls  (40.6%)  in  2003  was  almost  the \nsame that for boys (40.5%). In addition, the general observation\u2014that the poorer the family, the \nlower the proportion of girls enrolled in school and the higher the dropout rate for girls\u2014does not \nhold true for Indonesia at all levels of schooling.\n\nTable A3.5: Net Enrolment Rates, by Gender, Urban and Rural 2003 \n\nEducation Level \n\nPrimary \n\nJunior Secondary \n\nSenior Secondary \n\nUrban \n92.3 \n\n72.5 \n\n56.9 \n\nMale \nRural \n92.6 \n\n56.2 \n\n28.5 \n\nTotal \n92.5 \n\n62.6 \n\n40.5 \n\nUrban \n92.0 \n\n73.0 \n\n55.2 \n\nFemale \nRural \n\n93.0 \n\n58.8 \n\n29.0 \n\nTotal \n92.6 \n\n64.5 \n\n40.6 \n\nTertiary \nSources: Central Board of Statistics (BPS). 2003; and National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS). 2003. \n\n16.0 \n\n14.9 \n\n2.1 \n\n2.2 \n\n8.3 \n\n8.8 \n\n7. \nWhile the gender gap in terms of adult literacy rates has been narrowing steadily, due to \nfaster  improvements  in  the  literacy  rates  of  females  than  those  of  males,  the  literacy  rate  of \nwomen (86.2%) is still lower than that of men (93.5%). Women also have lower mean years of \nschooling  (6.5  years)  than  do  men  (7.6  years).  The  Government  is  promoting  female  literacy \nthrough  non-formal  education  programs.  In  addition,  increasing  completion  of  basic  education \nwill by default lower illiteracy levels in the future.  \n\n2. \n\nAnalysis of Institutional Capacity, Resource Allocation and Governance for \nEducation Sector Development in support of MDGs \n\na. \n\nInstitutional Capacity \n\nDecentralization  has  led  to  changed  and  still-evolving  roles  for  education  sector \n8. \nmanagement.  The  political  and  administrative  decentralization  undertaken  within  Indonesia  in \n2001 has posed some challenges for policy formulation and service delivery for the education \nsector. While general public education service delivery has been made the obligatory function of \nlocal  governments,  with  the  Ministry  of  National  Education  (MONE)  responsible  for  policy \ndevelopment  and  resource  allocation,  the  Ministry  of  Religious  Affairs  (MORA),  a  central  level \nagency, continues to be responsible for delivering religious education. In addition, the role and \ncoordination among different agencies\u2014such as Badan Perancanaan Pembangunan Nasional \n(the National Development Planning Agency, BAPPENAS) in policy formulation, the Ministry of \nHome  Affairs  (MOHA)  in  regulation,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  in  performance  based \nresource  allocation,  as  well  as  the  Board  of  National  Education  Standards  (BSNP)\u2014are  still \n\n                                                \n3  While  internationally,  the  MDG  for  basic  education  refers  to  5  years  of  education,  Indonesia  has  been  more \n\nambitious in defining its basic education to include both primary (grades 1\u20136) and secondary (grades 7\u20139). \n\n4  ADB.  2006.

Increased  clarity  with  respect  to  the  role  of  each  agency  in  the  education  sector  will \nlead to improved management and sector performance.  \n\nManaging  Education  Initiatives.  Positive  initiatives  are  underway  for  improving \n9.\neducation quality, efficiency, and effectiveness, but need to be managed well. The Government \nis acutely aware of the need to establish standards of education and raise attainment levels for \nthese  standards  through  improved  teacher  qualifications  as  well  as  the  provision  of  adequate \ntextbooks  and  other  learning  materials.  While  additional  teachers  will  be  needed  to  replace \nretirees,  the  deployment  of  teachers  within  districts  and  the  weak  expertise  of  teachers  in \npriority subject areas such as math and science are much greater problems.  \n\n10. While the establishment of BSNP and the development of national education standards \nand minimum service standards (MSSs) has been long overdue, there is a danger that districts \nbe  overwhelmed  if  all  MSSs  are  implemented  simultaneously,  if  the  number  of  MSSs  is \nexcessive,  and  if  the  effort  to  impose  standards  is  too  ambitious.  It  is  therefore  important  that \nimplementation  of  the  MSSs  be  well  sequenced.  Proper  implementation  of  the  national \neducation standards would require (i) sufficient funding; (ii) understanding of what needs to get \ndone  at  the  school  level;  and  (iii)  cooperation  between  MONE,  MORA,  MOHA,  BAPPENAS, \nMOF and local governments. \n\n11.\nThe Government is also aware of the need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of \neducation  service  delivery.  In  the  aggregate,  government  financing  for  education  is  allocated \nefficiently,  as  funds  are  directed  primarily  to  improve  enrolment  levels  and  the  quality  of \noutcomes at the primary and junior secondary levels. The allocative and technical efficiency of \nprimary and junior secondary spending could be further enhanced through (i) the reassignment \nof  teachers across  geographic  areas,  and  (ii)  adjustment  of  the  Bantuan  Operasional  Sekolah \n(BOS) formula to take into account school size. Technical efficiency could also be improved by \nmeeting  education  standards  for  average  class  size  and  average  hours  of  instruction.  In \naddition, decisions related to investments in teacher quality would also need to be reflected in \nthe technical quality of education. \n\nAligning MONE and MORA Policies. Central MONE and MORA policies and strategies \n12.\nneed to be better aligned to support the RPJM as well as district education development plans. \nThe Government\u2019s Medium-Term Development Plan for 2005\u20132009 (RPJM) is characterized by \na  strong  focus  on  policies  and  programs  for  social  justice,  equity  and  quality  of  basic  social \nservices.  Recognizing  the  need  for  urgent  policy  reform,  MONE  and  MORA  have  conducted \ncomprehensive sector performance assessments and developed medium-term plans.5 Although \nboth ministries are governed by the National Education Law of 2003, they formulated separate \neducation strategic plans. Recent measures have sought to better align their policies, strategies \nand  operations  in  support  of  education  service  delivery  at  the  district  level,  and  include  the \ndevelopment  of  a  joint  strategic  plan  for  basic  education.  In  addition,  these  agencies  need  to \nsupport district governments in developing comprehensive education development plans based \non  an  assessment  of  performance  in  terms  of  education  outcomes  and  strategies  to  reduce \ndisparities.  \n\nThere continue to be tremendous opportunities for organizational restructuring within the \n13. \ncentral  government  and  retraining  at  all  levels  of  government  for  improved  planning,  financing \nand \nthe  Government\u2019s \ndecentralization  policies.  Local  government  capacity  for  service  delivery  remains  particularly \nweak.  While  the  provision of  basic  education  services  is  now  an  obligatory  function  of  district \n\nimplementation  of  education  services, \n\nin  accordance  with \n\n                                                \n5  MONE.  2005.  Medium-term  Development  Plan  2005\u20132009.  Jakarta;  and  MORA.  2004.  Madrasah  Sector \n\nAssessment. Jakarta. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n47\n\ngovernments,  it  is  quite  evident  that  management  capacity,  in  terms  of  the  systems  and \npersonnel  in  place  at  the  district  level,  is  inadequate  to  perform  the  expected  functions.  A \nnumber  of  development  partners,  including  ADB,  are  currently  providing  technical  assistance \n(TA) to raise the managerial, technical and financial management capacities at the district and \nschool levels.\n\nRevival  of  Management \n\nInformation  Systems.  One  detrimental  aspect  of \n14.\ndecentralization  in  the  short  term  has  been  the  breakdown  in  data  flows  from  local  to  central \nlevel,  and  the  loss  of  skilled  personnel  to  manage  information  systems.  These  weaknesses \nhave  greatly  impeded  sector-level  planning  for  and  performance  monitoring  of  education \nservices. Similarly, information management systems at the district level are insufficiently user \nfriendly  and  not  results-oriented,  which  undermines  the  operational  planning  and  service \nmanagement  functions  of  local  governments.  These  systems  need  to  be  revived  and  made \nfunctional  to  direct  increasing  education  sector  resources  to  MDG-deficit  areas.  In  addition, \nschool mapping needs to be made more participatory to allow for greater understanding of the \nsocioeconomic and cultural factors that promote or impede the use of education facilities, and to \npromote greater responsibility for the use of school services by communities. \n\nb. \n\nEducation Sector Resources \n\nMedium-term Education Expenditure Framework. Government spending on education is \n15.\nrising, but an overall medium-term expenditure framework with clear roles for the Government and \nother  stakeholders  in  education  financing  is  needed.  In  order  to  implement  the  education  reform \nprogram, national public expenditure on education is projected to rise from Rp42.3 trillion to around \nRp131 trillion (in nominal terms) over the period 2005\u20132007. Approved centrally managed education \nexpenditure is projected to rise from Rp24 trillion to Rp65 trillion over 2005\u20132009. In order to avoid \nany  fiscal  gap,  regional  budgets  for  education  will  need  to  increase  from  around  Rp40  trillion  to \nRp51 trillion over the same period. Community spending is projected to remain roughly constant at \naround Rp10 trillion over the same period, with a rapidly increasing share at post-basic levels.  \n\n16. \nCentral  expenditure  for  formal  basic  education  is  projected  to  rise  from  Rp12.1  trillion  in \n2005  to  Rp19.7  trillion  by  2009,  including  (i)  school  operational  budgets,  (ii)  infrastructure \nrehabilitation and (iii) scholarships for the poor. Consistent with Government priorities, expenditure \non teacher management and quality assurance will rise from Rp3.2 trillion to Rp9.6 trillion over the \nsame  period.  Central  expenditure  on  non-formal  education  is  projected  to  increase  from  Rp0.3 \ntrillion to Rp4.6 trillion by 2009.  \n\n17. \nThe new education financing strategy is expected to increase the volume and share of \ncentral  government  education  expenditure  within  the  poorest  and  currently  underserved  areas \nof  Indonesia.  A  critical  financing  policy  issue  is  to  ensure  that  increased  levels  of  central \ngovernment  spending  on  education  (e.g.  due  to  the  teachers  law  and  BOS)  does  not  lead  to \nlower levels of spending on basic education by local governments. \n\n18. \nIt  is  now  necessary,  however,  to  shift  from  simply  increasing  education  financing  to  a \ngreater focus on increasing efficiency and effectiveness. Improving allocative and cost efficiency \nis  of  particular  importance  in  the  context  of  Indonesia,  where  the  Constitution  mandates  that \n20% of the national budget will be allocated for (non-salary) education expenditures. Financial \ninvestments  to  increase  student  retention  and  transition  and  reduce  dropouts  can  lead  to \ngreater  effectiveness  but  lower  education  system  efficiency.  These  critical  issues  need  to  be \nexplored by the Government to inform policies for financing education. \n\nIncreasing  Education  Access  and  Transition  Rates.  Infrastructure  development  is \n19.\nbeing designed to help increase access to as well as transition rates among different levels of \n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 3\n\neducation. Achieving the MDGs requires getting the last 2.6% of primary (7 to 12 years old) and \n16% junior secondary (13 to 15 years old) school-aged children into school. The large stock of \nprimary schools built in the 1970s needs to be rehabilitated, while expansion and rehabilitation \nis  needed  at  the  junior  secondary  level.  In  order  to  increase  transition  rates,  the  Government \nhas adopted the policy of \u201cone roof\u201d or integrated schools, under which primary schools will be \nupgraded and/or expanded to enroll children at junior secondary levels.  \n\nLinking  Remuneration  and  Outcomes.  Considerable  investments  are  planned  for \n20.\nupgrading the skills of and incentives for teachers and education personnel, but these need to \ntranslate  into  improved  practices  and  performance  at  the  school  level.  The  implementation  of \nthe  new  Teachers  and  Education  Personnel  law,  approved  in  December  2005,  will  have \nsignificant  medium-  to  long-term  implications  for  education  financing.  In  broad  terms,  the \nlegislation provides, by 2016, for a doubling of  the remuneration of teachers through incentive \nawards,  and  for  professional  upgrading  through  education  and  certification.  The  challenge  will \nbe to ensure that any increases in teacher remuneration are linked to gains in (i) efficiency, (ii) \nteacher  performance,  and  (iii)  subsequent  improved  student  outcomes  and  standards. \nUpgrading of teacher skills will need to be managed carefully in integrated schools to ensure a \nbalance between increased work loads and professional development requirements. \n\nResults of Operational Funding Support. Recent operational support funding programs \n21.\nfor  schools  by  the  central  Government  have  had  mixed  results.  Provision  of  resources  for \nrecurrent  expenditures  at  the  school  level\u2014including  student  activities,  maintenance  of \ninfrastructure and equipment, and other administrative expenses\u2014are the responsibility of district \ngovernments. However, the budget allocated by districts for these activities has historically been \nvery small, averaging less than 5% for public primary schools, and less than 10% for public junior \nsecondary  schools.  This  was  a  primary  reason  why  almost  all  public  schools  needed  to  solicit \nparental  contributions  to  close  the  gap  between  funding  requirements  and  the  resources  made \navailable  from  the  district  government.  Poorer  communities  with  limited  resources  to  contribute \ntherefore ended up with poorly funded schools. \n\n22. \nThe situation has been improving, however. The reduction in fuel subsidies in 2005 led \nto the launching that year by the Government of a school operational support program, based \non the number of students per school (the BOS program). An early assessment of the program \nhighlighted implementation challenges, and the risk that increased central-government spending \ncould result in further spending reductions by districts. As a result there could be limited growth \nin  total  public  sector  resources,  with  negative  consequences  for  policy  implementation, \nespecially in terms of quality and standards improvement.   \n\n23.  While  the  BOS  program  has  increased  overall  resources  for  schools  accessed  by  very \npoor  communities,  and  allows  school  principals  the  discretion  to  offer  financial  support  to  poor \nstudents,  this  may  be  negated  by  other  solicitations  for  financial  support  from  parents.  Some \ncommunities are still being asked to make financial contributions which take creative forms, such \nas  \u201cseat\u201d  fees  and  fines  imposed  on  students,  with  negative  consequences  for  the  students\u2019 \naccess  to  and  retention  within  the  education  system.  The  Government  is  therefore  piloting  a \nconditional cash transfer (CCT) scheme, to stimulate demand for basic education by the poor and \ncomplement current programs.  \n\nc. \n\nEducation Sector Governance and Accountability for Outcomes \n\nEducation  Quality.  Education  outcomes,  as  measured  by  international  programs  that \n24.\nassess  student  skills  and  learning  achievement  across  countries,  confirm  the  low  quality  of \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n49\n\neducation in Indonesia.6 Even with the low graduating standard currently in use (i.e. a 42.25% \npass  score),  many  students  do  not  pass.  In  the  2006  national  exam,  8.6%  of  vocational  high \nschool  and  7.43%  of  senior  high  school  students  did  not  pass,  although  there  was  a  marked \nimprovement  in  the  average  scores  of  those  that  did  pass.  Student  examination  performance \nvaries  widely  across  districts.  In  2006,  pass  rates  in  junior  secondary  examinations  averaged \n92%, with a provincial range of 64.7% to 94.3%. Pass rates in poorer, rural and remote areas \nwere  consistently  below  average.  These  results  call  for  measures  to  improve  the  student \nassessment and learning techniques employed in schools. \n\n25. \nThere is strong evidence of high-level leadership and ownership of the education reform \nprogram  in  Indonesia  that  seeks  to  improve  these  sector  outcomes.  The  minister  of  national \neducation has led the formulation of the new education reform program for MONE (RENSTRA \n2005\u20132009),  and  a  joint  strategy  between  MONE  and  MORA  was  completed  in  2006.  The \nreforms  are  based  on  an  extensive  and  inclusive  public  consultation  process  in  five  regions \nduring  2005,  as  well  as  intensive  consultation  with  the  parliamentary  working  group  on \neducation. Vice President Yusuf Kalla has indicated strong government commitment to ensuring \nthat  all  primary  schools  and  madrasah  are  repaired  and  renovated  within  the  current \nGovernment's mandate. Consistent with President Susulo Bambang Yudhoyono\u2019s commitment \nto governance reform, the ministry of education has set a number of measurable anti-corruption \nperformance indicators in the education RENSTRA.7\n\n26.  While  the  support  given  to  reforming  education  services,  which  includes  vital  financial \nsupport,  makes  it  considerably  easier  to  examine  the  systemic  weaknesses  and  devise \nstrategies  to  address  these,  there  is  currently  no  regular  process  within  the  government  for \nmonitoring  the  effectiveness  of  education  policies  and  strategies.  The  Government  has \nembarked on a program to encourage district education development planning as well as school \ndevelopment planning, with regular reporting on the use of funds being submitted to the school \ncommittees and the district education boards, along with annual budget hearings at district and \nnational  legislatures. Despite  these  initiatives,  none  of  these  bodies  are  yet  evaluating  the \nappropriateness  of  legislation,  regulations  and  policies  independently  of  the  executive,  which \nshould  be  their  primary  role  in  a  decentralized  environment.  Regular  budget  hearings  that \nexamine progress towards achievement of national and international targets such as the MDGs \nwould make the process truly results\u2013oriented, and help the executive  focus on the outcomes \nfor which they are ultimately accountable. \n\n27. \nAnother  challenge  for  improving  education  sector  governance  is  the  lack  of  clear \ndelineation of responsibilities among the central, provincial and local governments; although the \nNational Education Law 20/2003 provides some broad assignment of responsibility, it remains \nopen  to  interpretation,  which  has  led  to  a  plethora  of  implementing  regulations  from  different \ncentral government agencies, as well as district governments. \n\nB. \n\nHealth Sector Analysis \n\n1. \n\nCurrent Status of the Health MDGs \n\nMDG 4. The MDG 4 target on infant and child mortality is on track. Indonesia is currently \n28.\non  track  to  achieve  the  MDG  4  target.  The  under-5  mortality  rate  has  already  decreased, \n\n                                                \n6  International  Association  for  Evaluation  of  Education  Achievement.  2003.  Third  International  Mathematics  and \nScience Study. Boston. For 14-year olds, Indonesia ranked 35th, out of 39 countries, in mathematics, and 33rd in \nscience.  OECD.  2003.  Program  for  International  Student  Assessment.  Manila  for  15-year  olds.  Indonesia  ranked \n39th in reading and mathematics, and 38th, out of 41 countries, in science.  \n\n7  These  include  targets  for:  (i)  number  of  anticorruption  charges,  (ii)  amounts  of  funds  subject  to  anticorruption \n\ninvestigation, and (iii) amount of funds subject to reclaim. \n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 3\n\ndropping between 1970 and 2004 from 97 to 38 deaths of children under 5 per 1,000 live births. \nMany factors, both within and outside the health sector, explain Indonesia\u2019s progress during this \nperiod  in  reducing  child  mortality.  However,  sharp  regional  and  socioeconomic  differentials \nremain  in  child  mortality,  and  progress  could  be  more  rapid  with  improved  performance  in \nimmunization,  malaria  control,  water  and  sanitation  and  maternal-child  nutrition,  and  with \nimproved quality and accessibility of maternal neonatal and child health (MNCH) services. \n\nMDG  5.  The  MDG  5  target  on  maternal  mortality  is  not  likely  to  be  achieved  by  2015 \n29.\ngiven  current  progress.  Although  considerable  progress  appears  to  have  been  made  toward \nachieving the MDG 5 target, progress to date has not been sufficiently rapid to indicate that this \ntarget  is  likely  to  be  achieved  by  2015.  The  estimated  maternal  mortality  ratio  (MMR)  has \ndeclined  from  390  to  307  maternal  deaths  per  100,000  live  births  between  1991  and  2002. \nDuring  the  period  1992  to  2005,  the  percentage  of  births  assisted  by  skilled  health  personnel \n(an  important  MDG  5  intermediate  outcome  indicator)  has  increased  from  40.7%  to  72.0%. \nHowever, there are still sharp regional and socioeconomic differentials in this indicator, and 42% \nof rural births are still assisted by traditional birth attendants. If Indonesia is to attain the targeted \ndecline  in  the  MMR,  and  achieve  significant  decreases  in  child  mortality  (MDG  4),  more \nemphasis is needed on delivering in health facilities (hospitals, primary health centers or private \nmaternity  clinics)  instead  of  in  homes;  home  births  currently  account  for  at  least  59%  of  all \nbirths.\n\nMDG 6. Several targets on communicable disease control\u2014of HIV/AIDS and malaria\u2014\n30.\nare  not  likely  to  be  achieved  by  2015  given  current  progress.  Indonesia  is  not  on  track  to \nachieve  the  communicable  disease  control  MDG  targets.  Currently,  the  HIV  epidemic  is \nconcentrated in a few high-prevalence groups (i.e., commercial sex workers and injected drug \nusers). The challenge is to prevent its further spread into the general population. Condom use \nwith  high-risk  partners  is  still  low,  while  comprehensive  correct  knowledge  about  HIV/AIDS  is \nstill limited to the better educated, including among youth. Unless more effective measures are \ntaken in the future, it is unlikely that Indonesia will have halted and begun to reverse the spread \nof HIV/AIDS by 2015. \n\n31. \nReliable information about malaria incidence is currently unavailable in Indonesia because \nof the poor condition of the national health information system and, more importantly, because up \nto 90% of malaria cases are treated outside health facilities (for example, using drugs purchased \nover  the  counter).  Nearly  one-half  of  Indonesia\u2019s  population  currently  lives  in  malaria-endemic \nareas. Although bed net coverage is reasonably high (40% of children under 1 year of age were \nreported  to  have  slept  under  a  bed  net  in  2000),  use  of  insecticide-treated  bed  nets  and  indoor \nspraying are still limited. Unless funding for malaria control is increased significantly in the future, \nit is unlikely that malaria incidence will have begun to decrease by 2015. \n\n32. \nIndonesia currently has one of the highest estimated rates of TB prevalence in the world. \nAlthough the directly observed treatment\u2014short course (DOTS) success rate is currently at the \ntargeted 85%, the DOTS detection rate was only 57% in 2004. Unless the DOTS detection rate \nis  increased  dramatically  in  the  future,  it  is  unlikely  that  TB  prevalence  will  have  begun  to \ndecrease by 2015. \n\n2. \n\nHealth Resources \n\nUnderfunding of the Health Sector. Indonesia\u2019s health sector has been under-funded \n33.\nfor  many  years,  both  by  the  Government  and  by  households.  Government-financed  health \nexpenditures averaged less than 3% of total central government expenditure and about 0.5% of \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  during  the  period  1985  to  2002.  Per  capita  public  health \nexpenditure (i.e., central government plus donor-financed health expenditure) ranged between \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n51\n\n$2 and $6 during this period. Household-financed health expenditure is estimated to account for \nabout 68% of total health expenditure, implying that per capita total health expenditure averaged \nonly about $12 during this period. Despite recent efforts by the Government to increase public \nexpenditure in the health sector, total public health expenditure remained low, at about 17% of \nGDP in 2006. \n\nHealth  Sector  Government  Budgets.  Because  of  the  non-transparent  government \n34.\nbudgeting and reporting system, there is little information currently available on the allocation of \nresources within the government health system, either at the central level or in the provinces and \ndistricts. However, the available data suggest that there is substantial variation among provinces \nin per capita levels of public health expenditure that is unrelated to high MMR or infant mortality \nrates.  The  available  data  also  indicate  that  the  allocation  of  central  health  funding  among \nprovinces tends to exacerbate rather than reduce inequalities between provinces in public health \nspending. \n\nShortages and Misallocation of Health Personnel. Due to chronic under-funding and \n35.\na government-wide freeze on civil service employment during the 1990s, the Indonesian health \nsector  faces  an  acute  shortage  of  personnel  compared  to  other  countries  in  the  region. \nMoreover, there is a serious misallocation of health personnel (and especially of doctors) within \nthe government health system. The available evidence suggests that the quality of Indonesia\u2019s \nhealth personnel is rather poor, due to the poor quality of education and training institutions, and \nthe absence of re-licensing and re-certification requirements and effective continuing education \nprograms. Another problem is the mismatch, particularly at the central level, between the skills \nneeded  to  manage  a  modern  health  system  and  the  narrow,  mostly  medical  qualifications  of \nexisting MOH staff. \n\nSparse Government Health Infrastructure. There are relatively few hospital beds per \n36.\ncapita,  and  primary  health  centers  serve  relatively  large  populations.  However,  the  limited \ngovernment  health  infrastructure  is  fairly  equally  distributed  among  regions.  There  is  little \ninformation available on the current condition of government health infrastructure, which is still \nmaintained, renovated and replaced through centrally managed transfers, such as the DAK. \n\n3. \n\nHealth Processes \n\nLow  Health  System  Productivity.  Productivity  of  health  services  is  relatively  low  in \n37.\nIndonesia. In addition, productivity levels vary considerably among government health facilities, \nreflecting personnel allocations that are unrelated to actual workloads and generally low levels \nof service utilization. However, productivity is also low in the government health system because \npersonnel are poorly motivated and supervised. In one recent study, for example, it was found \nthat 40% of government health staff in primary health centers were absent from their facilities for \nreasons other than off-site duties. Possible solutions to low productivity include the introduction \nof performance-based incentives by third-party payers (for example, PT Askes) and increased \naccountability of health facilities to the communities they are designed to serve. \n\nLow  Health  Service  Utilization.  Utilization  rates  at  most  government  health  facilities \n38.\nare  low.  Community  health  centers  (CHCs)  are  in  competition  with  many  providers  (including \nself treatment, other government providers, and even with the private practices of CHC staff) for \nboth curative and preventive care. The CHC is not the preferred source for many types of health \nservices. The quality of care in government health facilities is considered by the population to be \npoor  (with,  for  example,  limited  access  to  doctors),  staff  are  frequently  absent,  and  drugs  and \nsupplies  are  frequently  out  of  stock.  In  a  2004  household  survey  in  32  districts  of  eight \nprovinces, non-poor households were more than twice as likely to prefer to visit a private doctor \nif seriously ill than to visit a CHC. \n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 3\n\n39. Weak Accountability to Communities. Local accountability to the communities served \nis  still  weak  within  the  government  health  system.  Limited  community  oversight  of  health \nfacilities  exists  at  the  district  level.  Although  there  is  a  national  policy  to  have  community \noversight at the sub-district level (i.e., at the level of community health centers), this policy has \nnot yet been widely implemented.\n\n4. \n\nHealth Outputs \n\nHealth services include not only curative and preventive services delivered to individuals, \n40. \nbut also important \u201ccollective\u201d services, such as health education, disease surveillance and vector \ncontrol  that  are  delivered  to  communities.  Outputs  are  generally  measured  at  the  facility  level \nthrough  routine  reporting  systems.  However,  because  routine  reporting  systems  are  weak  in \nIndonesia  and  because  of  the  important  role  of  the  private  sector,  it  is  necessary  to  rely  on \nhousehold survey data for assessments of both service quality and quantity. \n\nHealth  Services  Obtained  from  Public  and  Private  Providers.  Several  types  of \n41.\npreventive  care  are  critically  important  to  the  achievement  of  the  health  MDGs,  including \nimmunization  (affecting  child  and  maternal  mortality,  and  TB  infection  among  young  children), \nantenatal care (affecting maternal and child mortality), obstetric delivery care (affecting maternal \nand  neonatal  mortality),  and  family  planning  (affecting  maternal  and  child  mortality).  In \nIndonesia,  all  of  these  services  are  obtained  from  both  public  and  private  providers,  although \nmost immunization is done by public providers. \n\nVarying Quality of Care. Primary health care is provided by a wide range of providers \n42.\nin  Indonesia,  with  important  differences  in  access  to  many  types  of  providers  between  urban \nand/or  suburban  and  rural  areas.  In  terms  of  curative  care,  many  Indonesians,  especially  the \npoor, rely on self treatment using drugs purchased over the counter. Self treatment is a serious \nproblem  not  only  because  the  quality  of  care  is  believed  to  be  poor  but  also  because  the \ninappropriate use of drugs contributes to the development of resistant strains of diseases such \nas  malaria  and  TB.  Access  to  medical  doctors  for  primary  curative  care  is  mainly  limited  to \nurban and upper-income Indonesians. Although there is no systematic information available on \nthe  quality  of  either  primary  or  referral  curative  care  in  Indonesia,  the  available  evidence \nsuggests that it is rather poor, apart from that obtained from qualified medical doctors. \n\nImmunization Coverage. Immunization coverage remains high but seems to have been \n43.\ndecreased  recently  from  90%  in  1991  to  85%  in  2005.  There  are  still  sharp  regional  and \nsocioeconomic  differences  in  immunization  rates,  stemming  in  part  from  higher  immunization \ndropout rates among poorer children. \n\nPercentage  of  Obstetric  Deliveries  in  Health  Facilities.  Obstetric  delivery  care  is \n44.\ncurrently  obtained  from  a  range  of  providers,  including  traditional  birth  attendants,  with  72%of \ndeliveries assisted by nurses or midwives. The best delivery care is provided in hospitals, health \ncenters  or  in  private  maternity  clinics  (usually  operated  by  private  midwives).  Poorer  quality \ndelivery  care  is  available  in  women\u2019s  homes,  where  at  least  60%  of  deliveries  still  occur.  In \nrecent years, many home births have been assisted by professionally trained village midwives, \nwho are gradually replacing traditional birth attendants in providing home delivery care. Further \nreductions in maternal and neonatal mortality require that an increasing percentage of deliveries \noccur  in  health  facilities,  where  services  are  better  and  where  referral  care  can  be  obtained \nrelatively quickly, should the need arise. \n\nPoor Availability and Quality of Family Planning Services. Antenatal care and family \n45.\nplanning  services  are  also  mainly  provided  by  nurses  or  midwives.  Village  midwives  currently \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n53\n\nprovide  about  20%  of  family  planning  services.  The  available  evidence  (based  on  information \nprovided by respondents in household surveys) suggests that the quality of both antenatal and \nfamily  planning  services  is  poor.  Providers  tend  not  to  follow  standard  treatment  protocols, \nespecially  for  less  well-educated  clients  (and  probably  also  for  poorer  clients).  The  poor  also \nhave reduced access to relatively expensive sterilization services, which are not subsidized by \nthe national family planning program. \n\nLimited Access to Diagnostic Services in Rural Areas. Little information is available \n46.\nregarding the quality or accessibility of public and private diagnostic services. However, access \nto  diagnostic  services  is  limited  in  rural  areas,  as  indicated  by  the  fact  that  only  about  half  of \nreported  malaria  cases  are  confirmed  through  laboratory  testing.  It  is  also  known  that \ngovernment laboratories frequently experience shortages of reagents and other materials, while \nquality assurance systems have not been implemented in most laboratories. \n\nSome Public Health Services are Ineffective. Public health services, including health \n47.\neducation,  disease  surveillance  and  vector  control,  have  been  provided  by  Indonesia\u2019s  public \nhealth system for many years. There has been some success with health education, particularly \nin  family  planning,  but  there  are  also  many  examples  where  increased  knowledge  has  not \ntranslated into changed behavior. The available evidence indicates that recent efforts to inform \nthe population (including youth) about HIV/AIDS have not been very effective. Average levels of \nknowledge  are  low,  and  there  are  sharp  differences  between  people  with  different  education \nlevels. Disease surveillance also needs strengthening in relation to HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB.  \n\n5. \n\nInstitutional Capacity \n\nNeed  for  Stewardship  Role  by  Central  MOH.  Sector  management  includes  health \n48.\npolicy, regulation, information and research functions. Overall health policy in Indonesia appears \nto be on the right track (i.e., recognizes a need to focus scarce public resources and to develop \nstrong  public-private  partnerships).  However,  it  is  proving  difficult  to  implement.  The  two  most \nimportant  health  policy  changes  in  recent  years  have  been  the  2001  decentralization  and  the \nestablishment  of  the  ASKESKIN  (health  fund  for  the  poor)  program.  In  the  case  of \ndecentralization, the MOH has not been very successful to date in shifting its main focus from \nservice delivery (which is now mainly the responsibility of districts) to overall sector stewardship.  \n\nLinking  Regulatory  Capacity  and  Policy.  Health  sector  regulation  has  received  some \n49.\nattention  for  many  years.  However,  the  development  of  regulatory  capacity  and  its  use  as  an \neffective policy tool has not been a priority within the health sector. Little use has been made of \nlicensing, certification and other regulatory tools to improve facility and personnel standards.  \n\nHealth Information System Strengthening. Government health information systems have \n50.\nbeen a weak link in the public health system for many years and have become even weaker since \nthe 2001 decentralization. Consequently, Indonesia has had to rely on household surveys to provide \ninformation on health status and on health service utilization. Unfortunately, this does not meet the \nneeds of programs such as malaria and TB, which need timely local area data on disease incidence \nin order to allocate their resources effectively. The most promising opportunity to strengthen health \ninformation systems is probably through increased reporting by health insurers, especially if health \ninsurance schemes increasingly cover the services of private providers. \n\nC. \n\nConclusions \n\nRevise Incentives to Redirect Provider Behavior. Indonesia is unlikely to achieve all \n51.\nof the health MDGs by  2015 if the past approaches are not changed. The key challenge is to \nimprove the efficiency of the health system. At this time, the effective use of incentives for both \n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 3\n\nproviders  and  the  population  is  the  key  to  achieving  the  health-related  MDGs.  Additional \nprovider  incentives  would  probably  not  be  necessary  in  an  effective  public  health  system,  but \nIndonesia\u2019s  public  health  system  has  become  essentially  a  \u201cprivatized\u201d  system,  in  which \npersonnel  respond  mainly  to  material  incentives  (including  those  afforded  by  their  part-time \nprivate practices). In this situation, revised incentives are needed to channel provider behavior \nin directions that contribute to accelerated achievement of the health-related MDGs. \n\nSupporting  Pro-Poor  Health  Programs.  Since  there  are  large  differentials,  both \n52.\nregionally  and  among  various  socioeconomic  groups,  in  most  of  the  MDG-related  impact  and \nintermediate outcome indicators, a key part of any strategy to ensure achievement of the health \nMDGs  must  include  finding  ways  to  direct  additional  resources  to  poor,  under-performing \nlocalities,  as  well  as  to  the  poor  regardless  of  where  they  reside.  However,  these  additional \nresources should not be channeled directly to providers, as has been done in the past. Instead, \nthe additional resources should be channeled to the target population (i.e., to the demand side) \nso that accountability between providers and clients is strengthened. ASKESKIN represents the \nculmination of several years of testing various approaches to providing targeted health financing \nfor the poor. Although the program still has some limitations, ASKESKIN is likely to accelerate \nthe achievement of the health MDGs by improving access by the poor to health services. \n\nProviding  Incentives  to  Redirect  Consumer  Behavior.  Conditional  cash  transfers \n53.\n(CCTs) are needed to compensate poor women for the time they spend obtaining cost-effective \nhealth  care  for  themselves  and  their  children.  Time  is  often  a  poor  person\u2019s  only  productive \nresource, and women\u2019s time is particularly scarce. CCTs are an effective way to overcome the \nopportunity cost of women\u2019s time as a barrier to health-care utilization. They can also be used to \nprovide additional incentives for particularly critical types of health care (for example, to ensure \nthat all children are fully immunized or to promote birthing in health facilities). Plans are currently \nbeing  made  to  pilot  CCTs  in  Indonesia.  Scaling  up  the  pilots  will  be  an  important  additional \nmeasure to accelerate achievement of the health MDGs. \n\n\fi\n\n \nn\no\ni\nt\na\np\nc\ni\nt\nr\na\np\n \ny\nt\ni\nn\nu\nm\nm\no\nc\n

FUND: INDONESIA \nAugust 28, 2007 \n\nStaff Assessment of Developments and Policies \n\nRecent Developments and Short-Term Prospects \n\nEconomic growth reached 5\u00bd percent in 2006 as the dip in activity following the late 2005 \nfuel  price  and  interest  rate  hikes  proved  shallow.  Strong  exports  compensated  for  weak \ndomestic  demand.  Notwithstanding  heightened  risks  to  the  outlook  from  a  possible  slowing  of \nU.S.  growth,  staff  still  projects  GDP  growth  at  around  6  percent  in  2007  with  some  shift  from \nexternal  to  domestic  demand.  Inflation  has  fallen  in  recent  months  to  around  6  percent\u2014the \nmiddle of the 2007 target range of 5\u20137 percent\u2014allowing Bank Indonesia (BI) to lower its policy \nrate further to 8\u00bc percent. The external current account surplus is projected to narrow from 2\u00be \npercent  of  GDP  to  around  1\u00be  percent  in  2007  as  lower  global  growth  and  commodity  prices \nreduce  exports.  The  central  government  deficit  increased  modestly  to  1.0  percent  of  GDP  in \n2006. For 2007, staff projects a somewhat higher deficit of around 1.6\u20131.8 percent of GDP. \n\nAlong with other emerging markets, Indonesia\u2019s equity and bond markets were hit by the \nrecent turmoil in global financial markets. The extent of the sell-off was relatively high in a \nregional  comparison,  but  it  followed  a  prolonged  period  of  increases,  driven  by  the  abundant \nglobal risk appetite as well as domestic factors such as declining interest rates and perceptions \nof  reduced  vulnerability  and  improving  economic  prospects.  Portfolio  capital  flows  mirrored \nthese  developments  as  foreign  investors  increased  their  positions  in  Indonesian  securities \nduring most of 2007, then reduced exposure since mid-July. After appreciating in May vis-\u00e0-vis \nthe U.S. dollar in response to portfolio inflows, the rupiah has subsequently fallen by around 7 \npercent  (3\u00bd  percent  since  the  Article  IV  consultation  in  mid-July),  but  remains  within  a  range \nconsistent with external competitiveness and macroeconomic stability. \n\nBanking  sector  indicators  have  strengthened,  although  the  impact  on  balance  sheets \nfrom  the  recent  market  turmoil  has  yet  to  be  fully  assessed.  Over  the  past  year,  bank \nprofitability has improved. The banking system is well capitalized and nonperforming loans are \nlow for private banks. State banks\u2019 non-performing loans have fallen significantly but still remain \nhigher. Overall, with the improving indicators, the banking system appears to be in a relatively \ngood  position  to  weather  the  recent  global  financial  market  turmoil.  Direct  exposure  to \ncollateralized debt obligations (CDOs) or other structured credit products appears minimal and \nIndonesian  financial  markets  have  so  far  remained  sufficiently  liquid  during  periods  of  market \npressure.\n\nSimilarly, external vulnerability indicators have improved over the past year, helping the \neconomy to weather recent volatility. Fiscal deficits are modest and public debt is 2 declining, \nthe external current account is in surplus, and the exchange rate is broadly market determined, \nwith  some  symmetric  market  intervention  to  smooth  volatility  and  automatic  purchases  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s foreign exchange receipts. The ratio of total external debt to GDP is expected to \ndecline  to  less  than  20  percent  of  GDP  by  2012,  from  35  percent  in  2006,  while  government \ndebt (including domestic debt) is projected to decline from 39 percent of GDP to 26 percent over \nthe same period. A steady build-up of reserves and lower external borrowing have increased the \nratio of reserves to short term debt to more than 150 percent. \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n73\n\nNonetheless,  downside  risks  remain  to  the  positive  outlook,  in  particular  related  to  the \nglobal  financial  market  turmoil  and  its  impact  on  global  growth.  While  reduced \nvulnerabilities have put the Indonesian economy in a good position to weather moderate external \nshocks (see adverse macro scenarios in the 2007 Article IV staff report), a sharper than expected \nslowdown  in  global  economic  growth  and  a  sustained  reduction  in  risk  appetite  could  have  a \nsignificant  negative  impact  on  the  Indonesian  economy.  The  main  risks  arise  from  potentially \nlower  export  demand  and  commodity  prices,  reduced  access  to  financing  and  higher  financing \ncosts, and possible balance sheet impacts of lower asset prices and a depreciated rupiah. \n\nMacroeconomic and Structural Policies \n\nThe  government  continues  to  implement  its  comprehensive  reform  agenda  to  boost \ngrowth  over  the  medium  term.  Key  elements  of  the  strategy  include  policies  to  strengthen \nfinancial  intermediation,  improve  the  business  climate,  and  increase  infrastructure  investment. \nWhile substantial progress has been achieved, including passing of a new investment law and \nseveral  fiscal  reforms,  other  measures,  particularly  with  respect  to  the  labor  market,  have \nencountered resistance. \n\n(cid:120)\n\n(cid:120)\n\n(cid:120)\n\n(cid:120)\n\nWith  respect  to  monetary  policy,  Bank  Indonesia  (BI)  has  responded \nflexibly to shocks to inflation and output, while building the credibility of its \nnewly  established  inflation  targeting  framework.  The  latest  policy  meeting \nsaw  a  pause  in the  current  rate-cutting  cycle,  in  response  to  the  recent \nweakening in the rupiah and uncertainty over the fall-out from the global financial \nturmoil. Staff judge that room for further rate cuts will remain limited, particularly \nsince the full effect of recent rate cuts is likely still to be felt and the currency has \nshown some renewed weakness in recent months. \nIn  the  staff\u2019s  view,  the  recent  relaxation  of  prudential  regulations  to \nencourage lending is not likely to have much impact on lending growth. At\nthe same time, the steps represent a departure from international standards and \nrisk having an adverse signaling effect on supervisors and banks alike. With bank \nlending  already  increasing,  in  the  staff\u2019s  view  BI  should  reconsider  the \nappropriateness  of  the  measures  as  soon  as  possible.  Moral  suasion  to \nencourage banks to lend to specific 3 sectors could result in credit misallocation \nand  should  also  be  avoided.  Instead,  staff  has  encouraged  the  authorities  to \nstrengthen  efforts \nthe  development  of  capital  markets  and \ninstruments of longer-term financing and to develop a strategy on the future role \nof state banks. \nThe authorities\u2019 projected fiscal stance is appropriate. The modest relaxation \nin  deficit  targets  for  2007  and  2008  provides  some  room  for  additional \ndevelopment  spending  while  ensuring  further  declining  debt  ratios.  Further \nimprovements \nthe \nstreamlining of expenditures, including through greater flexibility of energy prices, \ncould create additional space for priority spending, such as infrastructure, health, \nand  education.  Enhancing  the  implementation  capacity  of  local  government \nwould also contribute to this effort. \nThe  authorities  have  made  good  progress  in  fiscal  reform.  Recent\nachievements  include  the  restructuring  of  the  tax  agency  and  the  adoption  of  a \nkey  tax  reform  bill.  The  planned  introduction  of  a  fiscal  risk  statement  and  the \nmedium-term  fiscal  framework  in  the  2008  budget  should  help  to  further \nstrengthen fiscal management. \n\ntax  administration,  some  new \n\ntax  measures,  and \n\nto  promote \n\nin \n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 6 \n\n(cid:120)\n\n(cid:120) \n(cid:120) \n\nStatus of IMF Relations \n\nStructural  reforms  have  advanced  with  the  recent  passage  of  the \ninvestment  law  and  the  presentation  of  a  new  economic  policy  package. \nWhile publication of the negative list for foreign investors raised some concerns \nin  the  foreign  business  community,  the  law  retains  a  broadly  open  investment \nregime and clarifies existing ownership limits, which were previously opaque. The \nprivatization process has also been restarted, with the sale of a minority stake in \na  major  state  owned  bank  in  July.

National level progress in meeting the MDG targets obscures vast differences across regions \nand  districts,  rural  and  urban  areas,  and  income  groups,  and  between  men  and  women.  The \nPRMAP  provides  financial  resources  to  support  the  Government  in  implementing  its  MDG-\nrelated  public  expenditure  programs  more  effectively,  through  policy,  institutional,  legal  and \nregulatory  reforms \nIt  builds  on  and  enhances \nimplementation  and  effectiveness  of  existing  government  programs  and  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB)-supported assistance in poverty reduction, gender mainstreaming, and health and \neducation.\n\nthe  education  and  health  sectors. \n\nin \n\nThe proposed technical assistance (TA) complements the PRMAP by directly supporting \n2. \nthe achievement of national policy objectives aimed at improving access to and efficiency and \nperformance of government programs. TA is provided to support achievement of key health and \neducation-related actions in subprogram 2 (SP2, April 2007\u2013March 2009). Specific SP2 policy \nactions have been identified for TA support, based on their strategic impact and added value for \nthe Government in accelerating MDG outcomes in health and education. The following criteria \nwere applied in prioritizing TA support for SP2 actions: (i) requests by government agencies to \nimplement PRMAP reforms, (ii) alternative financing sources available to support inputs leading \nto  SP2  actions,  and  (iii)  the  size  of  TA  budget  support  for  PRMAP.  The  TA  complements \nongoing  ADB-supported  initiatives  that  aim  to  expand  access,  improve  the  quality  of  services, \nand  enhance  governance  and  accountability  in  both  health  and  education.1  Concerted  efforts \nhave  been  made  to  synergize  activities  with  other  donor-assisted  programs  to  ensure \ncomplementarity in advancing achievement of the MDGs (see Supplementary Appendix E).  \n\nB. \n\nThe Proposed Technical Assistance  \n\n1. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n3. \nThe  impact  of  the  proposed  TA  is  to  strengthen  social  service  delivery  within  a \nframework for accelerated achievement of the MDGs (\u201cMDG acceleration\u201d) at the national level. \nThe  TA  supports  the  decentralization  process  through  national  policy  reforms  in  health  and \neducation.  The  TA  complements  the  PRMAP,  and  supports  improvements  for  more  efficient \npublic spending in health and education.  \n\n                                                \n1   The  TA  complements  ongoing  ADB-supported  initiatives:  ADB.  2001.

The TA includes three sets of outputs at the national \nlevel to support: (i) Badan Perancanaan Pembangunan Nasional (BAPPENAS) and the Ministry \nof Finance (MOF) in achieving PRMAP SP2 cross-sectoral policy actions; (ii) BAPPENAS, the \nMinistry  of  National  Education  (MONE)  and  the  Ministry  of  Religious  Affairs  (MORA)  in \nachieving  PRMAP  SP2  education-related  policy  actions;  and  (iii)  BAPPENAS  and  Ministry  of \nHealth (MOH) in achieving PRMAP SP2 health-related policy actions. Additional support might \nbe  provided  to  other  line  ministries,  as  identified  during  implementation.  Figure  1  above \ncaptures suggested activities under each output. \n\na. \n\nSupport  for  Cross-Sectoral  National  Policy  Reforms  for  MDG \nAcceleration\n\n5. \nComponent  1  will  support  three  policy  actions  under  SP2:  (i)  recommendations  for \nstrengthening  the  technical  guidelines  of  the  Dana  Alokasi  Khusus  (DAK),  (ii)  finalization  of \nselected  sex-disaggregated  MDG  health  and  education  indicators,  and  (iii)  development  of  a \nMDG roadmap and preparation of general guidelines on mainstreaming the MDGs into district \nmedium-term development plans and district poverty reduction strategies.  \n\nImproved  DAK  Technical  Guidelines  for  the  Education  and  Health  Sectors.  The \n6.\nDAK  is  one  of  the  instruments  available  to  the  Government  to  transfer  financial  resources  to \ndistricts  for  sector-specific  investments.  The  DAK  remained  undeveloped  until  recently; \nhowever, in recent years, the Government has significantly increased the size and the scope of \nthe DAK allocated for the health and education sectors. The TA will support MONE, MOH and \nBAPPENAS in evaluating the current patterns of allocation and utilization of the education and \nhealth  DAK  by  district  governments.  The  TA  will  also  assist  in  the  design  and  evaluation  of \ndifferent options to transform the sectoral DAK into a more relevant instrument for (i) targeting \nfunds  to  specific  districts  with  insufficient  resources  for  health  and/or  education,  (ii)  improving \ndistrict  performance  in  those  sectors  at  the  district  level,  and  (iii)  encouraging  districts  to \nincrease the quantity and efficiency of their own resource investment in MDG-related areas. The \nvarious  dimensions  of  the  education  and  health  DAK  (i.e.,  allocation  levels  to  each  district, \nconditionalities  and  monitoring  systems)  will  be  further  developed  in  order  to  transform  the \nprogram,  and  to  ensure  that  funding  for  MDG-related  education  and  health  expenditures  is \nprovided in an efficient, equitable, transparent and stable manner. \n\nSex-Disaggregated MDG Indicators. Achieving gender equity in accessing health and \n7.\neducation services is an important aspect of accelerating achievement of the MDGs. Two MDGs \nfocus directly on women\u2014MDG 3 (promoting gender equality and empowerment of women) and \nMDG  5  (improving  maternal  mortality).  Indicators  selected  to  measure  progress  in  achieving \nMDG  3  and  5  do  not  require  data  to  be  disaggregated  by  sex,  but  achievement  needs  to  be \nplaced  within  a  wider  gender  context.  The  TA  will  support  BAPPENAS  in  coordinating  the \nfinalization  of  key  indicators  among  MONE,  MORA,  MOH,  and  the  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s \nEmpowerment (MOWE) for selected MDGs in health and education. These selected indicators \ncould be used to monitor MDG-related progress within their respective sectors, and help target \nresources more efficiently for accelerating MDG achievement. Support for this policy action will \nneed to be coordinated closely with support provided by the TA for other policy actions.\n\nEstablish a Planning Framework for MDG Acceleration. In coordination with the MDG \n8.\nTARGET program supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and ADB\u2019s \nTA  6762-INO:  Pro-poor  Planning  and  Budgeting,  the  TA  will  assist  BAPPENAS  prepare \nguidelines  to  (i)  encourage  and  assist  local  governments  to  mainstream  the  MDGs  in  their \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n79 \n\nmedium-term  and  annual  development  plans,  budgets  and  poverty  reduction  strategies;  and  (ii) \nencourage MONE, MOHA, MORA and MOWE to include MDG and targets in their medium term \nand  annual  plans.  The  TA  will  also  support  BAPPENAS  and  Menko  Kesra  (the  Coordinating \nMinistry  of  Social  Welfare)  in  the  preparation  of  a  comprehensive  roadmap  for  accelerating \nattainment of MDGs. The roadmap could include strategies for: (i) development of an institutional \nframework  for  acceleration  of  the  MDGs,  involving  key  central  government  ministries  and  local \ngovernments;  (ii)  increasing  public  awareness  about  the  MDGs;  (iii)  approaches  to  increase  the \ninvolvement  of  civil  society,  the  private  sector  and  research  institutions  in  efforts  to  attain  the \nMDGs;  (iv)  improving  data  collection,  processing  and  monitoring  mechanisms,  and  reporting  of \nMDG-related indicators; (v) assessing cost and budget implications for achievement of the MDGs; \nand (vi) developing sectoral policies for consideration by Government ministries in their medium-\nterm development plans. \n\nb. \n\nSupport  for  National  Policy  Reforms \nAcceleration\n\nin  Education  for  MDG \n\n9. \nComponent 2 will support MONE and MORA in reaching two policy actions under SP2: \n(i)  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  different  strategies  and  programs  in  meeting  the  basic \neducation  objectives  in  the  Grand  Design  for  Nine  Year  Basic  Education  2005-2009,  and  (ii) \ndemonstration of use of the \u201cCitizens Report Card (CRC) for Education\u201d for surveying mothers \nand fathers (or guardians) on their satisfaction with the service delivery of local school systems.  \n\nEducation  Sector  Performance  Assessment  and  Monitoring.  MONE  and  MORA \n10.\ncompleted a joint-plan (the \u201cGrand Design\u201d) in 2007 for the completion of 9-year basic education \nthat  presents  a  combined  vision  from  both  ministries  aimed  at  achieving  national  education \nobjectives, including basic education. The TA will support activities to assess education sector \nperformance prior to development of the new medium-term plan for national education in 2009, \nand related investment plans of MONE, MORA and district governments. \n\nPiloting  the  Citizens  Report  Card  for  Education.  The  CRC  approach  and  survey \n11.\nmethodology  was  developed  with  ADB  assistance,  on  the  premise  that  feedback  from \ncommunities  that  use  public  services  provides  reliable  and  relevant  information,  which  is \nneeded to improve governance and delivery of public services. Based on CRC survey results, \nrecommendations for improvement may not necessarily entail additional financial costs. The TA \nwill support efforts to enhance local accountability in the delivery of basic education services by \nadapting the CRC approach to the Indonesian context. A research institute will be recruited to \nundertake the planning, administration, and analysis of the survey. The institute will be required \nto submit time-bound reports on findings at different stages. \n\nc. \n\nSupport for National Policy Reforms in Health for MDG Acceleration \n\n12. \nComponent  3  will  support  MOH  in  strengthening  policy,  strategies  and  financing  aimed  to \nimprove  access  to  and  efficiency  and  quality  of  health-related  MDG  services  (e.g.,  maternal  and \nchild health, reproductive health, and HIV/AIDS). The TA will support MOH in undertaking five policy \nactions under SP2, and initiate background assessments to implement SP3 including: (i) review and \nimprove the criteria used for centrally provided budget allocations for maternal neonatal and child \nhealth (MNCH) and communicable disease control (CDC) activities; (ii) support an analysis leading \nto a set of recommendations for the revision of the ASKESKIN program design and implementation \nmodalities;  (iii)  support  an  evaluation  of  contract  provider  payment-schemes,  especially  (a)  the \nimpact of such schemes on the distribution of providers in poor/remote areas; and (b) utilization of \nhealth-related MDG services (i.e. MNCH and CDC), especially by women; (iv) assist in finalizing the \nrevision of a ministerial regulation regarding health-related minimum service standards (MSSs); and \n(v) assist  in the development of a national health accounts (NHAs) program.  \n\n\f \n80\n\nAppendix 8 \n\nImproved  Budget  Allocation  for  MNCH/CDC  Programs.  The  Government  needs  to \n13.\nincrease future health funding, and MOH will need to improve targeting of budget allocations so \nas to benefit (i) MDG-related health programs and (ii) areas with poorer health outcomes. The \nTA  will  assist  MOH  in  reviewing  the  current  criteria  used  for  centrally  provided  budget \nallocations for MNCH/CDC, and will help formulate possible mechanism(s) whereby a portion of \nthe  central  MOH  budget  may  be  used  to  improve  the  level  and  allocation  of  direct  and \noperational budgets for health programs and activities at local government levels. Further, the \nTA  will  assist  in  analyzing  MOH  budget  and  expenditures  allocations  for  MDG-related  health \nprograms  to  better  estimate  central  budget  resources  required  to  meet  MDG-related  health \noutcomes.  In  addition,  the  TA  will  assist  in  analyzing  options  for  improving  the  efficiency  and \nequity of MDG-related health services delivery through development of: (a) formulae to allocate \ncentral government budget for each MDG program among provinces and from the provinces to \nthe  districts;  (b)  mechanisms  to  utilize  central  government  budget  to  leverage  additional  local \ngovernment  allocations;  and  (c)  mechanisms  to  link  central  government  budget  allocations  to \nimproved local government reporting on utilization of supported services. The criteria that MOH \ndevelops would be coordinated with the cross-sectoral efforts under the PRMAP TA to develop \nallocation formula options for the health DAK based on the identification of MDG-deficit districts \n(i.e., those which lag behind in achievement of the selected MDG-related indicators). \n\nRecommendations for ASKESKIN Program Improvements. The ASKESKIN program \n14.\nwas  introduced  by  MOH  in  2005  to  (i)  improve  targeting  of  government  budget  resources  to \nfinance  health  services  utilized  by  the  poor,  (ii)  increase  financing  for  operational  and \nmaintenance expenses of public sector health facilities, and (iii) increase the efficiency of funds \nmanagement  by  contracting  a  third-party  agency  to  independently  manage  the  funds  and \nprovider  contracts.  Since  2005,  the  program  has  evolved  by  allowing  fee-for-service  payment \nwith  both  public  and  eligible  nongovernment  providers  (i.e.  midwives  and  select  private \nhospitals). The TA will support MOH in developing a set of recommendations for the revision of \nthe  ASKESKIN  program  design  and  implementation  modalities,  including  appropriate  provider \npayment  mechanisms, reimbursement  levels  for  specific  services  that  directly  impact  on  MDG \noutcomes. This analysis will take into account evaluations of ASKESKIN and other appropriate \nhealth-related  MDG  efforts,  feedback  related  to  recent  program  adjustments,  and  the  longer-\nterm development of Indonesia\u2019s national health insurance policy and design. \n\nIncreasing Health  Providers  in  Remote  Areas.  The  ratios  of  physicians,  midwives, \n15.\nand  nurses  to  the  population  are  below  the  \u201c2010  Healthy  Indonesia\u201d  targets,  and  there  are \nsignificant  variations  in  the  distribution  of  health  personnel  per  capita  between  provinces  and \namong  districts.2  MOH  uses  a  number  of  means  to  attract  primary  healthcare  providers  (e.g., \nphysicians  and  midwives)  to  remote  and  underserved  areas.  For  instance,  MOH  has  adopted \nmixed  provider  payment  mechanisms  through  ASKEKSIN  that  influence  financial  incentives \naffecting provider location choices and service provision behavior. The TA will support MOH in \nconducting an evaluation of the contract provider payment-schemes on: (i) their effectiveness in \nreaching  women  and  those  in  poor  and/or  remote  areas,  (ii)  the  impact  of  the  scheme  on \nutilization  of  MNCH/CDC  services,  and  (iii)  the  impact  of  the  scheme  on  the  distribution  of \nprimary  healthcare  providers  across  provinces  and  districts.  This  TA  will  also  review \ninternational  experience  regarding  alternative  options  used  to  reduce  inequities  in  provider \ndistribution,  and  the  impact  on  service  use  and  MDG  reduction  targets.  This  will  require \ndocumentation of the different modalities currently used to attract and retain health personnel in \nremote and underserved areas, with particular attention to increasing the provision of integrated \nprimary  health  services  for  women  and  children  in  the  community.  TA  input  will  complement \nrather than duplicate studies under development by World Bank involving health-related human \nresource issues in Indonesia. \n\n                                                \n2   Ministry of Health. 2006. Subnational Health System Performance Assessment. Jakarta. \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n81 \n\nMeeting National Standards in MNCH/CDC. GOI has advised all ministries to define a \n16.\nstandard  set  of  indicators  estimating  the  minimum  services  standards  (MSS)  to  be  met \ncountrywide. The establishment of MSS for the health sector is expected to help meet national \npriorities,  including  attainment  of  the  MDGs.  The  MOH  ministerial  decree  of  2003  related  to \nMSSs is currently being revised. The updated MSSs decree is expected to identify intermediate \nindicators,  for  child  nutrition,  MNCH,  HIV/AIDS,  malaria,  and  tuberculosis.  The  fundamental \nprinciples  and  objectives  of  MSS  need  to  be  clarified  and  a  methodology  developed  in \nformulating its implementation and monitoring. The TA will work closely with MOH and MOHA to \nclarify objectives and to improve health-related MSS to ensure that health-related MDG services \nare included. The TA will assist MOH to formulate criteria for inclusion of relevant programs and \nindicators  for  the  health-related  MSS.  It  will  also  assist  MOH  to  ensure  that  central  and  local \ngovernment obligations are clearly identified in the MSS, including financial obligations. The TA \nwill  support  the  finalization  of  the  ministerial  decree  and  complement  ongoing  efforts  by \nDeutsche Gesellschaft fur Technishe Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) related to the MSS. \n\nInstitutionalizing  a  National  Health  Accounts  Program.  NHAs  provide  data  and \n17.\nanalysis of total public and private expenditure for health by payer, financing intermediary, and \nprovider.  NHAs  may  also  provide  analysis  of  expenditure  by  program,  type  of  input,  and \ngeographic area. Institutionalization of NHAs in Indonesia may be used to improve targeting of \npublic  expenditures  on  health-related  MDG  programs  and  on  those  districts  with  poor \nachievement  related  to  MDG  indicators.  NHAs  data  collection  and  analyses  will  help  improve \nmonitoring  of  health  public  expenditure  against  specific  outcomes  (e.g.,  access  and  equity  of \nallocation,  and  allocation  and  technical  efficiency).  To  improve  the  quality  of  information  and \nanalysis of total and public expenditures for health, BAPPENAS plans to institutionalize a NHAs \nprogram  in  Indonesia.  The  TA  will  support  BAPPENAS,  MOH  and  other  stakeholders  in  the \ndevelopment  of  a  roadmap  for  a  NHAs  program  for  Indonesia.  The  roadmap  will  consider  the \ndevolution  to  the  district  level  of  decision-making  authority  over  public  health  spending  and \nindependent  implementation  of  district  health  accounts  analyses,  so  as  to  improve  the \nevaluation  by  districts  of  allocation  and  the  technical  efficiency  of  resource  use.  The  roadmap \nwill explore ways in which district-level health accounts can be undertaken and institutionalized \nto  facilitate  an  ongoing  program.  Pilot  district  health  accounts  analysis  will  be  supported \nnationwide to ensure that common methodological approaches are used. \n\n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n18. \nThe  TA  will  be  implemented  in  parallel  with  the  PRMAP  and  will  cover  a  period  of  20 \nmonths,  from  1  January  2008  to  31  August  2009.  Implementation  arrangements  for  both  the \nproposed  TA  and  the  PRMAP  will  be  the  same,  so  as  to  ensure  synergy  between  the  program \nloan  cluster  and  the  TA.  BAPPENAS  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  line  ministries \nresponsible for the various sectors will act as the implementing agencies. The steering committee \nestablished for PRMAP will be the same for the TA. It will be chaired by BAPPENAS and include \nrepresentatives  of  MOF,  MOWE,  MOH,  MONE,  MORA,  and  MOHA.  The  proposed  TA  is \nestimated at $2.7 million, of which ADB will finance $1.5 million as a grant, with the Government\nproviding  counterpart  support  equal  to  $200,000  equivalent.  The  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  (AusAID)  will  provide  $1  million  in  parallel  co-financing.  Table  A8.1 \ncontains the cost estimates and financing plan. \n\n19. \nA  team  of  international  specialists  (total  46  person-months)  and  national  experts  (31 \nperson-months),  supported  by  ADB,  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  following  the  quality-  and  cost-\nbased selection method and using a full technical proposal. A team of international specialists \n(total 30 person-months) and national experts (40 person-months), supported by AusAID on a \nparallel  basis,  will  be  recruited  individually.  A  research  institute  with  significant  experience \nworking  with  governments  on  governance  and  public  service  delivery  issues  will  be  recruited \n\n\f \n82\n\nAppendix 8 \n\nthrough  direct  selection  to  undertake  the  Citizen  Report  Card  satisfaction  survey  for  basic \neducation.  The  outlined  terms  of  reference  (TOR)  and  person-months  for  each  specialist  are \nfound in Supplementary Appendix E.\n\n20. \nBAPPENAS will be supported by an international MDG advisor in the development of a \ngeneral  framework  for  MDG  acceleration.  This  advisor  will  also  act  as  the  team  leader  for  the \nTA.  BAPPENAS,  MONE,  MORA  and  MOH  will  also  be  supported  by  specialists  and  experts \nwith  expertise  in  gender,  data  management,  financial  management,  education  performance \nmonitoring and assessment, learning assessments, health financing and insurance, and health \nsystems support. They will be responsible for submitting reports to ADB, the Government, and \nAusAID.  Emphasis  will  be  on  technical  content  rather  than  administrative  aspects,  describing \nthe  advice  provided  to  the  Government  in  simple  terms.  Technical  briefs  will  be  prepared  by \nconsultants  on  a  needs-basis.  Individual  output  reports  from  each  sector  will  be  submitted  to \nBAPPENAS and other relevant ministries, ADB, and AusAID for review and comments prior to \nfinalization. Each report will be finalized after incorporating the comments received. \n\nTable A8.1: Indicative Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($'000)\n\nTotal Cost \n\nItem \nA. ADB Financinga\n\n1.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?  \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \n\n  Yes \n    No \n\nIs the sector identified as a national priority \nin country poverty partnership agreement?  \n\n Yes \n  No \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted intervention (non-income MDGs)\n\nThe  Government  of  Indonesia  (the  Government)  aims  to  (i)  enhance  the  quantity  as  well  as  quality  of  public \nexpenditures; (ii) improve local government accountability, while maintaining the basic principles of regional autonomy; \nand  (iii)  adopt  sound  and  sustainable  resource  allocation  mechanisms  to  target  poverty  reduction  and  accelerated \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (\u201cMDG acceleration\u201d) in areas that lag behind. In recent \nyears, fiscal consolidation has been at the center of the Government\u2019s macroeconomic management. Since the Asian \nfinancial  crisis  of  1997,  the  Government  has  instituted  a  number  of  structural  reforms  across  different  sectors  to \nremove  the  distortions  that  led  up  to  the  crisis  in  1997.  However,  in  the  past  the  Government  has  been  unable  to \nmaintain its development expenditures, especially on education and health.  \nThe Government\u2019s National Poverty Reduction Strategy (SNPK) has identified a lack of access to key basic services \n(e.g., health and education)  and to economic opportunities as factors contributing to  poverty. The SNPK aims to: (i) \nestablish Indonesia\u2019s commitment to poverty reduction, (ii) build consensus on poverty eradication, (iii) underline the \ncommitment  to  achieving  the  MDGs,  and  (iv)  synchronize  poverty  reduction  activities.  It  is  incorporated  into  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  (RJPM)  2004\u20132009.  To  implement  the  SNPK,  the  Government  is \npreparing a national poverty reduction action plan in consultation with relevant stakeholders. The current draft is in-line \nwith the priority areas of the 2007 budget. \nThe  proposed  impact  of  the  Poverty  Reduction  and  MDGs  Acceleration  Program  (PRMAP)  is  to  accelerate  progress \ntowards achieving the MDGs in education (MDG 2), health (MDGs 4, 5, 6) and contribute to the Government\u2019s poverty \nreduction  agenda  (MDG  1),  and  gender  equality  (MDG  3).  The  program  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s national priorities as reflected in the existing RPJM. The PRMAP is aligned with the Government\u2019s systems \nand  assistance,  and  supports  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  increase  spending  directed  to  attainment  of  the  MDGs.  The \nproposed  TA  for  strengthening  social  sector  services  delivery  supports  these  actions  and  reforms  in  the  health  and \neducation sectors.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nIndonesia  spans  an  archipelago  of  over  17,000  islands,  of  which  about  7,000  are  inhabited  by  approximately  235 \nmillion people, living in about 440 districts in 33 provinces. An estimated 742 ethnic groups and languages are found \nin Indonesia, and many Indonesians identify themselves with a specific language and/or island. Based on household \nsurvey data, poverty incidence has fallen from 23% in 1999 to 16% in 2005. According to the international poverty line \n($1/day), poverty incidence is estimated at 7% based on purchasing power parity. About 49% of the population lives \non $2 per day (2005). By 2009, the target is to reduce poverty (with respect to the national poverty line) to about 8.2%. \nHowever, in March 2006, poverty incidence increased to 17.7%, following the fuel subsidy reductions and an increase \nin the price of rice in 2005. \nLack  of  access  to  key  social  sector  services  such  as  health  and  education  is  one  of  the  main  causes  of  poverty  in \nIndonesia. Lack of access to basic education significantly decreases productivity and personal income. Lack of access \nto  affordable  health  services  affects  the  health  status  of  individuals  and  poor  health  decreases  productivity  and \npersonal income. The poor are more vulnerable to health shocks due to high medical expenses for treating diseases, \nlost school and work days for recovery, high transportation costs, and other access barriers. The opportunity cost of \ncompleting basic education is also greater for children, especially girls, from poor households.\nNational-level progress in achieving the MDGs obscures vast differences across regions and districts, rural and urban \nareas, income groups and genders. The Human Development Report (2006)1 ranked Indonesia 108th (HDI value of \n0.71) among 177 nations in terms of the human development index (HDI). In 2002, the HDI value for Indonesia was \n0.66, but across regions, the HDI ranged from 0.76 in Jakarta to 0.47 in the Jayawijaya district in Papua. Indonesia\u2019s \nnational gender-related development index (GDI) for 2002 shows the male adult literacy rate to be 93.5%, while the \nfemale  rate  was  85.7%.  Variations  among  provincial  and  district  GDIs  are  also  evident.  In  2002,  the  GDI  in  DKI \nJakarta was 66.7, in Bangka Belitung 47.7, in Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam 55.5, and in North Maluku 31.2. \nDuring  program  preparation,  the  Policy  Matrix  for  PRMAP  was  reviewed  from  the  perspective  of  assessing  (i)  the \npotential  for  adverse  poverty  and  social  impacts,  if  any,  of  the  policy  actions  and/or  reforms;  (ii)  areas  for  gender \nmainstreaming and/or enhancement through (a) additional actions, if any, or (b) rephrasing of actions that are more \nconducive to mainstreaming efforts; and (iii) areas for enhancing collection of regional and district-level information to \ninform future policy actions. The policy actions in the Policy Matrix were also assessed to determine potential adverse \nimpacts on deepening social and regional disparities. As a result of the assessment, some policy actions were refined \nand/or better explained in the accompanying sector write-up.  \nC.  Participation Process\nIs there a stakeholder analysis?\n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\nThe  program  and  the  TA  have  been  prepared  based  on  extensive  consultations  with  a  wide  range  of  government \nofficials,  development  partners  and  other  concerned  stakeholders.  Sector  specialists  have  shared  the  policy  matrix \nwith  respective  development  partners  in  health  and  education  sector  forums.  BAPPENAS  and  other  concerned  line \nministries have provided direction and suggestions, which have fed into the design of the PRMAP and TA.

New York. \n\n\f84\n\nAppendix 9 \n\npolicy dialogue with the Government, development partners, and other concerned agencies is required to achieve the \nsubprogram 2 and 3 actions and overall program outputs.  \n\nIs there a participation strategy?\n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\nA  participation  strategy  has  been  integrated  into  the  policy  actions  framework.  It  identifies  the  lead  line  ministries \nresponsible  for  achieving  each  policy  action.  The  policy  measures  aimed  at  improving  governance  and  monitoring \nsystems  focus  on  enhancing  the  potential  benefits  of  decentralization  by  making  social  sector  services  more \nresponsive to local preferences and making service providers more accountable to their clients. Civil society, private \nsector and research institutions will participate in the preparation of the roadmap for MDG acceleration under SP2. \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe joint-donor Country Gender Assessment for Indonesia (2006)2 and meetings with key informants in the Ministry of \nWomen\u2019s Empowerment, National Development Planning Agency, Ministry of National Education, Ministry of Religious \nAffairs, and Ministry of Health, and partner agencies, provided the context for assessing the affects of the policy matrix \non gender issues  within the health and education sectors. Policy actions in the matrix  were refined according to the \nmethodology described in section B. The disaggregation  of information by sex,  and consideration  of specific gender \nchallenges in health and education are basic requirements for effective monitoring of policy conditions, achievement of \nSP2 policy actions, and more equitable allocation of budgetary resources. \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nin  health  and  education  cater  to \n\nA  policy  output  for  gender  mainstreaming  has  been  included  under  the  cross-sectoral  section  of  the  policy  action \nthe  specific  non-formal  education  and \nmatrix  (PO.4).  Specific  actions \nmaternal/reproductive health needs of women. For instance, the PRMAP includes a policy action that mandates that \n40% of representatives on district education boards and school committees be female (Policy actions 12.22). Similarly, \nthe PRMAP includes policy actions aimed at increasing the supply of health providers in underserved areas through \nreimbursements for midwives on a fee-for-services basis for comprehensive obstetric care and antenatal care (Policy \naction  15.3).  A  gender  specialist  will  also  be  recruited  under  the  TA  to  support  gender  mainstreaming  efforts  in \nachieving SP2 policy actions. A summary of gender impacts is included in the main text of the RRP (para. 120). \nE.

For  example, \npolicy actions aim at providing affordable health services \nby  improving  delivery  mechanisms  for  health  financing \nand  insurance  through  a  third  party  (PT  Askes),  and \nimproving access to education by implementing a general \nsubsidy for school operational support. \nThe  PRMAP,  through  its  policy  reforms,  is  not  expected \nto  adversely  affect  the  labor  market  and/or  displace \nindividuals from their jobs. Through policy support and TA \nsupport,  the  PRMAP  will  contribute  to  better  recruitment \nand deployment of teachers. The PRMAP will also help to \nincrease  the  number  of  healthcare  providers  through \nreimbursement, \nthrough  ASKESKIN,  of  emergency \nobstetric and antenatal health services for the poor. \nThe PRMAP is not expected to adversely affect the ethnic \npopulation through the implementation of policy actions or \nthe TA. The PRMAP aims to address regional and social \ndisparities \nrecognized  as  slowing  MDG \nachievement.  National  policy  actions  and  reforms  have \nbeen  assessed  for  their  impact  on  poverty,  gender  and \nethnic groups. \n\nthat  are \n\nPlan\nRequired\n\n Full \n Short \n None \n\n Yes \n  No \n\n Yes \n  No\n\n Yes \n  No \n\n Yes \n  No\n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\nNone. \n\n                                                \n2  ADB. 2006.
