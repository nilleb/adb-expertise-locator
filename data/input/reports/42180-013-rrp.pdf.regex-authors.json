I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on two proposed \nloans to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Second Public\u2013Private Infrastructure \nDevelopment Facility.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  Impressive economic growth. Bangladesh has achieved substantial economic growth \nover the last 15 years. From 1996 to 2009, the gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a \ncompounded annual growth rate of 5.6%. In FY2012, the Bangladesh economy grew at 6.2%, \nmainly as a result of manufacturing and agricultural sector growth; this was a slight decrease \nfrom 2011, when the economy grew at 6.7%.2 \n \n3.  Deficient  infrastructure.  Underinvestment  results  in  serious  constraints  in  the \navailability and reliability of Bangladesh\u2019s infrastructure\u2014including electrical power, natural gas \nexploration, ports, railways, and roads\u2014and prevents the country from achieving its full growth \npotential. Continued underinvestment has resulted in poor access to basic infrastructure for \nmuch  of  Bangladesh's  population,  particularly  the  rural  population,  and  those  who  are \neconomically disadvantaged. Deficient infrastructure and the lack of regional integration restricts \ninvestment, including foreign direct investment.3 \n \n4.  Bangladesh suffers from a chronic shortage of electrical power which, adversely impacts \nthe economy. Gas is the main energy source used for generating electricity, but is insufficient to \nmeet the current demand. The supply of electrical power is 28% short of demand.4 Energy \nshortages are undermining the country\u2019s competitiveness causing an annual estimated loss of \n2% of GDP; the situation is not expected to improve in the short term, because gas production \nis projected to decline beginning in 2019.5 Securing new sources of energy locally or abroad \n(e.g., coal or liquid natural gas) will take time because of the need for policy decisions largely \nrelated to setting energy tariffs at market levels. Energy efficiency measures can, to some \nextent, provide a cost-effective response to energy shortages. Poor road conditions and lack of \ntransportation and means of communication (only 1.5% reported to have access to a fixed-line \ntelephone service) add to the costs for Bangladesh\u2019s economy and leave the potential for \ngrowth in rural areas unfulfilled. Access to hygienic sanitation and safe water is alarmingly \ninadequate.  In  addition,  Bangladesh  cannot  reach  its  full  potential  to  be  a  transport6 and \ntransshipment hub, and this limits the country\u2019s opportunities for economic integration with its \nneighbors. \n \n5.  The public sector is the main provider of basic infrastructure in Bangladesh, as is the \ncase in most of South Asia. However, public financing alone cannot generate the investment \nneeded to provide the required level of infrastructure facilities. The financial performance of \nmost  public  service  providers  is  weak,  with  inadequate  investment.  The  government  has \nrecognized the need to create an enabling environment to attract sustained private investment, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB. 2013.

Dhaka. \n5  ADB. 2011. The Comprehensive Private Sector Assessment of Bangladesh. Manila. \n6  As a result of inadequate transport infrastructure, the average cost of exports is estimated to be 80% higher and \n35% for imports higher than for most countries in South Asia. ", "2 \nand introduced (i) a public\u2013private partnership (PPP) budget for FY2010, and the Policy and \nStrategy for Public\u2013Private Partnership (PPP), 2010;7 and (ii) enabling arrangements to bridge \nthe  deficit  in  infrastructure  financing,  especially  for  long-term  funds.  These  arrangements \ninclude  establishment  of  the  Bangladesh  Infrastructure  Finance  Fund  Limited,  a  long-term \ncapital  funding  vehicle  that  seeks  to  raise  debt  capital  markets  funding  from  retail  and \ninstitutional investors to support construction and take-out financing for PPP subprojects.8 \n \n6.  Underdeveloped capital markets. Private investors in Bangladesh face challenges in \nsourcing  domestic,  long-term  financing  for  infrastructure.  Bangladesh\u2019s  capital  markets, \nincluding the long-term corporate debt market, remain underdeveloped.9 The volume of funding \nsourced from the local debt and equity market for private investment expenditure is small, and \nprivate  sector  sponsors  rely  primarily  on  banks  and  internal resources  rather than market \nborrowings, indicating weakness in debt markets. Banks in Bangladesh are facing maturity \nmismatches in their asset and liability management; they rely on short-term deposits as their \nfinancial source, and this prevents them from providing long-term financing for infrastructure \nsubprojects. Currently, the Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) is the only \nfinancial institution in Bangladesh that has the ability to provide long-tenor dollar financing. \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for Bangladesh emphasizes the need for \nsupport of private sector-led infrastructure development. This is in line with Bangladesh\u2019s Sixth \nFive-Year Plan for 2011\u20132015, which focuses on increasing the growth rate of the economy and \nreducing  poverty  by  substantially  boosting  private  sector  investment  and  developing \ninfrastructure.  In  particular,  it  emphasizes  the  need  to  triple  investment  in  infrastructure \ndevelopment, from 2% to 6% of GDP, with substantial private sector participation through PPPs. \nThe project objectives are also in line with ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational Plan,10 which \nprioritizes capital market development for infrastructure finance and financial inclusion. \n \n8.  The proposed Second Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Development Facility (PPIDF II) will \nbuild  on  the  efforts  of  the  Public\u2013Private  Infrastructure  Development  Facility  (PPIDF  I)  by \nhelping to provide long-term debt financing and catalyze private sector participation through \nIDCOL. This will support poverty reduction through enhanced investment, economic growth, and \nincreased employment opportunities. The design of the project will attract commercial financing \nfor infrastructure subprojects, thereby reducing the pressure on the government budget. An \nadditional objective of the project is to help provide the rural population and small- to medium-\nsized enterprises in off-grid areas with access to electricity generated using solar and other \nrenewable technologies. \n \n9.  Overview of the Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Development Facility. PPIDF I was \napproved on 2 October 2008 and was designed to (i) provide $82 million financing to the \ngovernment for relending to IDCOL to finance private sector-sponsored large infrastructure \nsubprojects (component A); (ii) provide $50 million equivalent in support to the government for \nrelending  in  local  currency  to  IDCOL  to  finance  small-  and  medium-sized  infrastructure \n                                                \n7  A draft PPP law, developed with ADB assistance, is expected to be approved by Parliament prior to the 2013 \nand/or 2014 elections; it includes rules relating to approval and assessment of all PPP subprojects in Bangladesh. \n8  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Development Partnership Program for South Asia. Manila (RETA 6337, \nBangladesh: Fund Management Support for Infrastructure Finance [Subproject 20]). \n9  ADB is supporting reforms to develop a more enabling public environment for the capital markets in Bangladesh \nand thereby mobilize private funding.

Manila (LN2951/52/53\u2013BAN, \napproved on 28 November). \n10 Asian Development Bank. 2011. Financial Sector Operational Plan. Manila (http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/ \n    financial-sector-operational-plan.pdf) \n ", "3 \nsubprojects  (component  B);  and  (iii)  provide  $33  million  in  funding  to  the  government  for \nrelending in local currency to IDCOL for the purpose of promoting renewable energy systems in \nBangladesh (component C). In addition, supplementary grant financing totaling $3.3 million from \nthe Asian Clean Energy Fund and the Climate Change Fund for component C was approved on \n17 May 2011. \n \n10.  Current status of Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Development Facility. As of August \n2013, $22.2 million has been disbursed under component A of PPIDF for the partial funding of a \nsubloan ($30 million total) for a 108 megawatt heavy furnace oil-based power project in the \nChittagong area sponsored by a local company. It is expected that the total subloan amount will \nbe fully disbursed by IDCOL by September 2013. IDCOL\u2019s board has further approved another \nsub-loan  of  $30  million  for  a  gas-fired  power  plant  outside  of  Dhaka.  IDCOL  is  in  final \nnegotiations with the sponsor to provide a senior loan of up to $30 million for the financing of a \n335 megawatt gas-fired power plant. \n \n11.  Full utilization of Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Development Facility. It is expected \nthat component A of PPIDF I will be fully utilized by the first quarter of 2014. Under component \nB, ADB has made only one disbursement of $4.9 million in April 2010 to provide IDCOL with \nfunds to finance two companies involved in the information technology sector. Given the rapid \nand  successful  utilization  of  the  funds  for  IDCOL\u2019s  renewable  energy  program,  ADB \nManagement reallocated the remaining undisbursed amount ($45 million) to component C, \nbringing the total loan amount under component C to $78 million. This was used by IDCOL to \nfinance 330,362 solar home systems (SHSs). As of June 2013, components B and C had been \nfully utilized, except for a liquidation of imprest advance of $3.3 million. IDCOL is implementing \ntwo supplementary grants totaling $3.3 million from the Asian Clean Energy Fund (administered \nby ADB) and the Climate Change Fund to provide grant subsidies to the SHS program and \nfinance two or three solar mini-grid pilot systems, as well as 100 fiberglass bio-digesters. \n \n12.  Lessons learned. While PPIDF II represents a continuation of the first facility, it builds \non lessons from PPIDF I and includes new features: (i) the total cost of eligible subprojects is \nreduced from $30 million to $10 million to facilitate the financing of a larger number of medium- \nto large-size infrastructure subprojects; (ii) the component for financing small- and medium-\nsized  infrastructure  subprojects  (up  to  $5  million)  is  eliminated,  because  such  funding  is \navailable locally; (iii) IDCOL intends to increase the participation of women in the training and \nawareness campaign on renewable energy applications to 20%; (iv) although the introduction of \na comprehensive environmental and social management system has worked well and has \nhelped to enhance the capacity of IDCOL to assess environmental and social issues associated \nwith subprojects, training of project sponsors and cofinanciers on such issues will be continued; \n(v) IDCOL has adopted a policy to ensure women\u2019s concerns are considered during the SHS \ninstallation process;11 and (vi) an enhanced battery recycling policy is included in the IDCOL \nSHS program. \n \n13.  Proposed financing modalities. PPIDF II comprises two outputs: (i) output 1 will use \nthe proceeds from the ordinary capital resources sovereign loan of up to $100 million to provide \nIDCOL with long-term additional resources for the financing of medium- to large-sized private \nsector-led infrastructure subprojects (total subproject cost $10 million or more); and (ii) output 2 \nwill route the proceeds from the sovereign Asian Development Fund loan of up to $10 million \nthrough IDCOL for the further expansion of the successful SHS program, which has provided \nfinancing of more than 2 million SHSs through a microfinance-based, direct sales program in \n                                                \n11 IDCOL has adopted a new policy that requires staff of participating organizations to focus more on consultations \nwith female household members during SHS installations to ensure that the installation of items such as light bulbs \nand power outlets meet the needs of women. \n ", "4 \nrural off-grid areas to provide households and small businesses with a renewable source of \nenergy. Output 1 will provide funding directly to subborrowers by providing long-term loans to \ninfrastructure subprojects, while output 2 will channel funding from IDCOL through participating \norganizations to the end-users, which are typically households in off-grid areas. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The impact of the project will be enhanced development of infrastructure, including \nrenewable  energy  facilities.  The  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  increased  private  sector \nparticipation in infrastructure development, including in renewable energy facilities. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  The two outputs aim to address Bangladesh\u2019s infrastructure deficiencies by providing \ninfrastructure financing, including for renewable energy, in light of the country\u2019s substantial \nexposure to climate change-induced risks. \n \n16.  Output 1: Financing of medium- to large-sized private sector-led infrastructure \nsubprojects. The output will be achieved by providing a foreign currency denominated credit \nline of $100 million. The eligible subsectors, which meet the government\u2019s current priority plan, \ninclude: (i) power generation\u2014given the country\u2019s acute power shortage this is expected to \nreceive priority in terms of financing; (ii) roads and bridges; (iii) railways; (iv) ports (including \nseaports and airports); (v) gas and gas-related infrastructure; (vi) water supply, sewage, and \nsolid waste management; (vii) information technology; (viii) renewable energy; and (ix) other \ninfrastructure development subprojects as may be approved by the government, ADB, and \nIDCOL\u2019s board. This output will enable IDCOL to provide dollar or taka funding for up to 40% of \nthe costs of an individual private sector-sponsored subproject that is financially viable and has \nan economic rate of return of at least 12%; the subproject sponsor will be required to invest a \nminimum of 20% of the total subproject cost as equity, thereby better balancing the risk factors \nbetween the subproject sponsor and the government via IDCOL. The current pipeline includes \neight subprojects with a total investment amount of approximately $235 million, all in the energy \nsector.  IDCOL  is  presently  conducting  due  diligence,  including  social  and  environmental \nsafeguards, on these subprojects. The company is also intensifying its collaboration with the \nPPP office, which has a list of more than 20 transactions in other (non-power) sectors.12 \n \n17.  Output  2:  Financing  of  IDCOL\u2019s  SHS  program.  The  output  will  be  achieved  by \nproviding IDCOL a credit line of $10 million for its ongoing SHS program, which is a demand-\ndriven model for increasing access to electricity in remote rural areas, where grid connections \nare economically unfeasible or will not be made in the next 10 years. IDCOL first financed SHSs \nin collaboration with the World Bank in 2002. The initial target of financing 50,000 SHSs was \nachieved in August 2005, 3 years ahead of the target date, and $2 million below estimated \ncosts. The company achieved its target of 2 million installations in April 2013, and has now \nincreased its goal, seeking to finance 4 million SHSs by 2015. \n \n18.  The  IDCOL  SHS  program  provides  refinancing,  sets  technical  specifications  for \nequipment,  develops  publicity  materials,  extends  loans,  oversees  system  installation  and \nmonitors system performance, and provides maintenance support. In particular, IDCOL provides \n \n \n                                                \n12  IDCOL will coordinate with the PPP office as required under the Policy and Strategy for Public\u2013Private Partnership \n(PPP), 2010. \n ", "5 \n(i) loans at 6%\u20138% (per annum) to participating organizations,13 which then provide customers \nin rural areas with financing of up to 80%  of  the  cost  of  an  SHS  with  a  capacity  of  10\u2013130 \nwatts;14 (ii) loans to companies for biomass installations in rural or semi-urban areas, and \nfinancing for commercial and semi-commercial biogas plants or biogas-based electricity plants; \n(iii) loans and grants for solar irrigation pumps; and (iv) loans and grants to companies for the \nfinancing of solar mini-grid systems. \n \n19.  Households can pay for SHSs with cash or credit. Participating organizations extend \nloans on various terms and conditions to the households for purchase of SHSs. The loan tenor \nvaries from 1\u20135 years, and the interest rate varies from 8%\u201315% per annum on a declining \nbalance method, and 10%\u201315% per annum on equal principal payment method. In all cases, \npayments are made monthly. \n \n20.  Use of donor funds. Funds used by IDCOL for refinancing stem primarily from donor \nloans channeled through the government. IDCOL\u2019s main responsibility is to raise and channel \nfunding in the form of loans to participating organizations and to monitor the overall performance \nof SHS program.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n21.  The project is estimated to cost $385.5 million (Table 1). The government has requested \na loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance output 1 of the \nproject. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility,15 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreement. The loan proceeds will be relent to \nIDCOL in (i) dollars at LIBOR plus 100 basis points per annum and for a 20-year term with a \ngrace period of 5 years, or (ii) in taka at the Bangladesh bank rate with a 20-year term and a \ngrace period of 5 years pursuant to a subsidiary loan agreement, with the government bearing \nthe foreign exchange risks. Onlending by IDCOL to eligible private sector subprojects will be at \ninterest rates that reflect IDCOL\u2019s cost of funds plus a spread to cover transactions costs and \nrisks following full commercial and competitive terms at IDCOL\u2019s discretion. \n \n22.  The  government  has  also  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR6,599,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance output 2 of the project. The \nAsian Development Fund loan will have a 25-year term, a 5-year grace period, and an interest \ncharge of 2.0% per annum throughout the loan tenor, and such other terms and conditions set \n                                                \n13 IDCOL\u2019s renewable energy program is innovative because it is implemented through participating organizations, \nwhich are nongovernment organizations, microfinance institutions, and private entities. These organizations select \nsubproject areas and potential customers, extend loans, install the systems, monitor their performance, and \nprovide maintenance and technical support; this allows IDCOL to benefit from their grassroots networks, which are \nvital for introducing efficient technology to underdeveloped rural areas and encouraging community participation. \n14 SHSs are small photovoltaic systems with a peak capacity of 10\u2013130 watts; they comprise a solar panel, battery, \ncharge controller, wires, and loads. The estimated lifespan of the SHS outputs is: solar panel, 20 years; battery, 5\u2013\n7 years; charge controller, 3 years. Maintenance and service are provided at no cost for 3 years (systems are \nchecked by staff of a participating organization while collecting the monthly installment payments). After the 3-year \npayback period, maintenance is provided by the participating organizations for a minimal monthly fee. Because \nSHS users own their systems, they will be motivated to keep the system running. Monthly installment payments \nend after the payback period, and thus payment of a small monthly service fee and replacement of the battery \nevery 5 years will not be a major financial obstacle. SHSs are used mainly by low- and middle-class households, \nand micro- and small enterprises in off-grid rural locations to operate light bulbs, small electrical appliances such as \nmobile chargers, and black and white television sets. The price of a typical 50 watt SHS is about $400. \n15  The interest includes a maturity premium of 10 basis points. This is based on the above loan terms and the \ngovernment\u2019s choice of repayment options and dates. \n ", "6 \nforth in the draft loan and project agreement. The government will make the loan available to \nIDCOL at a fixed rate of 3% under a subsidiary loan agreement with a term of 20 years and a \ngrace period of 5 years. The proposed onlending terms reflect current market rates for this type \nof intervention (the financing of renewable energy installations in rural areas in Bangladesh). \nThe government will bear the foreign exchange risk. \n \n23.  ADB has agreed on collaborative cofinancing arrangements for output 2 with the World \nBank and Japan International Cooperation Agency.16 \n \nTable 1: Financing Plan \n  Amount  Share Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nADB  110.0  28 \nOutput 1 (OCR)  100.0  26 \nOutput 2 (ADF)  10.0  2 \nCofinanciers  195.5  51 \nWorld Banka  99.5  26 \nJICAb  96.0  25 \nGovernment  30.0  8 \nPrivate sector investorsc  50.0  13 \nTotal  385.5  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, JICA = Japan International Cooperation \nAgency, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \na The Second Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development Project of the World Bank consists of a loan \nof $99.45 million from the International Development Association to support Infrastructure Development Company \nLimited\u2019s solar home system  (SHS) program and a loan of $16.55 million for the financing of solar mini-grid \ninstallations. \nb JICA approved in March 2013 a concessional loan of $122.48 million for IDCOL\u2019s SHS program under the \nRenewable Energy Development Project of which $96 million is earmarked for IDCOL\u2019s SHS program. \nc This assumes that the sponsor will provide equity financing of 20% of total project cost\u2014private sector banks and \nfinanciers will provide debt funding of 40% of total project cost while IDCOL will finance 40% of each project, which \nis the maximum threshold permitted under its investment guidelines. \nSource: Asian Development Bank and Government of Bangladesh estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  It  is  proposed  that  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  acting  through  its  Economic  Relations \nDivision,  will  be  the  executing  agency  while  the  Finance  Division  will  be  the  financial \nmanagement  agency,  and  IDCOL  will  be  the  implementing  agency  of  the  project.  Policy \ndirection and strategic oversight will be provided by IDCOL\u2019s board of directors. IDCOL\u2019s project \nmanagement unit, established under PPIDF I, will (i) monitor the day-to-day implementation of \nthe loans; (ii) build capacity within IDCOL in areas of monitoring exposure limits, process \nimprovements,  risk  assessment,  and  analysis;  and  (iii)  ensure  compliance  with  state  and \nnational policies and IDCOL's environmental and social safeguard framework, which ensures \ncompliance with ADB safeguard policies and national norms. \n \n25.

The advance to the \nimprest account should not exceed 6 months\u2019 estimated cash flow \nrequired  for  payments  to  be  made  to  subborrowers  for  eligible \nsubprojects. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, IDCOL = Infrastructure Development Company \nLimited, OCR = ordinary capital resources, PMU = project management unit. \na An oversight body is considered unnecessary because IDCOL operates on autonomous basis and is governed by \nits board of directors. The secretary of the Economic Relations Division serves as the IDCOL Board Chairman. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Infrastructure Development Company Limited. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n26.  Because the project comprises financial intermediary loans, the technology used in \nsubsequent subprojects for output 1 is unknown at this stage. For PPIDF II, it is proposed to \nfollow the same implementation arrangements that were used in PPIDF I, which require IDCOL \nto obtain ADB approval of each subproject in terms of technical efficiency and ADB and national \nsafeguards policies. With regard to the renewable energy technology provided, the technology \nis well tested and the end beneficiaries expressed satisfaction. ADB encourages IDCOL to \ncontinually review and update technology as soon as it becomes available in Bangladesh. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n27.  Infrastructure is a major hurdle in Bangladesh\u2019s effort to promote sustainable economic \ngrowth and achieve its poverty reduction objectives. Energy shortages alone cause substantial \nlosses in economic output and cost approximately 2% of GDP annually. More generally, the \noverall deficient infrastructure prevents Bangladesh benefitting from its strategic location as a \npotential transport and transshipment hub, including the opportunity of substantially increasing \nforeign direct investment inflows. Financing infrastructure through this project will result in higher \n ", "8 \nindustrial output, attract foreign investment, and create employment. \n \n28.  IDCOL is fully owned by the government and is one of the highest-rated domestic \nfinancial institutions. IDCOL was first rated AA by the Credit Rating Information and Services \nLimited and AA1 by the Credit Rating Agency of Bangladesh in 2007. IDCOL has an eight-\nmember board of directors\u2014four directors are drawn from the public sector, three from the \nprivate sector, and one ex-officio member\u2014and the board is largely independent from IDCOL \nmanagement. Since 2008, when it received support through PPIDF I, IDCOL has increased its \ncapital base, demonstrated positive cash flows, multiplied profits, and gained experience in \nproject finance, including safeguard policies. IDCOL\u2019s credit rating of AA1 was reconfirmed by \nthe Credit Rating Agency of Bangladesh in June 2012. \n \n29.  The financial management of the project will be handled by IDCOL, which has the \ncapacity and knowledge to appraise infrastructure and renewable energy subprojects, and has \nsatisfactory  financial  management  abilities.  However,  based  on  the  financial  management \nassessment, IDCOL needs to further strengthen its risk management and public disclosure \nrequirements, including pricing and monitoring on interest rate risks. As a condition for the first \ndrawdown of any funds under output 1 of PPIDF II, ADB will therefore require that IDCOL hire at \nleast  one  experienced  risk  manager  who  will  provide  independent  assessments  of  the \nsubprojects that the company intends to finance (e.g., regarding pricing, counterparty risk, \nexposure limits, and credit analysis). \n \nC.  Governance \n \n30.  There will be no procurement directly financed under the project. As it was the case in \nPPIDF  I,  ADB  will  encourage  IDCOL  to  require  its  subborrowers  to  adopt  international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and  in \naccordance with established private sector or commercial practices acceptable to ADB. The \ncountry\u2019s procurement laws and procedures have improved in the recent years due to major \nprocurement reforms implemented by the government and capacity development support from \nthe  development  partners.  The  government  recently  launched  electronic  government \nprocurement system in four large public sector agencies. \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  IDCOL.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 16). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n32.  The project will benefit all citizens, including the poor, through the financing of high-\nquality infrastructure that will create jobs, spur economic growth, and attract foreign investment. \nIn addition, the financing of renewable sources of energy in off-grid areas will improve the well-\nbeing of citizens in these areas, including the poor. \n \n33.  The  SHSs  have  greatly  improved  the  quality  of  life  of  rural  households,  and  the \nproductivity and profitability of local businesses. The current rate of 750,000 SHS installations \nper year far exceeds the rate of grid connections.18 The rapid growth of this demand-driven \n                                                \n18 The number of participating organizations involved in the SHS program has grown from 5 to 42, and they compete \nvigorously to provide attractive credit packages to consumers. These organizations conduct their own due diligence \nto extend loans to households. The implementation mechanism of the IDCOL approach has proved sustainable. \nThese organizations have an average loan collection efficiency of about 96%, while fully servicing their debts to \nIDCOL on time. \n ", "9 \nprogram demonstrates the high value that the households place on getting off-grid electricity \nservices. Meanwhile, this off-grid option reduces pressure on the government budget for grid \nexpansion. \n \n34.  Poverty impact. Under PPIDF I, a total of 330,362 SHS have been funded by IDCOL \nusing the proceeds from ADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund loan. Assuming that each SHS saves \nat least $61.8 worth of kerosene each year and reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 375 \nkilograms annually, it is expected that the ADB program will save $408 million and reduce \ncarbon dioxide emissions by 2,476 tons over the 20-year lifecycle of the SHSs. PPIDF II is \nexpected to fund 42,355 SHS leading to $52.3 million in savings and a reduction of 317 tons of \ncarbon dioxide emissions over the 20-year lifecycle of the SHSs. \n \n35.  Gender and social dimensions. The project will support\u2014through the environmental \nand social safeguards management unit of IDCOL\u2014gender and social dimensions. IDCOL will \ndisseminate  information  to  its  subborrowers  on  (i)  the  Government\u2019s  National  Policy  for \nWomen\u2019s  Advancement,  which  has  been  reflected  in  the  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan;  and  (ii) \nBangladesh  Bank\u2019s  Department  of  Financial  Institutions  and  Markets  Circular  no.  2  on \nMainstreaming Corporate Social Responsibility in Financial Institutions, which requires financial \ninstitutions to report on gender equality-related performance indicators biannually. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n36.  According to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \nfinancial intermediary for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. As \nthe proceeds from the proposed ordinary capital resources loan will be used by one or more \nprivate sector sponsors to finance subprojects, there is a potential risk that some of those \ndevelopers may not fully adhere to ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements during implementation. The \nproject team will assess project-specific environmental impact assessment and/or resettlement \nplans as well as each sponsors' environmental management, involuntary resettlement, impacts \non indigenous peoples arising from land acquisition, changes in land use, adherence to core \nlabor standards, or restrictions of access to resources and social protection framework and \npolicies, and assess where enhancements may need to be made by the company. IDCOL has \nadopted the environmental and social safeguard framework and improved its in-house capacity \nwith ADB support.19 IDCOL will continue to ensure all subproject proposals to be financed under \nthe PPIDF II comply with the requirements of the safeguard framework. IDCOL has hired a \nqualified environmental and social safeguards specialist to build in-house capacity. \n \n37.  Under output 2, IDCOL will only finance subprojects that are classified as category C \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy.  To  monitor  compliance,  it  has  developed  an \nenvironmental and social management framework.20 \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n38.  Implementing infrastructure subprojects in Bangladesh is challenging, but sufficient risk \nmitigations measures have been introduced to the project design to justify ADB financing. Major \nrisks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n                                                \n19 Infrastructure Development Company Limited. 2011.

ASSURANCES  \n \n39.  The government and IDCOL have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n40.  The government and IDCOL have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreements and project agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n41.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the loan of $100 million to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Second \nPublic\u2013Private Infrastructure Development Facility, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility;
