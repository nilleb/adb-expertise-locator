A  potential  risk  is  the  state  government\u2019s  limited\nexperience  and \nimplement\ncomprehensive  reforms.    Appropriate  advisory  technical\nsupport  is  being  provided  by  the  Bank,  including  for\nstrengthening  of  institutional  and  procedural  frameworks\nsuch  as  expenditure  management  and  control, \ntax\nadministration, and statistical information system for rational\ndecision  making  at  state  and  local  government  levels.    A\nTechnical  Secretariat \nthe\napproaches  and  modalities  of  restructuring  and  divestment\nof  public  sector  undertakings  is  set  up  under  the  Program.\nThe  government  has  constituted  Steering  Committees  to\nfacilitate coordination of  ongoing  technical  assistance.    The\nSteering Committees vet the consultants' recommendations,\nand act as effective interface between the consultant teams\nand  government  working  groups.  This  will  strengthen  the\nownership of the reform agenda.\n\nfor  capacity  building  on \n\nAnother  risk  is  the  involvement  of  a  large  number  of  state\ngovernment  agencies,  departments,  and  public  enterprises.\nTo  expedite  implementation  of  the  Program,  an  effective\n\n\fiv\n\ncoordination mechanism will  be  essential.    The  government\nhas  set  up  the  Public  Resource  Management  Committee\nchaired  by  the  Chief  Minister,  to  advise  and  coordinate  the\nreform  program.    The  Committee  will  be  supported  by  an\nEmpowered  Committee  on  Public  Finance  Reform  and  an\nEmpowered Committee on Public Enterprises Restructuring,\nthe  Chief  Secretary  with  high-level\nboth  headed  by \nrepresentation from key sector departments.\n\nThe reform of the public enterprise sector and improvement\nin  corporate  governance,  which  the  state  government  is\nimplementing,  will  improve  the  financial  performance  of  the\nenterprises.    Yet,  as  experience  has  shown,  the  pace  of\ndivestment  of  government  shareholding  is  also  dependent\non  prevailing market conditions. This could potentially delay\ndivestments.  However, the government has adopted a  firm\npolicy  of  reforming  public  enterprises  and  is  taking  specific\nsteps \nto  undertake\nrestructuring  and  divestment  of  public  enterprises  and  to\nassess all  approaches  and  modalities  for  increasing  private\nsector shareholding in these entities.\n\ntechnical  capacity \n\nto  strengthen \n\nFinally,  in  view  of  the  tremendous  resource  requirement  of\nthe state to alleviate poverty conditions, financial assistance\nfrom the international aid  community  is  needed.    Enhanced\nresource flow would facilitate the state government\u2019s efforts\nto improve availability of social infrastructure and delivery of\nsocial  services.  The  state  government  and  the  Bank  jointly\norganized  a  workshop  on  Madhya  Pradesh  Development\nand  Aid  Coordination  in  April  1998  to  present  the  Bank\u2019s\nProgram  to  the  international  community,  and  to  identify\nareas  for  possible  financial  and  technical  assistance.    As  a\ntangible outcome of the aid coordination meeting, one of the\nbilateral  donors  has  included  Madhya  Pradesh  as  a  focal\nstate for future development assistance.\n\n\fI.\n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\n1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\nloan to India for the Madhya Pradesh Public Resource Management Program.  The report also\ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  for  Public  Enterprise\nReform and Social Safety Net in Madhya Pradesh, and if the proposed loan is approved by the\nBoard, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, shall approve such technical\nassistance.\n\nII.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe  Constitution  of  India  assigns  significant  responsibilities  for  delivery  of  social\n2.\nservices  and  economic  policymaking  and  regulation  to  the  federating  states.    It  is  therefore\ncritical  that  the  pace  and  direction  of  economic  reforms  at  the  state  level  reinforce  policy\ninitiatives taken by the central Government.  Together, efforts at the national and subnational\nlevels  increase  the  systemic  flexibility  and  adaptability  of  the  Indian  economy  to  a  changing\nexternal environment.\n\n3.\nWhile the Government has the capability of designing and sequencing reforms and can\nmobilize financial resources to absorb the associated costs, the states are not able to respond\nas  actively.    State  governments  generally  lack  the  capacity  and  resources  to  formulate  and\nimplement  comprehensive  reforms.    These  technical  and  financial  constraints  are  more\npronounced  in  low-income  and  less-developed  states  like  Madhya  Pradesh,  the  largest  and\none  of  the  most  populous  states  in  India,  with  more  than  40  percent  of  the  population  living\nbelow  poverty  line.    Without  assistance,  these  states  are  not  able  to  initiate  structural\nadjustment;  this  weakness  not  only  adversely  affects  their  own  social  and  economic\ndevelopment  process,  but  also  impacts  on  the  sustainability  of  reforms  at  the  national  level.\nAs a result, the main policy challenge facing India is to accelerate states\u2019 reforms to enhance\neconomic efficiency and provide a sound basis for economic growth and social development.\n\n4.\nTaking  into  account  the  wider  focus  of  assistance  required,  and  the  need  for\nappropriate  targeting  of  support  within  the  country's  federal  structure,  the  Bank\u2019s  operational\nstrategy for India in 1996 advocated increased lending and TA support at the subnational level.\nIn implementing this strategy, in December 1996 the Bank approved a loan to assist the public\nsector reform agenda of the government of Gujarat.1  In early 1997, a state selection mission\nvisited  six  states2  and  proposed  Madhya  Pradesh  for  Bank  support  on  the  basis  of  criteria\nspecified in the Country Operational Strategy,3 including the willingness and commitment of the\ngovernment of Madhya Pradesh (GMP) to undertake structural reforms, and the state\u2019s sizable\nneeds for infrastructure and social development. Reflecting the large variations in development\nstages  between  Indian  states,  the  Bank\u2019s  subnational  operations  focus  on  entities  with  very\ndifferent  socioeconomic  characters:  unlike  Gujarat,  Madhya  Pradesh  is  among  the  least-\ndeveloped states, has wide gender gaps in access to economic resources and social services,\nand  has  still  a  primarily  agriculture-based  economy;  and  compared  with  Gujarat,  Madhya\nPradesh  has  high  income  poverty  and  a  large  minority  population,  implying  the  need  for  a\nstronger  social  dimension  to  Bank  assistance.    With  the  Government  of  India\u2019s  concurrence,\nGMP  and  the  Bank  developed  a  comprehensive  reform  agenda  to  be  supported  by  the\n                                                       \n1  Loan  No.  1506-IND: Gujarat Public Sector Resource Management Program,  for  $250  million,  approved  on  18\n\nDecember 1996.\n\n2  Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu.\n3  STS: IND 96002: Country Operational Strategy Study, India, July 1996.\n\n\f2\n\nproposed  loan.4  The  Program  addresses  critical  elements  for  sustainable  reform  at  the  state\nlevel:  support  for  human  development  initiatives  particularly  in  health  and  education  sectors;\nimprovement in resource mobilization and efficiency of resource use through structural reform\nof the public finances and public enterprise restructuring; and  implementation  of  a  conducive\ninstitutional, policy, and regulatory framework for private sector participation.\n\nfact-finding  missions  were \n\nReconnaissance,  consultation,  and \n\n5.\nfielded  between\nDecember  1997  and  April  1998.    Appraisal  of  the  program  loan  was  undertaken  17-30  July\n1998, 5 followed by a contact mission fielded during 16-25 February 1999.  This report is based\non the missions' findings.  The program framework is shown in Appendix 1.  The outcome of\nthe  various  missions  is  reflected  in  the  government\u2019s  development  policy  letter  and  attached\npolicy  matrix  (Appendixes  2  and  3),  which  also  express  GMP\u2019s  commitment  and  detail  the\nnature and scope of the proposed reforms.\n\nIII.\n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\n\nA.\n\nRecent Economic Performance and Prospects\n\n6.\nAfter  growing  strongly  during  1991-1996,  stimulated  by  domestic  delicensing  and  the\nliberalization of the trade and external payments regimes, lower industrial activity and volatile\nagricultural  production  slowed  the  growth  of  India's  economy  to  between  5  and  6  percent  in\nFY1998 and FY1999.  This has been accompanied by higher inflation (particularly in consumer\nprices)  due  to  agricultural  supply  constraints,  more  rapid  monetary  expansion,  and  the\ndepreciation of the rupee in the wake of the financial crisis in the region.  Notwithstanding early\nsigns  of  a  pickup  in  economic  activity  in  the  first  half  of  1999,  the  durability  of  the  upturn  is\nuncertain  due  to  remaining  structural  impediments  of  the  economy.  Meanwhile,  the  external\ncurrent account deficit remained about  constant  at  1.2  percent  of  GDP  during  FY1997  to  FY\n1999 as the decline in export growth was offset by lower imports reflecting sluggish industrial\nactivity and a sharp decline in petroleum imports in US dollar terms.  The international reserves\nposition  remained  comfortable,  boosted  by  capital  inflows  from  nonresident  Indians  and\ncontinued inflow of direct foreign investment, although portfolio investment declined in FY1998\nrelative to the previous year, and turned negative during most of FY1999.\n\n7.\nFollowing  early  improvement  in  the  central  Government's  public  finances  between\nFY1991  and  FY1997,  the  fiscal  deficit  has  since  fluctuated  at  around  5-6  percent  of  gross\ndomestic  product.    Lower  than  anticipated  tax  buoyancy,  shortfalls  in  divestment  proceeds,\nand  expenditure  pressure,  particularly  related  to  subsidies,  as  well  as  wage  adjustments\nresulting  from  the  implementation  of  the  Fifth  Pay  Commission,  have  prevented  further\nprogress  on  fiscal  consolidation.    For  FY2000,  the  central  Government  is  envisaging  a\nrenewed decline in the fiscal deficit from last year's 5.9 percent of GDP to 5.2 percent of GDP\n(using  Reserve  Bank  of  India  definition),  and  at  end-February  1999  has  announced  several\nrevenue  enhancing  measures  including  surcharge  on  individual  and  corporate  income  tax\nrates.  Lower than budgeted tax revenues and expenditure overruns so far this year, however,\n                                                       \n4  The  Bank  is  presently  providing  TA  in  support  of  Madhya  Pradesh's  comprehensive  reform  for  sustainability  of\nthe  economic  and  social  development  (see  Appendix  11).    Ongoing  TA  support  includes  (i)  TA  No.  2943-IND:\nSupport for the Government of Madhya Pradesh Public Finance Reform and Institutional Strengthening,  for\n$780,000,  approved  on  15  December  1997;  and  (ii)  TA  No.  2944-IND:  Strengthening Local Government in\nMadhya Pradesh, for $700,000, approved on 15 December 1997.\n\n5  K.

Mitra, Social Development Specialist\nparticipated in the fact-finding/appraisal missions.\n\n\f3\n\nwill make achievement of the budget target difficult.  Meanwhile, the states\u2019 fiscal situation has\nremained very precarious, and continued budgetary pressures have adversely impacted on the\nstates\u2019  provision  of  economic  and  social  services.    Predictably,  the  poorest  states  have\nsuffered most.  Key economic and social indicators are shown in Appendix 4.\n\nB. \n\nIssues in Economic Management and Sustainability of the Development Process\n\n8.\nFiscal imbalances are posing a major challenge for macroeconomic  management  and\nthe sustainability of social and economic development.  Unless addressed, inadequate public\nsaving  will  affect  the  public  sector\u2019s  capacity  to  invest  and  to  complement  private  sector\ninvestment,  both  of  which  are  crucial  for  achieving  and  sustaining  high  rates  of  growth,\nfostering  social  development,  and  reducing  poverty.    Moreover,  in  the  absence  of  fiscal\nconsolidation, tighter monetary policy may be required to lower inflation, which could raise real\ninterest  rates,  dampen  investment,  and  increase  the  Government\u2019s  debt  service  burden.\nReversing  the  decline  in  public  saving  will  require  substantial  improvement  in  the  financial\nthe  central  and  state  governments,  as  well  as  public  enterprises.\nperformance  of \nConsideration must further be given to expenditure composition and the quality of adjustment\nto meet the longer term development requirements for social and physical infrastructure.\n\nAlthough part of the states\u2019 financing requirements are being met by central transfers,\n9.\nincluding loans and grants,6 and reliance on intergovernmental transfers may have somewhat\ndiscouraged  states\u2019  fiscal  discipline  and  delayed  the  recognition  of  the  need  for  reform,\nresource  constraints  are  increasingly  preventing  subnational  governments  from  providing  the\nsocial and economic services which the Constitution assigned to them.  These constraints and\nadverse effects are more pronounced in the low-income and less-developed states.  This is not\nonly  affecting  their  economic  growth,  but  also  hamper  human  development  and  prolong  the\nexisting income and capability poverty of their population.\n\nC.\n\nReform Agenda at the State Level\n\n10.\nThe Indian Constitution gives the states considerable financial and economic autonomy\nto define their development priorities, and has entrusted them with the provision of economic\nand  social  services  and  the  regulation  of  key  infrastructure  sectors.    Yet,  in  line  with  the\nnational focus on central development planning, which had prevailed for a considerable time,\nthe states\u2019 development strategy was mainly directed toward strong public sector involvement\nin social and economic activity, investment, and pricing.  A rather  residual  role  was  therefore\nassigned to private sector activities, and not much emphasis was given to the importance of a\nconducive institutional, policy, and regulatory environment for private sector participation.\n\n11.\nThe availability of resources, particularly through  intergovernmental  transfers,  enabled\nstates  to  invest  in  and  initiate  multifarious  schemes  without  regard  to  expenditure  priority,\nsustainability, or absorptive capacity. Projects were initiated but completion delayed, payment\nobligations incurred without full consideration of future debt service burden, and economic and\n\n                                                       \n6  States are receiving three different types of transfers from the Government: (i) statutory transfers, comprising the\ndevolution of tax revenues  collected  nationwide  as  well  as  certain  grants,  on  the  basis  of  Finance  Commission\nrecommendations;  (ii)  loans  and  grants  authorized  by  the  Planning  Commission  for  economic  and  social\ndevelopment  expenditure;  and  (iii)  discretionary  transfers  made  by  individual  ministries  out  of  their  own  plan\noutlays, as well as additional plan assistance for implementing externally aided projects. Bank assistance for the\nProgram  will  be  treated  as  \u201cadditionality\u201d  and  provided  to  Madhya  Pradesh  through  the  central  Government\nbudget in addition to all other transfers.\n\n\f4\n\nsocial services were  provided  without  proper  pricing  and  cost  recovery.    The  ensuing  implicit\nand, in some cases, explicit subsidies, coupled with a certain lack of incentive to mobilize their\nown resources, worsened the states\u2019 public finances.  The growing fiscal imbalances reflected\na  deteriorating  quality  of  the  deficit,  as  growth-inducing  and  socially  productive  investments\nwere  gradually  replaced  by  nonproductive  expenditures.    This  was  compounded  by  a  rising\nwage  bill  as  a  result  of  increased  government  employment  and  periodic  wage  adjustments,\nand  higher  interest  obligations  due  to  increased  indebtedness  at  more  market-determined\ninterest rates.  At the same time, stagnating revenues owing to low tax buoyancy and a decline\nin  nontax  revenues  as  a  share  of  GDP  did  not  provide  sufficient  additional  resources  to\nalleviate  fiscal  pressures.    Consequently,  the  consolidated  current  account  balance  of  the\nstates  shifted  from  a  surplus  of  1  percent  of  net  state  domestic  product  (SDP)  during  1980-\n1987 to a deficit of about 0.8 percent of SDP a decade later; in continuation of this trend, the\ndeficit  is  likely  to  exceed  1.5  percent  of  SDP  in  FY1999.    In  addition,  the  financial  and\ninstitutional  weaknesses  at  the  subnational  level  are  hindering  the  provision  of  states\u2019\ninfrastructure and social services at a time when the reform process in India depends critically\non sustained efforts in key areas under the states\u2019 purview.\n\n12.\nFor  the  states  to  adjust  to  the  new  development  focus  and  ensure  sustainable\neconomic  and  social  development,  reforms  need  to  address  (i)  the  changing  composition  of\npublic  expenditures  by  reducing  the  escalation  of  the  wage  bill,  lowering  subsidies,  and\ncurtailing  the  budgetary  burden  of  public  enterprises,  while  raising  resource  allocation  for\nsocial  services  to  enable  maintaining  and  expanding  human  development  initiatives  on  a\nsustainable  basis,  taking  into  account  the  social  cost  of  structural  adjustment;  (ii)  enhancing\nresource  mobilization  through  widening  the  tax  base,  improving  efficiency  of  taxation  and\nstrengthening tax administration, and enhancing cost recovery; and (iii) the policy, regulatory,\nand institutional regime of key sectors to establish a conducive environment for private sector\nparticipation.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\nA.\n\nBackground, Recent Performance, and Medium-Term Prospects\n\n13.\nFormed  in  1956  and  located  in  the  center  of  India,  Madhya  Pradesh  is  the  country\u2019s\nlargest  state,  covering  443,446  square  kilometers:  13.5  percent  of  India\u2019s  total  geographic\narea.      More  than  one  third  of  the  state\u2019s  77  million  people  (1998)  belong  to  socially  and\neconomically disadvantaged groups consisting of scheduled tribes and scheduled castes, the\nhighest proportion in India (para. 33). Madhya Pradesh is still a predominantly agricultural state\nand, with a per capita annual income of Rs7,500 ($176), one of the poorest states in India.\n\n14.\nThe  state  economy  has  shown  robust  economic  growth  averaging  4.4  percent  since\nFY1981,  accelerating  to  about  5  percent  during  1990-1996.  The  contribution  of  the  primary\nsector  to  SDP  has  gradually  declined  from  56  percent  in  FY1981  to  about  40  percent  at\npresent,  while  both  industry  and  services  sectors  increased  by  6  percentage  points  to  25\npercent and  33  percent,  respectively.  In  particular,  reflecting  the  state\u2019s  rich  natural  resource\nendowment,  industrial  and  mining  activities  are  increasingly  focusing  on  the  processing  of\nmanganese, iron ore, and coal.7  Notwithstanding the shift in sector composition, the sectoral\nstructure of the workforce continues to be heavily biased toward agriculture, which maintained\n\n                                                       \n7  This has resulted in serious environmental problems such as soil erosion, water pollution, degradation of forest,\n\nand air pollution.\n\n\f5\n\nits  relative  share  of  about  78  percent  of  total  employment,  while  employment  in  the  tertiary\nsector increased.  In view of the state\u2019s high population growth, per capita income (in constant\nprices)  increased  by  only  1.8  percent  per  annum,  about  30  percent  below  national  average,\nand more than 40 percent of the population lives below poverty line.  Coupled with significant\nincome  poverty,  the  state  has  very  low  social  indicators,  which  despite  some  improvements,\nparticularly in education, are still far below the national average.\n\n15.\nThe government\u2019s reforms focus on achieving medium-term sustainability of the public\nfinances while reallocating expenditure to meet basic human needs and facilitate development\nof social and physical infrastructure.  The economic prospects in the medium and longer term\ndepend  critically  on  the  effective  and  efficient  implementation  of  the  comprehensive  reforms\nsupported  by  the  Program.    Improving  the  allocative  efficiency  and  establishing  a  conducive\nenvironment for  private  sector  activity  while  removing  policy  and  regulatory  impediments  and\nstrengthening  the  institutional  setup,  is  expected  to  stimulate  economic  growth,  enable\nprovision of basic services, and foster social development.\n\nB.\n\nConstraints and Issues\n\n16.\nThe main constraints on the social and economic development in Madhya Pradesh are\n(i) the structural weaknesses of public finances including  inefficiency  in  resource  mobilization\nand ineffectiveness of resource use, and the resulting unsustainable pattern of expenditure; (ii)\ninefficiency  of  public  enterprises  performance;  (iii)  inadequacy  of  physical  infrastructure,\nparticularly in the power, roads, and housing sectors; and (iv) insufficient social development.\n\n1.\n\nStructural Weaknesses of Public Finances and Sustainable Fiscal Strategy\n\n17.\nSound  finances  are  critical  for  infrastructure  development  and  the  provision  of  social\nservices  that  are  among  the  state\u2019s  primary  responsibilities.      During  the  1980s,  GMP  had\nmaintained  relatively  high  fiscal  deficits  (4-5  percent  of  SDP)  and  yet  was  able  to  contain  its\ndebt burden, in part because of its ability to borrow at negative real interest rates.  In the wake\nof  financial  sector  reforms  in  India  and  the  tightening  of  central  bank  control  over  overdraft\nfacilities, the state\u2019s borrowing requirements were increasingly financed at market-determined\nrates, which substantially raised the interest burden.  Additional fiscal pressures resulted from\nwage  adjustments,  budget  support  for  loss-incurring  public  sector  undertakings  (PSUs),  and\nincreasing  subsidies.    As  tax  revenues  stagnated  and  central  Government  transfers  to  the\nstate  declined,  resource  mobilization  efforts  were  not  sufficient  to  cover  rising  expenditures.\nThis  resulted  in  a  widening  current  account  deficit,  requiring  the  government  to  borrow  for\ncurrent (\u201cconsumptive\u201d) expenditure rather than capital outlays.  To mitigate the impact on the\noverall  deficit  and  government  borrowing  requirements,  public  investment  was  compressed.\nRecognizing these precarious fiscal trends, GMP started to implement a number of measures\n(including the abolition of vacant posts and a ban on recruitment of staff, consolidation of the\nmotor  vehicles  tax  system,  and  simplification  of  the  sales  tax  rate  schedule  and  tax\nassessment)  and  thereby  managed  to  keep  the  fiscal  deficit  at  about  3.5  percent  of  SDP\nthrough FY1996.  After that, however, fiscal pressures mounted, reflecting one-time factors as\nwell  as  inherent  structural  weaknesses  in  the  public  finances,  and  the  deficit  rose  above  5\npercent of SDP (Appendix 5, Table A5.1).\n\n18.\nStagnating  resource  mobilization.    The  state  receives  about  60  percent  of  its\nrevenues from its own tax and nontax receipts, while the remaining share comes from its share\nof  national  taxes  plus  central  Government  grants.    Almost  one  half  of  GMP\u2019s  tax  revenues\n\n\f6\n\naccrues  from  sales  tax,  which  has  generally  high  revenue  buoyancy.    In  Madhya  Pradesh,\nhowever,  sales  tax  revenues  as  a  share  of  SDP  remained  stagnant  owing  to  the  narrow  tax\nbase,  complex  rate  schedule,  and  wide-ranging  exemptions  (particularly  for  industry)  in  the\nstate\u2019s industrial incentives scheme.  Meanwhile, GMP has made good progress in tapping the\npotential of the state excise duty, electricity duty, and motor vehicles tax, which together have\nyielded additional revenues equivalent to 1 percent of SDP since 1985.  In view of the already\nhigh  tax  burden  compared  with  the  national  average,  however,  it  is  unlikely  that  additional\nrevenues can be mobilized from these sources.  Madhya Pradesh also relies more heavily than\nother  states  on  nontax  revenues  (excluding  Government  grants),  accounting  for  almost  20\npercent  of  total  receipts.    Nontax  revenues  consist  mainly  of  royalties  on  minerals  and\nrevenues from forest products, and reflect the state\u2019s natural resource endowment.  As royalty\nrates on major minerals are not under GMP\u2019s purview and are mostly specific rates rather than\nad  valorem,  and  revenues  from  forest  products  are  constrained  by  provisions  in  the  Forest\nConservation  Act,  the  state  cannot  rely  on  further  resource  mobilization  from  these  sources.\nHowever,  nontax  revenue  collection  has  also  been  adversely  affected  by  low  and  declining\ncost  recovery  on  economic  and  social  services  and  inadequate  return  on  government\ninvestment particularly in PSUs; this trend needs to be reversed.\n\n19.\nRise  in  revenue  expenditure  and  shift  in  expenditure  composition.    Current\nexpenditures have  steadily  increased  due  to  (i)  a  rise  in  the  wage  bill  reflecting  cost-of-living\nadjustment  and  increase  in  public  sector  employment;  (ii)  the  more  than  doubling  in  interest\npayment as a share of SDP; and (iii)  rise  in  losses  of  PSUs  including  conversion  of  loans  to\nequity through capital grants, and write-off of debt to cancel arrears on subsidy payment.  Due\nto  resource  constraints,  the  increase  in  expenditures  resulted  in  a  change  in  expenditure\ncomposition:  public  investment  was  compressed  and  outlays  for  operation  and  maintenance\nsqueezed,  affecting  both  the  expansion  and  maintenance  of  infrastructure  and  other  capital\nassets; and resource availability for allocation  to  social  services  was  limited,  which  otherwise\ncould  have  facilitated  progress  in  the  state\u2019s  social  development.  The  expenditure  pressures\nwere exacerbated by weak budgeting procedures and insufficient budgetary control, resulting\nin  expenditure  overruns  and  lower  expenditure  efficiency.  Two  additional  factors  have\ncontributed to the recent surge in public expenditures and the rise in the level of outstanding\ndebt: (i) payment of accrued wage and pension obligations resulting from GMP\u2019s acceptance in\nearly  1998  of  recommendations  of  the  Fifth  Pay  Commission;  and  (ii)  outlays  for  the\nrehabilitation of Jabalpur, which was hit by an earthquake in 1997.\n\nIssues for a sustainable fiscal strategy. To formulate a sustainable fiscal strategy, the\n20.\nfollowing  main  issues  will  need  to  be  addressed:  (i)  reallocating  resources  toward  social  and\nphysical  infrastructure  to  foster  human  development  and  economic  growth  on  a  sustainable\nbasis;  (ii)  rationalizing  the  tax  system  and  strengthening  the  institutional  and  procedural\nframework  to  improve  resource  mobilization  and  allocative  efficiency;  (iii)  adjusting  prices  of\nservices  to  enhance  cost  recovery  and  reduce  budgetary  subsidies,  and  implementing\nmechanisms  to  de-politicize  price  setting  and  improve  governance;  and  (iv)  reducing  the\nbudgetary burden of public enterprises and improving their operational efficiency.\n\n2.\n\nInefficiency of Public Enterprises Performance\n\nMadhya  Pradesh  has  31  PSUs,  set  up  under  various  legal  frameworks,  to  achieve  a\n21.\nmultiplicity  of  developmental,  promotional,  and  commercial  objectives.    The  PSUs  employ\nabout 134,000 people, or 10 percent of the state\u2019s total public sector work force (Appendix 6).\nThe  government\u2019s  total  investment  in  PSUs  amounted  to  Rs33  billion  ($775  million)  or  5.4\n\n\f7\n\npercent  of  SDP,  with  GMP  holding  100  percent  of  equity  in  most  of  the  enterprises.  The\noperational and financial performance of the PSUs has been extremely weak: in FY1998, the\npublic  enterprises  sector  (excluding  the  State  Electricity  Board  [MPEB])  as  a  whole  incurred\nafter-tax losses of Rs570 million or 0.1 percent of SDP, and has accumulated losses of more\nthan Rs5 billion (about 0.9 percent of SDP).  Dividend payments amounted to Rs47 million in\nFY1998, equivalent to only about 0.5 percent of the  GMP\u2019s  share  in  total  paid-up  capital.    In\ncontrast,  the  state  budget  bears  a  heavy  burden  as  it  underwrites  losses  of  PSUs  through\nbudgetary  support  for  loans,  grants  or  write-off  of  debt  service  payment,  as  well  as  equity\ninjection in PSUs and funding of their investment plans.8  Further budgetary implications may\nresult from providing  loans  without  adequate  evaluation  of  associated  credit  risks,  as  well  as\ncontingent  liabilities  on  account  of  GMP  guarantees  for  PSUs\u2019  borrowing  from  financial\ninstitutions.    The  reliance  on  budgetary  support  has  shielded  PSUs  from  changing  market\nconditions,  and  perpetuated  their  lack  of  commercialization  and  susceptibility  to  political\ninterference and inadequate management decision, information, and control systems.\n\n22.\nIn  the  absence  of  a  policy  on  restructuring  and  divestment,  the  state  government\napproached  public  enterprises  reform  on  a  case-by-case  basis:  GMP  closed  one  enterprise\n(Madhya  Pradesh  Film  Development  Corporation);  transferred  a  unit  of  the  Madhya  Pradesh\nState Industries Corporation to the private sector under management contract; and privatized\none of Madhya Pradesh State Textile Corporation\u2019s small processing mills.  Public enterprises\nreform was further constrained by (i) lack of an effective institutional mechanism for developing\nand  implementing  a  PSU  restructuring  program;  (ii)  lack  of  focus  on  corporate  governance\nissues; (iii) restrictive labor legislation that, as in other states, acted as barrier to restructuring\nby preventing downsizing of PSUs; and (iv) pressure on the public finances, which limited the\navailability of funds for financial and organizational restructuring of public enterprises and the\nprovision of an adequate social safety net.\n\n3.\n\nInadequate Development of Physical Infrastructure\n\n23.\nIn  Madhya  Pradesh,  as  in  other  states,  infrastructure  development  and  services  have\ngenerally  been  provided  by  the  public  sector  because  of  their  positive  externalities,  the\nelement  of  monopoly  built  into  them,  and  their  usually  high  up-front  costs  and  long\namortization  periods.9    The  lack  of  long-term  financing,  as  well  as  investment  risks  from\nuncertainty about the regulatory framework including pricing policies for infrastructure services,\nhas also made it more difficult for private firms to enter the sector.  However, in the context of\ngrowing  fiscal  imbalances,  the  lack  of  adequate  maintenance  of  public  investment  and  the\ninability  to  expand  the  infrastructure  network  are  hindering  further  economic  development.\nMoreover,  Madhya  Pradesh\u2019s  strategic  location  in  the  center  of  the  country  implies  that\nstrengthening the state\u2019s basic infrastructure would have beneficial effects on the infrastructure\nof the national economy.\n\n24.\nThe state\u2019s infrastructure base is underdeveloped and well below the national average\nas  reflected  in  key  infrastructure  indicators  as  well  as  the  composite  Relative  Infrastructure\nDevelopment Index (Appendix 4, Table A4.1).  Compared with all-India level of 100 in FY1994\nand  the  levels  in  more  advanced  states  like  Punjab  (191),  Tamil  Nadu  (144),  and  Gujarat\n(122), the index for Madhya Pradesh was 75: the lowest among the 17 larger states.  Although\n\n                                                       \n8  For example, budgetary support exceeded Rs4 billion in FY1995, while an additional Rs15 billion were provided\n\nin FY1997 for debt write-off and debt-equity conversion for MPEB.\n\n9  Formulation  and  implementation  of  state\u2019s  infrastructure  development  policy  is  assigned  to  respective  sector\n\nagencies/institutions such as the Department of Transport and Public Works Department.   \n\n\f8\n\nthe index value increased from 62 to 75 between FY1981 and FY1994, with Madhya Pradesh\nbeing  one  of  only  three  states  (the  others  are  Orissa  and  Rajasthan)  showing  relative\nimprovement,  the  index  neither  reflects  the  deteriorating  quality  of  the  state\u2019s  existing\ninfrastructure nor the widening gap between infrastructure requirement and availability. Closing\nthe  identified  gaps  in  the  power,  roads,  and  urban  sectors  alone,  would  require  additional\ninvestments  in  Madhya  Pradesh  of  about  Rs270  billion  ($6.4  billion)  or  44  percent  of  SDP,\nmore  than  20  times  actual  annual  capital  outlays,  which  far  exceeds  the  public  sector\u2019s\nresource  availability.    GMP  is  therefore  actively  seeking  private  sector  participation  in\ninfrastructure development, but needs to redirect its focus from case-by-case interventions to\nevolving a policy, institutional, and regulatory environment characterized by transparency, legal\nassurance,  and  political  noninterference,  and  that  will  ensure  a  level  playing  field  for  private\nenterprises.\n\na.\n\nPower\n\nThe state's power sector is managed and regulated by MPEB, the monopoly supplier of\n25.\nelectricity.  Total installed capacity of thermal and hydroelectric power as of March  1998  was\n3,814  megawatts  (MW),  with  additional  allocation  of  1,773  MW  from  central  sector  power\nstations.  The  gap  between  electricity  demand  and  available  generation  capacity  is  widening,\nand  the  present  peak  demand-supply  gap  is  estimated  to  be  about  1,300  MW.    Madhya\nPradesh  has  an  extensive  transmission  and  distribution  network;  however,  the  state\u2019s  large\nsize and its population density make the cost per consumer of expanding the network among\nthe highest in India.\n\n26.\nThe  financial  performance  of  MPEB  has  rapidly  deteriorated,  and  the  entity  is\nincreasingly relying on budgetary subsidies to achieve the 3 percent minimum rate of return on\nnet  fixed  assets  stipulated  in  the  Indian  Electricity  Supply  Act.    The  financial  problems  are\nmainly due to low tariffs for agriculture and domestic sectors, which together raise 11 percent\nof revenue while consuming almost 50 percent of the energy.  MPEB incurs annual losses of\nmore than Rs15 billion ($350 million) on account of sale of subsidized electricity to agricultural\nconsumers alone,  of  which  it  receives  a  subsidy  of  about  Rs4  billion  ($95  million)  from  GMP\nand  the  rest  through  cross-subsidization,  particularly  high  tariffs  on  industrial  customers.\nHowever,  the  subsidy  from  GMP  has  not  always  been  given  as  cash  and  on  time:  in  1996,\nGMP  adjusted  Rs7.9  billion  by  writing  off  of  its  loans  to  MPEB  and  converted  another  Rs7\nbillion  of  its  loans  to  equity  in  addition  to  a  provision  of  Rs3.7  billion  for  subsidies  in  the\nFY1998 budget to clear the  backlog  of  subsidy  payment  from  the  state  budget  to  MPEB.    In\nthe  context  of  worsening  performance  of  the  states\u2019  electricity  boards,  the  Indian  Parliament\npassed  legislation  in  July  1998  to  enable  states  to  set  up  tariff  and  regulatory  authorities.\nMoreover, to reduce pressure on the budget and lower cross-subsidization in the interim, with\neffect  from  1  March  1999  power  tariffs  were  raised  by  an  average  18  percent,  including  on\nagricultural and domestic consumers, in addition to a substantial rise in fuel surcharge.\n\nMPEB\u2019s poor financial condition has adversely affected maintenance of existing assets\n27.\nand  limited  the  resources  availability  for  investment.  To  supplement  its  own  addition  to\ngeneration  capacity,  the  state  entered  into  memoranda  of  understanding  with  independent\npower  producers  through  noncompetitive  negotiation.    Power  purchase  agreements  were\nsigned with 16 independent power producers, of which 13 projects with total capacity of 5,356\nMW have so far received Central Electricity Authority techno-economic clearance.  However, in\nview  of  MPEB\u2019s  financial  situation,  banks  have  assessed  a  maximum  generation  capacity  of\nonly 2,561 MW as escrowable.  Moreover, due to legal and financial difficulties in finalizing the\n\n\f9\n\nagreements  with  independent  power  producers,  it  is  likely  that  not  even  that  amount  of  new\ngeneration  capacity  will  come  on  stream.    There  is  thus  an  urgent  need  for  a  fundamental\nrestructuring  of  the  power  sector  to  improve  operational  performance,  restore  the  sector's\nfinancial  viability,  and  enable  private  sector  participation  to  ensure  adequate  and  reliable\npower supply.\n\nb.\n\nRoads and Road Transport\n\nMadhya  Pradesh\u2019s  large  size  and  strategic  location  makes  the  development  of  an\n28.\nadequate road network critical for the overall quality of its infrastructure. Despite a road length\nof  about  100,000  kilometers  (km),  the  state\u2019s  road  density  is  very  low  and  less  than  half  the\nnational  average.    Budgetary  provisions  are  insufficient  for  proper  maintenance  of  existing\nroads, leaving very little for expansion.  Guided by its overall development plan and the 1997\nStrategic Options Study, the government plans to expand and upgrade the high-density state\nhighway  system,  improve  major  district  roads,  and  develop  link  roads  to  improve  access  to\nindustrial  and  mining  centers  and  promote  spatial  development.    In  view  of  the  severity  of\nresource limitations and the crucial importance of an adequate road network, the government\nhas embarked on a program to privatize road maintenance and to undertake road and bridge\nconstruction under build-operate-transfer schemes.  The legal framework is already in place to\nallow the private sector to levy tolls.  The Public Works Department has identified 37 roads for\nmaintenance  under  build-operate-transfer  and  so  far  invited  tenders  for  16  road  stretches;  a\ncontract for the improvement and maintenance of a state highway section has been awarded\non  the  basis  of  highest  premium  payment.10    In  addition,  during  the  last  two  years,  10  small\nbridges  (total  cost  of  Rs50  million)  were  built  by  private  sector,  and  several  other  bridge\nprojects  are  under  consideration.    Total  annual  revenue  from  toll  tax/premium  has  reached\nRs250  million,  about  10  percent  of  annual  budget  allocation  for  operation  and  maintenance,\nand  is  being  used  to  maintain  hitherto  neglected  stretches  of  the  state's  highway  system.\nNotwithstanding,  a  general  enabling  framework  for  private  sector  participation  in  the  roads\nsector is still lacking.\n\nthe \n\nIncreasing \n\nindustrial  development, \n\n29.\ninadequacy  of  alternative  modes  of\ntransportation (particularly limited railway connections) and the large geographic spread of the\nstate combined with low population density, place heavy demands on road transport services.\nWhile  freight  transport  is  mostly  undertaken  by  the  private  sector,  the  State  Road  Transport\nCorporation  (MPSRTC)  is  mostly  involved  in  intercity  and  interstate  travel.    MPSRTC  has  an\naging  fleet  of  about  2,450  buses,  of  which  only  1,650  are  operational;  consequently  actual\noperations cover only about two thirds of MPSRTCs 1,318 authorized routes, which constitute\nabout 20 percent of total routes. The private sector, which can obtain permits to operate on all\nroutes within the state\u2019s total road network except on  nationalized  routes,  runs  more  than  90\npercent  of  all  commercial  passenger  transport  vehicles,  75  percent  of  all  buses,  and  100\npercent  of  motor  taxis  and  mini  buses.    Although  MPSRTC's  fare  has  increased  more  than\nfourfold  since  the  1980s,  inefficient  operations  and  declining  competitiveness  has  made  the\nMPSRTC nonviable under present circumstances.\n\nc.\n\nHousing\n\n                                                       \n10 Earlier, in 1992, the Rau-Pithampur road in Madhya Pradesh became the first privately financed and constructed\ntoll  road  in  India.  However,  Infrastructure  Leasing  &  Financial  Services  Ltd.  was  preselected  to  undertake\nconstruction in collaboration with the Madhya Pradesh State Industrial Development Corporation.\n\n\f10\n\nThe state\u2019s population of 77 million is spread in about 71,000 villages and 465 towns.\n30.\nAlthough still one of the least urbanized states in the country, Madhya Pradesh is undergoing a\nstructural transformation from a predominantly rural to a more urbanized society.    While  total\npopulation doubled between 1961 and 1991, the size of the urban population increased almost\nfourfold  from  4.6  million  to  15.3  million,  raising  the  proportion  of  urban  population  to  total\npopulation  in  the  state  from  14  percent  to  more  than  23  percent  (1991  census).    However,\ngiven severe resource constraints and a continuous decline in capital outlays, the state\u2019s urban\ninfrastructure is completely inadequate even to meet the present requirements.  In addition, the\nrapid population growth,  poverty,  and  relatively  low  investment  in  housing  development  have\nworsened  the  shelter  problem,  resulting  in  steady  growth  of  slums  and  informal  settlements.\nThis  has  been  exacerbated  by  provisions  of  the  Rent  Control  Act,  which  have  distorted  the\nhousing rental market, and by problems of land acquisition under India\u2019s Land Acquisition Act\nand its Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act (ULCRA), which impose limits on ownership of\nvacant  land  within  cities,  regulate  transfer  of  land,  assign  the  power  of  acquisition  of  excess\nland to state governments, and prescribe maximum payment for land acquisition.\n\nAs in other states, in Madhya Pradesh the implementation of the ULCRA has failed to\n31.\nfacilitate  the  acquisition  of  vacant  urban  lands  and  their  transfer  for  urban  development\nincluding housing.  Since enactment of the ULCRA in 1976, 7,000 hectares (ha) of  land  was\ndeclared surplus and about 5,100 ha was taken over by the state government, but in part due\nto  protracted  litigation  only  about  240  ha  of  surplus  land  was  allotted  for  the  prescribed\nobjectives.  The  increase  in  demand  for  housing  and  the  relatively  slow  supply  response  has\nwidened the demand-supply gap, estimated at 1.1 million housing units in urban  areas  alone\nby 1995.  If the projected additional demand for 770,000 new units during 1995-2001 becomes\nreality, the total housing backlog could  reach  1.9  million  units  by  2001.    About  75  percent  of\nthe  housing  would  be  required  for  economically  weaker  section  and  low-income  group\nhouseholds.11    Only  about  25,000-30,000  units  are  added  to  the  housing  stock  annually,\nmainly  due  to  the  paucity  of  financial  resources  of  government  and  semigovernmental\ninstitutions,  but  also  reflecting  the  ineffectiveness  of  the  institutional  setup  for  the  delivery  of\nservices.\n\n4.\n\nInsufficient Social Development\n\n32.\nDemographic trends.  Madhya Pradesh, the largest and sixth most populous state in\nIndia, has low population density, with more than three fourths of the population living in rural\nareas.  Along with other poor states such as Bihar, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh (also known\nas the BIMARU [\"perpetually sickly\"] states), Madhya Pradesh ranks very low  in  all  indicators\nreflected in the Human Development Index, such as per capita SDP, life expectancy, literacy,\naverage years of schooling, and infant mortality rates.12\n\n33.\nThe state has a large concentration of socially and economically disadvantaged groups\nconsisting of scheduled  tribes  and  scheduled  castes,  comprising  23  percent  and  15  percent,\nrespectively, of  the  state\u2019s  population  compared  with  8  percent  and  17  percent,  respectively,\nfor  India  as  a  whole.    Although  scheduled  tribes  are  present  in  all  45  districts13  of  the  state,\n                                                       \n11 \n\nAccording  to  Government  classification,  economically  weaker  section  are  households  with  monthly\nincomes below Rs2,500 ($59) and low-income group households those with monthly incomes between Rs2,500\nand Rs5,500 ($129).\n\nMadhya Pradesh was the first subnational entity in the world to prepare a Human Development Report in\n\n1995 as basis for increased focus on social development.  The second report was released in January 1999.\n\nIn mid-1998, GMP approved the formation of 16 more districts to reduce their average size and strengthen\n\n12 \n\n13 \n\ndecentralized government.\n\n\f11\n\nthey  are  mainly  concentrated  in  the  eastern,  southeastern,  and  southwestern  parts;  in  six  of\nthe districts, more than half of the population are tribal.  The literacy rates of scheduled castes\nand scheduled tribes are substantially below the statewide level, averaging 35 percent and 22\npercent  respectively,  and  indicating  large  gender  disparities  of  21-32  percent  (Appendix  4,\nTable A4.7), as well as significant disparity among different tribal groups.14\n\n34.\nGender.      Gender  analysis  shows  that  women  systematically  lack  access  to  basic\nsocial  services,  income  and  employment,  physical  security  and  safety,  and  participation  in\npolitical  and  civil  life.  The  gender  ratio  in  the  state  reached  931  females  per  1000  males  in\n1991  (gender  ratios  among  tribal  communities  are  more  even)  reflecting  systematic  gender\nbias  at  all  levels  of  society,  in  infant  and  child  mortality,  maternal  health  and  mortality,  life\nexpectancy, access to the means of production, employment, livelihoods, and incomes.15  Poor\nphysical  access  to  health  and  education  facilities  compounds  gender  disadvantage  in  these\nareas.  Women  and  girl  children  tend  to  get  marginalized  due  to  their  low  visibility  for  the\nservice providers and due to prevailing gender bias in the family and community.  Scheduled\ntribe/caste  women  suffer  from  an  additional  source  of  disadvantage,  that  of  belonging  to\nclearly  demarcated  disadvantaged  social  groups,  which  further  limits  their  access  to  social\nservices  and  development  opportunities.    However,  there  are  indications  of  a  growing\nconsciousness  amongst  women  particularly  of  their  role  in  the  political  process.  With  the\nimplementation of the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, which provided constitutional\nstatus to village councils and urban local bodies as the basis for decentralized administration,\nrepresentation  of  women  increased  to  about  184,000  members,  more  than  the  one  third\nstipulated in the amendments. 16\n\n35.\nPoverty.    In  Madhya  Pradesh,  more  than  40  percent  of  the  population  is  below  the\npoverty line.  Low education and health standards adversely affect their potential contribution\nto economic activity.  Unless addressed, these material and physical deficiencies will not only\naffect the current population\u2019s ability to generate income, but also severely hamper the state\u2019s\ndevelopment process and thus the population\u2019s  welfare  in  the  future.    Efforts  will  need  to  be\nstrengthened to improve provision of and access to social services and facilities, particularly in\nrural areas.\n\na.\n\nEducation\n\n36.\nAlthough considerable progress (albeit from a very low starting point) has been made such\nas doubling of the literacy rate among males and more than trebling among females during 1961-\n1991,  55  percent  of  the  state\u2019s  population  are  still  illiterate,  with  significant  regional  and  gender\ndifferences.    Among  the  scheduled  castes  and  scheduled  tribes,  65  percent  and  78  percent,\n\n                                                       \n14 \n\nIn view of the high proportion of economically and socially weaker sections of population, GMP puts strong\nemphasis on their specific needs.  In the state\u2019s annual and five-year plans, funds are earmarked (in proportion to\ntheir  respective  share  in  state\u2019s  total  population)  and  placed  at  the  disposal  of  specialized  government\ndepartments to  identify  schemes/programs  most  suited  for  the  welfare  of  these  groups,  and  to  allocate  outlays\naccordingly.\n\n15 \n\nYet,  the  state's  female  work  participation  rate  is  higher  than  the  national  average  (32.7  percent  in  1991\ncompared with 22.3 percent nationwide).  In rural areas, the rate exceeds 40 percent, and is even higher in tribal\nareas.\n\n16 Madhya  Pradesh  was  the  first  state  in  India  to  hold  elections  for  local  self-government  after  implementation  of\nthese constitutional amendments.  While this has led to increased representation of women, it remains important\nto translate this into effective capacity through training and conscientization.\n\n\f12\n\nrespectively, still remain illiterate.  Net enrollment ratios17 of 60-75 percent for primary and middle\nschool and a low transition rate from primary to secondary level, estimated at less than two thirds\nfor children enrolled in Grade I, are reflected in low mean years of schooling and point to very low\neducational  development  in  the  state.    Moreover,  about  40  percent  of  the  teachers  in  primary\neducation and one third in secondary school are untrained.  Inadequate facilities and poor quality of\nteaching are important causes of the state\u2019s low enrollment and high dropout rates.\n\n37. \nGovernment spending on education amounted to about Rs27 billion in FY1999, equivalent\nto 19 percent of GMP\u2019s total expenditures and reflecting an average annual increase of more than\n5 percent in real terms since 1980, raising the expenditure ratio by one half to about 4 percent of\nSDP.   An increasing share in education outlays is directed toward primary  education  (almost  50\npercent), while a further 15 percent is allocated for secondary education, and about 10 percent for\nhigher  education.    The  remaining  allocation  is  provided  to  the  education  sector  as  part  of  tribal\nwelfare, mainly for basic schooling.  Almost 95 percent of total 18 recurring expenditures on school\neducation in the state is spent on salaries of teachers and other staff; the remainder is used for all\nother items  including  scholarships,  materials,  and  teacher  training.    Reflecting  the  constitutionally\nassigned  division  of  responsibility  for  education,  GMP  is  financing  more  than  90  percent  of  all\neducation-related outlays. In view of resource constraints, GMP is encouraging the establishment of\nprivate  higher  education  institutions,  particularly  in  technical/professional  fields  and  medical\neducation, and on increasing cost recovery in higher education.  Steps have already been initiated\nto  improve  cost  recovery:  the  government  decided  to  transfer  technical  education  institutions\nand  medical  colleges  to  autonomous  nonprofit  trusts,  while  permitting  them  to  raise  user\ncharges  that  can  be  utilized  to  fund  the  institutions\u2019  own  improvements.19    Still,  budgetary\nallocation  and  financing  from  other  sources  are  insufficient  to  cover  minimum  requirements:  for\nexample, the normative requirement for elementary education has been assessed at Rs20 billion,\nalmost  absorbing  the  allocation  for  the  whole  education  sector.    The  resource  gap  would  further\nwiden from FY2002 onward, when external assistance for the District Primary Education Program\n(DPEP),  a  multi-state  project,  ceases  and  GMP  counterpart  funding  equivalent  to  the  central\nGovernment share, i.e., 85 percent of the annual project cost, is required to sustain the program.\n\n38.\nTo  achieve  the  goal  of  universal  primary  education,  GMP  created  the  Rajiv  Gandhi\nEducation Mission, which successfully mobilized external assistance to implement the DPEP in\n34 educationally deficient districts in Madhya Pradesh.  The  DPEP  comprises  improvement  in\nexisting  school  facilities,  teacher  training,  development  of  locally  relevant  curricula,  and\nexpansion  of  facilities.    The  DPEP  is  being  implemented  through  village  councils  to  promote\naccountability and minimize leakage.  It has created 11,000 new primary schools, 6,100 cluster\nresource centers (one for every 10-12 primary schools) to improve the quality of education in\nexisting  primary  schools,  and  369  block  resource  centers  to  provide  academic  support  to\nteachers.  As part of the Rajiv Gandhi Education Mission, in 1996 a mass contact program was\nundertaken  to  count  the  number  of  children  not  going  to  school,  the  facilities  available  at\nprimary school level, and the need for new schools.  The mass contact program revealed that\n\n                                                       \n17 While  gross  enrollment  ratios,  i.e.,  proportion  of  total  number  of  children  enrolled  in  the  relevant  level  of\neducation to the total number of children in the relevant age group, are not age specific, net enrollment ratios are\nadjusted for the enrolled children of over- and under-age groups.\n\n18 Total  recurrent  expenditure  comprises  state  government  expenditures,  expenditures  incurred  by  local  bodies,\n\nexpenditures financed by contribution from fees, endowments, etc.\n\n19 Fees in Government engineering colleges were increased in 1997 from Rs162 to Rs2,000 per annum, and added to a\ndevelopment fee of Rs7,500 per student per year.  Fees for medical colleges were raised from Rs600 to Rs12,000, and\nthe private sector  is  encouraged  to  open  medical  colleges,  which  may  use  medical  facilities  available  in  government\nhospitals for clinical training on payment of a fee of Rs20,000 per student.\n\n\f13\n\nofficial enrollment rates  were  grossly  overstated  and  that  numerous  habitations  in  areas  with\npredominant scheduled tribes and scheduled castes had no access to primary schools.\n\n39.\nOn the basis of these findings, the government decided that, as first step to achieving\nuniversal  primary  education,  it  needed  to  focus  on  access.    To  this  end,  the  Rajiv  Gandhi\nEducation  Mission  implemented  the  Education  Guarantee  Scheme,20  under  which  the  local\ncommunity  provides  suitable  facilities  and  identifies  a  local  resident  with  prescribed  minimum\neducational  qualification  as  teacher.    The  state  government  provides  funding  for  training  and\nteacher\u2019s salary, and guarantees their availability within 90 days of a request from a community\nwithout a primary school, within a radius of 1 km, and with at least 40 pupils (in nontribal areas)\nor 25 pupils (in tribal areas).  The schools are managed entirely by the local communities. The\nscheme  evoked  an  overwhelming  response,  and  about  16,000  new  primary  schools  were\nstarted in the state during the first year of its operation.  Reflecting the high level of community\ninvolvement, 88 percent of the new schools have been established in buildings provided by the\nlocal  communities.    Through  this  initiative,  GMP  is  achieving  universalized  access  to  primary\neducation.\n\nb.\n\nHealth\n\nHigh mortality and morbidity conditions continue to prevail in Madhya Pradesh.  Despite\n40.\nprogress in improving the health status of its population, the state has still extremely low health\nindicators: highest crude death  rate,  the  second  highest  infant  mortality  rate,  and  among  the\nhighest  morbidity  prevalence  rates  of  all  states  in  the  country  (Appendix  4,  Table  A4.4).\nSubstantial differences between rural and urban areas and among socioeconomic groups also\nsuggest comparative underdevelopment and underutilization of rural health facilities as well as\ngender-based discrepancies in the accessibility of existing facilities.21  The poor health status\nof the population co-exists with  abject  poverty,  high  illiteracy  rates  especially  among  females\nand tribal people, and weak infrastructure for health care service delivery.\n\n41.\nIn  rural  areas,  the  public  health  care  system  is  governed  by  central  Government\nguidelines  suggesting  a  three-tiered  structure  consisting  of  sub  health  center,  primary  health\ncenter,  and  community  health  center  as  primary  health  care  delivery  institutions  and  first\nreferral  units.    District  hospitals  and  hospitals  attached  to  medical  colleges  located  in  urban\nareas are the secondary and tertiary health care delivery institutions for providing referral and\nmanagerial support to the primary institutions, while also providing primary health care for the\nurban community.  The guidelines prescribe norms for the coverage, equipment, and staffing\nof rural health facilities, although similar norms have not yet been issued for the urban health\ninfrastructure.  Following promulgation of the National Health Policy in 1983, and in an attempt\nto reverse the earlier bias in allocation toward higher level health care facilities, all states made\nefforts  to  expand  the  primary  health  care  infrastructure  under  a  central  Government-funded\nnational  minimum  needs  program.    In  Madhya  Pradesh,  the  number  of  community  health\ncenters  increased  from  26  to  172  units,  primary  health  centers  from  465  to  1,181  units,  and\n\n                                                       \n20 The central Government budget for FY2000 is proposing to implement such a scheme nationwide, following the\n\nsuccessful initiative of the Madhya Pradesh government.\n\n21 Gender  disparity  is  most  obvious  in  child  mortality  risk:  while  the  neonatal  mortality  risk  of  girls  is  22  percent\nlower  than  for  boys,  the  relative  mortality  risk  by  age  five  is  more  than  20  percent  higher.  Also,  the  relative\nmortality  risk  in  rural  areas  is  almost  twice  the  risk  in  urban  areas,  and  is  further  increasing  based  on  the\neducational background of the mothers.  Similarly, there is gender inequality in the treatment-seeking behavior,\nas  women  have  25  percent  less  propensity  to  get  inpatient  treatment.    In  view  of  the  extremely  low  rate  of\nhospitalization  (4  percent  of  treated  cases)  in  Madhya  Pradesh,  women  are  generally  confined  to  ambulatory\ncare.\n\n\f14\n\nsub health centers from 5,486 to 11,910 units during the 1980s, although the number of higher\nlevel  health  care  delivery  institutions  (e.g.,  medical  colleges  and  district  hospitals)  remained\nunchanged.22  While making progress toward the national norms and covering the entire rural\npopulation,  the  state  government  has  given  inadequate  consideration  to  the  availability  of\nbasic  minimum  facilities  and  staff.    Government  statistics  reveal  that  50-70  percent  of  all\nprimary  health  care  facilities  is  still  without  a  building,  and  that  many  of  the  remaining\ninstitutions  are  in  dilapidated  condition.    Because  of  rudimentary  infrastructure  and  facilities\nand inadequate staffing, the health care system remains grossly underutilized.23\n\n42.\nTotal public and private per capita spending on medical care in the state amounted to\nabout Rs230 in 1993, 30 percent below the national average.  About one fourth of total health\nspending  is  covered  by  the  public  sector,  mostly  for  preventive  and  promotive  care.  The\nremainder is borne by private households for curative primary care (46 percent) and secondary\nand tertiary facilities (27 percent).  Given their high morbidity rate, private health expenditures\ndisproportionately burden the poor.24  Efforts to expand access of health facilities for the poor\nand  increased  investment  for  preventive  health  care,  supply  of  clean  drinking  water  and\nimproved sanitation could yield considerable welfare gains.  At a time  when  demands  on  the\npublic health system are increasing, health sector expenditures have been under pressure.  In\nthe 1990s, public spending for health grew by more than 4 percent  in  real  terms  per  annum,\nabove population growth, but somewhat below real SDP growth.  Resource allocation for rural\nhealth facilities remained at about 34 percent of total health expenditures, after increasing from\n18  percent  in  FY1981  to  more  than  31  percent  by  FY1991.    Yet,  most  of  the  additional\nspending  was  used  to  meet  wage  payments,  accounting  now  for  80  percent  of  total  health\nexpenditure,  while  capital  outlays  account  for  only  3  percent  of  the  total.    A  substantial\nacceleration  of  health  care  spending  is  thus  needed  to  improve  allocative  efficiency,  provide\nbetter  service  quality,  and  move  toward  minimum  national  standards  of  facility  availability  in\nthis sector.\n\n43.\nMadhya Pradesh has been providing economic and social services without proper cost\nrecovery.  As a result, the recovery rate for health services declined from 4 percent in FY1986\nto less than 2 percent a decade later.  This in part reflects the lack of incentive for hospitals to\ngenerate internal revenues as, under the present budgeting system, additional funds accrue to\nthe  state  budget  rather  than  being  used  directly  by  the  health  institution  for  improving  the\nquantity and quality of services.  To alleviate the budgetary constraint, the government in 1997\ntransferred medical colleges and tertiary hospitals to autonomous nonprofit trusts and formally\ndelinked  them  from  government  budgeting  process,  thereby  increasing  their  operational\nfreedom.  GMP  also  permitted  the  formation  of  patient  welfare  societies  to  enable  improved\ncost recovery of secondary hospitals by allowing them to use the resources  raised  locally  for\ntheir service improvement.25\n                                                       \n22 \n\nIn  1990-1998,  the  number  of  community  health  and  sub  health  centers  increased  by  25  and  28  units,\n\nrespectively, while the number of primary health centers increased by 633 units, from 1,181 to 1,814 PHCs.\n\n23  The  inadequacy  of  the  health  care  system  is  also  reflected  in  the  low  utilization  of  maternity  and  child  health\nservices.  For example, only 30 percent of all deliveries are conducted under the  supervision  of  trained  medical\npersonnel, and prenatal and postnatal care is far below all-India average, contributing to the state\u2019s higher infant\nmortality and lower female life expectancy rates.\n\n24 Although per person expenditure on short-term morbidity are relatively constant across income groups, the higher\nmorbidity prevalence among the poor and the differences in per capita income leads to higher cost incidence for\nthe poor. By reducing the morbidity risk, e.g., through  improved  water  supply/sanitation,  pressure  on  the  health\ncare delivery system could be alleviated.\n\nIn  1996,  the  first  year,  Rs20  million  (0.2  percent  of  health  sector  expenditure)  was  raised,  of  which  42\npercent  was  through  donations.  Expenditures  included  construction/maintenance  of  buildings  (41  percent)  and\npurchase of equipment and medicines (38 percent).\n\n25 \n\n\fC.\n\nExternal Assistance to Madhya Pradesh\n\n15\n\n44.\nTotal external assistance to India averaged $3.5 billion annually during the last decade,\nof which two thirds was provided for national-level projects, a further 5 percent for multi-state\nprojects,  and  the  remainder  to  individual  states  (Appendix  7).    Six  states  (Andhra  Pradesh,\nGujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh) received the bulk of external\nfunding  for  state-level  projects.  Since  the  early  1990s,  the  central  Government  has  treated\nexternal  assistance  to  states  as  \u201cadditionality\u201d  over  the  plan  allocations  (footnote  6),  and\nencouraged  them  to  secure  assistance  on  the  basis  of  their  performance  and  absorptive\ncapacity.    The  external  assistance  is  channeled  to  larger  states  on  the  basis  of  a  70:30\nloan/grant  ratio  at  a  fixed  interest  rate.    The  foreign  exchange  risk  is  borne  by  the  central\nGovernment.  Reflecting the shifting focus of external assistance to subnational governments,\nthe share to individual states and for multistate projects has increased from 30 to 40 percent\nand from 5 to 10 percent, respectively, during 1995-1997.\n\nMadhya  Pradesh,  although  accounting  for  13.5  percent  of  the  geographic  area,  8\n45.\npercent of the population, and more than 5 percent of states\u2019 domestic product, has received\ncomparatively low levels of external assistance, averaging less than 0.5 percent of the total aid\nto India and about 1.5 percent of the external assistance support for projects in states.  During\n1986-1998, total commitments received by the state amounted to about $825 million, of which\nthe World Bank provided $400 million mainly for water management and social development.26\nIn view of the state\u2019s investment requirements for improved  physical  and  social  infrastructure\ndevelopment,  the  low  share  of  external  assistance  directed  to  the  state  in  the  past  has\nwidened  the  gap  between  resource  requirements  and  availability.    However,  the  reform\nprocess at the national level and in few states has heightened GMP\u2019s awareness and led to a\nreassessment of the role of external assistance in the state\u2019s development strategy.   GMP  is\nnow  taking  a  more  proactive  approach  through  participation  in  aid  coordination  meetings,\ninvestment forums, and international trips to attract both official and private sector capital.  To\nimprove its capacity to absorb external aid, GMP set up a high-powered committee headed by\nthe  chief  secretary,  and  a  project  monitoring  unit  in  the  Finance  Department\u2019s  Institutional\nFinance Division for effective coordination and project implementation.  Madhya Pradesh was\nselected  by  the  central  Government  as  one  of  the  first  two  states  for  implementation  of  the\nBank/World Bank-assisted Foreign Aid Management Information System.\n\nD.\n\nThe Bank\u2019s Strategy and Lessons Learned\n\n46.\nThe  overall  strategic  objectives  of  Bank  operations  in  India  are  to  assist  in  achieving\nincreased  economic  efficiency  and  higher  levels  of  sustainable  economic  growth  to  foster\nproductive employment and reduce poverty.  To realize these objectives, the Bank\u2019s program\nfor India focuses on alleviating infrastructure constraints by supporting the development of an\neffective  policy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  environment,  and  by  improving  infrastructure\navailability and quality of service; promoting upgrading and protection of the environment and\nresource base across sectors; and targeting social interventions to ensure sustainability of the\ndevelopment process.\n\n47.\nIn view of the  crucial  role  that  Indian  states  play  in  the  provision  of  infrastructure  and\neconomic and social services, the Bank\u2019s strategy advocates a shift toward more interventions\nat  the  subnational  level.    The  main  focus  of  the  strategy  will  be  to  support  and  encourage\n                                                       \n26 \n\nOther multilateral and bilateral sources included the OECF, Overseas Development Agency, Organization\n\nof Petroleum Exporting Countries, European Union, and Danish International Development Assistance.\n\n\f16\n\nstates\u2019  efforts  to  improve  public  resources  management;  and  to  establish  an  enabling\nenvironment  for  enhanced  efficiency  of  public  sector  operations  and  increased  private\ninvestment  in  the  economy.    The  intervention  at  the  subnational  level  will  also  enable  a\ncatalytic  impact  on  social  development.    Bank  support  at  the  state  level  will  assist  in  (i)\nfostering  development  of  social  and  physical  infrastructure;  (ii)  broadening  and  deepening\nreforms  that  have  lagged  behind  in  areas  under  the  purview  of  state  governments;  and  (iii)\nmaximizing  synergy  of  the  Bank\u2019s  economic  and  sector  policy  dialogue  and  project\ninterventions.  The  strategy  takes  into  account  lessons  learned  from  past  operations  in  India,\nparticularly  the  importance  of  sound  development  management  and  appropriate  policy,\nregulatory and institutional environments for interventions to be successful.\n\n48.\nIn  formulating  this  Program,  specific  attention  was  given  to  incorporating  lessons\nlearned from past, albeit limited,27 experience with interventions at the subnational level.  The\nlessons  indicate  that  capacity  building  and  institutional  strengthening  are  important  for  a\nsmooth and timely implementation as well as for sustaining the impact of policy reforms.  They\nalso point to the need for a more realistic time frame for implementation of reforms, particularly\nfor  restructuring  of  PSUs.    One  measure  adopted  in  the  Program  is  TA  support  for\nstrengthening the institutional setup and for capacity building at both the state and local levels,\nprior  to  program  implementation  and  with  continued  support  during  the  early  implementation\nstage.    Another  aspect  of  the  Program  is  its  emphasis  on  implementation  of  strong  policy\nmeasures  at  the  initial  stage  of  reforms  with  clear  focus  on  the  key  reform  components,  to\nbroad-base  the  reform  process  and  to  reflect  government's  commitment.    In  addition,  the\nadjustment  program  is  formulated  for  implementation  over  a  three-year  program  period  in  a\ncomprehensive  but  phased  manner,  allowing  monitoring  of  milestone  events  and  drawing\nlessons from implementation in the initial stage to improve subsequent actions.\n\n49.\nExperience  from  the  Bank\u2019s  intervention  in  Gujarat  (footnote  1)  also  highlights  the\ncrucial  linkage  between  reform  of  public  finances  and  power  sector  reform,  particularly  tariff\nrevision.  In view of the need to ensure an appropriate regulatory and pricing framework for the\npower  sector  at  an  early  stage  of  comprehensive  reforms,  the  Program  envisages  the\nestablishment  of  an  independent  electricity  regulatory  commission  and  includes  specific\nprovisions for tariff review.  Moreover, given the low socioeconomic status of Madhya Pradesh,\nthe Program specifically addresses policy interventions in social sector, social safety net, and\nreforms  of  cooperative  institutions  that  have  a  bearing  particularly  on  the  rural  economy  and\nthe  population  living  in  rural  areas.    The  Bank\u2019s  intervention  in  Gujarat  also  points  to  the\nimportance of regular monitoring and close interaction between the government and the Bank\nto  assess  progress  in  program  implementation  and  to  allow  early  identification  of  possible\nslippage in compliance.  Regular reporting and review missions will be scheduled to follow up\non the progress of reforms in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nV.\n\nTHE PROGRAM\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nIndia  achieved  unprecedented  strong  economic  growth  as  a \n\n50.\nthe\ncomprehensive  stabilization  and  structural  adjustment  program  implemented  since  the  early\n1990s. Immediate beneficiaries of this rapid growth have been millions of inhabitants earning\n                                                       \n27 The  World  Bank  has  provided  state-level  support  mainly  for  power  sector  reform,  but  in  June  1998  provided\nseveral sector loans as part of an economic restructuring program for Andhra Pradesh, a state with significantly\nlower poverty incidence and about one third higher per capita SDP than Madhya Pradesh.\n\nresult  of \n\n\f17\n\non  average  less  than  a  dollar  a  day.  Underlying  this  performance  are  important  structural\ntransformations:  liberalization  and  opening  up  of  the  economy  both  to  private  sector  and\ninternational  competition;  institutional  and  regulatory  reforms  in  the  financial  and  capital\nmarkets;  and  reforms  of  the  tax  system.    The  Government\u2019s  Ninth  Plan  (1997-2002)  reflects\nIndia\u2019s main development objective of achieving and sustaining high rates of economic growth\nand  ensuring  that  growth  benefits  the  poor.  The  development  strategy  will  focus  on\ngovernment\u2019s  role  as  facilitator  of  economic  and  social  development  and  as  a  promoter  of\nenabling policy, institutional, and regulatory environments; it  will also provide  overall  direction\nfor further broadening and deepening of the reform process. Greater freedom will be given to\nstates not only to determine their own development priorities, but also to decide on modalities\nof government intervention and the provision of economic and social services.\n\nThe  increasing  autonomy  and  responsibility  of  the  states  contrast  sharply  with  their\n51.\nability to undertake reforms.  Although states play an important role in the development of the\ncountry  and  account  for  the  bulk  of  expenditure  on  economic  and  social  services,  they  lag\nbehind in the reform process.  Thus, state-level reforms need to be made to complement and\nreinforce  Government  policy  initiatives  and  to  strengthen  states\u2019  technical  and  financial\ncapabilities to address development challenges.  Among the key areas for state-level reforms\nare  social  services  including  education  and  public  health  and  sanitation;  consolidation  of  the\npublic  finances;  and  infrastructure  policies.    The  states\u2019  fiscal  situation  has  been  under\nincreasing  pressure  due  to  their  weak  revenue  base  and  a  shift  from  growth-inducing  and\nsocially  productive  investments  toward  nonproductive  spending  such  as  interest  obligations\nand \n  Declining  development\nexpenditures  have  also  adversely  affected  the  existing  infrastructure,  which  increasingly\nhinders further development.  In the context of limited public sector resources and competing\ndemands  on  resource  allocation,  the  impetus  for  improvement  will  lie  in  greater  induction  of\nprivate investment, necessitating an appropriate policy, institutional, and regulatory framework.\n\ninefficient  public  enterprises. \n\nthe  budgetary  burden  of \n\n52.\nThe  Bank\u2019s  operational  strategy  focus  and  its  emphasis  on  state-level  reform  provide\nthe general direction and parameters for Bank support.  Gujarat, one of the more progressive\nstates with a strong industrial basis, was identified as the first state for such Bank assistance.\nThe Program seeks to extend and deepen structural  reforms  at  the  subnational  level,  and  to\npromote economic and social development.  However, large variations in development stages\nbetween Indian states require the Bank\u2019s subnational operations to focus on entities with very\ndifferent  socioeconomic  characters:  unlike  Gujarat,  Madhya  Pradesh  is  one  of  the  least-\ndeveloped states in India, has wide gender gaps in access to economic resources and social\nservices,  and  still  has  a  primarily  agriculture-based  economy;  and  compared  with  Gujarat,\nMadhya Pradesh has high income poverty and a relatively large minority population, implying\nthe need for a stronger social dimension to Bank assistance.\n\n53.\nLimited resources and implementation capabilities hinder the development process and\nheighten  the  challenge  faced  by  GMP.    Given  the  existing  poverty  in  terms  of  both  material\nwealth  and  capabilities,  delay  in  addressing  and  overcoming  these  development  challenges\nwill have an adverse impact on the state\u2019s future economic growth and social development.  It\nmay  also  prevent  the  state  from  responding  to  central  Government  policy  initiatives  and  limit\nthe  benefit  the  country  could  otherwise  derive  from  mutually  supportive  reforms.  GMP  has\nalready initiated reforms on a selective basis, including private sector participation in road and\ntransport  sectors  and  in  tax  reform,  and  has  taken  innovative  initiatives  for  human\ndevelopment.  The state is off to a good start, which indicates GMP\u2019s commitment to face the\n\n\f18\n\ndevelopment challenges.  Bank support will facilitate implementation of GMP\u2019s reform program\nand provide a strong example for other struggling, but reform-oriented states.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n54.\nThe  objective  of  the  Bank\u2019s  program  is  to  support  the  government's  reform  efforts  to\nfoster social development and sustainable economic growth by addressing prevailing resource\nand  implementation  constraints  in  Madhya  Pradesh,  focusing  on  (i)  enhancing  resource\nallocation to social sectors to support human  development;  (ii)  improving  public  finances  and\nfiscal capabilities and management, and fostering allocative efficiency through reform of public\nenterprises  including  corporate  governance  reform;  and  (iii)  strengthening  the  policy,\nregulatory,  and  institutional  frameworks  for  private  sector  participation  in  key  sectors.  The\nProgram will also assist in strengthening environmental management,  and  mitigate  the  social\nimpact of economic development.\n\nC.\n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\n55.\nTo  address  resource  and  implementation  constraints  and  to  improve  resource\nmanagement  for  sustainable  social  and  economic  development,  the  Program  will  assist  in\nimplementing public sector reforms, including capacity building and institutional strengthening\nfor improved fiscal management; strengthening revenue mobilization, curtailing nonproductive\nexpenditure,  and  reallocating  resources  to  social  services,  particularly  health  and  education;\nimproving  allocative  efficiency  through  reform  of  PSUs;  and  establishing  transparent\norganizational and incentive structures for enhanced private sector participation.    \n\n1.\n\nCapacity  Building  and  Institutional  Strengthening  for  Improved  Fiscal\nManagement and Sustainable Public Finances\n\n56.\nIn  accordance  with  the  Program,  in  January  1998  the  Government  set  up  a  Public\nResource  Management  Committee  (PRMC)  under  the  chief  minister  to  advise  and  oversee\nimplementation  of  the  state\u2019s  reform  program.    The  PRMC  is  supported  by  empowered\ncommittees on public finance reform and on  public  enterprises  restructuring,  both  headed  by\nthe  chief  secretary  with  high-level  representation \nto\nsystematically review and implement  public  finance  and  public  enterprise  reform  in  the  state.\nThe  PRMC  will  also  guide  the  establishment  of  an  enabling  environment  and  the  respective\npolicy, institutional, and regulatory issues.\n\nfrom  key  sector  departments, \n\n57.\nCorrective  measures  need  to  be  taken  to  address  both  the  revenue  as  well  as  the\nexpenditure side of public finance within a medium-term fiscal  reform  program.    Some  of  the\nrevenue measures are expected to lead to short-term losses but yield significant benefits in the\nmedium  term.    The  Program  therefore  advocates  properly  sequenced  policies  supplemented\nby compensatory measures to offset adverse fiscal impacts to the extent possible.  The reform\nof public finances will focus on restructuring of the state\u2019s tax system to improve its efficiency\nand equity; rationalizing and prioritizing expenditure; supporting the reallocation of resources to\nsocial  services,  particularly  health  and  education;  enhancing  the  economic  management\ncapacity; and strengthening the institutional framework.\n\n58.\nIn line with the Program, the government's fiscal strategy reflected in the medium-term\nfiscal  framework  (MTFF)  aims  to  (i)  attenuate  the  accumulation  of  public  debt  during  the\ntransition period so as to stabilize the debt-SDP ratio over the medium term; (ii) consolidate the\n\n\f19\n\npublic  finances  by  reducing  nonproductive  expenditure  while  reallocating  resources  to  social\nservices  and  for  public  investment;  and  (iii)  improve  the  \u201cquality\u201d  of  the  fiscal  balance  by\nfocusing on the composition of fiscal adjustment.  To this end, the MTFF envisages a reduction\nin the primary fiscal deficit (defined as current revenue minus total expenditure net of interest\nexpenditure)  from  estimated  2.6  percent  (budgeted  3.4  percent,  including  supplementary\nbudget)  of  SDP  in  FY1999  to  0.2  percent  by  FY2003  (Appendix  5,  Table  A5.2).    The\nprogrammed  reduction  will  help  contain  current  expenditure  by  reducing  nonproductive\nexpenditure,  particularly  subsidies.    It  will  also  ease  pressure  on  the  wage  bill  through\nemployment policy measures such as limiting state government employment, shifting posts to\nessential social services, and evolving a more flexible wage policy, particularly for local bodies\nthat need to be strengthened for more effective decentralization.  The  fiscal  program  will  also\nreverse  the  compression  of  capital  outlays  and  support  an  expansion  of  public  investment.\nIncreased  resource  mobilization  will  result  over  the  medium  term  through  improvement  in\nbuoyancy  of  the  value-added  tax,  stamp  duty,  and  property  tax;  28  strengthening  of  tax\nadministration;  and  improvement  in  cost  recovery.    The  fiscal  program  will  fully  absorb  the\nimpact  of  the  substantive  adjustment  costs  associated  with  structural  reforms  of  the  tax\nsystem, the restructuring of the public enterprises, and outlays to mitigate social impact of the\nadjustment  program  (para.  94).    To  provide  institutional  support  to  the  implementation  of  the\nMTFF, a state budgeting and fiscal analysis unit will be established in the Finance Department\nfor improved budget planning, monitoring, and economic policy analysis.\n\na.\n\nTax and Nontax Revenue Measures\n\nMadhya Pradesh has made progress in its reform of the sales tax system: the number\n59.\nof rate categories was cut from 17 to six, and a self-assessment system for small dealers was\nput  in  place  to  reduce  the  administrative  burden  of  tax  audit.    Nonetheless,  financial  and\ntechnical  limitations  prevented  implementation  of  comprehensive  tax  reforms,  and  distortions\nsuch  as  the  cascading  effect  of  input  taxation,  narrow  tax  base,  complex  multiple  tax  rate\nstructure, and weak tax administration remain. Cognizant of these constraints, the government\nwill  (i)  further  rationalize  the  sales  tax  structure,  (ii)  widen  the  tax  base  by  reducing  tax\nexemptions and limiting the coverage of the industrial incentives scheme, and (iii) introduce in\na  phased  manner  value-added  tax.    Strengthening  tax  administration  and  improving\nmanagement  information  systems  will  provide  institutional  backup  for  these  reforms.    The\nremoval  of  input  taxation  will  lead  in  the  transition  period  to  revenue  losses  anticipated  at\nabout  $170  million  equivalent  (para.  94).    However,  the  widening  of  the  tax  base  and\nenhanced  tax  compliance  fostered  by  strengthened  tax  administration  will  improve  revenue\nbuoyancy in the medium term.\n\n60.\nIn  line  with  recommendations  of  the  1996  and  1997  committees  of  state  finance\nministers,  the  government  plans  to  reform  the  stamp  duty  and  property  tax  systems  by\nlowering the stamp duty rate, particularly on conveyances, rationalizing and standardizing rates\nof  financial  and  capital  markets  instruments  including  mortgages  and  transactions  relating  to\nsecuritization,29  modernizing  stamp  duty  administration,  and  setting  up  valuation  cells.  The\nreduction in duty rates is expected to reduce initial revenues by about $16 million equivalent.\nThrough  strengthening  of  the  institutional  and  operational  framework,  particularly  the\n\n                                                       \n28 These taxes mobilize the bulk of the state\u2019s tax revenues (sales tax  and stamp duty alone raise more than  one\nhalf  of  state's  tax  revenues),  while  property  tax  accounts  for  about  30  percent  of  urban  local  bodies\u2019  revenue\nbase.\n\nThe  lowering  of  stamp  duty  on  instruments  relating  to  securitization  will  directly  benefit  the  Program\u2019s\n\n29 \n\nintervention and objective in the housing sector (para. 93).\n\n\f20\n\nestablishment of central and regional valuation cells and revision of valuation methodology and\nguidelines,  the  revenue  buoyancy  of  these  taxes  will  be  raised  and  additional  resources\nmobilized.  Given that  property  tax  is  an  important  source  of  revenue  for  urban  local  bodies,\nthe introduction of simple, transparent, and criteria-based system of property assessment  will\nalso help strengthen the fiscal position of local governments and enable them to improve their\ndelivery of social and economic services.\n\n61.\nNontax  revenue  enhancement  will  be  supported  under  the  Program  inter  alia  through\nbetter  cost  recovery  in  economic  and  social  services,  establishment  of  tariff  regulatory\nframeworks including the setting up of a State Electricity Regulatory Commission and a utilities\npricing commission, and higher return on state's investment in public enterprises.\n\nb.\n\nExpenditure Management\n\n62.\nIn  parallel  with  structural  revenue  measures,  the  government  plans  to  rationalize  and\nprioritize expenditure and to strengthen expenditure management and control systems.  In the\ncontext  of  the  MTFF  (para.  58),  a  change  in  composition  of  expenditure  and  containment  of\noverall expenditures are envisaged.  Particular emphasis will be on reallocation of resources to\nimprove delivery of social services, augment social infrastructure, and ensure sustainability of\nongoing government initiatives. The Program\u2019s support for improved resource management by\nsuch means will foster social development in the state.\n\n63.\nThe recent recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission have raised significantly the\nfiscal burden and will substantially worsen the medium-term outlook of states\u2019 public finances,\nunless  decisively  addressed.    GMP  therefore  puts  high  priority  on  containing  current\nexpenditures,  for  example  by  cutting  nonproductive  outlays  and  limiting  state  government\nemployment.  Specific measures will include (i) prohibiting absorption of PSU employees into\ngovernment service and prohibiting regularization of temporary workers into public service and\nPSUs; (ii) allowing different wage scales to prevail at the state and local levels and  in  PSUs;\nand  (iii)  establishing  a  regulatory  framework  for  electricity  tariff  adjustment,  including  a\ntimeframe  for  announcement  of  the  first  general  tariff  revision.    The  government  is  also\ncontemplating  reducing  staff  (other  than  technical  positions  in  essential  social  services  and\npolice)  through  natural  attrition,  and  reallocating  the  resources  to  social  services.  These\nmeasures  will  directly  reduce  revenue  expenditures.    Making  wages  more  flexible  will  also\nstrengthen financial sustainability, particularly of local bodies and of public enterprises, by de-\nlinking wage setting.30\n\n 64.\nEnabling private sector participation, investment by the public sector, and improvement\nin  the  basic  social  and  physical  infrastructure  necessitates  increased  capital  outlays.    Under\nthe  Program\u2019s  MTFF,  improved  resource  mobilization  is  expected  to  make  this  possible.\nFurthermore, the government is preparing a core investment program (CIP) to prioritize the use\nof its overall development expenditures.  The CIP will protect the high-priority projects from ad\nhoc  budgetary  cuts,  which  should  enable  more  timely  project  implementation  and  avoid  cost\noverrun and thin spreading of scarce budgetary resources.  Developing the CIP will involve a\n\n                                                       \n30 As the states follow central Government pay scale adjustment, and PSUs as well as local bodies generally follow\nthe state governments, all salary scales are de facto linked to one another.  In view of the declining capacity for\nown resource mobilization at lower levels, pressure on the sustainability of their financial situation increases and,\nin the absence of offsetting transfers, will erode profitability (in the case of PSUs) or service delivery (in the case\nof  local  governments).    Declining  quality  in  service  delivery  would  adversely  and  disproportionately  affect  the\npoorer section of the population, particularly in rural areas.\n\n\f21\n\ncomprehensive review of the project pipeline of all sectors, closure of nonperforming projects,\ntransfer to private sector if  projects  could  be  implemented  there  more  efficiently,  and  greater\nemphasis on projects under external assistance.\n\nThe  structural  improvement  in  expenditures  can  only  be  sustained  if  expenditure\n65.\nmanagement  and  control  systems  are  improved.    To  this  end,  the  Program  will  support  the\ngovernment\u2019s  effort  to  strengthen  the  Finance  Department\u2019s  treasury  operations,  increase\neffectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the  payment  and  audit  systems,  and  develop  a  management\ninformation  system  to  provide  updated  and  adequate  information  on  all  relevant  budget\nvariables.  This will enable the Finance Department and concerned decision-making authorities\nto  regularly  assess  the  status  of  budget  implementation  and  compliance  with  the  fiscal\nconsolidation  efforts  under  the  MTFF,  allow  early  identification  of  possible  expenditure\noverruns  as  well  as  redirection  of  funds  toward  nonpriority  areas,  and  facilitate  the\ngovernment\u2019s cash management.  Better liquidity management, coupled with the strengthening\nof  the  Finance  Department\u2019s  debt  management  capability,  will  enable  GMP  to  reduce  its\ninterest obligations at the margin and, more importantly, could help smooth interest fluctuations\nin  the  short-term  money  and  financial  markets.    Moreover,  setting  up  a  state  budgeting  and\nfiscal analysis unit will reduce the government\u2019s reliance on supplementary budgets, increase\ntransparency  of  the  annual  budgeting  exercise,  and  strengthen  the  role  of  the  budget  as  an\ninstrument for rational economic policy making.\n\n2.\n\nReallocation of Expenditures to Social Services\n\nGMP  is  committed  to  reallocating  resources  to  social  sectors,  especially  health  and\n66.\neducation.  Under the Program, GMP will also prepare and implement a plan to ensure that the\npresent social sector outlays are protected from budgetary cuts, and indicate how  the  state\u2019s\ncurrent status in social indicators well below national norms could be redressed over time.\n\na.\n\nEducation Sector\n\n67.\nPolicy priorities in the education sector include (i) universalization of primary education\nand  improvement  in  the  quality  of  teaching;  (ii)  strengthening  other  levels  of  the  education\nsystem within given budget constraints; and (iii) increasing local government involvement in the\neducation system through financial and management decentralization, particularly  for  primary\neducation.  GMP is committed to reviewing the policy, institutional, and regulatory frameworks\nof  the  education  sector;  to  setting  up  nonprofit  autonomous  institutions;  and  to  further\nanalyzing  possibilities  for  strengthening  the  resource  base  through  enhanced  cost  recovery,\nespecially  at  the  postsecondary  level.    Under  the  Program,  the  government  will  prepare\nprioritized investment plans for the  education  sector,  which  are  to  be  fully  integrated  into  the\nstate\u2019s CIP. An action plan will also be formulated outlining feasible steps to move toward the\nnational norms in expenditure on educational facilities, training, material, etc.  In the meantime,\nthe  Government  will  protect  outlays  for  education  from  ad  hoc  budgetary  cuts  while  raising\nresource allocation within the medium-term fiscal framework.\n\n68.\nAs  noted  in  para.  37,  Madhya  Pradesh  is  availing  itself  of  assistance  under  the\nexternally  funded  DPEP.    The  government  is  committed  to  ensuring  continuation  of  this\nprogram after external funding support ceases.  From  FY2002  onward,  GMP  will  assume  full\nfinancing  responsibility  by  making  budgetary  provisions  equivalent  to  the  present  central\nGovernment  share,  i.e.,  85  percent  of  the  annual  recurrent  project  cost.    This  will  ensure\n\n\f22\n\nfunding  availability  for  continuation  of  DPEP  and  promote  sustainability  of  ongoing  efforts  to\nimprove primary education in the state.\n\n       \n\nb.\n\nHealth Sector\n\n69.\nGMP will strengthen the state\u2019s health care system by increasing allocation for primary\nhealth  care  delivery  institutions,  and  by  enhancing  the  capacity  and  efficiency  of  district\nhospitals  through  increased  recovery  of  cost  of  services.    It  will  also  promote  community\ninvolvement in health care through the village councils.  To improve health care in rural areas,\nunder the Program the annual budget provision will  be  increased  to  eliminate  the  investment\nbacklog  on  existing  rural  health  facilities,  estimated  at  Rs2.5  billion,  over  the  medium  term.\nGMP is committed to raising allocation for nonpersonnel inputs (e.g., drugs and equipment) to\ncover the shortfall in recurrent spending on existing facilities.31  Improvement in the quality of\nhealth service delivery will also require increased staffing of primary health facilities.  In view of\nthe  overall  budget  constraint  and  the  disproportionate  share  of  funding  going  for  wages  and\nsalaries, the Program focus will be on reassigning posts already in government departments to\nsocial services.  In particular, during the program period, government staff other than those in\ntechnical  positions  in  essential  social  services  and  police  will  be  reduced  through  natural\nattrition, and the resources associated with these posts shifted to social services.\n\n70.\nGMP  will  extend  its  rural  sanitation  program  focusing  on  the  control  of  diarrheal\ndiseases, so far launched in 11,000 problem villages, to all 71,000 villages of the state.  The\nfocus  on  sanitation  education,  promotion  of  water  testing  kits,  and  distribution  of  oral\nrehydration salts, is expected to reduce fatalities from waterborne diseases, which are a major\ncause of the state\u2019s high infant mortality rate.  As poor people are more affected by short-term\nmorbidity  and  spend  a  relatively  large  share  of  their  income  on  treatment,  this  measure  will\nalso have a beneficial poverty-reducing effect.\n\n71.\nFurther,  GMP  is  preparing  an  action  plan  with  Bank  TA  for  protecting  social  sector\noutlays from ad hoc budgetary cuts, ensuring that investment spending is fully integrated into\nthe  overall  CIP,  and  for  moving  toward  national  norms  on  health  infrastructure  and  health\nservice delivery. The government plans to strengthen the legal arrangements for the autonomy\nof  secondary  and  tertiary  institutions,  to  foster  public-private  partnership,  and  particularly  to\nenable  these  independent  trusts  to  price  their  services  accurately  and  determine  the  fee\nstructure considering varying abilities to pay.  The costing of services and health budgeting will\nbe analyzed as part of the action plan.\n\n3. \n\nPublic Enterprise Reform\n\nThe  Program  supports  reform  of  public  enterprises  in  two  distinct,  albeit  interrelated,\n72.\ndimensions:  restructuring/divestment  of  individual  PSUs,  and  enhanced  transparency  and\naccountability  within  the  public  enterprises  sector.    The  reform  process  is  guided  by  GMP\u2019s\nPolicy  on  Public  Sector  Reform  and  Restructuring,  which  evolved  from  the  Bank\u2019s  policy\ndialogue with the government, and was approved in January 1998.  On the basis of the policy\nguidelines,  GMP  will  strengthen  those  PSUs  where  continued  government  ownership  is\nrequired  to  fulfill  a  public  purpose;  close  chronically  sick  and  loss-incurring  enterprises;  and\nrestructure  and  divest  remaining  enterprises  to  achieve  greater  efficiency  in  their  operations,\nincrease  market  discipline,  and  allow  wider  dispersion  of  ownership.  The  government  has\n                                                       \n31 \n\nInterventions  could  include  establishing  a  dispenser  for  essential  drugs  at  the  village  level  that  would  be\n\nmaintained by local bodies, training for community health workers, etc.\n\n\f23\n\nalready  established  the  institutional  mechanism  for  effective  implementation  of  the  reform,\nconsisting  of  an  Empowered  Committee  on  Public  Enterprises  Restructuring,  headed  by  the\nchief  secretary  with  high-level  representation  from  key  sector  departments;  and  a  technical\nsecretariat as an advisory body to undertake the preparatory  and  technical  analysis  of  PSUs\nincluding  valuation,  and  to  provide  assistance  on  technical  aspects  of  restructuring  and\ndivestment.  In implementing public enterprise reform, nodal responsibility  for  state  PSUs  will\nbe  transferred  from  line  departments  to  the  Department  of  Public  Enterprise  to  facilitate\ncoordination and reduce possible conflict of interest.\n\n73.\nThe  reform  agenda  supported  by  the  Program  will  focus  on  corporate  and  financial\nrestructuring of 14 of the 31 state PSUs. 32  The enterprises targeted under the Program have\na total of 37,000 employees, and account for four fifths of total paid-up capital and represent\n85  percent  of  GMP  shareholding  in  PSUs  (excluding  MP  Electricity  Board).  The  PSU  reform\ncovers the whole gamut of enterprises, ranging in size from large entities such as the MPSRTC\nwith some 22,000 employees to the smallest with a workforce of 75; strategic PSUs involved in\nagro-industry;  key  financial  intermediaries;  and  enterprises  with  overlapping  developmental\nand social functions.  Moreover, the reform program comprises nonviable entities; entities  for\nwhich  the  original  objectives  for  their  establishment  are  no  longer  valid;  and  entities  that  are\nstrategic but do not require full government ownership.\n\na.\n\nRestructuring/Divestment\n\n(MPSIndDC)  while \n\nthe  chairman  and  a  majority  of  directors \n\nGMP  will  undertake  organizational  and  financial  restructuring  of  the  Madhya  Pradesh\n74.\nreducing  government\nIndustrial  Development  Corporation \nState \nshareholding through induction of a strategic partner.  This will be supplemented by corporate\ngovernance  reform  including  a  change  in  the  composition  of  the  company\u2019s  Board  by\nappointing \nthe  government.\nRestructuring  of  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Agro  Industries  Development  Corporation\n(MPSAIDC) will focus initially on hiving off its large agricultural farm, the core strategic function\nof the corporation, in view of the provisions of the Madhya Pradesh Agricultural Land Ceilings\nAct,  which  limits  the  size  of  agricultural  land  under  private  ownership.  Subsequent  reform  of\nMPSAIDC will include divestment to not more than 26 percent of government shareholding by\nDecember 2001.\n\nfrom  outside \n\n75.\nDue to its inefficient operations, MPSRTC has become a major burden on the budget.\nUnder  the  Program,  the  company  will  be  restructured  into  four  corporate  units  with  full\noperational  autonomy,  the  workforce  reduced  by  about  5,000  workers  (or  23  percent),  and\nmeasures  to  improve  operational  efficiency,  reduce  cost,  and  increase  future  profitability\nintroduced.  Partial divestment will be undertaken by December 2001.\n\n76.\nFinancial and organizational restructuring of the Madhya Pradesh Financial Corporation\n(MPFinC),  the  key  state  financial  intermediary,  will  include  (i)  classification  of  nonperforming\nassets  and  full  provisioning  as  per  applicable  norms;  and  (ii)  recapitalization  to  ensure\ncompliance  with  capital  adequacy  requirements  after  setting  off  accumulated  losses  against\nthe  corporation\u2019s  equity  and  reserves.    Government  shareholding  will  be  reduced  by  25\npercent  as  permissible  under  the  State  Financial  Corporations  Act  1951  (contingent  upon\namendment to the Act, GMP shareholding will be further reduced to not more than 26 percent).\n\n                                                       \n32 Restructuring of MPEB will be addressed in the context of power sector reform; the Program focuses particularly\non  establishing  a  tariff  regulatory  framework  to  improve  MPEB\u2019s  internal  resource  mobilization  and  reduce\nreliance on the state budget.\n\n\f24\n\n77.\nIn accordance with the state\u2019s tourism  policy,  the  government  is  refocusing  its  role  as\npromoter  of  tourism  rather  than  operator  and  supplier  of  facilities.    To  this  end,  GMP  is\nenvisaging  the  sale/lease  of \nthe  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Tourism\nDevelopment Corporation (MPSTourDC), and transfer of staff to private sector owners/lessees\nto  the  extent  possible.    The  corporation's  focus  will  then  be  redirected  to  promotional  and\nregulatory  activities,  undertaken  earlier  by  the  state  tourism  department  prior  to  its\nabolishment.\n\nthe  properties  of \n\nb.\n\nClosure and/or Merger\n\n78.\nBased  on  GMP\u2019s  policy  guidelines  to  close  loss-incurring  enterprises,  as  well  as\nunviable  corporations  that  no  longer  fulfill  their  intended  objectives,  the  Program  supports\nclosure  of  the  MP  State  Land  Development  Corporation  (MPSLandDC),  the  MP  Leather\nDevelopment  Corporation  (MPLDC),  the  MP  State  Fisheries  Development  Corporation\n(MPSFishC),  the  MP  State  Industries  Corporation  (MPSIC),  the  MP  State  Export  Corporation\n(MPSExC), as well as MP State Textile Corporation (MPSTexC).    Only  MPSTexC  will  require\napprovals  from  the  Board  for  Industrial  and  Financial  Reconstruction  and  its  appellate\nauthority;  the  government  has  initiated  the  request  for  approval  to  close  the  two  mills  under\ntheir purview.\n\n79.\nThe  multiplicity  of  government  agencies  involved  in  housing  construction  and  related\nactivities has led to inefficient operations and inadequate financial performance.  To rationalize\noperations  and  improve  their  efficiency,  the  government  is  planning  to  merge  the  Madhya\nPradesh Slum Clearance Board (MPSCB) with the Madhya  Pradesh  Housing  Board  (MPHB),\ncorporatize MPHB, and close the Madhya Pradesh Police Housing Corporation (MPPHC).\n\nOverall,  about  10,000  workers  are  likely  to  be  directly  affected  by  the  closure  and\n80. \nmerger of these entities. The government has already set up the State Renewal Fund, made\nbudgetary allocation to enable settlement of workers\u2019 dues, and is designing a social safety net\non the basis of a poverty impact assessment.\n\nc.\n\nImproved Corporate Governance\n\n81.\nPublic enterprises are expected to meet social and other noncommercial objectives, in\naddition  to  financial  objectives;  however,  in  pursuing  these  objectives,  PSU  management\ngenerally has limited discretion over fundamental decisions.  Faced by multifarious objectives,\nlimited decision-making autonomy, and few incentives, PSU management  will often postpone\nor  avoid  necessary  decisions.    This  is  reinforced  by  the  existing  system  of  performance\nmonitoring, accountability, and appointment procedures.\n\nfor \n\nThe  Program  will  support  measures \n\n82.\nimproving  corporate  governance  and\nstrengthening  the  implementation  framework,  comprising  (i)  institutional  and  management\naspects,  including  assigning  nodal  responsibility  for  PSU  reform  to  the  Department  of  Public\nEnterprise;  establishing  procedures  for  screening  prospective  board  members  and  managing\ndirectors  to  ensure  appointment  on  a  professional  basis  and  with  due  regard  to  the  PSUs\u2019\nservice  rules;  introducing  procedures  for  enhanced  accountability  as  well  as  associated\nperformance-related  incentives  for  PSU  management;  and  ensuring  longer  tenure  for\nmanaging  directors  while  discontinuing  the  practice  of  combining  that  post  with  other\ngovernment  positions;  and  (ii)  financial  aspects,  including  formulating  criteria  on  return  on\n\n\f25\n\ninvestment for dividend payment from PSUs to GMP, establishing investment limits up to which\nPSUs do not need government approval, reviewing the existing practice of uniform pay scales\nfor  PSUs,  and  authorizing  the  linking  of  salary  scales  to  the  productivity  and  the  financial\nperformance  of  individual  PSUs.    TA  will  also  be  provided  to  improve  the  accounting  and\nfinancial systems of the public enterprises.\n\nd.\n\nMitigating Social Impact through Social Safety Net\n\nThe organizational restructuring is expected to lead overall to the retrenchment of more\n83.\nthan 16,500 workers. To ameliorate the social impact, GMP is formulating a social safety  net\nmechanism and set up a State Renewal Fund, which will provide funds to voluntary retirement\nschemes  with  monetary  compensation  packages  for  the  affected  workers.33    The  State\nRenewal  Fund  will  also  assist  in  the  economic  rehabilitation  through  re-training  and  re-\ndeployment  of  employees.  To  ensure  timely  access  to  voluntary  retirement  scheme  funds,\nRs1.5 billion ($35 million) were already allocated in the FY1999 and FY2000 budgets, and will\nbe replenished through further budgetary allocation as agreed under the Program.\n\n4.\n\nEvolving Enabling Framework\n\n \nThe  Program  supports  GMP  in  improving  the  allocation  and  efficiency  of  the  public\n84.\nsector,  and  evolving  the  institutional,  regulatory,  and  policy  environment  for  private  sector\nparticipation  in  supporting  infrastructure.  It  will  facilitate  the  formation  and  establishment  of\ntransparent  organizational  and  incentive  structures  to  ensure  access  by  interested  private\nparties.  This will require transparency in decision making, de-politicizing existing tariff-setting\nprocedures,  and  establishing  appropriate  regulatory  and  pricing  mechanisms,  as  well  as\nstructural changes in public sector entities to induce commercialization and phasing-out of their\nreliance on budgetary resources.\n\n85.\nIn  line  with  the  Program,  GMP  envisages  fundamental  reform  of  the  power  sector.\nOverall  objectives  of  the  reform  include  (i)  achieving  commercial  efficiency  and  improving\nviability  of  the  sector;  (ii)  increasing  operational  efficiency  through  enhanced  competition,\nmanagerial autonomy, and higher accountability; and (iii) creating an enabling environment for\nprivate  sector  participation.  GMP  plans  to  open  up  power  generation  to  the  private  sector,\nincluding  for  co-generation  plants  and  captive  generating  units,  and  envisages  new  public\ngenerating  stations  in  competition  with  private  sector  generators.    Power  distribution  may  be\ndecentralized into manageable zones that operate as independent profit centers, and would be\nopen  for  private  sector  interest  through  a  transparent,  competitive  bidding  process.  Although\nprivate sector involvement is envisaged, reform of transmission will focus on commercialization\nof operations in addition to upgrading and strengthening the existing substation structure.\n\n86.\nThe  Program  will  support  the  establishment  of  a  statutory,  independent  regulatory\nauthority, the Madhya Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (MPERC), with responsibility\nfor determining electricity tariffs and for promoting competition, efficiency, and economy in the\nactivities of the electricity industry.  The MPERC will be fully operational by March  2000,  and\ntariff  revision  is  to  take  place  within  120  days  following  commencement  of  its  operations.\nRationalization  of  the  tariff  structure  will  allow  the  power  sector  to  recover  operational  costs,\nmeet  its  statutory  financial  obligations,  generate  funds  to  finance  part  of  its  investment\nprogram,  and  relieve  the  industrial  and  commercial  consumers  from  being  overly  burdened\n                                                       \n33 A poverty impact assessment  was  conducted  and  socioeconomic  profile  of  the  workforce  of  PSUs  prepared  to\n\nprovide a benchmark for the design and implementation of the social safety net.\n\n\f26\n\nwith cross-subsidies.  The policy measures supported by the Program are to initiate reform of\nthe  power  sector  and  contribute  to  sustainability  of  the  public  finances.    Further  Bank\ninvolvement, including through separate Bank intervention in support of comprehensive power\nsector restructuring, will build on the establishment of the regulatory framework and reform of\npower tariffs under the Madhya Pradesh Public Resource Management Program.\n\n87.\nThe opening up of the power sector to private sector generation and the introduction of\nseveral  implementing  agencies  will  increase  the  need  for  improved  long-term  planning  and\ncoordination at the state level to optimize investments.  To facilitate this, an integrated plan for\nthe  sector\u2019s  development  including  least-cost  program  for  expansion  of  the  power  system  is\nneeded.  The Program will support development of a power system master plan and its use as\nbasis for preparation  of  a  sector  CIP,  which  will  be  integrated  into  Madhya  Pradesh\u2019s  overall\nCIP and follow the priorities set for GMP\u2019s public sector investments.\n\n88.\nTo establish a conducive and transparent framework for private sector operations, GMP\nis preparing a roads sector policy, which aims to  provide  an  efficient  roads  system,  including\nconnections  to  all  larger  villages  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  various  sectors  in  the  economy\neffectively through an appropriate inter-modal transport mix.  The policy will encourage private\nsector participation in the roads  sector  including  under  built-operate-transfer  arrangements  in\nroad construction and maintenance.  In line with current practice,  the  private  sector  needs  to\nadopt  prevailing  construction  standards  and  comply  with  all  safety  and  environmental\nregulations.  The design and implementation of private sector projects will be coordinated and\nfacilitated by a private sector cell, to be set up within Public Works Department, which will also\nmonitor compliance with these agreed upon standards.  For the systematic development of the\nroads  network  including  private  sector  projects,  the  Department  will  prepare  a  sector  CIP\nbased on its strategic options study, which is to be fully integrated into the overall CIP.  Highest\npriority will be assigned to improving high-density state highway corridors.  External assistance\nis being contemplated to finance part of the high-priority road network extension.\n\n89.\nTwo other venues  for  private  sector  involvement  in  the  state\u2019s  roads  sector  are  being\nimplemented and expected to benefit from the transparency of the enabling framework.  First,\nGMP  is  permitting  private  industry  to  construct  and  upgrade  link  roads  between  villages  and\nindustrial growth centers.  It will reimburse industry for the costs either through deduction from\ntheir tax liabilities or, in the case of resource-based industry, by reducing royalty payment due\nto  government.    Second,  to  facilitate  private  sector  participation,  Infrastructure  Leasing  &\nFinancial Services Ltd. and GMP (through the MPSIndDC) formed a joint venture, the MP Tolls\nLtd.  Incorporated in January 1996, the company will (i) participate in any scheme promoted by\nthe  government  or  domestic  or  foreign  private  sector  parties  to  build  and  operate  roads,\ndevelop  transport  facilities,  and  collect  tolls  or  charges  for  such  activities;  and  (ii)  attract\ninstitutional financing for toll road construction.\n\n90.\nUnder  the  Program,  the  government  will  formulate  a  plan  for  and  establish  a  utilities\npricing  commission  by  the  end  of  2000.    Tolls  may  be  based  on  the  mode  of  financing,\nprojected  traffic  flows,  government\u2019s  contribution  to  land  costs  and  access  to  land  near  the\nroad  project,  the  cost  of  road  maintenance,  and  an  adequate  return  to  investment.    In  the\ninterim, GMP will review the existing toll rates for roads and bridges and assess the feasibility\nand practicality of distance-based toll rates.\n\n91.\nTo improve the enabling framework for road transportation, GMP  will issue a transport\npolicy including guidelines for private sector participation and for rationalizing the operations of\n\n\f27\n\nMPSRTC.    The  policy  will  aim  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  public  transportation  system,\ndecentralize and simplify the present permit system by delegating powers to district level, and\nfacilitate transport tariff setting.  Although the Motor Vehicles Act enables GMP to set tariffs for\ngoods  and  passenger  traffic,  the  government  does  not  regulate  goods  fares.    However,\npassenger  fares  (except  for  luxury  buses)  are  fixed  by  the  government  through  Cabinet\ndecision.    Tariffs  will  be  more  flexible  and  linked  to  changes  in  operational  costs  such  as\nwages,  diesel  fuel,  and  taxes.  In  view  of  the  higher  efficiency  of  private  sector  operators,\ndemand  for  transport  licenses  is  expected  to  increase,  thus  enhancing  competition  and\ngenerating  funds  for  improving  transport  services.    Given  the  large  size  of  the  state,  better\nservice  quality  and  improved  interconnectivity  will  benefit  particularly  the  more  remote,  rural\nareas and their link to urban centers.\n\nThe  cities  in  Madhya  Pradesh,  as  in  other  states,  are  facing  problems  relating  to\n92.\nunauthorized housing construction and growth of slums, and the existing legal provisions  are\ngenerally inadequate to mitigate them.  In the recent past, progress has been made particularly\nby the central Government in reforming laws and regulations governing housing development\nand  housing  finance.  The  main  legislative  obstacles  to  expansion  of  urban  housing\ndevelopment have been the ULCRA at the national level, and the rent control acts at the state\nlevel.  In March 1999, the Parliament approved the repeal of the ULCRA, which is expected to\nincrease  the  availability  of  urban  land  and  accelerate  land,  infrastructure,  and  housing\ndevelopment  in  urban  areas.    During  the  program  period,  GMP  will  prepare  and  enact  an\namendment to the state Rent Control Act, which balances the interests of tenant and landlord\nby requiring market-related pricing of rental property.  In particular, the amendment will include\nprovisions to exempt a portion of the rental housing markets from provisions of the Act, permit\nrent revisions based on market trends, and expedite the judicial process for dispute resolution.\nThe  Program  envisages  establishment  of  rent  tribunals  to  exercise  the  powers  of  appeals\nauthority in the state.\n\n93.\nThe  Program  contains  measures  to  mobilize  resources  for  the  housing  sector  and\nincrease  the  efficiency  of  service  delivery,  including  lowering  stamp  duty  to  promote\nsecuritization  of  loans  by  movable  and  immovable  properties  (para.  60),  and  eliminating\noverlapping operations of various state government bodies  and  restructuring,  corporatization,\nand subsequent phased divestment of the MP Housing Board (para. 79).  The policy measures\nunder  the  Program  are  not  only  expected  to  directly  attract  private  capital  into  the  housing\nsector,  but  also  to  indirectly  enhance  resource  availability  for  the  sector  by  ensuring  that  the\nstate has access to housing finance channeled  through  the  National  Housing  Bank,  Housing\nand  Urban  Development  Corporation,  and  Housing  Development  Finance  Corporation  under\nthe Bank\u2019s recent Housing Finance Project.34\n\n5.\n\nFinancial Implications of the Reform Program\n\nIn  addition  to  enhancing  resource  allocations  to  social  sectors,  the  implementation  of\n94.\nthe comprehensive reform program will involve substantial adjustment costs estimated at about\n$600 million during the period 1999-2002, as shown in Table 1.  Nonpersonnel outlays of the\nPSU  reform  accounts  for  about  half  of  the  total  cost.    A  further  $120  million  (20  percent)  is\n\n                                                       \n34 Under Loan Nos. 1549, 1550, and 1551, Housing Finance Project, for $300 million, approved on 25 September\n1997,  access  to  funds  is  limited  to  states  undertaking  reforms,  particularly  as  regards  rent  control  and  stamp\nduty.  The reform agenda of the Madhya Pradesh Program thus helps deepen the reform initiated under Bank's\nnational-level intervention, strengthen synergy effects, and thereby enhance the development impact.\n\n\f28\n\nrequired to cover the cost of voluntary retirement scheme and social safety net.  Further cost\ndetails are given in Appendix 8.\n\nTable 1: Financial Implications of the Reform Program\n($ million)         \n________________________________________________\n    Item\n________________________________________________\n\n          Cost\n\n           A.

Further resources could be mobilized through\nhigher  dividend  payment  of  the  remaining  PSUs;  reduced  reliance  of  PSUs  on  the  budget;\nproceeds from divestment as well as from asset sale (in case of companies to be closed); and\nimproved  cost  recovery  including  adjustment  in  transport  and  in  power  tariffs,  totaling  about\n$70 million annually.  Also, the liabilities to GMP ($112 million), which are costs associated with\nclosure and restructuring of PSUs, will not directly affect budgetary cash outflows, but will have\nan  impact  on  the  financing  of  the  fiscal  deficit.    Repayment  of  these  liabilities  to  the\ngovernment constitute a source of financing that, if written off, would require additional market\nborrowing at prevailing interest rates.\n\n96.\nThe counterpart funds generated from the Bank's disbursements will be used to cover\noutlays for mitigating the social impact of public enterprise reform as well as the funding for the\nProgram's  social  sector  interventions.    These  social  cost  and  expenditures  for  human\ndevelopment  comprise  inter  alia  outlays  amounting  to  the  equivalent  of  $250  million  for\nvoluntary  retirement  scheme  and  social  safety  net  (about  Rs5.2  billion);  rural  health  facilities\n(about  Rs2.5  billion);  increased  nonpersonnel  health  expenditures  (about  Rs2  billion);\nincreased  primary  education  expenditures  (about  Rs1.1  billion);  and  expansion  of  rural\nsanitation program (about Rs0.2 billion).\n\nD.\n\nSocial and Environmental Issues\n\n1.\n\nSocial Impact\n\n\f29\n\nMadhya Pradesh is facing severe resource and implementation constraints  that,  if  not\n97.\naddressed,  will  hamper  its  economic  prospects,  prevent  improvement  in  social  development\n(which  is  already  far  below  the  national  average),  and  adversely  affect  the  state\u2019s  overall\ndevelopment  process.    While  the  immediate  social  issues  associated  with  the  Program  will\narise through the restructuring of public enterprises, the medium-term issues will come out of\nthe fiscal consolidation process and include shifts in government expenditure and their impact\non  the  availability  of  social  services  and  infrastructure  as  well  as  investment  in  human\ndevelopment (Appendix 9).\n\n98.\nThe  Program\u2019s  macroeconomic  and  sector  reforms  are  expected  to  improve  resource\nmobilization,  and  lead  to  reallocation  and  prioritization  of  expenditure,  which  will  stimulate\nsaving and investment.  Coupled with dynamic gains through enhanced economic efficiency, in\nthe medium to long term the reform program will stimulate economic and social development,\ngenerate  employment,  and  reduce  poverty.  The  reduction  in  nonproductive  expenditure  and\nreallocation  to  social  services  and  infrastructure  will  improve  access  to  such  services.    An\nadditional synergy effect will be derived from the shift of resources to the health and education\nsectors,  which  will  contribute  to  human  development.  Certain  program  elements  may,  in\ntransition,  adversely  affect  the  economically  weaker  sections  of  society,  mainly  in  the\nadjustment in utility tariffs and rationalization of the sales tax rate schedule through withdrawal\nof  tax  exemptions.    Yet,  fiscal  consolidation  coupled  with  a  positive  supply  response  of  the\nreform program will generate more incomes and thereby mitigate the possibly adverse impact\nof  realigned  prices.    Moreover,  the  formulation  of  a  CIP  will  be  supplemented  by  the\npreparation  and  implementation  of  a  policy  on  resettlement  and  rehabilitation,  to  ensure  that\nthe  social  impact  on  people  displaced  as  a  result  of  such  projects  will  be  fully  taken  into\naccount and minimized.\n\n99.\nThe public enterprise reform program will involve the restructuring, merger, and closure\nof  PSUs,  which  may  lead  to  the  retirement  of  more  than  16,500  workers.    A  poverty  impact\nassessment  was  conducted  to  gauge  effects  of  the  public  sector  reform  on  the  poor.35  The\nassessment  provided  a  benchmark  for  the  preparation  of  a  comprehensive  social  safety  net\nthat  would  include  (i)  a  voluntary  retirement  scheme  as  part  of  the  State  Renewal  Fund36\nconsisting  of  a  monetary  compensation  package  for  retrenched  workers;  (ii)  measures  to\npromote access to social services such as housing, water and sanitation, health and nutrition,\nparticularly of vulnerable  groups,  and  measures  to  ensure  continued  access  to  education  for\nchildren  whose  education  may  be  negatively  affected  as  a  result  of  loss  of  employment  of\ndisplaced workers; (iii) training and self-employment or income-generating programs based on\na training needs assessment for the workers and their family members that is currently under\nway; and (iv) counseling  services and investment guidance to the affected groups on a need-\nbased  approach,  e.g.,  investment  options  for  the  voluntary  retirement  scheme  cash\ncompensation, promoting awareness of and access to credit programs for productive activities.\nGMP is also creating a committee to oversee the preparation and implementation of the social\nsafety net. The committee will be responsible for benefit monitoring of the assistance provided.\n\n                                                       \n35\n\nThis  has  involved  discussion  with  stakeholders  including  nongovernmental  organizations  and  trade  union\nrepresentatives. Dissemination of best practices, public information campaign, and stakeholder participation are\nalso integral aspects of the TA being provided to Madhya Pradesh (footnote 4).\n\n36 The Fund will be administered by an empowered committee chaired by the finance minister, with participation of\nthe ministers of Labor, Public Enterprises, and Commerce & Industries; secretary of Institutional Finance; and the\ndirector of the Technical Secretariat.\n\n\f30\n\n2.\n\nEnvironmental Impact\n\n100.\nThe  Program  is  anticipated  to  have  overall  a  significant  positive  effect  on  the\nenvironment, and includes specific policy measures to mitigate possible adverse environmental\nimpacts  associated  with  economic  growth.    Environmental  problems  in  Madhya  Pradesh\ninclude  deforestation,  soil  erosion,  air  and  water  pollution,  and  encroachment  of  agriculture\nand subsistence forestry.  Urban and industrial pollution is a  mounting  problem,  while  GMP\u2019s\ncapacity for efficient environmental management and monitoring is limited.  The Program is not\ndirectly related to these challenges.  However, it is part of a larger strategy of Bank operations,\nfocusing on higher growth and sustainable economic development.  The establishment of the\nMadhya  Pradesh  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  under  the  Program  is  expected  to\nintroduce rational pricing of energy, particularly for the agriculture sector.  Pricing of power will\nreduce wasteful use of two scarce resources: water and energy.  In addition, rationalization of\nwater pricing also will have environmental benefits by promoting judicious water usage.\n\n101.   Fiscal consolidation, reduction in  subsidies,  and  improved  cost  recovery  are  expected\nto  facilitate  more  prudent  management  of  natural  resources.  Growth-induced  income\ngeneration is likely to reduce the necessity for people to encroach on  fragile  land.    Improved\neducation can help raise awareness of the longer term benefits of  properly  managing  scarce\nnatural  resources.    This  awareness  may  raise  the  relative  priority  given  to  environmentally\nsound  projects  and  thus  may  be  reflected  in  the  state\u2019s  CIP.    Further  favorable  impact  is\nanticipated  from  the  improvement  in  efficiency  and  reduction  in  resource  use  as  part  of  the\nPSU  restructuring  program.    The  Technical  Secretariat  will  help  assess  the  environmental\nimpact of PSU reforms.\n\n102. Public finance reform and PSU restructuring are expected to have an indirect  positive\nimpact on the environment, but the Program also comprises specific measures to support the\nenvironmental  sustainability  of  economic  growth  and  industrial  development,  for  example,\nefficiency gains in natural resource utilization, and reduction of pollution and waste in several\nsectors  (industries,  water,  transport,  and  mining).    Furthermore,  the  adoption  of  a  state\nenvironment  policy  will  make  Madhya  Pradesh  the  first  state  in  the  country  to  adopt  an\nenvironmental policy consistent with the overall national agenda for sustainable development.\nThe  policy  will  actively  promote  market-based \nfor  natural  resource  and\nenvironmental management and it will require the formulation of a time-bound action plan for\ntheir  implementation.    Concurrently,  the  State  Pollution  Control  Board  will  be  strengthened\nthrough capacity building (for which Bank TA is envisaged) in key environmental areas such as\nhazardous, industrial, and solid waste management; environmental monitoring; and integrated\ntraining of industrial associations on pollution control.\n\ninstruments \n\nVI.\n\nTHE PROPOSED LOAN\n\nA.\n\nAmount of Loan and Source of Funds\n\n103. A loan of $250 million to India is proposed from the Bank\u2019s ordinary  capital  resources\nfor the proposed Program.  The loan will be utilized to cover the cost of structural adjustment\nof  public  enterprise  reform  including  outlays  associated  with  the  social  safety  net,  as  well  as\nfunding for the social sector interventions under the Program.\n\n\fB.\n\nInterest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n\n31\n\n104.\nThe  loan  will  carry  standard  terms  and  conditions  for  loans  from  ordinary  capital\nresources, with an amortization period of 15 years including a grace period of 3 years.  It will\ncarry  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s  pool-based  variable  lending\nrate system for US dollar loans,  and  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75  percent  per  annum.    The\nloan  proceeds  will  be  utilized  over  a  three-year  period  from  loan  effectiveness  to  finance\neligible expenditures, including those incurred within 180 days prior to loan effectiveness.\n\nC.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n105.\nThe  Finance  Department  of  GMP  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  coordinating  and\nmonitoring the Program, and administering the loan proceeds. The Finance Department will be\nsupported by:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe PRMC chaired by  the  chief  minister  to  advise  and  oversee  implementation\nof the reforms (empowered committees on public finance reform and on public\nenterprises  restructuring,  both  headed  by  the  chief  secretary,  with  high-level\nrepresentation  from  the  Finance,  Commercial  Taxes,  and  Public  Enterprises\nDepartment will support and report regularly to the PRMC), and\nthe  Technical  Secretariat \nrestructuring/divestment process of public enterprises reform.\n\ntechnical  aspects  of \n\nfor  guidance  on \n\nthe\n\n106. Capacity  building  and  institutional  strengthening  are  integral  components  of  the\nProgram, and are addressed in ongoing and proposed TA.\n\nD.\n\nProcurement\n\n107.\nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  utilized  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange  costs\n(excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced in, and procured from, the Bank\u2019s member\ncountries (other than those items specified as ineligible [Appendix 10]).  Contracts for eligible\nimports  will  be  awarded  either  through  normal  commercial  procurement  practices  and\nprocedures of the private sector or the prescribed procurement procedures of the Government\nacceptable to the Bank.\n\nE.\n\nDisbursement\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and\n108.\nRelated  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,37  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be\ndisbursed to the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required, if during each\nyear in which the proceeds of the loan are expected to be disbursed, the value of India\u2019s total\nimports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed\nunder other official development assistance are equal to or greater than the amount of the loan\n\n                                                       \n37 Board Paper R50-98. The Appraisal Mission verified the applicability of the formula for India.\n\n\f32\n\nexpected  to  be  disbursed  during  such  year.    The  Borrower  will,  however,  certify  with  each\nwithdrawal  request  its  compliance  with  this  formula.    Otherwise,  import  documentation  under\nexisting procedures will be required.\n\nLoan proceeds may be used for financing eligible imports for which expenditures were\n109.\nincurred  180  days  prior  to  the  date  the  loan  becomes  effective.    Retroactive  financing  is\njustified to ensure timely release of counterpart funds to the state government that has already\nincurred a part of the cost of structural adjustment because of prior fulfillment of the conditions\nof the program loan on tax reform.  The central Government as the Borrower and the GMP will\nmaintain  separate  accounts  and  records  for  the  loan  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting\nprinciples,  and  will  have  such  accounts  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  standards\nacceptable to the Bank.\n\nF.\n\nCounterpart Funds\n\nThe  rupee  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be\n110.\ntransferred by the Borrower to GMP. The counterpart proceeds will be treated as an addition to\nthe transfers allocated annually from the Borrower to GMP.  The counterpart funds will finance\noutlays  for  mitigating  the  social  impact  of  public  enterprise  reform  as  well  as  funding  for  the\nProgram's social sector interventions.\n\nG.\n\nMonitoring and Tranching\n\nThe  Program  will  be  implemented  over  a  three-year  period  from  loan  effectiveness.\n111.\nThe loan will be disbursed in three tranches to enable close monitoring of implementation.

The TA will assist in (i)  establishing  effective  institutional\nmechanisms for PSU restructuring/divestment, and  for  designing  and  implementing  the  SSN;\n(ii)  transfer  of  skills  on  implementing  PSU  reforms;  and  (iii)  improving  corporate  governance\nincluding strengthening of PSUs' accounting and information systems, thereby contributing to\nan  effective  implementation  of  components  of  sustainable  public  sector  reform  envisaged\nunder the Program.\n\n122.\nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $750,000  equivalent,  comprising  foreign\nexchange costs of $350,000 and $400,000 equivalent in local currency costs.    The  Bank  will\nfinance $600,000, on a grant basis from the Bank-funded TA program, and GMP will contribute\nthe  equivalent  of  $150,000  in  kind  for  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation  and  other\nfacilities, local transportation, and other services.  The outline terms of reference and its cost\nestimates are in Appendix 11.\n\nVIII.\n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA.\n\nBenefits\n\n123. Economic  and  structural  reforms.    An  important  benefit  of  the  Program  will  be  its\ncontribution to the success of the overall reform agenda.  The Program  is  designed  to  assist\nGMP in improving and sustaining the social and economic development of the state; reforming\nthe public sector; and evolving a conducive environment for private sector participation.  Fiscal\nreform  will  reduce  the  state\u2019s  budget  deficit,  improve  expenditure  prioritization  including\nreallocation  to  social  services,  and  improve  the  efficiency  and  equity  of  the  revenue  system.\nAs  the  resource  requirements  for  human  development  are  so  large,  domestic  resource\nmobilization  will  foster  sustainability  of  social  sector  interventions,  improve  their  quality,  and\nenable  expansion  in  their  coverage.  The  restructuring/divestment  and  closure  of  public\nenterprises  will  increase  the  productivity  and  efficiency  of  the  economy,  and  facilitate  the\nadoption of market-oriented business practices.  Further, the development and implementation\nof an enabling environment for  the  private  sector  will  create  a  level  playing  field  and  provide\nthe necessary assurance regarding the stability and transparency of policies and regulations.\nThis  in  turn  will  induce  private  investment,  counter  the  shortages  in  the  infrastructure  sector,\nand  thereby  help  remove  bottlenecks  to  future  economic  expansion.    Increased  efficiency  of\nresource  mobilization  and  improved  effectiveness  of  resource  use  will  facilitate  redirection  of\nfunds to social services.  Overall, timely and successful implementation of the reforms will set\nan example for other reform-oriented states to undertake such comprehensive reform program.\n\n124. Human  Development.    The  Program\u2019s  focus  on  fostering  social  development  and\neconomic growth is intended to reduce the  state\u2019s  severe  poverty,  and  to  raise  its  skill  base,\nand to improve on a sustainable basis the living conditions of its population.  Improved access\nto and delivery of social services, such as health and education, and a supporting social safety\nnet  will  directly  benefit  the  socially  and  economically  disadvantaged  and  vulnerable  groups.\nWhile benefiting the current population and its ability to generate income, the positive impact\non  the  state\u2019s  development  process  will  also  improve  the  population\u2019s  future  income  ability.\nThe Bank\u2019s support for human development in this state should have a catalytic effect in other\npoor states.\n\n\f36\n\nTransparency  and  institutional  capacity.    The  Program  supports  the  establishment\n125.\nand implementation of transparent policy and regulatory frameworks in infrastructure sectors to\ncreate  a  conducive  environment  for  private  sector  participation  and  crowding-in  of  private\ninvestment.    While  addressing  public  enterprise  restructuring  and  divestment,  the  Program\nalso  supports  improvement  in  corporate  governance,  including  increasing  PSUs\u2019  operational\nfreedom and enhancing management accountability for public enterprise performance.  TA is\nbeing  provided  to  assist  the  government  in  strengthening  its  capacity,  particularly  in  fiscal\nmanagement  and  expenditure  control,  and  in  restructuring  and  divestment  of  public\nenterprises.  Assistance is also provided for reviewing the policy and regulatory frameworks of\nhealth and education sectors, assessing the potential for improved cost recovery in social and\neconomic  services,  and  preparing  a  time-bound  plan  for  directing  further  resources  to  social\ninfrastructure.\n\nB.\n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\nThe principal underlying risks include (i) the limited experience and institutional capacity\n126.\nof  the  state  government  to  implement  comprehensive  reforms;  (ii)  the  adequacy  of\ncoordinating  mechanisms,  considering \nlarge  number  of  government  agencies,\ndepartments,  and  public  enterprises  involved  in  the  implementation  of  program  activities;  (iii)\nthe  potential  delay  of  divestments  due  to  market  conditions;  and  (iv)  the  fact  that  continued\nprogress  in  social  development  depends  on  financial  assistance  from  the  international  aid\ncommunity.\n\nthe \n\n127. Program  design  and  supporting  TA  have  been  prepared  with  a  view  to  mitigating\nassociated risks and providing safeguards for effective implementation.

Moreover, tax reform will focus on improved efficiency so\nthat enhanced revenues could be used to provide basic minimum social services to the poor.\nIn the long run, tax reform will lead to enhanced resource mobilization through broadening of tax base and increase in tax buoyancy, and\nimprove allocative efficiency and economic activity.\n\n\fTable A9.2: Public Expenditure Reforms and Expenditure Reallocation to Social Sectors\n\nChannel\nLabor Market\n\n\u2022  Employment freeze and\n\nType of Effect\nDirect                                                     Indirect                                             Macro                                            Non-poor\n\n\u2022  Core Investment Program\n(CIP) will protect capital\noutlays from ad hoc budgetary\ncuts and thereby ensure\nsustainable employment\nduring project implementation.\n\n\u2022  Structural changes in\n\n\u2022  Enhanced employment\n\nexpenditure and shift to\ncapital outlays is expected to\nfoster economic growth with\npositive employment effect.\n\nopportunities will help both\nthe poor and non-poor.\n\ncontracting out of services\nwould encourage informal\nsector and enhance wage\nflexibility.

The Program\u2019s emphasis on increased outlays for rural health facilities will help especially the poor.  As outlined above, the net\neffect of the policy on the poor will be positive.\nProgress in fiscal consolidation will enable provision of economic and social services on a sustainable basis.

The two ongoing TAs focus on  the\npolicy, regulatory, and institutional aspects of provision of social and economic services.\nThe strengthening of institutional capacity in reallocating resources to social sectors for\ntargeted  social  interventions  will  support  the  state  government's  effort  in  formulating  a\nsustainable development strategy to increase the standard of living in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe  TA  support  is  provided  to  both  state  and  local  levels  of  government.  The\n2. \nobjective of one is to improve development management by supporting the GMP's public\nfinance  reform  including  reform  of  tax  system  and  expenditure  prioritization  and\nmanagement, and institutional strengthening. 1  The other is providing assistance to the\nstate  government's  good  governance  initiative  through  decentralization  effort,  focusing\non enhancing resource mobilization capacities of urban and rural local bodies, improving\nand modernizing the information  gathering  and  processing for  rational decision  making\nat  state  and  local  levels,  and  strengthening  the  institutional  capacity  of  the  training\nfacilities for local bodies. 2\n\n1.       Capacity  Building  for  Development  Management  and  State  Public\n\nFinance Reform\n\n3. \nAt the state level, the Bank's technical assistance for sustainable economic and\nsocial development includes (i) structural reforms of the tax system and improvement in\ntax  administration;  (ii)  improvement  in  expenditure  prioritization  and  expenditure\nmanagement  and  control  systems;  (iii)  enhanced  transparency  of  the  institutional,\nregulatory, and procedural frameworks; and (iv) institutional strengthening and capacity\nbuilding \ntraining,  modernization  and  networking  of  administration,  and\ninstitutional setup for formulation and assessment of economic policy options.\n\nthrough \n\n  Activities \n\n4. \nSupport for reform of the tax system and tax administration focuses on improving\npublic resource mobilization to ensure sufficient and sustainable provision of social and\neconomic  services. \nfor  a\ncomprehensive  value-added  tax  system,  institutional  strengthening  of  the  sales  tax\nadministration including staff training to facilitate transformation of the existing sales tax\nsystem  to  value-added  tax;  establishment  of  valuation  cells  for  the  organizational\nimprovement of stamp  duty  and  registration; and  training of  staff  on  the  new  valuation\nsystem.\n\nformulation  of  a \n\nframework \n\ninclude \n\nthe \n\n5. \nAssistance for improving expenditure management and control, and expenditure\nprioritization  including  expenditure  reallocation  to  social  services  and  preparation  of  a\ncore  investment  program,  is  an  essential  part  of  the  Bank's  support  for  a  sustainable\ndevelopment strategy to improve basic human needs  in  Madhya Pradesh.

In  particular,  TA  in  the  education  sector\nfocuses  on  prioritizing  proposed  education  schemes,  reviewing  budget  allocation\nmechanisms,  proposing  norms  for  appropriate  pricing  of  services,  and  analyzing  the\ndeterminants of the  appropriate future  mix  between  the  public  and  private  provision  of\nsuch  services  and  the  necessary  regulatory  and  procedural  changes.    Reform  of  the\nhealth  sector  focuses  on  improvement  in  the  regulatory  and  policy  framework  for\neffective  management  of  service  delivery,  criteria  for  prioritization  of  budget  allocation\ntowards primary and preventative health care with maximum outreach of health services\nto  the  poor,  women  and  girls, and  tribal  communities, and assessment  of  the  potential\nfor  cost  recovery  in  the  sector  while  protecting  access  to  health  services  by  the  poor.\nThese  efforts  are  complemented  by  institutional  improvement  through  establishing  a\nstate  budgeting  and  fiscal  analysis  unit  to  provide  analytical  and  technical  support  for\npolicy making and through suitable training programs.\n\n6. \nThe Bank's assistance for human development through capacity building is being\nsupported by providing  training  of  staff  in  the  methodology  of  expenditure  prioritization\nand core investment program, strengthening the analytical capacity for budget planning\nand  monitoring  as  well  as  revenue  and  expenditure  analysis  and  projection,  and  in\ntraining  on  effective  audit,  accounting,  and  control  procedures.    For  long-term\nsustainability  of  capacity  upgrading,  close  attention  is  being  given  to  strengthening\ntraining facilities and to institutionalizing training, through establishing links to state-level\ninstitutions such as the State Academy of Administration. To promote private sector and\nstakeholder  participation,  workshops  are  being  held  to  discuss  topics  such  as  service\ndelivery in social sectors, pricing policy, and institutional and regulatory frameworks.\n\n2.\n\nInstitutional Strengthening of Urban and Rural Local Governments\n\n7. \nThe  support  for  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  of  urban  and\nrural  government  in  a  decentralized  democratic  setup  is  based  on  international\nexperience that the benefits of public provision of social and economic services will not\nbe  sustainable  unless  local  capacity  for  resource  mobilization,  effective  utilization,  and\nexpenditure  management  is  adequately  enhanced.    The  TA  therefore  assists  in  (i)\nstrengthening  the  resource  mobilization  capacities  of  local  bodies;  (ii)  improving  the\ninformation  system  at  the  district  level  to  facilitate  rational  decision  making  and  (iii)\nstrengthening training facilities for substate local bodies.\n\nFirst, capacity for management of  municipal finances  needs  to  be developed  to\n8. \nenable effective and sustainable devolution of fiscal responsibility to local governments.\nTo  this  effect,  the  scope  and  efficiency  of  local  resource  mobilization  efforts  are  being\nenhanced by reforming local taxes including property tax; appropriate pricing of services\non the basis of established standards of service delivery, and the contracting out of local\nservices  to  the  private  sector.    This  will  form  the  framework  for  the  Bank's  future\nintervention  through  its  urban  and  environmental  improvement  initiatives  to  ensure\nsustainability  of \nlocal\ngovernments.\n\nthe  resource  utilization  and  capacity  building  efforts  of \n\n9. \nSecond,  to  provide  direct  and  effective  assistance  to  the  rural  sector  (and  in\nparticular  the  rural  poor),  the  Bank  is  supporting  the  development  of  a  suitable\norganizational  structure  and  regulatory  framework  for  the  transfer  of  minor  irrigation\nprojects (i.e., projects up to 2,000 hectares) to local governments and their sustainable\noperation and maintenance.\n\n\fAppendix 11, page 3\n\n10. \nThird, Bank support focuses on facilitating rational decision making by identifying\nthe  information  requirements  for  effective  administration  and  management  at  the  local\nlevel,  developing  appropriate  information  systems,  and  upgrading  the  operating\nprocedures of the concerned state and district statistical offices.\n\nFinally, \n\nthe  TA \n\nincluding \n\nlocal  governments'\nis  providing  support \n11. \nimplementation  capacity, \nrepresentatives  and\ntraining \nadministrators of  local  bodies  by  developing,  adapting,  and  integrating  course  material\nfor  dissemination  through  distance  learning,  existing  training  institutes,  and  other\nsuitable  organizations.

The recruitment of\nconsultants will be based on simplified technical proposals.  It is estimated that a total of\n52  person-months  of  consultancy  services  will  be  required.    The  Bank  will  finance  10\nperson-months for  international  consultancy as  well  as 33  person-months  for  domestic\nconsultancy  services.  The  state  government  will  provide  the  services  of  an  expert  as\nhead  of  a  technical  secretariat  for  the  full  duration  of  the  public  enterprise  reform  and\nrestructuring process. The TA will be implemented over a nine-month period starting in\nFebruary 2000.  The Finance Department of the government of Madhya Pradesh will be\nthe Executing Agency for the TA.  The state government has set up the Public Resource\nManagement  Committee  chaired  by  the  chief  minister,  which  will  be  supported  by  the\nEmpowered  Committee  on  Public  Enterprises  Restructuring,  headed  by  the  chief\n\n\fAppendix 11, page 5\n\nsecretary, and by the Technical Secretariat on technical aspects of the restructuring and\ndivestment process.\n\n16.\nThe consultants will organize training seminars on all aspects of public enterprise\nreform to staff of the Department of Public Enterprise and the Technical Secretariat.  The\nconsultants will also prepare and organize, in consultation with the Executing Agency, a\nworkshop to expose policy makers, management of PSUs, and government agencies to\nnational  and  international  experience  on  restructuring/divestment  efforts.    For  the\nworkshop,  two  international  and  two  domestic  resource  persons  will  be  engaged  for  a\ntotal  of  one  person-month  to  share  their  experience  in  privatization,  enterprise\nrestructuring,  and  issues  of  corporate  governance.
