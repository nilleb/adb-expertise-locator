The state government\nhas formulated a comprehensive reform program including\nexpenditure reallocation to social services to foster human\ndevelopment.  Bank support will provide required technical\nand  financial  assistance  for  the  state  to  implement  its\nreforms. Although the immediate impact of Bank\u2019s support\nwill be at the state level, the Program will also enhance the\nadaptability and resilience of the Indian economy in general,\nand set an example that may accelerate the progress in\nother poor states.\n      Objectives The  Program  supports  the  Government  of  Madhya\n      and Scope Pradesh's  efforts  to  foster  social  development  and\nsustainable  economic  growth  by  addressing  prevailing\nresource  and  implementation  constraints  in  Madhya\nPradesh. The Program focuses on (i) enhancing resource\nallocation to  social  sectors  through  focused  social  sector\ninterventions  to  support  human  development;  (ii)\nimplementing  public  sector  reforms  including  capacity\nbuilding and institutional strengthening for improved fiscal\ncapabilities and management,  and  policy  and  operational\nframeworks for restructuring of public enterprises; and (iii)\npromoting  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector\nparticipation.   The Program will also assist in strengthening\nenvironmental management, and mitigating the social impact\nof economic development.", "ii\n      Classification Primary Objective:           Economic Growth\nSecondary Objective:      Human Development\n      Environmental Category C\n      Assessment Environmental  implications  of  the  proposed  policy  and\ninstitutional  reforms  were  reviewed,  and  appropriate\nenvironmental interventions have been incorporated.\nThe Bank Loan\n      Loan Amount A loan of $250 million is proposed from the ordinary capital\n      and Terms resources  at  standard  terms  for  program  loans:  an\namortization period of 15 years, including a grace period of 3\nyears; an interest rate determined in accordance with the\nBank\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar\nloans; and a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum.\n      Program Period The Program period will be three years from March 1999 to\n      and Tranching March 2002.  The proposed loan will be released in three\ntranches.  The first tranche, equivalent to $100 million, will\nbe  made  available  upon  loan  effectiveness.    The\ngovernment\u2019s  initial  policy  measures  began  before  Board\ncirculation of the proposed loan, fulfilling all the first tranche\nconditions. The second tranche, amounting to $75 million,\nwill  be  released  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with  the\nagreed conditions, expected by September 2000.  The final\ntranche  of  $75  million  will  be  released  upon  satisfactory\ncompliance with the agreed conditions as reflected in the\nPolicy Matrix.\n      Procurement Contracts for eligible imports will be awarded either through\nnormal commercial procurement practices and procedures of\nthe private sector or the prescribed procurement procedures\nof the Central Government acceptable to the Bank, and in\naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Simplification of\nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for\nProgram Loans. All goods to be financed out of the loan will\nbe produced and procured from member countries of the\nBank.\n      Disbursements The proceeds of the loan will be used to finance a broad\nrange of imports other than those specified in the negative\nlist.  To facilitate the timely release of funds to meet the\nadjustment costs, the loan proceeds may be used to finance\neligible expenditures incurred up to 180 days prior to the\ndate the loan became effective.", "iii\n      Executing Agency Finance Department of the Government of Madhya Pradesh\n      Counterpart Funds The  Borrower  will  transfer  the  rupee  counterpart  funds\ngenerated  by  the  loan  to  the  Government  of  Madhya\nPradesh for its use for identified purposes.  The counterpart\nfunds will be treated as an addition to the transfers allocated\nannually  from  the  Government  of  India  to  the  State\nGovernment.  The counterpart funds will finance outlays for\nmitigating the social impact of public enterprise reform as\nwell  as  the  funding  for  the  Program's  social  sector\ninterventions.\nTechnical In conjunction with the proposed loan, a TA will be provided\nAssistance for  Capacity  Building  for  Public  Enterprise  Reform  and\nSocial  Safety  Net  in  Madhya  Pradesh  to  complement\nongoing  technical  assistance  to  the  state  on  support  for\nsustainable  economic  and  social  development  and\ninstitutional strengthening.\nConsultants will be required for the TA and will be engaged\nin accordance with the  Bank's Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  the\nBank.\nRisks and A  number  of  factors  could  affect  implementation  of  the\nSafeguards Program.  A potential risk is the state government\u2019s limited\nexperience  and  institutional  capacity  to  implement\ncomprehensive  reforms.    Appropriate  advisory  technical\nsupport  is  being  provided  by  the  Bank,  including  for\nstrengthening  of  institutional  and  procedural  frameworks\nsuch  as  expenditure  management  and  control,  tax\nadministration, and statistical information system for rational\ndecision making at state and local government levels.  A\nTechnical  Secretariat  for  capacity  building  on  the\napproaches and modalities of restructuring and divestment\nof public sector undertakings is set up under the Program.\nThe  government  has  constituted  Steering  Committees  to\nfacilitate coordination of ongoing technical assistance.  The\nSteering Committees vet the consultants' recommendations,\nand act as effective interface between the consultant teams\nand government working groups. This will  strengthen  the\nownership of the reform agenda.\nAnother risk is the involvement of a large number of state\ngovernment agencies, departments, and public enterprises.\nTo  expedite  implementation  of  the  Program,  an  effective", "iv\ncoordination mechanism will be essential.  The government\nhas set up the Public  Resource  Management  Committee\nchaired by the Chief Minister, to advise and coordinate the\nreform program.  The Committee will be supported by an\nEmpowered Committee on Public Finance Reform and an\nEmpowered Committee on Public Enterprises Restructuring,\nboth  headed  by  the  Chief  Secretary  with  high-level\nrepresentation from key sector departments.\nThe reform of the public enterprise sector and improvement\nin  corporate  governance,  which  the  state  government  is\nimplementing, will improve the financial performance of the\nenterprises.  Yet, as experience has shown, the pace of\ndivestment of government shareholding is also dependent\non  prevailing market conditions. This could potentially delay\ndivestments.  However, the government has adopted a firm\npolicy of reforming public enterprises and is taking specific\nsteps  to  strengthen  technical  capacity  to  undertake\nrestructuring  and  divestment  of  public  enterprises  and  to\nassess all approaches and modalities for increasing private\nsector shareholding in these entities.\nFinally, in view of the tremendous resource requirement of\nthe state to alleviate poverty conditions, financial assistance\nfrom the international aid community is needed.  Enhanced\nresource flow would facilitate the state government\u2019s efforts\nto improve availability of social infrastructure and delivery of\nsocial services. The state government and the Bank jointly\norganized  a  workshop  on  Madhya  Pradesh  Development\nand Aid Coordination in April 1998 to present the Bank\u2019s\nProgram  to  the  international  community,  and  to  identify\nareas for possible financial and technical assistance.  As a\ntangible outcome of the aid coordination meeting, one of the\nbilateral donors has included Madhya Pradesh as a focal\nstate for future development assistance.", "I. THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to India for the Madhya Pradesh Public Resource Management Program.  The report also\ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  for  Public  Enterprise\nReform and Social Safety Net in Madhya Pradesh, and if the proposed loan is approved by the\nBoard, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, shall approve such technical\nassistance.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. The  Constitution  of  India  assigns  significant  responsibilities  for  delivery  of  social\nservices and economic policymaking and regulation to the federating states.  It is therefore\ncritical that the pace and direction of economic reforms at the state level reinforce policy\ninitiatives taken by the central Government.  Together, efforts at the national and subnational\nlevels increase the systemic flexibility and adaptability of the Indian economy to a changing\nexternal environment.\n3. While the Government has the capability of designing and sequencing reforms and can\nmobilize financial resources to absorb the associated costs, the states are not able to respond\nas actively.  State governments generally lack the capacity and resources to formulate and\nimplement  comprehensive  reforms.    These  technical  and  financial  constraints  are  more\npronounced in low-income and less-developed states like Madhya Pradesh, the largest and\none of the most populous states in India, with more than 40 percent of the population living\nbelow  poverty  line.    Without  assistance,  these  states  are  not  able  to  initiate  structural\nadjustment;  this  weakness  not  only  adversely  affects  their  own  social  and  economic\ndevelopment process, but also impacts on the sustainability of reforms at the national level.\nAs a result, the main policy challenge facing India is to accelerate states\u2019 reforms to enhance\neconomic efficiency and provide a sound basis for economic growth and social development.\n4. Taking  into  account  the  wider  focus  of  assistance  required,  and  the  need  for\nappropriate targeting of support within the country's federal structure, the Bank\u2019s operational\nstrategy for India in 1996 advocated increased lending and TA support at the subnational level.\nIn implementing this strategy, in December 1996 the Bank approved a loan to assist the public\nsector reform agenda of the government of Gujarat.1  In early 1997, a state selection mission\nvisited six states2 and proposed Madhya Pradesh for Bank support on the basis of criteria\nspecified in the Country Operational Strategy,3 including the willingness and commitment of the\ngovernment of Madhya Pradesh (GMP) to undertake structural reforms, and the state\u2019s sizable\nneeds for infrastructure and social development. Reflecting the large variations in development\nstages between Indian states, the Bank\u2019s subnational operations focus on entities with very\ndifferent  socioeconomic  characters:  unlike  Gujarat,  Madhya  Pradesh  is  among  the  least-\ndeveloped states, has wide gender gaps in access to economic resources and social services,\nand has still a primarily agriculture-based economy; and compared  with  Gujarat,  Madhya\nPradesh has high income poverty and a large minority population, implying the need for a\nstronger social dimension to Bank assistance.  With the Government of India\u2019s concurrence,\nGMP  and  the  Bank  developed  a  comprehensive  reform  agenda  to  be  supported  by  the\n                                                       \n1 Loan No. 1506-IND: Gujarat Public Sector Resource Management Program, for $250 million, approved on 18\nDecember 1996.\n2  Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu.\n3  STS: IND 96002: Country Operational Strategy Study, India, July 1996.", "2\nproposed loan.4 The Program addresses critical elements for sustainable reform at the state\nlevel: support for human development initiatives particularly in health and education sectors;\nimprovement in resource mobilization and efficiency of resource use through structural reform\nof the public finances and public enterprise restructuring; and implementation of a conducive\ninstitutional, policy, and regulatory framework for private sector participation.\n5. Reconnaissance,  consultation,  and  fact-finding  missions  were  fielded  between\nDecember 1997 and April 1998.  Appraisal of the program loan was undertaken 17-30 July\n1998, 5 followed by a contact mission fielded during 16-25 February 1999.  This report is based\non the missions' findings.  The program framework is shown in Appendix 1.  The outcome of\nthe various missions is reflected in the government\u2019s development policy letter and attached\npolicy matrix (Appendixes 2 and 3), which also express GMP\u2019s commitment and detail the\nnature and scope of the proposed reforms.\nIII. THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\nA. Recent Economic Performance and Prospects\n6. After growing strongly during 1991-1996, stimulated by domestic delicensing and the\nliberalization of the trade and external payments regimes, lower industrial activity and volatile\nagricultural production slowed the growth of India's economy to between 5 and 6 percent in\nFY1998 and FY1999.  This has been accompanied by higher inflation (particularly in consumer\nprices)  due  to  agricultural  supply  constraints,  more  rapid  monetary  expansion,  and  the\ndepreciation of the rupee in the wake of the financial crisis in the region.  Notwithstanding early\nsigns of a pickup in economic activity in the first half of 1999, the durability of the upturn is\nuncertain due to remaining structural impediments of the economy. Meanwhile, the external\ncurrent account deficit remained about constant at 1.2 percent of GDP during FY1997 to FY\n1999 as the decline in export growth was offset by lower imports reflecting sluggish industrial\nactivity and a sharp decline in petroleum imports in US dollar terms.  The international reserves\nposition  remained  comfortable,  boosted  by  capital  inflows  from  nonresident  Indians  and\ncontinued inflow of direct foreign investment, although portfolio investment declined in FY1998\nrelative to the previous year, and turned negative during most of FY1999.\n7. Following  early  improvement  in  the  central  Government's  public  finances  between\nFY1991 and FY1997, the fiscal deficit has since fluctuated at around 5-6 percent of gross\ndomestic product.  Lower than anticipated tax buoyancy, shortfalls in divestment proceeds,\nand  expenditure  pressure,  particularly  related  to  subsidies,  as  well  as  wage  adjustments\nresulting  from  the  implementation  of  the  Fifth  Pay  Commission,  have  prevented  further\nprogress  on  fiscal  consolidation.    For  FY2000,  the  central  Government  is  envisaging  a\nrenewed decline in the fiscal deficit from last year's 5.9 percent of GDP to 5.2 percent of GDP\n(using Reserve Bank of India definition), and at end-February 1999 has announced several\nrevenue enhancing measures including surcharge on individual and corporate income tax\nrates.  Lower than budgeted tax revenues and expenditure overruns so far this year, however,\n                                                       \n4  The Bank is presently providing TA in support of Madhya Pradesh's comprehensive reform for sustainability of\nthe economic and social development (see Appendix 11).  Ongoing TA support includes (i) TA No. 2943-IND:\nSupport for the Government of Madhya Pradesh Public Finance Reform and Institutional Strengthening, for\n$780,000, approved on 15 December 1997; and (ii) TA No. 2944-IND: Strengthening Local Government in\nMadhya Pradesh, for $700,000, approved on 15 December 1997.\n5  K.

Mitra, Social Development Specialist\nparticipated in the fact-finding/appraisal missions.", "3\nwill make achievement of the budget target difficult.  Meanwhile, the states\u2019 fiscal situation has\nremained very precarious, and continued budgetary pressures have adversely impacted on the\nstates\u2019  provision  of  economic  and  social  services.    Predictably,  the  poorest  states  have\nsuffered most.  Key economic and social indicators are shown in Appendix 4.\nB.  Issues in Economic Management and Sustainability of the Development Process\n8. Fiscal imbalances are posing a major challenge for macroeconomic management and\nthe sustainability of social and economic development.  Unless addressed, inadequate public\nsaving will affect the public sector\u2019s capacity to invest and to  complement  private  sector\ninvestment,  both  of  which  are  crucial  for  achieving  and  sustaining  high  rates  of  growth,\nfostering  social  development,  and  reducing  poverty.    Moreover,  in  the  absence  of  fiscal\nconsolidation, tighter monetary policy may be required to lower inflation, which could raise real\ninterest  rates,  dampen  investment,  and  increase  the  Government\u2019s  debt  service  burden.\nReversing the decline in public saving will require substantial improvement in the financial\nperformance  of  the  central  and  state  governments,  as  well  as  public  enterprises.\nConsideration must further be given to expenditure composition and the quality of adjustment\nto meet the longer term development requirements for social and physical infrastructure.\n9. Although part of the states\u2019 financing requirements are being met by central transfers,\nincluding loans and grants,6 and reliance on intergovernmental transfers may have somewhat\ndiscouraged  states\u2019  fiscal  discipline  and  delayed  the  recognition  of  the  need  for  reform,\nresource constraints are increasingly preventing subnational governments from providing the\nsocial and economic services which the Constitution assigned to them.  These constraints and\nadverse effects are more pronounced in the low-income and less-developed states.  This is not\nonly affecting their economic growth, but also hamper human development and prolong the\nexisting income and capability poverty of their population.\nC. Reform Agenda at the State Level\n10. The Indian Constitution gives the states considerable financial and economic autonomy\nto define their development priorities, and has entrusted them with the provision of economic\nand social services and the regulation of key infrastructure sectors.  Yet, in line with the\nnational focus on central development planning, which had prevailed for a considerable time,\nthe states\u2019 development strategy was mainly directed toward strong public sector involvement\nin social and economic activity, investment, and pricing.  A rather residual role was therefore\nassigned to private sector activities, and not much emphasis was given to the importance of a\nconducive institutional, policy, and regulatory environment for private sector participation.\n11. The availability of resources, particularly through intergovernmental transfers, enabled\nstates to invest in and initiate multifarious schemes without regard to expenditure priority,\nsustainability, or absorptive capacity. Projects were initiated but completion delayed, payment\nobligations incurred without full consideration of future debt service burden, and economic and\n                                                       \n6  States are receiving three different types of transfers from the Government: (i) statutory transfers, comprising the\ndevolution of tax revenues collected nationwide as well as certain grants, on the basis of Finance Commission\nrecommendations; (ii) loans and grants authorized by the Planning Commission for economic and social\ndevelopment expenditure; and (iii) discretionary transfers made by individual ministries out of their own plan\noutlays, as well as additional plan assistance for implementing externally aided projects. Bank assistance for the\nProgram will be treated as \u201cadditionality\u201d and provided to Madhya Pradesh through the central Government\nbudget in addition to all other transfers.", "4\nsocial services were provided without proper pricing and cost recovery.  The ensuing implicit\nand, in some cases, explicit subsidies, coupled with a certain lack of incentive to mobilize their\nown resources, worsened the states\u2019 public finances.  The growing fiscal imbalances reflected\na deteriorating quality of the deficit, as growth-inducing and socially productive investments\nwere gradually replaced by nonproductive expenditures.  This was compounded by a rising\nwage bill as a result of increased government employment and periodic wage adjustments,\nand higher interest obligations due to increased indebtedness at more market-determined\ninterest rates.  At the same time, stagnating revenues owing to low tax buoyancy and a decline\nin nontax revenues as a share of GDP did not provide sufficient additional resources to\nalleviate fiscal pressures.  Consequently, the consolidated current account balance of the\nstates shifted from a surplus of 1 percent of net state domestic product (SDP) during 1980-\n1987 to a deficit of about 0.8 percent of SDP a decade later; in continuation of this trend, the\ndeficit is likely to exceed 1.5 percent  of  SDP  in  FY1999.    In  addition,  the  financial  and\ninstitutional  weaknesses  at  the  subnational  level  are  hindering  the  provision  of  states\u2019\ninfrastructure and social services at a time when the reform process in India depends critically\non sustained efforts in key areas under the states\u2019 purview.\n12. For  the  states  to  adjust  to  the  new  development  focus  and  ensure  sustainable\neconomic and social development, reforms need to address (i) the changing composition of\npublic  expenditures  by  reducing  the  escalation  of  the  wage  bill,  lowering  subsidies,  and\ncurtailing the budgetary burden of public enterprises, while raising resource allocation for\nsocial services to enable maintaining and expanding human development  initiatives  on  a\nsustainable basis, taking into account the social cost of structural adjustment; (ii) enhancing\nresource mobilization through widening the tax base, improving efficiency of taxation and\nstrengthening tax administration, and enhancing cost recovery; and (iii) the policy, regulatory,\nand institutional regime of key sectors to establish a conducive environment for private sector\nparticipation.\nIV. THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH\nA. Background, Recent Performance, and Medium-Term Prospects\n13. Formed in 1956 and located in the center of India, Madhya Pradesh is the country\u2019s\nlargest state, covering 443,446 square kilometers: 13.5 percent of India\u2019s total geographic\narea.   More than one third of the state\u2019s 77 million people (1998) belong to socially and\neconomically disadvantaged groups consisting of scheduled tribes and scheduled castes, the\nhighest proportion in India (para. 33). Madhya Pradesh is still a predominantly agricultural state\nand, with a per capita annual income of Rs7,500 ($176), one of the poorest states in India.\n14. The state economy has shown robust economic growth averaging 4.4 percent since\nFY1981, accelerating to about 5 percent during 1990-1996. The contribution of the primary\nsector to SDP has gradually declined from 56 percent in FY1981 to about 40 percent at\npresent, while both industry and services sectors increased by 6 percentage points to 25\npercent and 33 percent, respectively. In particular, reflecting the state\u2019s rich natural resource\nendowment, industrial and mining activities are increasingly focusing on the processing of\nmanganese, iron ore, and coal.7  Notwithstanding the shift in sector composition, the sectoral\nstructure of the workforce continues to be heavily biased toward agriculture, which maintained\n                                                       \n7 This has resulted in serious environmental problems such as soil erosion, water pollution, degradation of forest,\nand air pollution.", "5\nits relative share of about 78 percent of total employment, while employment in the tertiary\nsector increased.  In view of the state\u2019s high population growth, per capita income (in constant\nprices) increased by only 1.8 percent per annum, about 30 percent below national average,\nand more than 40 percent of the population lives below poverty line.  Coupled with significant\nincome poverty, the state has very low social indicators, which despite some improvements,\nparticularly in education, are still far below the national average.\n15. The government\u2019s reforms focus on achieving medium-term sustainability of the public\nfinances while reallocating expenditure to meet basic human needs and facilitate development\nof social and physical infrastructure.  The economic prospects in the medium and longer term\ndepend critically on the effective and efficient implementation of the comprehensive reforms\nsupported by the Program.  Improving the allocative efficiency and establishing a conducive\nenvironment for private sector activity while removing policy and regulatory impediments and\nstrengthening  the  institutional  setup,  is  expected  to  stimulate  economic  growth,  enable\nprovision of basic services, and foster social development.\nB. Constraints and Issues\n16. The main constraints on the social and economic development in Madhya Pradesh are\n(i) the structural weaknesses of public finances including inefficiency in resource mobilization\nand ineffectiveness of resource use, and the resulting unsustainable pattern of expenditure; (ii)\ninefficiency  of  public  enterprises  performance;  (iii)  inadequacy  of  physical  infrastructure,\nparticularly in the power, roads, and housing sectors; and (iv) insufficient social development.\n1. Structural Weaknesses of Public Finances and Sustainable Fiscal Strategy\n17. Sound finances are critical for infrastructure development and the provision of social\nservices that are among the state\u2019s primary responsibilities.   During the 1980s, GMP had\nmaintained relatively high fiscal deficits (4-5 percent of SDP) and yet was able to contain its\ndebt burden, in part because of its ability to borrow at negative real interest rates.  In the wake\nof financial sector reforms in India and the tightening of central bank control over overdraft\nfacilities, the state\u2019s borrowing requirements were increasingly financed at market-determined\nrates, which substantially raised the interest burden.  Additional fiscal pressures resulted from\nwage adjustments, budget support for loss-incurring public sector undertakings (PSUs), and\nincreasing subsidies.  As tax revenues stagnated and central Government transfers to the\nstate declined, resource mobilization efforts were not sufficient to cover rising expenditures.\nThis resulted in a widening current account deficit, requiring the government to borrow for\ncurrent (\u201cconsumptive\u201d) expenditure rather than capital outlays.  To mitigate the impact on the\noverall deficit and government borrowing requirements, public investment was compressed.\nRecognizing these precarious fiscal trends, GMP started to implement a number of measures\n(including the abolition of vacant posts and a ban on recruitment of staff, consolidation of the\nmotor  vehicles  tax  system,  and  simplification  of  the  sales  tax  rate  schedule  and  tax\nassessment) and thereby managed to keep the fiscal deficit at about 3.5 percent of SDP\nthrough FY1996.  After that, however, fiscal pressures mounted, reflecting one-time factors as\nwell as inherent structural weaknesses in the public finances, and the deficit rose above 5\npercent of SDP (Appendix 5, Table A5.1).\n18. Stagnating  resource  mobilization.    The  state  receives  about  60  percent  of  its\nrevenues from its own tax and nontax receipts, while the remaining share comes from its share\nof national taxes plus central Government grants.  Almost one half of GMP\u2019s tax revenues", "6\naccrues from sales tax, which has generally high revenue buoyancy.  In Madhya Pradesh,\nhowever, sales tax revenues as a share of SDP remained stagnant owing to the narrow tax\nbase, complex rate schedule, and wide-ranging exemptions (particularly for industry) in the\nstate\u2019s industrial incentives scheme.  Meanwhile, GMP has made good progress in tapping the\npotential of the state excise duty, electricity duty, and motor vehicles tax, which together have\nyielded additional revenues equivalent to 1 percent of SDP since 1985.  In view of the already\nhigh tax burden compared with the national average, however, it is unlikely that additional\nrevenues can be mobilized from these sources.  Madhya Pradesh also relies more heavily than\nother states on nontax revenues (excluding Government grants), accounting for almost 20\npercent  of  total  receipts.    Nontax  revenues  consist  mainly  of  royalties  on  minerals  and\nrevenues from forest products, and reflect the state\u2019s natural resource endowment.  As royalty\nrates on major minerals are not under GMP\u2019s purview and are mostly specific rates rather than\nad valorem, and revenues from forest products are constrained by provisions in the Forest\nConservation Act, the state cannot rely on further resource mobilization from these sources.\nHowever, nontax revenue collection has also been adversely affected by low and declining\ncost  recovery  on  economic  and  social  services  and  inadequate  return  on  government\ninvestment particularly in PSUs; this trend needs to be reversed.\n19. Rise  in  revenue  expenditure  and  shift  in  expenditure  composition.    Current\nexpenditures have steadily increased due to (i) a rise in the wage bill reflecting cost-of-living\nadjustment and increase in public sector employment; (ii) the more than doubling in interest\npayment as a share of SDP; and (iii) rise in losses of PSUs including conversion of loans to\nequity through capital grants, and write-off of debt to cancel arrears on subsidy payment.  Due\nto resource constraints, the increase in expenditures resulted in a change in expenditure\ncomposition: public investment was compressed and outlays for operation and maintenance\nsqueezed, affecting both the expansion and maintenance of infrastructure and other capital\nassets; and resource availability for allocation to social services was limited, which otherwise\ncould have facilitated progress in the state\u2019s social development. The expenditure pressures\nwere exacerbated by weak budgeting procedures and insufficient budgetary control, resulting\nin  expenditure  overruns  and  lower  expenditure  efficiency.  Two  additional  factors  have\ncontributed to the recent surge in public expenditures and the rise in the level of outstanding\ndebt: (i) payment of accrued wage and pension obligations resulting from GMP\u2019s acceptance in\nearly  1998  of  recommendations  of  the  Fifth  Pay  Commission;  and  (ii)  outlays  for  the\nrehabilitation of Jabalpur, which was hit by an earthquake in 1997.\n20. Issues for a sustainable fiscal strategy. To formulate a sustainable fiscal strategy, the\nfollowing main issues will need to be addressed: (i) reallocating resources toward social and\nphysical infrastructure to foster human development and economic growth on a sustainable\nbasis;  (ii)  rationalizing  the  tax  system  and  strengthening  the  institutional  and  procedural\nframework to improve resource mobilization and allocative efficiency; (iii) adjusting prices of\nservices  to  enhance  cost  recovery  and  reduce  budgetary  subsidies,  and  implementing\nmechanisms  to  de-politicize  price  setting  and  improve  governance;  and  (iv)  reducing  the\nbudgetary burden of public enterprises and improving their operational efficiency.\n2. Inefficiency of Public Enterprises Performance\n21. Madhya Pradesh has 31 PSUs, set up under various legal frameworks, to achieve a\nmultiplicity of developmental, promotional, and commercial objectives.  The PSUs employ\nabout 134,000 people, or 10 percent of the state\u2019s total public sector work force (Appendix 6).\nThe government\u2019s total investment in PSUs amounted to Rs33 billion ($775 million) or 5.4", "7\npercent of SDP, with GMP holding 100 percent of equity in most of the enterprises. The\noperational and financial performance of the PSUs has been extremely weak: in FY1998, the\npublic enterprises sector (excluding the State Electricity Board [MPEB]) as a whole incurred\nafter-tax losses of Rs570 million or 0.1 percent of SDP, and has accumulated losses of more\nthan Rs5 billion (about 0.9 percent of SDP).  Dividend payments amounted to Rs47 million in\nFY1998, equivalent to only about 0.5 percent of the GMP\u2019s share in total paid-up capital.  In\ncontrast, the state budget bears a heavy burden as it underwrites losses of PSUs through\nbudgetary support for loans, grants or write-off of debt service payment, as well as equity\ninjection in PSUs and funding of their investment plans.8  Further budgetary implications may\nresult from providing loans without adequate evaluation of associated credit risks, as well as\ncontingent  liabilities  on  account  of  GMP  guarantees  for  PSUs\u2019  borrowing  from  financial\ninstitutions.  The reliance on budgetary support has shielded PSUs from changing market\nconditions,  and  perpetuated  their  lack  of  commercialization  and  susceptibility  to  political\ninterference and inadequate management decision, information, and control systems.\n22. In the absence of a policy on restructuring and divestment, the  state  government\napproached public enterprises reform on a case-by-case basis: GMP closed one enterprise\n(Madhya Pradesh Film Development Corporation); transferred a unit of the Madhya Pradesh\nState Industries Corporation to the private sector under management contract; and privatized\none of Madhya Pradesh State Textile Corporation\u2019s small processing mills.  Public enterprises\nreform was further constrained by (i) lack of an effective institutional mechanism for developing\nand implementing a PSU restructuring program; (ii) lack of focus on corporate governance\nissues; (iii) restrictive labor legislation that, as in other states, acted as barrier to restructuring\nby preventing downsizing of PSUs; and (iv) pressure on the public finances, which limited the\navailability of funds for financial and organizational restructuring of public enterprises and the\nprovision of an adequate social safety net.\n3. Inadequate Development of Physical Infrastructure\n23. In Madhya Pradesh, as in other states, infrastructure development and services have\ngenerally  been  provided  by  the  public  sector  because  of  their  positive  externalities,  the\nelement  of  monopoly  built  into  them,  and  their  usually  high  up-front  costs  and  long\namortization periods.9  The lack of long-term  financing,  as  well  as  investment  risks  from\nuncertainty about the regulatory framework including pricing policies for infrastructure services,\nhas also made it more difficult for private firms to enter the sector.  However, in the context of\ngrowing fiscal imbalances, the lack of adequate maintenance of public investment and the\ninability to expand the infrastructure network are hindering further economic development.\nMoreover,  Madhya  Pradesh\u2019s  strategic  location  in  the  center  of  the  country  implies  that\nstrengthening the state\u2019s basic infrastructure would have beneficial effects on the infrastructure\nof the national economy.\n24. The state\u2019s infrastructure base is underdeveloped and well below the national average\nas reflected in key infrastructure indicators as well as the composite Relative Infrastructure\nDevelopment Index (Appendix 4, Table A4.1).  Compared with all-India level of 100 in FY1994\nand the levels in more advanced states like Punjab (191), Tamil Nadu (144), and Gujarat\n(122), the index for Madhya Pradesh was 75: the lowest among the 17 larger states.  Although\n                                                       \n8  For example, budgetary support exceeded Rs4 billion in FY1995, while an additional Rs15 billion were provided\nin FY1997 for debt write-off and debt-equity conversion for MPEB.\n9 Formulation and implementation of state\u2019s infrastructure development policy is assigned to respective sector\nagencies/institutions such as the Department of Transport and Public Works Department.   ", "8\nthe index value increased from 62 to 75 between FY1981 and FY1994, with Madhya Pradesh\nbeing  one  of  only  three  states  (the  others  are  Orissa  and  Rajasthan)  showing  relative\nimprovement,  the  index  neither  reflects  the  deteriorating  quality  of  the  state\u2019s  existing\ninfrastructure nor the widening gap between infrastructure requirement and availability. Closing\nthe identified gaps in the power, roads, and urban sectors alone, would require additional\ninvestments in Madhya Pradesh of about Rs270 billion ($6.4 billion) or 44 percent of SDP,\nmore  than  20  times  actual  annual  capital  outlays,  which  far  exceeds  the  public  sector\u2019s\nresource  availability.    GMP  is  therefore  actively  seeking  private  sector  participation  in\ninfrastructure development, but needs to redirect its focus from case-by-case interventions to\nevolving a policy, institutional, and regulatory environment characterized by transparency, legal\nassurance, and political noninterference, and that will ensure a level playing field for private\nenterprises.\na. Power\n25. The state's power sector is managed and regulated by MPEB, the monopoly supplier of\nelectricity.  Total installed capacity of thermal and hydroelectric power as of March 1998 was\n3,814 megawatts (MW), with additional allocation of 1,773 MW from central sector power\nstations. The gap between electricity demand and available generation capacity is widening,\nand the present peak demand-supply gap is estimated to be about 1,300 MW.  Madhya\nPradesh has an extensive transmission and distribution network; however, the state\u2019s large\nsize and its population density make the cost per consumer of expanding the network among\nthe highest in India.\n26. The  financial  performance  of  MPEB  has  rapidly  deteriorated,  and  the  entity  is\nincreasingly relying on budgetary subsidies to achieve the 3 percent minimum rate of return on\nnet fixed assets stipulated in the Indian Electricity Supply Act.  The financial problems are\nmainly due to low tariffs for agriculture and domestic sectors, which together raise 11 percent\nof revenue while consuming almost 50 percent of the energy.  MPEB incurs annual losses of\nmore than Rs15 billion ($350 million) on account of sale of subsidized electricity to agricultural\nconsumers alone, of which it receives a subsidy of about Rs4 billion ($95 million) from GMP\nand  the  rest  through  cross-subsidization,  particularly  high  tariffs  on  industrial  customers.\nHowever, the subsidy from GMP has not always been given as cash and on time: in 1996,\nGMP adjusted Rs7.9 billion by writing off of its loans to MPEB and converted another Rs7\nbillion of its loans to equity in addition to a provision of Rs3.7 billion for subsidies in the\nFY1998 budget to clear the backlog of subsidy payment from the state budget to MPEB.  In\nthe context of worsening performance of the states\u2019 electricity boards, the Indian Parliament\npassed legislation in July 1998 to enable states to set up tariff and regulatory authorities.\nMoreover, to reduce pressure on the budget and lower cross-subsidization in the interim, with\neffect from 1 March 1999 power tariffs were raised by an average 18 percent, including on\nagricultural and domestic consumers, in addition to a substantial rise in fuel surcharge.\n27. MPEB\u2019s poor financial condition has adversely affected maintenance of existing assets\nand  limited  the  resources  availability  for  investment.  To  supplement  its  own  addition  to\ngeneration capacity, the state entered into memoranda of understanding with independent\npower  producers  through  noncompetitive  negotiation.    Power  purchase  agreements  were\nsigned with 16 independent power producers, of which 13 projects with total capacity of 5,356\nMW have so far received Central Electricity Authority techno-economic clearance.  However, in\nview of MPEB\u2019s financial situation, banks have assessed a maximum generation capacity of\nonly 2,561 MW as escrowable.  Moreover, due to legal and financial difficulties in finalizing the", "9\nagreements with independent power producers, it is likely that not even that amount of new\ngeneration capacity will come on stream.  There is thus an urgent need for a fundamental\nrestructuring of the power sector to improve operational performance, restore the sector's\nfinancial viability, and enable private sector participation to  ensure  adequate  and  reliable\npower supply.\nb. Roads and Road Transport\n28. Madhya Pradesh\u2019s large size and strategic location makes the development of an\nadequate road network critical for the overall quality of its infrastructure. Despite a road length\nof about 100,000 kilometers (km), the state\u2019s road density is very low and less than half the\nnational average.  Budgetary provisions are insufficient for proper maintenance of existing\nroads, leaving very little for expansion.  Guided by its overall development plan and the 1997\nStrategic Options Study, the government plans to expand and upgrade the high-density state\nhighway system, improve major district roads, and develop link roads to improve access to\nindustrial and mining centers and promote spatial development.  In view of the severity of\nresource limitations and the crucial importance of an adequate road network, the government\nhas embarked on a program to privatize road maintenance and to undertake road and bridge\nconstruction under build-operate-transfer schemes.  The legal framework is already in place to\nallow the private sector to levy tolls.  The Public Works Department has identified 37 roads for\nmaintenance under build-operate-transfer and so far invited tenders for 16 road stretches; a\ncontract for the improvement and maintenance of a state highway section has been awarded\non the basis of highest premium payment.10  In addition, during the last two years, 10 small\nbridges (total cost of Rs50 million) were built by private sector, and several other bridge\nprojects are under consideration.  Total annual revenue from toll tax/premium has reached\nRs250 million, about 10 percent of annual budget allocation for operation and maintenance,\nand is being used to maintain hitherto neglected stretches of the state's highway system.\nNotwithstanding, a general enabling framework for private sector participation in the roads\nsector is still lacking.\n29. Increasing  industrial  development,  the  inadequacy  of  alternative  modes  of\ntransportation (particularly limited railway connections) and the large geographic spread of the\nstate combined with low population density, place heavy demands on road transport services.\nWhile freight transport is mostly undertaken by the private sector, the State Road Transport\nCorporation (MPSRTC) is mostly involved in intercity and interstate travel.  MPSRTC has an\naging fleet of about 2,450 buses, of which only 1,650 are operational; consequently actual\noperations cover only about two thirds of MPSRTCs 1,318 authorized routes, which constitute\nabout 20 percent of total routes. The private sector, which can obtain permits to operate on all\nroutes within the state\u2019s total road network except on nationalized routes, runs more than 90\npercent of all commercial passenger transport vehicles, 75 percent of all buses, and 100\npercent of motor taxis and mini buses.  Although MPSRTC's fare has increased more than\nfourfold since the 1980s, inefficient operations and declining competitiveness has made the\nMPSRTC nonviable under present circumstances.\nc. Housing\n                                                       \n10 Earlier, in 1992, the Rau-Pithampur road in Madhya Pradesh became the first privately financed and constructed\ntoll road in India. However, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. was preselected to undertake\nconstruction in collaboration with the Madhya Pradesh State Industrial Development Corporation.", "10\n30. The state\u2019s population of 77 million is spread in about 71,000 villages and 465 towns.\nAlthough still one of the least urbanized states in the country, Madhya Pradesh is undergoing a\nstructural transformation from a predominantly rural to a more urbanized society.  While total\npopulation doubled between 1961 and 1991, the size of the urban population increased almost\nfourfold from 4.6 million to 15.3 million, raising the proportion of urban population to total\npopulation in the state from 14 percent to more than 23 percent (1991 census).  However,\ngiven severe resource constraints and a continuous decline in capital outlays, the state\u2019s urban\ninfrastructure is completely inadequate even to meet the present requirements.  In addition, the\nrapid population growth, poverty, and relatively low investment in housing development have\nworsened the shelter problem, resulting in steady growth of slums and informal settlements.\nThis has been exacerbated by provisions of the Rent Control Act, which have distorted the\nhousing rental market, and by problems of land acquisition under India\u2019s Land Acquisition Act\nand its Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act (ULCRA), which impose limits on ownership of\nvacant land within cities, regulate transfer of land, assign the power of acquisition of excess\nland to state governments, and prescribe maximum payment for land acquisition.\n31. As in other states, in Madhya Pradesh the implementation of the ULCRA has failed to\nfacilitate  the  acquisition  of  vacant  urban  lands  and  their  transfer  for  urban  development\nincluding housing.  Since enactment of the ULCRA in 1976, 7,000 hectares (ha) of land was\ndeclared surplus and about 5,100 ha was taken over by the state government, but in part due\nto protracted litigation only about 240 ha of surplus land  was  allotted  for  the  prescribed\nobjectives. The increase in demand for housing and the relatively slow supply response has\nwidened the demand-supply gap, estimated at 1.1 million housing units in urban areas alone\nby 1995.  If the projected additional demand for 770,000 new units during 1995-2001 becomes\nreality, the total housing backlog could reach 1.9 million units by 2001.  About 75 percent of\nthe  housing  would  be  required  for  economically  weaker  section  and  low-income  group\nhouseholds.11  Only about 25,000-30,000 units are added to the housing stock annually,\nmainly  due  to  the  paucity  of  financial  resources  of  government  and  semigovernmental\ninstitutions, but also reflecting the ineffectiveness of the institutional setup for the delivery of\nservices.\n4. Insufficient Social Development\n32. Demographic trends.  Madhya Pradesh, the largest and sixth most populous state in\nIndia, has low population density, with more than three fourths of the population living in rural\nareas.  Along with other poor states such as Bihar, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh (also known\nas the BIMARU [\"perpetually sickly\"] states), Madhya Pradesh ranks very low in all indicators\nreflected in the Human Development Index, such as per capita SDP, life expectancy, literacy,\naverage years of schooling, and infant mortality rates.12\n33. The state has a large concentration of socially and economically disadvantaged groups\nconsisting of scheduled tribes and scheduled castes, comprising 23 percent and 15 percent,\nrespectively, of the state\u2019s population compared with 8 percent and 17 percent, respectively,\nfor India as a whole.  Although scheduled tribes are present in all 45 districts13 of the state,\n                                                       \n11  According  to  Government  classification,  economically  weaker  section  are  households  with  monthly\nincomes below Rs2,500 ($59) and low-income group households those with monthly incomes between Rs2,500\nand Rs5,500 ($129).\n12  Madhya Pradesh was the first subnational entity in the world to prepare a Human Development Report in\n1995 as basis for increased focus on social development.  The second report was released in January 1999.\n13  In mid-1998, GMP approved the formation of 16 more districts to reduce their average size and strengthen\ndecentralized government.", "11\nthey are mainly concentrated in the eastern, southeastern, and southwestern parts; in six of\nthe districts, more than half of the population are tribal.  The literacy rates of scheduled castes\nand scheduled tribes are substantially below the statewide level, averaging 35 percent and 22\npercent respectively, and indicating large gender disparities of 21-32 percent (Appendix 4,\nTable A4.7), as well as significant disparity among different tribal groups.14\n34. Gender.   Gender analysis shows that women systematically lack access to basic\nsocial services, income and employment, physical security and safety, and participation in\npolitical and civil life. The gender ratio in the state reached 931 females per 1000 males in\n1991 (gender ratios among tribal communities are more even) reflecting systematic gender\nbias at all levels of society, in infant and child mortality, maternal health and mortality, life\nexpectancy, access to the means of production, employment, livelihoods, and incomes.15  Poor\nphysical access to health and education facilities compounds gender disadvantage in these\nareas. Women and girl children tend to get marginalized due to their low visibility for the\nservice providers and due to prevailing gender bias in the family and community.  Scheduled\ntribe/caste women suffer from an additional source of disadvantage, that of belonging to\nclearly demarcated disadvantaged social groups, which further limits their access to social\nservices  and  development  opportunities.    However,  there  are  indications  of  a  growing\nconsciousness amongst women particularly of their role in the political process. With the\nimplementation of the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, which provided constitutional\nstatus to village councils and urban local bodies as the basis for decentralized administration,\nrepresentation of women increased to about 184,000 members, more  than  the  one  third\nstipulated in the amendments. 16\n35. Poverty.  In Madhya Pradesh, more than 40 percent of the population is below the\npoverty line.  Low education and health standards adversely affect their potential contribution\nto economic activity.  Unless addressed, these material and physical deficiencies will not only\naffect the current population\u2019s ability to generate income, but also severely hamper the state\u2019s\ndevelopment process and thus the population\u2019s welfare in the future.  Efforts will need to be\nstrengthened to improve provision of and access to social services and facilities, particularly in\nrural areas.\na. Education\n36. Although considerable progress (albeit from a very low starting point) has been made such\nas doubling of the literacy rate among males and more than trebling among females during 1961-\n1991, 55 percent of the state\u2019s population are still illiterate, with significant regional and gender\ndifferences.  Among the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, 65 percent and 78 percent,\n                                                       \n14  In view of the high proportion of economically and socially weaker sections of population, GMP puts strong\nemphasis on their specific needs.  In the state\u2019s annual and five-year plans, funds are earmarked (in proportion to\ntheir  respective  share  in  state\u2019s  total  population)  and  placed  at  the  disposal  of  specialized  government\ndepartments to identify schemes/programs most suited for the welfare of these groups, and to allocate outlays\naccordingly.\n15  Yet, the state's female work participation rate is higher than the national average (32.7 percent in 1991\ncompared with 22.3 percent nationwide).  In rural areas, the rate exceeds 40 percent, and is even higher in tribal\nareas.\n16 Madhya Pradesh was the first state in India to hold elections for local self-government after implementation of\nthese constitutional amendments.  While this has led to increased representation of women, it remains important\nto translate this into effective capacity through training and conscientization.", "12\nrespectively, still remain illiterate.  Net enrollment ratios17 of 60-75 percent for primary and middle\nschool and a low transition rate from primary to secondary level, estimated at less than two thirds\nfor children enrolled in Grade I, are reflected in low mean years of schooling and point to very low\neducational development in the state.  Moreover, about 40 percent of the teachers in primary\neducation and one third in secondary school are untrained.  Inadequate facilities and poor quality of\nteaching are important causes of the state\u2019s low enrollment and high dropout rates.\n37.  Government spending on education amounted to about Rs27 billion in FY1999, equivalent\nto 19 percent of GMP\u2019s total expenditures and reflecting an average annual increase of more than\n5 percent in real terms since 1980, raising the expenditure ratio by one half to about 4 percent of\nSDP.   An increasing share in education outlays is directed toward primary education (almost 50\npercent), while a further 15 percent is allocated for secondary education, and about 10 percent for\nhigher education.  The remaining allocation is provided to the education sector as part of tribal\nwelfare, mainly for basic schooling.  Almost 95 percent of total 18 recurring expenditures on school\neducation in the state is spent on salaries of teachers and other staff; the remainder is used for all\nother items including scholarships, materials, and teacher training.  Reflecting the constitutionally\nassigned division of responsibility for education, GMP is financing more than 90 percent of all\neducation-related outlays. In view of resource constraints, GMP is encouraging the establishment of\nprivate  higher  education  institutions,  particularly  in  technical/professional  fields  and  medical\neducation, and on increasing cost recovery in higher education.  Steps have already been initiated\nto improve cost recovery: the government decided to transfer technical education institutions\nand medical colleges to autonomous nonprofit trusts, while permitting them to raise user\ncharges that can be utilized to fund the institutions\u2019 own improvements.19  Still, budgetary\nallocation and financing from other sources are insufficient to cover minimum requirements: for\nexample, the normative requirement for elementary education has been assessed at Rs20 billion,\nalmost absorbing the allocation for the whole education sector.  The resource gap would further\nwiden from FY2002 onward, when external assistance for the District Primary Education Program\n(DPEP), a multi-state project, ceases and GMP counterpart funding equivalent to the central\nGovernment share, i.e., 85 percent of the annual project cost, is required to sustain the program.\n38. To achieve the goal of universal primary education, GMP created the Rajiv Gandhi\nEducation Mission, which successfully mobilized external assistance to implement the DPEP in\n34 educationally deficient districts in Madhya Pradesh. The DPEP comprises improvement in\nexisting  school  facilities,  teacher  training,  development  of  locally  relevant  curricula,  and\nexpansion of facilities.  The DPEP is being implemented through village councils to promote\naccountability and minimize leakage.  It has created 11,000 new primary schools, 6,100 cluster\nresource centers (one for every 10-12 primary schools) to improve the quality of education in\nexisting primary schools, and 369 block resource centers to provide academic support to\nteachers.  As part of the Rajiv Gandhi Education Mission, in 1996 a mass contact program was\nundertaken to count the number of children not going to school, the facilities available at\nprimary school level, and the need for new schools.  The mass contact program revealed that\n                                                       \n17 While gross enrollment ratios, i.e., proportion of total number of children enrolled in the relevant level of\neducation to the total number of children in the relevant age group, are not age specific, net enrollment ratios are\nadjusted for the enrolled children of over- and under-age groups.\n18 Total recurrent expenditure comprises state government expenditures, expenditures incurred by local bodies,\nexpenditures financed by contribution from fees, endowments, etc.\n19 Fees in Government engineering colleges were increased in 1997 from Rs162 to Rs2,000 per annum, and added to a\ndevelopment fee of Rs7,500 per student per year.  Fees for medical colleges were raised from Rs600 to Rs12,000, and\nthe private sector is encouraged to open medical colleges, which may use medical facilities available in government\nhospitals for clinical training on payment of a fee of Rs20,000 per student.", "13\nofficial enrollment rates were grossly overstated and that numerous habitations in areas with\npredominant scheduled tribes and scheduled castes had no access to primary schools.\n39. On the basis of these findings, the government decided that, as first step to achieving\nuniversal primary education, it needed to focus on access.  To this end, the Rajiv Gandhi\nEducation Mission implemented the Education Guarantee Scheme,20 under which the local\ncommunity provides suitable facilities and identifies a local resident  with  prescribed  minimum\neducational qualification as teacher.  The state government provides funding for training and\nteacher\u2019s salary, and guarantees their availability within 90 days of a request from a community\nwithout a primary school, within a radius of 1 km, and with at least 40 pupils (in nontribal areas)\nor 25 pupils (in tribal areas).  The schools are managed entirely by the local communities. The\nscheme evoked an overwhelming response, and about 16,000 new primary schools were\nstarted in the state during the first year of its operation.  Reflecting the high level of community\ninvolvement, 88 percent of the new schools have been established in buildings provided by the\nlocal communities.  Through this initiative, GMP is achieving universalized access to primary\neducation.\nb. Health\n40. High mortality and morbidity conditions continue to prevail in Madhya Pradesh.  Despite\nprogress in improving the health status of its population, the state has still extremely low health\nindicators: highest crude death rate, the second highest infant mortality rate, and among the\nhighest morbidity prevalence rates of all states  in  the  country  (Appendix  4,  Table  A4.4).\nSubstantial differences between rural and urban areas and among socioeconomic groups also\nsuggest comparative underdevelopment and underutilization of rural health facilities as well as\ngender-based discrepancies in the accessibility of existing facilities.21  The poor health status\nof the population co-exists with abject poverty, high illiteracy rates especially among females\nand tribal people, and weak infrastructure for health care service delivery.\n41. In  rural  areas,  the  public  health  care  system  is  governed  by  central  Government\nguidelines suggesting a three-tiered structure consisting of sub health center, primary health\ncenter, and community health center as primary health care delivery institutions and  first\nreferral units.  District hospitals and hospitals attached to medical colleges located in urban\nareas are the secondary and tertiary health care delivery institutions for providing referral and\nmanagerial support to the primary institutions, while also providing primary health care for the\nurban community.  The guidelines prescribe norms for the coverage, equipment, and staffing\nof rural health facilities, although similar norms have not yet been issued for the urban health\ninfrastructure.  Following promulgation of the National Health Policy in 1983, and in an attempt\nto reverse the earlier bias in allocation toward higher level health care facilities, all states made\nefforts to expand the primary health care infrastructure under a central Government-funded\nnational minimum needs program.  In Madhya Pradesh, the number of community health\ncenters increased from 26 to 172 units, primary health centers from 465 to 1,181 units, and\n                                                       \n20The central Government budget for FY2000 is proposing to implement such a scheme nationwide, following the\nsuccessful initiative of the Madhya Pradesh government.\n21 Gender disparity is most obvious in child mortality risk: while the neonatal mortality risk of girls is 22 percent\nlower than for boys, the relative mortality risk by age five is more than 20 percent higher. Also, the relative\nmortality risk in rural areas is almost twice the risk in urban areas, and is further increasing based on the\neducational background of the mothers.  Similarly, there is gender inequality in the treatment-seeking behavior,\nas women have 25 percent less propensity to get inpatient treatment.  In view of the extremely low rate of\nhospitalization (4 percent of treated cases) in Madhya Pradesh, women are generally confined to ambulatory\ncare.", "14\nsub health centers from 5,486 to 11,910 units during the 1980s, although the number of higher\nlevel health care delivery institutions (e.g., medical colleges and district hospitals) remained\nunchanged.22  While making progress toward the national norms and covering the entire rural\npopulation, the state government has given inadequate consideration to the availability of\nbasic minimum facilities and staff.  Government statistics reveal that 50-70 percent of all\nprimary  health  care  facilities  is  still  without  a  building,  and  that  many  of  the  remaining\ninstitutions are in dilapidated condition.  Because of rudimentary infrastructure and facilities\nand inadequate staffing, the health care system remains grossly underutilized.23\n42. Total public and private per capita spending on medical care in the state amounted to\nabout Rs230 in 1993, 30 percent below the national average.  About one fourth of total health\nspending is covered by the public sector, mostly for preventive and promotive care. The\nremainder is borne by private households for curative primary care (46 percent) and secondary\nand tertiary facilities (27 percent).  Given their high morbidity rate, private health expenditures\ndisproportionately burden the poor.24  Efforts to expand access of health facilities for the poor\nand increased investment  for  preventive  health  care,  supply  of  clean  drinking  water  and\nimproved sanitation could yield considerable welfare gains.  At a time when demands on the\npublic health system are increasing, health sector expenditures have been under pressure.  In\nthe 1990s, public spending for health grew by more than 4 percent in real terms per annum,\nabove population growth, but somewhat below real SDP growth.  Resource allocation for rural\nhealth facilities remained at about 34 percent of total health expenditures, after increasing from\n18 percent in FY1981 to more than 31 percent by FY1991.  Yet, most of the additional\nspending was used to meet wage payments, accounting now for 80 percent of total health\nexpenditure,  while  capital  outlays  account  for  only  3  percent  of  the  total.    A  substantial\nacceleration of health care spending is thus needed to improve allocative efficiency, provide\nbetter service quality, and move toward minimum national standards of facility availability in\nthis sector.\n43. Madhya Pradesh has been providing economic and social services without proper cost\nrecovery.  As a result, the recovery rate for health services declined from 4 percent in FY1986\nto less than 2 percent a decade later.  This in part reflects the lack of incentive for hospitals to\ngenerate internal revenues as, under the present budgeting system, additional funds accrue to\nthe state budget rather than being used directly by the health institution for improving the\nquantity and quality of services.  To alleviate the budgetary constraint, the government in 1997\ntransferred medical colleges and tertiary hospitals to autonomous nonprofit trusts and formally\ndelinked  them  from  government  budgeting  process,  thereby  increasing  their  operational\nfreedom. GMP also permitted the formation of patient welfare societies to enable improved\ncost recovery of secondary hospitals by allowing them to use the resources raised locally for\ntheir service improvement.25\n                                                       \n22  In 1990-1998, the number of community health and sub health centers increased by 25 and 28 units,\nrespectively, while the number of primary health centers increased by 633 units, from 1,181 to 1,814 PHCs.\n23 The inadequacy of the health care system is also reflected in the low utilization of maternity and child health\nservices.  For example, only 30 percent of all deliveries are conducted under the supervision of trained medical\npersonnel, and prenatal and postnatal care is far below all-India average, contributing to the state\u2019s higher infant\nmortality and lower female life expectancy rates.\n24 Although per person expenditure on short-term morbidity are relatively constant across income groups, the higher\nmorbidity prevalence among the poor and the differences in per capita income leads to higher cost incidence for\nthe poor. By reducing the morbidity risk, e.g., through improved water supply/sanitation, pressure on the health\ncare delivery system could be alleviated.\n25  In 1996, the first year, Rs20 million (0.2 percent of health sector expenditure) was raised, of which 42\npercent was through donations. Expenditures included construction/maintenance of buildings (41 percent) and\npurchase of equipment and medicines (38 percent).", "15\nC. External Assistance to Madhya Pradesh\n44. Total external assistance to India averaged $3.5 billion annually during the last decade,\nof which two thirds was provided for national-level projects, a further 5 percent for multi-state\nprojects, and the remainder to individual states (Appendix 7).  Six states (Andhra Pradesh,\nGujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh) received the bulk of external\nfunding for state-level projects. Since the early 1990s, the central Government has treated\nexternal assistance to states as \u201cadditionality\u201d over the plan allocations (footnote 6), and\nencouraged them to secure assistance on the basis of their performance and absorptive\ncapacity.  The external assistance is channeled to larger states on the basis of a 70:30\nloan/grant ratio at a fixed interest rate.  The foreign exchange risk is borne by the central\nGovernment.  Reflecting the shifting focus of external assistance to subnational governments,\nthe share to individual states and for multistate projects has increased from 30 to 40 percent\nand from 5 to 10 percent, respectively, during 1995-1997.\n45. Madhya Pradesh, although accounting for 13.5 percent of the  geographic  area,  8\npercent of the population, and more than 5 percent of states\u2019 domestic product, has received\ncomparatively low levels of external assistance, averaging less than 0.5 percent of the total aid\nto India and about 1.5 percent of the external assistance support for projects in states.  During\n1986-1998, total commitments received by the state amounted to about $825 million, of which\nthe World Bank provided $400 million mainly for water management and social development.26\nIn view of the state\u2019s investment requirements for improved physical and social infrastructure\ndevelopment, the  low  share  of  external  assistance  directed  to  the  state  in  the  past  has\nwidened  the  gap  between  resource  requirements  and  availability.    However,  the  reform\nprocess at the national level and in few states has heightened GMP\u2019s awareness and led to a\nreassessment of the role of external assistance in the state\u2019s development strategy.  GMP is\nnow taking a more proactive approach through participation in aid coordination meetings,\ninvestment forums, and international trips to attract both official and private sector capital.  To\nimprove its capacity to absorb external aid, GMP set up a high-powered committee headed by\nthe chief secretary, and a project monitoring unit in the Finance Department\u2019s Institutional\nFinance Division for effective coordination and project implementation.  Madhya Pradesh was\nselected by the central Government as one of the first two states for implementation of the\nBank/World Bank-assisted Foreign Aid Management Information System.\nD. The Bank\u2019s Strategy and Lessons Learned\n46. The overall strategic objectives of Bank operations in India are to assist in achieving\nincreased economic efficiency and higher levels of sustainable economic growth to foster\nproductive employment and reduce poverty.  To realize these objectives, the Bank\u2019s program\nfor India focuses on alleviating infrastructure constraints by supporting the development of an\neffective  policy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  environment,  and  by  improving  infrastructure\navailability and quality of service; promoting upgrading and protection of the environment and\nresource base across sectors; and targeting social interventions to ensure sustainability of the\ndevelopment process.\n47. In view of the crucial role that Indian states play in the provision of infrastructure and\neconomic and social services, the Bank\u2019s strategy advocates a shift toward more interventions\nat the subnational level.  The main focus of the strategy will be to support and encourage\n                                                       \n26  Other multilateral and bilateral sources included the OECF, Overseas Development Agency, Organization\nof Petroleum Exporting Countries, European Union, and Danish International Development Assistance.", "16\nstates\u2019  efforts  to  improve  public  resources  management;  and  to  establish  an  enabling\nenvironment  for  enhanced  efficiency  of  public  sector  operations  and  increased  private\ninvestment in the economy.  The intervention at the subnational level  will  also  enable  a\ncatalytic impact on social development.  Bank support at the state  level  will  assist  in  (i)\nfostering development of social and physical infrastructure; (ii) broadening and deepening\nreforms that have lagged behind in areas under the purview of state governments; and (iii)\nmaximizing  synergy  of  the  Bank\u2019s  economic  and  sector  policy  dialogue  and  project\ninterventions. The strategy takes into account lessons learned from past operations in India,\nparticularly  the  importance  of  sound  development  management  and  appropriate  policy,\nregulatory and institutional environments for interventions to be successful.\n48. In  formulating  this  Program,  specific  attention  was  given  to  incorporating  lessons\nlearned from past, albeit limited,27 experience with interventions at the subnational level.  The\nlessons  indicate  that  capacity  building  and  institutional  strengthening  are  important  for  a\nsmooth and timely implementation as well as for sustaining the impact of policy reforms.  They\nalso point to the need for a more realistic time frame for implementation of reforms, particularly\nfor  restructuring  of  PSUs.    One  measure  adopted  in  the  Program  is  TA  support  for\nstrengthening the institutional setup and for capacity building at both the state and local levels,\nprior to program implementation and with continued support during the early implementation\nstage.  Another aspect of the Program is its emphasis on implementation of strong policy\nmeasures at the initial stage of reforms with clear focus on the key reform components, to\nbroad-base the reform process and to reflect government's commitment.  In addition, the\nadjustment program is formulated for implementation over a three-year program period in a\ncomprehensive but phased manner, allowing monitoring of milestone events and drawing\nlessons from implementation in the initial stage to improve subsequent actions.\n49. Experience from the Bank\u2019s intervention in Gujarat (footnote 1) also highlights the\ncrucial linkage between reform of public finances and power sector reform, particularly tariff\nrevision.  In view of the need to ensure an appropriate regulatory and pricing framework for the\npower  sector  at  an  early  stage  of  comprehensive  reforms,  the  Program  envisages  the\nestablishment  of  an  independent  electricity  regulatory  commission  and  includes  specific\nprovisions for tariff review.  Moreover, given the low socioeconomic status of Madhya Pradesh,\nthe Program specifically addresses policy interventions in social sector, social safety net, and\nreforms of cooperative institutions that have a bearing particularly on the rural economy and\nthe population living in rural areas.  The Bank\u2019s intervention in Gujarat also points to the\nimportance of regular monitoring and close interaction between the government and the Bank\nto assess progress in program implementation and to allow early identification of possible\nslippage in compliance.  Regular reporting and review missions will be scheduled to follow up\non the progress of reforms in Madhya Pradesh.\nV. THE PROGRAM\nA. Rationale\n50. India  achieved  unprecedented  strong  economic  growth  as  a  result  of  the\ncomprehensive stabilization and structural adjustment program implemented since the early\n1990s. Immediate beneficiaries of this rapid growth have been millions of inhabitants earning\n                                                       \n27 The World Bank has provided state-level support mainly for power sector reform, but in June 1998 provided\nseveral sector loans as part of an economic restructuring program for Andhra Pradesh, a state with significantly\nlower poverty incidence and about one third higher per capita SDP than Madhya Pradesh.", "17\non average less than a dollar a day. Underlying this performance are important structural\ntransformations: liberalization and opening up of the economy both to private sector and\ninternational  competition;  institutional  and  regulatory  reforms  in  the  financial  and  capital\nmarkets; and reforms of the tax system.  The Government\u2019s Ninth Plan (1997-2002) reflects\nIndia\u2019s main development objective of achieving and sustaining high rates of economic growth\nand  ensuring  that  growth  benefits  the  poor.  The  development  strategy  will  focus  on\ngovernment\u2019s role as facilitator of economic and social development and as a promoter of\nenabling policy, institutional, and regulatory environments; it will also provide overall direction\nfor further broadening and deepening of the reform process. Greater freedom will be given to\nstates not only to determine their own development priorities, but also to decide on modalities\nof government intervention and the provision of economic and social services.\n51. The increasing autonomy and responsibility of the states contrast sharply with their\nability to undertake reforms.  Although states play an important role in the development of the\ncountry and account for the bulk of expenditure on economic and social services, they lag\nbehind in the reform process.  Thus, state-level reforms need to be made to complement and\nreinforce  Government  policy  initiatives  and  to  strengthen  states\u2019  technical  and  financial\ncapabilities to address development challenges.  Among the key areas for state-level reforms\nare social services including education and public health and sanitation; consolidation of the\npublic  finances;  and  infrastructure  policies.    The  states\u2019  fiscal  situation  has  been  under\nincreasing pressure due to their weak revenue base and a shift from growth-inducing and\nsocially productive investments toward nonproductive spending such as interest obligations\nand  the  budgetary  burden  of  inefficient  public  enterprises.    Declining  development\nexpenditures  have  also  adversely  affected  the  existing  infrastructure,  which  increasingly\nhinders further development.  In the context of limited public sector resources and competing\ndemands on resource allocation, the impetus for improvement will lie in greater induction of\nprivate investment, necessitating an appropriate policy, institutional, and regulatory framework.\n52. The Bank\u2019s operational strategy focus and its emphasis on state-level reform provide\nthe general direction and parameters for Bank support.  Gujarat, one of the more progressive\nstates with a strong industrial basis, was identified as the first state for such Bank assistance.\nThe Program seeks to extend and deepen structural reforms at the subnational level, and to\npromote economic and social development.  However, large variations in development stages\nbetween Indian states require the Bank\u2019s subnational operations to focus on entities with very\ndifferent  socioeconomic  characters:  unlike  Gujarat,  Madhya  Pradesh  is  one  of  the  least-\ndeveloped states in India, has wide gender gaps in access to economic resources and social\nservices, and still has a primarily agriculture-based economy; and compared with Gujarat,\nMadhya Pradesh has high income poverty and a relatively large minority population, implying\nthe need for a stronger social dimension to Bank assistance.\n53. Limited resources and implementation capabilities hinder the development process and\nheighten the challenge faced by GMP.  Given the existing poverty in terms of both material\nwealth and capabilities, delay in addressing and overcoming these development challenges\nwill have an adverse impact on the state\u2019s future economic growth and social development.  It\nmay also prevent the state from responding to central Government policy initiatives and limit\nthe benefit the country could otherwise derive from mutually supportive reforms. GMP has\nalready initiated reforms on a selective basis, including private sector participation in road and\ntransport  sectors  and  in  tax  reform,  and  has  taken  innovative  initiatives  for  human\ndevelopment.  The state is off to a good start, which indicates GMP\u2019s commitment to face the", "18\ndevelopment challenges.  Bank support will facilitate implementation of GMP\u2019s reform program\nand provide a strong example for other struggling, but reform-oriented states.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n54. The objective of the Bank\u2019s program is to support the government's reform efforts to\nfoster social development and sustainable economic growth by addressing prevailing resource\nand  implementation  constraints  in  Madhya  Pradesh,  focusing  on  (i)  enhancing  resource\nallocation to social sectors to support human development; (ii) improving public finances and\nfiscal capabilities and management, and fostering allocative efficiency through reform of public\nenterprises  including  corporate  governance  reform;  and  (iii)  strengthening  the  policy,\nregulatory, and institutional frameworks for private sector participation in key sectors. The\nProgram will also assist in strengthening environmental management, and mitigate the social\nimpact of economic development.\nC. Policy Framework and Actions\n55. To  address  resource  and  implementation  constraints  and  to  improve  resource\nmanagement for sustainable social and economic development, the Program will assist in\nimplementing public sector reforms, including capacity building and institutional strengthening\nfor improved fiscal management; strengthening revenue mobilization, curtailing nonproductive\nexpenditure, and reallocating resources to social services, particularly health and education;\nimproving  allocative  efficiency  through  reform  of  PSUs;  and  establishing  transparent\norganizational and incentive structures for enhanced private sector participation.    \n1. Capacity  Building  and  Institutional  Strengthening  for  Improved  Fiscal\nManagement and Sustainable Public Finances\n56. In accordance with the Program, in January 1998 the Government set up a Public\nResource Management Committee (PRMC) under the chief minister to advise and oversee\nimplementation  of  the  state\u2019s  reform  program.    The  PRMC  is  supported  by  empowered\ncommittees on public finance reform and on public enterprises restructuring, both headed by\nthe  chief  secretary  with  high-level  representation  from  key  sector  departments,  to\nsystematically review and implement public finance and public enterprise reform in the state.\nThe PRMC will also guide the establishment of an enabling environment and the respective\npolicy, institutional, and regulatory issues.\n57. Corrective measures need to be taken to address both the revenue as well as the\nexpenditure side of public finance within a medium-term fiscal reform program.  Some of the\nrevenue measures are expected to lead to short-term losses but yield significant benefits in the\nmedium term.  The Program therefore advocates properly sequenced policies supplemented\nby compensatory measures to offset adverse fiscal impacts to the extent possible.  The reform\nof public finances will focus on restructuring of the state\u2019s tax system to improve its efficiency\nand equity; rationalizing and prioritizing expenditure; supporting the reallocation of resources to\nsocial  services,  particularly  health  and  education;  enhancing  the  economic  management\ncapacity; and strengthening the institutional framework.\n58. In line with the Program, the government's fiscal strategy reflected in the medium-term\nfiscal framework (MTFF) aims to (i) attenuate the accumulation of public debt during the\ntransition period so as to stabilize the debt-SDP ratio over the medium term; (ii) consolidate the", "19\npublic finances by reducing nonproductive expenditure while reallocating resources to social\nservices and for public investment; and (iii) improve the \u201cquality\u201d of the fiscal balance by\nfocusing on the composition of fiscal adjustment.  To this end, the MTFF envisages a reduction\nin the primary fiscal deficit (defined as current revenue minus total expenditure net of interest\nexpenditure)  from  estimated  2.6  percent  (budgeted  3.4  percent,  including  supplementary\nbudget)  of  SDP  in  FY1999  to  0.2  percent  by  FY2003  (Appendix  5,  Table  A5.2).    The\nprogrammed  reduction  will  help  contain  current  expenditure  by  reducing  nonproductive\nexpenditure,  particularly  subsidies.    It  will  also  ease  pressure  on  the  wage  bill  through\nemployment policy measures such as limiting state government employment, shifting posts to\nessential social services, and evolving a more flexible wage policy, particularly for local bodies\nthat need to be strengthened for more effective decentralization. The fiscal program will also\nreverse the compression of capital outlays and support an expansion of public investment.\nIncreased resource mobilization will result over the medium term through improvement in\nbuoyancy  of  the  value-added  tax,  stamp  duty,  and  property  tax;  28  strengthening  of  tax\nadministration; and improvement in cost recovery.  The fiscal program will fully absorb the\nimpact  of  the  substantive  adjustment  costs  associated  with  structural  reforms  of  the  tax\nsystem, the restructuring of the public enterprises, and outlays to mitigate social impact of the\nadjustment program (para. 94).  To provide institutional support to the implementation of the\nMTFF, a state budgeting and fiscal analysis unit will be established in the Finance Department\nfor improved budget planning, monitoring, and economic policy analysis.\na. Tax and Nontax Revenue Measures\n59. Madhya Pradesh has made progress in its reform of the sales tax system: the number\nof rate categories was cut from 17 to six, and a self-assessment system for small dealers was\nput in place to reduce the administrative burden of tax audit.  Nonetheless, financial and\ntechnical limitations prevented implementation of comprehensive tax reforms, and distortions\nsuch as the cascading effect of input taxation, narrow tax base, complex multiple tax rate\nstructure, and weak tax administration remain. Cognizant of these constraints, the government\nwill (i) further rationalize the sales  tax  structure,  (ii)  widen  the  tax  base  by  reducing  tax\nexemptions and limiting the coverage of the industrial incentives scheme, and (iii) introduce in\na  phased  manner  value-added  tax.    Strengthening  tax  administration  and  improving\nmanagement information systems will provide institutional backup for these reforms.  The\nremoval of input taxation will lead in the transition period to revenue losses anticipated at\nabout  $170  million  equivalent  (para.  94).    However,  the  widening  of  the  tax  base  and\nenhanced tax compliance fostered by strengthened tax administration will improve revenue\nbuoyancy in the medium term.\n60. In  line  with  recommendations  of  the  1996  and  1997  committees  of  state  finance\nministers,  the  government  plans  to  reform  the  stamp  duty  and  property  tax  systems  by\nlowering the stamp duty rate, particularly on conveyances, rationalizing and standardizing rates\nof financial and capital markets instruments including mortgages and transactions relating to\nsecuritization,29 modernizing stamp duty administration, and setting up valuation cells. The\nreduction in duty rates is expected to reduce initial revenues by about $16 million equivalent.\nThrough  strengthening  of  the  institutional  and  operational  framework,  particularly  the\n                                                       \n28 These taxes mobilize the bulk of the state\u2019s tax revenues (sales tax and stamp duty alone raise more than one\nhalf of state's tax revenues), while property tax accounts for about 30 percent of urban local bodies\u2019 revenue\nbase.\n29  The lowering of stamp duty on instruments relating to securitization will directly benefit the Program\u2019s\nintervention and objective in the housing sector (para. 93).", "20\nestablishment of central and regional valuation cells and revision of valuation methodology and\nguidelines, the revenue  buoyancy  of  these  taxes  will  be  raised  and  additional  resources\nmobilized.  Given that property tax is an important source of revenue for urban local bodies,\nthe introduction of simple, transparent, and criteria-based system of property assessment will\nalso help strengthen the fiscal position of local governments and enable them to improve their\ndelivery of social and economic services.\n61. Nontax revenue enhancement will be supported under the Program inter alia through\nbetter  cost  recovery  in  economic  and  social  services,  establishment  of  tariff  regulatory\nframeworks including the setting up of a State Electricity Regulatory Commission and a utilities\npricing commission, and higher return on state's investment in public enterprises.\nb. Expenditure Management\n62. In parallel with structural revenue measures, the government plans to rationalize and\nprioritize expenditure and to strengthen expenditure management and control systems.  In the\ncontext of the MTFF (para. 58), a change in composition of expenditure and containment of\noverall expenditures are envisaged.  Particular emphasis will be on reallocation of resources to\nimprove delivery of social services, augment social infrastructure, and ensure sustainability of\nongoing government initiatives. The Program\u2019s support for improved resource management by\nsuch means will foster social development in the state.\n63. The recent recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission have raised significantly the\nfiscal burden and will substantially worsen the medium-term outlook of states\u2019 public finances,\nunless  decisively  addressed.    GMP  therefore  puts  high  priority  on  containing  current\nexpenditures, for example by cutting nonproductive outlays and limiting state government\nemployment.  Specific measures will include (i) prohibiting absorption of PSU employees into\ngovernment service and prohibiting regularization of temporary workers into public service and\nPSUs; (ii) allowing different wage scales to prevail at the state and local levels and in PSUs;\nand  (iii)  establishing  a  regulatory  framework  for  electricity  tariff  adjustment,  including  a\ntimeframe  for  announcement  of  the  first  general  tariff  revision.    The  government  is  also\ncontemplating reducing staff (other than technical positions in essential social services and\npolice)  through  natural  attrition,  and  reallocating  the  resources  to  social  services.  These\nmeasures will directly reduce revenue expenditures.  Making wages more flexible will also\nstrengthen financial sustainability, particularly of local bodies and of public enterprises, by de-\nlinking wage setting.30\n 64. Enabling private sector participation, investment by the public sector, and improvement\nin the basic social and physical infrastructure necessitates increased capital outlays.  Under\nthe  Program\u2019s  MTFF,  improved  resource  mobilization  is  expected  to  make  this  possible.\nFurthermore, the government is preparing a core investment program (CIP) to prioritize the use\nof its overall development expenditures.  The CIP will protect the high-priority projects from ad\nhoc budgetary cuts, which should enable more timely project implementation and avoid cost\noverrun and thin spreading of scarce budgetary resources.  Developing the CIP will involve a\n                                                       \n30 As the states follow central Government pay scale adjustment, and PSUs as well as local bodies generally follow\nthe state governments, all salary scales are de facto linked to one another.  In view of the declining capacity for\nown resource mobilization at lower levels, pressure on the sustainability of their financial situation increases and,\nin the absence of offsetting transfers, will erode profitability (in the case of PSUs) or service delivery (in the case\nof local governments).  Declining quality in service delivery would adversely and disproportionately affect the\npoorer section of the population, particularly in rural areas.", "21\ncomprehensive review of the project pipeline of all sectors, closure of nonperforming projects,\ntransfer to private sector if projects could be implemented there more efficiently, and greater\nemphasis on projects under external assistance.\n65. The  structural  improvement  in  expenditures  can  only  be  sustained  if  expenditure\nmanagement and control systems are improved.  To this end, the Program will support the\ngovernment\u2019s effort to strengthen the Finance Department\u2019s  treasury  operations,  increase\neffectiveness and efficiency of the payment and audit systems, and develop a management\ninformation  system  to  provide  updated  and  adequate  information  on  all  relevant  budget\nvariables.  This will enable the Finance Department and concerned decision-making authorities\nto  regularly  assess  the  status  of  budget  implementation  and  compliance  with  the  fiscal\nconsolidation  efforts  under  the  MTFF,  allow  early  identification  of  possible  expenditure\noverruns  as  well  as  redirection  of  funds  toward  nonpriority  areas,  and  facilitate  the\ngovernment\u2019s cash management.  Better liquidity management, coupled with the strengthening\nof the Finance Department\u2019s debt management capability, will enable GMP  to  reduce  its\ninterest obligations at the margin and, more importantly, could help smooth interest fluctuations\nin the short-term money and financial markets.  Moreover, setting up a state budgeting and\nfiscal analysis unit will reduce the government\u2019s reliance on supplementary budgets, increase\ntransparency of the annual budgeting exercise, and strengthen the role of the budget as an\ninstrument for rational economic policy making.\n2. Reallocation of Expenditures to Social Services\n66. GMP is committed to reallocating resources to social sectors, especially health and\neducation.  Under the Program, GMP will also prepare and implement a plan to ensure that the\npresent social sector outlays are protected from budgetary cuts, and indicate how the state\u2019s\ncurrent status in social indicators well below national norms could be redressed over time.\na. Education Sector\n67. Policy priorities in the education sector include (i) universalization of primary education\nand improvement in the quality of teaching; (ii) strengthening other levels of the education\nsystem within given budget constraints; and (iii) increasing local government involvement in the\neducation system through financial and management decentralization, particularly for primary\neducation.  GMP is committed to reviewing the policy, institutional, and regulatory frameworks\nof  the  education  sector;  to  setting  up  nonprofit  autonomous  institutions;  and  to  further\nanalyzing possibilities for strengthening the resource base through enhanced cost recovery,\nespecially  at  the  postsecondary  level.    Under  the  Program,  the  government  will  prepare\nprioritized investment plans for the education sector, which are to be fully integrated into the\nstate\u2019s CIP. An action plan will also be formulated outlining feasible steps to move toward the\nnational norms in expenditure on educational facilities, training, material, etc.  In the meantime,\nthe Government will protect outlays for education from ad hoc budgetary cuts while raising\nresource allocation within the medium-term fiscal framework.\n68. As  noted  in  para.  37,  Madhya  Pradesh  is  availing  itself  of  assistance  under  the\nexternally  funded  DPEP.    The  government  is  committed  to  ensuring  continuation  of  this\nprogram after external funding support ceases.  From FY2002 onward, GMP will assume full\nfinancing  responsibility  by  making  budgetary  provisions  equivalent  to  the  present  central\nGovernment share, i.e., 85 percent of the annual recurrent project cost.  This will ensure", "22\nfunding availability for continuation of DPEP and promote sustainability of ongoing efforts to\nimprove primary education in the state.\n        b. Health Sector\n69. GMP will strengthen the state\u2019s health care system by increasing allocation for primary\nhealth  care  delivery  institutions,  and  by  enhancing  the  capacity  and  efficiency  of  district\nhospitals through increased recovery of cost of services.  It  will also promote community\ninvolvement in health care through the village councils.  To improve health care in rural areas,\nunder the Program the annual budget provision will be increased to eliminate the investment\nbacklog on existing rural health facilities, estimated at Rs2.5 billion, over the medium term.\nGMP is committed to raising allocation for nonpersonnel inputs (e.g., drugs and equipment) to\ncover the shortfall in recurrent spending on existing facilities.31  Improvement in the quality of\nhealth service delivery will also require increased staffing of primary health facilities.  In view of\nthe overall budget constraint and the disproportionate share of funding going for wages and\nsalaries, the Program focus will be on reassigning posts already in government departments to\nsocial services.  In particular, during the program period, government staff other than those in\ntechnical positions in essential social services and police will be reduced through natural\nattrition, and the resources associated with these posts shifted to social services.\n70. GMP  will  extend  its  rural  sanitation  program  focusing  on  the  control  of  diarrheal\ndiseases, so far launched in 11,000 problem villages, to all 71,000 villages of the state.  The\nfocus  on  sanitation  education,  promotion  of  water  testing  kits,  and  distribution  of  oral\nrehydration salts, is expected to reduce fatalities from waterborne diseases, which are a major\ncause of the state\u2019s high infant mortality rate.  As poor people are more affected by short-term\nmorbidity and spend a relatively large share of their income on treatment, this measure will\nalso have a beneficial poverty-reducing effect.\n71. Further, GMP is preparing an action plan with Bank TA for protecting social sector\noutlays from ad hoc budgetary cuts, ensuring that investment spending is fully integrated into\nthe overall CIP, and for moving toward national norms on health infrastructure and health\nservice delivery. The government plans to strengthen the legal arrangements for the autonomy\nof secondary and tertiary institutions, to foster public-private partnership, and particularly to\nenable these independent trusts to price their services accurately and determine  the  fee\nstructure considering varying abilities to pay.  The costing of services and health budgeting will\nbe analyzed as part of the action plan.\n3.  Public Enterprise Reform\n72. The Program supports reform of public enterprises in two distinct, albeit interrelated,\ndimensions:  restructuring/divestment  of  individual  PSUs,  and  enhanced  transparency  and\naccountability within the public enterprises sector.  The reform process is guided by GMP\u2019s\nPolicy on Public Sector Reform and Restructuring, which evolved  from  the  Bank\u2019s  policy\ndialogue with the government, and was approved in January 1998.  On the basis of the policy\nguidelines,  GMP  will  strengthen  those  PSUs  where  continued  government  ownership  is\nrequired to fulfill a public purpose; close chronically sick and loss-incurring enterprises; and\nrestructure and divest remaining enterprises to achieve greater efficiency in their operations,\nincrease market discipline, and allow wider dispersion of ownership. The government has\n                                                       \n31  Interventions could include establishing a dispenser for essential drugs at the village level that would be\nmaintained by local bodies, training for community health workers, etc.", "23\nalready established the institutional mechanism for effective implementation of the reform,\nconsisting of an Empowered Committee on Public Enterprises Restructuring, headed by the\nchief secretary with high-level representation from key sector departments; and a technical\nsecretariat as an advisory body to undertake the preparatory and technical analysis of PSUs\nincluding  valuation,  and  to  provide  assistance  on  technical  aspects  of  restructuring  and\ndivestment.  In implementing public enterprise reform, nodal responsibility for state PSUs will\nbe  transferred  from  line  departments  to  the  Department  of  Public  Enterprise  to  facilitate\ncoordination and reduce possible conflict of interest.\n73. The reform agenda supported by the Program will focus on corporate and financial\nrestructuring of 14 of the 31 state PSUs. 32  The enterprises targeted under the Program have\na total of 37,000 employees, and account for four fifths of total paid-up capital and represent\n85 percent of GMP shareholding in PSUs (excluding MP Electricity Board). The PSU reform\ncovers the whole gamut of enterprises, ranging in size from large entities such as the MPSRTC\nwith some 22,000 employees to the smallest with a workforce of 75; strategic PSUs involved in\nagro-industry; key financial intermediaries; and enterprises with overlapping developmental\nand social functions.  Moreover, the reform program comprises nonviable entities; entities for\nwhich the original objectives for their establishment are no longer valid; and entities that are\nstrategic but do not require full government ownership.\na. Restructuring/Divestment\n74. GMP will undertake organizational and financial restructuring of the Madhya Pradesh\nState  Industrial  Development  Corporation  (MPSIndDC)  while  reducing  government\nshareholding through induction of a strategic partner.  This will be supplemented by corporate\ngovernance  reform  including  a  change  in  the  composition  of  the  company\u2019s  Board  by\nappointing  the  chairman  and  a  majority  of  directors  from  outside  the  government.\nRestructuring  of  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Agro  Industries  Development  Corporation\n(MPSAIDC) will focus initially on hiving off its large agricultural farm, the core strategic function\nof the corporation, in view of the provisions of the Madhya Pradesh Agricultural Land Ceilings\nAct, which limits the size of agricultural land under private ownership. Subsequent reform of\nMPSAIDC will include divestment to not more than 26 percent of government shareholding by\nDecember 2001.\n75. Due to its inefficient operations, MPSRTC has become a major burden on the budget.\nUnder  the  Program,  the  company  will  be  restructured  into  four  corporate  units  with  full\noperational autonomy, the workforce reduced by about 5,000 workers (or 23 percent), and\nmeasures  to  improve  operational  efficiency,  reduce  cost,  and  increase  future  profitability\nintroduced.  Partial divestment will be undertaken by December 2001.\n76. Financial and organizational restructuring of the Madhya Pradesh Financial Corporation\n(MPFinC), the key state financial intermediary, will include (i) classification of nonperforming\nassets  and  full  provisioning  as  per  applicable  norms;  and  (ii)  recapitalization  to  ensure\ncompliance with capital adequacy requirements after setting off accumulated losses against\nthe  corporation\u2019s  equity  and  reserves.    Government  shareholding  will  be  reduced  by  25\npercent as permissible under the State Financial Corporations Act 1951 (contingent upon\namendment to the Act, GMP shareholding will be further reduced to not more than 26 percent).\n                                                       \n32 Restructuring of MPEB will be addressed in the context of power sector reform; the Program focuses particularly\non establishing a tariff regulatory framework to improve MPEB\u2019s internal resource mobilization and reduce\nreliance on the state budget.", "24\n77. In accordance with the state\u2019s tourism policy, the government is refocusing its role as\npromoter of tourism rather than operator and supplier of facilities.  To this end,  GMP  is\nenvisaging  the  sale/lease  of  the  properties  of  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Tourism\nDevelopment Corporation (MPSTourDC), and transfer of staff to private sector owners/lessees\nto the extent possible.  The corporation's focus will then be redirected to promotional and\nregulatory  activities,  undertaken  earlier  by  the  state  tourism  department  prior  to  its\nabolishment.\nb. Closure and/or Merger\n78. Based  on  GMP\u2019s  policy  guidelines  to  close  loss-incurring  enterprises,  as  well  as\nunviable corporations that no longer fulfill their intended objectives, the Program supports\nclosure  of  the  MP  State  Land  Development  Corporation  (MPSLandDC),  the  MP  Leather\nDevelopment  Corporation  (MPLDC),  the  MP  State  Fisheries  Development  Corporation\n(MPSFishC), the MP State Industries Corporation (MPSIC), the MP State Export Corporation\n(MPSExC), as well as MP State Textile Corporation (MPSTexC).  Only MPSTexC will require\napprovals  from  the  Board  for  Industrial  and  Financial  Reconstruction  and  its  appellate\nauthority; the government has initiated the request for approval to close the two mills under\ntheir purview.\n79. The multiplicity of government agencies involved in housing construction and related\nactivities has led to inefficient operations and inadequate financial performance.  To rationalize\noperations and improve their efficiency, the government is planning to merge the Madhya\nPradesh Slum Clearance Board (MPSCB) with the Madhya Pradesh Housing Board (MPHB),\ncorporatize MPHB, and close the Madhya Pradesh Police Housing Corporation (MPPHC).\n80.  Overall, about 10,000 workers are likely to be directly affected by the closure and\nmerger of these entities. The government has already set up the State Renewal Fund, made\nbudgetary allocation to enable settlement of workers\u2019 dues, and is designing a social safety net\non the basis of a poverty impact assessment.\nc. Improved Corporate Governance\n81. Public enterprises are expected to meet social and other noncommercial objectives, in\naddition to financial objectives;  however,  in  pursuing  these  objectives,  PSU  management\ngenerally has limited discretion over fundamental decisions.  Faced by multifarious objectives,\nlimited decision-making autonomy, and few incentives, PSU management will often postpone\nor avoid necessary  decisions.    This  is  reinforced  by  the  existing  system  of  performance\nmonitoring, accountability, and appointment procedures.\n82. The  Program  will  support  measures  for  improving  corporate  governance  and\nstrengthening  the  implementation  framework,  comprising  (i)  institutional  and  management\naspects, including assigning nodal responsibility for PSU reform to the Department of Public\nEnterprise; establishing procedures for screening prospective board members and managing\ndirectors to ensure appointment on a professional basis and with due regard to the PSUs\u2019\nservice  rules;  introducing  procedures  for  enhanced  accountability  as  well  as  associated\nperformance-related  incentives  for  PSU  management;  and  ensuring  longer  tenure  for\nmanaging  directors  while  discontinuing  the  practice  of  combining  that  post  with  other\ngovernment positions; and (ii) financial aspects, including formulating criteria on return on", "25\ninvestment for dividend payment from PSUs to GMP, establishing investment limits up to which\nPSUs do not need government approval, reviewing the existing practice of uniform pay scales\nfor PSUs, and authorizing the linking of salary scales to the productivity and the financial\nperformance of individual PSUs.  TA will also be provided to improve the accounting and\nfinancial systems of the public enterprises.\nd. Mitigating Social Impact through Social Safety Net\n83. The organizational restructuring is expected to lead overall to the retrenchment of more\nthan 16,500 workers. To ameliorate the social impact, GMP is formulating a social safety net\nmechanism and set up a State Renewal Fund, which will provide funds to voluntary retirement\nschemes  with  monetary  compensation  packages  for  the  affected  workers.33    The  State\nRenewal  Fund  will  also  assist  in  the  economic  rehabilitation  through  re-training  and  re-\ndeployment of employees. To ensure timely access to voluntary retirement scheme funds,\nRs1.5 billion ($35 million) were already allocated in the FY1999 and FY2000 budgets, and will\nbe replenished through further budgetary allocation as agreed under the Program.\n4. Evolving Enabling Framework\n \n84. The Program supports GMP in improving the allocation and efficiency of the public\nsector, and evolving the institutional, regulatory, and policy environment for private sector\nparticipation in supporting infrastructure. It will facilitate the formation and establishment of\ntransparent organizational and incentive structures to ensure access by interested private\nparties.  This will require transparency in decision making, de-politicizing existing tariff-setting\nprocedures,  and  establishing  appropriate  regulatory  and  pricing  mechanisms,  as  well  as\nstructural changes in public sector entities to induce commercialization and phasing-out of their\nreliance on budgetary resources.\n85. In line with the Program, GMP envisages fundamental reform of the power sector.\nOverall objectives of the reform include (i) achieving commercial efficiency and improving\nviability of the sector; (ii)  increasing  operational  efficiency  through  enhanced  competition,\nmanagerial autonomy, and higher accountability; and (iii) creating an enabling environment for\nprivate sector participation. GMP plans to open up power generation to the private sector,\nincluding for co-generation plants and captive generating units, and envisages new public\ngenerating stations in competition with private sector generators.  Power distribution may be\ndecentralized into manageable zones that operate as independent profit centers, and would be\nopen for private sector interest through a transparent, competitive bidding process. Although\nprivate sector involvement is envisaged, reform of transmission will focus on commercialization\nof operations in addition to upgrading and strengthening the existing substation structure.\n86. The Program will support the establishment of  a  statutory,  independent  regulatory\nauthority, the Madhya Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (MPERC), with responsibility\nfor determining electricity tariffs and for promoting competition, efficiency, and economy in the\nactivities of the electricity industry.  The MPERC will be fully operational by March 2000, and\ntariff revision is to take place within 120 days following commencement of its operations.\nRationalization of the tariff structure will allow the power sector to recover operational costs,\nmeet  its  statutory  financial  obligations,  generate  funds  to  finance  part  of  its  investment\nprogram, and relieve the industrial and commercial consumers from being overly burdened\n                                                       \n33 A poverty impact assessment was conducted and socioeconomic profile of the workforce of PSUs prepared to\nprovide a benchmark for the design and implementation of the social safety net.", "26\nwith cross-subsidies.  The policy measures supported by the Program are to initiate reform of\nthe  power  sector  and  contribute  to  sustainability  of  the  public  finances.    Further  Bank\ninvolvement, including through separate Bank intervention in support of comprehensive power\nsector restructuring, will build on the establishment of the regulatory framework and reform of\npower tariffs under the Madhya Pradesh Public Resource Management Program.\n87. The opening up of the power sector to private sector generation and the introduction of\nseveral implementing agencies will increase the need for improved long-term planning and\ncoordination at the state level to optimize investments.  To facilitate this, an integrated plan for\nthe sector\u2019s development including least-cost program for expansion of the power system is\nneeded.  The Program will support development of a power system master plan and its use as\nbasis for preparation of a sector CIP, which will be integrated into Madhya Pradesh\u2019s overall\nCIP and follow the priorities set for GMP\u2019s public sector investments.\n88. To establish a conducive and transparent framework for private sector operations, GMP\nis preparing a roads sector policy, which aims to provide an efficient roads system, including\nconnections to all larger villages to meet the needs of the various sectors in the economy\neffectively through an appropriate inter-modal transport mix.  The policy will encourage private\nsector participation in the roads sector including under built-operate-transfer arrangements in\nroad construction and maintenance.  In line with current practice, the private sector needs to\nadopt  prevailing  construction  standards  and  comply  with  all  safety  and  environmental\nregulations.  The design and implementation of private sector projects will be coordinated and\nfacilitated by a private sector cell, to be set up within Public Works Department, which will also\nmonitor compliance with these agreed upon standards.  For the systematic development of the\nroads network including private sector projects, the Department will prepare a sector CIP\nbased on its strategic options study, which is to be fully integrated into the overall CIP.  Highest\npriority will be assigned to improving high-density state highway corridors.  External assistance\nis being contemplated to finance part of the high-priority road network extension.\n89. Two other venues for private sector involvement in the state\u2019s roads sector are being\nimplemented and expected to benefit from the transparency of the enabling framework.  First,\nGMP is permitting private industry to construct and upgrade link roads between villages and\nindustrial growth centers.  It will reimburse industry for the costs either through deduction from\ntheir tax liabilities or, in the case of resource-based industry, by reducing royalty payment due\nto government.  Second, to facilitate private sector participation, Infrastructure  Leasing  &\nFinancial Services Ltd. and GMP (through the MPSIndDC) formed a joint venture, the MP Tolls\nLtd.  Incorporated in January 1996, the company will (i) participate in any scheme promoted by\nthe government or domestic or foreign private sector parties to build and operate roads,\ndevelop transport facilities, and collect tolls or charges for such  activities;  and  (ii)  attract\ninstitutional financing for toll road construction.\n90. Under the Program, the government will formulate a plan for and establish a utilities\npricing commission by the end of 2000.  Tolls may be based on the mode of financing,\nprojected traffic flows, government\u2019s contribution to land costs and access to land near the\nroad project, the cost of road maintenance, and an adequate return to investment.  In the\ninterim, GMP will review the existing toll rates for roads and bridges and assess the feasibility\nand practicality of distance-based toll rates.\n91. To improve the enabling framework for road transportation, GMP will issue a transport\npolicy including guidelines for private sector participation and for rationalizing the operations of", "27\nMPSRTC.  The policy will aim to improve the efficiency of the public transportation system,\ndecentralize and simplify the present permit system by delegating powers to district level, and\nfacilitate transport tariff setting.  Although the Motor Vehicles Act enables GMP to set tariffs for\ngoods  and  passenger  traffic,  the  government  does  not  regulate  goods  fares.    However,\npassenger  fares  (except  for  luxury  buses)  are  fixed  by  the  government  through  Cabinet\ndecision.  Tariffs will be more flexible and linked to changes in operational costs such as\nwages, diesel fuel, and taxes. In view of the higher efficiency of private sector operators,\ndemand  for  transport  licenses  is  expected  to  increase,  thus  enhancing  competition  and\ngenerating funds for improving transport services.  Given the large size of the state, better\nservice quality and improved interconnectivity will benefit particularly the more remote, rural\nareas and their link to urban centers.\n92. The cities in Madhya Pradesh, as in other states, are facing  problems  relating  to\nunauthorized housing construction and growth of slums, and the existing legal provisions are\ngenerally inadequate to mitigate them.  In the recent past, progress has been made particularly\nby the central Government in reforming laws and regulations governing housing development\nand  housing  finance.  The  main  legislative  obstacles  to  expansion  of  urban  housing\ndevelopment have been the ULCRA at the national level, and the rent control acts at the state\nlevel.  In March 1999, the Parliament approved the repeal of the ULCRA, which is expected to\nincrease  the  availability  of  urban  land  and  accelerate  land,  infrastructure,  and  housing\ndevelopment in urban areas.  During the program period, GMP will prepare and enact an\namendment to the state Rent Control Act, which balances the interests of tenant and landlord\nby requiring market-related pricing of rental property.  In particular, the amendment will include\nprovisions to exempt a portion of the rental housing markets from provisions of the Act, permit\nrent revisions based on market trends, and expedite the judicial process for dispute resolution.\nThe Program envisages establishment of rent tribunals to exercise the powers of appeals\nauthority in the state.\n93. The Program contains measures to mobilize resources for the housing sector and\nincrease  the  efficiency  of  service  delivery,  including  lowering  stamp  duty  to  promote\nsecuritization  of  loans  by  movable  and  immovable  properties  (para.  60),  and  eliminating\noverlapping operations of various state government bodies and restructuring, corporatization,\nand subsequent phased divestment of the MP Housing Board (para. 79).  The policy measures\nunder the Program are not only expected to directly attract private capital into the housing\nsector, but also to indirectly enhance resource availability for the sector by ensuring that the\nstate has access to housing finance channeled through the National Housing Bank, Housing\nand Urban Development Corporation, and Housing Development Finance Corporation under\nthe Bank\u2019s recent Housing Finance Project.34\n5. Financial Implications of the Reform Program\n94. In addition to enhancing resource allocations to social sectors, the implementation of\nthe comprehensive reform program will involve substantial adjustment costs estimated at about\n$600 million during the period 1999-2002, as shown in Table 1.  Nonpersonnel outlays of the\nPSU reform accounts for about half of the total cost.  A further $120 million (20 percent) is\n                                                       \n34 Under Loan Nos. 1549, 1550, and 1551, Housing Finance Project, for $300 million, approved on 25 September\n1997, access to funds is limited to states undertaking reforms, particularly as regards rent control and stamp\nduty.  The reform agenda of the Madhya Pradesh Program thus helps deepen the reform initiated under Bank's\nnational-level intervention, strengthen synergy effects, and thereby enhance the development impact.", "28\nrequired to cover the cost of voluntary retirement scheme and social safety net.  Further cost\ndetails are given in Appendix 8.\nTable 1: Financial Implications of the Reform Program\n($ million)         \n________________________________________________\n    Item           Cost\n________________________________________________\n           A.

These costs, particularly of tax reform measures, are likely to be partly offset in the\nmedium  term  by  increased  revenue  from  widening  of  the  tax  base,  improved  property\nvaluation, and strengthened tax administration.  Further resources could be mobilized through\nhigher dividend payment of the remaining PSUs; reduced reliance of PSUs on the budget;\nproceeds from divestment as well as from asset sale (in case of companies to be closed); and\nimproved cost recovery including adjustment in transport and in power tariffs, totaling about\n$70 million annually.  Also, the liabilities to GMP ($112 million), which are costs associated with\nclosure and restructuring of PSUs, will not directly affect budgetary cash outflows, but will have\nan  impact  on  the  financing  of  the  fiscal  deficit.    Repayment  of  these  liabilities  to  the\ngovernment constitute a source of financing that, if written off, would require additional market\nborrowing at prevailing interest rates.\n96. The counterpart funds generated from the Bank's disbursements will be used to cover\noutlays for mitigating the social impact of public enterprise reform as well as the funding for the\nProgram's  social  sector  interventions.    These  social  cost  and  expenditures  for  human\ndevelopment  comprise  inter  alia  outlays  amounting  to  the  equivalent  of  $250  million  for\nvoluntary retirement scheme and social safety net (about Rs5.2 billion); rural health facilities\n(about  Rs2.5  billion);  increased  nonpersonnel  health  expenditures  (about  Rs2  billion);\nincreased  primary  education  expenditures  (about  Rs1.1  billion);  and  expansion  of  rural\nsanitation program (about Rs0.2 billion).\nD. Social and Environmental Issues\n1. Social Impact", "29\n97. Madhya Pradesh is facing severe resource and implementation constraints that, if not\naddressed, will hamper its economic prospects, prevent improvement in social development\n(which is already far below the national average), and adversely affect the state\u2019s overall\ndevelopment process.  While the immediate social issues associated with the Program will\narise through the restructuring of public enterprises, the medium-term issues will come out of\nthe fiscal consolidation process and include shifts in government expenditure and their impact\non  the  availability  of  social  services  and  infrastructure  as  well  as  investment  in  human\ndevelopment (Appendix 9).\n98. The Program\u2019s macroeconomic and sector reforms are expected to improve resource\nmobilization, and lead to reallocation and prioritization of expenditure, which will stimulate\nsaving and investment.  Coupled with dynamic gains through enhanced economic efficiency, in\nthe medium to long term the reform program will stimulate economic and social development,\ngenerate employment, and reduce poverty. The reduction in nonproductive expenditure and\nreallocation to social services and infrastructure will improve access to such services.  An\nadditional synergy effect will be derived from the shift of resources to the health and education\nsectors,  which  will  contribute  to  human  development.  Certain  program  elements  may,  in\ntransition,  adversely  affect  the  economically  weaker  sections  of  society,  mainly  in  the\nadjustment in utility tariffs and rationalization of the sales tax rate schedule through withdrawal\nof tax exemptions.  Yet, fiscal consolidation coupled with a positive supply response of the\nreform program will generate more incomes and thereby mitigate the possibly adverse impact\nof  realigned  prices.    Moreover,  the  formulation  of  a  CIP  will  be  supplemented  by  the\npreparation and implementation of a policy on resettlement and rehabilitation, to ensure that\nthe social impact on people displaced as a result of such projects will be fully taken into\naccount and minimized.\n99. The public enterprise reform program will involve the restructuring, merger, and closure\nof PSUs, which may lead to the retirement of more than 16,500 workers.  A poverty impact\nassessment was conducted to gauge effects of the public sector reform on the poor.35 The\nassessment provided a benchmark for the preparation of a comprehensive social safety net\nthat would include (i) a voluntary retirement scheme as part of the State Renewal Fund36\nconsisting of a monetary compensation package for retrenched workers; (ii)  measures  to\npromote access to social services such as housing, water and sanitation, health and nutrition,\nparticularly of vulnerable groups, and measures to ensure continued access to education for\nchildren whose education may be negatively affected as a result of loss of employment of\ndisplaced workers; (iii) training and self-employment or income-generating programs based on\na training needs assessment for the workers and their family members that is currently under\nway; and (iv) counseling  services and investment guidance to the affected groups on a need-\nbased  approach,  e.g.,  investment  options  for  the  voluntary  retirement  scheme  cash\ncompensation, promoting awareness of and access to credit programs for productive activities.\nGMP is also creating a committee to oversee the preparation and implementation of the social\nsafety net. The committee will be responsible for benefit monitoring of the assistance provided.\n                                                       \n35\nThis  has  involved  discussion  with  stakeholders  including  nongovernmental  organizations  and  trade  union\nrepresentatives. Dissemination of best practices, public information campaign, and stakeholder participation are\nalso integral aspects of the TA being provided to Madhya Pradesh (footnote 4).\n36The Fund will be administered by an empowered committee chaired by the finance minister, with participation of\nthe ministers of Labor, Public Enterprises, and Commerce & Industries; secretary of Institutional Finance; and the\ndirector of the Technical Secretariat.", "30\n2. Environmental Impact\n100. The  Program  is  anticipated  to  have  overall  a  significant  positive  effect  on  the\nenvironment, and includes specific policy measures to mitigate possible adverse environmental\nimpacts  associated  with  economic  growth.    Environmental  problems  in  Madhya  Pradesh\ninclude deforestation, soil erosion, air and water pollution, and encroachment of agriculture\nand subsistence forestry.  Urban and industrial pollution is a mounting problem, while GMP\u2019s\ncapacity for efficient environmental management and monitoring is limited.  The Program is not\ndirectly related to these challenges.  However, it is part of a larger strategy of Bank operations,\nfocusing on higher growth and sustainable economic development.  The establishment of the\nMadhya  Pradesh  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  under  the  Program  is  expected  to\nintroduce rational pricing of energy, particularly for the agriculture sector.  Pricing of power will\nreduce wasteful use of two scarce resources: water and energy.  In addition, rationalization of\nwater pricing also will have environmental benefits by promoting judicious water usage.\n101.   Fiscal consolidation, reduction in subsidies, and improved cost recovery are expected\nto  facilitate  more  prudent  management  of  natural  resources.  Growth-induced  income\ngeneration is likely to reduce the necessity for people to encroach on fragile land.  Improved\neducation can help raise awareness of the longer term benefits of properly managing scarce\nnatural resources.  This awareness may raise the relative priority given to environmentally\nsound projects and thus may be reflected in the state\u2019s CIP.  Further favorable impact is\nanticipated from the improvement in efficiency and reduction in resource use as part of the\nPSU restructuring program.  The Technical Secretariat will help assess the environmental\nimpact of PSU reforms.\n102. Public finance reform and PSU restructuring are expected to have an indirect positive\nimpact on the environment, but the Program also comprises specific measures to support the\nenvironmental sustainability of  economic  growth  and  industrial  development,  for  example,\nefficiency gains in natural resource utilization, and reduction of pollution and waste in several\nsectors  (industries,  water,  transport,  and  mining).    Furthermore,  the  adoption  of  a  state\nenvironment policy will  make  Madhya  Pradesh  the  first  state  in  the  country  to  adopt  an\nenvironmental policy consistent with the overall national agenda for sustainable development.\nThe  policy  will  actively  promote  market-based  instruments  for  natural  resource  and\nenvironmental management and it will require the formulation of a time-bound action plan for\ntheir implementation.  Concurrently, the State Pollution Control Board will be strengthened\nthrough capacity building (for which Bank TA is envisaged) in key environmental areas such as\nhazardous, industrial, and solid waste management; environmental monitoring; and integrated\ntraining of industrial associations on pollution control.\nVI. THE PROPOSED LOAN\nA. Amount of Loan and Source of Funds\n103. A loan of $250 million to India is proposed from the Bank\u2019s ordinary capital resources\nfor the proposed Program.  The loan will be utilized to cover the cost of structural adjustment\nof public enterprise reform including outlays associated with the social safety net, as well as\nfunding for the social sector interventions under the Program.", "31\nB. Interest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n104. The  loan  will  carry  standard  terms  and  conditions  for  loans  from  ordinary  capital\nresources, with an amortization period of 15 years including a grace period of 3 years.  It will\ncarry an interest rate determined in accordance with the Bank\u2019s pool-based variable lending\nrate system for US dollar loans, and a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum.  The\nloan proceeds will be utilized over a three-year period from loan effectiveness to finance\neligible expenditures, including those incurred within 180 days prior to loan effectiveness.\nC. Implementation Arrangements\n105. The Finance Department of GMP will be the Executing Agency for coordinating and\nmonitoring the Program, and administering the loan proceeds. The Finance Department will be\nsupported by:\n(i)  the PRMC chaired by the chief minister to advise and oversee implementation\nof the reforms (empowered committees on public finance reform and on public\nenterprises restructuring, both headed by the chief secretary, with high-level\nrepresentation from the Finance, Commercial Taxes, and Public Enterprises\nDepartment will support and report regularly to the PRMC), and\n(ii)  the  Technical  Secretariat  for  guidance  on  technical  aspects  of  the\nrestructuring/divestment process of public enterprises reform.\n106. Capacity  building  and  institutional  strengthening  are  integral  components  of  the\nProgram, and are addressed in ongoing and proposed TA.\nD. Procurement\n107. The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  utilized  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange  costs\n(excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced in, and procured from, the Bank\u2019s member\ncountries (other than those items specified as ineligible [Appendix 10]).  Contracts for eligible\nimports  will  be  awarded  either  through  normal  commercial  procurement  practices  and\nprocedures of the private sector or the prescribed procurement procedures of the Government\nacceptable to the Bank.\nE. Disbursement\n108. In accordance with the provisions of the Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and\nRelated Requirements for Program Loans,37  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be\ndisbursed to the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required, if during each\nyear in which the proceeds of the loan are expected to be disbursed, the value of India\u2019s total\nimports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed\nunder other official development assistance are equal to or greater than the amount of the loan\n                                                       \n37 Board Paper R50-98. The Appraisal Mission verified the applicability of the formula for India.", "32\nexpected to be disbursed during such year.  The Borrower will, however, certify with each\nwithdrawal request its compliance with this formula.  Otherwise, import documentation under\nexisting procedures will be required.\n109. Loan proceeds may be used for financing eligible imports for which expenditures were\nincurred 180 days prior to the date the loan becomes effective.  Retroactive financing is\njustified to ensure timely release of counterpart funds to the state government that has already\nincurred a part of the cost of structural adjustment because of prior fulfillment of the conditions\nof the program loan on tax reform.  The central Government as the Borrower and the GMP will\nmaintain separate accounts and records for the loan in accordance with sound accounting\nprinciples,  and  will  have  such  accounts  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  standards\nacceptable to the Bank.\nF. Counterpart Funds\n110. The  rupee  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be\ntransferred by the Borrower to GMP. The counterpart proceeds will be treated as an addition to\nthe transfers allocated annually from the Borrower to GMP.  The counterpart funds will finance\noutlays for mitigating the social impact of public enterprise reform as well as funding for the\nProgram's social sector interventions.\nG. Monitoring and Tranching\n111. The Program will be implemented over a three-year period from loan effectiveness.\nThe loan will be disbursed in three tranches to enable close monitoring of implementation.  The\nfirst tranche, equivalent to $100 million, will become available following compliance with the\nloan conditions and after loan effectiveness.\n112. The second tranche, equivalent to $75 million, may be released around September\n2000, approximately 18 months after the release of the first tranche or earlier, upon the\ncontinued compliance with previous tranche conditions and on compliance with the conditions\nand actions described in paras.  113-115.\n113.

The Bank will send periodic review missions to examine\ncompliance with the program conditions and to prepare a progress report covering both the\ngovernment\u2019s compliance with the tranche conditions, and the general progress in program\nimplementation.\nVII. THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE", "35\n121. To  complement  the  ongoing  assistance  on  support  for  economic  and  social\ndevelopment and institutional strengthening (footnote 4), it is proposed that the Bank provide\nTA  for  capacity  building  for  the  state's  public  enterprise  reform  and  for  designing  and\nimplementing the social safety net.  The TA will assist in (i) establishing effective institutional\nmechanisms for PSU restructuring/divestment, and for designing and implementing the SSN;\n(ii) transfer of skills on implementing PSU reforms; and (iii) improving corporate governance\nincluding strengthening of PSUs' accounting and information systems, thereby contributing to\nan effective implementation of components of sustainable public sector reform envisaged\nunder the Program.\n122. The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $750,000  equivalent,  comprising  foreign\nexchange costs of $350,000 and $400,000 equivalent in local currency costs.  The Bank will\nfinance $600,000, on a grant basis from the Bank-funded TA program, and GMP will contribute\nthe equivalent of $150,000 in kind for counterpart staff, office accommodation and other\nfacilities, local transportation, and other services.  The outline terms of reference and its cost\nestimates are in Appendix 11.\nVIII. PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA. Benefits\n123. Economic and structural reforms.  An important benefit of the Program will be its\ncontribution to the success of the overall reform agenda.  The Program is designed to assist\nGMP in improving and sustaining the social and economic development of the state; reforming\nthe public sector; and evolving a conducive environment for private sector participation.  Fiscal\nreform  will  reduce  the  state\u2019s  budget  deficit,  improve  expenditure  prioritization  including\nreallocation to social services, and improve the efficiency and equity of the revenue system.\nAs  the  resource  requirements  for  human  development  are  so  large,  domestic  resource\nmobilization will foster sustainability of social sector interventions, improve their quality, and\nenable  expansion  in  their  coverage.  The  restructuring/divestment  and  closure  of  public\nenterprises will increase the productivity and efficiency of the economy, and facilitate the\nadoption of market-oriented business practices.  Further, the development and implementation\nof an enabling environment for the private sector will create a level playing field and provide\nthe necessary assurance regarding the stability and transparency of policies and regulations.\nThis in turn will induce private investment, counter the shortages in the infrastructure sector,\nand thereby help remove bottlenecks to future economic expansion.  Increased efficiency of\nresource mobilization and improved effectiveness of resource use will facilitate redirection of\nfunds to social services.  Overall, timely and successful implementation of the reforms will set\nan example for other reform-oriented states to undertake such comprehensive reform program.\n124. Human Development.  The Program\u2019s focus on fostering social development  and\neconomic growth is intended to reduce the state\u2019s severe poverty, and to raise its skill base,\nand to improve on a sustainable basis the living conditions of its population.  Improved access\nto and delivery of social services, such as health and education, and a supporting social safety\nnet will directly benefit the socially and economically disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.\nWhile benefiting the current population and its ability to generate income, the positive impact\non the state\u2019s development process will also improve the population\u2019s future income ability.\nThe Bank\u2019s support for human development in this state should have a catalytic effect in other\npoor states.", "36\n125. Transparency and institutional capacity.  The Program supports the establishment\nand implementation of transparent policy and regulatory frameworks in infrastructure sectors to\ncreate a conducive environment for private sector participation and crowding-in of private\ninvestment.  While addressing public enterprise restructuring and divestment, the Program\nalso supports improvement in corporate governance, including increasing PSUs\u2019 operational\nfreedom and enhancing management accountability for public enterprise performance.  TA is\nbeing provided to assist the government in strengthening its capacity, particularly in fiscal\nmanagement  and  expenditure  control,  and  in  restructuring  and  divestment  of  public\nenterprises.  Assistance is also provided for reviewing the policy and regulatory frameworks of\nhealth and education sectors, assessing the potential for improved cost recovery in social and\neconomic services, and preparing a time-bound plan for directing further resources to social\ninfrastructure.\nB. Risks and Safeguards\n126. The principal underlying risks include (i) the limited experience and institutional capacity\nof  the  state  government  to  implement  comprehensive  reforms;  (ii)  the  adequacy  of\ncoordinating  mechanisms,  considering  the  large  number  of  government  agencies,\ndepartments, and public enterprises involved in the implementation of program activities; (iii)\nthe potential delay of divestments due to market conditions; and (iv) the fact that continued\nprogress in social development depends on financial assistance from the international aid\ncommunity.\n127. Program design and supporting TA have been prepared with  a  view  to  mitigating\nassociated risks and providing safeguards for effective implementation.  The Program contains\nsubstantial upfront conditionality to ensure early initiation of a broad-based reform agenda.\nFurther, under the Program, longer term measures related to subsequent tranches such as\nPSU restructuring, are being initiated at an early stage to deepen the reform process and\nmake it irreversible, and technical capacity for public enterprise reform is being strengthened.\nEffective  coordination  mechanisms  and  appropriate  implementation  capacity  are  being\nintroduced under the Program through high-level committees, Technical Secretariat, State\nBudgeting and Fiscal Analysis Unit, as well as through advisory support from Bank TA.\nIX. RECOMMENDATION\n128.

Ongoing Bank support\n1.  Presently, the Bank is providing technical assistance (TA) as part of its support\nfor  improving  good  governance,  strengthening  public  resource  management,  and\nfostering human development in Madhya Pradesh.  The two ongoing TAs focus on the\npolicy, regulatory, and institutional aspects of provision of social and economic services.\nThe strengthening of institutional capacity in reallocating resources to social sectors for\ntargeted social interventions will support the state government's effort in formulating a\nsustainable development strategy to increase the standard of living in Madhya Pradesh.\n2.  The TA support is provided to both state and local levels of government. The\nobjective of one is to improve development management by supporting the GMP's public\nfinance  reform  including  reform  of  tax  system  and  expenditure  prioritization  and\nmanagement, and institutional strengthening. 1  The other is providing assistance to the\nstate government's good governance initiative through decentralization effort, focusing\non enhancing resource mobilization capacities of urban and rural local bodies, improving\nand modernizing the information gathering and processing for rational decision making\nat state and local levels, and strengthening the institutional capacity of the training\nfacilities for local bodies. 2\n1.       Capacity Building for Development Management and State Public\nFinance Reform\n3.  At the state level, the Bank's technical assistance for sustainable economic and\nsocial development includes (i) structural reforms of the tax system and improvement in\ntax  administration;  (ii)  improvement  in  expenditure  prioritization  and  expenditure\nmanagement  and  control  systems;  (iii)  enhanced  transparency  of  the  institutional,\nregulatory, and procedural frameworks; and (iv) institutional strengthening and capacity\nbuilding  through  training,  modernization  and  networking  of  administration,  and\ninstitutional setup for formulation and assessment of economic policy options.\n4.  Support for reform of the tax system and tax administration focuses on improving\npublic resource mobilization to ensure sufficient and sustainable provision of social and\neconomic  services.    Activities  include  the  formulation  of  a  framework  for  a\ncomprehensive  value-added  tax  system,  institutional  strengthening  of  the  sales  tax\nadministration including staff training to facilitate transformation of the existing sales tax\nsystem  to  value-added  tax;  establishment  of  valuation  cells  for  the  organizational\nimprovement of stamp duty and registration; and training of staff on the new valuation\nsystem.\n5.  Assistance for improving expenditure management and control, and expenditure\nprioritization including expenditure reallocation to social services and preparation of a\ncore investment program, is an essential part of the Bank's support for a sustainable\ndevelopment strategy to improve basic human needs in Madhya Pradesh.  TA support\nincludes  assessment  of  the  institutional,  policy,  and  regulatory  frameworks  for\n                                                       \n1 TA  No.  2943-IND:  Support for the Government of Madhya Pradesh Public Finance Reform and\nInstitutional Strengthening, for $780,000, approved on 15 December 1997.\n2 TA No. 2944-IND: Strengthening Local Government in Madhya Pradesh, for $700,000, approved on 15\nDecember 1997.", "Appendix 11, page 2\nimprovement of social  service  provision.    In  particular,  TA  in  the  education  sector\nfocuses  on  prioritizing  proposed  education  schemes,  reviewing  budget  allocation\nmechanisms, proposing norms for appropriate pricing of services, and analyzing the\ndeterminants of the appropriate future mix between the public and private provision of\nsuch services and the necessary regulatory and procedural changes.  Reform of the\nhealth  sector  focuses  on  improvement  in  the  regulatory  and  policy  framework  for\neffective management of service delivery, criteria for prioritization of budget allocation\ntowards primary and preventative health care with maximum outreach of health services\nto the poor, women and girls, and tribal communities, and assessment of the potential\nfor cost recovery in the sector while protecting access to health services by the poor.\nThese efforts are complemented by institutional improvement through establishing a\nstate budgeting and fiscal analysis unit to provide analytical and technical support for\npolicy making and through suitable training programs.\n6.  The Bank's assistance for human development through capacity building is being\nsupported by providing training of staff in the methodology of expenditure prioritization\nand core investment program, strengthening the analytical capacity for budget planning\nand monitoring as well as revenue and expenditure analysis and projection, and in\ntraining  on  effective  audit,  accounting,  and  control  procedures.    For  long-term\nsustainability  of  capacity upgrading,  close attention  is  being  given  to  strengthening\ntraining facilities and to institutionalizing training, through establishing links to state-level\ninstitutions such as the State Academy of Administration. To promote private sector and\nstakeholder participation, workshops are being held to discuss topics such as service\ndelivery in social sectors, pricing policy, and institutional and regulatory frameworks.\n2. Institutional Strengthening of Urban and Rural Local Governments\n7.  The support for institutional strengthening and capacity building of urban and\nrural  government  in  a  decentralized  democratic  setup  is  based  on  international\nexperience that the benefits of public provision of social and economic services will not\nbe sustainable unless local capacity for resource mobilization, effective utilization, and\nexpenditure  management  is  adequately  enhanced.   The  TA therefore assists  in  (i)\nstrengthening the resource mobilization capacities of local bodies; (ii) improving the\ninformation system at the district level to facilitate rational decision making and (iii)\nstrengthening training facilities for substate local bodies.\n8.  First, capacity for management of municipal finances needs to be developed to\nenable effective and sustainable devolution of fiscal responsibility to local governments.\nTo this effect, the scope and efficiency of local resource mobilization efforts are being\nenhanced by reforming local taxes including property tax; appropriate pricing of services\non the basis of established standards of service delivery, and the contracting out of local\nservices  to the  private  sector.   This  will form  the framework  for  the  Bank's  future\nintervention  through  its  urban  and  environmental  improvement  initiatives  to  ensure\nsustainability  of  the  resource  utilization  and  capacity  building  efforts  of  local\ngovernments.\n9.  Second, to provide direct and effective assistance to the rural sector (and in\nparticular  the  rural  poor),  the  Bank  is  supporting  the  development  of  a  suitable\norganizational structure and regulatory framework for the transfer of minor irrigation\nprojects (i.e., projects up to 2,000 hectares) to local governments and their sustainable\noperation and maintenance.", "Appendix 11, page 3\n10.  Third, Bank support focuses on facilitating rational decision making by identifying\nthe information requirements for effective administration and management at the local\nlevel,  developing  appropriate  information  systems,  and  upgrading  the  operating\nprocedures of the concerned state and district statistical offices.\n11.  Finally,  the  TA  is  providing  support  to  strengthen  local  governments'\nimplementation  capacity,  including  training  for  elected  representatives  and\nadministrators of local bodies by developing, adapting, and integrating course material\nfor  dissemination  through  distance  learning,  existing  training  institutes,  and  other\nsuitable organizations.

Proposed Technical Assistance\n1. Objectives and Scope\n12. The  aim  of  the  TA  is  to  support  the  government's  efforts  to  develop  and\nimplement  a  comprehensive  and  socially  sustainable  program  of  public  enterprise\nreform.    The  objectives  are  to  (i)  establish  effective  institutional  mechanisms  for\nrestructuring  and  divestment  of  public  sector  undertakings,  including  assistance  in\ndesigning and implementing the social safety net; (ii) capacity building for undertaking\nPSU  reform;  and  (iii)  improving  corporate  governance  including  strengthening\naccounting and information systems of PSUs.\n13. The  scope of the  TA  will  include  (i)  providing  assistance  on  all  aspects  of\nrestructuring and divestment including valuation, corporate and financial restructuring,\ntendering and bid evaluation, and labor issues; (ii) reviewing and assessing the existing\narrangements for management of PSUs and corporate governance structure; suggesting\nmeasures to increase accountability and enhance PSUs\u2019 operational autonomy; and\nassessing  the  need  for  improvement  in  PSUs'  accounting  systems  and  reporting\nrequirements; (iii) conducting workshop to expose policy makers, management of PSUs,\nand government agencies to national and international experience on approach and\nmodalities of restructuring/divestment efforts to enhance their capacity, and organizing\ntraining seminars and conducting training for staff of the Department of Public Enterprise\nand the Technical Secretariat; and (iv) providing assistance in the design of the social\nsafety  net  and  suitable  mechanisms  and  institutional  setups;  and  (v)  designing\nappropriate strategies including training and establishing links to local institutions for\nlong-term sustainability.\n2.
