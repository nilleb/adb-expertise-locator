The  project,  by \nimproving the last 60-kilometer (km) bottleneck section of the Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) Corridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road), will contribute to fostering regional \ntrade  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  higher \nmobility  for  people  in  Naryn  Province  where  poverty  is  widespread.  It  will  also  help  increase \nsustainability of the national road network by training staff on infrastructure management. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe terrain of the Kyrgyz Republic is dominated by the Tian Shan and Pamir mountain \nsystems, which together occupy about 65% of the country. Trade and travel in this landlocked \ncountry  are  highly  dependent  on  road  transport.  Endorsed  under  the  CAREC  Transport  and \nTrade  Facilitation  Strategy,2 the  approximate  539  km  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  forms  part  of  the \nCAREC Transport Corridor 1 and has several important functions. The road, part of the old Silk \nRoad  that  once  linked  Europe  with  what  is  now  the  PRC,  is  the  shortest  thoroughfare  from \nKashi, a vibrant cultural and trade center in the PRC, to consumer markets in northern Kyrgyz \nRepublic  and  beyond.  It  is  also  the  only  north\u2013south  trunk  road  in  central  Kyrgyz  Republic, \nwhere  the  city  of  Naryn,  in  particular,  depends  heavily  on  it  for  connecting  to  the  rest  of  the \ncountry. It is the only road that provides direct access at present to Issyk Kul lake region, one of \nCentral  Asia's  best-known  tourist  destinations  with  a  huge  growth  potential.  However,  costly, \nunreliable,  and  unsafe  travel  caused  by  the  poor  road  conditions  has  hampered  social  and \neconomic development along the road corridor, particularly for Naryn Province. \n \n4. \nAs  one  of  the  key  development  partners  for  the  country\u2019s  roads,  ADB  financed  the \nimprovement  of  114 km (km  365\u2013479)  of  the  road  corridor  in  2008  and  2009,3 and  helped  the \ngovernment strengthen trade ties with its neighbors through CAREC. In 2010 the Government \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China financed the improvement of 223 km (most of km 9\u2013272), and \nin 2012 the Islamic Development Bank financed the improvement of 93 km (km 272\u2013365) of the \nroad corridor. The project will improve the 60 km section from At Beit to Torugart (km 479\u2013539) \nat  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2013PRC  border,  the  last  segment  of  the  road  corridor.  Together  with  the \nimprovement  works  in  other  sections  and  the  corridor\u2019s full  opening  to  traffic  by  2017, this  will \nenable  all-weather  smooth  flow  of  local  traffic  between  Bishkek  and  Torugart,  as  well  as \ninternational through-traffic from the PRC to Central Asia and beyond, unleashing one of the key \nconstraints to national and regional trade competitiveness and inclusive growth. Apart from the \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2011.

The \nproject will also support a long-term, results-oriented program of learning and development for \nthe Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) and other government staff. It will result \nin  better-informed  staff,  equipped  to  champion  strategies  for  reducing  life-cycle  costs  and \nimproving user cost recovery.4 \n \n5. \nThe  project  road  site  conditions  are  unique\u2014elevation  is  over  3,000  meters  and  the \nweather  allows  only  about  5  months  (May\u2013October)  in  a  year  for  any  construction  work;  the \nground is permanently frozen, and part of the road alignment is close to a unique wetland. Civil \nworks were procured using a tailored design\u2013build delivery method to share the cost and risk of \ndesign  changes  between  the  project  executing  agency  and  the  contractor,  and  allow  the \ncontractor  to  bring more  economical  and  relevant technology  and  construction  methods  to  the \nsite.  Detailed  engineering  investigations  by  the  contractor  and  the  construction  supervision \nthe  road \nthat  additional  engineering  measures  (mainly \nconsultant \nembankment height, using suitable subgrade materials, and installing additional road drainage \nsystems) are necessary to address the unforeseen frost heaves in some sections. This will help \nprevent premature pavement failure caused by pavement cracking and extend road service life. \n \n6. \nThe  project  was  approved  in  June  2011  with  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent to \nSDR35,041,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  The  loan  became  effective  in  February \n2012  and  will  close  on  31  March  2016.  Contract  packages  for  the  works  and  construction \nsupervision  and  environmental  management  were  awarded  in  2012.  The  project  has  been \nperforming  well  with  cumulative  contract  awards  at  89%  and  disbursements  at  62%  as  of  30 \nOctober 2014.5 The present project performance rating is on track. \n \nAdditional  financing.  The  total  project  cost  has  increased  by  $18  million,  from  \n7. \n$70  million  in  2011  to  $88  million  in  2014.  The  cost  overruns,  resulting  from  the  detailed \nengineering  design  under  the  design\u2013build  delivery  arrangement,  are  attributed  to  corrective \nengineering  measures  and  input  price  increases.  The  government  has  accordingly  requested \nfinancing  to  achieve  the  project\u2019s  intended  outputs  with  greater  technical  quality.  Given  that \nadditional engineering measures by nature are an integral part of ongoing civil works, additional \nfinancing  is  deemed  a  more  suitable  instrument  than  options  of  restructuring,  scaling  down, \nand/or  canceling  the  project.  This  is  because  (i)  the  project  will  either  not  be  completed  to \nrequired standards or not delivered in full if cost overruns are not met, therefore unable to fully \nmeet  its  development  objectives;  (ii)  the  project  provided  with  additional  financing  can  be \ncompleted within 2 years of the current loan closing date; and (iii) possible risks associated with \nthe project, including procurement delays, high bid prices, construction delays, and further cost \noverruns, have been properly mitigated and/or addressed. \n \n8. \nin  an  advanced  stage  of \nimplementation  and  the  government  accords  high  priority  to  this  additional  financing  to  meet \ncost  overruns.6 The  development  objectives  remain  unchanged  with  the  additional  financing. \nThe  project  fits  with  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020 7 and  aligns  with  the  country \n                                                 \n4   Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n5   Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6   The  government  requested  the  additional  financing  on  23  July  2014  when  cost  overruns  were  identified,  and \n\nEligibility  of  additional  financing.  The  project \n\nis \n\nincluded in the forthcoming ADB country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017 for the Kyrgyz Republic. \n\n7   ADB. 2014.

As such, the \nadditional financing meets the eligibility criteria in ADB\u2019s Additional Financing Policy. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe impact and outcome for the revised project will remain unchanged from those for the \noriginal project, as the additional financing will not materially change the project scope and size. \nThe  project  impact  will  be  increased  regional  trade,  particularly  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic \nand  the  PRC.  The  outcome  will  be  higher  mobility  for  people  and  goods  with  origins  and \ndestinations in the road corridor between Naryn and Torugart. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nThe project outputs are unchanged with the additional financing. The primary output will \nbe  60  km  of  two-lane  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  (km  479\u2013539)  repaired,  rehabilitated,  or \nreconstructed  to  national  category  III  road  standards  with  a  roadside  truck  parking  facility  and \nspecial  features  for  protecting  the  environment,  preserving  the  road  structure,  and  reducing \nvehicle  crashes.  This  will  be  delivered  through  the  civil  works  component.  The  second  output \nwill be improved infrastructure management skills of MOTC and other government agency staff, \nachieved through training, education, and mentoring by national and international consultants. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n11. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $88 million equivalent (Table 1). \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\nAdditional \nFinancingb \n\nTotal \n\nCurrent \nAmounta \n  \n \n\nItem \nA.

Likewise,  associated  supervision  of  these  additional  works  will  be  added  through  a \nvariation to the existing construction supervision contract. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n15. \nThe  design\u2013build  delivery  method  was  adopted  for  the  project  in  view  of  unique  site \nconditions,  limitations  of  national  standard  specifications,  output  quality,  and  economy.  The \ndetailed engineering assessment conducted by the contractor and the construction supervision \nconsultant,  including  an  independent  technical  expert,  noted  the  need  for  some  design \nimprovements  to  mitigate  likely  pavement  cracking  arising  from  unforeseen  frost  heaves  in \nsome  road  sections.  The  associated  corrective  engineering  measures  also  respond  to  the \nclimate  risk  assessment,  which  identifies  the  large  temperature  variation  as  a  main  climate \nchange  impact  on  the  project  road.  The  measures  include  (i)  additional  drainage  layers  in \nwaterlogged  areas  to  reduce  the  likelihood  of  capillary  action  into  the  pavement  layers  and \ndeeper side drainage wherever required; (ii) additional subgrade layer of about 30 centimeters \nfor km 502\u2013532 to raise the pavement layers above the high water table; and (iii) removal of soft \nspots  and  replacement  with  suitable  fill  materials.  Such  corrective  measures  are  essential  to \nensure  that  the  finished  road  surface  meets  the  quality  requirements  for  road  maintainability, \nsafety, and comfort.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nRehabilitation  and/or  reconstruction  of  the  60  km  section  between  km  479  on  the \n16. \nBishkek\u2013Naryn\u2013Torugart (BNT) road and the border with the PRC near Torugart will provide for \nan increasing volume of road traffic, and reduce the transit time for goods and passengers. The \nproject  is  designed  to  reduce  vehicle  operating  costs  and  lower  travel  times  for  domestic  and \nregional  travel  through  the  provision  of  a  higher  quality  route.  This  will  facilitate  national  and \nregional trade and reduce poverty by improving access for rural communities to market, health, \nand education facilities. This project is part of a wider, multiagency BNT road rehabilitation and \nupgrading program. Completion of the 60 km section, in addition to providing benefits to users, \nwill serve to protect benefits produced by rehabilitation of other sections of the entire BNT road.  \n \n17. \nFor  the  project,  which  is  experiencing  cost  overruns,  a  reduced  project  scope  would \nleave  the  last-mile  bottleneck  unattended,  hence  impairing  the  full  functionality  of  the  539  km \nBNT road corridor.  A substandard  road  with  the same  project  scope  would  require  higher  and \nmore frequent maintenance and shorten the road service life, leading to higher life-cycle costs \nthan  would  the  outcome  with  additional  capital  financing.  As  such,  the  option  of  additional \nfinancing  is  considered  an  appropriate  solution.  An  economic  evaluation  comparing  with-  and \nwithout-project  scenarios  was  undertaken  for  km  479\u2013539.  The  economic  benefits  include  \n(i)  vehicle  operating  cost  savings  and  (ii)  travel  time  savings.  The  results  of  the  economic \nevaluation  show  that  the  project  yields  an  average  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  12.3%, \nmoreover,  considering  that  the  project  will  yield  benefits  in  terms  of  economic  development, \n\n                                                 \n10 The beneficiary will use the current loan to the extent possible before utilizing the additional financing from the loan \n\nand grant on a pro rata basis for contract payments, as described in the PAM. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\ncomfort, and reliability of travel that are not monetized in the economic analysis, the project can \nbe deemed to be economically viable. 11 \n \n18. \nThe government has increased the road maintenance budget continuously, despite fiscal \nconstraints. State budget allocations for road maintenance increased from Som221.6 million in \n2005  to  Som1.85  billion  in  2013.  While  long-term  maintenance  needs  are  still  underfinanced, \nthis  budget  outlay  is  expected  to  increase  in  the  coming  years;  in  the  meantime,  road \nmaintenance continues to be prioritized by the perceived importance of road corridors. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n19.  MOTC\u2019s  IPIG  has  been  following  ADB\u2019s  safeguards,  procurement  and  financial \nmanagement  guidelines,  policies,  and  procedures  for  implementing  road  projects  since  1996, \nand  has  implemented  more  than  10  ADB  road  projects  totaling  more  than  $300  million.  IPIG \nstaff  have  adequate  knowledge,  understanding,  and  experience  with  ADB  procedures  to \nmanage the project. IPIG has satisfactory capacity for project financial accounting and a proven \ntrack record  with  ADB\u2019s disbursement  procedures.  A  private  audit firm  acceptable to  ADB  has \naudited the project financial statements annually. Past audit reports on ADB projects have not \nhighlighted  any  irregularities.  The  risk  for  the  project\u2019s  financial  management  arrangements \nduring  implementation  is  considered moderate. MOTC  will  conduct  periodic  technical  audits of \nthe  work  of  the  supervision  consultant  and  contractor  as  part  of  its  increased  oversight  of \ncontracts for works, services, and goods. MOTC will train its staff under the skills development \ncomponent of the project, and introduce internal financial audits and technical audits. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n20. \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  MOTC.  Key  measures  to  ensure  proper  governance  include  \n(i)  independent  external  auditing  of  contracts,  project  accounts,  and  financial  statements;  \n(ii)  transparent  decision  processes  for  all  procurement  matters;  and  (iii)  verification  of \ncontractors\u2019  payment  claims  by  the  supervising  consultant,  and  oversight  by  the  project \nimplementation  unit.  IPIG  staff  responsible  for  procurement  and  contract  administration  are \naware  of  and  understand  the  requirements.  The  requirements  and  supplementary  measures \nincluded in all contracts are described in the PAM.  \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n21.  When  viewed  in  the  context  of  the  entire  BNT  road,  the  project  will  bring  significant \nbenefits  to  the  people  of  Naryn  Province  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  as  a  whole,  and  will  have \npositive impacts on poverty reduction in the PRC. The 30% reduction in trip times and vehicle \noperating costs from Torugart to Naryn will increase activity at the freight transit center in Naryn \ncity.  This  will  create  more  jobs  and  increase  demand for  local  services.  People  residing  along \nthe  road  will  be  able  to  find  employment  in  physical  works  and  ancillary  services  during \nconstruction. The increase in traffic will help sustain the service businesses that people started \nduring  construction.  Civil  works  and  service  contracts  financed  by  ADB  will  require  equal \nemployment  opportunities,  equal  wages  for  equal  work,  and  full  observance  of  core  labor \nstandards.  The  government  has  gradually  increased  border  and  internal  security  monitoring, \nand  will  implement  a  national  road  safety  awareness  program  in  local  communities.  These \nmeasures will help prevent possible negative social effects such as traffic accidents, human and \ndrug trafficking, and spread of sexually transmitted infections, which may result from increased \ntravel and trade. \n\n                                                 \n11 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n22. \nThe  project  classification  of  A for  environment reflects  the fact that  about  35 km  of the \nroad passes through the Karatal\u2013Japaryk State Nature Reserve in close proximity to Chatyr Kul \nLake,  which  is  a  Ramsar-protected  wetland  area.  The  additional  financing  will  not  entail  any \nadditional  environmental  impacts,  and  is  classified  as  environment  category  C.  ADB  assisted \nthe  government  in  conducting  an  environmental  impact  assessment,  which  shows  that  (i)  the \nimpacts  during  construction  are mostly  acute, temporary,  and reversible,  with  the  exception of \npossible  hazardous  materials  spills  and  operations  of  borrow  pits;  (ii)  potential  impacts  during \noperations  are  expected  to  be  much  greater  as  the  road  has  a  design  life  of  20  years,  and \npollutants  entering  the  Chatyr  Kul  aquatic  ecosystem  could  be  accumulated  because  the  lake \nhas no outlet; (iii) some improvements in dust, noise, and vibration are expected; and (iv) long-\nterm  impacts  caused  by  increased  traffic,  vehicle  emissions,  and  possible  spills  of  hazardous \nmaterials pose potential risks to the Chatyr Kul ecosystem and other wildlife in the state nature \nreserve, including migrating birds. \n \nThe draft environmental impact assessment report was discussed with stakeholders and \n23. \ndisclosed  to  the  public  in  November  2010;  it  was  subsequently  updated  prior  to  commencing \ncivil  works  and  publicly  disclosed  in  January  2014. 12  The  report  contains  a  two-track \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP) for  pollutant  source  control  and receptor (biodiversity) \nprotection.  The  control  and  protection  measures  include  speed  limits,  road  signs,  special \npermits  for  hazardous  material  movement;  hydraulic  structures  such  as  retention  ponds, \ncontained  borrow  sites,  and  diversion  channels  to  prevent  runoff  pollutants  and  accidentally \nspilled toxic substances from entering the wetlands; and equipment and training for emergency \nresponse. \n \n24. \nThe  environmental  monitoring  program  includes  monthly  monitoring  by  the  contractor \nand quarterly ecological monitoring by the supervision consultant together with Karatal\u2013Japaryk \nState  Nature  Reserve  staff. The  special monitoring  plan for the borrow  sites  is  included  in the \nborrow  pit  management  plan,  which  ADB  and  the  local  authority  of  the  State  Agency  for \nEnvironmental Protection and Forestry have both approved. An ecological response plan (ERP) \nwas  prepared  to  supplement  the  EMP  and  is  being  implemented.  The  plan  includes  a \ncomprehensive  capacity  building  program  for  management  of  the  state  nature  reserve.  In \naddition  to  the  supervision  consultant,  who  has  been  working  with  MOTC  during  project \nimplementation,  MOTC  has  recruited  an  experienced  international  environment  consultant  to \nassist project implementation unit staff in developing the ERP as outlined in the EMP, providing \nguidance  to  the  supervision  consultant  and  contractor,  and  supervising  implementation  of  the \nEMP and ERP. \n \n25. \n\nADB and the government have agreed that MOTC will continue to \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \npromptly  inform  ADB  of  the  occurrence  of  any  risks  or  impacts,  with  a  detailed \ndescription of the event and proposed corrective action plan if any unanticipated \nenvironmental  and/or  social  risks  and  impacts  arise  during  construction, \nimplementation, or operation of the project that are not considered in the EIA and \nthe EMP; \npromptly report any actual or potential breach of compliance with measures and \nrequirements set forth in the EMP after becoming aware of the breach; and \n\n                                                 \n12 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from http://www.adb.org/projects/42399-023/documents). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nsubmit at least semiannual monitoring reports during project construction, and at \nleast annual reports during operation. \n \n\n26. \nThe  project  was  initially  classified  as  resettlement  category  C  and  indigenous  peoples \ncategory  C.  Upon  the  finalization  of  detailed  design,  it  was  reconfirmed  that  no  indigenous \npeoples  reside  in  the  project  area,  however,  11  roadside  mobile  trailer  units  providing \nrudimentary accommodation and refreshment facilities at the border-holding area will have to be \nrelocated about 100 meters away due to road rehabilitation and construction of a roadside truck \nparking  facility.  Accordingly,  the  project  is  reclassified  as  resettlement  category  B;  a \nresettlement plan was prepared and discussed with affected persons. The indigenous peoples \ncategory C remains unchanged. Preparatory work for the relocation of mobile trailers is ongoing \nwith the  actual  reallocation  planned  in mid-2015 when  the  harsh  winter  is  over. The  additional \nfinancing  will  not  entail  any  additional  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  and  is  classified  as \nresettlement category C. However, for any mitigation on unanticipated involuntary resettlement \nimpacts,  MOTC  will  consult  with  ADB  and  prepare  an  appropriate  plan  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nNo significant risks are presented in the risk assessment and risk mitigation plan.13 The \n27. \nrisks  of  construction  delays  and  cost  overruns  as  identified  for  the  project  are  addressed \nthrough the additional financing. Government counterpart funding, as covenanted in the current \nloan  agreement,  is  not  a  major  concern  despite  procedural  delays  at  times.  For  the  other \nmedium  risk  identified  for  the  project,  i.e.,  sustainability  of  road  operation  and  maintenance, \nmitigation plans continue and include strict imposition of vehicle weight and dimensions limits, a \nseparate  line  item  in  MOTC\u2019s  annual  budget  for  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  Road  Department, \ntechnical assistance projects provided by development partners for improving road maintenance \npractices  and  optimizing  revenues  from  road  users  followed  by  suitable  dialogue  with  the \ngovernment,  and  project  support  for  the  learning  and  development  program  for  MOTC  and \nrelated agency staff. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n28. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and loan documents.  \n \n29. \nset forth in the financing agreement. \n \n\nThe  government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\n30. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n\n(i) \n\n \nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR7,258,000  to  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic for the additional financing of the CAREC Corridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart \nRoad) Project 3, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at \n\n                                                 \n13 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f(ii) \n\nthe  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter;
