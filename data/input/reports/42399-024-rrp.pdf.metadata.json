THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kyrgyz Republic for additional financing of the \nCAREC Corridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road) Project 3.1 The design and monitoring framework \nfor the project is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The additional financing will cover cost overruns that have resulted in a funding gap for \nthe project whose rationale remains valid and physical progress on track. The project, by \nimproving the last 60-kilometer (km) bottleneck section of the Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) Corridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road), will contribute to fostering regional \ntrade between the Kyrgyz Republic and the People's Republic of China (PRC) and higher \nmobility for people in Naryn Province where poverty is widespread. It will also help increase \nsustainability of the national road network by training staff on infrastructure management. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The terrain of the Kyrgyz Republic is dominated by the Tian Shan and Pamir mountain \nsystems, which together occupy about 65% of the country. Trade and travel in this landlocked \ncountry are highly dependent on road transport. Endorsed under the CAREC Transport and \nTrade Facilitation Strategy,2 the approximate 539 km Bishkek\u2013Torugart road forms part of the \nCAREC Transport Corridor 1 and has several important functions. The road, part of the old Silk \nRoad that once linked Europe with what is now the PRC, is the shortest thoroughfare from \nKashi, a vibrant cultural and trade center in the PRC, to consumer markets in northern Kyrgyz \nRepublic and beyond. It is also the only north\u2013south trunk road in central Kyrgyz Republic, \nwhere the city of Naryn, in particular, depends heavily on it for connecting to the rest of the \ncountry. It is the only road that provides direct access at present to Issyk Kul lake region, one of \nCentral Asia's best-known tourist destinations with a huge growth potential. However, costly, \nunreliable, and unsafe travel caused by the poor road conditions has hampered social and \neconomic development along the road corridor, particularly for Naryn Province. \n \n4.  As one of the key development partners for the country\u2019s roads, ADB financed the \nimprovement of 114 km (km 365\u2013479) of the road corridor in 2008 and 2009,3 and helped the \ngovernment strengthen trade ties with its neighbors through CAREC. In 2010 the Government \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China financed the improvement of 223 km (most of km 9\u2013272), and \nin 2012 the Islamic Development Bank financed the improvement of 93 km (km 272\u2013365) of the \nroad corridor. The project will improve the 60 km section from At Beit to Torugart (km 479\u2013539) \nat the Kyrgyz Republic\u2013PRC border, the last segment of the road corridor. Together with the \nimprovement works in other sections and the corridor\u2019s full opening to traffic by 2017, this will \nenable  all-weather  smooth  flow  of  local  traffic  between  Bishkek  and  Torugart,  as  well  as \ninternational through-traffic from the PRC to Central Asia and beyond, unleashing one of the key \nconstraints to national and regional trade competitiveness and inclusive growth. Apart from the \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2011.

Manila. ", "2 \neconomic  benefits  of  time  savings,  reliability,  and  reduced  transport  costs,  better  road \nconditions and protective structures will help reduce the risk of accidental toxic spills and \nmaterial runoff from vehicles, therefore benefiting the ecosystem of nearby Chatyr Kul Lake\u2014a \nwetland of international significance protected under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. The \nproject will also support a long-term, results-oriented program of learning and development for \nthe Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) and other government staff. It will result \nin  better-informed  staff,  equipped  to  champion  strategies  for  reducing  life-cycle  costs  and \nimproving user cost recovery.4 \n \n5.  The project road site conditions are unique\u2014elevation is over 3,000 meters and the \nweather allows only about 5 months (May\u2013October) in a year for any construction work; the \nground is permanently frozen, and part of the road alignment is close to a unique wetland. Civil \nworks were procured using a tailored design\u2013build delivery method to share the cost and risk of \ndesign  changes  between  the  project  executing  agency  and  the  contractor,  and  allow  the \ncontractor to bring more economical and relevant technology and construction methods to the \nsite. Detailed engineering investigations by the contractor and the construction supervision \nconsultant  indicate  that  additional  engineering  measures  (mainly  increasing  the  road \nembankment height, using suitable subgrade materials, and installing additional road drainage \nsystems) are necessary to address the unforeseen frost heaves in some sections. This will help \nprevent premature pavement failure caused by pavement cracking and extend road service life. \n \n6.  The project was approved in June 2011 with a loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSDR35,041,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan became effective in February \n2012 and will close on 31 March 2016. Contract packages for the works and construction \nsupervision and environmental management were awarded in 2012. The project has been \nperforming well with cumulative contract awards at 89% and disbursements at 62% as of 30 \nOctober 2014.5 The present project performance rating is on track. \n \n7.  Additional  financing.  The  total  project  cost  has  increased  by  $18  million,  from  \n$70 million in 2011 to $88 million in 2014. The cost overruns, resulting from the detailed \nengineering design under the design\u2013build delivery arrangement, are attributed to corrective \nengineering measures and input price increases. The government has accordingly requested \nfinancing to achieve the project\u2019s intended outputs with greater technical quality. Given that \nadditional engineering measures by nature are an integral part of ongoing civil works, additional \nfinancing is deemed a more suitable instrument than options of restructuring, scaling down, \nand/or canceling the project. This is because (i) the project will either not be completed to \nrequired standards or not delivered in full if cost overruns are not met, therefore unable to fully \nmeet  its  development  objectives;  (ii)  the  project  provided  with  additional  financing  can  be \ncompleted within 2 years of the current loan closing date; and (iii) possible risks associated with \nthe project, including procurement delays, high bid prices, construction delays, and further cost \noverruns, have been properly mitigated and/or addressed. \n \n8.  Eligibility  of  additional  financing.  The  project  is  in  an  advanced  stage  of \nimplementation and the government accords high priority to this additional financing to meet \ncost overruns.6 The development objectives remain unchanged with the additional financing. \nThe project fits with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 20207 and aligns with the country \n                                                \n4  Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n5  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  The government requested the additional financing on 23 July 2014 when cost overruns were identified, and \nincluded in the forthcoming ADB country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017 for the Kyrgyz Republic. \n7  ADB. 2014.

As such, the \nadditional financing meets the eligibility criteria in ADB\u2019s Additional Financing Policy. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact and outcome for the revised project will remain unchanged from those for the \noriginal project, as the additional financing will not materially change the project scope and size. \nThe project impact will be increased regional trade, particularly between the Kyrgyz Republic \nand the PRC. The outcome will be higher mobility for people and goods with origins and \ndestinations in the road corridor between Naryn and Torugart. \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The project outputs are unchanged with the additional financing. The primary output will \nbe  60  km  of  two-lane  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  (km  479\u2013539)  repaired,  rehabilitated,  or \nreconstructed to national category III road standards with a roadside truck parking facility and \nspecial features for protecting the environment, preserving the road structure, and reducing \nvehicle crashes. This will be delivered through the civil works component. The second output \nwill be improved infrastructure management skills of MOTC and other government agency staff, \nachieved through training, education, and mentoring by national and international consultants. \n \nD.

The government has requested (i) a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR7.258 \nmillion; and (ii) a grant not exceeding $4.3 million, both from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, to \nprovide additional financing for the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  financing \nagreement.

Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The implementation arrangements have not changed, as summarized in Table 3 and \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual (PAM).9 MOTC continues to be the \nexecuting agency. MOTC\u2019s investment projects implementation group (IPIG) continues to be \nresponsible for day-to-day administration of project activities. IPIG was established in 1996 and \nhas since implemented more than 12 road projects financed by development partners. Its \nproject delivery performance has been satisfactory and staff have adequate technical skills and \nunderstanding of ADB procedures to manage the project. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2015\u2013August 2017 \nEstimated completion date  31 August 2017 (loan and grant closing date: 31 December 2017) \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Ministry of Finance \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Transport and Communications \n(iii) Key implementing agencies  Investment project implementation group \n(iv) Implementation unit  Bishkek, 29 staff  \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  Completed \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  Completed \nConsultants\u2019 qualifications selectiona  Ongoing \nIndividual consultantsb  Ongoing \nAdvance contracting  Not required, as main works and services have been procured. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to \ntime)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the \ngovernment and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \na Consulting services for environmental monitoring, technical auditing, and financial auditing. \nb Consulting services for investment project implementation group support and staff skills development. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                \n9  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \n \n14.  This additional financing will not require new procurement of civil works, as the additional \nscope for treatment of frost heaves is an integral part of the ongoing civil works.10 As such, \nMOTC will issue contract variations to incorporate it into the scope of the existing civil works \ncontract. Likewise, associated supervision of these additional works will be added through a \nvariation to the existing construction supervision contract. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n15.  The design\u2013build delivery method was adopted for the project in view of unique site \nconditions, limitations of national standard specifications, output quality, and economy. The \ndetailed engineering assessment conducted by the contractor and the construction supervision \nconsultant,  including  an  independent  technical  expert,  noted  the  need  for  some  design \nimprovements to mitigate likely pavement cracking arising from unforeseen frost heaves in \nsome  road  sections. The  associated corrective  engineering measures  also  respond to the \nclimate risk assessment, which identifies the large temperature variation as a main climate \nchange impact on the project road. The measures include (i) additional drainage layers in \nwaterlogged areas to reduce the likelihood of capillary action into the pavement layers and \ndeeper side drainage wherever required; (ii) additional subgrade layer of about 30 centimeters \nfor km 502\u2013532 to raise the pavement layers above the high water table; and (iii) removal of soft \nspots and replacement with suitable fill materials. Such corrective measures are essential to \nensure that the finished road surface meets the quality requirements for road maintainability, \nsafety, and comfort.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n16.  Rehabilitation  and/or  reconstruction  of  the  60  km  section  between  km  479  on  the \nBishkek\u2013Naryn\u2013Torugart (BNT) road and the border with the PRC near Torugart will provide for \nan increasing volume of road traffic, and reduce the transit time for goods and passengers. The \nproject is designed to reduce vehicle operating costs and lower travel times for domestic and \nregional travel through the provision of a higher quality route. This will facilitate national and \nregional trade and reduce poverty by improving access for rural communities to market, health, \nand education facilities. This project is part of a wider, multiagency BNT road rehabilitation and \nupgrading program. Completion of the 60 km section, in addition to providing benefits to users, \nwill serve to protect benefits produced by rehabilitation of other sections of the entire BNT road.  \n \n17.  For the project, which is experiencing cost overruns, a reduced project scope would \nleave the last-mile bottleneck unattended, hence impairing the full functionality of the 539 km \nBNT road corridor. A substandard road with the same project scope would require higher and \nmore frequent maintenance and shorten the road service life, leading to higher life-cycle costs \nthan would the outcome with additional capital financing. As such, the option of additional \nfinancing is considered an appropriate solution. An economic evaluation comparing with- and \nwithout-project  scenarios  was  undertaken  for  km  479\u2013539.  The  economic  benefits  include  \n(i) vehicle operating cost savings and (ii) travel time savings. The results of the economic \nevaluation show that the project yields an average economic internal rate of return of 12.3%, \nmoreover, considering that the project will yield benefits in terms of economic development, \n                                                \n10 The beneficiary will use the current loan to the extent possible before utilizing the additional financing from the loan \nand grant on a pro rata basis for contract payments, as described in the PAM. \n ", "6 \ncomfort, and reliability of travel that are not monetized in the economic analysis, the project can \nbe deemed to be economically viable. 11 \n \n18.  The government has increased the road maintenance budget continuously, despite fiscal \nconstraints. State budget allocations for road maintenance increased from Som221.6 million in \n2005 to Som1.85 billion in 2013. While long-term maintenance needs are still underfinanced, \nthis  budget  outlay  is  expected  to  increase  in  the  coming  years;  in  the  meantime,  road \nmaintenance continues to be prioritized by the perceived importance of road corridors. \n \nC.  Governance \n19.  MOTC\u2019s  IPIG  has  been  following  ADB\u2019s  safeguards,  procurement  and  financial \nmanagement guidelines, policies, and procedures for implementing road projects since 1996, \nand has implemented more than 10 ADB road projects totaling more than $300 million. IPIG \nstaff  have  adequate  knowledge,  understanding,  and  experience  with  ADB  procedures  to \nmanage the project. IPIG has satisfactory capacity for project financial accounting and a proven \ntrack record with ADB\u2019s disbursement procedures. A private audit firm acceptable to ADB has \naudited the project financial statements annually. Past audit reports on ADB projects have not \nhighlighted any irregularities. The risk for the project\u2019s financial management arrangements \nduring implementation is considered moderate. MOTC will conduct periodic technical audits of \nthe work of the supervision consultant and contractor as part of its increased oversight of \ncontracts for works, services, and goods. MOTC will train its staff under the skills development \ncomponent of the project, and introduce internal financial audits and technical audits. \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Ministry of Finance and MOTC. Key measures to ensure proper governance include  \n(i)  independent  external  auditing  of  contracts,  project  accounts,  and  financial  statements;\n  \n(ii)  transparent  decision  processes  for  all  procurement  matters;  and  (iii)  verification  of \ncontractors\u2019  payment  claims  by  the  supervising  consultant,  and  oversight  by  the  project \nimplementation unit. IPIG staff responsible for procurement and contract administration are \naware of and understand the requirements. The requirements and supplementary measures \nincluded in all contracts are described in the PAM.  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n21.  When viewed in the context of the entire BNT road, the project will bring significant \nbenefits to the people of Naryn Province and the Kyrgyz Republic as a whole, and will have \npositive impacts on poverty reduction in the PRC. The 30% reduction in trip times and vehicle \noperating costs from Torugart to Naryn will increase activity at the freight transit center in Naryn \ncity. This will create more jobs and increase demand for local services. People residing along \nthe  road  will  be  able  to  find  employment  in  physical  works  and  ancillary  services  during \nconstruction. The increase in traffic will help sustain the service businesses that people started \nduring  construction.  Civil  works  and  service  contracts  financed  by  ADB  will  require  equal \nemployment  opportunities,  equal  wages for  equal  work,  and full  observance  of  core  labor \nstandards. The government has gradually increased border and internal security monitoring, \nand will implement a national road safety awareness program in local communities. These \nmeasures will help prevent possible negative social effects such as traffic accidents, human and \ndrug trafficking, and spread of sexually transmitted infections, which may result from increased \ntravel and trade. \n                                                \n11 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nE.  Safeguards \n22.  The project classification of A for environment reflects the fact that about 35 km of the \nroad passes through the Karatal\u2013Japaryk State Nature Reserve in close proximity to Chatyr Kul \nLake, which is a Ramsar-protected wetland area. The additional financing will not entail any \nadditional environmental impacts, and is classified as environment category C. ADB assisted \nthe government in conducting an environmental impact assessment, which shows that (i) the \nimpacts during construction are mostly acute, temporary, and reversible, with the exception of \npossible hazardous materials spills and operations of borrow pits; (ii) potential impacts during \noperations are expected to be much greater as the road has a design life of 20 years, and \npollutants entering the Chatyr Kul aquatic ecosystem could be accumulated because the lake \nhas no outlet; (iii) some improvements in dust, noise, and vibration are expected; and (iv) long-\nterm impacts caused by increased traffic, vehicle emissions, and possible spills of hazardous \nmaterials pose potential risks to the Chatyr Kul ecosystem and other wildlife in the state nature \nreserve, including migrating birds. \n \n23.  The draft environmental impact assessment report was discussed with stakeholders and \ndisclosed to the public in November 2010; it was subsequently updated prior to commencing \ncivil  works  and  publicly  disclosed  in  January  2014. 12  The  report  contains  a  two-track \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) for pollutant source control and receptor (biodiversity) \nprotection.  The  control  and  protection  measures  include  speed  limits,  road  signs,  special \npermits  for  hazardous  material  movement;  hydraulic  structures  such  as  retention  ponds, \ncontained borrow sites, and diversion channels to prevent runoff pollutants and accidentally \nspilled toxic substances from entering the wetlands; and equipment and training for emergency \nresponse. \n \n24.  The environmental monitoring program includes monthly monitoring by the contractor \nand quarterly ecological monitoring by the supervision consultant together with Karatal\u2013Japaryk \nState Nature Reserve staff. The special monitoring plan for the borrow sites is included in the \nborrow  pit  management  plan,  which  ADB  and  the  local  authority  of the  State  Agency  for \nEnvironmental Protection and Forestry have both approved. An ecological response plan (ERP) \nwas  prepared  to  supplement  the  EMP  and  is  being  implemented.  The  plan  includes  a \ncomprehensive  capacity  building  program  for  management  of  the  state  nature  reserve.  In \naddition  to  the  supervision  consultant,  who  has  been  working  with  MOTC  during  project \nimplementation, MOTC has recruited an experienced international environment consultant to \nassist project implementation unit staff in developing the ERP as outlined in the EMP, providing \nguidance to the supervision consultant and contractor, and supervising implementation of the \nEMP and ERP. \n \n25.  ADB and the government have agreed that MOTC will continue to \n \n(i)  promptly inform ADB of the occurrence of any risks or impacts, with a detailed \ndescription of the event and proposed corrective action plan if any unanticipated \nenvironmental  and/or  social  risks  and  impacts  arise  during  construction, \nimplementation, or operation of the project that are not considered in the EIA and \nthe EMP; \n(ii)  promptly report any actual or potential breach of compliance with measures and \nrequirements set forth in the EMP after becoming aware of the breach; and \n                                                \n12 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from http://www.adb.org/projects/42399-023/documents). \n ", "8 \n(iii)  submit at least semiannual monitoring reports during project construction, and at \nleast annual reports during operation. \n \n26.  The project was initially classified as resettlement category C and indigenous peoples \ncategory C. Upon the finalization of detailed design, it was reconfirmed that no indigenous \npeoples  reside  in  the  project  area,  however,  11  roadside  mobile  trailer  units  providing \nrudimentary accommodation and refreshment facilities at the border-holding area will have to be \nrelocated about 100 meters away due to road rehabilitation and construction of a roadside truck \nparking  facility.  Accordingly,  the  project  is  reclassified  as  resettlement  category  B;  a \nresettlement plan was prepared and discussed with affected persons. The indigenous peoples \ncategory C remains unchanged. Preparatory work for the relocation of mobile trailers is ongoing \nwith the actual reallocation planned in mid-2015 when the harsh winter is over. The additional \nfinancing will not entail any additional involuntary resettlement impacts and is classified as \nresettlement category C. However, for any mitigation on unanticipated involuntary resettlement \nimpacts, MOTC will consult with ADB and prepare an appropriate plan in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n27.  No significant risks are presented in the risk assessment and risk mitigation plan.13 The \nrisks  of  construction  delays  and  cost  overruns  as  identified  for  the  project  are  addressed \nthrough the additional financing. Government counterpart funding, as covenanted in the current \nloan agreement, is not a major concern despite procedural delays at times. For the other \nmedium risk identified for the project, i.e., sustainability of road operation and maintenance, \nmitigation plans continue and include strict imposition of vehicle weight and dimensions limits, a \nseparate  line  item  in  MOTC\u2019s  annual  budget  for  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  Road  Department, \ntechnical assistance projects provided by development partners for improving road maintenance \npractices  and  optimizing  revenues  from  road  users  followed  by  suitable  dialogue  with  the \ngovernment, and project support for the learning and development program for MOTC and \nrelated agency staff. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n28.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and loan documents.  \n \n29.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the financing agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n30.
