THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the Madhya Pradesh State Roads Project III. The report also describes proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building for Road Safety and Public\u2013Private Participation \n(PPP) Support, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The Madhya Pradesh State Roads Project III will rehabilitate and upgrade about 1,080 \nkilometers  (km)  of  state  highways  in  Madhya  Pradesh  identified  under  the  state  road \nrehabilitation program. These severely deteriorated highway sections are located in the very \npoor eastern and west central parts of the state. The project will involve upgrading existing \nroads to two or intermediate lanes,2 strengthening existing pavement, strengthening culverts \nand bridges, and constructing new bridges and cross-draining structures. Consulting services \nwill be provided to supervise the implementation of civil works. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Under  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2009\u20132012,3  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) supports all levels of road sector development as a core infrastructure operation to \nfacilitate sustainable economic growth in India. The proposed project is consistent with the \ncountry partnership strategy\u2019s strategic objectives and was included in the country operations \nbusiness plan, 2011\u20132013.4 \n \n4.  In India, road transport accounts for 68% of freight movement and 87% of passenger \ntraffic. The national highways and the state highways (i.e., the secondary road system) are \nunable to cope with rapid traffic growth; freight traffic on these roads has increased by about \n12% per year and passenger traffic by about 8% per year over the past decade. These trends \nhave led to congestion, road deterioration, and increased transport costs. State highways, which \nlink national highways with district headquarters and important towns, comprise about 13% of \nthe road network and carry about 40% of traffic. \n \n5.  The state highway network in Madhya Pradesh comprises 10,249 km of state highways, \nbut road conditions are very poor in terms of coverage and condition and cannot cope with the \nincreasing demand for road transport. As a poverty reduction strategy, the Madhya Pradesh \ngovernment  has  encouraged  infrastructure-led  growth  in  the  last  5  years  by  successfully \nrehabilitating  about  7,400  km5  of  state  highways  with  ADB  assistance,6  PPP,  and  state \nresources. The gross domestic product growth was in the 5%\u20136% range for the last 5 years and \nis poised to reach 7% growth by 2015, closing the gap with national growth. Achieving this goal \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Between one and two lane road. \n3  ADB. 2009.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grant to India for the Madhya Pradesh State Roads Sector Project II. \nManila (Loan 2330-IND). Under these two projects, ADB has assisted the government in the rehabilitation of 2,907 \nkm of state highways. ", " 2 \nrequires continued efforts in infrastructure development initiatives by rehabilitating the remaining \n2,807 km state highways in the next few years. The government of Madhya Pradesh decided to \nrehabilitate 665 km with state resources, 771 km under PPP schemes, and requested ADB for \npossible financing of remaining 1,080 km, which are mostly in the very poor areas of the state \n(i.e., the eastern and west central areas of Madhya Pradesh) and, are not at par with the rest of \nthe state in development; therefore, it is essential to improve these missing links to gain social \nand economic development opportunities from road networks for the entire Madhya Pradesh \npopulation.  \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s first involvement in Madhya Pradesh\u2019s state road sector, the Madhya Pradesh \nState Roads Sector Development Program, was successfully completed in 2008, with significant \nsector  reform  including  the  establishment  of  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Road  Development \nCorporation (MPRDC) and its adoption of best practices for road planning and maintenance \nsystems, financial management, and public procurement. MPSRSP II, approved in 2007, is \nongoing, targeting completion in December 2011. \n \n7.  The project will continue ADB support for the development of the remaining Madhya \nPradesh  state  highway  network  that  are  not  yet  upgraded  and  road  safety  capacity \nenhancement of MPRDC to build upon the success of the organization as an implementation \nagency and to transform it into a full-fledged state highway agency.  Based on lessons learned \nand  achievements  of  the  previous  two  projects,  the  project  will  bring  added  value  to  the \nfollowing four aspects: (i) minimizing impact of climate change through proper engineering \ndesign,  and  measures  towards  \"green\"  highway  has  been  adopted  by  using  extensive \nvegetative control in addition to structural measures to combat erosion, and 1:7 compensatory \nreforestation which is more than the statutory requirement of 1:2; (ii) addressing road safety in \nmodern  technology;  (iii)  engaging  gender  expert  to  promote  gender  awareness;  and  (iv) \npreparing long-term strategy for PPP for larger private sector participation in road network \ndevelopment and maintenance. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The long-term impact of the project will be accelerated economic growth in Madhya \nPradesh. The immediate project outcome will be more efficient, sustainable transport operations \nof the state highway network. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n9.  The project outputs will be (i) about 1,080 km of state highways identified under the state \nroad rehabilitation program rehabilitated and upgraded (Table 1), and (ii) improved MPRDC \ncapacity for road safety.  \n \n10.  The project will provide (i) consulting services to support implementation of the civil \nworks; and (ii) equipment necessary for MPRDC to enhance road safety, which include safety \ntraining, vehicle fitness testing, and a road accident emergency response system. \n ", "  3\nTable 1: ADB-Funded Project Roads \n \nLength \nNo.  Name of Roads  SH No.  (km) \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The implementation arrangements for the project basically follow those of the ongoing \nMPSRSP II. The executing agency for the project will be the Madhya Pradesh government, \nacting through MPRDC. MPRDC is wholly owned by the Madhya Pradesh government and has \nbeen equipped with adequate capacity to implement the project. A general manager at MPRDC \nheadquarters has been designated as person in charge for project implementation. MPRDC has \nseven division offices (i.e., Bhopal, Gwalior, Indore, Jabalpur, Sagar, Rewa, and Ujjain) acting \nas project implementation units (PIUs), each headed by a divisional manager, which will be \nresponsible for project road implementation in the field. Each PIU will be responsible for one to \ntwo contracts, depending on the location of the subprojects, and one project manager will be \nassigned to each contract package. The project managers will be delegated with adequate \ntechnical and administrative authority for expeditious project implementation. The Environmental \nand Social Cell at MPRDC headquarters, reporting to the general manager, will be responsible \nfor ensuring compliance with environmental and social safeguards of project roads. MPRDC will \nengage construction supervision consultants to act as engineers for the construction contracts.   \n \n15.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual (PAM).7 \n \n                                                 \n7  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n16.  Capacity development TA in the amount of $1,250,000 equivalent is proposed to be \nprovided to further support the MPRDC initiatives of institutional development, especially for \nroad safety through the establishment of a road accident emergency response system, and \nPPP,  for  larger  private  sector  participation  in  state  highway  network  development  and \nmaintenance. ADB will provide TA not exceeding the amount of $1,000,000 equivalent, and the \nMadhya Pradesh government will provide $250,000 equivalent as counterpart funds. \n \n17.  The TA will be financed with a grant basis from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special \nFund  (TASF\u2013other  sources).  An  international  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  by  ADB  in \naccordance with the ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). About 18 person-months of international and 64 person-months of national experts will be \nrequired. Consultants will be asked to submit simplified technical proposals, and the selection \nwill  be  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  using  a  \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. The terms of reference for institutional development are set out in the \nPAM. The consultants will identify the specification and timing of other equipment required \nduring TA implementation and conduct training and workshops as required. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n18.  The project was prepared with the enhanced capacity of MPRDC, which was gained \nthrough the previous two loans and TA provided for capacity building (footnote 6). MPRDC \nengaged  consultants  with  its  own  funds  to  prepare  detailed  design  documents  for  roads \nproposed  for  ADB  financing,  incorporating  ADB  requirements  of  economic,  social,  and \nenvironmental  studies  into  the  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference.  The  Madhya  Pradesh \ngovernment asked ADB for TA to conduct due diligence to ensure that the consultants\u2019 work \n ", " 6 \nfully complies with ADB requirements.8 The engineering design was prepared to avoid or to \nminimize land acquisition as well as social and environmental impacts, and to take road safety \ninto account. In addition, advance actions have been taken to ensure that the construction can \ncommence early. All of these measures have improved project readiness and will mitigate the \nrisk of delay. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n19.  An economic evaluation of the project was conducted by comparing the MPRDC and \nuser costs with and without the project over a specific period. The evaluation was carried out for \neach of the 15 project road sections using the Highway Development and Management (HDM-\n4) Model. These sections are in poor to very poor condition. The proposed improvements \ninclude rehabilitation and widening, and the principal benefits expected from the proposed \nupgrading are in terms of savings in vehicle operating costs and travel time. The traffic demand \nforecast for all project roads was made based on data available on vehicle growth, GDP growth, \nthe elasticity of transport growth to GDP growth, and the economic and population growth \noutlook for the analysis period. \n \n20.  The estimated economic internal rate of return for the 15 roads varies from 18.3% to \n45.5%, indicating high economic rates of return for all project road sections. Sensitivity tests \ncarried out included (i) construction costs increased by 15%, (ii) no time benefits considered, (iii) \ntraffic growth rates reduced by 15%, (iv) benefits decreased by 15%, and (v) a combination of (i) \nand (iv). The analysis shows that all roads have an economic internal rate of return higher than \n12% in all sensitivity tests, indicating economic viability within the range of variability anticipated. \nOverall, the project is justified in social cost\u2013benefit terms.9  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n21.  Institutional capacity. A project preparatory TA consultant and a capacity development \nTA consultant from MPSRSP II supplemented MPRDC during project preparation. MPRDC\u2019s \ncapacity for implementation will be further supported by a supervision consultant, who will assist \nwith the supervision of civil works. For long-term capacity strengthening, TA will be provided to \nmake MPRDC more effective in road safety and PPP management. \n \n22.  Financial  management.  MPRDC  has  ongoing  experience  with  implementing  \nADB-funded projects (footnote 6). It has satisfactory capacity for project financial accounting \nand  sufficient  knowledge  of  ADB  disbursement  procedures.  For  the  project,  MPRDC  will \nmaintain separate records and accounts to identify goods and services financed from the loan \nproceeds, expenditures incurred, and the use of local funds under the project components.10  \n \n23.  Procurement. All procurement of goods and works financed wholly or in part by ADB \nwill be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from \ntime  to  time).  Paper-based  procurement  will  be  used  for  all  contracts.  Bidders  will  be  \npost-qualified by applying a single-stage two-envelope bidding procedure. Prior reviews by ADB \nwill be conducted at key steps in the procurement process. All consulting services will be \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2009.

", "  7\nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \n24.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  Madhya  Pradesh  government  and  MPRDC.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM and loan agreement. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n25.  Madhya Pradesh is one of the largest and the most populous states in India. It is also \none of the poorest. About 38% of its 77 million people live below the official poverty line, \ncompared to about 35% for India as a whole. The first half of this decade saw a real gross \ndomestic product growth rate of less than 5% for the state, which was about half of the national \ngrowth.  Its  rural\u2013urban  ratio  of  the  population  is  74:26.  Agriculture  is  the  main  livelihood, \nfollowed by allied services, trade, business, and daily wage work. \n \n26.  In the poverty and social assessment survey of 1,414 households and 55 focus group \ndiscussions in which both men and women participated, respondents stated that the project will \nprovide villages with better access and enhanced mobility. Improved connectivity will facilitate \ntravel to district headquarters, other local government, development agencies, health centers, \nschools, colleges, and markets, and will also improve social networking. The project will have a \nshort-term impact on poverty reduction, as the rural poor will be hired for construction, tree \nplanting,  and  routine  maintenance  works.  These  opportunities  will  increase  the  livelihood \nopportunities  for  the  poor,  who  now  depend  largely  on  occasional,  uncertain  employment. \nFurthermore, the project will increase new economic and employment opportunities by providing \nimproved links to markets, production centers, and other areas of economic activities. Better \ntransport  will  help  the  rural  population  move  their  produce  faster  and  obtain  higher  profit \nmargins,  as  they  will  not  depend  solely  on  local  markets  and  middlemen.  As  such,  it  is \nestimated that 5,416,647 people will experience the economic benefits brought about by the \nproject. 11 \n \n27.  Gender. Women in the project area are largely involved in household work, cultivation, \nand other agricultural activities, including some employment in government and the private \nsector. Their use of roads ranges from day-to-day household activities to economic activities, \nsuch  as  for  agriculture  and  marketing.  The improved  road  conditions  and connectivity  will \nprovide better access for women and children to social services, markets, work places, higher \nlevels of education, health facilities, and employment opportunities. Travel time savings due to \nenhanced road conditions will result in more time spent on productive activities, health care, and \nself-development.  \n \n28.  In the 55 focus group discussions, stakeholders expressed their concern regarding road \nsafety  during  construction.  They  suggested  that  advance  notice  of  the  road  construction \nschedule, appropriate road signs, and other road safety measures be put in place during project \nimplementation. The suggestions have been incorporated in the project. Provisions are in the \nbidding documents for the contractors to ensure that all civil works will comply with all applicable \nlabor  laws;  not  employ  child  labor  for  construction  and  maintenance  activities;  encourage \nemployment of the poor, particularly women; and not differentiate wages between men and \nwomen, particularly for work of equal value. To ensure that these and other gender issues are \naddressed, a gender specialist will be engaged under the construction supervision consultant to \n                                                 \n11 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", " 8 \ndesign and implement a gender awareness program, including road safety for the stakeholders \nof the project. \n \n29.  To further assess the impact of ADB-funded road projects (footnote 7) on women, a \nseparate gender impact study12 was carried out. The findings of the study show that the ADB-\nfunded  road  projects  brought  forth  opportunities  to  achieve  better  economic,  health,  and \neducation access to the women. \n \n30.  HIV/AIDS. Madhya Pradesh is categorized as a low-prevalence state with regard to \nHIV/AIDS.  As  a  part  of  the  National  AIDS  Control  Program  of  the  National  AIDS  Control \nOrganisation,  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State  AIDS  Control  Society  has  been  conducting  HIV \nsentinel surveillance and organizing AIDS awareness campaigns in the state. However, during \nfocus group discussions, groups of women have expressed that there is still a need to increase \nHIV/AIDS awareness. The detailed poverty and social assessment study carried out during \nproject preparatory TA does not anticipate any specific risks, such as a rise in the incidence of \nHIV/AIDS, as the result of the project. A provision has been kept in the bidding documents \nrequiring  the  contractors  to  disseminate  information  at  worksites  on  the  risks  of  sexually \ntransmitted infections and HIV/AIDS for those employed during the construction phase. The \ngender specialist will also design and implement an HIV/AIDS awareness program for the \nproject stakeholders. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n31.  Environmental impact. There are no environmentally sensitive features in the proposed \nproject. Hence, it has been classified as category B in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009). Accordingly, initial environmental examination reports have been prepared \nfor all 15 subprojects. All environmental management plans have been attached to the bidding \ndocument prior to issuance. \n  \n32.  The  main  environmental  concerns  with  respect  to  the  project  are  (i)  air  and  noise \npollution, (ii) soil erosion of road embankments and erosion due to operation of borrow areas, (iii) \nsiltation and contamination of water bodies, (iv) occupational and community health and safety, \n(v) generation of construction debris and domestic waste in camp sites, (vi) traffic congestion \nand other inconveniences, and (vii) poor drainage and cutting of trees existing in the right-of-\nway  (ROW).  Most  of  these  issues  are  expected  to  be  short  term  and  restricted  to  the \nconstruction phase only. Necessary mitigation measures are proposed in the environmental \nmanagement plans to address all of these issues. The plans will be implemented mainly by the \ncontractor during the construction phase and by MPRDC during operation. The Environmental \nand Social Cell of MPRDC will be responsible for monitoring plan implementation with the \nsupport from the PIUs and supervision consultants. A grievance redress mechanism will be \nestablished within the PIUs and MPRDC, and local communities will be informed of its existence. \n \n33.  The project has been designed with the aim of minimizing the impact of climate change. \nSuch  an  impact  was  assessed  in  terms  of  increased  surface  temperature,  droughts,  and \nflooding in certain areas, as well as fewer forests and less biodiversity. Drainage structures in \nthe project have been designed to accommodate increased water flow, and road embankment \nlevels have been planned in accordance with flood levels. Measures toward \u201cgreen\u201d highways \nhave also been adopted, such as enhancing the environmental functions of the watersheds by \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2010. Impact of Transport Project on Women: A Case Study of Madhya Pradesh State Roads (Loan 1959 \nand Loan 2330). December (draft). ", "  9\nusing extensive vegetative control in addition to structural measures to combat erosion; 1:7 \ncompensatory reforestation, which is more than the statutory requirement of 1:2; preservation of \ntrees through minor geometric realignments; exclusive use of native tree species in reforestation; \nand  inclusion  of  tree  survival  as  part  of  post-project  monitoring.  In  contrast  to  traditional \napproaches,  all  roadside  plantations  will  be  maintained  by  contractors  for  2  years  after \nestablishment and continued by MPRDC thereafter. Accordingly, provisions have been made in \nthe bidding document. The project will have a negligible effect on agriculture and surface \nhydrology, and is likely to improve the livelihood around the project road areas in the long term. \n \n34.  Land acquisition and resettlement. A due diligence survey was undertaken for all \nproject  roads,  based  on  the  detailed  designs  and  strip  plans,  to  assess  likely  involuntary \nresettlement  impacts.  Based  on  the  assessment,  there  will  be  no  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement impacts since the project is confined to the rehabilitation and upgrading of existing \nroad alignments. The project roads are categorized as category C in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement.  \n \n35.  MPRDC adopted the approach of avoiding and minimizing impacts on land, structures, \nand common property resources through feasible technical designs. As such, the project will \nfocus on improvement of roads within the existing ROW. In the built-up areas along some \nstretches of the road sections that require a width of 12 meters, resettlement impacts on \nroadside  structures  will  be  avoided  by  adopting  appropriate  technical  solutions,  including \nreducing road width, adjusting junction improvement, covering line drains within the available \nROW, and following existing bypasses to divert congested clusters. \n \n36.  Impact on indigenous peoples. The project roads are categorized as category C for \nindigenous peoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Scheduled tribes, \nsuch as the Baiga and Gonda, are present in sample project road sections. However, since the \nproject  is  confined  to  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  existing  road  alignments,  the  social \nassessments undertaken have not brought forth any adverse impact on these tribal groups \nwithin the area of influence of the project roads. According to the social assessment, the \nimproved road network is also expected to augment access to socioeconomic facilities for these \ngroups. Construction will not have any adverse consequences on their socioeconomic condition \nnor lead to any disruption in the life or culture of these communities.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n37.  MPRDC acquired substantial experience under other ADB-funded projects (footnote 6) \nand  has  shown  substantial  institutional  improvement  in  preparing  this  project.  Further,  the \nlessons learned from the previous projects have been incorporated in the project, such as (i) \nminimizing  the  impact  of  climate  change  through  proper  engineering  design,  extensive \nvegetative control, structural measures to combat erosion, and 1:7 compensatory reforestation; \n(ii) addressing road safety in a better manner through proper engineering input, particularly \nprovisions  of  safety  features  like  road  markings,  cautionary  boards,  crash  barriers,  and \nreplacement  of  old  cross-drainage  structures;  and  (iii)  avoiding  land  acquisition  through \nengineering solutions and limiting rehabilitation of the state highways to the existing ROW. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " 10 \n38.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5. \n \nTable 5: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInitial delays in  MPRDC prepared the detailed design for the roads well in advance. Advance actions for \nproject  procurement, as well as ADB support, ensure high project readiness. Bids for all 13 packages of \nimplementation  civil works through ICB were received on 13 December 2010, and for recruitment of supervision \nconsultant, short-listing of firms completed and a request for proposals were issued to the \nshortlisted firms on 9 November 2010. MPRDC staff members have been trained on safeguard \nand procurement requirements to mitigate the potential risk of initial delays due to procedural \nclearance. ADB has provided support for due diligence for all project roads. Environmental and \nforest clearances for all 13 packages have also already been obtained. \nInsufficient  The Madhya Pradesh government has increased the road maintenance budget from $100 \nmaintenance  million  (2005\u20132010)  to  $200  million  (2011\u20132015)  to  meet  operation  and  maintenance \nfinancing  requirements. It and MPRDC will ensure, either by themselves or through the contractors, \nadequate maintenance of the project roads. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICB = international competitive bidding, MPRDC = Madhya Pradesh Road \nDevelopment Corporation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n39.  The government and MPRDC have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n40.  The  government  and  MPRDC  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n41.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$300,000,000 to India for the Madhya Pradesh State Roads Project III, from ADB's ordinary \ncapital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n16 February 2011", "Appendix 1  11 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data Sources and   \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms   and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nAccelerated  The gap between national  National and state  Various government \neconomic growth  and state GDP growth rates  macroeconomic  development activities are \nin Madhya  is reduced by more than 1.0%  data published by  effectively coordinated with \nPradesh  during 2014 and 2018  the Reserve Bank of  road sector investment, and \n(baseline: average annual  India   overall state and regional \nnational GDP growth from  economic performance is \n2003 to 2007 was 8.9%; state  sustained. \nGDP growth for the same \nperiod was 5%). \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nImproved  Travel time on the project  Project performance  The project is delivered on \nefficiency and  roads is reduced by 25% on  monitoring system  time, and transport modes \nsustainable  average from the current  from MPRDC  and services are available \ntransport  travel time of about 2.5    for the project roads. \noperations  minutes per kilometer.     \n     \nRoad safety on project roads  Annual Madhya  A fully functional road safety \nis improved (10% reduction in  Pradesh State  monitoring and rectification \nnumber of fatalities)  accident data report  program is implemented for \n  from Police Training  state highways by MPRDC. \nResearch Institute, \nBhopal \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.
