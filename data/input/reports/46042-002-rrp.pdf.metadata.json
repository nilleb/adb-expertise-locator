On a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita basis, Shaanxi \nranks  15th  (CNY38,564  in  2012).  Fifty  of  Shaanxi\u2019s  107  counties  are  designated  national \npoverty counties.4 Shaanxi has a total land area of 205,800 square kilometers and a population \nof 37.53 million (2013 census). The southern prefectures of Ankang and Shangluo (in which the \nproject  roads  are  located)  have  GDP  per  capita  of  CNY18,878  (Ankang)  and  CNY18,097 \n(Shangluo), both less than half the Shaanxi average. The net average income per head for rural \nhouseholds is CNY5,763 compared with CNY20,734 for urban Shaanxi households. \n \n4. \nThe Qinba Mountains area is especially poor with a poverty incidence exceeding 30% in \n2012. It is one of 11 high-poverty areas targeted for concentrated interventions under the China \nRural Poverty Alleviation and Development Program (2011\u20132020). Both Ankang and Shangluo, \ntwo prefecture-level cities in the Qinba Mountains area, have strong potential for expansion of \nthe agriculture, mineral, and hydropower industries, and for the development of tourism. \n \n5. \nA lack of transport infrastructure is constraining economic growth and poverty reduction. \nDue to road network and capacity limitations, the rural population suffers from a lack of access \nto markets and economic opportunities. High transport costs directly limit the extent of trade and \nconstrain residents\u2019 income-earning potential. Better road connections, with improved capacity, \nwill enable southeast Shaanxi to realize its full economic potential. \n \nIn the  PRC,  it  is reported that  65,225  people were killed  in road crashes  in 2010.5 The \n6. \nWorld  Health  Organization,  however,  estimates  275,983  road  crash  deaths  at  a  rate  of  20.5 \n\n                                                           \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Qinba Mountains area covers the Qinling and Bashan mountain ranges and spans Shaanxi, Hubei, Sichuan, \n\nand Henan provinces. Within Shaanxi, six prefectures are included in this area. \n\n3  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical assistance for  the  Shaanxi  Mountain \n\nRoad Safety Demonstration Project under Shaanxi Trunk Roads Improvement (TA 8440-PRC). \n\n4  Counties with an average annual rural per capita net income of less than CNY2,300. \n5  World Health Organization. 2013. Global Status Report on Road Safety: Supporting a Decade of Action. Geneva. \n\np. 99. \n\n \n\n\fdeaths  per  100,000  population  in  PRC. 6 Between  2005  and  2012,  the  number  of  reported \ncrashes has declined while the proportion of reported crashes resulting in fatalities increased\u2014\n29%  in 2012  compared with  22%  in 2005\u2014indicating a reporting trend  toward fewer  but  more \nserious crashes.7  \n \n7. \nReported road fatalities (9,831) and injuries (30,021) in Shaanxi from 2008 to 2012 cost \n$5 billion. Ankang and Shangluo are experiencing road fatality and injury rates that far exceed \nthe provincial and national averages with a crash rate 4 times the national average for roads of \nsimilar  class  in  the  PRC8.  Analysis  of  1,000  kilometers  (km)  of  roads  in  the  Qinba  Mountains \narea found  that  road  fatalities  and  injuries  cost  $84  million  (0.3%  of  Shaanxi\u2019s  GDP)  per  year \nfrom  2007  to  2011.  There  is  an  obvious  and  urgent  need  to  improve  road  safety  provisions \nthroughout the project area. \n \nMost  crash  victims  are  male  vulnerable  road  users9 aged  21\u201365  living  in  rural  areas.10 \n8. \nAcross transport modes, road fatalities involve vehicle and truck occupants (28%), motorcyclists \n(28%),  pedestrians  (26%),  cyclists  (17%),  and  other  (1%).  As  motorcycles  and  nonmotorized \ntransport  modes  are  most  commonly  used  by  the  poor,  reducing  road  crashes  and  related \nimpacts will contribute to poverty reduction and inclusive economic growth. \n \n9. \nThe project area\u2014Xunyang, Hanyin, and Shangnan counties in Ankang and Shangluo\u2014\ncontains many high-risk trunk and rural roads with significant traffic volume and a mix of heavy \nvehicles,  automobiles,  motorcycles,  nonmotorized  vehicles,  and  pedestrians.  Many  of  the \ncrashes in the area are attributed to driver error aggravated by the steep, mountainous terrain. \nIn many cases, dangerous road conditions can be addressed by modest design interventions at \nrelatively  low  cost. The development  and  institutionalization of  modern  road safety  design  and \nmanagement approaches will lead to a sustainable reduction in road deaths and injuries. \n \n10. \nTrunk  roads.  The  highways  in  the  Qinba  Mountains  area  are  narrow,  with  inadequate \nsight  distances,  very  tight  curves,  and  low  axle  load  limits.  Vehicle  ownership  in  the  area  has \ngrown rapidly, and ongoing major construction projects have led to increased heavy truck traffic \nleading  to  accelerated  pavement  deterioration.  Traffic  has  grown  at  nearly  10%  per  year  and \nsections  of  the  network  will  reach  capacity  within  5  years.  Rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  the \ntrunk  road  network  is  required  to  ensure  that  adequate  capacity  can  facilitate  economic \ndevelopment,  and  improve  accessibility  for  the  local  population.  On  the  three  project  trunk \nroads,  the  annual  cost  per  km  of  road  crash  fatalities  and  injuries  per  km  are  several  times \nhigher than the national averages, resulting in a combined total cost of $40 million (footnote 8). \nBy  incorporating  best  road  safety  design  practices  on  the  trunk  road  upgrades,  the  incidence \nand cost of road crashes can be significantly reduced. \n \n11. \nRural  roads.  The  unpaved  rural road  network constrains  agricultural  development  and \nlimits access to (i) markets for sale of produce and purchase of agricultural inputs; (ii) collection \nor  processing  stations  for  the  sale  of  cash  crops;  (iii)  towns  and  cities  for  employment \n                                                           \n6  World Health Organization. 2013.

During  the  wet  season,  the  existing  unpaved  rural  roads  become \nimpassable because of landslides or poor road surfaces, leading to perishable crops being lost \nand reducing access to employment and social services. Rural roads in the project area exhibit \na range in level of safety. Road fatalities, and injuries on the most unsafe rural road included in \nthe  project  cost  up  to  $6  million  annually.  Targeted  strategic  investments  on  the  rural  road \nnetwork will improve both access and transport safety. \n \nRoad  safety  management  and  education.  On  road  rehabilitation  and  road  upgrade \n12. \nprojects,  the  Shaanxi  Provincial  Transport  Department  (SPTD)  ensures  that  safety  provisions \naddress  known  hazardous  road  sections.  To  guide  this  responsibility,  the  Highway  Safety \nEnhancement  Project11 was  launched  in  2004.  The  department  of  traffic  police  conducts  road \nsafety publicity and education programs for middle and primary schools. A determined focus on \nimproving  education  and  community  awareness  programs  will  help  raise  awareness  of  the \npublic health threat posed by dangerous driving behavior and hazardous road conditions. \n \nStrategic relevance. As ADB\u2019s largest developing member country, the PRC suffers the \n13. \ngreatest  road  crash  fatality  and  serious  injury  toll.  Successful  project  implementation  and \npromotion  of  the  road  safety  project  design  approach  will  encourage  replication  in  other \nprovinces of the PRC and in other developing member countries. The project aligns with ADB's \ncountry partnership strategy for the PRC, 2011\u2013201512 and its sustainable transport initiative,13 \nin the areas of road safety and social sustainability, and the Midterm Review of Strategy 202014 \ngiving emphasis to infrastructure financing in underdeveloped areas.  \n \nADB\u2019s  participation  will  help  the  PRC mobilize resources  with  international  expertise to \n14. \ndemonstrate  innovative  design  solutions,  and  it  will  help  build  local  and  national  road  safety \ncapability. 15 Importantly  the  project  will  encourage  the  use  of  performance-tracking  tools  to \nbenchmark  and  monitor  road  safety  performance  over  time.  ADB\u2019s  engagement  in  Shaanxi \nsince 2001 has highlighted the need for an early focus on developing safeguards, procurement \nand financial management capacity at the implementing agency level.16  \n \nB. \n\nImpacts and Outcome \n\n15. \nThe impacts will be reduction of road crash fatalities and serious injuries, and provision \nof  efficient  and  safe  all-weather  accessibility  in  southeast  Shaanxi  Province.  The  outcome  will \nbe a safer and more efficient trunk and rural road network in southeast Shaanxi Province. \n\n                                                           \n11 The Highway Safety Enhancement Project involved a CNY25.34 billion investment over 10 years on 366,000 km of \nroads to remedy safety problems. The successful preparation of this Shaanxi Mountain Road Safety Demonstration \nProject influenced the Ministry of Transport to adopt the ChinaRAP road safety design methodology on phase 2 of \nthe Highway Safety Enhancement Project, which will be considered by the State Council in 2015.  \n\n12 ADB. 2012.

The Foreign Financed Project Office (FFPO) of SPTD will be responsible for day-\nto-day  project  preparation,  coordination,  and  liaison  work  to  ensure  that  the  project  is \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidance  and  requirements.  The  Ankang  City  Traffic \nBureau (AKTB) and the Shangnan County Government (SCG), as the implementing agencies, \nwill  respectively  manage  the  implementation  of  trunk  and  rural  roads  and  road  safety \ncomponents  in  Ankang  City  and  Shangnan  County.  Daily  management  responsibility  will  be \nassigned to the four subproject management offices under the jurisdiction of AKTB and SCG. \n \n25. \nUnder  AKTB  leadership,  the  Ankang  project  management  office  (PMO)  will  manage \nconstruction  of  trunk  roads  S102  and  G316,  seven  rural  roads,  and  safety  improvements  on \nrural roads in their area. Dedicated management offices will be established for G316 Xunyang\u2013\nAnkang  (36.3  km)  and  S102  Xunyang\u2013Xiaohe  (64.1  km).

SCG PMO will manage construction of trunk road S224, one rural road (#8), \nand safety improvements on six rural roads. \n \n26. \nProcurement  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2015,  as amended from time  to time).  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nAdvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  was  approved  for  the  trunk  roads  subgrade \ncontracts and the recruitment of the project management consultant. Advance contracting does \nnot commit ADB to approve the project or finance procurement costs. Retroactive financing will \nfinance  up  to  $40  million  of  eligible  expenditure  (20%  of  the  ADB  loan)  incurred  prior  to  loan \neffectiveness, but not earlier than 12 months before loan signing. \n \n27. \nTrunk  road  procurement.  SCG  will  manage  nine  contracts  for  the  upgrade  and \nrehabilitation of S224, of which there are five subgrade contracts; two pavement contracts; one \nlandscaping, safety facility, and traffic engineering contract; and one pavement contract for the \nrehabilitation-only road section. AKTB will manage nine contracts for the upgrading of G316 and \nS102,  of  which  there  are  four  subgrade  contracts,  two  pavement  contracts,  two  landscaping \ncontracts,  and  one  tunnel  equipment  and  fit-out  contract.

While  compliance  with  the  PRC  road  design  standards  improves  safety,  the \ndemonstration  budget  was  committed  to  improvements  over  and  above  those  necessary  for \ncode  compliance.  The  $50  million  demonstration  on  the  896  km  of  project  roads  provided  an \nopportunity  to  illustrate  international  good  design  practice. 20 In  the  absence  of  road  safety \ndesign modifications,  it was estimated that  26,985  deaths  and serious  injuries  would occur  on \nthe project roads over a 20-year period. With the agreed design modifications, it was estimated \nthat 5,407 fewer deaths and serious injuries will eventuate. This represents a 25% reduction in \ndeaths  and  serious  injuries,  with  the  associated  investment  generating  a  road  safety  benefit\u2013\ncost ratio of 6.7:1.21 \n \n30. \nThe  ChinaRAP  Safer  Roads  Investment  Plan  identified  countermeasures  that  could \naffordably  and  economically  reduce  risk,  thereby  preventing  deaths  and  serious  injuries. 22 \nCountermeasures from 93 options were considered for each 100-meter road segment, ranging \nfrom  low-cost  road  markings  and  pedestrian  refuges  to  higher-cost  intersection  upgrades  and \nfull  road  duplication.  Design  features  that  will  improve  safety  include  roadside  safety  barriers, \npaved  shoulders,  realignments,  enhanced  skid  resistance,  traffic  calming,  and  pedestrian \ncrossings. The project demonstration purpose was served by introducing countermeasures not \ncommonly  used  in the  PRC  including  vehicle-activated  signs, flexible delineator  posts, colored \npavement treatments at the entry to villages, and raised pedestrian crossings at schools. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n31. \nEconomic  analysis.  The  project  is  economically  viable.  The  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn  (EIRR)  and  net  present  value  (NPV)  at  a  discount  rate  of  12%  for  the  upgrade  of  the \nthree  trunk  roads  are  16.8%  and  CNY365  million  (S102),  25.5%  and  CNY309  million  (G316), \n\n                                                           \n20 Inclusive of contingency allocations the road safety only budget was assigned to (i) output 1: trunk road upgrades \n($32.12  million),  (ii)  output  2:  rural  road  upgrades  ($2.68  million),  (iii)  output  3:  crash  reduction  program \n($13.83 million), and (iv) output 4: institutional development ($1.37 million). \n\n21 ADB. 2015. Shaanxi Mountain Road Safety Demonstration: Final Road Safety Report Part 1. Consultant\u2019s report. \n\nManila (TA 8440-PRC, p. 5). \n\n22 ChinaRAP is a collaboration between the Ministry of Transport Research Institute of Highway and the International \nRoad  Assessment  Program  (iRAP).  The  iRAP  road  safety  design  methodology  uses  road  attribute  risk  factors \n(often  called  crash  modification  factors)  to  relate  road  attributes  and  crash  rates.  These  are  used  to  assess  the \nlikelihood that a crash will occur, and the severity of those that do occur, for both existing roads and road designs. \nThe methodology involves an economic analysis of road safety countermeasure options, with benefits expressed in \nterms of the value of deaths and serious injuries prevented. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fand 26.7% and CNY607 million (S224), including safety benefits. The eight rural road upgrades \nresult  in  an  EIRR  of  22.0%  and  an  NPV  of  CNY193  million  (weighted  average).  The  crash \nreduction  program  returned  an  EIRR  of  57%  and  an  NPV  of  CNY455  million.  The  sensitivity \nanalysis confirmed there is little risk to the project\u2019s viability.  \n \n32. \nFinancial  analysis.  The  project  has  no  revenue-generating  components.  Construction \nand  incremental  operating  costs  do  not  represent  a  substantial  financial  burden  on  SPTD, \nAnkang  City,  and  Shangnan  County,  all  of  which  have  sufficient  financial  capacity  to  provide \ncounterpart funds, cover operation and maintenance costs, and service the ADB loan. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \n33. \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  procurement  documents  and  contracts.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  the  executing \nagency  and  implementing  agencies,  and  the  FFPO.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM  (footnote  20).  An  assessment  of  financial \nmanagement  capacity  indicates  that  the  executing  agency  and  one  implementing  agency \n(AKTB)  carefully  follow  the  PRC  policies  and  procedures  for  accounting  and  financial \nmanagement.  The  financial  management  assessment  recommended  capacity  development \nmeasures  to  ensure  the  implementing  agencies  are  able  to  meet  financial  management \nrequirements.  It  was  concluded  that  the  overall  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is \nmoderate. The staff of the FFPO and the implementing agencies will undertake targeted training \nto adequately mitigate the risks starting in the last quarter of 2015. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nPoverty  and  social. Two of the three project counties are designated national poverty \n34. \ncounties  (Xunyang  and  Shangnan).  The  remote  mountainous  location,  harsh  geographic  and \nclimatic  conditions,  and  inadequate  road  infrastructure  are  major  obstacles  to  economic \ndevelopment  and  contribute  to  persistent  poverty  in  the  project  area.  The  project  will  improve \nroad connectivity, reduce transport costs and travel time, and improve access to economic and \nemployment opportunities and social services. Local people will benefit from enhanced access, \nimproved  mobility,  and  skilled  and  unskilled  employment  opportunities  generated  during \nconstruction. The project will result in 25% fewer fatalities and serious injuries than would have \nbeen  the  case  without  the  project.  This  constitutes  a  substantial  reduction  in  social  and \neconomic costs from road crashes. \n \n35. \nGender.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and  involves  a \ngender  action  plan. 23  Targets  for  women\u2019s  employment  and  project  participation  are  key \nfeatures embodied in the design and monitoring framework and the  social development action \nplan. \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n36. \nEnvironment  (category  A).  A  consolidated  environmental  impact  assessment  and \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) covers all project components, complies with the PRC\u2019s \n\n                                                           \n23 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fregulatory requirements and ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009), and  was  disclosed  on \nthe  ADB  website  on  1  April  2015.  Public  consultation  informed  the  project  design  and \nenvironmental impact assessment process, and will continue during project implementation. The \nEMP outlines potential impacts, mitigation and monitoring measures, institutional arrangements, \ntraining requirements, and implementation budget. The EMP implementation budget is 1.1% of \nthe total  project  budget. Capacity  development  and  institutional  strengthening  are proposed  to \nminimize  environmental  risks.  Environmental  complaints  will  be  handled  through  a  grievance \nredress mechanism. \n \n37. \nAnticipated environmental impacts and risks are mostly modest and can be limited to an \nacceptable level  through  EMP  implementation and  compliance with loan  covenants. The main \npotential impacts are on the water quality of rivers and noise and pollution impacts on sensitive \nreceptors within or close to the project road corridors. Trunk road G316 runs parallel to the north \nbank of the Shaanxi Han River wetland, triggering ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement for legally \nprotected areas. The responsible authority confirmed that the reserve within the project area of \ninfluence is designated for water quality objectives and there are no critical or valuable natural \nor modified habitats. The proposed EMP control measures are in line with the Shaanxi wetland \nprotection regulation and the collection of road runoff in sedimentation tanks will have benefits \nfor  water  quality,  as  runoff  is  currently  unmanaged.  Total  carbon  dioxide  emissions  from  all \nproject roads are 79,000 tons per annum in the medium term (year 2023) and 112,000 tons per \nannum  in  the  long  term  (year  2031).  Economic  analysis  demonstrates  that  project  road \nimprovements  will  result  in  a  net  reduction  of  carbon  emissions,  although  these  savings  are \nlikely to be offset by induced traffic and embodied carbon during construction. \n \nClimate  change  (medium  risk).  A  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  analysis  study \n38. \ndetermined that there will be an increased risk of extreme rainfall events and flooding.24 A range \nof hard and soft climate change adaptation measures have been proposed for the project roads. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  A).  LAR  impacts  are  attributable  mainly  to  the \n39. \ntrunk  road  component.  Measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  displacement  were  considered  in  the \nproject design. Rural road improvement will result in minor LAR. The estimated permanent land \nacquisition for the  project  roads  is  3,429  mu  including  dry farm  land, garden land, forest  land, \nhouse plots, and barren land.25 The total area of house and building demolition is 62,934 square \nmeters, involving residential houses and other structures. An estimated 12,527 persons in 3,341 \nrural  households will  be affected,  including  3,013  households  affected  by  land acquisition  only \nand  328  households  by  both  land  acquisition  and  house  demolition.  LAR  impacts  are \nadequately assessed. Project roads are existing roads so land acquisition impacts do not cause \nsignificant  land  loss  for  affected  households.  The  five  resettlement  plans  prepared  to  address \nproject-related  LAR  impacts  are  adequate.  SPTD  has  previously  worked  on  ADB-financed \nprojects  and  has  sufficient  institutional  capacity and commitment  to manage  social  safeguards \nrisks emanating from LAR. Capacity building for the implementing agencies on social safeguard \nimplementation  is  integrated  in  the  project  design.  Project-affected  people  were  consulted \nduring resettlement plan preparation. Approved resettlement plans have been disclosed to the \naffected peoples and were posted on the ADB website on 18 May 2015. \n \n40. \nThe  LAR  cost  estimate  is  CNY189.50  million  including  land  compensation,  house \nrelocation,  livelihood  support,  taxes,  fees,  and  contingency  funds.  Compensation  was \n\n                                                           \n24 Project Climate Risk Assessment and Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 m2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fdetermined  at  replacement  cost.  The  LAR  budget  is  included  in  the  overall  project  budget. \nSPTD  confirmed  adequate  LAR  counterpart  funding  will  be  made  available.  Resettlement \nimplementation  will  be  monitored  by  an  independent  agency.  A  grievance-redress  mechanism \nwill address affected people\u2019s concerns and ensure grievances are resolved in a timely manner. \n \n41. \ncomprise 99% of the project area population. \n \nF. \n\nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).
