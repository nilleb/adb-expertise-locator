Substantial  cuts  in  the  size  of\nGovernment have been achieved but structural\nchange  to  achieve  greater  private  sector\nemployment and development is slow to occur\ndue to fundamental constraints in the FSM\u2019s legal\nand  institutional  infrastructure.  Assistance  is\nneeded to help the FSM establish an open and\ncompetitive economy that is conducive to private\nsector development by (i) promoting a favorable\neconomic and legal environment for investment;\nand (ii) increasing the mobilization, productivity,\nand competitiveness of FSM\u2019s land, labor, and\ncapital resources.\nClassification Economic growth, private sector development\nEnvironmental Assessment Category  C.

THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on two proposed\nloans  to  the  Federated  States  of  Micronesia  (FSM)  for  the  Private  Sector  Development\nProgram.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. At the request of the FSM Government, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved\ntechnical assistance (TA)1 in October 1999 to assist the Government in preparing a private\nsector development program (PSDP). The Government\u2019s request for the proposed PSDP loan\nresulted from the Second FSM Economic Summit held in September 1999, which defined\nprivate sector development as the overarching national development goal.2 ADB agreed to\nconsider  the  request,  as  it  fitted  in  with  the  revised  Pacific  Strategy3  and  initiated  loan\nprocessing in 2000 for approval in 2001. Accordingly, the ADB loan Fact-Finding Mission was\nfielded during 24 May-9 June 2000 and followed up by an appraisal mission in September 2000.\nThe missions visited all four FSM states, and discussed the policy and investment components\nidentified under the TA. The national and state governments expressed strong interest in and\nsupport for the PSDP. Appropriate draft legislation was submitted in late 2000 to the FSM\nCongress.  Consideration  of  the  PSDP  loan  by  the  FSM  Congress  was  delayed  to  allow\nadequate time for all four states to participate and reach a level of ownership that will ensure\nsustainability of the program. To augment this process, a country programming and consultation\nmission visited the FSM from 18 to 31 July 2001. The mission revalidated and updated the\nPSDP  loan  documents,  as  well  as  held  consultations  with  the  states  and  the  national\nGovernment to ensure that all states are able to meet the conditions of and participate in the\nproposed PSDP loan. Legislation to borrow for the PSDP loan is expected to be acted upon in\nthe November 2001 session of the FSM Congress. The program framework for the PSDP is in\nAppendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Macroeconomic Context\n1.  Development Potential and Economic Prospects\n3. The FSM comprises more than 600 islands totaling 702 square kilometers (km2) of land\narea scattered over an exclusive economic zone of 2.6 million km2  in the western central Pacific\nOcean. The islands are divided among four states: Chuuk (133.8 km2), Kosrae (117.4 km2),\nPohnpei (360.6 km2), and Yap (125 km2) with the national government located in Pohnpei at\nPalikir. Island landforms vary from high islands with extensive tropical forests and substantial\nareas suitable for agriculture to narrow atolls. The ocean area of the FSM\u2019s exclusive economic\nzone is the country\u2019s greatest natural resource. Estimates4 indicate that the western Pacific\ncould support annual catches of at least 0.4 million tons of skipjack tuna, and 0.65 million tons\nof yellow fin tuna, but the sustainable catch of bigeye tuna and albacore is fully exploited. The\nFSM\u2019s natural beauty and reasonable proximity to Guam, Palau, and the Philippines places it\nwell to capitalize on the growing tourism to the region from Asia, especially Japan; the United\n                  \n1  TA 3278-FSM: Private Sector Development Program, for $150,000, approved on 19 October 1999.\n2  Through TA 3024-FSM: Economic Policy Reform and Management (EMPAT II), for $2,877,000, approved on 12\nMay 1998, ADB provided economic advisory support to, and participated in, the Summit.\n3  ADB. 2000. A Pacific Strategy for  the New Millennium. Manila.\n4  ABD 1996. FSM Economic Report. Manila.", "2\nStates (US); Australia; and Europe. But the FSM\u2019s small population (111,500 persons in 1998),\nlimited land area, and relative isolation from markets limit its capacity to take advantage of some\nof the opportunities presented. In the main centers of each state, basic economic infrastructure,\nincluding  roads,  airports,  ports,  access  to  telecommunications,  electricity,  water,  and  other\nutilities is of reasonable quality and reliability. Outside the main centers, the state of completion\nand durability of infrastructure are still variable.\n4. The  FSM\u2019s  political  and  economic  ties  with  the  US  through  the  Compact  of  Free\nAssociation, a treaty agreement, places the country in a unique situation. While the treaty was\ndrafted to last indefinitely, provisions under Title Two, Economic Relations, are time bound and\ndue  to  expire  in  FY2001.  The  Compact  allows  for  annual  cash  grants  (in  nominal  terms)\naveraging $98 million for FY1987/91, $90 million for FY1992/96, and $79 million for the third\nfive-year period FY1997/2001. A significant amount of grant transfer contributed to notable\naverage real gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 4.2 percent during FY1987/95 mainly\nbased on large government spending. However, the two step-downs of Compact funding have\nrequired fiscal austerity and led to negative economic growth averaging minus 1.5 percent\nduring FY1995/2001. Facing the second step-down in the Compact funding starting in 1996, the\nFSM launched public sector and economic reforms, supported by an ADB program loan.5 An\nimportant component of the Public Sector Reform Program (PSRP) involved reducing the size\nand operating costs of government.\n5. At the time of the 2000 annual census, FSM had a total population of 107,008.6 Chuuk is\nthe most populous state with 53,595. From 1989 to 1994, the population grew at an average of\n1.96  percent per annum. However, due largely to increased out-migration, the annual rate from\n1994 to 2000 was just 0.24 percent. In 2001, 40.3 percent of the population was aged 0\u201314.\nThe dependency level is very high, especially from the young, raising the income requirements\nfor the average family and lowering per capita incomes. A crude estimate indicates that a\nprojected annual growth rate of over 12 percent is needed by the economy to absorb the\ncurrently unemployed and upcoming entrants to the labor market. This is a daunting prospect\nconsidering the recent contractions in GDP and real growth levels of 1.1 percent in FY1999, 2.5\npercent in FY2000, and 0.9 percent in FY2001.\n6. To cope with these macroeconomic and demographic challenges and to exploit the\nFSM\u2019s economic potential, a response by the private sector is critical. If the country is to\nbecome more resilient to external shocks and to create even a portion of the employment\nneeded to absorb public sector retirees, the unemployed, and the upcoming influx of youth, the\ncountry should pursue private sector-led economic growth. However, many of the conditions\nthat are essential for private investment and economic growth need to be improved urgently.\nThe country\u2019s legal systems and public institutions' ability to manage and support the markets\nfor private land, labor, and capital remain inadequate. Without internal market infrastructure that\ncan attract, utilize, and circulate these resources, any bank or other externally-supplied capital\nand skills will be less effective in supporting sustained economic growth.\n2.  Economic Performance and Developments\n7. Real GDP estimates indicate that the FSM economy as a whole has grown at an annual\naverage rate of 1.8 percent from $169 million in 1987 to $218 million in 2001 (all in FY1998\n                  \n5  Loan 1520-FSM: Public Sector Reform Program, for $18.0 million, approved on 29 April 1997 and completed on 31\nDecember 1999.\n6  DEA. 1998. Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Division of Statistics.", "3\nconstant terms). Underlying this positive but modest growth are the fundamental effects of the\nresource transfers from the US prior to and following the Compact agreement, and the major\nrole government has assumed in the economy. During the second half of the 1990s, the FSM\neconomy  slumped,  as  US  transfers  declined,  necessitating  downward  adjustments  in\ngovernment expenditure, and as the private sector, significantly dependent on government\nspending, began to adjust. The FSM economy as a whole contracted at an annual rate of minus\n1.5 percent during FY1995/2001. However, the economy appears to have bottomed out; it grew\nby about 1.1 percent in FY1999, 2.5 percent in FY2000, and 0.9 percent in FY2001.\n8. The real GDP per capita in FY2000 is estimated at $2,036, which places the FSM in the\nmiddle income group of ADB\u2019s 12 Pacific developing member countries. The difference in\neconomic performance by state is significant. Real GDP per capita of Chuuk ($1,170) was one-\nthird of Yap ($3,215) in FY1999. Overall GDP growth was strongest during FY1987/2001 in\nPohnpei (3.0 percent), Yap (2.9 percent), and Kosrae (0.6 percent), while GDP declined slightly\nin Chuuk (minus 0.2 percent). As the effects of economic shocks set in, the FSM private sector\ndeclined from FY1995/2001 by minus 1.6 percent per annum; however, among the states, only\nPohnpei experienced a decline in private sector activity during this period of minus 4.8 percent\nper annum.\n9. Over  the  first  five-year  period  under  the  Compact  transfers,  FSM-wide  government\nexpenditure increased by 62 percent from $104 million in FY1987 to $170 million in FY1991. In\nthe second five-years of funding, deficit spending using surpluses from previous years created\nthe circumstances for the difficult adjustments that followed the second step-down in Compact\nfunding. Painful adjustments were made by the five governments of the FSM through the PSRP.\nThis included a reduction in the FSM-wide government workforce of 23 percent, and wage cuts\nand restraint to effect payroll savings of $17 million per year or a reduction of 29 percent.\nGovernment spending fell from more than 100 percent of GDP, during FY1989/91 to 66 percent\nin  FY2000.  Consolidated  FSM  Government  revenues,  including  Compact  transfers,  and\nexpenditures are close to balancing.\n10. Prior  to  FY1990,  the  FSM  had  no  official  public  debts  to  offshore  lenders.  During\nFY1990/1993,  borrowing  increased  to  a  peak  of  $137  million  in  FY1993,  representing  66\npercent of GDP. The borrowing included $71 million for Yap State\u2019s monetization program,\n$42.9 million for fisheries investments through the state and national fisheries enterprises, as\nwell as public guaranteed borrowing for telecommunications ($41 million) and fisheries in Yap\n($9 million). Since FY1993, the only new borrowing has been from ADB, including fisheries\ndevelopment,7 the PSRP (footnote 5), and water supply and sanitation.8  Disciplined debt\nservicing has allowed the debt to fall to slightly over $80 million in 1999 and is expected to fall to\n24 percent of GDP by FY2001. Nonetheless, the uncertainties over the future of US economic\ntransfers including the form, amount, and conditions of the assistance are not likely to be known\nuntil 2003. Given the lack of knowledge of future financial and economic assistance from the\nUS, the FSM governments prefer to take a cautious approach to bearing additional debt over\nthe short term. Regardless of the result of the new Compact renewal, the Government needs to\nstay  the  course  of  reforms  and  to  improve  the  enabling  environment  for  private  sector\ndevelopment, an engine of growth, so that new US assistance will contribute to building a more\nself-reliant economy.\n                  \n7  Loan 1257-FSM: Fishery Development Project, for $6.4 million, approved on 19 October 1993.\n8  Loan 1459-FSM: Water Supply and Sanitation Project, for $10.2 million, approved on 19 September 1996.", "4\n3.  Incidence of Poverty\n11. The incidence and nature of poverty in the FSM is unclear given the lack of specific data,\nbut the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) human poverty index of 26.7 indicates\nthe  FSM  has  the  fourth  highest  level  of  poverty  among  the  Pacific  developing  member\ncountries. A tentative head-count estimate of poverty for the FSM uses the latest household\nincome and expenditure survey of 1998. The preliminary estimate is that about 40 percent of all\nFSM families live below the food threshold; about $575 is required for a family to consume the\nminimum required number of calories. Similarly, based on the average proportion a family\nspends on food as a share of total income, about 40% of all FSM families live below the overall\npoverty threshold of $1,075. Variation in poverty is substantial between the states, the poorest\nbeing Chuuk with a poor population of 53 percent and Yap, the least poor, with 16 percent.\nIncome in Yap is also better distributed, with the ratio of mean income of the highest 20 percent\nof households to the lowest 20 percent being 7.3, as against 13.3 for Pohnpei, which has the\nhighest income inequality. Larger households tend to be poorer than small households. A higher\nproportion of households headed by women tends to be poor (43.7 percent, as compared with\n39.6 percent for men and 40.4 percent overall).\n12. A range of social problems, including high dependency ratio and high population growth\n(2.3  to  2.5  percent  natural  growth  rate)  compared  with  economic  growth,  low  educational\nattainment and poor education services, increased unemployment arising from government\ndownsizing,  limited  formal  employment  opportunities  in  the  private  sector,  and  reduced\ngovernment budgets for social services place the FSM at risk of social decline and an increased\nincidence of poverty. The greatest risk is in Chuuk State, which has the lowest per capita GDP.\nGroups that are at the greatest risk include locationally disadvantaged outer islanders and\npeople residing far from main centers (an estimated 17 percent of the population or 18,000),\nmigrants to the main islands,9  school dropouts, unemployed youth, and dislocated public sector\nworkers with inappropriate skills for the private sector. Micronesian society can offset some of\nthe impact by drawing upon the obligations of the extended family, but this also places a burden\non the income earners, further straining low household incomes. Recent successive economic\ncontractions suggest that the already low standards of education, health, and law enforcement\nwill decline, having a negative impact particularly on the outer islanders and migrants to the\nmain islands who are virtually landless.\nB.  Sector Description and Recent Performance\n1.  The Role of the Private Sector in Gross Domestic Product\n13. The largest single sector in the FSM economy is government services. Although the\ncontribution of government services to GDP has fallen from 36 percent of GDP in FY1987 to 23\npercent in FY2001, this is still high by international standards, including other Pacific countries.\nThe second largest sector is wholesale and retail trade, which has grown largely in response to\nthe spending power of salaried government workers. Subsistence production from agriculture\nand  inshore  fisheries  is  estimated  to  be  the  third  largest  sector.  Subsistence  production,\ntherefore, still makes a significant contribution to the economy through informal activity outside\nthe market economy.\n                  \n9  In Pohnpei State, over 2,000 outer islanders have settled on the main island of Pohnpei, while 5,000 outer\nislanders have settled on the small island of Weno, the state capital of Chuuk (ADB. 1993. Women in Development\nStudy, Country Briefing Paper. Manila.).", "5\n14. Until FY1990, the public sector contributed a larger amount to GDP than the private\nsector.  Since  1989,  the  private  sector  contribution  began  to  exceed  the  public  sector.  In\nFY1998, the contribution of the formal private sector to GDP was 31 percent, and subsistence\ncontributed 14.0 percent. The combined private sector activity has contributed more to the\neconomy than the government every year since FY1991 and grew at an average annual rate of\n7.2  percent  from  1987  to  1995.  Between  FY1995  and  FY2001,  the  contribution  of  the\ngovernment to GDP fell by 7.7 percent annually, whereas private sector activity fell by an\naverage 1.6 percent annually.\n2.  The Structure of the Private Sector\n15. If the market economy alone is considered, that is contributions to GDP from private and\npublic  enterprises  excluding  government  services  and  subsistence  production,  then  the\ndominance of the wholesale and retail trade is even more pronounced. An estimated 51 percent\nof the market economy arises from wholesale and retail trade, while the two major export\nsectors, fisheries and tourism, account for only 11 percent. Commercial agriculture is even\nsmaller, representing only 2 percent of the market economy. This indicates that the private\nsector, in its current form, is dominated by nontraded goods and services that can only be sold\nand bought within the domestic economy, such as wholesale and retail goods, rental property,\nand services to support government operations. The 1996 survey of businesses indicates that\nwholesale and retail trade dominated the formal sector in terms of number of establishments\n(57.8  percent),  employment  (49.3  percent),  wages  (27.6  percent),  and  value  added  (55.8\npercent).\n16. The reason for an economic structure based largely on nontraded goods and services\nstems from the creation of a government sector that became the largest employer in the FSM\nand  the  resulting  higher  relative  cash  incomes  in  that  sector.  As  a  result,  lifestyles  have\nchanged as reflected in the increased demand for imported foods and products, which became\nmore  affordable  and  preferred  for  their  convenience.  The  private  sector  responded  by\nexpanding into the lucrative wholesale and retail businesses. Furthermore, as government\nemployment  provided  a  satisfactory  income  as  an  alternative  to  the  relatively  high-labor-\ndemanding  subsistence  and  small-scale  commercial  agriculture  and  fisheries  sectors,  the\nrelative  returns  dropped  for  resources  used  in  agriculture  and  coastal  fisheries.  This  has\nresulted in decreased use and production of a variety of domestic products, especially in\nsubsistence and small-scale commercial agriculture and fisheries.  Even ocean fisheries (tuna),\ndespite the high value of fish exports, currently make only a small contribution in terms of value\nadded to the economy.\n17. Under a situation of US economic assistance step-downs and government downsizing,\nthe greatest negative economic impact has been on businesses dealing with nontraded goods\nand services. As wholesale and retail is the largest sector in the market economy, initially this\nsector will be at greatest risk. Because the FSM economy has grown based on an inward-\nlooking strategy in terms of products and markets, the FSM\u2019s relative competitiveness in the\nworld market is weak. To become more resilient to future changes in transfers and to reduce the\ncurrent levels of dependence on government-directed and -financed development, the tradable\nsector must be expanded through private sector activity.\n3.  Enterprises, Employment, and Wages in the Private Sector\n18. Commercial  and  business  activity  is  dominated  by  informal  and  formal  small-  and\nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Apart from the government and utilities corporations, few\nlarge  businesses  exist  that  can  create  major  employment  or  single  markets  for  other", "6\nbusinesses. As such, most small businesses in the FSM can be characterized as having a small\nmarket share, and personalized owner operator or family management, that is too small to gain\naccess to commercial banking services. In 1998, an estimated 2,000 formal and informal SMEs\nwere operating in the four states (600 in Chuuk, 300 in Kosrae, 800 in Pohnpei, and 300 in\nYap).10 Excluding occasional sales from subsistence production, SMEs comprise more than 90\npercent of the total number of enterprises, and employ about 9,500 of a potential labor force of\n59,000. Hence, any meaningful and effective intervention for private sector development in the\nFSM  will  have  to  consider  the  important  role  SMEs  play  in  the  economic  and  social\ndevelopment of the country.\n19. The informal sector plays an important and often unacknowledged role in the FSM\neconomy. The majority of the FSM population live in rural areas including outer islands and\nengage in subsistence and mixed subsistence production for their livelihood. The FY2001 in-\nkind income from subsistence was $33 million compared with formal private sector wages and\nprofits of $71 million. Given the limited opportunities for earning cash incomes in the formal\nsector, the subsistence and informal sectors continue to support an increasing number of\npeople.  The  sale  of  surplus  subsistence  production  from  agriculture  and  inshore  fisheries\nprovides a useful and significant contribution to livelihoods, especially for nonsalaried persons.\nInformal sales of subsistence production in 1998 were estimated at $9.1 million inclusive of\nexports of local agricultural produce of under $2 million (footnote 6). Such informal sales are\noften  the  basis  from  which  commercialization  through  the  informal  sector  occurs.  This  is\nespecially evident in Truk Lagoon of Chuuk State, where the combined sales of fresh and\nprocessed local foods (agricultural and fisheries) have provided the basis for well-established\nmarkets in Weno. Part of this produce is exported to Guam. An increasing focus is needed on\nenhancing the capacity of the subsistence and informal sectors to encourage \"graduation\" into\nthe formal private sector enabling the generation of employment opportunities. Experience\nshows that the informal sector is an important source of entrepreneurial talent, particularly of\nwomen.\n20. The FSM\u2019s labor market faces a number of major problems and constraints including (i)\na demographic imbalance that will require a rapid expansion of the job market in the near future;\n(ii) a formal elementary and secondary education situation that is generating a high proportion of\ndropouts; (iii) lack of wage competitiveness; and (iv) limitations in the ability of the labor market\nand institutions to provide skilled labor. The high dependency level means the average family\nneeds more income to survive. Even though out-migration to the US is expected to have\nincreased in recent years, in effect reducing the population growth rate, this will not redress the\nhigh  dependency  ratio.  A  response  by  the  private  sector,  supported  by  a  more  favorable\ninvestment and pro-private-sector climate, is critical if the economy is to grow and create even a\nportion of the employment needed to absorb the public sector retirees, the unemployed and\nunderemployed, and the upcoming influx of youths about to enter the job market. The informal\nsector and even out-migration of Micronesians who are better trained for the overseas job\nmarket are an integral part of the overall need to raise gainful employment in the population.\n                  \n10In  1994,  the  UNDP/United  Nations  Industrial  Development  Organization  (UNIDO)-assisted  Micronesian\nEntrepreneur Development Center program proposed a bill to the Pohnpei Legislature, the Business Development\nAct of 1994, which became law on 10 January 1995. The law defines SMEs as any business activity or enterprise\nengaged  in  industry,  agribusiness,  tourism,  trade,  and/or  industrial  and  business  services,  whether  single\nproprietorship, cooperative, partnership, or corporation whose total assets inclusive of those arising from loans but\nexclusive of the land on which the particular business entity\u2019s office, plant, and equipment are situated, must have\nvalue falling under the following categories: Cottage: Less than $5,000; Small: $5,001 to $25,000; or Medium:\n$25,001 to $250,000.", "7\n21. The fact that public sector wages are almost double that of the private sector has two\nmajor  effects.  First,  higher  public  sector  wages  have  attracted  scarce  qualified  people  to\ngovernment over the private sector, and acted as a disincentive to private sector employment.\nSecond, pay levels have been pushed up due to the large and relatively better paid government.\nThe resulting high labor costs for the private sector have increased overall production costs in\nthe private sector, and reduced competitiveness of the sector especially if higher wages are not\nmatched  with  increased  productivity.  An  important  first  step  in  adjusting  the  labor  market\nthrough  downsizing  and  pay  restraints  in  favor  of  private  sector  development  was  the\nimplementation of the PSRP. Nevertheless large differences in pay levels and conditions still\nexist, and continue to favor public sector employment, divert skilled labor away from the private\nsector,  and  undermine  the  competitiveness  of  the  private  sector  through  higher  wage\nexpectations. However, adjustment of wage differentials alone is not sufficient.\n22. Education attainment is essential for expanding private sector employment. While a\nlarge  government  will  have  increased  skills  necessary  for  public  services,  these  are  not\nnecessarily suitable for private sector activity. As literacy and numeracy achievement at the\nelementary level is low, the majority of the population are ill-prepared for employment by the\nprivate sector, which often requires basic skills such as English language communication, and in\nmany cases even unskilled work. The current labor market situation is still limited by its inability\nto provide domestic skilled labor needed by the private sector, and skill gaps continue to prevail.\nC.  Constraints and Issues\n23. A survey conducted by the Forum Secretariat11 revealed that significant impediments to\nforeign  investments  commonly  exist  in  the  Pacific  island  countries.  The  most  significant\nimpediments are (i) bureaucratic delays; (ii) changes in government policies; (iii) land tenure\nissues related to the adjudication, survey, registration, and issuance of land titles; and (iv) lack\nof administrative skills in dealing with foreign investment matters. In addition to these policy and\nregulatory  impediments,  overall  economic  prospects  of  the  country  and  labor  skills  were\nidentified as other factors affecting investment. The investors raised virtually no concerns about\ninfrastructure. ADB TA for preparing the PSDP and the TA\u2019s own survey in December 1999 on\nSMEs  confirm  the  major  findings  of  the  Forum  Secretariat\u2019s  survey,  as  well  as  particular\nconstraints to development of the private sector in the FSM (footnote 1).\n1.  Fragile Policy and Regulatory Environment\na.  Need for Consolidating Public Sector Reforms\n24. Through  the  ADB-funded  PSRP,  the  national  and  state  governments  successfully\nimplemented  financial  adjustments  and  government  restructuring.  However,  since  the\ncompletion of the PSRP in 1999, the governments are facing pressure to rehire staff and raise\ngovernment wage levels. Furthermore, despite the wage cuts in the government sector under\nthe PSRP, FSM public sector wages are almost double that of the private sector on average.\nThis continues to favor public sector employment and undermine the competitiveness of the\nprivate sector through higher wage expectations and diversion of skilled labor. Under the current\nCompact agreement, if the negotiations are not concluded by 2001, then a two-year extension\nof the current agreement is automatically provided with annual payments calculated at an\n                  \n11Forum Secretariat. 1998.

This will\namount to a 27.5 percent increase over the Compact base grant compared with FY2001. While\nthis provides for short-term improvement in the FSM's fiscal situation, the Government should\navoid a temporary increase in unnecessary and unsustainable spending as this could lead to an\neconomic shock of even greater magnitude than those experienced following the two Compact\nstep-downs.\n25. Many of the FSM governments have sponsored risky, commercial operations.12  While\nthe goal of setting up these operations was to make up for the perceived capacity deficiencies of\nthe domestic private sector, in many cases these ventures resulted in substantial financial\nlosses for the national and state governments, and have not contributed in a meaningful manner\nto sustainable economic development. In addition, such sponsorship of purely commercially\noriented enterprises in some cases led to crowding out of private sector activities rather than\nfacilitating  their  development.  Focusing  public  spending  on  production  has  detracted  from\nactivities and the delivery of services to remove production constraints for the private sector,\nsuch  as  providing  information  on  markets,  increasing  know-how,  and  providing  effective\nbusiness development support.\n26. As a part of PSRP reforms that began in 1997, the state and national governments have\nundertaken a review of the functions of several departments and public enterprises to identify\nactivities that can be privatized, corporatized, or divested entirely. Most of the states have\nalready transferred the major utilities of power, water, and sanitation to independent public utility\nauthorities, which are run, more or less, on a commercial basis. Furthermore, several other\nactivities that were part of departmental operations have been privatized or contracted out.\nHowever, the actual implementation of public enterprise reforms has seldom gone beyond\ncommercialization and corporatization. Reasons include lack of commercial viability in their\ncurrent structure, complexity in legal status including multiple national and state ownership,\nreluctance to accept capital write-offs, and the implications of redundancies. Some statutes\ncreate an uneven playing field with the private sector, by giving some of the public enterprises\ntax exemptions and other privileges. A positive step was the establishment in January 2000 of\nthe Public Enterprise Unit within the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) to coordinate and\nfacilitate formulation of privatization policies and their actual implementation with support from\nan ADB TA.13 The TA is proposing four broad categories for reform: (i) corporate governance\nreform, (ii) private sector participation, (iii) divestiture, and (iv) liquidation. The general national\nand  state  governments'  commitment  to  privatization  must  be  translated  into  a  concrete,\ncomprehensive policy framework and detailed time-bound action plan that will provide the basis\nfor the actual implementation of the privatization process.\nb.  Weak Legal and Regulatory Environment\n27. In the FSM, weaknesses in the existing enabling legal and regulatory framework have\nproved to be an impediment to attracting and realizing investment and in some cases driven\n                  \n12 PSEs in the FSM can be subdivided in broad terms into four major groups: (i) utilities (telecommunications\ncorporation of FSM, state electricity, water, sewerage, transportation companies); (ii) fishing (National Fisheries\nCorporation and its subsidiaries and state government-owned fishing companies); (iii) finance (Bank of FSM and\nFSMDB); and (iv) other miscellaneous activities, including housing authorities, broadcast stations, and coconut\nprocessing companies. Overall, public enterprises account for approximately 14 percent of formal sector GDP\n(1996) and employ around 1,400 people, or about 10 percent of formal sector employment [EMPAT Report on\nPublic Enterprise Reform. Majuro. Department of Economic Affairs. 1997].\n13 TA 3201-FSM: Privatization of Public Enterprises and Corporate Governance, for $450,000, approved on 31 March\n2001.", "9\npotential investors away. The Government has recognized this and work is under way in a\nnumber of critical areas that will improve the provision of and access to economic resources,\nresource providers, and user security.\n28. Land must be more readily available for development in the FSM both through secure\naccess to land for production and investment activities, and as a means for mobilizing finance. A\nmajor legal obstacle is the constitutional prohibition of foreign ownership of land (nationwide), of\nownership by citizens from other FSM states (Kosrae and Pohnpei), and of any sale of land\n(Pohnpei). Restrictions on the length of leases in each state (25 to 50 years depending on the\nstate with provisions for renewal in most cases) may be regarded by investors as insufficient to\nrealize an adequate or competitive return on an investment, especially in sectors such as\ntourism, which is in the early stages of development. As foreigners are not permitted to own\nland in the FSM, this limits the use of secured loans by the foreign commercial banks operating\nin  the  FSM,  as  they  cannot  arrange  direct,  mortgage-secured  lending.  The  current  state\nmortgage statutes (except Kosrae, which has only a deed of trust) lack an efficient mechanism\nof nonjudicial foreclosure, redemption, and other procedures for the commercial banks to take a\nsecurity interest in the property including land leasehold. To address these land-related legal\nissues, the Government, with ADB's TA support,14 has developed model long-term land lease\nlaws and mortgage laws allowing land leasehold mortgage. These legislation drafts are deemed\nacceptable under the constitution and traditional land tenure system.\n29. Historically, regulation of foreign investment in the FSM required lengthy, case-by-case\nreview, and lacked transparency. This approach to foreign investment served to protect local\njobs, business opportunities, incomes, and resources. Under the PSRP, foreign investment\nregulations were mostly decentralized and attempts were made to improve transparency and\nliberalize the rules of entry of foreign investors. However, the current foreign investment laws at\nall five FSM national and state governments continue to discourage potential foreign investors\nwith complex application and discretionary approval systems. In May 2000, the governments\nreviewed the national and state foreign investment laws in May 2000 in order to improve the\ntransparency and consistency of foreign direct investment policies. This process was jointly\nassisted by ADB (footnote 14) and the Foreign Investment Advisory Service. The results of the\nreviews need to be implemented.\n30. A secured transactions law will enable lenders to effectively utilize almost any kind of\nproperty, other than land, as collateral and most especially chattels. This is important for small\ninvestors and business people wishing to start or expand informal or small businesses, as well\nas other investors. A short secured transactions law from the Trust Territory days has proven\ninadequate to protect lenders. The need for a replacement has long been recognized and a bill\nfor establishing a nationwide secured transaction system has been prepared. The FSM does not\ncurrently have any bankruptcy law in place. In the absence of a bankruptcy law, the commercial\nenvironment loses an important element of predictability and fairness, courts are called upon to\nmake legislative decisions, and struggling businesses, which might have succeeded, can be\ndestroyed prematurely by creditors intent on not being the last in line. The FSM recognizes the\nneed for national bankruptcy legislation, but such legislation lacks consensus.\n2.  Limited Access to Land and Security of User Rights\n31. The limited land area of the FSM, growing population, and increasing integration with the\nmarket economy are placing ever-increasing pressure on the traditions of ownership and call\n                  \n14 TA 2758-FSM: Improved Economic Use of Land, for $550,000, approved on 4 February 1997.", "10\nattention to the need for improved security of rights and land management and administration.\nVariable progress has been made among the four states on determining status and titling. In\nYap, for example, less than 10 percent of the land has been registered and titled over the 30\nyears since the state cadastral program commenced, largely due to the reluctance to initiate a\nsurvey that is likely to be disputed. Kosrae has made progress toward the initial determination of\nland parcels, although many disputes are pending resolution and the backlogs of parcels that\nawait completion of surveying and mapping is substantial. In Chuuk and Yap, limitations are due\nto the inability of the customary and formal civil systems to adjudicate and determine ownership\nas a prerequisite to registration and titling. Pohnpei has made the most progress with cadastral\nsurveys of private lands, and is currently addressing a large backlog of subdivision surveys.\n32. The institutions that support individual titles vary by state. In general, two government\ninstitutions administer land tenure: land commissions (Kosrae and Yap) or the Court of Land\nTenure (Pohnpei), and the divisions of land management (all states). Each of these institutions\nhas a number of capacity limitations resulting in slow titling and registration. The general use of\nthe US land-titling system over the past 50 years was largely supply-driven, and its variable\neffectiveness  indicates  a  range  of  problems  and  inefficiencies  in  service  delivery,  or\ninappropriate integration with traditional systems and, consequently, a low level of demand for\nthe system in its current form. An ongoing ADB TA (footnote 14) is conducting public education\non land registration law, regulations, procedures, and the benefits of registering all landholdings.\nIn Kosrae, a bill has been introduced to strengthen the Land Commission; in Chuuk, there is an\nagreement in principle to merge land survey and the Land Commission to improve institutional\ncapacity; and, in Yap, proposals have been made for time-bound dispute settlement through the\nmunicipal courts. In Pohnpei, advanced survey, mapping, and digital archive equipment were\npurchased under a 1996 US Department of Interior grant (approximately $600,000), but the\nequipment is not being utilized to its full potential due to limitations in training and problems\nexperienced with implementing TA. These initiatives indicate a clear understanding in all four\nFSM states of the need to determine and title land.\n33. The agencies involved in land administration and management are faced with a broad\nrange of demanding tasks. State land administration agencies lack up-to-date equipment across\nall areas of activity and need skill and technical training. The FSM state land administration\nagencies do not have the resource base to catch up on the backlog of work in each state; keep\nup with the everyday requirements for surveying, mapping, and land transfer functions; or\nprovide for a secure and accessible land record-keeping system. In Chuuk, Kosrae, and Yap,\nthe  land  administration  offices  are  environmentally  unsafe  or  insecure  for  computer\nmodernization to assist with record processing and storage, and the present facilities for record\narchiving are unsound. A land use plan exists in Pohnpei, which is necessary for public health,\nsafety, and environmental protection, but is excessively restrictive and complex, limiting usability\nand having a negative impact on private sector development. None of the states currently have\nany valuation methodology or skills to support the determination of fair market assessment of\ntransaction prices for land rights. Markets that do exist are nonconventional and imperfect as a\nhigh measure of judgment is exercised hindering the transfer processes from both owner and\nbuyer perspectives.\n3.  Limited Access of Small Businesses to Finance\n34. A high level of liquidity exists in the FSM banking system, mostly invested offshore. The\nloan to deposit ratio was 34 percent in FY1990, rose to a high of 51 percent in FY1994, and fell\nto 43 percent in FY1999. This does not reflect a lack of support for the domestic economy by\nthe banks, but is indicative of other impediments to increased lending. The commercial banks", "11\nare reluctant to increase lending to the private sector because of the risky nature of start-up and\nsmall business lending, absence of effective legal provisions for securing loans against suitable\ncollateral, as well as difficulties in foreclosure procedures. This is exacerbated by (i) commercial\nbank perceptions that applicants lack business experience and commercial know-how, (ii) the\nlack of bankable propositions, and (iii) to varying degrees, the capacity of banks to effectively\nsupport lending in the productive sectors. Even if they were prepared to lend, foreign and\ndomestic commercial banks are reluctant to provide commercial loans below $10,000 due to\nhigh  administration  costs  and  are  mostly  limited  to  short-term  working  capital  loans  for\nestablished and reliable businesses. The preferred bank for commercial lending is the FSMDB\ndue to lower interest rates (9 percent) and longer repayment terms, but slow response to loan\napplications and perceived poor service limits access to the bank\u2019s loan capital. A survey\nconducted  under  TA  3278  (footnote  1)  revealed  that  only  40  percent  of  businesses  have\napproached a financing institution for a loan.15\n35. FSMDB has made a greater contribution to the demand for start-up and expanding\nbusiness capital than other commercial banks. FSMDB already has four state branches and\nsufficient staff, including those for outreach services to outer islands. Unlike other Pacific island\ndevelopment banks, its financial position is strong with relatively low debt (2.75 percent of bank-\nowned assets), and a high level of cash and investments (50 percent of bank-owned assets).\nSignificant revenues are earned on investment income and in FY1999 the FSMDB recorded net\nearnings of $421,444 after provision for bad and doubtful debts ($650,000). It is seeking to\nimprove access for small borrowers in several ways. First, loan approval authority for loans of\nless than $50,000 has been decentralized to the branches. Second, under the newly launched\nOutreach Program, branch staff are traveling to the rural areas and outer islands to hold\ncommunity  meetings.  Outputs  under  the  program  are  reflected  in  the  bank's  annual\nmanagement by objectives document, which sets objectives for outer island loans as well as\nsmall loans generally. Third, equity or margin requirements have been waived for agricultural,\nfisheries, and manufacturing loans of less than $10,000 and application procedures simplified.\nFourth, Kosrae and Chuuk branches have reduced minimum loan size to $500, the former in\nconnection with an agricultural loan scheme in which 180 loans have been made to participants\nof a special training course organized by Kosrae MEDC in collaboration with the extension\ndepartments. By May 2000, the Chuuk branch had already approved 20 small loans (of below\n$1,000) against its target of 50 for 2000 and is processing the remaining 30. Seven of the 20\nloans were provided to the trainees of the Chuuk MEDC, and 13 to women. The Chuuk branch\nalso made 7 of the 20 loans under a separate management by objectives target to outer\nislanders. Partly as a result of the new FSMDB emphasis on reaching small borrowers, average\nloan size in 2000 until May was much lower ($17,241) than the cumulative average of $76,000\nsince the commencement of lending in 1982. Less than 2 percent of the bank's lending has\nbeen in loans of less than $10,000. This share is expected to increase.\n36. But, despite recent improvements in FSMDB's financial position and its recent initiatives\nto increase support to start-up and small business, the bank needs to be more responsive to\nlocal  state  requirements  and  more  effective  in  providing  banking  services.  A  number  of\nweaknesses must be addressed to improve FSMDB services, including an unclear corporate\nmission, past political interference, and operational problems. If FSMDB is to play a pivotal role\nin private sector development, then improvements are needed in management from the board\n                  \n15 Approximately 70 percent of the financing in starting the business comes from the owners\u2019 cash contribution (40\npercent) and personal assets (30  percent). Bank financing constitutes only 23 percent of start-up capital. Working\ncapital is predominantly self-financed.", "12\nlevel to senior and midlevel management, through to service staff, especially in the outreach\nprogram to start-up and small business.\n4.  Inadequate Business Support Services for SMEs\n37. SMEs  in  the  FSM  suffer  from  a  number  of  problems  including  a  general  lack  of\nentrepreneurial tradition; lack of understanding of domestic markets; inadequate sources of\ninformation on products and technologies; nonavailability or high cost of tools and equipment;\nlack of supplies and high cost of raw materials and intermediate inputs, most of which must be\nimported; and high cost of fuel, transport, and communications. The development of exports is\neven more difficult given the lack of exposure and experience in export markets. With the\nexception of local ocean fishery operators, most SMEs can be described as nonexporters, start-\nups, or occasional exporters.\n38. The  MEDC  project  (footnote  10)  has  developed  a  useful  program  of  training  for\nentrepreneurship and business proposal preparation, and to a lesser extent, advisory services\nfor  start-up  and  small  businesses.  In  particular,  MEDCs  have  been  promoting  tripartite\noperations to help small business involved with the FSMDB small loan program; MEDCs also\nwork with nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to promote the participation of women. All state\nMEDCs are located in the state department of commerce and industry except in Pohnpei where\nthe MEDC operates as an attached unit to the Department of Resource Management and\nDevelopment. Under a weak governance environment, the current status of the MEDC raises\nconcerns  of  potential  clients  over  protection  of  business  secrets.  Typically,  a  director  or\nadministrator; one to two local business advisers; one to two expatriate business advisers,\nusually international volunteers; plus an administrative assistant/secretary comprise the MEDC\nstaff. Its limited staff base and provision of general business and entrepreneurship development\ncannot satisfy the demand for postbusiness start-up counseling and extension type-support. As\nbusinesses develop, the range and demand for services is expanding, including more specific\nmarket and product information, advice on joint ventures and other more sophisticated business\narrangements raised in the TA business survey (footnote 1).16 Increased MEDC staff capacity is\nurgently needed to meet the expanding demands of the nascent and diverse private sector. In\nparticular, additional specialist staff in state business support centers and improved interagency\nlinkages are necessary to meet more specific support needs for business.\nD.  Government Expenditure\n39. Government expenditures for the private sector have focused on directly participating in\ncommercial activities through public sector enterprises and their own agencies, rather than\nmaintaining sound policy and legal systems and securing essential public services and physical\ninfrastructure  to  support  private  sector  development.  Since  1987  the  national  and  state\ngovernments have invested approximately $300 million in public enterprises. Audit reports in\n1998 indicate that the Government provided $6.6 million in operating subsidies, other grants\nand subsidies, and new capital contributions.17 The government expenditures for private sector\nsupport services focus on salaries, while expenditures for nonwage operational costs and new\ninvestments are limited.\n                  \n16 Eighty-five percent of respondents considered they needed training by order of preference in business skills (such\nas  in  marketing,  customer  service,  etc.),  entrepreneurship  and  management,  accounting/bookkeeping,  and\ntechnical skills. More than 80 percent of the respondents considered a need for on-business advisory services,\nprimarily in solving business problems and preparing business plans. Other advisory needs are in obtaining\nbusiness information and preparing loan proposals.\n17 Operating losses in the same period were $12.5 million.", "13\n40. Land Administration. The land survey and registration agencies, land commissions,\nand land courts are funded through state budgets. In FY2000, the agencies combined were\nallocated a total of $0.94 million, of which 90.6 percent was for salaries and 9.4 percent was for\nnonpersonnel recurrent costs. This level of expenditure covers two to three adjudication and\nsurvey teams per state and agency support staff, but is insufficient for the high nonsalary\nrecurrent costs of fieldwork, especially in the dispersed outer islands of Chuuk, Pohnpei, and\nYap.\n41. Development Banking. The FSM Congress appropriated $1.5 million in 1998 and $1.0\nmillion in 1999 for capital increases of the FSM Development Bank (FSMDB) bringing total\nequity up to $29.5 million. FSMDB also administers, in a trustee capacity, three separate funds\nwith combined assets of $16.1 million at the end of 1999. The most important of these is the\nInvestment Development Fund which aims to promote large-scale local economic development\nprojects through joint FSM-US investment partnership arrangements. The FSMDB\u2019s budget\ndemonstrates that it can potentially increase its lending portfolio over 3 to 4 years by $10 million\nto over $30 million, without any further injection of capital funds. With FSMDB\u2019s large investment\nreserves, no additional equity funds are currently needed.\n42. Business Development Support. The UNDP/United Nations Industrial Development\nOrganization  (UNIDO)-supported  Micronesian  Entrepreneur  Development  Center  (MEDC)\nproject started in 1993 in Pohnpei. Since the start of the MEDC Phase II program in 1996, the\nnational Government, through appropriations obtained from the FSM Congress, has directly\ncontributed to the budget of the MEDC program. The total contribution of the FSM Government\nwas $0.55 million during the last five fiscal years (1996/2000). In addition, state governments\nprovide in-kind and budgetary contributions for center operations including office facilities, staff\nsalaries, and other operation and maintenance costs.\nE. Government Objectives and Strategy\n43. The change in government policy from public sector-led growth to private sector-led\ngrowth, initiated through the PSRP, represents a fundamental shift in strategy for the FSM.\nPolicy initiatives under way include restraining government employment and wages, reforming\npublic enterprises, promoting foreign investment, liberalizing banking regulations, improving\nleaseholds, and improving business support. However, the Government is also realizing the\ncomplexities  of  these  initiatives  and  what  is  involved  in  the  shift  from  government-led\ndevelopment to a private sector-led approach. Hurdles include the process of developing public\nunderstanding; refining policies and strategies; gaining acceptance; passing laws; and most\nimportantly, effectively implementing agreed programs. The Second FSM Economic Summit\nprovided an opportunity to discuss and develop specific policies, strategies, and activities to\nsupport private sector development. The results are detailed in the private sector development\npolicy matrix, which comprises five key elements.\n44. The first element focuses on commitment to economic reforms by maintaining financial\nstability. Implementation strategies include maintaining balanced budgets and a low level of\nexternal debt by avoiding net increase in public service employment levels; developing and\nenforcing  effective  conflict  of  interest  laws;  balancing  tax  increases  with  corresponding\ngovernment  expenditure  reductions,  and  elimination  of  inefficiencies  and  misallocations;\nremoving  distortions  of  the  current  tax  regimes;  and  establishing  medium-term  revenue\nneutrality (no increase in tax burden).", "14\n45. The second policy element aims to develop an outward looking approach to economic\ndevelopment by developing a tax regime consistent with outward-oriented economic strategy,\nand eliminating distortions arising from the current tax system; and encouraging investment in\npriority  and  potentially  competitive  export  growth  industries.  Strategies  include  creating  an\nattractive environment for investors by developing transparent laws and regulations supportive\nof investors; and promoting investment in priority industries, especially exports.\n46. The  third  policy  element  emphasizes  lowering  costs,  improving  performance,  and\ndeveloping competitive markets for resources. Policies and strategies for land, labor, and capital\ninclude the following:\n(i)  Labor policies. Ensure labor is wage competitive by reducing public-private\nsector wage differentials, increase labor productivity and competitiveness, and\ndirect human resource development investment to skill gaps for priority growth\nindustries.\n(ii)  Land  policies.  Make  land  more  readily  available  to  those  who  need  it  for\ndevelopment, facilitate the use of land as collateral to increase availability of\ndevelopment financing, regulate land use to promote desirable and more efficient\nindustry clusters, and avoid incompatible and unsustainable uses.\n(iii)  Finance policies. Reduce the risks of bank lending and borrowing for domestic\nbusiness and exports, reduce disincentives arising from the risks of business\nlosses for unrecoverable debt, broaden the quality and scope of bank financial\nservices and products, and build responsiveness to the working and investment\ncapital needs for business development in priority industries.\n47. The fourth policy element emphasizes reorienting public agencies and administration to\nfacilitate private sector development, decreasing the cost and increasing the ease of doing\nbusiness, promoting good governance, and minimizing government involvement in commercial\nand service activity. Two main areas are covered:\n(i)  Regulatory  environment.  Develop  a  corporate  and  business  enabling  and\nregulatory environment that promotes a private sector capable of generating\nlong-term economic value and respects the interests of stakeholders and society.\n(ii)  Commercialization and business development support. Support competitive\ntradable goods and services; focus on efficient, coordinating, support services\nproviding  information,  advice,  and  training,  not  subsidized  finance;  support\nbusiness development at all levels experience and growth; and allow the market\nto determine the value and commercial viability of state-owned, production-type\nenterprises earmarked for privatization.\n48. The fifth policy element comprises providing efficient and cost-effective infrastructure to\nsupport competitive private sector development by removing infrastructure-related production\nconstraints through feasible public investments, adequate operation and maintenance, and\nensuring coordination in the provision of social service infrastructure to support economic and\nprivate sector development.\n49. The impetus for the private sector development policies emerged from the Government\u2019s\nrecognition that proactive steps are needed to promote private sector-led growth, especially in", "15\nview of the sector's slow response to public sector downsizing. The participants of the Second\nFSM Economic Summit noted that while much progress had been made since the First Summit\nin  1995,  more  active,  coherent  policy  monitoring  and  implementation  is  definitely  needed\nthroughout the FSM. Therefore, the membership of the State-National Leadership Conferences\nwas formalized as the FSM Economic Policy Implementation Council (EPIC). With a goal of\nimproving  economic  policy  monitoring  and  implementation  support,  EPIC  will  comprise\nexecutive and legislative leaders from the national and state governments. DEA acts as the\nEPIC secretariat. Policy-focused meetings will be convened at least every May and October in\nconjunction with regular session of the FSM Congress. The PSDP and its implementation\nshould integrate with these newly instituted mechanisms and structures.\nF. External Assistance to the Sector\n50. The US Compact assistance is a major influence in the FSM economy. The assistance\nprovided through the Compact includes a block grant of which no less than 40 percent must be\nallocated to capital improvement projects. In addition, goods with a domestic value added of 30\npercent or more are eligible for duty-free access to the US with the exception of canned tuna\nand certain products for the garment industry. In addition, the FSM receives no-cost assistance\nfor weather services, emergency management, and aviation administration from US agencies.\nThe US Congress also agreed to provide the FSM with access to services and programs of the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Small Business Administration, Economic Development\nAdministration, and Job Partnership Training Act, among others. The US Department of Interior,\nthrough additional federal grant programs available to the FSM, has also provided assistance to\nthe Pohnpei Division of Lands to automate the surveying and mapping functions to speed up the\nprocesses of cadastral surveying and mapping. The US Peace Corps provides volunteers to a\nwide range of sectors, including education, agriculture, and commerce and industry.\n51. Japan  provides  an  assistance  package  each  year  to  the  four  FSM  states  and  the\nnational Government on a rotating basis, usually for infrastructure and fisheries projects. A small\ngrant fund is also administered by the Japanese Embassy that targets community self-help\nactivities and other small-scale development projects. Since 1995, the embassy has awarded\napproximately $10 million to small projects. A Japan International Cooperation Agency TA\ncommenced in August 2000 to restart the former Micronesia Maritime Academy in Yap in\ncooperation with the College of Micronesia-FSM. Each year, approximately 20 Micronesians\nfrom  the  government  and  private  sector  are  funded  for  Japan-based  training  in  social,\neconomic, and business-related areas.\n52. UNDP has had an active program in the FSM since its independence. In the past, the\nprogram included extensive support to agriculture (pepper, poultry, veterinary services, and crop\nprotection). This type of assistance to specific enterprises has been curtailed due to lack of\nfunding. The UNDP/UNIDO assistance to the SME sector has expanded successfully from a\nproject piloted in Pohnpei State executed by UNIDO to the establishment of the MEDCs.\n53. Australia  provides  assistance  in  the  area  of  land  administration  for  developing\ngeographic  information  systems  in  Kosrae  and  Pohnpei.  The  Australian  Government  has\nprovided a small grant to the Pohnpei MEDC to conduct training in business extension services\nto rural entrepreneurs. Experienced senior volunteers have offered a variety of training related\nto business and business management to public agencies and the private sector.\n54. The World Bank provides assistance to the FSM through its regional programs. The\nForeign  Investment  Advisory  Service,  cofinanced  by  the  World  Bank  and  ADB,  has  been", "16\nproviding advisory services throughout the review and revision process for the FSM\u2019s foreign\ninvestment laws and regulations. Direct assistance is being provided through the South Pacific\nProject  Facility  to  the  FSM\u2019s  private  sector  fisheries  businesses.  ADB  TA  has  assisted  a\nPohnpei-based  longliner  company  in  operations  management  and  the  Pohnpei  Longline\nFisheries Association in assessing alternative air freight arrangements.\n55. The Pacific Islands Small Business Development Centers Network, based in Guam,\nprovides assistance and an annual grant of $30,000 to the Yap SBDC. The Pacific Business\nCenter of the University of Hawaii continues to provide advisory services to the government and\nbusinesses in the states of Chuuk and Yap. Even though the connections and networks from\nthe two programs have proven valuable, their visits are limited to four times a year for about two\nweeks per visit.\nG. ADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n1.  Strategy\n56. ADB\u2019s country operational strategy reflects the Government\u2019s own development strategy\naimed  at  implementing  the  economic  reforms  presented  to  the  Fourth  Consultative  Group\nMeeting. ADB\u2019s current strategy focuses on public sector rationalization and private sector\ndevelopment through key reforms to land, labor, and capital market institutions. This strategy\nwas confirmed by the national and state governments as well as by the private sector and\nNGOs. Given the federal government structure in the FSM, ADB operations give increased\nattention to individual states\u2019 development needs and is strongly linked with their performance\nand commitment to reform.\n2.  Operations\n57. ADB loans have been approved for the PSRP, a water supply and sanitation project, and\na  fisheries  development  project.  While  the  overall  objective  of  the  PSRP  was  to  achieve\nsustainable economic growth through private sector development, the focus during program\nimplementation was placed on the fiscal adjustment and downsizing of governments rather than\nthe  medium-  to  long-term  goal  of  establishing  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector\ndevelopment. The ADB project for fisheries development experienced mixed performance due\nto the lack of a favorable sector policy and governance environment.\n58. ADB TAs have focused on good governance and capacity building. To improve the\ngovernance and institutional capacity for private sector development, a TA was provided in the\nareas of economic policy formulation, performance-based budgeting, public sector enterprise\nreform, land management, financial sector review, and fisheries management.18\n59. Lessons learned from ADB operations in the sector include (i) ADB\u2019s projects need to be\nconsistent with individual state needs and performance, including their commitment to reform;\n(ii) to create a policy and legal environment that is more business friendly, reforms should\n                  \n18 TA 2786: Investment Promotion and Financial Sector Review, for $380,000, approved on 8 April 1997; TA 2832:\nFisheries Management and Development, for $934,000, approved on 2 July 1997; TA 2983: Performance-Based\nPublic Resource Allocation, for $988,000, approved on 26 January 1998; TA 3024: Economic Policy Reform and\nManagement, for $2,877,000, approved on 12 May 1998; TA 3201: Privatization of Public Enterprises and\nCorporate Governance, for $450,000, approved on 9 June 1999; and TA 3258: Strengthening the National\nStatistical System, for $400,000, approved on 21 September 1999.", "17\nprecede ADB\u2019s investments in revenue-generating sectors; and (iii) weak local capacity should\nbe taken into consideration in preparing projects.\n3.  Policy Dialogue\n60. ADB is assisting the Government to develop and implement its continued economic\nreforms aimed at private sector-led growth. As a result of continued policy dialogue with ADB,\nthe national Government has identified private sector development as the primary development\ngoal and developed future policy actions and implementation mechanisms through the Second\nFSM Economic Summit in 1999. Subsequently, the PSDP (2000) and TA 3278 (footnote 1)\nwere reflected in the ADB country assistance program 2000/02. To avoid risk of duplication and\nmaximize ADB resources available for the FSM, ADB coordinated its ongoing TAs whose\noutputs have strong links with those of the TA for the PSDP. These include TAs for economic\npolicy management, improved use of land, public enterprise reform and corporate governance,\nfinancial sector review, and national statistics strengthening. UNDP also participated in the\nGovernment\u2019s formulation of PSDP through the involvement of MEDC staff and consultants.\n61. During TA 3278 implementation, the fourth Consultative Group Meeting was held at ADB\nheadquarters in February 2000. The FSM Government demonstrated its willingness to stay the\ncourse of reforms and to adopt a concrete policy framework to implement the reforms. ADB and\nother development partners commended the Government\u2019s development strategy for achieving\na self-reliant economy through private sector development.\nIV.  THE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\nA.  Rationale\n62. The FSM's major challenge is to accelerate private sector development as the main\nengine of growth, particularly in the productive sectors (fisheries, agriculture, and tourism),\nwhich  are  to  provide  alternative  sources  of  foreign  exchange  to  reduce  the  country's\ndependence on external assistance as well as generate employment for the rapidly growing\npopulation. The proposed PSDP is to assist the Government in implementing its economic\ndevelopment  strategy  for  private  sector-led  economic  growth.  Preparation  of  the  Program\ninvolved a high level of public discussion and participation.\n63. The PSDP will seek to induce an increase in the production of tradable goods for\ndomestic  and  export  markets,  as  well  as  a  competitive  nontradable  service  sector.\nImprovements in access to and the use of land for economic activity is required, including\naccelerated titling and registration, extended lease terms, and the ability to use land and other\nproperty as collateral to access finance for business development. Access to capital and finance\nfor business development can be enhanced by improving the enabling legal framework and\nfinancial  services  for  start-up  and  expansion  of  SMEs.  A  price-competitive  labor  force  is\nrequired with the skills needed by the private sector. Finally, while the choice of business activity\nis entirely a matter for the private sector, advisory support is needed for informal and formal\nSMEs to develop private sector distribution channels, assist with product diversification and\nprovision of market information, change product positioning to fit consumer demand, improve\nthe stability and reliability of supply, improve communication, develop price competitiveness,\nand assist in focusing on core competencies through a better matching of internal and external\nfactors.", "18\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n64. The goal of the PSDP is to promote economic growth by expanding the FSM private\nsector,  thereby  raising  domestic  employment  and  incomes,  and  reducing  dependence  on\nexternal assistance. To attain this goal, the PSDP's objectives are to (i) improve the policy and\nlegal environment for private sector development; and (ii) strengthen capacity to manage land,\nlabor, and capital resources.\n65. The PSDP's scope is national and statewide. The PSDP includes (i) a policy framework\nand actions and (ii) an investment project aimed at improving performance of the public services\nto promote private sector development. The investment project comprises (i) establishing a\nsecured transaction system; (ii) providing institutional capacity building for land administration\nand management, financial support to SMEs, and business development support; and (iii)\nstrengthening the capacity for coordinating and monitoring the PSDP. The investment project\ndescription is attached as Supplementary Appendix A.\nC.  Policy Framework and Actions\n66. The PSDP is built on consensus generated at the Second Economic Summit and local\ncommitment to the overall reform effort. A policy matrix was developed by translating the policy\nframework for private sector development endorsed at the Summit. To maximize the impact of\nthe reforms, policy actions and the time frame in the policy matrix reflects key factors including\n(i) differences in each state\u2019s financial and legal situation, (ii) local acceptance of reforms\nincluding land-related reforms, (iii) local implementation capacity, and (iv) availability of current\nand future external resources to support the reform measures. Quantifiable and monitorable\ntargets have been identified and are integrated into the program framework in Appendix 1. The\ndevelopment policy letter and policy matrix are in appendixes 2 and 3.\n1.  Maintain Economic and Public Sector Reforms\na.  Maintenance of Balanced Budgets\n67. In general, the expansionist fiscal policies in the FSM national and state governments\nprior to FY1996 led to a more difficult and painful adjustment process following the second step-\ndown in Compact funding. However, in facing up to the necessary adjustments to declining\ntransfers, the response has been positive, with small budget surpluses in FY1998 and FY1999.\nRecent  efforts  and  successes  in  improving  fiscal  management  and  discipline  must  be\nmaintained, and where possible, extended to avoid previous public financial crises that affected\nthe delivery of essential public services and private sector growth. Over time, faster private\nsector growth should be encouraged, and the ratio of government expenditure to GDP allowed\nto fall to less than 50 percent of GDP. Fiscal discipline and financial stability are required to\nimprove business and investor confidence in the FSM economy. The governments are therefore\ncommitted to maintaining balanced budgets for FY2002/04 on total current revenues and grants\nless current expenditures.\nb.  Maintenance of Government Payroll Levels and Reduction of Public\nto Private Sector Wage Differentials\n68. An important component of the PSRP was reducing government size and operating\ncosts. However, the emphasis has changed. In certain states, the reductions are continuing with\nthe intention of restructuring the civil service to be smaller, but staffed with better-qualified", "19\npersonnel. The reduction of government employment is an important step in reducing labor\nmarket competition between government and the private sector, and increasing the availability\nof skilled and qualified labor. Limiting the size of government by avoiding a net increase in\npublic  service  payrolls  will  ensure  that  the  size  of  the  civil  service  does  not  become  an\nunsustainable financial burden or a source of competition for labor with the private sector. Pay\nrestraints are important to remove pay differentials; the public to private sector ratio is currently\n1:8. Payroll ceilings consistent with medium-term fiscal balance for FY2002 will be set at a level\nthat does not exceed the PSRP FY1999 target for the ratio of wages to total expenditures for\neach national and state government. In FY2003 and FY2004 these ceilings will be maintained\nwith small upward adjustments.\nc.  Sound Management of the FSM Trust Fund\n69. In 1999, the FSM began negotiations with the US for a new package of assistance once\nthe current package expires in 2001. In essence, future Compact payments are expected to\ncover not only agreed areas of assistance, but also regular payments into the FSM Trust Fund\nto ensure a self-sustaining stream of revenue for government operations after a possible second\nCompact agreement expires. A law for establishing the FSM Trust Fund was enacted, and the\nnational Government has appropriated $4 million to date. A prudent measure is to increase the\ncommitment to the future financial stability of the FSM by increasing savings and investment in\nthe FSM Trust Fund. If the current Compact agreement is extended for two years, at least half\nof the 27.5 percent increase of budgetary support under the Compact base grant for FY2002\nand FY2003 will be placed into the FSM Trust Fund. This would avoid a short-term reexpansion\nof public spending and contribute to the FSM's future financial independence.\nd.  Sound Management of External Debt\n70. Prior to FY1990, the FSM had no official public debt to offshore lenders. Between\nFY1990 and FY1993, total official external debt increased to a peak of $137 million in FY1993\nrepresenting 66 percent of GDP. Since FY1993, the only official debt has been through ADB\u2019s\nconcessional lending facility. While the situation was adverse in the early 1990s, it will be\nsustainable by 2002 following completion of payment of a medium-term note program. By\nFY2001, the debt to GDP ratio is expected to be 24 percent. While this situation appears to be\nrelatively good, the uncertainties over Compact renegotiations and future debt service capacity\nare still cause for caution and for avoiding resurgence of unsustainable external debt. The\ncurrent policy is to maintain a low and sustainable level of net external debt. Accordingly, the\nGovernment has committed that the debt-to-GDP ratio will not exceed 24 percent in FY2002;\nthis ratio will be maintained during FY2003 and FY2004.\ne.  Progress in Public Sector Enterprise Reforms\n71. Vigorous implementation of public sector enterprise (PSE) reforms is required to reduce\nthe  government  budgetary  burden  of  nonperforming  PSEs  and  eliminate  public  sector\ncompetition with the private sector. The three-year phased ADB TA (footnote 13) of which the\nfirst  phase  was  implemented  in  2000,  facilitated  the  development  of  a  framework  for  and\nimplementation of PSE reforms. The Public Enterprise Unit was established in DEA in 2000 to\nmanage  the  process.  To  fulfill  the  policy  of  reducing  losses,  increasing  private  sector\nopportunities,  and  eliminating  public  sector  competition  with  the  private  sector,  the  five\ngovernments will identify priority enterprises to be privatized and set specific national and state\ntargets. Preliminary candidate public enterprises for privatization were identified in September\n2000 through a participatory process with government and other stakeholders. Following this,", "20\ndraft master plans for PSE reforms were completed during this year. At least one PSE reform by\neach national and state government will be implemented by August 2003.\n2.  Improve the Legal Environment for Private Sector Development\na.  Pass Laws to Improve Use of Land and Property as Loan Security\n72. The FSM is addressing a number of issues in the legal and regulatory environment by\nextending minimum lease terms and improving access to finance through leasehold mortgage\nlending. The long-term, land-lease system will make land more readily available without having\nto amend constitutions. Effective security mechanisms using leasehold mortgages will help\navoid many of the freehold mortgage problems by making foreclosure a less daunting prospect.\nAn ADB TA for improved use of land has proposed model state legislation and forms for\ndeveloping  a  system  of  long-term  land  leasing  and  leasehold  mortgaging.  Wide  public\nawareness campaigns on modernizing the land market were completed in 2000 by a local NGO\nunder the TA. The legal reforms to enable the improved use of land (footnote 14) and property\nas loan security include (i) amendment of state land-lease laws, and (ii) passage of state\nmortgage laws. Long-term, land-lease legislation will be drafted by November 2001 and enacted\nby August 2003. At the end of the program, a secured transaction system will be established\nunder  the  investment  Project  to  enable  banks  to  increase  mortgage-secured  commercial\nlending.\nb.  Improve Foreign Direct Investment Laws and Regulations\n73. In May 2000, the governments reviewed the current foreign direct investment laws with\nthe assistance of experts funded by the Foreign Investment Advisory Service and ADB. Specific\nrecommendations have been made for new foreign direct investment systems with improved\ntransparency and consistency in the national and state governments. A core objective is to\nsimplify the application procedures and reduce discretionary reviews and approvals. Revised and\nimproved foreign investment laws and regulations will be put into effect by August 2003.\n3.  Adjustment Costs of the Reforms\n74. Public  enterprise  reform  will  result  in  several  costs,  including  possible  redundancy\npayments; loss of earnings to displaced workers during the transition to the private sector; and\nother restructuring, divestiture, and liquidation expenses. In FY1998, public enterprise wages\nwere $10.3 million. The workforce reduction under the proposed PSE reforms was estimated at\n10  percent  of  the  total  PSE  workforce.  A  redundancy  payment  of  two  years  for  released\nworkers, which was applied to early retirees under the PSRP, will require about $1.5 million in\n2003. Retraining costs through the existing vocational training programs are estimated at $2.0\nmillion. Administrative and legal expenses for PSE reform are estimated at $1.5 million. These\ncosts will be partly offset by reducing subsidies to loss-making enterprises.\n75. The proposed policy loan will help finance the total adjustment costs estimated at $5.0\nmillion, while maintaining fiscal discipline by keeping Government expenditures in line with\nrevenues. The costs of improving the institutional infrastructure for private sector development\nwill be met through the investment Project.", "21\nD.  The Investment Project\n76. Strengthening  the  institutional  infrastructure  of  the  national  and  state  agencies  is\nrequired to improve the environment for private sector development. The investment Project\ncomprises three components: component A, establishment of a secured transactions system;\ncomponent  B,  strengthening  of  institutional  capacity  to  support  PSD  including  state  land\nadministration, FSMDB, and state MECs; and component C, program and project management.\n1.  Establishment of a Secured Transactions System\n77. The  first  component  is  to  establish  a  secured  transaction  system  through  secured\ntransactions laws and chattel mortgage registries in the national and state governments. The\nexisting state and national government secured transaction laws will be reviewed. To resolve a\njurisdictional  problem  between  the  national  and  state  governments  in  this  area,  a\ncomprehensive  national  secured  transaction  law  is  proposed  that  will  override  state  laws;\nhowever, a state can still have its own secured transaction law. Once a mortgage is filed in a\nstate under a state law, it can also qualify under national law. Under the proposed bill at the\nnational Congress, a single nationwide system will be set up with offices in each state where\nfilings can be made and searches obtained. The computerized chattel mortgage registry will be\nestablished within state land administration and the registrar\u2019s office in Palikir. A significant\nnumber of additional staff are not required within the registries; however, hardware will be\nsupplied and installed, software provided, and training given to establish a central electronic\ndata bank for secured transactions filings, with real-time links to each of the state field offices.\nThis will take the form of a web site in which concerned persons including bankers, and\nattorneys, and the field offices can search for filings against a certain debtor.\n2.  Strengthening  of  Institutional  Capacity  to  Support  Private  Sector\nDevelopment\n78. The second component aims to strengthen the institutional capacity of the national and\nstate agencies providing essential services to support private business development.\na.  Land Administration and Management\n79. This subcomponent aims to (i) promote the modernization and development of the land\nregistration  and  cadastral  systems;  (ii)  expedite  the  issuance  of  land  titles  by  improving\nprocedures for adjudication, survey, and registration; (iii) support state initiatives to develop an\nappropriate  judicial  framework  related  to  land  dispute  resolution;  (iv)  support  appropriate\nsystems for zoning and land use planning; and, (v) develop land valuation methodologies and\ntrain officials from each of the states in the valuation methodology.\n80. The investment will provide for three inputs. (i) Civil works: the construction of new,\npurpose-built  offices  for  the  land  agencies  in  Chuuk,  Kosrae,  and  Yap  to  provide  secure\ntemperature  and  humidity-controlled  vaults  for  records,  temperature-controlled  computing\nrooms, and a secure public access area. In Pohnpei, the existing building housing the Land\nTenure Court will be renovated to provide a secure, temperature and humidity controlled vault\nfor records and to rewire the building. (ii) Equipment: modern survey equipment will be provided\nto automate the survey and mapping functions (global positioning system receivers, total station\ntheodolites, and computer hardware and software); Pohnpei's experience with US doIlar funding\nshows that productivity can be at least doubled, while other countries have found that significant\ncost reductions can be achieved and new and simplified practices and methods introduced to", "22\nreduce cost per land parcel survey from $550 per parcel to $30 per parcel). The new technology\ncombined with the implementation of new practices and methods will achieve corresponding\nreductions in time. New technology (computer hardware and software) will also be introduced to\nautomate the registration activities to speed up the issuance of titles and reduce the possibility\nfor fraud and corruption. The automated survey and registration systems will be integrated to\nproduce time and cost savings. (iii) Consulting services and training: these will be provided to\nstrengthen  the  institutional,  administrative  aspects  of  the  land-titling  process,  including  in\nparticular,  in  Chuuk  and  Yap,  new  and  simplified  adjudication  (land  dispute  settlement\nprocedures). The survey and mapping consulting will include a course in survey and mapping to\ncreate a cadre of licensed surveyors to enable the ultimate privatization of these functions, with\nparticular emphasis on the privatization of the survey and mapping functions in Pohnpei State\nduring project implementation; legal consulting services will be provided to amend existing\nlegislation, as appropriate. All states will benefit from the proposed valuation consulting, which\nwill develop a valuation methodology and train state representatives in valuation to ensure an\nequitable  and  transparent  valuation  service.  Finally,  this  subcomponent  will  help  Pohnpei\nimplement a simplified land use master plan and implement a geographic information system to\nmonitor its implementation.\nb.  Financial Services to SMEs\n81. While commercial bank lending will be encouraged by developing enabling mortgage\nlegislation, development banking services for SMEs will be improved through an integrated\nprogram  of  technical  and  in-service  training  assistance  for  FSMDB.  This  program  will\ncommence with a program of training and support to FSMDB\u2019s board on governance issues,\nroles, and duties. Under a new corporate plan,19 FSMDB will focus on business promotion,\ncustomer service, financial sustainability, and development of human resources. FSMDB will\ndevelop the existing management by objectives system with each state branch setting lending,\ncollection, and profit objectives. FSMDB will increase branch-level authority in response to\nincreased  capacity  and  to  overcome  the  past  constraints  of  centralized  decision  making.\nSpecific attention will be given to developing FSMDB's new outreach program, which will be\nespecially important for delivering effective financial services to start-ups and small business. A\nskills audit will assess the training needs of individuals relative to their job descriptions and a\ncomprehensive training program will be developed. A long-term integrated program for capacity\nbuilding,  including  the  full-time  attachment  of  a  senior  development  banking  adviser,  and\ntraining and advice by short-term experts in the fields of information and computer systems and\nhuman resource development will be provided.\nc.  Small Business Development Services\n82. The MEDCs will be strengthened to provide a comprehensive small business support\nservice,  improved  delivery  of  skills  training,  and  a  labor  market  information  system.  The\nstrengthened MEDCs will be renamed small business development centers (SBDCs) and will\nalso expand their outreach business extension services to the informal sector, outer islands,\nwomen and youth, and targeted priority sectors. This will require the delivery of business\ntraining  and  advisory  services  that  closely  consider  factors  such  as  the  current  level  of\ncommercialization, business development, and educational attainment of beneficiaries. The\nlarger states of Chuuk and Pohnpei will require more business trainers and advisers, some of\nwhich may be on a part-time or request basis. Information technology will be enhanced through\n                  \n19 The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific provided assistance for the preparation of a revised\ncorporate plan in 2000.", "23\nan Internet-based business and technical information service that will link the four state SBDCs\nto DEA and appropriate information worldwide. This information system is expected to be simple\nbut consistent with the needs of businesses in the FSM. Information on labor demand and\nsupply will be included so that those seeking workers and those seeking employment will be\nserved by the information system. Consulting services will be provided for training business\ncenter  staff,  developing  the  labor  market  information  system,  establishing  the  required\nprocedures, and updating the necessary training materials. Supported by the new business and\nlabor market information system, the business adviser in each SBDC will identify new training\nneeds and provide advisory support for established and emerging businesses. New buildings for\nthe SBDCs in Chuuk, Kosrae, and Pohnpei will be constructed within the state campuses of the\nCollege of Micronesia (COM)-FSM. In each of these states, the facilities to be constructed will\nbe joint-use buildings, which will also accommodate the vocational training programs of COM.\nThe training and counseling facilities of the Yap Business Center will be upgraded. The center\ncurrently operates as an incubator system.\n83. To ensure access to the best possible advice and secure the input of the private sector,\nthe SBDC will be advised in each state by a business development council (BDC), which will\nhave representatives from the private sector, banks, COM, NGOs, and the state government,\nand will replace the current MEDC board. The SBDC\u2019s legal status will be converted to a state\nnonprofit corporation to improve transparency and performance of its business support services.\nThe  BDCs  will  be  managed  by  state  COM  campuses  (except  in  Yap).  The  national\nGovernment\u2019s current budget support will be maintained through the COM-FSM budget to the\nstate campuses, except in Yap where it will be channeled through the state government. This\nnew  structure  and  other  modifications  have  been  included  in  the  proposed  business\ndevelopment act for the states. Linkages between the SBDCs and FSMDB will be enhanced to\nensure  that  the  outreach  services  of  the  two  institutions,  including  staff  capabilities,  are\ncompatible and consistent. Annually, the BDC will review the delivery of SBDC services and\ndevelopment of private sector services to ensure that the centers are not providing competing\nservices or undermining the development of private sector business support services. In this\nregard, the SBDCs will be encouraged to provide training-of-trainers to existing nongovernment\nbusiness organizations, and introduce and increase user fees as appropriate.\n3.  Program and Project Management (Component C)\n84. A program-project implementation unit (PIU) will be established within DEA. Despite the\nfact that DEA has served as the implementing agency for various ADB project and program\nloans, its capacity for effective policy implementation and coordination requires strengthening.\nThis is considered necessary, as part of the restructuring and rebuilding of DEA\u2019s capacity for\nimplementation and service support to the FSM states under the ongoing public sector reform\nefforts. Equivalent procedures and capacity building will be needed at the state level. A project\norganization chart is attached as Appendix 4.\n85. For the first three years, an internationally recruited program-project manager (PPM) will\nbe responsible for the day-to-day implementation of the PSDP. A counterpart manager will be\ntrained to take over in year four. The involvement of the expatriate PPM (total duration of 24\nperson-months) will be gradually phased out over the three years. The PPM will be expected to\n(i) design disbursement, procurement, and recruitment procedures and guidelines under the\nPSDP; (ii) develop monitoring and evaluation systems; (iii) facilitate the national and state\nsteering committees in four states; (iv) help DEA and the steering committees publicize the\nimprovements and changes under the PSDP, and (v) train PIU counterpart staff and the state\ncounterpart staff from each agency assigned to manage program and project implementation.", "24\nThe PIU will interact with the state governors' offices, which will coordinate the program and\nproject activities and investments at the state level.\n4.  Fees for Services\n86. No  land  office  currently  charges  for  land  survey  services;  although  citizens  have\nindicated their willingness to pay to expedite the survey. Under the Project, the fee for service\nconcept for activities carried out by the land administration agencies will be introduced. These\nactivities include issuance of land titles, land transactions, and information requests associated\nwith leasing and mortgaging. The immediate goal of the fees will not be full cost recovery, but\nrather, establishing the fee for service principle. Nominal charges will be introduced during the\ncourse  of  component  implementation  for  certain  activities  associated  with  first  registration\nactivities, e.g., expedited registration, while full charges will be levied for secondary transactions\nin land rights, such as leases and the recording and registering of mortgages. Such subsidies\nare  justified  as  part  of  the  modernization  process.  Nonetheless  as  the  improved  land\nadministration systems become established, fee structures for land titling will be reviewed with a\nview to increasing cost recovery for the systems.\n87. The newly established SBDC will apply fee for service to training and advisory services.\nAs with the land administration services, the immediate goal of the fees will not be full cost\nrecovery, but rather establishing the fee for service principle. In addition to direct appropriations\nfrom government, various other grant sources from external financers may be explored to\nfinance the operation and investment requirements of the SBDCs.\n5.  Cost Estimates\n88. The total cost of the investment Project is estimated at $13.032 million equivalent,\nincluding  physical  and  price  contingencies,  taxes  and  duties,  and  interest  charges  during\nconstruction. Of the total costs, $6.699 million (51 percent) is the foreign exchange cost, and\n$6.333 million equivalent (49 percent) the local currency cost. A summary of cost estimates is\nshown in Table 1, and the detailed breakdown is given in Appendix 5.", "25\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ \u2018000)\nForeign Local\nProject Components Exchange Currency Total Cost Percent\nA.

The proposed policy reforms and investment Project will have significant social and, to a\nlesser extent, environmental impacts in the FSM. A description of these features follows.\n1.  Participatory Development and Improved Governance\n90. In the course of economic and legal reforms, the newly established national and state\neconomic policy implementation councils (EPICs) will help to maintain the reform momentum,\nbuild consensus, and monitor implementation. The newly established BDC in each state will\nserve to provide feedback from the informal and small business sectors to the government and\nto establish partnerships with the government.\n91. Amended  foreign  direct  investment  laws  and  newly  established  mortgage  and\nbankruptcy laws will improve transparency, fairness, and predictability in business regulation\nand protection of creditors and debtors. Converting the current MEDC from a Government unit\ninto  an  arms-length  SBDC  will  help  protect  business  secrets  of  start-up  businesses  and\nenhance the credibility of the SBDCs.\n2.  Women, Youth, and the Poor\n92. The ongoing business support program and the FSMDB small loan program show that\nequality in access is achievable. The specific needs of women, youth, and the poor will be", "26\nfurther addressed under the SBDC and FSMDB strengthening components through their small\nbusiness support program and outreach program. The outreach program will target locationally\ndisadvantaged outer islanders particularly in Chuuk and Yap. Specific output targets will be set\nup, aimed at women and monitored by the SBDC and FSMDB.\n93. The investment Project will focus on Chuuk, where half of the FSM population resides\nand where the poor constitute 53 percent of the state population. Pohnpei is actively addressing\nthe resettlement needs of squatters  found in Kolonia and in the uplands of the main island.\nMeasures include (i) provision of leasehold contracts for occupied lands that will be convertible\nto freehold sale contracts at the end of the lease term; and (ii) establishment of a state land-use\nplan that will, among other things, provide alternative land for resettlement. Acceleration of land\ntitling  under  the  investment  Project  will  contribute  to  preventing  further  squatting  and\nimplementing resettlement without significant economic and social costs. Furthermore, proactive\nland survey and titling in outer islands where demand is strong will prevent migration to the main\nislands  by  enabling  investment  in  housing  and  income-earning  sectors  such  as  fisheries,\nagriculture, and tourism. The construction of new buildings for state land administration offices\nand SBDCs will not result in significant land acquisition problems since all the identified land\nsites are currently owned by the state governments and COM state campuses.\n3.  Environment Interface\n94. The overall PSDP is classified in environmental category C. An environmental impact\nassessment matrix is attached as Appendix 6. Environmental implications were reviewed and\nno adverse impacts were identified, with specific project activities expected to safeguard the\nenvironment  as  development  proceeds.  The  land  administration  and  management\nsubcomponent will improve the environmental sustainability of land use by providing capacity\nbuilding in land management. Streamlining and improving the monitoring of land use laws and\nregulations, including geographic information systems, will assist islandwide land management.\nInitially this will be carried out in Pohnpei. Acceleration in land dispute settlement and titling is\nexpected to have a positive impact on the environment with clear property rights providing a\ngreater incentive for sustainable land parcel management over the long run.20\nV.  THE PROPOSED LOANS\n95. Implementation of the PSDP requires increased recurrent expenditures and additional\ninvestments to carry out the reforms, as well as to improve institutional infrastructure essential\nfor enabling private sector growth. The PSDP will be funded by proposed ADB loans equivalent\nto $13.017 million, including a policy-based loan ($5 million equivalent) and an investment loan\n($8.017 million equivalent) sourced from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The national and\nstate governments will finance sector investments amounting to $5.015 million. The financing\nplan for ADB assistance is given in tables 2 and 3, and details for the two loans follow. Details of\nfinancing arrangements are in Appendix 5.\n                  \n20 The Nature Conservancy, an NGO with operations in Pohnpei, is actively promoting community-based watershed\nmanagement, which includes the training of island communities in sustained economic use of lands owned or\ncontrolled by the communities. The watershed management program has identified the settlement of disputes and\ntitle issuance as essential for improved management.", "27\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nLoan ADB National States Total\nPolicy Loan     5.000     0.000    0.000      5.000\nInvestment Loan 8.017 1.388 3.627 13.032\nTotal   13.017 1.388 3.627 18.032\n        Source: Staff estimates.\nTable 3: PSDP Loans/Cost Allocation Among the National\nand State Governments\n($'000)\nLoan National Yap Chuuk Kosrae Pohnpei Total\nInvestment Loan 2,779 1,204 1,780 1,261       994 8,017\nPolicy Loan 1,000       800 1,300       800    1,100 5,000\nTotal PSDP Loans 3,779 2,004 3,080 2,061 2,094 13,017\nPSDP = private sector development program.\nSource: Staff estimates.\nA.  The Policy Loan\n1.  Amount of Loan, Terms, and Sources of Funds\n96. It is proposed that ADB provide a policy-based loan of $5.0 million equivalent to support\nthe  Government\u2019s  implementation  of  the  policy  and  legal  reforms  for  private  sector\ndevelopment. The total amount of the loan would be provided from ADB's Special Funds\nresources. This loan will have a maturity of 24 years, including an 8-year grace period, 1\npercent  interest  charge  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5    percent  per  annum\nthereafter, and equal amortization. The size of the loan is based on the scope and the costs of\nthe reforms, the importance of the reforms, and the state of public finances.\n2.  Implementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\n97. The Department of Finance and Administration (DOF) will be the Executing Agency,\nresponsible for initiating withdrawals under the loan, and for allocating and monitoring the use of\ncounterpart funds. DEA will be the Implementing Agency. A PIU will be established within DEA\nto support program management. State governors' offices will be the implementing agencies at\nthe state level. A steering committee, co-chaired by the Secretary of Finance and the Secretary\nof Economic Affairs, and to include the Governors of the states or their representatives and a\nrepresentative for each of the COM and FSMDB, shall be established to monitor and coordinate\nthe Program and the Project.\n3.  Procurement and Disbursement\n98. Procurement  of  eligible  items  under  ADB\u2019s  program  loan  will  be  based  on  normal\ncommercial  practices  for  procurement  by  the  private  sector  or  standard  Government\nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB for procurement by the public sector. In the case of\ngoods commonly traded on international commodity markets, procurement will be undertaken in\naccordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB. A list of ineligible", "28\nitems  is  attached  as  Appendix  7.  ADB  ensures  that  standard  private  and  public  sector\nprocurement procedures used in the FSM are adequate in terms of competition and efficiency.\n99. With each withdrawal request, the Borrower will be required to submit a certification\nconfirming compliance with the following formula: for each year in which the proceeds of the\nloan are expected to be disbursed, the annual withdrawal request is less than the value of the\ncountry\u2019s total imports minus (i) imports from nonmember countries, (ii) ineligible imports, and\n(iii) imports financed by other official development assistance. ADB will have the right to audit\nthe use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification.\n4.  Counterpart Funds\n100. The counterpart funds to be generated from the loan proceeds will be used by the\nnational and state governments to support implementation of the policy and legal reforms set\nout in the policy matrix (Appendix 3). The Government has agreed that counterpart funds\ngenerated by the transfer of loan funds from ADB will be deposited in the special account. The\naccount will be operated jointly by DEA and DOF, and the funds disbursed to state governments\nfor implementing reforms for private sector development. Appropriate arrangements will be\nmade between the national and state governments to ensure that counterpart funds allocated to\nthe states are disbursed upon compliance with the conditions specified for each state in the\npolicy matrix. Such counterpart funds will be transferred from the national Government to the\nstate governments, with terms and procedures to be agreed upon by the national and state\ngovernments.\n5.  Monitoring and Tranching\n101. The policy component will start in February 2002 and end in February 2005. The loan of\n$5 million will be released in two equal tranches. The first tranche will be made available upon\nloan effectiveness (expected about February 2002). The second tranche is expected to be\nreleased in August 2003 subject to the fulfillment by the governments of specific conditions for\nits release, as detailed in the development policy letter (Appendix 2), and the accompanying\npolicy  matrix  (Appendix  3),  including  satisfactory  progress  in  implementing  the  investment\nProject.\n102. The Government and ADB will review PSDP implementation on a continuing basis, a\njoint review conducted during the third quarter of 2003 prior to the release of the second\ntranche. To assist in ADB\u2019s review, the Government will provide relevant information through\nquarterly reports on the progress and impact of the policy reforms. The consultant engaged by\nDEA for the PIU will assist the Government in monitoring the policy component. The two\ntranches are expected to be released to the national Government in two steps, if necessary, the\nfirst release being made when the national Government and at least two of the states meet the\ntargets set out in the policy matrix. For the state(s) not meeting the targets, the corresponding\namount will be withheld by ADB. Subsequently, additional releases could be made as the\nconcerned state(s) achieve their targets, provided these are met by August 2002 and February\n2004. If a state fails to meet its targets, then these portions of the loan will be canceled. A joint\nfinal review will be conducted in the second quarter of 2005. The PIU will submit program\nprogress reports, including detailed quarterly reports and the program completion report, to ADB\nwithin three months after PSDP completion.\n103. The counterpart funds will be disbursed to each state and the national Government\nunder each tranche as shown in Table 4. The distribution reflects the current principle of the", "29\nrevenue sharing scheme between the national and state governments,21 the scope and cost of\nthe policy reforms, the importance of the reforms, and each government\u2019s financial capacity to\nsustain an improved level of private sector support services.\nTable 4: Program Loan Tranching and Allocation of Counterpart Funds\n($ \u2019000)\n Government 1st Tranche 2nd Tranche Total\nChuuk 650 650       1,300\nKosrae 400 400 800\nPohnpei 550 550       1,100\nYap 400 400 800\nNational 500 500       1,000\n   Total       2,500       2,500       5,000\n  Source: Staff estimates.\nB.  The Investment Loan\n1.  Loan Amount , Terms, and Sources of Funds\n104. The sector investments are estimated to cost $13.032 million equivalent. It is proposed\nthat ADB provide a loan of $8.017 million equivalent to finance 62 percent of the total cost of the\ninvestment Project from its Special Funds resources. The loan will finance the entire foreign\nexchange cost of $6.699 million, including interest charges, and $1.318 million equivalent of the\nlocal currency cost equivalent. ADB financing of local currency cost includes primarily civil works\nfor  state  land  offices  and  BDCs,  and  staff  development  activities.  The  national  and  state\ngovernments will finance the remaining cost of $5.015 million equivalent (38 percent of the total\ncost).\n105. The investment loan will have a maturity of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years,\nan interest charge of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5  percent per annum\nthereafter on the disbursed and outstanding amounts, and equal amortization. The Government\nwill make the proceeds of the ADB loan available along with local funds to DEA and state\ngovernment agencies through its regular budgetary allocations. The financing arrangements are\nsummarized in tables 5, 6, and 7, and the details in Appendix 5.\nTable 5: Investment Loan/Cost Allocation\n Among the National and State Governments\n($'000)\nCost National Yap Chuuk Kosrae Pohnpei Total\nInvestment Costs 2,779 1,204 1,780 1,261 994 8,017\nCounterpart Costs 1,388 859 1,087 918 763 5,015\n   Total 4,167 2,063 2,866 2,179 1,757 13,032\nSource: Staff estimates.\n                  \n21 The current government revenue sharing scheme (except fisheries fees) is 30:70 between the national and state\ngovernments.", "30\nTable 6: Investment Loan/Average Annual Government Contribution\n(Recurrent and Incremental Costs)\n($'000)\nNational Yap Chuuk Kosrae Pohnpei Total\nAverage Annual\nGovernment\nContribution 347 215 272 230 191 1,255\nSource: Staff estimates.\nTable 7: Investment Loan/Incremental Costsa(Without Contingencies)\n($'000)\nCost National Kosrae Pohnpei Chuuk Yap Total\nBy State\nTotal (4 years) 960.00 399.15 266.73 417.93 417.18 2,461.00\nAve. Annual\nIncremental Budget 240.00 99.79 66.68 104.48 104.30 615.25\n2002 2003 2004 2005 Total\nBy Year\nTotal 452.95 669.35 669.35 669.35 2,461.00\naTotals may appear not to add up due to rounding.\n Source: Staff estimates.\n2.  Implementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\n106. DOF will be the Executing Agency, responsible for initiating withdrawals under the loan,\nand for allocating and monitoring the use of loan proceeds. DEA will be the Implementing\nAgency. A PIU will be established within DEA to support project implementation and ensure that\nall procurement activities are in accordance with ADB's guidelines. State governor\u2019s offices are\nthe Implementing Agencies at the state level. A steering committee, co-chaired by the Secretary\nof Finance and the Secretary of Economic Affairs, and to include the Governors of the states or\ntheir  representatives  and  a  representative  for  each  of  the  COM  and  FSMDB,  shall  be\nestablished  to  monitor  and  coordinate  the  Program  and  the  Project.  A  state  coordinating\ncommittee shall be established at the state level and shall be chaired by the Governor of the\nrelevant state and shall also include other members as determined by each Governor. The state\ncoordinating committee shall monitor and coordinate the Project at the state level.\n107. Capacity building of DEA and the role of the PPM are described in paras. 84 and 85.\n108. The PPM must have extensive experience in the delivery of public services to the private\nsector. The services will be required for 24 months over the program-project implementation\nfollowing  loan  effectiveness.  Specific  activities  will  include  (i)  design  disbursement,\nprocurement,  and  recruitment  procedures  and  guidelines  under  the  PSDP,  and  undertake\nprocurement initiatives; (ii) prepare state proposal design and procurement guidelines for the\ninvestment project component; (iii) prepare guidelines and support DEA in recruiting consultants\nusing the loan proceeds; (iv) design and activate a national and state implementation and\nperformance monitoring and evaluation system including related training of DEA and state\ncounterpart staff; (v) facilitate the establishment and start-up of national and state steering\ncommittees, specifically the BDCs or their equivalent; (vi) assist DEA and national and state\nsteering committees in disseminating information on the improvements and changes under the", "31\nPSDP;  (vii)  train  DEA  counterpart  staff  and  the  state  counterpart  staff  from  each  agency\nassigned to manage project implementation; and (viii) support the secretary of economic affairs\nin providing overall direction to consulting services delivered through the investment component.\n3.  Procurement and Consulting Services\n109. Contracts for equipment and supplies estimated to exceed $500,000 and contracts for\ncivil works estimated to exceed $1.0 million will be awarded on the basis of international\ncompetitive bidding as detailed in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts of lower value\nwill be procured on the basis of local competitive bidding, international shopping, or direct\npurchase as per ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works contracts valued at or below\n$1.0 million will be awarded to prequalified contractors in accordance with local competitive\nbidding procedures acceptable to ADB. lndicative contract packages are attached as Appendix\n8.\n110. Under the Project, 275.5 person-months of international consulting services in the areas\nof land administration and management, development banking, business development, and\nproject  administration  will  be  required.  The  international  consultants  will  be  engaged  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and the domestic consultants will\nbe selected in accordance with arrangements acceptable to ADB. Clear indicators for expected\noutputs in skills transfer will be set up. Consultants will be selected not only for their technical\nqualifications, but also for their ability to guide, coach, and mentor local counterparts. Terms of\nreference of consulting services are shown in Appendix 9.\n4.  Disbursement and Imprest Account\n111. To manage disbursements of loan proceeds, an imprest account will be established by\nthe Government in the Bank of the FSM. The initial amount in the imprest account is not\nexpected to exceed $100,000. The imprest account will be established, managed, replenished,\nand liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook dated January 2001,\nand detailed arrangements agreed upon by ADB and the Government. The imprest account will\nbe operated jointly by the PIU in DEA and DOF.\n112. The statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures will be used for reimbursing eligible\nexpenditures under the loan, and for liquidating advances to the imprest account in accordance\nwith procedures acceptable to ADB and consistent with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.\nAny individual payment or contract to be reimbursed or liquidated under the SOE procedure will\nnot exceed the equivalent of $50,000.\n5.  Advance Action\n113. To expedite Project implementation, ADB has approved advance procurement action to\nestablish the PIU, engage the PPM, and select and recruit consultants. The Government has\nbeen advised that ADB\u2019s approval of such advance actions will not commit ADB to approve the\nPDSP subsequently, and no contract can be awarded prior to loan approval.\n6.  Accounts, Auditing, and Reports\n114. The Government will maintain records and accounts adequate to identify goods and\nservices financed from the loan proceeds. The PIU (DEA) and DOF will (i) maintain separate\naccounts for the Project; (ii) ensure that the accounts and related financial statements are", "32\naudited annually in accordance with sound auditing principles by auditors acceptable to ADB;\nand (iii) submit to ADB, not later than nine months after the close of each fiscal year, certified\ncopies of the audited accounts and the report of the auditor. If necessary, funding will be\nprovided under the loan for auditing project accounts and related financial statements. These\nfunds may be used to outsource auditing services. The PIU will submit project progress reports\nto  ADB  including  detailed  quarterly  reports  and  the  project  completion  report  within  three\nmonths after completion of the Project. The annual audit will include the audit of the imprest\naccount and SOE, and a separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account and SOE.\n7.  Project Implementation Period and Midterm Review\n115. The Project will be implemented over four years from about February 2002 to February\n2006. A review of all aspects of the Project will be carried out by the Government and ADB\nduring the third quarter of 2004. The project midterm review will (i) examine the scope, design,\nimplementation arrangements, and other relevant issues in the light of implementation of the\npolicy component; (ii) evaluate progress toward achieving the measurable project targets and\ntheir impacts on private sector development; (iii) identify changes since the time of appraisal\nrelating to sector issues, resource management, and allocations; and reassess their impact on\nproject  sustainability;  (iv)  evaluate  implementation  performance  against  the  established\nschedule; (v) verify the compliance with loan covenants; (vi) identify problems and constraints;\nand  (vii)  formulate  appropriate  recommendations  for  corrective  actions.  The  project\nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 10.\n8.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation\n116. Outline performance indicators have been identified based on the outputs cited in the\nbudget documents22 and in accordance with the existing capacity of the concerned agencies\n(Appendix 11). Beneficiaries highlighted the critical importance of performance measurement. A\nspecific target level is associated with each indicator. Baseline values for some indicators on\nwhich information is available are shown for FY2000. Performance indicators and their interim\nand final target values will be refined by the PIU. Additional indicators will be added at the PSDP\nobjective and goal level in accordance with the program framework. Wherever possible, data\nwill be desegregated by gender, age, and income group. The poverty assessment under an\nADB TA for strengthening national statistical capacity and the results of the US-funded FSM\n2000 household and population census will provide necessary primary data.\n117. The PIU will establish a performance monitoring and evaluation system detailing the\nqualitative and quantitative output indicators in the Program Framework (Appendix 1) and the\noutline performance indicators within three months of loan effectiveness. These will also be\nused  to  monitor  program  and  project  inputs  and  activities,  and  will  be  related  to  the\ncorresponding impact monitoring. The PPM will undertake this task during the first quarter of\nimplementation,  and  will  report  on  actual  performance  through  the  progress  reports.  The\nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  will  be  designed  in  line  with  the  budget\npreparation of the concerned government agencies.\n                  \n22 The newly introduced output-based budget system is yet to be fully operationalized throughout the national and\nstate agencies. A follow-on ADB TA for strengthening the output-based budget system will commence in late 2001.", "33\nVI.  BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA.  Expected Impacts\n1.  Economic\n118. The expected economic impacts on the FSM are identifiable at two levels: the effects of\nthe policy loan and the effects of the investment loan. The policy loan aims to develop an\neconomic environment conducive to private sector activity and investment by maintaining the\ncommitment to reforming the public sector and promoting the private sector. Maintenance of\nfinancial stability through balanced budgets, the FSM Trust Fund, and sound management of\nexternal debt will ensure the macroeconomic stability necessary to create confidence among\nforeign and domestic investors. Maintenance of government payroll levels will contribute to\nkeeping the budget balanced as well as reducing the differential between government and\nprivate wage levels. Public enterprise reform will reduce the budgetary burden on the public\nsector, improve resource allocation to social and physical infrastructure, and reduce competition\nwith the private sector, enabling the latter to grow more strongly.\n119. The PSDP will develop priority areas of the legal and regulatory framework within which\nimproved  and  lower  cost,  market-based  transactions  can  increase  the  competitiveness  of\nresources. Specifically, improved mortgage laws that allow foreign commercial banks to use\nleasehold mortgage procedures are expected to increase access to capital; extended lease\nterms are expected to increase the attractiveness of the FSM to long-term investors interested\nin bringing capital and know-how. Streamlined foreign investment laws and regulations are\nexpected  to  decrease  transaction  costs  by  increasing  transparency  and  eliminating\ndiscretionary, and sometimes costly, reviews of applications.\n120. The increasing demand for land survey and registration is being driven by a gradual\nincrease in public awareness of the role of land ownership rights for increasing access to\nfinancing through commercial loans, and by the need for improved security of lessee rights to\nencourage  domestic  and  foreign  investors.  This  demand  is  expected  to  grow  as  public\nunderstanding  of  the  value  of  clear  land  title  grows.  The  investment  in  improved  land\nmanagement and administration capacity is expected to reduce the costs of surveying and\nmapping per parcel, and accelerate land surveying and mapping. Currently the cost of surveying\nand mapping a parcel of land is estimated at approximately $550. The new equipment and\ntechniques  will  potentially  reduce  costs  of  surveying  and  mapping  to  $30  per  parcel  and\neliminate the problem of backlog accumulation. Experience in Pohnpei with improved survey\nand mapping technology has shown estimated productivity increases of 200 percent for surveys\nand 300 percent for map production, with possible further gains through technical training.\nAccelerated23 land surveying and titling are expected to increase land transactions including\nleasing, sales, and use of land to secure lending. Improved registration systems are expected to\nreduce  the  time  wasted  and  costs  suffered  under  the  current  procedures.  Improved  land\nvaluation  is  expected  to  result  in  a  more  competitive  and  efficient  land  market,  allowing\ntransactions to occur at market prices known to both the buyers and sellers of land rights.\nIncreased  user  right  security,  especially  for  lessors,  is  expected  to  facilitate  increased\ninvestment.\n                  \n23 Productivity gains of this magnitude will allow Pohnpei State to clear the current backlog of 1,600 parcels in 2 to 3\nyears compared with at least 6 years with the technology used in other FSM states.", "34\n121. The  demand  for  commercial  finance,  especially  in  the  start-up  and  small  business\nsector, is evidenced by the growth in commercial lending in the past 10 years24 and the high\nnumber of commercial loan applications compared with approvals. The lack of response by\ncommercial banks is due to high perceived risks, lack of collateral, and the administration costs\nof lending to the start-up and small business sector, while inefficiencies in direct government\nloan schemes have resulted in poor performance of these schemes. FSMDB was identified as\nthe institution most suited to expanding development finance, including longer-term loans at\ninterest rates lower than the commercial banks. The bank is the main source of financing for the\nagriculture, fisheries, manufacturing, and tourism sectors. Institutional strengthening under the\nProject will also help FSMDB fulfill its role of higher risk lending to start-ups and small business.\nThe expected benefit is increased access to capital for commercial purposes by informal and\nsmall business. The secured transactions legislation and registry system is expected to increase\naccess to commercial finance through chattel mortgaging, which will provide wider access to\ncapital,  especially  for  borrowers  who  do  not  have  titled  land  or  whose  loan  amounts  are\nrelatively  small.25  Although  the  value  of  capital  that  could  be  generated  by  the  system  is\nuncertain  at  this  stage,  the  investment  costs  for  passing  a  secured  transactions  law  and\nestablishing and operating a secured transactions systems are minimal.\n122. Demand for small business support services has been demonstrated through the MEDC\nprogram and the high level of participation in MEDC training and services in the areas of\nentrepreneurship,  business  proposal  preparation,  and  aspects  of  business  management.26\nUnmet service demand exists in post-start-up advisory services, business information services,\nservices for informal business, and locationally disadvantaged groups. The relocation of the\npresent business centers to state COM campuses (Yap excepted) is expected to improve\nefficiency, allow access to additional and better qualified staff and other resources, and allow\nthe  development  of  a  more  effective  outreach  program  to  reach  the  locationally  and\neconomically disadvantaged.\n123. Given the limited growth prospects for the nontraded sectors such as the wholesale and\nretail trade, future private sector growth in the FSM is expected to be mainly in the tradable\nsectors including fisheries, tourism, agriculture, and light manufacturing. Expansion into the\ntraded sectors is expected to be driven by foreign direct investment and informal and formal\nSMEs.  The  extent  to  which  the  PSDP  facilitates  increased  private  sector  activity  will  be\nmeasured by the increase in business licenses, company registration, and foreign investment\napplications. The with and without effects of proposed policy and legal actions and project\ncomponents are provided in Appendix 12.\n2.  Poverty and Social Impact\n124. The PSDP will contribute to ongoing changes and evolution in traditional systems in the\nFSM society and economy, the most important of which are the changes from a subsistence\n                  \n24 Since 1990 total loans of the commercial banking sector have increased from a level of $29 million to $50 million by\nthe end of the third quarter in 1999.\n25 The demand identified for very small business loans is generally not handled by any of the formal banks. This\ndemand was found among low income and disadvantaged groups including outer islanders and groups living\noutside the state urban centers.\n26 Of the 237 businesses interviewed during the project preparatory TA, about 50 percent of the enterprises have\nparticipated in training programs. Entrepreneurship or management training and accounting/bookkeeping are the\ntraining most demanded; 95 percent of the respondents feel that the training has benefited their enterprises, mainly\nthrough an improvement in their business and upgrading of employee skills. Eighty-five percent of respondents felt\nthey needed training, by order of preference, in: business skills (such as in marketing, customer service, etc.),\nentrepreneurship and management, accounting/bookkeeping, and technical skills.", "35\neconomy  to  a  market  economy,  community  ownership  of  land  to  individual  ownership,\nmembership in extended lineages and clans to the nuclear family, and greater individualism in\nsocial life and economic activity. The evolution of land tenure and rights has proved especially\ndifficult for the FSM. The major social issues surrounding land include land disputes within\nclans,  the  increasing  inability  of  traditional  leaders  to  settle  disputes;  exploitation  due  to\nignorance  surrounding  land  values;  the  protection  of  lessee  and  lessor  rights;  and  the\ndisincentive to investors owing to lack of clarity of title and rights. These ongoing changes have\ncarried social costs, but as evidenced by the changes over the past 20 years, this is a choice\nthat Micronesian society has made for the sake of adopting a more modern lifestyle, self-\nsustaining economic growth, and better social services. The extent to which the FSM\u2019s different\nethnic groups have adopted these changes while maintaining traditions varies considerably, as\ndoes  the  extent  to  which  the  changes  have  caused  social  problems.  By  providing  better-\ntargeted services to members of FSM society who have been bypassed by recent economic\nchange, more equitable opportunities for economic and consequently social improvement will\nlikely be provided.\n125. The poverty impact of the PSDP on disadvantaged and low income groups will be\npositive  overall,  both  directly  and  indirectly,  as  detailed  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.\nEssentially, the various components of policy and project loans will act through the following\nthree  channels:  (i)  promote  overall  growth  through  private  sector  development  leading  to\nincreased employment and income; (ii) channel a large share of the project benefits to the main\nlow  income  and  poverty  groups  to  ensure  that  they  can  use  the  enhanced  services  and\ncontribute to and benefit from economic growth; and (iii) assist the government to increase the\nfocus  of  public  expenditure  on  social  services  by  promoting  non-public-sector  dependent,\nprivate-sector driven economic growth.\n126. The investment Project\u2019s allocations support all states, but given that more than half of\nChuuk\u2019s population is poor, it will benefit from a proportionately higher portion of services to be\ndeveloped under the Project, as will the poor in other states. The business development and\nFSMDB components will emphasize reaching the disadvantaged and low-income groups: the\nouter islanders and dislocated migrants now living in the district centers. The latter group, for\nexample,  are  suited  to  being  assisted  with  non-land-based  activities,  such  as  local  food\nprocessing for which domestic and regional export market demand is increasing (e.g., Guam).\nProactive land survey and titling in the outer islands, where the demand is strong, will also\nprevent migration to the main islands by enabling investments in housing and income-earning\nsectors such as fisheries, agriculture, and tourism in the outer islands.\n127. While women have traditionally deferred to men in FSM society, they are steadily closing\nthe gender gap in terms of educational attainment and participation in the nonsubsistence labor\nforce (in which their share has grown to a third, almost doubling in the last three decades). By\nseeking to involve women in small businesses, the Project builds on their traditional productive\nrole  as  weavers  and  makers  of  community  valuables.  It  also  seeks  to  revitalize  informal\ncommunity women's organizations for delivery of credit, training, and marketing. The increase in\nthe number of land titles, including those held by women, will make it easier for women to\naccess the banks directly, instead of relying on male relatives.\n128. Young males are disentangling themselves from traditional household obligations faster\nthan their sisters, who still have a secure place in the family.27 By extending the Project\u2019s\n                  \n27 The suicide rate for the general population is among the highest in the world, and in some islands exceeds 200 per\n100,000 for males aged 15-24. The spread of the market economy, which allows independent access to cash-", "36\nbusiness development activities to school dropouts and other youth-at-risk, and thereby giving\nthem an alternative focus in life, the Project will help to address the considerable issue of\nunemployed and out-of-school youth in the FSM.\nB.  Risks and Safeguards\n1.  Weak Political Will for Reforms\n129. The  Government\u2019s  political  commitment  could  weaken,  resulting  in  delay  in\nimplementing the reform measures. The complex political structure may also result in uneven\nperformance in policy reform and project implementation among the four states. A national and\nstate jurisdictional issue over the secured transaction law may lead to varying  content and\nimplementation, and even disagreement on legal changes.\n130. Government  commitment  is  reflected  in  the  results  of  the  Second  FSM  Economic\nSummit; EPIC will oversee key issues of economic reform. The policy actions and the time\nframe in the policy matrix reflect each state's financial and legal situation, and local acceptance\nand capacity for implementing reforms. Tranching strategy of the policy loan is designed to\nprevent delay of loan release at the expense of the states that are able to meet the conditions.\nAll  areas  of  proposed  legislative  and  regulatory  change  have  been  raised  recently  in\ngovernment or state legislatures, and attempts have already been made to draft bills. The\nproposed national secured transaction law under ADB (footnote 18) TA presented an approach\nto resolve the jurisdictional issue satisfactorily for both the national and state governments. The\nstates, while protecting their jurisdictions, have also shown a willingness to consider changes\nthat have proved to be successful in other states.\n2.  Effectiveness of Public Administration and Judiciary\n131. Institutional capacities of and coordination between various government agencies are\ngenerally weak. FSMDB and the SBDCs have limited capacity for outreach to large numbers of\ninexperienced potential business people. Institutional capacity to enforce legislation through the\ncourts is insufficient. If a mechanism for accelerating the settlement of land disputes is not\nrealized,  this  will  diminish  the  potential  benefits  from  improved  surveying  and  mapping\ntechnology. Moreover, an attempt to accelerate surveying and mapping without an effective\ndispute settlement mechanism may accentuate disputes.\n132. DEA and the state governments have implemented the ADB-funded PSRP since 1997,\nand will be strengthened through on-the-job training for three years by an international PPM.\nCareful  planning  and  monitoring  will  enable  DEA  to  implement  the  investment  Project\neffectively. In particular, advance procurement action and retroactive financing will be available\nfor selecting and recruiting consultants, establishing the PIU, and engaging the PPM in order to\nensure timely implementation. The need for judiciary training and court management is well\nrecognized and the Government is expected to address this need in the short- and medium-\nterm through ADB and other external assistance. In the states where land dispute settlement is\na prominent issue, consulting services for establishing an effective settlement mechanism will\nbe provided prior to physical investments.\n   \nincomes, has led to a weakening of  the traditional father-son relationship. Most suicides have to do with anger and\ndeep disappointment at the rupture of a close relationship with a respected family elder such as the father or\nbrother. The ratio of male to female suicides is reported to be 14:1.", "37\n3.  Weak Response from the Private Sector\n133. Increased lending and business support to small business may not increase the number\nand performance of new and existing businesses due to a lack of viable business opportunities\nand ineffective training and business advisory support. Strengthened legal systems may not\nresult in increased foreign investments and increased leasehold and mortgage transactions.\nSmall businesses may not perform sufficiently to repay loans and minimize defaults.\n134. State BDCs will oversee the performance of the SBDCs; and facilitate their interaction\nwith NGOs, FSMDB, and the Government to provide integrated business support services. The\nlabor market information system to be operated by the SBDCs will help increase awareness of\njob opportunities. Recent FSMDB data show that small loans under $1,000 do not experience\nloan recovery problems. Improved skills and management in examining loan proposals will\nprevent a deterioration of FSMDB's loan recovery rate.\n4.  Affordability and Sustainability\n135. With  the  impending  review  of  Compact  funding,  the  possible  reduction  of  external\ntransfers may prevent the Government from mobilizing the increased expenditures anticipated.\nIncremental recurrent costs may not be financed sufficiently and on a timely basis by the\nnational and state governments.\n136. Sound fiscal management and external debt management will enable the Government to\nmake available the required resources to sustain the improved level of public services beyond\nthe project implementation period. In particular, the FSM Trust Fund, if fully operationalized, will\ngenerate additional revenues for the governments to support the increased recurrent costs.\nVII.  ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n137. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  The Government will (a) maintain the policies adopted and actions taken prior to\nthe  date  of  the  Loan  Agreement  for  the  policy  loan,  as  described  in  the\ndevelopment policy letter (Appendix 2) and the policy matrix (Appendix 3), for the\nduration of the PSDP policy loan period; and subsequently, (b) promptly adopt\nthe other policies and take the other actions included in the PSDP as specified in\nthe development policy letter and the policy matrix (including the conditions for\nrelease of the second tranche as described in the policy matrix); and (c) ensure\nthat such policies and actions continue in effect for the duration of the policy loan\nperiod.\n(ii)  The Government will ensure FSMDB implements a new corporate plan focusing\non business promotion, customer service, financial sustainability, and human\nresources development. FSMDB will develop the existing system of management\nby  objectives  with  each  state  branch  setting  lending,  collection,  and  profit\nobjectives.", "38\n(iii)  In each state, the SBDC will be advised by a BDC that will have representatives\nfrom the private sector, banks, COM, NGOs, and the state government. The BDC\nwill replace the current Micronesian Entrepreneur Development Center Board.\nThe  Government  will  aim  at  having  the  SBDCs  become  self-sustaining\norganizations by causing them to charge fees for their training and advisory\nservices, as appropriate, and to receive funds from other external sources.\n(iv)  The Government will introduce nominal charge for certain activities associated\nwith first registration activities while full charges shall be levied for secondary\ntransactions in land rights, such as leases and the recording and registering of\nmortgages.  As  the  land  administration  systems  become  established,  fee\nstructures for land titling shall be reviewed with a view to increasing cost recovery\nfor the systems.\nB.  Conditions for Loans Effectiveness\n138. Common Condition for the Policy and Investment Loans. At least two states will\neach have executed and delivered its relending agreement to the Borrower, and such relending\nagreement, in form and substance acceptable to ADB, will have been duly authorized or ratified\nby all necessary government action at the state and national level; and all conditions precedent\nto  the  effectiveness  of  the  relending  agreements  (other  than  a  condition  requiring  the\neffectiveness of the Loan Agreements) will have been fulfilled.\n139. Policy  Loan  Effectiveness.  All  conditions  precedent  to  the  effectiveness  of  the\ninvestment Loan Agreement (other than a condition requiring the effectiveness of the policy\nLoan Agreement) are fulfilled.\n140. Investment Loan Effectiveness. Effectiveness will be subject to the satisfaction of the\nfollowing special conditions:\n(i)  All conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the policy Loan Agreement (other\nthan a condition requiring the effectiveness of the investment Loan Agreement)\nare fulfilled.\n(ii)  A  PIU  is  established  within  DEA,  with  a  PPM  and  local  counterpart  staff,\nsatisfactory to ADB.\nC.  Conditions for Disbursement of the Investment Loan\n141. For disbursement of certain components of the investment loan, the following conditions\nwill be met:\n(i)  The new FSMDB corporate plan will be put into effect.\n(ii)  The business development act will be enacted in Chuuk, Kosrae, and Yap; and\nthe current Pohnpei business development act will be amended.\n(iii) Land  sites  will  be  made  available  for  construction  of  new  buildings  of  land\nadministration  (Chuuk,  Kosrae,  and  Yap)  and  SBDCs  (Chuuk,  Kosrae,  and\nPohnpei).", "39\nVIII.

However, a considerable reform agenda remains. Substantial cuts\nin the size and cost of government have been achieved but structural change toward greater private\nsector employment and development is slow to occur due to fundamental constraints in the FSM\u2019s\neconomic  resources  and  markets,  support  services  and  legal  environment.  The  Private  Sector\nDevelopment Program (PSDP), as an important element of our broader reform program, is designed to\nhelp  the  FSM  establish  an  open  and  competitive  economy  that  is  conducive  to  private  sector\ndevelopment  by  promoting  a  favorable  macroeconomic  and  legal  environment  for  investment,  and\nincreasing the mobilization, productivity and competitiveness of FSM\u2019s land, labor and capital resources.\nThe broad economic policy framework that guides the Government\u2019s overall economic reform efforts was\ndeveloped at the Second FSM Economic Summit in September 1999. Subsequent to that, ADB has\ncontributed  significantly  to  the  development  of  the  PSDP  that  will  enable  the  National  and  State\nGovernments of the FSM to implement a broad range of macroeconomic and microeconomic reforms\nconsistent with the results of that Summit. The PSDP, to be jointly funded with Bank support, represents a\ntimely and necessary combination of two components: first, a policy reform component, and second a\nsector development project that will focus financial and technical resources to implement reforms and\nsupport institutional strengthening.\nSince developing the broad outlines of the PSDP towards the end of 1999, the FSM National and State\nGovernments  were  thoroughly  engaged  in  the  program  design  work  of  the  PSDP  with  the  PPTA\nconsulting team, and worked closely with Bank staff. The major elements of the PSDP were presented for\ndeliberation at the FSM Economic Policy Implementation Council and the policy leaders of the nation\ndemonstrated  their  support  for  the  PSDP  through  unanimous  support  of  those  present  for  EPIC\nResolution 2000-1-01. We anticipate approval of the National-State Financial Agreements immediately\nfollowing authorization of the PSDP loan  by the Congress of the FSM in the session that commences in\nOctober 2001.\nObjectives and Scope of the Private Sector Development Program\nThe  Government,  with  advice  from  the  ADB-supported  PSDP  PPTA  Consulting  Team  and  with\nbackground  advisory  support  of  the  Economic  Management  Policy  Advisory  Team  (EMPAT),  has\ndeveloped an action-oriented, time bound approach to the implementation of those elements of the\nnation\u2019s  overall  economic  reform  program  related  to  accelerating  private  sector  development.  This\nprogram is already underway and the policy reforms required are, in many cases, being implemented or\nconsidered on a timely basis; however, a range of activities await implementation of the ADB-supported\nPSDP.", "46\nAppendix 2, page 2\nThe overall objective of the PSDP is to establish an economic and legal environment conducive to\ncompetitive, private sector-led economic growth. Specific objectives are to:\n(cid:1)  consolidate public sector and economic reform policies that support private sector development;\n(cid:1)  improve the legal and regulatory environment that influences access to and mobilization of economic\nresources by the private sector;\n(cid:1)  increase access to and security of land for economic use;\n(cid:1)  increase access to finance needed for business start-up and expansion of small and medium sized\nenterprises (SMEs);\n(cid:1)  improve business and entrepreneurial skills in small and medium size enterprises and in the informal\nsector;\n(cid:1)  strengthen the institutional capacity in the Department of Economic Affairs to implement the PSDP.\nThe Policy Component\nThe policy component includes the consolidation of economic reform policies, passage of legal provisions\nthat favor private sector development, and assurance of future funding for accomplishing required reform\nmeasures to promote private sector development.\nFirst Tranche Policy Actions\nUnder the broad objective of maintaining economic and public sector reforms, actions will be taken in five\nareas before the release of the first tranche under the program loan:\n1.  Each of the five governments is committed to have a balanced budget for fiscal year 2002.\n2.  Each government is committed to a wage bill target for fiscal year 2002 which shall not exceed the\nfollowing amounts:\na.  National: $ 8.41 million\nb.  Chuuk: $15.94 million\nc.  Kosrae: $ 5.80 million\nd.  Pohnpei: $12.90 million\ne.  Yap: $ 4.51 million\n3.  The FSM National Government, on behalf of all five governments, will ensure that the FSM Trust\nFund law is passed and the Board established.\n4.  The FSM National Government, in coordination with the State Governments, is committed to ensure\nthat total FSM official external debt, net of assets held for loan repayment, does not exceed 24\npercent of GDP in fiscal year 2002.\n5.  Each of the five governments has committed that Public Enterprise Reform Draft Master Plans are\ncompleted. At a minimum this will result in the transformation of five public enterprises and, more\noptimistically,  will  result  in  appropriate  and  efficient  transformation  of  all  of  the  FSM\u2019s  public\nenterprises by the end of the program period.\nUnder the broad objective of improving the legal environment for private sector development actions will\nbe taken in two additional areas before the release of the first tranche:\n6.  Each of the five governments has committed to draft legislation to improve the legal environment for\nlong(er) term leasing of land and for encouraging mortgage-secured commercial lending.", "47\nAppendix 2, page 3\nSecond Tranche Policy Actions\nActions will also be taken before the release of the second tranche under the program loan:\n1.  The budgets of the five governments will be balanced in fiscal years 2003 and 2004.\n2.  The increase of the wage bill targets referred to above for each government will not exceed 1.5\npercent in fiscal year 2003 and a further 1.5 percent in fiscal year 2004.\n3.  In the event of a two year extension of the economic provisions under the FSM Compact of Free\nAssociation with the United States, at least 50 percent of the increase of budgetary support under the\nCompact base grant for fiscal year 2002 and 2003 will be placed into the FSM Trust Fund referred to\nabove. The FSM Trust Fund will be fully operational.\n4.  The FSM official external debt, net of assets held for loan repayment, will not exceed 24 percent of\nGDP in fiscal years 2003 and 2004.\n5.  At least one public enterprise will be transformed by each of the five governments.\nThe following legislative actions will be taken before the release of the second tranche:\n6.  The long term leasing of land and the mortgage-secured commercial lending draft legislation referred\nto above will be enacted in each State.\n7.  The  foreign  investment  draft  amendments  referred  to  above  will  be  enacted  by  the  National\nGovernment and each State and regulations will be promulgated.\nThe Investment Project Component\nThe investment project is designed to improve the performance of the public sector in efforts to promote\nprivate sector development.  The investment project includes three components:\n1.  Establishment of a nationwide secured transactions system: this will involve the passage of an\numbrella national law, as well as, perhaps, State laws consistent with the commitment to promote\nchattel mortgage secured commercial lending. All five governments are committed to establishing a\nunified and comprehensive FSM Registry. A separate commitment has been made by the five\nGovernments to participate in a Bank-supported consultancy to identify, and subsequently enact\nbalanced and appropriate bankruptcy laws.\n2.  Strengthening of Institutional Capacity to Support Private Sector Development: this component\nwill entail capital investments and consulting services in the following three areas.\na.  Land Administration and Management: the four State governments have committed to a\nprogram  of  advisory  support,  training,  and  capital  investment  to:  (i)  promote  the\nmodernization and development of land registration systems, (ii) expedite the issuance of\nland titles, (iii) develop appropriate institutions and procedures for dispute resolution, (iv)\ndevelop appropriate systems for zoning and land use management, and (v) develop capacity\nfor land valuation.\nb.  Financial Services to the Private Sector: the legal and regulatory reforms outlined above\nwill address the needs of the commercial banking sector to increase commercial lending;\nhowever, the FSM Development Bank (FSMDB) has further committed to a program of\ninstitutional strengthening to enhance its ability to focus effectively on small and medium-size\nbusiness  promotion  and  customer  service.  The  FSMDB  has  committed  to  updating  its\nCorporate  Plan  accordingly  and  to  implement  a  long-term,  integrated  capacity  building\nprogram to improve its human resource skills base and to improve its long-term financial\nviability.", "48\nAppendix 2, page 4\nc.  Small  Business  Development  Services:  the  National  Government  and  four  State\ngovernments have committed to supporting the extension, expansion and re-formulation of\nthe activities formerly provided under the Micronesian Entrepreneurial Development (MEDC)\nprogram.  The  strengthened  program  will  be  renamed  as  Small  Business  Development\nCenters (SBDC) and will also incorporate a labor market information system.\n3.  Program and Project Implementation: the National Government has committed to establish a\nProject  Implementation  Unit  (PIU)  within  the  implementing  agency.  The  FSM  Department  of\nEconomic Affairs will be strengthened in its ongoing role as a conduit for significant donor assistance\nactivities in support of sectoral development and economic management.\nCONCLUSION\nFinancial  and  technical  support  from  ADB  in  conjunction  with  determined  efforts  and  sustained\ncommitment on the part of the five Governments in the FSM will ensure progress toward our stated goals.\nThe National Government is committed to fully implement the comprehensive policy actions as delineated\nin the attached policy matrix. Many of these steps have already been taken and the timetable expressed\nin the Policy Matrix represents a firm commitment to achieve the remaining actions. Given the complexity\nof our Federal Government structure, the National Government will monitor performance across all five\nGovernments.  The  policy-level  monitoring  will  be  the  primary  responsibility  of  the  Department  of\nEconomic Affairs. The staff economists within the Policy division of that department will provide the\ntechnical expertise to support program implementation and monitoring, in conjunction with the EMPAT\nadvisers with whom they work. The Department of Economic Affairs, as the implementing agency, will\nalso  provide  a  full-time  project  implementation  specialist  within  its  project  implementation  unit  to\neffectively facilitate the use of the complex set of technical and financial inputs anticipated under the\nPSDP. It is further understood that, while the policy loan effectivity will be a condition for project loan\neffectivity and vice versa, each of the investment project components will proceed according to detailed\nproject  timelines  and  subject  to  the  specific,  project-related  commitments  undertaken  by  each\ngovernment.\nRepresenting the borrowing entity, the executing agency will be the National Department of Finance and\nAdministration. It should be clear that the conditions agreed to in the policy matrix for each Government\nwill be binding only on that Government. I do not anticipate any failures to meet the stated conditions for\ntranche release; however, the unanticipated problems of any individual Government should, to the\nmaximum extent possible, not cause ADB to delay the release of finances to those Governments that\nhave fully met the conditions to which they committed. The FSM Government views the PSDP as a\nsecond phase in our successful and ongoing effort in conditioned collaboration with ADB and other\ndonors who may be contributors of financial and/or technical support.\nYours sincerely,\nJohn Ehsa\nSecretary of Finance and Administration", "POLICY MATRIX\nThe First Tranche will be disbursed at loan effectivity. The Government will have registered adequate progress by November 2001 and this is\ndescribed in the Development Policy Letter.  The actions listed in the Policy Matrix must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of ADB as conditions for\nBoard consideration (first tranche release) and second tranche release. The two tranches will be released to the national Government in two steps\nif necessary, the first tranche being released when the national Government and at least two of the States meet the targets set out in the Policy\nMatrix. For the state(s) not meeting the targets, the corresponding amount will be withheld; subsequently releases could be made as the state(s)\nachieve their targets, provided these are met by August 2002 and February 2004.
