The Government\u2019s request for the proposed PSDP loan\nresulted  from  the  Second  FSM  Economic  Summit  held  in  September  1999,  which  defined\nprivate  sector  development  as  the  overarching  national  development  goal.2  ADB  agreed  to\nconsider  the  request,  as  it  fitted  in  with  the  revised  Pacific  Strategy3  and  initiated  loan\nprocessing in 2000 for approval in 2001. Accordingly, the ADB loan Fact-Finding Mission was\nfielded during 24 May-9 June 2000 and followed up by an appraisal mission in September 2000.\nThe missions visited all four FSM states, and discussed the policy and investment components\nidentified  under  the  TA.  The  national  and  state  governments  expressed  strong  interest  in  and\nsupport  for  the  PSDP.  Appropriate  draft  legislation  was  submitted  in  late  2000  to  the  FSM\nCongress.  Consideration  of  the  PSDP  loan  by  the  FSM  Congress  was  delayed  to  allow\nadequate  time  for  all  four  states  to  participate  and  reach  a  level  of  ownership  that  will  ensure\nsustainability of the program. To augment this process, a country programming and consultation\nmission  visited  the  FSM  from  18  to  31  July  2001.  The  mission  revalidated  and  updated  the\nPSDP  loan  documents,  as  well  as  held  consultations  with  the  states  and  the  national\nGovernment  to  ensure  that  all  states  are  able  to  meet  the  conditions  of  and  participate  in  the\nproposed PSDP loan. Legislation to borrow for the PSDP loan is expected to be acted upon in\nthe November 2001 session of the FSM Congress. The program framework for the PSDP is in\nAppendix 1.\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nMacroeconomic Context\n\n1. \n\nDevelopment Potential and Economic Prospects\n\nThe FSM comprises more than 600 islands totaling 702 square kilometers (km2) of land\n3.\narea scattered over an exclusive economic zone of 2.6 million km2  in the western central Pacific\nOcean.  The  islands  are  divided  among  four  states:  Chuuk  (133.8  km2),  Kosrae  (117.4  km2),\nPohnpei  (360.6  km2),  and  Yap  (125  km2)  with  the  national  government  located  in  Pohnpei  at\nPalikir.  Island  landforms  vary  from  high  islands  with  extensive  tropical  forests  and  substantial\nareas suitable for agriculture to narrow atolls. The ocean area of the FSM\u2019s exclusive economic\nzone  is  the  country\u2019s  greatest  natural  resource.  Estimates4  indicate  that  the  western  Pacific\ncould support annual catches of at least 0.4 million tons of skipjack tuna, and 0.65 million tons\nof yellow fin tuna, but the sustainable catch of bigeye tuna and albacore is fully exploited. The\nFSM\u2019s  natural  beauty  and  reasonable  proximity  to  Guam,  Palau,  and  the  Philippines  places  it\nwell to capitalize on the growing tourism to the region from Asia, especially Japan; the United\n\n                  \n\n1  TA 3278-FSM: Private Sector Development Program, for $150,000, approved on 19 October 1999.\n2  Through  TA  3024-FSM: Economic Policy Reform and Management (EMPAT II),  for  $2,877,000,  approved  on  12\n\nMay 1998, ADB provided economic advisory support to, and participated in, the Summit.\n\n3  ADB. 2000.

But the FSM\u2019s small population (111,500 persons in 1998),\nlimited land area, and relative isolation from markets limit its capacity to take advantage of some\nof the opportunities presented. In the main centers of each state, basic economic infrastructure,\nincluding  roads,  airports,  ports,  access  to  telecommunications,  electricity,  water,  and  other\nutilities is of reasonable quality and reliability. Outside the main centers, the state of completion\nand durability of infrastructure are still variable.\n\n4.\nThe  FSM\u2019s  political  and  economic  ties  with  the  US  through  the  Compact  of  Free\nAssociation, a treaty agreement, places the country in a unique situation. While the treaty was\ndrafted to last indefinitely, provisions under Title Two, Economic Relations, are time bound and\ndue  to  expire  in  FY2001.  The  Compact  allows  for  annual  cash  grants  (in  nominal  terms)\naveraging  $98  million  for  FY1987/91,  $90  million  for  FY1992/96,  and  $79  million  for  the  third\nfive-year  period  FY1997/2001.  A  significant  amount  of  grant  transfer  contributed  to  notable\naverage  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  of  4.2  percent  during  FY1987/95  mainly\nbased on large government spending. However, the two step-downs of Compact funding have\nrequired  fiscal  austerity  and  led  to  negative  economic  growth  averaging  minus  1.5  percent\nduring FY1995/2001. Facing the second step-down in the Compact funding starting in 1996, the\nFSM  launched  public  sector  and  economic  reforms,  supported  by  an  ADB  program  loan.5  An\nimportant component of the Public Sector Reform Program (PSRP) involved reducing the size\nand operating costs of government.\n\nAt the time of the 2000 annual census, FSM had a total population of 107,008.6 Chuuk is\n5.\nthe most populous state with 53,595. From 1989 to 1994, the population grew at an average of\n1.96  percent per annum. However, due largely to increased out-migration, the annual rate from\n1994  to  2000  was  just  0.24  percent.  In  2001,  40.3  percent  of  the  population  was  aged  0\u201314.\nThe dependency level is very high, especially from the young, raising the income requirements\nfor  the  average  family  and  lowering  per  capita  incomes.  A  crude  estimate  indicates  that  a\nprojected  annual  growth  rate  of  over  12  percent  is  needed  by  the  economy  to  absorb  the\ncurrently  unemployed  and  upcoming  entrants  to  the  labor  market.  This  is  a  daunting  prospect\nconsidering the recent contractions in GDP and real growth levels of 1.1 percent in FY1999, 2.5\npercent in FY2000, and 0.9 percent in FY2001.\n\nTo  cope  with  these  macroeconomic  and  demographic  challenges  and  to  exploit  the\n6.\nFSM\u2019s  economic  potential,  a  response  by  the  private  sector  is  critical.  If  the  country  is  to\nbecome  more  resilient  to  external  shocks  and  to  create  even  a  portion  of  the  employment\nneeded to absorb public sector retirees, the unemployed, and the upcoming influx of youth, the\ncountry  should  pursue  private  sector-led  economic  growth.  However,  many  of  the  conditions\nthat  are  essential  for  private  investment  and  economic  growth  need  to  be  improved  urgently.\nThe country\u2019s legal systems and public institutions' ability to manage and support the markets\nfor private land, labor, and capital remain inadequate. Without internal market infrastructure that\ncan attract, utilize, and circulate these resources, any bank or other externally-supplied capital\nand skills will be less effective in supporting sustained economic growth.\n\n2. \n\nEconomic Performance and Developments\n\n7.\nReal GDP estimates indicate that the FSM economy as a whole has grown at an annual\naverage  rate  of  1.8  percent  from  $169  million  in  1987  to  $218  million  in  2001  (all  in  FY1998\n\n                  \n\n5  Loan 1520-FSM: Public Sector Reform Program, for $18.0 million, approved on 29 April 1997 and completed on 31\n\nDecember 1999.\n\n6  DEA. 1998. Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Division of Statistics.\n\n\f3\n\nconstant terms). Underlying this positive but modest growth are the fundamental effects of the\nresource  transfers  from  the  US  prior  to  and  following  the  Compact  agreement,  and  the  major\nrole government has assumed in the economy. During the second half of the 1990s, the FSM\neconomy  slumped,  as  US \nin\ngovernment  expenditure,  and  as  the  private  sector,  significantly  dependent  on  government\nspending, began to adjust. The FSM economy as a whole contracted at an annual rate of minus\n1.5 percent during FY1995/2001. However, the economy appears to have bottomed out; it grew\nby about 1.1 percent in FY1999, 2.5 percent in FY2000, and 0.9 percent in FY2001.\n\ntransfers  declined,  necessitating  downward  adjustments \n\n8.\nThe real GDP per capita in FY2000 is estimated at $2,036, which places the FSM in the\nmiddle  income  group  of  ADB\u2019s  12  Pacific  developing  member  countries.  The  difference  in\neconomic performance by state is significant. Real GDP per capita of Chuuk ($1,170) was one-\nthird  of  Yap  ($3,215)  in  FY1999.  Overall  GDP  growth  was  strongest  during  FY1987/2001  in\nPohnpei (3.0 percent), Yap (2.9 percent), and Kosrae (0.6 percent), while GDP declined slightly\nin Chuuk (minus 0.2 percent). As the effects of economic shocks set in, the FSM private sector\ndeclined from FY1995/2001 by minus 1.6 percent per annum; however, among the states, only\nPohnpei experienced a decline in private sector activity during this period of minus 4.8 percent\nper annum.\n\n9.\nOver  the  first  five-year  period  under  the  Compact  transfers,  FSM-wide  government\nexpenditure increased by 62 percent from $104 million in FY1987 to $170 million in FY1991. In\nthe second five-years of funding, deficit spending using surpluses from previous years created\nthe circumstances for the difficult adjustments that followed the second step-down in Compact\nfunding. Painful adjustments were made by the five governments of the FSM through the PSRP.\nThis included a reduction in the FSM-wide government workforce of 23 percent, and wage cuts\nand  restraint  to  effect  payroll  savings  of  $17  million  per  year  or  a  reduction  of  29  percent.\nGovernment spending fell from more than 100 percent of GDP, during FY1989/91 to 66 percent\nin  FY2000.  Consolidated  FSM  Government  revenues,  including  Compact  transfers,  and\nexpenditures are close to balancing.\n\n10.\nPrior  to  FY1990,  the  FSM  had  no  official  public  debts  to  offshore  lenders.  During\nFY1990/1993,  borrowing  increased  to  a  peak  of  $137  million  in  FY1993,  representing  66\npercent  of  GDP.  The  borrowing  included  $71  million  for  Yap  State\u2019s  monetization  program,\n$42.9  million  for  fisheries  investments  through  the  state  and  national  fisheries  enterprises,  as\nwell  as  public  guaranteed  borrowing  for  telecommunications  ($41  million)  and  fisheries  in  Yap\n($9  million).  Since  FY1993,  the  only  new  borrowing  has  been  from  ADB,  including  fisheries\ndevelopment,7  the  PSRP  (footnote  5),  and  water  supply  and  sanitation.8    Disciplined  debt\nservicing has allowed the debt to fall to slightly over $80 million in 1999 and is expected to fall to\n24 percent of GDP by FY2001. Nonetheless, the uncertainties over the future of US economic\ntransfers including the form, amount, and conditions of the assistance are not likely to be known\nuntil  2003.  Given  the  lack  of  knowledge  of  future  financial  and  economic  assistance  from  the\nUS,  the  FSM  governments  prefer  to  take  a  cautious  approach  to  bearing  additional  debt  over\nthe short term. Regardless of the result of the new Compact renewal, the Government needs to\nstay  the  course  of  reforms  and  to  improve  the  enabling  environment  for  private  sector\ndevelopment, an engine of growth, so that new US assistance will contribute to building a more\nself-reliant economy.\n\n                  \n\n7  Loan 1257-FSM: Fishery Development Project, for $6.4 million, approved on 19 October 1993.\n8  Loan 1459-FSM: Water Supply and Sanitation Project, for $10.2 million, approved on 19 September 1996.\n\n\f4\n\n3. \n\nIncidence of Poverty\n\n11.\nThe incidence and nature of poverty in the FSM is unclear given the lack of specific data,\nbut the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) human poverty index of 26.7 indicates\nthe  FSM  has  the  fourth  highest  level  of  poverty  among  the  Pacific  developing  member\ncountries.  A  tentative  head-count  estimate  of  poverty  for  the  FSM  uses  the  latest  household\nincome and expenditure survey of 1998. The preliminary estimate is that about 40 percent of all\nFSM families live below the food threshold; about $575 is required for a family to consume the\nminimum  required  number  of  calories.  Similarly,  based  on  the  average  proportion  a  family\nspends on food as a share of total income, about 40% of all FSM families live below the overall\npoverty threshold of $1,075. Variation in poverty is substantial between the states, the poorest\nbeing  Chuuk  with  a  poor  population  of  53  percent  and  Yap,  the  least  poor,  with  16  percent.\nIncome in Yap is also better distributed, with the ratio of mean income of the highest 20 percent\nof  households  to  the  lowest  20  percent  being  7.3,  as  against  13.3  for  Pohnpei,  which  has  the\nhighest income inequality. Larger households tend to be poorer than small households. A higher\nproportion of households headed by women tends to be poor (43.7 percent, as compared with\n39.6 percent for men and 40.4 percent overall).\n\n12.\nA range of social problems, including high dependency ratio and high population growth\n(2.3  to  2.5  percent  natural  growth  rate)  compared  with  economic  growth,  low  educational\nattainment  and  poor  education  services,  increased  unemployment  arising  from  government\ndownsizing,  limited  formal  employment  opportunities  in  the  private  sector,  and  reduced\ngovernment budgets for social services place the FSM at risk of social decline and an increased\nincidence of poverty. The greatest risk is in Chuuk State, which has the lowest per capita GDP.\nGroups  that  are  at  the  greatest  risk  include  locationally  disadvantaged  outer  islanders  and\npeople  residing  far  from  main  centers  (an  estimated  17  percent  of  the  population  or  18,000),\nmigrants to the main islands,9  school dropouts, unemployed youth, and dislocated public sector\nworkers with inappropriate skills for the private sector. Micronesian society can offset some of\nthe impact by drawing upon the obligations of the extended family, but this also places a burden\non the income earners, further straining low household incomes. Recent successive economic\ncontractions suggest that the already low standards of education, health, and law enforcement\nwill  decline,  having  a  negative  impact  particularly  on  the  outer  islanders  and  migrants  to  the\nmain islands who are virtually landless.\n\nB. \n\nSector Description and Recent Performance\n\n1. \n\nThe Role of the Private Sector in Gross Domestic Product\n\n13.\nThe  largest  single  sector  in  the  FSM  economy  is  government  services.  Although  the\ncontribution of government services to GDP has fallen from 36 percent of GDP in FY1987 to 23\npercent in FY2001, this is still high by international standards, including other Pacific countries.\nThe second largest sector is wholesale and retail trade, which has grown largely in response to\nthe  spending  power  of  salaried  government  workers.  Subsistence  production  from  agriculture\nand  inshore  fisheries  is  estimated  to  be  the  third  largest  sector.  Subsistence  production,\ntherefore, still makes a significant contribution to the economy through informal activity outside\nthe market economy.\n\n                  \n\n9  In  Pohnpei  State,  over  2,000  outer  islanders  have  settled  on  the  main  island  of  Pohnpei,  while  5,000  outer\nislanders have settled on the small island of Weno, the state capital of Chuuk (ADB. 1993. Women in Development\nStudy, Country Briefing Paper. Manila.).\n\n\f5\n\nUntil  FY1990,  the  public  sector  contributed  a  larger  amount  to  GDP  than  the  private\n14.\nsector.  Since  1989,  the  private  sector  contribution  began  to  exceed  the  public  sector.  In\nFY1998, the contribution of the formal private sector to GDP was 31 percent, and subsistence\ncontributed  14.0  percent.  The  combined  private  sector  activity  has  contributed  more  to  the\neconomy than the government every year since FY1991 and grew at an average annual rate of\n7.2  percent  from  1987  to  1995.  Between  FY1995  and  FY2001,  the  contribution  of  the\ngovernment  to  GDP  fell  by  7.7  percent  annually,  whereas  private  sector  activity  fell  by  an\naverage 1.6 percent annually.\n\n2. \n\nThe Structure of the Private Sector\n\n15.\nIf the market economy alone is considered, that is contributions to GDP from private and\npublic  enterprises  excluding  government  services  and  subsistence  production,  then  the\ndominance of the wholesale and retail trade is even more pronounced. An estimated 51 percent\nof  the  market  economy  arises  from  wholesale  and  retail  trade,  while  the  two  major  export\nsectors,  fisheries  and  tourism,  account  for  only  11  percent.  Commercial  agriculture  is  even\nsmaller,  representing  only  2  percent  of  the  market  economy.  This  indicates  that  the  private\nsector, in its current form, is dominated by nontraded goods and services that can only be sold\nand bought within the domestic economy, such as wholesale and retail goods, rental property,\nand services to support government operations. The 1996 survey of businesses indicates that\nwholesale  and  retail  trade  dominated  the  formal  sector  in  terms  of  number  of  establishments\n(57.8  percent),  employment  (49.3  percent),  wages  (27.6  percent),  and  value  added  (55.8\npercent).\n\n16.\nThe  reason  for  an  economic  structure  based  largely  on  nontraded  goods  and  services\nstems from the creation of a government sector that became the largest employer in the FSM\nand  the  resulting  higher  relative  cash  incomes  in  that  sector.  As  a  result,  lifestyles  have\nchanged as reflected in the increased demand for imported foods and products, which became\nmore  affordable  and  preferred  for  their  convenience.  The  private  sector  responded  by\nexpanding  into  the  lucrative  wholesale  and  retail  businesses.  Furthermore,  as  government\nemployment  provided  a  satisfactory  income  as  an  alternative  to  the  relatively  high-labor-\ndemanding  subsistence  and  small-scale  commercial  agriculture  and  fisheries  sectors,  the\nrelative  returns  dropped  for  resources  used  in  agriculture  and  coastal  fisheries.  This  has\nresulted  in  decreased  use  and  production  of  a  variety  of  domestic  products,  especially  in\nsubsistence and small-scale commercial agriculture and fisheries.  Even ocean fisheries (tuna),\ndespite the high value of fish exports, currently make only a small contribution in terms of value\nadded to the economy.\n\n17.\nUnder a situation of US economic assistance step-downs and government downsizing,\nthe greatest negative economic impact has been on businesses dealing with nontraded goods\nand services. As wholesale and retail is the largest sector in the market economy, initially this\nsector  will  be  at  greatest  risk.  Because  the  FSM  economy  has  grown  based  on  an  inward-\nlooking  strategy  in  terms  of  products  and  markets,  the  FSM\u2019s  relative  competitiveness  in  the\nworld market is weak. To become more resilient to future changes in transfers and to reduce the\ncurrent levels of dependence on government-directed and -financed development, the tradable\nsector must be expanded through private sector activity.\n\n3. \n\nEnterprises, Employment, and Wages in the Private Sector\n\nCommercial  and  business  activity  is  dominated  by  informal  and  formal  small-  and\n18.\nmedium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs).  Apart  from  the  government  and  utilities  corporations,  few\nlarge  businesses  exist  that  can  create  major  employment  or  single  markets  for  other\n\n\f6\n\nbusinesses. As such, most small businesses in the FSM can be characterized as having a small\nmarket share, and personalized owner operator or family management, that is too small to gain\naccess to commercial banking services. In 1998, an estimated 2,000 formal and informal SMEs\nwere  operating  in  the  four  states  (600  in  Chuuk,  300  in  Kosrae,  800  in  Pohnpei,  and  300  in\nYap).10 Excluding occasional sales from subsistence production, SMEs comprise more than 90\npercent of the total number of enterprises, and employ about 9,500 of a potential labor force of\n59,000. Hence, any meaningful and effective intervention for private sector development in the\nFSM  will  have  to  consider  the  important  role  SMEs  play  in  the  economic  and  social\ndevelopment of the country.\n\n19.\nThe  informal  sector  plays  an  important  and  often  unacknowledged  role  in  the  FSM\neconomy.  The  majority  of  the  FSM  population  live  in  rural  areas  including  outer  islands  and\nengage  in  subsistence  and  mixed  subsistence  production  for  their  livelihood.  The  FY2001  in-\nkind income from subsistence was $33 million compared with formal private sector wages and\nprofits  of  $71  million.  Given  the  limited  opportunities  for  earning  cash  incomes  in  the  formal\nsector,  the  subsistence  and  informal  sectors  continue  to  support  an  increasing  number  of\npeople.  The  sale  of  surplus  subsistence  production  from  agriculture  and  inshore  fisheries\nprovides a useful and significant contribution to livelihoods, especially for nonsalaried persons.\nInformal  sales  of  subsistence  production  in  1998  were  estimated  at  $9.1  million  inclusive  of\nexports  of  local  agricultural  produce  of  under  $2  million  (footnote  6).  Such  informal  sales  are\noften  the  basis  from  which  commercialization  through  the  informal  sector  occurs.  This  is\nespecially  evident  in  Truk  Lagoon  of  Chuuk  State,  where  the  combined  sales  of  fresh  and\nprocessed  local  foods  (agricultural  and  fisheries)  have  provided  the  basis  for  well-established\nmarkets in Weno. Part of this produce is exported to Guam. An increasing focus is needed on\nenhancing the capacity of the subsistence and informal sectors to encourage \"graduation\" into\nthe  formal  private  sector  enabling  the  generation  of  employment  opportunities.  Experience\nshows  that  the  informal  sector  is  an  important  source  of  entrepreneurial  talent,  particularly  of\nwomen.\n\n20.\nThe FSM\u2019s labor market faces a number of major problems and constraints including (i)\na demographic imbalance that will require a rapid expansion of the job market in the near future;\n(ii) a formal elementary and secondary education situation that is generating a high proportion of\ndropouts; (iii) lack of wage competitiveness; and (iv) limitations in the ability of the labor market\nand  institutions  to  provide  skilled  labor.  The  high  dependency  level  means  the  average  family\nneeds  more  income  to  survive.  Even  though  out-migration  to  the  US  is  expected  to  have\nincreased in recent years, in effect reducing the population growth rate, this will not redress the\nhigh  dependency  ratio.  A  response  by  the  private  sector,  supported  by  a  more  favorable\ninvestment and pro-private-sector climate, is critical if the economy is to grow and create even a\nportion  of  the  employment  needed  to  absorb  the  public  sector  retirees,  the  unemployed  and\nunderemployed, and the upcoming influx of youths about to enter the job market. The informal\nsector  and  even  out-migration  of  Micronesians  who  are  better  trained  for  the  overseas  job\nmarket are an integral part of the overall need to raise gainful employment in the population.\n\n                  \n\n10 In  1994, \n\nthe  UNDP/United  Nations \n\nIndustrial  Development  Organization  (UNIDO)-assisted  Micronesian\nEntrepreneur Development Center program proposed a bill to the Pohnpei Legislature, the Business Development\nAct of 1994, which became law on 10 January 1995. The law defines SMEs as any business activity or enterprise\nengaged  in  industry,  agribusiness,  tourism,  trade,  and/or  industrial  and  business  services,  whether  single\nproprietorship, cooperative, partnership, or corporation whose total assets inclusive of those arising from loans but\nexclusive of the land on which the particular business entity\u2019s office, plant, and equipment are situated, must have\nvalue  falling  under  the  following  categories:  Cottage:  Less  than  $5,000;  Small:  $5,001  to  $25,000;  or  Medium:\n$25,001 to $250,000.\n\n\f7\n\nThe  fact  that  public  sector  wages  are  almost  double  that  of  the  private  sector  has  two\n21.\nmajor  effects.  First,  higher  public  sector  wages  have  attracted  scarce  qualified  people  to\ngovernment over the private sector, and acted as a disincentive to private sector employment.\nSecond, pay levels have been pushed up due to the large and relatively better paid government.\nThe resulting high labor costs for the private sector have increased overall production costs in\nthe private sector, and reduced competitiveness of the sector especially if higher wages are not\nmatched  with  increased  productivity.  An  important  first  step  in  adjusting  the  labor  market\nthrough  downsizing  and  pay  restraints  in  favor  of  private  sector  development  was  the\nimplementation  of  the  PSRP.  Nevertheless  large  differences  in  pay  levels  and  conditions  still\nexist, and continue to favor public sector employment, divert skilled labor away from the private\nsector,  and  undermine  the  competitiveness  of  the  private  sector  through  higher  wage\nexpectations. However, adjustment of wage differentials alone is not sufficient.\n\n22.\nEducation  attainment  is  essential  for  expanding  private  sector  employment.  While  a\nlarge  government  will  have  increased  skills  necessary  for  public  services,  these  are  not\nnecessarily  suitable  for  private  sector  activity.  As  literacy  and  numeracy  achievement  at  the\nelementary  level  is  low,  the  majority  of  the  population  are  ill-prepared  for  employment  by  the\nprivate sector, which often requires basic skills such as English language communication, and in\nmany cases even unskilled work. The current labor market situation is still limited by its inability\nto provide domestic skilled labor needed by the private sector, and skill gaps continue to prevail.\n\nC. \n\nConstraints and Issues\n\nA survey conducted by the Forum Secretariat11 revealed that significant impediments to\n23.\nforeign  investments  commonly  exist  in  the  Pacific  island  countries.  The  most  significant\nimpediments  are  (i)  bureaucratic  delays;  (ii)  changes  in  government  policies;  (iii)  land  tenure\nissues related to the adjudication, survey, registration, and issuance of land titles; and (iv) lack\nof administrative skills in dealing with foreign investment matters. In addition to these policy and\nregulatory  impediments,  overall  economic  prospects  of  the  country  and  labor  skills  were\nidentified as other factors affecting investment. The investors raised virtually no concerns about\ninfrastructure. ADB TA for preparing the PSDP and the TA\u2019s own survey in December 1999 on\nSMEs  confirm  the  major  findings  of  the  Forum  Secretariat\u2019s  survey,  as  well  as  particular\nconstraints to development of the private sector in the FSM (footnote 1).\n\n1. \n\nFragile Policy and Regulatory Environment\n\na. \n\nNeed for Consolidating Public Sector Reforms\n\nfinancial  adjustments  and  government  restructuring.  However,  since \n\nThrough  the  ADB-funded  PSRP,  the  national  and  state  governments  successfully\n24.\nimplemented \nthe\ncompletion of the PSRP in 1999, the governments are facing pressure to rehire staff and raise\ngovernment  wage  levels.  Furthermore,  despite  the  wage  cuts  in  the  government  sector  under\nthe  PSRP,  FSM  public  sector  wages  are  almost  double  that  of  the  private  sector  on  average.\nThis  continues  to  favor  public  sector  employment  and  undermine  the  competitiveness  of  the\nprivate sector through higher wage expectations and diversion of skilled labor. Under the current\nCompact agreement, if the negotiations are not concluded by 2001, then a two-year extension\nof  the  current  agreement  is  automatically  provided  with  annual  payments  calculated  at  an\n\n                  \n\n11 Forum Secretariat. 1998.

The surveyed investors comprised potential\nand recent existing investors, and the investors who have withdrawn from the Forum countries.\n\n\f8\n\naverage  of  the  annual  payments  over  the  first  15  years  of  the  current  agreement.  This  will\namount to a 27.5 percent increase over the Compact base grant compared with FY2001. While\nthis  provides  for  short-term  improvement  in  the  FSM's  fiscal  situation,  the  Government  should\navoid a temporary increase in unnecessary and unsustainable spending as this could lead to an\neconomic shock of even greater magnitude than those experienced following the two Compact\nstep-downs.\n\nMany  of  the  FSM  governments  have  sponsored  risky,  commercial  operations.12    While\n25.\nthe goal of setting up these operations was to make up for the perceived capacity deficiencies of\nthe  domestic  private  sector,  in  many  cases  these  ventures  resulted  in  substantial  financial\nlosses for the national and state governments, and have not contributed in a meaningful manner\nto  sustainable  economic  development.  In  addition,  such  sponsorship  of  purely  commercially\noriented  enterprises  in  some  cases  led  to  crowding  out  of  private  sector  activities  rather  than\nfacilitating  their  development.  Focusing  public  spending  on  production  has  detracted  from\nactivities  and  the  delivery  of  services  to  remove  production  constraints  for  the  private  sector,\nsuch  as  providing  information  on  markets,  increasing  know-how,  and  providing  effective\nbusiness development support.\n\n26.\nAs a part of PSRP reforms that began in 1997, the state and national governments have\nundertaken  a  review  of  the  functions  of  several  departments  and  public  enterprises  to  identify\nactivities  that  can  be  privatized,  corporatized,  or  divested  entirely.  Most  of  the  states  have\nalready transferred the major utilities of power, water, and sanitation to independent public utility\nauthorities,  which  are  run,  more  or  less,  on  a  commercial  basis.  Furthermore,  several  other\nactivities  that  were  part  of  departmental  operations  have  been  privatized  or  contracted  out.\nHowever,  the  actual  implementation  of  public  enterprise  reforms  has  seldom  gone  beyond\ncommercialization  and  corporatization.  Reasons  include  lack  of  commercial  viability  in  their\ncurrent  structure,  complexity  in  legal  status  including  multiple  national  and  state  ownership,\nreluctance  to  accept  capital  write-offs,  and  the  implications  of  redundancies.  Some  statutes\ncreate an uneven playing field with the private sector, by giving some of the public enterprises\ntax exemptions and other privileges. A positive step was the establishment in January 2000 of\nthe  Public  Enterprise  Unit  within  the  Department  of  Economic  Affairs  (DEA)  to  coordinate  and\nfacilitate  formulation  of  privatization  policies  and  their  actual  implementation  with  support  from\nan  ADB  TA.13  The  TA  is  proposing  four  broad  categories  for  reform:  (i)  corporate  governance\nreform, (ii) private sector participation, (iii) divestiture, and (iv) liquidation. The general national\nand  state  governments'  commitment  to  privatization  must  be  translated  into  a  concrete,\ncomprehensive policy framework and detailed time-bound action plan that will provide the basis\nfor the actual implementation of the privatization process.\n\nb. \n\nWeak Legal and Regulatory Environment\n\nIn  the  FSM,  weaknesses  in  the  existing  enabling  legal  and  regulatory  framework  have\n27.\nproved  to  be  an  impediment  to  attracting  and  realizing  investment  and  in  some  cases  driven\n\n                  \n\n12  PSEs  in  the  FSM  can  be  subdivided  in  broad  terms  into  four  major  groups:  (i)  utilities  (telecommunications\ncorporation  of  FSM,  state  electricity,  water,  sewerage,  transportation  companies);  (ii)  fishing  (National  Fisheries\nCorporation and its subsidiaries and state government-owned fishing companies); (iii) finance (Bank of FSM and\nFSMDB);  and  (iv)  other  miscellaneous  activities,  including  housing  authorities,  broadcast  stations,  and  coconut\nprocessing  companies.  Overall,  public  enterprises  account  for  approximately  14  percent  of  formal  sector  GDP\n(1996)  and  employ  around  1,400  people,  or  about  10  percent  of  formal  sector  employment  [EMPAT  Report  on\nPublic Enterprise Reform. Majuro. Department of Economic Affairs. 1997].\n\n13 TA 3201-FSM: Privatization of Public Enterprises and Corporate Governance, for $450,000, approved on 31 March\n\n2001.\n\n\f9\n\npotential  investors  away.  The  Government  has  recognized  this  and  work  is  under  way  in  a\nnumber  of  critical  areas  that  will  improve  the  provision  of  and  access  to  economic  resources,\nresource providers, and user security.\n\nLand  must  be  more  readily  available  for  development  in  the  FSM  both  through  secure\n28.\naccess to land for production and investment activities, and as a means for mobilizing finance. A\nmajor legal obstacle is the constitutional prohibition of foreign ownership of land (nationwide), of\nownership  by  citizens  from  other  FSM  states  (Kosrae  and  Pohnpei),  and  of  any  sale  of  land\n(Pohnpei). Restrictions on the length of leases in each state (25 to 50 years depending on the\nstate with provisions for renewal in most cases) may be regarded by investors as insufficient to\nrealize  an  adequate  or  competitive  return  on  an  investment,  especially  in  sectors  such  as\ntourism,  which  is  in  the  early  stages  of  development.  As  foreigners  are  not  permitted  to  own\nland in the FSM, this limits the use of secured loans by the foreign commercial banks operating\nin  the  FSM,  as  they  cannot  arrange  direct,  mortgage-secured  lending.  The  current  state\nmortgage statutes (except Kosrae, which has only a deed of trust) lack an efficient mechanism\nof nonjudicial foreclosure, redemption, and other procedures for the commercial banks to take a\nsecurity  interest  in  the  property  including  land  leasehold.  To  address  these  land-related  legal\nissues,  the  Government,  with  ADB's  TA  support,14  has  developed  model  long-term  land  lease\nlaws and mortgage laws allowing land leasehold mortgage. These legislation drafts are deemed\nacceptable under the constitution and traditional land tenure system.\n\n29.\nHistorically, regulation of foreign investment in the FSM required lengthy, case-by-case\nreview,  and  lacked  transparency.  This  approach  to  foreign  investment  served  to  protect  local\njobs,  business  opportunities,  incomes,  and  resources.  Under  the  PSRP,  foreign  investment\nregulations  were  mostly  decentralized  and  attempts  were  made  to  improve  transparency  and\nliberalize the rules of entry of foreign investors. However, the current foreign investment laws at\nall five FSM national and state governments continue to discourage potential foreign investors\nwith  complex  application  and  discretionary  approval  systems.  In  May  2000,  the  governments\nreviewed  the  national  and  state  foreign  investment  laws  in  May  2000  in  order  to  improve  the\ntransparency  and  consistency  of  foreign  direct  investment  policies.  This  process  was  jointly\nassisted by ADB (footnote 14) and the Foreign Investment Advisory Service. The results of the\nreviews need to be implemented.\n\n30.\nA  secured  transactions  law  will  enable  lenders  to  effectively  utilize  almost  any  kind  of\nproperty, other than land, as collateral and most especially chattels. This is important for small\ninvestors and business people wishing to start or expand informal or small businesses, as well\nas  other  investors.  A  short  secured  transactions  law  from  the  Trust  Territory  days  has  proven\ninadequate to protect lenders. The need for a replacement has long been recognized and a bill\nfor establishing a nationwide secured transaction system has been prepared. The FSM does not\ncurrently have any bankruptcy law in place. In the absence of a bankruptcy law, the commercial\nenvironment loses an important element of predictability and fairness, courts are called upon to\nmake  legislative  decisions,  and  struggling  businesses,  which  might  have  succeeded,  can  be\ndestroyed prematurely by creditors intent on not being the last in line. The FSM recognizes the\nneed for national bankruptcy legislation, but such legislation lacks consensus.\n\n2. \n\nLimited Access to Land and Security of User Rights\n\n31.\nThe limited land area of the FSM, growing population, and increasing integration with the\nmarket  economy  are  placing  ever-increasing  pressure  on  the  traditions  of  ownership  and  call\n\n14 TA 2758-FSM: Improved Economic Use of Land, for $550,000, approved on 4 February 1997.\n\n                  \n\n\f10\n\nattention to the need for improved security of rights and land management and administration.\nVariable  progress  has  been  made  among  the  four  states  on  determining  status  and  titling.  In\nYap,  for  example,  less  than  10  percent  of  the  land  has  been  registered  and  titled  over  the  30\nyears since the state cadastral program commenced, largely due to the reluctance to initiate a\nsurvey that is likely to be disputed. Kosrae has made progress toward the initial determination of\nland  parcels,  although  many  disputes  are  pending  resolution  and  the  backlogs  of  parcels  that\nawait completion of surveying and mapping is substantial. In Chuuk and Yap, limitations are due\nto the inability of the customary and formal civil systems to adjudicate and determine ownership\nas a prerequisite to registration and titling. Pohnpei has made the most progress with cadastral\nsurveys of private lands, and is currently addressing a large backlog of subdivision surveys.\n\n32.\nThe  institutions  that  support  individual  titles  vary  by  state.  In  general,  two  government\ninstitutions  administer  land  tenure:  land  commissions  (Kosrae  and  Yap)  or  the  Court  of  Land\nTenure (Pohnpei), and the divisions of land management (all states). Each of these institutions\nhas a number of capacity limitations resulting in slow titling and registration. The general use of\nthe  US  land-titling  system  over  the  past  50  years  was  largely  supply-driven,  and  its  variable\neffectiveness  indicates  a  range  of  problems  and  inefficiencies  in  service  delivery,  or\ninappropriate integration with traditional systems and, consequently, a low level of demand for\nthe system in its current form. An ongoing ADB TA (footnote 14) is conducting public education\non land registration law, regulations, procedures, and the benefits of registering all landholdings.\nIn Kosrae, a bill has been introduced to strengthen the Land Commission; in Chuuk, there is an\nagreement in principle to merge land survey and the Land Commission to improve institutional\ncapacity; and, in Yap, proposals have been made for time-bound dispute settlement through the\nmunicipal  courts.  In  Pohnpei,  advanced  survey,  mapping,  and  digital  archive  equipment  were\npurchased  under  a  1996  US  Department  of  Interior  grant  (approximately  $600,000),  but  the\nequipment  is  not  being  utilized  to  its  full  potential  due  to  limitations  in  training  and  problems\nexperienced  with  implementing  TA.  These  initiatives  indicate  a  clear  understanding  in  all  four\nFSM states of the need to determine and title land.\n\nland  administration  offices  are  environmentally  unsafe  or \n\n33.\nThe  agencies  involved  in  land  administration  and  management  are  faced  with  a  broad\nrange of demanding tasks. State land administration agencies lack up-to-date equipment across\nall  areas  of  activity  and  need  skill  and  technical  training.  The  FSM  state  land  administration\nagencies do not have the resource base to catch up on the backlog of work in each state; keep\nup  with  the  everyday  requirements  for  surveying,  mapping,  and  land  transfer  functions;  or\nprovide  for  a  secure  and  accessible  land  record-keeping  system.  In  Chuuk,  Kosrae,  and  Yap,\nthe \nfor  computer\nmodernization to assist with record processing and storage, and the present facilities for record\narchiving are unsound. A land use plan exists in Pohnpei, which is necessary for public health,\nsafety, and environmental protection, but is excessively restrictive and complex, limiting usability\nand having a negative impact on private sector development. None of the states currently have\nany  valuation  methodology  or  skills  to  support  the  determination  of  fair  market  assessment  of\ntransaction prices for land rights. Markets that do exist are nonconventional and imperfect as a\nhigh  measure  of  judgment  is  exercised  hindering  the  transfer  processes  from  both  owner  and\nbuyer perspectives.\n\ninsecure \n\n3. \n\nLimited Access of Small Businesses to Finance\n\n34.\nA high level of liquidity exists in the FSM banking system, mostly invested offshore. The\nloan to deposit ratio was 34 percent in FY1990, rose to a high of 51 percent in FY1994, and fell\nto 43 percent in FY1999. This does not reflect a lack of support for the domestic economy by\nthe  banks,  but  is  indicative  of  other  impediments  to  increased  lending.  The  commercial  banks\n\n\f11\n\nare reluctant to increase lending to the private sector because of the risky nature of start-up and\nsmall business lending, absence of effective legal provisions for securing loans against suitable\ncollateral, as well as difficulties in foreclosure procedures. This is exacerbated by (i) commercial\nbank  perceptions  that  applicants  lack  business  experience  and  commercial  know-how,  (ii)  the\nlack  of  bankable  propositions,  and  (iii)  to  varying  degrees,  the  capacity  of  banks  to  effectively\nsupport  lending  in  the  productive  sectors.  Even  if  they  were  prepared  to  lend,  foreign  and\ndomestic  commercial  banks  are  reluctant  to  provide  commercial  loans  below  $10,000  due  to\nhigh  administration  costs  and  are  mostly  limited  to  short-term  working  capital  loans  for\nestablished and reliable businesses. The preferred bank for commercial lending is the FSMDB\ndue to lower interest rates (9 percent) and longer repayment terms, but slow response to loan\napplications  and  perceived  poor  service  limits  access  to  the  bank\u2019s  loan  capital.  A  survey\nconducted  under  TA  3278  (footnote  1)  revealed  that  only  40  percent  of  businesses  have\napproached a financing institution for a loan.15\n\n35.\nFSMDB  has  made  a  greater  contribution  to  the  demand  for  start-up  and  expanding\nbusiness  capital  than  other  commercial  banks.  FSMDB  already  has  four  state  branches  and\nsufficient staff, including those for outreach services to outer islands. Unlike other Pacific island\ndevelopment banks, its financial position is strong with relatively low debt (2.75 percent of bank-\nowned  assets),  and  a  high  level  of  cash  and  investments  (50  percent  of  bank-owned  assets).\nSignificant revenues are earned on investment income and in FY1999 the FSMDB recorded net\nearnings  of  $421,444  after  provision  for  bad  and  doubtful  debts  ($650,000).  It  is  seeking  to\nimprove access for small borrowers in several ways. First, loan approval authority for loans of\nless than $50,000 has been decentralized to the branches. Second, under the newly launched\nOutreach  Program,  branch  staff  are  traveling  to  the  rural  areas  and  outer  islands  to  hold\ncommunity  meetings.  Outputs  under  the  program  are  reflected  in  the  bank's  annual\nmanagement  by  objectives  document,  which  sets  objectives  for  outer  island  loans  as  well  as\nsmall  loans  generally.  Third,  equity  or  margin  requirements  have  been  waived  for  agricultural,\nfisheries, and manufacturing loans of less than $10,000 and application procedures simplified.\nFourth,  Kosrae  and  Chuuk  branches  have  reduced  minimum  loan  size  to  $500,  the  former  in\nconnection with an agricultural loan scheme in which 180 loans have been made to participants\nof  a  special  training  course  organized  by  Kosrae  MEDC  in  collaboration  with  the  extension\ndepartments. By May 2000, the Chuuk branch had already approved 20 small loans (of below\n$1,000)  against  its  target  of  50  for  2000  and  is  processing  the  remaining  30.  Seven  of  the  20\nloans were provided to the trainees of the Chuuk MEDC, and 13 to women. The Chuuk branch\nalso  made  7  of  the  20  loans  under  a  separate  management  by  objectives  target  to  outer\nislanders. Partly as a result of the new FSMDB emphasis on reaching small borrowers, average\nloan size in 2000 until May was much lower ($17,241) than the cumulative average of $76,000\nsince  the  commencement  of  lending  in  1982.  Less  than  2  percent  of  the  bank's  lending  has\nbeen in loans of less than $10,000. This share is expected to increase.\n\nBut, despite recent improvements in FSMDB's financial position and its recent initiatives\n36.\nto  increase  support  to  start-up  and  small  business,  the  bank  needs  to  be  more  responsive  to\nlocal  state  requirements  and  more  effective  in  providing  banking  services.  A  number  of\nweaknesses  must  be  addressed  to  improve  FSMDB  services,  including  an  unclear  corporate\nmission, past political interference, and operational problems. If FSMDB is to play a pivotal role\nin private sector development, then improvements are needed in management from the board\n\n                  \n\n15 Approximately 70 percent of the financing in starting the business comes from the owners\u2019 cash contribution (40\npercent) and personal assets (30  percent). Bank financing constitutes only 23 percent of start-up capital. Working\ncapital is predominantly self-financed.\n\n\f12\n\nlevel  to  senior  and  midlevel  management,  through  to  service  staff,  especially  in  the  outreach\nprogram to start-up and small business.\n\n4. \n\nInadequate Business Support Services for SMEs\n\n37.\nSMEs  in  the  FSM  suffer  from  a  number  of  problems  including  a  general  lack  of\nentrepreneurial  tradition;  lack  of  understanding  of  domestic  markets;  inadequate  sources  of\ninformation  on  products  and  technologies;  nonavailability  or  high  cost  of  tools  and  equipment;\nlack of supplies and high cost of raw materials and intermediate inputs, most of which must be\nimported; and high cost of fuel, transport, and communications. The development of exports is\neven  more  difficult  given  the  lack  of  exposure  and  experience  in  export  markets.  With  the\nexception of local ocean fishery operators, most SMEs can be described as nonexporters, start-\nups, or occasional exporters.\n\n38.\nThe  MEDC  project  (footnote  10)  has  developed  a  useful  program  of  training  for\nentrepreneurship and business proposal preparation, and to a lesser extent, advisory services\nfor  start-up  and  small  businesses.  In  particular,  MEDCs  have  been  promoting  tripartite\noperations  to  help  small  business  involved  with  the  FSMDB  small  loan  program;  MEDCs  also\nwork with nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to promote the participation of women. All state\nMEDCs are located in the state department of commerce and industry except in Pohnpei where\nthe  MEDC  operates  as  an  attached  unit  to  the  Department  of  Resource  Management  and\nDevelopment.  Under  a  weak  governance  environment,  the  current  status  of  the  MEDC  raises\nconcerns  of  potential  clients  over  protection  of  business  secrets.  Typically,  a  director  or\nadministrator;  one  to  two  local  business  advisers;  one  to  two  expatriate  business  advisers,\nusually international volunteers; plus an administrative assistant/secretary comprise the MEDC\nstaff. Its limited staff base and provision of general business and entrepreneurship development\ncannot satisfy the demand for postbusiness start-up counseling and extension type-support. As\nbusinesses develop, the range and demand for services is expanding, including more specific\nmarket and product information, advice on joint ventures and other more sophisticated business\narrangements raised in the TA business survey (footnote 1).16 Increased MEDC staff capacity is\nurgently needed to meet the expanding demands of the nascent and diverse private sector. In\nparticular, additional specialist staff in state business support centers and improved interagency\nlinkages are necessary to meet more specific support needs for business.\n\nD. \n\nGovernment Expenditure\n\nGovernment expenditures for the private sector have focused on directly participating in\n39.\ncommercial  activities  through  public  sector  enterprises  and  their  own  agencies,  rather  than\nmaintaining sound policy and legal systems and securing essential public services and physical\ninfrastructure  to  support  private  sector  development.  Since  1987  the  national  and  state\ngovernments  have  invested  approximately  $300  million  in  public  enterprises.  Audit  reports  in\n1998  indicate  that  the  Government  provided  $6.6  million  in  operating  subsidies,  other  grants\nand subsidies, and new capital contributions.17 The government expenditures for private sector\nsupport services focus on salaries, while expenditures for nonwage operational costs and new\ninvestments are limited.\n\n                  \n\n16 Eighty-five percent of respondents considered they needed training by order of preference in business skills (such\nas  in  marketing,  customer  service,  etc.),  entrepreneurship  and  management,  accounting/bookkeeping,  and\ntechnical  skills.  More  than  80  percent  of  the  respondents  considered  a  need  for  on-business  advisory  services,\nprimarily  in  solving  business  problems  and  preparing  business  plans.  Other  advisory  needs  are  in  obtaining\nbusiness information and preparing loan proposals.\n17 Operating losses in the same period were $12.5 million.\n\n\f13\n\n40.\nLand  Administration.  The  land  survey  and  registration  agencies,  land  commissions,\nand  land  courts  are  funded  through  state  budgets.  In  FY2000,  the  agencies  combined  were\nallocated a total of $0.94 million, of which 90.6 percent was for salaries and 9.4 percent was for\nnonpersonnel  recurrent  costs.  This  level  of  expenditure  covers  two  to  three  adjudication  and\nsurvey  teams  per  state  and  agency  support  staff,  but  is  insufficient  for  the  high  nonsalary\nrecurrent  costs  of  fieldwork,  especially  in  the  dispersed  outer  islands  of  Chuuk,  Pohnpei,  and\nYap.\n\n41.\nDevelopment Banking. The FSM Congress appropriated $1.5 million in 1998 and $1.0\nmillion  in  1999  for  capital  increases  of  the  FSM  Development  Bank  (FSMDB)  bringing  total\nequity up to $29.5 million. FSMDB also administers, in a trustee capacity, three separate funds\nwith  combined  assets  of  $16.1  million  at  the  end  of  1999.  The  most  important  of  these  is  the\nInvestment Development Fund which aims to promote large-scale local economic development\nprojects  through  joint  FSM-US  investment  partnership  arrangements.  The  FSMDB\u2019s  budget\ndemonstrates that it can potentially increase its lending portfolio over 3 to 4 years by $10 million\nto over $30 million, without any further injection of capital funds. With FSMDB\u2019s large investment\nreserves, no additional equity funds are currently needed.\n\n42.\nBusiness  Development  Support.  The  UNDP/United  Nations  Industrial  Development\nOrganization  (UNIDO)-supported  Micronesian  Entrepreneur  Development  Center  (MEDC)\nproject started in 1993 in Pohnpei. Since the start of the MEDC Phase II program in 1996, the\nnational  Government,  through  appropriations  obtained  from  the  FSM  Congress,  has  directly\ncontributed to the budget of the MEDC program. The total contribution of the FSM Government\nwas  $0.55  million  during  the  last  five  fiscal  years  (1996/2000).  In  addition,  state  governments\nprovide in-kind and budgetary contributions for center operations including office facilities, staff\nsalaries, and other operation and maintenance costs.\n\nE.\n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy\n\n43.\nThe  change  in  government  policy  from  public  sector-led  growth  to  private  sector-led\ngrowth,  initiated  through  the  PSRP,  represents  a  fundamental  shift  in  strategy  for  the  FSM.\nPolicy  initiatives  under way include  restraining government employment and wages, reforming\npublic  enterprises,  promoting  foreign  investment,  liberalizing  banking  regulations,  improving\nleaseholds,  and  improving  business  support.  However,  the  Government  is  also  realizing  the\ncomplexities  of  these  initiatives  and  what  is  involved  in  the  shift  from  government-led\ndevelopment to a private sector-led approach. Hurdles include the process of developing public\nunderstanding;  refining  policies  and  strategies;  gaining  acceptance;  passing  laws;  and  most\nimportantly,  effectively  implementing  agreed  programs.  The  Second  FSM  Economic  Summit\nprovided  an  opportunity  to  discuss  and  develop  specific  policies,  strategies,  and  activities  to\nsupport private sector development. The results are detailed in the private sector development\npolicy matrix, which comprises five key elements.\n\n44.\nThe first element focuses on commitment to economic reforms by maintaining financial\nstability.  Implementation  strategies  include  maintaining  balanced  budgets  and  a  low  level  of\nexternal  debt  by  avoiding  net  increase  in  public  service  employment  levels;  developing  and\nenforcing  effective  conflict  of  interest  laws;  balancing  tax  increases  with  corresponding\ngovernment  expenditure  reductions,  and  elimination  of  inefficiencies  and  misallocations;\nremoving  distortions  of  the  current  tax  regimes;  and  establishing  medium-term  revenue\nneutrality (no increase in tax burden).\n\n\f14\n\nThe  second  policy  element  aims  to  develop  an  outward  looking  approach  to  economic\n45.\ndevelopment  by  developing  a  tax  regime  consistent  with  outward-oriented  economic  strategy,\nand eliminating distortions arising from the current tax system; and encouraging investment in\npriority  and  potentially  competitive  export  growth  industries.  Strategies  include  creating  an\nattractive environment for investors by developing transparent laws and regulations supportive\nof investors; and promoting investment in priority industries, especially exports.\n\n46.\nThe  third  policy  element  emphasizes  lowering  costs,  improving  performance,  and\ndeveloping competitive markets for resources. Policies and strategies for land, labor, and capital\ninclude the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nLabor  policies.  Ensure  labor  is  wage  competitive  by  reducing  public-private\nsector  wage  differentials,  increase  labor  productivity  and  competitiveness,  and\ndirect  human  resource  development  investment  to  skill  gaps  for  priority  growth\nindustries.\n\nLand  policies.  Make  land  more  readily  available  to  those  who  need  it  for\ndevelopment,  facilitate  the  use  of  land  as  collateral  to  increase  availability  of\ndevelopment financing, regulate land use to promote desirable and more efficient\nindustry clusters, and avoid incompatible and unsustainable uses.\n\nFinance policies. Reduce the risks of bank lending and borrowing for domestic\nbusiness  and  exports,  reduce  disincentives  arising  from  the  risks  of  business\nlosses  for  unrecoverable  debt,  broaden  the  quality  and  scope  of  bank  financial\nservices and products, and build responsiveness to the working and investment\ncapital needs for business development in priority industries.\n\n47.\nThe fourth policy element emphasizes reorienting public agencies and administration to\nfacilitate  private  sector  development,  decreasing  the  cost  and  increasing  the  ease  of  doing\nbusiness, promoting good governance, and minimizing government involvement in commercial\nand service activity. Two main areas are covered:\n\nRegulatory  environment.  Develop  a  corporate  and  business  enabling  and\nregulatory  environment  that  promotes  a  private  sector  capable  of  generating\nlong-term economic value and respects the interests of stakeholders and society.\n\nCommercialization and business development support.  Support  competitive\ntradable  goods  and  services;  focus  on  efficient,  coordinating,  support  services\nproviding  information,  advice,  and  training,  not  subsidized  finance;  support\nbusiness development at all levels experience and growth; and allow the market\nto determine  the  value and commercial viability of state-owned, production-type\nenterprises earmarked for privatization.\n\n48.\nThe fifth policy element comprises providing efficient and cost-effective infrastructure to\nsupport  competitive  private  sector  development  by  removing  infrastructure-related  production\nconstraints  through  feasible  public  investments,  adequate  operation  and  maintenance,  and\nensuring  coordination  in  the  provision  of  social  service  infrastructure  to  support  economic  and\nprivate sector development.\n\n49.\nThe impetus for the private sector development policies emerged from the Government\u2019s\nrecognition that proactive steps are needed to promote private sector-led growth, especially in\n\n\f15\n\nview of the sector's slow response to public sector downsizing. The participants of the Second\nFSM Economic Summit noted that while much progress had been made since the First Summit\nin  1995,  more  active,  coherent  policy  monitoring  and  implementation  is  definitely  needed\nthroughout the FSM. Therefore, the membership of the State-National Leadership Conferences\nwas  formalized  as  the  FSM  Economic  Policy  Implementation  Council  (EPIC).  With  a  goal  of\nimproving  economic  policy  monitoring  and  implementation  support,  EPIC  will  comprise\nexecutive  and  legislative  leaders  from  the  national  and  state  governments.  DEA  acts  as  the\nEPIC secretariat. Policy-focused meetings will be convened at least every May and October in\nconjunction  with  regular  session  of  the  FSM  Congress.  The  PSDP  and  its  implementation\nshould integrate with these newly instituted mechanisms and structures.\n\nF.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n50.\nThe US Compact assistance is a major influence in the FSM economy. The assistance\nprovided through the Compact includes a block grant of which no less than 40 percent must be\nallocated to capital improvement projects. In addition, goods with a domestic value added of 30\npercent  or  more  are  eligible  for  duty-free  access  to  the  US  with  the  exception  of  canned  tuna\nand certain products for the garment industry. In addition, the FSM receives no-cost assistance\nfor  weather  services,  emergency  management,  and  aviation  administration  from  US  agencies.\nThe US Congress also agreed to provide the FSM with access to services and programs of the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Small Business Administration, Economic Development\nAdministration, and Job Partnership Training Act, among others. The US Department of Interior,\nthrough additional federal grant programs available to the FSM, has also provided assistance to\nthe Pohnpei Division of Lands to automate the surveying and mapping functions to speed up the\nprocesses of cadastral surveying and mapping. The US Peace Corps provides volunteers to a\nwide range of sectors, including education, agriculture, and commerce and industry.\n\n51.\nJapan  provides  an  assistance  package  each  year  to  the  four  FSM  states  and  the\nnational Government on a rotating basis, usually for infrastructure and fisheries projects. A small\ngrant  fund  is  also  administered  by  the  Japanese  Embassy  that  targets  community  self-help\nactivities  and  other  small-scale  development  projects.  Since  1995,  the  embassy  has  awarded\napproximately  $10  million  to  small  projects.  A  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  TA\ncommenced  in  August  2000  to  restart  the  former  Micronesia  Maritime  Academy  in  Yap  in\ncooperation  with  the  College  of  Micronesia-FSM.  Each  year,  approximately  20  Micronesians\nfrom  the  government  and  private  sector  are  funded  for  Japan-based  training  in  social,\neconomic, and business-related areas.\n\n52.\nUNDP  has  had  an  active  program  in  the  FSM  since  its  independence.  In  the  past,  the\nprogram included extensive support to agriculture (pepper, poultry, veterinary services, and crop\nprotection).  This  type  of  assistance  to  specific  enterprises  has  been  curtailed  due  to  lack  of\nfunding.  The  UNDP/UNIDO  assistance  to  the  SME  sector  has  expanded  successfully  from  a\nproject piloted in Pohnpei State executed by UNIDO to the establishment of the MEDCs.\n\n53.\nAustralia  provides  assistance  in  the  area  of  land  administration  for  developing\ngeographic  information  systems  in  Kosrae  and  Pohnpei.  The  Australian  Government  has\nprovided a small grant to the Pohnpei MEDC to conduct training in business extension services\nto rural entrepreneurs. Experienced senior volunteers have offered a variety of training related\nto business and business management to public agencies and the private sector.\n\n54.\nThe  World  Bank  provides  assistance  to  the  FSM  through  its  regional  programs.  The\nForeign  Investment  Advisory  Service,  cofinanced  by  the  World  Bank  and  ADB,  has  been\n\n\f16\n\nproviding  advisory  services  throughout  the  review  and  revision  process  for  the  FSM\u2019s  foreign\ninvestment laws and regulations. Direct assistance is being provided through the South Pacific\nProject  Facility  to  the  FSM\u2019s  private  sector  fisheries  businesses.  ADB  TA  has  assisted  a\nPohnpei-based  longliner  company  in  operations  management  and  the  Pohnpei  Longline\nFisheries Association in assessing alternative air freight arrangements.\n\n55.\nThe  Pacific  Islands  Small  Business  Development  Centers  Network,  based  in  Guam,\nprovides  assistance  and  an  annual  grant  of  $30,000  to  the  Yap  SBDC.  The  Pacific  Business\nCenter of the University of Hawaii continues to provide advisory services to the government and\nbusinesses  in  the  states  of  Chuuk  and  Yap.  Even  though  the  connections  and  networks  from\nthe two programs have proven valuable, their visits are limited to four times a year for about two\nweeks per visit.\n\nG.\n\nADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n\n1. \n\nStrategy\n\n56.\nADB\u2019s country operational strategy reflects the Government\u2019s own development strategy\naimed  at  implementing  the  economic  reforms  presented  to  the  Fourth  Consultative  Group\nMeeting.  ADB\u2019s  current  strategy  focuses  on  public  sector  rationalization  and  private  sector\ndevelopment  through  key  reforms  to  land,  labor,  and  capital  market  institutions.  This  strategy\nwas  confirmed  by  the  national  and  state  governments  as  well  as  by  the  private  sector  and\nNGOs.  Given  the  federal  government  structure  in  the  FSM,  ADB  operations  give  increased\nattention to individual states\u2019 development needs and is strongly linked with their performance\nand commitment to reform.\n\n2. \n\nOperations\n\nADB loans have been approved for the PSRP, a water supply and sanitation project, and\n57.\na  fisheries  development  project.  While  the  overall  objective  of  the  PSRP  was  to  achieve\nsustainable  economic  growth  through  private  sector  development,  the  focus  during  program\nimplementation was placed on the fiscal adjustment and downsizing of governments rather than\nthe  medium-  to  long-term  goal  of  establishing  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector\ndevelopment. The ADB project for fisheries development experienced mixed performance due\nto the lack of a favorable sector policy and governance environment.\n\nADB  TAs  have  focused  on  good  governance  and  capacity  building.  To  improve  the\n58.\ngovernance and institutional capacity for private sector development, a TA was provided in the\nareas  of  economic  policy  formulation,  performance-based  budgeting,  public  sector  enterprise\nreform, land management, financial sector review, and fisheries management.18\n\n59.\nLessons learned from ADB operations in the sector include (i) ADB\u2019s projects need to be\nconsistent  with  individual  state  needs  and  performance,  including  their  commitment  to  reform;\n(ii)  to  create  a  policy  and  legal  environment  that  is  more  business  friendly,  reforms  should\n\n                  \n\n18 TA 2786: Investment Promotion and Financial Sector Review, for $380,000, approved on 8 April 1997; TA 2832:\nFisheries Management and Development, for $934,000, approved on 2 July 1997; TA 2983: Performance-Based\nPublic Resource Allocation, for $988,000, approved on 26 January 1998; TA 3024: Economic Policy Reform and\nManagement,  for  $2,877,000,  approved  on  12  May  1998;  TA  3201:  Privatization of Public Enterprises and\nCorporate Governance,  for  $450,000,  approved  on  9  June  1999;  and  TA  3258:  Strengthening the National\nStatistical System, for $400,000, approved on 21 September 1999.\n\n\f17\n\nprecede ADB\u2019s investments in revenue-generating sectors; and (iii) weak local capacity should\nbe taken into consideration in preparing projects.\n\n3. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n60.\nADB  is  assisting  the  Government  to  develop  and  implement  its  continued  economic\nreforms aimed at private sector-led growth. As a result of continued policy dialogue with ADB,\nthe national Government has identified private sector development as the primary development\ngoal and developed future policy actions and implementation mechanisms through the Second\nFSM  Economic  Summit  in  1999.  Subsequently,  the  PSDP  (2000)  and  TA  3278  (footnote  1)\nwere reflected in the ADB country assistance program 2000/02. To avoid risk of duplication and\nmaximize  ADB  resources  available  for  the  FSM,  ADB  coordinated  its  ongoing  TAs  whose\noutputs have strong links with those of the TA for the PSDP. These include TAs for economic\npolicy management, improved use of land, public enterprise reform and corporate governance,\nfinancial  sector  review,  and  national  statistics  strengthening.  UNDP  also  participated  in  the\nGovernment\u2019s formulation of PSDP through the involvement of MEDC staff and consultants.\n\n61.\nDuring TA 3278 implementation, the fourth Consultative Group Meeting was held at ADB\nheadquarters in February 2000. The FSM Government demonstrated its willingness to stay the\ncourse of reforms and to adopt a concrete policy framework to implement the reforms. ADB and\nother development partners commended the Government\u2019s development strategy for achieving\na self-reliant economy through private sector development.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n62.\nThe  FSM's  major  challenge  is  to  accelerate  private  sector  development  as  the  main\nengine  of  growth,  particularly  in  the  productive  sectors  (fisheries,  agriculture,  and  tourism),\nwhich  are  to  provide  alternative  sources  of  foreign  exchange  to  reduce  the  country's\ndependence  on  external  assistance  as  well  as  generate  employment  for  the  rapidly  growing\npopulation.  The  proposed  PSDP  is  to  assist  the  Government  in  implementing  its  economic\ndevelopment  strategy  for  private  sector-led  economic  growth.  Preparation  of  the  Program\ninvolved a high level of public discussion and participation.\n\n63.\nThe  PSDP  will  seek  to  induce  an  increase  in  the  production  of  tradable  goods  for\ndomestic  and  export  markets,  as  well  as  a  competitive  nontradable  service  sector.\nImprovements  in  access  to  and  the  use  of  land  for  economic  activity  is  required,  including\naccelerated titling and registration, extended lease terms, and the ability to use land and other\nproperty as collateral to access finance for business development. Access to capital and finance\nfor  business  development  can  be  enhanced  by  improving  the  enabling  legal  framework  and\nfinancial  services  for  start-up  and  expansion  of  SMEs.  A  price-competitive  labor  force  is\nrequired with the skills needed by the private sector. Finally, while the choice of business activity\nis  entirely  a  matter  for  the  private  sector,  advisory  support  is  needed  for  informal  and  formal\nSMEs  to  develop  private  sector  distribution  channels,  assist  with  product  diversification  and\nprovision  of  market  information,  change  product  positioning  to  fit  consumer  demand,  improve\nthe  stability  and  reliability  of  supply,  improve  communication,  develop  price  competitiveness,\nand assist in focusing on core competencies through a better matching of internal and external\nfactors.\n\n\fB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n18\n\n64.\nThe  goal  of  the  PSDP  is  to  promote  economic  growth  by  expanding  the  FSM  private\nsector,  thereby  raising  domestic  employment  and  incomes,  and  reducing  dependence  on\nexternal assistance. To attain this goal, the PSDP's objectives are to (i) improve the policy and\nlegal environment for private sector development; and (ii) strengthen capacity to manage land,\nlabor, and capital resources.\n\nThe PSDP's scope is national and statewide. The PSDP includes (i) a policy framework\n65.\nand actions and (ii) an investment project aimed at improving performance of the public services\nto  promote  private  sector  development.  The  investment  project  comprises  (i)  establishing  a\nsecured  transaction  system;  (ii)  providing  institutional  capacity  building  for  land  administration\nand  management,  financial  support  to  SMEs,  and  business  development  support;  and  (iii)\nstrengthening  the  capacity  for  coordinating  and  monitoring  the  PSDP.  The  investment  project\ndescription is attached as Supplementary Appendix A.\n\nC. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\n66.\nThe PSDP is built on consensus generated at the Second Economic Summit and local\ncommitment to the overall reform effort. A policy matrix was developed by translating the policy\nframework for private sector development endorsed at the Summit. To maximize the impact of\nthe reforms, policy actions and the time frame in the policy matrix reflects key factors including\n(i)  differences  in  each  state\u2019s  financial  and  legal  situation,  (ii)  local  acceptance  of  reforms\nincluding land-related reforms, (iii) local implementation capacity, and (iv) availability of current\nand  future  external  resources  to  support  the  reform  measures.  Quantifiable  and  monitorable\ntargets have been identified and are integrated into the program framework in Appendix 1. The\ndevelopment policy letter and policy matrix are in appendixes 2 and 3.\n\n1. \n\nMaintain Economic and Public Sector Reforms\n\na. \n\nMaintenance of Balanced Budgets\n\nIn  general,  the  expansionist  fiscal  policies  in  the  FSM  national  and  state  governments\n67.\nprior to FY1996 led to a more difficult and painful adjustment process following the second step-\ndown  in  Compact  funding.  However,  in  facing  up  to  the  necessary  adjustments  to  declining\ntransfers, the response has been positive, with small budget surpluses in FY1998 and FY1999.\nRecent  efforts  and  successes  in  improving  fiscal  management  and  discipline  must  be\nmaintained, and where possible, extended to avoid previous public financial crises that affected\nthe  delivery  of  essential  public  services  and  private  sector  growth.  Over  time,  faster  private\nsector growth should be encouraged, and the ratio of government expenditure to GDP allowed\nto  fall  to  less  than  50  percent  of  GDP.  Fiscal  discipline  and  financial  stability  are  required  to\nimprove business and investor confidence in the FSM economy. The governments are therefore\ncommitted to maintaining balanced budgets for FY2002/04 on total current revenues and grants\nless current expenditures.\n\nb. \n\nMaintenance of Government Payroll Levels and Reduction of Public\nto Private Sector Wage Differentials\n\nAn  important  component  of  the  PSRP  was  reducing  government  size  and  operating\n68.\ncosts. However, the emphasis has changed. In certain states, the reductions are continuing with\nthe  intention  of  restructuring  the  civil  service  to  be  smaller,  but  staffed  with  better-qualified\n\n\f19\n\npersonnel.  The  reduction  of  government  employment  is  an  important  step  in  reducing  labor\nmarket competition between government and the private sector, and increasing the availability\nof  skilled  and  qualified  labor.  Limiting  the  size  of  government  by  avoiding  a  net  increase  in\npublic  service  payrolls  will  ensure  that  the  size  of  the  civil  service  does  not  become  an\nunsustainable financial burden or a source of competition for labor with the private sector. Pay\nrestraints are important to remove pay differentials; the public to private sector ratio is currently\n1:8. Payroll ceilings consistent with medium-term fiscal balance for FY2002 will be set at a level\nthat  does  not  exceed  the  PSRP  FY1999  target  for  the  ratio  of  wages  to  total  expenditures  for\neach national and state government. In FY2003 and FY2004 these ceilings will be maintained\nwith small upward adjustments.\n\nc. \n\nSound Management of the FSM Trust Fund\n\n69.\nIn 1999, the FSM began negotiations with the US for a new package of assistance once\nthe  current  package  expires  in  2001.  In  essence,  future  Compact  payments  are  expected  to\ncover not only agreed areas of assistance, but also regular payments into the FSM Trust Fund\nto ensure a self-sustaining stream of revenue for government operations after a possible second\nCompact agreement expires. A law for establishing the FSM Trust Fund was enacted, and the\nnational Government has appropriated $4 million to date. A prudent measure is to increase the\ncommitment to the future financial stability of the FSM by increasing savings and investment in\nthe FSM Trust Fund. If the current Compact agreement is extended for two years, at least half\nof  the  27.5  percent  increase  of  budgetary  support  under  the  Compact  base  grant  for  FY2002\nand FY2003 will be placed into the FSM Trust Fund. This would avoid a short-term reexpansion\nof public spending and contribute to the FSM's future financial independence.\n\nd. \n\nSound Management of External Debt\n\n70.\nPrior  to  FY1990,  the  FSM  had  no  official  public  debt  to  offshore  lenders.  Between\nFY1990 and FY1993, total official external debt increased to a peak of $137 million in FY1993\nrepresenting 66 percent of GDP. Since FY1993, the only official debt has been through ADB\u2019s\nconcessional  lending  facility.  While  the  situation  was  adverse  in  the  early  1990s,  it  will  be\nsustainable  by  2002  following  completion  of  payment  of  a  medium-term  note  program.  By\nFY2001, the debt to GDP ratio is expected to be 24 percent. While this situation appears to be\nrelatively good, the uncertainties over Compact renegotiations and future debt service capacity\nare  still  cause  for  caution  and  for  avoiding  resurgence  of  unsustainable  external  debt.  The\ncurrent  policy  is  to  maintain  a  low  and  sustainable  level  of  net  external  debt.  Accordingly,  the\nGovernment  has  committed  that  the  debt-to-GDP  ratio  will  not  exceed  24  percent  in  FY2002;\nthis ratio will be maintained during FY2003 and FY2004.\n\ne. \n\nProgress in Public Sector Enterprise Reforms\n\n71.\nVigorous implementation of public sector enterprise (PSE) reforms is required to reduce\nthe  government  budgetary  burden  of  nonperforming  PSEs  and  eliminate  public  sector\ncompetition with the private sector. The three-year phased ADB TA (footnote 13) of which the\nfirst  phase  was  implemented  in  2000,  facilitated  the  development  of  a  framework  for  and\nimplementation of PSE reforms. The Public Enterprise Unit was established in DEA in 2000 to\nmanage  the  process.  To  fulfill  the  policy  of  reducing  losses,  increasing  private  sector\nopportunities,  and  eliminating  public  sector  competition  with  the  private  sector,  the  five\ngovernments will identify priority enterprises to be privatized and set specific national and state\ntargets.  Preliminary  candidate  public  enterprises  for  privatization  were  identified  in  September\n2000  through  a  participatory  process  with  government  and  other  stakeholders.  Following  this,\n\n\f20\n\ndraft master plans for PSE reforms were completed during this year. At least one PSE reform by\neach national and state government will be implemented by August 2003.\n\n2. \n\nImprove the Legal Environment for Private Sector Development\n\na. \n\nPass Laws to Improve Use of Land and Property as Loan Security\n\n72.\nThe FSM is addressing a number of issues in the legal and regulatory environment by\nextending  minimum  lease  terms  and  improving  access  to  finance  through  leasehold  mortgage\nlending. The long-term, land-lease system will make land more readily available without having\nto  amend  constitutions.  Effective  security  mechanisms  using  leasehold  mortgages  will  help\navoid many of the freehold mortgage problems by making foreclosure a less daunting prospect.\nAn  ADB  TA  for  improved  use  of  land  has  proposed  model  state  legislation  and  forms  for\ndeveloping  a  system  of  long-term  land  leasing  and  leasehold  mortgaging.  Wide  public\nawareness campaigns on modernizing the land market were completed in 2000 by a local NGO\nunder the TA. The legal reforms to enable the improved use of land (footnote 14) and property\nas  loan  security  include  (i)  amendment  of  state  land-lease  laws,  and  (ii)  passage  of  state\nmortgage laws. Long-term, land-lease legislation will be drafted by November 2001 and enacted\nby  August  2003.  At  the  end  of  the  program,  a  secured  transaction  system  will  be  established\nunder  the  investment  Project  to  enable  banks  to  increase  mortgage-secured  commercial\nlending.\n\nb. \n\nImprove Foreign Direct Investment Laws and Regulations\n\nIn May 2000, the governments reviewed the current foreign direct investment laws with\n73.\nthe assistance of experts funded by the Foreign Investment Advisory Service and ADB. Specific\nrecommendations  have  been  made  for  new  foreign  direct  investment  systems  with  improved\ntransparency  and  consistency  in  the  national  and  state  governments.  A  core  objective  is  to\nsimplify the application procedures and reduce discretionary reviews and approvals. Revised and\nimproved foreign investment laws and regulations will be put into effect by August 2003.\n\n3. \n\nAdjustment Costs of the Reforms\n\n74.\nPublic  enterprise  reform  will  result  in  several  costs,  including  possible  redundancy\npayments; loss of earnings to displaced workers during the transition to the private sector; and\nother  restructuring,  divestiture,  and  liquidation  expenses.  In  FY1998,  public  enterprise  wages\nwere $10.3 million. The workforce reduction under the proposed PSE reforms was estimated at\n10  percent  of  the  total  PSE  workforce.  A  redundancy  payment  of  two  years  for  released\nworkers, which was applied to early retirees under the PSRP, will require about $1.5 million in\n2003. Retraining costs through the existing vocational training programs are estimated at $2.0\nmillion. Administrative and legal expenses for PSE reform are estimated at $1.5 million. These\ncosts will be partly offset by reducing subsidies to loss-making enterprises.\n\n75.\nThe proposed policy loan will help finance the total adjustment costs estimated at $5.0\nmillion,  while  maintaining  fiscal  discipline  by  keeping  Government  expenditures  in  line  with\nrevenues. The costs of improving the institutional infrastructure for private sector development\nwill be met through the investment Project.\n\n\fD. \n\nThe Investment Project\n\n21\n\n76.\nStrengthening  the  institutional  infrastructure  of  the  national  and  state  agencies  is\nrequired  to  improve  the  environment  for  private  sector  development.  The  investment  Project\ncomprises  three  components:  component  A,  establishment  of  a  secured  transactions  system;\ncomponent  B,  strengthening  of  institutional  capacity  to  support  PSD  including  state  land\nadministration, FSMDB, and state MECs; and component C, program and project management.\n\n1. \n\nEstablishment of a Secured Transactions System\n\nthe  national  and  state  governments \n\n77.\nThe  first  component  is  to  establish  a  secured  transaction  system  through  secured\ntransactions  laws  and  chattel  mortgage  registries  in  the  national  and  state  governments.  The\nexisting state and national government secured transaction laws will be reviewed. To resolve a\njurisdictional  problem  between \nthis  area,  a\ncomprehensive  national  secured  transaction  law  is  proposed  that  will  override  state  laws;\nhowever, a state can still have its own secured transaction law. Once a mortgage is filed in a\nstate  under  a  state  law,  it  can  also  qualify  under  national  law.  Under  the  proposed  bill  at  the\nnational  Congress,  a  single  nationwide  system  will  be  set  up  with  offices  in  each  state  where\nfilings can be made and searches obtained. The computerized chattel mortgage registry will be\nestablished  within  state  land  administration  and  the  registrar\u2019s  office  in  Palikir.  A  significant\nnumber  of  additional  staff  are  not  required  within  the  registries;  however,  hardware  will  be\nsupplied  and  installed,  software  provided,  and  training  given  to  establish  a  central  electronic\ndata bank for secured transactions filings, with real-time links to each of the state field offices.\nThis  will  take  the  form  of  a  web  site  in  which  concerned  persons  including  bankers,  and\nattorneys, and the field offices can search for filings against a certain debtor.\n\nin \n\n2. \n\nStrengthening  of \nDevelopment\n\nInstitutional  Capacity \n\nto  Support  Private  Sector\n\nThe second component aims to strengthen the institutional capacity of the national and\n\n78.\nstate agencies providing essential services to support private business development.\n\na. \n\nLand Administration and Management\n\n79.\nThis subcomponent aims to (i) promote the modernization and development of the land\nregistration  and  cadastral  systems;  (ii)  expedite  the  issuance  of  land  titles  by  improving\nprocedures for adjudication, survey, and registration; (iii) support state initiatives to develop an\nappropriate  judicial  framework  related  to  land  dispute  resolution;  (iv)  support  appropriate\nsystems for zoning and land use planning; and, (v) develop land valuation methodologies and\ntrain officials from each of the states in the valuation methodology.\n\n80.\nThe  investment  will  provide  for  three  inputs.  (i)  Civil  works:  the  construction  of  new,\npurpose-built  offices  for  the  land  agencies  in  Chuuk,  Kosrae,  and  Yap  to  provide  secure\ntemperature  and  humidity-controlled  vaults  for  records,  temperature-controlled  computing\nrooms,  and  a  secure  public  access  area.  In  Pohnpei,  the  existing  building  housing  the  Land\nTenure Court will be renovated to provide a secure, temperature and humidity controlled vault\nfor records and to rewire the building. (ii) Equipment: modern survey equipment will be provided\nto automate the survey and mapping functions (global positioning system receivers, total station\ntheodolites, and computer hardware and software); Pohnpei's experience with US doIlar funding\nshows that productivity can be at least doubled, while other countries have found that significant\ncost  reductions  can  be  achieved  and  new  and  simplified  practices  and  methods  introduced  to\n\n\f22\n\nreduce cost per land parcel survey from $550 per parcel to $30 per parcel). The new technology\ncombined  with  the  implementation  of  new  practices  and  methods  will  achieve  corresponding\nreductions in time. New technology (computer hardware and software) will also be introduced to\nautomate the registration activities to speed up the issuance of titles and reduce the possibility\nfor  fraud  and  corruption.  The  automated  survey  and  registration  systems  will  be  integrated  to\nproduce time  and cost savings. (iii) Consulting services and training: these will be provided to\nstrengthen  the  institutional,  administrative  aspects  of  the  land-titling  process,  including  in\nparticular,  in  Chuuk  and  Yap,  new  and  simplified  adjudication  (land  dispute  settlement\nprocedures). The survey and mapping consulting will include a course in survey and mapping to\ncreate a cadre of licensed surveyors to enable the ultimate privatization of these functions, with\nparticular emphasis on the privatization of the survey and mapping functions in Pohnpei State\nduring  project  implementation;  legal  consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  amend  existing\nlegislation, as appropriate. All states will benefit from the proposed valuation consulting, which\nwill  develop  a  valuation  methodology  and  train  state  representatives  in  valuation  to  ensure  an\nequitable  and  transparent  valuation  service.  Finally,  this  subcomponent  will  help  Pohnpei\nimplement a simplified land use master plan and implement a geographic information system to\nmonitor its implementation.\n\nb. \n\nFinancial Services to SMEs\n\n81. While  commercial  bank  lending  will  be  encouraged  by  developing  enabling  mortgage\nlegislation,  development  banking  services  for  SMEs  will  be  improved  through  an  integrated\nprogram  of  technical  and  in-service  training  assistance  for  FSMDB.  This  program  will\ncommence  with  a  program  of  training  and  support  to  FSMDB\u2019s  board  on  governance  issues,\nroles,  and  duties.  Under  a  new  corporate  plan,19  FSMDB  will  focus  on  business  promotion,\ncustomer  service,  financial  sustainability,  and  development  of  human  resources.  FSMDB  will\ndevelop the existing management by objectives system with each state branch setting lending,\ncollection,  and  profit  objectives.  FSMDB  will  increase  branch-level  authority  in  response  to\nincreased  capacity  and  to  overcome  the  past  constraints  of  centralized  decision  making.\nSpecific  attention  will  be  given  to  developing  FSMDB's  new  outreach  program,  which  will  be\nespecially important for delivering effective financial services to start-ups and small business. A\nskills  audit  will  assess  the  training  needs  of  individuals  relative  to  their  job  descriptions  and  a\ncomprehensive training program will be developed. A long-term integrated program for capacity\nbuilding,  including  the  full-time  attachment  of  a  senior  development  banking  adviser,  and\ntraining and advice by short-term experts in the fields of information and computer systems and\nhuman resource development will be provided.\n\nc. \n\nSmall Business Development Services\n\n82.\nThe  MEDCs  will  be  strengthened  to  provide  a  comprehensive  small  business  support\nservice,  improved  delivery  of  skills  training,  and  a  labor  market  information  system.  The\nstrengthened  MEDCs  will  be  renamed  small  business  development  centers  (SBDCs)  and  will\nalso  expand  their  outreach  business  extension  services  to  the  informal  sector,  outer  islands,\nwomen  and  youth,  and  targeted  priority  sectors.  This  will  require  the  delivery  of  business\ntraining  and  advisory  services  that  closely  consider  factors  such  as  the  current  level  of\ncommercialization,  business  development,  and  educational  attainment  of  beneficiaries.  The\nlarger states of Chuuk and Pohnpei will require more business trainers and advisers, some of\nwhich may be on a part-time or request basis. Information technology will be enhanced through\n\n19 The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific provided assistance for the preparation of a revised\n\n                  \n\ncorporate plan in 2000.\n\n\f23\n\nan Internet-based business and technical information service that will link the four state SBDCs\nto DEA and appropriate information worldwide. This information system is expected to be simple\nbut  consistent  with  the  needs  of  businesses  in  the  FSM.  Information  on  labor  demand  and\nsupply  will  be  included  so  that  those  seeking  workers  and  those  seeking  employment  will  be\nserved  by  the  information  system.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  for  training  business\ncenter  staff,  developing  the  labor  market  information  system,  establishing  the  required\nprocedures, and updating the necessary training materials. Supported by the new business and\nlabor market information system, the business adviser in each SBDC will identify new training\nneeds and provide advisory support for established and emerging businesses. New buildings for\nthe SBDCs in Chuuk, Kosrae, and Pohnpei will be constructed within the state campuses of the\nCollege of Micronesia (COM)-FSM. In each of these states, the facilities to be constructed will\nbe joint-use buildings, which will also accommodate the vocational training programs of COM.\nThe training and counseling facilities of the Yap Business Center will be upgraded. The center\ncurrently operates as an incubator system.\n\n83.\nTo ensure access to the best possible advice and secure the input of the private sector,\nthe  SBDC  will  be  advised  in  each  state  by  a  business  development  council  (BDC),  which  will\nhave  representatives  from  the  private  sector,  banks,  COM,  NGOs,  and  the  state  government,\nand will replace the current MEDC board. The SBDC\u2019s legal status will be converted to a state\nnonprofit corporation to improve transparency and performance of its business support services.\nThe  BDCs  will  be  managed  by  state  COM  campuses  (except  in  Yap).  The  national\nGovernment\u2019s  current  budget  support  will  be  maintained  through  the  COM-FSM  budget  to  the\nstate  campuses,  except in Yap where it will be channeled through the state government. This\nnew  structure  and  other  modifications  have  been  included  in  the  proposed  business\ndevelopment act for the states. Linkages between the SBDCs and FSMDB will be enhanced to\nensure  that  the  outreach  services  of  the  two  institutions,  including  staff  capabilities,  are\ncompatible  and  consistent.  Annually,  the  BDC  will  review  the  delivery  of  SBDC  services  and\ndevelopment of private sector services to ensure that the centers are not providing competing\nservices  or  undermining  the  development  of  private  sector  business  support  services.  In  this\nregard, the SBDCs will be encouraged to provide training-of-trainers to existing nongovernment\nbusiness organizations, and introduce and increase user fees as appropriate.\n\n3. \n\nProgram and Project Management (Component C)\n\n84.\nA program-project implementation unit (PIU) will be established within DEA. Despite the\nfact  that  DEA  has  served  as  the  implementing  agency  for  various  ADB  project  and  program\nloans,  its  capacity  for  effective  policy  implementation  and  coordination  requires  strengthening.\nThis is considered necessary, as part of the restructuring and rebuilding of DEA\u2019s capacity for\nimplementation and service support to the FSM states under the ongoing public sector reform\nefforts. Equivalent procedures and capacity building will be needed at the state level. A project\norganization chart is attached as Appendix 4.\n\n85.\nFor the first three years, an internationally recruited program-project manager (PPM) will\nbe responsible for the day-to-day implementation of the PSDP. A counterpart manager will be\ntrained  to  take  over  in  year  four.  The  involvement  of  the  expatriate  PPM  (total  duration  of  24\nperson-months) will be gradually phased out over the three years. The PPM will be expected to\n(i)  design  disbursement,  procurement,  and  recruitment  procedures  and  guidelines  under  the\nPSDP;  (ii)  develop  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems;  (iii)  facilitate  the  national  and  state\nsteering  committees  in  four  states;  (iv)  help  DEA  and  the  steering  committees  publicize  the\nimprovements and changes under the PSDP, and (v) train PIU counterpart staff and the state\ncounterpart  staff  from  each  agency  assigned  to  manage  program  and  project  implementation.\n\n\f24\n\nThe  PIU  will  interact  with  the  state  governors'  offices,  which  will  coordinate  the  program  and\nproject activities and investments at the state level.\n\n4. \n\nFees for Services\n\n86.\nNo  land  office  currently  charges  for  land  survey  services;  although  citizens  have\nindicated their willingness to pay to expedite the survey. Under the Project, the fee for service\nconcept for activities carried out by the land administration agencies will be introduced. These\nactivities include issuance of land titles, land transactions, and information requests associated\nwith leasing and mortgaging. The immediate goal of the fees will not be full cost recovery, but\nrather, establishing the fee for service principle. Nominal charges will be introduced during the\ncourse  of  component  implementation  for  certain  activities  associated  with  first  registration\nactivities, e.g., expedited registration, while full charges will be levied for secondary transactions\nin land rights, such as leases and the recording and registering of mortgages. Such subsidies\nare  justified  as  part  of  the  modernization  process.  Nonetheless  as  the  improved  land\nadministration systems become established, fee structures for land titling will be reviewed with a\nview to increasing cost recovery for the systems.\n\n87.\nThe newly established SBDC will apply fee for service to training and advisory services.\nAs  with  the  land  administration  services,  the  immediate  goal  of  the  fees  will  not  be  full  cost\nrecovery, but rather establishing the fee for service principle. In addition to direct appropriations\nfrom  government,  various  other  grant  sources  from  external  financers  may  be  explored  to\nfinance the operation and investment requirements of the SBDCs.\n\n5. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n88.\nThe  total  cost  of  the  investment  Project  is  estimated  at  $13.032  million  equivalent,\nincluding  physical  and  price  contingencies,  taxes  and  duties,  and  interest  charges  during\nconstruction.  Of  the  total  costs,  $6.699  million  (51  percent)  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  and\n$6.333 million equivalent (49 percent) the local currency cost. A summary of cost estimates is\nshown in Table 1, and the detailed breakdown is given in Appendix 5.\n\n\f25\n\n111\n5,405\n456\n5,973\n\n418\n179\n597\n\n129\n\nProject Components\n\nA.

A description of these features follows.\n\n1. \n\nParticipatory Development and Improved Governance\n\n90.\nIn  the  course  of  economic  and  legal  reforms,  the  newly  established  national  and  state\neconomic  policy  implementation  councils  (EPICs)  will  help  to  maintain  the  reform  momentum,\nbuild  consensus,  and  monitor  implementation.  The  newly  established  BDC  in  each  state  will\nserve to provide feedback from the informal and small business sectors to the government and\nto establish partnerships with the government.\n\n91.\nAmended  foreign  direct  investment  laws  and  newly  established  mortgage  and\nbankruptcy  laws  will  improve  transparency,  fairness,  and  predictability  in  business  regulation\nand protection of creditors and debtors. Converting the current MEDC from a Government unit\ninto  an  arms-length  SBDC  will  help  protect  business  secrets  of  start-up  businesses  and\nenhance the credibility of the SBDCs.\n\n2. \n\nWomen, Youth, and the Poor\n\n92.\nThe ongoing business support program and the FSMDB small loan program show that\nequality  in  access  is  achievable.  The  specific  needs  of  women,  youth,  and  the  poor  will  be\n\n\f26\n\nfurther addressed under the SBDC and FSMDB strengthening components through their small\nbusiness support program and outreach program. The outreach program will target locationally\ndisadvantaged outer islanders particularly in Chuuk and Yap. Specific output targets will be set\nup, aimed at women and monitored by the SBDC and FSMDB.\n\n93.\nThe  investment  Project  will  focus  on  Chuuk,  where  half  of  the  FSM  population  resides\nand where the poor constitute 53 percent of the state population. Pohnpei is actively addressing\nthe  resettlement  needs  of  squatters    found  in  Kolonia  and  in  the  uplands  of  the  main  island.\nMeasures include (i) provision of leasehold contracts for occupied lands that will be convertible\nto freehold sale contracts at the end of the lease term; and (ii) establishment of a state land-use\nplan that will, among other things, provide alternative land for resettlement. Acceleration of land\ntitling  under  the  investment  Project  will  contribute  to  preventing  further  squatting  and\nimplementing resettlement without significant economic and social costs. Furthermore, proactive\nland survey and titling in outer islands where demand is strong will prevent migration to the main\nislands  by  enabling  investment  in  housing  and  income-earning  sectors  such  as  fisheries,\nagriculture, and tourism. The construction of new buildings for state land administration offices\nand  SBDCs  will  not  result  in  significant  land  acquisition  problems  since  all  the  identified  land\nsites are currently owned by the state governments and COM state campuses.\n\n3. \n\nEnvironment Interface\n\n94.\nThe  overall  PSDP  is  classified  in  environmental  category  C.  An  environmental  impact\nassessment  matrix  is  attached  as  Appendix  6.  Environmental  implications  were  reviewed  and\nno  adverse  impacts  were  identified,  with  specific  project  activities  expected  to  safeguard  the\nland  administration  and  management\nenvironment  as  development  proceeds.  The \nsubcomponent  will  improve  the  environmental  sustainability  of  land  use  by  providing  capacity\nbuilding in land management. Streamlining and improving the monitoring of land use laws and\nregulations, including geographic information systems, will assist islandwide land management.\nInitially this will be carried out in Pohnpei. Acceleration in land dispute settlement and titling is\nexpected  to  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  environment  with  clear  property  rights  providing  a\ngreater incentive for sustainable land parcel management over the long run.20\n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED LOANS\n\n95.\nImplementation  of  the  PSDP  requires  increased  recurrent  expenditures  and  additional\ninvestments to carry out the reforms, as well as to improve institutional infrastructure essential\nfor enabling private sector growth. The PSDP will be funded by proposed ADB loans equivalent\nto $13.017 million, including a policy-based loan ($5 million equivalent) and an investment loan\n($8.017  million  equivalent)  sourced  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  The  national  and\nstate  governments  will  finance  sector  investments  amounting  to  $5.015  million.  The  financing\nplan for ADB assistance is given in tables 2 and 3, and details for the two loans follow. Details of\nfinancing arrangements are in Appendix 5.\n\n                  \n\n20 The Nature Conservancy, an NGO with operations in Pohnpei, is actively promoting community-based watershed\nmanagement,  which  includes  the  training  of  island  communities  in  sustained  economic  use  of  lands  owned  or\ncontrolled by the communities. The watershed management program has identified the settlement of disputes and\ntitle issuance as essential for improved management.\n\n\f27\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nLoan\nPolicy Loan\nInvestment Loan\nTotal\n\n        Source: Staff estimates.\n\nADB\n    5.000\n8.017\n  13.017\n\nNational States\n    0.000\n1.388\n1.388\n\nTotal\n   0.000      5.000\n13.032\n18.032\n\n3.627\n3.627\n\nTable 3: PSDP Loans/Cost Allocation Among the National\nand State Governments\n($'000)\n\nNational\nLoan\n2,779\nInvestment Loan\n1,000\nPolicy Loan\n3,779\nTotal PSDP Loans\nPSDP = private sector development program.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\nA. \n\nThe Policy Loan\n\nYap\n1,204\n      800\n2,004\n\nChuuk\n1,780\n1,300\n3,080\n\nKosrae\n1,261\n      800\n2,061\n\nPohnpei\n      994\n   1,100\n2,094\n\nTotal\n8,017\n5,000\n13,017\n\n1. \n\nAmount of Loan, Terms, and Sources of Funds\n\nimplementation  of \n\nIt is proposed that ADB provide a policy-based loan of $5.0 million equivalent to support\n96.\nthe  Government\u2019s \nfor  private  sector\nthe  policy  and \ndevelopment.  The  total  amount  of  the  loan  would  be  provided  from  ADB's  Special  Funds\nresources.  This  loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  24  years,  including  an  8-year  grace  period,  1\npercent  interest  charge  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5    percent  per  annum\nthereafter, and equal amortization. The size of the loan is based on the scope and the costs of\nthe reforms, the importance of the reforms, and the state of public finances.\n\nlegal  reforms \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\n\n97.\nThe  Department  of  Finance  and  Administration  (DOF)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,\nresponsible for initiating withdrawals under the loan, and for allocating and monitoring the use of\ncounterpart funds. DEA will be the Implementing Agency. A PIU will be established within DEA\nto support program management. State governors' offices will be the implementing agencies at\nthe state level. A steering committee, co-chaired by the Secretary of Finance and the Secretary\nof  Economic Affairs,  and  to include  the Governors of the states or their representatives and a\nrepresentative for each of the COM and FSMDB, shall be established to monitor and coordinate\nthe Program and the Project.\n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement\n\n98.\nProcurement  of  eligible  items  under  ADB\u2019s  program  loan  will  be  based  on  normal\ncommercial  practices  for  procurement  by  the  private  sector  or  standard  Government\nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB for procurement by the public sector. In the case of\ngoods commonly traded on international commodity markets, procurement will be undertaken in\naccordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB. A list of ineligible\n\n\f28\n\nitems  is  attached  as  Appendix  7.  ADB  ensures  that  standard  private  and  public  sector\nprocurement procedures used in the FSM are adequate in terms of competition and efficiency.\n\n99. With  each  withdrawal  request,  the  Borrower  will  be  required  to  submit  a  certification\nconfirming  compliance  with  the  following  formula:  for  each  year  in  which  the  proceeds  of  the\nloan are expected to be disbursed, the annual withdrawal request is less than the value of the\ncountry\u2019s  total  imports  minus  (i)  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  (ii)  ineligible  imports,  and\n(iii) imports financed  by  other official development assistance. ADB will have the right to audit\nthe use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification.\n\n4. \n\nCounterpart Funds\n\nThe  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  by  the\n100.\nnational  and  state  governments  to  support  implementation  of  the  policy  and  legal  reforms  set\nout  in  the  policy  matrix  (Appendix  3).  The  Government  has  agreed  that  counterpart  funds\ngenerated by the transfer of loan funds from ADB will be deposited in the special account. The\naccount will be operated jointly by DEA and DOF, and the funds disbursed to state governments\nfor  implementing  reforms  for  private  sector  development.  Appropriate  arrangements  will  be\nmade between the national and state governments to ensure that counterpart funds allocated to\nthe  states  are  disbursed  upon  compliance  with  the  conditions  specified  for  each  state  in  the\npolicy  matrix.  Such  counterpart  funds  will  be  transferred  from  the  national  Government  to  the\nstate  governments,  with  terms  and  procedures  to  be  agreed  upon  by  the  national  and  state\ngovernments.\n\n5. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching\n\n101.\nThe policy component will start in February 2002 and end in February 2005. The loan of\n$5 million will be released in two equal tranches. The first tranche will be made available upon\nloan  effectiveness  (expected  about  February  2002).  The  second  tranche  is  expected  to  be\nreleased in August 2003 subject to the fulfillment by the governments of specific conditions for\nits  release,  as  detailed  in  the  development  policy  letter  (Appendix  2),  and  the  accompanying\npolicy  matrix  (Appendix  3),  including  satisfactory  progress  in  implementing  the  investment\nProject.\n\n102.\nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  review  PSDP  implementation  on  a  continuing  basis,  a\njoint  review  conducted  during  the  third  quarter  of  2003  prior  to  the  release  of  the  second\ntranche.  To  assist  in  ADB\u2019s  review,  the  Government  will  provide  relevant  information  through\nquarterly reports on the progress and impact of the policy reforms. The consultant engaged by\nDEA  for  the  PIU  will  assist  the  Government  in  monitoring  the  policy  component.  The  two\ntranches are expected to be released to the national Government in two steps, if necessary, the\nfirst release being made when the national Government and at least two of the states meet the\ntargets set out in the policy matrix. For the state(s) not meeting the targets, the corresponding\namount  will  be  withheld  by  ADB.  Subsequently,  additional  releases  could  be  made  as  the\nconcerned state(s) achieve their targets, provided these are met by August 2002 and February\n2004. If a state fails to meet its targets, then these portions of the loan will be canceled. A joint\nfinal  review  will  be  conducted  in  the  second  quarter  of  2005.  The  PIU  will  submit  program\nprogress reports, including detailed quarterly reports and the program completion report, to ADB\nwithin three months after PSDP completion.\n\n103.\nThe  counterpart  funds  will  be  disbursed  to  each  state  and  the  national  Government\nunder  each  tranche  as  shown  in  Table  4.  The  distribution  reflects  the  current  principle  of  the\n\n\f29\n\nrevenue sharing scheme between the national and state governments,21 the scope and cost of\nthe policy reforms, the importance of the reforms, and each government\u2019s financial capacity to\nsustain an improved level of private sector support services.\n\nTable 4: Program Loan Tranching and Allocation of Counterpart Funds\n($ \u2019000)\n\n Government\n\n1st Tranche 2nd Tranche\n\nTotal\n\nChuuk\nKosrae\nPohnpei\nYap\nNational\n   Total\n\n650\n400\n550\n400\n500\n      2,500\n\n650\n400\n550\n400\n500\n      2,500\n\n      1,300\n800\n      1,100\n800\n      1,000\n      5,000\n\n  Source: Staff estimates.\n\nB. \n\nThe Investment Loan\n\n1. \n\nLoan Amount , Terms, and Sources of Funds\n\nThe sector investments are estimated to cost $13.032 million equivalent. It is proposed\n104.\nthat ADB provide a loan of $8.017 million equivalent to finance 62 percent of the total cost of the\ninvestment  Project  from  its  Special  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will  finance  the  entire  foreign\nexchange cost of $6.699 million, including interest charges, and $1.318 million equivalent of the\nlocal currency cost equivalent. ADB financing of local currency cost includes primarily civil works\nfor  state  land  offices  and  BDCs,  and  staff  development  activities.  The  national  and  state\ngovernments will finance the remaining cost of $5.015 million equivalent (38 percent of the total\ncost).\n\n105.\nThe investment loan will have a maturity of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years,\nan interest charge of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5  percent per annum\nthereafter on the disbursed and outstanding amounts, and equal amortization. The Government\nwill  make  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  available  along  with  local  funds  to  DEA  and  state\ngovernment agencies through its regular budgetary allocations. The financing arrangements are\nsummarized in tables 5, 6, and 7, and the details in Appendix 5.\n\nTable 5: Investment Loan/Cost Allocation\n Among the National and State Governments\n($'000)\n\nCost\nInvestment Costs\nCounterpart Costs\n   Total\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\nNational\n2,779\n1,388\n4,167\n\nYap\n1,204\n859\n2,063\n\nChuuk\n1,780\n1,087\n2,866\n\nKosrae\n1,261\n918\n2,179\n\nPohnpei\n994\n763\n1,757\n\nTotal\n8,017\n5,015\n13,032\n\n21 The current government revenue sharing scheme (except fisheries fees) is 30:70 between the national and state\n\n                  \n\ngovernments.\n\n\f30\n\nAverage Annual\nGovernment\nContribution\n\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\nCost\nBy State\nTotal (4 years)\nAve. Annual\nIncremental Budget\n\nTable 6: Investment Loan/Average Annual Government Contribution\n(Recurrent and Incremental Costs)\n($'000)\n\nNational\n\nYap\n\nChuuk\n\nKosrae\n\nPohnpei\n\nTotal\n\n347\n\n215\n\n272\n\n230\n\n191\n\n1,255\n\nTable 7: Investment Loan/Incremental Costsa(Without Contingencies)\n($'000)\n\nNational Kosrae\n\nPohnpei\n\nChuuk\n\nYap\n\nTotal\n\n960.00\n\n399.15\n\n266.73\n\n417.93\n\n417.18\n\n2,461.00\n\n240.00\n\n99.79\n\n66.68\n\n104.48\n\n104.30\n\n615.25\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\nTotal\n\n452.95\n\n669.35\n\n669.35\n\n669.35\n\n2,461.00\n\nBy Year\nTotal\naTotals may appear not to add up due to rounding.\n Source: Staff estimates.\n\n2. \n\nImplementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\n\n106. DOF will be the Executing Agency, responsible for initiating withdrawals under the loan,\nand  for  allocating  and  monitoring  the  use  of  loan  proceeds.  DEA  will  be  the  Implementing\nAgency. A PIU will be established within DEA to support project implementation and ensure that\nall procurement activities are in accordance with ADB's guidelines. State governor\u2019s offices are\nthe Implementing Agencies at the state level. A steering committee, co-chaired by the Secretary\nof Finance and the Secretary of Economic Affairs, and to include the Governors of the states or\ntheir  representatives  and  a  representative  for  each  of  the  COM  and  FSMDB,  shall  be\nestablished  to  monitor  and  coordinate  the  Program  and  the  Project.  A  state  coordinating\ncommittee  shall  be  established  at  the  state  level  and  shall  be  chaired  by  the  Governor  of  the\nrelevant state and shall also include other members as determined by each Governor. The state\ncoordinating committee shall monitor and coordinate the Project at the state level.\n\n107. Capacity building of DEA and the role of the PPM are described in paras. 84 and 85.\n\nloan  effectiveness.  Specific  activities  will \n\nThe PPM must have extensive experience in the delivery of public services to the private\n108.\nsector.  The  services  will  be  required  for  24  months  over  the  program-project  implementation\nfollowing \n(i)  design  disbursement,\nprocurement,  and  recruitment  procedures  and  guidelines  under  the  PSDP,  and  undertake\nprocurement  initiatives;  (ii)  prepare  state  proposal  design  and  procurement  guidelines  for  the\ninvestment project component; (iii) prepare guidelines and support DEA in recruiting consultants\nusing  the  loan  proceeds;  (iv)  design  and  activate  a  national  and  state  implementation  and\nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  including  related  training  of  DEA  and  state\ncounterpart  staff;  (v)  facilitate  the  establishment  and  start-up  of  national  and  state  steering\ncommittees,  specifically  the  BDCs  or  their  equivalent;  (vi)  assist  DEA  and  national  and  state\nsteering committees in disseminating information on the improvements and changes under the\n\ninclude \n\n\f31\n\nPSDP;  (vii)  train  DEA  counterpart  staff  and  the  state  counterpart  staff  from  each  agency\nassigned to manage project implementation; and (viii) support the secretary of economic affairs\nin providing overall direction to consulting services delivered through the investment component.\n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Consulting Services\n\n109. Contracts  for  equipment  and  supplies  estimated  to  exceed  $500,000  and  contracts  for\ncivil  works  estimated  to  exceed  $1.0  million  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international\ncompetitive bidding as detailed in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts of lower value\nwill  be  procured  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding,  international  shopping,  or  direct\npurchase  as  per  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  Civil  works  contracts  valued  at  or  below\n$1.0  million  will  be  awarded  to  prequalified  contractors  in  accordance  with  local  competitive\nbidding procedures acceptable to ADB. lndicative contract packages are attached as Appendix\n8.\n\n110. Under the Project, 275.5 person-months of international consulting services in the areas\nof  land  administration  and  management,  development  banking,  business  development,  and\nproject  administration  will  be  required.  The  international  consultants  will  be  engaged  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and the domestic consultants will\nbe selected in accordance with arrangements acceptable to ADB. Clear indicators for expected\noutputs in skills transfer will be set up. Consultants will be selected not only for their technical\nqualifications, but also for their ability to guide, coach, and mentor local counterparts. Terms of\nreference of consulting services are shown in Appendix 9.\n\n4. \n\nDisbursement and Imprest Account\n\n111.\nTo manage disbursements of loan proceeds, an imprest account will be established by\nthe  Government  in  the  Bank  of  the  FSM.  The  initial  amount  in  the  imprest  account  is  not\nexpected to exceed $100,000. The imprest account will be established, managed, replenished,\nand  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook  dated  January  2001,\nand detailed arrangements agreed upon by ADB and the Government. The imprest account will\nbe operated jointly by the PIU in DEA and DOF.\n\n112.\nThe  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  procedures  will  be  used  for  reimbursing  eligible\nexpenditures under the loan, and for liquidating advances to the imprest account in accordance\nwith procedures acceptable to ADB and consistent with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.\nAny individual payment or contract to be reimbursed or liquidated under the SOE procedure will\nnot exceed the equivalent of $50,000.\n\n5. \n\nAdvance Action\n\n113.\nTo expedite Project implementation, ADB has approved advance procurement action to\nestablish  the  PIU,  engage  the  PPM,  and  select  and  recruit  consultants.  The  Government  has\nbeen advised that ADB\u2019s approval of such advance actions will not commit ADB to approve the\nPDSP subsequently, and no contract can be awarded prior to loan approval.\n\n6. \n\nAccounts, Auditing, and Reports\n\nThe  Government  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  goods  and\n114.\nservices  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds.  The  PIU  (DEA)  and  DOF  will  (i)  maintain  separate\naccounts  for  the  Project;  (ii)  ensure  that  the  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  are\n\n\f32\n\naudited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  principles  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB;\nand (iii) submit to ADB, not later than nine months after the close of each fiscal year, certified\ncopies  of  the  audited  accounts  and  the  report  of  the  auditor.  If  necessary,  funding  will  be\nprovided  under  the  loan  for  auditing  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements.  These\nfunds may be used to outsource auditing services. The PIU will submit project progress reports\nto  ADB  including  detailed  quarterly  reports  and  the  project  completion  report  within  three\nmonths  after  completion  of  the  Project.  The  annual  audit  will  include  the  audit  of  the  imprest\naccount and SOE, and a separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account and SOE.\n\n7. \n\nProject Implementation Period and Midterm Review\n\n115.\nThe Project will be implemented over four years from about February 2002 to February\n2006.  A  review  of  all  aspects  of  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  by  the  Government  and  ADB\nduring the third quarter of 2004. The project midterm review will (i) examine the scope, design,\nimplementation  arrangements,  and  other  relevant  issues  in  the  light  of  implementation  of  the\npolicy  component;  (ii)  evaluate  progress  toward  achieving  the  measurable  project  targets  and\ntheir  impacts  on  private  sector  development;  (iii)  identify  changes  since  the  time  of  appraisal\nrelating to sector issues, resource management, and allocations; and reassess their impact on\nproject  sustainability;  (iv)  evaluate  implementation  performance  against  the  established\nschedule; (v) verify the compliance with loan covenants; (vi) identify problems and constraints;\nfor  corrective  actions.  The  project\nand  (vii) \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 10.\n\nformulate  appropriate  recommendations \n\n8. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n116. Outline  performance  indicators  have  been  identified  based  on  the  outputs  cited  in  the\nbudget  documents22  and  in  accordance  with  the  existing  capacity  of  the  concerned  agencies\n(Appendix 11). Beneficiaries highlighted the critical importance of performance measurement. A\nspecific  target  level  is  associated  with  each  indicator.  Baseline  values  for  some  indicators  on\nwhich information is available are shown for FY2000. Performance indicators and their interim\nand final target values will be refined by the PIU. Additional indicators will be added at the PSDP\nobjective  and  goal  level  in  accordance  with  the  program  framework.  Wherever  possible,  data\nwill  be  desegregated  by  gender,  age,  and  income  group.  The  poverty  assessment  under  an\nADB  TA  for  strengthening  national  statistical  capacity  and  the  results  of  the  US-funded  FSM\n2000 household and population census will provide necessary primary data.\n\nThe  PIU  will  establish  a  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  detailing  the\n117.\nqualitative  and  quantitative  output  indicators  in  the  Program  Framework  (Appendix  1)  and  the\noutline  performance  indicators  within  three  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  These  will  also  be\nused  to  monitor  program  and  project  inputs  and  activities,  and  will  be  related  to  the\ncorresponding  impact  monitoring.  The  PPM  will  undertake  this  task  during  the  first  quarter  of\nimplementation,  and  will  report  on  actual  performance  through  the  progress  reports.  The\nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  will  be  designed  in  line  with  the  budget\npreparation of the concerned government agencies.\n\n                  \n\n22 The  newly  introduced  output-based  budget  system  is  yet  to  be  fully  operationalized  throughout  the  national  and\nstate agencies. A follow-on ADB TA for strengthening the output-based budget system will commence in late 2001.\n\n\f33\n\nVI. \n\nBENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA. \n\nExpected Impacts\n\n1. \n\nEconomic\n\n118.\nThe expected economic impacts on the FSM are identifiable at two levels: the effects of\nthe  policy  loan  and  the  effects  of  the  investment  loan.  The  policy  loan  aims  to  develop  an\neconomic  environment  conducive  to  private  sector  activity  and  investment  by  maintaining  the\ncommitment  to  reforming  the  public  sector  and  promoting  the  private  sector.  Maintenance  of\nfinancial  stability  through  balanced  budgets,  the  FSM  Trust  Fund,  and  sound  management  of\nexternal  debt  will  ensure  the  macroeconomic  stability  necessary  to  create  confidence  among\nforeign  and  domestic  investors.  Maintenance  of  government  payroll  levels  will  contribute  to\nkeeping  the  budget  balanced  as  well  as  reducing  the  differential  between  government  and\nprivate  wage  levels.  Public  enterprise  reform  will  reduce  the  budgetary  burden  on  the  public\nsector, improve resource allocation to social and physical infrastructure, and reduce competition\nwith the private sector, enabling the latter to grow more strongly.\n\n119.\nThe PSDP will develop priority areas of the legal and regulatory framework within which\nimproved  and  lower  cost,  market-based  transactions  can  increase  the  competitiveness  of\nresources.  Specifically,  improved  mortgage  laws  that  allow  foreign  commercial  banks  to  use\nleasehold  mortgage  procedures  are  expected  to  increase  access  to  capital;  extended  lease\nterms are expected to increase the attractiveness of the FSM to long-term investors interested\nin  bringing  capital  and  know-how.  Streamlined  foreign  investment  laws  and  regulations  are\ntransparency  and  eliminating\nexpected \ndiscretionary, and sometimes costly, reviews of applications.\n\ntransaction  costs  by \n\nto  decrease \n\nincreasing \n\n120.\nThe  increasing  demand  for  land  survey  and  registration  is  being  driven  by  a  gradual\nincrease  in  public  awareness  of  the  role  of  land  ownership  rights  for  increasing  access  to\nfinancing  through commercial loans, and by the need for improved security of lessee rights to\nencourage  domestic  and  foreign  investors.  This  demand  is  expected  to  grow  as  public\nunderstanding  of  the  value  of  clear  land  title  grows.  The  investment  in  improved  land\nmanagement  and  administration  capacity  is  expected  to  reduce  the  costs  of  surveying  and\nmapping per parcel, and accelerate land surveying and mapping. Currently the cost of surveying\nand  mapping  a  parcel  of  land  is  estimated  at  approximately  $550.  The  new  equipment  and\ntechniques  will  potentially  reduce  costs  of  surveying  and  mapping  to  $30  per  parcel  and\neliminate  the  problem  of  backlog  accumulation.  Experience  in  Pohnpei  with  improved  survey\nand mapping technology has shown estimated productivity increases of 200 percent for surveys\nand  300  percent  for  map  production,  with  possible  further  gains  through  technical  training.\nAccelerated23  land  surveying  and  titling  are  expected  to  increase  land  transactions  including\nleasing, sales, and use of land to secure lending. Improved registration systems are expected to\nreduce  the  time  wasted  and  costs  suffered  under  the  current  procedures.  Improved  land\nvaluation  is  expected  to  result  in  a  more  competitive  and  efficient  land  market,  allowing\ntransactions  to  occur  at  market  prices  known  to  both  the  buyers  and  sellers  of  land  rights.\nIncreased  user  right  security,  especially  for  lessors,  is  expected  to  facilitate  increased\ninvestment.\n\n                  \n\n23 Productivity gains of this magnitude will allow Pohnpei State to clear the current backlog of 1,600 parcels in 2 to 3\n\nyears compared with at least 6 years with the technology used in other FSM states.\n\n\f34\n\nThe  demand  for  commercial  finance,  especially  in  the  start-up  and  small  business\n121.\nsector,  is  evidenced  by  the  growth  in  commercial  lending  in  the  past  10  years24  and  the  high\nnumber  of  commercial  loan  applications  compared  with  approvals.  The  lack  of  response  by\ncommercial banks is due to high perceived risks, lack of collateral, and the administration costs\nof  lending  to  the  start-up  and  small  business  sector,  while  inefficiencies  in  direct  government\nloan schemes have resulted in poor performance of these schemes. FSMDB was identified as\nthe  institution  most  suited  to  expanding  development  finance,  including  longer-term  loans  at\ninterest rates lower than the commercial banks. The bank is the main source of financing for the\nagriculture,  fisheries,  manufacturing,  and  tourism  sectors.  Institutional  strengthening  under  the\nProject will also help FSMDB fulfill its role of higher risk lending to start-ups and small business.\nThe  expected  benefit  is  increased  access  to  capital  for  commercial  purposes  by  informal  and\nsmall business. The secured transactions legislation and registry system is expected to increase\naccess  to  commercial  finance  through  chattel  mortgaging,  which  will  provide  wider  access  to\ncapital,  especially  for  borrowers  who  do  not  have  titled  land  or  whose  loan  amounts  are\nrelatively  small.25  Although  the  value  of  capital  that  could  be  generated  by  the  system  is\nuncertain  at  this  stage,  the  investment  costs  for  passing  a  secured  transactions  law  and\nestablishing and operating a secured transactions systems are minimal.\n\n122. Demand for small business support services has been demonstrated through the MEDC\nprogram  and  the  high  level  of  participation  in  MEDC  training  and  services  in  the  areas  of\nentrepreneurship,  business  proposal  preparation,  and  aspects  of  business  management.26\nUnmet service demand exists in post-start-up advisory services, business information services,\nservices  for  informal  business,  and  locationally  disadvantaged  groups.  The  relocation  of  the\npresent  business  centers  to  state  COM  campuses  (Yap  excepted)  is  expected  to  improve\nefficiency,  allow  access  to  additional  and  better  qualified  staff  and  other  resources,  and  allow\nthe  development  of  a  more  effective  outreach  program  to  reach  the  locationally  and\neconomically disadvantaged.\n\n123. Given the limited growth prospects for the nontraded sectors such as the wholesale and\nretail  trade,  future  private  sector  growth  in  the  FSM  is  expected  to  be  mainly  in  the  tradable\nsectors  including  fisheries,  tourism,  agriculture,  and  light  manufacturing.  Expansion  into  the\ntraded  sectors  is  expected  to  be  driven  by  foreign  direct  investment  and  informal  and  formal\nSMEs.  The  extent  to  which  the  PSDP  facilitates  increased  private  sector  activity  will  be\nmeasured  by  the  increase  in  business  licenses,  company  registration,  and  foreign  investment\napplications.  The  with  and  without  effects  of  proposed  policy  and  legal  actions  and  project\ncomponents are provided in Appendix 12.\n\n2. \n\nPoverty and Social Impact\n\n124.\nThe PSDP will contribute to ongoing changes and evolution in traditional systems in the\nFSM  society  and  economy,  the  most  important  of  which  are  the  changes  from  a  subsistence\n\n                  \n\nthe end of the third quarter in 1999.\n\n24 Since 1990 total loans of the commercial banking sector have increased from a level of $29 million to $50 million by\n\n25  The  demand  identified  for  very  small  business  loans  is  generally  not  handled  by  any  of  the  formal  banks.  This\ndemand  was  found  among  low  income  and  disadvantaged  groups  including  outer  islanders  and  groups  living\noutside the state urban centers.\n\n26  Of  the  237  businesses  interviewed  during  the  project  preparatory  TA,  about  50  percent  of  the  enterprises  have\nparticipated  in  training  programs.  Entrepreneurship  or  management  training  and  accounting/bookkeeping  are  the\ntraining most demanded; 95 percent of the respondents feel that the training has benefited their enterprises, mainly\nthrough an improvement in their business and upgrading of employee skills. Eighty-five percent of respondents felt\nthey  needed  training,  by  order  of  preference,  in:  business  skills  (such  as  in  marketing,  customer  service,  etc.),\nentrepreneurship and management, accounting/bookkeeping, and technical skills.\n\n\f35\n\neconomy  to  a  market  economy,  community  ownership  of  land  to  individual  ownership,\nmembership in extended lineages and clans to the nuclear family, and greater individualism in\nsocial life and economic activity. The evolution of land tenure and rights has proved especially\ndifficult  for  the  FSM.  The  major  social  issues  surrounding  land  include  land  disputes  within\nclans,  the  increasing  inability  of  traditional  leaders  to  settle  disputes;  exploitation  due  to\nignorance  surrounding  land  values;  the  protection  of  lessee  and  lessor  rights;  and  the\ndisincentive to investors owing to lack of clarity of title and rights. These ongoing changes have\ncarried social costs, but as evidenced by the changes over the past 20 years, this is a choice\nthat  Micronesian  society  has  made  for  the  sake  of  adopting  a  more  modern  lifestyle,  self-\nsustaining economic growth, and better social services. The extent to which the FSM\u2019s different\nethnic groups have adopted these changes while maintaining traditions varies considerably, as\ndoes  the  extent  to  which  the  changes  have  caused  social  problems.  By  providing  better-\ntargeted  services  to  members  of  FSM  society  who  have  been  bypassed  by  recent  economic\nchange,  more  equitable  opportunities  for  economic  and  consequently  social  improvement  will\nlikely be provided.\n\nThe  poverty  impact  of  the  PSDP  on  disadvantaged  and  low  income  groups  will  be\n125.\npositive  overall,  both  directly  and  indirectly,  as  detailed  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.\nEssentially,  the  various  components  of  policy  and  project  loans  will  act  through  the  following\nthree  channels:  (i)  promote  overall  growth  through  private  sector  development  leading  to\nincreased employment and income; (ii) channel a large share of the project benefits to the main\nlow  income  and  poverty  groups  to  ensure  that  they  can  use  the  enhanced  services  and\ncontribute to and benefit from economic growth; and (iii) assist the government to increase the\nfocus  of  public  expenditure  on  social  services  by  promoting  non-public-sector  dependent,\nprivate-sector driven economic growth.\n\n126.\nThe investment Project\u2019s allocations support all states, but given that more than half of\nChuuk\u2019s population is poor, it will benefit from a proportionately higher portion of services to be\ndeveloped  under  the  Project,  as  will  the  poor  in  other  states.  The  business  development  and\nFSMDB  components  will  emphasize  reaching  the  disadvantaged  and  low-income  groups:  the\nouter  islanders  and  dislocated  migrants  now  living  in  the  district  centers.  The  latter  group,  for\nexample,  are  suited  to  being  assisted  with  non-land-based  activities,  such  as  local  food\nprocessing for which domestic and regional export market demand is increasing (e.g., Guam).\nProactive  land  survey  and  titling  in  the  outer  islands,  where  the  demand  is  strong,  will  also\nprevent  migration  to  the  main  islands  by  enabling  investments  in  housing  and  income-earning\nsectors such as fisheries, agriculture, and tourism in the outer islands.\n\n127. While women have traditionally deferred to men in FSM society, they are steadily closing\nthe gender gap in terms of educational attainment and participation in the nonsubsistence labor\nforce (in which their share has grown to a third, almost doubling in the last three decades). By\nseeking to involve women in small businesses, the Project builds on their traditional productive\nrole  as  weavers  and  makers  of  community  valuables.  It  also  seeks  to  revitalize  informal\ncommunity women's organizations for delivery of credit, training, and marketing. The increase in\nthe  number  of  land  titles,  including  those  held  by  women,  will  make  it  easier  for  women  to\naccess the banks directly, instead of relying on male relatives.\n\n128. Young males are disentangling themselves from traditional household obligations faster\nthan  their  sisters,  who  still  have  a  secure  place  in  the  family.27  By  extending  the  Project\u2019s\n\n                  \n\n27 The suicide rate for the general population is among the highest in the world, and in some islands exceeds 200 per\n100,000  for  males  aged  15-24.  The  spread  of  the  market  economy,  which  allows  independent  access  to  cash-\n\n\f36\n\nbusiness development activities to school dropouts and other youth-at-risk, and thereby giving\nthem  an  alternative  focus  in  life,  the  Project  will  help  to  address  the  considerable  issue  of\nunemployed and out-of-school youth in the FSM.\n\nB. \n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\n1. \n\nWeak Political Will for Reforms\n\nThe  Government\u2019s  political  commitment  could  weaken, \n\nin\n129.\nimplementing  the  reform  measures.  The  complex  political  structure  may  also  result  in  uneven\nperformance in policy reform and project implementation among the four states. A national and\nstate  jurisdictional  issue  over  the  secured  transaction  law  may  lead  to  varying    content  and\nimplementation, and even disagreement on legal changes.\n\nin  delay \n\nresulting \n\n130. Government  commitment  is  reflected  in  the  results  of  the  Second  FSM  Economic\nSummit;  EPIC  will  oversee  key  issues  of  economic  reform.  The  policy  actions  and  the  time\nframe in the policy matrix reflect each state's financial and legal situation, and local acceptance\nand  capacity  for  implementing  reforms.  Tranching  strategy  of  the  policy  loan  is  designed  to\nprevent delay of loan release at the expense of the states that are able to meet the conditions.\nAll  areas  of  proposed  legislative  and  regulatory  change  have  been  raised  recently  in\ngovernment  or  state  legislatures,  and  attempts  have  already  been  made  to  draft  bills.  The\nproposed national secured transaction law under ADB (footnote 18) TA presented an approach\nto resolve the jurisdictional issue satisfactorily for both the national and state governments. The\nstates,  while  protecting  their  jurisdictions,  have  also  shown  a  willingness  to  consider  changes\nthat have proved to be successful in other states.\n\n2. \n\nEffectiveness of Public Administration and Judiciary\n\nInstitutional  capacities  of  and  coordination  between  various  government  agencies  are\n131.\ngenerally weak. FSMDB and the SBDCs have limited capacity for outreach to large numbers of\ninexperienced potential business people. Institutional capacity to enforce legislation through the\ncourts  is  insufficient.  If  a  mechanism  for  accelerating  the  settlement  of  land  disputes  is  not\nrealized,  this  will  diminish  the  potential  benefits  from  improved  surveying  and  mapping\ntechnology.  Moreover,  an  attempt  to  accelerate  surveying  and  mapping  without  an  effective\ndispute settlement mechanism may accentuate disputes.\n\n132. DEA and the state governments have implemented the ADB-funded PSRP since 1997,\nand  will  be  strengthened  through  on-the-job  training  for  three  years  by  an  international  PPM.\nCareful  planning  and  monitoring  will  enable  DEA  to  implement  the  investment  Project\neffectively. In particular, advance procurement action and retroactive financing will be available\nfor selecting and recruiting consultants, establishing the PIU, and engaging the PPM in order to\nensure  timely  implementation.  The  need  for  judiciary  training  and  court  management  is  well\nrecognized  and  the  Government  is  expected  to  address  this  need  in  the  short-  and  medium-\nterm through ADB and other external assistance. In the states where land dispute settlement is\na  prominent  issue,  consulting  services  for  establishing  an  effective  settlement  mechanism  will\nbe provided prior to physical investments.\n\n   \nincomes, has led to a weakening of  the traditional father-son relationship. Most suicides have to do with anger and\ndeep  disappointment  at  the  rupture  of  a  close  relationship  with  a  respected  family  elder  such  as  the  father  or\nbrother. The ratio of male to female suicides is reported to be 14:1.\n\n\f37\n\n3. \n\nWeak Response from the Private Sector\n\n133.\nIncreased lending and business support to small business may not increase the number\nand performance of new and existing businesses due to a lack of viable business opportunities\nand  ineffective  training  and  business  advisory  support.  Strengthened  legal  systems  may  not\nresult  in  increased  foreign  investments  and  increased  leasehold  and  mortgage  transactions.\nSmall businesses may not perform sufficiently to repay loans and minimize defaults.\n\n134. State  BDCs  will  oversee  the  performance  of  the  SBDCs;  and  facilitate  their  interaction\nwith NGOs, FSMDB, and the Government to provide integrated business support services. The\nlabor market information system to be operated by the SBDCs will help increase awareness of\njob opportunities. Recent FSMDB data show that small loans under $1,000 do not experience\nloan  recovery  problems.  Improved  skills  and  management  in  examining  loan  proposals  will\nprevent a deterioration of FSMDB's loan recovery rate.\n\n4. \n\nAffordability and Sustainability\n\n135. With  the  impending  review  of  Compact  funding,  the  possible  reduction  of  external\ntransfers may prevent the Government from mobilizing the increased expenditures anticipated.\nIncremental  recurrent  costs  may  not  be  financed  sufficiently  and  on  a  timely  basis  by  the\nnational and state governments.\n\n136. Sound fiscal management and external debt management will enable the Government to\nmake available the required resources to sustain the improved level of public services beyond\nthe project implementation period. In particular, the FSM Trust Fund, if fully operationalized, will\ngenerate additional revenues for the governments to support the increased recurrent costs.\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n137.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe Government will (a) maintain the policies adopted and actions taken prior to\nthe  date  of  the  Loan  Agreement  for  the  policy  loan,  as  described  in  the\ndevelopment policy letter (Appendix 2) and the policy matrix (Appendix 3), for the\nduration  of  the  PSDP  policy  loan  period;  and  subsequently,  (b)  promptly  adopt\nthe other policies and take the other actions included in the PSDP as specified in\nthe  development  policy  letter  and  the  policy  matrix  (including  the  conditions  for\nrelease of the second tranche as described in the policy matrix); and (c) ensure\nthat such policies and actions continue in effect for the duration of the policy loan\nperiod.\n\nThe Government will ensure FSMDB implements a new corporate plan focusing\non  business  promotion,  customer  service,  financial  sustainability,  and  human\nresources development. FSMDB will develop the existing system of management\nby  objectives  with  each  state  branch  setting  lending,  collection,  and  profit\nobjectives.\n\n\f38\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nIn each state, the SBDC will be advised by a BDC that will have representatives\nfrom the private sector, banks, COM, NGOs, and the state government. The BDC\nwill  replace  the  current  Micronesian  Entrepreneur  Development  Center  Board.\nThe  Government  will  aim  at  having  the  SBDCs  become  self-sustaining\norganizations  by  causing  them  to  charge  fees  for  their  training  and  advisory\nservices, as appropriate, and to receive funds from other external sources.\n\nThe  Government  will  introduce  nominal  charge  for  certain  activities  associated\nwith  first  registration  activities  while  full  charges  shall  be  levied  for  secondary\ntransactions  in  land  rights,  such  as  leases  and  the  recording  and  registering  of\nmortgages.  As  the  land  administration  systems  become  established,  fee\nstructures for land titling shall be reviewed with a view to increasing cost recovery\nfor the systems.\n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loans Effectiveness\n\n138. Common  Condition  for  the  Policy  and  Investment  Loans.  At  least  two  states  will\neach have executed and delivered its relending agreement to the Borrower, and such relending\nagreement, in form and substance acceptable to ADB, will have been duly authorized or ratified\nby all necessary government action at the state and national level; and all conditions precedent\nto  the  effectiveness  of  the  relending  agreements  (other  than  a  condition  requiring  the\neffectiveness of the Loan Agreements) will have been fulfilled.\n\n139. Policy  Loan  Effectiveness.  All  conditions  precedent  to  the  effectiveness  of  the\ninvestment  Loan  Agreement  (other  than  a  condition  requiring  the  effectiveness  of  the  policy\nLoan Agreement) are fulfilled.\n\nInvestment Loan Effectiveness. Effectiveness will be subject to the satisfaction of the\n\n140.\nfollowing special conditions:\n\nAll conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the policy Loan Agreement (other\nthan  a  condition  requiring  the  effectiveness  of  the  investment  Loan  Agreement)\nare fulfilled.\n\nA  PIU  is  established  within  DEA,  with  a  PPM  and  local  counterpart  staff,\nsatisfactory to ADB.\n\nC. \n\nConditions for Disbursement of the Investment Loan\n\nFor disbursement of certain components of the investment loan, the following conditions\n\n141.\nwill be met:\n\nThe new FSMDB corporate plan will be put into effect.\n\nThe business development act will be enacted in Chuuk, Kosrae, and Yap; and\nthe current Pohnpei business development act will be amended.\n\nLand  sites  will  be  made  available  for  construction  of  new  buildings  of  land\nadministration  (Chuuk,  Kosrae,  and  Yap)  and  SBDCs  (Chuuk,  Kosrae,  and\nPohnpei).\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii)\n\n\f39\n\nVIII.

However, a considerable reform agenda remains. Substantial cuts\nin  the  size  and  cost  of  government  have  been  achieved  but  structural  change  toward  greater  private\nsector  employment  and  development  is  slow  to  occur  due  to  fundamental  constraints  in  the  FSM\u2019s\neconomic  resources  and  markets,  support  services  and  legal  environment.  The  Private  Sector\nDevelopment Program (PSDP),  as an important element of  our  broader  reform program,  is  designed to\nhelp  the  FSM  establish  an  open  and  competitive  economy  that  is  conducive  to  private  sector\ndevelopment  by  promoting  a  favorable  macroeconomic  and  legal  environment  for  investment,  and\nincreasing the mobilization, productivity and competitiveness of FSM\u2019s land, labor and capital resources.\n\nThe broad economic policy framework that guides the Government\u2019s overall economic reform efforts was\ndeveloped  at  the  Second  FSM  Economic  Summit  in  September  1999.  Subsequent  to  that,  ADB  has\ncontributed  significantly  to  the  development  of  the  PSDP  that  will  enable  the  National  and  State\nGovernments  of  the  FSM  to  implement  a  broad  range  of  macroeconomic  and  microeconomic  reforms\nconsistent with the results of that Summit. The PSDP, to be jointly funded with Bank support, represents a\ntimely  and  necessary  combination  of  two  components:  first,  a  policy  reform  component,  and  second  a\nsector  development  project  that  will  focus  financial  and  technical  resources  to  implement  reforms  and\nsupport institutional strengthening.\n\nSince developing the broad outlines of the PSDP towards the end of 1999, the FSM National and State\nGovernments  were  thoroughly  engaged  in  the  program  design  work  of  the  PSDP  with  the  PPTA\nconsulting team, and worked closely with Bank staff. The major elements of the PSDP were presented for\ndeliberation  at  the  FSM  Economic  Policy  Implementation  Council  and  the  policy  leaders  of  the  nation\ndemonstrated  their  support  for  the  PSDP  through  unanimous  support  of  those  present  for  EPIC\nResolution  2000-1-01.  We  anticipate  approval  of  the  National-State  Financial  Agreements  immediately\nfollowing authorization of the PSDP loan  by the Congress of the FSM in the session that commences in\nOctober 2001.\n\nObjectives and Scope of the Private Sector Development Program\n\nThe  Government,  with  advice  from  the  ADB-supported  PSDP  PPTA  Consulting  Team  and  with\nbackground  advisory  support  of  the  Economic  Management  Policy  Advisory  Team  (EMPAT),  has\ndeveloped  an  action-oriented,  time  bound  approach  to  the  implementation  of  those  elements  of  the\nnation\u2019s  overall  economic  reform  program  related  to  accelerating  private  sector  development.  This\nprogram is already underway and the policy reforms required are, in many cases, being implemented or\nconsidered on a timely basis; however, a range of activities await implementation of the ADB-supported\nPSDP.\n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 2, page 2\n\nThe  overall  objective  of  the  PSDP  is  to  establish  an  economic  and  legal  environment  conducive  to\ncompetitive, private sector-led economic growth. Specific objectives are to:\n(cid:1)  consolidate public sector and economic reform policies that support private sector development;\n(cid:1) \n\nimprove the legal and regulatory environment that influences access to and mobilization of economic\nresources by the private sector;\n\n(cid:1) \n(cid:1) \n\n(cid:1) \n\nincrease access to and security of land for economic use;\n\nincrease access to finance needed for business start-up and expansion of small and medium sized\nenterprises (SMEs);\n\nimprove business and entrepreneurial skills in small and medium size enterprises and in the informal\nsector;\n\n(cid:1)  strengthen the institutional capacity in the Department of Economic Affairs to implement the PSDP.\n\nThe Policy Component\n\nFirst Tranche Policy Actions\n\nThe policy component includes the consolidation of economic reform policies, passage of legal provisions\nthat favor private sector development, and assurance of future funding for accomplishing required reform\nmeasures to promote private sector development.\n\nUnder the broad objective of maintaining economic and public sector reforms, actions will be taken in five\nareas before the release of the first tranche under the program loan:\n\n1.  Each of the five governments is committed to have a balanced budget for fiscal year 2002.\n\n2.  Each government is committed to a wage bill target for fiscal year 2002 which shall not exceed the\n\nfollowing amounts:\n\na.  National:\n\nb.  Chuuk:\n\nc.  Kosrae:\n\nd.  Pohnpei:\n\ne.  Yap:\n\n$ 8.41 million\n\n$15.94 million\n\n$ 5.80 million\n\n$12.90 million\n\n$ 4.51 million\n\n3.  The  FSM  National  Government,  on  behalf  of  all  five  governments,  will  ensure  that  the  FSM  Trust\n\nFund law is passed and the Board established.\n\n4.  The FSM National Government, in coordination with the State Governments, is committed to ensure\nthat  total  FSM  official  external  debt,  net  of  assets  held  for  loan  repayment,  does  not  exceed  24\npercent of GDP in fiscal year 2002.\n\n5.  Each  of  the  five  governments  has  committed  that  Public  Enterprise  Reform  Draft  Master  Plans  are\ncompleted.  At  a  minimum  this  will  result  in  the  transformation  of  five  public  enterprises  and,  more\noptimistically,  will  result  in  appropriate  and  efficient  transformation  of  all  of  the  FSM\u2019s  public\nenterprises by the end of the program period.\n\nUnder the broad objective of improving the legal environment for private sector development actions will\nbe taken in two additional areas before the release of the first tranche:\n\n6.  Each of the five governments has committed to draft legislation to improve the legal environment for\n\nlong(er) term leasing of land and for encouraging mortgage-secured commercial lending.\n\n\f47\n\nAppendix 2, page 3\n\nSecond Tranche Policy Actions\n\nActions will also be taken before the release of the second tranche under the program loan:\n\n1.  The budgets of the five governments will be balanced in fiscal years 2003 and 2004.\n\n2.  The  increase  of  the  wage  bill  targets  referred  to  above  for  each  government  will  not  exceed  1.5\n\npercent in fiscal year 2003 and a further 1.5 percent in fiscal year 2004.\n\n3. \n\nIn  the  event  of  a  two  year  extension  of  the  economic  provisions  under  the  FSM  Compact  of  Free\nAssociation with the United States, at least 50 percent of the increase of budgetary support under the\nCompact base grant for fiscal year 2002 and 2003 will be placed into the FSM Trust Fund referred to\nabove. The FSM Trust Fund will be fully operational.\n\n4.  The FSM official external debt, net of assets held for loan repayment, will not exceed 24 percent of\n\nGDP in fiscal years 2003 and 2004.\n\n5.  At least one public enterprise will be transformed by each of the five governments.\n\nThe following legislative actions will be taken before the release of the second tranche:\n\n6.  The long term leasing of land and the mortgage-secured commercial lending draft legislation referred\n\nto above will be enacted in each State.\n\n7.  The  foreign  investment  draft  amendments  referred  to  above  will  be  enacted  by  the  National\n\nGovernment and each State and regulations will be promulgated.\n\nThe Investment Project Component\n\nThe investment project is designed to improve the performance of the public sector in efforts to promote\nprivate sector development.  The investment project includes three components:\n\n1.  Establishment of a nationwide secured transactions system: this will involve the passage of an\numbrella  national  law,  as  well  as,  perhaps,  State  laws  consistent  with  the  commitment  to  promote\nchattel mortgage secured commercial lending. All five governments are committed to establishing a\nunified  and  comprehensive  FSM  Registry.  A  separate  commitment  has  been  made  by  the  five\nGovernments  to  participate  in  a  Bank-supported  consultancy  to  identify,  and  subsequently  enact\nbalanced and appropriate bankruptcy laws.\n\n2.  Strengthening of Institutional Capacity to Support Private Sector Development: this component\n\nwill entail capital investments and consulting services in the following three areas.\n\na.  Land  Administration  and  Management:  the  four  State  governments  have  committed  to  a\nthe\ntraining,  and  capital \nprogram  of  advisory  support, \nmodernization  and  development  of  land  registration  systems,  (ii)  expedite  the  issuance  of\nland  titles,  (iii)  develop  appropriate  institutions  and  procedures  for  dispute  resolution,  (iv)\ndevelop appropriate systems for zoning and land use management, and (v) develop capacity\nfor land valuation.\n\nto:  (i)  promote \n\ninvestment \n\nb.  Financial  Services  to  the  Private  Sector:  the  legal  and  regulatory  reforms  outlined  above\nwill  address  the  needs  of  the  commercial  banking  sector  to  increase  commercial  lending;\nhowever,  the  FSM  Development  Bank  (FSMDB)  has  further  committed  to  a  program  of\ninstitutional strengthening to enhance its ability to focus effectively on small and medium-size\nbusiness  promotion  and  customer  service.  The  FSMDB  has  committed  to  updating  its\nCorporate  Plan  accordingly  and  to  implement  a  long-term,  integrated  capacity  building\nprogram  to  improve  its  human  resource  skills  base  and  to  improve  its  long-term  financial\nviability.\n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 2, page 4\n\nc.  Small  Business  Development  Services:  the  National  Government  and  four  State\ngovernments  have  committed  to  supporting  the  extension,  expansion  and  re-formulation  of\nthe activities formerly provided under the Micronesian Entrepreneurial Development (MEDC)\nprogram.  The  strengthened  program  will  be  renamed  as  Small  Business  Development\nCenters (SBDC) and will also incorporate a labor market information system.\n\n3.  Program  and  Project  Implementation:  the  National  Government  has  committed  to  establish  a\nProject  Implementation  Unit  (PIU)  within  the  implementing  agency.  The  FSM  Department  of\nEconomic Affairs will be strengthened in its ongoing role as a conduit for significant donor assistance\nactivities in support of sectoral development and economic management.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFinancial  and  technical  support  from  ADB  in  conjunction  with  determined  efforts  and  sustained\ncommitment on the part of the five Governments in the FSM will ensure progress toward our stated goals.\nThe National Government is committed to fully implement the comprehensive policy actions as delineated\nin the attached policy matrix. Many of these steps have already been taken and the timetable expressed\nin the Policy Matrix represents a firm commitment to achieve the remaining actions. Given the complexity\nof  our  Federal  Government  structure,  the  National  Government  will  monitor  performance  across  all  five\nGovernments.  The  policy-level  monitoring  will  be  the  primary  responsibility  of  the  Department  of\nEconomic  Affairs.  The  staff  economists  within  the  Policy  division  of  that  department  will  provide  the\ntechnical  expertise  to  support  program  implementation  and  monitoring,  in  conjunction  with  the  EMPAT\nadvisers  with  whom  they  work.  The  Department  of  Economic  Affairs,  as  the  implementing  agency,  will\nalso  provide  a  full-time  project  implementation  specialist  within  its  project  implementation  unit  to\neffectively  facilitate  the  use  of  the  complex  set  of  technical  and  financial  inputs  anticipated  under  the\nPSDP.  It  is  further  understood  that,  while  the  policy  loan  effectivity  will  be  a  condition  for  project  loan\neffectivity and vice versa, each of the investment project components will proceed according to detailed\nproject  timelines  and  subject  to  the  specific,  project-related  commitments  undertaken  by  each\ngovernment.\n\nRepresenting the borrowing entity, the executing agency will be the National Department of Finance and\nAdministration. It should be clear that the conditions agreed to in the policy matrix for each Government\nwill be binding only on that Government. I do not anticipate any failures to meet the stated conditions for\ntranche  release;  however,  the  unanticipated  problems  of  any  individual  Government  should,  to  the\nmaximum  extent  possible,  not  cause  ADB  to  delay  the  release  of  finances  to  those  Governments  that\nhave  fully  met  the  conditions  to  which  they  committed.  The  FSM  Government  views  the  PSDP  as  a\nsecond  phase  in  our  successful  and  ongoing  effort  in  conditioned  collaboration  with  ADB  and  other\ndonors who may be contributors of financial and/or technical support.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn Ehsa\nSecretary of Finance and Administration\n\n\fPOLICY MATRIX\n\nThe  First  Tranche  will  be  disbursed  at  loan  effectivity.  The  Government  will  have  registered  adequate  progress  by  November  2001  and  this  is\ndescribed in the Development Policy Letter.  The actions listed in the Policy Matrix must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of ADB as conditions for\nBoard consideration (first tranche release) and second tranche release. The two tranches will be released to the national Government in two steps\nif necessary, the first tranche being released when the national Government and at least two of the States meet the targets set out in the Policy\nMatrix. For the state(s) not meeting the targets, the corresponding amount will be withheld; subsequently releases could be made as the state(s)\nachieve their targets, provided these are met by August 2002 and February 2004. If a state fails to meet its targets, then these portions of the loan\nwill be canceled.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPolicy\n\nConditions for Board\nConsideration\n\nActions to be Taken Prior\nto Second

POLICY LOAN\n\nPolicy Measure\n\nAssessed Environmental Impact\n\nMaintain financial stability.\n\n? Limited government budgets may have an indirect impact on\n\n \nIncrease the commitment to the\nfuture financial stability of the\nFederated States of Micronesia by\nincreasing savings and investment\nin the FSM Trust Fund.\n\nMaintain a low and sustainable\nlevel of net external debt to allow\nfor the uncertainties over Compact\nrenegotiations and future debt\nservice capacity.\n\nLimit size of government by\navoiding a net increase in public\nservice payrolls.\n\nInitiate a program of public\nenterprise divestment and\nprivatization.\n\nEncourage long-term investment\nand commitments through long-\nterm land lease.\n\nFacilitate the use of land leasehold\nmortgage to increase availability of\nfinance for private sector\ndevelopment.\n\nEncourage foreign investment in\ncompetitive export growth\nindustries by streamlining and\nimproving transparency in foreign\ninvestment laws and regulations.\n\nexpanding the surveillance, monitoring, and control functions of the\nstate environmental protection agencies and similar development\nreview agencies. However, in most cases this can be resolved by\nmore efficient use of existing resources.\n\n? The FSM Trust Fund measures are unlikely to directly affect the\nenvironment. Indirectly, assured future funding will guarantee\nfunding for environmental protection, provided the institutional\nissues surrounding these agencies can be addressed.\n\n+ Past external debt was used to finance unsustainable government\n\noperations including public enterprises. Avoidance of\nunsustainable government enterprises will reduce the possibility of\ninefficient exploitation of FSM\u2019s natural resources.\n\n? Reexpanding the staff of surveillance, monitoring, and control\nfunctions of the state environmental protection agencies and\nsimilar development review agencies may have an indirect impact .\nHowever, their prelayoff performance raises institutional issues\nover the most appropriate means of fulfilling this function in the\nfuture.\n\n+ Public enterprise reform in general is expected to facilitate\n\ninvestment in more efficient production, especially ocean fisheries.\nHowever, this may also lead to larger catches. To control the use\nof the fisheries resource, the FSM is developing a comprehensive\nmarine resource management plan.\n\n+ Long-term land leasing laws are intended to attract more\n\nsustainable investments in shore facilities supporting the fisheries\nindustry, tourism, and agriculture leading to environmental\nimprovement.  This will help decrease the cases of short-term\nresource exploitation that has proven to be environmentally\ndamaging.\n\n+ Leasehold mortgaging is expected to increase the interest of both\nborrower and lender in ensuring the longer-term sustainability of\nthe enterprise, benefiting the environment.\n\n - Increased foreign investment may increase the pressure on\n\nresource use in the FSM, negatively impacting the environment.\nHowever, by establishing open and transparent laws and\nregulations on resource use, and increasing the attractiveness to\nquality and longer-term investors capable of sustainably\ndeveloping the FSM\u2019s areas of comparative advantage, this is\nexpected to reduce the number of short-term opportunistic\nventures. Predetermine of which subsectors investment will occur\nin is uncertain, but tourism, fisheries, light manufacturing, and to a\nlesser extent, agriculture are the most likely.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\nAssessed Environmental Impact\n\n? Commercial activity resulting from additional small loans will\nincrease production. Predetermining in which subsectors\nproduction growth will occur is difficult, but for small loans this is\nlikely to include marketing and retailing, handicrafts, inshore\nfisheries, and agriculture. The impact on natural resources and the\nenvironment will depend on the method of production and the\nenforcement of sustainable production methods.\n\n+ Clear land ownership and property rights are expected to increase\n\nthe incentive to use land resources more sustainably. This\nincludes both individually owned land and communal lands and\nhas been clearly demonstrated through the Pohnpei Watershed\nManagement Project.\n\n+ Valuation and exchange of land will lead to the development of\nland for its optimum use, compared with the extensive use of\nmethods currently observed where title is not held or unclear. As\nvaluation will also be done in parallel with the clarification of title,\noverall land should be used more sustainably. This is expected to\nbe enhanced with improved land use planning.\n\n ?Commercial activity resulting from additional loans will increase\n\nproduction. Predetermining in which subsectors production growth\nwill occur is difficult, but sectors will include tourism, fisheries, and\nagriculture.

Increased investment\nleads to improved prospects for private\nsector growth. Rent and income streams\nwill be for landowners.\n\nAccess to capital for commercial\npurposes by domestic landowners will\nbe increased, improving the prospects\nfor private sector growth, employment,\nand incomes.\n\nEncourage foreign investment in\ncompetitive export growth industries\nby streamlining and improving\ntransparency in foreign investment\nlaws and regulations.\n\nLack of transparency and excessive\nred tape will continue to discourage\npotential investors.\n\nBarriers to entry for foreign investors will\nbe reduced, with potential for bringing\ninvestment capital and know how.\n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\nInvestment Project\n\nProject Component\n\nWithout Project\n\nWith Project\n\nEncourage lending for commercial\nstart-ups and expansion through\nsecured transactions legislation.\n\nAccess to capital will continue to be a\nmajor constraint to start-up and small\nbusinesses\n\nAccess to capital and small loans will\nbe increased\n\nEncourage long-term investment\nthrough settlement of land disputes,\naccelerated adjudication,\ndetermination, titling, and improved\nrecord keeping.\n\nUnresolved land disputes and slow\nissuance of title will discourage\nproductive use of land resources and\ninvestment, and limit access to capital.\n\n \nDevelop competitive land markets\nthrough improved land valuation.\n\n \nImprove the capacity of banking\nservices and products for financing\nprivate sector growth including small\nbusiness and business start-ups.\n\n \nInappropriate land valuation will\nundermine competitiveness or lead to\nlost revenue for landowners, and\ndiscourage the development of efficient\nland markets.\n \nInadequate development finance will\nhamper private sector growth.\n\nStart-up and small businesses will\ncontinue to be unable to access finance\nlimiting small informal and small\nentrepreneur development.\n\nStrengthen business development\nservices to provide information, advice,\nand training for businesses at all levels\nof experience, including informal and\nsmall business.\n\nLack of access to sound and appropriate\nbusiness advise will limit potential\nbusiness start-ups or result in a higher\ndegree of business failure undermining\nprivate sector development.\n\nEnsure private sector employment\nopportunities are known and widely\ndisseminated through improved labor\nmarket information.\n\nIgnorance of employment opportunities\nand available labor will continue.\n\nMapping and registry offices will be\nmodernized, staff trained, and survey\nservices privatized. Adjudication and\ndetermination will be simplified and\naccelerated. Improved and accelerated\ntitling and collateralization allows\naccess to finance for investment or\nsecured leasing encouraging\ninvestment.\n \nLand values and markets are more\ncompetitive leading to improved\nprofitability and competitiveness in the\nprivate sector.\n\n \nEase of access to finance will stimulate\nprivate sector activity and growth.\n\nProspects for the informal and small\nbusiness sector will improve.\n\nAccess to sound and appropriate\nbusiness advisory services and\nincreased business skills will increase\nbusiness start-ups and existing\nbusiness performance, and reduce the\nrisks of business failure.\n\nIncreased awareness of job\nopportunities through the private sector\nleading to better utilization of the labor\nforce and increased employment.\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n", "The Federated States of Micronesia uses the US dollar as its currency.\n", "ABBREVIATIONS\n", "Asian Development Bank\nBusiness Development Council\nCollege of Micronesia\nDepartment of Economic Affairs\nDepartment of Finance and Administration\nEconomic Policy Implementation Council\nFederated States of Micronesia\nFederated States of Micronesia Development Bank\nfiscal year\ngross domestic product\nsquare kilometer\nMicronesian Entrepreneur Development Center\nnongovernment organization\nProgram-Project Implementation Unit\nPrivate Sector Development Program\npublic sector enterprise\nPublic Sector Reform Program\nSmall Business Development Center\nsmall and medium enterprises\nstatement of expenditures\ntechnical assistance\nUnited Nations Development Programme\nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization\nUnited States\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "ADB\nBDC\nCOM\nDEA\nDOF\nEPIC\nFSM\nFSMDB\nFY\nGDP\nkm2\nMEDC\nNGO\nPIU\nPSDP\nPSE\nPSRP\nSBDC\nSME\nSOE\nTA\nUNDP\nUNIDO\nUS\n", " NOTES\n", "(i) \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  ends  on  30  September.
