Initial  environmental  examinations  were  undertaken; \na summary environmental analysis is a core appendix. \n \nThe Project is designed to assist vulnerable coastal communities \nin the Eastern Province to improve livelihoods, meet basic needs, \nand strengthen community management of natural resources. The \nProject  will  also  strengthen  government  capacity  for  resource \nmanagement  and  planning.  All  project  interventions  will  be \nassessed to ensure that they support the peace building process \nand contribute to postconflict reconciliation at the community level. \nThe  core  project  area  will  cover  396  Grama  Niladhari  (GN) \ndivisions that border the open coast or major lagoon systems, with \ninitial  targeting  of  about  150  GN  divisions  identified  as  most \nvulnerable for assistance early in the Project. \n \nCoastal communities in the East are characterized by high levels \nof  poverty,  weak  and  fragmented  social  institutions,  inadequate \nand  damaged  physical  infrastructure,  and  reduced  access  to \nservices  and  markets.  The  long  period  of  conflict  has  disrupted \nlivelihoods,  resulted  in  a  loss  of  productive  assets  (fishing  boats \nand  gear)  and  household  possessions,  limited  access  to  the \nnatural  resource  base,  and  encouraged  nonsustainable  resource \nuse  practices.  Communities \nlack  social  cohesiveness,  and \ndisplacement  and  loss  of  family  members  and  property  have \ntraumatized people, thus diminishing self-reliance and motivation. \nWomen  have  been  particularly  affected  and  have  experienced \nconflict  differently  from  men.  The  conflict  has  resulted  in  a  large \nproportion of households with female heads (FHHs) without social \nacceptance and the means to earn a livelihood. \n \nInstitutional capacity at the provincial and district levels for natural \nresource  management  and  planning  is  also  extremely  limited.  In \naddition,  nonenforcement  of  environmental  rules  and  regulations \nis \nimpacts  on  coastal \ncommunities and the natural resource base upon which residents \ndepend for their livelihood. \n \nThe scale of the economic damage and social dislocation due to \nthe  conflict  has  severely  strained  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to \nprovide  development  assistance.  It  has  therefore  turned  to  the \ninternational community, particularly the Asian Development Bank  \n(ADB), for support.  \n\nincreasingly  adverse \n\nresulting \n\nin \n\n\fii \n\n \nObjectives  \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nis  sustainable \n\n \nThe goal of the Project is to reduce poverty and meet basic needs \nin  coastal  communities  in  the  three  districts  of  the  Eastern \nProvince.  The  project  purpose \nlivelihood \nimprovement  and  sound  management  of  natural  resources.  The \nmost vulnerable communities will be prioritized for support early in \nthe  Project.  Focus  will  particularly  be  on  women,  given  the  high \nnumber  of  FHHs.  The  Project  has  five  components:  sustainable \nlivelihood  improvement;  resource  management  in  three  special \nmanagement areas (SMAs\u2014Trincomalee Bay, Batticaloa Lagoon, \nand  Southern  Ampara  biodiversity  zone);  coastal  resource \nplanning;  fisheries  development;  and  project  implementation \nsupport. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $28.4  million  equivalent \ncomprising foreign exchange of $8.2 million and local currency of \n$20.2  million  equivalent.

Implementation  of \nthe  community-level  interventions  will  be  undertaken  with  the \nassistance of implementing partner nongovernment organizations \n(IP-NGOs).  \n \nGoods and services financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan \nwill  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  ADB-financed  civil  works  contracts  estimated  to \ncost  the  equivalent  of  more  than  $1.0  million  will  be  awarded  on \nthe  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB),  while  those \nvalued  at  $1.0  million  or  less  will  be  carried  out  following  the \nGovernment\u2019s \n(LCB)  procedures \nsatisfactory  to  ADB.  Supply  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the \nequivalent of more than $500,000 will be awarded on the basis of \nICB;  those  between  $500,000  and  $100,000  will  be  awarded  on \nthe basis of international shopping. Minor items costing less than \n$100,000  equivalent  may  be  procured  through  direct  purchase; \nsmall items costing less than $10,000 equivalent will be procured \nby communities under arrangements developed by the Ministry of \nFinance  for  community  development  projects  and  acceptable  to \nADB.  Notwithstanding  the  above,  the  award  of  civil  works \ncontracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $50,000 or less and \nsupply  contracts  for  equipment  and  materials  estimated  to  cost \nthe  equivalent  of  $50,000  or  less,  except  for  the  first  three  such \ncontracts  in  each  project  district,  will  be  subject  to  ADB\u2019s  post \nfacto approval procedures. \n \n\nlocal  competitive  bidding \n\n\fiv \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nto \n\nassist  with \n\nimplementing \n\nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \narrangements  satisfactory \nfor  engaging  domestic \nto  ADB \nconsultants. A team of domestic and international consultants will \nbe  engaged  to  undertake  two  categories  of  tasks:  (i)  to  provide \nproject  management  support  to  the  project  office  (PO)  and  the \ndistrict project offices (DPOs); and (ii) to advise and guide the PO, \nDPOs, and implementing agencies on technical aspects of project \nactivities  relating  to  components  1,  2,  and  3.  Outside  assistance \nwill  be  sought  in  a  number  of  other  areas:  (i)  IP-NGOs  will  be \nengaged \ncommunity-level \ninterventions  in  components  1  and  2;  (ii)  implementation  of  the \nstrategic studies for coastal resource management in the Northern \nProvince  will  be  outsourced  to  a  team  of  international  and \ndomestic  consultants;  (iii)  the  detailed  designs  and  feasibility \nstudies for the fisheries harbor rehabilitation will be contracted out \nto  qualified  international  engineering  firms;  (iv)  the  provision  of \nlivelihood  and  enterprise  development  services  (LEDS)  will  be \noutsourced to contractors; and (v) project impact assessments will \nbe carried out by outside contractors.  \n \nEconomic  benefits  will  be  generated  from  investments  in  (i) \ncommunity  infrastructure  and  environmental  improvements;  (ii) \nsustainable  livelihood  interventions;  (iii)  resource  management \nand  planning;  and  (iv)  fisheries  infrastructure.  Investments  in \ncommunity infrastructure will improve productivity and health, and \nhave \nreduce  household  medical  costs. \nEnvironmental  improvements  will  enhance  household  quality  of \nlife and sustain growth in tourism. The livelihood interventions will \nresult in incremental production of a broad range of products, with \nthe  potential  to  raise  the  incomes  of  the  poorest  households \nsubstantially at full development. Improved resource management \ninefficient  and \nwill \nenvironmentally  destructive  resource-based  activities  that  would \nhave  occurred  in  the  absence  of  the  Project.  Investments  in  the \nfisheries harbors will increase the productivity of both fishers and \nshore-based  businesses.  In  particular,  the  facilities  will  attract \nmore boats, especially multiday boats that can operate outside the \nimmediate coastline where fishing pressure is currently high, and \nwill help facilitate development of an export-based fishing industry \non the east coast. \n \nOf the approximately 110,000 households in the project area, the \nvast  majority  are  poor.  The  Project  will  target  about  40,000 \nhouseholds  judged  to  be  most  vulnerable  for  early  assistance \nthrough  social  infrastructure  and  livelihood  support  interventions, \nconcentrating the activities on households with female heads that \nare among the poorest of the poor. \n \n\nthe  economic \n\nthe  potential \n\nreduce \n\nlosses \n\nfrom \n\nto \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions \n\nv \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  a  changing  political  and \ninstitutional  environment,  and  as  such  will  face  considerable \npolitical,  institutional,  social,  and  security  risks.  With  the  ongoing \npeace  building  activities,  the  political  and  security  risks  are \nconsiderably  reduced.  However,  until  there  is  a  formal  resolution \nbetween  negotiating  parties,  these  risks  will  remain.  The  Project \nhas  a  number  of  important  design  and  implementation  features \naimed  at  managing  and  mitigating  the  other  risks,  including  (i) \nidentifying and initially prioritizing project interventions to the most \nvulnerable  communities  and  important  natural  resource  systems \nwithin  the  project  area;  (ii)  implementing  approaches  that  are \nresponsive  to  the  special  challenges  posed  by  the  post-conflict \nsituation  to  ensure  that  project  activities  do  not  widen  ethnic \ndivisions;  (iii)  providing  LEDS  to  help  ensure  that  livelihood \nimprovements  supported  under  the  Project  are  sustainable, \nequally  accessible  to  women,  and  provide  acceptable  financial \nreturns; and (iv) promoting a partnership between various levels of \ngovernment,  nongovernment  organizations,  the  private  sector, \ncommunity-based \nin \nimplementing project activities to ensure efficient service delivery. \n \n\norganizations, \n\nbeneficiaries \n\nand \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fvii \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  North  East  Coastal  Community \nDevelopment Project.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe humanitarian and economic impacts of the 20-year-long armed conflict between the \nSri  Lankan  Government  and  the  Liberation  Tigers  of  Tamil  Eelam  (LTTE)  have  been  severe. \nApproximately 2.5 million persons (nearly 15% of the population) lived in areas of direct military \nactivity. More than 60,000 persons were killed during the conflict, while another 800,000 were \ninternally  displaced,  including  about  170,000  living  in  refugee  camps.  The  Central  Bank  of  Sri \nLanka  estimates  that  the  conflict  reduced  the  country\u2019s  annual  growth  rate  by  2-3  percentage \npoints over the past two decades. The disruption of economic activity is also estimated to have \ndecreased the contribution of the North and East to national gross domestic product from 15% \nin the early 1980s to less than 4% at present. The central Government\u2019s fiscal position has also \ndeteriorated significantly and severely constrains its ability to finance development activities. \n \n3. \nThe  worst  impacts  of  the  conflict  have  been  felt  in  the  war-torn  Northern  Province  and \nEastern Province. While national poverty levels have been stable in the 20-25% range over the \npast  decade,  poverty  rates  in  the  North  and  East  (which  have  been  excluded  from  national \nstatistical  surveys  for  the  past  17  years)  are  believed  to  be  as  high  as  60%.  There  are  an \nestimated 30,000 war widows and 300,000 displaced children in the North and East where the \nschool  dropout  rate  is  twice  the  national  average.  In  addition,  the  infant  mortality  rate  in  the \nNorth  and  East  is  twice  the  national  average,  the  maternal  mortality  rate  is  three  times  the \nnational average, and virtually all malaria deaths in Sri Lanka occur in the region.  \n \n4. \nPoverty  in  the  North  and  East  is  largely  conflict  related  (Appendix  1).  While  the  direct \nloss of life has had the most dramatic impact, the conflict has also weakened the economic and \nsocial  resilience  of  the  affected  communities,  with  the  rise  of  households  headed  by  females \nbeing one of the most visible impacts. Conflict-related displacement has resulted in destruction \nor loss of assets, including housing, farm equipment, and fishing vessels/gear. Restrictions on \nmobility  and  increased  perceptions  of  risk  during  the  conflict  have  also  affected  people\u2019s \ncapacity  for  earning  a  living  as  has  loss  of  access  to  services  and  markets.  The  mobility \nrestrictions and high overall poverty levels have led to overexploitation of the natural resource \nbase and environmentally destructive resource-use practices. The displacement and destruction \nof livelihoods have in turn left many people dependent on external support for their survival.  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nLoss or impairment of livelihoods is the major cause of the high poverty levels in coastal \ncommunities in the East, where the long period of conflict resulted in loss of productive assets \n(particularly  fishing  boats  and  gear)  and  household  possessions,  and  limited  access  to  the \nnatural  resource  base.  The  people  of  the  eastern  coastal  communities  have  traditionally \ndepended directly on the resources in the marine, lagoon, and terrestrial environments for their \nsustenance  and  survival.  Dependence  on  natural  resources  is  significantly  higher  in  these \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n                                                 \n1  While  the  Project  is  primarily  focused  on  the  Eastern  Province,  some  capacity  building  for  environmental \nenforcement and a feasibility study for a possible follow on project in the Northern Province will also be undertaken. \n\n\f 2\n\ncommunities  than  in  neighboring  inland  settlements.  The  conflict  radically  altered  patterns  of \naccess to coastal ecosystems, and caused inefficiencies and direct damage that have resulted \nin waste or loss of valuable natural assets, thus disrupting traditional livelihoods. \n \n6. \nThe majority of the population in eastern coastal communities nevertheless continue to \nearn their income from fishing and farming, with the poorest groups surviving primarily through \nlow wage labor in agriculture and fisheries, and informal sector activities. An estimated 30% of \nhouseholds  in  coastal  communities  are  directly  employed  in  fishing,  against  10-15%  for  the \nprovince as a whole. Problems in the fisheries sector include restricted access to the resource \nbase due to security concerns and, partly due to this, overexploitation of nearshore coastal and \nlagoon  resources;  destruction  and  loss  of  infrastructure  (e.g.,  harbors),  vessels,  and  fishing \ngear;  monopolization  of  market  access  along  ethnic  lines;  poor  fish  handling  and  processing, \nresulting  in  high  postharvest  losses  and  low  output  values;  and  absence  of  support  services \n(credit,  research  and  extension,  and  functioning  cooperatives).  The  conflict  also  seriously \naffected  agricultural  activity  as  provision  of  agricultural  support  services  virtually  ceased  and \nproductive land became inaccessible due to access restrictions and land mines. \n \n7. \nEnvironmental  pressures,  which  were  held  somewhat  in  check  during  the  conflict, \nintensified after the initiation of the peace process in late 2001 and are also contributing to the \nhigh poverty rates in the region. In particular, the current lack of enforcement of environmental \nlaws  and  regulations  is  resulting  in  increasing  degradation  of  the  natural  resource  base.  The \ncoastal  areas  of  the  East  have  a  large  number  of  ecologically  significant  areas  that  provide \nhabitat for fish and wildlife, support rich biodiversity, create buffers against flooding and erosion, \nand provide filters to limit pollution. In addition, coastal ecosystems are the foundation of most of \nthe  region\u2019s  economic  activity,  and  have  the  potential  for  major  ecotourism  development. \nInstitutions at the provincial and district levels have limited capacity to protect the environment \nand  undertake  effective  resource  management  and  planning.  Moreover,  a  number  of  national \nagencies \nresource \nmanagement have limited capacity to undertake their functions.  \n \n8. \nAgainst this background, a key development priority for the North East Provincial Council \n(NEPC)  is  to  initiate  interventions  that  directly  assist  poor  coastal  communities  to  improve \nlivelihoods  and  meet  basic  needs.  These  interventions  are  to  be  undertaken  in  parallel  with \nactivities to improve resource management and planning, within both government and recipient \ncommunities, and to provide fisheries infrastructure to facilitate development of the local fishing \nindustry.2 A key criterion for community-based activities is that they must enhance the capacity \nof the communities to sustain any assets provided. Dependency on external support must also \nnot be increased, and communities\u2019 capacity to meet operation and maintenance (O&M) costs \nmust  be  improved.  Capacity  building  and  exit  strategies  will  therefore  be  essential  elements \nwhen preparing community-based activities. \n \n9. \nThe  Project  is  accordingly  focused  on  assisting  vulnerable  coastal  communities  in \nimproving  livelihoods,  meeting  basic  needs,  and  strengthening  the  management  of  natural \nresources.  As  an  investment  loan,  the  Project  moves  beyond  the  provision  of  emergency \nassistance to development of interventions that provide an enabling environment for people to \ntake  advantage  of  the  economic  opportunities  afforded  by  the  peace  process.  In  addition,  the \nProject draws lessons from ongoing interventions in the North and East in assisting vulnerable \npeople  in  regaining  productive  lives.  In  particular,  a  process  approach  has  been  adopted  to \npermit  flexible  adjustment  of  project  design  during  implementation.  This  will  be  particularly \n\nfor  environmental  protection  and  natural \n\nthat  have  responsibility \n\n                                                 \n2  There  is  an  abundant  large  pelagic  fish  resource  off  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  east  coast,  particularly  tuna.  A  recent  study \n\nsuggests that less than half of the potential sustainable yield of this resource is currently being harvested.  \n\n\f  3\n\nimportant  in  the  present  context,  given  that  the  security  environment  is  still  very  fluid  and  that \nmost  local  people  remain  traumatized  by  the  conflict.  Other  important  lessons  include \nrecognition  of  (i)  the  need  to  ensure  that  a  balance  is  maintained  in  project  activities  among \nethnic  groups;  (ii)  the  need  to  undertake  activities  in  both  government-controlled  and  LTTE-\ncontrolled  areas;  (iii)  the  limited  implementation  capacity  of  local  government  institutions;  and \n(iv) the critical need to coordinate the large number of projects in the North and East. \n \nThe  Project  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy.3  In  addition,  in \n10. \nthe  poverty  partnership  agreement,  the  Government  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nhave  agreed  that  ADB  will  assist  in  addressing  conflict-related  poverty.4  Moreover,  ADB\u2019s \nCountry  Strategy  and  Program  endorses  the  Government\u2019s  priority  to  reduce  poverty  and \nfacilitate  the  development  of  sustainable  natural  resource  management  systems  so  as  to \nimprove  livelihoods  and  support  sustainable  long-term  economic  growth.  Finally,  the  Project \naddresses  key  priorities  as  identified  in  the  recently  completed  Assessment  of  Needs  in  the \nConflict Affected Areas undertaken jointly by ADB, United Nations Development Program, and \nWorld  Bank,  and  complements  well  planned  and  ongoing  assistance  from  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners (Appendix 2).  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \nA. \n \n11. \nThe  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  reduce  poverty  and  meet  basic  needs  in  coastal \ncommunities in three districts (Trincomalee, Batticaloa, and Ampara) of Eastern Province. The \npurpose  is  sustainable  livelihood  improvement  and  sound  management  of  natural  resources. \nThe core project area comprises the 396 Grama Niladhari (GN) divisions5 in the province on the \nopen coast and around major lagoons and is delineated based on the linkages between coastal \ncommunities  and  the  natural  resource  base  on  which  they  depend  for  their  livelihoods.  The \nproject area has a population of about 550,000 out of a total of 1.5 million in Eastern Province.6 \nThe project beneficiaries include fishers, fisher-agriculturalists, small farmers, landless laborers, \nand  small  entrepreneurs.  There  will  be  a  special  focus  on  women  as  the  most  disadvantaged \namong this target group (Appendix 3). \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe  Project  comprises  five  components:  sustainable  livelihood  improvement;  resource \nmanagement in three special management areas (SMAs); coastal resource planning; fisheries \ndevelopment; and project implementation support. The project framework is in Appendix 4. \n \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nSustainable Livelihood Improvement \n\n \n13. \nSustainable  livelihood  improvement,  which  will  be  equally  accessible  to  men  and \nwomen,  will  focus  on  activities  in  agriculture,  fisheries,  agroforestry,  and  related  enterprises \nservicing and adding value to these subsectors. Appropriate nontraditional livelihoods, including \n                                                 \n3  Government of Sri Lanka. 2002.

Colombo. \n\nthe Asian Development Bank. Colombo. \n\npopulation limit set at 250 families. \n\n6  The ethnic composition of the coastal area differs markedly from that of the Eastern Province as a whole: 3% of the \npopulation  in  coastal  GN  divisions  are  Sinhalese,  38%  are  Tamil,  and  59%  are  Muslim,  versus  about  25% \nSinhalese, 40% Tamil, and 35% Muslim for the entire province. \n\n\f 4\n\ntourism  and  waste  management,  will  also  be  supported.  In  undertaking  the  livelihood  support \nactivities,  emphasis  will  be  on  developing  livelihood  clusters\u2014linkages  between  supply  of  raw \nmaterials  and  value-added  production,  and  access  to  transport  and  marketing  facilities\u2014to \nensure  the  sustainability  and  financial  viability  of  the  interventions.  There  will  be  separate \nclusters for women. Livelihood and enterprise development services (LEDS) will be provided to \nfacilitate identification of market opportunities, relevant technology transfer, small business and \nentrepreneurship  training,  provision  of  mentoring  support,  and  development  of  livelihood \nclusters.7 The livelihood improvement activities will be financed through a microfinance delivery \nsystem established under the Project. \n \n14. \nAfter  a  comprehensive  needs  assessment,  support  will  be  provided  at  the  community \nlevel  to  meet  basic  needs  through  small-scale  infrastructure.  Community  infrastructure \ninterventions  eligible  for  funding  include  the  construction  and  rehabilitation  of  minor  roads, \nculverts,  drains,  small-scale  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  simple  solid  waste \nmanagement  schemes,  and  community  buildings  (e.g.,  multipurpose  buildings,  including  day \ncare and playground facilities).8 Fishing communities that meet predetermined selection criteria \nwill also be eligible to receive simple fisheries support infrastructure, including net repair sheds, \nmarket/auction  halls, \nfacilities.  The  community \ninfrastructure interventions, including the fisheries infrastructure, will be assessed and selected \non  the  basis  of  specific  social  and  environmental  criteria  (Appendix  5).  The  recipient \ncommunities  themselves  will  manage  and  maintain  the  infrastructure  facilities,  which  will  be \nfinanced directly by the Project. \n \n15. \nLivelihood  support  and  community  infrastructure  provision  will  initially  focus  on  GN \ndivisions identified as the poorest and most vulnerable. In the absence of reliable statistical data \non  poverty  and  livelihoods,  proxy  data  combined  with  qualitative  information  were  used  to \nidentify  146  of  the  396  GN  divisions  in  the  project  area  (Appendix  5).  In  total,  about  225  GN \ndivisions  are  expected  to  receive  support  under  the  Project.  Small  but  extremely  poor  and \nmarginalized  communities  of  coastal  indigenous  people  also  reside  within  the  vulnerable  GN \ndivisions. A separate set of livelihood interventions will be developed to ensure that their specific \nneeds are addressed in a socially sensitive manner.9 \n \n\nfisher  rest  houses,  and  cold  storage \n\n2. \n\nResource Management in Three Special Management Areas (SMAs) \n\nThree  SMAs\u2014Trincomalee  Bay,  Batticaloa  Lagoon,  and \n\n \n16. \nthe  Southern  Ampara \nbiodiversity zone\u2014were selected for interventions to improve natural resource management and \naddress  acute  environmental  problems.  These  objectives  are  important  as  most  economic \nactivity  in  the  SMAs  depends  heavily  on  the  natural  resource  base.  The  three  SMAs  were \nselected  on  the  basis  of  environmental  and  ecological  criteria  such  as  significant  natural \n\n                                                 \n7  The  rationale  for  providing  these  services  is  based  on  the  observation  that  the  vast  majority  of  potential \nbeneficiaries  lack  technical  and  market  information,  business  skills,  access  to  financial  services,  and  market \nlinkages.  The  envisaged  approach  to  provision  of  LEDS  has  worked  well  under  the  ongoing  ADB-financed \nSouthern Province Rural Economic Advancement Project. \n\n8  The  Project  seeks  to  meet  the  immediate  basic  needs  of  the  selected  communities.  Assistance  for  larger \ninfrastructure  works  is  being  provided  under  the  ADB-financed  North  East  Community  Restoration  and \nDevelopment  Project  (NECORD)  and  the  World  Bank-financed  North  East  Irrigated  Agriculture  Project  (NEIAP). \nAssistance in the social areas\u2014such as in community nutrition and health\u2014is being provided by bilateral sources. \n9  There are small communities of such people (coastal Veddas) in Batticaloa and Trincomalee districts. Most Veddas \nrefrain from acknowledging their identity due to social stigmatization by neighboring communities. The Project will \nevaluate  their  status  through  a  culturally  sensitive  participatory  needs  assessment  to  identify  priority  areas  for \ninterventions.  These  could  include  construction  of  community  infrastructure  as  well  as  improving  incomes,  while \nmaintaining their seminomadic livelihoods in fishing, and hunting and gathering.  \n\n\f  5\n\nresource systems where a very high proportion of the local population obtain livelihoods. Their \ndefining features are as follows: \n \n\nTrincomalee Bay. The bay is a large natural harbor and has significant potential \nfor  economic  development.  Currently,  major  areas  of  localized  pollution, \nshoreline erosion, and coastal resource degradation are affecting livelihoods. \n\nBatticaloa Lagoon. The lagoon is a critical natural resource area and provides \nlivelihoods  for  a  very  large  proportion  of  the  local  population.  It  is  also \necologically and environmentally significant, and is at risk from overexploitation of \nits resource base and shore-based pollution entering the lagoon system. \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nSouthern  Ampara  biodiversity  zone.  Key  resource  issues  within  this  SMA \ninclude  nonsustainable  practices  by  resource  users  (e.g.,  sand  mining  and \ndynamite  fishing),  lack  of  effective  management  of  ecologically  sensitive  areas, \nand an absence of integrated management of sanctuary areas.10 The area also \nhas significant potential for tourism development. \n\n \n17. \nThe Project will provide assistance to carry out resource mapping and identify resource \nmanagement  problems  (i.e.,  environmental  hot  spots)  that  affect  livelihoods  and  the  quality  of \nlife  at  the  community  level  within  the  SMAs.  Typical  hot  spots  include  areas  of  mangrove \ndestruction, sand and coral mining, and uncontrolled solid waste dumping. The Project will help \nimplement  selected  community-based  resource  management  interventions  to  address  these \nproblems,  including  mangrove  replanting,  solid  waste  management,  introduction  of  alternative \nenergy  sources  (such  as  solar  power),  and  implementation  of  public  awareness  programs.  In \naddition,  the  Project  will  support  habitat  conservation  activities,  such  as  demarcation  of \nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas  and  formation  of  local  resource  management  groups.  The \nresource  management  interventions  at  the  community  level  will  be  closely  linked  to  the \nlivelihood support activities in component 1 to ensure the sustainability of the latter.  \n \n18. \nResource  mapping  at  the  community  level  will  be  consolidated  and  further  elaborated \ninto  SMA  plans  that  address  key  resource  management  issues  and  acute  environmental \nproblems.  The  district-level  SMA  plans  may  identify  the  need  to  implement  environmental \ninterventions  at  a  scale  above  the  community  level,  for  example,  solid  waste  management \nschemes or remedial measures to mitigate the effects of sand mining, which will involve several \nGN divisions. This would entail identifying suitable implementation partners, and formulating and \nimplementing  sustainable  intervention  strategies.  Whenever  possible,  these  larger-scale \ninterventions will be linked to the community-based interventions described earlier. All resource \nmanagement  interventions,  including  community-level  interventions,  will  be  assessed  and \nselected on the basis of specific criteria (Appendix 5). \n \n\n3. \n\nCoastal Resource Planning \n\n \n19. \nA  coastal  resource  management  plan  for  the  Eastern  Province  will  be  prepared  to \nestablish a consistent framework for provincial coastal resource planning and management. The \nplan,  among  others,  will  encompass  shoreline  management  and  tourism  development  in  the \ncoastal zone. The plan will link up with, and have application to, other associated development \nand  sector  plans,  including  the  national  coastal  zone  plan.  Assistance  will  be  provided  to \nimplementation  of  zoning)  and \nimprove  systems \n\nfor  resource  management  (including \n\n                                                 \n10  A  sanctuary  is  the  lowest  form  of  protection  enforcement  under  the  Department  of  Wildlife  Conservation,  where \n\nprivate land ownership, human settlements, and economic activities are permitted. \n\n\f 6\n\nenforcement of relevant environmental laws and regulations, and to strengthen the capacity of \nthe relevant agencies in the province to implement such systems. A study on coastal resource \nmanagement issues in the Northern Province that could form the basis of a follow-on investment \nsimilar to the Project will also be supported under this component. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  capacity  of  local  government  agencies  to  undertake \n20. \nplanning,  coordinate  aid  agency  interventions,  prepare  natural  resource  management  plans, \nand efficiently integrate these plans into specific sector and overall development plans. These \noutcomes will be achieved through institutional capacity building with staff training at provincial, \ndistrict,  and  divisional  levels;  and  investing  in  equipment  to  improve  existing  database \nmanagement systems, incorporating gender-disaggregated information where appropriate. The \npreparation  of  community  resource  management  plans  in  component  2  will  also  contribute  to \nimproved coastal resource planning. \n \n\n4. \n\nFisheries Development \n\n \nThis component will support the development of a more efficient and productive fishing \n21. \nindustry on the east coast by rehabilitating the two major fisheries harbor facilities found there: \nValaichchenai and Cod Bay. The Project will also support private sector participation in onshore \ncommercial  activities  at  the  two  harbor  facilities.  Training  programs  aimed  at  improving  fish \nhandling and processing methods will be conducted for fishing industry participants. \n \n22. \nThe  fisheries  harbor  facilities  in  Valaichchenai  were  badly  damaged  during  the  conflict \nand  have  been  closed  since  1990.  The  following  activities  are  proposed:  improve  the  sea \nentrance and the harbor access channel; provide mooring and boat lifting facilities; improve the \nfish-landing  wharf;  rehabilitate  existing  buildings;  provide  fire-fighting  and  first  aid  facilities; \nrehabilite  roads  and  parking  areas;  and  provide  additional  utilities  and  services  (e.g.,  power \nsupply, garbage collection, ice, and radio communication). The facilities at the only functioning \nfisheries harbor on the east coast at Cod Bay deteriorated significantly during the conflict period \nand  will  also  be  upgraded.  Development  activities  at  this  site  include  extending  the  waterfront \n(fish landing wharf and jetty), improving the slipway, and providing some onshore facilities (for \nrepairs,  flaked  ice,  cold  storage,  and  other  services).11  The  improved  facilities  at  the  two  sites \nwill  allow  safe  moorings  and  sea  access  year  round  for  vessels  (particularly  multiday  boats), \nspeed up refueling and provisioning, and permit more efficient and hygienic fish handling. The \nshorter turnaround time in port and better handling will in turn minimize waste and improve the \noverall quality of the fish catch. \n \n23. \nPhysical  improvement  at  the  two  harbor  facilities  will  be  preceded  by  an  in-depth \npreparation phase in which stakeholders will be consulted to revalidate the needs assessment \nundertaken during project preparation. The consultation process in both locations will proceed in \nphases and give careful attention to the distribution of benefits among the local Tamil, Muslim, \nand  Sinhalese  communities  to  ensure  the  social  viability  of  the  proposed  activities.  The \nstakeholder consultation process will be followed by full feasibility studies, detailed engineering \ndesigns,  and  preparation  of  tender  documents.  To  avoid  any  possible  scope  for  resettlement \nimpacts, the rehabilitation activities at Valaichchenai will be confined to the current harbor area. \nPhysical  implementation  of  rehabilitation  works  is  scheduled  to  begin  during  year  2  in \nValaichchenai and year 5 in Cod Bay.  \n \n                                                 \n11 To ensure that the rehabilitation of Cod Bay is consistent with the planned long-term development of Trincomalee \nBay,  the  rehabilitation  work  will  only  be  initiated  after  the  completion  and  adoption  of  a  comprehensive \ndevelopment plan for the area. For this reason, the rehabilitation of Cod Bay is planned for the second half of the \nproject period. An alternative site has been identified in the event it is decided not to proceed with Cod Bay. \n\n\f  7\n\n24. \nImproper  handling  has  contributed  to  the  poor  quality  of  fish  and  fish  products  on  the \neast  coast.  Training  and  awareness  programs  covering  improved  fish  handling  and  onboard \nstorage  methods,  as  well  as  improved  processing  and  marketing  methods,  will  therefore  be \nconducted for fishing industry participants\u2014fishers, boat owners, processors, and traders. This \nis critical to the development of an export-oriented fishing industry, as raw material procurement \nand  processing  have  to  conform  to  stringent  international  quality  standards  and  regulations. \nMaintenance  of  the  quality  of  the  fish  catch  is  a  particular  area  of  concern  because  of  the \nincreasing fleet of multiday boats, which access the offshore fishing grounds. \n \n\n5. \n\nProject Implementation Support \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n25. \nThis  component  includes  establishment  and  operation  of  management  and  monitoring \nsystems to support timely and cost-effective project implementation. It will consist of provision of \nproject  and  financial  management  support;  engagement  of  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs)  and  other  service  providers,  especially  those  with  a  particular  focus  on  women; \nprocurement  of  equipment,  supplies  and  materials;  and  the  establishment  of  accounting, \nauditing,  monitoring  and  reporting  systems.  An  impact  assessment  framework,  and  an \ninformation,  education  and  communication  (IEC)  system,  will  also  be  established.  The  IEC \nstrategy  and  plan  seeks  to  (i)  provide  easy  access  to  the  most  current  project  information;  (ii) \ninitiate  and  guide  awareness  campaigns,  events,  and  training;  and  (iii)  establish  efficient \ninformation and communications mechanisms among project implementation partners and with \nother relevant development initiatives. \n \nC. \n \n26. \nThe Project has a number of important design and implementation features to address \nthe special needs of the project area. These include (i) identifying and initially prioritizing project \ninterventions to the most vulnerable communities and important natural resource systems within \nthe  project  area;  (ii)  implementing  approaches  that  are  responsive  to  the  special  challenges \nposed by the postconflict situation to ensure that project activities do not widen ethnic divisions; \n(iii) providing LEDS to help ensure the livelihood improvements supported under the Project are \nsustainable,  give  equal  access  to  women,  and  provide  acceptable  financial  returns;  and  (iv) \nforming  a  partnership  between  various  levels  of  government,  NGOs,  the  private  sector, \ncommunity based organizations (CBOs), and beneficiaries in project activities. The Project will \nadopt a gender strategy to address the specific concerns and needs of women (Appendix 3). \n \nA  variety  of  approaches  have  been  integrated  into  the  design  and  implementation \n27. \narrangements to ensure that the project interventions strengthen peace building and contribute \nto community reconciliation. Community consultation and participation are at the core of project \nplanning and implementation so that potential constraints on project activities and interventions \ncan be identified and dealt with effectively at an early stage. Activities will be phased so that the \nProject  can  adapt  to  the  evolving  peace  process.  A  \u201cdo  no  harm\u201d  approach  will  be  applied  so \nthat  negotiated  solutions  can  be  found  for  any  activity  that  could  widen  divisions  within \ncommunities,  or  fuel  further  conflict.  The  ethnic  composition  of  the  project  area  will  also  be \ntaken into account in identifying beneficiaries for specific project interventions. All major project \ndocuments  (including  recruitment  announcements  and  tender  notices)  will  be  translated  and \nmade available in the three official languages. Agreed upon implementation procedures will also \nensure that criteria and procedures for selecting beneficiaries and implementation partners, and \nawarding contracts are entirely transparent to avoid any perception of resource misuse. \n \n28. \nThe  provision  of  LEDS  will  help  project  beneficiaries  to  (i)  identify  and  assess  market \nopportunities  for  different  products,  services,  and  enterprises;  (ii)  identify  environmentally \n\n\ffriendly  and  appropriate  technology  alternatives;  and  (iii)  prepare  business  plans  for  proposed \nenterprises.  The  provision  of  LEDS  will  be  facilitated  by  (i)  specialized  training  in  enterprise-\nrelated technical and managerial aspects; (ii) linking small-scale entrepreneurs with successful \nlarger-scale  entrepreneurs  through  a  mentoring  program;  and  (iii)  implementing  programs  to \nintroduce  new  technologies.  The  concept  is  to  link  private  sector  entities  and  NGOs  currently \nproviding  such  services  to  potential  beneficiaries.  An  integral  LEDS  function  will  be  to  take \naffirmative action toward empowering women entrepreneurs. \n \n29. \nProject  activities  will  be  programmed  and  implemented  at  the  district  level  and  below, \nwith  coordination  taking  place  at  the  provincial level.  Implementation  will  involve  a  partnership \nbetween  local  NGOs  selected  according  to  specified  criteria  in  each  district  and  the  district \nplanning  offices,  while  NGOs  with  specialist  skills,  other  local  government  agencies,  and  the \nproject consultant team will provide technical support as required. The focus will be on building \nthe capacity of the local government and implementing partner NGOs (IP-NGOs), as well as the \nbeneficiary communities themselves, which are the focal point for service delivery. At least one \nIP-NGO in each district will be a women\u2019s NGO.12 \n \nD. \n \n30. \nThe total project cost (including interest during implementation, taxes, and physical and \nprice contingencies) is estimated at $28.4 million equivalent, comprising $8.2 million in foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $20.2  million  equivalent  in  local  currency.

The Borrower will be the Democratic Socialist \nRepublic of Sri Lanka. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years. The loan will carry an interest charge of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter to be paid semiannually. Government counterpart financing will be required in \nthe amount of $5.6 million and the project beneficiaries\u2019 contribution is estimated at $1.3 million. \nBilateral parallel cofinancing of $1.5 million will be provided on a grant basis by the Government \nof  the  Netherlands  to  support  capacity  building  in  environmental  protection  and  monitoring \nactivities. The financing plan is outlined in Table 2. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \nF. \n \n\nSource of Financing \n\nADB \nGov\u2019t. of the Netherlands \nBeneficiaries \nGov\u2019t. of Sri Lanka \nTotal \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nForeign \nExchange \n7.8 \n0.4 \n- \n- \n8.2 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n12.2 \n  1.1 \n  1.3 \n  5.6 \n20.2 \n\nTotal \nCost \n20.0 \n  1.5 \n  1.3 \n  5.6 \n 28.4 \n\n% \n\n70 \n  5 \n  5 \n20 \n       100 \n\n1. \n\nProject Management and Coordination \n\n \n32. \nThe  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  Provincial  Councils,  and  Local  Government  (MHAPCLG) \nwill  be  the  Executing  Agency.  MHAPCLG  will  report  on  project  financial  and  implementation \nperformance. The NEPC will be the lead Implementing Agency (IA) and will be responsible for \noverall project coordination under a project implementation agreement (PIA) acceptable to ADB. \nThe  Ceylon  Fisheries  Harbor  Corporation  (CFHC)  will  be  the  IA  for  the  fisheries  harbor \nrehabilitation  under  a  PIA  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  National  Development  Trust  Fund  (NDTF) \nwill manage and coordinate the Project\u2019s $4.0 million credit line under a PIA and subsidiary loan \nagreement  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  Central  Environmental  Authority  (CEA)  will  implement  the \nproject  activities  financed  by  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands.13  A  provincial-level \ncoordinating committee, chaired by the chief secretary of NEPC, will be established for project \ncoordination,  direction,  and  guidance.  The  coordinating  committee  will  initially  meet  monthly, \nand will include representatives from all implementing organizations, including the CEA, as well \nas a representative from the NGO sector.14 A national-level steering committee chaired by the \nsecretary  of  MHAPCLG  has  been  established  to  facilitate  coordination  between  all  projects \nimplemented  in  the  North  and  East  that  are  executed  by  MHAPCLG  and  to  address  project-\nrelated issues of national significance. \n \n\n                                                 \n13 The specific project activities to be financed by parallel cofinancing have been mutually agreed upon by the CEA, \n\nthe Government of the Netherlands, and ADB. \n\n14 This will be covered by the Consortium of Humanitarian Agencies, which is an association of agencies supporting \n\ndevelopment work in Sri Lanka. \n\n\f 10\n\n33. \nA  project  office  (PO)  will  be  established  within  the  Provincial  Ministry  of  Agriculture \n(PMA)15 and will be headed by a suitably qualified project director (PD) to oversee day-to-day \nimplementation of the Project. Project offices will also be established at the district level within \nthe  district  secretariats  (DS)  and  will  be  headed  by  suitably  qualified  deputy  project  directors \n(DPDs). The PD and DPDs will be selected and appointed in accordance with the Government\u2019s \nprocedures for recruiting project staff for foreign-assisted projects, acceptable to ADB. They will \nbe  assisted  by  an  adequate  number  of  support  staff,  also  recruited  in  accordance  with  the \naforementioned procedures. The Project will be implemented with the assistance of the existing \ndistrict  coordinating  committees  (DCCs)  and  divisional  coordinating  committee  (DVCCs).  A \nproject organization chart is in Appendix 7. \n \n34. \nProject loan funds for NEPC will be routed through MHAPCLG in an arrangement similar \nto that adopted under other foreign funded projects in the North and East, e.g., the World Bank-\nsupported  North  East  Emergency  Reconstruction  Program  (NEERP)  and  the  ADB-supported \nNECORD project. The Treasury will release funds directly to the NEPC and debit the amounts \naccordingly from the budget line item for MHAPCLG. The direct transfer of funds will expedite \ndisbursement,  while  formal  routing  through  MHAPCLG  will  ensure  fiduciary  oversight  at  the \ncentral Government level. A Department of Budget circular regarding the transfer of funds under \nNECORD provides the precedent for this disbursement mechanism.  \n \nThe  Government  and  the  LTTE  plan  to  negotiate  a  transitional  administration  for  the \n35. \nNorth and East. Once the institutional mechanisms have been agreed upon, it will be necessary \nto  operationalize  its  workings,  introduce  appropriate  financial  controls,  and  define  new \nadministrative procedures. Until such time, the existing administrative mechanisms will continue \nto  operate,  and  the  NEPC  and  local  government  agencies  falling  under  its  jurisdiction  will \nimplement  the  Project  as  set  out  below.  The  Loan  Agreement  provides  for  prior  consultation \nwith and approval of ADB on any changes in administrative responsibilities under the Project. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Components \n\n \n\na. \n\nSustainable Livelihood Improvement \n\nrelevant  DVCC \n\nfor  clearance.  The  DVCC  will  be  chaired  by \n\n \nThe  community  infrastructure  interventions  will  be  implemented  with  the  assistance  of \n36. \nlocal IP-NGOs contracted under the Project. The criteria established for NGO selection are set \nout  in  Appendix  5.  The  IP-NGOs  will  help  communities  identify  and  prioritize  their  needs,  and \nprepare subproject concept proposals in a standard format.16 The proposals will be submitted to \nthe  divisional \nthe \nsecretary/divisional  assistant  director  of  planning,  and  will  include  the  divisional  environmental \nofficer (DEO) and IP-NGOs. If the proposal requires a more detailed technical assessment, the \nDVCC  will  have  the  authority  to  request  such  assistance  from  the  project  consultant  team. \nDepending  on  the  nature  and  scope  of  the  subproject,  clearance  may  be  required  from  the \nrelevant  government  approving  agency  (e.g.,  CEA,  Coastal  Conservation  Department  [CCD], \netc.).17 Once cleared, the subproject proposal will be resubmitted to the DVCC for final approval. \nThe subproject proponent (e.g., the recipient communities themselves in the case of community \n                                                 \n15 The PMA\u2019s functions are most closely aligned with the range of livelihood support interventions under the Project. \n\nSpecifically, the PMA oversees activities in agriculture, fisheries, and food processing. \n\n16  A  number  of  potential  IP-NGOs  are  already  providing  community  infrastructure  in  the  Eastern  province.  Simple, \nlow-cost  designs  utilizing  locally  available  building  materials  have  been  developed  for  basic  infrastructure \nprototypes, which will be adopted by the Project. As such, the development approach envisaged is considered to \nbe cost effective and appropriate in the local context. \n\n17 Clearance  will also be required through the District Mine Action Committees before any community development \nactivities  can  be  initiated.  Project  funds  have  been  allocated  for  mine  surveys  and  removal  in  the  event  this  is \nnecessary. \n\n\f  11\n\ninfrastructure)  will  be  responsible  for  implementation,  with  the  assistance  of  the  IP-NGOs  and \nthe project consultant team. Monitoring and oversight will be undertaken by the DCC, chaired by \nthe district secretary, with membership from relevant government agencies, NGO consortia, and \nthe private sector.18 \n \nThe  IP-NGOs  will  also  help  households  identify  viable  livelihood  activities  in  fisheries, \n37. \nagriculture,  agroforestry  and  a  range  of  nontraditional  activities  in  cooperation  with  the  LEDS \nproviders.19  The  livelihood  support  activities  will  be  financed  through  a  microfinance  delivery \nsystem established under the Project. Consistent with the approach developed under the ADB-\nfinanced  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development  Program  (RFSDP),  the  NDTF  will  serve  as  the \napex agency for channeling credit to participating institutions that meet predetermined eligibility \ncriteria. The criteria adopted will be consistent with those under RFSDP. Further details are in \nAppendix  8.  The  credit  scheme  will  operate  initially  through  local  microfinance  NGOs  (MF-\nNGOs),  and  will  expand  to  a  broader  range  of  financial  institutions  including  cooperative  rural \nbanks  and  commercial  banks,  once  the  delivery  system  has  developed.  The  strategy  is  to \nprovide  smaller  loans  for  livelihood  improvement  and  enterprise  development  early  in  the \nProject, and move up to larger loans and enterprises later on. \n \n\nb. \n\nResource Management in Three SMAs \n\n \nImplementation  of  community-based  resource  mapping  and  resource  management \n38. \ninterventions  will  be  facilitated  by  the  IP-NGOs  contracted  under  the  Project.  As  in  the \ncommunity infrastructure interventions described in para. 36, the IP-NGOs will help communities \nidentify and prioritize resource management interventions, and prepare subproject proposals in \na  standard  format.  The  proposals  will  be  submitted  to  the  relevant  DVCC  for  clearance  and \nfunding  on  a  grant  basis.  Implementation  progress  will  be  monitored  by  the  DCCs.  The  IP-\nNGOs  will  also  facilitate  the  linkage  of  resource  mapping  at  the  community  level  with \npreparation of SMA plans at district level. \n \n39. \nIntegrated planning and subsequent management of the SMAs at the district level will be \nundertaken  through  SMA  committees.  The  committees  will  be  established  by  the  relevant  DS \nand will comprise representatives from the district departments and statutory bodies, municipal \ngovernments,  IP-NGOs,  the  private  sector,  and  civil  society.  The  main  functions  of  the \ncommittees will be to (i) approve the work plan and budget for preparing an SMA management \nplan; (ii) ensure that an adequate consultation process is followed; and (iii) provide overall policy \nguidance. Technical assistance will be provided to the committees as needed by the consultant \nnatural  resource  planners.  Once  finalized,  the  SMA  plans  will  be  submitted  to  their  respective \nDCCs for endorsement.  \n \n40. \nThe  SMA  plans  will  also  identify  priority  larger-scale  environmental  interventions  for \nimplementation  under  the  Project.  Any  technical  assistance  that  may  be  required  to  formulate \nproject  proposals  and  implementation  arrangements  will  be  provided  by  the  project  consultant \nteam or the contractors engaged to provide LEDS. The proposed interventions must clear the \n\n                                                 \n18 The DCCs will meet monthly to review implementation progress. Representatives from the three main stakeholder \ngroups (Government, private sector, and NGOs) from the two other districts will attend the monthly DCC meetings \nin each district on a revolving basis to enhance transparency. \n\n19 Organizations such as the Integrated Technology Development Group (ITDG), the Agromart Foundation (AF), and \nSarvodaya Economic Enterprise Development Services (SEEDS) will be contracted to provide LEDS. The ITDG is \na  United  Kingdom-based  NGO  that  has  established  an  independent  national  NGO  in  Sri  Lanka  that  works  to \ndisseminate  appropriate  technology.  The  AF  is  a  national  NGO  that  seeks  to  empower  the  poor  through \nentrepreneurship  training,  with  a  strong  focus  on  women.  SEEDS  is  a  national  microfinance  NGO  with  a  well-\ndeveloped microenterprise advisory unit. \n\n\f 12\n\n \n\nc. \n\nCoastal Resource Planning \n\nrelevant  environmental  screening  procedures  and  receive  prior  approval  from  the  DCC  before \nimplementation. These subprojects will be financed on a grant basis. \n \n \n \nThe  provincial  planning  secretariat  (PPS)  will  be  the  focal  point  for  implementing  the \n41. \ncoastal resource planning and capacity building activities at the provincial, district, and divisional \nlevels.  A  consultant  resource  planner  and  short-term  experts  covering  a  range  of  areas, \nincluding database management systems and tourism planning, will support the PPS. Specific \nresource assessments will be outsourced on a case-by-case basis depending on the needs that \nemerge  in  the  course  of  the  data  collection  and  planning  exercises.  A  provincial  inter-agency \nplanning group will be established to ensure coordinated input by the relevant agencies involved \nin resource-based planning activities, particularly preparation of the provincial coastal resource \nmanagement  plans.  The  planning  group  will  be  chaired  by  the  deputy  chief  secretary  of \nplanning,  and  will  include  the  following  agencies:  Urban  Development  Authority,  Ministry  of \nTourism,  Sri  Lanka  Tourist  Board,  Sri  Lanka  Ports  Authority,  CFHC,  CCD,  Fisheries \nDepartment,  CEA,  National  Aquatic  Resource  Agency,  Department  of  Wildlife  Conservation, \nForestry  Department,  and  the  Sri  Lankan  Navy.  National  agencies  that  do  not  have  provincial \nrepresentation  will  establish  operational  functions  in  the  region.  The  SMA  committees  will \nprovide  the  link  between  community-based  planning  efforts  and  planning  activities  at  higher \ninstitutional levels.  \n \n42. \nImplementing  strengthened  enforcement  procedures  will  require  active  community \nparticipation  as  well  as  the  support  of  the  relevant  agencies.  Activities  related  to  enforcement \nprocedures will involve information dissemination and public consultation, and will build on the \noutputs of community-based planning efforts. The Project will also strengthen the regional and \nsubregional offices of the CEA in the North and East,20 which will have overall responsibility for \nenvironmental  monitoring  under  the  Project,  and  facilitate  establishment  of  effective  links  and \ncollaboration with the NEPC. Specific project activities in this regard, which will be financed by \nthe Government of the Netherlands, include training the DEOs and other relevant government \nofficials, installing an accredited environmental testing laboratory in the region, and providing a \nmobile environmental monitoring unit. The strategic study for coastal resource management in \nthe Northern Province, which will also be financed by the Government of the Netherlands, will \nbe outsourced by CEA to outside experts. This will be done in close coordination with NEPC. \n \n\nd. \n\nFisheries Development \n\n43. \nCFHC  will  be  responsible  for  rehabilitating  the  fisheries  harbors  in  Valaichchenai  and \nCod Bay and managing the rehabilitated facilities. This will include (i) overseeing the conduct of \nfeasibility  studies  and  preparing  detailed  engineering  designs,  quantities,  cost  estimates,  and \ntender  documents;  (ii)  awarding  construction  works;  (iii)  supervising  contractors  during \nimplementation;  and  (iv)  implementing  appropriate  O&M  practices  in  the  rehabilitated  harbors. \nCFHC  will  also  take  the  lead  in  organizing  the  stakeholder  consultation  process  for  the  two \nharbor facilities. \n \n44. \nCFHC  will  carry  out  operation  and  management  under  the  policies  set  out  in  its \nCorporate  Plan  2003-2007,  which  are  considered  adequate  to  ensure  cost  recovery  and \nefficient  operation  of  the  rehabilitated  harbor  facilities.21  Under  the  Project,  fishery  harbor \n                                                 \n20 The CEA is establishing a regional office in Trincomalee with subregional offices in Ampara and Jaffna. \n21  The  CFHC  owns  and  operates  all  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  fishing  harbors  and  currently  recovers  O&M  costs  through  a \nsystem of berthage fees. CFHC has developed a new catch weight-based \u201cport gate\u201d levy on fish moving through \nits harbor facilities that will substantially improve its financial performance. \n\n\f  13\n\nmanagement  staff  will  be  trained  to  support  improved  management  and  monitoring  of  the  fish \ncatch.22  Efforts  will  also  be  made  to  secure  fishers\u2019  participation  in  improving  harbor \nmanagement  and  operations,  as  well  as  in  building  a  monitoring  mechanism.  Facilities  for \nonshore commercial activities will be leased out to the private sector on a competitive basis in \nline with current government policy. \n \n45. \nThe PO will organize the fisheries training activities and awareness campaigns, with the \nassistance  of  the  project  consultant  team.  These  programs  will  be  developed  in  close \ncooperation  with  existing  fisheries  training  institutes  and  private  sector  initiatives.  The  Project \nwill also draw upon relevant training materials and programs developed under the CRMP. \n \n\ne. \n\nProject Implementation Support \n\n \nThe PO will establish and operate project management and monitoring systems with the \n46. \nsupport  of  the  DPOs.  Project  and  financial  management  specialists  will  be  recruited  at  the \nprovincial level and for each DPO to establish effective management and monitoring systems. \nThe project consultant team will implement the IEC services, while the contractors will carry out \nthe project impact assessments. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n47. \nThe Project will be implemented over 6 years (Appendix 9). Year 1 will involve setting up \nthe  project  management  and  implementation  framework,  and  various  other  preparatory  tasks. \nThe  latter  includes  (i)  preparing  work  and  financial  plans;  (ii)  procuring  goods  and  services \n(consultants, IP-NGOs, and other service providers); (iii) designing and installing a management \ninformation  system;  and  (iv)  monitoring  impacts.  Producer  and  user  groups  will  be  mobilized \nonce  the  IP-NGOs  are  contracted.  The  fisheries  infrastructure  will  be  started  after  satisfactory \ncompletion of the social preparation and stakeholder consultation. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n48. \nGoods  and  services  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  ADB-financed  civil  works  contracts \nestimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  more  than  $1.0  million  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB);  those  costing  less  than  $1.0  million  will  be  carried  out \nfollowing  the  Government\u2019s  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  satisfactory  to  ADB. \nSupply contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of more than $500,000 will be awarded on the \nbasis  of  ICB,  and  those  between  $500,000  and  $100,000  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of \ninternational  shopping.  Minor  items  costing  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  may  be  procured \nthrough  direct  purchase;  small  items  costing  less  than  $10,000  equivalent  will  be  procured  by \ncommunities  under  arrangements  developed  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  for  community \ndevelopment projects and acceptable to ADB and the lead IA. Notwithstanding the above, the \naward  of  civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $50,000  or  less  and  supply \ncontracts  for  equipment  and  materials  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $50,000  or  less, \nexcept  for  the  first  three  such  contracts  in  each  project  district,  will  be  subject  to  ADB\u2019s  post \nfacto approval procedures.23 Indicative contract packages are in Appendix 10. \n \n                                                 \n22  The  latter  will  be  undertaken  as  part  of  a  broader  effort  established  under  the  ADB-financed  Coastal  Resource \nManagement  Project  (CRMP)  seeking  to  create  a  comprehensive  fish  catch  monitoring  system  to  track  the \nsustainability of the marine fisheries resource. \n\n23 If such contracts are subsequently not approved by ADB, the Government will be required to refund any payment \n\nmade from the loan to finance such contracts and provide financing from its own or other resources. \n\n\f 14\n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n49. \nConsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants.  Summary  terms  of  reference  for  the  project  consultant  team  (around  35 \ninternational  and  381  domestic  person-months)  and  various  other  consultant  packages \n(including  the  IP-NGOs)  envisaged  under  the  Project  are  in  Appendix  11.  Consultants  will  be \nprovided  individually  and  through  a  firm.  In  recruiting  consulting  firms,  quality  and  cost  based \nselection procedures will be followed. To ensure that the Project is implemented without delay, \nadvance  action  will  be  allowed  in  recruiting  individual  project  management  consultants.  The \nGovernment has been advised that ADB\u2019s support of advance action does not commit ADB to \napprove  the  Project  or  to  finance  the  recruitment  costs.  To  the  extent  possible,  individual \nconsultants  and  IP-NGOs  will  be  recruited  on  a  competitive  basis.  Where  the  number  of \nqualified applicants is limited, direct selection may be used with prior approval of ADB.  \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n50. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook. For the timely release of funds, imprest accounts will be established for the use of \nNEPC and CFHC. Disbursements to the NDTF and from NDTF to MF-NGOs will be made on a \nreimbursement  basis  in  accordance  with  the  subsidiary  loan  agreement  between  the \nGovernment  and  NDTF  and  the  participation  agreement  entered  into  by  NDTF  and  each  MF-\nNGO.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed to by \nthe  Borrower  and  ADB.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  accounts  will  not \nexceed 6 months of estimated expenditure or 10% of the total loan amount, whichever is less. \nADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedures  may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible \nexpenditures and to liquidate advances made to the imprest accounts in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nloan disbursement guidelines. Any individual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under SOE \nprocedures  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  $50,000.  The  cofinancing  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance  with  procedures  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands  and  the \nMinistry of Finance. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n51. \nAll  agencies  involved  in  project  implementation  will  prepare  and  maintain  separate \naccounts  for  Project-related  disbursements.  The  PMA  will  consolidate  the  accounts  of  the \nvarious DSs and the CFHC and submit them to MHAPCLG, which will review the consolidated \naccounts  and,  after  audit,  submit  them  to  ADB.  The  audit  report  will  include,  among  others,  a \nstatement verifying that funds disbursed by ADB against SOEs have been used for the purpose \nfor  which  they  were  provided.  The  NDTF  will  be  responsible  for  accounts  and  requests  for \nreimbursements relating to the microfinance delivery system; it will establish a separate project \ncell to maintain detailed records on the use of loan proceeds. Project accounts (including those \nof  the  NDTF  and  the  MF-NGOs),  together  with  disbursement  documents,  will  be  audited \nannually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  9 \nmonths of the end of each fiscal year. The imprest accounts and SOEs will be audited as part of \nthe  regular  annual  audit  of  the  project  accounts,  and  a  separate  opinion  on  their  use  will  be \nrequired  in  the  annual  audit  report.  MHAPCLG,  NEPC,  CFHC,  and  NDTF  will  ensure \nsubmission of audited project accounts within the time frame stipulated in the Loan Agreement. \n \n52. \nThe implementing agencies will prepare quarterly financial and physical progress reports \non their respective activities, and submit the reports to the PO for consolidation. The NDTF will \n\n\f  15\n\nsubmit quarterly progress reports to the PO on the progress of its part of the Project. The report \nwill  be  an  aggregation  of  the  MF-NGOs  quarterly  reports,  which  will  cover  staffing,  training, \nlending, collection,  arrears  performance,  portfolio  data,  sub-borrowers\u2019  characteristics, and  the \nimpact of the livelihood support activities. The NDTF will segregate ADB loan proceeds from its \nown statements and from other ongoing projects, and present separate financial statements for \nthe Project. MHAPCLG will submit quarterly to ADB progress reports on project implementation, \nwithin  1  month  after  the  end  of  the  quarter  to  which  they  relate,  and  such  other  reports  and \ninformation relating to the Project as ADB may reasonably request. Within 3 months of physical \ncompletion  of  the  Project,  MHAPCLG  will  submit  a  project  completion  report  to  ADB.  The \nresponsibility  for  preparing  these  reports  and  ensuring  they  are  submitted  within  the  agreed \nupon  time  frame  rests  with  the  PD.  All  progress  reports  will  include  gender-disaggregated \ninformation  with  a  section  devoted  exclusively  to  the  Project\u2019s  impact  on  women,  successes \nencountered, constraints faced, and efforts made to overcome them. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Management System \n\n \nDuring  year  1  of  project  implementation,  a  project  performance  management  system \n53. \n(PPMS) will be established at the PO with links to each district and to each project division.  The \nPPMS will be prepared in consultation with the government agencies, project management staff, \nand IP-NGOs.  Participatory monitoring and evaluation systems, which include gender specific \nindicators, will be introduced, and a mechanism to monitor the performance of the IP-NGOs will \nbe  developed  with  the  assistance  of  the  district  NGO  consortia.  Indicators  outlined  for  the \nvulnerable GN selection process and other key benchmarks will be incorporated. The PPMS will \nbe part of the Project\u2019s overall computer-based management information system. Project impact \nassessment consultants under the Project will identify strategic indicators at the beginning of the \nProject  and  monitor  them  in-process  twice  a  year  and  in  more  detail  in  years  3  and  6.  The \nconsultants will particularly focus on gender, postconflict impact assessments, poverty impacts, \nnatural resource management, and institutional arrangements.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n54. \nIn the first 3 years of the Project, ADB will carry out semiannual reviews to (i) determine \nif  the  implementation  arrangements  are  appropriate  and  in  place  and  (ii)  assess  whether  the \nvarious  selection  and  intervention  screening  criteria  in  Appendix  5  remain  appropriate.  These \nreviews  will  also  track  relevant  indicators,  to  be  identified  at  the  beginning  of  project \nimplementation, to assess whether or not the overall peace/conflict climate is improving. During \nyear  3  of  the  Project,  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  will  assess  performance;  identify  any \nproblems  and  constraints  affecting  project  implementation,  including  changes  in  the  security \nclimate; and reach agreement on required changes to address the shortcomings. Depending on \nprogress  with  the  development  plan  for  Trincomalee  Bay,  the  midterm  review  may  need  to \nreassess  the  feasibility  of  proceeding  with  the  rehabilitation  of  Cod  Bay  Fisheries  Harbor,  and \nevaluate  other  potential  sites  for  fisheries  infrastructure.  Any  required  changes  in  scope, \nactivities, and associated financial reallocation will be incorporated following the midterm review.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n \nA. \n \nEconomic  benefits  will  be  generated  from  investments  in  (i)  community  infrastructure \n55. \nand  environmental  improvements;  (ii)  sustainable  livelihood  interventions;  (iii)  resource \nmanagement  and  planning;  and  (iv)  fisheries  infrastructure.  Investments  in  community \ninfrastructure  will  result  in  improved  productivity  and  health,  and  have  the  potential  to  reduce \n\n\f 16\n\nSocial Measures and Impact on Poverty \n\nhousehold  medical  costs.  Environmental  improvements  will  enhance  household  quality  of  life \nand  sustain  the  growth  of  tourism.  The  livelihood  interventions  will  result  in  incremental \nproduction of a broad range of products, with the potential to raise the incomes of the poorest \nhouseholds  substantially  at  full  development.  Improved  resource  management  will  reduce \neconomic losses from inefficient and environmentally destructive resource-based activities that \nwould  have  occurred  in  the  absence  of  the  Project.  Investments  in  the  fisheries  harbors  will \nincrease productivity of both fishers and shore-based businesses. In particular, the facilities will \nattract more boats, especially multiday boats that can operate outside the immediate coastline \nwhere fishing pressure is currently high, and will facilitate the development of an export-based \nfishing industry on the east coast. \n \n56. \nSince the project-financed investments in livelihood development activities will be largely \ndetermined by a community demand-driven process, it is difficult to predict the actual mix and \nscale of outputs. Furthermore, it is not possible to quantify with any degree of precision the long-\nterm  benefits  of  improved  resource  management  and  planning,  environmental  protection,  or \ninvestments  in  community  infrastructure.  Therefore,  a  full  benefit-cost  analysis  for  the  overall \nproject  was  considered  impractical.  Benefits  from  rehabilitating  the  fisheries  harbors  are  from \nincreased  boat  landings  due  to  the  improved  infrastructure  facilities  and  a  higher  value  fish \ncatch  due  to  better  handling  methods  and  reduced  wastage.  The  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn  (EIRR)  for  the  fisheries  development  component  is  estimated  at  about  30%.24  Further \ndetails of the financial and economic analyses are in Appendix 12. \n \nB. \n \nEthnic  Segregation.  Major  changes  in  ethnic  composition  have  occurred  during  the \n57. \nconflict period at the GN divisional level with communities living in separate villages or sections \nof  villages.  Further,  with  primary  education  being  either  in  Tamil  or  Sinhalese,  the  education \nsystem  effectively  supports  segregation  of  children  of  different  communities  at  an  early  age. \nEthnic segregation also occurs at the enterprise and institutional levels in terms of businesses, \nin government, and in subsector activities. The fishing industry, in particular, has become highly \nsegregated along ethnic lines and the long period of conflict has resulted in a substantial loss of \nfishing assets by the Tamil population. The Project will seek to ease ethnic tensions by adopting \npractices that have worked well under NECORD and NEIAP (as described in para. 27). \n \n58. \nIn the event that disputes arise during project implementation, the relevant parties will be \nencouraged  to  make  use  of  the  established  legal  system  where  this  is  considered  accessible \nand  effective.  Where  this  is  not  the  case,  traditional  community-based  nonviolent  conflict \nresolution mechanisms will be used.25 In areas where these do not exist, project management \nwill  select  and  contract  local  NGOs  with  specific  skills  in  conflict  transformation  to  assist \ncommunities in creating such mechanisms. Such contracts could cover several communities at \na  time,  depending  on  the  need  and  related  economies  of  scale.  The  Project  will  draw  on  the \nexperience NECORD has gained in this area. \n \n59. \nHighly  Stratified  Livelihood  Systems.  The  stratification  of  livelihoods  in  eastern \ncoastal  communities  was  compounded  during  the  conflict  as  the  various  resource  users \nadapted  to  restricted  access  and  degradation  of  the  resource  base.  Significant  differences \npresently  exist  between  resource  users  in  the  marine  and  lagoon  systems,  between  men  and \nwomen,  and  among  ethnic  groups  (Supplementary  Appendix  G).  The  Project  will  address  the \n                                                 \n24  The  EIRR  for  the  fisheries  harbor  rehabilitation  activities  under  the  recently  completed  ADB-financed  Fisheries \n\nSector Project was estimated to be in the 20-25% range. \n\n25 Conflicts among the various ethnic groups are often mediated by local religious or NGO leaders. LTTE leaders play \n\nthe same role in areas they control. \n\n\f  17\n\nsocial  stratification  problem  by  identifying  and  supporting  alternative  nontraditional  income \ngeneration activities. At the same time, livelihood support packages for traditional resource-based \nactivities  will  be  carefully  tailored  to  the  different  needs  and  capacities  of  the  resource  users \n(marine  fishers,  lagoon  fishers,  fisher/farmers,  farmers,  and  farmer/cattle  herders),  and  their \nsustainability  will  be  enhanced  through  environmental  rehabilitation  and  restoration  activities. \nAdvisory  services  and  mentoring  support  will  also  be  provided  to  assist  project  participants  in \nfurther  adapting  the  livelihood  interventions  to  their  particular  circumstances  and  capacities. \nProject assistance in this regard will focus particularly on female entrepreneurs.  \n \nGender. An inequitable division of labor continues to place additional strain on women in \n60. \nthe  East  in  fulfilling  traditional  male  tasks,  prompting  many  women  to  leave  the  country  and \nseek  work  in  the  Middle  East.  In  addition,  women  do  not  have  access  to  many  higher-wage \noccupations,  and  earn  about  half  of  what  men  earn  in  occupations  in  which  both  participate. \nFurther, unlike in other parts of Sri Lanka, women in the East are only peripherally engaged in \nmarine fishery support activities. Therefore, livelihood improvement interventions supported by \nthe  Project,  especially  those  related  to  microenterprise  development,  will  be  geared  toward \nwomen. This will be important given the high numbers of households with female heads in the \nproject area. To ensure that this orientation is carried out, criteria for selecting IP-NGOs include \ndemonstrated gender awareness. Moreover, gender issues will be addressed and monitored at \nall levels according to the gender strategy and plan in Appendix 3. \n \n61. \nResettlement  Impacts.  No  resettlement  impacts\u2014either  through  displacement  or \nadverse impacts on incomes\u2014are envisaged, given the Project\u2019s emphasis on providing small-\nscale community infrastructure and support for improved livelihoods. In addition, fisheries harbor \nrehabilitation in Valaichchenai will be limited to the confines of the existing facility to eliminate \nany  possible  scope  for  displacement  of  households.26  A  resettlement  framework  has  been \nprepared  and  agreed  upon  with  the  Government  in  the  event  any  unanticipated  resettlement \nissues arise during project implementation (Supplementary Appendix F). \n \n62.  Minority Groups. As noted in para. 15, small groups of coastal indigenous people live in \nscattered  communities  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  will  support  specific  activities  through \nseparate,  more  holistic  interventions  to  ensure  socially  and  culturally  sensitive  improvement  of \ntheir living conditions. Separate terms of reference were developed for the implementing partner \nNGO that will be engaged to implement the activities directed at coastal indigenous people. An \nindigenous peoples\u2019 plan according to ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples is not necessary in \nview of this direct intervention approach. \n \n63. \nImpact  on  Poverty.  The  Project  will  enhance  traditional  livelihoods  in  fishing  and \nagriculture  as  well  as  create  new  economic  opportunities  for  marginalized  groups  in \nnontraditional activities, particularly women and landless laborers. A number of innovative and \nfinancially viable livelihood packages have been identified for possible support under the Project \n(Appendix  12).  A  cluster  concept  linking  income  generation  activities  of  the  poor  with  micro, \nsmall,  and  medium-scale  enterprises  within  a  sector  promoting  backward/forward  linkages  will \nbe adopted and technical/mentoring support provided to ensure that the poor do not remain in \nisolated  activities  that  yield  low  financial  returns.  By  undertaking  environmental  improvements \nand  strengthening  resource  management  systems,  the  Project  will  also  help  maintain  the \nnatural resource base on which many coastal livelihood activities depend.  \n \n\n                                                 \n26 An ADB review mission will be fielded following completion of the detailed design of the rehabilitated harbor facility \nto ascertain whether land acquisition would be required or any other resettlement impacts would be generated. \n\n\f 18\n\nRisk Assessment \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nC. \n \n64. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003). Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) carried out as part of \nproject  preparation  have  involved  extensive  public  consultation.  In  view  of  the  different \ntypologies and locations of the interventions, five IEEs were prepared comprising development \nactivities  in  the  three  SMAs  and  rehabilitation  of  the  two  fisheries  harbors.  The  full  range  of \ncommunity interventions is examined in the IEEs conducted for the SMAs. While some activities \nmay  give  rise  to  adverse  but  manageable  environmental  impacts,  the  Project  will  also  have \nsignificant  environmental  benefits,  including  direct  protection  of  sensitive  and  valuable  natural \nresources.  A  summary  environmental  analysis  is  in  Appendix  14.  Environmental  management \nplans,  including  mitigation  measures  and  environmental  monitoring,  have  been  prepared  and \nrelevant subprojects will in addition be subject to formal environmental assessment and review \nprocedures (Supplementary Appendixes N and O). \n \nD. \n \n65. \nThe Project will be implemented in a changing political and institutional environment, and \nas  such  will  face  considerable  political,  institutional,  social,  and  security  risks.  During  project \npreparation,  to  the  extent  possible,  measures  to  address  the  risks  were  incorporated  in  the \nproject design. The political and security risks are considerably reduced with the current peace-\nbuilding  activities.  However,  until  there  is  a  formal  resolution  between  the  negotiating  parties, \nthese risks will remain. Political and institutional developments will be closely monitored by the \nNEPC and other relevant agencies, to enable project management to anticipate likely changes \nin this regard. \n \n66. \nGovernment  agencies  in  the  North  and  East  have  limited  institutional  capacity.  To \naddress this constraint to effective implementation, the Project will provide strategic staff inputs \ninto  the  local  Government  agencies  to  support  capacity  building  and  implementation  of \nactivities,  assist  in  developing  partnerships  between  Government  and  NGOs,  and  strengthen \nprivate sector participation in delivering services. To address the lack of effective enforcement \nof  environmental  regulations,  which  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on  project  outcomes,  the \nProject will work at a number of levels: with communities in terms of awareness raising and local \nresource  management  subprojects  addressing  environmental  hot  spots;  through  inter-agency \ngroups at the SMA level to establish coordinated planning and resource management systems; \nthrough  implementation  of  subprojects  with  direct  benefits,  such  as  solid  waste  management; \nand through assistance to improve enforcement of environmental regulations. \n \n67. \nThe targeted beneficiaries are poor and vulnerable, and there is a risk that they will not \nparticipate  in  project  activities.  The  project  design  has  addressed  this  risk  by  focusing  on \ninterventions  that  meet  immediate  needs\u2014provision  of  basic  community  infrastructure  and \nlivelihood  support.  The  interventions  will  be  developed  in  close  consultation  with  the \ncommunities  themselves,  and  will  aim  to  respond  to  local  priorities.  IP-NGOs  will  work  with \ncommunities  to  assist  in  identifying  and  preparing  these  interventions.  The  sustainability  of \nproject activities is also a risk, given the government\u2019s fiscal constraints and the low household \nincomes  in  the  project  area.  To  reduce  this  risk,  the  Project  will  strengthen  local  community-\nbased organizations and offer training in management practices for project-supported activities. \nTo  reduce  the  fiscal  burden  on  Government,  and  increase  local  ownership,  the  O&M  costs  of \nthe community infrastructure will be borne by the communities themselves. \n \n \n\n\f  19\n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n68. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i) \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\nThe project implementation arrangements reflect the present Government administrative \nstructure  in  the  project  area  that  may  change  during  implementation.  The  Government \nwill immediately notify ADB of any change in administrative structure and take necessary \nsteps to ensure that the project management arrangements are revised in consultation \nwith ADB to reflect the new administrative structure. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  project  interventions  contribute  to  peace  building \nand community reconciliation. In the event that any intervention is having, or is thought \nto  have  had,  negative  impacts  on  peace  building  and  reconciliation  efforts,  the \nGovernment  agrees  that  ADB  will  have  the  discretion  to  determine  whether  the \nintervention should be continued, redesigned, suspended, or cancelled. \nThe  Government  will  provide  adequate  counterpart  funding  for  the  Project  and  will \nensure that the lead implementing agency receives its annual budget allocations without \ndelay to enable it to properly discharge its responsibilities under the Project. \nThe Government will ensure that the lead IA, with the assistance of consulting services, \nwill have come up with long-term O&M procedures and sustainable sources of funds to \noperate  and  maintain  the  assets  upgraded  or  constructed  under  the  Project.    With \nrespect  to  the  assets  to  be  operated  and  maintained  by  communities,  the  Government \nwill  ensure  that  each  community  or  community  organization  has  (a)  before  the  start  of \nany  civil  works,  agreed  in  writing  with  the  lead  IA  to  be  responsible  for  O&M  of  the \nrelevant upgraded or new assets; and (b) put in place an O&M plan that is practicable \nand acceptable to the lead IA and ADB. \nThe Government will ensure that (a) all project interventions are specifically targeted to \nthe poor and to women; (b) the Project\u2019s gender strategy and plan are implemented as \nset out in Appendix 3; and (c) specific interventions are developed to benefit the coastal \nindigenous people in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. \nThe Government will ensure that all environmental mitigation measures identified in the \nIEEs  conducted  for  this  Project  are  incorporated  into  the  project  design  and  followed \nduring  implementation  in  consultation  with  the  responsible  line  agency  and  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on the Environment. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  the  environmental  review  procedures  (ERP)  for \napproving subprojects are strictly observed and agrees that no project activities will start \nbefore  the  full  compliance  with  the  ERP  and  receipt  of  approval;  and  (b)  all  subproject \nactivities  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  rules, \nregulations and laws, and ADB\u2019s environmental assessment guidelines. \n\n(viii)  The Government will ensure that an adequate resettlement plan based on the approved \nresettlement  framework  is  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  for  any \nsubproject  involving  resettlement  impacts  as  defined  in  the  Government\u2019s  National \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement.  \nThe Government will ensure that the NDTF will implement the microfinance scheme as \ndescribed  in  the  ADB  Loan  Agreement  and  in  the  subsidiary  loan  agreement,  and \nperforms its obligations under the subsidiary loan agreement.   \n\n(ix) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\f 20\n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nB. \n \n69. \nPrior  to  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  (i)  made  the  necessary  office \nspace and initial office equipment allocations for the Project; (ii) appointed the project director, \nand  selected  and  appointed  the  deputy  project  directors  for  each  of  the  three  districts  in \naccordance with the Government\u2019s Circular 10 of 26 December 2000, Management of Staff for \nProject  Management  Units  of  Projects  Assisted  by  Foreign  Financed  Agencies  and  Their \nEmoluments,  with  the  concurrence  of  ADB;  (iii)  signed  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  with  the \nNDTF,  satisfactory  to  ADB,  with  all  conditions  for  its  effectiveness  satisfied;  (iv)  obtained  the \nNetherlands grant or made other arrangements, satisfactory to ADB, to commit the provision of \nthe  funds  intended  to  be  provided  by  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands,  and  provided  ADB \nwith  a  copy  of  a  signed  agreement  relating  to  obtaining  the  Netherlands  grant;  and  (v) \ncompleted the NDTF\u2019s incorporation as a company. \n \nC.  \n \nNo withdrawals will be made from the loan account for civil works related to rehabilitation \n70. \nof  the  two  harbor  facilities  unless  ADB  verifies  that  CFHC  has  submitted  to  ADB  a  corporate \nplan addressing at least the following: (i) strategies for promoting private sector participation in \nthe  harbor  activities  at  Valaichchenai  and  Cod  Bay;  (ii)  strategies  for  medium  and  long-term \nmanagement, O&M of its assets, including civil works, equipment, and services provided under \nthis  Project;  and  (iii)  strategies  for  ensuring  equitable  stakeholder  participation  in  the  facilities \nconstructed  or  upgraded  at  Valaichchenai  and  Cod  Bay.  In  addition,  no  withdrawal  shall  be \nmade  from  the  Loan  Account  for  civil  works  at  Cod  Bay  until  CFHC  has  demonstrated  to  the \nsatisfaction  of  ADB  that  the  proposed  activities  are  consistent  with  the  planned  long-term \ndevelopment of Trincomalee Bay. \n \n\nCondition for Withdrawal from Loan Account \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n71. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  14,009,000  to  the  Democratic  Socialist \nRepublic of Sri Lanka for the North East Coastal Community Development Project from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe draft Loan Agreement and Project Implementation Agreements presented to the Board. \n\n \nJOHN LINTJER \nVice President (Finance and Administration) \n\n \n6 November 2003 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1\n\n  21\n\nANALYSIS OF THE POSTCONFLICT SITUATION  \nIN THE NORTH AND EAST \n\nin \n\nfurther \n\nincomes \n\nBackground \n\nreduced  household \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nTwenty  years  of  conflict  has  severely  affected  the  livelihood  capabilities  of  households \nand  communities  in  the  North  and  East.  The  direct  effects  of  the  conflict  include  the  loss  of \nbreadwinners  and  livelihood  opportunities  due  to  death,  displacement,  physical  injury,  and \ndestruction  of  physical  assets.  There  has  also  been  a  great  deal  of  personal  insecurity  and \nreduced access to communal and public assets. Capabilities and skills have also been reduced \nby  declining  standards  of  education,  low  school  attendance  rates,  and  lack  of  continuous \nemployment  and  concomitant  skills  development.  The  general  erosion  of  assets  and \ncapabilities,  in  turn,  has  undermined  people\u2019s  capacity  to  cope  with  stress  and  shock,  making \nthem overly focused on short-term survival and highly averse to risk taking. \n \nAs  economic  activity  diminished  due  to  the  above  factors,  the  resulting  unemployment \n2. \nand  underemployment \nthe  North  and  East. \nUnemployment in the region in 2002 was estimated to exceed 25%\u2014compared with 10% in the \nrest  of  the  country\u2014with  youth  and  new  graduates  among  the  most  seriously  affected. \nWidespread underemployment has also made large numbers of people in the region dependent \non  low  productivity,  low  income,  and  subsistence-oriented  activities.  Women  account  for  a \ndisproportionately large proportion of the underemployed, particularly those engaged primarily in \nagricultural activities. \n \n3. \nEconomic  activity  has  slowly  picked  up  since  the  declaration  of  a  cease-fire  in  early \n2002. As part of the peace process, some obstacles are gradually being removed, such as the \nborders between government-controlled and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eilam (LTTE)-controlled \nareas. Despite all the legacies of the conflict and prevailing insecurities caused by a deep sense \nof distrust, people are slowly rebuilding their lives and reestablishing social relationships outside \ntheir  immediate  communities.  In  response  to  the  cease-fire  declaration,  more  than  270,000 \ninternally displaced persons (IDPs) returned to their areas of origin during 2002. A high level of \nmovement to and within the North and East has continued in the course 2003 as well. However, \nland  mines  and  unexploded  ordnance  still  inhibit  the  movement  of  people  and  access  to \nphysical assets, particularly agricultural land and economic infrastructure. \n \nRestoring  village  livelihoods  in  this  complex  and  still  fluid  situation  requires  multiple \n4. \ninterventions at the community level, and the needs are great. Local roads, particularly category \nC and below, need to be restored. Minor irrigation schemes are in poor condition, with over 30% \nof their tanks requiring rehabilitation. Destruction and loss of animals have significantly reduced \nthe livestock population. Water and sanitation systems were totally or partially destroyed in most \nvillages,  and  electricity  still  needs  to  be  provided  in  many  remote  rural  areas.  Most  of  the \nformerly  surplus  producing  agricultural  areas  have  become  food-deficit  areas,  and  farming \nequipment  and  key  infrastructure  have  been  lost.  Coastal  fisheries  have  experienced \nwidespread destruction of productive assets, including boats and gear, and serious damage to \nsupporting infrastructure such as harbors, anchorages, ice plants, and fuel supply depots. \n\n\f 22\n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nNeeds Assessment \n\nin  community-based  organizations \n\nB. \n \nThe  recently  completed  assessment  of  needs  in  the  conflict-affected  areas1  indicates \n5. \nthat  restoration  of  livelihoods  will  require  the  strengthening  of  the  capacities  and  assets  that \nsupport the basic well-being of the people. The assessment concludes that it will be necessary \nto  provide  an  enabling  and  protective  environment  for  people  to  take  advantage  of  new \nopportunities through a more holistic approach combining the following elements: (i) programs \nthat address immediate, medium-term, and long-term needs in a continuum ultimately linked to \ndevelopment-oriented interventions for poverty reduction; (ii) priority being given to the poorest \nand  most  vulnerable  within  the  affected  communities  and  resettling  populations;  (iii)  programs \nthat reflect the diversity of natural resources, livelihood systems, ethnicity, conflict impacts, and \ngeographical locations in the region; (iv) participation of communities, particularly of women and \nother  disadvantaged  groups,  at  all  stages;  (v)  empowering  the  affected  communities,  in \nparticular poor people and other vulnerable groups, by promoting institutional development and \ncapacity  building/training  of  participants \n(CBOs), \ncooperatives,  and  other  community  groups;  and  (vi)  promotion  of  peace  building  and \nsustainability. \n \n6. \nWith nearly 90% of the population in the North and East living in rural areas, livelihood \nrestoration will have to come primarily from reviving and expanding rural economic activities, at \nleast initially. Improving the productivity of crops, fisheries and livestock, and related processing \nindustries  will  be  particularly  important.  Agriculture  and  fisheries  sector  recovery,  in  turn,  will \ninduce  a  demand-propelled  expansion  of  many  other  activities,  including  agro-  and  fisheries-\nbased  services  and  value  addition.  Revival  of  the  rural  economy  through  small  and  medium-\nscale  enterprise  development,  enhanced  use  of  local  resources,  and  an  expanded  service \nsector  (e.g.,  trading,  transport,  and  tourism)  also  have  considerable  potential  to  improve \nlivelihoods in the North and East. \n \nThe current peace process and the ongoing resettlement of IDPs also give opportunities \n7. \nfor  expanding  microfinance  (MF)  activities  into  broader  programs  that  link  microfinance \ninstitutions (MFIs) with the needs of both resident and returnee populations. The entry point of \nMF  must  be  at  the  community  level.  Social  mobilization,  savings  promotion,  quality  and \ntimeliness  of  credit  disbursement,  effective  handling  of  recoveries,  income  disclosure,  and \ndelinquency  management  are  the  main  competencies  required  in  expanding  MFIs.  The \ninstitutional  development  and  social  mobilization  strategies  should  contribute  to  the  economic \nempowerment of the local people and the smooth functioning of CBOs and other local groups. It \nis  also  necessary  to  combine  the  provision  of  MF  services  with  strengthened  institutional \ndevelopment, staff capacity building, and technical support/mentoring of MF clients. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nOngoing  interventions  in  the  North  and  the  East  (e.g.,  North  East  Community \nRestoration and Development Program [NECORD] and North East Irrigated Agriculture Project \n[NEIAP])  provide  valuable  lessons  that  must  be  considered  in  designing  projects  to  help  local \ncommunities  regain  productive  lives.  In  particular,  project  interventions  must  adopt  a  process \napproach  to  permit  flexible  adjustment  of  project  design  during  implementation.  This  will  be \nparticularly  important  in  the  present  context,  given  that  the  security  environment  remains  very \nfluid and that most local people are still traumatized by many years of conflict and the effects of \nliving in insecure surroundings. Other relevant lessons from earlier experiences are (i) the need \nto ensure that a balance is maintained in project activities among ethnic groups; (ii) the need to \n\nLessons Learned and Project Context \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB, UN, World Bank. 2003.

Although boundary lines between these areas will undoubtedly be the focus of \nfuture  discussions  as  part  of  the  peace  negotiations,  at  the  moment  they  are  not  actively \ncontested  by  either  side.  The  future  political  and  security  situation  in  the  North  and  East  will \ndepend  greatly  on  the  progress  of  the  peace  talks.  Although  the  situation  now  is  generally \nstable,  it  is  punctuated  by  frequent  reports  of  relatively  minor  breaches  of  the  cease-fire \nagreement and of intimidation of local citizens and groups not closely aligned with the LTTE. \n \nKey  actors  who  have  an  influence  on  the  evolving  conditions  in  the  conflict-affected \n10. \nareas include the LTTE, who wish to ensure that peace will bring, not only rehabilitation to the \nNorth and East, but also significant autonomy in the governance of the region. The LTTE also \nwishes  to  ensure  that  it  remains  the  sole  recognized  representative  of  the  Tamil  people.  The \nGovernment, which controls about half of the conflict-affected area, sees peace and the ensuing \nstability as an essential ingredient in revitalizing the national economy. However, the attitudes of \ncertain  elements  within  Government  and  the  civil  service  mitigate  against  the  pursuit  of  an \nequitable  peace  settlement.  These  attitudes  are  reflected  within  some  opposition  parties  and \nnationalist  political  and  religious  groups  in  the  South,  considerably  limiting  the  scope  for  bold \nGovernment initiatives to advance the peace process. \n \nD. \n \n11. \nThe general trend over the past 18 months has been a gradual decrease in the overall \nlevel  of  tension  in  the  country.  However,  there  is  a  clear  sense  that  the  trend  could  easily  be \nreversed.  In  addition,  this  general  easing  of  tension  does  not  preclude  periodic  outbreaks  of \nviolence  triggered  by  local  issues.  These  issues  tend  to  be  related  to  competition  for  local \nresources,  for  example  access  to  fishing  grounds  or  arable  land.  Because  of  the  lack  of  trust \nand  effective  dispute  resolution  mechanisms  at  higher  levels,  the  danger  is  that  these  local \ntriggers  could  cause  wider  outbreaks  of  violence  through  contagion  effects.  In  the  present \ncontext,  this  danger  appears  to  be  more  of  a  risk  than  national  or  subnational  leaders  inciting \ntheir followers to violence at the local level. \n \nThe  most  likely  scenario  over  the  next  few  years  is  that  the  overall  peace  will  hold \n12. \ndespite  periodic  setbacks  in  negotiations  and  outbreaks  of  violence.  However,  the  lack  of \ntransparent,  effective,  democratic  governance  according  to  generally  accepted  international \nnorms  is  likely  to  continue  to  be  a  problem  for  the  foreseeable  future.  Thus,  conflict-related \ntensions  will  continue  to  constrain  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  development  process,  particularly  in  the  North \nand East.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPrognosis \n\n\f 24\n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n \n\n \nSource \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE  \nFOR REHABILITATION IN THE NORTH AND EASTa \n\n \nMultilateral \n               World Bank\u2013North East Irrigated Agriculture Project \n               World Bank\u2013North East Emergency Reconstruction Program \n               United Nations\u2013Rehabilitation and Reconstruction in North East Province \n               United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (several programs) \n               ADB\u2013North East Community Restoration and Development Project \n               ADB\u2013Secondary Towns and Rural Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation \n\nProjectb \nADB\u2014Distance Education Modernization Projectb \nADB\u2014A9 Rehabilitation under Third Road Improvement \n\n \nBilateral \n               European Commission \n                    (Several  programs \n\ninformation) \n\nin \n\nrehabilitation,  protection,  capacity  building,  and \n\nJapan Bank for International Cooperation \n\nPro-Poor Economic Advancement and Community Enhancement Projectb \n\n                     Small-Scale Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Upgrading Project \n               Government of Germany \n                      (Several  programs  in  rehabilitation,  shelter,  urban  and  rural  water  supply, \n\nintegrated food security, and training) \n\n               Government of Australia \n                       Integrated Water Supply Scheme for Ampara \n               Government of Norway \n                       (several programs in security, peace building, capacity building, and health) \n               Government of the United Kingdom \n                        (several programs in security, peace building, capacity building, and health) \n               Government of the Netherlands \n\n(several  programs  in  livelihood  assistance,  education,  agriculture,  capacity \nbuilding, and environment) \n\n               Government of Canada \n\n               Government of Sweden \n\n(several programs in child welfare, gender, capacity building, and health) \n\nAmount \n($ million)\n \n\n27.0\n31.0\n3.0\n15.1\n40.0\n60.3\n\n45.0\n5.0\n\n24.7\n\n16.0\n\n8.5\n\n4.7\n\n9.8\n\n21.8\n\n5.3\n\n7.6\n\n8.7\n\n(several program in child welfare, gender, capacity building, and health) \n\n \na  Only  major  programs  are  listed.

With the objective of reducing poverty and meeting basic needs in coastal \ncommunities in the three districts of Trincomalee, Batticaloa, and Ampara, the Project seeks to \naddress  women  and  gender-related  concerns  through  selected  interventions.  The  Project \ncomprises five components: (i) sustainable livelihood improvement, (ii) resource management in \nthree  special  management  areas  (SMAs);  (iii)  coastal  resource  planning;  (iv)  fisheries \ndevelopment; and (v) project implementation support. A poverty and  social assessment (PSA) \nwas conducted during the project preparatory technical assistance and has been cross-checked \nand updated during loan processing.  \n \n2. \nConflict-Related  Gender  Issues.  During  the  conflict,  the  workload  of  women  has \nincreased  and  role  reversals  have  occurred,  but  patriarchal  values  still  influence  gender \nrelations  in  society  and  economy.  An  inequitable  gender  division  of  labor  continues  to  put \nadditional  strain  on  women  in  fulfilling  supposedly  male  tasks.  Due  to  economic  hardships \ncaused by the conflict, many poor women have left the country seeking work in the Middle East. \nNot  only  are  they  prone  to  numerous  abuses  for  using  unlicensed  agencies  or  personal \ncontacts, but they compromise their social status and are blamed for any misfortune that befalls \nthe  family  in  their  absence.    In  the  PSA  focus  group  discussions,  women  mentioned  the \nadditional  workload  originating  from  role  reversal,  a  general  feeling  of  being  exploited,  of \nworking 15-25% longer hours than men (taking unpaid household work into account), increasing \ndomestic violence and incest, and stigmatization for having worked in the Middle East.   \n \nHouseholds  with  Female  Heads.  The  PSA  reports  high  numbers  of  households  with \n3. \nfemale  heads  (FHHs)  in  the  project  area.  Overall,  FHHs  form  16%  of  the  total  number  of \nhouseholds,  with  a  maximum  of  54%  for  individual  Grama  Niladhari  (GN)  divisions  in  Ampara \ndistrict. Of the 36 GN divisions with 25% or more FHHs, 18 are in Ampara, 11 in Batticaloa, and \n7 in Trincomalee. The emergence of large numbers of FHHs in the project area is directly linked \nto the conflict. War-related death and disappearance of a large number of young men during the \n1990s left a large population of young war widows in the Eastern Province. These women not \nonly suffer trauma, but also fall under the category of widows, a status that carries with it stigma \nowing  to  prevalent  patriarchal  attitudes  and  misconceptions.  The  breakdown  of  social  control \nand  displacement\u2014which  have  allowed  men  to  abandon  their  wives  without  going  through  a \nlegal  divorce,  or  practice  polygamy  in  selected  areas\u2014and  high  divorce  rates  have  further \ncontributed to the increase in FHHs.      \n \n4. \nWage  Discrepancies.  The  wage  disparities  between  men  and  women  are  marked. \nWomen earn SLRs50\u2013100 per day, while men earn SLRs100\u2013200.  Women do not have access \nto  many  higher  wage  activities  such  as  masonry  and  carpentry,  even  if  they  have  undergone \ntraining.  For  example,  nontraditional  job  training  for  women  that  has  been  supported  by  the \nWorld  University  Services  of  Canada  for  the  past  10  years  is  largely  ineffective  because  of \nexisting  social  barriers.  Fortunately,  microfinance-based  development  programs  focusing  on \nwomen already operate successfully in the project area and are seen as an alternative to female \nwage labor. In the LTTE-controlled areas, structures are more egalitarian and female cadres are \nconsidered  equal  partners.  Sustaining  gender  equity  in  a  postconflict  situation  represents  a \nchallenge to the Project, which seeks to provide opportunities for women beyond the conflict.  \n \nWomen\u2019s Livelihood Activities. Unlike in other parts of Sri Lanka, women in the East \n5. \nare only peripherally engaged in marine fishery support activities although in exceptional cases \nthey do mend nets. In lagoon fishing systems, however, they engage in a number of fisheries-\nrelated  activities  like  catching  shrimps,  or  gleaning  for  clams  and  oysters  both  for  home \n\n\f 26\n\nAppendix 3 \n\nconsumption and for sale. Mat weaving is another income generating activity. Men seasonally \nmigrate  for  agricultural  work,  whereas  women  remain  at  home.  Therefore,  livelihood  projects \nand microenterprise development can be enhanced to increase income and social benefits, and \nwill be geared toward women in particular.  \n \nProject Design and Implementation. The Project provides appropriate skills training for \n6. \nemployment free from gender bias. All project-related training will include a compulsory module \non  gender  awareness  to  create  a  supportive  environment  for  women.  Service  providers \nspecializing  in  promoting  livelihood  and  enterprises  for  women  will  be  recruited.  Community \ninfrastructure  will  be  women-friendly,  with  special  provisions  for  child-care  facilities,  wherever \nsuitable.  Public  awareness  programs  will  seek  to  dispel  negative  images  of  widowhood  to \nenable  widows  to  gain  self-respect  and  participate  in  the  economy  as  valued  citizens.  The \nProject  through  its  selection  criteria  for  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  ensures \nparticipation  by  at  least  one  local  women\u2019s  NGO  as  an  implementing  partner.  The  social \ndevelopment  consultant  to  be  hired  under  the  project  will  have  expertise  in  gender  and \ndevelopment  and  gender  mainstreaming;  conduct  gender  training;  and  advise  the  project \noffices, implementing partner NGOs (IP-NGOs) and NGO consortia on gender-sensitive project \nmanagement. \n  \n7. \ngender concerns during implementation.   \n \n\n The  following  framework  reflects  specific  features  built  into  the  Project  to  address \n\nProject Components/Activities  \n\nDesign Features/Measures  \n\nComponent 1 - Sustainable Livelihood Improvement \n\nSelect communities  \n\nEstablish District Secretariat-level steering \nand monitoring committees \n\nEstablish project information centers \n\n \n\n \n\nSelect implementing partner IP-NGOs \n\nConduct participatory needs assessments \n(PNAs) \n \n\nProvide livelihood and enterprise \ndevelopment services (LEDS) \n\nincluding \n\nleast  30% \n\nThe  proportion  of  households  with  female  heads  was  one \nselection criterion. \nThe  committees  must  have  at \nfemale \nmembership  in  and  gender  awareness  programs  will  be \nconducted for officers. \nWith  women-friendly  opening  hours,  gender-specific \ninformation  material  available,  links  with  women\u2019s  NGOs \nand  enterprise  development  service  providers  will  be \nmaintained. \nAt least one IP-NGO in each district will be a women\u2019s NGO \n(to  qualify,  70%  of  clients  and  staff, \ntop \nmanagement  should  be  women);  will  strengthen  existing \nlocal  women\u2019s  networks  bridging  across  ethnic  groups. \nOther  IP-NGOs  will  show  demonstrated  gender  awareness \n(as  evidenced  in  their  project  documents,  e.g.,  gender-\ndisaggregated  monitoring  and  reporting);  at  least  50%  of \nclients  and  30%  of  staff  are  women;  and \nis \ncommitment to increase the female ratio in top management \nto 30% by project midterm review. \nPNAs will be conducted separately with men and women, \nand should reflect women\u2019s and men\u2019s needs separately.  \n \nAt  least  one  LEDS  provider  to  be  contracted  will  specialize \nin providing business skills training to women; will provide a \nfemale  business  advisor  for  each  district;  will  ensure  that \ntraining,  technology  transfer,  and  market  opportunities  will \nbe provided without gender bias.  \n\nthere \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fForm and strengthen appropriate livelihood \nclusters and other interest groups (producer \nand user groups)  \n.   \nEstablish mentoring systems for \nmicroenterprises and   small entrepreneurs \nthrough chambers and service-oriented \nclubs \n\nImplement small-scale community \ninfrastructure projects \n\n \n\nImplement environmental conservation and \nrestoration projects \n\nConduct training \n\nSeparate  set  of  livelihood  interventions  for \ncoastal Vedda communities \n\nAppendix 3\n\n  27\n\nAt  least  50%  of  members  of  these  interest  groups  will  be \nwomen;  separate  women\u2019s  groups  will  be  formed  where \nappropriate. \n\nThe  Project  will  ensure  that  50%  of  participants  in  the \nmentoring  program  are  women  clients  and  will  aim  to \npersuade  successful  women  entrepreneurs  to  serve  as \nmentors and role models to increase self-confidence among \nrural  women  micro  and  small  entrepreneurs.

Implementing Partner NGOs \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe  core  project  area  is  defined  to  include  the  396  Grama  Niladhari  (GN)  divisions \nbordering  the  coast  or  major  lagoons.  Community-level  project  interventions  for  which  these \nselection criteria apply, will initially focus on 146 vulnerable GN divisions within the project area. In \naddition,  nonvulnerable  GN  divisions  located  in  environmental  hot  spots  within  the  special \nmanagement  areas  (SMAs)  will  also  receive  a  set  of  interventions  for  community  infrastructure, \nnatural  resource  management  and  environmental  improvement/conservation.  Most  community-\nlevel  interventions  will  be  facilitated  or  implemented  by  implementing  partner  nongovernment \norganizations  (IP-NGOs).  The  selection  criteria  for  IP-NGOs,  GN  divisions,  beneficiaries,  and \nproject interventions are outlined in this appendix.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nis \nheterogeneous  and  rapidly  changing.  Most  NGOs  provided  the  local  population  with  services \nthroughout  the  conflict,  and  their  focus  is  slowly  shifting  from  emergency  to  development \ninterventions.1  While  some  NGOs  are  well  established  and  recognized,  others  need \nstrengthening.  Except  for  a  few,  they  generally  use  uniform  methodologies,  as  they  lacked \nexposure  to  new  approaches  during  the  conflict,  and  concentrated  on  providing  emergency \nassistance. International NGOs also operated throughout the conflict, and national NGOs have \nresumed or started working in the East in recent years. \n \n3. \nMany  activities  under  components  1  and  2  will  be  implemented  or  facilitated  by  IP-\nNGOs. Several (2\u20134) experienced local NGOs2 in each of the three districts will be selected as \nIP-NGOs to assist the Project to form and work with user and interest groups at the community \nlevel and strengthen existing community-based organizations (CBOs). The eligibility of IP-NGOs \nwill  be  assessed  jointly  by  the  project  management  team  and  the  district  coordinating \ncommittees (DCCs), in close consultation with the NGO consortia in the three project districts.  \nThe selection criteria were developed through an extensive consultation process with the NGOs \nthemselves, who judged the criteria to be transparent and fair. The eligibility criteria for selecting \nIP-NGOs are as follows: \n  \n\nthe  Eastern  Province \n\nlandscape \n\nin \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nreadiness to cooperate with the relevant authorities;  \nmembership of the district-level NGO consortium;  \nreadiness to coordinate with other IP- NGOs;  \nregistration under the relevant legislation for at least 3 years;  \na district-level or national-level NGO with a governing body and financial autonomy at \ndistrict level; \nan office with appropriate staff (at least 30% of staff members being women);  \n\n                                                 \n1    About  30  district-level  NGOs  exist  in  Trincomalee  district.  In  Batticaloa,  45  NGOs  belong  to  the  INAYAM \nConsortium  of  local  NGOs.  In  Ampara  district,  the  older  NGO  consortium,  based  in  Akkaraipattu  and  serving  the \ncoastal  areas,  has  20  member  organizations.  A  second  district-level  network,  the  Council  of  Ampara  District \nNGOs/Consortium based in Ampara, has a membership of 63 organizations. \n\n2  At  least  one  NGO  per  district  should  be  a  local  women\u2019s  NGO  to  assure  targets  in  the  Project\u2019s  gender  strategy \nand plan are met. If experience and capacities on gender awareness training permit, this women\u2019s NGO could also \nprovide  the  gender  awareness  training  or  respective  modules  in  other  training  courses  for  project  partners.  To \nqualify as a women\u2019s NGO, 70% of clients and staff including top management should be women. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\n \n4. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(vii)  Regular auditing (with at least 2 years of audited accounts) and proper record keeping;  \n(viii) \n(ix) \n(x) \n\ndemonstrated outreach to poor women in coastal areas; \ndemonstrated outreach to vulnerable groups in coastal areas;  \ndemonstrated gender awareness (at least 50% of groups being women) as evidenced \nby the NGO\u2019s gender-disaggregated monitoring and evaluation system; \ndemonstrated sensitivity to working with the ethnic group(s) to be targeted in that area;3 \n(xi) \n(xii)  willingness  to  adopt  new  approaches  and  combine  community  development  with \n\n(xiii) \n\nenvironmentally sound interventions; and \nreadiness  to  increase  the  number  of  female  office  holders  to  30%  by  the  Project\u2019s \nmidterm review. \n\nIn addition, selection will be based on proposals that outline: \n\nhow project interventions will be implemented, coordinated and facilitated, with special \nattention to the social mobilization strategy to reach vulnerable groups and the mode of \nworking with other NGOs and CBOs within the district; and \nthe exit strategy adopted by the IP-NGO to ensure sustainability of project interventions \nwithin communities. \n\n \n5. \nA  separate  IP-NGO  will  be  selected  to  implement  project  interventions  in  coastal  Vedda \ncommunities.  In  addition  to  the  preceding  selection  criteria,  the  following  additional  criteria  will \napply: \n \n \n\ndemonstrated  sensitivity  in  working  with  small  minority  groups,  who  still  combining \nhunting and gathering with limited sedentary occupations, and in many instances do not \nwant to be identified as a separate group; and \ndemonstrated  ability  to  deal  with  prevailing  social  problems  (e.g.  alcoholism)  and \ncommitment to a comprehensive, culturally sensitive livelihood approach. \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n\nCriteria for Selecting GN Divisions  \n\nC. \n \n6. \nThe  community-level  project  interventions  under  component  1  will  initially  focus  on  146 \nvulnerable  GN  divisions.  All  vulnerable  GN  divisions  will  be  entitled  to  receive  support  for \ncommunity  infrastructure  and  livelihood  interventions.  In  addition,  vulnerable  GN  divisions  within \nSMAs  (84),  as  well  as  nonvulnerable  GN  divisions  in  designated  environmental  hot  spots  (to  be \nidentified  during  the  planning  process)  within  SMAs,  will  also  receive  support  for  resource \nmanagement and environmental improvements.  \n \n7. \nThe vulnerability criteria are based on the data collected as part of the social analysis during \nthe  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  and  consisted  of  the  following  indicators:  (i) \naccess  to  safe  drinking  water  (households  having  access  to  wells  or  piped  water);  (ii)  access  to \nsanitary  facilities  (number  of  toilets  per  household);  (iii)  percentage  of  households  with  female \nheads (FHHs); (iv) number of displacements experienced by a community over the last ten years; \n(v)  number  of  restrictions  affecting  sustainable  livelihoods  within  the  community  (income \ngenerating  activities,  mobility,  procurement  and  transport  of  essential  items  such  as  food  and \nenergy sources); and  (vi) level of indebtedness. \n \n8. \nThe  six  indicators  were  combined  into  a  vulnerability  index.  Of  67  coastal  GN  divisions  in \nTrincomalee, 173 in Batticaloa, 156 in Ampara, a total of 146 were ranked as most vulnerable: 35 \n\n \n\n                                                 \n3  The Peace/Conflict Screening Instrument in Section F will be used to assess this sensitivity.  \n\n\fAppendix 5\n\n35 \n\nin  Trincomalee,  88  in  Batticaloa,  and  23  in  Ampara.  The  146  GN  divisions  will  be  prioritized  for \ncommunity  infrastructure  and  livelihood  support  during  the  first  3  years  of  the  Project.  Focal \nvillages  under  the  North  East  Irrigated  Agriculture  Project  and  other  villages  already  included  in \ncomprehensive village development activities, e.g., under the Integrated Food Security Project, will \nbe excluded. Additional GN divisions will be selected using the following criteria: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nAdditional GN divisions will follow the ranking provided in the PPTA. \nGN  divisions  with  already  established  North  East  Community  Restoration  and \nDevelopment Project anchor projects will be prioritized to create synergies.  \nGN divisions will be selected to ensure that the beneficiary populations reflect the ethnic \ncomposition of the coastal populations within each district.  \n\nThe indigenous coastal Vedda communities concentrated in a number of GN divisions in the \n9. \nKoralaipattu  North  and  Koralai  Pattu  in  Batticaloa  district,  as  well  as  Muttur/Eachilampattai  in \nTrincomalee district, will receive specific targeted support. The Vedda communities are all located \nin GN divisions that have been identified as vulnerable. \n \n10.  Nonvulnerable GN divisions located near environmental hot spots within SMAs will also be \nselected  to  receive  assistance  in  community  management  of  resources,  including  formation  of \ncommunity-based  groups \nto  assist  with  enforcement  of  environmental  regulations,  and \nimprovement/conservation of the environment.  \n \nD. \n \nIn  the  vulnerable  GN  divisions,  beneficiaries  will  be  selected  to  achieve  both  direct  and \n11. \nindirect  poverty  reduction.  Thus,  beneficiaries  will  consist  of  both  the  poor  and  those  who  have \npotential  to  create  employment  and  link  with  other  beneficiaries  within  cluster  systems.  As  the \nconflict has created a large number of FHHs and most women are engaged in low-paid wage labor \nor  livelihood  activities  with  low  returns,  women  will  be  a  major  target  group.  In  multi-ethnic  GN \ndivisions,  ethnically  balanced  selection  will  be  instituted.  Specifically,  the  following  criteria  will \napply: \n \n\nCriteria for Selecting Beneficiaries  \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nAt  least  60%  of  households  are  poor,  based  on  a  multiple  set  of  indicators  covering \neconomic,  social,  vulnerability,  and  empowerment  dimensions\u2014such  as  income, \nhousing and sanitation conditions, education levels of household members, months of \nlow  work,  number  of  meals  during the  dry/low  season,  and  participation  in  community \norganizations. \nAt least 50% of beneficiaries are women, with priority to those from FHHs without adult \nmale wage earners. \nThe proportion of beneficiaries reflects the ethnic composition of the GN division.  \nlivelihood \nIndividual  beneficiaries  and  groups  wishing \nactivities/enterprises  will  have  to  meet  the  eligibility  requirements  of  NGOs  delivering \nmicrofinance under the Project. \n\nto  obtain  credit \n\nfor \n\nCriteria for Selecting Community Infrastructure and Environmental Interventions \n\n \nE. \n \n12.  Community infrastructure and environmental improvement interventions under components \n1 and 2, respectively, will be undertaken mostly at the community level in one GN division or in a \ngroup  of  several  GN  divisions,  based  on  priorities  identified  by  communities  and  proposals \nsubmitted  by  communities,  local  government  bodies.  Larger  scale  environmental  improvement \ninterventions  will  conform  to  the  SMA  development  plans.  Community  infrastructure  projects \n\n\f36 \n\n \nAppendix 5 \n\neligible  for  funding  include  the  construction  and  rehabilitation  of  minor  roads,  culverts,  drains, \nsmall-scale  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  simple  solid  waste  disposal  schemes,  and \ncommunity  buildings  (e.g.,  multipurpose  buildings,  day  care  centers,  and  playgrounds).  Coastal \nfishing  communities  that  meet  predetermined  selection  criteria  will  be  eligible  to  receive  simple \nfisheries support infrastructure including net repair sheds, market/auction halls, fisher rest houses, \nand  simple  cold  storage  facilities.  Environmental  improvements  will  include  solid  waste \nmanagement,  introduction  of  fuel-efficient  stoves  and  alternative  energy  (such  as  solar  power), \nhabitat restoration, habitat conservation, and implementation of public awareness programs.   \n \n13. \nAll  community  infrastructure  and  environmental  improvement  interventions  will  go \nthrough  an  approval  process  at  the  divisional  secretariat  level  by  the  divisional  coordinating \ncommittee (DVCC), chaired by the divisional secretary/divisional assistant director of planning, \nand including the divisional environment officer and an NGO representative. The peace/conflict \nscreening  instrument  for  infrastructure  and  environmental  interventions  (Table  A5.2)  will  also \nhave to be filled up. If the proposal requires more detailed technical assessment, the DVCC will \nhave  the  authority  to  recommend  that  the  project  consultant  team  assist  in  preparing  a  more \ndetailed  proposal.  Depending  on  the  nature  and  scope  of  the  intervention,  clearance  may  be \nrequired  from  the  relevant  approving  agency  (e.g.,  the  Central  Environmental  Authority  or  the \nCoastal  Conservation  Department).  Clearance  through  the  district  mine  action  committee  will \nalso be a precondition for initiation of any infrastructure development activity. The clearance will \nbe based on a general mine action assessment and, where required, a technical survey, which \nincludes  fencing  and  marking.  Proposed  interventions  will  be  ranked  according  to  beneficiary \nimpact  indicators,  such  as  investment  cost  per  beneficiary  and  number  of  beneficiaries,  with \npriority given to those with the greatest or most cost-effective impacts. Any subproject that could \nresult in resettlement impacts will be excluded if it cannot be restructured to avoid such impacts. \n \n14. \n \n(i) \n\nSelection criteria for community infrastructure interventions are the following: \n\n \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\nThe proposed infrastructure should be on public land; where private land is involved, this \nmust be voluntarily transferred at no cost to the Government. \nThe proposed infrastructure should be on land free from habitation. \nThe total cost of all community infrastructure projects implemented within a GN division \nshould not exceed $20,000. The overall limit will be raised to $35,000 for GNs eligible to \nreceive fisheries support infrastructure. \nThe estimated implementation period for specific community infrastructure interventions \nshould not exceed 6 months. \nThe  number  and  cost  of  approved  interventions  allocated  to  each  of  the  major  ethnic \ngroups  in  each  district  in  the  target  area  will  roughly  reflect  the  relative  proportions  of \nthose groups within the overall district population. \nA user group should be established at community level and priorities identified through a \nparticipatory needs assessment. \nThe  proposed  community \nlocated  within  (a)  any \narcheological reserve, ancient or protected monument as defined or declared under the \nAntiquities Ordinance (Chapter 188); (b) any national reserve declared under the Fauna \nand Flora Protection (Amendment) Act No. 49 of 1993; and (c) any mangrove area. \nIn the case of roads, priority will be given to village link roads that connect to district link \nroads and enhance livelihood activities. \nIn  the  case  of  water  supply  schemes,  only  small-scale  schemes,  including  wells,  hand \npumps, and rainwater collection tanks will be considered. The water source must be free \nof conflict and villagers must agree to allow access to all potential beneficiaries.  \n\ninfrastructure  should  not  be \n\n\fAppendix 5\n\n37 \n\n(x) \n\nBeneficiaries  of  improved  infrastructure  will  contractually  agree  through  a  partnership \nagreement to (a) implement, manage, and supervise the construction; and (b) bear the \nresponsibility  for  the  operation  and maintenance  (O&M)  requirements,  including  raising \nand managing the necessary maintenance funds through the formation of a community-\nbased user group. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n15. \nFor  GNs  to  receive  fisheries  support  infrastructure,  additional  participatory  needs \nassessment with concerned stakeholders will be conducted. The following criteria will apply in \naddition to those in paragraph 14:  \n \n(i) \n\nFishing communities with functioning systems and committees for marketing, and O&M \nof existing infrastructure will be prioritized. \nFishing  communities  with  demonstrated  environmental  efforts,  e.g.  proper  waste \ndisposal, proper handling of kerosene, etc., will be equally prioritized. \nMigratory fishing communities are eligible only to basic infrastructure (wells and latrines); \nresponsible parties, namely traders, boat owners, and fishing laborers will contractually \nagree  through  a  partnership  agreement  to  (a)  implement,  manage,  and  supervise  the \nconstruction; and (b) bear the responsibility for the O&M requirements, including raising \nand managing the necessary maintenance funds through the formation of a community \nuser  group  with  the  traders  and  boat  owners  contributing  and  the  GNs  taking  over \nresponsibilities in the absence  of the community. \nDevelopment of infrastructure and/or access facilities must not cause any disturbance to \ncoastal sand dunes, or alter naturally occurring estuarine sandbars. \nThe landing will be safe, free of obstacles and hazards . \n\n(v) \n \n16. \nThe  selection  criteria  for  small-scale  environment  improvement  interventions  costing  less \n \nthan $3,000 will include those listed above, as well as ecological considerations that will have to be \ndetermined  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  depending  on  the  specific  conditions  of  the  hot  spot  or  the \ntype  of  intervention  needed.  Site-specific  selection  criteria  could  include  an  assessment  of  the \nrelative  severity  of  the  environmental  degradation  being  addressed,  the  economic  significance  of \nthe impact on the natural resource base and the community, and the implications for public health. \nSmall-scale  environmental  improvement  should  also  be  located  within  SMA  areas  and  no  alien \nspecies should be introduced as part of the intervention. \n \n17. \nalso be located within SMA areas and meet the following criteria: \n \n(i) \n\nLarger-scale  environment  improvement  interventions  costing  more  than  $3,000  should \n\n(iv) \n\nWhen  located  on  public  land  and/or  water  bodies,  the  intervention  should  include \nbenefit-sharing  mechanisms  to  ensure  that  eventual  revenues  are  shared  among  the \nGovernment and implementers/beneficiaries. \nHabitat restoration and conservation interventions will be located on public land. Where \nprivate land is involved, this must be voluntarily transferred at no cost. \nThe total cost of the environmental intervention should not exceed $100,000. \nThe  intervention  should  be  included  in  the  pertinent  SMA  management  plan  and  be \nendorsed by the DCC. \nThe  intervention  should  have  a  sound  technical  basis  and  have  proven  sustainability, \nbased on recovery of at least the O&M costs. \nThe intervention will not lead to the introduction of alien species. \nThe Project\u2019s environmental screening and review procedures must be satisfied. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n \n \n\n\f38 \n\n \nAppendix 5 \n\nF. \n\nPeace/Conflict Screening Instruments \n \nTable A5.1: Peace/Conflict Screening Instrument for IP-NGO Selection \n\nQuestion \n\nYes / \nNo \n\nFollow-Up \n\n \n\nIs the NGO closely identified with any of the \nprotagonists  in  the  violent  conflicts  of  the \npast several years? \n\nIf  \u201cyes\u201d,  will  this  association  (direct  or  indirect) \nwith  violence  be  a  problem  if  this  NGO  is \nselected as a partner organization? \n\nWill  refusing  to  select  this  NGO  (if  it  does \nnot  score  well  on  the  other  criteria)  cause \nsignificant  social  or  political  problems  of \nany kind for the overall project? \n\nIf  \u201cyes\u201d,  how  can  these  problems  be  best \nmitigated? \n\nHas  the  NGO  had  to  work  in  politically/ \nsocially tense situations in the past? \n\nIf \u201cyes\u201d, do you have independent confirmation \nof how they dealt with such situations? \n\nDoes  the  NGO  have  a  written  policy  with \nregards \ntreating  different  ethnic  or \nreligious groups equitably? \n\nto \n\nIf  \u201cyes\u201d,  do  they  have  explicit  procedures  for \nensuring that this policy is respected? \n\nTable A5.2 Peace/Conflict Screening Instrument for Community Infrastructure and \nEnvironment Improvement Interventions \n\nQuestion \n\nYes / \nNo \n\n \n\nIs  there  a  risk  that  the  intervention  might \nfuel  inter-  or  intra-community  tensions,  for \nto  resources,  a \nexample  over  access \nweakened sense of security, etc.? \n\nIs  this  intervention  likely  to  advantage  one \nethnic group at the expense of another? \n\nDo  any  elements  of  the  implementation \nplan  risk  adding  to  local  tensions,  e.g.,  by \nnot  using  local  labor,  fueling  corruption \nbenefiting  local  elites,  excluding  parts  of \nthe community from decisionmaking? \n\nIs there a risk that the intervention might be \nco-opted  or halted  by  one  of  the  parties  to \nthe conflict? \n\nIf  conflicts  arise  regarding  the  intervention \nduring  implementation  or  afterwards  are \nthere \naccepted \nmechanisms in place to resolve them? \n\ngenerally \n\npractical, \n\nredesigned \n\nIf \u201cyes,\u201d are there ways the intervention should \nbe \nfor \nto  alleviate \nexample, by changing its location, redefining its \ntarget  beneficiaries,  clarifying  who  will  be \nresponsible for its ongoing operation, etc.? \n\nrisk, \n\nthis \n\nIf  \u201cyes,\u201d  does  the  design  of  the  intervention \nneed  to  be  reconsidered  to  reduce  potential \nresentment? \n\nIf \u201cyes,\u201d how can the plan be improved? \n\nexample, \n\nIf  \u201cyes,\u201d  what  needs  to  be  done  to  avoid  this \n(for \nproject \nbeforehand  with  the  concerned  party  to  obtain \ntheir support) \n\ndiscussing \n\nthe \n\nIf  \u201cno,\u201d  can  a  way  be  found,  either  within  the \nthe  overall  project  or  by \nparameters  of \nobtaining  external  expertise, \nthe \nto  assist \ncommunity to develop such a mechanism? \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6\n\n39 \n\n \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n\nTable A6.1: Project Cost Summary \n\n \n\n% \n\n \n\n% Total \n\nSLRs million \n\n$ Million \n\n \n\nForeign \n\nBase \n\nLocal \nCurrency\n\nForeign \nExchange\n\nTotal \n\nLocal \nCurrency\n\nForeign \nExchange\n\nTotal  Exchange Costs \n\n988.0 \n119.2 \n143.5 \n274.0 \n185.9 \n\n 1,710.7 \n132.2 \n379.4 \n 2,222.3 \n\n124.3 \n  66.4 \n114.7 \n228.1 \n  94.2 \n\n627.7 \n  62.8 \n179.2 \n869.7 \n\n  1,112.3 \n185.7 \n258.2 \n502.1 \n280.1 \n\n  2,338.4 \n195.0 \n558.6 \n  3,092.0 \n\n10.21 \n  1.24 \n  1.49 \n  2.84 \n  1.93 \n\n17.70 \n 1.37 \n 1.12 \n20.19 \n\n11.50 \n  1.92 \n  2.68 \n  5.20 \n  2.90 \n\n24.21 \n  2.02 \n  1.65 \n27.87 \n\n11 \n36 \n44 \n45 \n34 \n\n27 \n32 \n32 \n28 \n\n48 \n  8 \n11 \n21 \n12 \n\n    100 \n   8 \n   7 \n    115 \n\n-\n\n  58.1 \n\n  58.1 \n\n-\n\n  0.55 \n\n     100 \n\n  2 \n\n 2,222.3 \n\n927.8 \n\n  3,150.1 \n\n20.19\n\n28.43 \n\n29 \n\n    117 \n\n \n\n \n \nItem \n\n \n\n \n1.

The  approach  adopted  will  be  consistent  with  the  goals  and \nobjectives  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank-financed  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development \nProgram (RFSDP), which seeks to establish a sustainable rural financial system through policy \nadjustments and to improve the operations of rural financial institutions (RFIs). In line with the \napproach  adopted  under  RFSDP,  the  National  Development  Trust  Fund  (NDTF)  will  serve  as \nthe  apex  agency  for  channeling  credit  to  participating  financial  institutions  that  meet \npredetermined  eligibility  criteria.1  The  credit  scheme  will  operate  initially  through  microfinance \nnongovernment  organizations  (MF-NGOs)  that  operate  at  the  local  level,  with  expansion  to  a \nbroader  range  of  RFIs,  including  cooperative  rural  banks,  MF-fisheries  cooperative  societies, \nand  commercial  banks  once  the  delivery  system  has  developed.  As  such,  the  strategy  is  to \nprovide smaller loans for basic livelihood improvement and microenterprise development early \nin the Project, moving up to larger loans and enterprises later on. Currently, the NDTF has 12 \nMF-NGO credit partners in the Eastern Province.  \n \n2. \nAs  the  apex  agency,  the  NDTF  will  manage  the  credit  delivery  system  and  perform \nadministrative functions associated with refinance applications and loan disbursement requests \nby the MF-NGOs. The Project will assist the NDTF with capacity building, including of training \nfor MF-NGOs,2 and will facilitate vulnerable communities\u2019 access to microfinance through group \nformation and community organization. In particular, vulnerable communities will be assisted by \nIP-NGOs  in  identifying  viable  livelihood  activities  in  fisheries,  agriculture,  agroforestry  and  a \nrange  of  microenterprise  development  opportunities  based  on  nontraditional  activities. \nLivelihood and enterprise development services will also be extended to potential borrowers. \n \n3. \nThe NDTF will receive funds from the Government at the average weighted deposit rate \n(AWDR) under terms and conditions set out in a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to ADB \nfor  onlending  to  MF-NGOs.  The  MF-NGOs  will  add  their  transaction  costs\u2014currently  ranging \nfrom  10-16%\u2014to  the  AWDR  and  onlend  to  end  borrowers.  The  MF-NGOs  will  bear  the  credit \nrisk and will be free to determine lending rates based on their perception of risks and returns. \nTheir  activities  at  the  local  level  will  be  closely  coordinated  with  the  divisional  coordinating \ncommittees and implementing partner NGOs. A service charge of 0.5% will be levied by NDTF, \nwhich will enter into participation agreements with each MF-NGO before any onlending. \n \nIn line with the NDTF\u2019s current practice, the maximum loan amount will be set at SLRs \n4. \n \n30,000 per subborrower for the first loan, SLRs40,000 for the second loan, and SLRs60,000 for \nall  subsequent  loans,  with  a  maximum  term  of  36  months.  In  addition,  50%  of  the  onlending \nsupport will be directed at women.3 These criteria will be reviewed annually and may be revised \nas the credit delivery system develops. \n\n                                                 \n1 The criteria adopted will be the same as those under the RFSDP. \n2 A training and capacity building program has been developed for MF-NGOs in the project area.  \n3 Over 70% of the clients of microfinance NGOs currently operating in the Eastern Province are women. This is based \non the rationale that women are more responsible clients than men. Men who wish to take out loans are permitted to \nborrow only via their female relatives. As recent studies show, this has resulted in women being solely burdened in \naddition  to  other  household  tasks,  with  the  work  of  reducing  poverty  and  repaying  loans  taken  by  their  male \nrelatives. Thus the Project aims at gender parity in microfinance so that men take responsibility for their own loans, \nbecome aware of gender equity issues, and share with women the burden of overcoming poverty. \n\n\fIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n\nYear 1\n2\n3\n\n1\n\nYear 2\n2\n3\n\nYear 3\n2\n3\n\nYear 4\n2\n3\n\nYear 5\n2\n3\n\n4\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n\nYear 6\n2\n3\n\n4\n\n42 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\nItem\nA.

The  team  will  provide  35  person-months  of  international  and  381  person-months  of \ndomestic  consulting  services.  Consulting  tasks  will  be  in  two  categories:  (i)  to  provide  project \nmanagement support to the project office (PO) and district project offices (DPOs); and (ii) advise \nand guide the PO, DPOs, and implementing agencies on technical aspects of project activities \nrelating to components 1, 2, and 3. The project management consultants providing180 person-\nmonths  of  services,  will  be  recruited  individually.  In  addition,  (i)  implementing  partner \nnongovernment  organizations  (IP-NGOs)  will  be  engaged  to  assist  in  implementing  the \ncommunity-level  interventions  in  components  1  and  2;  (ii)  the  strategic  studies  for  coastal \nresource  management  in  the  Northern  Province  will  be  outsourced  to  a  team  of  international \nand domestic consultants; (iii) the detailed designs and feasibility studies for the fisheries harbor \nrehabilitation will be contracted out to qualified engineering firms; (iv) livelihood and enterprise \ndevelopment services (LEDS) will be provided by outside contractors; and (v) the project impact \nassessments will also be carried out by outside contractors.  \n \nB. \n \n\nSummary Terms of Reference \n\n1. \n\nProject Consultant Team \n\n \nA domestic project management specialist will be engaged to assist and support the PO \n2. \nand  the  three  DPOs  in  the  day-to-day  management  of  project  implementation,  including  work \nand  financial  planning,  procurement  of  goods  and  services,  coordination  and  monitoring  of \nproject  activities,  liaison  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and  other  concerned  parties,  and \nreporting. A team of international and domestic consultants will be engaged on a periodic basis \nto  provide  the  implementing  agencies  with  technical  guidance  in  specific  areas.  The  team  will \ncomprise  the  following:  (i)  natural  resource  planner;  (ii)  social  development  specialist;  (iii) \ninfrastructure  engineer; \ninformation,  education  and \ncommunication specialist; (vi) microfinance specialist; (vii) tourism planners; (viii) training needs \nspecialist; (ix) database specialists; (x) procurement specialist; (xi) fisheries specialist; and (xii) \nlegal  specialist.  Provision  has  also  been  made  for  other  short-term  specialists  in  a  range  of \ntechnical areas where their services may be required.  \n \n\n(iv)  environmental  engineer; \n\n(v) \n\n2. \n\nImplementing Partner NGOs \n\n \n3. \nSeveral  (2-4)  experienced  local  NGOs  will  be  selected  in  each  of  the  three  districts  to \nhelp implement the community-level interventions under components 1 and 2. The IP-NGOs will \n(i)  coordinate  the  design  and  implementation  of  interventions  in  livelihood  improvement, \ncommunity  infrastructure,  and  natural  resource  management  interventions;  (ii)  facilitate \ncommunity  mobilization,  needs  assessment,  and  support  in  preparing  community  subproject \nproposals; provide input into the planning process for integrated resource management\u2014such \nas  community  participation  in  resource  mapping\u2014in  the  Special  Management  Areas;  and  (iii) \ninitiate  community-based  enforcement  systems  to  assist  local  agencies  and  local  community \ngroups.  The  IP-NGOs  in  each  district  will  be  contracted  by  the  DPOs  in  consultation  with  the \nNGO  consortium  of  the  district.  A  separate  IP-NGO  with  demonstrated  experience  and \nsensitivity  in  addressing  the  needs  of  indigenous  peoples  will  be  engaged  to  develop  and \nimplement specific development activities for the coastal indigenous people. \n\n\fAppendix 11\n\n45 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nTechnical and Feasibility Studies in Coastal Resource Planning \n\n \n4. \nA  team  of  domestic/international  consultants  will  carry  out  a  strategic  technical  and \nfeasibility  study  on  coastal  resource  management  issues  in  the  Northern  Province  under \ncomponent  3.  The  study  will  (i)  review  all  related  studies,  including  ongoing  studies;  (ii) \nundertake  a  coastal  resource  assessment,  including  wetlands  (i.e.,  mangroves  and  marches), \nlagoons,  riverine  estuaries,  beaches,  sand  dunes,  islands,  and  coral  reefs;  (iii)  assess  the \nfish/marine  resource  base  and  related  local  industries,  including  traditional  industries;  (iv) \nassess  coastal  fishing  communities  and  other  resource  users;  (v)  assess  existing  fishing \nfacilities; (vi) identify coastal problems or areas of ecological or biodiversity significance (i.e., hot \nspots); (vii) identify options and needed interventions; (viii) identify the role of local government, \nNGOs, and local communities in addressing coastal problems and in managing the resources in \na sustainable manner; and (ix) identify research activities of immediate importance in managing \ncoastal resources in the province. \n \n\n4. \n\nDesign and Feasibility Studies for Fisheries Harbor Rehabilitation \n\n \n5. \nConsulting  firms  will  be  engaged  to  prepare  detailed  designs  and  undertake  feasibility \nstudies for rehabilitation of the fisheries harbors in Cod Bay and Valaichchenai. For each site, \nthe  consultants  will  (i)  prepare  a  site  investigation  program  with  regard  to  sediment  transport \nand  oceanographic,  bathymetric,  and  subsoil  data  collection;  (ii)  review  site  investigations, \nmodel  studies,  and  designs;  (iii)  prepare  work  plans  and  program  the  various  work  elements, \nincluding  those  for  site  investigations,  model  studies,  further  environmental  assessments, \ndesign,  costing  and  contract  documentation,  construction,  and  supervision;  (iv)  supervise  the \npreparation  of  standard  documents  for  inviting  and  prequalifying  consultants,  consultant \ncontracts, evaluation criteria, and contract tenders for investigations, studies, and construction; \n(v) coordinate procurement of equipment and materials, and construction of physical facilities in \nthe harbors; (vi) prepare final designs, drawings, and tender documents for specific structures or \ndredging  proposals;  and  (vii)  evaluate  contractors\u2019  tenders  and  preparation  of  detailed  cost \nestimates based on current construction costs. \n \n\n5. \n\nLivelihood and Enterprise Development Services \n\n \n\n \nThe  provision  of  LEDS  will  support  and  strengthen  the  livelihoods  component  of  the \n6. \n \nProject.  One  or  more  service  providers  will  be  contracted to  deliver  gender-sensitive  business \ndevelopment and appropriate technology packages. The services will be initially located at the \nDPOs.  The  service  providers  will  work  (i)  closely  with  the  IP-NGOs  supporting  livelihood \nimprovement  and  enterprise  development;  (ii)  conduct  training  programs;  and  (iii)  facilitate  a \nmentoring program linking small entrepreneurs with successful larger entrepreneurs to transfer \npractical business knowledge and skills within the region. Business development services that \nare  especially  tailored  to  the  needs  of  women  will  be  an  essential  part  of  these  packages.  A \nservice provider will also pilot-test appropriate technology alternatives, disseminate information \non such technology, and train clients in its use. \n \n\n6. \n\nProject Impact Assessments \n\n \n7. \nConsultants  will  be  engaged  to  assist  in  preparing  the  project  impact  assessment \nframework  and  undertake  the  required  studies  and  assessments.  At  the  beginning  of  the \nProject,  they  will  identify  strategic  indicators  that  will  focus  on  gender,  postconflict  impact \nassessments, poverty impacts, natural resource management, and institutional arrangements. \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\nFINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \nMany  of  the  expected  project  benefits  cannot  be  readily  quantified,  particularly  those \n1. \nfrom  improved  coastal  resource  management  and  planning,  and  social  infrastructure  and \nenvironmental  subproject  activities.  Improved  resource  management,  for  example,  seeks  to \nenhance the sustainability of economic activities and to reduce economic losses by preventing \nor  limiting  environmentally  destructive  or  inappropriate  resource-based  activities  in  the  coastal \nbelt.  The  community  infrastructure  subprojects  seek  to  meet  basic  needs  and  improve  living \nstandards of the targeted communities by constructing or rehabilitating small-scale water supply \nand sanitation schemes, minor roads, culverts and drains, solid waste disposal systems, small \ncommunity  buildings,  and  basic  fisheries  infrastructure.  Environmental  improvement  sub-\nprojects  will  include  mangrove  replanting,  solid  waste  management,  and  introduction  of \nalternative energy sources that will also produce benefits that are largely nonquantifiable. \n \nThe  livelihood  improvement  and  fisheries  development  interventions  have  more \n2. \nquantifiable  benefits.  However,  as  the  former  will  be  determined  largely  by  a  community \ndemand-driven process, it is difficult to predict the actual mix and scale of benefits. Therefore, \nonly the financial incentives for beneficiaries to adopt representative livelihood enterprises and \nthe  impacts  on  household  incomes  were  analyzed.  An  overall  benefit-cost  analysis  of  the \nlivelihood activities has not been attempted. Investments in fisheries development, however, are \namenable to standard economic analysis, the outcome of which is summarized in this appendix. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nLivelihood  enterprises  to  be  supported  under  the  sustainable  livelihood  improvement \ncomponent  of  the  Project  will  focus  on  activities  in  agriculture,  fisheries,  agroforestry,  and \nrelated enterprises servicing and adding value to these subsectors. In addition, a range of non-\ntraditional  livelihood  activities  could  be  supported.  Implementing  partner  nongovernment \norganizations  (IP-NGOs)  will  offer  a  wide  menu  of  livelihood  enterprise  models  from  which \nbeneficiaries  can  choose.  Beneficiary  perceptions  of  the  likely  returns  and  their  ability  to \nmanage  and  finance  the  enterprise  will  be  important  factors  in  enterprise  selection  and  in \ndetermining  the  eventual  mix  of  enterprises  supported.  Financial  models  were  prepared  for  a \nrange  of  indicative  enterprises  based  on  market  prices  in  the  project  area  to  determine  the \nfinancial incentives for beneficiaries to participate and the likely impact on household incomes, \nas well as to provide a basis for estimating financing requirements.1 Key financial indicators for \nthese enterprises are in Table A12. \n \n4. \nAnnual  enterprise  financial  margins  before  debt  service  range  from  about  SLRs12,800 \n($133) for a coconut nursery to SLRs96,900 ($1,000) for a prawn farm. Assuming an average \nhousehold  size  of  4.5  persons,  annual  per  capita  increments  range  from  SLRs2,845  ($29)  to \nSLRs21,533 ($222). In addition, returns to labor exceed the current financial opportunity cost of \nlabor  in  the  project  area,  which  ranges  from  SLRs80  to  SLRs120  per  day  depending  on  the \nseason and class of labor. As all enterprises are cash-flow positive after debt service (including \nthe first year, which means the financial rates of return are infinite), they should be attractive to \nrisk-averse, low-income households, including those headed by women. \n \n\nLivelihood Improvement \n\n                                                 \n1  More details on the livelihood enterprise models are presented in Supplementary Appendix E, where the marketing \n\nchannels for enterprise outputs are also discussed.  \n\n\fAppendix 12\n\n47 \n\nTable A12: Livelihood Enterprises and Financial Indicators \n\n \n \n\nEnterprisea/ \n\nMaldive Fish Production \nFishing \nDry Fish Production \nMarine Bivalve Culture \nPrawn Fishing \nBoat Engine Repairs \nSpice Garden \nRenting Cabanas \nBatik Products \nHairdressing Salon \nCashew Processing \nCoir Yarn Production \nProduction of Mats \nFood Processing \nHand Loom Products \nCane Products \nBrassiere Production \nBroom Production \nPalmyra Jaggery \nPalmyra Leaf Products \nBicycle Repair \nMushroom Production \nBanana Cultivation \nGoat Production \nDairy Production \nBig Onion Cultivation \nChili Cultivation \nCoconut Plant Nursery \n\n \n \nInvestmentb/ \n(SLRs) \n13,428 \n19,200 \n17,095 \n21,000 \n14,500 \n14,740 \n14,450 \n  8,985 \n18,920 \n14,815 \n17,835 \n16,900 \n10,200 \n12,187 \n31,050 \n10,705 \n18,050 \n12,775 \n  6,860 \n  2,534 \n22,975 \n  8,453 \n  8,453 \n19,900 \n27,550 \n32,680 \n31,180 \n31,180 \n\n \n \nMarginc/ \n(SLRs) \n66,690 \n49,500 \n47,880 \n35,500 \n96,900 \n60,000 \n63,000 \n62,400 \n74,760 \n79,020 \n56,475 \n68,400 \n55,980 \n58,590 \n85,200 \n53,340 \n85,500 \n64,322 \n23,940 \n23,940 \n87,600 \n41,469 \n53,577 \n58,200 \n46,640 \n53,000 \n40,700 \n12,800 \n\n \nReturn to \nLabord/ \n(SLRs) \n225 \n220 \n213 \n289 \n351 \n200 \n210 \n208 \n249 \n263 \n251 \n228 \n187 \n222 \n284 \n222 \n285 \n214 \n240 \n133 \n292 \n230 \n469 \n410 \n285 \n336 \n449 \n157 \n\n \nLoan \nTerm  \n(yr) \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n3.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n2.0 \n3.0 \n3.0 \n3.0 \n0.5 \n0.5 \n3.0 \n\n \n\n \n\na/   Enterprises are typically owner-operated with up to one part-time hired employee in some cases. \nb/   Includes working capital and physical contingencies of 10%.

While  indicative  loan  amounts  for  each  of  the  above \nenterprises  are  shown  in  the  table,  the  participating  MF-NGOs  will  set  individual  loan  limits \nwithin their overall lending policies. Most loans will have a 2-year term; however, a 3-year loan \nis  assumed  for  livestock  and  coconut  nursery  enterprises.  Initial  loans  will  finance  fixed \ninvestments such as equipment and initial working capital. Subsequent loans may be necessary \nto  provide  seasonal  finance  for  inputs  for  some  enterprises.  A  flat  rate  of  interest  of  12%  (the \nprevailing  rate  in  the  project  area)  has  been  assumed  for  the  debt  servicing  estimates.  Equity \ncontributions to be made by beneficiaries will be determined by MF-NGOs as part of their loan \n\n\f48 \n\n \nAppendix 12 \n\nevaluation  procedures.  However,  preliminary  analysis  suggests  that  most  livelihood  models \nshould be feasible with minimal beneficiary equity.  \n\n6. \nThe poverty and social analysis carried out as part of project preparation indicates that \nup  to  half  of  the  households  may  have  incomes  at  or  below  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  lower  poverty  line  of \nabout  SLRs46,000  per  annum.  As  shown  in  the  table,  the  estimated  annual  margins  for \nrepresentative  enterprises  at  full  development  would  in  most  cases  represent  very  large \nadditions to the incomes of poor households. It is projected that the Project\u2019s livelihood support \nactivities will reach at least 40,000 households, comprising nearly 200,000 persons, more than \nhalf of whom are estimated to be at or below the poverty line.  \n\n7. \nFailure of markets to absorb the output of proposed enterprises at sustainable prices is a \nsignificant risk, with demand for many of the products likely to be inelastic.  While markets in the \nproject area appear to be very competitive, little or no information is available on which formal \ndemand  analysis  can  be  based.  General  observations  and  NGO  and  other  agency  marketing \nexperiences  in  the  project  area  have  been  summarized  in  the  enterprise  profiles  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  E.  Staff  of  the  livelihood  enterprise  development  services  (LEDS) \nproviders  will  have  an  important  role  in  minimizing  market  risk.  They  will  survey  prices  and \nmarkets periodically and pass this information to the MF-NGOs for use in loan evaluation. The \ncredit  specialist  will  design  a  simple  monitoring  system  for  this  purpose.  MF-NGOs  will  be \nencouraged to share information about prices and trends in enterprise profitability. Introducing a \nsystem of evaluating and reporting portfolio performance by the enterprise sector will also help \nidentify market weaknesses and minimize the risk of continued lending to unprofitable ventures. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLimitations  in  the  ability  of  IP-NGOs  to  advise  beneficiaries  on  enterprise  development \n8. \npossibilities will be addressed through support by LEDS providers who will run training courses \nfor  NGO  staff  as  well  as  beneficiaries.2  Providing  orientation  on  market  opportunities  and \nconditions  will  in  fact  be  one  of  their  main  tasks.  LEDS  providers  will  also  use  the  public \ninformation  system  to  be  established  under  the  Project  to  disseminate  business  and  market \ninformation throughout the project area. Staff of the MF-NGOs will receive additional training in \nevaluating business proposals through training courses under the Project. \n \nC. \n \n\nFisheries Development \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n \nProject  funds  will  upgrade  existing  fishing  harbor  facilities  at  Cod  Bay  in  Trincomalee \n9. \nHarbor  and  at  Valaichchenai.  While  about  100  vessels  use  Cod  Bay  at  present,  many  of  the \nfacilities are run-down, resulting in long turnaround times and poor product quality. One cause \nof the poor turnaround time is congestion at the main wharf, which is partly due to inadequate \nmooring  facilities  and  deficiencies  in  unloading  services.  Work  proposed  under  the  project \nincludes (i) replacing equipment; (ii) constructing new moorings; (iii) constructing crew amenity \nfacilities; (iv) rehabilitating auction and net mending facilities, and (v) providing communications \nequipment.  \n\n10. \nApart  from  the  main  wharf,  the  facilities  at  Valaichchenai  are  largely  nonexistent  as  a \nresult  of  destruction  during  the  conflict  period.  Work  at  this  site  will  include  (i)  improving  the \n\n                                                 \n2  Agromart  for  example  conducts  market  surveys  and  packaging/marketing  seminars  as  part  of  its  introductory \ntraining program. In addition, it organizes trade fairs, entrepreneur competitions, and awareness-raising tours in the \nareas in which it operates, including in the Eastern Province. \n\n\fAppendix 12\n\n49 \n\nharbor entrance and channel; (ii) rehabilitating existing buildings; (iii) providing equipment; and \n(iv) providing additional facilities including crew amenities and improved access. No vessels use \nthe Valaichchenai wharf at present. Boats based in the area currently moor on the banks near \nthe harbor where unloading and provisioning are done by hand. \n\n11. \nFor  both  harbors,  improvements  will  allow  safe  mooring  year-round  for  both  multiday \n(MDB) and single-day (SDB) boats, safe access to the sea in most conditions, faster refueling \nand provisioning, and more efficient and hygienic fish handling. Vessel productivity is expected \nto improve while the availability of appropriate shore facilities is expected to lead to an increase \nin the number of vessels able to work the lucrative offshore tuna grounds. Catch composition is \nexpected  to  change  as  a  result  and  average  value  to  rise.  Improved  fish  handling  and \nprocessing in particular will raise fish values and reduce postharvest losses, and may facilitate \nthe development of an export-oriented fishing industry along the east coast. \n\n12. \nBoth  harbors  are  operated  by  the  Ceylon  Fisheries  Harbors  Corporation  (CFHC).  The \ncorporation aims to recover sufficient fees from users (fishers and concessionaires) and its own \ncommercial activities at the harbors (provision of fuel and water, for example) to cover at least \nannual  operating  costs.  Funds  for  periodic  maintenance  such  as  dredging,  and  for  new \ninvestments  are  expected  to  come  from  the  government  capital  development  budget.  No \ndividends are paid. CHFC proposes to move from the current system of charging fishers on a \nberthing  fee  basis  to  a  system  where  a  catch-weight  based  levy  is  imposed  at  the  port  gate. \nThis policy will effectively shift the responsibility for payment of fees from fishers to merchants. \nIn  the  analysis  which  follows,  the  objective  of  covering  operating  costs  is  tested  against  the \nproposed CFHC levy of SLRs1.5/kg ($15.54/ton) of fish at the port gate.2 \n\n \n\na. \n\nCod Bay \n\n \n13. \nInvestment  costs  are  estimated  at  $3.1  million,  including  design  and  supervision,  and \nphysical contingencies of 10%. Although work is expected to take 2-3 years, it will be possible \nfor  the  port  to  operate  at  present  levels  throughout  the  construction  period.  The  number  of \nvessels using the port is projected to grow from 116 when construction begins to 205 (about the \ncapacity  of  the  existing  main  wharf)  10  years  after  the  start  of  construction.  Catch  rates  per \nvessel  are  projected  to  remain  unchanged  with  the  Project  although  average  trip  length  is \nexpected to decline as turnaround time is improved, leading to an improvement in fish quality. \nThis  improvement,  together  with  an  increase  in  the  proportion  of  the  catch  represented  by \nhigher-value species, is projected to lead to an increase of 35% in the average unit value of the \ncatch, compared with the existing situation. These assumptions produce an average fish value \nat wharf gate of $880/ton.  \n\n \n\n14. \nUser  charges  were  estimated  on  the  basis  of  SLRs1.5/kg  ($15.54/ton)  of  fish  at  port \ngate. Under these assumptions, revenue from this source is sufficient to cover operating costs \nfrom year 5 following completion of the work, except in years 10, 15, and 20, when significant \nperiodic maintenance (e.g., dredging) is assumed to be required. Revenue will flow from other \nsources  during  the  life  of  the  investment,  including  the  provision  of  services  and  leasing  of \nharbor  facilities  to  the  private  sector  for  commercial  activities.3  The  ability  of  the  operation  to \ncover routine operating costs is sensitive to changes in assumptions about the growth in vessel \nnumbers. If the number of MDBs was to be only 80% of that proposed, the required levy would \n                                                 \n2 A detailed financial model for each harbor is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n3 The Cod Bay facility generated about SLRs1.5 million in  revenue from these other sources during 2001, primarily \nthe provision of water and fuel. Revenue flows from other sources are expected to rise significantly as the number \nof boat landings increases. \n\n\f50 \n\n \nAppendix 12 \n\nneed  to  rise  to  about  $19/ton  of  fish  at  wharf  gate  to  cover  routine  operating  costs,  excluding \nrevenue flows from other sources.  \n\nb. \n\nValaichchenai Harbor \n\n15. \nInvestment  costs  are  estimated  at  $2.3  million,  including  design  and  supervision,  and \nphysical contingencies of 10%. Construction work is expected to take about 2 years following an \ninitial  year  of  consultation,  planning,  and  design.  The  number  of  vessels  using  the  port  is \nprojected  to  grow  from  none  when  construction  begins    to  155  in  year  5  following \ncommissioning.  Catch  rates  for  vessels  using  the  harbor  are  expected  to  increase  from  20.6 \ntons per annum for a typical MDB presently berthed on the adjacent shoreline to about 25 tons \nper annum when using the harbor. Catch rates for SDBs are projected to rise from 14 tons per \nannum at present to 15.6 tons per annum when using the harbour. Average trip length for MDBs \nis  expected  to  increase  from  about  7  days  at  present  to  12  days  as  skippers  become  more \nconfident  that  they  can  enter  the  port  in  a  wide  range  of  weather  conditions.  Fish  quality  will \nimprove as ice supplies and onboard fish handling improve. These latter changes, together with \nan increase in the proportion of the catch represented by higher-value species, is projected to \nlead to an increase of 25% in the average unit value of the catch, compared with the existing \nsituation. These assumptions produce an average value at wharf gate of $760/ton.  \n\nUser  charges  were  estimated  on  the  basis  of  SLRs1.5/kg  ($15.54/ton)  of  fish  at  port \n16. \ngate. Under these assumptions, revenue is sufficient to meet operating costs from the time the \nport  becomes  fully  operational,  except  for  years  10,  15,  and  20  in  which  significant  periodic \nmaintenance  is  required.  The  ability  of  the  port  business  to  cover  operating  costs  is  relatively \ninsensitive  to  changes  in  assumptions  about  the  growth  in  vessel  numbers.  If  growth  in  the \nnumber of MDBs was to be only 80% of that proposed, routine annual operating costs could still \nbe  covered  at  the  above  charge  rate.  Additional  revenue  will  be  derived  from  commercial \nactivities at the harbor, including leasing the facilities to the private sector. \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n17. \nEach harbor upgrade proposal was evaluated on the basis of the projected throughput of \nfish  with  the  Project,  less  the  throughput  that  would  be  expected  without  the  Project. \nIncremental throughput is expected to arise largely from an increase in vessel numbers with the \nProject,  and  a  small  increase  in  catch  per  vessel  for  some  vessels.  Any  increase  in  vessel \nnumbers compared with the without-Project situation is regarded as incremental and investment \nand  operating  costs  for  these  vessels  were  included  in  the  analysis.  The  economic  worth  of \nservices provided by port operators or concessionaires (CFHC supply of fuel, for example) was \nassumed to be covered in full by the annual operating cost estimates for vessels. \n\nPrices  are  in  constant  2003  values,  ex-wharf,  adjusted  from  their  financial  values  by \n18. \nimputing  various  conversion  factors,  which  in  turn  were  estimated  using  a  shadow  exchange \nrate  factor  of  1.1.  A  domestic  price  numeraire  was  used,  therefore.  A  20-year  analysis  period \nwas used. For each port, a residual value estimated at 25% of the investment cost was included \nin the resource flow. Fishing vessels were assumed to have no residual value. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12\n\n51 \n\n19. \nFor the base case assumptions, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated \nat 25.5%. The estimate is sensitive to changes in the fish price\u2014if price were to fall by 10%, the \nEIRR  would  fall  to  20.7%,  and  a  10%  increase  produces  an  EIRR  of  30.2%.  With  a  10% \nincrease  in  port  investment  costs,  the  EIRR  would  fall  to  23.8%,  or  to  23%  if  boat  investment \ncosts rose concurrently by 10%. \n\na. \n\nCod Bay \n\nb. \n\nValaichchenai \n\n20. \nFor the base case assumptions, the EIRR was estimated at 35.4%. This estimate is also \nsensitive to changes in the fish price: if price were to fall by 10%, the EIRR would fall to 29.4%, \nand a 10% increase would produce an EIRR of 41.4%. A 10% increase in port investment costs \nwould  reduce  the  EIRR  to  33.1%,  or  to  32.6%  if  boat  investment  costs  rose  concurrently  by \n10%. If 20% fewer vessels used the harbor, the EIRR would still be acceptable at about 31%. \n\n \n\nc. \n\nFisheries Development Component \n\n \n \n21. \nAssuming (i) work on Cod Bay begins in year 4 of the Project; (ii) work on Valaichchenai \nbegins  in  year  2  of  the  Project;  and  (iii)  directly  related  training  costs  are  included,  the \nsubcomponent EIRR for the base case assumptions is 30.2%. \n\n\f52 \n\n \nAppendix 13 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nPoverty in Sri Lanka  \n\nA. \n \nThe  United  Nations  ranked  Sri  Lanka  84th  among  174  countries  in  the  human \n1. \ndevelopment  index  in  2000.  Sri  Lanka  has  made  substantial  gains  in  reducing  poverty,  as \nreflected  in  its  impressive  human  development  indicator,  with  0.73  being  by  far  the  highest  in \nSouth  Asia.  Poverty  in  Sri  Lanka  can  be  attributed  to  a  much  larger  extent  to  income  and \nconsumption than to access to basic services. It is a predominantly rural phenomenon with 87% \nof the total poor living in rural areas and distinct regional variations. Overall, about 40% of the \ncountry\u2019s population are either poor or vulnerable to poverty. \n \nDue to the conflict, the North and East have been excluded from official national surveys \n2. \nduring the last 17 years. However, data available at the district level and below suggest that the \narea  lacks  basic  services,  and  has  lost  productive  assets  and  social  capital.  At  least  60,000 \npeople  died,  and  close  to  two  thirds  of  households  were  displaced.  Economic  activities  are \nslowly  picking  up  after  the  declaration  of  a  cease-fire  in  early  2002.  Reducing  conflict-related \npoverty is one of the six pillars of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy.1 In the Poverty \nPartnership Agreement, the Government of Sri Lanka and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nagree that ADB will assist in addressing conflict-related poverty.2   \n \nB. \n \n3. \nMethodologies of Poverty and Social Analysis.  In the absence of reliable statistical \ndata on poverty and livelihoods in the North and East and nonavailability of head count data on \nincome  poverty  for  the  project  area,  the  project  preparatory  technical assistance  (PPTA)  used \nother proxy data combined with qualitative information. The PPTA included all Grama Niladhari \n(GN) divisions3 that border the coast or major lagoons\u2014396 GN divisions in the project area of \nthe three districts of Trincomalee, Batticaloa, and Ampara, comprising more than 800 villages. \nSix  indicators  were  selected  and  combined  into  a  vulnerability  index.4  Subsequently  the  GN \ndivisions  with  the  highest  prevalence  of  poverty  and  dependence  on  coastal  resources  for \nlivelihoods were identified. In 82 GN divisions, separate focus group discussions were held for \nmen and women\u2014a total of 1,594 villagers, comprising 806 men and 788 women. Of the 396 \nGN divisions (67 in Trincomalee, 173 in Batticaloa, 156 in Amparai) and taking the 45-50% level \nof the vulnerability index as the cutoff, 146 GN divisions are considered as the most vulnerable \n(Table  A13.1).  They  are  concentrated  in  northern  Trincomalee,  Kinniya/Muthur,  western \nBatticaloa,  and  southern  Ampara.  These  findings  were  cross-checked  and  confirmed  during \nloan  processing.  Due  to  the  cease-fire  and  the  changing  socioeconomic  situation,  the  PPTA \nfindings  were  revalidated  and  detailed  social  profiles  of  the  target  population,  with  particular \n\nLivelihoods and Poverty in the Project Area \n\n                                                 \n1   Government of Sri Lanka. 2002.

One  GN  division  commonly  consists  of  2-3 \n\nvillages with a population limit set at 250 families.   \n\n4   The  index  is  composed  of  (i)  the  percentage  of  households  with  female  heads  in  the  total  population  of  a  GN \ndivision; (ii) the number of displacements a community had experienced over the last 10 years; (iii) the number of \nrestrictions  affecting  sustainable  livelihood  within \nthe  community  (income  generating  activities,  mobility, \nprocurement and transport of essential items such as food and energy sources); (iv) access to safe drinking water \n(number  of  households  having  access  to  wells  or  piped  drinking  water  schemes);  (v)  access  to  sanitary  facilities \n(number of toilets per household); and (vi) the level of indebtedness (% of households within each GN division to \nbe indebted). \n\n\fAppendix 13\n\n53 \n\nattention to gender issues and minority groups, were prepared in a detailed poverty and social \nanalysis (PSA, Supplementary Appendix G). \n \n\nTable A13.1:  Project Area Statistics \n\n \n\nDistrict \n\nCoastal \nPopulation \n\nNo. of DS \nDivisions \n\nNo. of GN \nDivisions \n\nTrincomalee \nBatticaloa \nAmpara \nTotal \n\n116,358 \n244,652 \n184,436 \n545,473 \n\n  6 \n12 \n13 \n31 \n\n  67 \n173 \n156 \n396 \n\nNo. of Most \nVulnerable \nGNs \n\n  35 \n  88 \n  23 \n146 \n\nNo. of Most \nVulnerable \nGNs in SMAs\n16 \n63 \n  5 \n84 \n\nDS division = subdistrict administrative level; GN division = Grama Niladhari division; SMA = special  \nmanagement area.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n4. \nCharacteristics  of  Poverty.  Poverty  in  the  region  is  characterized  as  conflict-related, \nwith  displacement,5  loss  of  assets,  physical  injuries,  death  of  family  members,  and  military-\ninduced  restrictions  on  the  practice  of  customary  livelihoods,  such  as  farming  and  fishing, \ncontributing  to  it.  Due  to  the  conflict,  there  has  been  lack  of  continuous  employment  and \nconcomitant skills development. Declining standards of education and  earning a living instead \nof going to school have led to a continuous loss of capabilities and skills especially among the \nyoung.  The  conflict  was  deeply  embedded  in  the  sociopolitical,  economic,  and  cultural \nstructures. It had become everyday reality, with hopelessness and frustration being an integral \npart  of  life  and  undermining  the  capacity  to  cope  with  psychological  stress,  shock,  and  war-\nrelated  trauma.  Throughout  the  conflict,  the  population  concentrated  on  short-term  survival \nrather than on any form of sustainable management of natural resources. The only recent large-\nscale  study6  found  income  levels  within  the  northern  and  eastern  areas,  not  controlled  by  the \nLiberation Tigers of Tamil Eilam (LTTE), to be similar to average income levels within the rest of \nthe country. This is largely attributed to the remittances sent by family members from overseas. \nIn coastal communities of the Eastern Province, poverty is highly variable and seasonal, and as \nmuch a result of lack of savings and other practices such as alcoholism, as of degradation of the \nresource base due to a multiplication of users. \n \n5. \nPopulation and Ethnic Composition. The total population of the coastal GN divisions \nis 545,473, more than one third of the total population of the three eastern districts in 396 GN \ndivisions,  which  comprise  more  than  800  villages.  The  average  population  per  GN  division  is \nabout  1,450.  Major  changes  in  ethnic  composition  have  occurred  at  the  district  level.  In \nTrincomalee district, the proportion of Muslims increased by 10% between 1981 and 1999, while \nthe  proportion  of  Sinhalese  decreased  in  the  two  northernmost  districts  and  increased  in \nAmpara district. The proportion of Tamils increased in Batticaloa and decreased in the two other \ndistricts. Ethnic segregation continues down to the GN divisional level, with communities living \nin  separate  villages  or  sections  of  villages.  Primary  education  being  either  in  Tamil  or  in \nSinhalese effectively supports segregation of children of different communities at an early age. \nThe  implication  is  that  project  activities  in  vulnerable  coastal  communities  will  address  mainly \nthe problems and needs of Tamils and Muslims. \n \n\n                                                 \n5   In  the  project  area,  264  out  of  396  GN  divisions  reported  one  or  more  displacements  (defined  as  a  need  for  a \nsignificant proportion of the population to leave their homes temporarily). Of these the majority were in Batticaloa \nand Trincomalee, where about 80% of GN divisions have suffered displacement. \n\n6   World Bank 2001.

Deep  fractures  have  been  created  and  ethnic \nsegregation  has  led  to  setting  up  separate  municipal  governments,  markets,  or  even  bus \nstands.  Ethnic  tensions  have  been  accentuated.  The  fishing  industry  has  become  highly \nsegregated  along  ethnic  lines.  The  conflict  has  resulted  in  a  substantial  loss  of  assets  by  the \nTamil  population,  exacerbated  by  the  problems  and  restrictions  faced  by  Tamil  fishers  in  their \nin  many  ways.  Business \ndealings  with \nestablishments run by, or catering to a specific ethnic group, tend to broadcast their ethnicity by \nsigns either in Sinhala or Tamil, in which relatively few people are fluent in both. There is a high \nincidence  of  disputes  between  members  of  different  ethnic  groups  that  can  become  violent. \nCommunities that once lived together and cooperated in livelihood activities are now segregated \nand mistrust each other.  \n \n7. \nSocioeconomic Profiles of Resource Users. The PSA identified the different resource \nusers  in  the  project  area:  (i)  the  fishing  population;  (ii)  fisher-farmers;  (iii)  farmers  and \nbuffalo/cattle herders; and (iv) micro/small entrepreneurs.7 The PSA found the social structure in \nfisheries communities, the tenure system, and ownership of fishing assets to be very complex. \nMany households have multiple sources of livelihoods and boundaries among different types of \nresource  users  are  not  clear-cut.  Significant  differences  occur  between  resource  users  in  the \nmarine and lagoon systems. The socioeconomic status and extent of poverty in marine fishing \ncommunities  depend  on  ownership  of  fishing  assets.  Owners  of  large  sea  canoes  had \ncomparably  more  secure  incomes  than  laborers  and  owners  of  fiberglass  boats,  despite  high \nindebtedness  due  to  capital  costs  of  nets,  boats,  and  engines,  and  are  a  relatively  well-off \ngroup.  Lagoon  fisher  men  and  women  are  among  the  poorest  income  groups  because  of \ngenerally  poor  catch  sizes.  Most  lagoon  households  have  to  complement  their  livelihoods \nthrough  migratory  wage  labor,  microbusinesses,  or  environmentally  destructive  activities  like \nsand  mining  or  cutting  of  firewood  for  sale  from  forests  and  mangroves.  Poverty  in  fishing \ncommunities is characterized by seasonality of incomes, compounded by an excess of fishing \nlaborers and poor savings habits, with earnings in the high season often becoming repayment \nfor debts incurred in the low season.  High rates of alcoholism exacerbate the situation. Mixed \nforms of farming and fishing were practiced in some areas during the conflict, since fishers faced \n\nis  reinforced \n\n                                                 \n7   The detailed socio-economic profiles are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n\n\fAppendix 13\n\n55 \n\nfishing restrictions while farmers did not have access to their fields, due to mining, the presence of \narmy camps, and the crossfire between the LTTE and the armed forces. With the peace process \nlifting the restrictions, many people are going back to working as either fishers or farmers, rather \nthan both.  \n \n8. \nA Coastal Minority Group. Small groups of coastal Vedda live scattered at the fringes \nof  villages  within  the  DS  divisions  of  Eachilampattai/Muthur  in  Trincomalee  district,  and  Koralai \nPattu North and Koralai Pattu in Batticaloa district. The Government does not consider them as \nan  indigenous  community,8  no  separate  statistics  exist,  and  the  Vedda  themselves  in  most \ncases would not like to be considered as indigenous people because this leads to stigmatization \nand  underscores  their  marginalization.  They  practice  group-oriented  hunting,  gathering,  and \nfishing. They have retained a number of cultural traditions while being partially incorporated into \nthe  market  economy.  They  have  experienced  many  centuries  of  assimilation  and  integration \nwith  the  Tamil  communities  among  whom  they  have  resided.  Their  living  conditions  are \nextremely  poor  compared  with  those  of  their  neighbors.    They  lack  access  to  basic  amenities \nand    have  high  numbers  of  school  dropouts.  Child  labor  is  prevalent.  Alcohol  abuse  is \nconsiderable.  In  the  PPTA  focus  group  discussions,  they  identified  lack  of  housing  and  basic \ninfrastructure,  insufficient  income,  alcoholism  (among  both  men  and  women),  dependency, \ninability to engage in traditional livelihood activities, and stigmatization as their major problems. \nTheir present carefully balanced and extremely diversified livelihoods will not allow them to benefit \nimmediately from the Project. Separate, more holistic project interventions and the recruitment of \na  nongovernment  organization  with  demonstrated  sensitivity  in  working  with  small  minority \ngroups will be needed to ensure socially and culturally sensitive, and targeted improvement of \ntheir  living  conditions.  The  proposed  Project  will  not  adversely  affect  the  coastal  indigenous \npeople,  but  will  ensure,  through  particular  efforts,  better  outreach  to  this  group.  Thus,  the \npreparation of an indigenous people\u2019s plan according to ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples is \nnot necessary. \n \nC. \n \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\n \nSignificant/ \nNonsignificant/ \nNone \nNone \n\n \nSubject \n\nResettlement \n\n \n\n \nPlan Required \n\nNo, but \nresettlement \nframework \nprepared \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n \n\nto \n\nreceive  simple \n\nCommunity  infrastructure  interventions  include  constructing  and \nrehabilitating  of  minor  roads,  culverts,  drains,  small-scale  water \nsupply  and  sanitation  facilities,  simple  solid  waste  management \nschemes,  and  community  buildings.

An  inequitable  gender  division  of  labor  continues  to  put \nadditional  strain  on  women  in  fulfilling  supposedly  male  tasks.  In \naddition, as a consequence of the conflict, high numbers of very poor \nhouseholds  headed  by  females  exist.  The  Project  is  classified \nGender and Development. \nSmall  but  extremely  poor  and  marginalized  communities  of \nindigenous  coastal  Vedda  also  reside  within  the  project  area. \nSeparate  livelihood  interventions  have  been  developed  to  ensure \nthat the Vedda\u2019s specific needs are addressed in a socially sensitive \nmanner.  The  Project  will  support  a  separate  more  holistic  project \nintervention  through  a  NGO  with  demonstrated  sensitivity  in  working \nwith  small  minority  groups  and  ensuring  socially  sensitive,  targeted \nimprovement of their living conditions. \n \nEmployment opportunities  will be available  on an equal basis to all, \nirrespective of gender, ethnic, or religious groups. \n\nNone \n\nProject  design  pays  particular  attention  to  improving  access  of  the \npoor  and  vulnerable  groups \nto  goods  and  services;  project \ninterventions are targeted at vulnerable groups.   \n\nThe Project was designed with particular attention to ensuring \nequitable and inclusive social development, including the most \nvulnerable groups, with specific focus on different ethnic groups at  \nthe community level.    \n\nLabor \n\n \nAffordability \n\nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n \n\nNone \n\nNone \n\nGender \nstrategy and \nplan prepared \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 14\n\n57 \n\nSUMMARY ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS \n\nIntroduction \n\n(ADB)  guidelines, \n\nIn  accordance  with \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nthe  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \ninitial \nenvironmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were  prepared  as  part  of  project  preparation.  The  IEEs \nassessed the environmental implications of project interventions, identified mitigation measures, \nand  developed  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs).  In  view  of  the  different  typologies \nand  locations  of  the  interventions,  five  IEEs  were  prepared  to  cover  project  activities  in  the \nspecial management areas (SMAs) and the rehabilitation of two existing fisheries harbors. The \ntypology  of  community  interventions  planned  outside  the  SMAs  was  examined  within  the \nframework  of  the  IEEs  conducted  for  the  SMAs.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environment \ncategory B under Environmental Considerations in ADB Operations. Project interventions were \nscreened with reference to the Environmental Assessment Guidelines of the Asian Development \nBank (2003). \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe project area is located in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. Its landscape is relatively flat. \nSoils  are  mostly  sandy  regosols  and  recent  beach  sands  with  areas  of  riverine  alluvial.  The \ncontinental shelf is about 80 meters wide and more than 60 meters deep. However, some deep \nsubmarine  canyons  are  found  close  to  the  shore.  The  coastline  has  many  fringing  coral  and \nbarrier reefs and wetlands. There are four major rivers with associated alluvial plains. \n \n3. \nThe  coastal  habitats  of  the  project  area  include  estuaries  and  lagoons,  beaches,  sand \ndunes,  islands,  and  coral  reefs.  Large  areas  of  mangrove  forest,  as  well  as  seagrass  beds, \noccur  in  the  intertidal  areas  along  the  shores  of  bays  and  estuaries,  and  in  lagoons.  Marine \ncoastal  ecosystems  support  high  biodiversity  and  are  habitat  for  economically  important \nspecies.  Coastal  marshes  and  wetlands  are  feeding  grounds  for  migratory  waterfowl.  Sand \ndunes stabilize coastlines, protect interior lands from salty winds and storm waves, and prevent \nsaltwater intrusion. The wetlands have special environmental significance and are threatened by \ninappropriate  solid  waste  management,  pollution,  blockage  of  natural  water  exchange,  algal \nblooms,  invasion  of  alien  species,  and  habitat  destruction  through  cutting  of  mangroves  and \nreclamation  of  lagoon  margins.  Although  under  great  pressure,  mangroves  in  the  project  area \nrepresent a substantial share of those in the country. Trincomalee Bay and Batticaloa Lagoon \nare the two most important ecosystems along the eastern coast. Pressure on these areas has \nintensified as a consequence of the conflict, exacerbated by lack of effective coastal resources \nmanagement and law enforcement. Within the project area, six sites are formally designated as \nprotected areas, and classified as sanctuaries. \n \nCultural  landmarks  include  temples,  mosques,  and  16th/17th  century  Dutch  and \n4. \nPortuguese forts. Southern Ampara lies on a historic pilgrimage route to Kataragama, a Hindu \nholy site, and also features two important megalithic sites. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nSustainable  Livelihood  Improvement  (Component  1).  This  component  will  be \nsupported  through  a  microfinance  delivery  system  consisting  of  individual  loans  mostly  in  the \nrange  of  $50-100;  technical  advice;  mentoring  and  capacity  building  in  fisheries,  agriculture, \nagroforestry, and a range of nontraditional activities. The IEEs have prescribed the exclusion of \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \n\nto \n\nthe  use  of  environmental-friendly \n\nany  sites  of  ecological,  archeological,  or  historic  importance;  the  adoption  of  integrated  pest \nmanagement practices; and the use of certified multiplication and stocking materials. The IEEs \nhave  also  proscribed  the  introduction  of  alien  species.  Support  for  ecotourism  will  include \ncapacity  building  in  delivering  services  and  developing  community-managed  ecotourism  and \nbeach-tourism  related  microenterprises,  all  based  on  prudent  and  regulated  access  to  natural \nresources,  and  on  culturally  acceptable  practices.  Owing  largely  to  the  screening  procedures \nthat will be in place; to the small scale, dispersed nature, and low intensity of the enterprises; \nand \ntechnologies;  no  significant  or  cumulative \nenvironmental impacts are expected. \n \n6. \nCommunity infrastructure will be financed with a limit of $20,000 set per GN division and \n$35,000  for  GN  divisions  eligible  to  receive  fisheries  support  infrastructure.  Proposed \nsubprojects will be subject to a series of stringent selection criteria (Appendix 5) and subject to \nenvironmental  review  procedures  (Supplementary  Appendix  N).  Microprojects  eligible  for \nfunding include the construction and rehabilitation of minor roads, culverts, drains, small-scale \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  simple  solid  waste  disposal  schemes,  community \nbuildings, net repair sheds, auction halls, rest houses, and cold storage facilities. Environmental \nimplications  have  been  identified  and  addressed  either  by  having  exclusion  criteria  in  the \nselection  process  (Appendix  5)  or  by  recommending  mitigation  measures  supported  by \nappropriate budgetary provisions. The use of asbestos has been proscribed. \n \n7. \nResource  Management  in  Three  SMAs  (Component  2).  This  component  involves \nactivities whose precise locations are still to be specified, and should therefore be considered as \nprototypes.  Mangrove  rehabilitation,  wetland  management,  and  protection  of  coastal  sand \ndunes  and  other  habitats  of  ecological  and  biological  significance  will  support  habitat \nconservation  and  rehabilitation.  Provided  appropriate  consultative  processes  are  undertaken \nand  no  alien  species  are  introduced,  these  activities  will  have  mainly  positive  environmental \nimpacts.  Environmental  improvements  will  include  introduction  of  fuel-efficient  stoves  and \nrenewable energy sources, waste recycling, and small-scale solid waste management (SWM). \nEnvironmental  implications  of  SWM  have  been  identified  and  mitigation  measures  prescribed. \nThis  component  will  also  improve  institutional  capacity  for  environmental  management  and \ncommunity-based conservation, and will lead to improved local-level resource management.  \n \n8. \nCoastal  Resource  Planning  (Component  3).  This  component  involves  strengthening \nof  planning  capacities,  improving  decision  making,  and  establishing  functional  monitoring  and \nregulatory systems, all of which will contribute to improved natural resource management.  \n \n9. \nRehabilitation  of  the  Fisheries  Harbors  (Component  4).  The  IEEs  identified \nenvironmental  impacts  that  could  arise  from  (i)  location,  in  terms  of  construction  of  a  mooring \njetty  and  new  buildings;  (ii)  design,  in  terms  of  possible  minor  changes  in  the  sediment \nequilibrium  due  to  the  construction  of  the  jetty;  (iii)  implementation,  in  terms  of  social  impacts \ndue  to  mobilization  of  large  construction  teams,  and  localized  pollution  caused  by  careless \nhandling  of  construction  materials;  and  (iv)  operations,  in  terms  of  pollution  due  to  poor \nmanagement  of  solid  waste  and  effluents.  Mitigation  measures  have  been  prescribed  and \ninclude  modeling  possible  changes  to  the  hydrology  and  sediment  equilibrium  to  design  the \nmooring  jetty;  contractors  adopting  safety  precautions  and  managing  their  work  force \naccordingly;  careful  handling  and  disposal  of  construction  debris  (e.g.,  asbestos);  and \nestablishing  facilities  and  procedures  for  handling  human  effluents,  solid  waste,  workshop  by-\nproducts and residues resulting from fisheries handling/processing. Civil works will temporarily \nincrease  suspended  sediments  and  turbidity  in  the  lagoon,  but  effects  on  the  overall  lagoon \necosystem will be negligible. No significant disruption to traffic and utilities is expected to occur \n\n\fAppendix 14\n\n59 \n\nEnvironmental Management Plans \n\nduring  the  construction phase  of  the  harbor  rehabilitation. An  environmental  protection  license \nwill be necessary for the ship repair yard/workshop to become operational. \n \nD. \n \n10.  Within the coastal zone, development activities are subject to the issuance of permits by \nCoastal  Conservation  Department  of  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Ocean  Resources  or\u2014in \nselected cases\u2014by the district secretariats. Elsewhere within the project area, undertakings are \nsubject  to  the  provisions  of  the  National  Environment  (Amendment)  Act  No.  53  of  2000.  Both \ncases require the preparation of environmental analysis at varying levels of detail depending on \nthe environmental implications of the intervention. \n \nPreliminary  EMPs  have  been  developed  as  part  of  the  five  initial  IEEs.  For  each  sub-\n11. \nproject,  more  detailed  instruments  will  be  prepared  at  the  detailed  design  stage  with  the \nassistance  of  an  environmental  engineer  hired  as  part  of  the  consultant  support  team.  The \nEMPs  will  refer  to  standards  set  out  by  the  Central  Environmental  Authority.  Environmental \nmonitoring  will  be  conducted  by  divisional  environmental  officers  supported  by  the  services  of \nan accredited laboratory based in Batticaloa. Within SMAs, local communities will play an active \nrole in monitoring resource use and access, as their skills will be enhanced as part of the SMA \nprocess.  Project  implementing  partners  will  be  provided  with  global  positioning  systems  and \ntrained  to  precisely  locate  resources  and  associated  environmental  issues.  Records  will  be \ncompiled  and  transmitted  to  the  divisional  coordinating  committee  and  to  the  district \ncoordinating  committee  for  monitoring  purposes.  In  its  progress  reports,  the  North  East \nProvincial Council (NEPC) will include a detailed report on the experience with implementation \nof the EMPs. \n \nE. \n \nA  number  of  consultations  carried  out  during  project  preparation  involved  various \n12. \nstakeholders  including  district-based  nongovernment  organizations.  Public  notices  in  English, \nTamil, and Sinhala were posted in national newspapers and IEEs were uploaded on the web of \nthe  NEPC  in  August  2003.  Hard  copies  of  the  reports  were  made  available  to  the  public  in \nColombo, and at district and provincial levels. Follow-up public hearings were held in the three \nSMAs in September 2003. \n \nF. \n \n13. \nEnvironmental  benefits from  the  Project  will  result  from  (i)  direct  protection  of  sensitive \nand  valuable  natural  resources;  (ii)  rehabilitation  of  altered  or  damaged  habitats;  (iii)  building \npublic  awareness  of  the  need  for  environmental  protection  and  management;  (iv)  building \ninstitutional capacity for effective environmental planning and management; (v) implementation \nof  measures  that  are  designed  to  minimize  pollution  and  manage  waste  streams;  and  (vi) \npromotion  of  livelihoods  that  are  environmentally  friendly.  The  IEE  studies  have  shown  that \nenvironmental  impacts  associated  with  the  proposed  Project  are  manageable  and  can  be \nmitigated.  In  addition,  Supplementary  Appendix  N  assures  that  national  legislation  and  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental  policies  are  adhered  to  and  that  no  work  will  be  undertaken  until  appropriate \napprovals have been granted. The Project has sufficient contingencies should additional studies \nand mitigation measures be necessary. \n \n14. \nThe overall finding of the IEEs is that the Project will not cause significant environmental \nproblems  and  that  potential  adverse  impacts  are  manageable  through  proper  site  location, \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\nConclusions and Recommendations \n\n\f60 \n\n \nAppendix 14 \n\ndesign, construction, and management. The Project can therefore be classified under Category \nB:  projects  judged  to  have  some  adverse  environmental  impacts,  but  of  lesser  degree  or \nsignificance  than  those  for  category  A  projects.  The  IEEs  are  considered  adequate  and  the \npreparation of a full environment impact assessment is not required. \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 3  November 2003) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "Sri Lanka rupee/s (SLRe/SLRs) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "SLRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n \n", " \n", "$0.0105 \nSLRs94.80 \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nAF \nAWDR \nCBO \nCCD \nCEA \nCFHC \nCRMP \nDCC \nDEO \nDPD \nDPO \nDS \nDVCC \nEIRR \nFHH \nGN \nIA \nICB \nIDP \nIEC \nIEE \nIP-NGO \nITDG \nLCB \nLEDS \nLTTE \nMDB \nMF \nMF-NGO \nMFI \nMHAPCLG \n", "NDTF \nNECORD \nNEERP \nNEIAP \nNEPC \nNGO \nO&M \nPD \nPIA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAgromart Foundation \naverage weighted deposit rate \ncommunity-based organization \nCoastal Conservation Department \nCentral Environmental Authority \nCeylon Fisheries Harbor Corporation \nCoastal Resource Management Project \ndistrict coordinating committee \ndivisional environmental officer \ndistrict project director \ndistrict project office \ndistrict secretariat \ndivisional coordinating committee \neconomic internal rate of return \nhousehold with female head \nGrama Niladhari \nimplementing agency \ninternational competitive bidding \ninternally displaced person \ninformation, education and communication \ninitial environmental examination \nimplementing partner-NGO \nIntegrated Technology Development Group \nlocal competitive bidding \nlivelihoods and enterprise development services \nLiberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam \nmultiday boat \nmicrofinance \nmicrofinance NGO \nmicrofinance institution \nMinistry of Home Affairs, Provincial Councils, and Local \nGovernment \nNational Development Trust Fund \nNorth East Community Restoration and Development Project \nNorth East Emergency Reconstruction Program \nNorth East Irrigated Agriculture Project \nNorth East Provincial Council \nnongovernment organization \noperations and maintenance \nproject director \nproject implementation agreement \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "project implementation unit \nProvincial Ministry of Agriculture \nparticipatory needs assessment \nproject office \nproject performance management system \nprovincial planning secretariat \nproject preparatory technical assistance \npoverty and social assessment \nquality and cost-based selection \nrural finance institution \nRural Finance Sector Development Program \nsingle day boat \nsecond generation imprest account \nspecial management area \nsolid waste management \nspecial drawing rights \nSarvodaya Economic Enterprise Development Services \nstatement of expenditure \n", "PIU \nPMA \nPNA \nPO \nPPMS \nPPS \nPPTA \nPSA \nQCBS \nRFI \nRFSDP \nSDB \nSGIA \nSMA \nSWM \nSDR \nSEEDS \nSOE \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n \n \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year of the Government ends on 31 December. \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "This  report  was  prepared  by  P.
