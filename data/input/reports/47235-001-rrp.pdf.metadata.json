Sedimentation  has  reduced  the \nbarrage\u2019s flood passage capacity (FPC) by 30% from 18,265 cubic meters per second (m3/s) in \n1939 to 12,743 m3/s in 2013. The Panjnad barrage is also on the Chenab River, 250 kilometers \n(km)  downstream  from  the  Trimmu  barrage.  Aging,  structural  deterioration  and  instability,  and \nlow  FPC  exposed  these  barrages  to  high  risk  of  failure  and  resulted  in  unreliable  irrigation \nsupplies and downstream flooding.3  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nIrrigated  agriculture  on  8.4  million  ha  in  Punjab  (i)  accounts  for  28%  of  Punjab\u2019s  gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP),  (ii)  employs  54%  of  the  labor  force,  (iii)  produces  90%  of  Punjab\u2019s \nagricultural  output,  and  (iv)  uses  more  than  90%  of  the  water  resources.  Punjab\u2019s  agricultural \nGDP  is  66%  of  the  national  agricultural  GDP.  Of  Punjab\u2019s  population,  77%  live  in  rural  areas \nthat  mainly  depend  on  agriculture  for  livelihood  and  where  the  incidence  of  poverty  is  30%\u2013\n35%.  Irrigated  agriculture  is  crucial  to  generating  higher  incomes  and  attaining  Punjab\u2019s \ntargeted 6%\u20137% growth rate (3% in 2011\u20132012). \n  \n4. \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2009\u20132013  for  Pakistan  prioritizes  improving  the \nirrigation infrastructure.4 ADB\u2019s agriculture sector evaluation for Pakistan emphasized improving \nwater  resources  and  irrigation. 5  The  water  sector  road  map  identified  improving  the \ninfrastructure,  institutions,  and  agricultural  production  to  drive  sustainable  agricultural  growth. \nPunjab\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development  Framework  (2012\u20132015)  estimates  an  investment \nrequirement  of  over  $100  million  per  year  for  irrigation  and  allocates  PRs9  billion  ($90  million \nequivalent)  for  new  irrigation  projects. 6 The  country  assistance  program  evaluation  (CAPE), \n2002\u20132012  assessed  Pakistan\u2019s  agriculture  and  natural  resource  sector  less  than  successful, \nbut  it  evaluated  the  program  relevant  in  terms  of  its  alignment  with  government  and  ADB \nstrategies.7 The  CAPE  rated  the  agriculture  and  natural  resources  program  satisfactory  for  its \nstrategic  positioning  and  the  evaluation  viewed  as  appropriate  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to  support \nPakistan in responding to the need to rehabilitate and expand the Indus River irrigation system. \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The districts are Bahawalpur, Jhang, Lodhran, Multan, Muzaffargarh, Rahimyar Khan, and Vehari. \n3  The project was prepared  under the  multitranche  financing facility for the Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment \n\nProgram; project preparatory technical assistance was not provided.  \n\n4  ADB. 2009.

Manila.  \n\n\fThe  recommendations  of  the  CAPE  regarding  agriculture,  natural  resources,  and  rural \ndevelopment sector have been incorporated in the project design.  \n \n5. \nIn  Punjab,  the  irrigation  infrastructure  has  seriously  deteriorated  because  of  aging  and \ndeferred  maintenance.  Climate  variability  will  further  add  risks  by  changing  frequency  and \nintensity  of  extreme  events  such  as  flood  and  drought.8 The  infrastructure  has  an  estimated \nreplacement value of $20.0 billion,9 while the estimated cost to upgrade the system to modern \nstandards  is  $3.5  billion.  Barrages  constitute  the  most  strategic  component  of  the  large \ncontiguous irrigation systems. Their structural stability and effective operations are important for \nagricultural  production  and  averting  potential  disaster  during  flood. Although  groundwater  has \nhelped against  waterlogging  and drought  and  has  augmented  unreliable canal  water  supplies, \nits  overextraction  in  some  areas  has  caused  saltwater  intrusion  and  land  degradation  and \nincreased  pumping  and  production  costs.  The  Punjab  Irrigation  Department  (PID)  is  working \nwith ADB, the World Bank, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to improve \nirrigated agriculture and related infrastructure.10 \n \nThree tranches of ADB\u2019s $700 million multitranche financing facility (MFF) (2007\u20132017) \n6. \nfor  the  Punjab  Irrigated  Agriculture  Investment  Program  have  been  supporting  the  upgrade  of \nirrigation  infrastructure  serving  3  million  ha,  on-farm  agriculture,  and  institutional  reforms.11 All \nthe  three  tranches  of  the  MFF  have  been  approved  and  their  implementation  is  on  track. \nFollowing  the  approval  of  $73  million  for  tranche  3  on  13  December  2012,  the  balance  MFF \namount of $129 million (equivalent) is not sufficient to finance the project. The proposed loan of \n$150 million was included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Pakistan, 2014\u20132016 \nas a firm loan for processing in 2014.12 The MFF will be closed by 30 September 2017. \n \n7. \nThe  project  is  proposed  as  a  stand-alone  project  loan  as  (i)  required  funding  is  not \navailable  under  the  MFF,  (ii)  the  project  scope  is  limited  to  two  barrages  on  the  same  river \nfacing similar problems, (iii) the project area is well defined, and (iv) the project implementation \nperiod will be relatively short (4\u20135 years). Detailed engineering design and approved PC-1 are \navailable.13 The project concept was discussed with the World Bank, the International Fund for \nAgricultural  Development,  and  JICA.  In  March  2012,  Punjab  initiated  the  $423.5  million  ($250 \nmillion  loan)  Punjab  Irrigated  Agriculture  Productivity  Improvement  Program  for  on-farm  water \nand agriculture management.14 The program (March 2012\u2013December 2018) covers the Trimmu \nand Panjnad barrages command areas and complements the project. \n\n                                                \n8  Ministry  of  Climate  Change.  2012.

The outcome will be that the Trimmu and Panjnad barrages will be safe and will \ndeliver reliable irrigation water supplies to their canals. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  project  outputs  will  be  (i)  rehabilitated  and  upgraded  Trimmu  barrage,  (ii) \n9. \nrehabilitated  and  upgraded  Panjnad  barrage,  and  (iii)  improved  capacities  of  the  communities \nand  PID.  The  outputs  will  be  achieved  by  (i)  increasing  the  flood  capacities  of  the  Trimmu \nbarrage from 12,743 m3/s  in 2014 to 24,777 m3/s (94% increase), and of the Panjnad barrage \nfrom  19,822  m3/s  in  1932  to  24,495  m3/s  (25%  increase);  (ii)  improving  the  stability  of  the \nexisting structures against floods, climate variability, erosion, and sedimentation; (iii) training the \ncommunities  and  PID  staff  in  flood  risk  management  and  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement;  and  (iv)  providing  social  facilities  such  as  a  public  park  and  an  upgraded  basic \nhealth  unit  and  a  girls\u2019  school.

The PID\u2019s \n\n                                                \n16 A maturity premium on repayment is not applied on the 20-year term and 5-year grace period following straight line \n\nrepayment procedure because the average loan maturity period remains less than 13 years. \n\n17 The  cost  of  (i)  works  includes  environment  and  climate  change;  (ii)  social  development  includes  family  parks, \nschool and basic health unit; (iii) project management includes consulting services and PMO\u2019s operating cost; and \n(iv)  capacity  building  covers  training  of  communities/women  and  Punjab  Irrigation  Department  staff,  and \nstrengthening the Strategic Policy Review Unit and the Punjab Engineering Academy.  \n\n18 The  PID  has  completed  three  World  Bank-financed  projects\u2014the  Taunsa  barrage  rehabilitation  project  ($123 \nmillion);  irrigation  system  rehabilitation  project  ($200  million);  and  a  development  policy  loan  supporting  public \nfinance reforms, strengthening devolution and service delivery, and improving  the fiduciary system ($100 million). \nThe  PID  is  currently  implementing  the  World  Bank-financed  Jinnah  barrage  ($145  million),  JICA-financed  Lower \nChenab  Canal  Improvement  Project  ($100  million),  ADB-financed  Lower  Bari  Doab  Improvement  Project  ($228 \nmillion),  New  Khanki  Barrage  Project  ($270  million  equivalent),  and  Pakpattan  Canal  Suleimanki  Barrage \nImprovement Project ($73 million). \n\n\fexisting  project  management  office  (PMO)  for  barrages  will  be  responsible  for  project \nimplementation. The PMO has established engineering, safeguards, procurement, and finance \nunits  and  has  experience  implementing  four  similar  projects.19 Provision  has  been  made  for \nadditional staff, a construction supervision consultant in the role of  engineer as defined by the \nInternational  Federation  of  Consulting  Engineers  (FIDIC),  and  a  management  support \nconsultant. A functional project steering committee and ADB\u2019s sound experience of working with \nthe PID will further ensure timely implementation. \n \nLessons  from  ongoing  projects  helped  in  packaging  two  main  international  competitive \n16. \nbidding  works  contracts,  advancing  detailed  design  and  bidding  process,  and  conducting \nmeaningful  consultation  with  potentially  affected  people.  An  experienced \ninternational \nresettlement  expert  conducted  field  verification  and  reviewed  the  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  plan  (LARP).  The  bidders  evaluation  and  qualification  criteria  will  be  reviewed,  a \nsite visit of the potential bidders will be arranged, and at least 90 days will be provided for bid \nsubmission.  \n  \n17. \nthe PAM (footnote 11). \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nMarch 2015\u2013September 2020  \n30 September 2020 (loan closing date: 31 March 2021) \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nProject steering committee \nChair: Punjab Planning and Development Board \nMembers: Member Infrastructure, Punjab Planning and Development \nBoard and secretaries of departments of irrigation, agriculture, \nenvironment, and finance \nGovernment of Punjab, through the Punjab Irrigation Department \nPunjab Irrigation Department \nProject management office (barrages), Canal Bank, Mustafa Abad, Lahore \nwith 18 existing key staff and 7 proposed additional staff \nInternational \ncompetitive bidding \nShopping \nSupervision \nconsultants (quality- \nand cost-based \nselection 90:10) \n\n$480,000 \n$9.0 million \n\n$128.4 million \n\n2 contracts \n\n6 contracts \n32 person-months of \ninternational and 1,213 \nperson-months of \nnational consultants\u2019 \ninputs  \n8 person-months of \nnational individual \nconsultant input \n\n$0.08 million \n\nExternal monitoring \nconsultant - social \nsafeguards (individual)  \nRecruitment of consultants and procurement of works contracts will be \ninitiated under advance contracting but retroactive financing is not \nconsidered.  \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \n\nRetroactive financing and/or advance \ncontracting \n\nDisbursementa  \n\nSource: Government of Punjab and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n                                                \n19 The World Bank-financed Taunsa and Jinnah barrages and ADB-financed Khanki and Suleimanki barrage projects. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n18. \nThe project is located on a transboundary river. The Indus Waters Treaty, 1960 allocates \nall waters from the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers to Pakistan. Therefore, no transboundary \nimpact  on  the  project  is  foreseen.  The  project\u2019s  technical  viability  and  sustainability  has  been \nassessed as part of a due diligence exercise. The assessment indicates that (i) both barrages \nare  running  at  a  high  risk  of  failure,  (ii)  their  failure  would  affect  1.74  million  ha  of  land  and \ndeprive 600,000 farming families of irrigation water for several crop seasons in seven districts, \n(iii)  the  recovery  cost  will  be  high  and  time  consuming,  and  (iv)  the  need  to  rehabilitate  and \nupgrade  these  barrages  is  justified.20 Further,  the  project  will  minimize  the  flood  risk  to  lives, \nproperties,  and livelihood. The  proposed interventions follow  accepted  international  standards, \nwill ensure structural safety, and are technically proven and justified. \n \n19. \nBarrage technology is well known in the region. The PID has 60 years of experience in \nthe  operational  management  of  13  barrages  serving  8.4  million  ha.  A  team  of  around  200 \nengineers,  technicians, and  support staff manages  the  operations  of the  Trimmu and Panjnad \nbarrages.  The  barrage  manual  provides  guidance  on  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M) \nprocedures and practices. Annual O&M reports are prepared and appropriate actions are taken \nfollowing  recommendations  by  the  experts.  The  project  will  review  the  barrage  manual  for \nimproved management practices, including provision of special inspections every  5 years. The \noperations management of the barrages is technically and institutionally sustainable. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n20. \nThe  main  benefit  will  be  sustained  production  as  a  result  of  improved  barrages,  as \nopposed  to  declining  production  and  falling  farm  income  resulting  from  either  catastrophic \nbarrage  failure  or  continually  decreasing  reliability  of  irrigation  deliveries  as  the  barrages  age \nfurther because of deferred rehabilitation. The other beneficiaries include residents (farming and \nnonfarming) in those areas subject to damage from either intentional or accidental breaching of \nthe  flood  bunds  upstream  of  the  barrages  as  increased  safe  flood  passage  capacities  of  the \nbarrages will significantly reduce the flood risk. \n \n21. \nEconomic viability. Economic analysis of the project yielded a mean economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) of 23.4% (standard deviation 11.3%). The EIRR ranged from 6% to 65%, \nwith a 15% probability that the EIRR would be less than the 12% threshold. Individual analysis \nyielded a mean EIRR of 24.3% on the Trimmu barrage investment, and 21.9% on the Panjnad \nbarrage  investment.  Consumers  of  agricultural  produce  are  a  significant  beneficiary  of  the \nproject, with 79% of the present value of benefits (PRs26,606 million), with producers assuming \nthe remaining benefits. The poor (PRs15,932 million) and extremely poor (PRs5,974 million) are \nprimary  beneficiaries  of  the  project  benefits  (83%  of  present  value  of  benefits).  Overall,  the \nproject will have a positive impact on improving the welfare of poor people in Pakistan. \n \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  government  of  Punjab  allocates  $1,057,790  annually  for \n22. \nO&M  of the Trimmu  barrage  and  $847,352 for  the  Panjnad  barrage.21 This  allocation  is  based \n\n                                                \n20 The Trimmu barrage supplies irrigation water to the Haveli main line canal (146.4 m3/s), Taunsa-Sindhnai link canal \n(354.0  m3/s),  and  Rangpur  canal  (76.74  m3/s).  The  Panjnad  barrage  supplies  irrigation  water  to  the  Panjnad \nAbbasia canal (220.0 m3/s), Abbasia canal (30.1 m3/s), and Abbasia link canal (158.6 m3/s). \n\n21 Actual  allocation  for  O&M  in  Pakistan  rupees  was  converted  to  US  dollar  equivalent  using  the  2  June  2014 \n\nexchange rate. \n\n \n\n\fon assessment conducted under the World Bank\u2019s development and policy loan in 2006, which \nwas updated twice (2010 and 2012). The next revision of the O&M funds is scheduled in 2015. \nThe government also provides additional funding for floods and emergency situations.  Further, \nunder the project, a periodic inspection by independent experts is proposed, including review of \nO&M cost and removal of sediments every 5 years. The government will allocate funds for the \nproposed inspection and removal of sediments, if needed. One such inspection will be arranged \nunder the project during construction. Independent auditors audit the annual budget. Therefore, \nthe operations management of the barrages is financially sustainable. \n \n\nTable 4: Allocations and Expenditures for Operation and Maintenance of the Barrages \n($) \n\n \nBarrage \n  FY2011 \n1,217,562 \nTrimmu barrage \nPanjnad barrage \n836,248 \nSource: Punjab Irrigation Department, Government of Punjab. \n\nAnnual Allocation \n1,057,790 \n847,352 \n\n \n\nActual Expenditures \n\n    FY2012 \n974,752 \n817,238 \n\n  FY2013 \n896,229 \n713,457 \n\n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n23. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  concludes  that  the  PMO  has  satisfactory \nfinancial  management  capability  to record financial  transactions and  balances,  provide  regular \nrecords  and  monitoring  reports,  and  safeguard  assets.  Financial  management  assessment \nidentifies two vacant staff positions and lack of internal audit arrangement under the PMO as the \nmain issues requiring attention. The related risks and mitigation measures have been included \nin the risk  assessment  and  management  plan.  The  PMO\u2019s  financial management  capacity  will \nbe strengthened by providing additional staff and PID support in internal audit.  \n \n24. \nProcurement  of  civil  works  and  goods  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  while  engagement  of \nconsultants  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from \ntime  to  time).  All  civil  works  contracts  valued  at  $10  million  and  above  will  be  procured  using \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Consulting  services  will  be  recruited  in  one  package  for \nconstruction supervision using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a 90:10 ratio, \nincluding  provision  for  management  support  consultants. 22 One  individual  consultant  will  be \nrecruited for external monitoring of the safeguards. Because of different equipment and vehicle \ntypes  and  varying  procurement  times,  these  items  will  be  procured  through  six  shopping \ncontracts.  All  procurement  and  consultant  recruitment  will  be  undertaken  by  the  procurement \nunit of the PMO in accordance with the project\u2019s procurement plan. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 11). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n25. \nApproximately, 85% of the rural households are below the poverty line of $2 per day per \nperson  as  adopted  by  ADB,  and  at  least  50%  of  the  project  benefits  will  reach  these  people. \nResidents  around  the  barrages  have  suffered  from  increasingly  frequent  floods,  specifically  in \n2010 and in 1992, and the project will minimize the risk of further such events and associated \nloss  of  life,  livestock,  structures,  crops,  and  livelihoods.  The  key  poverty  and  social  issues  for \nthese people include limited livelihood opportunities, low skill levels, poor educational provision, \n\n                                                \n22 This method is used because with unique structures in rivers, quality is more important. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nsubstandard health facilities, and lack of recreational options. The project will offer employment \nopportunities for unskilled and semiskilled workers. \n\n26. \nThe project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan has \nbeen  prepared,  and  key  related  actions  include  enhanced  livelihood  skills,  better  education, \nhealth  and  recreational  facilities,  and  reduced  travel  time  to  these  facilities. 23  Some  8,500 \nfamilies will benefit from the new health centers, post-primary school enrolment is expected to \ndouble, and 500 women will receive training in livelihood skills. These are significant advances \nin the context of southern Punjab, where indicators for health and education are particularly low. \n\n27. \nThere are some concerns about compliance with the core labor standards in Pakistan in \ncertain  industries  such  as  brick kilns. This  issue was specifically  raised  with the  Punjab  Labor \nDepartment and the local branch of the Pakistan Workers\u2019 Federation. They noted that this area \nfalls  within  their  remit  for  monitoring  and  compliance;  however,  they  do  not  expect  violations \nduring  barrage  rehabilitation.  An  effective  judicial  system,  proactive  civil  society,  and  vibrant \nmedia  provide  protection  against  forced  labor. 24 Nevertheless,  provisions  for  identifying  any \nissues  will  be  included  in  the  monitoring  responsibilities  of  the  supervision  consultant\u2019s \nsafeguards team. The Punjab Labor Department and the Pakistan Workers\u2019 Federation will be \nnotified of any noncompliance issues for their action. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \nEnvironmental safeguard. The two subprojects\u2014Trimmu and Panjnad barrages\u2014have \nbeen  categorized  B  for  environment.  Separate  initial  environmental  examinations  for  the  two \nsubprojects  were  prepared  and  disclosed  on  ADB  website  on  5  June  2014,  as  required  by \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The Panjnad barrage subproject involves limited civil \nworks in a contained area without impacting the biodiversity. The environmental impacts will be \nlimited  to  the  construction  phase  and  can  be  addressed  through  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental  management  plan.  The  Trimmu  barrage  subproject  involves  slightly  more \nextensive  civil  works,  which  will  encroach  into  the  wetlands  that  have  been  created  within  the \narea of the guide banks. The barrage area is not a declared protected area. However, based on \na preliminary biodiversity scan, some of the species have been identified as sensitive according \nto the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. Because \nof the contained civil works and limited scale of the project, direct impacts on biodiversity are not \nexpected and the mitigation measures designed for the activities will address all likely impacts. \nAs  sensitive  species  have  been  reported  in  the  area,  a  comprehensive  biodiversity  survey \nincluding  large  and  small  mammals,  birds, fish,  reptiles,  and  vegetation was conducted  by  the \nWWF-Pakistan \nthese  species.  The \nrecommendations  of  the  biodiversity  report  have  been  integrated  into  the  final  initial \nenvironmental  examination  for  the  Trimmu  barrage.  The  targeted  mitigation  measures  will  be \nincorporated  in  the  site-specific  environmental  management  plan,  ensuring  protection  of  the \nhabitat  of  these  species  during  and  after  construction.  This  is  an  environmental  enhancement \nfeature. \n \nSocial  safeguard.  The  project  is  categorized  A  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  C  for \n29. \nindigenous  peoples  safeguards. There  are  no  indigenous  peoples,  as  defined  for  operational \n                                                \n23 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Pakistan\u2019s  Constitution  regarding  labor  prohibits  all  forms  of  slavery,  forced  labor,  and  child  labor  (Article  11). \nDespite  the  constitutional protection,  the  International  Labour  Organization publications  reflected  bonded labor  in \ncottage industries in Pakistan. \nhttp://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&context=forcedlabor \n\nthe  distribution  and  prevalence  of \n\nto  assess \n\n\fpurposes  by  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement (2009),  in the  project  area.  No  private  land  is \nbeing  impacted  by  the  project,  although  86  households  comprising  548  persons  squatting  on \nstate barrage land will be either physically or significantly economically displaced. Social impact \nassessments  including  detailed  measurement  surveys  were  conducted  in  consultation  with \naffected  people  and  an  entitlement  matrix  and  a  resettlement  plan  were  prepared  by  the \nexecuting  agency.  Compensation  for  nonland  assets  is  based  on  replacement  cost  principles, \nand  relocation  and  income  restoration  measures  adequately  enable  security  of  tenure  for \ndwellings  and  impacted  business.  The  executing  agency\u2019s  environment  and  social  safeguards \nunit  exhibits  a  good  level  of  proficiency  in  understanding  the  laws,  rules,  and  procedures  for \nland acquisition and resettlement-related tasks and ADB\u2019s social safeguards requirements. The \nexecuting agency has demonstrated institutional capacity to implement the land acquisition and \nresettlement  plans  through  ongoing  consecutive  tranches  of  the  MFF.  The  draft  LARP,  which \nwas  approved  by  the  executing  agency,  was  disclosed  in  the  project  area  and  on  the  ADB \nwebsite  on  4  June  2014.  The  executing  agency  will  prepare  monitoring  reports  of  LARP \nimplementation  and  will  retain  a  qualified  and  experienced  external  expert  to  verify  the \nborrower\u2019s monitoring information. The verification reports will be disclosed on the internet. \n \n30. \nClimate  change. Future climate trends in Pakistan show an increase in temperature in \nthe  range  of  1.3\u00b0  C\u20131.5\u00b0C  by  the  2020s,  2.5\u00b0C\u20132.8\u00b0C  by  the  2050s,  and  3.9\u00b0C\u20134.4\u00b0C  by  the \n2080s; this is similar to the 2.8\u00b0C\u20133.4\u00b0C increase in the average global surface temperature by \n2100.  Projections  on  annual  precipitation  show  a  slight  increase  in  summer  and  decrease  in \nwinter  but  no  significant  changes  in  annual  precipitation.  Monsoon  rain  variability  will  increase \nand enhance the frequency and severity of extreme events such as floods and droughts.25 The \ncontributing  flows  to  the  Indus  River  system  (Indus  River  44%,  Chenab  River  19%,  Jhelum \nRiver  16%,  Kabul  River  16%,  and  other  small  streams  5%)  will  be  affected  as  the  water \nresources  in  the  system  come  from  rainfall  and  snow  and  glacial  melt  from  the  Hindukush, \nKarakoram, and Himalaya mountain ranges. \n \nThe project will strengthen the existing structures against climate variability, erosion, and \n31. \nsedimentation  and will  increase their flood passage capacity  significantly.  The  project  will  also \nbuild  capacity  of  communities  in  flood  risk  management,  making  both  the  structures  and  the \ncommunities  resilient  to  extreme  events  such  as  flood.  The  upstream  structures  reasonably \nbuffer the two barrages against high water and sediment flows. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe  CAPE  2002\u20132012  identified  (i)  weak  institutional  capacity,  (ii)  lack  of  government \n32. \nsupport, (iii) complex and inappropriate project designs, (iv) insufficient project supervision, and \n(v)  complex  or  unclear  institutional  arrangements  as  the  most  pervasive  factors  (footnote  6). \nMajor  risks  and mitigating measures  are  summarized  in Table  5  and  described in  detail  in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.26  \n \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nExtreme events and flow variability: \n(i)  climate-induced frequent floods and \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe mitigation measures include \n(i)  the project design, which includes enhancing flood passage capacity \n\nreduction in river flows, and \nintersector competition for water \n\n(ii) \n\nof the two barrages and allocates funds; and \n\n(ii)  provision of water from the Jhelum and Indus rivers through the inter-\n\n                                                \n25 Planning Commission. 2010.
