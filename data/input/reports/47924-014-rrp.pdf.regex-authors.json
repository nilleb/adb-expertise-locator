I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $80,000,000 (or in Indian rupee equivalent) to BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL) \nfor the Delhi Electricity Distribution System Improvement Project in India. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  The  electricity  distribution  sector  in  India  has  been  characterized  by  chronic \nunderinvestment, inadequate cost recovery, and inefficient operations\u2014resulting in very high \ntechnical and commercial losses. Aggregate technical and commercial (ATC) losses at an all-\nIndia level were 26.15% in FY2011,1 with some state distribution companies having ATC losses \nas high as 67.74%.2 Financially and operationally viable distribution entities are the foundation \nof  sustainable  power sector  reform.  Efficiency  improvements  in  distribution  will  reduce  the \nelectricity demand\u2013supply gap in India and reduce the investment required in the upstream \nsector of electricity generation. In spite of the strong development rationale for intervention in \nthe distribution sector, the participation of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in this sector in \nIndia has been limited. In 2002, Delhi was one of the first states to initiate the reform of its \nelectricity distribution business by privatizing its three distribution companies. BRPL is one of \nthe three privatized distribution companies in Delhi and is responsible for providing electricity to \nsouth and west Delhi. BRPL is the largest of the three distribution companies in Delhi in terms of \ncustomers served and units of electricity supplied.  \n \n3.  From initial discussions with BRPL, ADB gathered information on the key operational \nachievements of the company since 2002\u2014including a reduction in ATC losses from 48.1% in \nFY2002 to 17.3%3 in FY2013, and achieving a bill collection rate of 99.5%. While challenges \npersist regarding the recovery of historical receivables, the recent record of the independent \nregulator Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) in approving the required step-up in \ntariffs  suggests  political  will  to  ensure  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  private  distribution \ncompanies.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  help  the  company  implement  the  next  round  of  system \nimprovement measures to reduce ATC losses by 3.5%, in line with the targets stipulated by \nDERC. Lessons from this financing will also help ADB structure funding instruments for other \ndistribution companies in India and support the country\u2019s power sector reform programs. \n \n2.  Project Design  \n4.  BRPL\u2019s  capital  expenditure  plan  for  FY2014\u2013FY2015  will  improve,  expand,  and \nmodernize the company\u2019s distribution network with the aim of increasing reliable electricity \nsupply to residential and commercial consumers in its service area. \n \n5.  BRPL\u2019s system improvement plan targets a 3.5% reduction in ATC losses by FY2016. \nThis will include a 2.3% reduction in technical losses and a 1.2% reduction in commercial \nlosses. To reduce technical losses, the plan includes subprojects targeting rehabilitation of \nsubstations, augmentation or replacement of transformers, laying of extra high voltage cables, \n                                                 \n1 Government of India, Central Electricity Agency. 2013.

Commercial losses are expected to be \ncurtailed through an expanded public awareness campaign complemented by strict vigilance \nand enforcement.  \n \n3.  The Borrower and Sponsors \n6.  BRPL is owned 51% by the Reliance ADA Group and 49% by Delhi Power Company \nLimited (DPCL). The majority of the shareholding of the Reliance ADA Group in BRPL is held by \nReliance  Infrastructure  Limited,4 one  of  India\u2019s  largest  infrastructure  companies  with  total \nrevenues of Rs143.2 billion ($2.4 billion) for FY2013 and a market capitalization of Rs108 billion \n($1.7 billion) as of 15 October 2013. DPCL is 100% owned by the Government of Delhi. DPCL \nwas formed in 2002, when the Delhi power sector was restructured, with a view to holding the \ngovernment\u2019s shareholding in generation, transmission, and distribution companies in Delhi and \nto settle the liabilities of the former state electricity board. DPCL has a shareholding of 21.96% \nin Indraprastha Power Generation Company Limited, 6.58% in Delhi Transco Limited, and \n49.00% in each of three privatized electricity distribution companies in Delhi\u2014BRPL, BSES \nYamuna Power Limited, and North Delhi Power Limited. DPCL is not involved in the day-to-day \noperations of BRPL.  \n \n7.  BRPL distributes power to 1.82 million customers spread over 750 square kilometers in \nsouth and west Delhi. BRPL has a diversified customer base. As of March 2013, domestic \ncustomers  (households)  accounted  for  54%  of  the  electricity  consumption,  commercial \ncustomers  (schools,  hospitals,  petrol  pumps,  etc.)  accounted  for  30%  of  the  electricity \nconsumption, and industrial customers\u2014including the airport and the metro\u2014 accounted for \n16% of the electricity consumption. Peak demand for BRPL in FY2013 was 2,338 megawatts \n(MW). Total input energy was 11,226 gigawatt-hours (GWh). The total energy billed was 9,328 \nGWh  with  a  99.5%  bill  collection rate,  resulting  in  ATC  losses of  17.3%  in  FY2013.  It  is \nestimated that the ATC losses comprise technical losses of 13.3% and commercial losses and \npower theft of 4.0%.5 BRPL provides 24x7 electricity supply to its consumers, with an average \npower outage in its area of service of less than 3 minutes per day in 2013. \n \n8.  Confidential information deleted. \n \n9.  Regulatory assets. The electricity distribution business in Delhi is regulated by DERC \non  a  cost-plus  basis.  DERC  determines  the  retail  tariffs  to  ensure  recovery  of  BRPL\u2019s \nuncontrollable costs, reasonable controllable costs, and the eligible return on investment. The \nrapid increase in prices of coal and other fossil fuels caused the power purchase cost of BRPL \nto increase by 92% during FY2008\u2013FY2013. To smooth the increase in retail tariffs to the \nconsumer, DERC decided to spread out the recovery of these costs over subsequent years, \nresulting in a revenue gap. DERC recognized this income receivable as a regulatory asset. On \n31 March 2013, BRPL\u2019s regulatory assets were estimated at Rs66 billion. To prevent a future \nbuildup of regulatory assets, DERC approved and notified a power purchase adjustment cost \n(PPAC) mechanism in July 2012 that provides for a quarterly revision in retail tariffs to reflect \nchanges in power purchase cost. The PPAC surcharge for BRPL was 3.0% in the third quarter \n(Q3) of FY2013 and 4.5% in Q4 FY2013. In addition to the PPAC, in July 2012 DERC approved \nand notified an 8% surcharge on retail tariffs toward the recovery of accumulated regulatory \nassets. Pursuant to these reforms, recent tariff notifications by DERC have reflected a more \ncomplete pass-through of costs to consumers. Tariffs have been increased by 45% during \n                                                 \n4 Confidential information deleted.  \n5 Provisional data. ", "  3\nFY2011\u2013FY2013. DERC, along with the Government of Delhi, is drafting a regulatory asset \nrecovery plan (RARP) that will provide for the amortization of historical regulatory assets over \nthe next 5 to 7 years.  \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n10.  The project is expected to improve the efficiency of the electricity distribution networks in \nthe country in order to provide reliable energy access to sustain the country\u2019s economic growth. \nImproved performance of an electricity distribution company under professional private sector \nownership will provide a showcase for further private sector investment in the sector.  \n \n2.  Outcome \n11.  The project will provide an expanded and increasingly efficient supply of electricity to \nresidents of south and west Delhi through adequate upgrading, repair, and maintenance of the \nexisting facilities as well as capacity expansion to accommodate growing demand. \n \n3.  Outputs \n12.   Successful implementation of the project will rehabilitate and/or augment approximately \n486 distribution transformers, 266 kilometers (km) of 11 kilovolt (kV) distribution lines, and 16 \nkm  of  extra  high  voltage  lines.  It  will  add  123  new  substations,  285  new  distribution \ntransformers, 221 km of new 11 kV distribution lines, and 21 km of new extra high voltage lines \nas well as additional equipment to improve the automated system for billing and settlements. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n13.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.6 Infrastructure development is one of \nthe five core areas under Strategy 2020. ADB is committed, among other things, to promote \nenergy  efficiency  through  supply-side  measures  under  Strategy  2020.  The  India  country \npartnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 underlines the need for ADB to focus on expanding availability \nand access to energy  by reducing losses and strengthening infrastructure.7 The project is \ntherefore fully aligned with the country partnership strategy. Moreover, the project supports the \nGovernment of India\u2019s policy reforms in the electricity distribution sector. \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n14.  The project is also in line with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which highlights energy efficiency \nimprovements in transmission and distribution systems.8 The policy proposes that ADB continue \nto support installation of modern transmission systems to transmit electricity efficiently from \ngeneration facilities to consumers, including upgrading of existing systems to reduce technical \nlosses. In addition, the energy policy encourages the facilitation of private sector investments to \nimprove energy efficiency.  \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2008.

Implementation Arrangements \n17.  Table 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework   \nDistribution license  The electricity distribution business in Delhi is regulated by DERC. As part of \nthe privatization process in 2002, BRPL signed a 25-year license agreement \nwith DERC for electricity distribution rights for south and west Delhi. \nThe  license  agreement  provides  BRPL  the  right  to  discontinue  supply  of \nelectricity to any consumer in response to nonpayment of the electricity bill and \nto pursue prosecution for theft of power or equipment. \n \nTariff structure  DERC  follows  a  multiyear  tariff  framework  in  determining  the  aggregate \nrevenue requirement for BRPL. Based on an approved capital expenditure \nplan, DERC determines the retail tariff on a cost-plus basis to ensure a return \non equity of 16% to BRPL. Annual review of the tariff provides adjustments for \nuncontrollable  parameters  such  as  changes  in  power  purchase  cost.  Any \ndeviation resulting from a change in controllable parameters, such as operation \nand maintenance expenses or failure to achieve ATC loss reduction targets, is \non account of BRPL. If actual revenue is less than the aggregate revenue \nrequirement, the difference is recognized as a regulatory asset by DERC and \nprovision for the recovery of such regulatory asset is provided in subsequent \ntariff revisions. \nDomestic, commercial, and industrial consumers are grouped into 12 different \ntariff  categories  based  on  the  connected  load.  For  each  category,  DERC \nspecifies the applicable tariff, which consists of a fixed charge plus a variable \nenergy charge. In addition, surcharges apply to peak hour consumption and \nrebates to off-peak consumption.   \n \nPerformance  DERC specifies, on an annual basis, performance standards for the quality \nstandards  and efficiency of power supply, reduction in ATC losses, collection efficiency, \noperation and maintenance costs, and other system parameters. \n \nManagement  BRPL\u2019s board of directors consists of eight members, nominated equally by \nReliance Infrastructure Limited and DPCL. The chairperson is nominated by \nReliance Infrastructure Limited. Lalit Jalan, chief executive officer of Reliance \nInfrastructure  Limited,  is  currently  the  chairman  of  BRPL.  The  BRPL \nmanagement team is led by its chief executive officer, Gopal Saxena, and \nconsists  of  experienced  and  technically  competent  professionals  from  the \nReliance ADA Group. \n \nImplementation period  FY2014\u2013FY2016. \n ", "  5\nAspects  Arrangements \nCapital expenditure  BRPL  has  an  ongoing  capital  expenditure  plan  to  achieve  performance \nplan  standards specified by DERC. Prior approval from DERC is needed for any \ncapital expenditure plan in excess of Rs2.5 million. \n \nPower purchase  BRPL purchases electricity from various generation companies (mostly from \nagreements  state-owned power generation companies) under long-term power purchase \nagreements. The power purchase price is determined by the governing central \nor state regulatory commission on a cost-plus basis.  \n \nOperation and  Operation and maintenance is done by BRPL\u2019s own staff. Expansions and \nmaintenance  repairs are partly outsourced to subcontractors.  \n \nPerformance monitoring  Key performance indicators are reported by BRPL and monitored by DERC. \n \nATC = aggregate technical and commercial, BRPL = BSES Rajdhani Power Limited, DERC = Delhi Electricity \nRegulatory Commission, DPCL = Delhi Power Company Limited. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \nF.  Projected Financial and Economic Performance       \n18.   The  base-case  financial  projections,  which  are  conservative  assumptions  of  annual \nelectricity distribution factors, show that the project will generate adequate cash flows to meet \noperational expenses and cover debt servicing.  \n \n19.   Confidential information deleted. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n20.  The proposed loan of up to $80 million (or in Indian rupee equivalent) to BRPL will be \nprovided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources.  \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n21.  The proposed transaction merits ADB\u2019s assistance for the following reasons: \n(i)  Improving the efficiency of the electricity distribution system is the most cost-\neffective  and  environmentally  sustainable  form  of  intervention  to  reduce  the \nelectricity  demand\u2013supply  gap  in  India.  The  proposed  $142  million  capital \nexpenditure will result in a 3.5% reduction in ATC losses, which will conserve 529 \nGWh of energy per annum by FY2016. This is equivalent to the annual energy \noutput of a 242 MW wind power plant, which would require an investment of \n$222 million; or a 302 MW solar photovoltaic power plant, which would require an \ninvestment of $385 million.9 By supporting the project, ADB will spotlight the \ncritical  importance  of  investments  aimed  at  improving  distribution  networks, \nwhich are more productive in reducing the demand\u2013supply gap in India than \ninvestments in greenfield clean energy generation facilities.  \n(ii)  The proposed ADB assistance will provide much needed funding to BRPL for \nsystem improvement. BRPL\u2019s existing, mainly public sector owned lenders have \n                                                 \n9  Using Central Electricity Regulatory Commission norms for the capital expenditure cost for wind (Rs57.5 million per \nMW) and solar photovoltaic (Rs80 million per MW) and a capacity factor of 25% for wind and 18% for solar \nphotovoltaic based on the performance of existing ADB Private Sector Operations Department projects in India. \n \n ", " 6         \nlimited appetite for further lending to the sector given their overall power sector \nexposure limits. ADB assistance will ensure that BRPL is able to continue its \nsystem improvement plans to reduce ATC losses. \n(iii)  The  borrower  will  establish  and  implement  a  new  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system (ESMS) to comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) requirements, thereby improving the company\u2019s environmental and social \npractices.  \n \nC.  Risks  \n22.  Regulatory  asset  recovery  plan.  DERC recently implemented the quarterly PPAC \nmechanism  and  an  8%  regulatory  asset  recovery  surcharge  which  helped  BRPL  achieve \nbreakeven in the quarter ending June 2013, after years of inadequate cost recovery. While this \nis a positive development, the approval of the RARP, which will ensure the recovery of historical \nregulatory assets, is still pending. The RARP is expected to be approved by January 2014.  \n \n23.  Regulatory risk. DERC has been in existence since 1999. In the past DERC had on \nfrequent occasions delayed providing tariff adjustments for increases in power purchase costs \nresulting in increases to BRPL\u2019s financial deficit and the creation of large regulatory assets. \nHowever, DERC has now recognized the importance of timely tariff adjustments to ensure \ncomplete cost recovery and has been issuing regular tariff orders including the recent July 2013 \ntariff order approving a 5% increase in tariffs. Long term viability of BRPL heavily depends on \ncontinued adequacy of tariffs to recover costs. In addition to notifying tariff orders, DERC also \nsets the standard for quality, efficiency and reliability of the distribution network and approves all \ncapital expenditure programs. If the regulator reinterprets existing regulations or creates new \nones in the future, this could increase costs or reduce revenues. This risk is mitigated by the \nimportance of the privatization of the electricity distribution business in Delhi as a showcase for \nthe central government as it continues energy sector reforms across the country. \n \n24.  Confidential information deleted. \n \n25.  Power purchase cost. The price of electricity purchased by BRPL under its long-term \npower purchase agreements is not fixed; it is regulated by the concerned state or central \nelectricity regulatory commission. In the past, an increase in power purchase cost would not \nautomatically result in an increase in tariff. DERC evaluated the merits of each case and the \ntariff increase was effected in the next tariff revisions. This delay and timing mismatch between \nthe increase in power purchase cost and the increase in tariffs resulted in increased short-term \nborrowings for BRPL. Recent initiatives such as the PPAC mechanism provide for a quarterly \nrevision in tariffs to reflect changes in power purchase costs. \n \n26.  Confidential information deleted.  \n \n27.  Execution and maintenance risk. The feasibility of BRPL\u2019s investment plan has been \nassessed by ADB\u2019s external technical advisor. BRPL faces completion and execution risks but it \nis considered to have sufficient experience and technical capacity to undertake the investment \nplan. The technical advisor has confirmed that the proposed investment plan and BRPL\u2019s \nmaintenance strategy are appropriate. The costs of the proposed investment are in line with \nmarket benchmarks.  \n \n28.  Demand  risk.  BRPL  expects  demand  to  grow  by  5%  per  annum  during  the  next \n10 years. A reduction in demand could result in increased short-term sale of the excess power ", "  7\nprocured by BRPL under its long-term power purchase agreements. The multiyear tariff 2012 \nregulations, along with the PPAC mechanism, allow for an adjustment in the tariff on account on \nany short-term sale of excess power. However, this adjustment is only quarterly, resulting in a \nshort lag in recovery in case of a loss from the short-term sale. Nevertheless, demand risk is \nexpected to be low. Rapid urbanization and development of transportation infrastructure are \nexpected to be the key drivers of demand growth. \n \n29.  Confidential information deleted.  \n \n30.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, the potential environmental and \nsocial impacts of the project have been identified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, \nmitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts will be incorporated in the safeguard reports \nand plans. The project is classified as category B for environment as its potential adverse \nenvironmental impacts are site-specific, reversible, and mostly associated with construction \nactivities. A corporate audit on current operations by BRPL and implementation of BRPL\u2019s \nproposed investment has been conducted. The current environmental assessment practices are \nbased on national requirements. Based on the findings of the audit, BRPL will establish and \nimplement a new ESMS to comply with the Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. The new \nESMS  will  include  (i)  BRPL\u2019s  environmental  and  social  policies,  (ii)  a  screening  and \ncategorization  procedure  for  its  activities,  (iii)  an  environmental  and  social  impacts  review \nprocedure,  (iv) institutional  arrangements  for  environmental  and  social  assessment, \n(v) organizational  structure  and  staffing  for  the  environmental  and  social  safeguards,  and \n(vi) reporting  and  monitoring.  BRPL  commits  to  establish  its  ESMS  prior  to  the  first \ndisbursement of the proposed loan. Initial environmental examinations for the subprojects will \nbe prepared in line with the ESMS and reviewed by ADB prior to the first disbursement. \n \n32.  The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement and category C for \nindigenous  peoples.  The  proposed  subprojects  are  not  expected  to  entail  involuntary \nresettlement as the lands for substations and transformers are usually provided to BRPL on a \nlong-term lease basis by the government agencies. The laying of cables is not expected to \nresult in land acquisition or resettlement impacts as these are within the available right-of-way of \nthe  roads  or  lands  belonging  to  other  government  departments.  The  audit  confirmed  that \nBRPL\u2019s projects in the past have not involved any land acquisition. In the unlikely event of land \nacquisition and involuntary resettlement, the required procedures for screening and preparation \nof resettlement plans (in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement) will apply.
