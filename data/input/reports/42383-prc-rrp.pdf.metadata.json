An  environmental  impact  assessment  was  undertaken.  The \nsummary  environmental  impact  assessment  was  circulated  to  the  Board  of \nDirectors  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  uploaded  on  the  ADB \nwebsite on 20 October 2008. \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  help  promote  balanced  and  environmentally  sustainable \nurbanization;  narrow \nimprove  production, \nthe  urban\u2013rural  gap;  and \nemployment,  and  living  conditions  in  small  cities  and  towns  in  Shanxi \nProvince.  It  includes  about  seven  subproject  small  cities  and  towns.  The \nProject  is  being  processed  as  a  sector  loan  to  allow  the  Shanxi  provincial \ngovernment  (SPG)  to  respond  to  rapidly  changing  needs  of  cities  and  towns \nacross the province. Detailed assessment and analyses were undertaken for \nthe three core subprojects\u2014Pingyao county, Wutong town, and Youyu county. \nSubsequent  subprojects  will  be  selected,  prepared,  and  appraised  during \nproject implementation following an agreed set of criteria and procedures. The \nPingyao  subproject  includes  the  Huiji  River  improvement  component,  which \nwill improve environmental quality, thereby supporting tourism development in \nthe historic city center. The Wutong subproject has five components: (i) Caoxi \nroad and associated services, (ii) heat supply, (iii) gas supply, (iv) wastewater \ntreatment,  and  (v)  education  facilities.  The  subproject  will  provide  basic \ninfrastructure  to  improve  environmental  conditions  and  support  expansion  of \nthe  city  to  the  northwest,  where  air  pollution  is  lower.  The  Youyu  subproject \nhas  five  components:  (i)  heat  supply,  (ii)  water  supply,  (iii)  drainage  and \nwastewater  collection,  (iv)  roads  and  associated  services,  and  (v)  river \nimprovement.  In  addition  to  providing  citywide  environmental  improvements, \nthis subproject will provide basic infrastructure to support the development of \nan  urban  expansion  area  to  house  workers  migrating  to  the  county  seat  to \nwork in agroprocessing and other light industrial jobs.  \n \nThe PRC Government is committed to developing small cities and towns as a \nway  to  generate  jobs,  narrow  the  rural\u2013urban  income  gap,  and  increase \nnational  economic  productivity.  Growth  of  small  cities  and  towns  creates \neconomic  opportunities  for  farmers  to  move  to  urban  areas  and  gain  higher \nvalue-added  employment;  this  is  the  key  to  realizing  the  PRC\u2019s  vision  of  a \n\u201charmonious  society,\u201d  in  which  the  benefits  of  growth  will  be  shared  more \nequitably. The PRC\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan 2006\u20132010 identifies small city and \n\n\fii \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nProject \nInvestment Plan  \n\ntown  development  as  a  means  to  provide  a  higher  standard  of  living  to  rural \nmigrants  without  exacerbating  infrastructure  fatigue  and  other  problems \nafflicting  large  cities.  Building  on  the  conclusions  of  the  2004  ADB-financed \nTown-Based  Urbanization  Strategy  Study,  the  national  town  development \npolicy calls for strengthening physical and economic linkages between major \ncities  in  metropolitan  areas  or  development  corridors  and  the  smaller \nsettlements at their periphery. \n \nLocated  in  northern  PRC,  Shanxi  Province  is  a  national  base  for  coal,  coke, \nand  manufacturing  of  industrial  equipment  and  machinery.  Small  cities  and \ntowns  in  the  province  have  made  substantial  progress  in  recent  years  in \nfacilitating  economic  growth  through  resource  extraction,  manufacturing,  and \ninfrastructure \nservice  sector  development.  But  growth  has  outstripped \nprovision  and  urban  management  capacity,  resulting  in  degradation  of  the \nnatural  environment  and  living  conditions  of  local  residents.  Coverage  rates \nfor  urban  environmental  services  are  inadequate,  and  many  areas  of  the \nprovince  suffer  from  high  rates  of  air,  water,  and  land  pollution.  Local \ngovernments  lack  capital  and  expertise  to  provide  infrastructure  in  a  timely \nfashion,  which  would  mitigate  the  negative  environmental  impacts  of  their \neconomic success. Many small cities and towns outside of the coal- and coke-\nproducing regions suffer from low investment, low economic growth rates, and \nunderemployment.  The  SPG  policy  on  development  of  its  small  cities  and \ntowns  mirrors  the  national  policy,  which  promotes  small  cities  and  towns  as \ngrowth  engines  for  surrounding  rural  areas,  which  can  absorb  rural  migrants \nand relieve population pressure on the province\u2019s large cities.   \n \nThe  Project  will \nthe  economic,  social,  and  environmental \nsustainability  of  small  city  and  town  development  by  improving  urban \ninfrastructure  and  municipal  services.  The  improvements  will  serve  to \n(i) attract economic investment, especially in employment-intensive industries \nand  services,  by  providing  reliable,  high-quality  infrastructure  such  as  roads, \nwater supply, and sewerage; (ii) provide better living conditions and a decent \nurban  environment  to  town  residents  by  substituting  centralized  heating  for \nhousehold  coal  burning,  treating  wastewater  before  discharging  it  into  the \nnatural  environment,  and  introducing  sanitary  practices  in  solid  waste \ncollection and treatment; and (iii) extend the benefits of growth to all residents \nby  improving  coverage  and  service  quality  of  basic  municipal  services  to \nhouseholds  across  the  socioeconomic  spectrum.  ADB\u2019s  experience  and \nknowledge  in  urban  environmental  improvement  and  management,  including \nsupporting  utility  tariff  reforms,  will  add  value  to  the  Project,  especially  for \nsmall  cities  and  towns  that  are  undergoing  urbanization  and  economic \ntransformation. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  improved  environmental  quality  and  increased \nemployment  generation  in  small  cities  and  towns  in  Shanxi  Province.  The \noutcome  of  the  Project  is  improved  urban  infrastructure  and  municipal \nservices in about seven small cities and towns in the province. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $224.7  million,  including \ntaxes and duties of $6.4 million. \n \n\nincrease \n\n\f \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\nSource \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nAllocation and \nRelending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated \nProject \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting \nAgency \n\n \n\niii \n\nAmount \n($ million equivalent) \n\n100.0 \n0.3 \n\nShare \nof Total \n(%) \n45.0 \n0.0 \n\nAsian Development Bank loan \nMulti-Donor Trust Fund under the Water \n\nFinancing Partnership Facilitya \n\nPingyao County Government (Pingyao subproject)\nXiaoyi City Government (Xiaoyi subproject) \nYouyu County Government (Youyu subproject) \nOther City and County Governments (subsequent \nsubprojects) \n \na  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, and Norway.

The loan will have a 26-year term including a grace period of 6 years, \nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and \nconditions as set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n \nThe  PRC  Government  will  make  the  loan  proceeds  available  to  SPG,  the \nExecuting Agency, on the same terms and conditions of the ADB loan. SPG \nwill make the loan proceeds available to subproject municipal and/or country \ngovernments on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. The \nsubproject  municipal  and  county  governments  will  make  the  loan  proceeds \navailable to the implementing agencies on the same terms and conditions as \nthose of the loan with the end-borrowers assuming the foreign exchange and \ninterest rate variation risks of the ADB loan. \n \nUntil 30 June 2016 \n\n \n31 December 2015 \n\n \nSPG  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project.  A  project  leading  group \n(PLG), chaired by a vice-governor and comprising senior government officials \nof  concerned  bureaus  and  commissions,  was  established  to  provide  overall \nguidance  and  support  for  preparing  and  implementing  the  Project.  A  project \nmanagement  office  (PMO),  located  in  the  Shanxi  Housing  and  Urban-Rural \nDevelopment  Bureau,  was  established  under  the  PLG  to  undertake  and \nmanage day-to-day project activities. In each subproject city and town, a PLG \nand PMO will be set up to liaise with the provincial PMO, and to oversee and \nmanage work undertaken by the implementing agencies.  \n \nShanxi provincial government \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting \nServices \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nGoods,  works,  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  International \ncompetitive bidding, national competitive bidding, or shopping procedures will \nbe  used  for  procurement,  based  on  the  circumstances  of  each  contract \npackage. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  funding  for  international  and  national  consulting \nservices  to  support  the  PMOs  and  implementing  agencies  in  project \nimplementation  and  management,  and \ninstitutional  capacity  building. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nShanxi  Province  has  relatively  high  rural  poverty,  compared  with  the  PRC \naverage. More than 50 of its 119 counties and county-level cities are classified \nnationally or provincially as poor counties. The percentage of the population in \nabsolute  poverty  is  3.9%,  compared  with  the  national  average  of  2.5%.  The \nProject will reduce poverty by stimulating economic development, directly and \nindirectly  creating  jobs,  and  providing  improved  infrastructure  and  services  in \nsmall  cities  and  towns.  The  Project  will  provide  about  250,000  direct \nbeneficiaries  in  the  core  subproject  cities  and  towns  with  access  to  improved \nurban  services  and  public  facilities.  Another  380,000  people  in  surrounding \nrural  areas  of  the  core  subproject  cities  and  towns  will  benefit  from  local \neconomic  development  and  increased  employment  opportunities.  About  13% \nof the beneficiaries are poor. \n\nThe infrastructure improvements financed under the Project are anticipated to \nproduce substantial environmental and economic benefits. Roads will improve \ntransport  networks  and  connectivity,  thereby  reducing  travel  time  per  trip, \nlowering  vehicle  emissions,  and  helping  to  improve  air  quality.  Water  supply \nand wastewater treatment will improve public health and reduce the discharge \nof pollutants to rivers and groundwater. The Project will contribute to reductions \nin medical costs resulting from lower incidence of waterborne diseases in three \ncore  subproject  cities  and  towns.  River  improvement  will  provide  flood \nprotection,  thereby  reducing  economic  loss  and  public  health  hazard  due  to \nflooding.  District  heating  and  gas  supply  will  improve  efficiency,  eliminate  a \nconsiderable number of small and inefficient boilers, reduce the quantity of coal \nused,  and  replace  coal-burning  stoves  in  individual  dwelling  units,  thus \nreducing  the  emission  of  greenhouse  gases.  This  Project  will  have  positive \neffects on climate change, supporting PRC and ADB initiatives. \n\nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  climate  change  adaptation  through  measures  to \nimprove  flood  control  and  strengthen  water  resources  management  in  the \nsubproject cities and towns that are prone to increasing floods and droughts. \n \nThe  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks.  Conventional \nengineering  designs  with  proven  records  of  reliable  performance  will  be \nadopted  for  road  construction,  installation  of  municipal  services  along  roads, \nwater  supply,  wastewater  management,  solid  waste  management,  heating, \nand  landscaping.  Mitigating  measures  will  be  put  in  place  during  detailed \ndesign to address any risks associated with river improvement works such as \ndams and tidal floodgates. During implementation, the project implementation \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nv \n\nto \n\n(i) \n\nfailure \n\nimplement \n\nconsultant  will  support  the  PMOs  and  implementing  agencies  to  ensure  that \nequipment  and  works  comply  with  the  design  requirements  and  quality \nassurances. \n \nThe following risks could affect timely implementation, economic viability, and \nrealization  of  project  benefits: \ninstitutional \nstrengthening  for  effective  project  implementation  and  management,  and \ncorporate governance; (ii) lack of proper operation and maintenance of project \nfacilities;  (iii)  major  amendments  and  changes  in  implementation  of  master \nplans  in  the  subproject  cities  and  towns;  (iv)  delay  in  the  provision  of \ncounterpart funding; (v) failure to establish or increase water and wastewater \ntariffs to meet cost-recovery targets; and (vi) unforeseen land acquisition and \nresettlement  issues,  which  could  constrain  the  efficient  implementation  of \nproject works and restoration of livelihoods of affected people. \n \nRisks  (i)  and  (ii)  will  be  mitigated  through  provision  of  institutional  capacity \nbuilding  for  the  subproject  city  and  town  PMOs  and  implementing  agencies, \nwith  support  of  the  loan  implementation  consultant.  In  addition,  the  PLG  will \nprovide  oversight  to  mitigate  project  management  risk.  Risk  (iii)  will  be \nmitigated  by  aligning  the  project  design  and  implementation  schedules  with \nother planned projects. Risks (iv) and (v) will be mitigated through covenanted \nassurances from the subproject city and town governments on the provision of \ncounterpart funding  and  on  regular tariff  reviews  and increases.  Risk  (vi)  will \nbe  mitigated  by  strengthening  the  internal  monitoring  and  supervision  by \nShanxi  Province  and  subproject  city  and  town  PMOs  and  implementing \nagencies,  and  by  engaging  a  qualified  external  agency  to  monitor  and \nevaluate resettlement.  \n\n \n\n\f0\n\n100\n\nKelan\n\nYuanping\n\no\n114  00'E\n\no\n122  00'E\n\nSiping\n\nI N N E R     M O N G O L I A\n\n114  00'Eo\n\nJ I L I N\n\nShenyang\n\nTieling\n\nL I A O N I N G\n\nLinghai\n\nKazuo\nJinxi\n\nYingkou\n\nLiaoyang\n\n41  00'No\n\nShanhaiguan\n\nDonggang\n\nQinhuangdao\n\nSHANXI SMALL CITIES AND\nTOWNS DEVELOPMENT\nDEMONSTRATION SECTOR PROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n41  00'No\n\nZhangijakou\n\nYouyu\n\nDatong\n\nBEIJING\n\nYuanping\n\nS H A N X I\n\nTaiyuan\n\nBazhou\n\nH E B E I\n\nZhufutun\n\nShijiazhuang\nZhaozhou\n\nTianjin\n\nTangshan\n\nT I A N J I N\n\nDalian\n\nBohai   Sea\n\nWutong\n\nPingyao\n\nJinzhou\n\nS H A N D O N G\n\n36  00'No\n\nXiangyuan\n\nPingshun\n\nHouma Jincheng\n\nH E N A N\n\no\n114  00'E\n\nN\n\n50\n\nKilometers\n\nCore Subproject City/Town\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nNational Road\n\nProvincial Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nS H A A N X I\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n36  00'No\n\nYanggao\n\nI N N E R     M O N G O L I A\n\nDatong\n\n40  00'No\n\nYouyu Qiaocun\n\nShuozhou\n\nShenchi\n\nSanggan River\n\nFanshi\n\nLingqiu\n\n40  00'No\n\nYellow   Sea\n\no\n122  00'E\n\no\n111  00'E\n\nBaode\n\nw River)\n(Yello\nH uang H e\n\nXinzhou\n\nH E B E I\n\nJingle\nS H A N X I\n\nGujiao\n\nTAIYUAN\n\nShouyang\n\nYangquan\n\nYuchi\n\nLishi\n\nFenyang\n\nMucun\n\nXiaoyi\n\nWutong\n\nTaigu\n\nQi Xian\n\nPingyao\n\nQin Xian\n\nYushe\n\nZuoquan\n\nHuozhou\n\nQinyuan\n\nLicheng\n\nXiangyuan\n\nTunilu\n\nPu Xian\n\nr\ne\nv\ni\n\nn R\ne\nF\n\nLinfen\n\nChangzhi\n\nPingshun\n\nJishan\n\nHouma\n\nJincheng\n\nYuncheng\n\nYongji\n\nH E N A N\n\no\n111  00'E\n\n114  00'Eo\n\n09-2968 HR\n\n36  00'No\n\n36  00'No\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan, and (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund \nunder the Water Financing Partnership Facility to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the \nShanxi Small Cities and Towns Development Demonstration Sector Project. \n \n2. \nThe  Government  of  the  PRC  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  help \nimprove  environmental  conditions  and  promote  employment  generation  in  a  number  of  small \ncities and towns in Shanxi Province through the provision of urban infrastructure and municipal \nservices, including water supply and sanitation, waste management, urban transport, and other \nmunicipal services. The design and monitoring framework of the Project is in Appendix 1. The \nproblems and objectives tree analyses are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nThe  PRC\u2019s  industrial  development  has  driven  one  of  the  longest  periods  of  sustained, \nlarge-scale economic growth in modern history. To access low-cost labor reserves in rural areas, \nthe  Government  has  progressively  relaxed  migration  policies  since  the  1980s;  an  estimated \n120 million  \u201cfloating  population\u201d  are  now  working  in  cities  across  the  country.  An  additional \n12 million\u201315 million migrate to Chinese cities every year in search of employment. Since 1980, \nthe  PRC\u2019s  urban  population  has  more  than  tripled,  reaching  577  million  in  2006.  The  current \nurban  share  of  total  population  of  45%  is  expected  to  exceed  50%  by  2015.  The  scale  of \nurbanization in the PRC is unprecedented. \n \n4. \nGetting  people  off  the  farm  and  into  the  urban  economy  is  critical  for  maintaining  the \ncurrent  pace  of  economic  growth,  raising  national  economic  productivity,  and  narrowing  the \nurban\u2013rural income gap. This is the key to realizing the Government\u2019s vision of a \u201charmonious \nsociety,\u201d  in  which  the  benefits  of  growth  will  be  shared  more  equitably.  But  there  is  a  limit  to \nwhat  large  cities  can  absorb  without  corresponding  sacrifices  in  economic  efficiency.  Small \ncities  and  towns  must  be  developed  as  urban  assets  capable  of  generating  secondary  and \ntertiary employment, and providing homes to future rural migrants. \n \n5. \nNationally,  the  growth  of  small  cities  and  towns  is  not  keeping  pace  with  that  of  large \ncities.  The  average  annual  growth  rate  of  secondary  (manufacturing)  and  tertiary  (services) \nsectors  in  large  and  medium-sized  cities  was  14.2%  during  2001\u20132005,  compared  with  only \n5.4%  in  small  cities  and  towns.  Overall  county  employment  (including  rural  areas)  has  been \nessentially  flat  for  the  past  30  years,  rising  from  514  million  in  1990  to  546  million  in  2005. \nDuring  that  period  agricultural  employment  dropped  by  10%,  while  secondary  employment \ndoubled and tertiary employment tripled. About 60% of employment in small cities and towns is \nnow in the tertiary sector, with 35% in the secondary sector. Public sector support for the growth \nof  larger  urban  settlements  partly  explains  the  weak  performance  of  small  cities  and  towns. \nDuring  1988\u20132002,  the  gap  between  public  investment  per  capita  in  large  and  medium-sized \ncities versus small cities and towns grew at an average annual rate of 2.8%, while the difference \nin gross domestic product growth per capita widened at an average annual rate of 3.1%. \n \n6. \nAbout  43%  of  the  national  labor  force  is  involved  in  agriculture,  but  they  produce  only \n12% of the gross domestic product. This is the main reason for rural poverty. It is also a driver of \nthe Government\u2019s pro-urbanization policy. The PRC faces the challenge of creating employment \nopportunities and housing for some 250 million\u2013300 million rural people during 2000\u20132020. The \nPRC\u2019s  existing  660  cities  cannot  absorb  the  millions  of  rural  migrants.  In  large  PRC  cities, \ninfrastructure networks such as transport, water supply, wastewater management, and electrical \npower  are  overtaxed  and  showing  signs  of  fatigue.  Heavy  congestion  of  street  and  highway \n\n\f2 \n\nnetworks  within  cities  is  common,  and  wastewater  treatment  systems  lag  far  behind  citywide \nrequirements.  Also,  public  transit  systems  are  underdeveloped  in  relation  to  road  networks. \nWhile  many  large  cities  are  redeveloping  and  increasing  the  density  of  their  centers,  the \ninefficient  patterns  of  urban  land  use  and  increasingly  low-density  peripheral  development  are \nincreasing  transportation  requirements  and  associated  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  As  the \nPRC\u2019s  large  cities  continue  to  grow,  economic  efficiency  is  being  compromised  and \nenvironmental costs are rising. \n \n7. \nSmall cities and towns represent an underutilized resource in the PRC\u2019s urban system. \nThrough development of physical and social infrastructure, towns can attract investment and in-\nmigration from rural areas, thereby playing a more significant role in the drive to urbanize, raise \neconomic  productivity,  and  more  equitably  distribute  the  benefits  of  economic  growth. \nDevelopment of small cities and towns is aimed to attract investments and create jobs to absorb \nthe  rural  migrants.  Increased  disposable  income  will  stimulate  domestic  demand  to  support \neconomic  growth.1 The  PRC\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Plan  2006\u20132010  identifies  small  city  and  town \ndevelopment  as  a  means  to  provide  a  higher  standard  of  living  to  rural  migrants  without \nexacerbating  infrastructure  fatigue  and  other  problems  afflicting  large  cities.  Building  on  the \nconclusions of the ADB-financed Town-Based Urbanization Strategy Study, the new policy calls \nfor strengthening the physical and economic linkages between major cities in metropolitan areas \nor development corridors and the smaller settlements at their periphery.2 \n \n8. \nIn January 2008, the Ministry of Environmental Protection (then the State Environmental \nProtection  Administration)  announced  the  revised  criteria  for  \u201cecologically  sound\u201d  provinces, \ncities,  and  counties;  the  criteria  balance  environmental  protection  objectives  with  economic \ngrowth goals. The Chinese Public\u2019s Environment and Inhabitant Livelihood Index 2007 reports \nthat 26% of Chinese people are very concerned with air quality.3 Awareness is increasing of the \nadverse  effects  of  the  PRC\u2019s  unprecedented  industrialization  that  makes  the  PRC  the  world\u2019s \nsecond  biggest  emitter  of  greenhouse  gases.  The  Government  intends  to  mitigate  climate \nchange to manage its adverse impacts on biodiversity, livelihoods, and economic growth. \n \nThe  Project  is  prepared  as  one  of  three  small  city  and  town  development  projects \n9. \nsupported by the Government. The aim is to promote the development of selected small cities \nand  towns  in  Hebei,  Liaoning,  and  Shanxi  provinces  in  a  way  that  can  be  replicated  in  other \ntowns  in  these  provinces  and  elsewhere  in  the  country.  The  three  provinces  were  selected \nfollowing  the  successful  outcome  of  two  ADB-financed  TA  projects\u2014the  Town-Based \nUrbanization  and  Strategy  Study  (footnote  2)  and  Hebei  Provincial  Development  Strategy. 4 \nWhile the small cities and towns in these provinces face many similar problems and challenges, \nthey also have different characteristics in terms of their geographic location and economy that \noffer  unique  opportunities  for  promoting  inclusive  and  sustainable  development.  Appendix  2 \nprovides a sector and subsector analysis. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nProject  Background. Located in northern PRC, Shanxi Province is a national base for \ncoal  mining,  coke  production,  and  manufacturing  of  industrial  equipment  and  machinery.  The \nprovincial population of 33.75 million was 43% urbanized in 2006. About 3.9% of the population \nlives in absolute poverty, compared with 2.5% nationally.  \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n                                                 \n1  This  is  in  line  with  the  Government  of  the  PRC's  latest  incentive  to  stimulate  sustainable  growth  by  increasing \n\ndomestic demand and lessening reliance on exports. \n\n2  ADB.  2004.

Manila. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\n11. \nIn  recent  years,  small  cities  and  towns  in  Shanxi  Province  have  made  substantial \nprogress  in  facilitating  economic  growth.  Some  resource-based  small  cities  and  towns  have \ntaken  advantage  of  the  growth  of  mining  and  metals.  Some  located  within  metropolitan  areas \nand development corridors play important roles as manufacturing centers, transportation hubs, \nor agroprocessing sites; while others have been successful in capturing multiplier effects in the \nservice sector. Tourism has been a major driver of economic growth in small cities and towns \nbecause  of  significant  historic  and  cultural  assets.  From  2001\u20132005,  the  secondary  sector  in \nShanxi small cities and towns grew at about 32% per annum and the tertiary sector by 5%. \n \nGrowth  has  come  at  a  considerable  cost.  In  many  towns,  industrial  development  has \n12. \noutstripped  local  government  capacity  for  urban  management  and  infrastructure  provision, \nresulting  in  degradation  of  local  living  conditions  and  the  natural  environment.  Only  70%  of \nhouseholds in Shanxi towns have access to piped drinking water as compared with more than \n90%  in  most  large  cities.  The  large  majority  of  Shanxi\u2019s  11  small  cities  and  561  towns  lack \nwastewater  treatment  capacity.  In  the  absence  of  widespread  centralized  heating  and  natural \ngas,  coal-burning  stoves  serve  as  the  main  energy  source  for  domestic  heating  and  cooking. \nOnly  one  in  five  towns  have  a  solid  waste  treatment  station.  As  a  result  of  these  inadequate \nmunicipal services, many areas of the province suffer from air, water, and land pollution, which \nthreatens  human  health  and  reduces  life  expectancy.  Local  governments  lack  the  capital  and \nexpertise  to  provide,  in  a  timely  fashion,  the  infrastructure  that  would  mitigate  the  negative \nenvironmental and social impacts of their economic gains.  \n \nAt  the  same  time,  many  small  cities  and  towns\u2014especially  those  outside  of  the  coal- \n13. \nand  coke-producing  regions\u2014suffer  from  low  investment,  low  economic  growth  rates,  and \nunderemployment.  Household  incomes  are  low,  and  economic  opportunities  few.  The  primary \nsector still accounts for 61% of total county employment, reflecting the highly agrarian character \nof  much  of  Shanxi.  In  2006,  about  43%  of  the  workforce  was  engaged  in  agriculture,  while \nproducing only 6% of the province\u2019s gross domestic product.5 To be able to absorb rural labor, \nthese towns need to attract investment by providing infrastructure and basic services. Learning \nfrom the previous generation of cities, these poor cities have the opportunity to anticipate urban \nenvironmental problems, and mitigate them with sufficient investments in key infrastructure and \nurban services. \n \n14. \nThe  Shanxi  provincial  government  (SPG)  policy  on  the  development  of  its  small  cities \nand  towns  mirrors  the  national  policy.  The  Directives  on  Accelerating  Development  of  Small \nCities  and  Towns  in  Shanxi  Province  identifies  small  cities  and  towns  as  growth  engines  for \nsurrounding  rural  areas  that  can  absorb  rural  migrants  and relieve  population  pressure  on  the \nprovince\u2019s  large  cities. 6  In  this  respect,  the  development  of  towns  and  county-level  cities \ncontributes directly to the provincial objective of promoting integrated rural\u2013urban development. \n \n15. \nProject  Rationale. The PRC is striving to develop small cities as a means to promote \nrural\u2013urban  integration  and  the  emergence  of  a  more  harmonious  society.  The  Project  will \nincrease economic, social, and environmental sustainability of small city and town development \nby  improving  urban  infrastructure  and  municipal  services.  The  improvements  will  (i)  attract \neconomic investment, especially in employment-intensive industries and services, by providing \nreliable  international  standard  infrastructure  such  as  roads,  water  supply,  and  sewerage; \n(ii) provide  better  living  conditions  and  a  decent  urban  environment  to  town  residents  by \nsubstituting  centralized  heating  for  household  coal  burning,  treating  wastewater  before \ndischarging  it  into  the  natural  environment,  and  introducing  sanitary  practices  in  solid  waste \ncollection  and  treatment;  and  (iii)  extend  the  benefits  of  growth  to  all  residents  across  the \nsocioeconomic spectrum by improving coverage and quality of basic municipal services.  \n \n                                                 \n5  National Bureau of Statistics. 2007.

The Project will assist the provincial and \ncounty governments to develop a mechanism for selecting and prioritizing subproject cities and \ntowns  with  potential  for  employment  generation,  economic  growth,  and  environmental \nimprovement.  Increased  employment  opportunities  will  contribute  directly  to  the  Government\u2019s \ngoal of closing the rural\u2013urban income gap, as farm workers will fill new industrial and service \njobs  in  cities  and  towns.  Activities  to  develop  markets  and  create  jobs  by  supporting \nurbanization  and  protecting  the  environment  in  small  cities  and  towns  are  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nstrategic objective of promoting equitable growth in the PRC. \n \n17. \nThe  subproject  towns  included  in  the  Project  have  potential  for  stronger  economic \ngrowth and employment generation to support SPG\u2019s policy for development of small cities and \ntowns.  The  subproject  towns  are  all  strategically  located  in  the  province  and  their  economy  is \nlargely  based  on  tourism,  resource  processing,  and  light  manufacturing.  These  are  economic \nsectors that the SPG wants to promote. However, municipal infrastructure and services in these \ntowns are inadequate, and proper environmental infrastructure must be in place to ensure that \nongoing and planned development is sustainable. \n \n18. \nThe  Project  will  enable  improved  urban  infrastructure  delivery  by  implementing \nsubprojects in selected small cities and towns. The overarching objectives of these subprojects \nwill  be  to  increase  employment  and  economic  growth,  improve  the  urban  environment,  and \nenhance  urban  infrastructure  and  municipal  services.  Depending  on  their  assets,  towns  will \ntarget \nindustry  (including  agroprocessing); \nenvironmentally sustainable resource extraction; and/or the development of the service sector, \nincluding tourism. All targeted small cities and towns have approved development master plans \nand programs that the subprojects will directly support. Category A environmental assessments \nwill  be  undertaken  to  ensure  that  each  subproject  will  minimize  adverse  environmental  costs \nand  maximize  environmental  benefits.  New  vocational  training  centers  and  other  schools  will \ncomplement the physical infrastructure by increasing the skills of the workforce. Supplementary \nAppendix B contains the sector policy framework. \n \n19. \nThe  Project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  which \nincludes managing the environment, catalyzing investment, and improving governance.7 ADB\u2019s \nexperience  and  knowledge  in  urban  environmental  improvement  and  management,  including \nsupporting utility tariff reforms, will add value to the Project, especially for small cities and towns \nthat are undergoing urbanization and economic transformation. The Project conforms to ADB\u2019s \nwater  policy8 and  water  financing  program,9 which  seek  to  improve  urban  water  investments \nthrough technical assistance (TA) and investments in water supply, sanitation and wastewater \nmanagement,  and  environmental  improvement.  It  is  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  urban  sector \nstrategy, which supports infrastructure investment in settlements that serve as dynamic engines \nof  economic  growth  and  employment  creation,  innovation,  and  entrepreneurship,  as  well  as \nsources of social services.10 The Project will have a positive impact on the living environment of \nurban  residents,  including  the  poor,  through  the  improvement  of  roads and  transport  systems, \nwater supply, wastewater treatment, solid waste management, district heating, and rivers. It also \nindirectly  supports  ADB\u2019s  various  renewable  energy,  energy  efficiency,  and  climate  change \ninitiatives by introducing secondary wastewater treatment and improving traffic management in \nrapidly growing small cities and towns.11  \n \n\nto  promote \n\ninvestments \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2008.

Additional  greenhouse  gas  reductions  will  be  secured  through  the  development  of \ndenser,  mixed-use  neighborhoods  that  reduce  reliance  on  private  cars.  The  developments  in \ntwo  of  the  core  subprojects  under  the  Project  are  examples  of  this  approach  and  can  be \nreplicated elsewhere in the province. \n \n21. \nSector  Lending  Approach.  Because  of  the  varying  degree  of  preparedness  of  the \nsubproject cities and towns to be included in the Project and the possibility that some of them \nmay  change  during  project  implementation,  the  Government  agreed  that  the  ADB  sector  loan \nmodality  is  more  appropriate  as  it  allows  greater  flexibility  during  project  implementation.  The \nsector  loan  approach  is  based  on  the  following:  (i)  The  Government's  sector  policies, \ndevelopment objectives, and approach to urban infrastructure development and environmental \nmanagement are well formulated. Progress in implementing policies has been satisfactory and \nthe  Government  is  continually  updating  its  sector  policies  with  ADB  support.13 (ii)  The  sector \ninstitutions  are  well  developed;  with  additional  strengthening  and  support  provided  under  the \nProject,  they  will  have  the  capacity  to  implement  the  sector  investment  plan,  particularly  for \ncounty  and  town  governments.  SPG,  the  Executing  Agency,  has  substantial  experience \nimplementing similar projects. (iii) The sector investment plan and the planned subprojects are \nwell  conceived  and  appropriately  formulated  to  meet  the  priority  needs  of  the  Shanxi  Urban \nDevelopment  Master  Plan.  SPG  has  met  these  conditions  and  developed  subproject \nidentification,  selection,  and  appraisal  criteria  and  procedures  to  ensure  that  the  Project  will \nfacilitate  achievement  of  the  objectives  of  sector  policies  and  plans.  Appendix  3  shows  the \nprocess  of  subproject  identification,  selection,  preparation,  and  appraisal.  Supplementary \nAppendix C provides the subproject appraisal criteria and report template. \n \nPolicy  Dialogue.  The  Project  will  build  on  and  further  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  on \n22. \n(i) integrated development of cities, towns, and rural areas to generate employment and reduce \npoverty; (ii) sustainable urban environmental management; (iii) economic sustainability of urban \ninfrastructure  services;  (iv)  governance  and  anticorruption;  and  (v)  participatory  approach  to \nproject design. \n \n23.  With a view to integrated development of urban and rural areas, SPG will use the criteria \ndeveloped during project design to target resources to small cities and towns that can generate \njobs  for  rural  migrants  and  demand  for  agricultural  products,  and  reverse  environmental \ndegradation.  SPG  intends  to  refine  its  poverty  reduction  policy  to  encourage  small  cities  and \ntowns \nthrough \n(i) infrastructure delivery, (ii) effective self-promotion of towns as good places for businesses to \ninvest,  and  (iii)  vocational  training  services  offered  by  county  governments  to  align labor  skills \nwith market demand. \n \n24. \nSPG  will  encourage  local  governments  to  adopt  a  more  integrated  approach  to \ninfrastructure  planning  and  delivery.  For  example,  when  planning  river  improvement  projects, \nlocal  governments  will  examine  the  possibility  of  simultaneously  improving  solid  waste  and \nwastewater  management  services  to  reduce  discharge  of  waste  into  the  river.  Similarly,  to \n\nlabor-intensive  service  sectors, \n\njob  creation,  especially \n\nto  promote \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n12 National Development and Reform Commission. 2007.

The  Project  will  continue  to  provide \nsupport through the capacity development component.  \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nmaximize the impact of energy services improvements on reducing greenhouse gases and on \nimproved air quality, local governments can simultaneously plan and coordinate district heating \nand natural gas system extensions. Wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal works could \nbe  conceived  and  built  as  one  integrated  system  and  managed  by  one  agency  to  improve \nefficiency and facilitate cost recovery of wastewater collection and treatment services. \n \n25. \nEconomic  sustainability  of  urban  infrastructure  services  requires  better  financial \nmanagement  on  the  part  of  urban  infrastructure  service  providers  and  more  market-oriented \npricing of urban services. SPG intends to improve enforcement of the 1999 national government \nrequirement that urban services providers can generate sufficient revenues to cover their costs. \nIn many towns, this would require that user tariffs be increased gradually to the point where tariff \nrevenues cover the costs of operation and maintenance (O&M). To improve affordability for low-\nincome groups, a more rationalized tariff structure is recommended for urban services, in which \nunit prices are in direct proportion to consumption. SPG will endeavor to formulate a policy and \nput into effect guidelines for use of block tariffs in water supply, wastewater, district heating, and \nnatural  gas  services  in  small  cities  and  towns.  The  Project  will  support  SPG  in  tariff  reform \nthrough  the  capacity  development  component.  The  proposed  $250,000  grant  from  the  Multi-\nDonor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility will complement  the support \nby strengthening the management capacity of water and wastewater service providers involved \nin the Project. \n \n26. \nADB  has  very  strict  guidelines  and  zero  tolerance  for  fraud  and  corruption.  Bidders, \nsuppliers, and contractors must observe the highest ethical standards for the procurement and \nexecution of ADB-financed contracts; sanctions will apply if fraud and corruption in procurement \nare  discovered.  SPG  and  each  subproject  city  and/or  town  government  are  recommended  to \nconsider undertaking the following actions: (i) involve discipline investigation bureaus in bidding \nand construction to enhance construction quality control and effective supervision; (ii) introduce \na  dual-signing  system  in  which  each  construction  contract  winner  also  signs  an  anticorruption \nagreement  with  the  implementing  agency;  (iii) periodically  inspect  the  contractors\u2019  activities \nrelated  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  (iv)  engage  a  loan  implementation  consultant  to \nsupport the project management office (PMO) to ensure good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency in project operations; and (v) update rules and regulations on local and corporate \ngovernance  and  anticorruption,  and  enhance  transparency  of  each  implementing  agency\u2019s \noperation in consultation with relevant central government ministries. \n \n27. \nThe  Project  is  formulated  to  take  into  consideration  and  incorporate  into  the  project \ndesign the comments and ideas from various levels of government, beneficiaries, and affected \npeople  including  vulnerable  groups,  through  stakeholder  meetings,  focus  group  discussions, \ninformant interviews, and household surveys. This ensures local participation and involvement \nin  subproject  identification  and  implementation,  and  O&M  of  improved  infrastructure.  A  design \nand  monitoring  framework  was  created  and  refined  in  the  process.  For  future  urban \ninterventions,  the  Shanxi  PMO  and  subproject  governments  can  use  the  knowledge  and \nexperience of this participatory approach to strengthen their ability to guide their development. \n \n28. \nExternal  Assistance.  Since  1992,  ADB  has  provided  32  loans  totaling  more  than  \n$3.8 billion to the PRC for environmental improvement and infrastructure projects. ADB has also \nprovided $56 million for more than 80 TA studies to prepare these projects, and to review and \nstudy  key  issues  in  environmental  improvement  and  infrastructure.  The  Project  is  built  on  the \nTown-Based  Urbanization  Strategy  Study  TA  (footnote  2),  which  recommends  a  range  of \nmeasures  to  facilitate  development  of  small  cities  and  towns  in  the  PRC.  ADB  and  the  World \nBank  have  provided  external  assistance  to  Shanxi  Province  (Appendix  4).  The  Government \nclosely  coordinates  external  assistance  to  the  sector  and  ADB  missions  meet  frequently  with \nother development partners to share sectoral information and experiences. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\n29. \nLessons.  Lessons  from  ADB  and  SPG  experience  in  urban  development  projects  include \nthe  following:  (i)  strategic  master  plans  play  an  important  role  in  providing  a  comprehensive \nframework for urban development and environmental management; (ii) increased public awareness \nand education are vital for improving the urban environment, and therefore public consultation and \ninvolvement and awareness training on environmental health and protection should be provided; and \n(iii)  the  establishment  of  an  effective  internal  and  external  monitoring  mechanism  for  resettlement \nimplementation  is  important  to  ensure  effective  coordination  and  timely  implementation  of  land \napproval, compensation, and rehabilitation measures. These issues were reviewed and the relevant \nlessons incorporated in the project design. \n \n30. \nADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  PRC\u2019s  wastewater  management  and  water  supply  sector \nindicates that projects are well planned and implemented, and wastewater and water tariffs are \nincreased  as  required.  Willingness-to-pay  analysis  indicates  that  consumers  are  willing  to  pay \nsubstantially  higher  prices  for  water,  and  to  a  certain  extent,  are  willing  to  pay  for  wastewater \ntreatment.  The  following  lessons  from  previous  projects  are  reflected  in  the  project  design: \n(i) increase  focus  on  institutional  strengthening  measures  to  improve  corporate  governance, \n(ii) improve  provincial  coordination,  and  (iii)  ensure  financial  and  institutional  arrangements  for \nproper O&M. \n \n31. \nLessons from ADB and World Bank experience in urban transport projects highlight the \nimportance of a (i) comprehensive and participatory approach to project preparation; (ii) planned \nand  well-coordinated  resettlement  scheme  preceded  by  adequate  consultation  with  affected \nparties  before  relocation;  (iii)  professional  approach  to  forecasting  traffic  demand;  (iv) paying \nattention  to  issues  like  public  transport  and  traffic  management,  road  safety,  vehicle  emission \ncontrol, and road maintenance to complement investment in urban roads; and (v) participation \nand  coordination  of  all  agencies  with  responsibilities  for  urban  transport  to  ensure  project \nsustainability. These lessons were considered for the project design. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nA. \n \n32. \nThe impact of the Project is improved environmental quality and increased employment \ngeneration in small cities and towns in Shanxi Province. The project outcome is improved urban \ninfrastructure and municipal services in about seven small cities and towns in the province. \n \nB. \n \nThe Project includes about seven subproject small cities and towns. Detailed assessment \n33. \nand analyses were undertaken for the three core subprojects\u2014Pingyao county, Wutong town, and \nYouyu  county.  Subsequent  subprojects  will  be  selected,  prepared,  and  appraised  during \nimplementation.  Each  subproject  includes  one  or  more  components,  consisting  of  capital \nimprovements  to  urban  infrastructure  or  municipal  services.  The  eligible  subsectors  for  the \ncomponents include roads and associated services, water supply, wastewater management, solid \nwaste  management,  river  improvement,  district  heating,  gas  supply,  area  upgrading,  and \neducation.  Supplementary  Appendix  D  provides  the  candidate  subsequent  subprojects,  and \nSupplementary Appendix E the technical analysis of the core subprojects. \n \n34. \nIn 1997, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization designated \nPingyao, which is located at the heart of a major cultural tourism corridor, a World Heritage site. \nWhile  tourism  is  growing  rapidly,  Pingyao  faces  significant  environmental  stress  due  to  the \nproximity of industrial facilities and inadequate management of wastewater and solid waste. The \nsubproject  includes  rehabilitation  of  Huiji  River,  which  will  improve  flood  control,  reduce \ngroundwater  pollution,  and  reduce  public  health  risks.  The  component  calls  for  dredging, \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nconstruction  of  embankments,  and  installation  of  rubber  dams  for  water  storage  along  a  \n7.2 kilometer (km) segment of the river. \n \n35. \nLike  many  towns  across  Shanxi  Province,  Wutong  experienced  a  massive  economic \nboom  as  a  result  of  increased  coal  and  coke  production.  Environmental  infrastructure  has  not \nkept  pace  with  the  town\u2019s  ability  to  manage  urban  growth,  and  Wutong  is  now  experiencing \nsevere  air,  ground,  and  water  pollution.  With  help  from  Xiaoyi  City,  the  county  seat,  Wutong \nproposes to develop a new urban expansion area to house up to 30,000 residents upwind of the \ncoke  and  aluminum  plants.  The  Project  calls  for  construction  of  basic  horizontal  and  vertical \ninfrastructure  (including  schools)  on  a  100-hectare  site  that  will  connect  the  urbanized  area  of \nWutong with that of adjacent Xiaoyi City. The Wutong subproject has five components: (i) Caoxi \nroad  and  associated  municipal  services,  (ii)  heat  supply,  (iii)  gas  supply,  (iv)  wastewater \ntreatment, and (v) education facilities. The gas and heating investments will allow residents to \nswitch from coal-fired stoves for domestic cooking and heating. The wastewater treatment plant \nwill  improve  environmental  quality.  Education  facilities,  which  include  a  vocational  training \ncenter, will assist the local population to adapt to changing needs of the labor market. \n \nYouyu county enjoys relatively good air quality  given its location in northern Shanxi on \n36. \nthe  windward  side  of  the  main  coal-producing  areas.  The  county  proposes  to  leverage  its \nsuperior environmental condition and access to markets to attract agroprocessing, light industry, \nand  service  sector  firms.  The  subproject  includes  basic  infrastructure  to  support  the \ndevelopment of a new urban area where workers and managers can live. Other investments in \nriver improvement, wastewater treatment, and district heating will enhance and sustain the city\u2019s \nurban environmental quality. The combination of job opportunities and good living conditions is \nanticipated  to  attract  rural  migrants  from  villages  in  northern  Shanxi  to  Youyu.  The  Youyu \nsubproject has five components: (i) heat supply, (ii) water supply, (iii) drainage and wastewater \ncollection, (iv) roads and associated municipal services, and (v) flood control.  \n \n37. \nThe Project will also provide institutional development and capacity building in small city \nand  town  development,  municipal  infrastructure,  environmental  management,  and  policy \nreforms  to  ensure  sustainability  of  the  Project  and  related  facilities.  As  this  is  the  first  ADB \nsector  loan  for  the  Shanxi  PMO,  and  the  subproject  cities  and  towns  have  limited  experience \nwith internationally funded projects and are not familiar with ADB procedures and international \nbest  practices,  institutional  capacity  in  subproject  implementation  and  operation  of  project \nfacilities  and  services  must  be  strengthened  so  the  facilities  and  services  will  be  sustainable \nboth operationally and financially in the long term.  \n \nC. \n \n38. \nDevelopment of the Project was directly supported by ADB-financed advisory policy and \nstrategy studies. The underlying technical approach for the Project is based on the findings of a \nsuccessfully  completed  advisory  TA  on  a  town-based  urbanization  strategy  covering  Liaoning \nand  Shanxi  as  case  study  provinces,  a  provincial  development  strategy  study  for  Hebei \nProvince, and government policies and plans for small city and town development.  \n \n39. \nThe Project will achieve a demonstration effect for other small cities and towns. The core \nsubproject towns, which are representative of other towns in Shanxi, will demonstrate to similar \nsmall  cities  and  towns  how  they  can  achieve  economically,  socially,  and  environmentally \nsustainable  urban  development  and  greater  economic  integration  with  rural  areas  and  larger \ncities. The Shanxi PMO will ensure that lessons identified by the project towns are disseminated \nto nonproject towns through seminars, field visits, promotional materials, and/or the media. ADB \nwill  endeavor  to  support  dissemination  and  sharing  of  lessons  by  financing  seminars  \n(i)  provincially  to  demonstrate  how  the  advisory  TA  strategy  was  operationalized  through  the \ndifferent  subprojects  and  their  components;  and  (ii)  nationally  and  internationally  to  showcase \nspecial  innovative  features  of  the  approach  of  this  sector  Project,  and  those  in  Liaoning  and \n\nSpecial Features \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\nHebei to prepare and implement sustainable town development projects. \n \n40. \nThe Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility will provide a \n$250,000 grant for the Project to strengthen financial management and corporate governance in \nwater and wastewater agencies and companies in participating small cities and towns in Shanxi \nProvince.  Appendix  5  is  a  summary  of  the  support  for  water  and  wastewater  facilities,  and \nSupplementary Appendix F provides details about the scope of work under the grant. \n \n41. \nThe education component in Wutong is the first social services component in an ADB-\nsupported  project  in  the  PRC.  By  pairing  labor  market  analysis  with  school  construction,  the \ncomponent sets out a comprehensive strategy for upgrading workforce skills in small cities and \ntowns  in  the  PRC  to  meet  the  challenges  of  rapid  urbanization  and  economic  growth.  The \ncapacity  development  component  will  assist  the  Wutong  town  government  in  undertaking  the \nlabor market analysis and assessment of the curriculum. ADB is supporting SPG in improving \nits technical education and vocational training system for urban residents and rural migrants to \neffectively meet the skill needs and labor markets in Shanxi Province.14 \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n42. \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $224.7  million,  including  taxes  and  duties. \nTable  1  provides  a  summary  of  the  project  investment  plan,  details  are  in  Appendix 6  and \nSupplementary Appendix G. \n\n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\n1. \nPingyao Subproject \n2.

The \nGovernment  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The loan will finance 45% of the project cost, including civil \nworks;  equipment  and  supplies;  project  consulting  services  and  training;  financial  charges  on \nthe loan during construction; and taxes, duties, and bank charges. The Government will finance \ncontingencies.  The  Pingyao  county  government,  Xiaoyi  city  government,  Youyu  county \ngovernment,  and  subsequent  county  governments,  through  tax  and  nontax  revenues,  will \nprovide counterpart funding. The three core subproject governments have provided commitment \nletters. The Multi-Donor Trust Fund15 under the Water Financing Partnership Facility will provide \ngrant  cofinancing  equivalent  to  $250,000,  to  be  administered  by  SPG.  The  grant  will  support \ninstitutional and financial management capacity development of water and wastewater entities. \nThe financing plan for the Project is summarized in Table 2, with details provided in Appendix 6 \nand Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nShare of Total\n% \n\nTotal \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n45 \n0 \n10 \n7 \n8 \n31 \n100 \n\nTotal \n100.0 \n0.3 \n21.9 \n15.8 \n18.3 \n68.5 \n224.7 \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank loana \nMulti-Donor Trust Fundb under the Water Financing Partnership Facility \nPingyao county government (Pingyao subproject) \nXiaoyi city government (Wutong subproject) \nYouyu county government (Youyu subproject) \nOther county governments (subsequent subprojects) \n \na  The ADB loan will cover bank charges, taxes, and duties. \nb  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, and Norway.

The  PRC  will  make  the  entire  loan  available  to \nSPG,  which  will  make  different  portions  of  the  loan  proceeds  available  to  the  concerned \nmunicipal  and  county  governments  and  then  to  the  implementing  agencies.16 The  terms  and \nconditions of the loan proceeds transferred within the government system will be the same as \nthose  of  the  ADB  loan,  with  the  concerned  county  governments  bearing  the  interest  and \nexchange rate variation risk. Appendix 7 shows the relending and onlending arrangements and \nindicative flow of funds. The end-borrowers will bear the same terms and conditions as those of \nthe loan, with these implementing agencies bearing the foreign exchange and interest variation \nrisk. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n45. \nSPG is the Executing Agency for the Project. A project leading group (PLG), chaired by \na  vice-governor  and  comprising  senior  government  officials  of  concerned  bureaus  and \ncommissions,  was  established  to  provide  overall  guidance  and  support  to  project  preparation \nand  implementation.  A  PMO  located  in  the  Shanxi  Housing  and  Urban-Rural  Development \nBureau was established under the PLG to undertake and manage day-to-day project activities. \n\n                                                 \n15 Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, and Norway. \n16 In loans involving some form of financial intermediation, the term \u201crelend\u201d is used when ADB loans are relent by the \nborrower  to  one  or  more  intermediaries.  The  term  \u201conlend\u201d  is  used  when  the  funds  are  then  onlent  by  these \nintermediaries to subborrowers. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11 \n\nIn  each  subproject  city  and  town,  a  PLG  and  PMO  will  be  set  up  to  liaise  with  the  provincial \nPMO  and  oversee  and  manage  the  work  undertaken  by  the  implementing  agencies.  The \nimplementing  agencies  are  (i)  in  Pingyao,  the  county  Water  Affairs  Bureau  for  the  Huiji  River \nimprovement  component;  (ii)  in  Wutong,  the  Xiaoyi  City  Engineering  and  Construction \nManagement  Affairs  Office  for  all  components;  and  (iii)  in  Youyu,  the  Youyu  County \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission  for  all  components.  Appendix  8  shows  the  project \nimplementation  organization  and  Supplementary  Appendix  H  contains \ninstitutional \narrangements and assessment. \n \n\nthe \n\nSubproject \n\nSubproject Preparation and Appraisal \n\n2. \n \n46. \nIn  addition  to  the  three  core  subprojects  being  prepared,  additional  subprojects  will  be \nselected,  prepared,  and  appraised  during  sector  project  implementation  using  the  following \nthree-stage process. \n \n47. \nIdentification  and  Selection.  The  subprojects  will  be  selected  in \naccordance with the following criteria: (i) confirmation by the local government of its ability and \nwillingness to arrange counterpart financing and comply with ADB safeguard policies and other \nrequirements; (ii) confirmation by the concerned local government on its willingness to comply \nwith  ADB  safeguard  policies  and  other  requirements;  (iii)  the  implementation  period  of  the \nsubproject  is  within  2009\u20132015;  (iv)  eligibility  of  the  components  (roads  and  associated \nmunicipal services, water supply, wastewater management, river improvement, area upgrading, \nsolid waste management, district heating, or education); and (v) anticipated positive impact on \nthe  urban  environment,  employment  generation,  economic  growth,  and  coverage  or  service \nlevel of infrastructure and municipal services. \n \nSubproject Preparation. The participating city or county government and implementing \n48. \nagency, with the guidance of the Shanxi PMO, will prepare project design documents including \na project proposal, feasibility study, and preliminary engineering design for the components of \nthe proposed subproject in accordance with the national project investment specifications. The \nproject  design  documents  will  cover  subproject  rationale;  scope;  components;  technical \nanalysis;  cost  estimates;  financing  plan;  implementation  arrangements;  financial  management \nassessment;  and  financial,  economic,  social,  and  institutional  analyses.  These  documents  will \nbe  submitted  to  the  Shanxi  Development  and  Reform  Commission  for  approval.  The \nparticipating  city  or  county  government  will  also  prepare an  environmental  impact  assessment \n(EIA)  and  a  resettlement  plan  to  be  submitted  to  the  concerned  provincial  departments  and \nbureaus for approval. \n \nSubproject  Appraisal  and  Approval. The Shanxi PMO and other concerned bureaus \n49. \nwill be responsible for appraising the subprojects in accordance with criteria agreed upon by the \nPRC  Government  and  ADB.  The  subproject  PMO  will  prepare  a  subproject  appraisal  report, \nwhich will follow the template in the project preparatory TA final report, and submit the appraisal \nreport to the municipal finance bureau and municipal development and reform commission for \nreview  and  then  to  the  Shanxi  PMO  for  further  review.  The  Shanxi  PMO  will  submit  the \nsubproject appraisal report to the Shanxi Finance Bureau and Shanxi Development and Reform \nCommission for endorsement before submitting it to ADB for review and approval. \n \nSubsequent  subprojects  will  receive  the  same  extent  of  environmental  safeguard \n50. \nscrutiny, modeled on the EIAs for the three core subprojects and the summary EIA (SEIA). The \nShanxi PMO will submit the EIAs to ADB for review, after which the revised EIAs will be posted \non the ADB website. An environmental assessment and management framework was prepared \nto assess subsequent subprojects. For other safeguard concerns, a resettlement framework and \nan  ethnic  minority  development  framework  were  prepared  for  subsequent  subprojects.  Draft \nresettlement plans will be prepared using core subproject resettlement plans as models. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n51. \nGiven  that  this  is  the  first  sector  project  for  SPG,  appraisal  of  the  initial  one  or  two \nsubsequent subprojects may take more time to meet ADB and domestic requirements. To allow \nfor  more  flexibility  for  SPG  to  select  subsequent  subprojects  to  meet  the  varied  pace  of \ndevelopment of small cities and towns in Shanxi, the Project will be implemented over 6 years \nfrom  late-2009  to  late-2015  (Appendix  9).  This  also  takes  into  account  the  project  scope, \nconstruction  technology  requirements,  and  climatic  conditions.  The  schedule  is  considered \nrealistic because SPG has experience implementing projects financed by international financial \ninstitutions,  the  project  implementation  structure  is  in  place,  and  preparatory  works  are  under \nway.  ADB\u2019s  successful  experience  with  similar  projects  in  the  PRC  combined  with  the \nknowledge and experience of SPG in municipal infrastructure and environmental improvement \nprojects indicate that the schedule is achievable. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement and Consulting Services \n\n \n52. \nGoods, works, and services financed under the loan will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Preliminary  contract \npackages  were  formulated  in  consultation  with  the  implementing  agencies.  The  procurement \ncapacity  of  SPG,  the  PMOs,  and  the  implementing  agencies  was  assessed  (Supplementary \nAppendix I). Results of the assessment indicate that SPG has the capacity and experience to \ncarry out advance procurement. Contracts for goods estimated to cost $1 million or more, and \ncontracts  for  works  estimated  to  cost  $10  million  or  more,  will  be  procured  using  international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures.  Contracts  for  goods  and  works  estimated  to  cost  less  than \nthese thresholds but more than $100,000 will be procured on the basis of national competitive \nbidding  procedures  in  accordance  with  the  PRC  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law,  subject  to \nmodifications  and  clarifications  agreed  with  ADB.  Contracts  for  goods  and  works  estimated  to \ncost $100,000 or less will be procured using shopping procedures in accordance with the PRC \nTendering and Bidding Law. Prior review will be adopted for all international competitive bidding \npackages  and  the  first  national  competitive  bidding  package.  Details  of  the  procurement  plan \nare provided in Appendix 10 and Supplementary Appendix J. \n \n53. \nThe Project includes provision for funding for about 158 person-months of international \nand  national  consulting  services.  The  consulting  services  will  cover  (i)  support  to  the  Shanxi \nPMO,  and  city  and  town  PMOs  and  implementing  agencies  for  project  preparation  and \nmanagement  including  procurement;  (ii)  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS); \n (iii)  procurement;  (iv) financial  management  including  ADB disbursement  and  imprest  account \nprocedures;  (v) appraisal  of  subsequent  subprojects;  (vi)  environmental  management;  \n(vii)  social,  ethnic,  and  resettlement  implementation;  (viii)  vocational  education  program \nimplementation;  and  (ix) institutional  strengthening.  Capacity  development  for  the  PMOs  and \nimplementing agencies will be achieved through consultant inputs; training courses provided by \nuniversities,  specialized  institutes,  and  firms;  in-country  and/or  international  study  visits;  and \nacquisition  of  equipment  financed  from  the  loan.  To  assist  the  PMOs  and  implementing \nagencies  in  expediting  project  implementation  start-up,  one  international  project  management \nand  procurement  specialist  (1  person-month)  and  one  national  project  management  and \nprocurement specialist (2 person-months) will be engaged individually prior to recruitment of the \nconsulting  firm.  The  consulting  services  will  be engaged  in accordance with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  using  the  standard  80:20 \nquality- and cost-based selection method and simplified technical proposal. The outline terms of \nreference for consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix K. \n\n \n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing  \n\n \n54. \nADB  approved  SPG\u2019s  request  to  use  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  for \nrecruitment of consultants, training, and procurement of goods and civil works; and retroactive \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13 \n\nfinancing of eligible expenditures up to $20 million (equivalent to 20% of the ADB loan), incurred \nbefore  loan  effectiveness,  but  not  more  than  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  Loan \nAgreement.17 Advance contracting will include (i) prequalification of contractors, (ii) preparation \nof  tender  documents,  (iii)  evaluation  of  bids,  and  (iv)  recruitment  of  consultants.  All  advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing will be undertaken in conformity with the ADB Procurement \nGuidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The issuance of invitations to bid under \nadvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  The  PRC \nGovernment, SPG, and the implementing agencies have been advised that approval of advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n\n \n6. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption Policy \n\n \n55. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government, SPG, PMOs, and implementing agencies. Consistent with its commitment \nto  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate \ndirectly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices \nrelating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions \nspecifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing \nAgency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to \nthe  Project.  This  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country  partnership  strategy  (2008\u20132010),  which \nincludes the promotion of good governance by supporting reform and capacity development in \ncorporate governance (footnote 7). SPG has indicated its commitment to fight corruption and a \nnumber  of  anticorruption  actions  are  included  as  covenants  in  the  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements.18 Under these covenants, SPG will \n \n\ninvolve  the  agencies  responsible  for  oversight  of  each  implementing  agency  in \nbidding  and  construction  to  enhance  construction  quality  control,  and  supervise \neffective work; \nintroduce  a  dual-signing  system  in  which  the  civil  works  contract  winner  also \nsigns an anticorruption agreement with the implementing agency; \nperiodically  inspect  the  contractors\u2019  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and \nsettlements; and \nengage the loan implementation consultant to support the Shanxi PMO and city \nand  town  PMOs  and  implementing  agencies  to  ensure  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency in project operations. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n56. \nThe  ADB  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  procedures  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  expedite  project \nimplementation through timely release of loan proceeds, SPG will establish an imprest account \npromptly after loan effectiveness at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB.19 Only one imprest \naccount  will  be  established  at  the  provincial  finance  bureau,  which  will  be  responsible  for \nmunicipal  and  county  withdrawal  applications.  Disbursements  from  the  imprest  account  to  the \nimplementing  agencies  will  be  based  on  actual  expenditures  with  full  supporting  documents, \nwhich  is  in  line  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  internal  regulations.  Withdrawal  applications  will \ndemonstrate, among other things, that the goods and/or services have been produced in or from \n\n                                                 \n17  Advance  action  on  the  procurement  and  recruitment  of  consultants,  and  the  posting  of  the  general  procurement \nnotice  on  the  ADB  website,  will  facilitate  the  start  of  the  advance  action  process.  ADB  Management  approved \nadvance contracting and retroactive financing at the management review meeting on 12 November 2008. \n\n18  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  (2008\u20132010)  for  the  PRC,  which  includes  the  promotion  of  good \n\ngovernance. \n\n19  Bank charges on the imprest account will be financed from the ADB loan. \n\n(i)   \n\n(ii)   \n\n(iii)  \n\n(iv)  \n\n \n7. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nADB members, and are eligible for ADB financing. The maximum amount to be deposited to the \nimprest account will not exceed the estimated ADB share of eligible project expenditures to be \nfinanced  through  the  imprest  account  for  the  next  6  months  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount, \nwhichever  is  lower.  The  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  will  be  used  for  liquidation  and \nreplenishment of the imprest account and reimbursement of eligible expenditures not exceeding \n$200,000  per  individual  payment.  No  withdrawal  will  be  made  from  the  loan  account  for \nsubprojects in which one or more of the implementing agencies is a legally registered company \nuntil the following condition has been met: the Ministry of Finance submits to ADB certification \nthat (i) the subproject government and the company have entered into an onlending agreement; \nand (ii) such onlending agreement contains the same financial terms and conditions and other \nobligations as required in the Loan Agreement. SPG will set up a separate bank account for the \n$250,000 grant from the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility, \nwhich  will  be  used  for  the  engagement  of  consultants,  and  conduct  of  training  programs  and \nworkshops. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nThe  Shanxi  PMO  will  coordinate  with  the  city  and  town  PMOs  to  prepare  semiannual \n57. \nprogress  reports  indicating  progress  made,  problems  encountered  during  the  period  under \nreview,  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems,  proposed  program  of  activities,  and \nprogress  expected  in  the  coming  6  months.  The  implementing  agencies  will  keep  records  to \nallow  the  identification  of  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  following \naccounting  principles  and  practices  prescribed  by  the  Accounting  Law  of  the  PRC.  This  law \nrequires that the financial statements will generally follow recognized accounting standards. The \nimplementing  agencies  will  set  up  and  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records.  The \nfinancial  statements  of  the  project  accounts  and  the  annual  corporate  financial  statements  for \nimplementing agencies will be subject to external audit by the SPG audit bureau. The audits will \nbe carried out in accordance with PRC audit regulations and must meet ADB requirements. A \nseparate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure will \nbe  part  of  the  audit  reports.  The  implementing  agencies\u2019  annual  audited  financial  statements \nand audited project accounts will be submitted to ADB no later than 6 months after the end of \nthe fiscal year throughout the implementation period. SPG and the implementing agencies will \nsubmit reports and information to ADB on the use of the loan proceeds, project implementation, \nand  implementing  agency  performance.  These  reports  will  include  (i)  semiannual  progress \nreports  on  project  implementation,  (ii)  annual  reports,  and  (iii)  a  project  completion  report  not \nlater than 3 months after project completion. \n\n \n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n58. \nThe PPMS indicators, their relevance, and monitoring practicalities were discussed with \nthe  Shanxi  and  subproject  PMOs  and  implementing  agencies  during  project  preparation.  The \nindicators  are  based  on  the  monitoring  indicators  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework \nincluding  (i)  job  creation;  (ii)  service  level;  (iii)  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  district \nheating coverage, and other operating performance measures; (iv) water quality and incidence \nof  seasonal  flooding  in  rivers  in  subproject  towns;  (v)  public  satisfaction  with  the  urban \nenvironment; (vi) relevant social and economic data; (vii) traffic conditions in subproject towns; \n(viii)  air  pollution  reduction  indicators;  and  (ix)  increase  in  public  awareness  of  environmental \nprotection.  At  the  start  of  project  implementation,  the  Shanxi,  city,  and  town  PMOs  and \nimplementing  agencies,  with  the  loan  implementation  consultant\u2019s  assistance,  will  develop \ncomprehensive PPMS procedures to generate data systematically on the inputs and outputs of \nthe components, as well as the indicators to be used to measure the project impact. The PMOs \nwill (i) refine the PPMS by expanding it to include subsequent subprojects and adjusting for any \nchanges  in  the  city  master  plan,  (ii)  confirm  achievable  targets,  (iii)  finalize  monitoring  and \nrecording arrangements, and (iv) establish systems and procedures for the PPMS no later than \n6 months after loan effectiveness. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15 \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n59. \nIn addition to joint project reviews carried out at least once a year, ADB, SPG, and the \nimplementing agencies will undertake a comprehensive midterm review 2 years after the start of \nproject  implementation.  It  will  include  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation \narrangements, resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and progress on the agenda for \npolicy reform and capacity development measures. Feedback from the PPMS activities will be \nanalyzed. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n60. \nSocial  Aspects.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  creating  jobs  for \nexisting  residents  and  new  migrants  in  small  cities  and  towns  in  Shanxi  Province.  The  water \nsupply,  wastewater,  heating,  gas,  and  other  infrastructure  improvements  will  stimulate \ninvestment in industry; resource extraction; and the service sector, including tourism. During the \nconstruction phase alone, about 10,300 new jobs will be created in the core subproject towns. \nFollow-on multiplier effects are expected to create an additional 31,500 indirect jobs. About 70% \nof  construction  jobs  are  assumed  to  be  unskilled;  many  are  likely  to  be  filled  by  currently \nunemployed  people.  Since  the  unemployed  are  often  poor,  they  will  benefit  disproportionately \nfrom jobs created by the Project. Of the workers\u2019 wages, approximately CNY155.3 million will go \nback  to  the  local  economy.  During  operation,  the  core  subprojects  will  create  8,952  direct \nemployment  opportunities  and  another  22,050  jobs  indirectly,  corresponding  to  approximately \nCNY454.4  million  in  wages  per  year  and  indirect  benefits  of  CNY9.6  billion.  In  total, \napproximately CNY10.2 billion in benefits will be generated in Shanxi\u2019s small cities and towns. \nPoor people and women will be given priority access to new employment opportunities, and will \nbe  the  ultimate  beneficiaries  of  programs  provided  through  the  employment  training  center  in \nWutong. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11. The poverty and \nsocial  assessment  and  social  action  plan  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  L,  and  a  labor \nreemployment framework is in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \n61. \nThe Project will contribute to poverty reduction by reducing the incidence of waterborne \nand  respiratory  diseases.  Investments  in  improved  water  supply  and  wastewater  facilities  in \nYouyu county and Wutong town are expected to contribute to a decrease in medical expenses \nrelated to waterborne diseases of CNY23.5 million in Shanxi Province during 2012\u20132020. The \nshare of that reduction calculated as savings to households is CNY7.0 million. In addition, the \nincidence  of  respiratory  disease  is  anticipated  to  drop  in  Wutong,  where  the  town\u2019s  27,000 \nresidents will have the opportunity to move to a new housing area located upwind of the main \npolluting  industries.  Heat  and  gas  investments  will  result  in  the  discontinued  use  of  high-\npolluting individual coal-burning stoves and corresponding improvements to local air quality and \nrespiratory  health.  Women  and  children  will  particularly  benefit  from  reduced  time  burdens, \nimproved  health  and  household  environments,  and  programs  offered  through  education  and \nemployment  training  infrastructure.  Supplementary  Appendix  N  contains  the  health  impact \nanalysis of the Project. \n \n62. \nOnly 0.3% of the population of Shanxi Province belongs to ethnic minority groups. The \nfew ethnic minorities living in the core subproject areas (1,356 people) are not characterized by \nany  marked  difference  in  income  or  occupational  group  from  the  Han  majority.  The  project \ninvestments  will  raise  living  standards  and  generate  health  benefits  and  job  opportunities  for \nethnic minorities in each subproject area. Due to the requirement of the sector loan modality, an \nethnic  minority  development  framework  (Supplementary  Appendix  O)  was  prepared  for \nsubsequent subprojects. \n \nThe  core  subprojects  are  classified  as  category  A  for  resettlement.  Overall,  the  land \n63. \nacquisition and resettlement impacts of the Project are not excessive. The primary objective of \nthe land acquisition and resettlement program is to ensure that those affected will improve their \nstandard of living, or at least will not be made worse off because of the Project. Based on the \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nfor \n\nFinancial  Aspects.  A \n\nfinancial  analysis  was  done \n\nresettlement  impacts  identified  (physical  and  economic  displacement),  the  construction  of  the \nthree core subprojects in Shanxi Province will affect 1,453 households or 5,007 people. In total, \n97  hectares  will  be  acquired  permanently.  A  total  of  about  19,307  square  meters  of  built  area \n(residential and nonresidential structures) will be removed, causing relocation of 23 households \n(95  people)  and  affecting  22  enterprises,  one  shop,  and  one  institution.  The  three  core \nsubproject  governments  have  endorsed  and  disclosed  the  resettlement  plans  to  the  affected \npeople. The resettlement plans were posted in neighborhood committees and/or village offices \nand  uploaded  on  the  ADB  website  in  October  2008.  Appendix  12  provides  the  summary \nresettlement  plan  of  the  three  core  subprojects.  To  assess  the  resettlement  aspects  of \nsubsequent subprojects, a resettlement framework was prepared (Supplementary Appendix P).  \n \n64. \nthe  revenue-generating \ncomponents:  gas,  heating,  water,  and  wastewater.  Financial  sustainability  analysis  was \nundertaken for the nonrevenue-generating river improvements, roads, and education. Financial \nmanagement  assessments  were  made  of  SPG,  implementing  agencies,  and  operating \ncompanies. Appendix 13 provides a summary financial analysis, Supplementary Appendix Q the \ndetailed  financial  analysis,  and  Supplementary  Appendix  R  the  financial  management \nassessment. \n \n65. \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  in  constant  2008  prices,  computed  on  an \nafter-tax basis, is (i) for Wutong: 6.0% for the gas supply component, 7.3% for the heat supply \ncomponent,  and  5.0%  for  the  wastewater  component;  and  (ii)  for  Youyu:  6.6%  for  the  heat \ncomponent and 6.7% for the water supply component. The FIRRs compare favorably with the \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  in  real  terms  (after  tax)  of  1.2%.  The  sensitivity  analyses \ninclude  examination  of  the  risk  that  project  costs  will  increase  by  10%,  that  revenues  will \ndecrease by 10%, and that both costs and revenues will change adversely by 10%. The FIRR is \nabove the weighted average cost of capital threshold in each analysis.  \n \n66. \nSmall cities and towns in Shanxi have only recently started collecting tariffs for utilities. \nThe  Government  is  aware  of  the  need  to  gradually  increase  tariffs  to  cover  costs.  The \nsubproject governments are committed to increasing tariffs in phases taking into consideration \naffordability  for  consumers.  The  current  utility  tariffs  in  Wutong  need  to  increase  gradually  to \nachieve  full  cost  recovery,  i.e.,  to  cover  the  O&M  costs,  debt  service,  and  depreciation  of \nproposed  facilities.  During  the  first  year  of  operation,  tariffs  in  Wutong  will  cover  54%\u201388%  of \ncost;  and  full  cost-recovery  will  be  achieved  in  3\u20135  years.  The  Youyu  heating  component  will \nachieve full cost recovery after 2 years of operation, and the water supply component at start-up \nof  project  facilities.  The  Project  will  provide  capacity  development  on  tariff  reforms  and  tariff \nsetting.  \n \n67. \nThe  assessment  of  affordability  in  Wutong  shows  that  utility  costs  as  a  percentage  of \naverage household income are 1.0% for gas, 3.0% for heat, and less than 1.0% for wastewater. \nFor  Youyu,  they  are  1.0%  for  water  and  3.0%  for  heat.  The  results  of  the  household  survey \nindicate  that  these  rates  are  affordable.  The  expenditure  on  utility  costs  as  a  percentage  of \nincome  for  the  poor  is  relatively  higher  in  both  Wutong  and  Youyu.  Wutong  town  and  Youyu \ncounty have provided assurances that the subsidies now given to low-income families through \nthe minimum living standard scheme will continue. \n \nFinancial  sustainability  of  the  nonrevenue-generating  components  was  determined  by \n68. \nexamining  O&M  and  debt  service  costs  as  a  percentage  of  local  government  revenues.  The \nfinancial  capacity  of  local  governments  to  undertake  investments  was  assessed  by  comparing \nidentified financing sources with the annual funds required for the counterpart portion of capital \nexpenditures during subproject implementation. Forecasted debt service and O&M costs for the \nsubproject components represent less than 10% of revenues, indicating acceptable fiscal risk. \nDuring the peak project implementation period, counterpart funds for Wutong will not exceed 5% \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17 \n\nof local government revenue; the figure for Youyu is 2%. Therefore, the nonrevenue-generating \ncomponents are considered both financially sustainable and affordable.  \n \n69. \nThe results of the financial management assessment indicate that SPG has an adequate \nfinancial management system and experience in managing projects funded by foreign financial \ninstitutions.  The  implementing  agencies  operate  as  bureaus  or  departments  of  the  Project\u2019s \nlocal  governments.  The  accounting  and  financial  management  systems  for  financial  reporting \nand  accounting  are  developed,  and  are  adequate  for  the  purpose  of  loan  implementation. \nHowever, improvements to internal control might be required in the area of segregation of duties \nto  ensure  that  separate  individuals  handle  authorization,  recording,  and  custody  of  assets \nand/or  transactions.  Thus,  additional  staff  should  be  recruited  during  project  implementation. \nAudit arrangements are generally adequate and the implementing agencies will be required to \nsubmit  independently  audited  annual  financial  statements  and  project  accounts  to  ADB  as  a \nloan covenant. Each utility will be helped to establish a reliable financial management system at \nthe  beginning  of  project  implementation.  Each  utility  will  keep  accounts  in  accordance  with \ncommercial accounting principles and be subject to an independent external audit by a suitably \nqualified  firm  of  commercial  auditors.  Accounting  will  be  in  accordance  with  relevant  PRC \nstandards.  The  Project  includes  a  capacity  development  component  to  strengthen  financial \nmanagement. \n \n70. \nEconomic  Aspects.  The  selection  of  the  three  core  subprojects  was  based  on \nsocioeconomic  indicators  and  the  preparedness  to  undertake  investments  in  municipal \ninfrastructure.  Among  the  considerations  in  selecting  subprojects  is  the  availability  of  viable \ninvestment projects directly supporting approved development master plans and programs, and \nthe  potential  to  serve  as  models  in  the  preparation  of  subsequent  components  during  project \nimplementation.  Targeting  and  selection  of  subsequent  subproject  cities  and  towns  will  be \nbased,  among  other  factors,  on  their  potential  to  grow  economically  and  to  provide  jobs  to \nmigrants from rural areas. Employment growth is deemed to contribute more than output growth \nto SPG\u2019s goal of closing the rural\u2013urban income gap. \n \nKey  urbanization  issues  in  Shanxi  are  (i)  public  services  are  inadequate  to  meet  the \n71. \nneeds of the growing population, including roads for the growing number of cars in the province; \n(ii) severe  air,  river,  and  groundwater  pollution  are  resulting  from  intense  industrialization  and \nresource extraction undertaken in the province; (iii) a significant portion of the urban population \nlives below the poverty line; and (iv) holistic and integrated management of urban development \nis  lacking.  The  Project  aims  to  address  these  issues  in  participating  cities  to  help  promote \nbalanced  and  environmentally  sustainable  urbanization;  narrow  the  rural\u2013urban  gap;  and \nimprove production, employment, and living conditions.  \n \n72. \nThe economic analysis indicates that the core components are economically viable and \nthat  they  stand  up  to  sensitivity  tests  where  costs  increase  and  benefits  decrease.  The \neconomic internal rates of return for subproject components are 20.6% for the Caoxi road and \nassociated  municipal  services,  14.0%  for  Wutong  heat  supply,  16.9%  for  Wutong  gas  supply, \n13.8% for Wutong wastewater treatment, 16.7% for Youyu heat supply, 20.6% for Youyu water \nsupply, and 18.0% for Youyu roads. Appendix 14 provides a summary economic analysis and \nSupplementary Appendix S a detailed economic analysis.  \n \nEnvironmental Aspects. The Project is classified as environment category A. Extensive \n73. \npublic consultations involving surveys, meetings with stakeholders, and focus group discussions \nwere undertaken during project preparation. The project EIA is based on the results of the EIAs \nprepared  for  three  core  subprojects,  which  present  the  types  and  nature  of  subsequent \nsubprojects  under  the  Project.  An  SEIA  was  prepared  and  circulated  to  ADB\u2019s  Board  of \nDirectors, and posted on the ADB website on 20 October 2008. An environmental assessment \nand management framework for subsequent subprojects was also developed.  \n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nimpact  assessment \n\n74. \nThe Project is expected to generate substantial environmental benefits. Improved roads \nwill  reduce  travel  times  and  vehicle  emissions  per  trip,  thereby  helping  improve  air  quality. \nWater  supply  and  wastewater  treatment  will  reduce  the  discharge  of  pollutants  to  rivers  and \ngroundwater.  River  improvement  will  provide  flood  protection,  thereby  reducing  economic  loss \nand public health hazard due to flooding. District heating and gas supply will improve efficiency, \neliminate  a  considerable  number  of  small  and  inefficient  boilers,  reduce  the  quantity  of  coal \nused, and replace coal-burning stoves in individual dwelling units, thus reducing the emission of \ngreenhouse  gases.  This  Project  will  have  positive  effects  on  climate  change,  supporting  the \nPRC\u2019s climate change initiatives. \n \n75. \nAdverse  impacts  on  the  physical  and  natural  environment  during  the  construction  and \noperating  phases  of  the  Project  will  be  largely  insignificant,  given  strong  project  management \nand  implementation  of  recommended  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  environmental \nmanagement  plan.  The  plan  includes  institutional  strengthening  for  implementing  mitigation \nmeasures and undertaking monitoring requirements, and will be continuously developed as the \nProject progresses to provide more details so that all mitigation requirements are met. \n \nThe  subsequent  subprojects  under  this  sector  loan  are  required  to  meet  ADB\u2019s \n76. \nenvironmental \nrequirements.  An  environmental  assessment  and \nmanagement framework (Supplementary Appendix T) was prepared as an instruction manual to \nassist the Shanxi PMO, subproject PMOs, implementing agencies, and local design institutes in \npreparing  and  reviewing  EIA  reports  and  environmental  management  plans  for  subsequent \nsubprojects according to ADB requirements. It describes the environmental criteria for selecting \nand implementing subprojects, key environmental issues, conduct of the EIA, preparation of the \nEIA  reports,  and  review  procedures.  Training  was  provided  to  SPG  on  implementing  the \nenvironmental assessment and management framework. \n \n77. \nThe  Project  supports  climate  change  adaptation  including  (i)  incorporation  of  climate \nchange  issues,  such  as  energy  efficient  measures,  in  urban  master  plans;  (ii)  comprehensive \nwater management, such as long-term water availability forecasting for new development areas \nand  adopting  comprehensive  water  balance  measures  during  project  implementation;  (iii) \nsustainable  wastewater  and  solid  waste  management  including  sludge  digestion  and  biogas \nextraction;  (iv)  improved  urban  roads  management  and  reduced  pollution  from  cars  through \nimproved connectivity and better travel conditions; and (v) promotion of clean energy for more \nefficient central heating. \n \n78. \nProject  Risks  and  Mitigation  Measures.  The  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual \ntechnical  risks.  Conventional  engineering  designs  with  proven  records  of  reliable  performance \nwill  be  adopted  for  road  construction,  installation  of  municipal  services  along  roads,  water \nsupply, wastewater management, and heating. Mitigating measures will be put in place during \ndetailed  design  to  address  any  risks  associated  with  river  improvement  works  such  as  dams. \nDuring  implementation,  the  project  implementation  consultant  will  support  the  PMOs  and \nimplementing  agencies  to  ensure  that  equipment  and  works  comply  with  design  requirements \nand quality assurances. \n \n79. \nThe following risks could affect timely implementation, economic viability, and realization \nof  project  benefits:  (i)  failure  to  implement  institutional  strengthening  for  effective  project \nimplementation and management and governance; (ii) lack of proper O&M of project facilities; \n(iii)  major  amendments  and  changes  to  implementation  of  the  master  plans  in  the  subproject \ncities  and  towns;  (iv)  delay  in  the  provision  of  counterpart  funding;  (v)  failure  to  establish  or \nincrease  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  to  meet  cost  recovery  targets;  and  (vi)  unforeseen  land \nacquisition and resettlement issues, which could constrain the efficient implementation of project \nworks and restoration of livelihoods of those affected. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19 \n\n80. \nRisks (i) and (ii) will be mitigated through provision of institutional capacity development \nfor  the  subproject  city  and  town  PMOs  and  implementing  agencies  with  support  of  the  loan \nimplementation  consultant.  In  addition,  the  PLG  will  provide  oversight  to  mitigate  project \nmanagement  risk.  Risk  (iii)  will  be  mitigated  by  synchronizing  the  project  design  and \nimplementation  schedules  with  other  projects  planned.  Risks  (iv)  and  (v)  will  be  mitigated \nthrough  covenanted  assurances  from  the  subproject  city  and  town  governments  on  the \nprovision  of  counterpart  funding  and  on  regular  tariff  reviews  and  increases.

To  avoid  overburdening  large,  rapidly \nindustrializing cities, the PRC curbed migration for many years through the hukou system and at \nthe same time promoted the development of small cities and towns as alternative destinations \nfor  rural  migrants.  The  pro-town  development  policy  catalyzed  waves  of  migration  into  towns \nand  small  cities 1 throughout  the  1980s  and  1990s.  Today,  more  than  40%  of  the  national \npopulation lives in urban areas, up from 18% in 1978. As of 2002, almost 20,000 towns in the \ncountry had an average population of 32,300 and a total population of 640 million. \n \n2. \nThe  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP)  2006\u20132010  takes  advantage  of  the  potential  of  small \ncities  and  towns  to  increase  national  economic  productivity,  while  narrowing  the  urban\u2013rural \nincome gap, thereby contributing to social stability. The plan calls for strengthening physical and \neconomic  linkages  between  major  cities  in  metropolitan  areas  or  development  corridors  and \nsmaller settlements at their periphery.  \n \n3. \nSmall  cities  and  towns  in  Shanxi  Province  face  challenges  similar  to  those  of  other \nnorthern  provinces  in  the  PRC.  In  some  towns,  industrial  development  has  outstripped \ninfrastructure  provision,  resulting  in  environmental  degradation  and  suboptimal  conditions  for \nbusiness development. In other towns, the challenge remains attracting substantial investment \nthat  will  provide  employment  opportunities \nfuture  migrants. \nInfrastructure improvements can play a central role in both cases, by enabling economic activity \nand investment or by improving living conditions and the urban environment. \n \n4. \nShanxi\u2019s  policy  for  the  development  of  its  small  cities  and  towns  mirrors  the  national \npolicy.  The  Directives  on  Accelerating  Development  of  Small  Cities  and  Towns  in  Shanxi \nProvince identifies small cities and towns as growth engines for surrounding rural areas that can \nabsorb  rural  migrants  and  relieve  population  pressure  on  the  province\u2019s  large  cities.2 In  this \nrespect,  the  development  of  towns  and  county-level  cities  contributes  directly  to  the  provincial \nobjective of promoting integrated rural\u2013urban development.  \n \n5. \nThe national and Shanxi provincial policies on small cities and towns are in line with the \nrecommendations  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-funded  Town-Based  Urbanization \nStrategy Study in Liaoning and Shanxi provinces, and form the basis of the Project.3 Poor small \ncities  and  towns  in  Shanxi  need  to  develop  their  infrastructure  to  attract  investment  in  natural \nresource processing, manufacturing, and services. Other towns that have already achieved high \neconomic growth rates require improved infrastructure and services to improve living conditions \nand protect the natural environment.  \n \n \n\nto  current  residents  and \n\n                                                 \n1   \u201cSmall cities\u201d in the PRC are generally considered to have populations in the range of 100,000\u2013250,000. \n2  Shanxi Provincial Government. 2005.

The  study  concludes  that  the  overarching  factor  should  not  be  growth  of  production,  but  rather \ngrowth of employment, which will contribute more to the Government\u2019s goal of closing the rural\u2013urban income gap. \nThe  study  recommends  growing  both  cities  and  towns  by  facilitating  the  development  of  larger  urban \nagglomerations  made  up  of different  types  of  urban  settlements. The  study  proposes  that  key  towns  be  selected \nbased on their \u201cemployment rate of return,\u201d i.e., the number of jobs created per yuan invested by the provincial or \ncentral government. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nRoads and Associated Municipal Services \n\nWater Supply and Wastewater Management \n\nB. \n \n6. \nThe  Ministry  of  Transport  prepares  national  policies  and  plans  for  the  roads  and \nhighways  subsector.  The  provincial  transportation  departments  develop  the  provincial  road \nnetwork plan and are responsible for the planning, design, construction, and management of all \nroads in the plan, including national roads. In 2007 Shanxi had 2.5 million kilometers of roads, of \nwhich  85%  were  county,  township,  or  village  roads.  In  2007  the  national  government  budget \nprovided  about  13.5%  of  the  budget  for  roads,  while  provincial  and  local  governments \ncontributed about 34.2%. About 38% of funding was borrowed from the National Development \nBank and commercial banks against projected toll revenues.  \n \n7. \nLocal governments in high-growth towns are challenged to provide roads and associated \nservices  on  time  to  accommodate  the  need  for  industrial,  commercial,  and  residential \ndevelopment. Large cities increasingly rely on private developers to build local roads, and water \nand  wastewater  networks  in  subdivisions  and  other  planned  developments.  But  in  most  small \ncities  and  towns,  the  local  government  that  must  build  local  roads  to  establish  the  physical \nframework  for  future  growth.  This  is  essential  for  attracting  investment  in  industry  and \ncommerce, and for providing decent housing to current and future residents. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nThe  national  government  sets  policies,  standards,  and  guidelines  for  drinking  water \nquality; wastewater discharge; and planning and constructing water, wastewater, and drainage \ninfrastructure. Provincial agencies set policies, approve selected actions of municipal agencies \nsuch as tariff changes and large investment projects, and oversee compliance with water supply \nand  wastewater  standards.  Local  governments  provide  water  and  wastewater  services. \nTypically  municipalities  own  the  water  supply  company  and  have  a  government  bureau  for \ndrainage. Wastewater companies have only been established since 2000 and often focus only \non treatment, leaving the wastewater collection system to the government bureau.  \n \n9. \nFor wastewater, secondary treatment is a minimum requirement for all cities. The Shanxi \nHousing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau has an emerging policy to finance wastewater \ntreatment plant construction using provincial funds, while cities and towns will be responsible for \nconstruction of associated wastewater collection networks.4 Details about budget and schedule \nare under discussion. National policy calls for cities in water-short areas to aim for 20% reuse of \ntreated wastewater within the city or for industrial uses.  \n \nD.  \n \n10. \nThe PRC Environmental Science Institute estimates that per capita waste generation for \nsmall  cities  varies  from  1.0  to  1.3  kilograms/capita/day.  National  and  provincial  entities  set \npolicy,  prepare  guidelines,  and  allocate  some  resources  for  solid  waste  management.  The \nmunicipal  construction  bureau  is  responsible  for  design,  construction,  and  commissioning  of \nwaste  treatment  and  disposal  facilities  (e.g.,  landfills).  The  environmental  sanitation  bureau  is \nresponsible  for  waste  collection,  waste  transfer,  and  street  sweeping.  The  municipal \nenvironmental protection bureau handles industrial solid waste and hazardous waste including \nbiomedical waste from hospitals. Many small cities and towns have not established a user-pays \ntariff system; they finance solid waste collection and treatment through general revenues. \n \n\nSolid Waste Management \n\n                                                 \n4   Wang  Guozheng.  2008.  Working  Report  on  Shanxi  Province  Construction  Works.  Shanxi  Province  (text  of  a \nspeech  given  by  Wang  Guozheng,  Director,  Shanxi  Provincial  Construction  Bureau  (now  Shanxi  Provincial \nHousing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau, 9 April). \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nDistrict Heating \n\nRiver Improvement \n\nE. \n \n11. \nThe  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  is  responsible  for  management  of  water  resources, \nincluding river improvement and flood control. The flood control system emphasizes the use of \nstructural measures to reduce flood hazards. Many rivers are seasonal, and the channel beds in \nurban  areas  are  often  littered  with  solid  waste,  filled  with  sediment,  and  polluted  by  untreated \nwastewater. River improvement projects undertaken by local governments (construction bureau) \noften  reshape  the  river  channel,  build  embankments,  and  install  river-bank  landscaping.  The \nresult  provides  attractive  urban  open  space  and  provides  flood  control.  However,  continued \ndumping of solid and liquid waste into riverbeds can undermine the effectiveness of urban river \nimprovement projects. A more integrated approach to river improvement, wastewater treatment, \nand solid waste management is required. \n \nF. \n \n12. \nNorthern provinces in the PRC are replacing local coal-fired boilers by introducing district \nheating  systems  that  exploit  surplus  heat  generated  from  power  stations.  This  reduces  coal \nconsumption, emissions of greenhouse gases, and air pollution from particulates and coal dust \nused in small boilers and home heating devices. An integrated approach to district heating and \nnatural gas provision will maximize the positive impacts on air quality. \n \nThe PRC\u2019s district heating systems have been fixed flow systems using either steam or \n13. \nhot water. With fixed flow, heat supply cannot be automatically adjusted to actual demand; this \nresults  in  unsatisfactory  energy  efficiency.  Heat  customers  currently  pay  on  the  basis  of  how \nmany  square  meters  are  to  be  heated.  Heat  is  generally  provided  during  the  5  or  6  coldest \nmonths  of  the  year.  New  district  heating  systems  are  being  equipped  with  meters.  Existing \nsystems are expected to install such individual measuring equipment no later than 2010. \n \nG.  \n \n14. \nUpgrading  of  deteriorated  neighborhoods  in  Chinese  cities  is  generally  limited  to  old, \nhistoric districts with significant architectural or urban assets. Low-rise traditional neighborhoods \nare routinely demolished as part of city-center redevelopment schemes. While redevelopment of \nderelict housing is often a good option, some traditional housing can be preserved for economic, \nsocial, and historical reasons.  \n \n15. \nUpgrading of historic areas has tended to focus on building rehabilitation, however other \naspects  are  progressively  being  accorded  more  attention,  including  stakeholder  consultation, \ncost-sharing  mechanisms,  and  environmental  improvements.  Provincial  government  will \ncontinue  to  play  a  substantial  role  in  improving  the  quality  of  area  upgrading  projects  by \npreparing and disseminating guidelines that place greater emphasis on the social, resettlement, \nand environmental aspects of project design. \n \nH. \n \nThe  PRC  has  established  an  education  system  with  government  as  the  major  investor \n16. \nand  social  partners  as  coinvestors.  Local  government  is  playing  a  key  role  in  compulsory \neducation,  while  central  and  provincial  governments  are  dominant  in  higher  education.  In \noccupational  and  adult  education,  industrial  organizations,  businesses,  and  public  institutions \nmay be included. The major source of funds for education is government allocation.  \n \n17. \nThe  Shanxi  Province  11th  Five-Year  Plan  requires  that  compulsory  education  covers \n100% of the population, retains 95% of students at junior school, and ensures the entry rate of \nnursery school will reach 60%. The plan calls for of 1.64 million people to receive professional \ntraining, thereby helping towns adapt to changing labor market conditions. \n \n\nArea Upgrading \n\nEducation \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nPROCESS FOR SUBPROJECT IDENTIFICATION, SELECTION, PREPARATION, AND \nAPPRAISAL \n\n1. \nUnder  the  sector  loan  approach,  the  Shanxi  provincial  government  (SPG),  the \ndesignated  Executing  Agency,  established  a  three-stage  approach  for  (i)  identification  and \nselection,  (ii)  preparation,  and  (iii)  appraisal  of  subprojects  for  inclusion  in  the  Project.  These \nprocedures  are  currently  being  used  for  the  selection  and  preparation  of  subsequent \nsubprojects. SPG has delegated various actions and decisions for subproject processing to the \nShanxi  project  management  office  (PMO),  located  in  the  Shanxi  Housing  and  Urban-Rural \nDevelopment Bureau. \n \nA. \n \nSPG has invited county-level city and county governments in Shanxi Province to express \n2. \ntheir interest in participating in the Project to be partly financed by an Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) loan. The following criteria will be used to identify and select subprojects: \n \n\nStage 1: Subproject Identification and Selection \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  subproject  must  be  in  the  urban  development  sector,  i.e.,  related  to  the \nphysical  development  of  small  cities  and  towns,  with  particular  emphasis  on \ninfrastructure  development.  The  eligible  subsectors  for  subproject  investment \n(the  components)  are  roads  and  associated  municipal  services,  water  supply, \nwastewater  management,  river  improvement,  area  upgrading,  solid  waste \nmanagement, district heating, gas supply, area upgrading, and education.  \nThe proposed subproject city or town must be a county-level city or county, or a \ntown.  \nThe  subproject  must  improve  living  conditions  and/or  enable  employment \ngeneration, as follows: \n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(4) \n\nImprove  living  conditions  by  accomplishing  at  least  one  of  the  following: \n(1) remediating polluted areas in cities and towns; (2) lowering the rate of \n(or  slow  the  rate  of  increase  of)  pollution  of  water,  land,  and/or  air  in \nurban areas; (3) treating solid waste or wastewater prior to discharge into \nthe  natural  environment;  and/or \nincreasing  environmental \nsustainability  of  town  development  through  more  ecologically  sensitive \nsettlement patterns or infrastructure services. \nIncrease  employment  generation  by  accomplishing  at  least  one  of  the \nfollowing:  (1)  facilitating  investment  in  labor-intensive  economic  sectors \nincluding the service sector; (2) removing a specific infrastructure-related \nbarrier to growth of an economic sector in the city or town (i.e., enabling \neconomic  growth  through  infrastructure  service  provision);  (3) enabling \nthe  development  of  residential  and/or  mixed-use  areas  for  employees  of \nnew  or  expanding  businesses  (i.e.,  providing  roads  and  associated \nmunicipal services for urban expansion areas); (4) strengthening linkages \nof  city  and/or  town  economy  with  the  larger  metropolitan  or  subregional \neconomy  (including  growth  corridors  and  clusters);  and/or  (5)  increasing \naccess of the urban poor to economic opportunities. \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  local  government  must  confirm  its  ability  and  willingness  to  arrange \ncounterpart financing. \nThe  local  government  must  confirm  its  willingness  for  the  subproject  to  comply \nwith ADB safeguard policies and other requirements. \nImplementation must be during 2009\u20132015. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nStage 2: Subproject Preparation \n\nStage 3: Subproject Appraisal and Approval \n\nLocal governments can contract local design and other specialist institutes to carry out \n\nB. \n \n3. \nPreparation  by  local  governments  involves  designating  an  implementing  agency  (or \ninitially  an  office  of  the  government)  to  prepare  project  design  documents  including  a  project \nproposal and feasibility study report under the guidance of the Shanxi Development and Reform \nCommission (SDRC); with the help of the Shanxi PMO, an environmental impact assessment, \nand  (if  required)  a  resettlement  plan  to  standards  necessary  to  meet  both  domestic  and  ADB \nrequirements.  Governments  must  determine  suitable  institutional  arrangements  for  project \nimplementation and prepare a detailed financing plan. \n \n4. \nselected tasks involved in subproject preparation, including report production. \n \nTo  facilitate  an  orderly  and  consistent  appraisal  of  the  subprojects,  the  Shanxi  PMO \n5. \nrequires  preparation  of  an  integrated  feasibility  study  in  a  common  format  (to  ADB  standards) \nfor  each  proposed  subproject,  including  technical,  social,  financial,  economic,  and  institutional \nanalysis. \n \nD. \n \n6. \nThe  ADB  project  team  developed  a  detailed  set  of  evaluation  criteria,  which  was \ndiscussed  and  agreed  with  SPG.  This  is  to  ensure  that  appraisal  of  individual  subprojects  is \nconducted in accordance with ADB standards. The appraisal of the three core subprojects will \nalso serve as guidance for the appraisal of subsequent subprojects. \n \nEach subsequent subproject PMO will prepare a subproject appraisal report, which will \n7. \nfollow  the  template  provided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C  (which  also  shows  the  summary \nappraisal criteria), and submit it to the municipal finance bureau and municipal development and \nreform  commission  for  review  and  then  to  the  Shanxi  PMO  for  review.  The  Shanxi  PMO  will \nsubmit the appraisal report to the Shanxi Finance Bureau and SDRC for endorsement.  \n \n8. \nRejected  subprojects  are  to  be  referred  to  the  relevant  local  governments  with \nindications of where the preparations and proposals are deficient, and for additional preparation \nwork  (assuming  the  subprojects  have  a  realistic  chance  of  meeting  the  agreed  evaluation \ncriteria). \n \n9. \n \n10. \n \n\nSubprojects approved by SDRC will be forwarded to ADB for approval. \n\nAll subproject approvals by ADB or SPG will only be made if \n\nthe  subproject  includes  an  environmental  impact  assessment  which  has  been \nendorsed  by  the  Shanxi  Environmental  Protection  Bureau  and  ADB,  and  has \nbeen subject to relevant public consultation and disclosure; and \na  resettlement  plan,  meeting  ADB  requirements,  has  been  prepared  and \napproved by the relevant local government, and endorsed as satisfactory by ADB.

\n\nSUMMARY OF SUPPORT FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER UTILITIES \n\nObjectives \n\nA. \n \nTo  enhance  the  sustainability  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-financed  water \n1. \nsupply  and  wastewater  infrastructure,  the  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund  under  the  Water  Financing \nPartnership  Facility  will  provide  a  grant  to  be  used  to  strengthen  the  institutional  and  financial \nmanagement  capacity  of  the  entities  involved  in  planning,  financing,  implementing,  operating, \nand  maintaining  water  and  wastewater  systems  in  the  subproject  small  cities  and  towns.  This \nincludes  water  supply  and  wastewater  service  providers  participating  in  core  and  subsequent \nsubprojects. The assistance, to be administered by the Shanxi provincial government, will also \nfocus  on  improving  the  provincial  policy  and  regulatory  framework  for  these  providers  and, \nwhere appropriate, the national framework. \n \n2. \nThe  capacity  development  assistance  will  improve  the  ability  of  water  and  wastewater \nservice  providers  to  respond  to  ongoing  urbanization  challenges  by  enhancing  their  ability  to \ndeliver sustainable services. Specifically it will  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nhelp participating entities develop a comprehensive corporate strategy for water \nand  wastewater  service  provision  in  which  organization  structures,  personnel, \nand  systems  and  procedures  are  aligned  with  corporate  goals  and  objectives, \nincluding attracting private sector investment; \nidentify  appropriate  wastewater  treatment  technology  and  implementation  plans \nfor small towns of less than 20,000 population; \nadopt a demand-driven approach for service delivery, in which service levels and \ncoverage  for  water  and  wastewater  are  set  and  interventions  designed  in \nresponse to the expressed priorities and preferences of end users; and \nstrengthen financial management and cost recovery so that revenues cover costs \nto  the  extent  possible,  and  the  service  provider  is  able  to  meet  its  substantial \nfinancial obligations in an environment of rapidly expanding service provision. \n\nScope of Work \n\n \nB. \n \nThe team implementing the capacity development assistance will assess the institutional \n3. \nand  financial  capacity  of  the  designated  service  providers,  formulate  a  program  to  strengthen \ninstitutional  capacity  (including  training,  assistance  with  corporate  reform,  improvement  of \nadministrative  systems  and  procedures,  and  design  of  pilot  interventions),  and  assist  in \nimplementing  the  program.  The  team  will  coordinate  closely  with  the  provincial  project \nmanagement  office  (PMO)  and  work  closely  with  the  subproject  PMOs  and  implementing \nagencies.  The  Shanxi  provincial  government,  the  Executing  Agency,  will  be  responsible  for \nadministration of the grant and recruitment of consultants. \n \nC. \n \n4. \n \nD. \n \n5. \nInternational  consultants  will  comprise  an  operation  and  institutional  specialist,  and  a \nfinancial management specialist. National consultants will comprise a team leader and financial \nspecialist,  a  utility  accountant,  a  water  and  wastewater  pricing  specialist,  a  training  specialist, \nand a customer outreach specialist. \n\nThe work will be carried out over 36 months commencing January 2010. \n\nPeriod of Performance \n\nStaffing \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSUMMARY COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \n Table A6.1: Summary Cost Estimates \n\nForeign \nExchange \nCosts \n\nCNY million \nLocal \nCurrency \nCosts \n\n \n\nForeign \nExchange \nCosts \n\n$ million \nLocal \nCurrency  \nCosts \n\nTotal \nCosts \n\nTotal \nCosts \n\n% of Total \nCosts \n\nItem \nA.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nDepartment / \nDivision: \n \n\nEast Asia Department \nSocial Sectors Division \n\nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \n \nThe objectives of the Project are to promote balanced and environmentally sustainable urbanization; narrow the urban\u2013\nrural  gap;  and  improve  production,  employment,  and  living  conditions  in  small  cities  and  towns  in  Shanxi  Province. \nAlthough the Project will not reduce poverty directly, it will contribute in creating short- and long-term poverty reduction \nimpacts. It is consistent with the PRC national poverty reduction strategy for development of the northeastern region, \nwhich  aims  to  decrease  the  income  gap  between  urban  and  rural  residents. The  Project  is  consistent  with  the  water \npolicy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  which  states  that  people  must  have  access  to  safe  and  reliable  water \nsupplies.  It  will  help  the  PRC  achieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goal  (MDG)  7  (environmental  sustainability),  and \nspecifically  address  MDG  target  7.C  (to  halve  the  proportion  of  people  without  sustainable  access  to  safe  drinking \nwater and basic sanitation by 2015). The Project adheres to ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy in the PRC to make \nmarkets  work  more  efficiently  through  (i)  urban  infrastructure  development,  (ii)  promotion  of  environmental \nsustainability, and (iii) pro-poor equitable and inclusive growth. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  water  supply,  wastewater  collection  and  treatment,  heating  and  gas  systems,  river \nmanagement, roads, and associated services, which will in turn reduce surface and groundwater pollution, improve the \nenvironment and public health, and increase the quality of life of local residents. The Project will directly benefit about \n200,000  people  in  the  core  subproject  area  (about  10%  are  living  below  the  local  poverty  line)  and  about  400,000 \npeople  in  subsequent  subproject  areas.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  reducing  the  incidence  of \nwater- and airborne diseases and flood risk in small cities and towns, and providing employment opportunities during \nboth  construction  and  operation  of  project  facilities  with  anticipated  flow-on  effects  to  social  and  economic \ndevelopment. Specific anticipated benefits include the following:  \n(i)  Job  creation.  The  three  core  subprojects  will  create  about  10,300  jobs  during  construction.  Follow-on  multiplier \neffects are expected to create an additional 31,500 indirect jobs. About 70% of the construction jobs are assumed \nto be unskilled jobs and the poor will benefit disproportionately from jobs created by the Project. Those temporarily \nemployed  in  construction  will  benefit  from  additional  training  and  experience  that  will  provide  them  with \nopportunities \nto \nCNY155.3 million that  will return to the local economy. Subproject operations  will create 8,952 direct employment \nopportunities  and  another  22,050  indirect  jobs.  Indirect  impacts  on  job  creation  will  also  be  created  through  the \nemployment training center programs. \n\ninfrastructure  projects.  The  associated  wages \n\nfuture  planned \n\nfor  workers \n\ntranslate \n\nin \n\n(ii)  Health  benefits.  The  subprojects  are  expected  to  provide  clean  drinking  water  and  better  environmental \nconditions. As a result, the population exposed to water- and airborne diseases will be reduced, as will associated \nmedical costs. The number of schools days and workdays missed due to sickness will be reduced. The estimated \nreduction in medical expenses associated with the decrease in waterborne diseases in Shanxi during 2012\u20132020 is \nCNY23.5 million. The share of that reduction calculated as savings to households is CNY7.0 million. Benefits from \nimproved household environments are expected to particularly accrue to women and children, and will be magnified \nthrough implementation of the public education and awareness programs for hygiene and public health. \n\n(iii)  Flood  control. The  components  of  the  river  course  improvement  will  (i)  increase  flood  prevention  and  protection \ncapacity; (ii) reduce risk of flooding and corresponding flood damage; (iii) improve discharge capacity to meet the \nrequirement  of  flood  control;  and  (iv)  improve  the  water  environment  within  the  river.  In  Pingyao,  the  river \nimprovement  component  will  protect  Pingyao  ancient  city\u2014a  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural \nOrganization designated World Heritage site\u2014and safeguard the life and properties of at least 140,000 people. In \nYouyu,  the  river  channel  is  located  at  the  northern  part  of  Youyu  urban  area;  the  reconstruction  of  the  riverbed \nrunning east\u2013west through existing and new areas will increase the flood control capacity to the 50-year standard, \nwhich  may  result  in  protection  of  life  and  property  of  about  47,000  people.  In  addition,  the  poor  are \ndisproportionately affected by flooding either caused by extreme seasonal rainfall, which pools rather than draining \naway, or overflows from the sewer system. This is because the poor are more likely to live in floodprone areas and \nin dwelling units that are vulnerable to flooding. For subsequent subprojects, a poverty reduction and social strategy \nwill be prepared as part of the project appraisal report. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted Intervention (TI-M) \n\nB.   Poverty Analysis  \n \n1. Key Issues \n \nShanxi Province is located in northern PRC. In 2006 its population was 33.75 million with an average family size of 3.2. \nIn 2006, about 43% of the population lived in urban areas; this is expected to increase to 47% in 2010. Shanxi is the \nnational base for coal and coke, and manufacturing of industrial equipment and machinery. Some resource-based small \ncities  and  towns  in  the  province  have  made  substantial  progress  in  recent  years  in  facilitating  economic  growth, \nresulting in some harmful impacts on the environment. \n \nShanxi Province has relatively high rural poverty, compared to PRC average. Thirty-five of its 119 counties and county-\nlevel  cities  are  defined  as  national  impoverished  counties,  while  17  additional  counties  and  county-level  cities  are \ndefined as provincial impoverished counties.a Around 3,000 of its villages are defined as poverty villages, accounting for \nabout 2.0% of all the poverty villages in the PRC. The percentage of its population living in absolute poverty (i.e., those \nwith a per capita annual income of <CNY683) is 3.9%, compared with the national average of 2.5%. When the number \nof relative poor (i.e., those with a per capita annual income of <CNY944) is taken into account, the percentage of those \nliving in poverty rises to 12%, compared with a national average of 6.8% (Shanxi Province Statistical Yearbook, 2007). \nThe State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development proposed for interministerial review the \ndefinition of a new official rural poverty line of CNY1,300 per capita per annum.  \n \nIn 2006, the three core subproject counties had a total rural population of 684,761. Of the total rural population, 12.4% \nwere  living  below  the  old  poverty  line  of  CNY944/month,  almost  the  same  as  the  whole  of  Shanxi  Province.  If  the \nproposed new poverty line of CNY1,300/month is used, poverty incidence would increase to 14.9 %. Pingyao county \nhad a total rural population of 416,285, of which 10% was living under the old poverty line and 13.4% was living below \nthe new poverty line. Xiaoyi city, where Wutong town is located, had a total rural population of 206,900, of which 4.8% \nwas classified as poverty population under the old poverty line and 6% was living below the new poverty line. Youyu \ncounty, classified as a national impoverished county, had a total rural population of 61,576, of which 53.9% was living \nbelow the old poverty line and 61.7% was living below the new poverty line. \n \nUrban  areas  of  Shanxi  have  no  uniform  standard  poverty  line.  The  urban  poverty  line  in  the  three  core  subproject \ncounties  and  city  differed  slightly  from  CNY140\u2013CNY150  per  capita  per  month,  the  threshold  for  the  minimum  living \nstandard  scheme  subsidy.  Approximately  25,197  people  in  13,462  households,  or  7.3%  of  the  urban  population  will \nbenefit  from  this  subsidy.  The  urban  poverty  incidence  in  Pingyao  is  10.3%,  Wutong  3.2%,  and  Youyu  3.6%.  The \nsocioeconomic  survey  and  focus  group  discussions  indicate  that  most  of  the  poor  in  the  subproject  areas  are \nunemployed, disabled, and/or suffering from chronic illness. \n \n2. Design Features \n \nThe  project  design  addresses  social  dimensions,  i.e.,  the  poor,  public  participation,  gender,  and  ethnic  minorities.  At \nthe  same  time,  the  design  attempts  to  reduce  impacts  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Participation  strategies \ninclude a community-based public education and awareness program (PEAP) for hygiene and public health. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n \nA socioeconomic survey was undertaken with a sample of 603 randomly selected households. The poverty and social \nanalysis  identified  vulnerable  groups  and  opportunities  for  pro-poor  interventions;  and  recommended  social  action \nmeasures, participation plans, and mitigation plans to achieve positive social benefits. The analysis indicates that with \nrapid urbanization, public services in Shanxi cities and towns are inadequate and incapable of meeting the needs of a \ngrowing  population.  Air,  river,  and  groundwater  pollution  have  resulted  from  intense  industrialization  and  resource \nextraction undertaken in the province. The Project aims to address these issues and meet the demands of residents by \nimproving the water supply, wastewater collection and treatment, heating and gas, river management, and roads and \nassociated services. The main findings of the social analysis for the three core subprojects follows. \n \nPingyao county is located at the heart of a significant and growing cultural tourism corridor that includes a number of \nhistoric mansions as well as Gutao town, a large and well-preserved traditional Chinese town in Pingyao ancient city. \nWhile  tourism  is  growing  rapidly,  Pingyao  faces  significant  environmental  management  problems  due  to  proximity  of \nindustrial  facilities  and  inadequate  management  of  wastewater  and  solid  waste.  The  subproject  includes  the \nrehabilitation  of  Huiji  River,  which  will  improve  flood  control,  reduce  groundwater  pollution,  and  reduce  public  health \nrisks. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n47 \n\nWutong town is representative of dozens of towns across Shanxi that have experienced a massive economic boom as \na result of increased energy production (in particular, coal and coke). While Wutong\u2019s economic growth has increased \nexponentially since 2000, the town\u2019s ability to manage urban growth and its environmental consequences has not kept \npace.  Air,  ground,  and  water  pollution  are  all  severe.  Investment  in  environmental  infrastructure  is  critical  to  improve \nliving  conditions  for  residents  and  safeguard  the  natural  environment.  The  Project  calls  for  construction  of  basic \ninfrastructure that will connect the urbanized area of Wutong with the county seat, Xiaoyi city.  \n \nYouyu  is  located  in  northern  Shanxi  on  the  windward  side  of  the  main  coal-producing  areas  and  as  a  result  enjoys \nrelatively  good  air  quality.  The  county  proposes  to  leverage  its  environmental  quality  and  good  access  to  markets  to \nattract  investment  into  a  new  light  industrial  area  at  the  southwestern  edge  of  the  county  seat.  The  subproject  will \nenhance  and  sustain  urban  environmental  quality  for  the  entire  city.  The  combination  of  job  opportunities  and  good \nliving conditions is anticipated to attract rural migrants from villages in northern Shanxi into Youyu. Moreover, the new \nagroprocessing facilities will help tie regional farmers to the growing urban economy.  \n \nB.   Consultation and Participation \n \n1. The major stakeholders are (i) groups directly affected by the Project in a positive or negative way, including men, \nwomen, elderly, poor, minorities, schools, business and related organizations; and (ii) government organizations such \nas  SPG,  implementing  agencies,  Planning  and  Reform  Commission,  Civil  Affairs  Bureau,  Poverty  Alleviation  Office, \nWomen\u2019s Federation, Minority Affairs Office, Finance Bureau, Health Bureau, Labor and Social Security Bureau, and \nEnvironmental  Protection  Bureau.  Several  meetings  with  a  number  of  stakeholders,  especially  vulnerable  groups \nincluding women, poor, and ethic minorities in the project areas, were organized in the subproject towns. A number of \nkey informant interviews  were held  with various bureaus, nongovernment organizations, the women\u2019s federation, and \nrepresentatives of past and ongoing projects in complementary areas to inform them of the project design. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n\n Information sharing \n\n Consultation \n\n Collaborative decision making \n\n Empowerment \n\n No \n\n Yes \n\n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nPublic  disclosure  of  all  subproject  documents  will  be  made  at  the  project  management  office  (PMO)  and  on  the  ADB \nwebsite,  including  the  project  information  document,  design  and  monitoring  framework,  resettlement  plans,  summary \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  and  environmental  management  plan,  and  social  and  environmental  monitoring \nreports.  A  project  information  document  was  prepared  for  the  Project.  Booklets  outlining  the  resettlement  plans  were \ndistributed to affected households and disclosure meetings held. Copies of the booklet are available at the respective \nPMO and each affected village office. \n \nThe PEAP and training program will be conducted to promote hygiene education and traffic safety education, recycling \nprogram, and social acceptance of tariff increase. The following results are expected to be achieved through the PEAP: \n(i)  increased  participation  and  consultation  of  the  local  population  in  project  implementation  and  monitoring, \n(ii) increased  awareness  of  project  benefits  and  acceptance  of  the  Project,  (iii)  increased  hygiene  knowledge  and \nreduced incidence of water- and vectorborne diseases, (iv) increased traffic safety knowledge and reduced incidence of \ntraffic accidents, (v) increased participation of beneficiaries in garbage recycling as part of a solid waste management \nprogram, and (vi) increased environmental awareness on the part of business or enterprises. \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n \n1.   Key Issues \n \nIn  the  project-affected  area,  females  account  for  almost  50%  of  the  total  population  and  labor  force.  The  major  project \nbenefits targeted to women include (i) general benefits from economic development; (ii) improved housing conditions and \nliving environment from river upgrading and flood control; (iii) health benefits from improved water supply, gas supply, and \ndistrict heating supply; and (iv) job creation. Most of the project benefits accruing in the three subproject towns will benefit \nmen and women equally. The Project will have some added benefits for women, since women are primarily responsible for \ndrinking water collection, wastewater disposal, cleaning the interior and exterior of houses, nursing the children, and caring \nfor the sick and the elderly.  \n \n2.   Key Actions \n \nConstruction  projects  usually  provide  job  opportunities  for  women.  This  is  likely  to  be  an  additional  temporary  source  of \nincome that women can access. Furthermore, women\u2019s participation in the skilled operation and maintenance work to be \ngenerated, will not be constrained\u2014as evidenced by the number of women already working in these sectors and the equal \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nnumber  of  male  and  female  graduates  with  technical  qualifications.  The  PMOs  will  ensure  that  contractors  hire  female \nconstruction laborers and gender-disaggregated data will be monitored.  \n \nWomen  in  the  community  will  be  actively  engage  in  the  PEAP  promoting  hygiene  education,  garbage  recycling,  and \nacceptance of tariff increases. For the PEAP, the Project will work closely with local women\u2019s organizations such as the \nAll Chinese Women Association and women\u2019s street committees.  \n\nIII. SOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nIssue \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n\nBased on the resettlement impacts identified, \nthe construction of three core subprojects will \naffect 1,453 households or 5,007 people by \npermanent land acquisition; relocate 23 \nhouseholds or 95 people due to the \ndemolishment of residential structures; and \naffect 22 enterprises, one shop, and one \nagency with 1,178 employees. Three full \nresettlement plans were prepared. For \nsubsequent subprojects, a resettlement \nframework was prepared. \nOf the total beneficiary population of the three \ncore subproject towns, 1.5% are ethnic \nminority peoples, with Han constituting the \nlargest group. Due to the requirement of the \nsector loan modality and in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Operations Manual F3 on indigenous \npeoples, an ethnic minority development \nframework was prepared for subsequent \nsubprojects. \nThe Project will provide employment \nopportunities for the poor. Project assurances \nwill prioritize local labor, especially vulnerable \ngroups in job opportunities; and ensure \nemployment will comply with national labor \nlaws and regulations. For subsequent \nsubprojects, if the subprojects have an impact \non labor, a labor reemployment framework \nwas prepared. \nThe affordability analysis for public service \ncharges including water supply, wastewater \ntreatment, gas supply, and heating supply was \nassessed and no affordability issue was \nidentified for the nonpoor. For poor \nhouseholds, preferential policies or subsidy \nwill be provided to ensure they benefit from \npublic services. \n \nFor subsequent subprojects, affordability to \npay will be analyzed during subproject \nappraisal. \n\nHealth and safety training will be provided to \nconstruction workers. The PMO will ensure \nthat contractors involved in project \nimplementation disseminate information on the \nrisk of socially transmitted infections, including \nHIV to workers they employ under the Project. \n\n Full Plan \nShort Plan \n Resettlement \n\nFramework \n\n No Action \n\n Plan \nOther Action \n Ethnic People \n\nDevelopment Framework \n\nNo Action \n\n Plan \nOther Action \n No Action \n\nAction \n No Action \n\n Plan \n Other Action \n No Action \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\nLabor \n\nEmployment \nopportunities \nLabor \n\nretrenchment \n Core labor \n\nstandards \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\nAffordability \n\nNot significant \n\n Significant \n\nNone \n\nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n HIV/AIDS \n Human \ntrafficking \nOthers  \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\nIV.

The \n\nTo  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  local  officials  and  village  and \n\n \nThe  Project  includes  three  core  subprojects  and  subsequent  subprojects\u2014all  require \n1. \nresettlement  planning  and \nsome \nland  acquisition  and  population \nimplementation is designed to ensure that those affected will be better off, or at least not worse \noff,  as  a  result  of  the  Project.  Overall,  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  of  the \nProject will be significant. Three full resettlement plan reports were prepared for the three core \nsubprojects. \n \n2. \nThe  scope  of  the  project  impacts  is  mainly  determined  by  the  measurement  survey  on \nthe basis of the feasibility study reports. Based on the resettlement impacts identified (physical \nand  economic  displacement),  the  construction  of  the  three  core  subprojects  will  affect  1,453 \nhouseholds or 5,007 people because of permanent land acquisition; relocate 23 households or \n95  people  due  to  the  demolition  of  residential structures; and  affect  22  enterprises,  one  shop, \nand  one  government  agency  with  1,151  employees.  In  total,  96.6  hectares  will  be  acquired \npermanently, 57.6 hectares are cultivated land (Table A12). Along with land acquisition, 5,604 \nsquare  meters  (m2)  of  residential  houses  and  13,703  m2  of  nonresidential  houses  will  be \ndemolished, causing relocation of 23 households and 95 people, and affecting 22 enterprises, \none shop, and one agency. In addition, associated productive assets, ground attachments, and \nbasic infrastructure and facilities will be affected.  \n \n3. \nstreet committees were closely consulted during preliminary and final feasibility study stages.  \n \n4. \nThe  resettlement  plan  and  compensation  for  the  permanent  land  loss  is  based  on \nto  Deepen  Reform  and  Strictly  Enforce  Land \nDocument  28:  State  Council  Decision \nAdministration  in  October  2004;  Land  Administration  Law  of  PRC  (the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina) in 1998 and updated in 2004; Shanxi Provincial Government Decree on Shanxi Province \nCompensation  and  Distribution  Method  for  Land  Acquisition  of  Rural  Collectives  issued  on  17 \nOctober  2005;  and  Shanxi  Provincial  Government  193  Decree  on  Opinion  on  Land \nCompensation  for  Construction  Project  issued  in  December  2005.  The  resettlement  plan  and \ncompensation  for  house  demolition  is  based  on  the  PRC,  provincial,  and  municipal  urban \nhousing  demolishment  administration \nlocal \ngovernments  and  affected  people,  and  general  practice  in  Pingyao,  Xiaoyi  (where  Wutong  is \nlocated), and Youyu counties, the respective municipal project management offices (PMOs) and \nimplementing  agencies  adopted  a  set  of  compensation  standards.  The  resettlement  principles \nestablished  for  the  Project  are  (i)  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  should  be \navoided  or  minimized  where  feasible  by  developing  and  comparing  a  series  of  design \nalternatives;  (ii)  compensation  and  entitlements  provided  are  based  on  market  value  or \nreplacement value and must be adequate to allow those affected to at least maintain their pre-\nproject standard of living, with the prospect of improvement; (iii) land temporarily occupied and \nthe period for disruption are to be kept to a minimum; (iv) all people affected, legal and illegal, \nare  to  be  taken  into  consideration and  accounted  for;  (v)  the  per  capita  landholding  after  land \nacquisition  will  be  sufficient  to  maintain  the  previous  livelihood  standard;  (vi)  where  land \nallocation per capita is not sufficient to maintain the previous livelihood standards, other income-\ngenerating activities will be provided for; (vii) a preferential policy will be provided to vulnerable \ngroups  in  such  things  as  compensation,  payment  of  special  fund,  minimum  living  guarantee, \nand  employment;  (viii)  all  those  affected  will  be  adequately  informed  about  eligibility, \ncompensation rates and standards, livelihood and income restoration plans, and project timing; \nand  (ix)  close  monitoring  and  timely  actions  will  be  carried  out  to  identify  and  resolve  any \nproblems. \n \n\nregulations.

On various occasions during meetings, \ninterviews, focus group discussions, public consultation workshops, and community consultation \nmeetings,  local  representatives  have  participated  in  the  planning;  their  concerns  have  been \nintegrated into the resettlement plans. The resettlement information booklet for each subproject \nwas distributed to affected villages and households in August 2008. The resettlement plans will \nbe  provided  to  village  offices  and  resident  committees,  and  posted  on  the  ADB  website  after \ntheir approval. The respective project implementing agencies will establish project resettlement \nunits  for  supervising  implementation,  continuing  public  consultation,  monitoring  progress,  and \nresponding  to  grievances.  The  grievance  address  procedures  are  well  established  and \nexplanations are included in the resettlement information booklets. \n \n6. \nFor land acquisition, land compensation will be paid in cash to the affected villages to be \nused  as  basic  social  insurance  for  the  farmers  whose  land  is  newly  acquired.  Resettlement \nsubsidies and payment for standing crops will be paid to those affected. For residential houses \nand  nonresidential  buildings  (enterprises  and  shops)  to  be  demolished,  compensation  will  be \npaid  to  owners,  including  those  without  building  title.  The  payment  will  be  made  in  cash \naccording  to  the  appraised  value  of  the  property.  The  households  that  have  to  relocate  will \nreceive a relocation allowance. Compensation for standing crops, auxiliaries, and other assets \nwill be paid directly to those affected. Income losses resulting from reduced production, sales, \nand wages caused by the Project will be compensated in cash. \n \nThe resettlement strategy encompasses (i) replacement of housing and (ii) restoration of \n7. \nlivelihoods and income. People losing housing in rural areas have two compensation options: to \nreceive  cash  compensation,  or  cash  compensation  plus  provision  of  a  land  plot  for  house \nconstruction  (by  the  affected  person).  Assistance  will  be  provided  to  construct  new  houses  or \nfind  available  housing  close  to  the  original  homes,  when  preferred  by  those  affected.  The \nrespective  municipal  PMOs,  implementing  agencies,  and  local  governments  will  provide \nnecessary assistance for house construction and relocation during resettlement implementation. \n \n8. \ninclude  (i)  provision  of  employment \nopportunities  during  construction  and  operation  of  the  Project;  (ii)  provision  of  basic  social \ninsurance  to  those  affected  whose  land  is  newly  acquired;  (iii)  land  compensation  and \nresettlement subsidy deposited in banks for income earnings from interest; (iv) development of \neconomic crops with higher economic value; (v) promotion and development of new enterprises \nand  self-employed  secondary  and  tertiary  businesses  (i.e.,  small  business,  tofu  production, \ntransportation,  entertainment,  and  catering  services);  and  (vi)  provision  of  technical  training  to \nthose  affected  to  increase  their  marketable  skills.  Relocated  enterprises  and  shops  will  be \n\nfor  economic  rehabilitation \n\nThe  measures \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n51 \n\n \n\nprovided with the options of compensation and resettlement. The same shops will reemploy the \naffected employees. \n \n9. \nVulnerable  households  will  receive  additional  assistance  from  the  municipal  or  county \ncivil affairs bureau. The PMO and implementing agency will monitor implementation to ensure \nvulnerable persons receive adequate compensation, housing arrangements, special funds, and \nspecial assistance to restore their living conditions and incomes. \n \nEach PMO and implementing agency will have at least two full-time staff responsible for \n10. \nland acquisition and resettlement. The staff from each subproject resettlement unit will take the \nlead  responsibility  for  coordinating  the  planning,  implementation,  financing,  and  monitoring  of \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement.  They  will  work  closely  with  relevant  village  officials,  land \nadministration bureaus, and house demolishment offices; and will be responsible for supervision \nand  monitoring  of  resettlement  (e.g.,  delivery  of  entitlements,  selection  of  new  housing  sites, \nrestoration  of  incomes,  provision  of  replacement  land,  and  other  economic  measures).  A \ntraining program will be organized for the resettlement officers.  \n \nThe cost estimate for land acquisition and resettlement for the three core subprojects is \n11. \nabout  $18.0  million,  equivalent  to  CNY122.4  million  in  2008  prices,  including  contingencies. \nResettlement  implementation  will  be  completed  prior  to  subproject  construction.  Most \nresettlement activities will occur between March and June 2009. Detailed measurement surveys \nwill  be  conducted  in  each  village,  neighborhood,  house,  enterprise,  and  shop;  and  the \ncompensation contracts will be negotiated and signed with village committees, households, and \nenterprises.  Based  on  these  surveys,  the  resettlement  plans  will  be  updated  and  submitted  to \nADB for review and approval. \n \n12. \nInternal and external monitoring of resettlement plan implementation will be conducted. \nMonitoring  methodologies  are  specified  in  the  resettlement  plans.  Each  implementing  agency \nwill  be  responsible  for  internal  supervision  and  monitoring  to  ensure  compliance  with \nresettlement  plan  provisions.  The  PMO  and  implementing  agencies  have  agreed  to  a  set  of \nsupervision milestones with ADB to ensure timely and effective implementation of resettlement \nactivities.  External  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  carried  out  by  an  independent  agency \nunder  contract  to  the  PMO  and  implementing  agencies.  External  monitoring  reports  will  be \nforwarded directly to the Shanxi PMO and ADB. \n \n13. \nAs a sector loan, the Shanxi PMO is responsible for developing subsequent subprojects. \nA  resettlement  framework  (Supplementary  Appendix  P)  was  prepared  to  assist  the  local  and \nShanxi  PMOs.  The  framework  is  in  accordance  with  relevant  ADB  publications  and  provides \nprocedures for informing affected villages and households about the project scope and impacts, \nidentifying  affected  persons,  providing  compensation,  and  resolving  complaints.  The  PMOs \nhave stated their commitment to applying this framework. \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n\nRevenue-Generating Components \n\n1. \nThe  financial  analysis  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  Financial  Management  and Analysis  of Projects.1 The  financial  performance  of  Pingyao \ncounty government (PCG), Xiaoyi city government (XCG) (where Wutong town is located), and \nYouyu county government (YCG) was evaluated. Financial analysis was also undertaken for the \nrevenue-generating  components  in  each  subproject,  i.e.,  the  gas  supply,  heat  supply,  and \nwastewater  treatment  components  in  Wutong;  and  the  water  supply  and  heat  supply \ncomponents  in  Youyu.  A  financial  sustainability  analysis  was  carried  out  for  the  nonrevenue- \ngenerating  components:  (i)  river  upgrading  in  Pingyao;  (ii)  road  development  and  education \nservice facilities in Wutong; (iii) and river upgrading, road development, and drainage in Youyu. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nApproach  and  Methodology. The analysis examines revenue streams over 25 years, \nincluding  6  years  of  implementation,  and  compares  these  to  the  costs  of  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  and  debt  servicing.  Key  assumptions  were  made  for  the  applicable \ncomponent\u2019s operations, leading to a with- and without-project basis analysis. All analyses are \nbased  on  mid-2008  prices.  The  base-case  financial  internal rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is  compared \nwith the component\u2019s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) to determine financial viability. A \nsensitivity  analysis  assesses  the  impact  of  changes  in  cost  and  revenue  assumptions  on  the \nbase case FIRR. This therefore allows a conclusion on the financial sustainability of the project-\ncreated  assets  as  well  as  identification  of  necessary  measures  for  sustainability.  At  the  entity \nlevel, key ratios for profitability, debt service coverage, capital structure, and availability of cash \nfor sustainability are calculated. \n \n3. \nWeighted Average Cost of Capital. The WACC was calculated in real terms and after \ntax for each component. Funding sources are the ADB loan and counterpart funds from PCG, \nXCG, and YCG. The Ministry of Finance will relend the ADB loan to PCG, XCG, and YCG at the \nsame  rate  as  the  ADB  loan.  The  average  local  inflation  rate  is  5.1%  and  the  average \ninternational  inflation  rate  is  1.7%.  The  post-tax  WACC  is  1.2%  for  Wutong  gas,  heat,  and \nwastewater components; and the Youyu heat and water supply components.  \n \nTariffs.  The  tariffs2 are  anticipated  to  increase  gradually  to  full  cost  recovery  for  O&M, \n4. \ndepreciation,  and  debt  service  on  the  basis  that  the  Project  will  improve  service  delivery.  The \nGovernment agrees on the gradual tariff increase. During implementation, the weighted average \ntariff for wastewater treatment in Wutong is CNY1.10/m3 with 54% cost recovery;3 all operating \ncosts will be recovered during project implementation. Full cost recovery will be achieved after \nabout 5 years of operation with gradual tariff increase phased in. The weighted average tariff for \ngas in Wutong is CNY0.88/m3 with 75% cost recovery during project implementation. Full cost \nwill be recovered after 3 years of operation. The weighted average tariff for heating in Wutong is \nabout  CNY3.12/m2/month.  Full  cost  recovery  is  expected  to  be  achieved  within  1  year  of \noperations. The weighted average tariff for heating in Youyu is CNY3.17/m2 per month. Full cost \nrecovery  will  be  achieved  after  2  years  of  operations.  The  weighted  average  tariff  for  Youyu \nwater supply is CNY2.43/m3 during project implementation; full cost recovery is expected to be \nachieved when new facilities commence operation.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2005.

The base case FIRR for each project component is \npresented  in  Table  A13.3.  The  after-tax  FIRR  for  Wutong  gas  is  6.0%,  heat  7.3%,  and \nwastewater  treatment  5.0%;  and  for  Youyu  heat  6.6%  and  water  supply  6.7%.  The  results \ncompare favorably with the WACC of around 1.2%. A sensitivity analysis was conducted where \nthe  costs  were  increased  by  10%,  revenue  decreased  by  10%,  and  both  costs  and  revenues \nchanged adversely by 10%.

The assessment covered the Shanxi Provincial Government (SPG) \n(the Executing Agency) and the implementing agencies. \n \n17. \nThe financial management capability of SPG, as the Executing Agency, was found to be \nadequate  for  implementation  of  the  Project.  SPG  has  previous  experience  with  international \nfinancing  organizations  in  executing  projects  of  this  nature.  Some  training  in  ADB  financial \nmanagement and reporting procedures will, however, be required. \n \n18. \nAll implementing agencies have prescribed financial procedures that define duties of key \nfinance staff and procedures for record keeping and cash management. These procedures are \ngenerally  followed,  and  internal  controls  such  as  proper  authorization  of  transactions,  payroll \ncontrols,  and  regular  bank  reconciliations,  are  generally  adhered  to  although  improvements  to \ninternal control might be required in the area of segregation of duties. To address this, additional \nstaff should be recruited during project implementation. Some implementing agencies have not \nbeen  audited  on  a  regular  basis  and  SPG  and  the  implementing  agencies  have  agreed  that \nregular audit will be carried out by the Audit Bureau. Since this is the first ADB project that the \nimplementing  agencies  are  undertaking,  training  in  ADB  financial  management  and  reporting \nprocedures will be required. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n57 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nto  support \n\nthis  growth  and \n\nAnalysis of the Overall Project \n\nto  mitigate  negative  environmental \n\n \n1. \nThe economic analysis covers both the Project as a whole and the three individual core \nsubproject components. For the Project as a whole, the analysis covers the economic rationale \nfor  public  intervention,  the  goals  of  the  investment  plan,  and  the  general  design  of  the  plan, \nincluding selection criteria for subprojects. The economic analysis also evaluates the individual \ncore  subproject  components  for  least\u2013cost  and  benefit\u2013cost  analyses. Economic  analysis  was \nconducted in accordance with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Guidelines for the Economic \nAnalysis  of  Projects 1 and  Economic  Analysis  Retrospective  2005:  Strengthening  Quality-at-\nEntry of ADB Operations.2   \n \nA. \n \nRationale  for  Public  Intervention. The primary motivation for the Project results from \n2. \nincreasing concern over the inability of infrastructure provision to keep pace with population and \neconomic  growth  in  small  cities  and  towns  in  Shanxi  Province.  Due  to  strong  growth  of  the \nresource extraction and tourism sectors across the province, many towns are experiencing high \neconomic  growth  rates,  rising  household  incomes,  and  increased  use  of  private  cars.  At  the \nsame  time,  local  governments  have  not  been  able  to  provide  the  basic  urban  infrastructure \nneeded \nimpacts  of \nindustrialization  and  urbanization.  Roads,  water  supply,  wastewater,  solid  waste,  heating,  and \nother  services  lag  requirements.  Local  residents,  including  the  poor  and  other  vulnerable \ngroups, are bearing the cost of the deteriorating urban environment.  \n \n3. \nIndustrialization and intensive resource extraction are stressing the urban environment in \nShanxi  Province.  High  rates  of  air,  water,  and  land  pollution  in  many  areas  are  creating  a \nserious  threat  to  human  health  and  putting  downward  pressure  on  life  expectancy.  Traffic \ncongestion,  inadequate  potable  water  supplies,  and  inadequate  wastewater  collection  and \ntreatment  are  acute  problems  in  many  small  cities  and  towns.  In  the  absence  of  widespread \ncentralized  heating  and  natural  gas,  coal-burning  stoves  are  the  main  domestic  source  for \nheating  and  cooking.  Coal  dust  pollutes  the  air  and  causes  respiratory  disease.  Solid  waste \nmanagement  is  often  rudimentary  with  poor  environmental  protection.  Industrialization  and \npopulation growth through migration to urban areas has outstripped local government capacity \nto provide services. \n  \n4. \nThe  Project  involves  government  intervention  at  several  different  levels.  The  Shanxi \nprovincial  government  (SPG)  is  promoting  development  of  small  cities  and  towns  in  a  more \ncoordinated  and  cost-effective  manner  by  bringing  about  more  sustainable  investments  in \nphysical  and  environmental  protection  infrastructure  that  aims  to  improve  quality  of  life. \nInvolvement  of  SPG  is  justified  since  the  development  program  spans  several  small  cities, \ncounties,  and  towns.  The  city,  county,  and  town  governments  are  coordinating  and \nimplementing  the  elements  of  the  urban  transport  master  plans  and  making  individual \ninvestments in roads, water supply, heating, and environmental improvement including garbage \nand  solid  waste,  proper  drainage,  and  connection  of  households  to  the  wastewater  network. \nThey will be involved in owning and managing the completed facilities. \n \nGoals  of  the  Investment  Plan.  The Project is a direct response to SPG\u2019s 11th 5-Year \n5. \nPlan  2006\u20132010  to  promote  sustainable  economic  development  and  SPG\u2019s  policy  on  the \ndevelopment of its small cities and towns. The Directives on Accelerating Development of Small \nCities and Towns in Shanxi Province identifies small cities and towns as growth engines for the \nsurrounding  rural  areas  that  can  absorb  rural  migrants  and relieve  population  pressure  on  the \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1997.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f58   Appendix 14 \n\nfor \n\nThe  criteria \n\nprovince\u2019s  large  cities. 3 In  this  respect,  town  and  county-level  city  development  contributes \ndirectly  to  the  provincial  objective  of  promoting  integrated  rural\u2013urban  development.  The  11th \nFive-Year  Plan  recognizes  that  achievement  of  these  goals  will  require  improvement  of  the \nbasic municipal services and environmental quality in these areas. All components in the Project \nare  integral  components  of  the  five-year  plan.  County  governments  are  required  to  make \ninvestments  in  roads,  water  supply,  heating,  and  environmental  improvement.  The  small  city \nand  town  government  master  plans  are  reasonably  sound  and  are  integrated  with  the  overall \nplanning process. \n \nSelection  of  Subprojects  and  Core  Components.  The  selection  of  the  three  core \n6. \nsubprojects  was  based  on  socioeconomic  indicators  and  the  preparedness  to  undertake \ninvestments  in  municipal  infrastructure.  Among  the  considerations  is  the  availability  of  viable \ninvestment projects directly supporting approved development master plans and programs, and \nthe  potential  to  serve  as  models  in  the  preparation  of  subsequent  components  during  loan \nsector  implementation.  Targeting  and  selection  of  subsequent  key  subproject  cities  and  towns \nwill be based, among other factors, on their potential to grow economically and provide jobs to \nmigrants  from  rural  areas.  Employment  growth  is  deemed  to  contribute  more  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s goal of closing the rural\u2013urban income gap rather than the growth of production.  \n \n7. \nidentifying  and  selecting  subprojects  and  components  are  \n(i) confirmation by the participating local government of its ability and willingness to arrange for \ncounterpart  funding,  (ii)  confirmation  by  the  participating  local  government  of  its  willingness  to \ncomply  with  ADB  safeguard  policies  and  other  requirements,  (iii)  implementation  of  the \ncomponent  between  2009  and  2015,  (iv) eligibility  of  the  components  (the  sectors  must  be \nincluded  in  the  list  of  eligible  infrastructure  and  municipal  services),  (v)  anticipated  positive \nimpact on urban environment, (vi) anticipated positive impact on employment generation and/or \neconomic  growth,  and  (vii)  anticipated  positive  impact  on  coverage  or  service  level  of \ninfrastructure and municipal services. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nThe  demand  forecast  was  reviewed  for  components  that  used  benefit\u2013cost  analysis  to \ndetermine  reasonableness  of  the  proposed  designs.  These  components  include  gas  supply, \nheating,  roads  and  associated  municipal services,  water  supply,  and  wastewater  components. \nThe demand analysis for the road components in Wutong and Youyu were undertaken in terms \nof  (i)  selecting  and  defining  vehicle  types,  (ii)  assessing  annual  average  daily  traffic,  and  (iii) \nforecasting demand.  A  vehicle  fleet  consists  of  a  mix  of  several  vehicle  types  that  use  a  road \nnetwork (cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, and nonmotorized transport). Traffic counts that were \nconducted  on  the  proposed  road  component  served  as  the  basis  for  determining  average \nannual  daily  traffic.  To  establish  the  average  annual  daily  traffic  from  the  average  daily  traffic, \nseasonal  variations  were  assessed  taking  into  account  the  main  factors  for  changes  in  traffic \npatterns,  such  as  the  weather,  agricultural  cycles,  holiday  periods,  and  tourist  season.  In \nWutong, a traffic growth rate of 7% for 2009\u20132018 and 6% for 2019\u20132028 was used to forecast \ntraffic, while in Youyu an annual traffic growth rate of 10% was assumed.  \n \n9. \nFor the Youyu water supply component, the total water demand for the existing town and \nthe  new  district  is  estimated  at  15,580  m3/day.  The  Project  will  add  capacity  to  the  existing \nproduction  plant  and  install  the  pipe  network  necessary  to  serve  2020  demand.  With  this \ncapacity, the Project is estimated to serve 62,000 people or 21,000 households by 2020.  \n \n\nDemand Analysis \n\n                                                 \n3  Shanxi Provincial Government. 2005. Directives on Accelerating Development of Small Cities and Towns in Shanxi \n\nProvince. Shanxi Province.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n59 \n\n10. \nThe heat supply component of Wutong will provide heating supply for future residents of \nthe  planned  urban  expansion  area.  The  Project  will  construct  seven  heat  stations  with  a \ncombined  heat  capacity  of  57.75  megawatts  and  a  total  heating  area  of  1.05  million  square \nmeters (m2). The population of the Wutong new town is assumed to reach 10,000 by 2010 and \n30,000 by 2020. With an assumed residential dwelling floor area of 30 m2 per person, the total \nestimated residential dwelling floor area is calculated to be 0.900 million m2 in 2020. Industrial \nand  public  facility  floor  area  is  estimated  at  0.370  million  m2.  Thus,  the  total  estimated  heat \ndemand area is 1.275 million m2 in 2020. For Youyu, the heat supply component is designed for \nhouseholds and industries in the New West District and North Ring District, and is designed at \nproduction capacity in 2020. The New West District will be constructed and North Ring District \nwill  be  expanded.  By  2020,  the  total  heating  area  of  Youyu  is  estimated  to  increase  by  \n1.5 million m2, in which the existing heated area is 20,000 m2 and the coverage rate would be \n83%.  \n \n11. \nThe source for the Wutong gas supply component has daily gas production capacity of \n300,000  normal  cubic  meters  while  the  current  daily  demand  is  about  60,000  normal  cubic \nmeters. Given that the proposed project component is to provide energy for cooking and water \nheating for future residents of the planned urban expansion area of Wutong town, the remaining \nvolume  can  be  used  to  meet  the  demand  of  future  residents  of  Wutong  town.  The  Wutong \nwastewater component involves the  construction  of a wastewater treatment plant for domestic \nwastewater with a capacity of 4,000 m3/day and a sewerage network 12.3 kilometers long. The \ndesign capacity of the proposed treatment plant is based on domestic water consumption of 120 \nliters per capita per day, a return rate of 85%, and an unforeseen wastewater volume of 10% of \ndomestic  wastewater.  Actual  demand  would  reach  1,122  cubic  meters/day  in  2010  and  3,927 \ncubic meters/day in 2020. \n \nC.  \n \n12. \nThe  methods  of  economic  analysis  adopted  are  benefit\u2013cost  analysis  and  least-cost \nanalysis.  Benefit\u2013cost  analysis  was  mainly  applied  on  the  revenue-generating  components  of \nthe Project such as heating, water supply, and wastewater collection and treatment; while least-\ncost  analysis  was  applied  to  the  river  upgrading  component,  which  is not  revenue  generating. \nFor components that applied benefit\u2013cost analysis (specifically, water supply, wastewater, and \nsolid  waste),  estimates  of  economic  benefits  are  based  on  regression  outputs  from  the \ncontingent  valuation  survey  conducted  in  selected  pilot  areas  in  a  neighboring  province.  The \ncontingent  valuation  survey  aimed  at  eliciting  beneficiary  willingness  to  pay  for  improved \nservices  as  a  result  of  the  Project.  The  contingent  valuation  results  are  applied  using  specific \narea data such as income, education, age, type of dwelling, and other economic variables that \nare considered in the pilot areas in Wutong wastewater and Youyu water supply.  \n \n13. \nEconomic analysis of the project component was conducted over 25  years inclusive of \nproject  construction.  Economic  benefits  and  costs  are  denominated  in  terms  of  the  domestic \nprice numeraire and expressed in constant mid-2008 prices. International costs were converted \nto  local  currency  costs  using  an  exchange  rate  of  CNY6.8=$1.  Tradable  components  were \nadjusted to economic prices using a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.08 for effects of foreign \nexchange, and nontraded components were valued at domestic market prices. A shadow wage \nrate factor of 0.50 was used to convert the financial wage rate to an economic opportunity cost \nof labor. \n \nEconomic costs include (i) capital cost, including land acquisition and resettlement, and \n14. \nenvironmental mitigation and monitoring costs; and (ii) the costs of operation and maintenance \n(O&M),  including  the  costs  of  replacing  depreciated  equipment.  The  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement costs are estimated based on their opportunity costs, that is, the agricultural output \n\nEvaluation of Individual Components \n\n \n\n\f60   Appendix 14 \n\nforegone  and  the  re-siting  of  displaced  activities. 4  Transfer  payments,  including  taxes  and \ninterests,  are  excluded  from  the  economic  costs,  while  physical  contingencies  are  included. \nEconomic  benefits  quantified  include  (i)  roads  (savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs,  generated \ntraffic  benefits,  fewer  accidents,  savings  in  maintenance  costs,  cargo  and  passenger  time \nsavings); (ii) water supply and wastewater (contingent valuation to measure willingness to pay); \nand (iii) gas and heat supply (avoided air emissions caused by burning of coal, savings in fuel \ncosts due to substitution of coal for heating and cooking).  \n \n15. \nThe  economic  viability  of  each  component  is  determined  using  the  economic  internal \nrate  of  return  (EIRR)  as  the  principal  quantitative  measuring  tool.  The  EIRR  is  estimated  by \ncomparison  of  \u201cwith-component\u201d  and  \u201cwithout-component\u201d  scenarios.  A  core  subproject \ncomponent  is  considered  economically  viable  if  the  calculated  EIRR  is  higher  than  12%,  the \nsocial discount rate as prescribed by ADB. The base case EIRR is tested for responsiveness to \nchanges  in  the  values  of  key  project  variables  with  use  of  sensitivity  analysis.  The  following \nvariables  are  evaluated  for  their  impact  on  the  Project:  (i)  10%  increase  in  cost,  (ii)  10% \ndecrease in benefits, (iii) 10% increase in cost and 10% decrease in benefits, (iv) 20% increase \nin O&M, and (v) 1-year delay in benefits. \n \nD. \n \n16. \nThe economic analysis indicates that the core components are economically viable and \nthat  they  stand  up  to  sensitivity  tests  where  costs  increase  and  benefits  decrease.  The \nindividual component EIRRs are shown in Table A14 for Wutong (16.3%) and Youyu (18.4%), \nas  well  as  the  summary  of  the  results  of  the  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  by  component. \nThe economic analysis demonstrates the economic viability of the three components.  \n\nResults of Economic Analysis of Individual Components \n\n \nTable A14: Summary of Results for All Components \n\nProject Component  \nCaoxi Roads and Associated Municipal Services \nWutong Heat Supply \nWutong Gas Supply \nWutong Wastewater Treatment Plant \n\nTotal Wutong Subproject \n\n \nYouyu Heat Supply \nYouyu Water Supply \nYouyu Roads and Associated Municipal Services \nTotal Youyu Subproject \n\nResults of Analysis \nNPV \n(CNY million) \n\nMethod of \nEconomic \nAnalysis \nBCA \nBCA \nBCA \nCV/BCA \n \n \nBCA \nCV/BCA \nBCA \n\nEIRR (%) \n20.6 \n14.0 \n16.9 \n13.8 \n16.3 \n \n16.7 \n20.6 \n18.0 \n18.4 \n\n18.5 \n4.9 \n3.3 \n1.6 \n28.3 \n \n14.4 \n14.6 \n26.2 \n55.2 \n\nBCA = benefit  cost analysis,  CV = contingent valuation, EIRR = economic internal rate  of return, NPV = \nnet present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n\n                                                 \n4  The economic opportunity cost of land will be assumed to be equal to the replacement value of farmland calculated \n\nfor land compensation. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 17 November 2009) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "yuan (CNY) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "CNY1.00\n$1.00\n", "$0.1464 \nCNY6.8270 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nEIA \nEIRR \nFIRR \nICB \nLIBOR \nNCB \nNPV \nO&M \nPCG \nPLG \nPMO \nPRC \nPPMS \nQCBS \nSEIA \nSPG \nTA \nWACC \nXCG \nYCG \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nfinancial internal rate of return \ninternational competitive bidding \nLondon interbank offered rate \nnational competitive bidding \nnet present value \noperation and maintenance \nPingyao county government \nproject leading group \nproject management office \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nproject performance management system \nquality- and cost-based selection \nsummary environmental impact assessment \nShanxi provincial government \ntechnical assistance \nweighted average cost of capital \nXiaoyi city government \nYouyu county government \n", " \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "km \nkm2 \nm2 \nm3 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "kilometer \nsquare kilometer \nsquare meter \ncubic meter  \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n", " \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "C.
