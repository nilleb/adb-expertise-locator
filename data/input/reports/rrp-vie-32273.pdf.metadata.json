In order to meet this load growth, the \nGovernment  has  decided  to  construct  a  500-kilovolt  (kV) ring \nmain  transmission  system  around  the  major  load  centers  in  the \nnorth covering Hanoi, Haiphong, and Quang Ninh. The proposed \nsector project is part of this expansion program. The Project has \ntwo major components\u2014Part A: expansion and upgrading of the \n500 kV and 220 kV transmission systems, and Part B: upgrading \nand  expansion  of  the  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition \nsystem, plus communications facilities at the north, central, and \nsouth  regional  centers  and  the  national  load  dispatch  center \n(NLDC) in Hanoi. \n \nThe proposed project will strengthen the northern power system \nof  Viet  Nam  so  as  to  enable  power  transmission  with  adequate \nreliability  and  quality  from  new  plants  under  construction  and \nadditional  generating  capacity  programmed  over  the  next  5 \nyears.  Through  its  loan  covenants,  the  proposed  project  will \nfurther the ongoing power sector reforms to restructure Electricity \nof  Vietnam  (EVN)  and  thereby  create  a  profitable  and  viable \nelectricity supply industry in Viet Nam. \n \nThe  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i) directly  expand  and \nstrengthen  EVN\u2019s  transmission  system  in  the  north  to  improve \nsystem  reliability  and  quality,  and  (ii) indirectly  improve  the \nefficiency  of  the  power  sector  by  promoting  restructuring  and \ncommercialization  of  EVN.  ADB\u2019s  programmed  interventions  in \nthe sector during 2004\u20132007 will support the power sector reform \nefforts  aimed  at  establishing  a  \u201csingle-buyer\u201d  power  market \nstructure and transparent regulation of the sector by 2009. \n \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $273.6 million  inclusive  of \nphysical  and  price  contingencies  and \nfinancial  charges \ncomprising  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $174.6 million and local \ncurrency cost of $99.0 million equivalent. \n \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\n \n\niii \n\n($ million) \n% \n\n43.8 \n18.3 \n37.9 \n\n \n100 \n\nFinancing Source \n\nADB \nAFD \nEVN Counterpart \nFunding \n \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n119.7 \n50.0 \n4.9 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n0.3 \n \n98.7 \n\nTotal \n\n120.0 \n50.0 \n103.6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal Project Cost \n\n     174.6 \n\n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, \nEVN = Electricity of Vietnam. \nSource: Staff Appraisal. \n \n\n273.6 \n\n99.0 \n\nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  $120,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility.

For  each  subproject  not  yet \nappraised,  EVN  will  submit  an  appraisal  report  together  with  an \ninitial environmental examination report to ADB for approval. \n \nThe  Project  will  use  two  units  of  EVN  as  project  implementing \nagencies,  namely,  the  Northern  Power  Project  Management \nBoard  (NPPMB)  and  NLDC.  NPPMB  will  be  responsible  for \n500 kV and 220 kV substations and transmission lines upgrading \nand construction, and NLDC will be responsible for upgrading of \nthe  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  system, \ncommunication, and load dispatch facilities. \n \nElectricity of Vietnam \n \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \n\n\fiv \n\nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nfor \n\nconsultants \n\nresettlement \n\nto  assist  NLDC \n\nresettlement  plan.

The  Government  requested \nadvance  action  for  recruitment  of  consultants  to  minimize  front-\nend  delays  in  project  implementation.  ADB  approved  early \nrecruitment action, and informed the Government that this action \nwould not in any way commit ADB to finance the consultants. \n \nAdequate  supply  of  power \nindustry  and  commercial \nconsumers will enable expansion of these sectors and promote \noff-farm  employment  opportunities.  Off-farm  employment \nopportunities  will  enable  more  stable  income  sources  to  rural \nhouseholds.  Economic  growth  and  structural  change  of  the \neconomy  are  key  elements  in  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  to \nreduce poverty and to distribute the benefits of growth, including \ntargeting vulnerable areas and groups.

These  also \ninclude significant investments in new power generation capacity \nas  well  as  transmission  capacity  outside  the  scope  of  the \nproposed  Project.  The  mobilizing  of  these  investments  requires \nconcerted  efforts  by  EVN  and  other  public  sector  investors  as \nwell  as \nin  successfully \nimplementing  these  projects.  It  is  expected  that  EVN  and  the \nGovernment  will  create  the  enabling  environment  by  removing \nentry  barriers  for  private  sector  participation  (domestic  and \nforeign) through proposed power sector reforms. \n \nA key potential concern is the failure of the economy to continue \nachieving its assumed high economic growth rate of 7%. A lower \nrate  of  growth  would  reduce  the  rate  of  growth  in  electricity \ndemand. However, the analysis of risks shows that the economic \nviability  of  the  investment  program  can  withstand  extreme \nadverse  changes  in  anticipated  economic  growth,  and  in  other \nkey risk factors and assumptions. \n \n\n\fvii \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Northern Power Transmission Sector Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nPro-poor growth is a main component of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategy for \n2. \nreducing  income  poverty  according  to  the  Viet  Nam  Country  Strategy  and  Program  (CSP) \n(2002-2004).  The  CSP  endorsed  by  the  ADB  Board  in  January  2002  emphasized  the  role of \nprivate  sector  development,  agricultural  productivity,  financial  sector  reform,  and  small  and \nmedium  enterprise  development  to  achieve  such  growth.  The  Comprehensive  Poverty \nReduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS)1 of Viet Nam aims to combine high and sustainable \neconomic  growth  accompanied  by  targeted  measures  to  create  favorable  opportunities  for  the \npoor  to  improve  their  living  standards,  as  financed  through  the  redistribution  of  the  fruits  of \ngrowth. This approach has proven successful in the last decade. The rapid economic growth of \nover  7.5%  has  contributed  to  bringing  down  the  proportion  of  the  population  below  the \ninternational poverty line from 58% in 1993 to less than 29% in 2002; the CPRGS target is for a \nfurther reduction to 24% by 2010.  \n \n3. \nThe  critical  role  of  large-scale  infrastructure  in  achieving  poverty  reduction  through \ngrowth  is  underlined  in  a  new  chapter  of  the  CPRGS  approved  by  the  Prime  Minister  of  Viet \nNam  on  26  November  2003.  The  new  chapter  stresses  the  direct  and  indirect  impact  of \ninfrastructure bottlenecks, increasing efficiency, and generating the growth and employment that \nwill  directly  reduce  poverty  and  indirectly  allow  redistributive  programs  to  be  financed.  ADB  \nconsiders    ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  lending  to   Viet Nam  as a means of  meeting the \nsignificant  financing  gap  it  faces  in  the  infrastructure  sector.  The  2005-2006 Country Strategy \nand Program Update (CSPU) provided an initial response to these changed circumstances by \ndeveloping an expanded OCR lending program focused on the power and transport sectors.  \n \nThe power sector is a key sector for achieving the 7% average growth target up to 2010, \n4. \nwhich will require the share of the industry sector to increase from 37% in 2000 to 41% in 2010. \nThe  industry  and  services  sectors  are  expected  to  maintain  above  average  growth  rates  of \n10.5% and 8%, respectively, up to 2010 and this is forecast to result in a 13% growth rate over \nthe  same  period  in  demand  for  electricity.  As  electricity  is  an  underlying  input  for  economic \ngrowth  and  job  creation,  any  shortage  of  power  will  result  in  a  slowing  of  the  economy  and \nunderachievement in poverty reduction targets. \n \nAs a result of high sustainable economic growth and low initial consumption levels over \n5. \nthe last decade, the demand for power has been growing at an average rate of 14% per annum. \nAccording  to  the  Master  Plan  for  Power  Development  for  Viet  Nam,  2001\u20132010 (Fifth Master \nPlan),2  annual  investments  of  $1.2 billion  to  $1.5 billion  are  required  to  increase  electricity \nsupplies  sufficiently  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  projections. \n\n                                                 \n1   Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy, Government of Viet Nam, May 2002 \n2   Ministry of Industry, Government of Viet Nam, June 2000. \n\n\f2 \n\nThe Fifth Master Plan Adjustment File (MP5 AF)3 states that the total investment requirement of \nthe  power  sector  for  the  period  2002\u20132010  is  estimated  to  be  $19.1 billion,  consisting  of \n$11.8 billion  for  generation  and  $7.3 billion  for  transmission  and  distribution.  Given  the  huge \ninvestment  needs  of  the  sector,  it  is  envisaged  that  the  non-Electricity  of  Vietnam  (EVN) \ninvestments in the sector,4 including those from the private sector, will amount to $3.0 billion and \nthat these investments will be mainly in the generation sector. The investments to be mobilized \nby EVN would be $16.1 billion and the internal cash generation of EVN would contribute more \nthan  half  (i.e.,  $8.9 billion)  with  modest  tariff  increases.5  The  financing  gap  of  $7.2 billion  is \nexpected  to  be  filled  through  borrowings.  The  official  development  assistance  (ODA)  flows  to \nthe  sector  are  expected  to  be  $3 billion\u20133.5 billion  and  the  balance  would  be  sourced  from \ncommercial  borrowings.  The  domestic  banks  and  export  credit  agencies  are  financing  several \npower  generation  projects  and  this  trend  is  expected  to  continue  in  the  future as EVN\u2019s credit \nworthiness improves. \n \n6. \nRecognizing  its  fiscal  constraints  to  meet  all  investment  demands,  the  Government \nrequested assistance from ADB to upgrade its power transmission network in the northern part \nof  the  country.  The  Government\u2019s  request  was  included  in  the  1999  CSP  and  a  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)6  was  approved  in  2002.  An  ADB  appraisal  mission \nvisited Viet Nam in August 2004 and this report is based on the agreements reached during the \nmission. \n \n\n2. \n\nPower System \n\n \n7. \nEVN  has  the  legal  status  of  a  state  corporation  under  the  state  enterprise  law  and \nincludes  15  generation  companies,7  4  transmission  companies,  7  distribution  companies\u2014i.e., \nthe  \u201cpower  companies\u201d  (PCs)8  and  the  national  load  dispatch center (NLDC) as core member \nunits.  In  its  current  organizational  structure,  the  generation  and  transmission  companies  are \nclassified as dependent units of EVN, while the power companies are considered independent \nentities (i.e., quasi profit centers).  EVN  is  engaged  in  generation  and  transmission  (500 kV to \n110 kV).  The  seven  regionally  located  power  companies  purchase  bulk  power  from  EVN  and \ndistribute it at 35 kV and below. The Ministry of Industry is responsible for policy and oversight \nof the power  sector. EVN is vested with all operating and management responsibilities for the \npower sector. \n \n8. \nThe total electricity demand and the total electricity sales reached 7,366 megawatt (MW) \nand  34,841  gigawatt-hours  (GWh),  respectively  in  2003.  This  shows  a  marked  improvement \nduring  the  period  1995\u20132003  when  EVN  energy  sales  increased  by  more  than  threefold  (i.e., \n\n                                                 \n3   Ministry of Industry, Government of Viet Nam, October 2002. \n4   The bulk of these investments would be mobilized by other state-owned enterprises (SOEs) such as Vina Coal and \nPetro Vietnam (there are already more than 1,000 MW of thermal power plants financed by Vina Coal and Petro \nVietnam under construction). The private investments in the sector at present are limited to Phu My 2.2 and Phy \nMy 3 (i.e., total investment of approximately $1.0 billion) and the proposed sector reforms are expected to result in \nincreased private investment. \n\n5   Financial projections  of EVN, Appendix 8. \n6  ADB.  2002.

To meet the demand growth, EVN expects to have an installed capacity of \n20,583 MW by 2010 compared with 8,900 MW in 2003. \n \n9. \nPresently,  northern  Viet  Nam  accounts  for  approximately  37%  of  the  country\u2019s \ngeneration capacity and 39% of total electricity consumption. The electricity sales and the peak \ndemand in northern Viet Nam are expected to reach 30,766 GWh and 6,090 MW, respectively, \nby 2010 compared with 13,654 GWh and 3,154 MW in 2003. In order to meet this load growth, \nthe  Government  and  EVN  have  decided  to  construct  a  500 kV ring main transmission system \naround  the  major  load  centers  in  the  north,  covering  Hanoi,  Haiphong,  and  Quang  Ninh.  The \nproposed project is part of this expansion in the north. Similarly, load growth has also increased \nin  the  south,  and  the  Government  and  EVN  are  constructing  a  similar  500 kV  ring  main \ntransmission system around the major load centers of Ho Chi Minh City, Dong Nai, Binh Duong, \nand  Ba  Ria\u2013Vung  Tau  (parts  of  this  southern  transmission  system  is  also  being  financed  by \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation [JBIC] and World Bank). The north and south 500 kV \nnetworks  are  currently  connected  by  a  single  500  kV  line  but  a  second  500  kV  line  is  under \nconstruction to facilitate transfer of power between the two systems (Appendix 1). \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nGovernment Policies \n\n \nThe Government\u2019s power sector policy and reform objectives were first articulated in the \n10. \nPower Sector Policy Statement issued by the Ministry of Industry on 1 December 1995. In 1997, \nthe Government updated its Power Sector Policy Statement, outlining its objectives and strategy \nfor  the  development  of  the  power  sector.  In  October  2004,  the  Government  approved  a  new \nPower Sector Strategy (2004-2010).9 The policy objectives and reform strategy included in the \n2004  updated  statement  are  to  (i) provide  electricity  access  to  the  national  economy  and  the \nentire  population  of  Viet  Nam;  (ii) increase  the  operating/technical  efficiency  of  the  electricity \nsector  to  optimize  the  use  of  scarce  investment  resources ;  (iii) ensure  system  reliability  and \nquality of electricity supply; (iv) use country's primary energy sources such as hydropower, gas, \noil,  and  coal  for  power  generation;  (v) gradually establish competitive domestic power market \nand  encourage  investments  into  the  sector  from  non-EVN  entities  including  private  sector; \n(vi) promote regional power trading and cross-country transmission links; and (vii) set electricity \nprices at levels that promote investments in the sector. \n \n11. \nTo  help  achieve  these  policy  objectives,  the  2004  Power Sector  Strategy  outlined  a \nreform  strategy  that  included  developing  a  regulatory  framework,  adopting  cost-based tariffs, \npromoting  private  sector  participation  in  the  supply  of  power,  increasing  rural  access  to \nelectricity,  powergrids,  and  undertaking  demand-side  management.  The  Government\u2019s \nstructural  reform  objective  is  to  transform  the  power  sector  enterprises  into  efficient \ncommercially  run  entities  that  are  financially  strong  and  creditworthy,  and  have  management \nautonomy in their operations. The key strategy includes  (i) corporatizing the EVN-owned power \nplants,  (ii) developing  efficient  pricing  and  contractual  relationships  between  the  transmission \nnetwork  businesses  and  the  generation  stations  on  the  system,  (iii) converting  the  power \ncompanies (i.e., the seven distribution companies) into limited liability companies that have true \nfinancial  and  management  autonomy,  (iv) equitizing (i.e., partially  divesting)  power  plants  and \n\n                                                 \n9   Decision No. 176/2004 Q D-77G, Government of Viet Nam. \n\n\f4 \n\n2. \n\nselected units of power companies,  and  (v) converting EVN into a holding company to hold the \nGovernment\u2019s stake in the reformed power sector. \n \n12. \nThe objective of legal and regulatory reform in the strategy is to form a consistent legal \nframework to facilitate commercial operations and government oversight of the sector. The key \nsteps include (i) promulgating an Electricity Law; (ii) developing supporting secondary legislation \nto  the  Electricity  Law  to  address  (a)  the  scope  and  structure  of  the  regulatory  agency,  (b) \nprocedures  for  tariff  setting  and  regulation,  and  (c)  administrative  regulations  and  standards; \nand (iii) preparing a grid code for interconnection and operating standards between generation \nentities and the transmission entities. \n \n13. \nThe electricity pricing objective is to use cost-based principles to set retail prices so as to \nensure  financial  viability  and  promote  efficient  use  of  electricity,  and  efficient  internal  transfer \nprices to motivate the power companies to operate efficiently and purchase power economically. \nAlthough the prevailing average tariff is set at a level below the estimated long-run marginal cost, \nthe tariffs are adequate to meet the financial obligations of the sector and to generate cash flows \nto meet an adequate share of the new investments. However, with increasing financing needs of \nthe sector and expected returns on investments by private investors in the sector, the Government \nis  committed  to  undertaking  appropriate  measures,  including  tariff  adjustments,  to  ensure  the \nfinancial viability of the sector as captured by prudential financial covenants. It is expected that \nthrough these tariff adjustments, the tariff will eventually approach the long-run marginal cost. \n \n \n \nADB has approved a total of $186.3 million 10 in loans to the power sector of Viet Nam. \n14. \nThe loans were primarily for extensions and rehabilitation of existing medium- and low-voltage \nsubstations  and  distribution  networks  in  the  northern,  central,  and  southern  regions  of  the \ncountry. In addition, ADB provided $6.76 million in technical assistance (TA) for five PPTAs and \nsix  advisory  TAs  (Appendix  2).  The  more  recent  advisory  TAs  provided  support  for  the \nrestructuring  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  power  sector  and  the  PPTAs  supported  further  expansion  and \nrehabilitation of the subtransmission and distribution networks. ADB has also supported private \nsector  investment  in  power  generation  through  its  Private  Sector  Operations  Department.11 \nDirect loans and partial risk guarantees were provided for the Phu My 2.2 and Phu My 3 power \nprojects.  \n \nThe  other  major  funding  agencies  to  the  power  sector  are  JBIC,12  World  Bank,  and \n15. \nSwedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (Sida).  Since  1993,  JBIC  has \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 1972.

These funds were mainly for gas- and coal-fired \nthermal power plants, hydropower plants, and 500 kV transmission lines.13 JBIC is the biggest \nsingle  lender  for  the  development  of  the  power  sector  in  Viet  Nam.  The  World  Bank  has  also \nhad a strong presence since the early 1990s. It has provided loans for generation, transmission, \nand distribution. It has also provided TA in the following areas: power sector policy and strategy, \ninstitutional  strengthening,  demand-side  management,  and  renewable  energy.  Some  of  the \nassistance  included  TAs  for  Phu  My  2.2  build-operate-transfer  (BOT)  implementation, \ndevelopment  of  the  Electricity  Law,  and  promotion  of  rural  and  renewable  electrification. \nCumulatively,  the  World  Bank  has  committed  $919 million in loans to the power sector since \n1999. SIDA support for the  power  sector  began  in  1980s,  and  it  has  committed  a  cumulative \namount  of  $150 million  in  ODA  funds  (loans  and  TAs)  to  the  power  sector  in  Viet  Nam.  Other \nbilateral  sources  of  assistance  to  the  power  sector  include  Canada,  France,  Germany,  and \nUnited Kingdom. \n \n \n \n16. \nIn  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  energy  policy  and  overarching  goal  of  poverty  reduction, \nADB\u2019s strategy for the power sector of Viet Nam, as articulated in the 2004 CSPU (2005-2006), \nis to realize the following objectives: (i) ensure stable power supply for economic activity through \nfinancing  and  implementation  of  needed  power  sector  infrastructure  projects  including \ntransmission,  distribution,  and  generation  (hydroelectric  and  thermal).  Investments  in  power \ngeneration would complement private sector investments and would be structured in a manner \nto fill the investment gap in power generation after taking into account private sector capability \nor interest to meet the overall investment requirement of the  power sector; (ii) promote financial \nand  fiscal  sustainability  by  unbundling  EVN,  into  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution \ncompanies  that  can  operate  as  commercially  viable  and  financially  independent  entities; \n(iii) create  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  participation  in  a  competitive  power \nmarket in Viet Nam; (iv) encourage expansion of rural electrification subsystems and the use of \nrenewable energy sources for power generation; and (v) encourage the transfer of power in the \nGreater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  by  providing  assistance  to  Viet  Nam  to  improve  its  power \ntransmission infrastructure. The Private Sector Operations Department will continue to support \nthe mobilization of private resources to complement the public sector investments in the sector. \n \n17. \nTo date, ADB has concentrated on providing support to the Government through loans in \nthe transmission and distribution subsectors and TA to improve the commercialization, financial \nviability  through  tariff  reforms  and  sector  reforms  aimed  at  creating  a  competitive  market \nstructure  and  private  sector  participation.  The  2004  CSPU  (2005-2006)  includes  an  OCR \nlending program to support the power generation under the strategic parameters mentioned in \npara.  16.  The  TA  program  also  includes  support  to  specific  restructuring  activities  critical  for \nachieving  the  objectives  outlined  in  para.  16  and  to  support  the  successful  implementation  of \nproposed investment loans. \n \n \n \n18. \nADB has been engaging the Government and EVN in dialogue on power sector reform \nthrough its previous loans and TAs since 1995. As a result of this dialogue, Loan 1585-VIE(SF) \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n4. \n\n                                                 \n13 Thermal  power  projects  (i)  Phu  My  (\u00a561,932 million),  (ii)  O  Mon  (\u00a543,819 million),  and  (iii)  Pha  Lai \n(\u00a572,826 million);  hydropower  projects  (i)  Han  Thuan  (\u00a553,074 million),  (ii)  Da  Nhim  (\u00a57,000 million), and (iii) Dai \nNinh (\u00a543,819 million); and Phu My to Ho Chi Minh City 500kV transmission line (\u00a513,127 million). \n\n\f6 \n\ncontained  four  major  sector  reform  covenants.  The  covenants  included  (i) promulgation of the \nElectricity  Law,  (ii) preparing  secondary  laws  or  decrees  to  facilitate  implementation  of  the \nElectricity  Law,  (iii) establishing  an  independent  regulator,  and  (iv) ensuring  that  EVN  and  the \nfive  power  companies  (at  that  time)  undertake  steps  to  commercialize  their  operations  in  line \nwith  the  recommendations  of  TA  2345-VIE.14  Loan  1585-VIE(SF)  will  close  on  31  December \n2004  and  the  Government\u2019s  level  of  compliance  has  been  mixed.  This  is  due  to  high-profile \nfailures  and  design  flaws  of  restructured  and  competitive  power  markets  worldwide,  the \nGovernment  took  a  cautious  approach  and  spent  more  time  examining  the  most  appropriate \nstructure and way to proceed with the power sector reform. As a result, the Electricity Law was \nnot passed on the date covenanted. There has been more than 20 revisions and in May 2004 \nthe Law was finally submitted to the National Assembly for deliberation. The Electricity Law was \napproved on 10 November 2004. The provision for establishing the independent regulator was \nalso included in the Electricity Law and the decision for establishing the independent regulator \nwill  be  made  by  the  Prime  Minister  upon  promulgation  of  the  Electricity  Law.  In  addition,  the \nGovernment has directed EVN to begin the process of corporatizing and equitizing (i.e., partially \nprivatizing)  some  of  EVN\u2019s  operating  units  as  a  pilot  exercise.  Two  provincial  branches  of \nPC 1\u2014Ninh  Binh  Power  Utility  and  Hai  Duong  Power  Utility\u2014are  in  the  process  of  being \ntransformed  into  single-member  limited  liability  companies.15  The  Khanh  Hoa  Power  Utility (a \nprovincial branch of PC 3) is scheduled to be equitized16 in 2005. In addition, Can Tho thermal \npower station will be transformed into a single-member limited liability company by end 2004. \n \nThe recommendations of ADB TA 3763-VIE,17 as agreed with the Power Sector Reform \n19. \nCommittee, include  (i) unbundling  and  commercializing  EVN,  (ii) establishing tariff regulations \nfor a power market, (iii) creating a power market (\u201csingle-buyer\u201d model) by 2009, (iv) creating a \nwholesale power market by 2012, and (v) creating a retail competition market by 2018. The road \nmap for achieving these goals was developed under this TA (Supplementary Appendix E) and \nthe  Government  has  pledged  to  maintain  the  reform  momentum  begun  under  the  TA.  ADB, \ntogether with major lenders such as the World Bank and JBIC, are assisting the Government in \nEVN\u2019s  transition  through  bilateral  and  loan-associated  TA.  A  set  of  TAs  recommendation  with \ntime-bound action plan has been prepared for the Government and EVN (Appendix 3) by ADB \nTA 3763-VIE to be implemented with external assistance. The Government has requested ADB \nto coordinate in mobilizing such assistance to provide financial and/or technical assistance. The \npresent  loan  will  augment  and  enhance  previous  attempts  at  effective  sector  reform  through \nappropriately  set  loan  covenants.  Also,  during  the  implementation  of  the  present  loan,  further \ninterventions  (i.e.,  TA  grants  and  loans)  aimed  at  supporting  the  power sector reforms will be \nprovided. \n \n\n5. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \n20. \nIn  the  last  two  loans,  namely  1358-VIE(SF)  and  1585-VIE(SF),  covenants  aimed  at \nincreasing the retail electricity tariffs to approach long-run marginal costs for the entire system \nwere  included.  The  Government  had  great  difficulty  in  complying  with  these  covenants  as  it   \nbelieved  that  there  was  no  clear  justification  for  increasing  retail  tariffs  if  certain  financial \nperformance  ratios  (also  covenanted)  were  met.  During  the  midterm  review  for  Loan  1585-\n\n                                                 \n14 ADB.  1995.

Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Roadmap for Power Sector Reform . \n\nManila. \n\n\f7 \n\nVIE(SF), ADB verified that the self-financing and debt service coverage ratios were met by PC 2 \nand  PC 3,  the  two  executing  agencies  (EAs)  under  Loan  1585.  Although  the  covenant  on  the \nrate  of  return  on  assets  was  not  met,  EVN  was  still  generating sufficient cash to service debt \nand self-finance a reasonable portion of its capital expenditures. ADB and the World Bank have \nsince agreed that financial ratios, based on audited financial statements, which focus on internal \ncash  generation,  such  as  debt  service  coverage  and  self-financing  ratios,  that  also  indirectly \ncaptures  profitability,  should  be  used  to  set  the  average  tariff  level.  These  ratios  would  also \ncapture  the  financing  requirement  of  the  large  capital  expenditure  program  and  the  increased \nreturns  expected  by  the  private  investors  in  the  sector.  An  independent  \u201ccreditor\u2019s  model\u201d  is \nbeing  prepared  with  a  World  Bank  assistance  to  assess  the  financial  viability  of  EVN  and  to \nenable  the  lenders  to  assess  the  adequacy  of  the  tariffs  and  to  prescribe remedial measures \nshould  the  financial  viability  of  the  sector  come  under  stress.  As  part  of  the  \"creditor's  model\" \nwork,  World  Bank  is  also  assisting  EVN  with  a  tariff  study  that  would  address  distortions  and \ncross  subsidies  in  retail  tariff  structures.  The  model  has  been  completed  and  the  tariff  study \nwould  be  completed  in  early  2005.  This  would  then  assist  EVN  in  tariff  setting  to  ensure  that \nfinancial ratios are met. \n \n\n21. \nThe Government\u2019s approval process for project procurement, in particular, remains time \nconsuming  and  has  led  to  delays  in  project  implementation.  To  compensate  for  these  factors, \nthe  Project  has  undertaken  advance  procurement  action  and  project  management \nresponsibilities have been shared between two implementing agencies, the Northern Viet Nam \nPower Project Management Board (NPPMB) and NLDC to ensure smooth implementation. As \nthese two agencies are dependent units of EVN, as the EA for the Project EVN will monitor and \nmaintain oversight over project implementation. The Project will follow the sector loan approach \nand the Government has also agreed to take measures to expedite approval process for project \nprocurement. It is envisaged that the above measures will greatly reduce procurement time and \navoid the delays experienced in the previous two projects. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\nthe  subsequent  ADB \n\ninterventions  programmed  during \n\n22. \nThe  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i) directly  expand  and  strengthen  EVN\u2019s \ntransmission  system  in  the  north  to  improve  system  reliability  and  quality,  and  (ii) indirectly \nimprove the efficiency of the power sector by promoting restructuring and commercialization of \nthe \nEVN.  The  Project  and \nimplementation  period  of  the  Project  will  support  the  power  sector  reform  efforts  by  ensuring \nthat  EVN\u2019s  generation  units  are  corporatized/equitized  and  in  establishing  of  a  single-buyer \npower  market  with  transparent  regulation  of  the  sector  in  2009.  The  establishment  of  a \ntransparent regulatory mechanism would also improve the private sector investment climate. \n \n23. \nThe Government\u2019s sector policy and financing needs of the sector, and the capacity of \nEVN  to  implement  the  sector  development  program  have  been  assessed  and  found  to  be \nacceptable  and  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  sector  policy  and  ADB\u2019s  requirements  and  procedures \napplicable  to  sector  loans.  Although  the  Project  does  not  finance  any  sector  restructuring \nassistance  directly,  provisions  have  been  made  in  the  2004  CSPU  for  advisory  TA  in  2005  to \nimprove the capability of EVN in meeting the restructuring challenge that lies ahead of it. Hence, \nthe Project is structured as a sector loan consisting of two main components and a subset of \nabout 24 subprojects, half of which have been appraised and the other half are to be appraised \nduring the implementation phase. \n\n\f8 \n\n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nInfrastructure Component \n\n2. \n\nTechnical Justification and Criteria for Subproject Selection \n\n \n24. \nDue to the need to strengthen the northern transmission network to enable transmission \n(with adequate reliability and quality) of power from additional generating capacity programmed \nover the next 5 years, the Government has requested that the Project focus on  subprojects in \nthe  north  of  the  country.  These  subprojects  would  be  undertaken  during  a  5-year period from \n2005. The Project has two major components\u2014Part A: expansion and upgrading of the 500 kV \nand 220 kV transmission systems to transfer additional power to improve system reliability and \nenhance  the  efficient  utilization  of  existing  and  new  power  plants,  and  Part  B:  upgrading  and \nexpansion  of  the  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  (SCADA)  system  through  the \nprovision  of  remote  terminal  units  (RTUs)  for  substations  and  power  plants,  software  and \nhardware  upgrades  to  national  regional  load  dispatch  centers,  and  communications  facilities \nlinking three regional load dispatch centers (north, central, and south), and NLDC in Hanoi with \nthe  RTUs  in  substations  and  power  stations.  This  will  improve  load  dispatch,  system \nperformance, and system reliability. The candidate subprojects are described briefly in Appendix \n4. \n \n \n \n25. \nThe  justification  of  each  subproject  is  supported  by  load-flow  and  stability  studies, \nevaluation  of  alternatives,  detailed  design,  cost  estimates,  financial  and  economic  analyses, \nsummary initial examination of environmental and social issues, and implementation schedules. \nTwenty  four  subprojects  (out  of  a  total  number  of  410  candidate  500 kV  and  220 kV \ntransmission  subprojects)  were  selected  from  EVN's  Fifth  Master  Plan  for  support  under  this \nloan.  Subprojects  were  selected  on  the  basis  of  (i) technical  suitability  and  (ii) environmental \nconsiderations and social soundness conforming to relevant ADB guidelines. The financial and \neconomic internal rates of return (FIRR, EIRR) for individual subprojects were not calculated as \nthey  were  part  of  EVN's  overall  investment  over  the  period  2004\u20132010  for  which  a  detailed \nfinancial and economic analysis has been done. Since all the identified subprojects are based \non well-proven technology and are generally within EVN's implementation capability, there are \nno significant technical or engineering risks. The planning and implementation capability of EVN \nhas been reviewed and found to be satisfactory. \n \nTo  date,  12  subprojects  have  been  appraised  with  the  remaining  12  will  be  appraised \n26. \nduring implementation. The criteria for selection of the subprojects, and any other subproject not \nidentified at appraisal but still part of the Fifth Master Plan, or subsequent revision thereof, will \nrequire  EVN  to  produce  (i) a  technical  feasibility  study  for  each  subproject,  (ii) a resettlement \naction  plan  (RAP),  and  (iii) an  environment  assessment  plan  (EAP).  The  technical  feasibility \nstudy  will  include  a  detailed  engineering  design  of  the  subproject,  including  alternatives  and \nindication  that  this  is  the  least-cost  solution,  cost  estimates,  procurement  packaging,  and \nimplementation  schedule.  Further,  the  RAP  and  EAP  of  proposed  subprojects  must  meet  the \nrequirements of the Resettlement Framework (Supplementary Appendix B) and the criteria for \nenvironmental  requirements  as  given  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE).  For  each \nsubproject  to  be  appraised,  EVN  will  need  to  submit  an  appraisal  report  to  ADB  for  approval. \nAppendix  5  provides  the  format  for  submission  of  the  subproject  appraisal  report.  Proposed \nsubprojects  that  do  not  meet  the  above  requirements  will  not  be  approved  for  inclusion  in  the \nProject. \n \n\n\f9 \n\n3. \n\nResettlement \n\n \n \n27. \nThe  Project  will  require  land  acquisition  for  the  construction  and  extension  of \nsubstations,  and  of  any  necessary  access  roads  as  well  as  towers  and  foundations  for  the \ntransmission  lines.  For  the  first  batch  of    subprojects  appraised,it  was  identified  that  a  total  of \n901  households  (2,474  people)  will  be  affected  by  land  acquisition.  Of  these,  357  households \n(825  people)  will  be  severely  affected  and  544  households  (1,649  people)  will  be  marginally \naffected. Two hundred four households will have to move from their houses (but should be able \nto  rebuild  on  their  remaining  plot  of  land).  The  total  land  to  be  permanently  acquired  will  be \n243,493  hectares,  which  will  severely  affect  113  households  (104  losing  agricultural  land  and \nnine losing forestry land). Another 909,561 hectares of land will be acquired for temporary use \nduring  the  construction  phase.  Only  two  small  businesses  are  affected,  and  even  then,  only \nmarginally. Except for land required for towers, the land within the right-of-way can continue to \nbe  used  for  agricultural  purposes.  Compensation  for  all  lost  assets  will  be  provided  at \nreplacement  cost  at  current  market  value,  and  socioeconomic rehabilitation measures will be \nprovided to ensure that affected people will be at least as well off as they would have been in \nthe absence of the Project. The poorest affected and vulnerable affected people will be assisted \nto improve their socioeconomic status. \n \n28. \nA  RAP  has  been  prepared  for  the  following  project  components:  (i) construction  of \n151.59 km  of  500 kV  double-circuit  transmission  line  from  Quang  Ninh  to  Thuong  Tin, \n(ii) construction of one 500 kV substation at Quang Ninh and one 220 kV substation at Van Tri, \nand (iii) expansion of one 500 kV substation at Thuong Tinh in Ha Tay province and one 220 kV \nsubstation  at  Vat  Cach  in  Haiphong  province.  A  resettlement  policy  framework  has  been \nprepared to guide NPPMB in addressing resettlement issues related to those components and \nsubprojects  for  which  no  feasibility  study  has  yet  been  undertaken  but  which  are  expected  to \nform  part  of  the  Project.  The  Summary  Resettlement  Plan  and  Framework  is  attached  as \nAppendix  6  and  the  full  Resettlement  Action  Plan  and  Resettlement  Framework  are  in \nSupplementary Appendixes A and B, respectively. \n \n \n \nNPPMB staff assigned to the Project does not have adequate experience in involuntary \n29. \nresettlement.  NPPMB  and  its  local  consultants  will  be  assisted,  therefore,  to  strengthen  their \ncapacity  for  resettlement  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring.  An  international  and \ndomestic  resettlement  consultant  will  be  recruited  to  provide  formal  and  on-the-job  training \nduring  project  implementation  and  to  guide  and  supervise  preparation,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring of the RAPs. \n \nC. \n\nCapacity Building \n\nSpecial Features \n\n4. \n\n30. \nSince its creation in 1995, EVN's financial performance has been reasonable and it has \nconsistently  made  a  profit.  This  performance  has  mainly  been  attributed  to  the  operational \nefficiency  gains  EVN  has  achieved  coupled  with  the  rapid  expansion  of  the  Vietnamese \neconomy as a whole, resulting in a large increase in demand for electricity. Electricity demand \nhas increased at a faster rate than GDP, and EVN has taken advantage of this fact. However, in \norder  to  satisfy  future  demand  resulting  from  sustained  economic  growth,  EVN  will  need  to \nmake considerable investments in generation, transmission, and distribution. As it continues to \nincrease its indebtedness at a rapid pace, this rate of expansion could have a significant impact \non financial performance. \n \n\n\f10 \n\nDespite  its  ambitious  capital  expansion  program,  it  appears  EVN  can  maintain  its \n31. \nfinancial  viability,  provided  that  tariff  increases  are  implemented  as  projected  and  additional \nfinancial  income  from  equitization  is  realized.  Although  EVN  has  already  achieved  significant \nefficiency  improvements  (i.e.,  system  losses  at  12.8%  and  receivables  of  20  days),  it  is \nexpected that further gains will be realized, especially in unit cost of power generation, due to \nthe  introduction  of  competition  in  power  generation.  Financial  performance  covenants  have \nbeen  set  on  this  basis  to  ensure  financial  viability  while  at  the  same  time  providing  EVN  with \nenough  financial  flexibility  to  make  the  necessary  adjustments  in  the  short  term.  As  shown  in \nAppendix  7,  compliance  of  the  financial  covenants  is  projected  over  the  forecast  period. \nHowever, should additional income not materialize from equitization or revenue not grow in line \nwith these assumptions, further increases in retail tariffs may be required to maintain covenant \ncompliance.  \n \n32. \nEVN\u2019s competence as an EA has been demonstrated by its successful implementation \nof two World Bank loans and the two ADB loans, which has supported PC 1, PC 2, and PC 3. A \nsector loan is therefore considered appropriate to finance a portion of EVN\u2019s investments over \nthe  next  5  years.  Through  the  sector  loan  approach,  ADB  can  support  EVN  to  improve  power \nsystem performance and facilitate further sector reform. A sector loan approach will internalize \nthe  process  of  choosing  subprojects  that  meet  technical,  financial,  economic, environmental, \nand  social  criteria  appropriate  to  modernizing  the  power  subsector.  The  sector  loan  approach \nwill  also  provide  EVN  with  sufficient  flexibility  to  optimally  utilize  the  cofinancing  assistance \nprovided by Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD). \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n33. \nThe  Project  consists  of  two  main  components\u2014Part  A:  investments  in  500 kV  and \n220 kV transmission lines and Part B: upgrading of NLDC and associated facilities. The Project \ncomprises of about 24 subprojects (12 of which are still to be appraised). The cost estimates are \nexpressed  in  2004  prices  and  include  provisions  for  resettlement  expenses,  taxes  and  duties \n(i.e.,  for  appraised  subprojects),    and  interest  during  construction.  The  cost  estimates  are \nsummarized  in  Table  1  and  detailed  in  Appendix  8.  Due  to  the  sector  loan  approach,  the \ncontingencies  were  not  separately  estimated  for  the  subprojects  yet  to  be  appraised  and  the \ncontingencies of appraised subprojects are included in the cost estimates of these projects for \nboth  foreign  exchange  and  local  currency  expenses.  Interest  during  construction  is  calculated \nbased on the applicable long-term interest rates for relevant financing sources. \n \n\n\fTable 1: Cost Estimates  \n($ million) \n \n\nItem \n\nPart A: Transmission \n\nAppraised Subprojects \nAdditional Subprojects to be Appraised \n\n \nPart B: NLDC Upgrade \n \n\nResettlement Cost \nConsultancy Cost  \nTaxes and Duties \n\n \nBase Cost \n \nIDC \n \n\nTotal \n\n11 \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n91.9 \n41.7 \n \n21.1 \n \n0.0 \n0.4 \n0.0 \n \n155.1 \n \n19.5 \n \n174.6 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n \n37.2 \n17.4 \n \n3.2 \n \n13.3 \n4.5 \n12.6 \n \n88.2 \n \n10.8 \n \n99.0 \n\nTotal \n\n \n129.1 \n59.1 \n \n24.3 \n \n13.3 \n4.9 \n12.6 \n \n243.3 \n \n30.3 \n \n273.6 \n\n     IDC = interest during construction, NLDC = national load dispatch center. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n34. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $120,000,000  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital \nresources   to  help  finance  the  Project.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years;  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The Government \nhas  provided  ADB  with  (i) the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB's  LIBOR-based \nlending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii) an undertaking that these \nchoices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or \nadvice  from  ADB.  ADB  will  fund  68.5%  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  totaling  43.8%  of  the \nestimated  project  cost,  and  0.5%  of  the  local  currency  cost.  Also,  the  Government  has \nrequested  AFD18  to  provide  \u20ac40 million  (approximately  $50 million) cofinancing for the Project. \nThe  \u20ac40 million  loan  from  AFD  will represent  28.6%  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  or  18.3%  of \nthe overall cost of the Project. It will have a grace period of 5 years and a repayment period of \n15 years. The interest rate will be set at the 6-month European interbank offered rate (Euribor) \nwith the option of converting to a fixed rate. The Government will provide $4.9 million in foreign \nexchange  and  $98.7 million  equivalent  as  counterpart  financing,  which  accounts  for  37.9%  of \ntotal  costs.  This  includes  financing  civil  works,  taxes,  and  duties.  The  financing  plan  is \nsummarized in Table 2. \n \nThe ADB and AFD loans will be lent to the Government and then onlent to EVN at the \n35. \nADB\u2019s  interest  rate  applicable  to  OCR  loans  and at AFD's interest rate,  plus  an  onlending  fee \ncurrently at 0.2% per annum. EVN will assume the foreign exchange risk arising from ADB/AFD \nloans.  The  local  currency  expenses  not  financed  by  ADB/AFD  loans  will  be  financed  from \n                                                 \n18  Negotiations between AFD and the Government is ongoing and it is envisaged that financing from AFD would be in \n\nplace by end 2004. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nretained earnings of EVN and local currency borrowings from domestic banks.

The  Government  has  agreed  to  delegate  the \nauthority  for  approving  subprojects  to  EVN  and,  once  approved,  these  subprojects  would  be \nsubmitted to ADB for financing under the Project. Implementation of the Project for the 500 kV \nand  220 kV  substations  and  transmission  lines  will  be  the  responsibility  of  NPPMB,  and \nimplementation of the load dispatch facilities upgrade will be the responsibility of NLDC, in their \ncapacity  of  implementing  agencies.  Adequately  staffed  project  offices  have  already  been \nestablished  in  Hanoi  headquarters  of  NPPMB  and  NLDC  for  supervision  of  the  Project.  An \ninternational  consultant,  in  association  with  suitably  qualified  domestic  consultants,  will  assist \nNPPMB  with  resettlement  planning,  implementation,  and  internal  monitoring.  Supervision  of \ncontracts will be carried out by staff of the respective implementing agencies.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n37. \nProject  implementation  will  start  in  2004  with  the  recruitment  of  consultants.  Bid \ndocuments  for  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  packages  will  be  prepared  concurrently \nwith technical design to allow bid documents to be approved quickly. Delivery of equipment will \nbe  phased  to  suit  NPPMB\u2019s  and  NLDC\u2019s  storage  capacities  and  capability  of  erection \ncontractors.  The  Project  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  June  2009,  6  months  prior  to  the \nanticipated  loan  closing  of  December  2009.  The  implementation  schedule  is  shown  in \nAppendix 9. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n38. \nProcurement of goods and services for the Project will be carried out in accordance with \nthe  ADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Advance  action  for  procurement  of  equipment  was \nrequested by the Government and approved by ADB in the interest of early implementation of \nthe  Project.  The  Government  authorities  were  informed  that  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance \nprocurement action would not in any way commit ADB to approve the Project subsequently or to \nfinance  the  costs  incurred.  Supply  of  materials  and  services  to  be  proc ured from international \n\n\f13 \n\nsuppliers will be on the basis of ICB or international shopping (IS). Direct purchase procedures \nwill be authorized for  some  specialized items required for  the  Project.  Civil  works  and  locally \npurchased  goods  will  be  procured  through    local  competitive  bidding  procedures  and  EVN\u2019s \ncounterpart  funds  will  be  utilized  for  these  local  currency  expenses.  ADB  financing  will  be \nrestricted  to  goods  and  services  to  be  procured  through  ICB,  IS,  or  direct  purchase  from \nsuppliers. The materials required for the Project will be grouped into packages suitable for ICB. \nSupply  contracts  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $500,000,  if  any,  will  be  procured  using  IS \nprocedures. Supply contract packages estimated to cost less than $100,000 and standardized \nor critical items for the dispatch facilities, if any, will be procured following ADB direct purchase \nprocedures.  As  the  Project  will  be  cofinanced  with  AFD,  procurement  packages  relating  to \ngoods and services to be procured from international suppliers will be divided between ADB and \nAFD. AFD has agreed to the use of ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement for the packages that it \nwill finance (Appendix 10). \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nInternational  consultants  will  be  required  to  assist  NLDC in commissioning of SCADA \n39. \nand  telecommunications  equipment,  and  upgrading  of  associated  computer  hardware  and \nsoftware  at  load  dispatch  centers.  It  is  estimated  that  about  4  person-months of international \nconsultants will be required for this purpose. In addition, an international resettlement consultant \nwill  be  required  to  (i) assist  NPPMB  to  prepare  subproject  RAPs,  (ii) guide  and  supervise \nresettlement  committees,  and  (iii) train  NPPMB  and  resettlement  committees.  In  addition,  an \nindependent local resettlement monitoring consultant will be recruited to (i) conduct a baseline \neconomic  survey  on  a  representative  sample  of  project-affected  people  before  they  are \ndisplaced;  and  (ii) periodically  monitor  compliance  with  the  approved  RAP  by  meeting  with \nproject-affected people, resettlement committees, NPPMB, and other agencies as appropriate. \nIt is estimated that about 4 person-months of international consultants and 36 person-months of \ndomestic  consultants  will  be  required  for  this  purpose.  The  international  consultants  will  be \nrecruited  individually  by  EVN  or  NPPMB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants;  other  arrangements,  satisfactory  to  ADB,  will  be  used  for  the  selection  and \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  Government  requested  advance  action  for \nrecruitment  of  consultants  to  minimize  front-end  delays  in  project  implementation.  ADB \napproved  early  recruitment  action  and  informed  the  Government  that  this  action  would  not  in \nany way commit ADB to financing the consultants. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n40. \nDisbursements  under  the  Project  will  be  mainly  for  supply  of  goods  and  consulting \nservices.  Therefore,  ADB\u2019s  commitment  letter  and  direct  payment  procedures  will  be  used  for \ndisbursement purposes in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Based on the \nprocurement packages outlined in Appendix 10, no imprest account will be required for the ADB \nloan. AFD will be responsible for processing disbursements for the packages financed by AFD. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n41. \nEVN  will  prepare  regular  progress  reports  for  the  Project  and  submit  to  ADB  on  a \nquarterly  basis.  The  reports  will  include  a  description  of  physical  progress,  difficulties \nencountered,  and  a  summary  of  financial  accounts  for  the  Project that will consist of project \nexpenditures  during  the  period,  year  to  date,  and  total  to  date.  The  progress  reports  will  be \nsubmitted  to  ADB  within  1  month  of  the  end  of  each  quarter.  EVN  will  maintain  separate \naccounts  for  the  Project.  Within  6  months  of  the  close  of  the  financial  year,  EVN  will  submit \n\n\f14 \n\n(i) annual project accounts, and (ii) annual financial statements. The annual project accounts will \ncontain detailed descriptions of the sources of receipts and expenditures. The annual financial \nstatements  will  consist  of  an  income  statement,  balance  sheet,  statement  of  cash  flows,  and \nrelated  notes  to  the  financial  statements.  The  annual  financial  statements  will  be  consolidated \nfor  all  of  EVN\u2019s  operations.  The  financial  management  systems  and  procedures  of  EVN  and \nNPPMB (i.e., the implementing agency for Part A) were assessed and found to be satisfactory \nby  the  Mission  to  meet  ADB\u2019s  requirements.  The  findings  of  this  review  are  summarized  in \nSupplementary Appendix F. \n \n42. \nEVN will continue the current practice of hiring independent auditors to audit its annual \nfinancial  statements  and  annual  project  accounts,  together  with  the  memorandum  on  issues \nidentified during the audit process. These will be submitted with the respective reports. As part \nof the harmonization of procedures of external funding agencies, the standards to be followed in \nauditing  and  financial  standards  have  been  agreed  with  the  World  Bank.  For  future  contracts \nand  revisions,  the  auditors\u2019  terms  of  reference  will  be  provided  to  ADB. The accounts will be \nprepared  using  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards,  and  the  audit  will  be  carried  out \nusing International Standards of Auditing. The auditors will be required to provide an opinion on \nEVN\u2019s  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  covenants  and  indicate  the  details  of  the  actual \ncalculation  for  all  ratios,  in  conformity  with  the  definitions  contained  in  the  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n43. \nNPPMB and NLDC will prepare separate progress reports for their respective investment \ncomponents and submit them to ADB on a quarterly basis. The reports will provide a narrative \nof  progress  made  during  the  period,  changes  in  the  implementation  schedule,  problems  or \ndifficulties encountered, performance of the project implementation consultants, and the work to \nbe  carried  out  in  the  next  period.  The  progress  reports  will  also  include  a  summary  financial \naccount for the investment component, consisting of project expenditures during the period year \nto date, and total expenditure to date. ADB will review the implementation and operation of the \nProject  based  on  these  reports  and  meet  with  EVN,  NPPMB,  and  NLDC  and  the  Government \nsemiannually to discuss project progress. A project completion report will be submitted to ADB \nwithin  3  months  of  project  completion.  NPPMB  and  NLDC  will  carry  out  the  performance \nmonitoring.  Performance  will  be  evaluated  on  the  basis  of  performance  indicators/targets \nstipulated in the project framework (Appendix 11). \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n44. \nA midterm review to be carried out 2 to 3 years after loan effectiveness will focus on the \nengineering,  resettlement,  and  environment  aspects  of  the  Project,  and  review  the  financial \nstatus  of  EVN.  Representatives  of  ADB,  EVN,  and  the  cofinancier,  AFD,  will  take  part  in  the \nreview.  The  review  will  allow  for  any  necessary  midcourse  corrections  to  ensure  successful \nproject implementation and achievement of objectives. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\n45. \nThe  proposed  sector  loan  comprises  individual  subprojects,  including  a  500 kV \ntransmission  line  and  a  series  of  substations,  included  in  the  Government\u2019s  power  sector \ninvestment  program  to  meet  growing  electricity  demand  in  the  northern  region.  As  these \nindividual  subprojects  are  not  stand-alone  investments,  the  economic  and  financial  analyses \n\n\f15 \n\nwere  conducted  using  a  macro  time-slice  approach  for  the  entire  northern  region  investment \nprogram. The investment program analyzed the period 2004 to 2010 and is based on a least-\ncost expansion plan in generation and transmission. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nThe financial and economic viability was examined on the basis of comparing the costs \n46. \nand  benefits  of  meeting  demand  growth  by  the  investment  program  with  a  without-investment \nprogram  scenario  where  demand  would  not  be  met.  The  period  of  the  investment  program \ndefines all associated costs and benefits of meeting demand growth. The analysis runs out to \n2030 but with investments halting in 2010. The without-investments program scenario assumes \nthat  there  will  be  no  investments  in  the  north  beyond  2004  but  accounts  for  the  possibility  of \nmeeting  demand  beyond  2004  from  spare  capacity.  This  case  represents  the  costs  of  not \nimplementing the investment program and accounts for the subsequent impact on the system. \nThe without-investment scenario assumes that EVN will keep connecting consumers and meet \ndemand until it either runs out of generation capacity or puts stress on the transmission system. \nTo  determine  the  costs  associated  with  the  without-investment  case, Wien Automatic System \nPlanning (WASP) analysis was carried out for generation, and load-flow studies were conducted \nfor  the  transmission  system,  on  the  assumption  that  the  expansion  program  in  the  northern \nregion  would  be  frozen.  The  investment  program  for  the  central  and  southern  regions  is \nassumed  to  be  continued.  The  consequences  include  increased  operation  and  maintenance \ncosts, fuel cost increases as generation plants with a higher dispatch cost are forced to operate \nfor longer hours, and the economic costs of unserved energy for consumers. \n \nA. \n \nThe analysis was made over the period from 2004\u20132030 when power plants built during \n47. \n2004\u20132010  would  end  their  useful  economic  life.  The  financial  evaluation  of  the  investment \nprogram  was  undertaken  in  real  terms  using  constant  2004  prices.  The  cost  estimates  and \nfinancial projections in nominal terms were converted to real terms by adjusting for the projected \neffects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation  and  currency  fluctuations.  Incremental  costs  and \nbenefits attributable to the investment program were derived by evaluating the financial position \nof EVN under with- and without-project scenarios. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for \nthe  investment  program,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  is  12.8%.  This  compares  favorably \nwith  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  EVN  for  the  period  under  consideration, \nalso  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  of  6.9%.  When  discounted  at  WACC,  the  proposed \ninvestment program has a net present value (NPV) of D43.2 trillion. The investment program is \nconsidered both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity and risk analysis indicate that the \nFIRR  for  each  component  and  the  investment  program  overall  are  robust  under  adverse \nconditions. The analysis is explained in Appendix 12. \n \nB. \n \n48. \nThe  economic  viability  of  the  investment  program  was  analyzed  on  the  basis  of \nincremental costs and benefits as compared to the without-investment scenario. The economic \nbenefits of meeting incremental electricity demands were valued on the basis of willingness to \npay  and  end-consumer  tariffs  for  each  consumer  category.  A  conversion  factor  of  0.91  was \napplied to the consumer surplus to account for exchange rate distortions. The cost of unserved \nenergy  for  residential  poor  and  nonpoor  consumers  was  valued  in  terms  of  forgone  value  of \nleisure  resulting  from  the  load  shedding  that  would  occur  in  the  without-investment scenario. \nThe  cost  of  unserved  energy  for  nonresidential  consumers  was  evaluated  at  the  cost  of  self-\ngeneration.  Benefits  associated  with  increased  operation  and  maintenance  and  fuel  costs, \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n\f16 \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\nwhich  would  result  from  the  without-investment  case,  are  reflected  as  cost  reductions  for  the \ninvestment scenario.  \n \n49. \nIncremental  costs  of  the  investment  program  were  evaluated  in  terms  of  capital \nexpenditures in generation, load dispatch, transmission, and distribution to end-consumers and \nthe  cost  of  energy  purchase  from  independent  power  producers  (IPPs).  The  conversion factor \nwas  applied  to  nontraded  cost  elements  to  account  for  economic  distortions  in  the  local \neconomy. It is assumed that the connection of new consumers would remain part of government \npolicy and the connections would be the same in the with- and without-project cases, but with \npoorer quality of service.  \n \n50. \nThe  economic  analysis  is  summarized  in  Table  A13.3  of  Appendix  13.  All  costs  and \nbenefits  were  discounted  by  a  social  discount  factor  of  12%.  This  shows  that  the  investment \nprogram yields an EIRR of 40%. A sensitivity analysis was carried out with respect to key risks \nand  assumptions.  The  result  shows  that  the  investment  program  is  economically  worthwhile \neven  under  combined  extreme  adverse  conditions.  The  risk  analysis  shows  that  the  risk  of \nproject failure is negligible. \n \nC. \n \nThe  poverty  analysis  undertaken  for  the  Project  was  conducted  to  identify  issues  and \n51. \nassess impacts at the sector level, since it was difficult to identify specific end-consumers. The \nshare of households connected to the grid is 86% and the majority of the poor are connected. \nConnection  rates  in  the  project  areas  range  from  75%  to  95%.  These  high  connection  rates \nimply that investments made in transmission will have economy-wide and direct benefits to poor \nend-consumers in terms of improving quality both of supply and of electricity services. Improved \nquality of services will reduce the cost of repair and repurchase of appliances and improve the \nquality  of  lighting.  Increased  quality  of  supply  implies  substantial  welfare  impacts  for  poor \nhouseholds. From the overall economy perspective, these welfare impacts may be small (due to \nthe small consumption levels of the poor). However, from the household perspective a reduction \nin  electricity  expenditure  and  increased  value  of  leisure  are  substantial.  Reduced  electricity \nexpenditure releases household funds for food, health, and education expenditures. Most new \nresidential consumers are expected to be poor. \n \n52. \nThe  majority  of  benefits  to  the  poor  are  expected  to  take  place  through  increasing \ndemand for labor resulting from improved services to industrial and commercial sectors in urban \nand  semi-urban  areas.  Analysis  indicates  that  these  sectors  will  grow  substantially  in  the \nmedium term. Rem ittances from migrant labor will increase welfare and reduce vulnerability of \nrural households. The poverty analysis is provided in Appendix 14. \n \nD. \n \n53. \nThe Project will cause significant involuntary resettlement, including paddy land for  two \nsubstations  and  forestland  for  one,  and  houses  and  trees  that  must  be  removed  from  the \ntransmission line right-of-way. Impact has been minimized by routing the transmission line away \nfrom  built-up  areas.  Transmission  line  rights-of-way will be cleared  permanently of structures \nand  trees,  but  only  the  small  areas  under  each  tower  and  pole  will  be  permanently  acquired. \nThe rest of the right-of-way will remain the property of the current landowner, who will be able to \nmaintain its current use. Transmission line alignments determined during the feasibility study will \nbe  fine-tuned  during  detailed  design  and  finalized  during  project  implementation.  Adequate \n\nImpacts \n\n\f17 \n\ncompensation, relocation assistance, and income restoration measures have been designed to \nrestore lost incomes and living standards. \n \n54. \nApproximately  7%  of  the  population  surveyed  during  the  socioeconomic  survey  was \nfound  to  be  from  ethnic  minorities.  These  households  were  no  poorer  than  the  average \nhousehold in the project area and more often than not, they were found to be better off. They \nwere,  like  the  majority  of  the  population  in  this  area,  working  in  the  agriculture  sector  and \nappeared to be completely integrated into the life of the rest of their respective communities. Of \nthe  affected  households,  15  were  from  ethnic  minorities  and  they  all  live  in  Quang  Ninh \nprovince. The majority (12) lives in Uong Bi town and is from the Dao and Tay groups. A further \nthree households live in Thong Nhat commune and are from the San Diu group. The Project  is \nnot expected to have any effect specific to these groups other than land acquisition, which is to \nbe mitigated by the actions proposed in the RAP. In preparing for further subprojects, attention \nwill be given specifically to assess the impacts on any minority groups likely to be affected. \n \n55. \nThe  Project  has  been  assessed  as  environmental  category  B.  An  IEE  for  the  sample \nsubprojects  is  provided  as  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  A  separate  section  on  candidate \nsubproject  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures,  including  the  environmental \nselection criteria, is included in the IEE. The sample substations and transmission line will not \nbe  located  in  or  traverse  any  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  Unavoidable  impacts  entailed \nfrom  land  take  will  occur  at  the  two  new  substation  sites  but  the  anticipated  impacts  are \nconsidered  manageable  with  adequate  mitigation  measures.  The \nIEE  provides  an \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  to  reflect  best  practices,  which  will  ensure  that  the \nimpacts are adequately monitored and mitigated by the contractors. The EMP will be developed \nduring  the  detailed  design  phase  and  will  be  implemented  by  the  contractors  under  the \nsupervision  of  EVN  during  construction.  Institutional  arrangements  for  conducting  and \nmonitoring  the  EMP  are  also  provided  in  detail  in  the  IEE. A series of public consultations on \nproject-related  environmental  issues  have  been  carried  out  in  each  province  and  will  continue \ninto the implementation phase of the Project.  \n \nE. \n \nCompensation, resettlement, and income restoration measures may not be delivered as \n56. \nagreed,  thereby  impoverishing  affected  people  and  delaying  commencement  of  civil  works. \nNPPMB  will  have  specialists  to  assist  in  implementing  the  RAPs  and  NPPMB  will  engage  an \nindependent monitoring organization. \n \n57. \nThe  financial  and  economic  viability  of  the  proposed  project  depends  on  the \nimplementation of the other components of the power system\u2019s expansion in northern Viet Nam. \nThese include significant investments in new power generation capacity as well as transmission \ncapacity outside the scope of the proposed Project. This requires concerted efforts by EVN and \nother  public  sector  investors  as  well  as  the  private  sector  in  mobilizing  financing  and \nsuccessfully  implementing  these  projects.  It  is  expected  that  EVN  and  the  Government  will \ncreate  the  enabling  environment  by  removing  entry  barriers  for  third  parties  through  the \nproposed power sector reforms. \n \n58. \nThe  financial  projections  of  EVN  have  been  prepared  on  the  assumption  that  (i) \noperational  efficiency  gains,  (ii)  proceeds  from  equitization,  and  (iii)  tariff  increases  are \nimplemented  in  a  timely  manner  to  ensure  EVN\u2019s  compliance  with  prudential  financial \ncovenants.  If  the  underlying  assumptions  relating  to  fuel  cost,  cost  of  purchase  power  from \nIPPs, and shift in the consumer mix deteriorate from the assumed values, then the required tariff \n\nRisks \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nincreases  would  have  to  be  adjusted.  The  sensitivity  of  financial  ratios  used  as  financial \ncovenants  to  the  adverse  movements  of  these  assumptions  were  assessed  and  included  in \nAppendix  8.  This  is  especially  important  in  the  context  of  the  proposed  reforms  with  the \nintroduction  of  limited  competition  in  power  generation  under  a  single-buyer market structure. \nThe setting up of a regulatory body under the proposed Electricity Law with powers to set tariffs \non sound economic and financial grounds in a trans parent manner will significantly mitigate this \nrisk (Appendix 1). \n \nIt  has  been  assumed  that  there  will  be  significant  private  investments  both  in  new \n59. \nprojects  as  well  as  in  acquiring  EVN-owned  power  plants  (i.e.,  equitization).  The  financial \nproceeds from selling equity stakes also make a significant contribution to EVN\u2019s cash flows. As \nthe power market in Viet Nam is relatively underdeveloped, the private sector must be willing to \ntake the market and regulatory risks that may arise in such a market.  \n \n60. \nA key potential concern is the assumption of continued high economic growth of 7%. A \nlower  rate  of  growth  would  reduce  the  rate  of  growth  in  electricity  demand.  However,  the \nanalysis  of  risks  shows  that  economic  viability  of  the  investment program withstands extreme \nadverse changes in anticipated economic growth, and in other key risk factors and assumptions. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n61. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\nSector restructuring \n\n(a)  Within  6  months  after  the  effective  date  of  the  Electricity  Law,  the \nGovernment  will  promulgate  a  decree  or  regulation  establishing  a \nregulatory authority as envisaged under the Electricity Law. \n\n(c) \n\n(b)  Within  12  months  after  the  effective  date  of  the  Electricity  Law,  the \nGovernment  will  have  established  the  regulatory  authority  envisaged \nunder the Electricity Law. \nBy no later than 30 June 2009, the Government will have ensured that all \nEVN generation units have been corporatized such that each generation \nunit  either  (i) has  become  an  independent  unit,  including  independent \naccounting, or (ii) has become a single-member limited liability company, \nor (iii) has been equitized such that ownership is held by EVN and one or \nmore other investors. \n\n \nFinancial matters \n\n(ii) \n \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nCommencing 2005, EVN will achieve at all times a self-financing ratio of \nat  least  25%,  a  debt  service  coverage  ratio  of  at  least  1.5  times,  and  a \nlong-term debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30. \nThe  Government  will  take  all  necessary  measures  to  meet  the  financial \ncovenants in (a), including increasing tariffs as necessary. \n\n(iii) \n\nSocial and resettlement matters \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nNPPMB  will  have  resettlement  specialist  consultants  to  assist  in \nimplementing  the  RAPs  and  will  engage  an  independent  monitoring \norganization. The resettlement consultant and the independent monitoring \norganization  will  be  mobilized  before  commencement  of  any  land \nacquisition activities. \n(i) EVN or NPPMB will take all measures necessary in implementing the \napproved  updated  RAP  and  RAPs  to  be  prepared  for  subsequent \nsubprojects  in  accordance  with  the  approved  resettlement  framework. \nAny update of the RAP will be prepared in full consultation with affected \npeople  and  disclosed  to  the  affected  people  prior  to  submitting  to  ADB. \nThe approved updated RAP is required before implementation of the RAP \ncan commence. For the updated RAP, NPPMB will undertake a detailed \nmeasurement  survey  and  derive  updated  compensation  unit  rates  for  all \ncategories of losses and allowances. NPPMB will provide to ADB a final \ndatabase  of  affected  people,  a  summary  of  the  updated  detailed \nmeasurement  survey  data,  and  replacement  cost  tables  for  each \nsubproject.  The  updated  RAP  must  include  any  revisions  to  the \nentitlement  matrix;  such  revisions  are  limited  to  inclusion  of  new \nentitlements  to  address  impacts  not  previously  recognized.  The  updated \nRAP, incorporating the above will be submitted for approval by ADB. The \napproved updated RAP must be implemented to the satisfaction of ADB. \n(ii) If  at  any  time  after  the  approval  of  the  updated  RAP  significant \nrealignment of any part of any project component is required, NPPMB will \nrevise  and  update  the  RAP  for  that  component  to  take  into  account  the \nrealignment. The updated RAP must be submitted to ADB and approved \nby ADB before any land acquisition activities can begin for the realigned \ncomponent.  Significant \nthe  component \nalignment  is  moved  entirely  outside  the  construction  corridor  of  the \nprevious design over a distance of greater than 100 meters. NPPMB will \nensure that the RAP will be revised and updated in accordance with the \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. \nIf the subprojects for which the resettlement framework applies will cause \nresettlement  impacts,  NPPMB  will  prepare  an  RAP  for  each  subproject \nand  submit  it  to  ADB  for  approval.  The  RAPs  will  be  prepared  following \ncompletion  of  detailed  design  and  approved  by  ADB  prior  to  the  start  of \nland  acquisition  activities.  These  RAPs  will  consist  of  detailed \nmeasurement  survey  findings,  compensation unit rates for all categories \nof  losses  and  allowances,  budgeting,  and  a  final  database  of  affected \npeople. EVN will ensure that civil works contractors will not be issued with \na notice of possession of site for any section of construction works unless \nNPPMB has (i) satisfactorily completed, in accordance with the approved \nupdated  RAP  for  that  subproject,  compensation  payment  and  relocation \nto new sites, and (ii) ensured that the rehabilitation assistance is in place \nand the area required for civil works is free of all encumbrances. \nContractors  will  not  differentiate  wages  between  men  and  women  for \nwork  of  equal  type.  Child  labor  is  not  permitted  in  the  Project\u2019s \nconstruction activities and camps. \nNPPMB will make satisfactory arrangements for timely acquisition of land, \ntaking the measures necessary to implement all RAPs for the Project to \nthe  satisfaction  of  ADB,  including  (i) full  implementation  of  specific \n\nrealignment  occurs  when \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nprovisions for ethnic minorities, if required; and (ii) provision of adequate \ncounterpart funding to cover actual costs. \n\n \n(iv) \n\nEnvironment matters \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nthen \n\nthese  discrepancies  will  be \n\nFor  each  subproject,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  EVN  prepares  an \nenvironmental  assessment  for  each  candidate  subproject,  meeting  the \nrequirements  of  the  IEE  and  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review \nprocedures, for submission for ADB approval prior to subproject approval. \nThe Government will ensure that the Government\u2019s laws and regulations \ngoverning  environmental  and  social  impact  assessments,  as  well  as \nADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy  (2002)  are  followed.  If  there  is  any \ndiscrepancy between the Government\u2019s laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s \nrequirements, \nidentified  during \nsubproject appraisal process and resolved to ADB's satisfaction. \nThe Government and EVN will ensure that the contract documents for all \nfor \ncivil  works  under \nimplementation  of  any  specific  measures  and  monitoring  requirements \nthat  arise  from  the environmental assessment and review of subprojects \nand (ii) to give due consideration to prevention of damage to the natural \nenvironment  in  the  design,  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of \nproject facilities. \nThe Government will ensure that any environmental management plans, \narising from the environmental assessment and review of subprojects, are \nimplemented under EVN\u2019s supervision in order to adequately monitor and \nmitigate environmental impacts. \n\ninclude:  (i)  budget  provisions \n\nthe  Project \n\n \nB. \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\n62. \nAs  conditions  for  loan  effectiveness,  (i)  a  Subsidiary  Loan  Agreement  will  have  been \nduly  executed  on  behalf  of  EVN  and  will  become  fully  effective,  and  (ii)  the  AFD  Loan \nAgreement  will  have  been  duly  executed  and  delivered,  and  all  conditions  precedent  to  its \neffectiveness will have been fulfilled. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n63. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $120,000,000 to the Socialist Republic \nof  Viet  Nam  for  the  Northern  Power  Transmission  Sector Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility;  a  term  of  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements presented to the Board. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n18 November 2004  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21 \n\nSECTOR/SUBSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nGeneration \n\n \n1. \nPrior  to  1995,  the  electricity  sector  in  Viet  Nam  was  divided  between  three  vertically \nintegrated  regional  utilities  (i.e.,  power  companies  [PCs]  1,  2,  and  3)  responsible  for  the \nnorthern, southern, and central parts of the country. Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) was formed in \n1995, as a state-owned enterprise (SOE) under the purview of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. The \npower plants with a capacity of more than 60 megawatts (MW) and transmission facilities above \n110 kilovolts  (kV)  were  brought  under  EVN.  The  three  power  companies  were  converted  to \nindependent  accounting  units  of  EVN  and  have  responsibility  for  operating  the  network  below \n110 kV. The responsibility of distributing electricity in two major cities (Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh \nCity) was taken away from PC 1 and PC 2 and entrusted to the newly formed PC Hanoi and PC \nHo  Chi  Minh  City.  Since  then,  two  more  power  companies  have  been  formed  to  manage  the \nelectricity distribution in two other cities (Haiphong and Dong Nai).  \n \n2. \nThe  board  of  management  of  EVN  is  responsible  for  overall  business  management \nfunctions  and  has  powers  over  approving  the  business  plan  of  EVN,  and  approving  new \ninvestments  and  procurement  below  limits  stipulated  by  the  Prime  Minister.  The  Ministry  of \nIndustry is responsible for overall policy and oversight of the power sector. Under the proposed \nsector reforms, a regulatory agency will be set up within the Ministry of Industry, which is later \nexpected to evolve into a fully independent regulatory body. \n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  15  power  plants  owned  by  EVN  have  a  total  capacity  of  8,909 MW  (Table  A1.1), \nand are managed as dependent accounting units (i.e., cost centers). The non-EVN participation \nin power generation amounting to 600 MW at present is limited to several diesel power plants \nthat  are  primarily  operated  as  captive  power  plants.  However,  there  are  several  large \nindependent power producers (IPPs) with a combined capacity of over 2,500 MW scheduled to \nbe  commissioned  in  2004\u20132005.  These  include  Phu  My  2.2  and  Phu  My  3  undertaken  by  the \nprivate  sector  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support  and  several  other  IPPs  being \ndeveloped  by  SOEs  such  as  Vina  Coal  and  Petro  Viet  Nam.  The  breakdown  of  the  installed \ncapacity of operational power plants and the plants under construction are as follows: \n \n4. \nThe natural gas-based power plants planned for the south will be implemented either as \njoint ventures between EVN and other parties or as IPPs, except the O Mon I 600 MW power \nplant  presently  under  construction  with  assistance  from  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation (JBIC). The large-scale coal power plants in the north would be built by EVN with \nofficial development assistance (ODA) financing or as joint ventures with other SOEs and/or the \nprivate  sector.  However,  these  new  plants,  as  well  as  most  of  the  existing  coal  power  plants, \nwould  be  equitized  (i.e.,  partially  privatized)  as  part  of  the  proposed  sector  reforms  with  EVN \nretaining  a  majority  stake.  Although  most  of  the  large  (i.e.,  with  a  capacity  of  more  than \n100 MW) hydropower plants would be implemented by EVN as traditional public sector projects, \na large number of medium-size (10 MW to 100 MW) hydro plants are being developed as IPPs \nby domestic investors. \n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nTable A1.1: Electricity of Vietnam Generation Capacity \n(MW) \n \nCoal  Gas Turbine  Oil \n\n \n\nTotal \n\nHydro \n\nItem \nOperational Plants \n      North \n      South \n      Center \n      \n \nPlants Under Construction \n      North \n      South \n      Center \n      \n \nExpected Capacity by 2010a \n      North \n      South \n      Center \n      \n MW = megawatt.   \n a  Including proposed plants not yet under construction. \n Source: Electricity of Vietnam. \n\n2,050 \n1,195 \n   870 \n4,115 \n \n \n439 \n655 \n1,195 \n 2,289 \n \n \n2,657 \n2,667 \n3,150 \n8,474 \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n\n \n1,245 \n     \n \n1,245 \n \n \n1,700 \n \n \n1,700 \n \n \n3,745 \n \n \n3,745 \n\n \n\n    \n      2,482 \n \n      2,482 \n \n \n   \n     3,370 \n \n     3,370 \n \n \n             \n    7,362 \n \n     7,362 \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n3,295 \n4,744 \n   870 \n8,909 \n \n \n2,139 \n4,025 \n1,195 \n7,359 \n \n \n 6,402 \n 11,096 \n 3,150 \n20,648 \n\n \n \n1,067 \n \n1,067 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1,067 \n \n1,067 \n\nTransmission \n\n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe transmission network of EVN consists of a 500 kV single-circuit backbone line from \nnorth  to  south  and  220 kV  and  110 kV  networks  connecting  the  load  centers  and  most  of  the \npower  plants.  The  transmission  function  is  divided  among  four  transmission  companies \nadministered  as  dependent  accounting  units  (cost  centers).  The  national  load  dispatch  center \ncarries  out  the  system  operation  and  dispatching  of  power  plants  through  three  regional  load \ndispatch centers. \n \n6. \nUnder the proposed sector reforms, the four transmission units would be merged to form \na  single  transmission  company  as  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  EVN.  The  national  load \ndispatch  center,  which  will  be  upgraded  under  the  present  ADB  project  and  the  World  Bank \nproject  proposed  for  2005,  to  meet  the  requirements  of  operating  the  power  system  once  the \nfirst stage of reforms aimed at creating a \u201csingle-buyer\u201d market structure is implemented.   \n \nThe 500 kV north-south link is being converted to a double circuit and two 500 kV rings \n7. \nwould  be  built  in  the  north  and  south  to  connect  the  proposed  large  power  plants  to  the  load \ncenters. The ongoing transmission augmentation is mainly aimed at completing the 500 kV ring \naround  Hanoi  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City,  installing  new  220 kV  substations,  upgrading  existing \n220 kV  substations  to  meet  the  increasing  demand,  and  220 kV transmission lines to connect \nthe new 220 kV substations.

The  power  companies  purchase  bulk  power  from  EVN  at \nadministratively  fixed  bulk  power  tariffs  at  110 kV  level  or  at  medium  voltage  (i.e.,  35 kV and \n22 kV).  The  bulk  price  tariffs  are  set  by  EVN  to  enable  each  power  company  to  achieve  a \nreasonable  profit  irrespective  of  its  cost  structure.  This  results  in  more  efficient  power \ncompanies  having  to  pay  a  higher  tariff  for  bulk  power  purchases  and  cross  subsidize  less \nefficient companies.  \n \n10. \nThere  are  three  power  companies  (i.e.,  PC  1,  PC  2,  and  PC  3)  serving  northern, \nsouthern,  and  central  Viet  Nam,  respectively,  and    there  are  four  separate  power  companies \nserving the four major cities. (i.e., PC Hanoi, PC Ho Chi Minh City, PC Haiphong, and PC Dong \nHa).  The  power  companies  directly  supply  industrial,  commercial,  and  other  consumers  and \nresidential  consumers  in  urban  areas.  In  rural  areas,  consumers  supplied  at  low  voltage  are \nsupplied  through  retailers  (e.g.,  rural  cooperatives,  agents,  community  organizations)  as  the \npower  company\u2019s  network  is  only  up  to  the  low-voltage  transformer.

Land  acquisition  requirements  have  been  minimized  by  designing  the  route  of  the  new \ntransmission  line  (T/L)  to  avoid  passing  through  markets,  densely  populated  areas,  villages, \npagodas, protected areas, and historical or cultural assets, and the dimensions of towers have \nbeen  adapted  to  the  terrain.  Tables  A6.1  and  A6.2  present  the  breakdown  of  land  acquisition \nestimated for each subproject that has been appraised. The first batch of subprojects appraised \nhas identified that a total of 901 households (2,474 people) will be affected by land acquisition. \nOf  these,  357  households  (825  people)  will  be  severely  affected  and  544  households  (1,649 \npeople) will be marginally affected. Two hundred four households will have to move from their \nhouses  (but  will  be  able  to  rebuild  on  their  remaining  plot  of land).

To  guide  preparation  of  RAPs  for  those  subprojects  for  which  feasibility \nstudies have not yet been carried out, a resettlement framework (RF) has also been prepared.  \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlements \n\nC. \n \n4. \nThe  policy  framework  and  entitlements  of  the  Project  have  been  based  upon \nVietnamese legislation, the Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), and  ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development  (1998). The Government\u2019s policy \nand  legal  framework  toward  resettlement  are  moving  much  closer  toward  the  principles  of \nADB\u2019s  policy.  However,  provisions  and  principles  adopted  in  the  RAP  and  RF  for  the  Project \nsupersede the provisions of the relevant decrees currently in force in Viet Nam wherever there \nis a discrepancy. \n \nD. \n \n5. \n \n\nThe following basic principles have been adopted for the Project: \n\nProject Principles \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe principal objective of the RAP and RF is to ensure that the people affected \nby the Project should be at least as well off as, if not better off than, they would \nhave been without the Project. Project-affected people should at least be able to \nmaintain and preferably improve their standard of living and quality of life. \nThe populations affected by the Project are defined as those who may stand to \nlose,  as  a  consequence  of  the  Project,  all  or  part  of  physical  and  nonphysical \nassets, including homes, homesteads, productive lands, commercial properties, \ntenancy, \nincome-earning  opportunities,  social  and  cultural  activities  and \nrelationships, as well as other losses that may be identified during the process of \nresettlement planning. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  will  be  avoided  or  minimized  by  identifying  possible \nalternative  project  designs  and  appropriate  social,  economic,  operational,  and \nengineering solutions that have the least impact on the population in the project \narea. \nNeither  lack  of  legal  rights  to  the  assets  lost,  tenure  status,  nor  social  or \neconomic  status  will  bar \nthe \nthe  affected  person \ncompensation and rehabilitation objectives and measures outlined in the RAP. \nThe  cut-off  date  for  eligibility  for  compensation  for  physical  assets  affected  by \nproject  activities  such  as  the  construction  of  the  transmission  line,  towers, \nconstruction  of  the  substations  and  construction  of  roads  will  be  the  date  of \ncompletion  of  the  detailed  measurement  survey  and  census  after  the  detailed \ndesign has been completed for these components. \nAll project-affected people will be entitled to be compensated at replacement cost \nat current market value for affected assets, incomes and businesses; all severely \naffected project-affected people will also be provided with transitional assistance \nand income restoration and other rehabilitation assistance which will be sufficient \nto improve or at least restore their preproject living standards, income levels, and \nproductive capacity. \n\nfrom  entitlement \n\nto \n\n(vii)  After the detailed design has been completed for each component, a census and \nsocioeconomic  survey  will  be  conducted  as  the  basis  for  resettlement  planning \nand RAP preparation and a detailed measurement survey will be carried out as a \nbasis for compensation. \nIn the event of any population relocation, efforts will be made for existing social \nand cultural institutions of the people who are being resettled to be maintained to \nthe greatest extent possible. \nPreparation of RAPs, as part of subproject preparation and implementation, is to \nbe  carried  out  with  the  full  participation  of  affected  people,  as  well  as \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n33 \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nthe \n\nlocal  governments  of \n\nthe  Fatherland  Front, \n\nthe  project-affected  areas, \nrepresentatives  of \ncommunity  leaders,  civil  society  and  social  organizations such as the Women\u2019s \nUnion, \nfarmers\u2019  associations,  and  nongovernment \norganizations. Comments, concerns, and suggestions of those consulted will be \nduly taken into consideration during the design and implementation phase of the \nresettlement plans. \nThe order to commence civil works will not be given for any civil works contract \nfor  any  subproject  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  until  the  Government  has \nthe  approved  RAP, \ncompleted  satisfactorily  and \n(a) compensation  payment  and  relocation  to  new  sites,  where  applicable,  and \n(b) agreed  rehabilitation  assistance,  prior  to  obtaining  possession  and  rights  to \nthe land. \nConsideration will be given and assistance provided, where necessary, to those \nmost  vulnerable  to  the  adverse  impacts  of  resettlement  (including  the  poorest, \nfemale-headed  households,  the  disabled  and  elderly  with  no  means  of  support, \nand those from minority groups) to mitigate their hardships and to assist them in \nimproving  their  livelihoods.  Their  needs  will  be  considered  in  the  formulation  of \nthe RAP and in the options and mitigation measures identified. \n\nin  accordance  with \n\n(xii)  Adequate  budgetary  support  will  be  fully  committed  and  be  made  available  to \ncover the costs of land acquisition and resettlement and rehabilitation within  the \nagreed implementation period. \n\n(xiii)  Detailed RAPs for implementation will be translated into Vietnamese and placed \nin  project  and  commune  offices  for  the  reference  of  affected  people  as  well  as \nany interested groups. \n\n(xiv)   Appropriate  reporting,  monitoring,  and  evaluation mechanisms will be identified \nand set in place as part of the resettlement management system. Monitoring and \nevaluation  of  the  land  acquisition  process  and  the  final  outcome  will  be \nconducted independently of the Executing Agency. \n\nEntitlements  \n\n \nE. \n \n6. \nThe  project  entitlements  were  designed  to  cover  compensation,  resettlement,  and \nrehabilitation for lost assets and restoration or enhancement of the livelihoods of all categories \n(directly  and  indirectly  affected,  titleholders  and  nontitleholders)  of  affected  people.  The \nentitlement matrix for the Project summarizes the main types of losses and the support entitled \nfor each type of loss. Structures will be compensated at full replacement cost at current market \nvalue  in  materials  or  cash  or  a  combination  of  the  two,  with  no  deduction  for  depreciation  or \nsalvageable materials. All structures can be rebuilt on remaining land and no resettlement sites \nwill be required. Tenants will be entitled to 6 months rental allowance and assistance to find new \naffordable  rental  accommodation.  Severely  affected  productive  land  will  be  compensated  with \nreplacement  (land  if  available,  or  cash  equivalent  to  current  market  value)  and  income \nrestoration  assistance.  Crops  and  trees  will  be  compensated  at  current  market  value. \nTemporarily acquired productive land will be rented at a rate of 10% of the current market value \nand  returned  to  the  original  user  fully  restored  to  its  original  or  better  condition.  All  other \ntemporarily  acquired  land  will  not  be  compensated  but  will  be  restored to its original or better \ncondition. There will be no permanent loss of business or salary income. Temporary losses of \nsalary  and  business  income  will  be  fully  compensated.  All  severely  affected  households \n(affected by house displacement and/or loss of more than 10% of productive income-generating \nland) will be entitled to a transition subsistence allowance equivalent in value to 30 kilograms of \nrice  per  person  per  month.  Severely  affected  farmers  will  also  be  entitled  to  agricultural \nextension assistance. Severely affected households and vulnerable households will be entitled \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nEthnic Minorities and Disadvantaged Groups \n\nto skills training for 3\u20136 months and a subsistence allowance during the training period, as well \nas  credit  assistance  to  be  financed  by  the  Project  but  administered  through  existing  credit \nprograms.  The  details  of  this  will  be  designed  during  RAP  implementation  and  have  been \nbudgeted. No landless or illegal occupants of land were identified during project preparation. In \nthe event that any landless households are identified during the detailed measurement survey, \nthey  will  be  provided  with  temporary  or  lease  rights  to  replacement  land.  Landless  project-\naffected people will not be displaced until the commune allocates land for them. Any illegal land \nusers  will  be  compensated  for  their  lost  assets.  All  project-affected people will be assisted to \nrestore or improve their preproject socioeconomic conditions. \n \nF. \n \nThe social analysis carried out by the PPTA consultants in 2004 shows that  7.4% of the \n7. \npopulation  in  the  project  area  are  from  ethnic  minorities.  They  are,  like  the  majority  of  the \npopulation in the project area, working in agriculture and appear to be integrated into the larger \npopulation and, in general, are better off than average. Of the affected households, 15 were of \nethnic  minorities  and  they  all  live  in  Quang  Ninh  province.  The  majority  of  these  (12)  live  in \nUong Bi town and are from the Dao and Tay groups. A further three households live in Thong \nNhat commune and are from  the San Diu group. The Project is not expected to have any effect \nspecific  to  these  groups  other  than  land  acquisition,  which  is  to  be  mitigated  by  the  actions \nproposed  in  the  RAP  and  RF.  In  preparing  for  further  subprojects,  attention  will  be  given \nspecifically  to  assessing  their  impacts  on  any  minority  groups  likely  to  be  affected.  Special \nattention will be given to identifying and addressing any special needs of this group as well as \nthose of other vulnerable and/or disadvantaged groups such as the landless, the poor, women-\nheaded  households,  the  disabled,  and  war  veterans.  Any  that  might  be  identified  during  the \ndetailed  measurement  survey  will  be  assisted  through  the  Project\u2019s  socioeconomic  support \nprogram  (skills  training,  agricultural  extension  assistance, access to credit, and priority access \nto project-related employment). \n \nG. \n \n8. \nHouseholds that have to relocate will participate in identifying and selecting options for \ngovernment assistance to relocate on their existing plot, or to move to either group or individual \nrelocation  sites,  or  to  receive  cash  compensation  and  to  make  their  own  arrangements  for \nrelocation.  Households  that  are  severely  affected  through  the  loss  of  more  than  10%  of \nproductive  assets  will  be  assisted  to  purchase  replacement  land  or  increase  productivity  on \nremaining  land  or  learn  new  income-generating  skills  through  the  socioeconomic  support \nprogram.  In  the  case  that  any  businesses  have  to  relocate,  they  will  be  assisted  to  do  so  to \nviable new sites. \n \nH. \n \n9. \nThere was an extensive consultative process during the social analysis and resettlement \nplanning  period  of  the  feasibility  study.  Resettlement  planning  and  RAP  preparation  and \nimplementation during project implementation will follow the Project\u2019s participatory approach. A \nsocioeconomic  survey  was  conducted  with  30%  of  seriously  affected  project-affected people \nand  10%  of  marginally  affected  project-affected people in all  affected districts/communes. The \nquestions  were  designed  to  elicit  gender-specific  data.  Further  information  dissemination  and \nconsultations are to be carried out during the implementation phase of the Project. Grievances \nof  project-affected  people  are  to  be  addressed  by  the  grievance  mechanism  and  process  as \ndescribed  in  Chapter  VIII  of  the  RAP.  Information  on  compensation  and  resettlement  options \n\nParticipation of Affected People and Resettlement Disclosure \n\nResettlement Strategy and Income Restoration \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n35 \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\nMonitoring of Resettlement Planning and Implementation and Impacts \n\nhas  been  disclosed  to  core  subproject-affected  people  by  means  of  a  project  information \nbooklet, which has been translated into Vietnamese and delivered to all commune offices. This \nwill be done similarly for all remaining subprojects prior to approval. Copies of all final RAPs will \nalso be displayed in commune offices. The RAP and RF have also been posted on ADB\u2019s web \nsite.  \n \nI. \n \nThe implementation of resettlement activities requires the involvement of agencies at the \n10. \nnational, provincial, district, and commune levels. Resettlement committees will be established \nat the provincial, district, and commune levels, as required by Decree CP 22/1998 and will be \nunder the responsibility of Northern Power Project Management Board (NPPMB). Electricity of \nVietnam (EVN) and more particularly NPPMB and its local agencies have limited experience in \npreparing and implementing resettlement activities with ADB. Because of the complexity of this \nsector loan and the number of subprojects, resettlement specialist consultants will be engaged \nfor  the  purposes  of  both  supervision  and  capacity  building  so  as \nto  ensure  the  effective \nimplementation of land acquisition and resettlement. \n \nJ. \n \nIn  addition  to  internal  monitoring  by  NPPMB,  an  agency,  to  be  known  as  the \n11. \nindependent monitoring agency, specialized in social sciences, will be identified, recruited, and \nthen  mobilized  before  the  start  of  any  resettlement  activities,  including  the  detailed \nmeasurement  survey.  The  independent  monitoring  agency  will  be  required  to  submit  periodic \nreports  on  the  progress  of  implementation  and  make  any  necessary  recommendations \nregarding the issues identified through their monitoring. \n \nK. \n \n12. \nTotal  costs  for  resettlement  are  estimated  at  D96,278.07 million  ($6,146,853).  This  is \ncomposed  of  (i) compensation  costs,  which  total  D77,391.41 million  ($4,940,406);  and \n(ii) demolition,  management,  and \ntotal  D18,886.66 million \n($1,206,547).  These  sums  may,  however,  change  at  the  time  that  the  detailed  measurement \nsurvey takes place to take into account actual losses and any changes in prices that may have \noccurred between the preparation of the RAP and actual implementation. \n \nL. \n \n13. \nAll resettlement activities will be coordinated with the civil works schedule. NPPMB will \nnot  approve  commencement  of  any  civil  work  for  any  subproject  to  be  financed  from  the  loan \nproceeds,  unless  the  Government  has  completed  satisfactorily  and  in  accordance  with  the \napproved  RAP  for  that  subproject  compensation  payment  and  relocation  to  new  sites,  and \nensured that rehabilitation assistance is in place prior to obtaining possession and rights to the \nland. \n\nimplementation  costs,  which \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\nCost Estimates \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS OF ELECTRICITY OF VIETNAM  \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nA. \n \nSince the creation of Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) in 1995, its financial performance has \n1. \nbeen  reasonable  and  it  has  consistently  made  a  profit.  This  performance  has  mainly  been \nattributable to the rapid expansion of the Vietnamese economy as a whole, resulting in a large \nincrease in demand for electricity. Electricity demand has increased at a faster rate than gross \ndomestic product (GDP), and EVN has taken advantage of this fact. However, in order to satisfy \nfuture demand resulting from sustained economic growth, EVN will need to make considerable \ninvestments  in  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution.  As  it  continues  to  increase  its \nindebtedness at a rapid pace, this rate of expansion could have a significant impact on financial \nperformance. \n \nB. \n \nAs  reflected  by  the  energy  sales  (shown  in  Table  A7.1),  EVN's  operations  have \n2. \nincreased  by  over  75%  between  1999  and  2003,  representing  an  annual  growth  rate  of  12%. \nThe total electricity sales have increased from 19.5 TWh in 1999 to 34.4 TWh in 2003. Although \nthe  average  tariffs  net  of  sales  taxes  have  only  increased  marginally  from  D662/kilowatt-hour \n(kWh) (USc4.75/kWh) in 1999 to D789/kWh (USc5.02/kWh) excluding value-added tax (VAT) by \n2003,  the  net  profit  margin  has  improved  due  to  the  improvements  in  operational  efficiencies. \nThis  has  enabled  the  net  profits  to  reach  D1,828 billion  (i.e.,  $116 million)  by  2003  from \nD1,088 billion ($78 million) in 1999. The financial performance of EVN during the period 1998\u2013\n2003 and the key financial ratios are summarized in Table A7.1.  \n \n\nHistorical Performance  \n\nTable A7.1: Financial Performance of Electricity of Vietnam, 1999\u20132003 \n(D billion) \n \n\nItem \nTotal Revenue \nRevenue from Electricity Sales \nProfit before Interest and Tax \nNet Profit \n\n \n\nCash Flow from Operations \nNew Borrowings \nNet Capital Injections \nInvestments \nDebt Service \n \nSelf-Financing Ratio (%) \nDebt Service Coverage Ratio \nDebt-Equity Ratio \nReturn on Net Fixed Assets (%) \nCurrent Ratio \nReceivables (days) \n\n1999 \n14,124 \n12,934 \n2,618 \n1,088 \n \n5,882 \n6,201 \n(287) \n11,666 \n1,254 \n \n22.7 \n4.8 \n41:59 \n8.9 \n2.76 \n\n32 \n\n2000 \n16,513 \n15,135 \n2,100 \n883 \n \n7,311 \n8,866 \n371 \n13,697 \n2,036 \n \n32.9 \n3.0 \n48:52 \n6.7 \n1.70 \n\n21 \n\n2001 \n19,209 \n17,540 \n2,127 \n999 \n \n6,739 \n6,132 \n519 \n9,206 \n3,811 \n \n49.4 \n1.8 \n48:52 \n5.1 \n1.48 \n\n16 \n\n2002 \n23,566 \n21,474 \n3,110 \n1,650 \n \n8,412 \n6,507 \n175 \n9,928 \n2,822 \n \n46.4 \n3.5 \n52:48 \n5.9 \n1.88 \n\n22 \n\n2003 \n30,246 \n27,481 \n2,880 \n1,828 \n \n10,904 \n46,337 \n31 \n13,347 \n2,703 \n \n70.3 \n5.7 \n53:47 \n11.3 \n\n2.00 \n\n20 \n\n Source: Audited accounts of EVN (1999-2003). \n\n \n3. \nThe  liquidity  of  EVN  had  also  improved  during  the  period  under  consideration  (1999\u2013\n2003) as reflected by a reduction in the receivables from 32 days of turnover in 1999 to 20 days \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n37 \n\nHistorical Covenant Compliance \n\nof turnover in 2003. At the same time, it maintains an average payable turnover rate of 200 days \n(partially due to treatment of some capital expenditures as current). This discrepancy between \nreceivables  and  payables  resulted  in  EVN  accumulating  a  significant  cash  surplus.  This  is \nreflected in a current ratio and quick ratio of 1.5 and 1.25, respectively, during the period under \nconsideration.  \n \nC. \n \nIn  the  two  most  recent  ADB  loans  to  EVN  (loans  1358-VIE  and  1585-VIE),  EVN \n4. \ncommitted  to  three  of  its  power  distribution  companies  (PC 1,  PC 2,  and  PC 3)  maintaining \ncertain  financial  ratios  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  ADB's  investments.  These  included  a \nminimum self-financing ratio (SFR) of 30%, a debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.5, and a \nrate  of  return  on  net  fixed  assets  (ROR)  of  12%.  In  addition,  EVN  committed  to  ADB  (i) to \nincrease its average retail tariffs in a phased manner, reaching the equivalent of 7.0 cents/kWh \n(i.e., including 10% VAT) by 1999; (ii) to maintain the ratio of the average residential tariff to the \naverage retail tariff; and (iii) to maintain the level of bulk tariffs charged from EVN to the power \ncompanies as a percentage of retail tariffs. \n \n5. \nWith regard to the power company covenants, they generally complied with the SFR and \nDSCR  but  regularly  fell  short  on  the  ROR  covenant.  As  the  power  companies  were  generally \nprofitable, although below the 12% threshold, this covenant was not strictly enforced. However, \nbecause  the  financial  performance  of  the  power  companies  was  largely  determined  by  EVN \nadministratively setting the bulk tariff on an ex-post basis (i.e., at the end of the fiscal year prior \nto  finalization  of  financial statements) to ensure compliance with the ratios, it is proposed that \nfinancial ratios with the power companies should no longer be used as loan covenants. \n \n6. \nEVN generally complied with the covenants on the average level of residential tariffs and \nlevel  of  bulk  tariffs  compared  to  average  retail  tariffs.  However,  EVN  was  unable  to  get \ngovernment  approval  to  raise  its  average  retail  tariffs  to  the  7.0  cents/kWh  level  due  to \nperceived negative impacts to economic growth. In 2001, a tripartite meeting was held between \nthe World Bank, ADB, and the Government and a new schedule of tariff increases was agreed \nto  raise  retail  tariffs  to  7.0  cents/kWh  by  July  2005.  The  first  step  of  the  tariff  increases  was \nimplemented in October 2002 to improve the average tariff to 840 D/kWh (i.e., 5.6 cents/kWh) \nincluding  VAT,  but  the  schedule  was  not  maintained  thereafter.  Although  EVN  submitted  a \nproposal to increase the average tariffs to 5.9 cents/kWh in April 2003 and to 6.2 cents/kWh by \nOctober  2004,  the  Government  has  ruled  out  further  tariff  increases  for  the  time  being  in  the \ncontext  of  improved  financial  performance  of  EVN  and  its  ability  to  meet  its  financial \ncommitments, including servicing its debt and a substantial portion of the capital investments up \nto 2005 with the present tariffs.  \n \nFor  these  reasons,  the  World  Bank,  ADB,  and  the  Government  have  agreed  to  move \n7. \nforward with new financial covenants based on: (i) consolidated EVN results (not with the power \ncompanies), and (ii) EVN's overall financial viability and performance rather than arbitrary tariff \nlevels  set  in  foreign  currency.  Proposed  covenants  are  covered  in  the  section  on  financial \nprojections below. \n \n8. \nThe cumulative financial performance of EVN during the period 1998\u20132003 and the key \nfinancial ratios are summarized in Table A7.1 above. The detailed financial data on an annual \nbasis are provided in Table SAG.1 of Supplementary Appendix G. \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n1. \n\nSales Growth \n\nFinancial Projections (2004\u20132010)  \n\nThe  cumulative  capital  investments  and  the  debt  service  of  EVN  during  1998\u20132003 \n9. \namount  to  D58.7  trillion  ($4 billion)  and  D12.6  trillion  ($850 million)  respectively.  These \ninvestments had been financed through cash flows from operations amounting to D39.2 trillion \n($2.6 billion),  borrowings  of  D46.6  trillion  ($3.2 billion),  and  capital  injections  of  D1.9  trillion \n($140 million).  Although  these  increased  borrowings  increased  EVN\u2019s  debt-equity  ratio  from \n41:59  in  1999  to  53:47  in  2003,  EVN  still  retains  the  capacity  to  absorb  further  borrowings  to \nfinance  its  investments  in  the  context  of  strong  growth  in  future  cash  flows  and  low  initial \ngearing. \n \nD. \n \n \n \n10. \nAlthough the corporate structure of EVN is envisaged to be changed under the proposed \npower sector reforms, EVN is likely to remain as a holding company owning significant stakes of \nthe operating subsidiaries. It is assumed that the electricity sales will reach 80.5 terawatt-hours \n(TWh)  in  2010  compared  with  34.5 TWh  in  2003,  with  annual  growth  rates  slowing  to  12.5% \nfrom  2005,  down  from  15%  in  2003  and  2004.  It  is  also  expected  that  EVN  will  purchase \n32.6 TWh  from  third  parties  (i.e.,  private  power  producers  and  joint-venture companies) out of \nthe  total  generation  of  93 TWh  in  2010  at  an  average  cost  of  D730/kWh  (USc4.2/kWh) \ncompared with just  2.1 TWh, the rate at which EVN bought from independent power producers \nin 2003. \n \n11. \nThe  aggregate  financial  projections  of  EVN  for  the  time  period  and  the  key  financial \nratios for the period 2004\u20132009 are shown in Table A7.2. The detailed financial projections of \nEVN on annual basis are provided in Supplementary Appendix G. The Supplementary Appendix \nalso contains the sensitivity of key financial ratios such as DSCR and SFR for several adverse \nmovements  in  key  assumptions  has  been  computed  to  assess  the  robustness  of  the financial \nviability of EVN. \n \n\n \n\n2007 \n56,613 \n53,696 \n6,176 \n4,151 \n \n\nItem \nTotal Revenue \nRevenue from Electricity Sales \nProfit before Tax \nNet Profit \n\nTable A7.2: Financial Performance of Electricity of Vietnam, 2004\u20132009 \n(D billion) \n \n2005 \n39,940 \n36,386 \n1,730 \n1,040 \n \n14,178 \n655 \n20,551 \n611 \n31,220 \n1,345 \n6,419 \n \n27.50 \n2.32 \n63:37 \n\n2006 \n50,030 \n45,622 \n4,481 \n2,970 \n \n17,896 \n1,172 \n25,272 \n992 \n38,610 \n1,772 \n8,678 \n \n26.20 \n2.21 \n66:34 \n\n2004 \n34,496 \n31,421 \n3,674 \n2,456 \n \n13,580 \n \n14,519 \n555 \n22,192 \n799 \n4,467 \n \n38.10 \n3.06 \n58:42 \n\n2008 \n63,610 \n61,125 \n7,974 \n5,513 \n \n25,926 \n720 \n31,093 \n1,452 \n46,721 \n1,623 \n15,141 \n \n32.60 \n1.97 \n69:31 \n\nCash Flow from Operations \nEquitization Proceeds \nNew Borrowings  \nNet Capital Injections \nInvestments in Fixed Assets \nEquity Investments in JVs  \nDebt Service \n \nSelf-Financing Ratio (%) \nDebt Service Coverage Ratio \nDebt-Equity Ratio \nD= Dong, JV = joint venture.   \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates . \n\n21,270 \n2,321 \n31,238 \n1,387 \n47,513 \n2,030 \n11,581 \n\n \n25.90 \n2.05 \n69:31 \n\n2009 \n71,526 \n69,623 \n9,405 \n6,495 \n \n\n30,825 \n1,863 \n33,912 \n891 \n47,312 \n\n \n\n18,767 \n\n \n36.10 \n1.98 \n70:30 \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n39 \n\n3. \n\n2. \n\nTariffs \n\nCapital Expenditures \n\n \n \n \n12. \nThe  financial  projections  assume  that  average  tariff  of  EVN  will  increase  by  1.3%  per \nannum  due  to  the  change  in  consumer  mix  (i.e.,  increase  in  the  share  of  consumption  by \ncommercial  and  industrial  consumers  at  the  expense  of  residential  consumers).  This \nassumption  is  based  on  the  demand  forecast  for  different  consumer  categories  and  higher \nindustrial  and  commercial  tariffs  relative  to  residential  tariffs.  It  is  further  assumed  that  an \naverage tariff increase of 10.5% (i.e., in addition to the increase in average tariff due to shift in \nthe  consumer  mix)  in  2006  and  3%  tariff  increase  in  2007  in  order  to  meet  minimum  debt \nservice coverage and self-financing ratios would be required. This would result in the average \ntariff  level  reaching  D973/kWh  (USc  5.74/kWh)  by  2009  compared  to  average  tariff  level  of \nD789/kWh (USc 5.02/kWh) in 2003. \n \n13. \nTo  meet  the  increasing  demand  for  energy,  EVN  will  have  to  undertake  substantial \ninvestments  in  generation  and  network  capacity.  While  EVN  is  expected  to  undertake  most  of \nthe  transmission  and  distribution  investments,  non-EVN  entities,  i.e.,  the  private  sector  and \nother  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  will  also  invest  in  power  generation  facilities  to \nsupplement  EVN\u2019s  investments.  The  total  investments  to  be  mobilized  by  non-EVN entities in \nthe power sector is expected to be in the order of $3 billion during 2004\u20132009. \n  \n \n \n14. \nThe  cumulative  capital  investments  to  be  made  by  EVN  during  2004\u20132009 amount to \nD234 trillion ($14.9 billion) compared with D58 trillion ($4.0 billion) during 1998\u20132003, implying a \nthreefold  increase  in  capital  investments.  In  addition  to  the  direct  investments,  EVN  is  also \nplanning to form joint-venture companies to implement some of the power generation projects in \n2004\u20132009, and to invest D7.6 trillion ($465.0 million) of equity in these companies. These joint \nventures would also mobilize debt financing of approximately D31,000 billion ($2.0 billion). \n  \n15. \nThe  Government  has  approved  a  plan  for  EVN  to  equitize  (i.e.,  partially  divesture) \nminority  stakes  in  some  power  generation  plants,  and  the  proceeds  from  these  sales  are \nincluded in the cash-flow projections and used in the computation of the SFR and DSCR. The \nliabilities of new power plants to be developed as joint ventures between EVN and other parties \nare  not  consolidated  in  the  base  case  financial  projections  as  the  ownership  of  structures  of \nthese joint ventures has yet to be finalized.  \n \n16. \nAlthough EVN\u2019s internal cash generation is projected to reach D124 trillion ($ 7.9 billion) \nduring  2004\u20132009,  the  bulk  of  the  investments  will  be  financed  by  borrowings  amounting  to \nD153  trillion  ($9.8 billion).  This  indicates  significantly  increased  levels of borrowings compared \nwith 1999\u20132003 when EVN borrowed only D39 trillion ($2.5 billion). In the absence of significant \nequity  injections,  this  investment  plan  would  substantially  increase  EVN\u2019s  debt  and  its  debt \nservice  requirements.  The  debt-to-equity  ratio  would  increase  to  70:30  in  2009  from  53:47  at \n2003  and  the  debt  service  requirements  in  2009  would  be  D18.8  trillion  ($1,195 million) \ncompared with D2.29 trillion ($146 million) in 2003, resulting in DSCR dropping to 2.0 by 2009 \nfrom 5.7 in 2003. This trend reflects EVN\u2019s transition from a lightly geared utility due to lack of \naccess to debt financing prior to 1995, to a more typical utility in a fast-growing economy.    \n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n4. \n\nProposed Covenants \n\n \n \n17. \nGiven  the  increasing  indebtedness,  a  maximum  long-term  debt-to-equity  ratio  of  70:30 \nand minimum DSCR of 1.5 are proposed as financial covenants to ensure that EVN\u2019s debt level \nand its debt service capacity remain within prudential limits. Although the debt-to-equity position \nis steadily increasing and  DSCR is decreasing, they are expected to remain within these limits \nduring the forecast period. It is also important to include a minimum SFR of 25% to ensure that \nEVN  is  generating  adequate  cash  flows  to  finance  a  reasonable  portion  of  the  capital \ninvestments to retain the company's leverage within prudential limits. \n \nE. \n \nDespite  its  ambitious  capital  expansion  program,  it  appears  that  EVN  can  maintain  its \n19. \nfinancial  viability  if  tariff  increases  are  implemented  as  proposed  and  if  additional  financial \nincome  from  equitization  is  realized.  As  shown  in  Table  A7.3,  compliance  of  the  financial \ncovenants  is  projected  over  the  forecast  period.  However,  if  additional  income  does  not \nmaterialize from equitization or if revenue does not grow in line with these assumptions, further \nincreases in retail tariffs will be required to maintain covenant compliance. \n \n\nConclusion \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n41 \n\n                                   COST ESTIMATES OF THE CANDIDATE SUBPROJECTS \n\n($ million) \n \n \n\nForeign \nCost

As  these  individual  subprojects  are  not  stand-alone  investments  and \nwould not yield benefits if considered in isolation, the financial analysis was conducted using a \ntime-slice  approach  for  the  entire  northern  region  investment  program.  Hence  the  financial \nviability of the overall investment program in northern Viet Nam during the period 2004\u20132010, of \nwhich  the  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  the  project  form  part,  has  been  assessed.  The \nweighted average cost of capital (WACC) is also calculated for the overall investment program \nin northern Viet Nam to be financed by Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) and was compared with the \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  to  ascertain  the  financial  viability  of  the  investment \nprogram. The sensitivity of the FIRR to adverse movements in the underlying assumptions was \nalso  assessed.  Based  on  this  analysis,  the  investment  program  in  northern  Viet  Nam  is \nfinancially viable. \n \nB. \n \nThe financial analysis is carried out in a manner consistent with the assumptions in the \n2. \neconomic  analysis.  The  sales  forecast  and  the  without-investment  case  described  in  the \neconomic  analysis  are  used  for  the  purpose  of  evaluating  the  financial  benefits  attributable  to \nthe  investment  program  during  2004\u20132010.  The  financial  cost  of  total  system  failure  due  to \nnoninvestment in north Viet Nam under the without-investment case, which is likely to happen \nafter 2007, has also not been considered in the financial analysis. \n \n3. \nThe  revenues  under  the  with-investment  case  are  frozen  when  the  system  capacity \ninstalled during 2004\u20132010 is fully utilized. The incremental financial benefits attributable to the \ninvestment  program  consist  of  the  difference  between  cash  flows  under  the  with-investment \ncase and the without-investment case. They are: \n \n\nMethodology \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  incremental  sales  over  and  above  the  curtailed  sales  under  the  without-\ninvestment case; \nsavings on transmission losses compared with the without-investment case due \nto higher energy flows from south to north under without-investment case; and \nthe difference in generation cost between the two scenarios. The plant dispatch \nunder the without-investment case is suboptimal and results in higher generation \ncost  on  a  per  unit,  i.e.,  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh),  basis.  However,  the  total \ngeneration cost under the with-investment case would be more than the without-\ninvestment case due to higher plant output to meet the higher demand. \n\nAssumptions  \n\n \nC. \n \nThe  financial  analysis  is  carried  out  in  real  terms  on  an  after-tax basis. The projected \n4. \ntariff  increases  shown  in  Appendix 7,  Table A7.3  are  applied  after  adjusting  for  inflation  (i.e., \nadjusted  tariffs  are  shown  in  the  first  column  of  Table  A12.5).  It  is  assumed  that  the  tariff  will \nremain constant in real terms after 2010. The prevailing fuel costs and power purchase prices \nare applied without any inflationary adjustments. The operation and maintenance costs and the \ncapital  costs  are  based  on  EVN\u2019s  estimates  (from  the  Fifth  Master  Plan,  2002)  and  industry \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n47 \n\nnorms.  The  capital  expenditure  program  used  in  the  analysis  is  shown  in  Table  A12.1.

It  is  assumed  that  the  financing  sources  will  consist  of  EVN\u2019s  equity \ncontribution financed through retained earnings and a combination of foreign and local currency \nloans.  Based  on  expectations  and  EVN\u2019s  historical  cost  of  borrowing,  the  foreign  and  local \ncurrency  loans  earmarked  for  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  are  assumed  to  carry \ndifferent nominal interest rates. \n \n6. \nThe cost of EVN\u2019s equity is estimated using the capital asset pricing model. The risk-free \nrate  is  taken  as  8.5%  based  on  the  prevailing  rate  of  government  bonds  denominated  in  local \ncurrency. The market risk premium for Viet Nam is taken as 11% based on the average return \non listed companies in Viet Nam. The equity beta for EVN is estimated to be 0.85 based on the \nlisted power utilities in other developing countries. This results in a risk premium of 9.4% and a \nnominal  cost  of  equity  of  17.9%.  The  other  assumptions  are  domestic  inflation  rate  of  3%, \ninternational US dollar interest rate of 1%, tax rate of 32%, and 2.5% for the minimum interest \nrate test in view of prevailing low  international interest rates. As shown in Table A12.2, WACC \nfor the investment program in northern Viet Nam during 2004\u20132010 is 6.86%. \n \n\nTable A12.2: Weighted Average Cost of Capital Computation \n \n\n \nItem \nEVN Equity \nForeign Loans \n  Generation \n  Transmission \n  Distribution \nLocal Loans \n  Generation \n  Transmission \n  Distribution \nTotal \n\nFinancing \n(D trillion) \n29.90 \n \n16.80 \n5.10 \n6.60 \n \n16.80 \n6.30 \n8.10 \n89.50 \nAdj = adjusted, D = dong, EVN = Electricity of Vietnam. \nSource: PPTA Final Report, Table 2.13. \n\nNominal \nCost (%) \n17.90 \n \n5.60 \n6.70 \n6.70 \n \n9.00 \n9.00 \n9.00 \n \n\nWeight \n(%) \n33.30 \n \n18.70 \n5.70 \n7.30 \n \n18.70 \n7.10 \n9.10 \n100.00 \n\nTax Adj.

These  were \ncalculated  by  taking  the  difference  between  sales,  transmission  losses,  and  operating costs \nunder the with- and without-investment scenarios. The difference in plant dispatch between the \ntwo  scenarios  is  computed  by  simulating  the  plant  dispatch  under  the  two  scenarios.  The  fuel \ncost  and  the  purchase  price  from  independent  power  producers  are  used  in  computing  the \ngeneration cost under the two scenarios. The savings due to reduced transmission losses under \nthe  with-investment  case  compared  with  the  without-investment  case  are  captured  in  the \ndifference  in  generation  cost  between  the  two  scenarios.  The  financial  revenue  flows  due  to \ndifference in operation and maintenance cost under the two scenarios are also included in the \nfinancial analysis. The net financial revenue flows are further adjusted for taxation by taking into \naccount the tax credit due to depreciation and interest cost. The net financial flows are shown in \nTable A12.5. \n \n\n \n\nWithout-Investment Scenario \n\n39,013 \n45,040 \n50,847 \n57,430 \n64,896 \n73,368 \n82,984 \n\n38,562 \n43,607 \n48,006 \n52,515 \n53,766 \n59,001 \n63,773 \n\nYear \n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n\n  Sales          Generation      Losses \n7,813 \n46,375 \n9,831 \n53,438 \n11,769 \n59,775 \n14,607 \n67,122 \n18,743 \n72,509 \n19,638 \n78,639 \n22,460 \n86,233 \n\nTable A12.3: Comparison of With- and Without-Investment Scenarios \n(GWh) \n \nWith-Investment Scenario \n  Sales        Generation    Losses \n6,510 \n45,523 \n8,399 \n53,439 \n9,092 \n59,939 \n10,489 \n67,919 \n10,632 \n75,528 \n9,411 \n82,779 \n13,140 \n96,126 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n8. \nThe  differences  in  sales  and  generation  cost  under  the  two  scenarios remain constant \nfrom  2011  as  system  capacity,  including  investments  made  during  2004\u20132010,  are  fully \nexhausted by 2010 and no further increases in sales are considered. Hence the financial flows \n(sales  revenue,  cost  of  generation  and  of  operation  and  maintenance)  under  both  with- and \nwithout-investment scenarios remain constant from 2011. \n \n9. \nAll project benefits and costs were discounted at a discount rate equivalent to the WACC \nof  the  proposed  investment  program  in  north  Viet  Nam.  The  analysis  was  run over the period \nfrom 2004 to 2030 when the power plants built during 2004\u20132010 end their useful economic life. \nThe analysis indicates that the proposed investment program in north Viet Nam has an FIRR of \n12.82% compared with a WACC of 6.86% and a net present value (NPV) of D43.2 trillion when \ndiscounted at the WACC. \n  \nF. \n \n10. \nThe  sensitivity  of  the  FIRR  and  the  NPV  to  several  adverse  movements  in  key \nassumptions  has  been  computed  to  assess  the  robustness  of  the  financial  analysis.  The NPV \nhas been calculated at a discount rate equal to the WACC. A breakeven analysis has also been \nperformed to ascertain the variation required to reduce the NPV to zero and to make the FIRR \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n49 \n\nequal to the WACC.

It is noted that the increased fuel cost improves the FIRR. This is because in the \nwith-investment  case,  the  proposed  hydro  plants  in  northern  Viet  Nam  displace  some  of  the \nthermal  plants.  This  results  in  larger  financial  savings  compared  with  the  without-investment \ncase when the fuel prices are increased from the base case. \n \n\n\f \n\n5\n0\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n2\n \n\ni\n\n \n\nTable A12.5: Financial Internal Rate of Return Computation \n(D billion) \n \n\n \nYear \n\nAverage\nTariff \nD/kWh \n792 \n802 \n882 \n908 \n920 \n932 \n944 \n944 \n944 \n944 \n944 \n944 \n944 \n944 \n944 \n944 \n944 \n944 \n944 \n944 \n944 \n944 \n944 \n944 \n944 \n944 \n944 \n \n \n \n\nIncremental \nSales Revenue \n357 \n1,149 \n2,505 \n4,462 \n10,240 \n13,390 \n18,136 \n18,136 \n18,136 \n18,136 \n18,136 \n18,136 \n18,136 \n18,136 \n18,136 \n18,136 \n18,136 \n18,136 \n18,136 \n18,136 \n18,136 \n18,136 \n18,136 \n18,136 \n18,136 \n18,136 \n18,136 \n \n \n \n\n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n2029 \n2030 \n \n \n \nD = dong, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, kWh = kilowatt-hour, NPV = net present value, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nIncremental \nRevenue Flow \nfrom Operations \n32 \n438 \n1,963 \n6,836 \n9,827 \n13,576 \n15,466 \n15,466 \n15,466 \n15,466 \n15,466 \n15,466 \n15,466 \n15,466 \n15,466 \n15,466 \n15,466 \n15,466 \n15,466 \n15,466 \n15,466 \n15,466 \n15,466 \n15,466 \n15,466 \n15,466 \n15,466 \n \n \n \n\nIncremental \nSystem \nOperation Cost \n(325) \n(711) \n(542) \n2,374 \n(413) \n186 \n(2,670) \n(2,670) \n(2,670) \n(2,670) \n(2,670) \n(2,670) \n(2,670) \n(2,670) \n(2,670) \n(2,670) \n(2,670) \n(2,670) \n(2,670) \n(2,670) \n(2,670) \n(2,670) \n(2,670) \n(2,670) \n(2,670) \n(2,670) \n(2,670) \n \n \n \n\nIncome Tax on \nIncremental \nRevenues \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n(145) \n0 \n(1,267) \n(1,198) \n(1,340) \n(1,485) \n(1,636) \n(1,800) \n(1,933) \n(2,364) \n(2,997) \n(3,490) \n(3,937) \n(4,271) \n(4,473) \n(4,634) \n(4,728) \n(4,766) \n(4,804) \n(4,846) \n(4,878) \n(4,903) \n(5,777) \n \n\n \nCapital \nExpenditure \n(24,973) \n(17,140) \n(15,692) \n(14,433) \n(7,692) \n(5,150) \n(4,427) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nNet Financial \nBenefits \n(24,941) \n(16,702) \n(13,729) \n(7,597) \n1,990 \n8,426 \n9772 \n14,268 \n14,126 \n13,981 \n13,830 \n13,666 \n13,533 \n13,101 \n12,469 \n11,976 \n11,529 \n11,194 \n10,992 \n10,832 \n10,738 \n10,700 \n10,662 \n10,620 \n10,588 \n10,562 \n9,688 \n\nFIRR   12.86%\nNPV at WACC  43,173 \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n51 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n \n1. \nThe  Project  includes  a  series  of  individual  subproject  investments,  including  a  500-\nkilovolt (kV) transmission line and a number of substations. These investments form part of the \nGovernment\u2019s power sector investment program for the northern region. Since these individual \nsubprojects  are  not  stand-alone  investments  and  would  not  yield  benefits  if  considered  in \nisolation,  the  economic  analysis  was  conducted  using  a  time-slice  approach  for  the  entire \nnorthern region investment program. The investment program analyzed covers the period 2004 \nto 2010. This period defines all associated costs and benefits of meeting demand.  \n \nA. \n\nDemand Forecast \n\nDespite  the  global  economic  slowdown  in  the  early  2000s,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economy  has \n2. \nexperienced real annual growth rates of about 6.8%. While per capita consumption of electricity \nin  Viet  Nam1  is  still  among  the  lowest  in  Southeast  Asia,  average  demand  growth  has  been \naround 14% over the past decade. With an expected medium-term annual real gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth of around 7%, electricity demand is predicted to continue to increase over \nthe coming years.  \n \n3. \nThe load forecasts used by EVN are developed by the Institute of Energy (IoE). These \nwere  updated  in  May  2003.2  The  key  force  driving  growth  in  electricity  demand  is  the \nassumption  of  a  sustained  GDP  growth  of  around  7%  per  year.  The  forecasts  show  that  the \nmarket  share  for  industry  increases  significantly.  This  is  consistent  with  the  view  that  the \nindustry sector will be the main driver of economic growth.  Demand growth in domestic sector \ndemand mainly stems from existing consumers as new connections are limited by the already \nhigh  connection  rates.  Table  A13.1  shows  the  increase  in  demand  in  the  base  case  forecasts \nfor the northern region and the derived implicit elasticities.  \n \n\nTable A13.1: Load Forecast \n \n2005\u20132010 \n(%) \n \n15.7 \n3.9 \n7.4 \n15.5 \n11.7 \n\n2000\u20132005 \n(%) \n \n17.4 \n4.2 \n8.1 \n16.6 \n11.9 \n\n2010\u20132015 \n(%) \n \n12.8 \n3.5 \n6.4 \n12.2 \n10.3 \n\n10.3 \n3.2 \n8.9 \n\n1.69 \n1.30 \n1.86 \n\n9.0 \n2.9 \n8.5 \n\n1.74 \n1.34 \n1.82 \n\n8.1 \n3.0 \n7.0 \n\n1.58 \n1.15 \n1.74 \n\nItem \nSales GWh \nIndustry \nAgriculture \nLighting \nCommercial \u2013 Service \nOther \nGDP Growth Rates \nIndustry \nAgriculture \nCommercial \u2013 Service \nImplied Elasticity \nIndustry \nAgriculture \nComm. \u2013 Service \n\n2015\u20132020 \n(%) \n \n\n12.3 \n3.4 \n6.5 \n12.2 \n10.4 \n\n9.2 \n3.1 \n7.4 \n\n1.34 \n1.10 \n1.65 \n\n                GDP = gross domestic product, GWh = gigawatt-hour. \n                Source: Calculations based on forecast in Fifth Master Plan Adjustment File, Ministry of Industry, 2002.. \n \n                                                 \n1  327 kWh per capita. \n2  The first forecasts were published in the original Fifth Master Plan from June 2000. Two revisions have since been \n\nmade in response to changes in the long-term economic outlook for Viet Nam. \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis \n\nB. \n \n4. \nThe  least-cost  generation  expansion  analysis  was  carried  out  by  IOE  using  the  Wien \nAutomatic  System  Planning  III  (WASP  III).  Input  data  and  assumptions  were  reviewed  and \nfound  appropriate.  Fuel  costs  are  based  on  international  prices.  A  sensitivity  analysis  was \ncarried out by examining the impact of fuel price changes. The generation plan was found to be \nwell balanced in terms of least cost,  the use of indigenous fuels, and diversity of fuels sources. \nDetails of the generation expansion program are provided in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n5. \nThe least-cost analysis of the 500 kV transmission line accounted for the possibility that \nit  may  be  cheaper  to  move  coal  by  road  to  power  stations.  This  analysis  was  carried  out  in \neconomic terms at border prices and includes costs for resettlement and environment mitigation \nmeasures.  It  shows  that  the  transport  cost  for  coal  is  higher  than  the  cost  of  transmission of \nelectricity.  Analysis  with  respect  to  least-cost  alternatives  for  transmission  voltages  and  the \nsizing of the 220 kV transformers were also undertaken for the substations. This analysis shows \nthat  500 kV  is  the  least-cost  voltage  for  the  transmission  line  and  that  either  125-megavolt-\nampere  (MVA)  or  250 MVA  transformers  are  the  best  size  for  the  substations,  depending  on \nload growth.  \n \nC. \n \n6. \nThe  economic  viability  of  the  investment  program  was  examined  on  the  basis  of \ncomparing costs and benefits of meeting demand growth as compared to a without-investment \nprogram scenario. The investment period covers the period 2004\u20132010. This period defines all \ncosts and benefits associated with the investment program.  \n \n7. \nThe  without-investment  scenario  assumes  that  there  will  be  no  investments  in \ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution  in  the  northern  region  after  2003.  Demand  will  be \nconstrained  by  capacity  available  prior  to  2004  but  accounts  for  the  possibility  of  meeting \ndemand beyond 2004 from spare capacity.  It is assumed that \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 du Vietnam (EVN) will \nkeep connecting consumers and meet demand until it either runs out of generation capacity or \nputs  stress  on  the  transmission  system  and  threatens  cascade  collapse.  To  determine  the \nwithout-investment  associated  costs,  load-flow  analysis  was  conducted  assuming  that  the \nexpansion  program  (generation,  transmission,  and  distribution)  in  the  north  of  the  country  is \nfrozen.  The  programs  for  the  central  and  southern  regions  are  allowed  to  continue.  This  will \nhave several direct consequences: \n \n\nEconomic Viability \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nlosses in the northern region will rise. This is caused by the load growth requiring a \nhigher current to go through the existing system; \nthe fuel cost increases as generation plants with a higher dispatch cost are forced to \noperate for longer hours; and \nincreasing levels of unserved energy. \n\n \n8. \nWith  the  investment  program,  the  demand  constraint  will  occur  at  a  later  period  and  at \nhigher levels.  Associated  with  the  different  demand  levels  in  the  with-  and  without-investment \ncases are capital expenditure, fuel, and operation and maintenance costs. Generation costs are \nbased  on  the  Fifth  Master  Plan  Adjustment  File  (MP5  AF)  and  on  estimates  derived  from  the \nWASP  III  analysis.  Transmission  costs  for  500 kV  and  200 kV  and  distribution  costs  (110 kV \nand below) are based on the MP5 AF. These costs were revised to include resettlement costs \nand load dispatch cost. Interest during construction (IDC), taxes, and duties were removed from \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n53 \n\nthe  capital  expenditure  and  a  conversion  factor  of  0.91  was  applied  to  estimated  local  cost \nelements.  \n \n9. \nThe  quantified  economic  benefits  associated  with  the  with-investment  case  include \n(i) cost  savings  resulting  from  higher  fuel  costs  of  meeting  demand  in  the  without-investment \ncase,  (ii) increased  sales  (since  the  load  forecast  will  be  severely  constrained  in  the  without-\ninvestment case), and (iii) cost savings associated with unserved energy.  \n \nThe approach taken to evaluate the benefits associated with incremental demand was to \n10. \ndetermine  the  area  under  the  demand  curve  as  the  measure  of  willingness  to  pay  (WTP)  for \neach  consumer  group.  This  area  is  determined  by  taking  two  extreme  points,  where  the  first \npoint  represents  the  present  tariff  and  the  revealed  consumption  at  this  tariff.  The  second \nextreme  point  represents  the  maximum  price  that  consumers  would  be  willing  to  pay  for \nelectricity. At prices higher than the maximum, consumers would avoid consuming electricity as \nthe benefits would be less than the costs. The maximum price is determined by considering the \nvalue  added  by  electricity  consumption.  The  levels  of  electricity  consumption  at  the  maximum \nprice  are  calculated  by  ensuring  equilibrium  between  cost  of  supply  and  the  benefits  of \nconsumption.  \n \n11. \nFor  the  domestic  sector  it  is  assumed  that  consumers  have  a  choice  between  leisure \nand work where people would work up to the point where the marginal wage rate is equal to the \nmarginal  value  of  leisure.  With  electricity,  the  value  of  leisure  increases.  Thus,  the  value of \nelectricity  will  be  the  loss  of  value,  or  welfare,  of  leisure  caused  by  outage.  For  nondomestic \nconsumers  it  is  assumed  that  production  ceases  if  there  is  no  electricity.  Thus,  consumers \nwould be willing to pay the amount up to the value added to avoid outage. Beyond this value, \nthe  costs  exceed  the  benefits.  Thus,  the  value  of  lost  electricity  is  the  lost  output  caused  by \noutage,  where  output  for  each  sector  is  taken  to  be  sector  gross  domestic  product.  Thus,  the \ncost to consumers of unserved energy represents the price they would be willing to pay to avoid \noutage. However, since nondomestic consumers would not be willing to pay more than it would \ncost  to  run  an  isolated  generator,  an  upper  bound  is  set  at  the  cost  of  self-generation. The \nbenefits  of  the  investment  program  associated  with  a  reduction  of  unserved  energy  are \nevaluated at the cost of unserved energy (COUE) for each consumer category. \n \n12. \nBenefits  associated  with  incremental  demand  are  evaluated  using  a  consumer  surplus \nmeasure  that  reflects  how  much  better  off  the  consumers  would  be  as  a  result  of  the  price \nchange  in  electricity.  The  consumer  surplus  measure  reflects  the  change  in  money  income \nresulting from the price change that would be needed to leave the consumer equally well off as \ncompared to before the price change. This compensating welfare measure is used to define the \nWTP for each consumer category. The calculated WTPs were adjusted by the conversion factor \nsince they were estimated at the official US$ exchange rate. The WTP and COUE by consumer \ncategory  are  shown  in  Table A13.2  and  the  details  of  the  calculations  are  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nTable A13.2: Willingness to Pay \n \n\nConsumer Category \n\nWillingness to Pay \n($/kWh) \n0.080 \n0.067 \n0.069 \n0.081 \n0.098 \n\nIndustry \nCommercial \nAgricultural \nDomestic Nonpoor \nDomestic Poor \nCOUE = cost of unserved energy, kWh = kilowatt-hour. \na  COUE for nondomestic consumers was capped by the cost of self-generation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nCOUE  \n($/kWh) \n0.68a \n0.49a \n0.16a \n1.41 \n0.31 \n\n \n\n13. \nThe  economic  analysis  compares  the  costs  and  benefits  associated  with  the  with-\ninvestment  program  scenario  with  those  of  the  without-investment  program  scenario.  It  is \nsummarized in Table A13.3 (below). All costs and benefits were discounted by a social discount \nfactor  of  12%.  The  analysis  shows  that  the  investment  program  yields  an  EIRR  of  40%,  well \nabove the opportunity cost of capital. \n \n14. \nA  sensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  with  respect  to  key  risks  and  assumptions  to \ninvestigate  the  robustness  of  the  economic  viability  of  the  investment  program.  The  analysis \ntakes into account a combination of adverse events. Particular concerns identified were related \nto the event that demand growth would not be realized. This may occur as a result of a global \neconomic  downturn  affecting  the  local  economy  or  as  a  result  of  overestimation  of  income \nelasticities. The low-load scenario analyzed in the sensitivity analysis corresponds to a scenario \nwhere  the  income  elasticity  has  been  overestimated  by  50%  in  combination  with  a  50% \nreduction in GDP growth throughout the time period. In addition, the effect of an overestimation \nof  the  COUE  estimates  was  analyzed.  The  sensitivity  analysis  assumed  that  the  benefits \nassociated  with  COUE  were  overestimated  by  50%  and  100%,  respectively.  In  addition,  risks \nwith  respect  to  adverse  impacts  of  a  combination  of  costs  of  capital  expenditures,  fuel,  and \nindependent  power  producer  energy  purchase  prices  and  operation  and  maintenance  were \nanalyzed.  The  analysis  shows  that  the  investment  program  is  economically  worthwhile  even \nunder these harsh sensitivity assumptions. The EIRR marginally falls below the opportunity cost \nof capital only in the most extreme adverse conditions (Table A13.4). A separate risk analysis \nwas  also  undertaken  with  respect  to  key  factors.  This  analysis  is  detailed  in  Supplementary \nAppendix D. The results of the risk analysis show that the probability of the EIRR falling below \nthe opportunity cost of capital is negligible.  \n \n\nTable A13.4: Sensitivity Analysis \n \n\n \nLoad \nGrowth \nBase  \n \nLow \nLow \nLow \nLow \n\nCAPEX \n(%) \n\nBase \n \n \n+20 \n+30 \n+30 \n\nFuel \nCosts \n(%) \nBase \n-20 \n \n-20 \n-30 \n-30 \n\nO&M \nCosts \n(%) \nBase \n \n \n+20 \n+30 \n+30 \n\nIPP \nCosts \n(%) \nBase \n \n \n+20 \n+30 \n+30 \n\n \nCOUE \n(%) \nBase \n \n \n-50 \n-50 \n-100 \n\n \nEIRR \n(%) \n40 \n29 \n26 \n19 \n16 \n11 \n\n \nNPV  \n($ million) \n12,073 \n5,933 \n5,251 \n2,691 \n4,165 \n-282 \n\nCAPEX = capital expenditure, COUE = cost of unserved energy, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, \nIPP = independent power producer, NPV = net present value, O&M = operation and maintenance. \n\n \n\n    Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n\fTable A13.3: Incremental Costs and Benefits \n\nGeneration Load Despatch Transmission Distribution Generation TransmissionDistribution Fuel Costs\n\nCapital Expenditure\n\nO&M\n\nIncremental\nBenefits\n\nNet\nBenefits\n\n945\n525\n601\n616\n234\n69\n0\n\n0\n22\n22\n22\n7\n0\n0\n\n418\n361\n181\n66\n17\n7\n1\n\n154\n149\n160\n180\n203\n229\n261\n\n5\n11\n40\n19\n29\n37\n32\n32\n32\n32\n32\n32\n32\n32\n32\n32\n32\n32\n32\n32\n32\n32\n32\n32\n32\n32\n32\n\n8\n16\n19\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n\n6\n12\n19\n26\n34\n43\n53\n53\n53\n53\n53\n53\n53\n53\n53\n53\n53\n53\n53\n53\n53\n53\n53\n53\n53\n53\n53\n\n51\n209\n22\n255\n268\n307\n327\n327\n327\n327\n327\n327\n327\n327\n327\n327\n327\n327\n327\n327\n327\n327\n327\n327\n327\n327\n327\n\nIPP Costs\n4\n1\n89\n88\n27\n17\n96\n96\n96\n96\n96\n96\n96\n96\n96\n96\n96\n96\n96\n96\n96\n96\n96\n96\n96\n96\n96\n\nCost of\nUnserved\nEnergy\n0\n0\n0\n48\n1,478\n1,556\n1,899\n1,899\n1,899\n1,899\n1,899\n1,899\n1,899\n1,899\n1,899\n1,899\n1,899\n1,899\n1,899\n1,899\n1,899\n1,899\n1,899\n1,899\n1,899\n1,899\n1,899\n\n35\n108\n212\n366\n823\n1,061\n1,417\n1,417\n1,417\n1,417\n1,417\n1,417\n1,417\n1,417\n1,417\n1,417\n1,417\n1,417\n1,417\n1,417\n1,417\n1,417\n1,417\n1,417\n1,417\n1,417\n1,417\n\nEIRR\nNPV\n\n-1,437\n-758\n-719\n-194\n1,996\n2,534\n3,179\n3,179\n3,179\n3,179\n3,179\n3,179\n3,179\n3,179\n3,179\n3,179\n3,179\n3,179\n3,179\n3,179\n3,179\n3,179\n3,179\n3,179\n3,179\n3,179\n3,179\n40%\n12,073\n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, IPP = independent power producer, NPV = net present value, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nYear\n\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n3\n \n\ni\n\n5\n5\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nSector identified as a national priority in country \npoverty analysis?  Yes \n\n \n\n \nSector identified as a national priority in country \npoverty partnership agreement?  Yes \n\n \n\n \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \n \nViet Nam has made remarkable progress in providing electricity services to the population.  This is a key objective in \nthe  Government\u2019s  strategy  to  reduce  poverty  and  vulnerability.  The  share  of  households  with  access  to  electricity \nincreased from 49% in 1992 to 86% in 2002. Demand for electricity has increased substantially in the last decade with \nincreasing  incomes  and  reduced  poverty.  This  has  increased  household  affordability  of  appliances  and  electricity \nservices.  However,  annual  per  capita  consumption  remains  among  the  lowest  in  Asia  at  about  321  kilowatt-hours \n(kWh). Utilization of households is even lower, about 158 kWh per year or 13 kWh per month. \n \nReliable  and  good  quality  of  electricity  supply  is  key  for  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Electricity  supply \npromotes alternative sources of income that reduce the  vulnerability of households to falling below the poverty line. \nAccess to electricity has substantial expenditure-reducing effects, which is particularly important for poor households. \nThe poorest households in Viet Nam with access to electricity spend less than 2% of their total spending on electricity. \nThis is low compared with other countries in the region. Reduced expenditure on electricity allows households to use \nmore  expenditure  for  food  and  education  and  health  services.  Access  to  electricity  also  reduces  the  workload  of \nwomen in food processing and collecting water. Irrigation using electricity reduces input cost for farmers and increases \nagricultural productivity. \n \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nTargeting Classification: General Intervention \n\nB. \nThe poverty analysis for the Project was conducted to identify issues and assess impacts on the sector level since it \nwas  difficult  to  identify  specific  end-beneficiaries.  Field  assessments  and  consultations  were  conducted  in  both  rural \nand  urban  areas  within  the  impact  area  of  the  Project.  This  was  supplemented  by  data  analysis  from  the  2002  Viet \nNam Living Standard survey (VLSS 2002) and Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) consumption and connection cost data. A \nreview  of  EVN\u2019s  business  practices  was  conducted  to  identify  possible  barriers  for  the  poor  to  connect. These were \nthen discussed with the poor themselves and with the provincial people\u2019s committees in the project areas. \n \nVLSS 2002 shows that the national incidence of poverty has been reduced from 37% to 29%. Poverty headcounts in \nthe  provinces  located  in  the  Project  area  ranges  form  47.7%  in  Nge  An    to  15.2%  in  Hanoi.  The  share  of  poor \nhouseholds reported to use electricity as a main source of lighting in the project areas ranges from 75% to 95%. The \nratio of rural to urban beneficiaries is about 1:4. This means that the majority of project benefits will accrue to urban \nareas  where  poverty  incidences  are  generally  lower.  But  with  strong  rural-urban  links,  increasing  urban  migration \n(particularly of females who make up an increasing proportion of migrants), and remittances, indirect impacts in terms \nof  employment  and  income  effects  of  the  Project  are  expected  to  benefit  poor  households  in  rural  areas.  Reducing \nunemployment  and  underemployment  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas  will  be  key  for  sustaining  the  poverty reduction \neffects of economic growth. Formal sector employment opportunities need to be expanded to absorb new entrants into \nthe labor market. \n \nThe high share of households reported to use electricity as a main source of lighting suggests that a majority of the \npoor are connected. It can be assumed that the remaining households are the very poor and live either in very remote \nareas  with  no  grid-access  or  far  from  the  community  center  and  the  main  grid.  Special  efforts  will  be  needed  to \nconnect  these  households  in  terms  of  investments,  management  of  local  networks  and  in  terms  of  addressing \naffordability, in particular that of up-front charges. Some donor funded programs exist that address up-front charges. \nBut they are limited to specific project areas. \n \nThe level of electricity consumption is normally strongly correlated with income. This is mainly because as household \nincomes  rise,  affordability  of  appliances  increases.  Poor  households  thus  consume  smaller  amounts  than  nonpoor. \nThe very poor are often limited to using one or two light bulbs and sometimes a fan. Consumption levels range from \n2 kWh per month for the very poor to around 20\u201330 kWh for the poor just below and above the poverty line. The near-\npoor  and  poor  just  below  the  poverty  line  have  some  affordability  of  appliances  and  may  even  have  a  TV.  Of  the \npoorest income quintile, 17% reported having a color TV. However, these appliances, while cheap in terms of capital \ncosts,  are  second  hand  and  inefficient  in  electricity  usage  and  thus  more  expensive  in  running  costs.  Despite  these \nlow consumption levels, electricity is a priority for poor households. This is reflected in the fact that they are willing to \nsell an animal, and thus deplete savings, to pay for up-front connection charges. Thus, the value of just a few kWh of \nelectricity  consumption  in  terms  of  enhancing  the  quality  of  life  is  large  from  the  household  perspective.  Most \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n57 \n\nelectricity  consumption  in  terms  of  enhancing  the  quality  of  life  is  large  from  the  household  perspective.  Most \nhouseholds use electricity for domestic activities such as lighting, water pump, TV, and radio. Very few of the poor use \nelectricity  for  own-business  activities.  Access  to  the  grid  also  has  large  expenditure-reducing  effects  for  poor \nhouseholds and allows them to become more energy efficient, using fewer kWh. \n \nHowever,  in  rural  areas  electricity  services  are  not  always  reliable  and  of  good  quality.  This  is  due  to  the  rapid \nexpansion of the electricity network, poor local network management, and poor and long wiring from the pole to the \nhouse in rural areas. The sector will need to make substantial investments to meet the increasing demand from the \nresidential  sector.  High  losses  and  inadequate  power  supply  remain  a  burden  for  many  of  the  connected  rural \nconsumers.  Unreliable  services  and  voltage  fluctuations  reduce  some  of  the  benefits  of  electricity.  First,  electricity \nusage for income-earning activities in agriculture and small-scale commercial activities are adversely affected with a \nconsequent loss in income. Second, voltage fluctuations reduce the life time of appliances and increase the total cost \nof  using  electricity.  This  will  deter  consumers  from  purchasing  appliances  and  using  electricity  in  an  optimal  way. \nThird, when electricity is unreliable some households will resort to alternative but more expensive sources of supply \nwith a consequent impact on expenditure. These effects will worsen if investments are not made to increase quality \nand quantity of supply. Box A14.2 illustrates the effects of low voltage. \n \nIn urban areas, the requirement of formal registration cards is a key barrier for poor informal migrants, often from rural \nareas, to connect directly to EVN\u2019s services. This has created a market for \u201cmiddle-men\u201d, or meter landlords who buy \nelectricity  from  EVN  and  on-sell  to  end-consumers  at  higher  prices.  This  depletes  the  intention  of  the  substantial \nsubsidies  on the lowest tariff category. \n \nSubsidies in the sector are better able to reach the poor in Viet Nam than in most other countries in the region. This is \nbecause of the high connection rates, particularly in rural areas. In urban areas, the poor do not receive the full benefit \nof subsidies due to the existence of meter landlords. The design of the tariff structure and the overall subsidy level is \nnot  particularly  pro-poor.  All  residential  consumer  categories  are  heavily  subsidized,  including  the  nonpoor,  which \nimposes  an  opportunity  cost  that  could  have  been  used  for  alternative  activities  to  reduce  poverty.  It  would  be \nimportant to reduce subsidies in the sector and to target the subsidy to the poor\u2019s consumption bracket.  \n \nAffordability of up-front charges and monthly charges among the ethnic minorities living in the project area remains an \nissue. Poverty incidences and the depth of poverty remain higher among the ethnic minorities than for the Kinh.  \n \nThe poverty analysis has been summarized in a Poverty Impact Matrix (Table A14). \n \nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \n\n  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis?  Yes. A stakeholder analysis was undertaken during resettlement planning.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? There is a participation strategy for resettlement planning and implementation as \ndescribed in the summary resettlement action plan (RAP) and resettlement framework. \n \nD. \n \n\nGender and Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nAll  data  collected  during  the  inventory  of  loss  and  socioeconomic  survey  for  resettlement  planning  were  gender \ndisaggregated.  The  assessment  shows  that  women  are  not  disadvantaged  in  terms  of  education  and  literacy. \nWomen\u2019s  names  appear  with  their  husbands  in  the  Red  Book  giving  formal  right  to  the  use  of  lands  and  rights \nassociated  therewith.  Women  may  be  disadvantaged  in  that  they  may  not  speak  out  about  resettlement-related \ngrievances. This will  be taken into account and the grievance procedures will be strengthened in this regard. During \nresettlement implementation, special  attention  will  continue  to  be  paid  to  the  particular  needs  of  women,  particularly \nany special needs of women-headed households. \n \nHas an output been prepared?
