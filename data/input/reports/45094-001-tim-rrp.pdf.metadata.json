In  collaboration  with  other  development  partners,  the  project  will \nsupport the progressive upgrading of the whole of the national road network. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nA  fourfold  increase  in  government  spending  since  2006,  supported  by  offshore \npetroleum revenue, has generated strong economic momentum in Timor-Leste. Gross domestic \nproduct  (excluding  the  petroleum  sector  and  the  contribution  from  the  United  Nations)  has \ngrown at an average annual rate of 10.9% since 2006.3 The construction sector has expanded \nas  public  investment  levels  have  risen.  Agriculture,  which  accounts  for  most  employment,  has \nalso grown as productivity levels have increased and the area of land cultivated has expanded.4\n \nThe road sector is in decline because of inadequate rehabilitation and maintenance. \n \n4. \nThe Strategic Development Plan (SDP), 2011\u20132030 aims to sustain double-digit rates of \neconomic  growth  and  fast  track  economic  development.  The  vision  for  2030  is  a  modern  and \ndiversified  economy  with  high-quality  infrastructure.  The  SDP  envisages  three  pillars  for \ndevelopment\u2014social  capital  development, \ninfrastructure  development,  and  economic \ndevelopment. Increased public investment over the first 5 years of the SDP is intended to create \nthe conditions necessary to attract private investment and ensure a private sector-led economy \nby 2030. Improvement of land transport is a key factor.    \n \n5. \nHowever,  the  concentration  of  opportunity  in  the  capital,  Dili,  raises  concern  over  the \ninclusiveness  of  the  growth  process.  The  concentration  of  the  economic  expansion  in  Dili  is \nencouraging rural\u2013urban migration and resulting in a high rate of youth unemployment and high \ndemands  on  basic  services.  Diversifying  economic  activity  beyond  Dili  will  help  stem  these \npressures  and  share  the  benefits  of  Timor-Leste\u2019s  petroleum  wealth  more  widely.  This  will  be \nimportant if Timor-Leste aims to achieve an inclusive growth path and avoid the rising inequality \nexperienced elsewhere in Asia during episodes of rapid economic growth. \n \n6. \nRoads play a vital role in the economy and country integration of Timor-Leste. Roads are \nthe primary mode of transport, carrying about 90% of passengers and 70% of freight. The core \nnetwork comprises 1,426 km of national roads and 869 km of district roads. The national road \nnetwork,  linking  the  13  national  districts,  comprises  northern  and  southern  coastal  roads;  and \nfive  roads  traversing  north\u2013south,  connecting  the  two  coastal  roads.  The  district  roads  link \nsecondary  population  centers  to  the  national  roads.  The  core  network  is  supplemented  by \n716 km of urban roads, most of which are in Dili. Rural roads, about 3,000 km in length, provide \naccess to villages and more remote areas. Recent surveys indicate that almost the entire core \n\n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2009.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors: \nProposed  Asian  Development  Fund  Grant  to  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Timor-Leste  for  the  Road  Network \nDevelopment Sector Project. Manila. \n\n3 Real gross national income grew at 22.2% per annum on average over the same period. \n4 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nroad  network  is  in  an  unmaintainable  condition.  Only  about  8%  of  the  core  road  network  was \nassessed  to  be  in  fair  condition,  about  22%  in  poor  condition,  and  about  70%  in  very  poor \ncondition.5    The    Road    Network    Development    Sector    Project    (RNDSP),    currently    under \n  \nimplementation, targets improving this situation (footnote 2).\n \n7. \nTransport  services,  for  both  passengers  and  goods,  are  provided  by  the  private  sector \nwith  minibuses  and  light  trucks,  but  services  are  constrained  by  the  narrow  roads  and  difficult \nterrain  in  addition  to  the  generally  poor  condition  of  the  roads.  These  conditions  result  in  high \ncosts  and  unreliable  services.  Lack  of regulation  of the  sector,  lack  of road  safety  awareness, \nand  poor  road  conditions  contribute  to  high  accident  rates.  The  vehicle  fleet  (excluding \nmotorcycles)  doubled  between  2005  and  2009.  The  motorcycle  fleet  experienced  a  threefold \nincrease. This rate of expansion is likely to continue in the short and medium term. \n \nThe  MOI  is  responsible  for  planning,  developing,  and  maintaining  roads.  The  MOI\u2019s \n8. \nDirectorate  of  Roads,  Bridges,  and  Flood  Control  has  only  12  engineers\u2014seven  at  the \nheadquarters  in  Dili  and  five  in  regional  offices.  Each  regional  engineer  is  assisted  by  up  to \n12 supervisors  and  assistant  supervisors  depending  on  the  region.  The  Directorate  of  Roads, \nBridges,  and  Flood  Control\u2019s  shortage  of  capable  staff,  assets,  and  funding  in  the  districts \nseverely limits its capacity to manage and maintain the road infrastructure. To address this skill \nshortage, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is supporting the MOI with a multiyear technical \nassistance  (TA)  program  and  Japan  is  funding  a  twinning  program  with  the  Government  of \nIndonesia to focus on technical and management training for MOI engineering staff. \n \n9. \nTo  improve  the  performance  of  the  road  sector,  the  MOI,  assisted  by  ADB,  has \ndeveloped  the  Medium-Term  Road  Network  Development  Program,  the  implementation  of \nwhich  started  in  2010  with  the  RNDSP.  The  RNDSP  is  implementing  rehabilitation  and  road \nmaintenance  in  three  districts  and  is  supporting  the  development  of  systematic  road \nmaintenance (footnote 2). This support will be integrated with the project, which is located in the \nsame districts. \n \n10. \nSince  the  referendum  on  independence  of  Timor-Leste  on  30  August  1999,  ADB  has \nbeen the lead development agency in the road transport sector. It has provided six TA projects, \nthree  project  grants,  and  one  sector  grant  to  support  the  road  sector  development.  ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan, 2008\u20132010 directly tied development outcomes to the goals \nof the National Development Plan, predecessor of the SDP, which emphasized development of \ntransport infrastructure. \n \nThe  new  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS),  2011\u20132015 6  continues  ADB\u2019s  strategic \n11. \ndirections  in  Timor-Leste  by  concentrating  on  infrastructure  development  and  management. \nADB plans to provide complementary assistance in the core specializations of finance, regional \ncooperation and integration, and education, and will support the private sector as a key driver of \nchange  to  help  Timor-Leste  make  the  transition  from  a  public  sector-led  economy.7\n  Support \nprovided through the CPS will help Timor-Leste achieve inclusive economic growth by helping \nto  sustain  a  high  rate  of  economic  growth  and  by  sharing  economic  opportunities  across  the \npopulation.  ADB  support  for  infrastructure,  financial  services,  and  skills  training  will  help  meet \nthe  needs  of  a  growing  economy  and  improve  the  competitiveness  of  the  private  sector.  An \nemphasis on the provision of services outside the capital will support growth of agriculture and \nthe  rural  economy.  Poverty  will  be  alleviated  through  the  benefits  of  economic  growth, \n                                                \n5  ADB.  2008.

ADB  will  continue  in  the  role  established  under  the \nprevious  country  strategy  of  helping  to  coordinate  capacity  development  and  investment \nprogramming across infrastructure (particularly road transport, water and sanitation, and power), \nand  helping  to  mobilize  financial  resources  for  infrastructure  investment.  This  will  improve \nconnectivity, help increase the efficiency of movement of people and goods, and expand access \nto  the  basic  services  essential  to  development.  The  agriculture  sector  and  rural  areas  more \nbroadly will be key beneficiaries. \n \nThe project will support upgrading of Timor-Leste\u2019s priority sections of the national road \n13. \nnetwork to accommodate rapid economic and social development. The project will finance high-\npriority  road  links  identified  by  the  Medium-Term  Road  Network  Development  Program,  which \nwas prepared under ADB\u2019s TA (footnote 5). \n \n14. \nLessons from ADB\u2019s previous projects are incorporated in the project design. The main \nlessons are (i) sector approaches have been useful in allowing the government to progressively \nexpand  its  leadership  in  the  road  sector  and  in  providing  flexibility,  (ii) sustainability  requires \nattention to institutional capacity and long-term road maintenance strategies, and (iii) community \nparticipation  in  road  works  has  been  successful  in  extending  the  benefit  of  national  road \ndevelopment  to  roadside  communities. 8\n  The  project  will  respond  to  a  key  performance \nevaluation  report  observation  that  past  project  interventions  have  not  produced  significant \nimpacts because the \u201cpatch-and-mend\u201d approach did not result in significant improvements. The \nproject will improve specific routes through appropriately scaled reconstruction and upgrading. \n \n15. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  considerably  enhanced  through  collaboration  with \ndevelopment  partners,  particularly  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA).9  JICA \nwill finance the upgrading of the road from Dili to Baucau, which, taken together with the ADB-\nfinanced project, will result in significant improvements to land transport along the north coast.10\n \nThe  World  Bank  will  support  the  upgrading  of  the  road  from  Dili  to  Ainaro  and  is  expected  to \nprepare  its  project  during  2012.  Taken  together,  about  235  km  of  road  will  be  upgraded  with \ndevelopment partner support. \n \nB. \n \n16. \ngoods.

The \nPMU  will  be  reorganized  to  ensure  sufficient  capacity  to  manage  the  ongoing  RNDSP  and  to \ncreate sub-units for the JICA and World Bank-financed projects. JICA and the World Bank will \nensure  that  supplementary  resources  are  made  available  to  the  PMU  so  that  each  partner \nmaintains separate responsibility for major implementation inputs, and that the subprojects of all \npartners  are  efficiently  implemented.  Implementation  arrangements  will  maximize  the  use  of \ngovernment  systems.  Close  collaboration  between  development  partners  will  reduce  project \nmanagement  costs  by  facilitating  the  use  of  standardized  approaches  to  engineering  design \nstandards, and safeguards assessment and monitoring. \n \nThe PMU is headed by  a project manager and staffed with key professionals on a full-\n24. \ntime  basis,  including  a  chief  technical  advisor,  road  construction  advisor,  road  maintenance \nengineer,  financial  administrator  (currently  also  the  project  manager),  and  a  national \nenvironmental  monitoring  specialist.  Supplementary  staff  to  be  recruited  to  the  PMU  and \nfinanced  under  the  project  include  a  part-time  international  resettlement  specialist  (3  person-\nmonths);  national  resettlement  specialist  (18  person-months);  a  national  social,  gender,  and \ndevelopment  specialist  (36  person-months);  a  part-time  international  social  and  gender \ndevelopment  specialist  (3  person-months);  and  a  part-time \ninternational  environmental \nmanagement specialist (3 person-months). The PMU will be responsible for the project financial \nmanagement,  including  procurement  and  authorizing  withdrawal  applications.  The  existing \nRNDSP  design  and  supervision  consultant  will  be  responsible  for  the  detailed  engineering \ndesign of the Dili-Liquica and Tibar-Gleno subprojects (under its existing contract). A consulting \nfirm  will  be  selected  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  for  (i)  supervision  of  the \nconstruction  of  the  Dili-Liquica  and  Tibar-Gleno  subprojects,  and  (ii)  feasibility  study  and \ndetailed engineering design of the road from Manatuto to Natarbora. \n \n25.  While  the  PMU  will  undertake  the  day-to-day  project  management,  the  government\u2019s \nMajor  Projects  Secretariat  and  National  Development  Agency  will  review  subproject  quality, \ncosts, and payments. The National Development Agency, which reports to the Prime Minister\u2019s \nOffice, is a new and relatively inexperienced body. Therefore, the project will provide examples \nof international best practice through participation in regular assessments, experience of which \ncan  be  transferred  to  implementation  of  other  government  projects.  The  government\u2019s \nProcurement Commission will oversee all major procurement. \n \n26. \nthe project administration manual (PAM).15\n \n \n27. \nThe  proposed  ADB  financing  for  the  project,  even  when  combined  with  that  of  other \ndevelopment  partners  (about  $140  million  for  approval  in  2012)  is  greatly  outweighed  by  the \ngovernment\u2019s  projected  funding  for  capital  expenditure  during  2012\u20132015  of  more  than \n$500 million  per  annum.  Attributable  development  results  achievable  in  a  sector  where  the \ndemand is great will be limited. The project is suitable for scaling up through additional financing \nif assessed to be performing well. Use of additional financing will reduce incremental transaction \ncosts, improve responsiveness, and enhance development effectiveness. The original loans will, \ntherefore,  be  used  to  achieve  readiness  to  expand  the  project  through  additional  financing \npotentially with cofinancing from other development partners, by preparing designs, undertaking \nof safeguards due diligence, and building capacity. \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\n                                                \n15 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nMarch 2012\u2013December 2016  \nJune 2017 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion \ndate \nManagement \n\nagencies \n\nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting services \n\nAdvance contracting \n\nDisbursement  \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing \n\nProject steering committee \nConselho de Administracao do Fundo  Ifraestrutura  \nMinistry of Infrastructure \n\n(iv)  Implementation unit  Project Management Unit, Department of Roads Bridges and Flood Control, \n\n2 contracts \n\n$37.1 million \n\n9 staff \nInternational \ncompetitive bidding \nShopping \nQCBS \nICS \nLCS or CQS  \nAdvance contracting for (i) consulting services, (ii) civil works road upgrading \nfrom Dili to Liquica, and (iii) civil works road upgrading from Tibar to Gleno. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \n\n1 contract \n337 person-months \n8 contracts, 119 person-months \n4 contracts \n\n$0.1 million \n$5.0 million \n$1.2 million \n$0.3 million \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CQS = consultants\u2019 qualifications selection, ICS = individual consultants selection, \nLCS = least-cost selection, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nroads  will \n\nTechnical  \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\nUpgrading  of  subproject \n\n \nA. \n \n28. \ninclude  side  slope  stabilization,  drainage \nimprovement,  and  pavement  reconstruction  and  widening.  This  will  involve  construction  of \nretaining structures and use of bioengineering works for slope stabilization, improved drainage, \nand  strengthened  and  widened  road  pavements.  Widening  will  be  carried  out  only  where \ntechnically  and  economically  feasible  in  light  of  challenging  geotechnical  conditions  in  some \nlocations. There will be road safety improvements in populated areas. \n \nB. \n \n29. \nEconomic  assessment  of  the  subprojects  has  been  undertaken  utilizing  the  roads \neconomic  decision  model,  a  derivative  of  the  highway  development  and  management  model, \nwhich  is  more  suited  to  low-volume  roads  with  little  heavy  traffic.  The  two  subprojects  (Dili\u2013\nLiquica  and  Tibar\u2013Gleno)  have  been  analyzed,  based  on  the  capital  costs  estimated  after \ncompletion  of  detailed  design.  The  subprojects  were  found  to  have  a  rate  of  return  of  16%. \nSensitivity  tests  were  applied  and  the  economic  internal  rates  of  return  remained  above  10% \nunder all scenarios analyzed. 16\n \n \nC. \n \nPublic financial management (PFM) performance was assessed in June 2010 using the \n30. \npublic  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  framework.  That  analysis  found  that  solid \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n16 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nis \n\nthe  budget  coverage \n\nprogress  has  been  made  in  strengthening  PFM  systems.  The  improvements,  though  modest, \nwere  underpinned  by  real  changes  in  work  practices,  legislation,  and  information  technology \nsystems.  Notable  improvements  were  made  in  the  comprehensiveness  of  fiscal  information, \nfiscal  transparency,  funding  predictability,  timeliness,  and  quality  of  bank  reconciliations  and \nfinancial  statements.  Substantial  weaknesses  in  the  PFM  system,  however,  remain.  Relative \nstrengths  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  are  diminished  by  gaps  in  the  PFM  system \nelsewhere. An independent, supreme audit institution has not been established, internal audit is \nalmost  nonexistent, \nincomplete,  and  budget  planning  and \nimplementation  capacity  in  line  ministries  is  weak.  Orderliness  of  the  budget  process, \ndevelopment  of  sector  investment  strategies,  multiyear  budgeting,  and  procurement  are  areas \nwhere further improvement is required. \n \nCapacity  has  been  built  both  in  the  MOF  and  in  line  ministries  for  procurement,  and  a \n31. \nprocurement  unit  has  been  established  in  the  vice-prime  minister\u2019s  office.  Competitive  bidding \nas  a  standard  procurement  instrument  is  not  universal  with  government-financed  projects, \nthough  appropriate  procedures  are  accepted  and  satisfactorily  applied  for  procurement  of \ngoods,  works,  and  services  financed  by  development  partners.  Less  competitive  instruments, \nsuch  as  single-source  selection  and  use  of  quotations,  are  prevalent  for  government-financed \ncontracts, and are often legitimized by ad hoc decree legislation. There is still some way to go in \nstrengthening procurement practice to improve both transparency and efficiency, and to achieve \nan effective balance between risk and accountability. \n \n32. \nThe  Office  of  the  Inspector  General  was  established  in  2000  with  responsibility  to \noversee  use  of  government  resources.  The  Civil  Service  Act  (2004)  provides  standards, \nprinciples,  definitions,  and  guidelines  for  civil  service  administration;  a  code  of  ethics  for  civil \nservants; and an administrative disciplinary mechanism. A law creating the new Anti-Corruption \nCommission became effective in 2009 and the first anticorruption commissioner was appointed \nin 2010. However, the independence of these institutions needs to be assured and they need to \nbe resourced effectively. \n \n33. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \nThe  primary  beneficiaries  of  the  project  are  (i)  road  users,  including  vehicle  drivers  or \n34. \npassengers  and/or  nonmotorized  transport  users;  (ii)  households  living  in  communities  in  the \ncatchment areas of the upgraded road links that sell a range of cash crops and other agricultural \nproduce;  (iii)  passenger  and  goods  transport  service  providers  and  commercial  truck  drivers; \nand  (iv)  small  businesses  and  traders  including  vendors  at  local  markets,  trade  store  owners, \ncoffee  and  other  produce  buyers,  and  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  in  the  district \ncapitals and towns. Key social service providers such as in the education and health sectors will \nalso benefit from the road upgrading. \n \n35.  Women are generally excluded from infrastructure-related employment opportunities and \ndecision making related to infrastructure development. The project is classified \u201ceffective gender \nmainstreaming\u201d and is designed to ensure gender equality and allow women\u2019s empowerment by \nensuring  that  the  views  and  requirements  of  women  are  fully  considered  in  the  design  of  the \nsubprojects.  Women\u2019s  involvement  in  all  employment  and  training  opportunities  under  the \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nproject  will  be  actively  promoted. 17\n  Specifically,  the  project  will  encourage  and  facilitate \n(i) incorporation of women\u2019s views in the project design; (ii) awareness of gender and transport \nsecurity,  and  HIV/AIDS;  (iii)  a  reasonable  quota  for  women\u2019s  involvement  in  the  construction \nwork, directed toward unemployed widows, female heads of households with large numbers of \ndependents,  and  other  vulnerable  groups;  and  (iv)  a  quota  for  women\u2019s  involvement  in \nbioengineering and maintenance works. \n \nE. \n \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  and  uses  a  sector-like  approach  to \n36. \nenvironmental  management.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  and  initial \nenvironmental  examinations  (IEEs)  have  been  prepared  for  both  subprojects.  Both  the \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  and  the  IEEs  will  be  used  to  guide \ndevelopment  of  future  subproject  IEEs.  The  project\u2019s  environmental  impacts  are  minor,  site-\nspecific, and temporary. They include (i) disturbance from dust arising from loading, unloading, \nand  transportation  of  construction  materials;  (ii)  noise;  (iii)  erosion  and  sedimentation  from \nexposed surfaces during construction that may affect water courses; (iv) risks from the use and \ndisposal  of  hazardous  materials  such  as  used  fuel  and  lubricants;  and  (v)  increased  risk  of \naccidents  from  increased  vehicle  movements.  Mitigation  measures  have  been  incorporated  in \nthe subprojects, as outlined in the environmental management plans. The PMU will implement \nthe  environmental  management  plans  and  employ  a  full-time  national  environment  specialist \nand a part-time international specialist to monitor and report on progress. \n \n37. \nResettlement. The project is classified category B. The upgrading of roads will involve \nwidening  and  will  require  additional  land.  The  government  has  endorsed  a  resettlement \nframework, which outlines the principles and procedures to purchase land through negotiation. \nAll  resettlement  actions  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009). \nThe  design  of  the  roads  will  avoid  resettlement  impacts  wherever  possible,  and  minimize \nimpacts by exploring alternatives. The resettlement framework and resettlement plans prepared \nin accordance with the resettlement framework will aim to enhance, or at least restore, the living \nstandards  of  affected  persons;  and  improve  the  living  standards  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable \naffected persons.18\n \n \nIndigenous  persons.  The  project  is  classified  category  C.  No  significant  difference  in \n38. \nsocial or cultural identity exists among communities that will be served by the upgraded roads. \nNo ethnic minority groups are expected to be affected by the project. \n \nF. \n \n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 19\n  The  risks  can  be  managed  and  are \nmitigated  by  the  design  of  the  project.
