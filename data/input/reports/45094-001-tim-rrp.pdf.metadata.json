THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the Road Network Upgrading Project.1 \n \n2.  The  proposed  project  will  (i)  reconstruct  or  upgrade  and  climate  proof  about \n59 kilometers (km) of principal national roads, (ii) expand the road maintenance program2 of the \nMinistry of Infrastructure (MOI), and (iii) prepare a feasibility study and detailed design for 81 km \nof principal national roads. In collaboration with other development partners, the project will \nsupport the progressive upgrading of the whole of the national road network. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  A  fourfold  increase  in  government  spending  since  2006,  supported  by  offshore \npetroleum revenue, has generated strong economic momentum in Timor-Leste. Gross domestic \nproduct (excluding the petroleum sector and the contribution from the United Nations) has \ngrown at an average annual rate of 10.9% since 2006.3 The construction sector has expanded \nas public investment levels have risen. Agriculture, which accounts for most employment, has \nalso grown as productivity levels have increased and the area of land cultivated has expanded.4 \nThe road sector is in decline because of inadequate rehabilitation and maintenance. \n \n4.  The Strategic Development Plan (SDP), 2011\u20132030 aims to sustain double-digit rates of \neconomic growth and fast track economic development. The vision for 2030 is a modern and \ndiversified  economy  with  high-quality  infrastructure.  The  SDP  envisages  three  pillars  for \ndevelopment\u2014social  capital  development,  infrastructure  development,  and  economic \ndevelopment. Increased public investment over the first 5 years of the SDP is intended to create \nthe conditions necessary to attract private investment and ensure a private sector-led economy \nby 2030. Improvement of land transport is a key factor.    \n \n5.  However, the concentration of opportunity in the capital, Dili, raises concern over the \ninclusiveness of the growth process. The concentration of the economic expansion in Dili is \nencouraging rural\u2013urban migration and resulting in a high rate of youth unemployment and high \ndemands on basic services. Diversifying economic activity beyond Dili will help stem these \npressures and share the benefits of Timor-Leste\u2019s petroleum wealth more widely. This will be \nimportant if Timor-Leste aims to achieve an inclusive growth path and avoid the rising inequality \nexperienced elsewhere in Asia during episodes of rapid economic growth. \n \n6.  Roads play a vital role in the economy and country integration of Timor-Leste. Roads are \nthe primary mode of transport, carrying about 90% of passengers and 70% of freight. The core \nnetwork comprises 1,426 km of national roads and 869 km of district roads. The national road \nnetwork, linking the 13 national districts, comprises northern and southern coastal roads; and \nfive roads traversing north\u2013south, connecting the two coastal roads. The district roads link \nsecondary population centers to the national roads. The core network is supplemented by \n716 km of urban roads, most of which are in Dili. Rural roads, about 3,000 km in length, provide \naccess to villages and more remote areas. Recent surveys indicate that almost the entire core \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Asian Development Fund Grant to the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the Road Network \nDevelopment Sector Project. Manila. \n3 Real gross national income grew at 22.2% per annum on average over the same period. \n4 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "2   \nroad network is in an unmaintainable condition. Only about 8% of the core road network was \nassessed to be in fair condition, about 22% in poor condition, and about 70% in very poor \ncondition.5  The  Road  Network  Development  Sector  Project  (RNDSP),  currently  under \nimplementation, targets improving this situation (footnote 2).  \n \n7.  Transport services, for both passengers and goods, are provided by the private sector \nwith minibuses and light trucks, but services are constrained by the narrow roads and difficult \nterrain in addition to the generally poor condition of the roads. These conditions result in high \ncosts and unreliable services. Lack of regulation of the sector, lack of road safety awareness, \nand  poor  road  conditions  contribute  to  high  accident  rates.  The  vehicle  fleet  (excluding \nmotorcycles) doubled between 2005 and 2009. The motorcycle fleet experienced a threefold \nincrease. This rate of expansion is likely to continue in the short and medium term. \n \n8.  The MOI is responsible for planning, developing, and maintaining roads. The MOI\u2019s \nDirectorate  of  Roads,  Bridges,  and  Flood  Control  has  only  12  engineers\u2014seven  at  the \nheadquarters in Dili and five in regional offices. Each regional engineer is assisted by up to \n12 supervisors and assistant supervisors depending on the region. The Directorate of Roads, \nBridges, and Flood Control\u2019s shortage of capable staff, assets, and funding in the districts \nseverely limits its capacity to manage and maintain the road infrastructure. To address this skill \nshortage, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is supporting the MOI with a multiyear technical \nassistance (TA) program and Japan is funding a twinning program with the Government of \nIndonesia to focus on technical and management training for MOI engineering staff. \n \n9.  To  improve  the  performance  of  the  road  sector,  the  MOI,  assisted  by  ADB,  has \ndeveloped  the  Medium-Term  Road  Network  Development  Program,  the  implementation  of \nwhich started in 2010 with the RNDSP. The RNDSP is implementing rehabilitation and road \nmaintenance  in  three  districts  and  is  supporting  the  development  of  systematic  road \nmaintenance (footnote 2). This support will be integrated with the project, which is located in the \nsame districts. \n \n10.  Since the referendum on independence of Timor-Leste on 30 August 1999, ADB has \nbeen the lead development agency in the road transport sector. It has provided six TA projects, \nthree project grants, and one sector grant to support the road sector development. ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan, 2008\u20132010 directly tied development outcomes to the goals \nof the National Development Plan, predecessor of the SDP, which emphasized development of \ntransport infrastructure. \n \n11.  The new country partnership strategy (CPS), 2011\u201320156 continues ADB\u2019s strategic \ndirections in Timor-Leste by concentrating on infrastructure development and management. \nADB plans to provide complementary assistance in the core specializations of finance, regional \ncooperation and integration, and education, and will support the private sector as a key driver of \nchange to help Timor-Leste make the transition from a public sector-led economy.7 Support \nprovided through the CPS will help Timor-Leste achieve inclusive economic growth by helping \nto sustain a high rate of economic growth and by sharing economic opportunities across the \npopulation. ADB support for infrastructure, financial services, and skills training will help meet \nthe needs of a growing economy and improve the competitiveness of the private sector. An \nemphasis on the provision of services outside the capital will support growth of agriculture and \nthe  rural  economy.  Poverty  will  be  alleviated  through  the  benefits  of  economic  growth, \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2008.

The emphasis in the CPS on infrastructure reflects its importance to the achievement of \nthe government\u2019s development priorities for 2011\u20132015 and ADB\u2019s established presence and \ncomparative strength in infrastructure. ADB will continue in the role  established under the \nprevious  country  strategy  of  helping  to  coordinate  capacity  development  and  investment \nprogramming across infrastructure (particularly road transport, water and sanitation, and power), \nand  helping  to  mobilize  financial  resources  for  infrastructure  investment.  This  will  improve \nconnectivity, help increase the efficiency of movement of people and goods, and expand access \nto the basic services essential to development. The agriculture sector and rural areas more \nbroadly will be key beneficiaries. \n \n13.  The project will support upgrading of Timor-Leste\u2019s priority sections of the national road \nnetwork to accommodate rapid economic and social development. The project will finance high-\npriority road links identified by the Medium-Term Road Network Development Program, which \nwas prepared under ADB\u2019s TA (footnote 5). \n \n14.  Lessons from ADB\u2019s previous projects are incorporated in the project design. The main \nlessons are (i) sector approaches have been useful in allowing the government to progressively \nexpand its leadership in the road sector and in providing flexibility, (ii) sustainability requires \nattention to institutional capacity and long-term road maintenance strategies, and (iii) community \nparticipation  in  road  works  has  been  successful  in  extending  the  benefit  of  national  road \ndevelopment  to  roadside  communities.8  The  project  will  respond  to  a  key  performance \nevaluation  report  observation  that  past  project  interventions  have  not  produced  significant \nimpacts because the \u201cpatch-and-mend\u201d approach did not result in significant improvements. The \nproject will improve specific routes through appropriately scaled reconstruction and upgrading. \n \n15.  The  impact  of  the  project  will  be  considerably  enhanced  through  collaboration  with \ndevelopment partners, particularly the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).9 JICA \nwill finance the upgrading of the road from Dili to Baucau, which, taken together with the ADB-\nfinanced project, will result in significant improvements to land transport along the north coast.10 \nThe World Bank will support the upgrading of the road from Dili to Ainaro and is expected to \nprepare its project during 2012. Taken together, about 235 km of road will be upgraded with \ndevelopment partner support. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n16.  The impact of the project will be increased and more efficient movement of people and \ngoods. The outcome will be that the MOI provides a more reliable and safer road network. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n17.  Five key outputs will contribute toward achieving the project outcome and impact:  \n \n(i)  Upgrading and climate proofing. National roads will be upgraded and climate \nproofed. The roads from Dili to Liquica (28.6 km) and Tibar to Gleno (31.0 km) \n                                                \n8  ADB.  2010.

Feasibility  studies  and  detailed \ndesigns of the road from Manatuto to Natarbora (81 km) will be prepared to \nfacilitate  a  rolling  program  of  road  upgrading.  Upgrading  will  include \nstrengthening and widening existing sealed pavements from a width of generally \nless  than  4.5  meters  to  6.0  meters  and  provision  of  asphalt  surfacing. \nVulnerability to damage from severe rainfall, sea level rise, and other potential \neffects of climate change will be reduced through engineering countermeasures, \nincluding ensuring suitably sized drainage structures, raising of road levels that \nare flood-prone, and bioengineering to promote slope stability. \n(ii)  Feasibility study and detailed design. A feasibility study and detailed design \nfor the future upgrading of a priority road link will be prepared. A feasibility study \nand detailed design suitable for ADB financing will be prepared for the road from \nManatuto to Natarbora (81 km). \n(iii)  Performance-based road maintenance contracts. The civil works contractors \nwill be responsible for maintenance of the upgraded road sections for 2 years \nafter physical completion. Local contractors will be trained in performance-based \nmaintenance  and  performance-based  contracts  will  be  used  for  future \nmaintenance. \n(iv)  Road safety and transport-related social issues. Awareness of road safety \nwill be increased by implementing a community-based road safety awareness \nprogram, including an education program for schools, drivers, road users, and \nthe community; and implementing an HIV prevention program. \n(v)  Efficient  project  management.

Interest during construction for ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources (OCR) loans has been computed at the 5-year forward London interbank offered rate \nplus a spread of 0.4% and at 1.0% per year for ADB Asian Development Fund loans. Commitment charges for an \nADB OCR loan are 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed OCR loan amount. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Japan International Cooperation Agency estimates. \n \n19.  For the ADB-financed project, the government has requested a loan of $30.85 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project.11 The loan will have a 25-year \nterm, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.15% per year (the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan), \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The OCR loan from \nADB will finance civil works, consultants\u2019 services, taxes and duties, late payment charges \nimposed by suppliers and contractors, bank charges, and interest during construction on OCR \nloan.12 The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. \n \n20.  For the ADB-financed project, the government has also requested a loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR9.15 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance \nthe project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.13 The Asian Development Fund loan \nwill finance civil works, consultants\u2019 services, taxes and duties, late payment charges imposed \nby suppliers, and contractors and interest during construction on the Asian Development Fund \nloan. \n \n21.  The government will contribute $13.66 million from its Infrastructure Fund14 toward the \ncost of civil works, taxes and duties, and resettlement costs in respect of the ADB-financed \nproject. \n \n22.  The financing plan (including for collaboratively financed components) is in Table 2.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  The existing ADB-financed PMU within the MOI will manage project implementation. The \nPMU will be reorganized to ensure sufficient capacity to manage the ongoing RNDSP and to \ncreate sub-units for the JICA and World Bank-financed projects. JICA and the World Bank will \nensure that supplementary resources are made available to the PMU so that each partner \nmaintains separate responsibility for major implementation inputs, and that the subprojects of all \npartners are efficiently implemented. Implementation arrangements will maximize the use of \ngovernment systems. Close collaboration between development partners will reduce project \nmanagement costs by facilitating the use of standardized approaches to engineering design \nstandards, and safeguards assessment and monitoring. \n \n24.  The PMU is headed by a project manager and staffed with key professionals on a full-\ntime basis, including a chief technical advisor, road construction advisor, road maintenance \nengineer,  financial  administrator  (currently  also  the  project  manager),  and  a  national \nenvironmental  monitoring  specialist.  Supplementary  staff  to  be  recruited  to  the  PMU  and \nfinanced under the project include a part-time international resettlement specialist (3 person-\nmonths); national resettlement specialist (18 person-months); a national social, gender, and \ndevelopment  specialist  (36  person-months);  a  part-time  international  social  and  gender \ndevelopment  specialist  (3  person-months);  and  a  part-time  international  environmental \nmanagement specialist (3 person-months). The PMU will be responsible for the project financial \nmanagement,  including  procurement  and  authorizing  withdrawal  applications.  The  existing \nRNDSP design and supervision consultant will be  responsible for the detailed engineering \ndesign of the Dili-Liquica and Tibar-Gleno subprojects (under its existing contract). A consulting \nfirm  will  be  selected  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  for  (i)  supervision  of  the \nconstruction  of  the  Dili-Liquica  and  Tibar-Gleno  subprojects,  and  (ii)  feasibility  study  and \ndetailed engineering design of the road from Manatuto to Natarbora. \n \n25.  While the PMU will undertake the day-to-day project management, the government\u2019s \nMajor Projects Secretariat and National Development Agency will review subproject quality, \ncosts, and payments. The National Development Agency, which reports to the Prime Minister\u2019s \nOffice, is a new and relatively inexperienced body. Therefore, the project will provide examples \nof international best practice through participation in regular assessments, experience of which \ncan  be  transferred  to  implementation  of  other  government  projects.  The  government\u2019s \nProcurement Commission will oversee all major procurement. \n \n26.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual (PAM).15 \n \n27.  The proposed ADB financing for the project, even when combined with that of other \ndevelopment partners (about $140 million for approval in 2012) is greatly outweighed by the \ngovernment\u2019s  projected  funding  for  capital  expenditure  during  2012\u20132015  of  more  than \n$500 million per annum. Attributable development results achievable in a sector where the \ndemand is great will be limited. The project is suitable for scaling up through additional financing \nif assessed to be performing well. Use of additional financing will reduce incremental transaction \ncosts, improve responsiveness, and enhance development effectiveness. The original loans will, \ntherefore, be used to achieve readiness to expand the project through additional financing \npotentially with cofinancing from other development partners, by preparing designs, undertaking \nof safeguards due diligence, and building capacity. \n \n                                                \n15 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  March 2012\u2013December 2016  \nEstimated completion  June 2017 \ndate \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project steering committee \n(ii)  Executing agency  Conselho de Administracao do Fundo  Ifraestrutura  \n(iii) Key implementing  Ministry of Infrastructure \nagencies \n(iv) Implementation unit  Project Management Unit, Department of Roads Bridges and Flood Control, \n9 staff \nProcurement  International  2 contracts  $37.1 million \ncompetitive bidding \n  Shopping  1 contract  $0.1 million \nConsulting services  QCBS  337 person-months  $5.0 million \nICS  8 contracts, 119 person-months  $1.2 million \nLCS or CQS   4 contracts  $0.3 million \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting for (i) consulting services, (ii) civil works road upgrading \nfrom Dili to Liquica, and (iii) civil works road upgrading from Tibar to Gleno. \nDisbursement   The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CQS = consultants\u2019 qualifications selection, ICS = individual consultants selection, \nLCS = least-cost selection, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n28.  Upgrading  of  subproject  roads  will  include  side  slope  stabilization,  drainage \nimprovement,  and  pavement  reconstruction  and  widening.  This  will  involve  construction  of \nretaining structures and use of bioengineering works for slope stabilization, improved drainage, \nand  strengthened  and  widened  road  pavements. Widening  will  be  carried  out  only  where \ntechnically and economically feasible in light of challenging geotechnical conditions in some \nlocations. There will be road safety improvements in populated areas. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n \n29.  Economic  assessment  of  the  subprojects  has  been  undertaken  utilizing  the  roads \neconomic decision model, a derivative of the highway development and management model, \nwhich is more suited to low-volume roads with little heavy traffic. The two subprojects (Dili\u2013\nLiquica and Tibar\u2013Gleno) have been analyzed, based on the capital costs estimated after \ncompletion of detailed design. The subprojects were found to have a rate of return of 16%. \nSensitivity tests were applied and the economic internal rates of return remained above 10% \nunder all scenarios analyzed.16 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n30.  Public financial management (PFM) performance was assessed in June 2010 using the \npublic  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  framework.  That  analysis  found  that  solid \n                                                \n16 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \nprogress has been made in strengthening PFM systems. The improvements, though modest, \nwere underpinned by real changes in work practices, legislation, and information technology \nsystems. Notable improvements were made in the comprehensiveness of fiscal information, \nfiscal transparency, funding predictability, timeliness, and quality of bank reconciliations and \nfinancial statements. Substantial weaknesses in the PFM system, however, remain. Relative \nstrengths  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  are  diminished  by  gaps  in  the  PFM  system \nelsewhere. An independent, supreme audit institution has not been established, internal audit is \nalmost  nonexistent,  the  budget  coverage  is  incomplete,  and  budget  planning  and \nimplementation  capacity  in  line  ministries  is  weak.  Orderliness  of  the  budget  process, \ndevelopment of sector investment strategies, multiyear budgeting, and procurement are areas \nwhere further improvement is required. \n \n31.  Capacity has been built both in the MOF and in line ministries for procurement, and a \nprocurement unit has been established in the vice-prime minister\u2019s office. Competitive bidding \nas  a  standard  procurement  instrument  is  not  universal  with  government-financed  projects, \nthough  appropriate  procedures  are  accepted  and  satisfactorily  applied  for  procurement  of \ngoods, works, and services financed by development partners. Less competitive instruments, \nsuch as single-source selection and use of quotations, are prevalent for government-financed \ncontracts, and are often legitimized by ad hoc decree legislation. There is still some way to go in \nstrengthening procurement practice to improve both transparency and efficiency, and to achieve \nan effective balance between risk and accountability. \n \n32.  The  Office  of  the  Inspector  General  was  established  in  2000  with  responsibility  to \noversee  use  of  government  resources.  The  Civil  Service  Act  (2004)  provides  standards, \nprinciples, definitions, and guidelines for civil service administration; a code of ethics for civil \nservants; and an administrative disciplinary mechanism. A law creating the new Anti-Corruption \nCommission became effective in 2009 and the first anticorruption commissioner was appointed \nin 2010. However, the independence of these institutions needs to be assured and they need to \nbe resourced effectively. \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n34.  The primary beneficiaries of the project are (i) road users, including vehicle drivers or \npassengers and/or nonmotorized transport users; (ii) households living in communities in the \ncatchment areas of the upgraded road links that sell a range of cash crops and other agricultural \nproduce; (iii) passenger and goods transport service providers and commercial truck drivers; \nand (iv) small businesses and traders including vendors at local markets, trade store owners, \ncoffee  and  other  produce  buyers,  and  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  in  the  district \ncapitals and towns. Key social service providers such as in the education and health sectors will \nalso benefit from the road upgrading. \n \n35.  Women are generally excluded from infrastructure-related employment opportunities and \ndecision making related to infrastructure development. The project is classified \u201ceffective gender \nmainstreaming\u201d and is designed to ensure gender equality and allow women\u2019s empowerment by \nensuring that the views and requirements of women are fully considered in the design of the \nsubprojects.  Women\u2019s  involvement  in  all  employment  and  training  opportunities  under  the \n ", "9 \nproject  will  be  actively  promoted.17  Specifically,  the  project  will  encourage  and  facilitate \n(i) incorporation of women\u2019s views in the project design; (ii) awareness of gender and transport \nsecurity, and HIV/AIDS; (iii) a reasonable quota for women\u2019s involvement in the construction \nwork, directed toward unemployed widows, female heads of households with large numbers of \ndependents,  and  other  vulnerable  groups;  and  (iv)  a  quota  for  women\u2019s  involvement  in \nbioengineering and maintenance works. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n36.  Environment. The project is classified category B and uses a sector-like approach to \nenvironmental management. An environmental assessment and review framework and initial \nenvironmental  examinations  (IEEs)  have  been  prepared  for  both  subprojects.  Both  the \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  and  the  IEEs  will  be  used  to  guide \ndevelopment of future subproject IEEs. The project\u2019s environmental impacts are minor, site-\nspecific, and temporary. They include (i) disturbance from dust arising from loading, unloading, \nand transportation of construction materials; (ii) noise; (iii) erosion and sedimentation from \nexposed surfaces during construction that may affect water courses; (iv) risks from the use and \ndisposal of hazardous materials such as used fuel and lubricants; and (v) increased risk of \naccidents from increased vehicle movements. Mitigation measures have been incorporated in \nthe subprojects, as outlined in the environmental management plans. The PMU will implement \nthe environmental management plans and employ a full-time national environment specialist \nand a part-time international specialist to monitor and report on progress. \n \n37.  Resettlement. The project is classified category B. The upgrading of roads will involve \nwidening  and  will  require  additional  land.  The  government  has  endorsed  a  resettlement \nframework, which outlines the principles and procedures to purchase land through negotiation. \nAll resettlement actions will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \nThe  design  of  the  roads  will  avoid  resettlement  impacts  wherever  possible,  and  minimize \nimpacts by exploring alternatives. The resettlement framework and resettlement plans prepared \nin accordance with the resettlement framework will aim to enhance, or at least restore, the living \nstandards of affected persons; and improve the living standards of the poor and vulnerable \naffected persons.18 \n \n38.  Indigenous persons. The project is classified category C. No significant difference in \nsocial or cultural identity exists among communities that will be served by the upgraded roads. \nNo ethnic minority groups are expected to be affected by the project. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.19 The risks can be managed and are \nmitigated by the design of the project. The intended benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh the costs.  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLand acquisition delays the  Resettlement  plans have  been prepared  in consultation  with  affected \ncommencement of civil  persons prior to commencement of civil works.

ASSURANCES \n \n40.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents. \n \n41.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the loan agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n42.
