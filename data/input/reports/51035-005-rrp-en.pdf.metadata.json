It will enable the Government of PNG to protect core funding for essential \nhealth  and  other  basic  services,  and  adequately  resource  the  government\u2019s  immediate \ncoronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  response  during  a  period  of  sharp  fiscal  tightening.  Policy \nreforms  will  improve  the  effective  and  efficient  use  of  available  public  resources  in  the  health \nsector and beyond. The program supports the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030 \noperational priorities of (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities through support \nto  universal  health  coverage;  (ii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality  through  gender \nmainstreaming;  and  (iii)  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity  through  PFM, \nexpenditure and fiscal policies, and adequate fiscal space for service delivery. 2 \n\n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProgrammatic approach. The program comprises investment and policy-based lending \ncomponents,  using  a  programmatic  approach  with  three  subprograms,  which  aligns  ADB\u2019s \nsupport with the government\u2019s reform program over the medium term. 3 The program components \nreinforce  each  other:  policy  actions  support  an  improved  operational  context  to  increase  the \nbenefits  from  health  sector  investments,  while  the  health  sector  investments  support  the \nimplementation  of  priority  policies.  The  program  supports  reforms  to  improve  (i)  whole-of-\ngovernment  fiscal  management  and  national  PFM;  (ii)  institutional  arrangements,  regulatory \nframeworks,  and  PFM  performance  for  subnational  health  service  delivery;  and  (iii)  critical \nnationwide health service delivery components. Subprogram 1, comprising a $95 million project \ninvestment  and  a  $100  million  policy-based  loan,  was  approved  in  May  2018;  and  additional \nproject  grant  financing  of  $38  million  from  the  Government  of  Australia  was  approved  in \nJune 2018. 4  Subprogram  2,  with  a  $100  million  policy-based  loan,  was  approved  in \nNovember 2019. 5 When the programmatic approach was approved in 2018, the loan amount for \nsubprogram  3  was  planned  to  be  $100  million.  However,  in  light  of  the  economic  and  fiscal \nimpacts  of  COVID-19  and  the  resulting  expenditure  pressures,  the  proposed  loan  amount  for \nsubprogram 3 is to be increased by $50 million (from $100 million to $150 million) to support the \n\n \n\n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.

This raises the program\u2019s total policy-\nbased financing from $300 million to $350 million across the three subprograms. \n \n4. \nSubprogram 1 laid strong foundations, including a medium-term fiscal strategy (MTFS); \nPFM legislative reform; a procurement policy; the rollout of an integrated financial management \nsystem (IFMS); the setting up of a provincial health authority (PHA); 6 direct funding of PHAs; and \naddressing  urgent  issues  in  medical  supplies  procurement,  enabling  comprehensive  reform \ndialogue  and  decision-making  under  subsequent  subprograms.  Subprogram  2  continued  with \nnational  budget,  PFM,  and  public  procurement  reforms;  pharmaceutical  procurement  reform; \nestablishment and strengthening of PHAs; and health partnership management and monitoring. \nAll actions achieved  during subprograms 1 and 2 continue to be complied with. Subprogram 3 \ncompletes reforms initiated under subprograms 1 and 2, and lays the foundation for future reforms, \nincluding  continued  PFM  reforms  and  public  salary  management. 7  The  inclusion  of  a  post-\nprogram  partnership  framework  (P3F),  supported  by  the  program\u2019s  project  component  and \nongoing technical assistance (TA) activities, will enable ADB to continue supporting reforms. The \ninvestment component will upgrade 17 health facilities (including medical equipment), with a focus \non  gender-responsive  essential  health  service  provision  in  underserviced  rural  areas; \nsystematically  developing  PHA  human  resources  capacity;  and  revamping  medical  supplies \nprocurement and distribution.  \n \nDevelopment context. PNG is a lower middle-income country, with gross national income \n5. \nper capita of $2,685 in 2019. 8 An extensive subsistence  economy and subdued private sector \nactivity have created a narrow economic base that is highly reliant on global commodity prices for \nthe country\u2019s natural resources exports. Frequent external shocks\u2014including the sharp downturn \nin global commodity prices in 2015\u20122016, a large earthquake in 2018, the impacts of COVID-19, \nand the fall in oil and gas prices in the first quarter of 2020\u2014have undermined the country\u2019s human \ndevelopment and economic performance. PNG has the lowest life expectancy in the Pacific region, \nand infant and  maternal mortality  rates  are higher  than in countries with similar income levels. \nChronic diseases, including stroke and heart disease, dominate the burden of disease, which also \nincludes  poverty-related  illnesses  such  as  pneumonia  and  neonatal  conditions. 9  PNG  had \nreported 602 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and seven deaths as of 16 November 2020. 10 While \nthe direct health impacts of COVID-19 have been low, they are expected to rise given the increase \nin cases since July 2020. Indirect health impacts, as well as the economic and fiscal impacts of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, are estimated to be severe, undermining an already fragile economy. \n \n6. \nRecent  economic  performance  and shock.  The sharp downturn in global commodity \nprices in 2015 and 2016, coinciding with a severe drought that affected mining and agriculture, \nled to a rapidly worsening macroeconomic situation in PNG. The implementation of the required \nsharp fiscal consolidation reduced aggregate demand, leading to a severe economic crisis that \nwas aggravated by an earthquake in early 2018. Together, this pushed down growth to \u20130.8% of \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2018  (Table  1).  With  the  restoration  of  gas,  oil,  and  mining \nproduction, combined with an uptake in business activity, growth rebounded to an estimated 5.0% \nof GDP in 2019. Before the COVID-19 shock, growth was expected to stabilize at 2%\u20123% of GDP \n\n \n\n6  PHAs  bring  together  hospital  and  primary  health  service  delivery  under  one  authority,  which  facilitates  less \nfragmented  planning,  funding,  and  delivery  of  provincial  health  services.  PHAs  have  financial  autonomy  from \nprovincial governments and are guided by the PHA board, which includes community and women\u2019s representatives. \n7   The Program Policy Matrix (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) shows all the policy actions \n\nacross the three subprograms.  \n\n8    ADB. 2020.

The economy is projected to recover from 2021 onward, but impacts could be more severe \ndepending on the duration of the pandemic and further infection waves, which would directly affect \nPNG as well as lead to a prolonged global economic downturn.  \n \n\nTable 1: Selected Economic and Fiscal Indicators  \n(% of GDP, unless otherwise indicated)  \n\nItem  \n\n2018   2019  \n\n2021  \n\n2022  \n\n2023   2024  \n\n 3.3  \n 4.0  \n \n 16.4  \n 15.3  \n 19.6  \n 11.7  \n 5.4  \n 7.9  \n (3.2) \n 51.7  \n 28.4  \n 29.2  \n\n 2.5  \n 3.8  \n \n 15.1  \n 14.0  \n 20.4  \n 13.8  \n 6.6  \n 6.6  \n (5.3) \n 51.0  \n 26.2  \n 24.7  \n\n2020   \nPre- \nCOVID-19  \n 2.1  \n 3.8  \n \n 15.3  \n 14.3  \n 20.3  \n 13.5  \n 5.9  \n 6.8  \n (5.0) \n 40.3  \n 18.5  \n 26.9  \n\n2020    \nWith \nCOVID-19  \n (2.9) \n 3.3  \n \n 14.0  \n 12.8  \n 22.2  \n 14.3  \n 7.1  \n 7.9  \n (8.2) \n 49.8  \n 23.6  \n 23.3  \n\nProjection  \n 3.2  \n 2.6  \n 4.0  \n 4.0  \n \n \n 16.2  \n 15.6  \n 15.1  \n 14.5  \n 19.8  \n 20.1  \n 12.3  \n 12.8  \n 5.5  \n 5.7  \n 7.5  \n 7.3  \n (3.7) \n (4.5) \n 52.6  \n 52.5  \n 28.0  \n 27.0 \n 27.2  \n 25.9  \n\nReal GDP growth (% change)  \nChange in CPI (% annual average)  \nCentral government budget  \n  Total revenue  \n\n  \n (0.8) \n 4.7  \n \n 17.8  \nof which: tax and nontax revenue   15.5 \n 20.4  \n 14.5  \n 6.6  \n 5.9  \n (2.6) \n38.3 \n 15.2  \n 24.0  \n\n  \n 5.0  \n 3.6  \n \n 16.2  \n 14.1  \n 21.1  \n 13.9  \n 6.4  \n 7.2  \n (4.9) \n 39.8  \n 17.0  \n 25.0  \n\n  Total expenditure  \n    Recurrent  \n      of which: wages and salaries  \n    Capital  \n  Fiscal balance  \nPublic debt  \n   of which: external debt  \nNominal GDP ($ billion)  \n( ) = negative, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPI = consumer price index, GDP = gross domestic product.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates, Government of Papua New Guinea, and International Monetary Fund.  \n \n7. \nFiscal  situation  and  shock.  The  pandemic  hit  PNG  during  a  period  of  high  fiscal \nconsolidation  pressures,  in  which  the  government  aimed  to  achieve  a  primary  surplus  in  the \nmedium term to reduce public debt to below 40% of GDP. The COVID-19 shock will particularly \naffect domestic resource mobilization, with total revenue as a share of GDP in 2020 expected to \nbe 1.3 percentage points lower than pre-COVID-19 estimates (Table 1). Coupled with the need \nfor  direct  expenditure  measures  of  about  $200  million  to  support  the  preparedness  for  and \nresponse to COVID-19 as well as to provide economic stimulus to support hard-hit small private \nsector  businesses, this is expected to increase the fiscal deficit from 5.0% to  8.2% of GDP in \n2020. 12 While the fiscal deficit is projected to decline to 3.2% of GDP by 2023, this is substantially \nabove the pre-COVID-19 target of 1.9% of GDP. The debt\u2013GDP ratio is affected through both the \nincrease in financing needs and the fall in GDP; and is expected to increase to 49.8% of GDP in \n2020,  up  from  39.8%  of  GDP  in  2019.  Over  the  medium  term,  rebounding  growth  as  well  as \nrevenue and expenditure reforms are expected to stabilize debt levels at 52.6% of GDP in 2023, \nbefore leading to a gradual reduction toward 40.0% of GDP in the long term (in line with the Fiscal \nResponsibility Act, as amended in 2019). 13 Despite the increase in debt levels in the context of \n\n \n\n11 International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2020.

Ongoing  lack  of  fiscal  space  and  cash  flow \nshortages, resulting from the macroeconomic and fiscal crises of past years and aggravated by \nthe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, continue to threaten the funding of essential services. \nEnsuring the  delivery of  essential services requires continued political commitment to prioritize \nlimited  resources;  improved  expenditure  control  and  effectiveness,  particularly  in  the  areas  of \nprocurement, payroll, and subnational PFM systems; and increased  performance of the public \nservice. Development constraints in the areas of fiscal policy and national PFM systems that are \naddressed through the  program  are  (i) an unsustainable  fiscal position that  risks leaving basic \nservice delivery unfunded, (ii) PFM legislation gaps, (iii) weak national budget documentation that \nhinders transparent  resourcing  of policy priorities  and legislative  and public scrutiny, (iv) weak \nnational procurement systems, and (v) loose personal emoluments spending. \n \n9. \nHealth sector constraints. Despite health being a priority, and the government spending \nsubstantial resources in the sector, improvements in the access to and quality of health services \nand health outcomes have been slower than in comparator countries. Medical supplies are often \nnot available, the health workforce is insufficient and underperforming, and most health facilities \nare poorly maintained. Indirect health impacts from the COVID-19 emergency, including through \nredirected  resources  and  deferred  preventive  and  curative  health  services  for  other  diseases, \naggravate these constraints and their impacts on health outcomes. Development constraints in \nPNG\u2019s health sector specifically addressed under this program are (i) the prioritization of scarce \nfiscal  resources  for  essential  health  services;  (ii)  complex  and  inconsistent  subnational  health \nsystem architecture; (iii) fragmented fund flows; (iv) weak PFM of PHAs; (v) weak pharmaceutical \nprocurement, distribution, and stock management systems; (vi) incomplete and outdated health \ndata  and  limited  analysis  undermining  evidence-based  decision-making;  and  (vii)  incomplete \nemergency response frameworks and organizational arrangements. 15 \n \nB. \n \n10. \nGovernment  strategy.  The  country\u2019s  cascading  strategic  planning  framework\u2014\nincorporating the PNG Vision 2050; the Development Strategic Plan, 2010\u20132030; and the Medium \nTerm  Development  Plan  III,  2018\u20132022\u2014outlines  PNG\u2019s  strong  commitment  to  effective \nleadership, good governance, performance management, and accountability, aiming to provide \nservice delivery and, ultimately, improved quality of life. 16 These high-level plans are implemented \nthrough strategies  and  reform plans, including (i) the National Health Plan, 2011\u20122020 (with a \nnew plan for 2021\u20122030 under development); (ii) an MTFS that provides the framework for the \nannual budget; (iii) the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Road Map, 2015\u2012\n2018 (a new road map will be developed based on the new PEFA assessment); and (iv) a PFM \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n \n\n14 IMF. 2020.

Port Moresby. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fstrategy for the subnational level, which aims to strengthen PFM and enhance service delivery in \nprovinces  and  districts. 17 Since  the  start  of  the  program\u2019s  policy  dialogue  in  early  2017,  the \ngovernment has shown a commitment to safeguarding funding for essential health services and \nother  social  expenditure.  Health  spending  has  benefited  from  expenditure  prioritization, \nincreasing from 5.9% of total government spending in 2015 to 10.1% in 2019, and it is expected \nto remain above 10% in 2020 (budget of 10.4%). 18  \n \n11. \nGovernment COVID-19 response. Following PNG\u2019s first confirmed COVID-19 case on \n20  March  2020,  the  government  declared  a  state  of  emergency  and  enforced  several  key \nmeasures,  including  grounding  all  international  and  domestic  flights  and  suspending  public \ntransport  and  the  movement  of  people  between  provinces.  Schools  were  suspended, \nnonessential  employees  asked  to  remain  at  home  and  maintain  social  distancing,  and  mass \ngatherings  prohibited.  The  Department  of  Health  (DOH)  led  the  preparation  of  a  2-year \nEmergency Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19, which complements the National \nHealth  Plan  in  many  areas,  such  as  training  and  human  resources  management,  extending \ncommunity  outreach  and  surveillance  programs,  and  scaling  up  laboratories  to  test  for \ntuberculosis and severe acute respiratory illnesses (including COVID-19). The plan requires $270 \nmillion direct health sector expenditure  to prepare for, respond to, contain, and mitigate COVID-\n19  outbreaks. 19  Priority  areas  include  clinical  management  services,  surveillance  and  rapid \nresponse teams, infection prevention, point-of-entry preparedness, laboratory capacity, logistics, \nnon-pharmaceutical interventions, and community risk communications. \n \n12. \nImplementation constraints. Shortcomings in policy and institutional performance risk \nundermining the implementation of reforms. The record of progress against these issues has been \nmixed, with reform implementation risks stemming from the complex political economy and limited \ninternal  capacities.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  is  further  undermining  the  ability  of  the  public \nadministration  to  deliver  on  planned  reforms.  This  emphasizes  the  need  for  strategic,  highly \nprioritized,  and  sequenced  reform  plans;  and  strengthening  of  governance  arrangements  and \ndownstream reform implementation capacities. Given these factors, the program supports reform \nprioritization, sequencing, and implementation; the alignment of development partner assistance; \nand incentivized reform implementation  (in addition to addressing the financing  needs  of basic \nservices).  Some  policy  actions  are  administrative,  which  is  critical  in  light  of  implementation \nconstraints  to  ensure  that  regulatory  frameworks  are  translated  into  changes  in  practices  and \nultimately lead to improved performance and outcomes. 20  \n \n13. \nADB engagement.  Subprogram 3 is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nPNG,  2016\u20132020,  supporting  its  priority  areas  of  improving  public  financial  management  for \nservice delivery, and increasing the quantity, quality and inclusivity of essential services, including \nhealth. 21 It continues to support the implementation of PNG\u2019s strategic planning framework and \nsector  reform  plans  (para.  10).  The  targeted  effect  of  the  reforms  is  a  more  sustainable  and \nefficient health care system. Subprogram 3 implements critical national and subnational reforms, \nbuilding on reform progress made under the first two subprograms.  \n\n \n\n17 Government  of  PNG.  2010.

The  program  team  developed  policy  actions  and  a  P3F  in  close \n14. \nconsultation with the government (Appendix 4). ADB and development partner TA has facilitated \nthe government\u2019s most critical reform endeavors. 22  In developing subprogram 3 indicative actions \ninto  final  policy  actions,  attention  was  given  to  increasing  the  strength  and  specificity  of  each \naction; adding actions to support the government\u2019s COVID-19 response (para. 24); and reflecting \nstrong  momentum  on  gender  mainstreaming  through  gender-responsive  budgeting  (GRB) \ntraining and data collection and the electronic national health information system (eNHIS) rollout. \nThe implementation of four of the 16 indicative actions was partially affected by COVID-19-related \nrestrictions,  preventing  travel  and  stakeholder  consultations  in  recent  months,  and  resulted  in \nlesser  milestones being  met.  The PEFA assessment process saw minor  delays, as  the PEFA \nSecretariat  endorsed  the  national  PEFA  report  and  it  is  pending  publication;  the  PHA  annual \nreport template was only completed in June 2020 for use in the 2020 annual reports; a gender \nanalysis  could  not  be  completed,  as  consultant  recruitment  was  affected;  and  the  PHA  audit \nreports will be published in late 2020 after tabling in Parliament. All changes are elaborated in the \nSummary  of  Changes  from  Indicative  Actions. 23  Increased  specificity  of  indicative  actions, \nadditional  actions  on  GRB  training  and  pharmaceutical  procurement  planning,  two  additional \nactions on the eNHIS, and six additional actions supporting the government\u2019s response to COVID-\n19 have ensured that the overall strength of reforms has been increased. All 26 of the final reform \nactions in subprogram 3 have been completed. \n \nIncreased subprogram 3 loan amount. The programmatic approach provides flexibility \n15. \nto respond to emerging opportunities and constraints. In subprogram 3, this includes supporting \nthe  government\u2019s  rapid  response  to  the  impacts  of  COVID-19,  as  outlined  in  the  COVID-19 \npreparedness and response plan, for which the government  has  requested  an increase in  the \nADB loan amount for subprogram 3 from $100 million to $150 million. As elaborated below, the \ngovernment has achieved additional policy actions to support effective emergency preparedness \nfor and response to COVID-19, as well as future pandemics and other health emergencies, with \nsupport from ADB and other development partners. Together with additional new policy actions \nsupporting gender mainstreaming and the health information system, these actions have led to \nan improvement in the overall accomplishments of subprogram 3. 24 \n  \n16. \nReform area 1: National frameworks and public financial management enhanced. \nActions  completed  under  subprogram  3  sought  to  build  a  stronger  financial  management \nfoundation  to  support  improved  health  services  delivery,  and  more  broadly,  the  delivery  of  all \ngovernment  services.  With  the  negative  economic  impacts  of  COVID-19,  a  strengthened \nframework has proved valuable to ensure accurate and efficient distribution of limited resources. \n \n17. \nThe government aligned the 2020 budget with the prudential fiscal targets set out in the \nMTFS, initially developed under subprogram 1. 25 The targets included the continued safeguarding \n\n \n\n22 ADB.  2011.

The Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014\u2012aligned budget book format in 2019 \nwas enhanced through the reorganization of budget agencies into government sectors, and the \nremoval of economic classification tables at the activity level to streamline information and shift \nthe strategic focus to the program level. 30 A strategic sector budget summary for health was trialed \nin  2020  and  will  be  included  in  the  2021  budget.  This  will  support  budget  transparency  and \naccountability to Parliament and the public. The P3F supports gradual gender mainstreaming of \nPNG\u2019s  national  budget,  including  gender  analysis  of  the  2021  budget  and  an  improved \nparticipatory  budgeting  process  for  2021.  The  Department  of  Finance  (DOF)  updated  the \ngovernment financial management manual to incorporate recent legislative changes supported \nunder subprograms 1 and 2, and the financial instructions for the district and provincial service \nimprovement program grants. The Public Finances (Management) (Amendment) Act, 2018 was \npublished with other financial instructions on the DOF website. 31 To improve PFM performance, \nthe  DOF,  with  support  from  partners  including  ADB,  has  completed  (i)  a  national  PEFA \nassessment that the PEFA Secretariat has approved (through a \u201cPEFA Check\u201d), and (ii) drafts of \ntwo subnational PEFA assessments. Subprogram 3 has also continued reforms to improve the \ntransparency and efficiency of national procurement systems, including the operationalization of \nthe new National Procurement Commission Board and the Authority to Pre-Commit Committee; \nthe approval of foundational procurement frameworks, training, controls, and guides; and the in-\nprinciple approval of an e-procurement system for implementation. Under the P3F, these reforms \nwill  be  continued  through  (i)  the  completion  of  four  subnational  PEFA  assessments;  (ii)  the \n\n \n\nverification before a phased clearance approach), and (iv) revised GDP numbers based on extensive consultations \nwith the National Statistical Office, the Bank of Papua New Guinea, and the IMF. The debt and revenue targets of \nthe FY2020 budget and its MTFS will not be achievable because of the severe external COVID-19 shock. \n\n26 Key  enablers  are  health,  education,  law  and  order,  and  infrastructure  (including  reliable,  clean,  and  affordable \nenergy), as well as support to develop the private sector through improved trade and investment, financial inclusion \nand  credit  facilitation,  and  strengthened  performance  of  state-owned  enterprises  and  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises.

As part of the transition, two budget books are being prepared to allow the \npublic administration, members of Parliament, and the public to compare information and familiarize themselves with \nthe new formats. The government plans to phase out the standard budget book in 2021. \n\n31 The Financial Management Manual was published, but is unavailable on the website while new updates are being \n\nadded. The DOF intends to publish the new version as soon as the updates are complete. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fdevelopment of new national and subnational PFM road maps based on the PEFA assessment; \n(iii) the revision of the administrative guidelines for the service improvement program grants to \naddress shortcomings in project selection, design, and quality assurance; (iv) other key reforms \nidentified in the PFM road map; and (v) further national procurement reform plan implementation.  \n \n19. \nFollowing the  addition  of a new indicative action to improve public payroll management \nunder subprogram 2, the DOT introduced regular payroll management reports, cash flow forecast \nreporting,  and  an  improved  forecasting  process  that  will  provide  a  three-way  reconciliation \nprocess for agencies to estimate realistic personnel emolument forecasts. These are initial steps \nto bring the personnel emolument budget under control, which has seen regular and substantial \noverspending in the past, and risks crowding out other budget items critical for service delivery. \nThis is particularly relevant in the health sector with its substantial number of staff. Under the P3F, \nthe government will complete an independent audit of public employment and payroll practices, \ndevelop a comprehensive and time-bound reform plan, and start to implement key reform plan \nmeasures. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, the government allocated K600 million for \nemergency  response,  including  for  the  health  sector  and  security.  It  also  issued  financial \ninstructions for the prudent and accountable use of these resources, and improved transparency \nthrough  public  disclosure  of  information  on  COVID-19-related  emergency  procurement. 32 \nParliament passed the National Pandemic Act, 2020, which came into force in June 2020. The \nAct  establishes  a  comprehensive  framework  for  a  more  effective  national  response  to  future \npandemics,  pestilences,  and  other  public  health  emergencies.  The  P3F  supports  the \nappropriation of resources for effective implementation of the emergency response plan, as part \nof any supplementary budget and the 2021 regular budget, supported by ADB TA.33 Further, the \ngovernment has committed to provide a consolidated report on emergency procurement and an \nindependent audit of the emergency response following the end of the state of emergency.  \n \n20. \nReform  area  2:  Subnational  health  system  management  strengthened.  Actions \ncompleted under subprogram 3 sought to strengthen provincial institutional arrangements  and \noperations (including planning and budgeting) in the health sector, as well as continue to improve \nthe flow of funds to the provincial health sector and the capacity to monitor the use of these funds. \nThe investment component of the program will reinforce these actions by emphasizing building \nthe capacity of the PHA boards and staff to manage the sector. \n\n \n21. \nUnder subprogram 3, the DOH established the final four PHAs, completing the target for \nPHAs set out under subprogram 2. With this, all provinces (except for the Autonomous Region of \nBougainville) have consistent and strengthened institutional arrangements for subnational health \nservice  delivery.  To  maintain  a  reliable  source  of  funding  for  PHAs,  the  2020  national  budget \ncontinues  to provide  direct transfers, including  health  function grants as well as provincial  and \ndistrict hospital funding, to PHAs as instituted under subprogram 1. This will be sustained in the \n2021 national budget under the P3F. To strengthen the performance and responsiveness of PHAs, \nthe DOH developed additional modules of the PHA manual covering health PFM, including GRB, \nand carried out GRB training of PHA boards and executives in all provinces. 34 The PHA manual \nalso includes a new annual report template for 2020 annual reports, which will take advantage of \nthe accessibility to standard sex-disaggregated data across all PHAs.35 To ensure that relevance \nand effectiveness of PHA budgets, all PHAs published budgets capturing all resources for health \n\n \n\n32 The action to strengthen accountability of emergency procurement is aligned with the prior action of the IMF\u2019s Rapid \nCredit Facility. The same is the case for the procurement report and the independent audit included under the P3F. \n\n33 ADB. 2016. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for Supporting Public Financial Management (Phase 3). \n34 In total, 87 board members and executives were trained, including 23 women. \n35 The  DOH  originally  planned  to  approve  this  for  use  by  PHAs  for  their  2019  annual  reports,  but  consultations \n\nscheduled for March 2020 had to be postponed because of the COVID-19 mitigation measures. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fservice delivery, and, to ensure the sustainability of health facilities, allocated resources for the \nmaintenance of  hospital and lower level health facilities. 36 To track their financial performance, \nPHAs provided 2019 midyear reports as well as 2018 annual reports (including sex-disaggregated \ndata on health service delivery and outcomes), with midyear budget execution reports informing \na health expenditure review and subsequent nonfinancial instructions in the 2020 national budget. \nUnder the P3F, the improvement of practices and capacity will continue with project support under \nthe program through (i) the completion of additional modules of the PHA manual, including asset \nmanagement, internal audit, and facility supervision; (ii) the finalization of PHA annual reports for \n2019; (iii) the rollout of  the IFMS to  all remaining PHAs; and (iv) the  rollout of and training on \nimproved PFM processes  and formats  based on the PHA manual. To close the accountability \nloop, the Auditor General\u2019s Office audited five PHAs. Audits of remaining PHAs will continue under \nthe P3F and will be tabled in Parliament and published on the Auditor General\u2019s Office website.  \n \n22. \nReform  area  3:  Health  service  delivery  components  strengthened.  Subprogram  3 \ncontinued  to  work  on  improving  the  efficiency  of  the  procurement  and  distribution  of  medical \nsupplies.  To  identify  areas  for  improved  performance  and  efficiency,  the  DOH  completed  an \nindependent assessment of the supply chain network and the logistics management information \nsystem through the firm contracted under subprogram 2. The recommendations of the resulting \nassessment report were  endorsed by the technical working group  on  pharmaceutical supplies \n(established under subprogram 2) and  the Minister of Health. Further, the DOH approved a  2-\nyear procurement plan and budget and a 10-year procurement master plan to provide strategic \ndirection and longer-term certainty for reform implementation. Under the P3F, with the support of \nthe project component of the program, the key recommendations will be implemented, and the \nfirst-year activities of the 2-year procurement plan and budget completed. \n \n23. \nTwo  new  policy  actions  were  added  under  subprogram  3,  focused  on  the  eNHIS. \nFollowing  an independent review, to enhance the collection and  availability  of national health-\nrelated information, the eNHIS was endorsed as the official, national system for health information \ncollection; and a firm  was contracted to implement tablet-based data entry in the remaining 14 \nprovinces and the management of the eNHIS system for 5 years. To improve understanding of \nthe health needs of underrepresented groups, data collection in PHAs was expanded to include \nage- and sex-disaggregated data, including on interpersonal physical violence. 37 Under the P3F, \nthe rollout of the eNHIS will be completed with project support in all provinces, and dashboards \nand preconfigured reports will be implemented that allow real-time monitoring of health service \ndelivery and outcomes to inform policy and management decision-making. \n \nA new set of actions to support the COVID-19 health emergency response was added. \n24. \nThe DOH\u2019s Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19 was approved to guide \nnational preparedness and response measures, including in relation to incident management and \nplanning,  surveillance,  risk  assessment,  and  rapid  response.  The  National  Interagency \nCoordination  Taskforce  was  established  to  oversee  the  plan\u2019s  implementation.  The  Disaster \nManagement  Clusters,  including  the  Protection  Cluster  and  the  Gender-Based  Violence  Sub-\ncluster,  were  activated;  and  all  22  provinces  activated  their  Provincial  Emergency  Operations \nCentres. Development partners have been mobilized to coordinate  and support the COVID-19 \nresponse  countrywide.  To  implement  the  plan\u2019s  immediate  actions,  the  government  disbursed \nK23.3  million  to  the  health  sector  support  package,  including  appropriately-sized  personal \n\n \n\n36 This includes maintenance funding for facilities providing maternal and child health services that are available across \nall facility levels as per the national health service standards.

In the remaining 14 provinces, data are collected using \n\npaper at the point of service and inputted into the eNHIS centrally. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nprotective  equipment  for  health  workers  and  gender-sensitive  COVID-19  communication  and \ncommunity engagement plans. Lastly, the eNHIS and the Go.Data system of the World Health \nOrganization (WHO) were rapidly adapted for better disease surveillance, particularly in high-risk \nareas. 38  Under  the  P3F,  the  government  committed  to  progress  the  implementation  of  the \nimmediate measures of the plan and to enhance disease surveillance capabilities nationwide. \n \n25. \nADB value addition. The mutually reinforcing project investment, reform implementation, \nand financing provided under the program maximize ADB\u2019s value addition. The interdepartmental \ntechnical working group set up has proven to be a valuable forum for central and line agencies to \ndiscuss coordination and prioritization issues beyond the program. ADB\u2019s TA continues to provide \nsupport on  macroeconomic and fiscal  policy design, strategy development, budget  reform  and \ndebt management, and procurement reform (footnote 33). The project leads the health PFM and \npharmaceutical procurement reform assistance. ADB prepared a detailed health sector financing \nanalysis as part of ADB\u2019s support to fragile and conflict-affected situations, which has informed \nreform specification and implementation under subprograms 2 and 3. \n \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  ADB  works  closely  with  the  Government  of \n26. \nAustralia,  the  European  Union,  the  IMF,  and  the  World  Bank  to  support  the  government  in \nstrengthening  its  macroeconomic  policy  and  PFM.  The  IMF  and  the  World  Bank  continue  to \nprovide  assistance  on  domestic  resource  mobilization,  and  monetary  and  fiscal  policy  advice. \nAustralia  provides  budget  financing  as  well  as  support  in  PFM,  health  sector  reform,  and \ndecentralization.  The  European  Union  supports  national  procurement  reform  and  the  PEFA \nassessment  and  road  map  development.  The  PFM  working  group  meets  quarterly,  as  do  the \nhealth development partners. For the COVID-19 response, activities are closely coordinated with \nWHO through the cluster meetings it coordinates. \n \nC. \n \nThe  program  contributes  to  PNG\u2019s  overarching  development  objective  to  provide \n27. \naffordable, accessible, equitable, and high-quality health services for all citizens. The reforms are \nexpected to increase fiscal sustainability by supporting reductions in the fiscal deficit and public \ndebt\u2013GDP levels by 2022, in line with annual targets outlined in the MTFS. This task has become \nmore  challenging  because  of  the  COVID-19  shock,  but  gradual  reductions  are  expected  from \n2021 onward (from the higher baseline). Preventing funding cuts for essential health services and \nincreasing the national budget resources available for the health sector remains a major impact \nof  the  program.  National  and  health  sector-specific  reforms  are  expected  to  increase  the \navailability  of  funds,  and  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  resource  use  along  the  service \ndelivery  chain.  Reforms  are  expected  to  help  increase  the  average  annual  provincial  health \nexpenditure  as a  proportion of estimated  need to  at least 80%, and improve the availability of \nessential medical supplies by substantially reducing stockouts by 2023\u20122024 (Appendix 1). This \nwill contribute to improved services that reduce major direct costs of disease, including (i) the loss \nof healthy life expectancy and adult  earning power;  (ii) medical treatment costs contributing to \npotential catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditures, which can significantly affect the consumption \nof other necessities and push families into poverty; and (iii) the opportunity costs of caretakers for \nsick  family  members.  The  program  impact  assessment  estimates  that  a  20%  reduction  in \ndisability-adjusted life years lost through common conditions could result in economic savings of \nup to 2%\u20134% of gross national income ($400 million\u2013$800 million) annually.39 \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n38 Go.Data is an outbreak investigation tool for field data collection during public health emergencies.

Of  the  pre-COVID-19  net  external  financing  needs  of  almost  $1.0  billion,  ADB-supported \nbudget financing was programmed at $500 million, comprising this subprogram ($100 million), the \nfirst subprogram of the State-Owned Enterprises Reform Program ($100 million), and commercial \nborrowing  ($300  million)  supported  by  a  policy-based  guarantee. 40  However,  in  view  of  the \nCOVID-19  impact  on  market  conditions,  commercial  borrowing  was  postponed  to  2021.  In \nrecognition of the specific health sector expenditure demands placed by COVID-19 this program \nprovides  an  additional  $50  million  to  fund  COVID-19-related  expenditures,  including  the \nimplementation of health-related activities of the Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan \nfor COVID-19 and the strengthening of border and quarantine facilities as part of the government\u2019s \neconomic stimulus package. The broader economic impacts of COVID-19, both through reduced \nrevenues  and  increased  expenditures  especially  to  support  businesses,  are  being  mitigated \nthrough  government\u2019s  COVID-19  response  plan,  for  which  various  development  partners  are \nproviding support: (i) ADB\u2019s COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option  of $250 million is planned; \n(ii) the  IMF  approved  $364  million  as  part  of  its  Rapid  Credit  Facility;  (iii)  the  World  Bank  has \napproved an additional $20 million; (iv) and other partners, including the governments of Australia \nand Japan, are considering further support to cover the financing gap.  \n \n\nTable 2: Development Financing Needs in 2020 \n($ million) \n\n \n\nItem \nRevenue and Grants \nExpenditure \n\nof which: directly COVID-19 related \n\nBudget balance \nTotal budget financing needed \n\nDrawdown from cash balance \nNet domestic borrowing \nNet external borrowing \n\nADB-supported budget financing (gross) \n\nHealth Services Sector Development Program \nState-Owned Enterprises Reform Program \nPolicy-based guarantee supported commercial borrowing \nCOVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \n\nInternational Monetary Fund Rapid Credit Facility (gross) \nOthersa (net) \n\nPre-COVID \n 4,146  \n 5,508  \n 0  \n (1,362) \n 1,362  \n\n 0    \n\n 370  \n 992  \n 500  \n 100  \n 100  \n 300  \n0 \n 0    \n\n 492  \n\nPost-COVID \n 3,453  \n 5,403  \n 445  \n (1,950) \n 1,950  \n 131  \n 566  \n 1,253  \n 500  \n 150  \n 100  \n\n 0    \n\n 250  \n 364  \n 389  \n\nChange \n (693) \n (105) \n 445  \n (588) \n 588  \n 131  \n 196  \n 261  \n\n 0    \n\n 50  \n\n 0    \n (300) \n 250  \n 364  \n (103) \n\n( ) = negative, ADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease. \na  This  includes  financing  provided  by  ADB  project  investments,  the  Government  of  Australia,  the  Government  of \n\nJapan, and the World Bank, among others; and factors in loan repayment, including to ADB. \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates, Government of Papua New Guinea, and International Monetary Fund. \n\n \n29. \nThe  government  has  requested  (i)  a  regular  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital resources; and (ii) a concessional loan of $50 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nin  each  case  to  help  finance  subprogram  3.  This  is  an  increase  of  $50  million  on  the  initially \nplanned amount and reflects additional financing needs for the COVID-19 health sector response. \n\n40 ADB.

Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity is 9.25 years, \nand there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The concessional loan will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2.0% per year during the grace period and \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nE. \n \n30. \nThe implementation  period for subprogram 3 is September 2019\u2013December 2020.  The \npreparation  and  completion  of  policy  actions  for  subprogram  3  was  carried  out  from \nSeptember 2019 to June 2020. The DOT is the executing agency. The DOF and the DOH are the \nimplementing agencies. The proceeds of the policy-based loans will be withdrawn in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n31. \nFollowing  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  subprogram  3  is  classified \ncategory C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Program activities \nwill be confined to policy and institutional reforms. No activity will result in or lead to involuntary \nresettlement, or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n32. \nGender.  Subprogram  3  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and  focuses  on \n(i) supporting sustainable financial and health system management approaches to provide better \nquality health services for all and improve women\u2019s access to reproductive health services and \nhigh-quality maternal and child health facilities and services, and (ii) supporting women and girls \nduring  COVID-19.  Policy  actions  include  (i) prioritizing  health  sector  budget  allocations,  with \nspecific  focus  on  ensuring  budget  for  maternity,  child  health,  reproductive  health,  and  family \nplanning services; (ii) supporting women in decision-making roles in the health sector by ensuring \nthat at least one (out of nine) of the board of directors for each PHA is a woman; and (iii) a number \nof GRB actions, including the approval of GRB modules of the PHA manual, GRB training for PHA \nboards  and  executives  in  all  22  provinces,  and  systematic  collection  of  age-  and  sex-\ndisaggregated  data  and  data  on  interpersonal  physical  violence  at  the  PHA  level  to  inform \nplanning of  effective health programs. The P3F continues these reforms, including through the \npublication  of  a  gender  analysis  of  the  2021  budget  and  an  improved  participatory  budgeting \nprocess for 2021, involving consultations with women and other civil society stakeholder groups. \nCOVID-19  gender  actions  include  (i) weekly  coordination  meetings  of  the  United Nations \nGovernment  Protection  cluster  and  gender-based  violence  subcluster;  (ii) personal  protective \nequipment for health workers; (iii) gender-sensitive communication and community engagement \nplans, with targeted messaging on COVID-19 and pregnancy and breastfeeding, gender-based \nviolence, and sexual and reproductive rights; and (iv) a COVID-19 ministerial instruction stating \nthat all other health services must continue to be delivered to communities despite the pandemic.  \n \nPromoting  good  governance and strengthening PFM  are key government priorities,  but \n33. \nsystems  and  capacities  remain  fragile.  Despite  this,  the  government  is  assessed  to  have  the \nability  to  implement  its  budget,  which  is  integral  to  the  program\u2019s  success.  The  program, \ncomplemented by development partner TA, contributes to the gradual reduction of critical fiduciary \nrisks,  including  through  procurement  reform,  the  implementation  of  the  IFMS,  and  support  to \nsubnational PFM systems. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3 and \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\fdescribed  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 41 ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \n\nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nProlonged COVID-19 \ncontainment measures and \nglobal economic downturn  \nHealth funding flows do not \nreach health facilities \nProcurement corruption \nand collusion \nLow quality of accounting, \nfinancial reporting, and \nmonitoring \n\nMitigation Measures \nThe government prepared a supplementary budget and a revised medium-term fiscal \nstrategy.
