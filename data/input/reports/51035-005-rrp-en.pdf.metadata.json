THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed policy-\nbased loans to Papua New Guinea (PNG) for subprogram 3 of the Health Services Sector \nDevelopment Program.1  \n \n2.  Subprogram 3 supports enhanced national frameworks and public financial management \n(PFM), improved subnational health system  management, and strengthened health service \ndelivery components. It will enable the Government of PNG to protect core funding for essential \nhealth  and  other  basic  services,  and  adequately  resource  the  government\u2019s  immediate \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) response during a period of sharp fiscal tightening. Policy \nreforms will improve the effective and efficient use of available public resources in the health \nsector and beyond. The program supports the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030 \noperational priorities of (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities through support \nto  universal  health  coverage;  (ii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality  through  gender \nmainstreaming;  and  (iii)  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity  through  PFM, \nexpenditure and fiscal policies, and adequate fiscal space for service delivery.2 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Programmatic approach. The program comprises investment and policy-based lending \ncomponents, using a programmatic  approach with three subprograms, which  aligns ADB\u2019s \nsupport with the government\u2019s reform program over the medium term.3 The program components \nreinforce each other: policy actions support an improved operational context to increase the \nbenefits  from  health  sector  investments,  while  the  health  sector  investments  support  the \nimplementation of priority policies. The  program supports reforms to improve  (i) whole-of-\ngovernment fiscal management and national PFM; (ii) institutional arrangements, regulatory \nframeworks, and PFM performance for subnational health service delivery; and  (iii) critical \nnationwide health service delivery components. Subprogram 1, comprising a $95 million project \ninvestment and a $100 million policy-based loan, was approved in May 2018; and additional \nproject  grant  financing  of  $38  million  from  the  Government  of  Australia  was  approved  in \nJune 2018. 4  Subprogram  2,  with  a  $100  million  policy-based  loan,  was  approved  in \nNovember 2019.5 When the programmatic approach was approved in 2018, the loan amount for \nsubprogram 3 was planned to be $100 million. However, in light of the economic and fiscal \nimpacts of COVID-19 and the resulting expenditure pressures, the proposed loan amount for \nsubprogram 3 is to be increased by $50 million (from $100 million to $150 million) to support the \n \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.

This raises the program\u2019s total policy-\nbased financing from $300 million to $350 million across the three subprograms. \n \n4.  Subprogram 1 laid strong foundations, including a medium-term fiscal strategy (MTFS); \nPFM legislative reform; a procurement policy; the rollout of an integrated financial management \nsystem (IFMS); the setting up of a provincial health authority (PHA);6 direct funding of PHAs; and \naddressing urgent issues in medical supplies procurement, enabling comprehensive reform \ndialogue and decision-making under subsequent subprograms. Subprogram 2 continued with \nnational budget, PFM, and public procurement reforms; pharmaceutical procurement reform; \nestablishment and strengthening of PHAs; and health partnership management and monitoring. \nAll actions achieved during subprograms 1 and 2 continue to be complied with. Subprogram 3 \ncompletes reforms initiated under subprograms 1 and 2, and lays the foundation for future reforms, \nincluding continued PFM reforms and public salary management.7 The inclusion of a post-\nprogram partnership framework  (P3F), supported by the program\u2019s project component  and \nongoing technical assistance (TA) activities, will enable ADB to continue supporting reforms. The \ninvestment component will upgrade 17 health facilities (including medical equipment), with a focus \non  gender-responsive  essential  health  service  provision  in  underserviced  rural  areas; \nsystematically developing PHA human resources capacity; and revamping medical supplies \nprocurement and distribution.  \n \n5.  Development context. PNG is a lower middle-income country, with gross national income \nper capita of $2,685 in 2019.8 An extensive subsistence economy and subdued private sector \nactivity have created a narrow economic base that is highly reliant on global commodity prices for \nthe country\u2019s natural resources exports. Frequent external shocks\u2014including the sharp downturn \nin global commodity prices in 2015\u20122016, a large earthquake in 2018, the impacts of COVID-19, \nand the fall in oil and gas prices in the first quarter of 2020\u2014have undermined the country\u2019s human \ndevelopment and economic performance. PNG has the lowest life expectancy in the Pacific region, \nand infant and maternal mortality rates are higher than in countries with similar income levels. \nChronic diseases, including stroke and heart disease, dominate the burden of disease, which also \nincludes  poverty-related illnesses such  as  pneumonia and neonatal conditions.9 PNG had \nreported 602 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and seven deaths as of 16 November 2020.10 While \nthe direct health impacts of COVID-19 have been low, they are expected to rise given the increase \nin cases since July 2020. Indirect health impacts, as well as the economic and fiscal impacts of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, are estimated to be severe, undermining an already fragile economy. \n \n6.  Recent economic performance and shock. The sharp downturn in global commodity \nprices in 2015 and 2016, coinciding with a severe drought that affected mining and agriculture, \nled to a rapidly worsening macroeconomic situation in PNG. The implementation of the required \nsharp fiscal consolidation reduced aggregate demand, leading to a severe economic crisis that \nwas aggravated by an earthquake in early 2018. Together, this pushed down growth to \u20130.8% of \ngross domestic product (GDP) in 2018 (Table 1). With the restoration of gas, oil, and mining \nproduction, combined with an uptake in business activity, growth rebounded to an estimated 5.0% \nof GDP in 2019. Before the COVID-19 shock, growth was expected to stabilize at 2%\u20123% of GDP \n \n6 PHAs bring together hospital and primary health service delivery under one authority, which facilitates less \nfragmented planning, funding, and delivery of provincial health services. PHAs have financial autonomy from \nprovincial governments and are guided by the PHA board, which includes community and women\u2019s representatives. \n7  The Program Policy Matrix (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) shows all the policy actions \nacross the three subprograms.  \n8   ADB. 2020.

The economy is projected to recover from 2021 onward, but impacts could be more severe \ndepending on the duration of the pandemic and further infection waves, which would directly affect \nPNG as well as lead to a prolonged global economic downturn.  \n \nTable 1: Selected Economic and Fiscal Indicators  \n(% of GDP, unless otherwise indicated)  \nItem   2018   2019   2020    2020     2021   2022   2023   2024  \nPre-  With \n      COVID-19   COVID-19   Projection  \nReal GDP growth (% change)    (0.8)   5.0    2.1    (2.9)   2.5    2.6    3.2    3.3  \nChange in CPI (% annual average)    4.7    3.6    3.8    3.3    3.8    4.0    4.0    4.0  \nCentral government budget                  \n  Total revenue    17.8    16.2    15.3    14.0    15.1    15.6    16.2    16.4  \nof which: tax and nontax revenue   15.5   14.1    14.3    12.8    14.0    14.5    15.1    15.3  \n  Total expenditure    20.4    21.1    20.3    22.2    20.4    20.1    19.8    19.6  \n    Recurrent    14.5    13.9    13.5    14.3    13.8    12.8    12.3    11.7  \n      of which: wages and salaries    6.6    6.4    5.9    7.1    6.6    5.7    5.5    5.4  \n    Capital    5.9    7.2    6.8    7.9    6.6    7.3    7.5    7.9  \n  Fiscal balance    (2.6)   (4.9)   (5.0)   (8.2)   (5.3)   (4.5)   (3.7)   (3.2) \nPublic debt   38.3   39.8    40.3    49.8    51.0    52.5    52.6    51.7  \n   of which: external debt    15.2    17.0    18.5    23.6    26.2    27.0   28.0    28.4  \nNominal GDP ($ billion)    24.0    25.0    26.9    23.3    24.7    25.9    27.2    29.2  \n( ) = negative, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPI = consumer price index, GDP = gross domestic product.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates, Government of Papua New Guinea, and International Monetary Fund.  \n \n7.  Fiscal situation and shock. The pandemic hit PNG during a period of high fiscal \nconsolidation pressures, in which the government aimed to achieve a primary surplus in the \nmedium term to reduce public debt to below 40% of GDP. The COVID-19 shock will particularly \naffect domestic resource mobilization, with total revenue as a share of GDP in 2020 expected to \nbe 1.3 percentage points lower than pre-COVID-19 estimates (Table 1). Coupled with the need \nfor direct expenditure measures of about $200 million to support the preparedness for and \nresponse to COVID-19 as well as to provide economic stimulus to support hard-hit small private \nsector businesses, this is expected to increase the fiscal deficit from 5.0% to 8.2% of GDP in \n2020.12 While the fiscal deficit is projected to decline to 3.2% of GDP by 2023, this is substantially \nabove the pre-COVID-19 target of 1.9% of GDP. The debt\u2013GDP ratio is affected through both the \nincrease in financing needs and the fall in GDP; and is expected to increase to 49.8% of GDP in \n2020, up from 39.8% of GDP in 2019. Over the medium term, rebounding growth as well as \nrevenue and expenditure reforms are expected to stabilize debt levels at 52.6% of GDP in 2023, \nbefore leading to a gradual reduction toward 40.0% of GDP in the long term (in line with the Fiscal \nResponsibility Act, as amended in 2019).13 Despite the increase in debt levels in the context of \n \n11 International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2020.

Washington, DC. \n ", "4 \nCOVID-19, which led to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) raising the risk of debt distress \nfrom moderate to high, public debt is expected to remain manageable, supported by sound \nmacroeconomic policies and renewed fiscal consolidation.14 Concessional financing and reform \nsupport from the international community\u2014including ADB, Australia, Japan, and the World Bank, \nas well as the IMF through a Staff-Monitored Program and its Rapid Credit Facility\u2014play an \ninstrumental role in supporting the government. \n \n8.  Public financial management issues. Ongoing lack of fiscal space and cash flow \nshortages, resulting from the macroeconomic and fiscal crises of past years and aggravated by \nthe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, continue to threaten the funding of essential services. \nEnsuring the delivery of essential services requires continued political commitment to prioritize \nlimited resources; improved expenditure control and effectiveness, particularly in the areas of \nprocurement, payroll, and subnational PFM systems; and increased performance of the public \nservice. Development constraints in the areas of fiscal policy and national PFM systems that are \naddressed through the program are (i) an unsustainable fiscal position that risks leaving basic \nservice delivery unfunded, (ii) PFM legislation gaps, (iii) weak national budget documentation that \nhinders transparent resourcing of policy priorities and legislative and public scrutiny, (iv) weak \nnational procurement systems, and (v) loose personal emoluments spending. \n \n9.  Health sector constraints. Despite health being a priority, and the government spending \nsubstantial resources in the sector, improvements in the access to and quality of health services \nand health outcomes have been slower than in comparator countries. Medical supplies are often \nnot available, the health workforce is insufficient and underperforming, and most health facilities \nare poorly maintained. Indirect health impacts from the COVID-19 emergency, including through \nredirected resources and deferred preventive and curative health services for other diseases, \naggravate these constraints and their impacts on health outcomes. Development constraints in \nPNG\u2019s health sector specifically addressed under this program are (i) the prioritization of scarce \nfiscal resources for essential health services; (ii) complex and inconsistent subnational health \nsystem architecture; (iii) fragmented fund flows; (iv) weak PFM of PHAs; (v) weak pharmaceutical \nprocurement, distribution, and stock management systems; (vi) incomplete and outdated health \ndata and limited analysis undermining evidence-based decision-making; and (vii) incomplete \nemergency response frameworks and organizational arrangements.15 \n \nB.

Health  spending  has  benefited  from  expenditure  prioritization, \nincreasing from 5.9% of total government spending in 2015 to 10.1% in 2019, and it is expected \nto remain above 10% in 2020 (budget of 10.4%).18  \n \n11.  Government COVID-19 response. Following PNG\u2019s first confirmed COVID-19 case on \n20 March 2020, the government declared a state of emergency and enforced several key \nmeasures, including grounding all  international and domestic flights and suspending public \ntransport  and  the  movement  of  people  between  provinces.  Schools  were  suspended, \nnonessential employees asked to remain at home and maintain social distancing, and mass \ngatherings  prohibited.  The  Department  of  Health  (DOH)  led  the  preparation  of  a  2-year \nEmergency Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19, which complements the National \nHealth Plan in many areas, such as training and human resources management, extending \ncommunity  outreach  and  surveillance  programs,  and  scaling  up  laboratories  to  test  for \ntuberculosis and severe acute respiratory illnesses (including COVID-19). The plan requires $270 \nmillion direct health sector expenditure  to prepare for, respond to, contain, and mitigate COVID-\n19 outbreaks.19 Priority areas include clinical management services, surveillance and rapid \nresponse teams, infection prevention, point-of-entry preparedness, laboratory capacity, logistics, \nnon-pharmaceutical interventions, and community risk communications. \n \n12.  Implementation constraints. Shortcomings in policy and institutional performance risk \nundermining the implementation of reforms. The record of progress against these issues has been \nmixed, with reform implementation risks stemming from the complex political economy and limited \ninternal capacities. The COVID-19 pandemic is further undermining the ability of the public \nadministration to deliver on planned reforms. This emphasizes the need for strategic, highly \nprioritized, and sequenced reform plans; and strengthening of governance arrangements and \ndownstream reform implementation capacities. Given these factors, the program supports reform \nprioritization, sequencing, and implementation; the alignment of development partner assistance; \nand incentivized reform implementation (in addition to addressing the financing needs of basic \nservices). Some policy actions are administrative, which is critical in light of implementation \nconstraints to ensure that regulatory frameworks are translated into changes in practices and \nultimately lead to improved performance and outcomes.20  \n \n13.  ADB engagement.  Subprogram 3 is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nPNG, 2016\u20132020, supporting its priority areas of improving public financial management for \nservice delivery, and increasing the quantity, quality and inclusivity of essential services, including \nhealth.21 It continues to support the implementation of PNG\u2019s strategic planning framework and \nsector reform plans (para. 10). The targeted effect of the reforms is a more sustainable and \nefficient health care system. Subprogram 3 implements critical national and subnational reforms, \nbuilding on reform progress made under the first two subprograms.  \n \n17 Government of PNG. 2010.

The  program  team  developed  policy  actions  and  a  P3F  in  close \nconsultation with the government (Appendix 4). ADB and development partner TA has facilitated \nthe government\u2019s most critical reform endeavors.22  In developing subprogram 3 indicative actions \ninto final policy actions, attention was given to increasing the strength and specificity of each \naction; adding actions to support the government\u2019s COVID-19 response (para. 24); and reflecting \nstrong  momentum  on  gender  mainstreaming  through  gender-responsive  budgeting  (GRB) \ntraining and data collection and the electronic national health information system (eNHIS) rollout. \nThe implementation of four of the 16 indicative actions was partially affected by COVID-19-related \nrestrictions, preventing travel and stakeholder consultations in recent months, and resulted in \nlesser milestones being met. The PEFA assessment process saw minor delays, as the PEFA \nSecretariat endorsed the national PEFA report and it is pending publication; the PHA annual \nreport template was only completed in June 2020 for use in the 2020 annual reports; a gender \nanalysis could not be completed, as consultant recruitment was affected; and the PHA audit \nreports will be published in late 2020 after tabling in Parliament. All changes are elaborated in the \nSummary of Changes from Indicative Actions.23 Increased specificity of indicative actions, \nadditional actions on GRB training and pharmaceutical procurement planning, two additional \nactions on the eNHIS, and six additional actions supporting the government\u2019s response to COVID-\n19 have ensured that the overall strength of reforms has been increased. All 26 of the final reform \nactions in subprogram 3 have been completed. \n \n15.  Increased subprogram 3 loan amount. The programmatic approach provides flexibility \nto respond to emerging opportunities and constraints. In subprogram 3, this includes supporting \nthe government\u2019s rapid response to the impacts of COVID-19, as outlined in the COVID-19 \npreparedness and response plan, for which the government has requested an increase in the \nADB loan amount for subprogram 3 from $100 million to $150 million. As elaborated below, the \ngovernment has achieved additional policy actions to support effective emergency preparedness \nfor and response to COVID-19, as well as future pandemics and other health emergencies, with \nsupport from ADB and other development partners. Together with additional new policy actions \nsupporting gender mainstreaming and the health information system, these actions have led to \nan improvement in the overall accomplishments of subprogram 3.24 \n  \n16.  Reform area 1: National frameworks and public financial management enhanced. \nActions  completed  under  subprogram  3  sought  to  build  a  stronger  financial  management \nfoundation to support improved health services delivery, and more broadly, the delivery of all \ngovernment  services.  With  the  negative  economic  impacts  of  COVID-19,  a  strengthened \nframework has proved valuable to ensure accurate and efficient distribution of limited resources. \n \n17.

The updates (i) revised debt \nstock valuation (previously excluded), (ii) included contingent liabilities, (iii) took stock of payment arrears (under \n \n ", "7 \nof expenditures on key enablers,26 including essential health services that improve women\u2019s \naccess to reproductive health services and high-quality maternal and child health facilities and \nservices.27 Following a recalibration exercise in 2019, including a revaluation of the debt stock \nthat brought substantial state-owned enterprise liabilities into official debt figures, public debt at \nthe end of 2019 was estimated to be 39.8% of GDP and\u2015before the COVID-19 shock\u2015expected \nto peak at 42.4% in 2021 before gradually decreasing to below 40.0%.28 With the COVID-19 \nimpacts still unfolding, ADB TA supported the government in developing (i) a supplementary \nbudget for 2020 that provides, in a prudent manner, adequate funding for health emergency \nresponse and essential services as well as the economic recovery from the impacts of the COVID-\n19 pandemic; and (ii) an updated MTFS that reflects COVID-19 impacts and provides a path \ntoward fiscal sustainability in the medium to long term.29 \n \n18.  The Department of Treasury (DOT) has continued to improve its budget processes and \nformats. The Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014\u2012aligned budget book format in 2019 \nwas enhanced through the reorganization of budget agencies into government sectors, and the \nremoval of economic classification tables at the activity level to streamline information and shift \nthe strategic focus to the program level.30 A strategic sector budget summary for health was trialed \nin 2020 and will be included in the 2021 budget. This will support budget transparency and \naccountability to Parliament and the public. The P3F supports gradual gender mainstreaming of \nPNG\u2019s  national  budget,  including  gender  analysis  of  the  2021  budget  and  an  improved \nparticipatory  budgeting  process  for  2021.  The  Department  of  Finance  (DOF)  updated  the \ngovernment financial management manual to incorporate recent legislative changes supported \nunder subprograms 1 and 2, and the financial instructions for the district and provincial service \nimprovement program grants. The Public Finances (Management) (Amendment) Act, 2018 was \npublished with other financial instructions on the DOF website.31 To improve PFM performance, \nthe  DOF,  with  support  from  partners  including  ADB,  has  completed  (i)  a  national  PEFA \nassessment that the PEFA Secretariat has approved (through a \u201cPEFA Check\u201d), and (ii) drafts of \ntwo subnational PEFA assessments. Subprogram 3 has also continued reforms to improve the \ntransparency and efficiency of national procurement systems, including the operationalization of \nthe new National Procurement Commission Board and the Authority to Pre-Commit Committee; \nthe approval of foundational procurement frameworks, training, controls, and guides; and the in-\nprinciple approval of an e-procurement system for implementation. Under the P3F, these reforms \nwill be continued through (i) the completion of four subnational PEFA assessments; (ii) the \n \nverification before a phased clearance approach), and (iv) revised GDP numbers based on extensive consultations \nwith the National Statistical Office, the Bank of Papua New Guinea, and the IMF. The debt and revenue targets of \nthe FY2020 budget and its MTFS will not be achievable because of the severe external COVID-19 shock. \n26 Key enablers are health, education, law and order, and infrastructure (including reliable, clean, and affordable \nenergy), as well as support to develop the private sector through improved trade and investment, financial inclusion \nand credit facilitation, and strengthened performance of state-owned enterprises and small and medium-sized \nenterprises.

Following the addition of a new indicative action to improve public payroll management \nunder subprogram 2, the DOT introduced regular payroll management reports, cash flow forecast \nreporting, and  an improved forecasting process that will provide a  three-way reconciliation \nprocess for agencies to estimate realistic personnel emolument forecasts. These are initial steps \nto bring the personnel emolument budget under control, which has seen regular and substantial \noverspending in the past, and risks crowding out other budget items critical for service delivery. \nThis is particularly relevant in the health sector with its substantial number of staff. Under the P3F, \nthe government will complete an independent audit of public employment and payroll practices, \ndevelop a comprehensive and time-bound reform plan, and start to implement key reform plan \nmeasures. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, the government allocated K600 million for \nemergency  response,  including  for  the  health  sector  and  security.  It  also  issued  financial \ninstructions for the prudent and accountable use of these resources, and improved transparency \nthrough  public  disclosure  of  information  on  COVID-19-related  emergency  procurement. 32 \nParliament passed the National Pandemic Act, 2020, which came into force in June 2020. The \nAct establishes a comprehensive framework for a more effective national response to future \npandemics,  pestilences,  and  other  public  health  emergencies.  The  P3F  supports  the \nappropriation of resources for effective implementation of the emergency response plan, as part \nof any supplementary budget and the 2021 regular budget, supported by ADB TA.33 Further, the \ngovernment has committed to provide a consolidated report on emergency procurement and an \nindependent audit of the emergency response following the end of the state of emergency.  \n \n20.  Reform  area  2:  Subnational  health  system  management  strengthened.  Actions \ncompleted under subprogram 3 sought to strengthen provincial institutional arrangements and \noperations (including planning and budgeting) in the health sector, as well as continue to improve \nthe flow of funds to the provincial health sector and the capacity to monitor the use of these funds. \nThe investment component of the program will reinforce these actions by emphasizing building \nthe capacity of the PHA boards and staff to manage the sector. \n \n21.  Under subprogram 3, the DOH established the final four PHAs, completing the target for \nPHAs set out under subprogram 2. With this, all provinces (except for the Autonomous Region of \nBougainville) have consistent and strengthened institutional arrangements for subnational health \nservice delivery. To maintain a reliable source of funding for PHAs, the 2020 national budget \ncontinues to provide direct transfers, including health function grants as well as provincial and \ndistrict hospital funding, to PHAs as instituted under subprogram 1. This will be sustained in the \n2021 national budget under the P3F. To strengthen the performance and responsiveness of PHAs, \nthe DOH developed additional modules of the PHA manual covering health PFM, including GRB, \nand carried out GRB training of PHA boards and executives in all provinces.34 The PHA manual \nalso includes a new annual report template for 2020 annual reports, which will take advantage of \nthe accessibility to standard sex-disaggregated data across all PHAs.35 To ensure that relevance \nand effectiveness of PHA budgets, all PHAs published budgets capturing all resources for health \n \n32 The action to strengthen accountability of emergency procurement is aligned with the prior action of the IMF\u2019s Rapid \nCredit Facility. The same is the case for the procurement report and the independent audit included under the P3F. \n33 ADB. 2016. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for Supporting Public Financial Management (Phase 3). \n34 In total, 87 board members and executives were trained, including 23 women. \n35 The DOH originally planned to approve this for use by PHAs for their 2019 annual reports, but consultations \nscheduled for March 2020 had to be postponed because of the COVID-19 mitigation measures. \n ", "9 \nservice delivery, and, to ensure the sustainability of health facilities, allocated resources for the \nmaintenance of hospital and lower level health facilities.36 To track their financial performance, \nPHAs provided 2019 midyear reports as well as 2018 annual reports (including sex-disaggregated \ndata on health service delivery and outcomes), with midyear budget execution reports informing \na health expenditure review and subsequent nonfinancial instructions in the 2020 national budget. \nUnder the P3F, the improvement of practices and capacity will continue with project support under \nthe program through (i) the completion of additional modules of the PHA manual, including asset \nmanagement, internal audit, and facility supervision; (ii) the finalization of PHA annual reports for \n2019; (iii) the rollout of the IFMS to all remaining PHAs; and (iv) the rollout of and training on \nimproved PFM processes and formats based on the PHA manual. To close the accountability \nloop, the Auditor General\u2019s Office audited five PHAs. Audits of remaining PHAs will continue under \nthe P3F and will be tabled in Parliament and published on the Auditor General\u2019s Office website.  \n \n22.  Reform area 3: Health service delivery components strengthened. Subprogram 3 \ncontinued to work on improving the efficiency of the procurement and distribution of medical \nsupplies. To identify areas for improved performance and efficiency, the DOH completed an \nindependent assessment of the supply chain network and the logistics management information \nsystem through the firm contracted under subprogram 2. The recommendations of the resulting \nassessment report were endorsed by the technical working group on pharmaceutical supplies \n(established under subprogram 2) and the Minister of Health. Further, the DOH approved a 2-\nyear procurement plan and budget and a 10-year procurement master plan to provide strategic \ndirection and longer-term certainty for reform implementation. Under the P3F, with the support of \nthe project component of the program, the key recommendations will be implemented, and the \nfirst-year activities of the 2-year procurement plan and budget completed. \n \n23.  Two  new  policy  actions  were  added  under  subprogram  3,  focused  on  the  eNHIS. \nFollowing an independent review, to enhance the collection and availability of national health-\nrelated information, the eNHIS was endorsed as the official, national system for health information \ncollection; and a firm was contracted to implement tablet-based data entry in the remaining 14 \nprovinces and the management of the eNHIS system for 5 years. To improve understanding of \nthe health needs of underrepresented groups, data collection in PHAs was expanded to include \nage- and sex-disaggregated data, including on interpersonal physical violence.37 Under the P3F, \nthe rollout of the eNHIS will be completed with project support in all provinces, and dashboards \nand preconfigured reports will be implemented that allow real-time monitoring of health service \ndelivery and outcomes to inform policy and management decision-making. \n \n24.  A new set of actions to support the COVID-19 health emergency response was added. \nThe DOH\u2019s Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19 was approved to guide \nnational preparedness and response measures, including in relation to incident management and \nplanning,  surveillance,  risk  assessment,  and  rapid  response.  The  National  Interagency \nCoordination Taskforce was established to oversee the plan\u2019s implementation. The Disaster \nManagement Clusters, including the Protection Cluster and the Gender-Based Violence Sub-\ncluster, were activated; and all 22 provinces activated their Provincial Emergency Operations \nCentres. Development partners have been mobilized to coordinate and support the COVID-19 \nresponse countrywide. To implement the plan\u2019s immediate actions, the government disbursed \nK23.3  million  to  the  health  sector  support  package,  including  appropriately-sized  personal \n \n36 This includes maintenance funding for facilities providing maternal and child health services that are available across \nall facility levels as per the national health service standards.

In the remaining 14 provinces, data are collected using \npaper at the point of service and inputted into the eNHIS centrally. \n ", "10 \nprotective equipment for health workers and gender-sensitive COVID-19 communication and \ncommunity engagement plans. Lastly, the eNHIS and the Go.Data system of the World Health \nOrganization (WHO) were rapidly adapted for better disease surveillance, particularly in high-risk \nareas.38 Under the P3F, the government committed to progress  the implementation of the \nimmediate measures of the plan and to enhance disease surveillance capabilities nationwide. \n \n25.  ADB value addition. The mutually reinforcing project investment, reform implementation, \nand financing provided under the program maximize ADB\u2019s value addition. The interdepartmental \ntechnical working group set up has proven to be a valuable forum for central and line agencies to \ndiscuss coordination and prioritization issues beyond the program. ADB\u2019s TA continues to provide \nsupport on macroeconomic and fiscal policy design, strategy development, budget reform and \ndebt management, and procurement reform (footnote 33). The project leads the health PFM and \npharmaceutical procurement reform assistance. ADB prepared a detailed health sector financing \nanalysis as part of ADB\u2019s support to fragile and conflict-affected situations, which has informed \nreform specification and implementation under subprograms 2 and 3. \n \n26.  Development  partner  coordination.  ADB  works  closely  with  the  Government  of \nAustralia, the European Union, the IMF, and the World Bank to support the government in \nstrengthening its macroeconomic policy and PFM. The IMF and the World Bank continue to \nprovide assistance on domestic resource mobilization, and monetary and fiscal policy advice. \nAustralia provides budget financing as well  as support in PFM, health sector  reform,  and \ndecentralization. The European Union supports national procurement reform and the PEFA \nassessment and road map development. The PFM working group meets quarterly, as do the \nhealth development partners. For the COVID-19 response, activities are closely coordinated with \nWHO through the cluster meetings it coordinates. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n27.  The  program  contributes  to  PNG\u2019s  overarching  development  objective  to  provide \naffordable, accessible, equitable, and high-quality health services for all citizens. The reforms are \nexpected to increase fiscal sustainability by supporting reductions in the fiscal deficit and public \ndebt\u2013GDP levels by 2022, in line with annual targets outlined in the MTFS. This task has become \nmore challenging because of the COVID-19 shock, but gradual reductions are expected from \n2021 onward (from the higher baseline). Preventing funding cuts for essential health services and \nincreasing the national budget resources available for the health sector remains a major impact \nof  the  program.  National  and  health  sector-specific  reforms  are  expected  to  increase  the \navailability of funds, and the effectiveness and efficiency of resource use along the service \ndelivery chain. Reforms are expected to help increase the average annual provincial health \nexpenditure as a proportion of estimated need to at least 80%, and improve the availability of \nessential medical supplies by substantially reducing stockouts by 2023\u20122024 (Appendix 1). This \nwill contribute to improved services that reduce major direct costs of disease, including (i) the loss \nof healthy life expectancy and adult earning power; (ii) medical treatment costs contributing to \npotential catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditures, which can significantly affect the consumption \nof other necessities and push families into poverty; and (iii) the opportunity costs of caretakers for \nsick family members. The program impact assessment  estimates that a 20%  reduction in \ndisability-adjusted life years lost through common conditions could result in economic savings of \nup to 2%\u20134% of gross national income ($400 million\u2013$800 million) annually.39 \n \n38 Go.Data is an outbreak investigation tool for field data collection during public health emergencies.

Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n28.  The program considers the government\u2019s financing needs, including additional needs \nstemming from the COVID-19 impact on the fiscal position; the availability of alternative financing, \nincluding the estimated financial support from other development partners; and debt sustainability. \nThe overall financing needs of the 2020 budget increased through the COVID-19 emergency from \n$1.4 billion to $1.95 billion, which the government intends to fund through a combination of \ndomestic and external borrowing as well as a drawdown from the available cash balance (Table \n2). Of the pre-COVID-19 net external financing needs of almost $1.0 billion, ADB-supported \nbudget financing was programmed at $500 million, comprising this subprogram ($100 million), the \nfirst subprogram of the State-Owned Enterprises Reform Program ($100 million), and commercial \nborrowing ($300 million) supported by a policy-based guarantee.40 However, in view of the \nCOVID-19 impact on  market conditions, commercial borrowing was postponed to 2021. In \nrecognition of the specific health sector expenditure demands placed by COVID-19 this program \nprovides  an  additional  $50  million  to  fund  COVID-19-related  expenditures,  including  the \nimplementation of health-related activities of the Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan \nfor COVID-19 and the strengthening of border and quarantine facilities as part of the government\u2019s \neconomic stimulus package. The broader economic impacts of COVID-19, both through reduced \nrevenues and increased expenditures especially to support businesses, are being mitigated \nthrough government\u2019s COVID-19 response plan, for which various development partners are \nproviding support: (i) ADB\u2019s COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option of $250 million is planned; \n(ii) the IMF approved $364 million as part of its Rapid Credit Facility; (iii) the World Bank has \napproved an additional $20 million; (iv) and other partners, including the governments of Australia \nand Japan, are considering further support to cover the financing gap.  \n \nTable 2: Development Financing Needs in 2020 \n \n($ million) \nItem  Pre-COVID  Post-COVID  Change \nRevenue and Grants   4,146    3,453    (693) \nExpenditure   5,508    5,403    (105) \nof which: directly COVID-19 related   0    445    445  \nBudget balance   (1,362)   (1,950)   (588) \nTotal budget financing needed   1,362    1,950    588  \nDrawdown from cash balance   0      131    131  \nNet domestic borrowing   370    566    196  \nNet external borrowing   992    1,253    261  \nADB-supported budget financing (gross)   500    500    0    \nHealth Services Sector Development Program   100    150    50  \nState-Owned Enterprises Reform Program   100    100    0    \nPolicy-based guarantee supported commercial borrowing   300    0      (300) \nCOVID-19 Pandemic Response Option  0   250    250  \nInternational Monetary Fund Rapid Credit Facility (gross)   0      364    364  \nOthersa (net)   492    389    (103) \n( ) = negative, ADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease. \na  This includes financing provided by ADB project investments, the Government of Australia, the Government of \nJapan, and the World Bank, among others; and factors in loan repayment, including to ADB. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates, Government of Papua New Guinea, and International Monetary Fund. \n \n29.  The government has requested (i) a regular loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources; and (ii) a concessional loan of $50 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nin each case to help finance subprogram 3. This is an increase of $50 million on the initially \nplanned amount and reflects additional financing needs for the COVID-19 health sector response. \n \n40 ADB.

Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity is 9.25 years, \nand there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The concessional loan will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2.0% per year during the grace period and \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n30.  The implementation period for subprogram 3 is September 2019\u2013December 2020. The \npreparation  and  completion  of  policy  actions  for  subprogram  3  was  carried  out  from \nSeptember 2019 to June 2020. The DOT is the executing agency. The DOF and the DOH are the \nimplementing agencies. The proceeds of the policy-based loans will be withdrawn in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n31.  Following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  subprogram  3  is  classified \ncategory C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Program activities \nwill be confined to policy and institutional reforms. No activity will result in or lead to involuntary \nresettlement, or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n32.  Gender. Subprogram 3 is classified effective gender mainstreaming and focuses on \n(i) supporting sustainable financial and health system management approaches to provide better \nquality health services for all and improve women\u2019s access to reproductive health services and \nhigh-quality maternal and child health facilities and services, and (ii) supporting women and girls \nduring COVID-19. Policy actions include (i) prioritizing health sector budget allocations, with \nspecific focus on ensuring budget for maternity, child health, reproductive health, and family \nplanning services; (ii) supporting women in decision-making roles in the health sector by ensuring \nthat at least one (out of nine) of the board of directors for each PHA is a woman; and (iii) a number \nof GRB actions, including the approval of GRB modules of the PHA manual, GRB training for PHA \nboards  and  executives  in  all  22  provinces,  and  systematic  collection  of  age-  and  sex-\ndisaggregated data and data on interpersonal physical violence at the PHA level to inform \nplanning of effective health programs. The P3F continues these reforms, including through the \npublication of a gender analysis of the 2021 budget and an improved participatory budgeting \nprocess for 2021, involving consultations with women and other civil society stakeholder groups. \nCOVID-19  gender  actions  include  (i) weekly  coordination  meetings  of  the  United Nations \nGovernment Protection cluster and gender-based violence subcluster; (ii) personal protective \nequipment for health workers; (iii) gender-sensitive communication and community engagement \nplans, with targeted messaging on COVID-19 and pregnancy and breastfeeding, gender-based \nviolence, and sexual and reproductive rights; and (iv) a COVID-19 ministerial instruction stating \nthat all other health services must continue to be delivered to communities despite the pandemic.  \n \n33.  Promoting good governance and strengthening PFM are key government priorities, but \nsystems and capacities remain fragile. Despite this, the government is assessed to have the \nability to implement its budget, which is integral  to the  program\u2019s success.
