The \nsummary is attached as an appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The Project is to (i) rehabilitate the Qaisar-Bala Murghab section \n(90 kilometers) of the Herat-Andkhoy road, (ii) install toll facilities \nincluding toll plazas and weighing machines for the project road, \n(iii) support human immunodeficiency syndrome/acquired immune \ndeficiency  syndrome  (HIV/AIDS)  prevention  and  anti-human \ntrafficking  awareness  campaign,  (iv)  provide  support  for \nconstruction supervision and monitoring, and (v) provide project \nmanagement support to the Ministry of Public Works (MPW).  \n   \nRationale  Much of Afghanistan\u2019s road infrastructure has been destroyed or \ndamaged in more than two decades of conflict. Damaged roads \nbecame  bottlenecks  to  the  movement  of  people  and  goods. \nRestricted  movement  has  aggravated  the  division  and \ndisintegration of the country, as travel time and vehicle operating \ncost on roads significantly increased. The result is a virtual loss of \nefficient means of transport connecting Kabul to regional centers, \nand regional centers to remote villages. \n \nThe Qaisar-Bala Murghab road forms part of the Herat-Andkhoy \nroad, which is the last unpaved section of the national primary ring \nroad. The project area is one of the least developed areas that the \nring road touches. Due to its remoteness and extreme weather in \nwinter and summer, the project area is still in need of continued \nhumanitarian  aid  and  assistance  in  basic  social  services. \nImprovement to the road will facilitate provision of such services.  \n \nThe  Project  is  part  of  coordinated  international  assistance  to \nimprove the road connecting Herat to Andkhoy, which will become \na  major  north-south  link  across  the  central  mountains,  and \nsignificantly improve the stability and reliability of the transport \nsystem  in  Afghanistan.  The  improved  road  will  also  change \ntransport in the subregion. Together with international links to the \nCentral  Asian  republics,  Iran,  and  Pakistan  that  are  currently \nbeing improved, the road will form a major road transport corridor \nfrom Central Asia to the warm water ports in the south. The result \nwill reduce transport costs, and contribute to economic growth and", "  iii\n  poverty reduction in the subregion. The spread of HIV/AIDS and \nhuman trafficking resulting from improved road connectivity will be \nmitigated  through  the  component  on  HIV/AIDS/sexually \ntransmitted disease prevention and anti human trafficking. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The objective of the Project is to help the Government promote \neconomic  and  social  development  and  reduce  poverty  by \nrehabilitating  the  primary  road  network  damaged  during  two \ndecades of conflict and neglect.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is estimated at $55.3 million equivalent, \nincluding physical contingencies and interest charges during the \ngrace period. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at $38.3 \nmillion,  representing  about  69%  of  the  total  cost.  The  local \ncurrency cost is estimated at $17.0 million equivalent, or about \n31% of the total cost.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  Considering the fact that the project area is the most remote and \npoorest  area  in  a  country  that  requires  highly  concessional \nassistance,  the  proposed  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nassistance of $55 million will be provided on a full grant basis from \nAsian Development Fund (ADF) resources denominated in special \ndrawing rights. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The ADB grant will finance $55 million of the foreign exchange \nand local currency costs of the Project, excluding taxes and duties \nof $304,000 that will be incurred by the Government.  \n \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nPeriod of Grant  1 January 2006 \u2500 31 December 2008 \nUtilization \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Public Works (MPW ) \n   \nImplementation  The  Project  will  be  implemented  by  the  existing  project \nArrangements  management unit (PMU), which handles the ongoing Kandahar-\nSpin  Boldak  Road  Project  and  the  road  component  of  the \nEmergency Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project. MPW will \nalso  establish  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  at  the  site \ncomprising two engineers and one office administrator to liaise \nwith the project management consultants, contractors, the local \ngovernment, and the people in the project area. The PIU staff, \nstationed  in  the  field,  will  handle  day-to-day  project \nimplementation.  \n   ", "iv   \nProcurement  Procurement of goods, services, and civil works to be financed \nunder the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Due  to  the  emergency  nature  of \nproject  implementation,  the  Government  requested  flexible \napplication of such guidelines, including a shorter bidding period \nof 60 days to procure civil works under international competitive \nbidding. All international procurements will be by the Government \nProcurement Unit operating under the Afghanistan Reconstruction \nand Development Services (ARDS). \n   \nConsulting Services  A  consultant  team  will  be  hired  to  help  MPW  implement  the \nProject. The team will (i) oversee overall project management; (ii) \nassist  with  the  procurement  of  civil  works;  (iii)  supervise \nconstruction  and  installation  of  equipment,  including  reviewing \ndetailed  designs  prepared  by  contractors;  (iv)  supervise \nimplementation of the HIV/AIDS component; (v) certify completed \nworks by force account as well as by contractors; (vi) provide on-\nthe-job training for MPW staff assigned to the consultant team \nimplementing  and  supervising  the  training  component  of  the \nProject; and (vii) undertake benefit monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nAll consultants financed from the ADB loan will be selected and \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for \nrecruiting domestic consultants. Direct selection is proposed for \nthe  consulting  services  for  construction  supervision  and \nmonitoring. The consulting services contract will be awarded to \nthe same firm who will be engaged under the ongoing Andkhoy-\nQaisar Road Project since the firm will be involved with the same \nAndkhoy-Herat road section.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will lead to both direct and indirect poverty reduction \nBeneficiaries  impacts. Direct impact will be on income generation and demand \nfor  unskilled  labor,  and  wages  accruing  to  them  during \nconstruction  of  the  project  road.  Other  benefits  will  become \nevident  in  lower  transportation  costs  and  higher  agricultural \nproduct profit margins.  \n \nImproved roads and better connectivity will allow farmers to more \nreadily market agricultural crops, which in turn will stimulate more \nagricultural  wage  employment,  particularly  benefiting  the  poor. \nLower transportation costs will also increase mobility among the \npoor  to  find  employment  opportunities  in  other  areas.  Road \nimprovement will facilitate access to schools, medical clinics, and \nemployment centers.  \n \nOther indirect benefits from improved regional trade and transit \nwill be generation of new employment opportunities to facilitate \nrehabilitation of displaced populations and ex-combatants, inter-\nethnic reconciliation, and improvement of security and stability.   \n \n ", "  v\n  Apart from reducing vehicle operating costs, the improved road \nwill  decrease  the  chances  of  accident  deaths  and  disabilities \nresulting from extremely poor road conditions. Thus, increased \neconomic activity and easy access to social services are expected \nto significantly increase household incomes and enhance quality \nof life, thereby reducing overall poverty incidence.  \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The risks to the Project are related to (i) the overall political and \nsecurity  situation  and  possible  interference  by  regional \nwarlords/militia leaders, (ii) trafficking of opium along the improved \nroads, (iii) the Government\u2019s weak implementation capacity, (iv) \ntimely provision of counterpart resources, and (v) the increased \nspread of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking caused by improved \nroad connectivity.  \n \nThe risks will be mitigated through (i) continued close monitoring \nand  coordination  with  local  and  central  authorities  and  United \nNations agencies to ensure adequate protection, (ii) improvement \nof  border  procedures  to  contain  the  movement  of  opium,  (iii) \nallocation of resources for consulting services to help with project \nmanagement  and  implementation,  and  continued  technical \nassistance  to  MPW  through  the  ongoing  technical  assistance \ncluster,  (iv)  use  of  the  existing  MPW  project  management \narrangement  for  the  ongoing  Emergency  Infrastructure \nRehabilitation and Reconstruction Project, and (v) development of \nmitigating  measures  by  the  project  component  for  HIV/AIDS \nprevention and anti-human trafficking awareness campaign.  ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Qaisar-Bala Murghab Road Project. The project \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n1.  Road Infrastructure \n \n2.  Afghanistan is a landlocked country. With a large area (about 652,000 square kilometers \n[km2]) and an estimated population of 22.8 million widely spread across the largely mountainous \nterrain, roads are the principal means of transport. Its road network comprises about 6,100 km \nof national roads, 15,000 km of provincial roads, 15,000\u201320,000 km of rural roads, and about \n3,000 km of urban roads including 1,060 km in Kabul. Of the national roads, 3,300 km comprise \nnational primary roads forming part of the 2,300 km ring road that connects Afghanistan\u2019s major \nregional centers (Herat, Kandahar, Maimana, Mazar-e-Sharif, and Sheberghan) with Kabul, and \nthe roads leading to neighboring countries. The remaining 2,800 km of national roads constitute \nsecondary roads with gravel or earthen surface. The 15,000 km provincial roads have gravel or \nearthen surface and comprise 5,400 km of provincial primary roads and 9,600 km of provincial \nsecondary roads \n \n3.  Much of Afghanistan\u2019s road infrastructure was destroyed or damaged during the more \nthan two decades of conflict. Lack of resources and capacity prevented maintenance and has \nled to major deterioration and loss of infrastructure. A comprehensive needs assessment of the \nAfghanistan  transport  sector 1   by  major  external  funding  agencies  including  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) revealed that 54% of national roads were in poor condition, 26% in \nfair condition, and only 20% in good condition. The needs assessment recommended that the \nentire primary road network be rehabilitated on a priority basis. \n \n4.  Afghanistan\u2019s road network is characterized by very low road density. The road density \nof 0.03 km/km2 is far lower than that of the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, which also have \nlargely mountainous terrain and similar population density, and is even lower than that of \nBalochistan in Pakistan, where population density is about half that of Afghanistan.2 Even \nwithout  the  damage  inflicted  during  the  conflict  period,  Afghanistan\u2019s  road  network  needs \nsubstantial improvement to provide the Afghan population with a basic level of connectivity.    \n \n2.  Road Transport Service \n \n5.  The number of vehicles has increased significantly over the past 2 years. Statistics in a \nrecent International Monetary Fund country report3  on Afghanistan show that transport of goods \nby road increased from 1.9 million tons (t) in 2000 to 3.7 million t in 2001 and 5 million t in 2002, \nrepresenting an almost fourfold increase. The number of taxicabs nearly doubled from 17,000 in \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Afghanistan\u2019s Transport Sector on the Road to Recovery. Manila.  \n2  Road densities are 0.18 km/km2 in Tajikistan, 0.17 km/km2 in the Kyrgyz Republic, and 0.07 km/km2 in \nBalochistan Province of Pakistan. \n3  International Monetary Fund. 2003. Islamic State of Afghanistan: Rebuilding a Macroeconomic Framework for \nReconstruction and Growth. Washington, DC: IMF. ", "2   \n2000 to 33,500 in 2002. More than 147,000 vehicles were estimated to be registered in Kabul, \nwhich under certain assumptions would translate into about 304,000 vehicles countrywide. Most \nvehicles are owned and operated by the private sector as the Ministry of Transport (MOT)-\noperated fleet has been severely depleted.  \n \n6.  The Afghan private sector has historically played a dominant role in trucking and has \nmaintained its presence, including individuals and firms that relocated in Pakistan during the war \nyears. As expected, long distance public transport linking major cities and neighboring countries \nhas deteriorated due to road and vehicle conditions which have suppressed the demand for \nroad travel. Security remains a key concern. \n \n7.  Urban  transport,  once  dominated  by  the  public  sector,  is  now  provided  mostly  by \nprivately owned buses, taxis, and minivans. Forms of regional transport depend on the state of \nthe  roads  and  the  availability  of  vehicles.  People  and  goods  move  together,  blurring  the \ndistinction  between  passenger  and  commercial  freight  traffic.  Private  agencies  operate \nprovincial and district routes. Some 165 registered long-distance private bus companies are \nestimated to be operating\u2015101 based in Kabul, 64 in provinces\u2015with a total of 14,007 buses, \nmostly old minibuses and vans. \n \n3.  Road Sector Management \n \n8.  The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) has been responsible for developing, operating, \nand maintaining of the primary and secondary road network in the country. MPW had an \ninstitutional  setup  of  a  large  engineering  organization  with  staff  stationed  in  every  major \nprovincial capital and carrying out work through force account. Over the course of the conflict, \nMPW lost the majority of its trained staff. The current staff of 2,900 require substantial skills \nenhancement to perform their duties. The Ministry of Rehabilitation and Rural Development is \nresponsible  for  developing  of  rural  infrastructure,  including  rural  roads.  Construction  and \nmaintenance of urban roads are the responsibility of municipalities. \n \n9.  MOT  regulates  the  private  sector  transport  industry.  MOT\u2019s  primary  function  is \ncoordinating  agreements  between  the  private  sector  and  international  transporters  and \nestablishing eight offices in neighboring countries to facilitate international trade. The private \nsector department in MOT sets technical standards for private commercial vehicles and inspects \nthem for compliance during licensing and renewal of license. It collects a fee of 5% per carriage \ncontract  from  private  trucks  and  3%  per  trip  from  interprovincial  private  buses,  based  on \nauthorized charge rates.  \n \n10.  Appendix 2 presents an analysis of the road sector in Afghanistan.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Government Strategy for Road Sector Development  \n \n11.  The Government declared that rehabilitation of the road system, especially of national \nprimary roads, is the country\u2019s top priority in reconstruction. With external assistance, since \n2002 the Government has been making massive efforts to reestablish the road network, so as \nto facilitate provision of basic social services to remote provinces, provide security, and involve \nall the population in undertaking nation-building activities. \n ", "  3\n12.  Currently, capital investment to rehabilitate and reconstruct roads in Afghanistan is \nfinanced  mainly  by  external  assistance.  The  current  commitments  of  external \nbilateral/multilateral funding agencies to Afghanistan\u2019s road sector amount to approximately \n$1  billion,  including  $800  million  for  national  primary  roads,  $130  million  for  national \nsecondary roads, and $30 million for provincial roads. These commitments are mainly to \nrehabilitate damaged roads. \n \n13.  For improving the road network, the Government has set a target to double the \nshare of total paved roads from the present 16% to 32% by 2010, or from the present 0.15 \nkm of paved road per 1,000 people to 0.23 km per 1,000 in 2010. To reach this target, \ninvestment needs from 2004 to 2010 will be for $4.3 billion outside the existing commitment: \n$1.7 billion for national primary roads, $1.1 billion for national secondary roads, and $1.5 \nbillion for provincial roads.4 Considering the limited prospect for private sector financing of \nthese large investments in the foreseeable future, the public sector and external assistance \nwill continue to be responsible for filling the financing gap. \n \n14.  Afghanistan has a history of toll collection for road maintenance. The first toll system \nwas implemented in 1974. Tolls were collected by way of a system of toll stations scattered \nthroughout the country, and the revenue accrued to the central revenue fund with no earmarking \nfor the road sector. A new system implemented in 1999 introduced earmarking the toll revenue \nfor construction and maintenance of highways. Through a decision of the High Council of \nMinisters on 23 September 2002, however, this road toll system was abolished. Approximately \n$80 million is estimated to be required annually to maintain the entire road network. For a \ncountry with total domestic revenues of only $300 million, that cost will be a challenge. While the \nGovernment is in the process of establishing a fuel tax regime to support road maintenance \nfunding, it is also considering reinstating toll collection on improved road sections5 to cover the \nmaintenance cost as well as to recover part of the capital investment cost. ADB is providing, as \npart  of  the  master  plan  Technical  Assistance  (TA) 6 ,  support  in  formulating  financing \nmechanisms for road sector expenditure. \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Strategy \n \n15.  ADB puts the first priority to rehabilitating of the road system, critical for a landlocked \ncountry. To rebuild the economy, roads are needed to establish major economic linkages both \ndomestically as well as with neighboring countries. The strategic framework for rehabilitating, \nreconstructing, and developing of the road sector consists of the following elements: (i) policies \nand  institutions  developing;  (ii)  building  capacity;  (iii)  developing  the  private  sector;  (iv) \ngenerating employment; (v) encourage community participation; (vi) decentralizing of network \nmanagement; (vii) promoting sustainable sector financing and cost recovery; (viii) protection and \npreserving the environment; (ix) avoiding and mitigating resettlement; (x) absorbing returnee \nrefugees,  ex-combatants,  and  women  in  road  construction  and  maintenance;  and                   \n(xi) involving the community in road construction and maintenance.  \n \n16.  MPW  or  state-owned  enterprises  will  be  assisted  to  gradually  withdraw  from  road \nconstruction  and  maintenance  and  transfer  the  responsibility  to  the  private  sector, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and the local communities. Eventually the Government\u2019s \n                                                 \n4  Government of Afghanistan. 2004.

", "4   \nrole should be limited to establishing and implementing appropriate policy, legal, and regulatory \nfunctions for the sector, and to planning, monitoring, and implementing programs. Developing \nthe capacity of the human resources of road sector institutions is a key requirement to help the \nGovernment fulfill its role. \n \n17.  In rehabilitating the road sector, priority attention will be given to a core highway network \nwith emphasis on trade links to neighboring countries, including bridges, repair of disintegrated \npavements,  drainage  erosion  prevention,  and  routine  maintenance.  ADB  assistance  for \nrehabilitating roads will include capacity building and reconstruction of main link roads, bridges, \nand  causeways.  ADB\u2019s  approach  to  road  planning  and  design  will  take  into  account  the \nsubregional  links,  which  will  demand  a  higher  standard  than  would  roads  for  the  use  of \nAfghanistan alone.  \n \n3.  External Assistance  \n \n18.  The national primary roads are being rehabilitated with financial and technical assistance \nfrom  bilateral  and  multilateral  funding  agencies  (Appendix  3).  Priority  has  been  given  to \nrehabilitating the strategic road connection primarily comprising the ring road and border access \nroad  to  surrounding  countries.  In  this  context,  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (USAID) and the Japanese Government provided support for rehabilitating the \nKabul-Kandahar road. USAID, the Japanese Government, and the Saudi Arabian Government \nprovided financing for rehabilitating Kandahar-Herat road. The World Bank provided support for \nrehabilitating  Kabul-Doshi  road  including  the  repair  of  Salang  tunnel.  ADB\u2019s  Emergency \nInfrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project (EIRRP)7 approved in 2003 finances \nrehabilitation of the road from Pul-e Khumri via Mazar-e Sharif to Andkhoy. ADB\u2019s TA conducted \nthe feasibility study for the whole length (554 km) of Herat-Andkhoy road, which was the only \nmissing part of the ring road. ADB\u2019s Andkhoy-Qaisar Road Project approved in 2004 provided \nfinancing to improve of 210 km of road from Andkhoy to Qaisar. The Project will continue to \nrehabilitate 90 km of the Qaisar-Bala Murghab road. When the remaining 180 km of Herat-\nAndkhoy road is completed with the Saudi Arabian Government\u2019s pledge of $100 million, the \ncomplete ring road will have been rehabilitated. \n \n19.  Aid agencies\u2019 assistance also focused on border access roads. The Iranian Government \nfinanced the rehabilitation of Herat-Islam Qala road that allows transborder traffic from Iran. The \nEuropean  Commission  provided  support  for  rehabilitating  Kabul-Jalalabad  road,  and  the \nremaining section up to the major border point of Torkham was financed by the Pakistan \nGovernment.  ADB\u2019s  Postconflict  Multisector  Program  loan8  approved  in  2002  supported \nrehabilitation of Kandahar-Spin Boldak road that reaches the Pakistan border. The World Bank \nfinances  rehabilitation  of  Pul-e  Khumri-Kunduz-Shirkhan  Bandar  road  that  reaches  the \nTajikistan border. ADB\u2019s EIRRP finances rehabilitation of Naibabad-Hairatan road that reaches \nthe Uzbekistan border. With support from aid agencies, all key border access roads are being \nrehabilitated. \n \n20.  In 2004, ADB provided TA (footnote 6) for preparing a road master plan for a road \ndevelopment program for the next 5\u201310 years for efficient and effective road rehabilitation \nfocusing on identifying major east-west and north-south corridors to cross-link the ring road.

The next phase in ADB\u2019s assistance for road \nrehabilitation will be based on the road development program of the TA. \n \n4.  Capacity Building and Sector Reforms \n \n21.  As recommended by the comprehensive needs assessment, a team of international and \ndomestic experts is assigned to MPW to compensate for MPW\u2019s lack of capacity to implement \nlarge-scale projects. Under the ongoing TA cluster for capacity building9 ADB is providing such \nassistance to strengthen MPW\u2019s capacity to plan and manage projects.  Under the EIRRP and \nthe Andkhoy-Qaisar Road Project, the project implementation unit established within MPW is \ngradually building capacity to handle day-to-day project implementation with the aid of project \nmanagement consultants and by closely coordinating with the Afghanistan Reconstruction and \nDevelopment  Services  (ARDS),  which  was  established  to  centrally  handle  planning, \ncoordination, preparation, and procurement of major reconstruction projects. Several MPW staff \nhave been attached to the contractor and the supervision consultants to receive on-the-job \ntraining in project administration and implementation. The Project will expand this on-the-job \ntraining program by assigning MPW staff to the project management and implementation unit. In \n2005 ADB will provide a stand alone TA for institutional capacity building for road agencies, the \nscope of which will be defined in consultation with other aid agencies and MPW. \n \n22.  The Transport Sector Review (TSR)10 studied the policy objectives identified by the \nPostconflict  Multisector  Program  loan  (footnote  8)  and  recommended  major  policy  and \ninstitutional reforms. The Policy Statement for the Transport Sector, prepared as part of the \nTSR, sets out the guiding principles of the recommended reforms and provides the framework \nfor reform implementation (Supplementary Appendix A). The TSR on the road sector dealt with \n(i) the organizational structure of MPW; (ii) construction and maintenance operations of MPW; \n(iii) reform, restructuring, and strengthening of MPW; (iv) financing of the road sector; and (v) \nlong-term institutional arrangements in the road sector. The Government had established a \nsteering committee to provide guidance and review the TSR. In January 2004 the steering \ncommittee approved the TSR with all its recommendations, and paved the way for submission \nof the TSR to the cabinet for approval. The cabinet has not formally approved the TSR yet due \nto complicated political conditions in the country. Nonetheless, the recommendations are being \nimplemented in stages. \n \n23.  ADB and Japan are cochairs of the aid agencies consultative group in the transport \nsector, and have led discussions on policy issues with the aid agencies and the Government. \nThe consultative group has established six working groups comprising aid agencies and the \nGovernment,  and  focusing  on  (i)  preparing  handover  procedures  for  completed  roads,  (ii) \npreparing road standards, (iii) road maintenance, (iv) revenue generation for road maintenance, \n(v) capacity building in the public transport sector, and (vi) capacity building in the private \ntransport  sector.  The  working  groups  meet  regularly  and  have  completed  the  handover \nprocedures and the interim road and highway standards, which have been accepted by MPW. \n \n24.  Sector and policy reforms focus on two reform issues: (i) restructuring MPW, and (ii) the \nrecovering cost of road investment. The restructuring of MPW has been pursued in line with the \n                                                 \n9  ADB.  2002.

", "6   \nGovernment\u2019s priority reform and restructuring (PRR) 11 scheme. The PRR status requires MPW \nto become more accountable and responsible by preparing job descriptions and staffing clearly \ndefined positions through open advertisement. This requirement makes qualified MPW staff \neligible for higher salary as an incentive and is intended to weed out staff who are not qualified \nor who require retraining/upgrading. MPW had received PRR status for its capacity building unit \nthat was newly created to take charge of PRR processes and the maintenance department for \nKabul zone. Recently, however, the Independent Administrative Reforms and Civil Services \nCommission instructed MPW to seek PRR status for the entire ministry, rather than on a \ndepartment-by-department basis. Stage 1 subsequently was approved for the entire MPW, and \nthe application for Stage 2 has been submitted. Once stage 2 is approved, MPW will proceed \nwith implementing its restructuring plan, which includes preparing job descriptions, advertising, \nand  recruiting  staff.  A  committee  has  been  established  in  MPW  to  supervise  the  PRR. \nAdditionally, the working group for capacity building in the public transport sector continues its \nwork to coordinate and support MPW in implementing the PRR.  \n \n25.  For cost recovery, the Government considers raising revenue through fuel taxes and \nthus help expedite partial self-financing of road construction and operation. At the same time, \nthe Government is also considering reinstating toll collection on improved road sections. ADB \nprovided TA to support the development of a road tolling strategy including tariff structure on the \nKabul-Kandahar-Spin Boldak road. The revenue from road tolling would be collected into a \nsingle treasury account as per requirement of the Afghan constitution. The Government has \nformed a commission, chaired by MOF, to look into issues related to tolling of the major roads \nthat  are  being  rehabilitated  and  reconstructed.  The  members  of  the  commission  include \nrepresentatives from MPW, MOT, and the Ministry of Interior. The commission is considering \nthe modality for tolling, regulations, and tariff, and will submit a report to the cabinet. MPW has \nagreed to address with President Karzai the legislation needed to allow road tolling under the \nconstitution  of  Afghanistan.  The  United  States  similarly  has  discussed  the  issue  with  the \nPresident, suggesting that a presidential decree might be issued before the 18 September 2005 \nparliamentary elections to allow the collection of road tolls in Afghanistan. ADB has contributed \nto this key toll revenue issue through its ongoing road master plan study.  \n \n5.  Subregional Cooperation for Transport Corridor Development \n \n26.  The efforts by Afghanistan to rehabilitate and reconstruct its shattered road network \nhave drawn the attention of many of its neighboring countries. An improved road network in \nAfghanistan will result in an improved transport network in the subregion. Landlocked Central \nAsian  republics  have  shown  great  interest  in  establishing  transport  corridors  through \nAfghanistan to warm-water ports on the Arabian Sea and the Gulf. Iran and Pakistan are rapidly \ndeveloping their ports and improving roads connecting to the ports in expectation of increased \nimport/export and transit shipment of goods through their ports.  \n \n27.  ADB  has  been  actively  involved  in  this  subregional  initiative  to  develop  effective \ntransport corridors. Under the TA cluster (footnote 9), ADB provided assistance to develop a \n                                                 \n11 Priority reform and restructuring (PRR) is an institutional reform scheme based on the Presidential Decree on \nPriority Reform and Restructuring within Ministries and Government Agencies issued on 12 July 2003, and is \nadministered by the Independent Administrative Reforms and Civil Services Commission. The intent of the scheme \nis to promote the reform and restructuring of ministries and Government agencies. Ministries and Government \nagencies can apply for PRR status in two stages by submitting preliminary institutional reform plans for stage 1 and \nby submitting detailed action plans to implement the reforms for stage 2. Once they have obtained PRR status, \nemployees who fill new posts under the restructured organization are compensated with additional salary in the \nform of an interim additional allowance.  ", "  7\nframework and legislation to facilitate cross-border trade. This has evolved into the initiative to \nestablish the Central and South Asia Transport and Trade Forum (CSATTF).12 Under this \ninitiative, meetings have been held to discuss customs harmonization; coordinated development \nof border infrastructure; and enforcement of the laws on drug and human trafficking, and money \nlaundering.13 \n \n28.  As for infrastructure improvement, ADB has been financing two key international links in \nAfghanistan: the road from Kandahar to Spin Boldak on the border with Pakistan (footnote 8), \nand the road from Naibabad to Hairatan on the Uzbekistan border (footnote 7). In Pakistan, \nADB financed the Balochistan Road Development Sector Project14 to rehabilitate and widen the \nKalat-Quetta (130 km) and Quetta-Chamman (117 km) sections of N25 linking Karachi through \nChamman to Afghanistan, and improve the cross-border facility and procedures at Chamman. \nADB will also finance the improvement of the road network in North-West Frontier Province, \nincluding the Peshawar-Torkhan (46 km) and N55-Ghulan Khan (118 km) sections, and the \ncross-border  facilities  at  Torkham  and  Ghulan  Khan.15  In  Central  Asia,  ADB  supports \nsubregional cooperation and removal of impediments to cross-border road transport through \nregional TAs and road rehabilitation projects in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. \n \n6.  Security Situation \n \n29.  Security is the main issue and constraint in Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction. Without an \nadequate level of security, the country will fail to achieve key national goals for economic \ngrowth, political normalization and national reconciliation, and social development. In recent \nyears, Afghanistan has made significant gains in security that has laid a solid foundation for \ncontinued and accelerated reform and has avoided a resurgence of major civil conflict. Sporadic \noutbreaks  of  armed  conflict,  even  if  not  always  fully  resolved,  have  been  contained  and \nprevented from spreading. Not all indicators are positive, however. Attacks on aid workers have \nincreased, and expatriate personnel increasingly have become victims of criminal activities. The \nKabul-based International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), in cooperation with Afghan security \nforces, has provided some level of security. Some improvements also have been made in the \npolice force \u2015which at the time of the October 2004 election included some 48,000 members\u2015 \nand the first units of a national army have been formed and trained. Security on the main \nintercity roads has improved significantly.  \n \n30.  The disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration program (DDR) supported by the \nUNDP aims at reducing the number and size of Afghan military forces, the officially recognized \nmilitia units in Afghanistan, and to simultaneously undercut the military strength of the regional \ngovernors.  By  February  2005,  about  70%  or  some  38,000  combatants  of  the  officially \nrecognized militia forces had been disarmed, with most of them participating in the reintegration \nprogram. However, about 850 unofficial militias with an excess of 65,000 members remain \noutside the scope of this formal DDR process. In the political arena, the Government has made \n                                                 \n12  The  CSATTF  comprises  Afghanistan,  Pakistan,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan,  with  Iran  as  an \nobserver.  \n13 A working-level meeting was held in March 2004, and a working group meeting focusing on trade and customs in \nOctober 2004. A second ministerial conference  was held in March 2005 to discuss measures to facilitate \nmovement of goods and people in the subregion and endorse new articles on the establishment of the CSATTF.  \n14  ADB. 2003.

In particular, it has strengthened the new Afghanistan \nNational Army (ANA), which as of February 2005 included some 21,000 soldiers, a threefold \nincrease in strength over a year, with support from the United States. If the training proceeds as \nplanned, the target of a 70,000-strong ANA could be achieved by December 2006. \n \n31.  In many parts of the country, quasi autonomy continues to exist under the rule of mid-\nlevel commanders and local leaders commanding the 65,000 strong unofficial militias, armed \nwith non-decommissioned light weapons. The situation enables regional warlords and mid-level \ncommanders  to  maintain  their  military  strength  and  continue  their  influence  over  regional \npolitics. The still weak control by the Central Government contributes to somewhat fragile \nsecurity in many parts of the country. The security situation will continue to constrain the \nprogress of reconstruction, and security concerns may further discourage foreign and large-\nscale domestic investment. While attacks by Taliban insurgents have decreased, the rapid \nincrease in opium poppy cultivation and drug-related activity by local war lords or drug lords \nposes  a  grave  threat  to  Afghanistan\u2019s  security  as  well  as  its  further  reconstruction  and \ndevelopment. \n \n32.  As  part  of  the  overall  strategy  to  stabilize  the  country,  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty \nOrganization decided in 2003 to expand ISAF beyond the Kabul area.  The 8,000 ISAF troops \nhave contributed to the retrieval of heavy weaponry embedded in the DDR process and expects \nto achieve its target of 100% retrieval by end-2005. The creation of provincial reconstruction \nteams (PRTs), teams of civilian and military personnel working in Afghanistan\u2019s provinces to \nextend  the  authority  of  the  Central  Government  and  to  provide  a  safer  and  more  secure \nenvironment in which reconstruction can take place also is contributing to the stabilization \nprocess in Afghanistan. The PRTs are being expanded to a total of nine province-based teams, \nmainly in the northern and western parts of the country. The ISAF-led PRTs will fully cover \nproject areas. In addition to the ISAF-led PRTs, 14 additional PRTs have been established \nunder the mandate of the United States-led coalition forces. \n \n33.  The fragile security situation, however, may adversely affect the implementation of the \nProject because (i) any security problems in project locations will disrupt and delay construction \nwork; (ii) the supply of raw materials, which will have to be transported through areas controlled \nby  regional  warlords,  may  be  hampered;  and  (iii)  the  supervision  of  construction  work  by \nconsultants and ADB staff may be constrained. For example, interference from factional leaders \nand the deteriorating security situation have seriously hampered implementation of the project \nto  rehabilitate  the  Kandahar-Spin  Boldak  road  financed  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty \nReduction.  Mobilization  of  machinery  and  plants  experienced  inordinate  delays  due  to  the \nlonger time required for transport across warlord-controlled provinces. Repeated threats to the \nconstruction workers and security incidents in and around Kandahar also demoralized the \nemployees of the contractor and consultants.  \n \n34.  To  overcome  the  problems,  efforts  to  win  the  support  of  communities  near  the \nconstruction site were made through grassroots outreach. The collaboration of local government \nofficials and village leaders is sought. ADB is devising security arrangements under a TA16 to \nhelp provide in close cooperation with provincial authorities, a safe work environment for on-site \npersonnel assigned by the contractors and consulting firms. \n \n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Security of ADB-Financed Projects \nin Afghanistan. Manila. ", "  9\n7.  Opium-Related Problems \n \n35.  Afghanistan is the world\u2019s largest producer of illicit opium, comprising 87% of world \nproduction, or some 4,200 metric t. Narcotics also constitute the largest sector of the Afghan \neconomy. Valued at $2.8 billion, the opium economy equals some 60% of the country\u2019s 2003 \ngross domestic product ($4.6 billion, if only licit activity is measured). Opium is a major source of \ncash income for farmers because of the high profitability of opium poppy compared with other \nagricultural crops as well as the lack of livelihood alternatives. According to the United Nations \nOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), in 2004 poppy cultivation in Afghanistan hit an all-time \nhigh, with 52,400 hectares under cultivation (only 2.9% of total agricultural land). Although this \nrepresented a 64% increase over 2003 cultivation, total production increased by only 17% due \nto bad weather and crop disease. In 2004 opium poppy was grown in all of Afghanistan\u2019s 34 \nprovinces,  up  from  only  28  provinces  in  2003.  UNODC  estimates  that  356,000  Afghan \nhouseholds are involved in opium poppy cultivation, representing some 2.3 million people, or \n10% of the country\u2019s total population, with each household cultivating an average of 0.37 \nhectare (ha) of opium poppy.  \n \n36.  UNODC\u2019s February 2005 Rapid Opium Poppy Assessment Survey revealed a falling \ntrend in opium poppy cultivation in most provinces, mainly because farmers refrained from \nplanting. The main reasons reported by villagers for the expected reduction in cultivation were \nrespect for a Government ban on opium poppy cultivation and fear of eradication. In some \nareas, villagers indicated that the low yields of opium poppy in 2004 influenced their decision, as \nwell as increased wheat prices.   \n \n37.  Poppy cultivation and downstream narcotics production and trade constitute a major \nthreat to Afghanistan\u2019s security and stability in that the trade in opium, including opium debt, ties \nthe poor rural population to regional warlords and international crime syndicates. No country can \nestablish a sustainable, accountable government and security structure when nearly half its \neconomy is based on the production of an illegal crop. To address the multifactored problem of \nnarcotics  production,  the  Government  in  October  2002  established  a  Counter  Narcotics \nDirectorate to coordinate national policies and programs for drug control, and adopted an Anti-\nNarcotics Law in 2003. The Directorate was elevated to a full ministry in December 2004. Also \nin December 2004 President Hamid Karzai called for a jihad (holy war) on narcotics production, \nresulting in some crop eradication activities. \n \n38.  The  Government\u2019s  overall  anti-narcotics  strategy  is  to  eliminate  the  production, \nconsumption, and trafficking of illicit drugs into, within, and from Afghanistan, with focus on \nproviding  alternative  livelihood  for  Afghan  poppy  farmers,  extending  drug  law  enforcement \nthroughout Afghanistan, implementing drug control legislation, establishing effective institutions, \nand introducing of prevention and treatment programs for addicts. Aid agencies are contributing \nto the Government\u2019s anti-narcotics efforts with focus on alternative livelihoods, including rural \ncredit to address the problem of opium debt, as well as support for improved law enforcement \nand interdiction and legal and judicial reform. Aid agencies also are attempting to mainstream \nthe anti-narcotics agenda into other development activities, and recently have developed an \nanti-narcotics checklist or screen to promote such mainstreaming. During the second half of \n2005, ADB will use this checklist to review its activities in Afghanistan, including its road and \ntransport projects.  \n \n39.  Although irregular border crossings currently are preferred for illegal trafficking, as formal \nborder crossings improve and as volumes of cargo and passengers increase, the volume of \nnarcotics trafficked by way of formal border crossings and through the main roads is likely to ", "10  \nincrease. While the project site (Qaisar- Bala Murghab) is not a main opium-producing region, it \nmay be argued that improved transportation corridors will facilitate trafficking in narcotics and \nhuman beings. This points to the need for training police and customs officers as well as \nimproved interdiction methods, as highlighted by an ADB-commissioned report on cross-border \nlaw enforcement. 17 \n \n40.  It is noted, however, that the goal of counternarcotics in Afghanistan is to building \nstability and the rule of law. Hence the measure of success is not only reducing the amount of \nopium poppy grown by Afghan farmers, but curtailing the flow of income and accumulation of \nwealth by traffickers and commanders while maintaining adequate growth in the legal economy. \nIt is also noted that opium cultivation is the only means by which many farmers can obtain \ncredit, cash incomes, access to land, and, in many cases, access to water from tube wells. \nSimple crop eradication will only aggravate such problems, and current alternative livelihood \nactivities will not fully address the needs of poor farmers. This points to the need for a long-term \nand multipronged approach to Afghanistan\u2019s narcotics production and trade.   \n \n41.  ADB\u2019s support to the anti-narcotics agenda focuses on helping farm households develop \nsustainable alternatives to opium poppy cultivation. ADB activities in this regard include creating \nan enabling environment for the commercialization and diversification of agricultural production \nas well as rehabilitating of irrigation systems, which ADB is pursuing through a demand-driven, \nparticipatory, and community-based approach.   \n \n8.  HIV/AIDS Prevention and Anti-Human Trafficking Strategy \n \n42.  The Government recognizes the risks associated with highway development vis-\u00e0-vis \nHIV/AIDS18 transmission and human trafficking. In Afghanistan, the Ministry of Public Health \n(MOPH) to date has reported 31 HIV cases and 3 deaths. Although the Government has come \nup with a strategic plan,19 there remains a huge funding gap. The World Bank has approved a \n$59.6 million project that will help rebuild the public health system in Afghanistan, with a strong \nemphasis on prevention and education. Although there is no specific HIV/AIDS component due \nto more immediate priorities, interventions to improve maternal health and prevent sexually \ntransmitted  infections  will  also  prevent  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS.  As  per  MOPH,  provincial \ncapitals have HIV/AIDS testing facility; however, they lack the technical expertise and capacity \nto carry out such tests and currently the World Health Organization is supporting them in this \nregard. With assistance from the United Nations Population Fund (UNPFA) and the United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), MOPH has opened a Voluntary Counselling and Testing \nCentre in Kabul, which would start functioning very soon. As a first step, through external \nsupport  (UNPFA  and  UNICEF),  MOPH  as  part  of  its  National  HIV/AIDS  Control  Program \ntogether with the Ministry of Religious Affairs had also organized a Religious Leaders National \nConsultative Conference on HIV/AIDS in July 2004. During the conference, the role of religious \nleaders in awareness and prevention of HIV/AIDS was identified and a future action plan was \nprepared. One of the key concerns of the CSATTF20 has been prevention of human trafficking. \n                                                 \n17  ADB. 2004.

", "  11\nOne of the key recommendations has been to develop, fund, and implement training programs \nfor  judicial,  legal,  medical,  and  social  services  and  for  police  and  customs/immigration \npersonnel, to sensitize them to the serious nature of trafficking in persons and the gender-based \nviolence it often entails. Awareness and training programs will enable them to identify situations \nof trafficking in persons and to treat the victims adequately. It was also proposed that the \ntraining programs be carried out together with specialized NGOs, so as to improve cooperation \nbetween NGOs and the authorities. \n \n43.  To  help  the  Government  combat  the  risks,  a  strategic  guideline  for  HIV/AIDS  and \nsexually transmitted infections (STIs) and anti-human trafficking awareness strategy has been \nformulated as part of the Project (Appendix 4).  \n \n9.  Lessons Learned \n \n44.  A number of lessons can be drawn from past ADB emergency assistance projects, best \npractices, as well as ADB\u2019s initial lending and nonlending operations in Afghanistan since 2002. \nFirst, continued emphasis has to be given to capacity building to improve planning, project \ndesign  and  implementation,  administration,  and  financial  management.  Second,  aid \ncoordination  through  government-aid  agency  consultative  groups  or  other  mechanisms  is \nimportant to avoid duplication or delays. Third, aid groups must work closely with a country\u2019s \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) and central bank to develop a viable and working payment system, \nwithout which maintaining a flow of funds is difficult. Fourth, capacity building in executing \nagencies is vital, and consulting services for project design and implementation should explicitly \nprovide  for  the  training  of  executing  agency  staff  in  the  operation  and  maintenance  of \nrehabilitated facilities. Fifth, the number of procurement packages should be minimized, given \nthe limited implementation capacity for project execution. Sixth, ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines \nshould be applied flexibly to emergency assistance projects to allow for shortened procurement \nperiods  for  the  urgent  delivery  of  project  components.  Seventh,  law-and-order  situations \nresulting from conflict hamper the smooth implementation of projects and detailed security plans \nmust be in place to address possible security hazards in project locations. From experience with \nproject implementation in Afghanistan, we can also draw some lessons such as (i) advance \nprocurement  action  to  expedite  implementation,  and  (ii)  recruitment  of  consultants  to  be \nexpedited  accordingly.  These  lessons  have  been  fully  incorporated  into  the  design  of  the \nProject. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n45.  The objective of the Project is to help the Government promote economic and social \ndevelopment and reduce poverty by rehabilitating the primary road network damaged during two \ndecades of conflict and neglect. The Project is in line with ADB\u2019s assistance strategy outlined in \nthe  country  strategy  and  program  update,  which  includes  a  focus  on  rehabilitation  of  key \ninfrastructure.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n1.  Rehabilitation of Primary Road Sections \n \n46.  The Project will finance rehabilitation of the Qaisar-Bala Murghab section (90 km) of the \nHerat-Andkhoy road. The project road is an extension of the Andkhoy-Qaisar road that will be ", "12  \nrehabilitated by ADB\u2019s Andkhoy-Qaisar Road Project approved in 2004. The project road will be \nimproved to an asphalt-paved standard that will allow smooth passage of heavy vehicles on two \ntraffic lanes 3.5 meters (m) wide each, two hard shoulders of 1.5 m, and two verges of 0.5 m. To \nreduce the construction cost in mountainous terrain, the typical cross section is reduced from \n10.0 m to 8.0 m by reducing the width of the shoulders to 0.5 m. The current condition of the \nproject road and proposed design standards are presented in Appendix 5. \n \n47.  Road safety measures to be incorporated in the construction design that will include \nsafety barriers to separate pedestrians from vehicles, marker posts to make the road visible at \nnight, and signage to indicate road blind spots, potential accident-prone areas, or proximity to \npublic buildings such as schools. In areas where alignments provide little room between house \nstructures and the road, barriers and underground or bridge walkways will be considered.  \n \n2.  Provision of Road Tolling Facility \n \n48.  The Project will also finance the installation of road tolling facilities including toll plazas, \ncomputers and communications equipment, and weighing machines for the project road. The \nGovernment is now preparing road tolling implementation plans for the Kabul-Kandahar-Spin \nBoldak road. For other roads to be tolled, tolling strategy and implementation plans will be \ndeveloped under the road sector master plan TA. \n \n3.  HIV/AIDS Prevention and Anti-Human Trafficking Awareness Campaign \n \n49.  The activities under the HIV/AIDS prevention awareness campaign include (i) orientation \nand sensitization of MPW, MOPH, religious leaders, and project personnel to HIV/AIDS and \nSTIs; (ii) raising HIV/AIDS awareness of contractors, construction workers, injecting drug users, \nand communities and villages along the project road with referral information and condom \ndistribution; (iii) public awareness campaign for high-risk groups (e.g., truck drivers/helpers, \nidentified sex workers, construction workers, injecting drug users, and vulnerable groups) and \nthe general public; (iv) condom promotion and distribution at critical points and during the \nawareness raising training; and (v) giving out referral information on nearest available services \nfor testing, counseling, and treatment. The awareness generation for the anti-human trafficking \nsubcomponent  will  focus  on  (i)  conveying  behavioral  change  message;  (ii)  providing  safe \nmigration tips, especially to high-risk groups, equipping them with information on police numbers \nand  other  necessary  resources;  (iii)  assisting  local  NGOs  to  coordinate  with  the  police  to \ninvestigate suspected transporters and human traffickers; (iv) training police, customs, and \nother  relevant  organizations  and  community  in  the  dangers  of  human  trafficking;  (v) \nstrengthening formal links of the local NGOs with the border police and immigration/customs \ndepartment;  (vi)  assisting  the  police  and  immigration/customs  department  to  further  build \ncapacity and strengthen the development of a framework and procedures to identify suspected \nhuman trafficking. Details of cost and implementation arrangements are in Appendix 4. \n \n4.  Construction Supervision and Monitoring \n \n50.  A consultant team will be hired to help MPW implement the Project. Team members will \nclosely coordinate with the project management unit (PMU) established under MPW and be \nresponsible for (i) overseeing overall project management; (ii) assisting with the procurement of \ncivil  works;  (iii)  supervising  construction  and  installation  of  equipment,  including  reviewing \ndetailed designs prepared by contractors; (iv) supervising implementation of the HIV/AIDS and \nanti-human trafficking component; (v) certifying completed works by force account as well as by \ncontractors; (vi) providing on-the-job training for MPW staff assigned to the consultant team, and ", "  13\nimplementing  and  supervising  the  training  component  of  the  Project;  and  (vii)  undertaking \nbenefit monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n5.  Incremental Project Management Support \n \n51.  The Project will finance the engagement of external auditors to audit project accounts \nand the payment of additional salary to MPW staff assigned to the PMU and the consultant \nteam.  \n \nC.  Cost Estimates \n \n52.  The total project cost is estimated at $55.3 million equivalent, including $304,000 of \ntaxes and duties and physical contingencies. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at $38.3 \nmillion, representing about 69% of the total cost. The local currency cost is estimated at $17.0 \nmillion equivalent, or about 31% of the total cost. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 6. \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n \n53.  On 25 August 2004, the Board of Governors by Resolution No. 300 authorized ADB, \nunder the Eighth Replenishment of the Asian Development Fund (ADF), to provide financing in \nthe form of grants (in addition to loans) for projects and programs of high developmental priority. \nSubsequently, on 21 January 2005, the Board of Directors amended the Asian Development \nFund Regulations to provide for the use of the ADF for grant financing in accordance with the \nrequirements of Resolution No. 300. Afghanistan is eligible for ADF grants up to 50% of the total \nADF allocation. \n \n54.  A recent analysis of debt sustainability by ADB and the International Monetary Fund  \nconcluded that funding for development projects should be on a grant basis, or on highly \nconcessional terms for key projects and reforms for which no grant funding can be mobilized. In \nview  of  the  extraordinary  challenges  inherent  in  coping  with  the  postconflict  situation, \nAfghanistan has requested enhanced concessionality through grant financing of the transition \nand reconstruction phase. Considering the fact that the project area is the most remote and \npoorest area in a country that requires highly concessional assistance, the proposed ADB \nassistance of $55 million will be provided by grant from ADF resources.   \n \n55.  The ADB grant will finance $55 million of the foreign exchange and local currency costs \nof the Project, excluding taxes and duties of $304,000 that will be incurred by the Government. \nThe  waiver  of  cost-sharing  limit  that  has  been  approved  for  loans  and  TA  operations  for \nAfghanistan is applied to the Project.21 The Government will make the grant available to the \nProject\u2019s Executing Agency through appropriate budgetary allocation.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n56.  MPW will be the Executing Agency. The Project will be implemented by the existing \nPMU, which handles the ongoing Kandahar-Spin Boldak Road Project and the road component \nof  the  EIRRP  (Appendix  7).  The  PMU  will  (i)  monitor  the  progress  of  day-to-day  project \n                                                 \n21  This is in accordance with the Board resolution on the Extension of the Waiver for the Cost-Sharing Limits for \nLoans and TA Operations for Afghanistan (28 January 2005).  ", "14  \nimplementation, (ii) prepare withdrawal applications, (iii) prepare project progress reports, and \n(iv) maintain project accounts and complete loan financial records for auditing. The deputy \nminister of MPW will have overall responsibility for project management as project director of \nthe  PMU.  The  current  PMU  includes  three  engineers,  one  accountant,  and  an  office \nadministrator who will continue to support the Project and be financed under the Project once \nthe ongoing projects are completed. MPW will also establish a project implementation unit (PIU) \nat the site comprising two engineers and one office administrator to liaise with the project \nmanagement consultants, contractors, the local government, and the people in the project area. \nThe PIU staff, stationed in the field, will handle day-to-day project implementation. The PMU will \nbe assisted by consultants engaged under the TA cluster (footnote 6): the project management \nand TA coordination specialist will continue to assist the PMU with overall project management, \nand  the  financial  management  and  auditing  specialist  will  assist  the  PMU  with  financial \nmanagement. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n57.  The Project is of an emergency nature and will be implemented over 33 months starting \nfrom the date of loan effectiveness. Using the design-build contract modality will reduce the lead \ntime  required  for  project  preparation.  The  consulting  services  contract  is  expected  to  be \nawarded and the consultant team mobilized by the end of 2005. Civil works contracts will be \nawarded by the end of the second quarter of 2006. Civil works will be completed in the second \nquarter of 2008 (Appendix 8). \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n58.  Goods, services, and civil works to be financed under the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Due to the emergency nature of project \nimplementation, the Government requested flexible application of such guidelines, including a \nshorter  bidding  period  of  60  days  for  the  procurement  of  civil  works  under  international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB). Civil works contracts will be procured through ICB. A single-stage \ntwo-envelope procedure with no separate prequalification, which was used in previous ADB-\nfinanced road projects in Afghanistan on a design-build basis and has proven effective in \nreducing the time required for procurement, will be adopted. Equipment for tolling facility will be \nprocured  by  international  shopping.  Indicative  contract  packages  are  in  Appendix  9.  All \ninternational procurement will be undertaken by the Government Procurement Unit operating \nunder ARDS.  \n \n59.  The project area is located in the western part of the country, where ADB nonmember \ncountries,  particularly  those  in  the  Gulf  region,  provide  competitive  sources  of  materials, \nespecially bitumen required for road pavement. Explicit procurement restrictions may preclude \ncivil works contractors under the Project from seeking the best business terms, and ultimately \nerode  economic  efficiency.  To  maximize  the  Project\u2019s  development  impact  and  economic \nefficiency, it is proposed that civil works contractors under the Project be allowed to procure the \nbitumen  required  for  road  pavement  from  all  countries,  including  those  that  are  not  ADB \nmembers. 22   This  special  treatment  was  applied  to  two  previous  transport  projects  in \nAfghanistan, i.e., the Regional Airports Rehabilitation Project and the Andkhoy-Qaisar Road \nProject, both approved in 2004. \n                                                 \n22  This is pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the ADB Charter, which provides that the Board may, by a vote of the directors \nrepresenting not less than two thirds of the total voting power of the members, agree to permit in special \ncircumstances procurement from non-ADB member countries. ", "  15\n4.  Consulting Services \n \n60.  All consultants financed from the ADB loan will be selected and engaged in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB \nfor recruiting of domestic consultants. Consulting services for construction supervision and \nmonitoring will be directly awarded to the Getinsa (Spain), given the firm\u2019s excellent work on the \nfeasibility study and preliminary design as well as preparation of the bid documents for the \nAndkhoy-Qaisar Road Improvement Project approved in December 2004. The proposed project \nroad passes through the most difficult terrain and remote areas in the Herat-Andkhoy ring road \nsection. Since the project preparatory TA consultants have worked in these areas during the TA \nstage,  they  are  well  set,  logistically,  to  carry  out  the  difficult  tasks  of  design  review  and \nconstruction supervision. They are also familiar with the workings of MPW, and line ministries, \nand  the  difficult  working  environment  in  Afghanistan.  Direct  selection  will  accelerate  the \nmobilization of consultants and save at least 6 months in project start-up. Early mobilization of \nconsultants will (i) facilitate the rapid rehabilitation of this missing link of Afghanistan\u2019s ring road \nand (ii) expedite procurement of civil works packages. The consulting services will require about \n96  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  about  150  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B. \n \n5.  Advance Action \n \n61.  In view of the high priority accorded to the Project by the Government, and to minimize \nimplementation delays and ensure timely completion of the Project, the Government requested \nADB approval for advance action for procurement of civil works packages including bidding and \nbid evaluation. ADB approved advance action for procurement of ICB civil works contracts. The \nGovernment was informed that the approval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance \nthe Project. The works related to advance action will be undertaken by the PMU established at \nMPW.  \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n62.  Grant funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nAn  imprest  account  primarily  for  incremental  expenditures  related  to  project  management \nsupport for MPW will be established under MOF, with a designated treasurer. The designated \ntreasurer  will  open  a  deposit  account  at  the  Da  Afghanistan  Bank  to  which  ADB\u2019s  grant \nproceeds will be transferred and against which the treasurer\u2019s checks will be issued. The initial \namount to be deposited into the imprest account will be estimated expenditures for 6 months or \n10% of the loan amount whichever is lower. The statement of expenditure procedures will be \nused for reimbursing eligible expenditures and liquidating the imprest account for any individual \npayment transaction up to $50,000 equivalent.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n63.  MPW will maintain separate accounts and records for the Project in accordance with \nsound accounting principles, adequate to identify the goods and services financed from the loan \nproceeds, financing resources, expenditures incurred for the Project, and the use of local funds. \nThe project accounts and related financial statements will be audited annually in accordance \nwith sound auditing standards by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited reports ", "16  \nand related financial statements will be submitted to ADB no later than 9 months23 after the end \nof the fiscal year. The annual audits will include an audit of the imprest account and statement \nof expenditure records, and a separate opinion on the audit. The unaudited project accounts \nand related financial statements will be submitted to ADB no later than 6 months after the end of \nthe fiscal year. The Government will assist ADB representatives to carry out spot and random \nchecks on the flow of funds and their use for the Project and on work in progress.  \n \n64.  MPW  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  on  performance  monitoring,  issues \nresolution, and periodic action plans. The quarterly reports will serve as feedback to update and \nimprove procedures and project implementation. Within 3 months of physical completion of the \nProject, MPW will submit a project completion report on the overall impact of the Project. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n65.  MPW will be responsible for overall project monitoring. The PMU will establish a system \nfor preparing quarterly reports, for performance monitoring and issues resolution, plus periodic \naction plans. Aided by the PMU, MPW will undertake quantitative and qualitative performance \nmonitoring of each project component to evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the \naccrued project benefits. With the help of the project management consultants and no later than \n3 months after loan effectiveness, the MOT will develop a comprehensive system for monitoring \nthe Project\u2019s performance. ADB will review and approve the system. ADB and the Government \nwill agree on the performance parameters to be monitored during project implementation and for \n3 months after project completion. \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n66.  ADB staff will review project implementation through regular or special review missions. \nThe project schedule calls for, a midterm review about 18 months after the Project starts, \naround  March  2007.  The  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  a  detailed  progress  report  on \nimplementation and achievements prior to the midterm review. Terms of reference for the \nmidterm review will be included in the project administration memorandum to be prepared by \nADB\u2019s Inception Mission for the Project.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Social and Poverty Impacts \n \n67.  In Afghanistan, approximately 53% of the population live on less than $1 a day and are \nclassified as poor24. The prolonged war in the country further exacerbated by drought in the \nproject area has severely affected the means of livelihood of the local population. The sample \nhousehold survey and consultations revealed that almost 90% of the households were engaged \nin subsistence agriculture and allied activities for their livelihood, while the rest had small \nbusinesses in the towns. The households in the project area are extremely poor, with an \naverage monthly income of approximately AF2,000 and average household size of 5.5 persons. \nDeclining farm productivity and loss of seasonal opportunities for agricultural labor are among of \nthe  main  determinants  of  poverty  in  the  area.  Lack  of primary  health  care  and  education \nfacilities is also among the major problems. The present state of infrastructure, especially roads, \n                                                 \n23 The weak capacity of MPW to maintain project accounts and prepare financial statements necessitates a longer \nperiod for submission of audited project accounts.  \n24  ADB. Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006): Afghanistan. Manila. ", "  17\nis  a  severe  constraint  to  revival  of  food  security,  livelihood  opportunities,  provision  and \naccessibility of social and economic services, and overall economic growth.  \n \n68.  The Project will provide both direct and indirect poverty reduction impacts. The direct \npoverty  impact  will  be  on  income  generation  and  demand  for  unskilled  labor  and  wages \naccruing to laborers during construction of the project road. Other benefits will result from lower \ntransportation costs and higher agricultural product profit margins. Improved roads and better \nconnectivity will encourage farmers to grow larger marketable surpluses that, in turn, will provide \nfor  expanded  agricultural  wage  employment,  particularly  benefiting  the  poor.  Lower \ntransportation costs will also increase mobility that will enable the poor to seek employment \nopportunities in other areas. Road improvement will facilitate more ready access to schools, \nmedical clinics, and employment centers. Improved regional transit and trade, another indirect \nbenefit,  similarly  will  generate  new  employment  opportunities,  further  facilitating  the \nrehabilitation  of  displaced  populations  and  ex-combatants,  interethnic  reconciliation,  and \nimprovement  of  security  and  stability.  In  addition  to  reducing  vehicle  operating  costs,  the \nimproved road will reduce accidental deaths and disabilities resulting from extremely poor road \nconditions. Thus, increased economic activity and easy access to social services are expected \nto significantly increase household incomes and enhance the quality of life, thereby reducing \noverall poverty incidence.25 The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix \n10. \n \nB.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n69.  Overall, the Project\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement impacts are not significant. Most \nof the improvement works will be carried out within the existing rights-of-way and so agricultural \nland acquisition will be minimal (0.08 ha). Acquisition of only small amounts of privately owned \ncommercial (0.06 ha) and residential (0.02 ha) land will be required. In total, 130 households \n(650 affected people) will suffer resettlement impacts as a result of the Project. Four households \nwill be affected by agricultural land acquisition and will lose 1% of their productive assets. None \nof the 2 residential and 121 commercial structures owned by the titleholders will be displaced \nand none will require any relocation. Three commercial squatter households whose structures \nwill be totally affected will be relocated or pushed back to the adjacent available government \nland. The residential structures will lose a very small portion of their homestead land and \nearthen  boundary  walls.  The  commercial  structures  will  lose  a  very  small  portion  of  their \ncommercial land and permanent or temporary extensions or shades of their shops. Land take \nand impact on commercial areas in towns could be further minimized or completely avoided \nduring detailed engineering design if the design stipulation of 0.5 m verge on each side of the \nroad is compromised in the built-up areas of Gormach and Chilgasi. The affected households \nwill receive cash for land and assets at replacement prices. Compensation will be provided for \nloss of income for temporary disruption caused during construction, shifting assistance and \nadditional assistance to vulnerable groups. No indigenous people will be affected by the Project. \nThe  estimated  cost  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  approximately  AF2,800,000 \n($60,000). A short resettlement plan (Supplementary Appendix C) will be translated into Dari \nand disclosed to the affected persons. The plan will also be publicly available at MPW, ADB\u2018s \nAfghanistan Resident Mission, and on the ADB web site. \n \n                                                 \n25  The findings are consistent with empirical evidence identified by ADB\u2019s regional TA 5947 (ADB. 2001. Technical \nAssistance for Assessing the Impact of Transport and Energy Infrastructure on Poverty Reduction. Manila). ", "18  \nC.  Economic Analysis \n \n70.  Economic analysis (Appendix 11) was conducted for the entire stretch of the Herat-\nAndkhoy road in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. The \nhighway design and maintenance model (HDM-III) was used to calculate vehicle operating costs \nand time costs, with modification for conditions in Afghanistan. The major inputs include vehicle \ncharacteristics and related costs, and construction and maintenance costs. The major benefits \nare derived from savings of vehicle operating costs and travel time due to the rehabilitation of \nthe project road, which will provide a stimulus for economic growth in the project area. The time \nrequired for traveling from Qaisar to Bala Murghab is currently about 8-10 hours. The Project \nwill reduce that time to 1.5\u20132.0 hours. The travel time on the entire Herat-Andkhoy road is \ncurrently more than 24 hours, and average travel speed is slightly more than 20 km/hour. With \nthe  planned  improvement  to  other  sections  of  the  Herat-Andkhoy  road,  the  Project  will \nsignificantly reduce travel time and cost, turning the painful road trip along that road into a safe \nsingle-day daylight trip. \n \n71.  The current traffic level is low because of the very poor condition of the road and the \noverall reduced economic activity due to many years of war and the recent severe drought. With \na strong economic recovery anticipated in the short term, a high level of generated and induced \ntraffic is expected. Considering this development prospect, the generated and induced traffic \nwas estimated in absolute numbers, assuming expected growth of outputs and activities and trip \nrates that will be realized 3 years after the project road becomes operational. \n \n72.  Economic evaluation resulted in an economic internal rate of return of 18.8% for the \noverall project road. The project road was evaluated up to and including 2028, for a benefit \nperiod of 20 years; a residual value of 10% was applied in 2028. The Project\u2019s economic costs \ninclude the resource costs for traded and nontraded materials and labor. All cost elements are \nvalued at border prices, using a world price numeraire, with all taxes and duties excluded. A \nstandard conversion factor of 0.90 was applied to the financial costs of nontraded inputs to \ncalculate economic prices. The traffic estimate is still conservative, as it does not include \ninternational  transit  traffic  from  the  three  neighboring  countries  (Iran,  Turkmenistan,  and \nUzbekistan) adjacent to Afghanistan\u2019s northwest region.  \n \nD.  Environmental Impact \n \n73.  The proposed Project is in category B according to ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines (2003). The initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared as part of the \nfeasibility study for the Herat\u2013Andkhoy road project. The IEE report was approved by MPW on \n11 August 2004.  \n \n74.  The IEE found that most of the environmental impacts associated with the Project would \noccur only during the construction period. Therefore the impacts are temporary and almost all \nthe mitigating measures will be incorporated in the contract document. The contractor will be \nbound by the agreement to strictly implement the proposed mitigating measures. The IEE states \nthat no further environmental assessment study is required because the environmental impacts \nare  temporary  and  insignificant.  MPW  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  overall \nenvironmental  monitoring  and  management  plan.  The  annual  report  on  implementing  this \nmonitoring and management plan will be submitted to ADB and other relevant Government \nagencies, if necessary. The summary IEE is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n ", "  19\nE.  Risks \n \n75.  Implementation of the Project entails a number of risks: \n \n(i)  The overall political and security situation remains volatile. ADB will need to \nclosely monitor the situation and coordinate with local and central authorities and \nthe United Nations to ensure adequate protection.26 ADB\u2019s TA for the security of \nADB-financed projects in Afghanistan (footnote 11) will give advice on how to \nensure  a  safe  work  environment  for  on-site  personnel  assigned  by  the \ncontractors, subcontractors, and consulting firms. Under prevailing conditions, \nhowever, this security risk cannot be mitigated completely, and delays in project \nimplementation, if security hazards occur in project locations, will be inevitable \ndespite measures to control the risk. \n(ii)  Regional  warlords  and  militia  leaders  retain  their  military  strength  and \nconsequent influence in regional politics. Such political instability could hamper \nthe smooth supply of raw materials and equipment transported through areas \nthey control, and might also constrain supervision of construction works by the \nconsultants and ADB staff.   \n(iii)  Improved roads can be used as a route to transport opium. The Government will \nimprove, as part of the national counternarcotics strategy, border procedures to \ncontain the trafficking of narcotics. However, the trafficking of narcotics cannot be \ncompletely contained unless the cultivation of opium poppy is eradicated.  \n(iv)  The  risks  of  road  connectivity  improvements  contributing  to  the  spread  of \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  are  addressed  by  the  Project\u2019s  HIV/AIDS \nprevention and anti-human trafficking component.  \n(v)  Because  Government  implementation  capacity  remains  very  weak, \nimplementation of key activities may be delayed. Also the lack of accounting and \nauditing  capacity  risks  corrupt  practices.  Resources  will  be  allocated  for \nconsulting  services  to  help  with  project  management  and  implementation. \nAdditional capacity-building initiatives focused on financial management have \nbeen provided under the TA cluster (footnote 6). The Government will establish a \nstrong  coordination  and  monitoring  mechanism.  ADB  will  also  field  review \nmissions as frequently as necessary. \n(vi)  The Government might have difficulty in meeting in a timely manner its project \ncost  obligations  such  as  operation  and  maintenance  costs  and  counterpart \nfunding. ADB will work closely with MPW to address this issue by examining \nmitigating measures to enhance road sector and government revenues. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n76.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  Security. The Government will make its best effort to provide adequate security \nfor the smooth and uninterrupted implementation of the Project. In addition, the \nGovernment will ensure that all civil works contracts will require the preparation \nof  an  action  plan  for  adequate  security  and  smooth  and  uninterrupted \nimplementation of the Project; that the cost of implementing such a plan will be \n                                                 \n26  Coordination with the provincial reconstruction teams providing security for development activities in the project \narea will also be explored.  ", "20  \nincluded  in  the  budget  for  such  civil  works;  and  that  such  a  plan  is  fully \nimplemented. \n(ii)  Drug trafficking. The Government will undertake concrete measures to detect \nand  prevent  opium  smuggling  by  land  transport,  including  improved  border \nprocedures. \n(iii)  Road  maintenance  financing.  The  Government  will  allocate  and  make \navailable, in a timely manner, sufficient funds from its budget for each fiscal year \nfor the operation and maintenance of the project facilities, and will ensure that \nsuch facilities are operated and maintained in accordance with sound practices. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  implementation  of  a  toll  collection  system  on \nimproved roads for their maintenance. To do this, the Government will adopt \nadequate procedures to promote transparency and accountability in collecting the \nproceeds from the toll collection system and other means of revenue generation, \nand will install proper procedures including spot audits to detect any abuse in \ncollecting and using the proceeds. \n(iv)  Road  safety.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  road  safety  measures  are \nincorporated in the design of the Project and that public awareness campaigns \nrelated to such measures are conducted on a periodic basis.  \n(v)  Spot audits. The Government will allow and assist ADB's representatives to \ncarry out spot and random checks on (a) flow of funds and their use for the \nProject, and (b) work in progress. \n(vi)  Anticorruption. The Government acknowledges that ADB reserves the right to \nundertake, directly or through its agents, investigation of any possible financial or \nmanagerial impropriety in the conduct of the Project. The Government and each \nof  its  relevant  agencies  will  fully  cooperate  with  any  such  investigation  and \nextend  all  necessary  assistance,  including  access  to  all  relevant  books  and \nrecords that may be needed for satisfactory completion of such investigations. \nThe Government will also ensure that (a) upon approval by ADB of the award of \nthe procurement contract package, the Government will publish in the dailies \ncirculated nationally, both in English and the local language, the bidder with the \nlowest evaluated substantially responsive bid and the agreed upon contract price, \ntogether with the names of other bidders considered; and (b) the Government will \nappoint within 3 months of grant effectiveness, a dedicated staff from the agency \nthat deals with anti-corruption efforts to monitor the implementation of ADB-\nfunded projects under MPW in accordance with the mandate of this agency. \n(vii)  Land acquisition and resettlement. The Government will ensure that land and \nrights-of-way will be acquired in a timely manner. The Government will also \nensure that the land acquisition and resettlement activities will be carried out in \naccordance with (a) all applicable laws and regulations of the Government, (b) \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  and  (c)  the  agreed-upon \nresettlement  plan.  The  Government  will  also  ensure  that  payment  of \ncompensation and other entitlements to the affected persons will be made prior \nto their relocation and the award of the civil works contract. \n(viii)  Updating,  disclosure,  and  monitoring  of  short  resettlement  plan.  The \nGovernment will, prior to the commencement of construction, (a) prepare an \nupdated resettlement plan based on a final detailed design, which is subject to \nADB approval and (b) cause MPW to disclose the updated resettlement plan and \nensure that the information will be available to all affected persons by posting \nsuch information on ADB\u2019s web site. The Government will also cause MPW to   \n(a)  submit  the  progress  and  completion  reports  on  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, (b) recruit NGOs to facilitate timely and effective implementation ", "  21\nand monitoring of the resettlement plan, and (c) establish grievance redress \ncommittees at the district level to address environmental, resettlement, and other \nsocial issues promptly. In accordance with the updated resettlement plan, the \ngrievance redress committees will be formed with the task of resolving land \nacquisition and resettlement disputes. In the event that any adverse impacts on \nindigenous people are identified during project implementation, the Government \nwill prepare an indigenous peoples development plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Indigenous People (1998). \n(ix)  Environmental protection. The Government will ensure that the preparation, \ndesign, construction, implementation, and operation of the Project will be done in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  the  IEE,  and  the \nenvironmental monitoring plan. For this purpose the Government will make an \nadequate  budget  available,  and  ensure  that  all  mitigating  and  monitoring \nmeasures  set  out  in  the  IEE  and  the  environment  monitoring  plan  are \nincorporated in the project design, including a detailed design of the project \nfacilities,  and  implemented  during  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance \nthereof.  \n(x)  Local consultation and gender. The Government will ensure that a specific \nplan for local consultation to address safety, social, and cultural issues during \nproject  implementation  will  be  included  in  the  bidding  documents.  The \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  men  and  women  are  given  equal  employment \nopportunities, without any difference in wages for equal work by the civil works \ncontractors. The mechanisms for maximizing local employment benefits will be \nincluded in the project design and the bidding documents.  \n(xi)  Labor, health risks and provisions. MPW will ensure that civil works contracts \nincorporate provisions requiring contractors to (a) carry out HIV/AIDS and STIs \nawareness and prevention programs for labor; (b) disseminate information at \nwork sites and in the overall project area on risks of STIs and HIV/AIDS as part of \nhealth  and  safety  measures  for  those  employed  during  construction;  (c)  not \nemploy children for construction and maintenance works; and (d) follow and \nimplement legally mandated provisions on labor (including equal pay for equal \nwork), health, safety, sanitation, and working conditions; (e) eliminate all forms of \nforced or compulsory labor; and (f) allow freedom of association and the right of \ncollective bargaining.  \n(xii)  Implementation  of  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-human  trafficking \ncomponent. MPW will ensure that MOPH deputes an official to the PMU to carry \nout the HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-human trafficking component as agreed \nupon with ADB. MPW through MOPH support will engage qualified locally based \nNGOs  to  implement  the  component.  MPW,  through  its  PMUs  and  with  the \nsupport of MOPH, will supervise and monitor the activities of the NGOs. \n(xiii)  The PIU. Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will ensure that \nthe additionally required PIU staff, comprising two engineers and other office \nadministration staff, will have been appointed. \n \nVI.

Road Network \n \n1.  Afghanistan\u2019s road network comprises about 6,100 kilometers (km) of national roads and \n15,000 km of provincial roads. Of the national roads, 3,300 km comprise national primary roads \nincluding 2,400 km that had been originally paved. The national primary road network consists \nlargely of the 2,300 km ring road that connects Afghanistan\u2019s major regional centers (Herat, \nKandahar, Mazar-e-Sharif, Maimana, and Sheberghan) with Kabul, and the roads leading to \nneighboring countries including Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The \nremaining 2,800 km of national roads constitute secondary roads with either gravel or earthen \nsurface. Provincial roads of 15,000 km have of gravel or earthen surface, and are categorized \ninto provincial primary roads (5,400 km) and provincial secondary roads (9,600 km). The tertiary \nroad network consists of rural roads that are roughly estimated to be 15,000\u201320,000 km, and \nsubstantial lengths of urban roads roughly estimated to be 3,000 km including 1,060 km in \nKabul. \n \n2.  Most of the national primary road network was improved to paved standard before the \nconflict, mainly with external assistance. The ring road section from the border of Jawzjan-\nFaryab Province to Herat (575 km) was left unpaved due to the outbreak of civil conflict.  \n \n3.  Much of Afghanistan\u2019s road infrastructure was destroyed or damaged in more than two \ndecades of conflict. Lack of resources and capacity prevented maintenance, and has led to \nmajor  deterioration  and  loss  of  infrastructure.  The  effects  of  military  actions  are  more \npronounced in the form of damaged bridges and tunnels, which have become bottlenecks to the \nmovement of people and goods. Restricted movement aggravates the country\u2019s division and \ndisintegration, as travel time and vehicle operating cost on roads have significantly increased.1 \n  \n4.  According to the comprehensive needs assessment on the Afghanistan transport sector, \ncarried out during March\u2013May 2002 by major external funding agencies including the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), 54% of the national roads are in poor condition, 26% in fair condition, \nand only 20% in good condition. It urged that the entire primary road network be rehabilitated on \na priority basis.2 \n \n5.  Afghanistan\u2019s road network is characterized by very low road density (Table A2.1). The \nroad density of 0.03 km per square km (km2) is far lower than that of the Kyrgyz Republic and \nTajikistan, which also have largely mountainous terrain and similar population densities. It is \neven lower than the 0.07 km/km2 road density of Balochistan in Pakistan, whose population \ndensity is about half of Afghanistan\u2019s. Even without the damage inflicted during the conflict \nperiod,  Afghanistan\u2019s  road  network  is  in  need  of  substantial  improvement  (Table  A2.2)  to \nprovide basic connectivity that is available elsewhere in the subregion.   \n                                                 \n1  Travel from Kabul to Kandahar (1,066 km) used to take less than 12 hours before the conflict. Soon after the \nconflict, it took about 30 hours with a four-wheel drive vehicle. \n2  A preliminary needs assessment conducted in December 2001 by ADB, United Nations Development Programme, \nand World Bank, was presented at the ministerial meeting in Tokyo in January 2002, where external funding \nagencies pledged about $4.5 billion assistance.   \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nTable A2.1: Comparison of Key Road Subsector Indicators \nGNP per Capita  Road Density     Motor Vehicles \nCountry  in 2002  in 2000  Percent of Road  per 1,000 People  \n($)  (km/square km)  Paved  in 2000 \nAfghanistan   186  0.032  16  14 \nAzerbaijan  710  0.287  92  49 \nBangladesh  360  1.441  9  1 \nIndia  480  1.010  46  8 \nIndonesia  710  0.180  47  25 \nKyrgyz Republic  290  0.170  40  \u2014 \nNepal  230  0.090  31  \u2014 \nPakistan  410  0.320  43  8 \nSri Lanka  840  1.465  95  34 \nTajikistan  180  0.194  83  \u2014 \nTurkmenistan          1,200  0.049  81  \u2014 \nUzbekistan  450  0.183  87  \u2014 \n\u2014 = not available, GNP = gross national product, km = kilometer. \nSources: World Bank. 2002.

Vehicle Fleet and Road Transport Industry \n \n6.  The number of vehicles has increased significantly over the past 2 years. According to \nstatistics provided in a recent International Monetary Fund country report on Afghanistan,3 \ntransport of goods by road increased from 1.9 million tons (t) in 2000 to 3.7 million t in 2001 and \n5 million t in 2002, representing an almost fourfold increase. The number of taxicabs nearly \ndoubled from 17,000 in 2000 to 33,500 in 2002. More than 147,000 vehicles are estimated to be \nregistered  in  Kabul,  which  under  certain  assumptions  would  translate  into  about  304,000 \nvehicles countrywide. Most vehicles are owned and operated by the private sector.  \n \n7.  The Ministry of Transport (MOT)-operated fleet has been severely depleted. According \nto the Central Statistical Office, in 2002 the Government owned and operated 22,459 vehicles \nconsisting of 10,913 trucks (MOT: 210), 2,741 buses (MOT Millie buses: 230), and 8,162 cars, \nbut nearly all these vehicles are gone. According to the Transport Sector Review, the centrally \nowned bus and lorry companies and also the trolley bus service have practically collapsed. \nMOT now has some of the Kamaz freight agencies and the Millie bus agency. MOT retains a \ntrolley bus department, but no vehicles, workshops, or power supply network, which have all \nbeen destroyed. \n \n8.  The Afghan private sector including individuals and firms that relocated in Pakistan \nduring the war years has historically played a dominant role in trucking and has maintained its \npresence. As expected, long distance public transport linking major cities and neighboring \ncountries  has  deteriorated  due  to  road  and  vehicle  conditions  as  well  as  the  suppressed \ndemand for road travel. Security remains a key concern. Urban transport is available on a \nlimited scale in Kabul and provincial capitals. \n \n9.  Urban  transport,  once  dominated  by  the  public  sector,  is  now  mostly  provided  by \nprivately owned buses, taxis, and minivans. Forms of regional transport depend on the state of \nthe  roads  and  the  availability  of  vehicles.  People  and  goods  move  together,  blurring  the \ndistinction  between  passenger  and  commercial  freight  traffic.  Private  agencies  operate \nprovincial and district routes. Some 165 registered long-distance private bus companies are \nestimated to be operating\u2014101 based in Kabul, 64 in the provinces\u2014with a total of 14,007 \nbuses, mostly old minibuses and vans. \n10.  The taxi system in Afghanistan is widespread and well organized. According to MOT, 24 \ntaxi  unions  registered  in  Kabul  and  27  in  the  provinces  have  a  total  of  29,131  vehicles. \n                                                 \n3  International Monetary Fund. 2003. Islamic State of Afghanistan: Rebuilding a Macroeconomic Framework for \nReconstruction and Growth. Washington, DC: IMF. \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nAccording to the Transport Sector Review, the real number of taxis in Kabul is perhaps 30,000. \nTaxis seem to operate freely, with little adherence to zonal or any other rules. In addition, \nintermediate- size vehicles of all sizes and shapes also transport passengers and goods. \n \nC.   Road Administration \n \n11.  Road administration is highly centralized. Before the protracted hostilities, the Ministry of \nPublic Works (MPW), through its 15 departments, was virtually responsible for all government \nconstruction and maintenance, including roads and bridges, airports, public housing, and water \nsupply. All aspects of planning, design, construction, and maintenance were carried out in-\nhouse  through  a  number  of  MPW  construction  units.  Before  1992,  just  one  of  MPW\u2019s \ndepartments,  Road  Construction  and  Development,  had  more  than  5,000  employees.  In \naddition, MPW had a multitude of other responsibilities such as city planning and collection of \nroad tolls. Theoretically, MPW retains all these responsibilities. The Ministry of Rehabilitation \nand Rural Development is responsible for developing rural infrastructure, including rural roads. \nConstruction and maintenance of urban roads are the responsibility of municipalities. \n \n12.  Over the course of the conflict, the Government ministries lost a majority of their trained \nstaff. In provinces where staff and equipment were retained, they were often under the influence \nof provincial governments and not under the full control of the ministry headquarters in Kabul. \nThe situation is gradually being realigned as the central Government successfully extends its \ncontrol outside Kabul to the provinces. The current staffing level of MPW is about 2,900, of \nwhom 900 are employed on a permanent basis, 1,900 are paid daily wages, and 140 are \nmilitary officers. Most of the current staff require substantial skills enhancement to perform their \nduties. \n \n13.  To fill the capacity gap, most of the externally funded projects are being implemented \nwith  the  assistance  of  international  consultants  in  project  management.  Civil  works  are \npackaged into large contracts and bid out through competitive procedures to private sector \ncontractors. Consultants engaged by MPW supervise the works of contractors. MPW is being \ntransformed into a lean and thin organization with its primary task being nationwide policy \nformation, planning the countrywide road network, setting standards (including technical, safety, \nsocial, and environmental safeguards), regulation and enforcement functions, and management \nof roads under its jurisdiction (Figure A2). \n \n \n \nFigure A2: Current Organizational Structure of the Ministry of Public Works \n \n \n  Minister \n \n \n \nDeputy Minister \n \n \n \n  Directorate  Directorate  Directorate of  Directorate of  Directorate of \n  of Railways  of Planning  Administration  Road  Road Construction \n  Maintenance and Airports\n \nDirectorate of  Directorate of  Directorate of  Directorate of \nSurvey and  Financial  Audit and  Technical/ \nProject Design  Administration Controller Mechanical \n ", "Appendix 2  29\nD.   Road Subsector Revenues and Expenditures \n \n14.  Currently,  capital  investment  to  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  roads  in  Afghanistan  is \nmainly  financed  by  external  assistance.  The  current  commitments  to  Afghanistan\u2019s  road \nsubsector by the external bilateral/multilateral funding agencies amount to approximately $1 \nbillion, including $800 million for national primary roads, $130 million for national secondary \nroads,  and  $30  million  for  provincial  roads.  These  commitments  are  mainly  to  rehabilitate \ndamaged roads.  \n \n15.  For the improvement of the road network, the Government has set a target to double the \nshare of total paved roads from the present 16% to 32% by 2010, or from the present 0.15 km \nof paved roads per 1,000 people to 0.23 km per 1,000 in 2010. To reach this target, the new \ninvestment needs from 2004 to 2010 will be for $4.3 billion outside the existing commitment: \n$1.7 billion for national primary roads, $1.1 billion for national secondary roads, and $1.5 billion \nfor provincial roads.4 Considering the limited prospect for private sector financing of these large \ninvestments in the foreseeable future, the public sector will continue to be responsible for filling \nthe financing gap.  \n \n16.  Afghanistan has a history of toll collection for road maintenance. The first toll system \nwas implemented in 1974. Tolls were collected by way of a system of toll stations scattered \nthroughout the country, and the revenue accrued to the central revenue fund with no earmarking \nfor the road subsector. The allocations to the road subsector were by way of appropriations from \nthe central revenue fund. A new system implemented in 1999 introduced earmarking the funds \nfor construction and maintenance of highways. MPW organized toll collection and the tolls were \nviewed as a source of MPW revenue. Through a decision by the High Council of Ministers on 23 \nSeptember  2002,  this  road  toll  system  was  abolished.  Private  parties  had  established \nunauthorized  toll  collection  stations  in  a  number  of  locations,  which  created  hardships  for \ntravelers without contributing to the maintenance program.  \n \n17.  At present, fuel, spares, or vehicles are not taxed, except for customs duties. Some \nfees/levies are charged by the Ministry of Interior and the Provincial Finance Department for \nvehicle registration and renewal.  \n \n18.  The Government is in the process of establishing a tax regime. A few more years may \nbe required to fully implement the new tax regime. In the meantime, imposing tolls, in particular \non roads that have recently been rehabilitated, is viewed as an effective way to generate much-\nneeded revenue for road-related expenditure. Approximately $80 million is estimated to be \nrequired annually to maintain the entire road network. For a country with domestic revenues of \n$300 million, this will be a challenge. The Government is currently considering reinstating toll \ncollection on improved road sections5 to cover the maintenance cost as well as to recover part \nof the capital investment cost.  \n \nE.   Road Maintenance \n \n19.  As the rehabilitation and reconstruction work progresses, new assets are being created, \nadding to the already high demand for road maintenance activities. Under the ongoing civil \nservices reform, MPW has taken positive steps toward institutional reform by nominating its \n                                                 \n4  Government of Afghanistan. 2004.

As asset manager of the national road network, MPW will have limited options: (i) it can \ncontract out large corridors to private sector contractors on an annual or multiyear specification-\nbased maintenance contract; or (ii) for some strategic locations and to take care of emergency \nsituations,  it  can  use  its  own  fleet  of  maintenance  equipment  and  personnel.

Introduction \n \n1.  Experience across the Asian region shows that the opening up of border areas and freer \nborder crossing arrangements may result in \n \n(i)  an  increase  in  border  traffic  leading  to  a  potential  increase  in  the  spread  of \nHIV/AIDS1 through migrant laborers as well as commercial travelers (such as truck \ndrivers), the introduction of sex workers (SWs) in the project area due to poverty, and \nincreased access to intravenous drugs by injecting drug users (IDUs), the high-risk \ngroups for contracting and spreading HIV/AIDS in the project road area; and \n(ii)  a  higher  potential  for  human  trafficking,  a  practice  known  to  be  occurring  both \ninternally and internationally. \n \nB.  The Current HIV/AIDS Situation \n \n2.  Afghanistan is, on the surface, a conservative Islamic country, making the topic of \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking a sensitive issue to discuss. The World Health Organization \n(WHO) reports that there is no reliable data on HIV/AIDS infection rates within Afghanistan. The \nMinistry of Public Health (MOPH) has reported 31 cases of HIV/AIDS and 3 deaths, but it is \nfeared that so many more cases out of the country\u2019s 22 million population go undetected and \nunreported.  Of  the  cases  reported  and  suspected  unreported  ones,  a  high  percentage  of \nHIV/AIDS  spread  is  supposed  to  have  occurred  through  unprotected  homo-  and  hetero-\nsexuality,  blood  donations  for  money  during  the  Taliban  regime,  and  unscreened  blood \ntransfusions. As women were discouraged from leaving the home during the Taliban regime, \nHIV/AIDS  infection  among  the  Afghan  female  population  from  their  husbands  and  family \nmembers, and among younger children, is unknown. However, it is suspected that during the \nTaliban regime, poverty must have prompted male relatives to donate blood and most likely \ncaused HIV/AIDS to be more prevalent. Information from the Integrated Regional Information \nNetworks (IRIN) of the UN Office for Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) indicates \na high risk of HIV infection from persons coming from other HIV affected countries, including \nAfghan  returnees,  expatriates,  military  personnel  (international  security  assistance  force, \nCoalition, etc.). However, it is impossible to test and detect HIV cases, considering the absence \nof testing facilities.   \n \n3.  Following  discussions  with  MOPH,  it  is  understood  that  all  provincial  capitals  have \nHIV/AIDS testing facility; however, they lack the technical expertise and the capacity to carry out \ntesting. With assistance from the United Nations Population Fund (UNPFA) and United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), MOPH has opened a Voluntary Counselling and Testing Centre in \nKabul, which will start functioning very soon. As a first step and support from aid partners \n(UNPFA and UNICEF), MOPH through its National HIV/AIDS Control Program (NACP) together \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Religious  Affairs  had  also  organized  a  Religious  Leaders  National \nConsultative Conference on HIV/AIDS in July 2004, where the role of religious leaders on \nraising awareness on HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) was identified and a \nfuture action plan was prepared. \n \n                                                 \n1 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n ", "Appendix 4  33\nC.  The Current Human Trafficking Situation \n \n4.  Human  trafficking  is  the  forced  removal  and  migration  of  people  against  their  will. \nAccording to the International Organisation for Migration, Afghanistan is prone to both internal \nand international trafficking. Human trafficking victims are often women and children, usually \ndestined for Middle Eastern countries. There are numerous types of human trafficking-related \nactivities, some of which are internal and others international, but many of which have been \nlinked to poverty in the country. They include (i) commercial sex work, (ii) supposed forced labor \nin the carpet industry and servitude (as believed by the local nongovernment organizations \n[NGOs]), (iii) supposed forced recruitment into armed groups, (iv) supposed forced religious \ntraining, and (v) sale of body organs. Poppy cultivation is also supposed to be a sign of poverty \nand human trafficking for labor, but it is said that people voluntarily cultivate poppy as it provides \nsubstantial financial return. One of the key concerns of the Central and South Asia Transport \nand  Trade  Forum  (CSATTF)2  is  prevention  of  human  trafficking.  One  of  the  key \nrecommendations  is  to  develop,  fund,  and  implement  training  programs  for  judicial,  legal, \nmedical, and social services for police and customs and/or immigration personnel to sensitize \nthem to the serious nature of trafficking in persons and the gender-based violence it often \nentails. Awareness and training programs will enable them to identify situations of trafficking in \npersons and to treat the victims adequately. It was also proposed that the training programs be \ncarried out together with specialized NGOs to improve cooperation between NGOs and the \nauthorities. \n \nD.  Guiding  Principles  of  the  Strategy  for  HIV/AIDS  and  Anti-Human  Trafficking \nAwareness  \n \n5.  Many international and national NGOs, UNICEF, WHO, and UNFPA are all working in \nthe area of HIV/AIDS and STIs in Afghanistan. However, a common refrain is that HIV/AIDS is a \ndifficult issue to broach in a conservative society like that in Afghanistan. After consultation with \naid  agencies  (WHO,  UNFPA),  international  NGOs,  local  NGOs,  and  MOPH,  the  following \nguiding principles for this component were formulated: \n \n(i)  An  awareness  program  on  HIV/AIDS  will  be  designed  in  line  with  NACP.  Any \nintervention  program  should  be  designed  and  implemented  in  coordination  with \nMOPH and in consultation with other aid partners. \n(ii)  Sensitization workshops will be carried out by MOPH with support from aid partners \nfor Ministry of Public Works (MPW), Department of Religious Affairs, and partner \nNGOs  to  emphasize  the  linkage  between  construction  of  highways/cross-border \nfacilities and transmission of HIV/AIDS and anti-human trafficking. \n(iii)  HIV/AIDS and anti-human trafficking awareness will be implemented not as a stand-\nalone component but rather integrated with relevant ongoing aid assisted projects or \nelse  discussed  along  with  other  priority  issues  linked  to  basic  health  services, \nreproductive health, hygiene awareness, and literacy programs.  \n(iv)  For  better  outreach,  community  leaders,  opinion  leaders,  religious  leaders,  and \nwomen\u2019s organizations will be involved to provide community-level awareness and \ntraining on HIV/AIDS and anti-human trafficking. \n                                                 \n2 The main objective of the CSATTF is enhanced economic development through promotion of transport and trade. \nMembers include Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.  \n ", "34    Appendix 4 \n(v)  As a starting point, HIV/AIDS and STIs and anti-human trafficking awareness will be \ninitiated in the cities/urban areas, marketplaces; once successful, the issues will be \ndisseminated in the remote areas.3 \n(vi)  MPW with assistance from MOPH will collaborate with different aid partners (WHO, \nUNFPA, UNICEF, World Bank, and others) to prepare a detailed operational plan for \nHIV/AIDS and anti-human trafficking awareness for the Project. \n(vii)  MPW with assistance from the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) will collaborate with \ndifferent aid partners (WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF, World Bank, UNODC, UNICEF and \nothers) to seek technical expertise on training, capacity building on HIV/AIDS and \nant-human trafficking issues, and support for counselling, condom distribution, and \ntreatment services. \n \nE.  HIV/AIDS Prevention and Anti-Human Trafficking Support \n \n6.  Based on the seven guiding principles, the following activities have been proposed as \npart of the Project. Further details will be discussed and an operational plan will be prepared in \ncollaboration with MPW, MOH, aid partners (WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF, World Bank, United \nNations Office on Drugs and Crimes [UNODC] and others), and NGOs during implementation.  \n \n7.  HIV/AIDS  Subcomponent.  The  key  areas  of  activities  of  the  following  HIV/AIDS \nawareness subcomponent are the: \n \n(i)  orientation and sensitization of MPW, MOPH, and project personnel on HIV/AIDS \nand STIs; \n(ii)  formation of advocacy groups on HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention within the \nprovincial  and  district  administration,  including  the  Department  of  Religious \nAffairs, and briefing them on the same; \n(iii)  conducting briefing sessions for imams, mullahs at the district level, and opinion \nleaders and community leaders at the village/community level; \n(iv)  raising HIV/AIDS awareness for contractors, construction workers, IDUs, and \ncommunities and villages along the project road with referral information and \ncondom distribution; \n(v)  public  awareness  campaign  for  high-risk  groups  (e.g.,  truck  drivers/helpers, \nidentified  SWs,  construction  workers,  IDUs,  and  vulnerable  groups)  and  the \ngeneral  public  along  the  project  road  through  video  films/documentaries, \ninformation  education  communication  materials  at  key  spots  (rest  areas, \nmarketplaces, hospitals, and clinics) and door-to-door counseling;  \n(vi)  promotion and distribution of condoms at critical points and during training for \nawareness raising; and \n(vii)   giving  out  referral  information  on  the  nearest  available  services  for  testing, \ncounseling, and treatment. \n \n8.  Anti-Trafficking  Subcomponent.  The  anti-trafficking  awareness  subcomponent  will \nhave these key areas of activities: \n \n                                                 \n3  Presently, only generating awareness on the health implications of HIV/AIDS is being carried out.  Discussions of \nsuch issues as sex and the use of condoms are taboo.  Nevertheless, these issues could be gradually introduced \nby taking into confidence the community and opinion leaders and religious leaders. \n ", "Appendix 4  35\n(i)  sensitization and capacity building for MPW, MOPH, project personnel, border \npolice, customs officials, and local NGOs on the issue of anti-human trafficking; \nand \n(ii)  raising  public  awareness  through  public  media  and  information  education \ncommunication  materials  including  hoardings  in  the  important  junctions  and \ntarget  group  of  commercial  SWs,  vulnerable  groups  especially  women  and \nchildren. Awareness generation will focus on (a) conveying a behavioral change \nmessage; (b) providing safe migration tips especially to high risk groups, and \nequipping  them  with  information  on  police  telephone  numbers  and  other \nnecessary resources; (c) assisting local NGOs to coordinate with the police to \ninvestigate  suspected  transporters  and  human  traffickers;  (d)  networking  in \nAfghanistan with NGOs and international aid agencies, and support efforts to \nidentify  and  rescue  trafficked  women,  men,  and  children  and  provide  family \nrehabilitation; (e) training police, customs, and other relevant organizations and \ncommunity in the vulnerability and dangers of Human trafficking; (f) strengthening \nformal links of local NGOs with the border police and the immigration/customs \ndepartment; (g) assisting the police and immigration and/or customs department \nto  further  build  capacity  and  expedite  the  development  of  a  framework  and \nprocedures to identify suspected human trafficking; and (h) strengthening the \nNGO intelligence information database and information sharing arrangements \nwith customs and police counterparts.   \n \nF.  Implementation  \n \n9.  The component will be executed intermittently for a period of 2 years. MPW will be the \nexecuting agency with responsibility for overall implementation through its project management \nunit (PMU). An official, deputed from MOPH in the PMU, will be responsible for providing \ntechnical support in terms of training, capacity building, and designing awareness programs in \ncollaboration with the other aid agencies (WHO, UNFPA, World Bank, UNODC, UNICEF, and \nothers);  assisting  in  networking  with  partner  NGOs,  religious  leaders,  community/opinion \nleaders;  preparing  terms  of  reference;  and  engaging  suitable  NGO  partners  for  program \nimplementation. Two local NGOs (or one big local NGO with adequate manpower) are expected \nto be recruited for the purpose. The NGOs will have prior experience in working on the issue of \nreproductive health, HIV/AIDS/STI awareness, and anti-human trafficking. Target groups are \nconstruction workers, truckers, SWs, IDUs, immigration/customs and police officials, and the \nlocal population in the immediate project influence area. While the construction workers will be \naddressed at the construction sites/camps, truckers will be addressed at eating places in the \ntown markets. The local population willbe addressed through a door-to-door campaign. MPW \nthrough the support of the deputed official of MOPH will coordinate and monitor the day-to-day \nexecution of the program through the NGOs. The Asian Development Bank health specialist \nand gender specialist based in the Afghanistan Resident Mission will provide technical support, \nand review and monitor program implementation regularly. \n \nG.   Reporting, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n \n10.  MPW through its PMU assisted by the deputed official from MOPH will be responsible \nfor overall monitoring of the program. Monitoring and evaluation for this program will be based \non  activities  undertaken  through  NGOs.  The  NGOs  will  be  required  to  submit  (i)  a \nplanning/inception report (ii) quarterly reports (iii) annual reports, and (iv) a final report. \n \n ", "36    Appendix 4 \nH.

Proposed Design Standards. The design standards proposed for the project road are \nthose  generally  adopted  in  Afghanistan,  which  refer  to  the  American  Association  of  State \nHighway  and  Transportation  Officials  standards.  For  different  terrain  conditions,  minimum \ndesign standards corresponding to the following design speeds are adopted: (i) flat terrain (80 \nkm/hour), (ii) rolling terrain (60 km/hour), and (iii) mountainous terrain(40 km/hour). The main \ngeometric standard parameters are in Table A5. The typical cross section suggested for the \nroad in flat and rolling terrains is of two traffic lanes each 3.50 m wide, with two hard shoulders \nof 1.5 m and two verges of 0.5 m, with a total width of 11.0 m. To reduce the construction cost in \nmountainous terrain, the typical cross section suggested is reduced from 10.0 m to 8.0 m, by \nreducing the width of the shoulders to 0.5 m. The suggested pavement design includes a 90 \nmillimeter asphalt concrete layer. \n \nTable A5: Main Parameters of Geometric Design Standards for the Project \nDesign Element  Unit  Flat  Rolling  Mountainous Urban \nDesign Speed  km/h  80  60  40  50 \nMinimum Stopping Sight Distance  m  110  85  55  55 \nMinimum Passing Sight Distance  m  275  225  125  175 \nMinimum Horizontal Radius  m  175  125  50  50 \nMinimum Horizontal Radius (exceptional)  m  \u2014  \u2014  25  \u2014 \nTransition Curves Required    Yes  Yes  No  No \nMaximum Gradient  %  6  8  14  14 \nMaximum Gradient (exceptional)  %  \u2014  \u2014  18  18 \nMaximum Superelevation  %  7  7  7  4 \nMinimum Crest Vertical Radius  m  6,000  2,500  1,500  2,000 \nMinimum Sag Vertical Radius  m  3,000  2,000  1,000  1,000 \nMinimum Vertical Radius (exceptional)  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  600  \u2014 \nTraffic Lane Normal Crossfall  %  2.5  2.5  2.5  2.5 \nShoulder Normal Crossfall  %  4  4  4  4 \n\u2014 = not available, h = hour, km = kilometer, m = meter. \nSource: Feasibility study for the Herat-Andkhoy Road Improvement Project. \n ", "38  Appendix 6 \nCOST ESTIMATES \n($\u2019000) \n \nForeign  Local  Total       \nItem\nExchange Currency Cost\nA.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Afghanistan: \n \nThe Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan has accorded highest priority to the development of road \ninfrastructure. Because it is recognizes of the importance of an efficient, reliable road network in a landlocked country \nand its contribution to poverty reduction. The inadequate road system keeps many farmers dependent on subsistence \nagriculture with no, or limited, access to markets, education, and health care. The project road (90 km) from Qaisar to \nBala Murghab is part of the 550 km stretch of road between Herat and Andkhoy, which runs through one of the most \nremote and least developed areas of the country. The existing road was never paved and is merely a track of mud \nroad where most sections easily turn impassable after the rains. Rehabilitating and improving this road to a standard \nallowing easy motor vehicle movement will complete the missing link of the ring road and facilitate political integration \nof the country, contributing to employment creation, and income generation for poor households, rehabilitation of \ninternally and/or internationally displaced persons and ex-combatants. The road will also open up a trade route that \nconnects the northern part of Afghanistan and neighboring Uzbekistan and Tajikistan to the western part of the \ncountry, and further to Iran, forming a subregional road transport corridor. The project proposes to utilize, to the extent \npossible,  labor-intensive  construction  methods  to  provide  much-needed  employment  and  income-generating \nopportunities during project implementation, and use the services of the local population for the post-construction \nmaintenance activities. It will contribute to social stability and poverty reduction by engaging, among others the \nrefugees and ex-combatants. Thus, the investment is expected to significantly improve the socioeconomic situation \nand mitigate the pervasive poverty in the project area.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                            Poverty Classification:  General intervention \n \n  What type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nIn Afghanistan, approximately 53% of the population are classified as poor1 and live on less than $1 a day.  The road \npasses through the provinces of Faryab and Badghis and the project influence area is known to be drought prone. \nPeople have traditionally grown poppy because the absence of a good road and public transport system prevents \nthem from selling their marketable crop surpluses. The prolonged war in the country further aggravated by drought has \nseverely affected the livelihood sources of the local population. Only in areas such as Gormach, Bala Murghab in \nBadghis Province, where some irrigation facilities are available due to the presence of a flowing river, people cultivate \nwheat and watermelon instead of poppy.2 Decreased farm productivity due to prolonged drought has been the norm; \nhowever, this year\u2019s monsoons have been unprecedented in the last 20 years and farmers have farmed even hilltops \nand desert lands. The sample household survey and consultations carried out revealed that almost 90% of the \nhouseholds were engaged in subsistence agriculture and allied activities for their livelihood, while the rest had small \nbusinesses in the towns. Only in the Qaisar region are cash crops like raisins grown with marketable surpluses. The \nsurvey also revealed that the households in the project area are extremely poor, with an average monthly income of \napproximately AF2,000 and an average household size of 5.5. Households near the Bala Murghab section of the road \ndo not have cash income, as the crops they grow are not even sufficient for their consumption. Thus, reduced farm \nproductivity and loss of seasonal opportunities for agriculture labor are two of the main determinants of poverty in the \narea. \n \nAfghanistan ranks the 4th highest in mortality of those under five at 257 deaths/1,000. The infant mortality rate is at a \nhigh 165/1,000.The survey also indicated that there were no government hospitals or primary health care centers in \nthe four towns (Kaizar, Chechaktu, Chilgasi, and Gormach) to be traversed by the project road.  The local population \ndepend primarily on private clinics present in the four towns for minor ailments or routine checkups. For any serious \nillness, they hire private vehicles and travel 3\u20138 hours by road to reach the two provincial capitals of Qalai-Naw and \nMaimana to avail themselves of better health care facilities. Due to lack of a public transport system in the area, the \nrental charges of private vehicles are extremely high and thus health care is considered an expensive proposition. \nLack of adequate educational facilities was also another major problem in the project area. Although the towns of both \nQaisar and Gormach had primary and secondary schools, Gormach, which was worse affected during the Taliban \nregime, did not have teachers and, consequently, no students. Poor road conditions and accessibility and lack of \nsecurity in the project area discourage teachers from other parts of Afghanistan from working in this region.   \n                                                                  \n1  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2004-2006): Afghanistan. Manila \n ", "Appendix 10  43\nThe project would lead to both direct and indirect poverty reduction impacts. The direct poverty impact would be \nincome generation and demand for unskilled labor and wages accruing to the area during construction of the project \nroad. Other benefits will become evident in lower travel costs and higher agricultural product profit margins.  Improved \nroads and better connectivity will allow farmers to grow larger marketable surpluses that, in turn, can provide more \nagricultural wage employment, particularly benefiting the poor. Road improvement will also facilitate more timely \naccess to schools, medical clinics and employment centers. Lower transportation costs will increase mobility that will \nallow the poor to find employment opportunities in other areas. The project will also provide more reliable access to \nsocial services, particularly health care services and education facilities. Another important impact of increased access \nto local, national, and international markets will be growth of local trade, and production activities, and reduced prices \nof  agricultural  commodities  and  other  products.  With  improved  regional  trade  and  transit,  new  employment \nopportunities will be generated, facilitating rehabilitation of displaced populations and ex-combatants, inter-ethnic \nreconciliation, and improvement of security and stability. The benefit of the improved road in terms of reduction of \nvehicle operating costs will not only be transferred to the road users but will also decrease the chances of deaths and \ndisabilities from accidents due to  extremely poor road conditions. Thus increased economic activity and easy access \nto social services are expected to significantly increase household incomes and quality of life, thereby reducing overall \npoverty incidence.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes    No \nIs there a participation strategy?    Yes    No \n \nThe project has identified and consulted with the key primary and secondary project stakeholders in the prominent \ntowns and the project influence area. During the course of social analysis, consultations and meetings with the various \nproject communities including farmers, small shop owners, traders, and local nongovernment organizations were \norganized to ascertain their response to construction of the road, their needs and demands from the project. Apart \nfrom the public meetings, focus group discussions were organized with the young, old, men and women of different \noccupations and population groups to ensure a comprehensive perspective on the project as well as its impacts. All \nthose consulted unanimously welcomed the benefits that improved access and/or road conditions would provide.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen in the project area, as those in much of Afghanistan, have a role that is secondary to that of men. Women are \nbasically confined to household activities, including taking care of children and providing input to the agriculture sector, \nwith only a few coming to the workplace in recent years and gaining an education. They lack authority over the \nresources and power in decision-making in major household and other economic activities. Women in Afghanistan are \ngenerally denied inheritance rights, adequate food and nutrition, choice of education, and participation in the decision-\nmaking  process  for  household  economic  activities.  The  women  in  the  project  influence  area  are  engaged  in \nagricultural activities and carpet making. The project will provide benefits to women in the form of reduced travel times \nand transport costs that will result in more cash income for the household. With the improved road combined with \nincreased transportation facilities, women will find it easier to reach schools, clinics, and hospitals, bazaars, food \nmarkets, and other market centers, and, if needed, to go to district and provincial capitals. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Introduction \n \n1.  Benefit and cost analysis for the whole road section between Andkhoy and Herat was \nconducted. Although the Asian Development Bank finances a portion of the section of about 90 \nkilometers (km), the remainder of the section will be constructed in parallel using other financing \nsources.  This  is  considered  reasonable  as  the  benefits  are  expected  to  accrue  mainly  to \ngenerated and induced traffic with the completion of the section. The analysis used the highway \ndesign and maintenance model (HDM4) with modification for conditions in Afghanistan. Data \nunder the same conditions in neighboring countries were adopted for unavailable input data. \nEconomic evaluation was made by comparing cases of with and without the Project. The case \nwithout the Project reflects the current practice of doing nothing but keeping passability at the \nexisting level. \n \n2.  The project road was evaluated for a benefit period of 20 years, up to and including \n2028. A residual value of 10% was applied in 2028. The improved road will reduce operating \ncosts and travel time, which will lead to a stimulus in economic growth in the project area. All \nbenefits and costs are expressed in 2005 constant prices. \n \nB.  Road Conditions \n \n3.  Homogeneous sections are defined based on traffic volumes derived from the traffic \nanalysis, road geometry, and roughness observed during the surveys, and altitude and gradient \nof the road.

Economic costs exclude price contingencies, taxes, and \nduties. Taxes and duties in Afghanistan are virtually zero at present.

Benefits \n \n9.  The main quantifiable benefits of the investment are (i) the savings in vehicle operating \ncosts (VOCs) and (ii) savings in travel time. VOC savings were calculated using HDM4 for each \nvehicle type. Following the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project, \nthe value of time per vehicle was estimated at $0.38 plus $0.11 per passenger, and $0.50 per \ntruck plus $0.25 per passenger. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to savings in \ntravel time. The benefits for generated traffic are considered to be 50% of those for normal \ntraffic. \n \n3.   Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n10.  An economic evaluation was undertaken by section. The maintenance standard for the \ndo-nothing case is spot-graveling every year to keep the surface condition at the minimum level \nof international roughness index (IRI) = 15. For the with-project case, overlay is applied when \nthe roughness of the road surface reaches IRI 5 m/km.   \n \n11.  The calculation of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the overall project road \nresults in 17.4%, 18.4%, and 18.8% for alternatives 1, 2, and 3, respectively, considering the \nsavings from VOCs and travel as benefits.

Sensitivity Analysis \n \n12.  The sensitivity of the EIRR for the core road and the project road shown in Table A11.7 \nfor alternative 3 was analyzed with respect to changes in the benefit and cost streams. Five \nsensitivity test cases were examined: (i) construction costs increase by 25%, (ii) construction \ncompletion is delayed by 1 year, (iii) no time savings are considered, (iv) no generated traffic is \nobserved, and (v) traffic growth rate decreases by 50%. The results show that the quantified \neconomic benefits are robust to various sensitivity tests for the overall project road. \n \n ", "Appendix 11  49\n \nTable A11.7: Results of Sensitivity Tests for Alternative 3 (AC 90 mm) \n \nEIRR  \nCase \n(%) \nBase Case  18.8 \n(i)   25% increase in construction costs    16.3 \n(ii)  Construction completion delayed by 1 year  17.8 \n(iii) No time savings  18.5 \n(iv) No generated traffic  12.5 \n(v)  50% decrease in traffic growth rates    15.3 \n(vi) Combination of (i) and (v)  12.7 \nAC = asphalt concrete, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, mm = millimeter.     \nSources: Asian Development Bank and consultant\u2019s estimates. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20050729151611+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20050722153050+08'00'", "Title": "CONFIDENTIAL", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 6.0 for Word", "Author": "Grant L.
