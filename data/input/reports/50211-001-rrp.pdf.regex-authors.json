THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the Dili to Baucau Highway Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will upgrade and climate-proof 105 kilometers (km) of the national road \nbetween the capital, Dili, and the second-largest town, Baucau, which is located on the north \ncoast. The government has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to cofinance the \nproposed project on a parallel basis with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). \nADB will support upgrading and climate-proofing 56 km of the road connecting the towns of \nManatuto and Baucau, and JICA will support the section between Dili and Manatuto (49 km). \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The government\u2019s Strategic Development Plan, 2011\u20132030 aims to promote economic \ngrowth,  fast-track  economic  development,  and  modernize  and  diversify  the  economy  by \nproviding the country with high-quality infrastructure.2 Current government operational plans \nconcentrate on upgrading roads to achieve quick returns and transformational changes needed \nfor economic progress, inclusive development, and social stability. \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for Timor-Leste maintains ADB\u2019s focus \non the development and management of infrastructure, and on complementary activities that \nsupport the private sector as a driver of change.3 The country partnership strategy aims to help \nthe  country  make  services  more  available  outside  of  the  capital  city  of  Dili  by  improving \ntransport connectivity, which will (i) reduce poverty by giving the poor access to markets and \nbasic public services, and (ii) help spread economic activity and the benefits of the country\u2019s \npetroleum wealth more broadly to areas beyond the capital. The Dili to Baucau road is expected \nto stimulate a range of economic activity, particularly tourism, which Timor-Leste is specifically \ntargeting to create employment opportunities. \n \n5.  The road network in Timor-Leste deteriorated during a 25-year conflict from 1975 until \n1999 that preceded independence in 2002 due to a lack of investment in maintenance and \nrehabilitation. Progressive deterioration continued during 2002\u20132011, and poor road conditions \nhave constrained the country\u2019s efforts to develop. In 2010, ADB, JICA, and the World Bank \nsigned a joint aide memoire pledging to coordinate their support for a 5-year, 1,000 km core \nroad program.4 At the time, ADB was working with JICA toward cofinancing of the Dili to Baucau \nroad as part of this core road program. Subsequently, JICA decided it would support the Dili to \nBaucau road on its own, while ADB developed its support for other priority roads. Since then, \nADB, JICA, and the World Bank have continued to collaborate closely with each other, and a \nvigorous program of road upgrading is now under implementation and managed by a joint \nproject management unit (PMU). \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Timor-Leste. 2011.

When detailed engineering design and associated cost estimates were completed under \nthe JICA-financed project preparatory work, it became clear that there would be a significant \nshortfall in the financing plan for the construction of the Dili to Baucau road, primarily because of \nthe devaluation of a yen-denominated loan from JICA. The shortfall comprises 100% of the civil \nworks cost of the Manatuto to Baucau section of the project (approximately $59 million). The \ngovernment, which had originally intended to self-finance the shortfall, became aware of the \nadvantages of availing itself of concessional financing rather than depleting its sovereign wealth \nfund.5 The government now aims for at least 75% of a project designated for loan financing to \nbe  loan-financed.  This  policy  was  reinforced  by  recommendations  resulting  from  the \nInternational Monetary Fund\u2019s yearly bilateral discussion with Timor-Leste.6 The government \nalso  appreciates  that  oversight  of  development  partners  provides  a  better  framework  for \ndisciplined project administration and implementation. The government has therefore requested \nADB to help meet the financing shortfall. \n \n7.  The project comprises two civil works packages, both of which have been procured and \nawarded in accordance with JICA procurement policies. ADB has been requested to finance the \npackage for the Manatuto to Baucau section of the project. ADB has conducted a detailed post-\nreview of the procurement process carried out by the government for that package, including \nprequalification  and  bidding  documents,  bidding  procedures,  and  contract  documentation \nprocurement process and bid evaluation. ADB has concluded that the package was procured in \na manner consistent with the principles of ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended \nfrom time to time). A summary of the assessment is in paras. 19\u201320 and 25. ADB\u2019s financing of \nthe Manatuto to Baucau section will enable the entire road between Dili and Baucau to be \naccomplished to the appropriate standards, and help achieve the full benefits of the project. \n \n8.   ADB has financed the Road Network Development Sector Project, the Road Network \nUpgrading Project, and the Road Network Upgrading Sector Project (RNUSP).7 The Road \nNetwork Upgrading Project and the RNUSP were scaled up with additional financing from ADB. \nIn total, development partners will have supported the upgrading of about 560 km (39%) of the \nmost important sections of the national road network by the end of 2019. The Government of \nAustralia and the European Union have focused on road rehabilitation and maintenance of \nsecondary  rural  roads  through  the  development  of  small-scale  contractors  and  community \ninvolvement. The European Union is financing a project for rehabilitating 43 km of rural roads in \neconomically  important  coffee-growing  areas,  which  will  be  administered  by  ADB.  ADB\u2019s \nprojects are on track to upgrade 287 km of national roads by 2019, of which 100 km have been \ncompleted. Projects completed to date are of high standards and are delivering the expected \nbenefits. \n \n9.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works,  Transport  and  Communications  (MPWTC)  lacks  the \ninstitutional capacity needed to properly implement capital works or maintain road assets. ADB-\nfinanced  technical  assistance  is  supporting  the  implementation  of  a  capacity  development \n                                                \n5  Timor-Leste has a sovereign wealth fund (the Petroleum Fund) of approximately $16 billion, which is derived from \nits oil and gas revenues. \n6  International Monetary Fund. 2016.

", "    3   \nframework and a strategic development plan for the MPWTC. A PMU embedded in the MPWTC \nis  responsible  for  managing  ADB,  JICA,  and  World  Bank  programs.  It  has  considerable \nexperience in dealing with the requirements of development partners and other government \nagencies.  The  PMU  has  successfully  coordinated  the  various  programs  of  development \npartners and has ensured that technical standards and safeguards have been consistently \napplied across these programs. \n \n10.  The  MPWTC  plans  to  introduce  performance-based  maintenance  contracts  for  all \nupgraded roads. However, civil works contracts for all development partner-financed roads \nrequire contractors to carry out routine maintenance for 2 years after the defects notification \nperiod.8 Two performance-based maintenance contracts have been piloted under ADB\u2019s Road \nNetwork Development Sector Project (footnote 7). An international road maintenance specialist \nfinanced by ADB has provided support to the MPWTC\u2019s newly created maintenance division in \npreparing  its  detailed  road  maintenance  plan for  2016. Technical  assistance from  JICA  is \nsupporting a 3-year capacity development program for road maintenance. It commenced in May \n2016 and is actively supporting implementation of the 2016 annual road maintenance plan and \nthe development of future programs. \n \n11.  The proposed project comprises upgrading the most heavily trafficked road outside of \nDili, which links the capital to Bacau as well as the entire eastern half of the island. Traffic \nvolumes vary between 2,000 and 1,200 vehicles per day along its length, comprising a high \nproportion of light goods vehicles and buses. The existing road is 4.5 meters (m) wide and in \npoor condition. Upgrading will comprise climate-proofing measures and widening to 6.0 m, with \n1.0 m shoulders. Climate change and climate resilience measures include drainage designed \nfor increased rainfall intensity, provision of a resilient pavement surfaced with 50-millimeter-thick \nasphalt, raising of the road in flood-prone areas, and general application of best engineering \npractices. The European Space Agency provided technical assistance that allowed for more \naccurate determination of historical rainfall intensity in the catchments of water courses affecting \nthe  project.  This  information  resulted  in  the  conservative  design  (oversizing)  of  drainage \nstructures to cater for the increased rainfall intensity that has been forecasted for the future. \n \n12.  ADB is supporting a national road safety action plan under the RNUSP (footnote 7). The \ngovernment established a Road Safety Directorate in the Ministry of the Interior in early 2016, \nwhich will be responsible for prioritizing and implementing activities under the national road \nsafety action plan. All donor-financed projects (including past projects) include raising road \nsafety awareness in roadside communities and schools.   \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the project will be increased and more efficient movement of people and \ngoods. The outcome will be a more reliable and safer road network. \n \nC.  Outputs \n14.  The outputs of the project will be the (i) upgrading and climate-proofing of 105 km of the \nnational road between Dili and Bacau, (ii) expansion of performance-based maintenance, and \n(iii) generation of awareness of road safety and transport-related social issues. \n                                                \n8  A defects notification period is where the contractor is responsible for correcting defects and making repairs on an \nupgraded road within 1 year after completion of construction. The contractor is responsible for maintenance of the \naccepted works for 2 years after this 1-year period ends. \n ", "4   \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n15.

Interest during construction for the ADB loan has been computed at 2% per annum on \ndisbursed amounts. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n16.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR35,467,000 ($49.65 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance \nthe project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest \nrate of 2.0% per annum during the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The loan will finance civil works, consulting \nservices,  taxes  and  duties,  and  financing  charges  during  implementation  on  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund loan. \n   \n17.  The government will contribute $27.19 million to the cost of the overall project. The \ngovernment contribution will finance civil works, land acquisition, taxes and duties, audit costs, \nand resettlement costs.9 The government has assured ADB that it will meet any financing \nshortfall to help support the full implementation of project outputs. In 2012, JICA provided loan \ncofinancing in the amount of JPY5,278 million on a parallel basis. This amount will finance civil \nworks for the Dili to Manatuto section and consulting services. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank      \nSpecial Funds resources (loan)  49.65  39.2 \nJapan International Cooperation Agency   49.74a  39.3 \nGovernment  27.19  21.5 \nTotal  126.58  100.0 \na The amount of JPY5,278 million, parallel cofinancing was recorded in 2012.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                \n9  The amount of taxes and duties (i) is within the reasonable threshold identified during the country partnership \nstrategy preparation process, (ii) does not represent an excessive share of the project investment plan, and (iii) will \nonly be financed in respect of ADB-financed expenditures. Financing of taxes and duties is material and relevant to \nthe success of the project. ", "    5   \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  A PMU established in the MPWTC is responsible for the management of all loan- and \ngrant-financed projects for upgrading of national roads, including those of ADB. The PMU is \nheaded by a project manager and has a full-time professional staff, including a chief technical \nadvisor,  a  road  construction  advisor,  a  road  maintenance  engineer,  and  a  financial \nadministrator. As the PMU's portfolio responsibilities grow, it has also strengthened steadily.  \nInternational and national specialists provide a full-time safeguards unit within the PMU. \n \n19.  The government carried out the procurement of both civil works packages for the project \nthrough international competitive bidding in accordance with JICA procurement policies. The \nmultilateral  development  banks\u2019  harmonized  standard  bidding  documents  with  JICA\u2019s \nrequirements were used. The civil works contract for the road section from Manatuto to Baucau \n(to be financed by the ADB loan) was awarded on 22 December 2015 and signed by the \ngovernment and contractor on 31 March 2016. To accommodate the government\u2019s request to \nfinance this contract, ADB (with assistance from an external consultant) conducted a detailed \npost-review of the procurement process and bid evaluation for this civil works package to \nensure that procurement was undertaken in a manner consistent with the principles of ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines.10 The review confirmed that this is the case. Financing the contract \n(instead of rebidding under ADB requirements) helps achieve economy and efficiency in project \nimplementation  given  the  use  of  standard  bidding  documents  and  substantial  similarity  of \nprocurement  and  evaluation  processes.  Eligible  bidders  were  provided  with  the  same \ninformation  and  equal  opportunity  to  compete  in  the  bidding,  and  there  was  sufficient \ncompetition. There was adequate transparency in the single-stage procurement process, i.e., \ntwo-envelope procedure preceded by a prequalification exercise with detailed evaluation reports \nprepared by the government that were subject to JICA\u2019s prior review and clearance for the \nprequalification, technical evaluation, and price evaluation stages. While the contractor is a joint \nventure comprising two firms from ADB members, the contract does not place any restriction on \nthe origin of goods to be supplied under the contract. Neither the joint venture nor the firms \nconstituting the joint venture are subject to ADB sanctions. The government and JICA confirmed \nthat no representations or complaints were received in connection with the procurement. Since \nthe procurement of the contract has already been completed and can no longer be carried out \nunder ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines, and because the contract does not restrict the origin of \ngoods to be supplied under the contract to ADB members, the Board\u2019s approval is sought to \nwaive  the  applicability  of  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and  ADB\u2019s  member  country \nprocurement eligibility restrictions11 for the financing of this contract package. \n \n20.  The government has also requested retroactive financing for the Manatuto to Baucau \ncontract up to 20% of the ADB loan amount for a period not exceeding 12 months from the \nsigning  of  the  loan  agreement.  One  of  the  requirements  for  retroactive  financing  is  for \nprocurement to follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The Board\u2019s approval is sought to waive \nthis requirement on the grounds that procurement has already been completed under JICA \nauspices, and that ADB is satisfied with the manner in which the procurement was undertaken. \nTo ensure that other ADB requirements are adhered to, environmental and social safeguard \nprovisions under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) as well as other pertinent policy \nprovisions (such as those related to labor standards and anticorruption) will be incorporated in \n                                                \n10  Executive Summary of Procurement Review on ICB/21/MPWTC-2015\u2013Upgrading of Manatuto\u2013Baucau Road \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 To permit procurement (i) in countries that are not (a) developing member countries of ADB or (b) developed \nmember countries of ADB that have contributed to the Asian Development Fund; and (ii) of goods, works, and \nservices produced in such countries. \n ", "6   \nthis civil works contract through a contract amendment to be signed by the government and the \ncontractor prior to loan disbursement. Similarly, the consulting firm (financed under the JICA \nloan) overseeing construction supervision will agree to contract amendment to incorporate ADB \nrequirements prior to loan disbursement. \n \n21.

The detailed engineering design and construction supervision for the two civil works \npackages is financed from the JICA loan. ADB will finance the civil works contract package for \nthe Manatuto to Baucau road; JICA will finance the civil works package for the Dili to Manatuto \nroad on a parallel basis. Design and procurement of construction supervision services (covering \nboth packages in a single contract) have also been completed under the auspices of JICA and \nare 100% financed by the JICA loan. Construction commenced in August 2016. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n23.  The project is relatively straightforward and adopts the same technical specifications and \nprocedures applied in other national road upgrading projects financed by ADB and the World \nBank. The pavements of the roads to be upgraded will be reconstructed and will allow for faster \ntravel and substantially reduced vehicle operating costs. Climate resilience is emphasized in all \ndesigns regardless of the source of financing. Vulnerability to damage from extreme rainfall, sea \nlevel rise, and other potential effects of climate change will be reduced through engineering \ncountermeasures, including providing suitably sized drainage structures, raising road levels in \nflood-prone  areas,  and  using  bioengineering  to  promote  slope  stability.  A  2-year  post- \nconstruction performance-based maintenance component is included in both the ADB and JICA \ncivil works packages. \n                                                \n12  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "    7   \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  Economic and financial analysis has been undertaken for the project in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.13 The project has an economic internal \nrate of return of 14.8% and a net present value of $16.5 million. Fuel prices as of June 2016 \nhave been used in the analysis. If fuel prices return to June 2015 levels, the economic internal \nrate of return would increase to approximately 16.6%. As civil works contracts have already \nbeen awarded, construction costs are known with a high degree of certainty. The engineering \nassessment found that the cost of maintaining an upgraded road in Timor-Leste is significantly \nless than the maintenance cost of unimproved roads. The cost of maintaining the road in the \nwith-project case is $0.25 million per year, while the cost of maintaining the road in the without-\nproject case is estimated to be $0.75 million. From 2013 to 2016, the government has allocated \n$43.5 million for the rehabilitation of roads, in addition to approximately $15 million per annum \nfor reconstruction of national roads. The Petroleum Fund currently stands at approximately $16 \nbillion  and  is  prudently  managed,  so  Timor-Leste  is  well  placed  to  allocate  funds  for \nmaintenance of assets. 14 \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  The National Procurement Commission was established in 2011. Since 2012, it has \nsatisfactorily  administered  a  number  of  bidding  processes  for  ADB-financed  projects  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. However, the transparency and efficiency of \nprocurement  still  needs  improvement,  and  a  balance  between  risk  and  accountability  for \nprojects that do not have development partner oversight has not yet been achieved. \n \n26.  The public financial management system is heavily centralized with numerous controls \nthat have slowed payment processes and weakened budget implementation. The Ministry of \nFinance  has  promoted  decentralization  of  noncore  financial  management  functions  to  line \nministries, as capacity within these agencies has increased. However, the system for payments \ncontinues to involve a number of agencies in reviewing the payment certificates provided by the \nPMU and MPWTC. \n \n27.  The  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects, and Financial Due Diligence: \nA Methodology Note.15 The financial management assessment considered the capacity of the \nCouncil  for  Administration  of  the  Infrastructure  Fund  (CAFI)  through  the  Major  Projects \nSecretariat, and of the MPWTC through the PMU, including funds flow arrangements, staffing, \naccounting and financial reporting systems, financial information systems, and internal and \nexternal auditing arrangements. Based on the assessment, the key financial management risks \nidentified are the absence of internal audit function, inadequate reporting by the PMU, and the \nlack of credibility of the budget process. The overall pre-mitigation financial management risk of \nthe CAFI and MPWTC, as it relates to the project outputs, is moderate. The CAFI (through the \nMajor Projects Secretariat) and the MPWTC (through the PMU) have agreed to implement an \naction plan as a key measure to address the deficiencies. \n \n                                                \n13  ADB. 1997.

The executing agency, the CAFI, was established in 2011 to oversee the use of the \nInfrastructure  Fund.  The  Civil  Service  Act  provides  standards,  principles,  definitions,  and \nguidelines  for  civil  service  administration;  a  code  of  ethics  for  civil  servants;  and  an \nadministrative disciplinary mechanism. A law creating the new Anti-Corruption Commission \nbecame effective in 2009, and the first anticorruption commissioner was appointed in 2010. \n \n29.  To  mitigate  risks,  the  MPWTC  has  implemented  a  number  of  ADB-supported \ninfrastructure projects through its PMU. The PMU will oversee the implementation of the project. \nThe PMU has a financial administrator who has considerable experience with ADB-financed \nprojects. Based on previous project implementation experience, the PMU has demonstrable \ncapacity to manage the project. \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  the \ngovernment  and  CAFI.  Specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the project administration manual (footnote 12). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n31.  The primary beneficiaries of the project are (i) road users, including vehicle drivers, \npassengers, and nonmotorized transport users; (ii) households in communities that sell cash \ncrops and other agricultural produce; (iii) providers of passenger and goods transport services, \nand commercial truck drivers; and (iv) small businesses and traders, including vendors at local \nmarkets, trade store owners, coffee and other produce buyers, and small- and medium-sized \nenterprises.  These  groups  will  particularly  benefit  from  more  reliable  and  less  costly \ntransportation, resulting in lower cost of production and improved and more diversified economic \nactivities. Key social service providers, such as those in the education and health sectors, will \nalso benefit from increased accessibility and utilization of social services due to road upgrading. \nWomen have been generally excluded from infrastructure-related jobs and decision-making \nrelated to infrastructure development. To address this within the project, it will incorporate \nwomen\u2019s views during implementation, and women will be encouraged to participate in an \nHIV/AIDS prevention program, and road safety and other awareness activities. Flexibility in the \nexisting project design will be explored to incorporate gender elements where feasible.     \n    \nE.  Safeguards \n32.  Environment. The project is categorized as B for environment. Following the process \nand  procedures  already  established  by  the  PMU,  JICA-financed  consultants completed  an \nenvironmental assessment, including an environmental management plan (EMP), for the Dili to \nBaucau section of the national road. ADB reviewed the environmental assessment (including \nthe  EMP)  to  confirm  that  it  complies  with  Timor-Leste\u2019s  country  safeguard  system  for \nenvironment and the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The assessment \nconfirms that the environmental effects of the project will be similar in scale and impact to those \nof completed and ongoing road projects. The potential impacts will be site-specific and readily \nmitigated through measures identified in the EMP. Few, if any, of the impacts will be irreversible. \nCapacity  building  of  the  PMU\u2019s  environmental  safeguards  staff  will  be  ongoing  through \nextension of the contracts of the international specialists providing mentoring and on-the-job \ntraining.  Additional resources will be provided through specialists assigned to the design and \nsupervision consultants\u2019 teams to help support the PMU effectively implement this project. For \nenvironment safeguards, next steps will include (i) providing induction training to the successful \ncontractor for preparation, and subsequent implementation, of the site-specific EMP; and (ii) ", "    9   \nmonitoring the contractor\u2019s compliance with the site-specific EMP approved by the PMU, and \npreparing and submitting semiannual safeguards monitoring reports by the PMU.     \n \n33.  Social safeguards. The project is categorized as B for involuntary resettlement and C \nfor indigenous peoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Road upgrading \nand rehabilitation will be conducted within the existing road corridor, with widening requiring \nsmall strips of land beyond the government-reserved area. As much as possible, construction \nlimits are set within the existing alignment to minimize land acquisition impacts. The ADB-\nfunded Manatuto to Baucau section is considered the most sensitive, with 137 affected persons \nexperiencing  major  impacts  from  losing  residential  houses  and/or  permanent  commercial \nkiosks, which constitute more than 10% of each affected person\u2019s income-earning assets. The \nJICA-financed Dili to Manatuto section will have 133 affected persons experiencing the same \nimpacts. Two separate resettlement plans (one for the Dili to Manatuto section and one for the \nManatuto  to  Baucau  section)  have  been  prepared  jointly  by  JICA-financed  project  design \nconsultants and the PMU and started implementation in July 2016. A social compliance audit \nhas been undertaken to assess the project\u2019s compliance with the Safeguard Policy Statement \nand to recommend corrective actions to bring it into compliance prior to ADB financing of civil \nworks. ADB and JICA will administer their respective road sections with joint supervision and \nmonitoring of safeguards activities through the PMU, which will work closely with the safeguards \nteam under the construction supervision consultant. Key stakeholders and affected persons \nhave been consulted during the resettlement plan preparation and disclosure, and will be further \nconsulted during implementation. The social compliance audit report will be disclosed on the \nADB website and to affected persons and other relevant stakeholders. Capacity building of the \nPMU\u2019s  national  social  safeguard  staff  will  be  provided  by  maintaining  and  extending  the \ncontracts of international specialists in the PMU. \n \n34.  The project is not expected to impact any distinct and vulnerable groups as defined by \nthe Safeguard Policy Statement and therefore does not require an indigenous peoples plan. The \nproject will support and promote the participation of local communities, and it will work to \nprovide them with culturally appropriate benefits. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n35.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.16 The  risks  can  be  managed  and  are \nmitigated by the design of the project. The intended benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLand acquisition delays the start of civil  Resettlement plans will be finalized and compensation will be paid before \nworks  civil works begin.
